  Over the circus of high school STUDENTS arriving by bus, car, 
  bike and foot, WE HEAR SAMMY MEADE broadcast...

                              SAMMY MEADE (V.O.)
                ...and what a night-day 
                  doubleheader Dillon has this 
                weekend!  First, Friday Night, the 
                football Panthers look to sharpen 
                their claws against the hapless 
                Ramapo Rams - the worst team in the 
                  division.  

    A SKATEBOARDER ramps into the school entrance, down the 
  crowded hallway, whizzes by a teacher carrying coffee, races 
  the length of the hallway and out...

  THE BACK OF THE SCHOOL

  THE SKATEBOARDER rolls down a ramp, gathers momentum, then 
  LAUNCHES --

  CLOSE ON the skateboarder, AIRBORNE...  He lands 
    successfully.  He coasts toward...

  THE FOOTBALL FIELD

  The team is running a blocking drill: two lines, lead player 
  in each line faces off, driving into the other with all 
  they ve got at the whistle.  

                              SAMMY MEADE (V.O)
                I tell you, the only way the 
                Panthers lose this game is by 
                beating themselves.  But one 
                massacre won t be enough for 
                Dillon.  Not this weekend.  

  PULL FOCUS to CHEERLEADERS practicing on the sideline.  

                              SAMMY MEADE (V.O.) (CONT D)
                The Southwest Cheerleading 
                  Regionals start this Saturday, and 
                the young Panther Squad, led by 
                                (MORE)


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      2.

                captain Lyla Garrity, is hunting 
                for victory.  Hell, these ladies 
                feel confident about winning.  And 
                let Sammy give y all a bit of 
                advice: don t bet against these 
                  Panthers,  cause these little 
                ladies are tough...

  Sammy s broadcast continues over...


  LYLA GARRITY, in gym shorts and a T-shirt, stands over a 
  sink.  Her eyes are red; she chokes back sobs.  Lyla pulls 
  paper towel after paper towel out of the dispenser, then runs 
  water over the towels.

                              SAMMY MEADE (V.O.)
                These little ladies are easy on the 
                eyes, too.  Which not only helps 
                the football player giving it his 
                all on the field, but also helps 
                put asses in the seats.

  MOVE WITH LYLA as she carries the towels to...

  HER LOCKER.  WHORE is scrawled across in lipstick.  Lyla 
  scrubs the locker clean.  She stops, the word no longer 
  visible.  The sting of it, however, is still there.  OFF 
  LYLA, as she resumes scrubbing --


  A giant AMERICAN FLAG draped across one wall provides a 
  backdrop as the CHEERLEADING SQUAD practices.  But this is no 
  rah-rah pom-poms bullshit.  These girls are synchronized 
  gymnasts, and they whip across the gym, doing backflips and 
    corkscrews as they practice their routine.  The girls are all 
  business, with no make-up and sweating like jocks.  

  PICK UP Lyla as she enters the gym.  The squad stops.  Lyla 
  glares.  WE HEAR some giggles.

                              KENNEDY
                        (taunting)
                Lyla Garrity, she s the best, every 
                guy wants to touch her chest.

                              BRITTANY
                Panthers roar, Panthers soar, but 
                Panther cheerleaders ain t no 
                whore.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      3.

    CONTINUED:


  A WHISTLE BLOWS.  MISS DER, the cheerleading coach (35), a 
  former Miss Texas blonde bomb who is driven to win and cold 
  as ice, marches to the front of the gym.  

                              MISS DER
                Cut the bullshit!  The tournament 
                starts this Saturday, and we ve 
                been working for too long to screw 
                up now.  I need you serious, I need 
                you focused.  I need you committed 
                to winning - I for one don t want 
                to take home a silver medal.
                        (smiles)
                I like gold.

  The squad echoes the sentiment. 

                              MISS DER (CONT D)
                And Lyla - I need you here on time.  

  Lyla wants to explain, but Miss Der raises her hand --

                              MISS DER (CONT D)
                I don t want to hear it.  Okay 
                  everyone, let s run it again.  And 
                use the music to keep your beat.

  Miss Der cranks up THEME MUSIC.  The squad tumbles, an 
  acrobatic display.  Lyla backflips across the floor, then 
  VAULTS into the hands of BRITTANY (her supporting base), as 
  the squad forms a pyramid.  

  ON LYLA, arms raised, the pinnacle of the pyramid.  But as we 
  MOVE CLOSE ON LYLA, it s clear her mind is elsewhere.  Lyla 
  loses her balance, FALLS...

  Lands heavily on top of Brittany.  Brittany pushes her off.

                              BRITTANY
                Great.  I guess Tim Riggins banged 
                the balance right on out of you.

  OFF Lyla sprawled on the floor, a blank expression masking 
  her misery...


  CLOSE ON JASON STREET, his blank expression similar to 
  Lyla s.  Sun shines on his face and wind whips through his 
  hair...




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      4.

    CONTINUED:


  REVEAL: a Cadillac racing across the Texas landscape.  
  There s a wheelchair strapped to the roof.

  ANGLE ON Jason, in the back.  Jason s hand is out the window, 
  buffeted by the wind.  CLOSE ON MITCHELL STREET S EYES, 
  watching from the rear view mirror.

                              MITCHELL STREET 
                Got a great deal customizing the 
                car, son.  It s amazing what they 
                can do.  We re going to fit it with 
                hand controls so you can drive.  

                              JASON
                Cool.

                                JOANNE STREET
                  Everything s going to be okay, 
                honey.  You re going home.

  FIND JOANNE STREET, in the passenger seat.  While Mrs. Street 
  is sincerely overjoyed, she s also anxious about the future - 
  and no smile painted on her face can hide this.  Jason smiles 
  back, but then his smile fades as his eyes are drawn to...

  THE HANDICAPPED PLACARD hanging from the rear view mirror.  

                                                                      SMASH TO:


  Jason enters.  The room is filled with trophies and pictures 
  and newspaper articles, relics from glory past.

                              MITCHELL STREET
                Welcome home, son.

  His father hugs him; it s awkward because of the wheelchair.  
  Jason smiles weakly.  Welcome home indeed.

                                JOANNE STREET
                Are you hungry, Jason?  Want lunch?

                              JASON
                I m fine, mom.  Just tired.  You 
                guys mind if I lie down?

                                JOANNE STREET
                Not at all.

                              MITCHELL STREET
                You need a hand? 

                              JASON
                Legs, dad.  I need legs.
                      (beat)
                It s a joke.  Seriously, I m fine.

  The Streets exit, a little too eagerly.  The door shuts and 
  Jason sits alone, surrounded by his history.  He picks up a 
  photo of Lyla and himself.  Stares.  Tears well up, but he 
  forces them back.  Puts the picture in a drawer and closes 
  it.  OFF this...


  Coach drives, Tami next to him, and Julie in the back.

                                TAYLOR
                I think sharing the stage with the 
                  cheerleaders is good.  Those girls 
                work hard; they deserve it.  

                              TAMI
                Doesn t their tournament take the 
                focus off the football game?  Isn t 
                that dangerous to the team?

  Tami s pushing his buttons, and Coach knows it.

                                TAYLOR
                Hell, I plan to channel the energy 
                those girls put into my players and 
                use it Friday Night.  

                              TAMI
                        (whispers)
                Like you use to channel my energy?  

                                TAYLOR
                Exactly.

  Tami kisses Coach.  Long and sexy.

                              JULIE
                Hey!  The road!!

                                TAYLOR
                I m watching!  Anyway, I love the 
                idea of a co-pep rally.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      9.

    CONTINUED:


                              JULIE
                You want my thoughts on 
                  cheerleading?

  Coach doesn t, but knows he s going to hear it.

                              JULIE (CONT D)
                It s even more pointless than 
                  football.

                              TAMI
                Careful.  Football pays our bills.

                                TAYLOR
                Amen, sister.

                              JULIE
                Okay, I concede that.  I even 
                concede that football has a purpose 
                in terms of entertainment, though 
                for the life of me, I don t know 
                why.  But cheerleading?  Cheering 
                for others to entertain?

                                TAYLOR
                This is Texas cheerleading, and 
                those girls are tough.  Real jocks.  

                              JULIE
                Then why don t the girls get paid 
                like jocks?  Do you know a Dallas 
                Cowboy Cheerleader makes fifty 
                dollars a game while the average 
                NFL player makes forty thousand per 
                game.  Cheerleading is sexist, dad.  
                Girls jumping up and down in short 
                skirts waving pom-poms, singing 
                silly ditties.  And why?  Are girls 
                hard wired to put on short skirts 
                and cheer for men?

                                TAYLOR
                      (a long beat, then)
                Are you, uh, planning something?  I 
                mean, like, shaving your head and 
                moving to New York?  I m just 
                asking.


  Lyla, draped in an oversized flannel shirt, is at the 
  breakfast table.  



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      10.

                              LYLA
                I don t feel well.  I swear it.

  PAM GARRITY absentmindedly feels Lyla s forehead.  No fever.

                              PAM 
                You re fine.

  ON Lyla, she doesn t have the strength to argue.  PICK UP 
  BUDDY GARRITY as he enters, pours himself coffee.

                              BUDDY
                Don t worry, this will all blow 
                over.  Those kids will have 
                  something better to talk about.  

  BACK TO Lyla, even more worried at the mention of other kids.

                              BUDDY (CONT D)
                There s no quit in Lyla Garrity.  
                No matter what comes at you, you 
                keep going.  That s my baby.  Now 
                get dressed.  Practice, remember?  
                Got to get that W for the squad on 
                  Saturday.  This is your moment in 
                the sun.  You deserve this.

  OFF Lyla, buoyed by her father s words...


  Jason struggles to put his pants on, literally lifting his 
  limbs and pushing them into his pants.  He s breathing 
  heavily.  But then his breathing quiets as HE HEARS... 

                                JOANNE STREET (O.S.)
                We have talked about this.  I don t 
                want to rehash what we ve already 
                settled.

                              MITCHELL STREET (O.S.)
                What we ve settled and what you 
                think we ve settled are two 
                  different things.

                                JOANNE STREET (O.S.)
                        (getting louder)
                Not now, Mitchell.  NOT NOW!

  ON JASON, quickly lifting himself into his chair.  PRELAP the 
  sizzle of Bacon...                                                                                      11.




  START ON bacon sizzling in a pan.  PICK UP Jason, wheeling to 
  the table.  FIND Mr. Street reading a newspaper.  He smiles.

                              MITCHELL STREET
                   Morning, son.

  Jason winks.  Fixes a fork to his hand so he can eat.  Mrs. 
  Street serves Jason a plate of bacon and eggs.

                                JOANNE STREET
                I bet you missed homemade cooking.

                              JASON
                I sure did.  Thanks, mom.

  ANGLE ON his father, peering over the paper, watching Jason 
  eat.

                                JOANNE STREET
                Uh, Jason, a lawyer s coming by 
                tonight.  Just to talk. 

  Mr. Street puts down the paper, clearly exasperated.  

                              JASON
                You and dad don t seem on the same 
                page about this.

                                JOANNE STREET
                There is no page yet.  This is all 
                about options.  Your father and I 
                are on the same page that we ll 
                spare no expense when it comes to 
                making you better.  Am I right, 
                  Mitchell?

  Mr. Street nods.

                              JASON
                Alright, mom.  We ll talk to the 
                lawyer.  

  He bites his bacon.  Mr. Street reads his paper.  Mrs. Street 
  sips her cup of coffee.  OFF this  Ordinary People  moment...


  The FOOTBALL TEAM pumps iron, young studs in cutoff T s with 
  ripped chests and iron-board stomachs.  MATT SARACEN and 
  Smash sit on bench presses, but neither is lifting.

                Don t you watch TV?

                              SARACEN
                I watch TV.

                              SMASH
                Well you re watching the wrong TV.  
                Man, I thought you were gonna eat 
                Julie s whole head, the way you 
                kissed her.  Gotta be smoother then 
                that.  Smooth like the Smash.

                              SARACEN
                That a fact?

                              SMASH
                Watch and learn.  I just met this 
                bangin  shorty, and I guarantee 
                I ll hit that  fore you cop a feel 
                off Julie Taylor.

                              DOLIA
                You saying you ll score on Waverly 
                Grady before Saracen gets second on 
                Julie Taylor?

                              SMASH
                That s what I m saying.

                              PUDNICK
                I don t know, Smash.  Waverly was 
                studying in Ghana for a year.  
                She s real smart, and she don t 
                give a damn about football.  You 
                might be overreaching.

                              SMASH
                  Nothing s out of reach to the 
                Smash.  I m one size fits all.   

                              DOLIA
                You ain t scoring on the Reverend s 
                  daughter.  I ll bet Saracen gets 
                second on Julie Taylor before you 
                score.

                              PUDNICK
                Julie Taylor is hot.  I d do her.

                              SMASH
                We all would.  You ve got a deal.

  LAUGHTER.  Suddenly, silence --

  REVEAL COACH TAYLOR, standing in the room. 

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                Hey... Coach.

  A long beat as Taylor s glare burns a hole.  

                                TAYLOR
                You girls lifting or chatting?

                              SARACEN
                We re lifting, sir.

  ANGLE ON Matt, pumping.  ANGLE ON Smash, doing the same.  

                                TAYLOR
                        (addressing the team)
                It would be a mistake to take a 
                vacation mentality to Friday 
                Night s game.  It s not just that 
                we might lose, but that we might 
                not win.  We have a chance here for 
                more than a W.  We have a chance to 
                  establish ourselves, to build a 
                  reputation.  To put fear into 
                future opponents.  Do not 
                  underestimate the power of fear.  

  Coach places his hands on Smash and Saracen s barbells.  

                                TAYLOR (CONT D)
                  Reputation plus intimidation equals 
                victory.  I want us to go all out 
                this Friday.  No let up.  This is a 
                chance to shine.  I want us to 
                shine.

  He gently pushes down on the barbells, creating resistance.  
  Smash and Saracen struggle...

                                TAYLOR (CONT D)
                Dig deep.  Focus on the game.  
                Focus only on this game.

  He pushes down harder - Smash and Saracen can no longer lift 
  and can barely keep the dumbbells from crushing them.  

  Coach walks away.  OFF Smash and Saracen, happy to be alive --                                                                                      14.




  Saracen is talking to Julie at her locker, or trying to, and 
  Julie is trying not to look excited.  But she really is.

                              SARACEN
                So, I was, you know - I didn t know 
                where I was.  Not that I didn t 
                know, but I forgot.  I was excited, 
                and just wanted to kiss you.  

                              JULIE
                You didn t realize you were in a 
                stadium filled with fifteen 
                thousand people?  Including my 
                father?

                              SARACEN
                Not at that moment.  I m sorry.  I, 
                uh, I won t do it again.  Okay?

                              JULIE
                Sure.

                              SARACEN
                But, that wasn t, I didn t come 
                here to apologize.  Not that I m 
                not sorry--

                              JULIE
                I get it.  Come on, cut to the 
                chase.

                              SARACEN
                Do you want to go out?  With me?  
                Tomorrow night?  We can--

                              JULIE
                Yes.

                              SARACEN
                What?

                              JULIE
                I said yes.

                              SARACEN
                You said yes?

                              JULIE
                Oh, brother.  We ve got to start 
                  communicating better. 



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      15.

    CONTINUED:


  OFF Matt, praying for help...


  Jason wakes with a GASP.  Takes several deep breaths until he 
  realizes he was dreaming.  Until he realizes that he s still 
    paralyzed.

  ANGLE ON Jason getting into his wheelchair.  Rolls around his 
  room, bored.  Peeks into his bathroom...

  CLOSE ON the metallic shower seat in his stall.  Shiny and 
  cold.  OFF Jason, realizing that what was once normal, will 
  never be normal again.  


  The class is divided between boys and girls.  JUDITH LEVINE 
  stands in the middle.

                                JUDITH
                Brian, you re on.  Monogamy in 
                  literature?

  ANGLE ON Smash, as he slowly stands.  It s clear that 
  whatever assignment was given, he didn t do.

                              SMASH
                I don t know about literature, but 
                I do know monogamy is bullshit.  
                It s man-made.  Actually, it s 
                  woman-made.

  The class LAUGHS.  FIND Waverly, slightly amused.

                                JUDITH
                Monogamy has been a theme in 
                  literature throughout history.  
                Homer s Iliad - today s assignment - 
                is an example, recounting the 
                  consequences of Helen s adultery.  
                But note Homer s double standard in 
                how Ulysses was easily forgiven for 
                dallying Circe in The Odyssey.  

                              SMASH
                That s  cause men can be with more 
                than one woman, but women should be 
                with only one man.

                                JUDITH
                Explain.

                              SMASH
                It s about the seed and the egg.  
                The flower and the bee.  The man s 
                job is to spread the pollen.  The 
                girl s is to grow it.  Now, can t 
                be growing more than one at a time, 
                can you?

                              AARON
                What the hell are you saying?





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      19.

    CONTINUED:


                              WAVERLY
                I think Smash is saying that 
                monogamy is not natural.  That the 
                male of any species is hard wired 
                for genetic diversity, thus 
                assuring his dominance in the 
                future.  

                              SMASH
                Exactly.  

                              WAVERLY
                It s rare to find monogamy in 
                nature, especially among mammals.  
                Beavers, otters, bats, some 
                  primates, but for the most part, 
                monogamy is not natural.  The male 
                instinct is to fertilize as many 
                eggs as possible.

                              SMASH
                I knew I liked you.

                              WAVERLY
                But that s what makes humans 
                  different.  Freud argues in 
                   Civilization and its Discontents  
                that civilization is founded on the 
                  repression of instincts.  I would 
                add that we re never so human as 
                when we act contrary to our 
                  instinct, and that monogamy - with 
                the right person, is a state of 
                higher evolution. 

  You can hear a pin drop.  AARON crosses to the girls  side.

                              AARON
                I m with the new chick.

  He sits down amidst LAUGHTER.  ANGLE ON Smash, his eyes 
  lazored on Waverly.  The BELL RINGS. 


  Smash motors down the hall, avoiding students like he does 
  tacklers.  Finally, he catches up to -- WAVERLY.

                              SMASH
                Hey!

  Waverly stops.  Waits.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      20.

                Thanks.

                              SMASH
                So how about we hang after school?  
                Just you and me, some deep 
                  conversation, know what I m saying?

                              WAVERLY
                I do.  But I ll pass.

  She starts back down the hall.

                              SMASH
                Pass?  Pass on the Smash?

  Smash feigns indignity, but his usual charm ain t working.  
  Waverly keeps walking.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                I don t give up, baby.  I don t 
                quit.  Embrace the Smash!

  Smash FOLLOWS HER THROUGH A DOOR.  We HEAR A SCREAM, then 
  Smash jumps back out.  OFF Smash, realizing he just followed 
  Waverly into the girl s room...


  LANDRY stands behind TYRA in the food line.  Staring.

  OFF Landry, debating whether to tell her his fantasy...

  FIND Lyla, sitting by herself, pretending to read a magazine, 
  trying to block out the leper stares she s getting from the 
  other students.  Suddenly, TWO BOYS sit with her.

                              LYLA
                Oh, God!  You guys scared me.

                that Lyla Garrity is not easy to 
                scare.  What we re saying is, we 
                think what you did - sleeping with 
                both Jason and Tim - was bold.

                What was that about?

  Lyla shakes her head.  Chokes back a sob.  Tim reaches under

  FIND TYRA, in line.  Watching Tim holding Lyla s hand.

  BACK TO Lyla and Tim.  Lyla realizes everyone in the 
  cafeteria is watching.  She pulls her hand away.

                Leave me alone!  Can t you see that

                me.  Don t you get it?

                Who cares about what everyone sees? 
                This is about us.

                              LYLA
                There is no us!  There never was!!  
                Get this straight Tim - we were a 
                one night stand.  A mistake.  I 
                love Jason.

  OFF Tim, like he was punched in the gut...


  Buddy stares at Lyla s Myspace page.  A PICTURE of Lyla 
  appears with SLUT printed across.  OFF Buddy, heartbroken... 


  Lyla s alone in the gym, practicing backflips.  Backflip 
  after backflip after backflip.  Trying to numb the pain.


  CLOSE ON ice packs wrapped around Lyla s knees.  REVEAL Lyla, 
  in her underwear and bra.  Completely worn out.  Maria walks 
  over, wrapped in a towel.

                Miss Der wants to see you.


  Miss Der is viewing film of the squad s routine.  PICK UP 
  Lyla, entering.  Miss Der FREEZES the film.

                              MISS DER
                Look Lyla, this is difficult for 
                me.  I know how hard you ve worked 
                to get to this moment.  I know 
                you ve choreographed the squad s 
                routine, I know you ve spent 
                summers practicing, I know you ve 
                dreamt about this since you were a 
                little girl.  I also know how good 
                you are.  That s why I made you 
                captain.  But Lyla, you have to 
                think like a captain.  And that 
                means thinking of the team first.

                              LYLA
                What are you saying?

                              MISS DER
                I want you to consider stepping 
                down.  At least for this Saturday.  

                              LYLA
                Oh my God.  Is this because of what 
                I did with Tim?

                              MISS DER
                  I couldn t care less about that.  
                This is about winning, and the 
                health of your team.  Your focus is 
                for shit, Lyla, and that means 
                you re dangerous.  You know how 
                many girls get seriously hurt in

                I can get focused.

                              MISS DER
                I don t think you can.  Not for 
                  Saturday.  So consider it.  And 
                consider it as a captain, with your 
                  responsibility to your team.

  Miss Der unfreezes the film.  OFF Lyla, reflected in the

                Coach Taylor was your quarterback 
                coach in Pee Wee, correct?

  Jason nods.

                              CHRIS SABLE (CONT D)
                Coach Taylor is currently your 
                coach?

  Jason nods.

                              CHRIS SABLE (CONT D)
                And is it true that in the entire 
                time Coach Taylor has been your 
                coach, never once did he personally 
                instruct you on how to tackle?

                              JASON
                He was my quarterback coach.

                              CHRIS SABLE
                Just answer the question.  Please.  
                Did Coach Taylor ever instruct you 
                on how to tackle?

  Jason shakes his head.  He watches Sable jot notes.

                This is about blaming Coach, isn t 
                it?  

                              CHRIS SABLE
                It s not about blaming anyone.  
                It s about winning a lawsuit.  

                              JASON
                      (to his parents)
                I can t believe it.  You want me to 
                blame Coach?  He s been like, like 
                family.  Dad?

                Your dad and I have discussed this, 
                Jason.  We re united on this.

                We are not united.  Stop saying 
                we re united.  I think Jason s

                      (to Sable)
                You should probably go.

  Coach Taylor speaks to players, cheerleaders and students at

                I know what football means to 
                Dillon, and I m here to tell you 
                that Dillon s support is a key to 
                why we re successful.  This support 
                binds us together as a community 
                and as a team.  So it s with that 
                spirit that I welcome the 
                  cheerleaders to this pep rally.  
                Support those who support you!

                And may I add that if sharing the 
                  spotlight means sharing the stage 
                with Miss Der, well then I don t 
                mind sharing the stage at all.

                      (to himself)
                Oh, brother.  Uh, Miss Der...

  He hands Miss Der the mic.  Coach slinks into the shadows.

                              MISS DER
                  Assertion is the key to success.  
                Demand what you deserve.  I know 
                the football team deserves victory 
                Friday night.  I know how hard 
                Coach Taylor works the players, how 
                hard the players work themselves.  
                I m here to tell you the 
                  cheerleading squad will demand 
                victory on Saturday as well.  A 
                victory that will lead to 
                  nationals! 

  CHEERS from the cheerleaders.

                Dillon High has never had dual 
                  championship teams before.  Dillon 
                High is about to!!

  The gym ROCKS OUT.  Drums beat, feet stomp.  Students dance.  
  Several football players deliver cookies to the cheerleaders, 
  a reverse kind of Rally Girl.  FIND Tim Riggins scanning the 
  crowd, looking for Lyla.  But she s not there.  

                                                                          CUT TO:


  Lyla walks down the hall.  A RELIGIOUS STUDENT remarks --

                              STUDENT
                How come you missed the rally?

                              LYLA
                Just didn t feel up to it.

                              STUDENT
                It s your guilt.  You re paying for 
                your sin.

                              TAMI (O.S.)
                You re gonna pay for your sin with 
                a foot up your ass.

  PICK UP Tami storming over, glaring.  The student leaves. 

                              LYLA
                When is this going to stop?

                              TAMI
                Don t worry about those jackasses, 
                sweetie.

  ON Lyla, it s clear that she is worrying.  Tami puts her arm 
  around her.  WE FOLLOW as they walk down the hall...

                              TAMI (CONT D)
                Everyone makes mistakes.  As far as 
                feeling guilty and taking blame and 
                abuse - there comes a point you 
                just have to say screw  em.  No 
                matter what you did.  Get back to 
                living.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      32.

                The problem is I think maybe 
                everyone is right.  Maybe I am a 
                bad person.  I don t know how Jason 
                can ever forgive me.

                              TAMI
                You are not a bad person.  You made 
                  a mistake, period.  And if you want 
                Jason to forgive you, you have to 
                forgive yourself first.

                              LYLA
                But what I did is really sinful.  
                In a Biblical way.

                              TAMI
                Honey, God created sin so that we 
                might know her mercy. 

                                                                          CUT TO:


  TIGHT on a NEEDLE, a VIAL.  The needle is drawn, INJECTED...

  ANGLE ON Smash.  Getting good at this.


    Pre-dinner prep.  Sauces sizzle, steam spews.  CORRINA is 
  chopping carrots.  Smash peeks into her gumbo.  

                              CORRINA
                What you looking at, boy?

                              SMASH
                Did you put those onions inside?  
                You know, those fancy ones.

                              CORRINA
                Vidalia onions?  Yeah, they re in.  
                You re acting strange, Brian.  And 
                I still don t understand why this 
                dinner had to happen all of a 
                sudden.

                              SMASH
                Just a little give back, mom.  The 
                  Reverend s been good to us, it s 
                our turn.  That s all.

  ON Corrina, she doesn t buy it.  SHEILA enters.

                                SHEILA
                It s his daughter.  Waverly.  She s 
                back at school.

                              SMASH
                It is not Waverly.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      34.

                              CORRINA
                Waverly.  Now that makes sense.  I 
                heard she was coming back.  Does 
                she interest you, Brian?

                              SMASH
                All girls interest me.

                              CORRINA
                Maybe.  But I don t often see you 
                chasing them.

                              SMASH
                The Smash don t chase.  They come 
                to me.

  Corrina swats Smash in the head.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                Hey!  Uh, one more thing...

                              CORRINA
                Another ingredient I m missing?

                              SMASH
                Your blouse.  Could you change it?  
                Put on that blue one I like.

  OFF Corrina, threatening Smash with a serving spoon --

  The DOORBELL RINGS.  Smash opens the door.  REVEAL Reverend 
  Grady and Waverly.

                              REVEREND GRADY
                Hello, Brian.  Well hello, Corrina.

  The Reverend enters, hugs Corrina.  FIND Waverly in the 
  doorway, looking at Smash like he s pathetic.

                              WAVERLY
                Having your mother cook dinner.  
                That s low.

                              SMASH
                        (defensive)
                I cooked some, too.

                              WAVERLY
                Yeah, I bet.  Okay, score one for 
                you.  But it s early in the game.                                                                                      35.




  The dining table is full of food.  

                              REVEREND GRADY
                  Everything tastes wonderful.  I m 
                very impressed, Corrina.

                              CORRINA
                Don t be.  If Brian had given me a 
                little more warning --

  FIND Smash, silently begging his mother.  Corrina LAUGHS.

                              CORRINA (CONT D)
                  Actually, when I heard Waverly was 
                back at school, it gave me the 
                excuse I was looking for.  

                              WAVERLY
                Thank you, Mrs. Williams.

                              CORRINA
                You re welcome.  And welcome home.  
                You were in Ghana, right?

                              WAVERLY
                That s right.

                              CORRINA
                With a missionary?

  Waverly nods uncomfortably.

                              WAVERLY
                  Purifying. 

                              REVEREND GRADY
                        (laughs)
                  Purifying water and building homes.  
                Real important work.  Say, Brian, 
                Waverly is going to take an SAT 
                course.  Maybe you could advise 
                her?

                              SMASH
                Uh.  Sure.  Love to.

                                SHEILA
                Didn t your course end last Friday?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      36.

                              SMASH
                  I extended it.  Extra lessons.

  He smiles at Sheila.  She sarcastically smiles back.

                              CORRINA
                Extra lessons can t hurt.  Playing 
                  football s not forever, but an 
                  education - that stays.

                              REVEREND GRADY
                Amen, sister.

                              SMASH
                  Football s staying for me, mom.

                              CORRINA
                I hope so.  But I ll be a very 
                proud mom when my boy gets his 
                college degree.  

                              SMASH
                And I ll be a very proud son.

  Corrina smiles.  OFF Waverly, cocking her head.  Skeptical.  


  Coach, Tami, Julie and Matt Saracen eat dinner.  No one says 
  a word.  Extremely awkward.

                              JULIE
                Okay, that s enough.  TV time.

  Julie stands, motions to Saracen. 

                              SARACEN
                Thank you, ma am.  Dinner was 
                really good.

  Tami smiles.  Julie pulls Saracen away.  OFF Coach, not even 
  knowing what to think...


  Smash washes dishes.  Waverly dries.

                              SMASH
                You coming to the game Friday 
                night?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      37.

    CONTINUED:


                              WAVERLY
                Why?  You going to trick me into it 
                if I say no?

                              SMASH
                Maybe.  See, Smash don t accept no.  

                              WAVERLY
                You ll have to this time.  And 
                what s with you calling yourself 
                 the Smash ?  You always talk in 
                the third person?

                              SMASH
                The Smash stands for me, my mom, 
                and my sisters.  When I succeed, we 
                all succeed.  Team Smash. 
                      (beat)
                Forget the game.  Would you go out 
                with me after?  Please.

  Waverly smiles.  Walks out of the room.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                What?!  What was that?  Don t think 
                it s over, girl.  The Smash don t 
                quit.  The Smash don t lose.  You 
                know what makes a champion a 
                  champion?  The refusal to lose.  
                That s why I m a champion.  I 
                refuse to quit.


  Julie and Saracen sit on the couch watching  The Office.   
  Saracen s arm is on the back of the couch, inches from 
  Julie s shoulder.  Julie laughs at something on the TV, and 
  Saracen laughs, too, but the truth is that Saracen s arm 
  aches and all he s thinking about is putting his arm around 
  her.  PRELAP...

                                TAYLOR (V.O.)
                Why the hell is he still here?


  Coach stares down the steps.  Tami is inside the room.

                              TAMI
                Relax.  




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      38.

    CONTINUED:


                                TAYLOR
                If she gets pregnant, we ll be 
                raising another child.  You realize 
                that?

                              TAMI
                Re-lax.  Isn t that what you told 
                me?  To calm down.

                                TAYLOR
                Yeah, but Saracen s changing.  
                Being starting quarterback on a 
                winning team will do that.  He s 
                getting that swagger.

                              TAMI
                  I remember when you had that 
                swagger.  God, it was like 
                  yesterday that we were their age.  
                Now we re the guardians.  Yikes.

                                TAYLOR
                You feeling old?

                              TAMI
                Not when I m with you.

  They kiss.  Tami pulls him inside, the years peeling away as 
  they kiss with more urgency.  Suddenly, Coach breaks away --  

                                TAYLOR
                He s all over her.  I can smell it.

  And before Tami can react, Coach BURSTS out the door...


  Matt s arm is just about on Julie s shoulder.  He lowers it, 
  lowers it, working by millimeter.  Finally he makes contact.  
  Freezes for a reaction.  But Julie seems cool, so he settles 
  in.  Julie snuggles to Saracen and pulls a blanket around 
  them.   

  BAM!  The door opens.  REVEAL Coach.

                                TAYLOR
                Party s over!

  Saracen bolts up.  Julie stares at her dad in horror.  Coach 
  realizes he just made a big mistake.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      39.

                Uh, I mean, it s getting late.  
                Don t you have a game?

                              SARACEN
                Yes, sir.

                                TAYLOR
                Well, finish up.  

  ON Julie, pissed, but Coach is still reluctant to leave.  He 
  snatches the blanket covering Julie and Saracen.

                                TAYLOR (CONT D)
                That s my blanket!  I was looking 
                for it.  Gets cold upstairs.

  OFF Julie, swearing never to bring home another date...


  Jason strums a guitar, or rather is trying to.  His 
    coordination is for shit, and he s frustrated.  A FLY buzzes 
  Jason s head, in and out.  Jason tries to swat it, but misses 
  by a mile.  The fly dive bombs again, Jason a sitting target.  
  Jason SPINS his wheelchair, desperate to get away.

                              JASON
                Get off me!

  He stops.  REVEAL TIM RIGGINS watching from the other side of 
  the screen door.

                              RIGGINS
                Hi.

  BACK TO Jason: he just stares.

                              RIGGINS (CONT D)
                Can I come in?  I ve got to tell 
                you something.

  Jason slowly nods.  Tim hesitates.  

                              RIGGINS (CONT D)
                You gonna hit me again?

                              JASON
                I might.  
                      (beat, then)
                What do you have to tell me?




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      40.

  Tim cautiously enters.

                              RIGGINS
                It s about Lyla.

                              JASON
                That s a bad subject.

                              RIGGINS
                I know, and man, I m really sorry.  
                I  m not making excuses or nothing, 
                it s just that Lyla -
                      (takes a breath)
                She loves you.  She s always loved 
                you.  Was never any question about 
                that.

                              JASON
                Odd how she slept with you when she 
                loves me so much.

                              RIGGINS
                It was never about me.  She just - 
                freaked.  And I guess I m the one 
                to blame.  I took advantage.

  OFF Jason, not sure what to make of this.

                              JASON
                Fine.  You told me.  See you 
                 round.

                              RIGGINS
                Yeah.  I guess.

  Tim stands.  THE FLY circles the room, then BUZZES Jason.  
  Jason shakes his head in frustration, but the fly refuses to 
  leave, as if the fly knows Jason s limits by now.

  WHAP!  Tim nails the fly with a rolled up magazine.

                              JASON
                Oh, man.  You smooshed it against 
                our team photo.

  CLOSE ON smudge across the Panther team photo.

                              RIGGINS
                Sorry.

  They both LAUGH.  Tim glances around the room.

                              JASON
                Hells, yeah.

                              RIGGINS
                It s like a museum.  

                              JASON
                The Jason Street pre-paralyzed 
                museum.  Wheelchair accessible.

                              RIGGINS
                You charge admission?

                              JASON
                  I should.  I am a big financial 
                drain, you know.
                      (then)
                Would you do me a favor?  Help me 
                get this shit down.  I think I need 
                a new hobby.

  Tim nods.  Lifts a trophy.

                              RIGGINS
                Hey, this is mine.

                              JASON
                What are you talking about?

                              RIGGINS
                This was for first place in the 
                run, pass and kick contest.  I 
                think we were ten.  I beat you.

                              JASON
                I don t think so.

                              RIGGINS
                I know so.  Was the only time I 
                won.

                              JASON
                If you won, why do I have the 
                trophy?

  Pam Garrity, her big hair perfectly coiffed and dressed sharp 
  in a suit and heels, talks to Tami.  Tami is in jeans.  She s 
  got her hair in a ponytail.

                              TAMI
                You want Lyla s transcripts?

                              PAM
                That s right.  We re placing her in 
                the Hawthorne Academy for Girls.  
                It s a good school.

                              TAMI
                The best all-girl school in Texas.  
                But why?  Because of what happened 
                with Tim Riggins?

  Pam clearly doesn t want to talk about it. 

                              TAMI (CONT D)
                Pam, this is 2006.  Don t send Lyla 
                to a nunnery.  Don t buy into such 
                a double standard.  No one s 
                hassling Tim Riggins; why make Lyla 
                take the fall?

                              PAM
                Don t play ideologist for me, okay?  
                I didn t make the world, but I know 
                that God did, and that God s a man.  
                The world is different for girls.

                              TAMI
                Not if we fight that thought.

                              PAM
                Let some other girl s mother fight 
                that fight.  I for one will not 
                stand by and let my baby be called 
                a slut every day  til she 
                  graduates.  She s already been 
                  pressured to quit the cheerleading 
                squad.

                              TAMI
                But that s my point.  Let her 
                  cheerlead, tell her not to quit.  




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      43.

                              PAM
                You think I don t want her to 
                  cheerlead?  Who do you think has 
                driven Lyla all over Texas for the 
                greater part of her life in pursuit 
                of this dream?  Do you know how big 
                Texas is?

                              TAMI
                Big.

                              PAM
                Very big.  

                              TAMI
                I know you re doing what you think 
                is right.  It s just, well, I think 
                Lyla s really special.  I think 
                you re underestimating her.  She s 
                so much more than a cheerleader.

                              PAM
                Watch your words, honey.  I know 
                you think cheerleading is silly, 
                but if you really knew Lyla, you d 
                know it s everything to her.  It 
                makes her part of something.  Lyla 
                likes to be liked.  Now, can I 
                please have the transcripts?

  Tami pulls out a file.

                              TAMI
                The need to be liked - the female 
                disease.  I say it s time for women 
                to stop being so nice and time for 
                us to rule the world.  Maybe then 
                we d get things accomplished.

                              PAM
                Please.  Tami Taylor, you talk 
                feisty feminism, but if I recall 
                  correctly you dropped everything in 
                your world to become a part of 
                Eric s.  You put aside your 
                  impressive education and had his 
                baby.  Truth is, you re no 
                  different than anyone else  round 
                here.

  OFF Tami, stabbed with some truth...                                                                                      44.




  Coach is backstage with Julie after her dance recital.  Julie 
  is in a leotard.

                                TAYLOR
                I m sorry about last night.  I 
                know, I m an idiot.  But Julie, 
                it s just, just - I know you re 
                maturing into a beautiful young 
                lady, but to me you re my little 
                girl, and I just go primal.  

                              JULIE
                Because of Matt?

                                TAYLOR
                Because of guys in general.  
                Jesus...

  ANGLE ON OTHER DANCERS parading by, all in leotards, all in 
  the blossoming stage of adolescence.  Julie gives him a kiss.

                              JULIE
                Thanks, dad.  I appreciate that.  
                I m proud of how you re maturing, 
                too.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                And this is the defensive playbook 
                of the Texas Longhorns.  Know them 
                by Monday.

                              SARACEN
                Monday?

  CLOSE ON a pile of playbooks.  A foot high. 

                                TAYLOR
                Yeah, I know it s a lot, but you 
                got to get it done.

                              SARACEN
                I... had plans.

  ON Coach, he doesn t want to hear about it.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                      45.

                With your daughter.  Is that what 
                this is about, sir?  With all due 
                respect.

  Coach gets in Saracen s face.

                                TAYLOR
                With all due respect, you and I 
                have to keep my daughter out of 
                this.  But hear this: I love my 
                  daughter, and I am a man, and I was 
                once a boy.  Understood?

                              SARACEN
                Yes, sir.

  Coach backs away.

                                TAYLOR
                But this is about football.  About 
                the Panthers winning State.  I m 
                not treating you any differently 
                then I would any starting 
                  quarterback.  Glory comes with a 
                price, son.  Memorize those plays. 

  OFF Saracen s look...


  Lyla s at the dining room table with her parents, a brochure 
  for the Hawthorne Academy for Girls spread open on the table.

                              PAM
                This isn t punishment.  This is the 
                best education you can get, without 
                all these small town distractions.  
                They have a cheerleading squad.

                              LYLA
                An all-girl school?

                              BUDDY
                I hear those are wildest.

                              LYLA
                Dad?  You want to send me away 
                because of what I did?  Dad?

  FIND Buddy, he can t look her in the eye.

                up in a - well, I might as well say 
                it, you re all grown up - she ended 
                up in a three-way with two boys.  

  Lyla does not want to hear about three-ways from her mother.

                              PAM (CONT D)
                The boys become heroes, and Marion?  
                We all made her life a living hell.  
                Even me.  Every day she slouched 
                lower in her seat, looked a little 
                more dead behind the eyes.  

                              LYLA
                I don t want to leave.  The 
                  tournament is Saturday.

                              PAM
                You said Miss Der asked you to step 
                down.

                              LYLA
                She told me to consider it.

                              PAM
                You should step down.  Honey, it s 
                best for everyone.

                              LYLA
                I don t want to quit cheerleading.  
                It s all I ve got now.  

  ON Lyla as she stands, tears rolling.

                              LYLA (CONT D)
                And I don t want to go to another 
                school.  If I embarrass you too 
                much, then, then I ll move out.  
                You won t have to worry.

                              BUDDY
                Baby!

  But Lyla is out the front door.

                                                                          CUT TO:                                                                                      47.




  The Reverend is inside the room.  Waverly rolls her eyes.

  Waverly LAUGHS.  She loves her dad.


  A PLAYER tapes his foot.  ANOTHER tightens his cleats.  The

  STAY WITH THEM as Smash and Waverly stroll down a street.  
  Smash nods to congratulatory fans.

                Hey, look at that, the Reverend s 
                daughter has a tattoo...

  Smash peels Waverly s collar back from her shoulder.  REVEAL 
  a tattoo of an ancient symbol.

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                Cool.  What s it mean?

                Does the tattoo excite you?  Or 
                does dating the Reverend s daughter

                              SMASH
                You excite me.

  Smash feels the moment, leans in, but Waverly leans back.  
  Not so fast.  

                              SMASH (CONT D)
                Yeah, you re different.  That s 
                cool.  Lots of rumors  bout why you 
                left school, but I know it must 
                have been for a good reason.  
                Ghana, huh?  What do they speak 
                there, Ghananese?

  Smash laughs, but Waverly doesn t answer.

                It s not an expression they use.

                              SMASH
                That doesn t sound like a friendly 
                people.  But they seemed pretty 
                friendly at the World Cup.  Was 
                being there during World Cup cool?

                              WAVERLY
                It was no big deal.

                              SMASH
                No big deal!  I heard there were 
                parties in the street when they 
                made the quarterfinals.  You sure 
                you were in Ghana?

  Waverly s eyes widen.  But it s not Smash s words that have 
  shocked her - his nose is BLEEDING.  Gushing down his face.

                I made a mistake.  By far the worst 
                mistake of my life, in fact, when 
                you think about it, aside from the 
                time I stole a lipstick in the 
                seventh grade at Walmart it was 
                  practically my only mistake.  I 
                admit it was a big one, but there 
                is no manual on how to act when 
                your boyfriend becomes paralyzed.  
                This is hard for me, too.

                              JASON
                You need a manual to tell you that 
                sleeping with your boyfriend s best 
                friend isn t cool?  I don t think 
                so.

  Lyla cries.  Jason is crying, too.

                              LYLA
                I wish you could.  I ll never stop

                star quarterback, and not the 
                  paraplegic, but you, Jason Street.  
                And I miss you.  I miss my best 
                friend.  I d do anything to win you 
                back.  You re all I ever wanted.

                              BUDDY
                That they were.  Listen, I know 
                you ve been Jason Street s coach 
                for years, and that you re Tim 
                Riggins  coach, and how close you 
                all are.  And I just want to say 
                I m sorry for this whole mess with 
                Lyla.  I m really sorry.

  A beat.

                I may be their coach, but I m 
                Julie s father.  I understand 
                having a teen daughter.  I think 
                the hardest part is accepting that 
                our girls, are girls.  On the 
                  fasttrack to becoming ladies.

  OFF Buddy, touched...                                                                                      57.




  The cheerleaders, in various stages of dress, ready 
  themselves.  Legs are taped, limbs stretched.  Also hair 
  spray and make-up applied.  Being pretty does scores points.

  PICK UP Lyla as she enters.  Silence. 

                              LYLA
                I m here to compete.  To win.  I 
                want in, and I swear I m ready.  I 
                swear I ll be focused.  But, if I 
                don t have your support, if I don t 
                have your faith - I won t do it.  

  Lyla looks at Miss Der, then at the girls.  OFF the girls...                                                                                        58.
