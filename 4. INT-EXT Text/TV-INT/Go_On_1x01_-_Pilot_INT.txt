      Ryan King (a boyish 40) bursts in, full of energy.  He s met 
      by his boss, STEVEN (40s, athletic), and dowdy IRIS from H.R.

                                  RYAN
                    I m back.  And better than ever.

                                  STEVEN
                    Ryan.  How are you, buddy?

                                  RYAN
                    Better than ever.  And back.  Don t 
                    think I could have made that any 
                    clearer.

      He hugs Steven.

                                  STEVEN
                    I m surprised you called.  You re 
                    supposed to be gone another month.

                                  RYAN
                    No need.  What a trip!  I zip-lined 
                    down a rainforest canopy, I surfed, 
                    swam with dolphins.  And that laid-
                    back vibe!  The place changed me.  
                    I, myself, still don t care for the 
                    guy, but after that week, I feel I 
                    could talk to someone who knows 
                    someone who likes Jimmy Buffett.
                          (then)
                    Ooh, I almost forgot.  I brought 
                    you something.

      He digs in his bag and holds something up to Steven s face.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Look familiar?

                                  STEVEN
                    It s a shell.

                                  RYAN
                    It s you.  I was SCUBA diving -- I 
                    did that too -- I m about to 
                    surface, two breaths in my tank and 
                    I see this on the ocean floor.  
                    Something about it said,  Steven .

                                  RYAN (CONT'D)
                    It captured your spirit.  There I 
                    was, thousands of miles away, in 
                    this intense, beautiful moment and 
                    you were there.   I m gonna get 
                    that shell and bring it to my 
                    friend,  I said.   That s how much 
                    he means to me. 

      He hands Steven the shell.  Then we hear O.C. SOBBING.  Iris 
      is breaking down.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                          (to Iris)
                    You want one?  I have a hundred, I 
                    bought it in the airport gift shop.

                                  IRIS
                    I m sorry, you re just clearly in 
                    so much pain.

                                  RYAN
                    What?  I m great.
                          (to Steven)
                    And so ready to get back to work.

                                  STEVEN
                    You re not great.  How could you 
                    be?  It s been just a month.

                                  RYAN
                    Of SCUBA diving, of zip-lining... 
                    and did I mention the dolphins?

                                  STEVEN
                    What about Janie?
                          (gently)
                    You remember Janie, right?

      A beat.

                                  RYAN
                    Sure, about yea high, completed me?  
                    Doesn t come around much anymore?

                                  STEVEN
                    Your wife died, Ryan.  Out of 
                    nowhere.  You re not okay, how 
                    could you be?  You haven t dealt 
                    with it at all.  

      Ryan shakes his head.  GO ON "PILOT" 3.
   1/17/12

                                  STEVEN (CONT D)
                    Okay, I know you want to come back, 
                    and I miss you, the station misses 
                    you, but there s something you have 
                    to do first.  Iris has put together 
                    a list of people you can talk to.

                                  RYAN
                    Therapy?  No.  It s not in my 
                    blood.  I go see a shrink, my dad 
                    will roll in his grave.  At least I 
                    think he s dead.  We didn t talk 
                    about that kind of stuff.  It s 
                    very personal.
                          (then)
                    Look, I m not gonna lie, I have my 
                    bad days, that s why I m here.  
                    This where I feel like myself.  
                    This is what I need.

                                  STEVEN
                    I want you back too.  When you re 
                    ready.  Choose anyone on the list, 
                    go to ten sessions.

                                  RYAN
                          (beat)
                    You asking as my friend or my boss?

                                  STEVEN
                    I m asking as your friend and 
                    telling you as your boss.  It s not 
                      a discussion.

      He holds out the packet.  Beat.  Pissed, Ryan grabs it.

                                  STEVEN (CONT D)
                    Be open.  You might get something 
                    out of it.

      Ryan turns to go, then crosses back and grabs something: the 
      little, pink Steven shell.  Ryan studies it.

                                  RYAN
                    Funny.  It doesn t look all that 
                    much like you anymore.

      Ryan pockets the shell and exits.


      A small anteroom.  Ryan s assistant, CARRIE (20s, quirky; 
      think Mary-Lynn Rajskub) sits behind a desk.  Ryan blows in.   GO ON "PILOT" 4.
   1/17/12

                                  RYAN
                    Okay, remember when I had you do my 
                    traffic school online for me?

                                  CARRIE
                          (looks around, nervous)
                    No.  That would have been fraud.

                                  RYAN
                    Well, I have some more nonsense you 
                    need to help me deal with.

      He dumps the packet in front of her.

                                  CARRIE
                    Nice to see you, by the way.

                                  RYAN
                    That s it?  No,  I m sorry ?  No 
                       heyyyyy ?  Bless you.

                                  CARRIE
                          (off packet)
                    What is this?  Therapy?

                                  RYAN
                    Ten sessions, I have to do.  I have 
                    to get this stupid sheet signed.  
                    Ten hours talking about my 
                    feelings.  So you know what I need?

                                  CARRIE
                    Feelings?

                                  RYAN
                    Check out those places, find the 
                    easiest one.
                          (scoffs)
                    Therapy.  You want to help me?  Put 
                    me on the air, give me some 
                    callers, some athletes, let me make 
                    them yell at each other!  It s bad 
                    enough my wife died.  You gotta 
                    take away the thing I love to do?  
                    It s like,  Little Timmy, sorry 
                    Grandma s dead.  Now we re going to 
                    take away all your toys. 

                                  CARRIE
                    There are groups in here.  Do that.
                          (off his look)
                    You wouldn t have to say anything, 
                    there are a dozen other people.  GO ON "PILOT" 5.

                          (beat, considers)
                    You re right.  Other people love to 
                    talk.  I wouldn t be able to get a 
                    word in if I tried.  It s perfect!
                          (kisses her)
                    This is like when you did jury duty 
                    for me, which also didn t happen!

                    Oof!  Downer.

                                  CARRIE
                    So, you want one of the  fun  ones 
                    in this pile?  Perhaps a group on 
                    how to make balloon animals?
                          (looks)
                    Okay.  This one seems... lighter.

                          ( struggling )
                    Too much... psychobabble... 
                    can t... breathe...
                          (then)
                      Insufferable.  Pass.

                                  CARRIE
                    Too bad.  All the other ones are 
                    ninety minutes, this one s sixty --

                                  RYAN
                          (immediately)
                       Transitions,  it is!
                          (then)
                    Done!  Call, get me a reservation 
                    or whatever.  A nice table, nothing 
                    too close to the kitchen.
                          (heads out, then)
                    Ooh, maybe I ll sit in the back and 
                    listen to something.  Fill this up.

      He tosses her his iPod.

                                  CARRIE
                    With what?

      Ryan just laughs,  What else?   GO ON "PILOT" 6.

                    You ve heard them all a million 
                    times.


      Ryan bops down the hall.  He tucks a wire and adjusts the 
      headphones that are already in his ears.

      WE HEAR ONLY WHAT HE HEARS: a podcast of Ryan King s favorite 
      radio personality...

                                  RYAN (ON RADIO)
                    Welcome back to the Ryan King show, 
                    I am your host, Ryan King with a 
                    reminder that this is a  no B.S. 
                    zone.   It s not tolerated.  Except 
                    for me just calling it  B.S.,  
                    which, let s face it, is kinda B.S.-
                    y.  Still with me is Celtics star, 
                    Kevin Garnett.  K.G., thanks for 
                    sticking around.


      Ryan enters to find a group of MEN and WOMEN, aged TWENTY TO 
      SIXTY.  A true melting pot.  Ryan joins their circle.  As he 
      does, people offer Ryan words of welcome.  He nods politely, 
      not hearing.  We don t hear either.

                                  RYAN (ON RADIO)
                    Kev, you re the man.  Fourteen-time 
                    All-Star, World Champion, so here s 
                    the question: Who s the ugliest guy 
                    you ve ever played with?

      As Ryan continues to enjoy the show, others RISE AND CROSS 
      AWAY.  They OPEN A CLOSET and REMOVE ELABORATE COSTUMES.

                                  KEVIN GARNETT (ON RADIO)
                    Aw, come on, Ryan.  You re just 
                    trying to get me in trouble.

                                  RYAN (ON RADIO)
                    I want the top five, in order.  Not 
                    including Sam Cassell.  Too easy.

      Ryan realizes he s alone.  He turns around to see the group 
      now OUTFITTED in MEDIEVAL GARB.  WEAPONS AND ALL.  They start 
      to FIGHT, some odd STAGE COMBAT.  

      Ryan removes his earplugs, clears his throat.  GO ON "PILOT" 7.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    The, uh...  Transitions  group?

      A COSTUMED MAN points across the hall.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Thank you, my lord.


      Another GROUP, a DOZEN MEN AND WOMEN of ALL AGES, all walks 
      of life.  Ryan enters to find people making chit-chat.  He s 
      approached by a GOOD-LOOKING WOMAN of fifty.  This is JILL.

                                  JILL
                    Hi, there.  Welcome.

                                  RYAN
                    Hi.  Is this the group for, uh...

                                  JILL
                    Life change.

                          (smiles)
                    Life change, right.  So is it 
                    mainly people who just won the 
                    lottery or...?

      A GRUFF MAN (40) gets a call on his cell.  This is DON.

                          (into phone)
                    Yeah? ...  Uh huh.  ...  Okay.

      Skittish YOLANDA (30) approaches him.

                                    YOLANDA
                    Really not supposed to --
                          (mimes phone)
                    Sorry.  Lauren s rules?  Sorry.  
                    Lauren.  Not me.  Lauren.

                                  DON
                          (hangs up)
                    Everyone, that was Lauren.

      Yolanda is pulled up.  She checks her phone.

      A SLIGHTLY CREEPY MAN approaches Ryan and stares at him.  
      This is MR. K.  GO ON "PILOT" 8.

                                  DON (CONT D)
                    She s sorry, she s in traffic and 
                    will be here soon.  She encourages 
                    us to start without her.

      People grab seats around a circle.  As they do:

                                    YOLANDA
                          (very relieved)
                    Okay.  She called me.  It was just 
                    turned off.  Because of the rule.

      Ryan grabs a chair outside the circle.  Mr. K sits close by.  

                                  DON
                    Well, okay, how does she start?
                          (searching)
                    To live is to change...  we shall 
                    emerge like a butterfly... then she 
                    says a poem.  Let s go.

      Feisty ANNE (45) pipes up.

                                  ANNE
                          (flat)
                    That was really moving.

                                  DON
                    Well, she has candles.  You want me 
                    to make it nice?  Get me candles.

      To Ryan, outside the circle:

                                  JILL
                    Care to join us?

                                  RYAN
                    Oh, I m good here.  I m just 
                      observing.  Thanks.

                                    YOLANDA
                    Lauren says you have to sit in the 
                    circle.  Lauren says --

      From GEORGE, elderly, blind:

                                  GEORGE
                    He seems comfortable.

      Ryan motions,  so-so.   Mr. K has moved closer.    GO ON "PILOT" 9.
   1/17/12

                                  RYAN
                          (whispers)
                    Why do I think your  life change  
                    involves wearing a suit of other 
                    peoples  skin?

      Mr. K smiles.

                                  GEORGE
                    Let s dive in.  Who d like to 
                    start?  To my left?

      He turns to OWEN (20).  He just stares back, blank.

                                  DON
                    It s the kid, George.  He s not 
                    gonna say anything.

                                  ANNE
                    I ll start.
                          (big sigh)
                    I m not sleeping.  It s coming up 
                    on five months since Al s gone ---
                          (without turning)
                    Stop taking notes.  Now.

      Yolanda puts down her pen.

                                  ANNE (CONT D)
                    I miss his snore.  I hated that 
                    snore.  But I can t bring myself to 
                    sleep in our bed.  Five months on 
                    the couch.  My kids think I m nuts.

                                  SONIA
                    Hey, be happy you have family.  I 
                    wish I did.

                                  DON
                    And be happy you have a bed.  The 
                    bank took mine.  Did you know they 
                    did that?  Beds?  Seemed mean.

      Ryan perks up.  The competition piques his interest. 

                                  ANNE
                    Oh, you lost money.  You can always 
                    get that back.  Not like me.

                                  DON
                    Not just money.  My wife, my kid, 
                    my fish.  Saltwater, all purple and 
                    bright.  GO ON "PILOT" 10.
   1/17/12

                                    YOLANDA
                    Guys, stop.  You know Lauren says 
                    we shouldn t compare like this.

                                  RYAN
                          (can t help himself)
                    No, don t stop!

      They all turn to the new guy.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Sorry, it s just... that s the fun 
                    part.  Of course we re gonna 
                    compete.  We re humans, it s kind 
                    of our thing.  Whether it s sports, 
                    beauty pageants, chili cook-offs... 
                    We want to know who s the best.

                                    YOLANDA
                    Not about this kind of thing.

                                  RYAN
                      Especially about this kind of 
                    thing!  Are you kidding?  Have you 
                    ever sat with the old people --
                          (to George)
                    -- no offense -- at Thanksgiving?  
                    Have you ever heard a country song?  
                    There s a sick joy in knowing,  My 
                    bad thing squishes yours like a 
                    grape.   Be honest.  When you sit 
                    here, listening to someone else go 
                    on about their problems, a big part 
                    of you s thinking,  You think 
                    that s bad?  Oh, baby, wait  til 
                    you hear my thing.   Am I right?

      People look at each other, gauging reactions.

                                  DON
                    Listen, new guy, I don t know who 
                    you are.  But yes.

                                  RYAN
                    So who wins?  Everyone here s 
                    dealing with something.  Whose 
                    thing is the worst?

      They look around, sizing each other up.  GO ON "PILOT" 11.
   1/17/12

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Do you really not know?
                          (hops up)
                    Oh, we gotta figure this out.

                                  ANNE
                    What are you doing?

                                  GEORGE
                    We re gonna crown someone.  If you 
                    were weight lifters, you d lift 
                    stuff.  If you were runners, you d 
                    race.  You re sad!  Let s see who s 
                    saddest!

      He crosses, counting heads as he goes.

                                    YOLANDA
                    I really don t think Laur--

                                  RYAN
                    Oh, screw what Laura says.

      Ryan turns quickly and finds himself nose-to-nose with gentle 
      giant, war vet, DANNY (25).

                                  DANNY
                    It s Lauren.  And she s been 
                      instrumental in my healing journey.

                                  RYAN
                          (immediate 180)
                    Because she s a great, great woman, 
                    worthy of respect, and I won t have 
                    people talk about her that way.

      Danny backs off.  Ryan reaches a blackboard.  He draws an 
      NCAA TOURNAMENT-STYLE BRACKET SYSTEM.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Here are the brackets.  You ve all 
                    made it to the tournament.  
                      Congratulations.  
                          (with mounting intensity)
                    Now you re gonna go head to head, 
                    you get five seconds to tell me 
                    your sob story.  Make it sound as 
                    bad as you can.  We go a few 
                    rounds, crown a winner, and we know 
                    once and for all: who s number one?  
                    Who rules the land?  Are you in?

      People aren t sure.  The silent Owen raises his hand.  GO ON "PILOT" 12.

                                  OWEN
                    We could call it  March Sadness .

                                  RYAN
                    That s exactly what we re gonna 
                    call it!  I love this guy!
                          (to Owen)
                    You man the board.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Okay, we have an odd number of 
                    people.  Anyone okay to sit out?

                                  MR. K
                    I can.  I like to watch.

                                  RYAN
                    I m sure you do.

      BEGIN MONTAGE.  High-energy music plays.  

      Ryan sits.  IN QUICK CUTS, pairs take turns telling their 
      stories.  At the board, Owen writes down the results.  First 
      up, Jill faces off against Don.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Five seconds.  Go!

                                  DON
                    I lost everything I had on a 
                      restaurant whose concept I still 
                    cannot articulate.

      Ryan nods, points to Jill.

                                  JILL
                    Our youngest just moved off.  We re 
                    empty nesters now.  I m trying to 
                    figure out who I am.

                                  RYAN
                    So his thing s worse?

                                  JILL
                      I wouldn t say tha--

                                  RYAN
                    Then sell it!

      He counts down from five on his fingers.  GO ON "PILOT" 13.

                    Last week was my birthday!  None of 
                    them called!  Sometimes I dig out 
                    their baby clothes and smell them!

                                  RYAN

      Anne sees where this is going...

                    Oh no.  I can t lose to this.

                    Cy Matthews?  From USC?  You were 
                    the best PAC-12 receiver in twenty 
                    years.  You were going to the pros!  
                    You were gonna be huge!

                                  CYRUS
                    Know what, I m better than huge, 
                    I m blessed.  I ve got my family --

                                  RYAN
                          (can t bear to listen)
                    Aw, and I d heard you were nice 
                    about it.  That makes it so much 
                    worse!

      Ryan curls up in a ball, pained.  Yolanda pipes in.

                                    YOLANDA
                    So, I ll say my thing?

                                  RYAN
                          (head in hands, moans)
                    It doesn t matter.  His is worse, 
                    sit down.

      BACK TO George.  GO ON "PILOT" 15.
   1/17/12

                                  GEORGE
                    A stroke, three heart attacks...  


      NEXT UP, Danny vs. FAUSTA (60s).  Now people want to win.

                                  DANNY
                    -- I came back from deployment and 
                    there was my wife with the baby.

                                  RYAN
                    What s wrong with that?

                                  DANNY
                    I d been gone for ten months.

                                  RYAN
                          (does the math)
                    Got it.
                          (to Fausta)
                    Ma am?

                                  FAUSTA
                          (with deep emotion)
                    Mi marido enfermaba y volvi  al 
                    hospital y el y mi hijo fueron 
                    devueltos para mi pa s!

                                  RYAN
                          (no idea what she said)
                    Wow.  Someone who s gonna get less 
                    out of this group than I am.

      BACK TO George.

                                  GEORGE
                      Gallstones.  Colitis -- 

                                  RYAN
                            (interrupts)
                    Maybe just list the diseases you 
                    don t have.

      NEXT ROUND: Fausta and Cyrus face off.  Fausta s just gone.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Okay, if Don s Spanish is good -- 
                    and I have no reason to believe it 
                    is -- that s a heartbreaking story.
                          (to Cyrus)
                    I think you re out.  GO ON "PILOT" 16.
   1/17/12

                                  CYRUS
                    Hey, I had fun while it lasted.

                                  RYAN
                    Stop being nice.  Stop it.

      A LATER ROUND.  Ryan stands.  He s really getting into it 
      now.  It s George vs. Sonia.  George finishes up...

                                  GEORGE
                    My house burned down.  I lost a 
                    toe.  They put me in a home...

                                  RYAN
                    Two rounds and the fact that he s 
                    blind doesn t even come up.  How do 
                    you beat that?
                          (to Sonia)
                    I m sorry.  Your Cinderella story 
                    ends here.
                          (to George)
                    You re moving on!

      George pumps his fist.

      Finally, it s down to Fausta and George.  Both have spoken.  
      Ryan holds up Fausta s hand.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    We have a winner!

      Ryan spots an empty box of donuts.  He places it on Fausta s 
      head like a crown.

                                  FAUSTA
                    Yes!  Yes!
                          (in George s face)
                    I no care you problem!  I am queen!  
                    I win!  You lose!

      All eyes are now on the door, where stands an ATTRACTIVE and 
      shocked WOMAN.  Ryan is caught.  A tense beat, then:

                                  RYAN
                    Lauren, is it?  I have a sheet I m 
                    gonna need you to sign.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

   1/17/12

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      The group is seated in a circle, once again calm, thanks to 
      Lauren (40).  Think Lauren Graham.  She s wound tightly but 
      manages to keep her cool.  Usually.  Lauren lights the last 
      of her dozen candles, an opening ritual for the meeting.

                                  LAUREN
                          (super-calm voice)
                    We honor change of all kinds here.  
                    The blessings, the challenges...

      Her lighter dies.  She tries not to lose her shit as she 
      continues, futilely pressing the button again and again.

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    These flames, beautiful, powerful. 
                      Ever-changing --
                          (furious whisper)
                    Light.  Light.  Dammit.  Light.

      Another candle altogether flickers and dies.

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                      Seriously?  Come on!

      She tosses the lighter aside.  There s a tense beat.

                                  GEORGE
                          (whispers, lost)
                    What s going on?

                                  LAUREN
                    Sorry, I m still trying to process 
                    what I witnessed when I arrived.

                                  RYAN
                    Yeah, I should apologize for that.  
                    It was wrong.  Fun, definitely.  
                    But wrong.  Apparently.

                                  LAUREN
                    We try not to compare experiences 
                    here.  Why would we have that rule?

                                    YOLANDA
                    Because to do so would suggest that 
                    one person s experience is more or 
                    less valid than another s.  GO ON "PILOT" 18.
   1/17/12

                                  LAUREN
                    Thank you, Yolanda.  And Fausta, 
                    anytime you want to take that off --

      Fausta removes her crown.  Lauren turns to Ryan.

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Can you appreciate that, Ryan?  Why 
                    we would have that rule?

                                  RYAN
                          (beat)
                    Sure.

                                  LAUREN
                    Thank you, Ryan.  I honor that.

                                  RYAN
                    Thanks.  And thanks for saying my 
                    name so much.  It s weird but nice.

      She produces a stack of papers and passes them down.

                                  LAUREN
                    I d like to offer you some material 
                    to look over when you have time.

      The healthy-sized pile reaches Ryan.

                                  RYAN
                    Wow.  If I d known a wife dying 
                    meant so much reading, I wouldn t 
                    have married a 109-year-old.

      He laughs.  Lauren gives him a sad smile.

                                  LAUREN
                    It s important to laugh.  It s also 
                    important to cry, to dance, to sing --

                                    YOLANDA
                    To swim. 

                                  LAUREN
                    Less so.
                          (re: papers)
                    There are some rules in there.  
                      Guidelines, ways to keep our time 
                    together positive, affirming.  
                    They ll hopefully encourage you to 
                    open up and share of yourself.

   1/17/12

                                  LAUREN (CONT'D)
                    You ll get out of this group only 
                    as much as you re willing to put 
                    in.

      Chastised, Ryan gives a polite nod.  Then he subtly SLIPS HIS 
      HAND INTO HIS POCKET.  Lauren turns her focus to the others.

                                  LAUREN (CONT D)
                    Now, let s talk about this week.  
                    When last we met, Jill was --

      We again hear what Ryan hears: his podcast kicks back in.

                                  KEVIN GARNETT (ON RADIO)
                    ... I mean there are those who d 
                    say that I m not the most beautiful 
                    man who s ever taken the court.

                                  RYAN (ON RADIO)
                    That s insanity, K.G.  In fact, I d 
                    guess whatever planet you re from, 
                    you re the best looking one there. 

      Lauren goes on.  Ryan nods along with whatever s being said.

                                                                            CUT TO:

       A WEEK IN THE LIFE  MONTAGE

      UNDER MUSIC, we follow members of the group as they go about 
      their week, each on his or her own:

      Ryan, headphones in, jogs on the street.  Fast.

      Don in a pet store.  He stares longingly into a tank, at an 
      awesome, purple fish.

      Anne lays flowers at her husband s grave.  A quiet moment, 
      then she starts berating the ground.

      Ryan plays a friend in a heated game of racquetball.

      Fausta, at home alone, looks at a framed photo of her family.  
      She hangs her donut box  crown  on the photo and smiles. 

      Ryan cleans his house obsessively.  Keeping busy.  Very busy.

      Jill in her kitchen.  She makes a peanut butter and jelly 
      sandwich, cuts off the crusts, and throws it in the garbage.

      Anne, calmed, kisses her hand, then touches the gravestone.  
      She has one more angry outburst, then leaves.  GO ON "PILOT" 20.
   1/17/12


      It s the end of the night.  Ryan walks to the bed, but can t 
      bring himself to get in.


      He settles in on the couch.  He s miserable.

      END MONTAGE.


      Pairs sit together around the room.  Lauren walks around, 
        instructing.  She passes George with Danny, others...

                                  LAUREN
                    There s a wide variety of experience 
                    here.  Today, I d like to explore 
                    our commonality.  Now that you re 
                    paired up, I d like you to...

      As she continues, we ANGLE ON Ryan with the closed-off Owen.  
      They stare at each other, an uneasy silence.  Ryan leans in.

                                  RYAN
                          (whispers, chiding)
                    Please, Owen, she s talking.  Let 
                    someone else get a word in.

      Owen just continues to stare.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Look, I m just here to get my thing 
                    signed.  I m not gonna talk about 
                    this stuff either.  So if you want 
                    to speak, don t be afraid I m gonna 
                    make you go deep.

      Lauren approaches, finishing her instruction.

                                  LAUREN
                    Great, everyone.  Let s get to it.
                          (to Ryan)
                    Did you have time to look over the 
                    rules I shared with you last week?

                                  RYAN
                            (technically true)
                    I did have time to do that, yes.

      She smiles and crosses off, leaving the two guys.  Beat.  GO ON "PILOT" 21.
   1/17/12

                                  OWEN
                          (tentative)
                    What do you want to talk about?

      We PAN ACROSS the room.  Pairs are deep in discussion.  

      Jill sits with Mr. K.  She s being polite, but she s 
      uncomfortable.

                                  JILL
                    Um, Mr. K, no one else seems to be 
                    holding hands.

      He doesn t let go.  He just smiles.

      Meanwhile, Anne sits with upbeat Cyrus.

                                  CYRUS
                    One door closes, another opens.  
                    Say I had made it to the NFL.  I 
                    wouldn t have met you great people.

                                  ANNE
                    You re a f*****g idiot, you know 
                    that?

      BACK TO the guys.  Ryan wipes away tears of laughter.  They 
      watch the end of a video on the phone cupped in his hand.

                                  RYAN
                    Anything with a pet and a toilet I 
                    find very funny.  Is it just me?

                                  OWEN
                          (smiles)
                    It is just you, yes.

                                  RYAN
                    Okay, don t get us in trouble.  
                    Keep it sad.

                                  OWEN
                          (takes out phone)
                    Here s my favorite.  You know how 
                    you can type any address into 
                    Google and see a picture?  This 
                    special camera car drives around, 
                      photographing every street.

      For appearances, Ryan puts a hand on Owen s arm.  GO ON "PILOT" 22.

                          (with gravity)
                      I understand.

                                  OWEN
                    Well, sometimes when people see the 
                    car coming, they do weird stuff, 
                    and those pictures are permanently 
                    on the Google site.  Check it out.

      INSERT SHOT: a well-circulated internet image of two men in 
      SCUBA gear, chasing the car, pitchforks over their heads.

                                  OWEN (CONT D)
                    Two weirdos in Norway.  They were 
                    sitting there in SCUBA suits I 
                    guess.  They chased the thing down 
                    with pitchforks or whatever.

                                  RYAN
                    That s genius.

                                  OWEN
                    My brother sent me that.  It was, 
                    like, the day before his accident.
                          (beat)
                    My big brother.  Skiing.  He s in a 
                    coma.  But his brain s just gone.

      Ryan s at a loss.  Does he ask more?  A beat, then:

                                  RYAN
                          (fumbles with phone)
                    I ve got some other stuff.  Pretty 
                    funny...

                                  OWEN
                    Yeah, yeah.


      The group is back around the circle.  

                                  LAUREN
                    With the time that s left, I d like 
                    to hear from some of you.
                          (looks around)
                    Ryan?  What were your three words?

                                  RYAN
                    Excuse me?  GO ON "PILOT" 23.
   1/17/12

                                  LAUREN
                    Your three words.  The exercise.

                                  RYAN
                          (no idea)
                    My three.

                                  LAUREN
                    With Owen.

                                  RYAN
                    Our three.  Right.  About the thing 
                    you told us to... make them about.  
                    Okay.  Okay.
                          ( here goes nothing )
                    Well, the first word -- it s me and 
                    Owen, so it s obvious what that s 
                    gonna be.  I m not gonna waste your 
                    time with that one.  The second 
                    word, that might surprise you.  
                    It s  pineapple.   I d rather not 
                    say why.  The third --

                                  CYRUS
                    What are you talking about?

                                  RYAN
                          (immediately)
                    I have no idea.  Thank you for 
                    stopping me.
                          (to Lauren)
                    I didn t hear the assignment.

      Lauren lets out a frustrated sigh.

                                  LAUREN
                    Ryan, do you respect what we re 
                    doing here?

                                  RYAN
                    You know.  I mean... sure.
                          (off her look)
                    It doesn t matter what I think.

                                  LAUREN
                    But it does.  It s a safe space.  
                    Please.  Tell us your thoughts.

                                  RYAN
                    You re really gonna make me?
                          (sighs, then)
                    Okay, I think this is all kinda... 
                    dumb.

                    The talking, the wallowing, it s 
                      pointless.  It s worse.  It s bad.  
                    It keeps you from getting on with 
                    your life.  Look, the Boston Red 
                    Sox hadn t won a championship in 
                      eighty-six years.  People spent 
                    their whole lives obsessing over 
                    the last season, moaning about a 
                    curse.  By 2004 they figured it 
                    out.  They didn t need to wallow, 
                    they needed to hire Theo Epstein 
                    and take a bunch of steroids and 
                    win!
                          (to others)
                    You guys should go do something.  
                    Anne, you re a cool and very angry 
                    lady.  Does all the talking help?  
                    Why not try boxing?  When s the 
                    last time you hit someone?

                                  ANNE
                          (wistful)
                    It s been a while.

                                  RYAN
                    Jill, you talk about all the time 
                    you have now.  Is the group helping 
                    you figure out how to use it?  

                                  JILL
                    Don let me do a bunch of his 
                    laundry for him.  That was nice.

                                  RYAN
                    Danny, you got screwed over.  
                    You re a great-looking guy.  When s 
                    the last time you had sex with a 
                    woman?

                                  MR. K
                          (to Danny, too interested)
                    And was she by any chance black?

                                  RYAN
                          (quickly)
                    Don t help me.  Just don t.
                          (then)
                    I m just saying... go do something.

      A beat.  Lauren smiles.  GO ON "PILOT" 25.
   1/17/12

                                  LAUREN
                    And with that, we should all go do 
                      something.  Our session is over.  
                    See you next week.  Be well.


      People disperse.  A contrite Ryan approaches Lauren.

                                  RYAN
                    Listen, I m sorry if --

                                  LAUREN
                    Please don t apologize.  I 
                      appreciate your candor.

                                  RYAN
                    Okay.  Great.

      He holds out his sheet to be signed.  Beat.

                                  LAUREN
                    I m afraid I can t sign that.

                                  RYAN
                    Excuse me?

                                  LAUREN
                    Well, this document says you re to 
                      participate in ten sessions.  I 
                    can t in good conscience say you 
                      participated in any real way today.

      She smiles.  Beat.

                                  RYAN
                          (playful)
                    Ah, I see.  Gotta show me who s 
                    boss.  Little mad I challenged you.

                                  LAUREN
                    No, I m mad because -- 
                          (catches self)
                    I am not mad.  I just wish you d 
                    let me give you the help you need.  
                    Maybe next week.

      She exits.


      Lauren gets in.  So does Ryan.

                                  LAUREN
                    Excuse me.

                                  RYAN
                    What exactly qualifies you to tell 
                    anyone anything?

                                  LAUREN
                          (getting defensive)
                    I have expertise.  I ve been 
                    involved in outreach and self-
                      realization for almost a decade.

                                  RYAN
                    Wow.  That sentence sounds almost 
                    as meaningless as,  Transitions: a 
                    Group for Mindful Life Change and 
                    Renewal of the Journey Cycle to -- 

                                  LAUREN
                    Stop adding things!
                          (then)
                    I have led groups, helped thousands 
                    of people.  In a well-renowned 
                      international outreach program! 

                                  RYAN
                          (smells a rat)
                      Called...?
                          (off her non-response)
                    Lauren?

      She doesn t meet his glance.  She mumbles.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  LAUREN
                          (small)
                    Weight.  Watchers.

      He stares at her for a beat.  Then he notices something at 
      his feet in the car.  He picks it up.  It s a scale.  GO ON "PILOT" 28.
   1/17/12

                                  RYAN
                      Seriously?  
                          (then)
                    So this is the person who s going 
                    to tell me how to get through my 
                    loss.  You have no training and the 
                    only thing you, yourself, have ever 
                    lost is thirty pounds!

                                  LAUREN
                          (snaps)
                    Forty pounds!  And I kept it off!
                          (then)
                    And I helped other people do it 
                    too.  They flew me places to give 
                    talks; I was consulted when the 
                    points system changed.   No points 
                    for fruit ?  That was me!  But I 
                    wanted to spread my wings, to help 
                    all kinds of people.  Now I do.  I 
                    read people, I know what they need.
                          (losing it)
                    I m great with people!  I have a 
                    gift!

                                  RYAN
                    Yeah, you ve done wonders with the 
                    kid with the brother in a coma.
                          (off her confused look)
                    The kid.  With the brother in the 
                    ski accident.

      Lauren is taken aback.

                                  LAUREN
                    Owen?  He talked to you about that?  
                    He s been coming for two months, he 
                    hasn t said a thing.

                                  RYAN
                    Huh.  Has he lost any weight?

                                  LAUREN
                    He reached out to you, Ryan.  Be a 
                    part of this group.  Participate.  
                    You can heal yourself, and you can 
                    help a boy who really needs it.  
                    Would you consider that, Ryan?  
                    Would you please consider that?

      A beat.  He takes it all in.  GO ON "PILOT" 29.

                          (re: glove compartment)
                    If I open this right now, will I 
                    find a candy bar?

                                  LAUREN
                    How can you be so sure it won t 
                    help?  You haven t tried, you 
                    haven t said anything.  I don t 
                    know your wife s name, how you lost 
                    her, how you met -- 

      Ryan s at the end of his rope.

                                  RYAN
                    Look, you need me to talk?  Fine!

                    I met her when I was nine, she was 
                    six.  My best friend, Paul, great 
                    kid, had like, ten Stormtroopers, 
                    she was his kid sister.  A real 
                    pest.  I changed schools, I didn t 
                    see her for ten years.  Junior year 
                    of college, I get a call.   Hey, 
                    it s Paul s sister.   Great.  I ve 
                    gotta meet this pain in the ass for 
                    coffee.  I do.
                          (looks off, reliving it)
                    Oh, my God.
                          (beat)
                    She s the only girl I ever loved.  
                    And she s gone.

                    I m so sorry.

                                  RYAN
                    Look, I m sure what you do is right 
                    for some people, but what I need is 
                    to get back to my life.  Sign my 
                    thing.  Say I did the ten sessions.

                    I believe you want to help.  
                    Please.  Help.

      Beat.  She holds out her hand.  Ryan hands her the paper.  
      She signs and hands it back.

                    Thank you.

                    I have to apologize.  My little 
                    story?  You can t read people as 
                    well as you think.

                    You didn t... make that up?

                                  RYAN
                    I did.

                    I did you a favor.  You don t want

                    Wow.  That s --  Take care, Ryan.

      She pulls away.  As she goes...

      FADE IN:


      Ryan cruises through the place, wearing a huge grin.  Carrie 
      follows.  CO-WORKERS offer high-fives and cherry hellos.

                                  RYAN
                    Whatever you told them, it worked.

                                  CARRIE
                    I just said you didn t want to talk 
                    about it.  Everyone got it.
                          (notices)
                    Except her.  Turn.

      Ryan looks up, then ducks down a hallway, dodging Iris from 
      H.R.  Iris chokes down a sob as he passes.


      Steven is on his phone when Ryan bursts in.  He slaps the 
      signed sheet on the desk.  And something else.

                                  STEVEN
                    Ryan.

                                  RYAN
                    Greatest thing I ever did, changed 
                    my life, I m a new man.  Love you.

      Ryan leaves.  Steven picks up the sheet Ryan left.  And the 
       Steven shell . 


      A sign reads,  STUDIO C .  A red  ON AIR  SIGN is lit.


      We re mid-broadcast.  Ryan s behind the mic, back where he 
      belongs.  With him is Baltimore Ravens linebacker, RAY LEWIS.

                                  RYAN
                    When we return, more with Ray 
                    Lewis.  Can you stick around, Ray?

                                  RAY LEWIS
                    So long as you don t ask me to tell 
                    you which of my teammates are ugly.  GO ON "PILOT" 32.

                                  RYAN
                    Great.  When we return, Ray Lewis 
                    will discuss which of his teammates 
                    he finds most attractive.

      Heavy metal bumper music plays in the studio, then the 
        commercials.  An ENGINEER behind glass gives a thumbs-up.  

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Perfect, right?  Just one problem: 
                    why s the chair so high?  Who 
                    filled in for me?  The kid from 
                     Modern Family ?
                          (then)
                    Great segment, Ray.

      Ryan closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, savoring the 
      moment.  He rubs the board lovingly.  He s back.


      A valet stand below the building.  Parking ATTENDANTS BUZZ 
      about, there s SECURITY as well.  Ryan and Carrie enter from 
      an elevator, their day done.  Carrie lugs a box.

                                  RYAN
                    What s in the box?

                                  CARRIE
                    Flowers, baskets... stuff people 
                    sent you that you wouldn t want to 
                    see.  I m taking it.

                                  RYAN
                    We pay you so little you have to 
                    eat my condolence fruit?

                                  CARRIE
                    I may have to eat the flowers.

                                  RYAN
                    Well, great first day back.  You 
                    were unbelievable.

                                  CARRIE
                    Thank you.

                                  RYAN
                    No, I mean say that to me.

      Ryan turns and notices something.  His face falls.  GO ON "PILOT" 33.

                    Hey!  Hey!

      I/E. CADILLAC ESCALADE - SAME TIME

      Ray Lewis drives, joking with his ENTOURAGE, one hand on the 
      wheel.  With the other, he rifles off a text.  Music blares.

      Something hits the windshield with a wet THUD.  Driver and 
      passengers jump, startled.  Another thud.  It s wet flowers.


      Ray jumps out looks around.  Ryan, fruit basket in hand, has 
      taken Carrie s box and is hurling its contents at the car.

                                  RYAN
                    Idiot!
                          (throws basket)
                    You!  Ray!  Hang up.

                                  RAY LEWIS
                    Is this a joke?
                          (realizing, to bodyguard)
                    Did I just do his show?

                                  RYAN
                    Stop typing!  You re gonna kill 
                    someone.
                          (thinks)
                    Of course it wouldn t be the first 
                    time you did that, would it?

      This hangs in the air for a beat.  Then Ray lunges for Ryan.

      People pounce; Ray s guards, security, valet guys, twenty men 
      are on Ray in an instant.  Carrie alone goes to subdue Ryan.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Really?  One person?

                                  RAY LEWIS
                    I m all right, I m all right.

      As Ray backs off, his GIRLFRIEND flies out of the car and 
      comes at Ryan.  She wails on him.  With her fists, her bag...

                                  RYAN
                    What the hell!  Get off!

      Ryan tries unsuccessfully to fend off the blows.  Three 
      people converge to hold her back.  GO ON "PILOT" 34.
   1/17/12

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    Okay, I only got one holder.  
                    That s very insulting!

      The men pull the woman back to the car.

      Carrie has pulled Ryan to the side.  He sits on the curb.  
      She s now genuinely concerned.

                                  CARRIE
                          (gently)
                    Are you okay?  God, you just... 
                    exploded.

                                  RYAN
                    Yeah.  I guess I did.

      The Escalade pulls away.  A window rolls down.

                                  RAY S GIRLFRIEND 
                    Your show sucks!

      She throws what s left of the wet flowers at Ryan.  

      Ryan wipes the flowers off himself and slumps on the curb.  
      It s a new low.  He needs help.


      The group is mid-discussion.  Ryan comes in, hat in hand.

                                  RYAN
                    I m sorry I m late.  I know.  Rule 
                    nine.  I ll get better.

      Everyone is surprised, no one more so than Lauren.  Ryan 
      pulls up a chair and joins the circle.  Then he remembers 
      something.  He takes out his phone and shuts it off.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)

                    I m surprised to see you.

                                  RYAN
                    It was a car accident.  She was 
                    texting.  Janie.  That s her name.  
                    It was all her fault.  She was 
                    driving, not even fast, sending 
                    some dumb note to her dumb sister.  
                    She blew through a stop sign.  A 
                    guy was coming this way and...

                    That was it.
                          (sad smile)
                    She was the only girl I ever loved.  
                    That was true.  
                          (beat)
                    I don t know how to do this.

                                  LAUREN
                    You re doing fine.

      Ryan notices something out the window.  He pulls up short.

                                  RYAN
                    Listen, I know rule seven, we re 
                    not allowed to interrupt, but is it 
                    okay if I interrupt myself?

      Lauren looks confused.  Ryan hops up.  He grabs Owen by the 
      arm and drags him out.  As Ryan passes:

                                    YOLANDA
                    That s rule ten, actually.
