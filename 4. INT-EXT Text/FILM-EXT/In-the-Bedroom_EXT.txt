We are in the midst of a field of tall grass wild flowers.
A long rutted road stretches into the distance. Faintly at
first and then closer - we hear a woman squealing with
laughter. We see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a
hill. Close on her heels is a young man, a good ten years
younger, in hot pursuit.
Over the field - across the tops of blades, sits an ancient
apple tree. We rise out of the grass and see the two young
people under the tree. They are entwined - in a deep embrace.
CLOSER NOW
We see them in glimpses:
Their eyes - Lips - Hands
Finally they part - the woman rests her head on his chest.
She reaches out and strokes his hand.
He stares at their fingers mingling together.
The woman sighs.
WOMAN
I Love it here.
I know you do...
WOMAN
I can feel my life - ya know.
He stares up into the boughs above him and sHd.les.
A legend appears: Il -_ 1
THE SOUND OF BALLGAmE OVER:
T. RURAL ROUTE 90 - PREDAWN
A BLUE 1973 CHEW PICK-UP winds around a corner and
disappears down a long stretch of road. "And that's it from
Fenway the final score Oakland 3 t1 Redsox 7. You have been
listening to the re-broadcast of last night's game. This
broadcast is the sole property of -- -)r League Baseball and
cannot be-" -
The truck pulls onto a small road flanked by rows of 100 year
old clapboard two-story affairs.

Standing. on the lawn in front of one of them is the woman from
the opening scene, NATALIE STRUT, prett - eautifl actually
with a little more sleep. She stands wit two small boys who
are doing their best to stay warm in the morning air. Her son
JASON 8 , and his brother DUNCAN 4, who has his face buried in
his mother's coat--refusing to see or be seen.
The truck comes to a stop and two men get out. One is young,
early 20's, and even at this hour his step is lively, his
face full of warmth. He walks over to Natalie and gives her a
kiss. The young man from the opening scene, rRANK FOWLER.
The other man leans back against the passenger door. He is
in his early 50's. Kind face, good looking, athletic in his
day - Frank's father, MATT. He smiles at Natalie.
Natalie smiles back.
NATALIE
Morn'in Dr. Fowler.
MATT
Morn'in Natalie. How you doing boys?
JASON
Great!
Jason starts for the truck. Matt opens the door and the boy
climbs inside the cab.
Frank kneels down to Duncan.
F
Hey buddy ... you upset that you're not
coming?
Frank reaches out and puts his hand on the boys shoulder.
Duncan pulls away.
Frank looks up to Natalie for help.
F
He can come if he wants ...we can manage,
really.
She smiles and shakes her head.
NATALIE
ahead. He wants to stay here.
F
Don't worry Dunk. You can come next time.
,Qy
Natalie kisses him and they're off.
INTO TRUCK - SAME - MOVING
Jason in the middle. He glances over to Frank - a trace of
hero :worship in his face.
I NT. STROUT & SONS CANNERY - DAWN
Sardines are processed at lightening speed. We follow them on their
journey, which ends with the sealed cans being packed into
cardboard shipping boxes. They are taped shut by a young man we
will meet later (TIM, 3 ) . The tops read STROUT & SONS.
I NT. ATKINS LOBSTER CO-OP - DAWN
A double-55-gallon-drum wood stove is humping. Several men turn their
bodies rotisserie-fashion around the thing, while making morning
small talk - The starting price of lobsters, the prospect of repairs
to their equipment, and so on.
A SCARRED HAND scribbles some figures on a wall that has been
used as a scratch pad for years.
Two scales are emptied of RED FISH into a PLASTIC PICKLE BUCKET.
A pair of CANVAS TENNIS SHOES shuffle down a gangway. The
bucket sways directly over them. A small hand struggles with
the weight of the thing. A pair of BEACON FALLS waders appear
- the shoes stop. A strong hand grabs hold of the handle -
the shoes pick up the pace.
Matt & Frank prepare the rig.
Jason stands on the dock, taking it all in. A field of
LOBSTER POTS stacked like cordwood and surrounded by a
collection of SCARRED BUOYS, GRAPNEL and coiled FISHING GEAR
stiff with sea salt - all so wildly unreasonable as to seem
exotic.
Jason's eyes find the hull of "GIGI" an old Boudreau built
lobsterboat. Starboard side covered in barnacles.
F
C'mon up Jace.
MATT
Hold on a second. Need to know if he's
ready first - Jason, can you tell me
what's important?
Jason hesitates.
F
on tell h
JASON
(NERVOUS)
"A shaft of sunlight at the end of a dark
afternoon, a note in music--
L
He takes a breath.
JASON
and the way the back of a baby's neck
smells if its mother keeps it tidy."
MATT
(TO FRANK)
You taught h' well.
Jason beams.
MATT
- come aboard sailor.
Matt reaches down to give a hand up.
Frank turns the engine over. It roars to life.
The sun is fast climbing into the morning sky as "GIGI"
glides out of the channel and past a LIGHTHOUSE that sits
Just off the point of a good sized ISLAND.
Jason shields his eyes with his hand. He gazes out at the
island. Matt comes up beside him and sticks a baseball cap
onto his head. The crown reads U.S.S. CONSTELLATION.
JASON
Thank you.
MATT
Ever been over there?
JASON
No sir.
MATT
It's beautiful. Isn't an island anymore
though. It's a city. They have electric
lights. Artesian wells, even a jail
lighthouse isn't manned anymore - it's
run by a computer When I lived there,
had no ferry then` so we didn't even have
cars, can you believe that?
JASON
How'd you get back?
MATT
Off the island?
Jason nods.
We rowed.
Matt smiles at the memory.
5
MATT
Then we got a little outboard. That was
great. A seven and a half horsepower it
was - we lived there until I was about
your age - then we left and became
"harbor people".
Jason seems to be digesting this.
JASON
I a "harbor person"?
Matt hides a smile about to form.
MATT
Yep, Jason - we all are.
Jason is full of questions. Matt knows the answers and
doesn't talk down to him. Something the boy is grateful for.
F
At the helm. His eye s inted from glare and cold. He cuts
back on the throttle s and heads for the winch.
GLOVED HANDS pull up a BLUE-GREEN BUOY and slide the MANILA
LINE into the WINCH.
A POT surfaces and Frank sets it "Doors up" on the edge. He
opens the doors. His hands work quickly and efficiently. He
tosses a SMALL CRAB back into the water, pulls out a LOBSTER
and measures the back. Too small. Then a nice sized LOBSTER
is pulled out - it's missing the SCISSOR CLAW. He hands it to
Matt. Baits the trap. Throws the winch and the next pot
surfaces.
Matt sits inside, Jason on his lap. He reaches into a WOODEN
BOX of RUBBER BANDS with a BANDING WRENCH and bands the
crustacean's remaining CRUNCHER CLAW.
Jason stares at the disfigured creature.
MATT
Oh boy you see what happened to
this poor fel ow?
JASON
.what?
MATT
Well, the trap has nylon nets called
heads--2 side heads at b ends, so the
lobster can crawl in. The "Bedroom" head
inside, holds the bait and keeps it from
escaping--you know the old saying "two's
company three-s a crowd"?
Jason nods.
MATT
Well{ it's like that. You get more than
two in a bedroom and chances are
something like this is going to happen.
That's why Frank can't leave these traps
for more than a day.
Matt holds up another Lobster and turns it belly-up. There
are black balls on both sides of the tail.
MATT
Now the older females like this of gal,
are the most dan erous - especially when
they're growin' eyries.
JASON
Berries?
MATT
Eggs... .one of these can take out two
males easy - Then you wind up with
lobster you can't sell - and as for this
fine lady, she gets off easy, the state
says you have to let her go.
Matt throws her back in the water. Holds up the other one to Jason.
TT
Can you handle this?
Jason nods.
MATT
(GENTLY)
You sure?
He really isn't. Matt hands it to him.
MATT
Go ahead now, put it in the tank.
Jason can't get the thing in the tank fast enough.
Looking around, you see a big yard, double lot. The grass is
manicured to per ection, someone takes a lot of pride in
their garden. In the middle of this sits a two story cape,
post Hopper/Wyeth, early 20th Century - simple, beautiful,
d you on't freeze in the winter.
The truck backs up into the driveway, Frank j s out, drops
the gate. Resting on the bed is a LARGE BOX wit a line drawing
of a SWING-SET.
Q
FRANK O.S.
Hey, dad can you give me a hand?
The transistorized sounds of a baseball qame.
Frank pushes Duncan, who sits proudly on his new swing-set.
D C
Higher! HIGHER!
SMALL CHILDREN are everywhere. A serious Super Soaker Squirt
Gun fight in progress.
ACROSS THE YARD
a steaming hot grill, with a huge assortment of hot-dogs &
burgers. A spatula flips a patty.
The sounds of Fenwav park emanate from a chea Dort able
radio.
WILLIS GRINNEL, early 50's, a stout, silver-haired man, works
the grill. Standing next to him is Matt, his best friend for
forty plus years.
Matt takes a pull off a can of Moxie. Sets it down and searches
through a plastic bread bag.
Willis looks past him, distracted.
MATT
h, Ruth hates this kind.
What?
MATT
I bought the wrong buns.
WILLIS
Maybe we can borrow hers.
Matt follows Willis's gaze, to the object of his distraction:
A PRETTY WOMAN IN TIGHT DENIM SHORTS. She-s bent over to wipe
the ketchup-stained face of Jason (he's wearing Matt's cap).
WILLIS
Ah, what I would give to have back my
youth.
MATT
Willis, you never had that in your youth.
The woman turns around and catches Willis staring. It's
Natalia.
Willis looks down, nonchalantly rifling through the bun bag.
Matt waves to a passing man in khaki shorts, FATHER OBERTI,
50-S-
MATT
Father! You made it!
FATHER OBERTI
Hey, if I don't see you fellas here, I
don't get to see you at all.
ON F
He backwards-hugs Natalie.
F
You want a beer?
NATALIE
I think I'll see if your Mom needs any
help.
FRANK
Good luck.
She laughs-He grabs and tickles her but she breaks away and
escapes inside the house.
Matt watches on, and falls into a wistful daydream.
WILLIS
Jealous?
Matt turns to him and, to Willis's surprise, ever so slightly,
nods.
I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - S
Natalie walks in through the living room, pausing to examine
a half finished ARCHITECTURAL MODEL that sits on a card-table
next to a jigsaw puzzle.
She looks toward the kitchen where a woman works at the sink.
She takes a breath and starts there.
I NT. FOWLER GARAGE - DAY

Frank reaches into an old Westinghouse refrigerator. He pulls
out a case of Schaeffer's and a six-pack of Moxie. He loads it
all into a metal tub filled with ice.

FRONT OF THE GARAGE
TIM BRYSON, 22, still in his work clothes: He wears a White
soiled smock. A patch on his Right pocket says STROUT & SONS.
Over the left sply TIM. A hair-net nests on his head.
F
Thanks for coming by. Wooo, is that new
cologne? You really oughta take a shower
when you leave that place.
TIM
Very funny.
F
Take off that head dress, chief, and give
me a hand?
Tim reaches up and pulls the hair-net off his head.
EXT - FOWLER HOUSE - DAY
SIDE OF THE HOUSE
Tim and Frank lug the heavy cooler around the house, heading
toward the backyard.
TIM
So, Mr. Strout mentioned you again.
FRANK
I bet he did.
TIM
Seriously, man. He still talks about you
coming back. Says you're the best can
packer he ever had.
Be nods.
F
He always was a nice guy.
TIM
(EXHAUSTED)
Are we there yet?
Tim and Frank emerge from the side of the house. Willis cuts
them off, grabs two beers.
WILLIS
Excuse me boys - an offering. Catch
Father.
He throws one to Father Oberti who sits talking with Willis's wife
KATIE GRINNEL 50's, she is tal ing the priest's ear off.
KATIE
Becky went to the hairdressing academy
after high school, but aft she got
married and had the boys, she decided she
wanted to stay home - she still loves
doing hair though. Where do you go
Father?
FATHER OBERTI
I just go to Super Cuts.
10
KATIE
You can't request the same girl at Super
Cuts - you have to take what you can get.
They don't know your hair - how can you
get a good cut i they don't know the
air?
Father Oberti has the patience of...well,of a priest.
I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - DAY
RUTH FOWLER 50, attractive, is washing and arranging
vegetables on a plate. Natalie chops carrots on a cutting
board.
They barely make eye-contact. Natalie attempts small talk.
RUTH
Can you hand me that bowl dear?
She does.
RUTH
Thank you.
NATALIE
I'm looking forward to the concert on
Labor day. The music is so...unusual
haunting really..
Ruth keeps chopping. Natalie chooses her words carefully.
NATALIE
How did you learn about that particular
style?
RUTH
At Faro y thesis was on Eastern
European .folk music.
Natalie's lips tighten uncomfortably. The topic seems to int date.
NATALIE
(LIGHTLY)
I thought o becoming a teacher.
RUTH
Why didn't you?
The answer to Ruth's question (Duncan) wanders in. His cheeks
as big as Dizzy Gillespie's.
NATALIE
What are you eating?
Duncan's mouth is so full he can hardly speak.
DUN
.nothing.
The two regard each other
NATALIE
How is it?
D C
(SMILING)
Good.
He tugs on her shirt.
D C
Swing me, Swing me.
NATALIE
Okay, okay Dunk...
She gets dragged out of the kitchen. The screen door slams.
Ruth finishes arranging the plate. Matt enters, and starts
opening up the cupboards loo
king for something.
He squats down, burrowing into a cabinet.
MATT
It was nice of you to invite the boys.
RUTH
She hasn't brought them before because
she's embarrassed. She shouldn't be
embarrassed.
Matt looks up from the floor.

Nice view from down here.
She ignores him, but smiles.

I don't know why you had to put that
monstrosity up. You're just going to have
to take it apart when they leave.
Matt rises, a bottle of lighter fluid in hand.
MATT
C'mon, Ruth, he's a kid. What did you
expect? "Happy Birthday, here's a box.
why don't you drag it around for a while?"
He s a kid. He wants it now.
Something across the yard catches her attention.
RUTH
Oh, no.
Matt exits the house.
ACROSS THE YARD
Duncan jumps off his swing and sprints.
TO RICHARD
who has just arrived. He stays at the far end of the yard.
Duncan does a running jump into his father's arms.

Daddy!
Frank with Jason, looks up.
Jason sees his father. He doesn't move.
Natalie walks over to Frank, they exchange glances.
NATALIE
C'mon Jason.

Jason looks away.

I told you held come uttface-
Jason reaches over and whacks Duncan on the head.
RIC
(ANGRY)
Hey Jason - Don't do that to your
brother. You want me to do that to you?
He probably has. Jason backs away.
Frank makes his way over to Natalie.

Matt watches on- absently flipping burgers.
Ruth comes over to h

MATT
IT'S OK-
Ruth shakes her head.
Richard, Frank and Natalie are talking, but there are long pauses
between words. Tim wanders over and says something to Richard
Finally, Richard smiles, turns, and exits. Alone.
Jason playfully chases Duncan across the yard.
Frank and Natalie stay behind, talking quietly.
Matt takes a breath, and exhales. He turns to Ruth with a
comforting smile, but
she's just entering the house. The screen door closes behind
her.

Ruth is at the counter pouring dressing onto a salad. Frank
comes up behind her and hugs her.

Are you alright?

Sure. Natalie and I want to take you and
dad out tonight.
RUTH
Oh that's very sweet dear, but we already

Ruth shakes her head.
RUTH

Your father's taking me to the Strand.
FRANK
Oh, what are you seeing?
RUTH
The first film we ever saw together.
THE SOUND OF PISTOL FIRE.
Ruth heads out the doors with Matt on her heels.
MATT
What's wrong?
RUTH
I don't remember it being so tragic.
MATT
O h h always felt sorry for Barry.
RUTH
Please.
MATT
No, I mean it - maybe I relate to him.
RUTH
What are you talking about?
MATT
Well, we both married above our station.
RUTH
Don't start that again.
A moment. He takes her in his arms and kisses her. Looks into

Ruth sits at her bureau facing the mirror. She be ins a nightly
ritual of removing the pins from her hair once ma e from the
shells of tortoises and now the plastics of Dupont.
Matt lies in bed reading. He lowers his book and watches her
brush her tresses with on y, delicious strokes. She sets down
her bsh and turns. Matt ooks back to his book.
She climbs into bed next to him.
RUTH
She's not divorced yet.
MATT
It's the same thing. Maine has crazy
laws, that's all...he likes the boys.
RUTH
You don't think he's thinking about-
TT
No...he's not going to marry her.
RUTH
Then what's he doing with her?
MATT
She probably loves him, Ruth. Girls
always have. Why can't we just leave it
at that?
RUTH
Hmmmm. He won't listen to me. I asked him
three times to dismantle that swing-set.
MATT
Oh, let it stay up. Looks like a young
couple lives here.
RUTH
He needs his head in school. Not in her.
MATT
So to speak.
Ruth pinches his shoulder.
RUTH
it would help if you were my side.

I'll get on your side.
She laughs and pushes him away.

A small waiting room with an alcove reception. ROCKWELL PRINTS

ADAMSON 80's, glances over at her husband, ELWYN 80's,who
vacantly thumbs through a HIGHLIGHTS MAGAZINE. He pauses to
catch-up on the latest exploits of GOOFUS & GALLANT.
The nurse, JANELLE 40's, calls out from the alcove.
JANELLE O.S.
Mr. and Mrs. Adamson?
Matt trots down the gangway and up to where the "GIGI" is
moored. He looks in. No sign of Frank. A VOICE BOOMS from a
new 35ft. JONESPORTER - it belongs to HENRY OZAR 50's.
HENRY
Just missed him Matt, he went home for

NATALIE - walks out, from a room in the hall. She combs her
hair through with her fingers, but her skirt, on backwards, is
somewhat of a giveaway.
Frank rolls his eyes.
NATALIE
Hello, Dr. Fowler.
MATT
Hi, where are the boys?
NATALIE
(SHEEPISHLY)
.with my mom.
Then.
MATT
(TO NATALIE))
oh-Like coleslaw?
THE KITCHEN TABLE
Matt sits across from Natalie and Frank. Sandwiches, iced tea
and coleslaw are laid out.
Frank looks to Matt for some kind of acknowledgement of his
lunch-te activities. Matt seems more interested in the slaw.
BLEACHERS
Frank is sandwiched between Matt and Ruth. They are surrounded
by dozens of young parents.
Ruth doesn't look too tilled to be here.
FRANK
Wave you guys.
Matt and Ruth follows Frank's gaze, to:

Natalie has her hands full adjusting Jason's uniform while
Duncan clings to her. She is waving up to the Fowlers amidst
the chaos.
THE BLEACHERS.
The Fowlers wave back.
%Q,

MATT
Did you tell your Mom how good it was?
20
RUTH
How good what was?
MATT
Frank had quite a time this afternoon
Loved your coleslaw. Ate enough for two.
RUTH
That's what it's there for...
Frank leans back behind Ruth to give his father the evil eye.
He gets a grin from Matt for his trouble. Ruth almost catches
it.
Matt rises, shuffles past Ruth and Frank, whom he gives a firm
pat on the knee.
Hot dogs?
FRANK
I'll take one.
Ruth puts her arm around Frank.
RUTH
(re: Duncan and Jason)
So, how are the kids?
Frank's caught off- guard. He shakes his head.
RUTH

Fine.
RUTH
Good, good.

Hi, Dr. Fowler
Matt waves.

Frank is hosing down the hull, as Matt makes his way down the
gangway.
MATT
What'd you pull?
Frank glances up, then continues with his work.
F
Not too bad, about forty pounds.
MATT
Haven't caught sight of you in days.
F
You know where to find me.
MATT
When you coming home?
Frank turns off the spigot.
F
Has it come to this?
He jumps back into the boat and retrieves the bait bucket.
MATT
Come to what?
Frank hops back onto the dock and sets down the container.
F
(SMILES)
You having to run errands for Mom.
Matt ignores the jibe. Frank starts stacking holding crates.
F
I'm thinking of building a couple hundred
more traps - see if I can do better than
break even.
Matt doesn't comment. He picks up a crate and throws it up top.
MATT
it'll take you two years to get a licence
to fish off-season.
FRANK
Right ...unless Henry takes me on as his
ster an. % Q
They continue stacking.
MATT
You think he'd do that?

F
Maybe ...it's as good a life as any. Good
enough for your father - sometimes things
skip a generation.
MATT
(trying to sta calm)
C'mon Frank - you ow ycu need something
more.
F
Why? So I can have an Ivy Lea e
education like you? Christ, i it's so
great - how come you sneak out of that
office everyday to come down here?
MATT
I like spending time with my son.
FRANK
(DUBIOUS)
UH HUHA
A MOMENTA
Frank lugs up the last container and takes a seat on the
stack. He's worn out - takes a breather.
Frank shakes his head.
FRANK
(PAINFUL)
I don't know dad---I don't know.
Matt takes a seat next to him.
A moment.
F
She's a wonderful girl ...I see that.
Frank looks lost.
The silence is broken by a loud voice.
HENRY O.S.

Ruth comes down the stairs, wrapping her bathrobe around her,
The Dining room light is on.
THE DININGROOM
Frank sits at the t lea His drafting tools are out. He's fully
immersed in a sketch.
Ruth enters quietly.
RUTH
Your father is snoring. Don't mind me.
She takes a container from the fridgge, smells it, makes a
quenstioning face, then puts it back - grabs another container
and opens a cupboard. Pulls out a loaf of bread.
She quietly places a sandwich in front of him, and takes a
seat.
RUTH
Eat---you must be hungry.
Frank doesn't look up. his tone is flat, removed.
F
I'm not hungry.
RUTH
Coffee?
He doesn't answer. Ruth sits there, awkwardly.
RUTH
So---you talked with her?
FRANK
Yep.
RUTH
d-,,how is she?
F
(SHARPLY)
Oh, she's great.
I just wanted to tell you that we
I - liked her, Do like her. She's a
WONDERFUL GIRL
Frank finally puts down his pencil,',-and looks at her,
F
You're not reall going to have this
conversation wit me now, Ma? Are you?
Frank returns to his work. He doesn't look up again.
37
She leaves the food for him. Like a zoo keeper.
Frank hauls traps. He appears lethargic, dull - the hands a
little slower. The eyes tired. The joy of the work, replaced by
dread.
Frank's casket is lowered into the ground.
A large gathering of relatives and friends stand before Father
Oberti as he finishes the eulogy.
Matt's arm is tightly interlocked with Ruth's, beneath her
eyes - swelling from three days of suffering. Their hands
c enched to ether make one fist, both parents keeping the
other uprig t. The rain glides down their faces, mixing easily
with tears.
Matt steps up to Frank's open grave.
The gathering watches as Matt peers down into the hole,
silently speaking to it. He reaches down, grabs a fistful of
dirt. Then tosses it into the open grave.
Matt pauses, staring down, into the hole ---
He steps back, as Father Oberti delivers the end of his eulogy.
Matt looks blankly around, noticing the family's many friends
includin ; Carl and Henry from the game, Willis and Katie, and
Frank's friend, T
Matt's eyes linger on someone behind T
A LONE FEMALE FIGURE IN BLACK, away from the crowd. Natalie.
Their eyes meet.
Matt, almost imperceptibly, nods.

standing in the middle of a much larger gathering, the reception
after the funeral.
Matt stands in the downstairs hallway. He looks around the
room, as if it is all a dream.
Children getting soda pop. Others in conversation. The odd
person looks up at him, then turns away.
Willis steps up to Matt.
His wife, Katie, stands nearby.
Matt doesn't seem to notice Willis.
Willis puts a gentle hand on his friend's arm.
WILLIS
(SOFTLY)
Can I get you anything?
Matt suddenly looks up at them, as if confused.

KATIE
She went to lie down, Matt.
He turns d heads upstairs. Willis and Katie watch him go.
UPSTAIRS
Matt approaches their bedroom. The door is a
BEDROOM
He steps in, to Ruth, who is on the bed. Her back is to him,
a arently sleeping. Crumbled tissues litter the bed, the
f oor,
Matt ietl moves to her. He reaches down, about to touch her
head. Something stops h
1-5
He turns, and leaves.
UPSTAIRS
Frank's room is facing him. Instinctively, he goes to open the
door, then pauses.
'S ROOM
Matt slowly enters. He looks around, as if freezing the room in
his memory.
The place is untouched. Frank's many sketches are still pinned to the
wall. Some clothes lie scattered on the floor. His fishing cap.
Matt starts to pick up. He takes Frank's clothes from the floor
and places them on his bed.
He looks at a dirty T-shirt in his hand. He brings it to his face. He
inhales deeply, able to smell his son's lingering scent-
Finally, he sets the shirt on the bed. Wanders around. Strays
near Frank's drafting table-
He reaches out, touching the table, grazingthe topogra h of
scattered pencils - drawings strewn across it- The Froe e Gifts.
He takes a seat at the table. Feeling its frame, the sketches,
the seat below-
And without warning he is overcome. He lurches forward,
burying his face in his hands. The sobs come unrestrained,
violently, like a sudden tidal wave.
Ruth stands transfixed. REFLECTED IN THE WINDOW PANE BELOW
HER FACE: SEE
QuJ glimpses through branches, of a small boy scampering up a
tree. Flashes of arms, legs, a smile.
We can make out the GIGGLES of the child, but they are
distorted, wobbly, as if deteriorated by memory.
The tree shudders as the boy climbs higher.
MATT O.S. RUTH O.S.
Okay - watch it now, Frank. Frank, listen to your father.
That's high enough ...
The tree continues shaking.
Ruth allows the memory, then turns back and pads back down the
hallway.
Natalie comes up the brick walk and enters the building.
A handful of reporters and photographers lingering on the
lawn, are galvanized by the arrival of the Fowlers.
I NT. FOWLER HOUSE DAY
Ruth is just entering, jostled, relieved to be home.
She turns. Matt's not there. She looks out the front door to

Do you plan to take any further legal
action, Dr. Fowler?
REPORTER #3
Dr. Fowler, have you had any contact with
Mr- Strout?
Matt stands paralyzed, a deer caught in the headlights.
THE KITHCHEN
Matt enters as Ruth takes the plates to the sink. She keeps her
back to him. He pulls off his coat.
MATT
Can you believe this? I ask those idiots to
leave. No one budges. Not one. What the hell
are we supposed to do, bring them sandwiches?

clock. It- a ter three.

KITCHEN
He opens a cupboard door and grabs some Fig Newtons. He
stands there eating them, the door of the cupboard is long,
the kind you see in old capes. Matt stares at the inside of
the door. His finger slides down the length, he kneels down.
We see what he's looking at. Pen and pencil marks straight
lines each about two inches apart - each with Frank's name
and aqe.
T DEN
Matt sits in his chair. The plays, muted. He s looks at it,
but he's not watching.
Finally, he rises, clicks the off, with the remote, and
flicks off the light.
A small development of modest, duplex apartment buildings. The
architecture is outdated, the landscape unkempt.
CLOSER ON one corner unit. The lights are off; there is no sign

WE HEAR the RADIO "The following is a re-broadcast of last
nights game, the third in a four game series{ between the
Boston Red Sox and the Cleveland Indians. This broadcast is

We see Ruth from a good distance away, watched from afar. She
places some potted daisies on a grave. She kneels down.
Ruth walks through an empty lot and heads for her c

She is startled.
She turns around. It's Father Oberti.

Ruth and Father Oberti sit smoking on a bench.
RUTH
It comes in waves, .and then nothing. Like
a rest in music. No sound - but so loud.
A moment.
RUTH
I don't know what to do.
Father Oberti nods.
RUTH
I feel so ang
Father Oberti looks off in the distance.
FATHER OBERTI
Louise McVey lost a child a few years
back. Maybe you remember.
RUTH
(SEARCHING)
mmmm she had four - it was the youngest
girl, wasn't it?
FATHER OBERTI
Yes. She told me about a vision she had
when she found out her daughter had
died ...she saw herself at a great
distance from the earth encircling
it, an endless line - as she got closer
she saw that it was made up of mothers
traveling forward. She fell into line,
and began walking with them. When they
reached a certain point, the line
divided. She said she knew - that all the
millions of women on her side - were the
mothers who had lost children-she
seemed to find great comfort in that.
Ruth doesn't react.
RUTH
How did she die?
FATHER OBERTI
A drowning ... some kind of swimming
accident.

Oblivious to Ruth's presence.
Two Hefty bags are dragged along the walk. Matt tosses one
next to a garbage that sits just inside the garage. He picks
up the other bag tossing it inside.
The bottom splits and grass spills out onto the drive-way. He
goes inside and returns with a broom.
He sweeps the rass into a pile. Picking up handfuls and
refilling the gay. He takes the broom and sweeps what's left
back toward the la . He stops, stares down at his feet.

Ruth's car pulls into the driveway.
She gets out, almost slamming the car door.
Without a word, she moves past Matt, and into the house.
Matt continues sweeping.
I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER
Ruth wakes to the sound of metal on metal. She looks over to
Matt, he's not there.

She steps to the window, pulls back the shears and looks out.
Through the window, in the dark, alone, flashlight in hand.
Matt is dismantling the swin set.
- GRINNEL CABIN - DAY
A four room dwelling, surrounded by a wrap around porch that
looks out over a canopy of forest below. The place was built
before insulation was practical. Planks, beams , and studs are
exposed. There is a bathroom, two bedrooms, and a common room
consisting of a kitchen/dining area, and living room, with a
ge, river stone fireplace.
There are two oil burning 1 ps hanging from cross beams at
each end of the room. Ruth sits next to Katie at a table in
the middle of the room. Katie is ouring over a stack of
snapshot books, descibin her chid "h and r dchildren in

that the family made to Florida. There is a clear dif erence
in vernacular between the two women, Katie also has a voice
that has been trained to reach anyone who might be in the f
corners of her house.

Ruth smiles at the thought and shakes her head-

Katie turns from the snapshots and takes a breath while
holding up her fingers to count-She is genuinely unsure.

this trip to Florida, we was in one of

A steady CHOPPING rhythm is heard in the background.
Matt turns. Willis is chopping the last of some firewood.

Willis plants his in the stump.

You ask me that eve t e. You know the cove, the
other side of the c in?

All the way to the other shoreline.
Matt turns to him, grinning.
WILLIS
Almost three hundred and fifty acres.
Know what it went for when I bought it?
You don't want to know.
Matt continues surveying, awed.
Willis turns, starts walking back to his chore.

Come on, I'll let you help me.
Matt joins him. Together, they bundle up the wood.

Matt and Willis load the wood into a small trailer attached

Willis, Katie, Matt and Ruth, sit around a copious holiday
spread, well into their meal.
KATIE
It's a wonderful product and the treat you
pretty good. It was on account oz, selling Mary
Kay, that we got the new Subaru.
RUTH

The ride up was very comfortable. It's a
very nice car.

WILLIS
Well it's not really a car, it's got four-wheel drive.
It's a little SUV.
The Grinnel's custom, is to loudly, and with very little effort,
finish each others sentences. This is how they have fun.

She walks over to the window and fingers the fabric.
KATIE
They're pillowcases from our first house.
Ruth smiles at the memory. Katie sits back down at the table.
KATIE
Oh, I've saved every knick=knack & whim-wham we
ever had.
A post stands proudly at the end of a dirt and gravel road.
Attached to it are two signs. One reads PRIVATE ROAD. The
other, NO HUNTING.
It butts up against two lanes of blacktop - a small logging
road.
Headlights cut through the early evening.
Willis's idea of a S a green, SUBARU FORESTER, kicks up some
rocks. it pauses briefly before taking a right onto the pavement.
The car is stopped behind a wooden guard arm. A swing bridge
opens for a large fishing boat. The bridge is operated by one
man. Be uses a long metal tool, that he loops into a pulley
system, which lies beneath a grid in the center of the
bridge.
Ruth asleep in the back seat, it-s been a long weekend. Matt
glances over at her, then up to the front
We are outside the car as it waits for the Drawbridge to
close, so it may continue. We hear the following from
perspective.

Well he dunnit want to go overseas - oh
no...he told them he'd Reep doinit as

(INTER PTIN )
But David says if theyy want him to go out
to New Mexico or California, he'll go
back to infantry - he don't care. Long as
he stays out here. He's not about to--
WI IS
Course he don't like working in

Well, like that one kid - he had him all
the way through the works and then - Oh

His folks called David and said that the
boy wanted out so bad -- that he'd taken
his own life.
They all look at each other. How did this conversation get so
depressing?
WILLIS
Yeah well something like that gets to you
Christ, I couldn't do it.
Matt stands in the wheelhouse, he brings the helm about,.cuts
back on the throttle and heads for the winch, the stern is
stacked with four high rows of Frank's empty traps.
Matt pulls up a string of pots. Opens the door and pulls out
a young male. He flinches and drops it. His finger goes to
his mouth.
Loaded up to the gills with pots. She turns toward harbor.
Matt at the wheelhouse heading in. His hand on the wheel,
blood trickles from his finger. He sucks on it again, reaches
down underneath his feet and pulls a band-aid from a box and
applies it to the finger.
Matt unloads Frank's traps onto the landing.
He stops. Seems to sense something. He looks back up the gangway.
Jason sits on his bicycle watching.
The two regard each other for a moment. Then without a word
Jason rides off.

Ruth is alone at her desk, she wears headphones and is busy
making notations on a sheet of manuscript paper.
There's a KNOCK on her door. She doesn't look up.

Yes?
There's a pause, then the door slowly opens.
Natalie takes a step in.
Ruth looks up. If she's surprised, she doesn't show it,
NATALIE
I - -a I hope this is okay.
Ruth says nothing. Natalie moves closer.
NATALIE
I've been hoping we might be able to get
together - to talk.
Ruth watches her as she approaches the desk. Natalie bends and
cautiously extends her hand for Ruth to hold.
NATALIE
I just want to tell you how -e-
And in a flash Ruth SLAPS Natalie across the face with her open
hand.
Natalie springs back, paralyzed with shock.
She tries to catch her breath, staring directly at Ruth.
Eyes ablaze, Ruth says nothing.
- The two women look at each other for a very long time
And final , as if she finally somehow got the resolution she
came for, lead held high, Natalie turns and walks out.

Matt glances over, for a moment he half expects to see Frank.
He cracks the passenger side window, for a better look.
He stares at the driver's window.
Their window rolls down.
attractive girl with short brunette hair stares back at
Matt.
Lost in the absurdity, he doesn't look away.
The light changes.
The girl smiles sweetly and blows him a kiss, before
continuing through the light.
Matt watches her go - he smiles - as if somehow relieved.
The car behind him gives a polite toot - Matt makes the
left.

She puts milk in the refrigerator and stares into it for a long
time, trying to decide what to do. He can feel her judging

the refrigerator door- revealing, taped to it, several
newspaper articles on the case, gathered by her, no doubt,
including one with a picture of Frank.
MATT
How did it go today?
She doesn't answer.
MATT
Something wrong?
She doesn't turn around.
RUTH
Wrong? Like what, Matt? What could be
wrong?
She continues "straightening up", starts recklessly washing
dishes.
Matt doesn't leave.
A plate SHATTERS in the sink.
This stops her. She stares at it, then feels his presence. She
turns around.
RUTH
What do you want?
He looks unsure of himself.
MATT
I want to know what's going on.
RUTH
Right.
MATT
You're obviously upset. If there's
something you want to talk about ...
RUTH
Talk? Who, us? Oh, you mean to each other?
What if somebod waked in? They wouldn't
recognize us. They'd think they had the
wrong house.

Matt takes this in. He breathes deeply.
MATT
Do you want to talk or not?
RUTH
("SEARCHING" )
Talk, talk ... oh, you must mean about our
dead son. No, we haven't before, why
should we bother now?
They stare at each other across the kitchen.
MATT

What can I do, Ruth?
Ruth looks at him for a long time.
RUTH
Forget it, Matt. Why don't you just go ...
MATT
(BUILDING)
What do you want from me?
RUTH
I want you to stop acting like nothing's
happened! That's what I want.
MATT
Why? because I'm not bouncing off the
walls?
RUTH
No, Matt, That would require feelings. We
don't want you to hurt yourself.
MATT
Do me a favor, Ruth. You want to have a
grieving contest, go find someone else.
He starts to turn.
RUTH
yeah, I know how you grieve. have
another beer.
He spins back.
MATT
WHAT DO YOU OW? WHAT? You know nothing!
You know nothing about me. What I go
through every day - ever lousy,
stinking day.
RUTH
No, I don't know, Matt. I don't know what
you go through, or if you go through
ything. But that's your choice, dear,
not mine...

MATT
You're goddamn right it is. My choice is
to not scream at the world. Maybe one of
us has to be reasonable here, did you ever
think of that?
RUTH
Reasonable? e, Matt, I don' t know about
you, but I ss my son. I'm glad you have
time for reason. That's what you imparted
to Frank, That sense of reason - Oh, he
thought you were very reasonable.
MATT
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
She is about to say something, but stops short.
RUTH
Nothing.
She turns back to the dishes.
He moves in on her, seething.

What are you really trying to say anyway?
She says nothing, picking up the broken plates.

No. But you did. You were winking at him

wanted what he had. Her.
MATT
You've got to be kidding...
RUTH
You know it. Come on. You wanted it, and you
couldn't get it - that's why you didn't stop him
so you could get your kicks through your son.
You know that's what happened. And now you can't
cope with it. You can't admit the truth - To me,
or to yourself - You can't admit that he died for
ygur fantasy piece of ass.
Matt, stunned, reels for a second
And then, finally, explodes.
TT
You want to know why our son is dead,
Ruth? He wasn't with her because of me, he
went there because of you. Because you
were so controllins, so overbearing, so
angry that he was it, that he was our only
one.
RUTH
That is not true.
MATT
It is! From the time he was little you
were telling him why he was wrong.
Everything he did was wrong. What was
wrong with him, Ruth?
She stares at him, dumbfounded.

You are so unfor ivinge You are. That's

yourself first.
She already has, of course.
RUTH

I just wanted to talk about what happened,
Matt.
MATT
You expect me just to open up to you?
Embrace you? You scare me. How can I talk
to you? I can't even look at you.
They suddenly become aware of the DOORBELL, ringing, over and
over.
They watch each other, both reeling, both out of breath. The
DOORBELL continues.
MATT

That's probably ... the police.

Matt opens it. There is no cop, just Kristen Gellar, 12, a young
gymnast who'd like to compete in Hawaii.

Matt stands over her, unsure of which way to go.
He stares absently into the small mountain of candy in his
hands - sets it on the coffee table
He takes a seat at the other end of the couch.
MATT
Ruth...
RUTH
(SOFTLY)
Yes?
MATT
Ruth .001 had no right. . .what I said -0. no
one, no one should ever have to hear
that...
RUTH
(BARELY AUDIBLE)
I'm so sorry...
He looks at her, as she starts to cry.
He moves closer to her.
MATT
It's okay...
RUTH
No, you're right, Matt, You are
am-.. horrible. ?-`
MATT
Please--.
85
RUTH
I don't blame you, Matt. I just...
that girl came by. She came by the
school, and I couldn't forgive her. I was
so...
She lets go, crying hard.
He lifts her head onto his lap.
He reaches out, stroking her head, pulling her matted hair from
her forehead as she sobs into his lap.
RUTH
I'm sorry. I have been so an - I keep
seeing him, Matt. I've seen him.
Matt nods, but he's not really clear.
MATT
(CONFUSED)
..Oh I know - up in his room - Sometimes
I swear Frank's in there - on the way home
just now - at a stop light - for a second
I COULD'VE--
RUTH
(SOFTLY)
Not Frank.
Matt freezes.
Then.
RUTH
Richard...
She breaks into sobs.
RUTH
.and I don't know what to do.
MATT
Where did you see him?
RUTH
Eve here - Downtown, and the market. I
saw at South End. He smiled at me,
Matt - I keep running into him ... he
s led.
Matt still strokes her hair.
But he's in another world.
86
INTO GRINNEL HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
The game has just started. Willis deals. Henry, Carl & Willis
pick up the old banter as if Matt had onl been away on
vacation; but he can see the affection an courtesy.in their
eyes.
WILLIS
The ne of the game is Texas Chase'
He groans.
WILLIS
Is there a problem?
HENRY
Why do you delude yourself with that
crap?
WILLIS
What are you talking about?
HENRY
Look we're not in Vegas. It's five card
draw, or seven card stud.
WILLIS
(ENJOYING THIS)
That's what I said five card draw - jacks
to open - Carl?
HENRY
Asshole,
Matt smiles. He's missed these guys.
CARL
I'll open with a dollar.
HENRY
Raise a buck.
The bet's to Matt. He stares at his cards for a very long
time. Willis looks to say something, when Henry hits his arm.
This stops him.
Matt looks up. He sees the patience they are all exercising
for his typical indecisiveness. This bothers him.
He stares back down at his cards. Stalling, waiting for
someone to bust him.
He looks u at Willis - Henry - Carl. They all sort of smile
uncomfortably. He can't take it.
TT
Oh, for Christ sake say something!
This wakes them up.
87
MATT
Quit pussy footing around me d 't! You
just gonna let me stare at these cards
all night!?
No one wants to make the first move.
This upsets Matt even more.
MATT
O.K. fine!
He stares back down at his cards.
Finally it is Carl who speaks.
There are things of which I may not speak;
There are dreams that cannot die;
There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak,
And bring a pallor into the cheek,
And a mist before the eye.
And the words of that fatal song
come over me like a chill:
A boy's will is the wind's will,
And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.
Matt looks up from his cards into Carl's eyes.
The two men regard each other.
The game has ended. Matt says goodnight to Henry and Carl, as
the two of them pull out of Willis Is driveway. Matt is about to
leave. Just climbing in the front seat. When Willis puts a hand
on his shoulder.
WILLIS
Come back in for a drink.
I NT. GRINNEL HOUSE- ENTRY HALL - NIGHT
Willis and Matt step back in, closing the door behind them.
KATIE O.S.
Honey, are you coming to bed now?
Willis moves to the steps leading upstairs.
WILLIS
Soon baby, Matt's still here.
KATIE 0.S. 11 %-?.:
Oh f hi Matt - Hone , would you mind
bringing me my pit s? They're downstairs
from when the kids were here.
WILLIS
I'll be right there.
I NT. GRINNEL HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
A few minutes later.
Matt sits alone in the room. Be gets up to examine a picture
hanging on the opposite wall. He's not particularly
interested, he's seen it a million times, he's just killing
time. A corner of the room devoted to Naval memories. A
pristine version of Matt's U.S.S. CONSTELLATION cap serves as
the center piece.
Willis comes down from upstairs.
WILLIS
She's all set - now what can I get you?
MATT
I'm fine thanks.
Willis nods and takes a seat.
WILLIS
- you back on the wagon?
He is.
WILLIS
Sit down Matt you're making me nervous.
Matt takes a seat.
WILLIS
I'm glad you came tonight.
MATT
Me too.
WILLIS
Boy, Carl really laid on the verse huh?
MATT
(CHUCKLING)
ye ..ye he did. Got me thinking
OUT-
e stops himself.
WILLIS
What?
MATT
I don't know - sort of silly really.
WILLIS
C'mon what is it?
89
MATT
This thing with - with Frank when he was
about three, I guess. We were over at my
folkls house.
MATT
Mom always liked little dogs - this one
was a - Pekingese, I think. I remember
hearing this yelp, and then a scream.
Frank ran out pointing to his finger. I
looked at it couldn't see an thino. Mom
said Frank must have "cornered the dog"
and I knew she was probably right. We
were driving home, and Ruth noticed Frank
itching his a ..she pulled back his
sleeve, and there were these two deep,
bloody, puncture marks...
WILLIS
Why do you think he pointed to his
finger?
Matt shakes his head.
TT
(SEARCHING)
.I cruess he didn't want us to ow.
He stares into his hands, as the memory crystallizes.
Willis looks confused, and somewhat uncomfortable.
WILLIS
He gets up and heads to the bar.
MATT
(TO HIMSELF)
.had to put that dog down.
Willis throws some ice in a tumbler.
WILLIS
I was thinking just the other day about
the last time Frankie was-
Matt cuts him off.
His name was Ar k. Not Frankie.
Willis looks stunned.
WILLIS
.I'm sorry Matt.
I don't care ...he just never liked being
called that.
90
WILLIS
O.K.
Matt nods. He looks away.
MATT
She didn't tell me, Willis. She never
said a word - She saw him at South End.
WILLIS
Christ.
MATT
She's seen him before. It's killing her
I didn't think about bail. I thought I
wouldn't have to worry about him for
YE S-
WILLIS
You know what I heard? He's tending bar
up to Old Orchard Beach.
Matt looks up.
WILLIS
For a friend. Ever notice even the worst
bastards have friends? Nobody knows him
over there. If theydo, they don't care.
They drink what he mixes
Willis sets a can of Moxie down in front of Matt.
WILLIS
(referring to the can)
I don't know how you drink this stuff
it's what drove me to beer as a child.
He sits down with his own drink.
A moment.
WILLIS
I hate him, Matt. My boys went to school
with h He was the same thei.,- Know
what he' 11 do? Five at the most - And
then you' 11 e bumping into h all over
AGAIN
I ow.
WILLIS
Remember that woman about seven years
a o? Shot her husband sopped him of f
t e bridge in the St - Gac-: with a
hundred pound sack of cement and said the
whole way through it nobody helped her.
Know where she is now? She's in Sears ort
now, a secretary. And whoever helped her,
where the hell is he?
91
WILLIS
it'd break my heart Matt, it would, but -
you ever think about just - moving away?
Matt nods. Stares into his hands for a long time.
MA,TT
yeah, we have.
Finally, he looks up, his eyes meeting Willis I s.
MATT
It wouldn't matter.
THE SOUND OF A LONE F VOICE - SINGING
The voice is joined by another and becomes a duet. We turn to
find the voices and see we are at the foot of a small knoll.
A steeple in the distance pokes thorough the last blue husk
as the sun dies. Looking around we see an ancient gazebo -
then stairs leading up to a stone library - A boulder at the
foot of another knoll - above - descending toward us -
The girls, each holding a single candle,dressed in brightly
embroidered smocks, enter in procession singing -Jennie Mae
Mama. "
The effect is beautiful and feels like a sort of quickening.
The group proceeds down the hill and blossoms into an -
AMPHITHEATER which faces the harbor. Ruth stands at the
bottom of the proscenium - her arms up - directing the choir.
The place is filled with half the town.
ANGLE MATT
Trying to take it all in. But not really present.
Suddenly he turns and leaves.
The town goes to sleep for the night. The signs businesses
power down.
EXT- PETER'S NIGHT
The establishment's various Beer Signs & interior lights turn
off.
A LARGE CHAIN OF KEYS Turns the tumbler of a deadbolt lock.
Two cars are all that's left.
A WAITRESS emerges from the bar. Richard is fast on her heels.
He exits, making conversation as he quickly locks the doors.
92
RIC
Hey -o- wait up.
WAITRESS
Good night, Richard. See ya tomorrows
She starts to walk to her car- He catches up to her,
accompanying her to her car.
RIC
You want to come over for a drink? Just a
drink.
She stops in front of her car.
WAITRESS
No, thanks. Maybe some other night.
He stands in front of his Brown Suburban, watching as the
Waitress gets in her car, pulls away and leaves.
RICHARD
Fuckin' bitch.
He turns and freezes.
Matt Fowler stands a few feet away, an Ortaies calibre
7.65 automatic directly at Richard's face. His gloved hand poin
grips the gun tightly.
RICHARD
Dr. Fowler?
MATT
Don't talk. Unlock it and get in.
RIC
He . wait a minute. Let's, let's just
calm down...
Matt COCKS the gun.
RIC
Alright! Shit.
Richard obeys. He unlocks both doors.
Matt opens the back door, but stays planted, the gun trained on
Richard.
Richard gets in the driver's seat. Matt climbs in the back.
He presses the gun's muzzle against the back of Richard's head.
V 0-,
MATT
Is there any one at your place?
RIC
(IRONICALLY)
NOT TONIGHT
93
MATT
Good. Drive there.
Richard looks over his shoulder to back the car up.
Matt aims at his temple, but does not look at his eyes.
Richard finishes backing up and puts it into drive.
MATT
Drive slowly - don't try to get stopped.
Matt can see the ocean. He uncocks the revolver.
Matt cracks the window.
Matt leans down in his seat. He transfers the gun into his
left hand, removes the glove from his right, and wipes the
sweat from his bare palm onto his pantleg. He puts the glove
back on, gripping the gun.
Richard's Brown Suburban drives down an alley adjacent to Fun
Park and turns onto a deserted Main Street.
They drive back through town, the sea wall on their left hiding
the beach.
on the right are the places, most with their neon signs off,
that do so much business in s er: the lounges and cafes and
pizza houses. The street itself empty of traffic.
RICHARD
He was making it with my wife.
His voice is careful, not pleading.
Matt presses hard with the muzzle against Richard's head.
Richard flinches and moves his head forward.
Matt lowers the gun to his lap.
MATT
Don-t talk.
The Brown Suburban slowly pulls up to the front.
Matt leans forward. Th. muzzle grazing Richard's head.
Drive it to the back.
91+
RIC
You wouldn't have it cocked, would you?
For when I put on the brakes.
Matt COCKS it.
It is now.
Richard tenses. He drives around the side of the building.
The Brown Suburban inches forward toward the garage and
brakes. The engine shuts off.
Matt keeps the cocked gun firmly trained on Richard. He gets
out and shuts the door with his hip.
MATT
All right.
Richard looks at the gun, then gets out. He moves across the
grass.
Matt closely behind, looking at the row of small backyards on
either side of them and scattered tall trees.
He glances from house to house. Looking for signs of one
insomniac neighbor, some man or woman sitting alone watching
the all-night channel from Boston. All is quiet.
They move up the back walk and to the side kitchen door.
Matt stands directly behind Richard as he opens the door.
It-s pitch black inside the duplex.
MATT
Turn on the light.
Richard flips the wall switch.
in the light.
Matt stares at his wide back, and long reach.
I NT. RICHARD S TROUT'S DUPLEX - KITCHEN NIGHT
Richard stops just inside the kitchen. Matt closes the door
softly behind gim.
MATT
Where-s you r suitcase?
Richard almost turns around.
RIC
My suitcase?
95
Matt grips the gun tighter, straining to keep it from
ling.
MATT
Where is it?
RIC
in the bedroom closet.
MATT
That's where were going then. When we get
to a door you stop and turn on the light.
They cross the kitchen.
Matt can't help but glance at the sink and stove and
refrigerator: no dishes in the sink or even the dish rack
beside it, no grease splashings on the stove, the refrigerator
clean and white.
Matt becomes momentarily 2reoccupied with one of Duncan's
drawings taped to its door.
MATT
Wait.
Richard stops.
Matt looks conflicted. Doubt has crept into his face For a
moment he seems to have lost his resolve.
RICHARD O.S.
(IRRITATED)
.Jesus.
Matt looks to Richard with a renewed sense of purpose.
TT
.keep going.
LIVING ROOM
A light flicks on. They take the hall past the living room.
Matt doesn't want to see anymore of Richard's life. But he
can't help h elf. He takes it all in: Magazines and
newspapers in a wicker basket, clean ashtrays, a stereo,
CD's neatly shelved next to it.
They continue down a hallway.Richard stops outside a door.
RIC
There's no wall switch.
MATT
Where's the light?
RIC
the bed.
96
Let's go.
Richard steps into the darkness. Matt is careful to stay a
pace behind. Richard leans over by the bed. Matt braces.
lick. A small bedside lamp turns on.
The bed, a double one, is neatly made; the ashtray on the
bedside table clean the bureau top dustless and no
photographs- prob ly so the girl - who is scae? - won't have
to see Natalie in the bedroom she believes is theirs. But
because Matt is a father and a husband, thou h never ex-
husband, he knows (and does not want to ow that this
bedroom has never been theirs alone.
Richard turns around; Matt looks at his lips, his wide jaw.
RICHARD
I wanted to work things out with her.
Try to get together with her again.
But I couldn't even talk to her.
He was always with her.
Dr. Fowler, I'm going to jail for it.
I am going to jail. If I ever get out
I'll be an old man. Isn't that enough ?
MAXT
You're not going to jail.
Pack clothes for warm weather.
RIC
What's going on? You're not gonna let me
go!
Matt looks away. He doesn't answer.
RICHARD
Dr. Fowler?
MATT
You're jumping bail.
RIC
.Dr. Fowler.
Matt points the pistol at Richard's face. The barrel trembles
a little.
Richard reaches up into his closet and pulls out two large
canvas bags. He places them on the - He pulls a third
bag, a small, red, woman's suitcase, Natalie's no doubt, next
to the others.
He moves to the bureau.
MATT
It's the trial. We can't go through that,
my wife and me. So you're leaving. I've
got you a ticket. My wife keeps seeing
you. I can't have that anymore...
97
RIC
He was making it with my wife.
I'd go pick up my kids and he'd be there.
Sometimes he spent the night. Duncan
told me.
He doesn't look at Matt as he speaks. He opens the to

underwear and the socks rolled, the underwear folded and
stacked. Richard arranges them neatly in the suitcase. The
kitchen the livin room the clothes. Matt is struck b
this man's sense of order, o iscio ine.
Matt watches the absurdity of Richard sorting clothes by
season. He even packs a small instamatic camera. He packs
the things a man accumulates and become part of him.
MATT
(re: the suitcases)
Okay, that's enough.
RICHARD
I need some things from the bathroom.
MATT
alright.
THE BATHROOM
Richard steps just inside the bathroom door and stops.
MATT
Keep going.
RICHARD
Gotta pee.
Matt realizes Richard means to have privacy.
He pushes him into the room. Takes a step back and pulls the
door so it is only slightly ajar. He keeps his foot between
the jam and the door.
He eyes Richard's back reflected in the mirror. He can hear
him make water. He looks like he wonders about allowing this
courtesy.
Mattes glances at:
A picture on the wall outside of the bathroom: Natalie
Richard and their two boys, in front of someone's house.
Smiling. She looks happy.
C
looks around the room frantically - his eyes find nothing
that will help his situation - he flushes the toilet - Matt
swings the door fully open - Richard fills a travel kit with
toiletries.
98
RICHARD'S BEDROOM
Richard tucks the travel kit into a bag. Matt keeps the gun
on him.
Richard closes the suitcase, and faces Matt. He looks at the
Matt moves around behind him. Now Richard is between Matt
and the lighted hall. Richard carries a canvas bag in each
hand. Matt pulls another glove from his pocket. He uses it
to turn off the bedside lamp. Richard now d'_lhouetted in
the doorway.
Let's go.
Richard steps into the hall. Matt follows, carrying the small
suitcase in one hand, the gun in the other.
They start down the hallway. Matt turns off lights with his
elbow as they go. Past the living room into the kitchen.
Wait.
Richard tenses, he stops at the kitchen door.
Matt sets the suitcase down. He uses that hand to reach into
his jacket. He pulls out a red, white, and blue piece of
paper. He drops it on the counter top. Words on the paper
read AMT RACK.
Matt picks up the suitcase again. He steps closer to him.
Presses the gun into Richard's back.
MATT
open the door.
Richard's reaches down and carefully turns the knob. He
slowly pulls the door open. Matt takes a step back.
MATT
Get the light.
Richard reaches down and hits the switch. Click. The two men

Richard exits first. Matt close behind.
Matt sets the case down, reaches bacjcan gently closes the

Richard drops the two bags near the rear bumper.
99
Matt keeps the gun steady as Richard pops open the hatch and
loads the bags. Matt sets the small suitcase at Richard's feet.
He reaches down and loads it last.
Richard gets into the driver's seat. Matt in the back.
Richard looks up in the rear-view. For a moment, Matt connects
with the desperate eyes.
RIC
They'll catch me. They'll check passenger
lists.
MATT
I didn't use your name.
RIC
They'll figure that out too. You think I
wouldn't have done it myself if it was
that easy?
Silence.
He starts it up, slides into reverse. He looks back over his
shoulder as they back down the driveway. Matt averts his stare.
Looking down at the gun barrel but not at the profiled face
beyond it.
MATT
You were alone. We've got it worked out.
RIC
.who's we?
Good estion. Matt doesn't answer though. Richard shifts
into drive.
The Brown Suburban pulls out of the lot and onto the street.

They'll take you to the airport - turn on
the radio. Find the game.

RIC
It's after three
MATT
They run it again.
Matt leans back, quietly uncorking the hammer.
MATT
No more talking.
Richard tries to read Matt s face in the mirror, but it -s now
in shadows. Richard fumbles with the radio, surfing the
stations. Matt is right. The game is on.
Nomar Garcia arra hits a long drive to left with runners in scoring
position "A cinch to collect 200 hits this season."
Richard sets his eyes on the road.
The Brown Suburban heads away from Old orchard, onto a small
two lane rural hi hwayy. The road is flanked on both sides by
open fields, and lonely capes. Few cars on the road.
INT BROWN SUB /WISSC SET BRIDGE
They come up over the high bride over the channel: to the left
the smacking curling white at the breakwater and beyond that
the dark sea and a full moon, and down to the right the small
fishing boats bobbing at anchor in the cove.
Swirling colors from behind catch their attention.
Richard and Matt both look in the rear-view.
A state trooper's car with its gumballs flashing races up in
the distance behind them.
Matt jams the gun into Richard's ribs and slouches down.
MATT
(Trying to stay ca

.BROWN SUBURBAN 73 NORTH JUNCTION
Richard sees the sign for the 73 North. He glances back at
Matt in the rearview mirror. He makes the turn.
The Brown Suburban makes the turn.
I NT. BROWN SUBURBAN - S
Matt & Richard check out their surroundings.
The Brown Suburban drives across a small steel bridge that
covers a salt river. The tires make a low thumping sound on
the grid.
I NT. BROWN SUBURBAN - B Y C ROAD (OWLS HEAD) - NIGHT
They have left the 73 and are driving on a small rural route.
Matt leans forward, the gun rests against the top of Richard's
seat.
He looks around, trying to get a bearing.
MATT
Turn around.
RICHARD
Why?
MATT
We missed it. Turn around. back and
turn in at the last road.
Richard slows, and makes a U-turn.
His lights illuminate
PRIVATE -ROAD and NO HUNTING signs.
He takes a right, onto a dirt road flanked on both sides by fir
trees.
E .DIRT ROAD
We track with the Brown Suburban as fir trees strobe in the
foreground.

RIC
There's nothing back here Dr. Fowler? I
donut understand why you don-t just
MATT
It's for you're car. You don't think we'd
leave it at the airport do you?
MATT WATCHES RIC S LARGE, BIG KNUCKLED HANDS TIGHTEN ON THE WHEEL.
They crawl up the trail, the wheels crunching the gravel, the
headlights shining into the dense woods.
The road seems endless. Richard cringes as they bounce over a
bump.
Both of them eagerly peer beyond the windshield.
Finally, at a great distance, the tiny lit windows of a cabin
come into view. A BLUE CHEVY PICKUP is parked in front of the
place.
MATT
Stop here.
The Brown Suburban crawls to a stop. Richard keeps the engine
running. Matt presses the gun hard against his neck. He
straightens in his seat and looks in the rearview mirror.
Matt's eyes meet his in the glass for an instant before
focusing on the hair at the end of the gun barrel.
TT
Turn it off.
Richard does. The ball game disappears, and the silence is
strangely a anent. He continues to hold the w eel with both
hands. He ooks in the mirror.
RIC
I'll do twenty years, Dr. Fowler,
I'll be fifty-four years old.
MATT
That's two years younger than I
Matt gets out and kcks the door shut. Richard opens his
door. He doesn't move. Just sits in the interior light.
His face now pleading. Matt can see it in his lips.
MATT
Get the bags.
RIC-
(TERRIFIED )
Where are we Dr. ?owler?
103
MATT
Almost there.
Richard carefully gets out. Instinctively, he raises his hands
about shoulder level. They move to the back of the Brown
Suburban. Richard pops the hatch.
He pulls out the two canvas bags. He sets them on the ground.
He reaches in and pulls out the small suitcase.
We hear a SCREEN DOOR slam shut. Richard looks surprised.
He turns back to Matt.
C'mon now.
Richard reaches down and picks up the bags. He struggles to
carry all three.
Matt grabs the small suitcase from him.
MATT
That way.
Richard lugs the bags toward the cabin.
We hear HEAVY CRUNCHING FOOTSTEPS OF SOMEONE APPROACHING.
Richard stops.
WILLIS APPEARS FROM DOWN THE PATH.
He nods to Matt.
RIC
Mr. Grinnel?
WILLIS
I'll get them, son.
Willis takes the bags from Richard, turns, and carries them up
the long path back to the cabin.
RICHARD LOOKS S r E' RELIEVED.
He waits a moment, u-sure of what to do.
Finally, he starts wal'-.ing up the path after Willis.
1
Wait.
Richard stops, d-step. He tenses, waiting.
MATT
You can carry this one.
Richard turns.
LO
He reaches out to take the bag from Matt.
Matt keeps it at his side, and takes a step back, his gun
trained on Richard.
RICHARD CONNECTS WITH TT'S EYES.
KNOWS.
Wide and dark, lap ing softly at the bank, a small island near
it's middle, with black, tall evergreens.
Matt, gun in hand, takes two steps back, he strides with the
throw and goes to one knee as he follows through. The dark
shapeless object arcing downward, splashing.
T DIRT ROAD, T BROWN SUBURBAN.
Matt in the Brown Suburban, is stopped behind the wooden
and arm, Willis in his own car behind. The swing bridge is
open for the 5:00a.m. fishing boats. The operator uses his
long metal tool, the bridge swings back around. The arm
rises.
MATT
Seems somewhere else.
WILLIS
WILLIS
(ANGRY)
C'mon g M tt.

Matt drives the Brown Suburban over the bridge. The operator
gives him a friendly nod. Waves to Willis in the Ford.
Willis's truck & Richard's S travel towards us away from
Wiscasset. On their way to Cheesy Town Island.
I NT. FORD - OLD ORCD STATION - PRE-DAWN
Willis watches out his windshield as the Brown Suburban parks
in the stations lot.
Matt gets out of the Brown Suburban and locks the drivers door. Be walks
the Ford, and gets in the passenger side. They drive off.
/EXT- WISSC SET BRIDGE - S
Willis's car moves slowly over the channel bridge, back to
Wiscasset.
Matt rolls down his window. Be tosses Richards keys over the side of
the brad e . The trim shapes of lobster boats and smal craft anchored
in t he hExbor below, loo like old toys in a bathtub,
He rolls up the window as the car continues across.
Both men silent, lost in thought, staring out the windshield at
the road ahead.

WILLIS
{SOFTLY)
What time is it?
Matt checks his watch.
MATT
Ten to six. We lost an hour. Sorry.
Willis's jaw tightens.

Yep...high tide. Can't stop people from

Willis looks at Matt. He knows. Eyes back to the road.

Stopped in to his little shed there once

PAST -
AWEEN ARCH
The Ford pulls up to the curb. Matt gets out.
Willis drives away.
Matt starts walking.
The STREET LIGHTS suddenly turn off',.
The world is waking up now.
In the distance, Matt can see his house.
The birds all seem to wake at once.
Matt gazes up into the trees overhead, the first light just
kissing their branches, the sky now a husky blue. The
surrounding houses with the windows still dark, asleep.
He picks up his pace.
I NT. FOWLER HOUSE - B.
Matt enters.
T LAUNDRY ROOM - S
He roves his tennis shoes, his pants, he starts unbuttoning
his shirt. Now in his T-shirt and boxers, he examines his
clothes and shoes carefully, before putting them into the
washer - He pours detergent inside - and starts the cycle.
He steps to a little sink and washes up.
DINING ROOM
The light has been left on, he kills it and heads upstairs.
UPSTAIRS - S.
Matt slowly walks down the hall, to
BEDROOM -S
And stands in the doorway. He pauses, seeing only
the orange ember of Ruth's cigarette, in the dark.

RUTH
(UNSEEN)
Did you do it?
He doesn-t answer. He walks in and comes to bed, climbing in as
Ruth moves over.
RUTH
Are you all right?
He lies down. FACES THE WINDOW, AWAY FROM HER.
She is on her side, she props herself up on her elbow -
watching him.
He waits a longtime before speaking
MATT
There was a picture with Natalie and the
boys hanging on his wall -
Ruth looks at him strangely.
RUTH
(GENTLY)
.what is it, Matt?
MATT
- the way she was smiling.
RUTH
What?
MATT
I don't know -
Ruth looks at the back of Matt's head.
RUTH
Matt?
He doesn't move. He says nothing else.
She continues to stare at him.
Uncertainty beginning to form on her face. She looks lost. If only
things cou d be as t ey were.
Then.
RUTH
at I thinking - you must be hungry.
She waits for a response, but gets e. She gets out of bed,
leaves the room and heads down stairs.
LONG EMPTY WAY.
WE EEAR RUTH downstairs in the kitchen.

RUTH 0. S.
Matt?
Matt just lies there, in another world.
RUTH
Matt dear, do you want coffee?
Be doesn't respond. Instead he looks at his finger.
The bandage wet from washing up.
He slides it off easily, like oversized ring.
The skin has healed.
LATER NOW
Sun light creeps in through the curtains, onto Matt's face.
Ruth lies sleeping on his chest.
A breakfast tray at his bedside which he hasn't touched
Matt is cede awake. He stares at the ceiling Reliving it
His eyes full of an unspeakable sadness.
The lids heavy. If only he could sleep.
But he won't. Not today.
There is a small crack in the ceiling.
He'll have to fix that.
