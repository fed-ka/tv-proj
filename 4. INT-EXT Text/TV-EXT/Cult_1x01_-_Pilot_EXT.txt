      Foggy.  HEADLIGHTS strobe between tree trunks.  Collins'
      LAPD SEDAN bounces madly down a barely-existent dirt road.


      The next morning.  We're CLOSE on a billboard advertising
      "CULT".  Featuring a distinctive, insanity-inspired BOX
      DRAWING (the show's logo - and our show's logo, too).  Jagged
      psycho letters announce:  "Weds nights 10pm on ABC".

      PAN TO:  the Strand in sunny, colorful SoCal.  In direct
      contrast to the billboard. 

      CUTS:  ROLLERBLADERS, SUNBATHERS, VOLLEYBALLERS.  Young,
      carefree.  The "real" world -- blissfully unaware that there
      could ever be anything unseen out there that's dark and
        unexpectedly dangerous...

      And we find ourselves in front of the funky, faded-pastel
      offices of:  The Word.  The beach community's decades-old
      local paper.


      CLOSE on that same insanity-inspired box - this time it's
      the official "CULT" logo, posted on a SOUNDSTAGE DOOR. 
      Beneath it:  CLOSED SET - PRODUCTION I.D. MANDATORY.

      WIDER - CREW & CAST, wearing photo badges, wander in and out
      of the open stage doors.

                                    SKYE (O.S.)
                    -- Mr. Fisher!

      And we PICK UP -- SKYE YARROW, late 20s, smart-cute, laptop
      case over her shoulder, morning Starbucks in hand, hurrying
      in to work.  She has called out to GARY FISHER, 45, the show's
        Co-Executive Producer, reading script pages as he walks.

                                      FISHER
                    'Morning, Skye.  You're in early
                    this morning.

                                    SKYE
                    Yeah, I've got some research for the
                    art department I need to get in.

                                      FISHER
                    How's the job working out for you?

                                    SKYE
                    Second week and I couldn't be happier. 
                    Already I've done deep background on
                    several truly twisted aberrant cult-
                      psychology studies.  I'm in total
                    heaven...

      Skye's interest in all-things-creepy is in direct contrast
      to her straight-forward, bright-eyed good looks.

                                      FISHER
                    Well, glad you're happy.

      He turns to walk away.  But there's something on Skye's mind
      this morning.  And when she's got something on her mind, she
      has a hard time restraining herself.  She just kind of moves
      along beside him.  Fisher looks over--

                                      FISHER
                    Is there something else?

                                    SKYE
                    Well, actually... yeah...

      Fisher is really trying to read those script pages, only

                    are amazing and cool and fun.  But
                    then there are... the other ones.

                    Yes, but these hard-to-get-into sites --
                    the people who post seem to have
                    some sort of -- of special connection
                    to the show.  Some of them actually
                    seem kinda...

                    Scared?  Scared of what exactly?

                    The show.  Other fans.  Maybe both. 
                    I'm not really sure...

      Now Fisher fully regards her -- but his look says he's
      wondering if maybe she's a little meshuga.  Skye reads his
      look, quickly backpedals a little--

                                    SKYE
                    I just thought, you know, that we

                    Skye... I appreciate your initiative.

      Skye actually opens her mouth to say something more.  But
      catches herself.  Fisher smiles -- glad that she gets it. 
      He moves off. 

      HOLD on Skye -- part of her is pissed at herself for bugging
      her boss like this.  But she still can't shake this feeling
      of hers...

                    night and I -- I think they're after

      fear.

                    That car... the orange one...

      Jeff turns, SEES it down in the pier parking lot:  an orange
      Plymouth Valiant (identical to the one we saw in our opening
      scene, in the "CULT" TV show).  The windshield facing this
      way, though we can't see who -- if anybody -- is inside.

                          (a sigh)
                    Okay, so who's in the car...?

      Nate just backs away, afraid of that car.  Jeff watches as
      the car drives slowly away.  No evidence it had anything to
      do with Nate.

      He's had it.

                    these obsessions of yours too many
                    times.  Not this time.  No.

      Nate rushes to Jeff and shoves something into his hands. 
      Jeff looks.  Bizarre.  It's:  a pair of old-fashioned red/blue
      3-D GLASSES.

                    Just take them!  You -- you might

      Jeff stares at the glasses, then at Nate.  We can tell this
      is very hard for Jeff, but he turns -- and just keeps walking.

      realizes the scream was just a fun squeal.  Then, loud--

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hey you!

      Jeff looks around--

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Yeah, I'm talking to you.

      And Jeff realizes the voice is coming from -- the GAS PUMP
      TV SCREEN.  The SCREEN is full of STATIC.  Then -- JAGGED
      CUTS of NIGHTMARE IMAGES.  Then -- PSYCHO LETTERING flashes
      madly.  "CULT".  It's a promo for the show.

      Jeff stares. 

      A MAN'S FACE pops on.  Piercing eyes that appear to be staring
      right at Jeff.  With a chilling smile.  His voice mesmerizing--

                                      BILLY (ON TV)
                    My name is Billy.  Billy Grimm. 
                    People say I'm dangerous.  Me?  I'm
                      completely... harmless...

      More NIGHTMARE IMAGES culled from the show.  Jeff stares--

                                      BILLY (ON TV)
                    But my followers?  Can't really vouch

                    in your very own family.

      Just a coincidence, but the way he says this, seemingly
      looking directly at Jeff, it's freaky.

      Then CAMERA jumps in on Billy as he stares out and says--

                                      BILLY (ON TV)

      Jeff can't help but get a little pang.  Sure, it's just a TV
      promo.  But -- holy shit. 

                                    JEFF
                    Wow Nate... this is the show you're
                    into...?

      Jeff puts the gas nozzle back, climbs into his car.


      On a small side street in Hermosa Beach.  Jeff hurries up to
      Nate's apartment, still trying the phone.  Nate still isn't
      answering.  Ready to ream his brother, Jeff reaches Nate's
      door -- and pauses.  The door is already ajar.  Jeff frowns.  


      After midnight.  A couple of COP CARS in front now.


      Billy Grimm crouches, pleasantly engaging one of the happy
      TODDLERS who are part of the tapestry that is Billy's
      Compound. 

      The compound itself is a large clearing among the lush
      greenery of Topanga Canyon.  The buildings are different-
      sized and aged trailers.  Billy's faithful FOLLOWERS, ages
      17-70, tend gardens, hang out wash. 

      Billy himself is about 40, sinewy -- his lined, tanned face
      brimming with humor, intelligence, and, of course, that
      mesmerizing stare.  He wears jeans and a very distinctive
      worn leather vest.  Most disconcerting is the well-used 10-
      inch bowie knife prominent on his belt.

      Billy glances up, and a smile of recognition breaks on his
      face.  Detective Collins walks determinedly toward him.

                                      BILLY
                    Eric.  Ignoring your department's
                      interdiction about not coming
                      physically near me...?

      Collins grabs Billy hard. 

                                      COLLINS
                    Where are they, Billy?

      Billy's Followers instantly turn.  Billy looks at them -- an
      unspoken command.  They start this way to help him.  Collins
      sees this -- knows he's outnumbered.  It takes everything he
      has to pull his hands from Billy.  Billy straightens his
      clothes, looks at Collins with "sincerity" --

                                      BILLY
                    I heard about your wife and son.

                    It's Joey Keller and his group, isn't
                    it?  Joey took my family to protect
                    you.  To get me to stop-- 

                                      BILLY
                    Joey knows how you've made me your
                    own little personal cop mission...

                    Joey took them because he'll do

                    Just as you used to...

      This strikes an unsettling cord in Collins -- exactly the
      cord Billy wanted to strike.

                                      BILLY
                    All those times your parents left

                    Because I know what you're capable
                    of.

      Billy offers just the smallest of smiles.

                                      COLLINS
                    Joey Keller will return my family --
                    if you tell him to.

                                      BILLY
                    Joey is very loyal.  But there are
                    really so many faithful out there
                    now...

      Billy motions towards:  an area of mismatched tables under a
      canvas overhang.  At the tables:  FOLLOWERS working computers. 
      Lots of them.

                                      BILLY
                    What you have to understand is even
                    I have no idea the full number.  The

      Billy's knowing gaze bores into Collins.  Billy truly is

                    We both know how you feel about kids. 
                    How the loss of your own son started

      Billy tenses slightly -- his preternatural calm broken for
      this nanosecond.  Collins has knowingly pushed this hot
      button.  He sees his opening, and--

                                      COLLINS
                    Give me back my family.

      Billy stands there a moment, absorbing this.  Then--

                                      BILLY
                    I wish you all the luck in the world
                    finding them...

      Collins knows Billy isn't going to help.  His expression
      sets.  He's about to turn, when -- Billy reaches into his
      pocket.  Collins stiffens, ready for anything. CULT

      Billy holds out his hand.  Palm down.  Collins looks.  And
      there on the back of Billy's hand is a self-carved BOX TATTOO

      his hand over, to reveal:  a pair of old-fashioned RED/BLUE

                    Excuse me!  Hey!

      Jeff, still a little off-kilter, turns.  Skye is hurrying
      toward him.  She moves up fast.  Then -- doesn't know exactly
      what to say.

      There's something about this that has particular significance
      for Skye.  Now Skye sees something o.s.  Jeff looks.  TWO
      STUDIO SECURITY MEN hurry toward the production office. 
      Thinking fast, Skye grabs Jeff--

                                    SKYE

      HIGH ANGLE of an elaborate crime scene.  LAPD cars, red/blue
      lights swirling, CORONER WAGONS, dozens of COPS and CRIME

      Collins has a hard time masking his anger -- and especially
      his anxiety.  And suddenly something crosses in front of us --
      THE CAMERA.  Riding its JIB ARM.  Now our own ANGLE adjusts
      to reveal--

      The CREW of the "CULT" production unit.  All watching this
      scene from "CULT" being filmed.  A good-sized CLUSTER of
      ONLOOKERS is held back behind sawhorses by SET SECURITY.

      Our CAMERA MOVE takes us past network exec Kyle Segal, who
      is visiting the set -- murmuring into his phone despite the
      fact that the scene is still filming.  The MOVE takes us to--

      -- Skye.  She holds some faxed pages, whispering to the
      director, DEAN, 30s.  He looks at the pages, and calls out
      in frustration--

                    Okay, cut!  Cut it!

      They look around.  There's some painted graffiti on a rock. 
      Skye hands Dean a faxed page, and he shows it to the actors.

                                      ROGER
                    Oh, for the love of--

                    Guess we missed it.

      Skye gives the Supervisor a "Sorry" look.  Segal grabs the
      faxed page, looks at it.  There's a symbol:  the LETTER "M"
      inside a CIRCLE.

                    Who the hell's going to notice the
                    damn rock behind us?

      Matthew glances at the ONLOOKERS behind the sawhorses, many
      of them snapping PHOTOS of the set with their phone cameras.

                    Some'a them, that's who...

                    It's exactly this b.s. I'm going to

      And he throws the paper to the ground.  The actors exchange
      a look -- they know they're being handled.  Skye sees the
      crumpled paper starting to blow away.  She starts for it. 
      When -- her phone rings.

      The majority of onlookers are flashing their photos.  However,
      one YOUNG WOMAN isn't snapping photos -- instead she kneels
      down and scoops up the paper.  As she rises, we SEE it is--

      -- Kirstie.  The Fandomain waitress.  She uncrumples the
      paper, looks at it.  And her eye goes to the actors standing
      with Segal.

      Cameras FLASH all around Kirstie as she simply stares at
      those men.  HOLD, and--

      Dark.  Deserted.  Then -- Jeff's car sweeps past.


      A few middle-class cars, a plumber's truck, parked around.

      Jeff and Skye step from their car.  Suddenly -- SEVERAL PEOPLE
      come rushing from one of the rooms. 

      Many of the MEN are dressed like Billy Grimm.  A few of the
      WOMEN wear Jen's green dress.  But unlike the characters on
      the show, these people are all different ages, sizes, races. 
      Jeff stares -- it's both strange and bizarrely funny at the
      same time.

                                    JEFF
                    Trekkies have nothing on these guys...

      The roleplayers all run toward their cars.  Now Jeff and
      Skye see the panicked look on their faces.  Jeff snags an
      overweight FAUX BILLY GRIMM--

                                    JEFF
                    What's the matter-- ?

      The Faux Billy Grimm just looks scared, leaps into his car. 
      The cars are all racing away.  Jeff and Skye regard the open
      door to that room.  It's dark inside.

      Jeff and Skye exchange a look.  And slowly ease toward that
      door.

      The door is ajar.  Jeff notes:  it's Room #5 -- same as in
      the show.  Bitter irony.  They hear a WOMAN'S FRIGHTENED
      WHIMPERING.

                                    JEFF
                    Hello?  Are you all right in here...?

                                    SKYE
                    Do you need help?

      No answer -- just more FRIGHTENED WHIMPERING.  Jeff and Skye
      exchange another look.  Then Jeff steps tentatively over the
      threshold.  Skye follows...


      Jeff and Skye walk into the parking lot.  Both still wearing
      the effects of what they've been through.

                                    JEFF

                    You didn't drag me into it...

      Jeff shakes his head.  He's truly baffled.  But he also knows--

                                    JEFF
                    Whatever it is, Nate's right in the
                    middle of it.  That is, if he's even
                    still...

      He doesn't let himself finish the thought.

                                    SKYE
                    So what are you going to do now?

                                    JEFF
                    Just keep searching.  I have to.  If
                    Nate's still out there, I need to
                    find him.  I'm all that he's got.

      They've reached a waiting car.  We see Lexi behind the wheel.

                                    JEFF
                    Listen.  Thanks for -- you know.

                            finding a shred of
                            gallows humor)
                    You sure know how to show a girl an

      Jeff offers his own small smile.  Their eyes hold a moment. 
      Then -- Skye climbs into the car.  Jeff starts away.


      A fog diffuses the narrow street near Jeff's rented place,
      eerily isolating:  Skye, outside her car, checking a hastily-
      scribbled address in her hand.  A figure emerges from the
      fog, approaching fast.  It's -- Jeff.

                                    JEFF
                    You came.

                                    SKYE
                    You didn't think I would?

                                    JEFF
                    You didn't have to. 
                          (beat)
                    I don't mean to keep involving you--

                                    SKYE
                    I'm already involved.  I work on
                    this show.  And until I fully
                      understand what's really going on,
                    and who's behind it, I'm as alone in
                    all of this as you are.

      Jeff regards her.  But that clearly isn't her only reason. 
      Her voice softens--

                                    SKYE
                    And I know...  there is nothing worse
                    in the world than losing someone you
                    love... and never knowing what really
                    happened to them...

      Jeff realizes she's talking about the disappearance of her
      father.  Skye meets his eye, and--

                                    SKYE
                    So -- where is it?

      HOLD, and--


      We're CLOSE ON a different RED LIGHT.  This one on a cop
      car.  WIDEN.  Several PD cars line a grungy alley.  That
      disquieting fog is here tonight, too.

      Detective Sakelik has just arrived.

                                      DETECTIVE ON DUTY
                    Trash guys found it thirty minutes
                    ago.

      A CSI WOMAN is working an open dumpster.  Sakelik looks: 
      inside is a BODY.  ASIAN MALE, 35.  He's wearing one of the
      red t-shirts with the Box graphic.  His face ghostly pale,
      left leg of his jeans ripped and soaked with blood.

                                      SAKELIK
                    So tell me--

                                    CSI WOMAN
                    Dead maybe forty-eight hours.  Massive
                    blood loss.  Looks like an open
                    femoral.  Blood dropped out fast. 
                    But it didn't happen here.

                                      DETECTIVE ON DUTY
                    Didn't you catch a call recently
                    where there was a ton of blood and
                    no body...?

      Sakelik stares down at the body.

                                      SAKELIK
                    Yeah... good bet this one's connected. 
                    Better let me handle this case, too. 
                    Cuz we already have a direction on
                    that other one.

                    We're looking at the brother...


      Foggy here, too.  Network exec Kyle Segal exits one of the
      clubs.  Feeling like master of his universe.  He hustles
      across the street, past the AM/PM gas station where we saw
      Jeff earlier.  We GLIMPSE the Billy Grimm PROMO playing on
      the multiple PUMP TVs as Segal moves past the station.


      Segal enters this small lot behind the AM/PM.  Apparently
      deserted at this hour.  Segal is almost to his Porsche. 
      When --

      A very hot YOUNG WOMAN, in sexy black club clothes, seems to
      appear from nowhere.  Stumbling drunkenly.  Segal is surprised
      as -- she trips.  Literally falling into his arms. 

                                      SEGAL
                    Whoa!

      She looks up into Segal's eyes.  It's Kirstie.  Segal smiles
      his smarmiest smile at this very cute, very drunk, young
      woman.  And, suddenly -- a DARK FIGURE engulfs the distracted
      Segal from behind.


      -- and continues PULLING BACK to reveal:  the orange Valiant. 
      Parked on this deserted street.  And as it fires up and glides
      unhurriedly away... we SUPER:
