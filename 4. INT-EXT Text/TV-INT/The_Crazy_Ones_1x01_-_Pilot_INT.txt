      fifties, brilliant, vibrant, a genius, and a bit out of
      his mind.  On a fast move with them are art directors
      ANDREW KENNEDY, thirty-two, neurotic, nebbishy, and
      LAUREN SLOTSKY, twenties, easygoing, sexy.

                    How do you know this, if they met
                    with Chiat, they must-- why else--
                    do you know the pitch?

                                        SIMON
                    Hum a few bars.

      SYDNEY SNORTS, grabs him, stops him.

                    Dammit, Dad.

                                        SIMON
                    Honey,
                          (relax)
                    Trix are for kids.  Not sure why I
                    said that, could be Freudian, my
                    mother took away my Trix when I hit
                    puberty, whereas my sister at that
                    age got to start turning them, life's
                    not fair, don't you agree? 

      She stomps her foot on his.

                                        SIMON (CONT'D)
                          (simply)
                    That was violent.

                    Now you listen to me right now.

      As she spots Lauren, fighting a giggle--

                    Stop it.

                                        SIMON
                    Indeed. 

                                        SYDNEY
                    So what exactly do you plan to say
                    to them?

                                        SIMON
                    No idea, I only know what I'll tell
                    myself.

                                        SYDNEY
                    Which is what?

                                        SIMON
                    "Leap.  And the net shall appear."

      SYDNEY MAKES A LITTLE SNORT SOUND, it's a nervous tic
      caused by panic.

                                        SYDNEY
                    I am going in there to buy you
                    another thirty seconds.  During
                    which time you will suck it up,
                    enter, and pitch the Authenticity
                    campaign exactly as we prepared it. 
                    Got it?

                                        SIMON
                    I do.  Enter.  Pitch.  Suck.  Is
                    the order important?

      As Lauren fights another smile, Sydney freezes her again. 
      Then, to the others--

                                        SYDNEY
                    Let's go.

      She shoots one more look at Simon for good measure. 
      Zach, Sydney, and Andrew enter the conference room; as
      Simon holds back, Lauren sees the doubt on his face.

                                        LAUREN
                          (to Simon; simply)

                                        SIMON
                    Beg pardon?

                                        LAUREN
                    My grandfather told me that smelling
                    a young woman's shampoo was life-
                      affirming, it awakened romance,
                    boosted confidence, whatever.  Smell
                    'em?

                                        SIMON
                    It might be best.

      He gives her head a deep snort, as we: 

                                                              CUT TO:



      SIX MCDONALD'S EXECUTIVES, suits, stern, sit along one
      side of a long conference table.  HANNAH SHARPLES, fifty,
      handsome, formidable, sits center; she's clearly the
      alpha male.  And she does not look pleased.  We can
      feel the tension as our Team enters and sits.  Simon
      then enters, tries his best to lube up the room.

                                        SIMON
                    Good morning, everybody.  I should say
                    "Good McMorning," how we doing Steve,
                    Cindy; Hannah, Hannah, Hannah, sexy as
                    ever.  I so love it when you shoot me
                    that little un-smile of yours, y'know I
                    was in on the 7-Up Uncola campaign, I
                    love "un," you actually ooze it, and I
                    so adore your un-smile, could I have
                    one more please?

      A MUTED SNORT FROM SYDNEY.

                                        HANNAH
                    Simon.  I have something to say. 
                    And I'm afraid this is rather
                      difficult.

      Silence.  The room is frozen.

                                        SIMON
                    "You're fired."  Is that what you
                    came to say?  That's the rumor
                    anyway, Zach sleeps around, he hears
                    things, I'm sure he's slept with
                    some of us here today, show of hands,
                    how many have slept with Zach?

      As Lauren's hand begins to move, SYDNEY grabs it.

      Hannah and Simon stare at each other, this is a
        longstanding relationship.

                                        SIMON (CONT'D)
                    Have you come to fire us, Hannah?

      A long beat which nearly confirms it.  Then--

                                        HANNAH
                          (giving him the rope
                          to hang himself)
                    Why don't you share the Authenticity
                    campaign with us.

      Ugh.  That sounded fatal.  A beat.

                                        SIMON
                      Certainly.

      HE PICKS UP THE REMOTE, stares at the big black screen on
      the wall.  He might as well be staring at a blank page,
      which Sydney detects.  SIMON THEN ACTIVATES THE SCREEN: A
      BUNCH OF FAST-SHIFTING IMAGES AS HE SCROLLS THROUGH.

                                        SIMON (CONT'D)
                    Okay, let's see, I know it's in

                    I so love those old Fed-Ex

                    The gem, actually.  The gem in that
                    spot... nevermind how entertaining
                    it was, or funny, the "nugget" was
                    that it communicated a singular
                    idea that resonated with the
                    consumer.  Speed.  Federal Express. 
                    "When it absolutely, positively has

                      precision.  What's your idea, Hannah? 
                    Does McDonald's have one?  Is it

      An awkward beat.  Sydney stares: "Where is he going

                    A special feeling inside.

      SIMON STOPS THE TAPE.  The lyrics, music, and images
      speak for themselves.  It is a very human, very touching
      piece.

                    A father and son, playing touch
                    football on the front lawn. 
                      Interacting in a way that we all
                    used to when times were a bit slower.

                          (holding up his
                            cellphone)
                    In a time before these fucking 
                    gadgets took over our universe.

      He flings his cellphone sideways.  ZACH, seemingly
      without looking, CATCHES IT CLEANLY WITH ONE HAND; yet
      another of Zach's talents which privately annoy Andrew.

                                        SIMON (CONT'D)
                    Imagine if we were to take these
                    very lyrics, upgrade the images,
                    and combine them with the voice of,
                    say, someone like Mariah Carey. 
                    Can you imagine?
                          (a beat; then)
                    The refrain of that 1972 spot was
                    "You deserve a break today."  There
                    is simply no message more consumer-
                    relevant in 2013.  In this economy...
                    people need a break.  They deserve
                    one, by God.  They've earned one.

                    shall stir their hearts.  We will
                    make them feel, we will connect our
                    product with their souls.  And we
                    shall all be the richer for it in
                    the end, you know why?  Because
                    we're going to sell a shitload of

      Simon winks.  We see A FEW OF THE EXECUTIVES SMILE.

      FADE IN:



      Sydney, Andrew, Lauren, and Zach.  Throughout the
      following, Andrew is taking measure of Sydney, reading
      her.

                                        SYDNEY
                    I don't care that he pulled it off. 
                    He basically went into a meeting
                    with our biggest client and he was
                      unprepared.  It was beyond reckless.

                                        LAUREN
                    I thought he was kinda funny.

                                        SYDNEY
                    It was not funny.

                                        LAUREN
                          (whatever)
                    Okay.

                                        ZACH
                    Look, Syd, that was magic he just
                    pulled off, it was high-wire art
                    and if he can be that creative, who
                    are we to second--

                                        SYDNEY
                            (rapid-fire)
                    Creative in our business is not
                    art, Zach, it is not clever, creative
                    is what sells, it's moving product,
                    creative is "Head-on, apply directly
                    to the forehead;" it's "I can't
                    believe it's not butter;" "Nationwide
                    is on your side,"
                            (escalating)
                    driving the message into the greatest
                    number of heads at the least possible
                    cost, that's creative and the fucking
                    devil has hijacked my mouth.

      Upon which, she ducks into a soundproof booth -- known
      as the "Scream Room" -- and SHE SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF
      HER LUNGS, which WE SEE BUT DO NOT HEAR.  She then re-
      emerges, now with some self-control.

                    Sorry.  Values-check completed. 
                    Where was I?

      As Simon charges in.

                                        SIMON
                    How do I look?  It's important.

                                        SYDNEY
                    How do you look?

                                        SIMON
                    Please.

                                        SYDNEY
                    Can I ask you a different question? 
                    Did you have the slightest idea of
                    where you were headed with that
                    Mariah Carey nonsense, or was it--

                                        SIMON
                    I did, and I have a better idea of
                    where I'm going now.

                                        SYDNEY
                    Which is where?

                                        SIMON
                    Lunch with Mariah Carey.  Turns out
                    she's in Chicago, touring, also
                    turns out my agent did hers, don't
                    you just love how what goes around
                    comes around, the world works like
                    a big fungus.

      And off he goes.  A beat. 

                                        ANDREW
                    So let's review.  He basically takes
                    a flying header with this morning's
                    pitch and gets a lunch out of it
                    with Mariah Carey.  What the hell
                    is that?

                                        SYDNEY
                          (weakly; exasperated)
                    That would be his net appearing.

      Simon sits in a corner booth with the one and only...
      MARIAH CAREY.

                                        SIMON
                    It's Sarah Dipity that you happen
                    to be here in Chicago right now,
                    have you met Sarah, she's splendid. 
                          (takes her hand)
                    Such soft hands, do you believe in
                    destiny, Mariah?

                                        MARIAH
                    Not yours, if that's where you're
                    headed.

                                        SIMON
                    That was wit.  I happen to be a big
                    fan of wit, when used responsibly 
                    of course, mine can get unwieldy.  

      As she extracts her hand from his--

                                        MARIAH
                          (polite, but...)
                    Mr. Roberts.  I don't mean to be
                    rude.  Actually, I do.  I'm only
                    sitting at this table because the
                      commercial you pitched to my agent
                    speaks to my massive ego, my core
                      narcissism, and I figure to make
                    heaps of money.  We have a business
                    deal, subject to a creative meeting,
                    this would be that meeting.  You've
                    got two minutes.

                                        SIMON
                      Wonderful, I rarely last longer
                    anyway, this piece is about family,
                    it's about emotion, it's about people
                    coming together in a way--

                                        MARIAH
                    It's about meat.  You want me to
                    sing about meat.

      Sydney with Simon in his office; it's decorated in
      primary colors, including framed iconic one-sheets: 7-

                    Mariah Carey is coming here to record  
                    "You Deserve A Break Today"?

                                        SIMON
                          (high-pitched)

                    Wait.  Wait.  What do you mean
                          (high-pitched)
                      "w-e-e-e-l-l?"  I don't
                    like "w-e-e-e-l-l".

                                        SIMON
                    She's coming to sing.  She just
                    thinks she'll be singing a different
                    song.  Life's a dance, honey.

      Sydney's face clenches.  Then--

                                        SYDNEY
                          (a bad feeling)
                    Exactly what song does she "think"
                    she'll be singing?

                                        SIMON
                    "It Ain't The Meat, It's The Motion." 
                    Also catchy.

      A beat. 

                                        SYDNEY
                    That's a sex song. 

                                        SIMON
                    Isn't it exciting?

                    Don't worry about it, Andrew.  Forget
                    about it.

      SHE then blows her cover with a SNORT.

                    I don't want to.  I feel even worse
                    about never ever talking about it.

      ANOTHER, MUTED SNORT stops him.  She covers her mouth.

                    Wasn't it?

      He winks, smiles, and is gone.

                          (to Simon; re: Zach)
                    You two make quite the team, I must
                    say.

      Simon smiles softly. 

                                        SYDNEY (CONT'D)
                          (softly)
                    I'm sorry, Dad.

                                        SIMON

                    I used to so resent the way Mom
                    would constantly try to change you.

                                        SIMON
                    Oh, sweetie, that's the essence of
                    marriage: find the perfect mate,
                    then insist on change.

                                        SYDNEY
                    And here I am doing the exact same
                    thing.  Trying to make you into
                    something you're not, or... which
                      especially doesn't make sense when
                    it's you who makes this place run.

                                        SIMON
                    That isn't true, you do that.  You
                    don't stop me from being me, honey,
                    you allow for it.  Let's face it.

      A beat. 

                                        SYDNEY
                    Dad.  Do you think what we do here...
                    has any real meaning?

                                        SIMON
                    I don't know.  Kafka said the meaning
                    of life is that it ends, his point
                    being: enjoy it.  Which I think we
                    do.  I get to think wild thoughts,
                    lunch with rock divas, box robots. 
                    Is there more?

                                        SYDNEY
                      I remember the very day I decided
                    my life would have meaning.  I was
                    seven years old,
                          (grabs the keyboard)
                    and you showed me this.

      She pulls up the "Think Different" spot, and IT PLAYS. 
      AS WE SEE THE IMAGES--

                                        RICHARD DREYFUSS (V.O.)
                    Here's to the crazy ones.  The misfits,
                    the rebels.  The trouble-makers.  The
                    round pegs in the square holes...

      SHE THEN FREEZES THE FRAME.

                                        SYDNEY
                          (with a half-laugh)
                    It should've occurred to me that
                    none of the people featured in that
                    Apple ad -- John Lennon, Picasso,
                    Gandhi -- none of them worked in
                      advertising.

      A beat.

                                        SIMON
                    When Steve Jobs saw that spot, he
                    said it told him what Apple should
                    be.  How they should behave.  That
                      commercial inspired Apple, a company
                    that altered the course of the world. 
                    Pretty dramatically.  I could be
                    wrong.  But I'd say the people behind
                    that spot were about something.

      Sydney's clinging to that notion.  It's a touching image,
      a father and daughter... a quiet conversation in relative
      darkness.  Their devotion to each other, the tenderness,
      it's palpable.

                                        SIMON (CONT'D)
                    This man was on the street, begging,
                    with a sign: "I am blind.  Please
                    help."  Nothing in his cup.  Another
                    guy walked up, flipped the sign
                    over, and wrote: "It is spring and
                    I am blind."  The blind man's cup
                    was soon overflowing.  "It is spring
                    and I am blind."  With one sentence,
                    the other guy conjured up the beauty
                    of a blooming flower, the smell of
                      freshly-cut grass, the hope that
                      accompanies so many of our
                      springtimes.  That guy was David
                    Ogilvy.  He was a copy writer.  We
                    do have poets among us, honey. 
                    You're one of them.

                                        SYDNEY
                    You have no idea how desperate I am
                    to believe that.

                                        SIMON
                    Honey.  The question isn't whether
                    life has meaning in the world. 
                    Rather, it's 'does it have meaning
                    to you?'

      IN SIMON'S EYES; she is absolutely the love of his life.

      ANDREW, SIMON, ZACH, AND LAUREN.

      Sydney folds in, sits next to Andrew.

                                        SYDNEY
                    Hey.

                                        ANDREW
                    Hey.

      She takes his hand.

                                        SYDNEY
                    We probably should talk about it.

      SNORT.

                                        ANDREW
                    I'm actually okay.  I re-watched
                      "Broadcast News" and remembered...
                    when Albert Brooks couldn't get
                    Holly Hunter, he went on to marry
                    somebody else, they had three
                    wonderful children.  I figure if he
                    could fake a happy life, so can I.

                            from her)
                    We're good.

      Upon which MARIAH KICKS INTO A MORE SEXUALLY-CHARGED
      VERSION OF THE SONG; SHE MAKES TINA TURNER LOOKS LIKE

      shaking body parts as they go.

      ANGLE SYDNEY AND ANDREW

      as they watch Simon and Zach, Frick and Frack.  Sydney
      just shakes her head in quiet disbelief.

                    What are you thinking?  Tell me.

                    Oh.  I was thinking all this time
                    it's been spring.  And I've been a
                    little blind.
