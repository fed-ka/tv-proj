LABORATORY
underground.
Emma descends on the lift platform; steps into a research lab in retro hi
tech.
Walks past assistants, down long pink and orange steel corridors, Werner von
Braun goes disco.
Nears a door, marked:
"Prospero Project -- Authorized Personnel
Only." Logo with lightning emerging from a cloud.
10
FROM AIRLOCK DOOR
A man enters, older.
In matching leather suit: like an astronaut.
Early 40's, handsome,
charismatic, with swept-back silver-black hair.
His name tag: DR. PETER PEEL.
PETER
Ready, darling?
Peter fixes her name tag: DR. EMMA PEEL; runs a finger down over her breast.
She
smiles.
EMMA
Ready as I'll ever be ...
Mutual erotic, intellectual attraction.
Peter takes her hand and they walk down:
11
LONG CORRIDOR
air-lock doors: a series of sealed chambers inside a hitech Labyrinth --
A man joins them.
A shyer, bespectacled, less handsome version of Peter.
On his name
tag: DR. VALENTINE PEEL -- brother and partner.
In b.g., a countdown starts, ECHOING thru the lab
VALENTINE
Atmospheric pressure checked, antenna ready...
Thermal chamber ready ... Compression module
set ... Temperature control on course between
one and one forty ... Water turbulence steady ...
PETER
Anything else?
Valentine smiles, shrugs --
VALENTINE
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
EMMA
Thanks, Valentine ...
Emma gives him a quick peck on the cheek.
A shy look from Valentine at Emma.
Peter senses
PETER
Just a minute, darling. My brother's a
worry wart. I better have a word ...
Valentine --
Peter takes Valentine over to one side.
Emma checks gauges and dials.
Behind her a
conversation.
Peter returns.
He takes a ring from his finger --
12
CLOSEUP - DIAMOND GEM
on a gold ring.
13
BACK TO SCENE
He slips it onto her finger.
PETER
Something to remember me by.
Peter smiles.
The remark strikes Emma as curious.
But no time to query.
She smiles
back.
He gives her a kiss --
PETER
(checks his watch)
See you in an hour ...
EMMA
One sunny day ...
The countdown ECHOES around them as they separate.
14
IN DISTANCE
Valentine watches her.
15
LAB CHAMBER
Inside a bed of ice, Emma is lowered by hydraulic machine into a steel radioactive
thermal chamber, glowing eerily blue
The effect is very cold.
Frozen.
Numb.
Like a sci-fi Sleeping Beauty, beauty
entombed and sealed in a glass coffin.
Plunged down into a vault.
Opposite her --
In another glass coffin, Peter Peel, is lowered down.
16
FROM EMMA'S POV
The sound of their HEARTBEATS.
Their BREATHING.
BLEEP and PULSE OF
ELECTRONICS.
Thru glass and leather.
Like cerebral sex.
Technological, erotic.
Peter winks at her -- Emma locks longingly at him, as --
17
UP IN CONTROL ROOM
Valentine watches behind glass.
Like a kid excluded from a bedroom.
He attends to
dials.
And to his female assistant --
VALENTINE
(thrilled)
Readings still normal ...
The assistant smiles oddly.
FOCUS ON --
An insignia tattooed on her neck: "X404."
A replicant.
They monitor screens.
A DULL HUM.
18
CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Thru the air ducts the purple cloud starts to billow ... Panic stations! Valentine looks
aghast at the graphs:
all systems fucked, over the intercom --
VALENTINE
Emma, Peter, get out! It's going to explode!
FROM Valentine's anguished face TO Emma's face, as
VALENTINE
Emma ...
27
FROM HER VAULT
Emma undoes the straps, clambers out of her pod
28
ANGLE (IN DREAMLIKE SLOW MOTION)
Emma clambers onto her husband's pod -- in a sequence eternally replayed for her as a
nightmare --
29
BACK TO SCENE
VALENTINE
Get out! Leave him -- ! Emma!
30
RAPID INTERCUTS
The purple smoke enveloping Peter's	pod, soft caresses -- Peter struggling within,
looking at Emma --
EMMA
Peter!
Her leatherclad limbs straddled over his glass coffin.
Her HEARTBEAT sounds ... She
grabs, claws on glass --
Her fist draws back, blam! blam! blam! three deadly blows, Emma SMASHES the pod
cover, it --
Cracks -- splinters -- not breaking -- obscuring his face inside like a spider's web, as
behind her
VALENTINE
Don't wait for him -- he's not --
Breathless, blood smeared on glass, Emma's gashed fist bleeds thru torn leather glove --
twisted mass of flesh and glass -- GROWLING sound growing as:
31
ABOVE GROUND
The voluminous purple cloud being sucked by the antenna...!
32
CLOSEUP ON EMMA'S DIAMOND RING
gleaming thru a tear of blood as she pounds the glass --
33
BACK TO SCENE
PETER
(faint)
Emma ... Emma ...
As a GROWLING sound grows till
BOOM!
An EXPLOSION rocks the vault -- flames burst out -- sound and vision
separate -- Emma hears explosion as a slow moving tear thru her psyche.
A trauma.
34
ANGLE (IN EXTREME SLOW MOTION)
The blast flings Emma back thru space, flying unconscious as if in a dream, floating
backwards in --
A milky way op-art swirl of glass and steel fragments, now -- out of control,
weightless, powerless, as --
The background of sealed doors, white corridors all vanish. A spinning, black void
opens up behind her, as her eyes shut, head falls back --
An orgasmic, dream of near-death, as a CRASH OF MUSIC BEGINS a hip new
version of the "AVENGERS" THEME TUNE --
CREDITS SEQUENCE.
35
SERIES OF SHOTS
In stark silhouette
The swishing of a bowler hat spinning thru space
An umbrella tossed in the air, flicked like a deadly weapon --
A rich velvety feel, key colors black/white/red.
Dandyish and erotic followed by blasts
of violence, dreamy op-art puzzles and psychedelic patterns over --
A sensuous BLACK, background -- slowly revealed to be a woman's leather-clad
body --
In silhouette -- A bowler hatted man, Steed, a catsuited woman Emma.
Flashes of:
hair -- eye -- a red rose -- in bloom -- petals folding and unfolding, then tightly shut.
A thorned stem, sharp to the touch --
FROM black and white INTO color -- leather Background metamorphosing into black
and white of a chessboard as ...
A medieval knight moves around its queen in a formal dance --
A fetishistic attention to detail: leather catsuit, swish of legs, boots ... hair tossed
back - - red nails over black ... creamy white skin ... zips ...
A silhouetted man in bowler hat in Savile Row suit -- old Etonian knotted tie --
umbrella stabs like a sword --
Umbrella with knotted stems of a rose furling round -- then a tear, gash -- rose cut and
tossed into --
His lapel. Until, at the end: together in silhouette.
Bowler hat thrown, skimming, swishing thru air, until --
Now only a single HEARTBEAT ... BA-BOOM ... BA-BOOM ...
Then --
PISTOL SHOTS OVER as:
36
EMMA'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN
A gasp as Emma wakes abruptly from her nightmare, years later, startled by the shots,
naked beneath satin sheets.
Her HEARTBEAT FADES as she looks around her Klaus
Oldenberg room, vinyl comforter, satin sheets.
A toss of her hair.
Looks more mature. Sexual, haunted. Mrs. Emma Peel -- widow.
Same every night.
Next to the clock, a framed photo of her dead husband, Peter Peel.
From outside ANOTHER SHOT ...
Emma flings on a satin robe, goes to the window and sees --
37
HER POV
a CAR zooooming past, its bowler-hatted driver racing thru early morning streets.
The
damn thing BACKFIRES again ...
38
BACK TO SCENE
Emma frowns, annoyed.
39
STEED'S FLAT - DAWN
but the curtains are still drawn so the place is dark.
A large bachelor's den.
Dark wood, leather armchairs ...
Steed enters his library from a concealed door --
Titles on wine and birdwatching.
He clicks the door, goes to his drinks cabinet. Pours
a brandy.
Hears a noise ...
Instantly on guard.
In his glass, sees a shadowy reflection move.
Steed peers 'round a
corner.
Sees a silhouetted figure stand over his desk -- a burglar?
Steed sneaks up behind -- raises his umbrella, and --
Crack!
Brings the umbrella down -- on the suspect's head.
Who manages to dodge,
swivel 'round, and --
Bam!
Delivers an expert blow to Steed's stomach.
A rapid exchange of blows.
Steed
recoils, about to jab the umbrella, when --
His assailant about to deliver a kick to his crotch -- Steed covers the area -- bam! a
spiked heel hits his bowler -- as the curtains are drawn back, light floods in -- they
freeze.
Steed knows his opponent:
a lethal blonde in red leather.
STEED
Brenda -- ?
43
FROM ABOVE HIM
a voice --
MOTHER (O.S.)
Steed -- ?!
44
BACK TO SCENE
Steed swivels 'round to face -- upside down -- a man hanging like a bat from the ceiling
inches before him --
Pommaded hair, fat, dandyish:
MOTHER, head of secret services; hands of extendable
metal hooks.
And BRENDA, his beautiful leather-clad bodyguard.
Who smiles
seductively.
STEED
Mother. I thought you were burglars.
MOTHER
Brenda and I thought we'd drop in.
Mother suits action to the word, drops into his wheelchair.
BRENDA
See how you're getting on ...
STEED
Something in the wind?
Mother wheels himself from the study.
Taps a barometer.
It whirls around.
MOTHER
Weather's turning nasty.
STEED
You didn't come to talk about the
weather, surely.
MOTHER
Oh yes I did. I want you to meet
somebody.
(off Steed's look)
I expect you'll like her.
Brenda coolly files her nails.
A flash of jealousy.
STEED
'Her'?
45
EMMA'S FLAT (PRIMROSE HILL) - DAY
A groovy penthouse (a Lichtenstein come to life?).
Bach PIANO MUSIC floats in the
air.
Hands gliding over keys, Emma Peel plays with virtuoso skill.
On the piano, a framed
picture of her late husband.
And a photo of Emma between Peter and Valentine.
A KNOCK.
Emma gets up, goes to the door.
The MUSIC KEEPS PLAYING, keys
jumping up and down automatically, as --
46
AT DOOR
Emma flicks open a large automated eye.
Peers thru.
Opens
47
IN CORRIDOR
A MESSENGER (distinctive outfit) hands over a package tied in a bow.
MESSENGER
Dr. Peel?
EMMA
Thank you ...
Emma shuts the door.
Unties the bow, opens up
Finds an embossed card:
EMMA
(reads)
'Please answer the Telephone.'
Emma looks: The phone sits there.
Just then ... RING-RING.
Emma goes over, picks up the phone.
A recorded message,
an upper-class woman's voice:
WOMAN (V.O.)
(filtered)
Boodles Club, the Mall, 2:30 p.m.
Mr. John Steed ... Boodles Club,
the Mall, 2:30 p.m. Mr. John
Steed ...
BEEP.
The phone goes dead.
Emma opens up the case.
Unveils a brace of kippers.
Puzzled, she holds up a fish.
EMMA
Kippers ...?
48
BOODLES' LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
A PORTER approaches her, equally surprised.
PORTER
May I help you, madam ...
EMMA
Mr. John Steed, please.
PORTER
I'm afraid that's impossible.
EMMA
Impossible?
The Porter points to a notice:
"No non-members.
No animals.
No women."
PORTER
You are female?
EMMA
As you see.
PORTER
Then you can't come in.
EMMA
I have an appointment.
PORTER
No women. Not in Boodles. Not
since 1922.
EMMA
Really -- what happened in 1922?
Bored, Emma breezes past, already inside the hall.
Old mahogany, portraits of dead
politicians, leather chairs.
A male enclave.
The Porter rushes up to restrain her.
Hardly missing a step, Emma lays a gentle hand on his shoulder -- finds the nerve ends.
The Porter winces and --
EMMA
Thank you so much. I can find Mr.
Steed myself ...
-- collapses on the ground in agony.
Emma ignores him.
Pushes thru double doors,
upstairs, statues of naked bronze warriors frown down on her, into
50
BOODLES - TURKISH BATHS - DAY
Thru a cloud of steam in an oriental room
Steed sits naked save for a towel.
He hears a disturbance, thru the mist, sees --
Emma before him.
Automatically, Steed dons his bowler and tips it in her direction.
STEED
Doctor Peel, I presume?
EMMA
And you must be Steed. Please
don't get up.
He doesn't.
HISSING STEAM between them as they study.
STEED
I was about to throw in the towel.
EMMA
I had a spot of bother at the door.
STEED
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman
inside Boodles since --
EMMA
1922. Why the kippers?
STEED
Red herring would have been too
obvious, don't you think?
EMMA
(looks around)
So what was all this -- some sort
of test?
STEED
Congratulations, you've penetrated a
bastion of male privilege. I guessed
you weren't a stickler for Tradition,
doctor.
EMMA
Whereas you are.
STEED
Dyed in the wool. But I can admire
someone who doesn't play by the
rules.
EMMA
Rules are made to be broken.
STEED
Not by me. Play by the rules,
Doctor, or the game is nothing.
EMMA
And just what is the game?
STEED
I say, this is all terribly formal.
Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
EMMA
(re:
the steamroom)
Under the circumstances, you may
call me Mrs. Peel.
STEED
Much better.
EMMA
And now that we've settled the matter
of honorifics, will you kindly explain
why you wished me to meet you?
STEED
I didn't. Mother did.
EMMA
Mother?
Steed steps closer, smiling.
STEED
I expect you'll like him.
Off Emma's reaction --
51
Mother in his wheelchair, pulling the curtain cord.
MOTHER
That's better. I much prefer a
womb with view, don't you, Mrs.
Peel?
A delicate CLOCK on the mantel CHIMES FOUR.
Mother wheels himself forward and hooks onto the kettle.
MOTHER
Shall I be mother?
He pours, presiding like a fat spider at the center of a subterranean web, known as The
Ministry: a vast bureaucracy in a labyrinth of tunnels.
Catches Emma's wandering lock
MOTHER
I expect you're wondering where
you are.
An atmosphere of a gentleman's club reigns in the subterranean bureau -- Emma takes
her tea ...
EMMA
Don't tell me: You're the shadow secret
service. You're so hushhush, even the
legit secret service knows nothing about
it. Am I right?
Bodyguard Brenda, a glam leather Moneypenny, wheels a trolley brimming with fancies
over to Emma and Steed.
MOTHER
Close. We're so hush-hush, even
we know nothing about it.
(before Emma can
make sense of this)
Now let's see, there's coconut cake,
date and walnut; I recommend the
rum baba ...
EMMA
Hmmm ...
MOTHER
Looks like rain, Steed...
STEED
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
EMMA
(looks up from
trolley)
We're not here to talk about the
weather, surely.
MOTHER
Oh, yes we are.
BRENDA
(to Emma, cunning)
Macaroon?
Emma hesitates; takes a cake.
About to take a bite, when --
Mother switches off lights.
A screen drops, covering the water window as the mood
changes from coziness to terror -- an ancient PROJECTOR RATTLES on ...
54
IN DARKNESS
Emma watches on the wall, an official Ministry film of macabre death tableaux in the
English countryside:
MOTHER
We've had a series of bizarre weather reports.
We kept them hush-hush and sent agents into
the field for data. Case number one:
April 14, 3:35 P.M., Special Agent Simkins
investigating mysterious fires in corn circles.
A field outside the village of Little Snoring,
one of the hottest days of the year. Trapped
by a sudden blizzard. Found frozen to death
in a giant ice cube -- like a mammoth in
perma-frost.
(the picture changes)
Case two: Pilot Raymond Shaw, May 6, 11:28 A.M.
Took off from a deserted airstrip near Stoke Poges,
investigating bizarre atmospheric reports. A freak
rainstorm downed him. Knocked unconscious by a
flying fish, falling from 15,000 feet. Twenty-five
inches of rain in eight minutes, over an area the size
of a cricket pitch ...
(the picture changes)
... Case three: June 2, 5:43 P.M. Defense Chief
Major Courtnay. Remains discovered in a turnip
field near Ashby de la Zouche. Our boffins
recorded a sudden blast of heat. Scorched earth,
temperature of 1000 degrees. Spontaneous
combustion. Not much of him left ...
CLICK.
The lights go back on.
Emma notices - a new arrival
a tall, striking OLDER WOMAN; dark glasses.
MOTHER
My number two. Special assignments.
She's --
EMMA
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
FATHER (OLDER WOMAN)
All happy families here, Mrs. Peel.
Father's dark glasses turn to Emma like a hawk.
Runs her fingers over Emma's face.
Gets the outline.
Emma realizes --
EMMA
You're --
Blind ... Father smiles.
FATHER
God, you're quick.
MOTHER
Have a look at these, Mrs. Peel --
He passes 'round a box of evidence related to the screen events:
Steed investigates a
pair of black shoes and bowler; Emma, a fish.
The shoes have agent Simkins' name
in them ...
STEED
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.
My
shoemaker.
EMMA
(unimpressed)
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were
they investigating?
FATHER
A series of bizarre shifts in local weather
patterns ...
STEED
Global warming?
FATHER
Jungle plants in the Arctic? A lush
English village transformed overnight
into African scrubland? Blizzards in summer?
EMMA
How curious ...
MOTHER
Something strange is happening. And
whoever knows about it doesn't want
us to find out.
FATHER
(to Steed)
Your mission is simple. Find out
how and why these agents died.
EMMA
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
MOTHER
Your research into climate engineering was
state-of-the-art. Your experiments could
have revolutionized our knowledge of global
warming -- had they succeeded. We need
your expertise.
STEED
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor
again, Mrs. Peel --
Emma hesitates, unsure for the first time ...
EMMA
I'm not sure I'm ready to return to work.
I've been out of action for some time. I'll
consider your proposal.
She gets up, ready to go.
FATHER
One moment, Mrs. Peel. There's another
special reason we wanted you to join our
happy family; rather curious, actually ...
Mother hits the lights.
He flicks the video into slow-mo.
File thru image clarification,
identikit sketches.
MOTHER
Eye witness reports. Strangers in the area.
One description tallied in all three places.
Recognize her?
Emma locks.
On the screen comes -- Emma Peel.
Steed reacts.
EMMA
Me, isn't it?
Emma stares at the screen: incredible.
Like a twin sister.
FATHER
Think of it as special assignment, Mrs. Peel.
With a twist. You're our chief suspect.
EMMA
You're saying I have no choice.
MOTHER
Father will be your controller. Steed here
will show you the ropes.
EMMA
(very arch)
Ropes?

SECRET SERVICE HQ SHOOTING GALLERY
A life-size target of a man with blank face, bowler hat and umbrella, flips up, and --
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
Is riddled with holes by
Emma, who works at reloading as

HIGH ABOVE IN ONE-WAY MIRRORED GALLERY
looking on, Mother with Steed.
STEED
Think she really killed those agents?
MOTHER
She may not know. Theory goes she
may be very ill.
STEED
Amnesia?
MOTHER
Possibly. Split personality ...
STEED
Insane ... ?
MOTHER
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right,
you should watch out.
STEED
Why?
MOTHER
She may try to kill you.
57
IN SHOOTING GALLERY
Emma swiftly turns, aims, and --
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! FIRES with dead-eye precision.
All on target.
Steed reacts.
Ulp.
STEED
Perhaps I ought to talk with Dr.
Darling.
58
SECRET SERVICE HQ PSY OPS ROOM
A gallery of portraits of Emma Peel projected on the wall based on Warhol's Jackie
(1964) -- Poignant, inscrutable, fascinating, iconic -- blown up, dissected, analyzed.
The swirling newspaper dots cover Mother and Steed like bubbles from a light show.
As DR. DARLING, head of the Ministry's Psychological Operations (Psy Ops) -- a
kind of spy version of Timothy Leary, briefs them. In his thick dark glasses and beard,
Darling's obsessive interest in Emma adds a sinister air.
DR. DARLING
One key point: Mrs. Peel is a widow:
she's obsessively devoted to the memory
of her husband the scientist Peter Peel.
You may find her a little ... remote.
Images of Peter Peel on the wall.
Of Emma with him.
DR. DARLING
They were a team. Met at Cambridge.
Working on a top secret research mission
into weather conditions, code name The
Prospero Project, when Peel died.
Steed looks meaningfully at Mother.
MOTHER
Something went wrong. System malfunction.
Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape.
Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File
still open.
STEED
How come you took so much interest
in her, Dr. Darling?
DR. DARLING
Her husband was one of ours.
STEED
(eyes Peel's photo,
then Mother)
Peel? Did she know?
MOTHER
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.
She
was in a dangerous game, Steed. High
stakes. She may prove to be a risk.
If
she is, there's only one solution.
Termination.
STEED
Anyone particular in mind?
MOTHER
You.
OFF Steed's reaction.
CLASHING BLADES OVER ...
59
SECRET SERVICE FENCING SALON
Steed and Emma (new outfit), cross swords.
Like everything else she does, Emma is a
champion.
Steed is hard put.
Both fence attached to cables -- very high-tech
dueling ...
Steed is in white; Emma (natch), in black ... yin and yang ...
STEED
You're a lady of hidden talents,
Mrs. Peel ...
Tic-tac ...
EMMA
I've no intention of hiding them ...
Tic-tac ...
STEED
Scientist ...
(tic-tac)
... marksman ...
(tic-tac)
... swordsman ...
(tic-tac)
... To what do you attribute your
overachievements?
Fast swordplay.
Tic-tac-tic-tac-tic.
Steed's good, too.
EMMA
My father always wanted a boy.
STEED
Really?
I fail to see the connection.
EMMA
I had a feeling you would. Touche!
She lunges; her foil tips right into the heart on Steed's chest.
BUZZ!
Steed removes
his mask; holds her foil tip.
STEED
I take your point.
Emma takes off her mask.
EMMA
Do you?
STEED
Yes indeed. I need protection.
60
TRUBSHAW'S GENTLEMEN'S SHOP - DAY
A bull moose's antlers.
A horned rhino.
A Leopard.
A tiger.
Then next to them, in a
wall of hunting trophies Emma paces impatiently beneath them.
Shop assistants attend
in tails and wing-collars, very old school tie.
Steed emerges helped into a new flashy
waistcoat ...
EMMA
(gags at the waistcoat)
Steed, we really must be --
STEED
(relishing his shoes)
Ahh. Perfect fit. The luxury of a
hand-made shoe. As unique as a face
or a fingerprint. Or should I say DNA?
63
BEHIND DISPLAY
Eyes watching Emma and Steed rise ...
EMMA
You can but I wish you wouldn't ...
STEED
Thank you, Trubshaw ...
A youngish man -- in black polo neck, Beatle-cut mop, pauting lips, smart suit, druggy
high-pitched giggle.
BAILEY, a cocky, cool psychopath.
He watches Steed and
Emma leave ...
... and saunters after them ...
CAR ROAR OVER.
64
JAG - DAY
Emma, reacts, pours from the samovar ...
STEED
Sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt
your flow of oratory ...
Steed's JAG BACKFIRES again as at the beginning ...
EMMA
You know what I mean. This car
-- and you. Nobody walks around
like that. Milk?
STEED
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs.
Peel. No thank you.
She hands over a cup.
EMMA
But why? What's the point?
STEED
A Gentleman has to have a code.
This is part of mine. A uniform.
Think of it as my suit of shining
armor.
EMMA
And I suppose you're the knight.
STEED
The most unpredictable piece on
the board. And always ready to
protect his queen.
EMMA
That's predictable. When I find
a queen in need of protection
I'll let you know.
Steed looks in the mirror.
Behind them, a car.
Tailing?
STEED
I'm hoping you will.
He puts his foot down.
Zoom ...
68
JAG - DAY
Emma consults a list, reads --
EMMA
Sir August Merryweather ... why
are we seeing him first?
STEED
As per mother's instructions.
EMMA
Do we always follow Mother's
instructions?
STEED
For a man in my position --
EMMA
Just what is your position, if you don't
mind my asking.
How did a stuffed
shirt like you get into this line of work?
STEED
(smiles)
They call me in when they've reached a
dead end. Freelance. Like yourself.
EMMA
I have no choice. Why should you
risk your life?
STEED
After our fencing match, I was rather
hoping you would do the risking.
More tea?
EMMA
No thanks.
STEED
I meant me.
Emma takes in Steed's evasive answers.
Sighing, she pours.
70
JAG - DAY
STEED
Not so much eccentric. More barking
mad. He has a wife called June. And
a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
EMMA
June, July ... August?
STEED
The family does seem to be somewhat
meteorologically inclined.
EMMA
Any other vices?
STEED
All of a piece, really. A fanatical
weatherman. Chairman of BROLLY.
(off her look)
British Royal Organisation For
Lasting Liquid Years. Thinks British
weather has been tampered with
by ... aliens.
Emma takes this in.
EMMA
So ... I distract him while you snoop
around? How?
STEED
Small talk.
Try the weather.
72
MANOR HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY
On a tartan carpet, a SCOTTIE BARKS furiously at a set of EXPIRING BAGPIPES
on the floor.
PAN UP to reveal:
A BUTLER leading Emma down the corridor --
-- where she admires the eccentric fixtures, pausing to note a large teddy bear outfit
with tartan trimmings instead of the usual suit of armor.
EMMA
Original ...
BUTLER
This way, miss ...
EMMA
Missus ...
He opens the double doors, admitting Emma into
74
A LARGE ROOM
of semi-tropical climate.
Jungle plants, parakeets, snakes.
Walls lined with display
cabinets and bell jars:
stuffed birds, butterflies, spiders.
A thermometer reads:
100 degrees with high humidity. The Butler leaves.
Emma fans herself.
Nobody in the roam.
But hears a sound of RAINFALL from a
smoked glass conservatory.
EMMA
Sir August ... ? Sir August ... ?
VOICE (O.S.)
Eh? In here!
Emma follows the SOUND, steps cautiously forward.
75
CONSERVATORY
beneath a sprinkler system of torrential rain, an old man splashes in bizarre rubber togs.
Emma stays cool.
EMMA
I've come to apply for membership
in Brolly --
SIR AUGUST
(shouts above the tempest)
You don't get rain like you used to in
England. A good shower that's the ticket.
Stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells
the namby-pamby in a man.
SIR AUGUST steps out of the shower and wind machine.
A belted rubber macintosh,
flippers, goggles.
He starts to disrobe, the NOISE DIES DOWN --
EMMA
I so agree. How did you acquire a
taste for it?
SIR AUGUST
Out in India. So character-forming for the
British. Not the heat. Good Lord, no. The
rain, dash it. A good monsoon. Fifteen
inches overnight. A whole week of lovely
rain. I remember one summer in Jaipur ...
Sir August removes his goggles, recognizes her.
SIR AUGUST
You
EMMA
Have we met?
SIR AUGUST
You mean you don't recall??
Before Emma can reply, the door opens...
SIR AUGUST
Ah, Lady June ...
Emma's attention switches to LADY JUNE, a buxom lady in a sou'wester and galoshes,
who wheels in a tray of scones.
LADY JUNE
Dear August.
Loves his showers.
Like a baby.
(beat)
Scones, Mrs. Peel?
EMMA
Thank you, Lady -- June ...
Emma sees Sir August gazing wistfully out of the window, which is rapidly
darkening ...
SIR AUGUST
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
EMMA
Promised? Who promised?
SIR AUGUST
There, look!
Emma looks, sees rain start to pitter-patter on the windows.
Emma exchanges looks
with June as the rain starts pouring.
SIR AUGUST
Imagine being caught out in a blow
like that!

SECRET SERVICE HOSPITAL - DAY
A hospital ward.
Empty apart from one bed.
A nurse (Brenda in her red leather), her
spiked heels clacking on the floor, brings over a cup of tea to
Steed in a hospital bed.
Who wakes, surprised to see Emma.
Peering over him.
Very
nonchalant.
Eating his grapes.
STEED
Ah, Brenda ...
(as she leaves)
Mrs. Peel?
EMMA
You should be dead.
How do you
feel?
STEED
(eyes her)
Strange.
EMMA
You were very lucky.
Four shots to
the heart. I found you after I slipped
away from Sir August. Mother brought
you here. Not me you should thank.
STEED
I wasn't about to.
EMMA
I mean your man Trubshaw.
Your
bullet-proof waistcoat.
I thought
you were just overdressed.
STEED
I might say the same.
84
FROM GALLERY
Mother with Dr. Darling taking notes.
Emma looks up at them.
Drops to a whisper.
But they both are wearing headphones.
EMMA
Mother and Dr. Darling have me
under observation. They think I
tried to kill you.
STEED
Why should they think that?
EMMA
You told them. You said I arrived
on a camel, shot you four times.
Left you for dead.
STEED
Frankly that's how I remember it.
EMMA
But that's absurd. I may not be
over-fond of you, Steed, but it's
not my style.
STEED
Perhaps your memory plays tricks,
Mrs. Peel.
EMMA
(conceding)
That's possible. Sir August was convinced
he'd met me before. But I'd never met him.
Another odd thing. When it rained, he said
it was just as someone had promised.
STEED
Did he say who?
EMMA
No. But he must know. Incidentally,
my double left you with this.
Emma shows Steed the toy snow scene.
A winter wonderland snow scene.
He looks
puzzlingly at it.
On its underneath. "The Wonderland Corporation," followed by --
STEED
An invitation. To a 'formal picnic'...?
EMMA
Did you say formal? I must dress.
85
CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
A boardroom suite, overlooking London.
Lights twinkling --
Around a conference table.
Twelve TEDDY BEARS.
Each six feet tall.
Ridiculous
and sinister.
In pink, turquoise, brown, black, white, green.
Furry, giant paws and
ears, swivel eyes.
One teddy sports a familiar tartan ...
On the table, children's party food: jellies, hundreds and thousands, birthday cakes.
And wrapped presents before each.
Each bear has a name-badge: Bobby, Bobo, Bruno, Bibi, Betty, Binky etc. pinned to
their fur.
A children's tune, "THE TEDDY BEAR'S PICNIC," plays.
Followed by -
a gavel rapping order.
A distinctively chilling voice, eerily familiar and seductive, which ECHOES through our
story --
VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
Ladies, gentlemen and bears ...
The teddy bears look round.
Can't hear who's talking.
VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
Today is history. The first day of the future.
I welcome you to the first general meeting
of the Wonderland Corporation, now allied
with our colleagues from Brolly ...
Murmurs of congratulations amongst the bears ...
VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
You have all given time, money and expertise
to achieve our goal. But we are reaching a
new phase of our operation. From today,
many of you will no longer be needed. I have
to warn you ...
Dismay from the teddy bears.
As a CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS OUT,
VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
A cuckoo.
The first sign of spring, and ...
A cuckoo in our nest. Our organization is
no longer secret. Agents are investigating
us. Their names are John Steed and Emma
Peel. I believe we have a traitor among us
... perhaps more than one ...
Uproar from the teddy bears.
Shouts of "Who?" (*PS: One of the Teddys is a giant
rabbit who seems especially alarmed).
VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
That remains to be seen. When we find
the traitors, they will be dealt with severely.
TEDDY BEAR #l
These agents.
Where are they?
VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
Here. In this building. By our estimate, they
will enter this room in thirty-five point five
seconds precisely ...
Panic.
The bears scramble to go, bumping into each other.
VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
I am sorry the party is over.
But we
shall meet again.
To each of you a gift. A token of
my appreciation.
In front of the teddy bears, each one receives a present wrapped up in paper with a pink
and silver bow.
The tartan teddy opens his up:
A snow scene.
Anxious moans.
88
BUILDING - NIGHT
UP and inside fire staircase, Emma and Steed run up -- Open the door to the
conference room.
The CUCKOO RINGS on their entry.
To FIND an empty room.
Only the party detritus plus little teddy bears sitting where formerly the big ones sat; the
teddy bear picnic MUSIC PLAYING again OVER ...
One snow shaker left.
Steed picks it up:
Inside it:
89
TINY EMMA PEEL
in black leather.
STEED (O.S.)
For you, Mrs. Peel.
90
BACK TO SCENE
Emma stares at it.
Turns it over:
an address.
EMMA
Another invitation. 38 Marlborough
Terrace ...
91
EMBASSY (BELGRAVIA) - NIGHT
Inside number 38, a deserted Eastern bloc embassy.
A dilapidated hammer and sickle
tapestry in tatters.
Old spy techno-junk lies discarded in elegant living rooms.
Steed and Emma open the door, rush inside.
They search for clues.
A cigar left in an ashtray.
Steed picks it up with distaste.
Then
moves over to the wine rack, picks up a vintage bottle of champagne --
STEED
(admiringly)
Hm ... A Veuve-Cliquot '56 ...
(then puzzled)
But he bites the end of his
Monte Cristos ... ?
(frowning)
Clearly, we're dealing with a
maniac.
Meanwhile, Emma goes into the --
92
NEXT ROOM - EMMA'S POV
where she sees a blob of BUBBLING GUNK, like radioactive chewing gum.
A few
pieces of charred clothing tell us this was once a man in a teddy bear outfit.
93
BACK TO SCENE
Steed enters behind her, examines the gunk.
STEED
Colonel Crabtree. International
Satellite Systems. Formerly of
the Ministry.
EMMA
How on earth can you tell?
Steed holds up the inside of a battered shoe:
the name.
STEED
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw
isn't the only shoemaker still
practicing his trade ...
EMMA
Very good, Steed ...
A MEWLING SOUND.
EMMA
What's that?
Leaving Steed to ponder the remains, Emma goes into
94
ANOTHER ROOM
Dark.
Switches on the light.
And gasps.
95
STEED
looks up as Emma emerges with -
A Leopard cub.
Steed raises his brolly.
STEED
What on earth?
EMMA
Any ideas?
STEED
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal
Zoological Society ...
EMMA
Is that written in his shoe?
STEED
(smug)
Common knowledge, Mrs. Peel ...
EMMA
(shrugs)
She had this in her mouth. There,
there...
Cooing to the cub, Emma tosses to Steed -- another snowshaker.
Inside -- another
address:
84 Cadogan Place.
STEED
Not again.
There's got to be
another. way to go about this.
96
KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT
Emma investigates.
Nobody there.
She looks 'round.
Military memorabilia.
Busts of
Napoleon and Charlemagne.
Looks inside drawers.
Desks.
Meanwhile --
98
STEED'S JAG - NIGHT
Steed feeds a carton of milk to the leopard, who is a handful ... licking, pawing him ...
STEED
Now, now ...
(sings)
'I can't give you anything but
love, baby...'
99
KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT
Emma searching ...
100
OUTSIDE FLAT DOOR	100
a key in lock.
Door opens.
Silence.
101
INSIDE - EMMA
finds a snowshaker.
About to look underneath.
Hears a NOISE.
Looks up, in front of
her in the mirror, sees -A giant teddy behind her.
Ready to strike --
Emma swivels 'round,
a fluid balletic motion, and --
Bam!
A kick to the teddy's stomach.
Then off balance, Emma hurls him over her
shoulder, darts in to pin the teddy to the ground as --
The teddy grabs Emma's legs, flings her off balance.
She falls.
Teddy grabs a military
sabre from the wall, and Woosh!
Slices through air at Emma's head.
She ducks.
The
sabre skims her hair.
Emma grabs another sabre; the fight is on!
Emma counterattacks.
Slashes with the sabre and the teddy's head goes flying off!
Jesus.
The torso stands unsteadily.
Emma's eyes widen as:
A man's head emerges from the teddy torso.
Emma's so surprised, he can slug her ...
Emma's out.
102
STEED'S JAG - NIGHT
so is Steed and the Leopard -- both asleep.
A little milk dribbles down Steed's chin ...
103
KNIGHTSBRIDGE FLAT - NIGHT
The man goes to the other room.
Starts to take off the rest of his teddy costume.
Throws clothes into a suitcase.
The PHONE.
Terrified, the Man picks it up ... The voice ...
VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
Naughty teddy ...
MAN
No! You can't ...
VOICE (V.O.)

Ask not for whom the telephone
rings, it rings for thee ...
MAN
But I've got rid of her.
She's ...
VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
Go to the window ... To the window.
Teddy moves to the open window.
Sudden PAIN.
LIGHTNING.
Teddy looks up in terror as a purple cloud releases another BOLT.
Direct hit.
The
teddy slumps to the ground.
Soggy, waterlogged, very dead.
Kinda like the
other guy ...
104
IN OTHER ROOM
Meanwhile Emma wakes up. Turns the corner.
Towards the other room, sees dead
Teddy.
Reads the label on his suitcase ...
EMMA
Major D'Arcy ... ?
105
OVER HER SHOULDER
from the window behind her like a spider on glass appears another "Emma" --
-- let's call her Bad Emma -- coming straight for Emma.
She makes a NOISE.
Emma
turns just in time to see.
EMMA
Well, well. If it isn't me ...
Emma starts towards her double, who hesitates, then turns, leaping out the window ...
she wears the same black catsuit.
The real Emma rushes, follows her "double"
Clambers outside to rappel up the line to
106
MANOR HOUSE (SCOTLAND) - DAY
Sir August gripped with terror, stares at the PHONE.
The scotty DOG BARKS.
Finally, Sir August answers.
SIR AUGUST
Mrs. Peel -- ?
VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
Ask not for whom the telephone
rings ...
SIR AUGUST
No, please! I beg you ...
VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
Walk over to the window ...
SIR AUGUST
Let it be rain, please let it be --
VOICE (V.O.)
(filtered)
Stay by the window. By the window.
Mesmerized, Sir August goes to the window. Looks -- Lady June arrives, too late.
123
OUTSIDE
a purple cloud of cyclone-force rages towards him.
A luminous glow.
Then a
LIGHTNING STRIKE. And --
BOOM!
An EXPLOSION BLASTS the WINDOWS.
A WIND rushes
in ...
FATHER (V.O.)
Emergency alert ...
124
BUS - DAY
Steed and Emma board the bus.
Destination:
Not In Service.
They pay Brenda, the
conductor.
Go upstairs.
127
UPSTAIRS
is Mother's temporary mobile HQ.
He squats in a corner.
Metal hooks on electronic
panels.
Now paranoid.
Suspicious.
All the upper windows have been blacked out.
MOTHER
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's
turning quite nasty. Sir August was
blown to smithereens. Along with
half of Banffshire.
The Ministry's
worried.
EMMA
He tried to warn us ...
STEED
We had a lead to Wonderland
Weather but we got there too late.
Someone tipped them off ...
MOTHER
Too late anyway. Today's escapade
was only for starters. This is no
ordinary weather. It's manmade. A
kind of weather bomb.
STEED
Impossible.
EMMA
Not quite. This is my field.
STEED
Is there anything that isn't?
EMMA
(ignores)
The Prospero Project was started by
my husband. It was an early attempt
to solve the problems of global warming.
In theory, climate engineering is entirely
feasible. We thought of injecting a
chemical cocktail into the atmosphere
by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
STEED
Filling in mother nature's blind
spots ... ?
EMMA
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts
to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea.
Propane gas mostly. In small quantities
it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone
layer. But it proved impractical.
Too bulky ...
STEED
But if someone miniaturized the
process...
EMMA
That's what we were working on.
STEED
Sounds as if someone's hijacked
your research.
MOTHER
Would it be possible to use it for
military purposes?
EMMA
Directed by laser. Bounced by
satellite. Quite possible.
STEED
Where would they aim for?
Mother thinks, gets out of his wheelchair; takes a turn about the bus, sits down again.
No one pays any attention.
MOTHER
London. The World Council of Ministers
meets soon on global defence. If you can
control the weather, you control the world.
EMMA
After the cold war ...
STEED
The hot and cold war ...
Sign "Grand Opening Soon."
WIDEN to reveal ...
128
WONDERLAND WEATHER OFFICES - DAY
A kind of space-age travel agency.
Steed enters.
At the reception desk, the receptionist has her back turned.
Steed sneaks in, moves
behind a screen, overhears --
A man -- Bailey -- giving orders to the receptionist
BAILEY
New orders. The penultimate phase.
Now fully operational ...
Steed moves away from them, pushes a set of double doors open, arrives inside --
130
WONDERLAND OFFICE - DISPLAY - DAY
A long corridor surrounded by a presentation of --
Virtual reality weather:
clouds, sunny vistas, lush meadows, desert.
And slogans:
"Be natural.
Act natural.
Think natural.
The natural beauty of Wonderland Weather."
Steed reacts; the model is the same as Emma on the big neon sign near Harrods ...
Steed finds a desk.
Inspects papers.
Sees a postcard of a large stately home.
He
pockets it.
Then looks 'round to see --
Bailey before him.
We recognize him as the young dandy trailing Steed.
Neither gives
away the other.
BAILEY
We're not yet open for business,
I'm afraid.
STEED
Shame. I was recommended. By a
friend.
BAILEY
Really?
STEED
Sir August Merryweather? I was
looking for something relaxing.
Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
BAILEY
Normally, we'd be eager to
oblige --
STEED
Seriously?
BAILEY
Of course. Natural weather delivered
to your door on demand. Down your
phoneline. For limited periods.
STEED
You don't say. How real does it feel?
BAILEY
As real as you wish. Hot or cold.
Humid or dry. Anything you like.
Within reason.
STEED
There are limits?
BAILEY
The technology is brand new. Soon
it will be more powerful. We
anticipate a huge demand. Leave us
your number. We'll be in touch.
STEED
No need. I'll call again.
Steed raises his bowler.
Bailey watches him go.
131
LOTUS - DAY
EMMA
Three agents killed by bad weather...
STEED
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
EMMA
(ignores)
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret
defense establishment. A group of
eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
STEED
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything
points to you.
No sisters?
No
undiscovered twin?
EMMA
Not that I know of.
Explanation?
STEED
According to Dr. Darling, you're a
psychopathic personality with
schizophrenic delusions, suffering from
recurring amnesia based on traumatic
repression, leading to outbursts of
anti-social and violent behavior.
Q.E.D.
Steed lets it sink in.
Emma looks a little hurt.
EMMA
Is that what you think?
STEED
Oh, well ...
(beat)
Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
134
Emma sees Steed hold on for dear life. She smirks --
STEED
Do you always drive this fast?
EMMA
Have I trespassed on a male
prerogative?
(before his reply)
We're being followed. I saw him
at Trubshaw's ...
Steed looks into the mirror, sees a car behind them.
Pulling up, trying to catch up.
Emma glances in the mirror, and --
EMMA
Hold on ...
Puts foot down.
ZOOM.
Extra ACCELERATION.
Steed's head pinned back to his
seat.
Emma's hair tossed in the wind.
136
HALLUCINOGEN HALL - CONTROL ROOM - DAY
A pattern on a screen.
The lines of the maze reformulated as abstract lines.
Steed,
Emma and the Old Lady as three flashing dots.
Someone, somewhere is watching
them.
Laughter, then a familiar voice --
VOICE (O.S.)
Now this is more like it ...
149
RABBIT HOLE
Emma spins through darkness, like Alice in Wonderland ...
EMMA
Steed ... !
STEED (V.O.)
Mrs. Peel ... ?
152
HALLUCINOGEN HALL - DAY
Inside the house, a grand hall.
Deserted.
A cobweb hangs from ceiling.
A velvet
curtain tattered and torn.
Emma.
A CUCKOO CLOCK RINGS the hour.
Ahead, the real Emma sees --
A giant staircase.
There on the stairs -- a glass eye.
She picks it up.
Puts it in a pocket.
Emma goes --
154
UPSTAIRS
Sees a series of family portraits an the staircase.
One of herself in ornate aristocratic
regalia.
155
LONG CORRIDOR UPSTAIRS
Rooms on either side.
Emma goes down the hall, pushes doors.
156
INSIDE ROOMS
A mad child's collections of ... toys... rocking horses ... train sets ... ventriloquists'
dummies... and ...
Butterflies ... scarabs ... beetles ... glass eyes, staring at her from the blackness ...
Then Emma turns into a whole room of ...
Snow shakers ... A wall of them in glass cabinets like insect specimens or fossils.
Emma picks up one snow scene.
She shakes it.
157
HALLUCINOGEN HALL
PLAYROOM - DAY
THUNDER and lightning outside.
Inside the room of snow shakers, a CHILDHOOD
TUNE PLAYS.
Emma shakes the snow scene.
The weather seems to grow darker.
160
FROM BEHIND
Emma hears the unmistakable chilling voice:
VOICE (V.O.)
I wouldn't shake that too hard.
The weather might turn nasty.
From the shadows ... a man.
A silhouette.
Behind a distorting lens.
His shape and
face unclear.
Emma puts down the shaker.
EMMA
Quite a collection.
VOICE (V.O.)
If nature gives a man a collector's mind,
it doesn't matter what he collects.
Butterflies. Old China. Penny farthings.
A true collector grows more obsessive
as the years pass.
Outside the big window the weather is turning nasty ...
EMMA
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
VOICE (V.O.)
We have met ...
From the shadows, a man moves out, revealing:
Peter Peel, Emma's husband!
THUNDER.
EMMA
Peter ... ?
Instinctively Emma moves towards him.
A long pause.
EMMA
I must be dreaming ...
Emma pulls back.
Before she can turn, Peter takes her hand, places it over his heart.
BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM, BA-BOOM ...
PETER
Listen... Very much alive.
Peter touches her hand.
Emma looks into his eyes.
Intrigued but alarmed, disbelief.
Peter raises her hand to his lips.
PETER
Darling, it's me...
Emma shudders, battles with herself.
EMMA
Peter ...
Emma is tempted, yet filled with terror.
161
CLOSEUP - EMMA'S EYES
Inside her pupil --
FLASH CUTS TO:
162
MEMORY FLASHES
His face as he kissed her -- his ring on her finger -the visor cracking -- the glass
obscuring his face.
163
BACK TO SCENE
EMMA
Impossible ... how?
Peter smiles disarmingly.
As if the answer was obvious.
PETER
For you ... all for you ...
Peter comes over, folds her in his arms.
Takes her head between his hands.
Emma
leans over to him, about to kiss him, both closing their eyes, until --
Lips parted.
Before they kiss, Emma pulls back --
PETER
Don't be afraid, darling.
She turns, runs to the door.
Like a trapped bird.
She tries the door -- locked.
Another
door -- locked.
A window -- locked.
PETER
Don't run away. I forgive you,
Emma. I know you left me. But
I still love you. Do you still have
my ring? I need it.
Peter grabs hold of Emma.
She pulls away.
Emma sees his face before her, pleading
with her.
Seductive yet nightmarish.
As if hallucinating, Emma runs away, towards --
The big window overlooking the gardens.
She runs, leaps, and in SLOW MOTION --
Crashes thru the GLASS, shards and splinters SHATTERING all 'round her, as she --
164
ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER
Emma floats in the air, as Mother, Dr. Darling and Steed all follow.
And float
helplessly, turning around madly.
Trying to gain on Emma.
Mother's wheelchair,
Steed's umbrella and bowler, all tumble thru the air as Steed tries to reach the "OFF"
switch
EMMA
(echoing)
What are you trying to do to me?
MOTHER
(flailing)
We want to help...!
EMMA
I thought I was a widow. My
husband ... the only man I ever
loved ... is dead. For the rest
of my life I have to live with
that.
MOTHER
The death of Peter Peel was a
great loss. To us all ...
EMMA
To you ... ?
Mother looks at Emma.
He's let the cat out the bag.
Steed finds the "OFF" switch.
They all tumble to the floor, Mother landing perfectly in his wheelchair,
Steed effortlessly catching his hat and umbrella.
He moves to Mother --
STEED
I think you owe Mrs. Peel an
explanation ...
Steed stares Mother out.
Who delivers his revelations.
MOTHER
Peter Peel was a first class agent.
A senior operative.
'X' department Special operations.
He was engaged in top secret research.
Top priority.
Government approved.
EMMA
The Institute ... the funding ...
MOTHER
A cover ... for us.
(beat)
I'm sorry...
A turning moment for Emma.
A life lived on a lie.
EMMA
So all that time. Our work, our research
was for you ... for this? And the
accident --
DARLING
It was no accident.
EMMA
The official investigation ...
MOTHER
... was written by me.
(beat)
It was sabotage, Mrs. Peel.
Deadly serious, Emma walks over to him.
EMMA
Who?
MOTHER
Quite frankly ... it could have
been you.
Silence.
Emma looks away, shocked.
Steed intervenes
STEED
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of
killing her own husband?
MOTHER
Her husband suspected someone very
close to the operation. On the day he
died, he was setting a test.
To prove to himself -- to us that his
wife was beyond suspicion. He had to
be certain. He said he was going to
give Mrs. Peel something ...
Emma keeps staring at Mother, fingers her diamond ring.
MOTHER
... I want you to remember. Did
Peter give you anything on-that
day?
176
CLOSEUP - EMMA
touches her ring.
177
BACK TO SCENE
Emma looks up at Mother.
A barefaced lie.
EMMA
No.
Steed notices Emma touch her ring nervously.
DR. DARLING
He said if it vanished, he'd know
it was ... you who betrayed him.
He took a huge risk. The ultimate
test.
EMMA
So I'm still ...
MOTHER
Under suspicion. Everyone died in
the explosion, Mrs. Peel. You were
the only survivor ...
Mother waits.
Emma turns round.
Looks fiercely at him.
Mother shifts uneasily as
Emma walks past him to the airlock.
MOTHER
This is an official matter, Mrs.
Peel. No need to take it
personally. Where are you going?
EMMA
To find out who killed my husband.
MOTHER
The doors and walls are monitored,
Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure
establishment.
EMMA
So am I.
Emma pushes open the doors.
Walks out.
Down a corridor.
Dr. Darling grabs
Mother, as he exits with Steed --
DR. DARLING
She must remain here. She's
highly dangerous.
178
IN HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Mother exits with Steed; they watch Emma going ...
MOTHER
Pity. I was growing fond of Mrs.
Peel. Unfortunately --
STEED
Guilty until proven innocent?
MOTHER
Mother and Father know best.
Mother wheels himself off.
Then stops; over his shoulder:
MOTHER
Something quick. Nothing too ...
messy.
ON Steed.
CAR ROAR over as --

'... Sunny intervals leading to
sudden storms and gale warnings
for all areas.

... Outbursts of rain, scattered

Ministers as they arrived in
London for their conference ...'
Emma drives into a churchyard.
Steed follows her ...
185
COUNTRY CHURCH - DAY
A medieval country church.
Sunlight streams through stained glass, illumining Emma
as Steed watches her lay --
A red rose by an altar tomb:
an ornate mausoleum two hands clasped in a pose of
eternal sleep:
Peter Peel.
Emma pauses, as in the b.g., choirboys sing hymn practice.
Steed watches Emma move
away, toward the door.
He drops a hymn book.
Emma swivels round -- sees Steed.
EMMA
You followed me.
STEED
Orders.
EMMA
To kill me?
STEED
(fractional pause)
Nothing personal.
Emma smiles. Then turns, and --
Runs!
Steed follows Emma through a door to --
186
CHURCH BELL TOWER - DAY
Steed enters, glimpses --
Emma above.
He follows her.
Hears her footsteps.
Trip- trapping up the spiral
staircase.
Steed listens, follows.

From below, Steed hears a BELL RING.
A FLUTTER of BIRDS.
As debris falls

With his back turned to us.

Bad "Emma" walks over.
She stands in front of him.
Blank expression.
Dr. Darling hardly even looks up.
With her hair up, we recognize
on her neck a tattoo:
Z424.
DR. DARLING
We are in the final phase. I shall require
you to be especially obedient. There
must be no failures.
197
CLOSEUP - IN HIS HANDS - SNOWSHAKER
which he grips tightly. As --
198
IN MIRROR
a metamorphosis.
His features melt and bubble, a mask of plastic surgery and it's
slipping around like Michael Jackson's face under kleig lights.
He adjusts it, then ...
Shakes the snowshaker ...
199
JAG - DAY
Steed driving, winces with the drizzle.
STEED
Drat. Someone wants to implicate
you in this affair, Mrs. Peel.
Any idea who?
EMMA
No idea who. No idea why ...
STEED
(thinks)
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys
All children's things ...
EMMA
... Or grown-ups, who still like
to be children.
STEED
Quite. Any childhood friends?
Enemies?
EMMA
Not to speak of. Peter and I
were both loners. There was
nobody.
Steed thinks; sighs.
STEED
Very well. I have a friend who
might be of assistance. He's at
the Ministry. We'd better be
careful.
EMMA
I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
201
MINISTRY CORRIDORS - DAY
Through a door marked "Information & Counter Espionage" --
-- walks Steed with another man in identical clothes:
dapper Savile Row suit, umbrella
and bowler.
Which is
Emma Peel, in disguise.
Steed furtively checks passers-by.
STEED
His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
EMMA
Why's he called 'Invisible'?
STEED
You'll find out.
At a door marked "Information -- Col. I. Jones." Steed knocks, opens the door for her.
EMMA
Aren't you coming?
STEED
I'll catch you up. Don't worry;
he's expecting you.
Emma goes in as Steed walks down the corridor.
202
MINISTRY OFFICE - DAY
A room full of archives and files.
Emma walks through tall corridors, stacks of cabinets
full of old paper.
Dusty, musty and mildewing.
Long forgotten.
Nobody there.
Suddenly Emma
hears --
FOOTSTEPS.
She follows them.
Round stacks, round corners.
The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER.
She's closing in.
The FOOTSTEPS get LOUDER, until up ahead of her --
A filing cabinet drawer opens up.
On its own.
Emma watches as a file pops up, floats through air.
The drawer slams shut.
Still
nobody there.
Emma follows the file to a --
Desk.
Emma watches as -- the chair swivels round.
The file pages open up.
Then the
phone lifts up by itself, a voice:
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
Tell Miss Proudfoot, no calls.
(beat)
Colonel Jones at your service,
Mrs. Peel. Just a moment --
Emma looks ahead of her.
To the chair. As --
A desk drawer opens up, a pipe is whisked through the air, a match is struck.
The pipe
lights; smoke belches forth.
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel.
That usually helps. Don't worry
about me being invisible. Other
than that I'm perfectly normal.
EMMA
I see.
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
Or rather, you don't. Learnt the
tricks in camouflage. Till this
accident made a prang of things.
How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
203
MINISTRY - ANOTHER OFFICE
Steed on the phone.
STEED
I say, Trubshaw, Steed here ...
Barometer's falling fast. Mrs.
Peel and I find ourselves in
need of foul weather gear.
(beat)
Yes, I'd say gentlemen's snuff
for starters. And then --
204
INVISIBLE JONES' OFFICE
File pages flip through the air as Jones goes through them.
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me
to play a hunch:
Valentine Peel.
EMMA
Peter's brother?
But --
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
Half-brother to be precise.
Emma is surprised.
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ...
research into robotics and plastics.
Overtaken by Peter's work on the
physics of climate change ...
EMMA
I know all this.
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
Do you also know that during your
final experiment, your halfbrother-
in-law was under surveillance?
EMMA
Surveillance? By whom?
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
Father. She gave him an 'all clear'
after a security test by Dr. Darling.
EMMA
Who's now vanished.
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
Makes two of us.
EMMA
Are you suggesting that Dr. Darling
and Valentine were somehow in this
together? But that's absurd.
Steed enters behind them on the run --
STEED
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
EMMA
Hurry?
What for?
I'm just
now --
STEED
You didn't tell her?
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
(testy)
I was getting to it.
EMMA
Getting to what?
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
The World Council of Ministers meets
tomorrow to convene the new global
defense initiative --
EMMA
I fail to see --
STEED
There's a reception this evening. Colonel
Jones thinks it advisable we attend.
EMMA
Have we been invited?
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
(poker-voiced)
Under the circumstances Mother didn't
see fit, but I think I can get you in ...
EMMA
(surveys her male
outfit)
Well, I can't possibly go like this.
STEED
I had a feeling. That's why we're
in a hurry ...
Steed proffers an arm to Emma.
STEED
May I have the honor, Mrs. Peel?
She decides, takes his arm.
EMMA
You may, Mr. Steed.
The A-team is born.
Steed and Emma tip their hats to Jones.
205
MOTHER'S 22 BUS (AKA INSIDE MOBILE HQ) - NIGHT
At the controls, Brenda looks on.
She hands a bag of jelly babies to Mother.
Who
picks out his favorites, as he gives a briefing to Father and others, sitting in
passenger seats --
ORDERS BARKED OUTSIDE as --
MOTHER
Inside that hall are some of the
Most powerful figures in the
world. Tight security. Our
only option.
FATHER
I'll see to it personally.
Brenda glances over at Father's imperturbable face. As --
207
PALACE (WESTMINSTER) - NIGHT
Up in the gallery, Steed and Emma enter through a secret passage behind a painting.
He with bowler and umbrella.
She in black leather and boots.
They find themselves in
a niche and freeze, very close to one another.
Steed sniff s ...
STEED
What's that you're wearing?
EMMA
It's called Black Leather.
STEED
Intoxicating. Here, have one of
these.
He fumbles with a bulging jacket pocket
EMMA
What is it?
STEED
Limpet bomb. Small, very
compact. From Trubshaw's.
EMMA
(hocks it on
belt)
When all this is over, we simply
must get you out of that suit.
STEED
You first.
EMMA
Shall we?
She leads the way through marble halls, arched galleries, red velvet carpets, glittering
chandeliers.
From the hall, a SPEECH ECHOES:
MINISTER (V.O.)
... In the uncertain climate that threatens
this global initiative, no magic umbrella
can shield us.
Steed checks out his own.
MINISTER (V.O.)
Only our own vigilance. Security and
stability are our watchwords.
APPLAUSE.
Steed pauses, offers Emma a small silver box.
Inside...
EMMA
Trubshaw again? What now?
STEED
Snuff.
(off Emma's lock)
I must insist you try some.
Steed takes some; Emma follows his example.
Weird.
Does it make you high?
They
walk on, open doors to --
209
PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT
An empty gallery.
Steed and Emma peer down at a --
210
MARBLE HALLWAY
A black and white floor.
Butlers move across like surreal chess pieces.
Otherwise,
empty.
A chamber ensemble plays "The Merry Widow" waltz, which floats through
empty halls.
STEED
They're playing your song, Mrs.
Peel.
EMMA
(annoyed)
'The Merry Widow?' I might have
known. Where's the reception?
They move cautiously forward as
211
PALACE - NIGHT
Down in the hallway, Steed and Emma search for the Ministers.
They head down a
corridor, then hear a NOISE.
They hide behind pillers. As --
Butlers walk past in military file, carrying elaborate displays of lobster and meats.
Steed steals --
A chicken leg.
Nibbles on it.
Suddenly another door opens -- Emma hides.
Steed
looks up to see -- Father "staring" at him.
STEED
Oh, hello ...
FATHER
We want Mrs. Peel.
STEED
Dead, I'm afraid.
Emma in hiding, listens as --
FATHER (O.S.)
You disobeyed an order, Steed.
Mrs. Peel is dangerous; she cannot
be trusted.
Emma looks out the window behind her; eyes widen ... back to --
STEED (O.S.)
I think she can.
(beat)
Can you?
Emma is deeply affected by Steed's choice.
Father's face, meantime, has turned to stone.
FATHER
I shall summon security.
She turns, almost walks into the door as she slips away.
Emma returns as the ALARM is raised --
STEED
Bad news. Father's looking for you.
Where are those bloody ministers?
EMMA
Have a look at this.
She leads him to the window:
sure enough -- heavy snow.
Steed reacts, eyes wide.
STEED
It's almost May, for heaven sake.
214
PALACE - NIGHT
Steed returns, rushes across the marble halls --
To Emma. But up ahead, sees --
216
STEED'S POV - FROM WINDOWS
A purple fog seeping into the hallway, billowing through the corridors as --
217
PALACE ANTEROOM - NIGHT
Inside an anteroom, like a Roman arena -- marble pillars, red carpet, golden walls,
ceiling murals --
The World Council ministers assemble:
slick pin-striped suits or African robes, Chinese
Mao-suits, Indian Nehru-jackets, all distinguished men and women, surrounded by --
Fussing officials, minor dignitaries, and butlers, bowing and weaving a web of
diplomatic protocol, interrupted by --
218
CENTER OF HALL
The sight of Emma Peel in black leather.
She strides into the room.
Picks a glass of champagne from a passing butler.
All stare,
Emma raises her glass --
EMMA
Gentlemen, ladies. Forgive the breach
of protocol. An emergency --
From the hallway -- BOOM -- !
The door bursts open, Emma is blown over by the
blast as the purple cloud races inside.
219
SEVERAL ANGLES
as the smoke furls around the ministers, they choke, fall.
From the doors -- Steed leaps in, gives Emma another snort of snuff --
STEED
Quick --it'll protect you --
Emma inhales.
Now immune to the gas, Steed and Emma hear -- CRASH -- !
They
see -- through thick cloud -a mysterious man in a white lab coat, wearing a gas mask,
leading a group of butlers, all in gas masks -- heads like black flies -- in formation
round the ministers, helpless on the floor.
A kidnapping --
The man and butlers haul away several ministers, and --
Escape from the rear doors.
The butlers form a guard to protect the man.
Steed and Emma run after them.
More butlers pursue.
220
MOTHER'S HQ - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Mother, Brenda, et al choke on purple smoke in the bus ...
222
PALACE HALLWAY - NIGHT
Behind pillars, Steed and Emma hide as --
Butlers in gas masks patrol the halls.
A butler passes them without noticing.
They try
to emerge.
But another patrols --
Steed trips the butler with his umbrella, then chops him down on the ground.
He rises
but Emma kicks him into as --
Behind them Steed sees the lab-coated man escape up the stairs, protected by a posse
of butlers.
He shouts --
STEED
After him, Mrs. Peel!
A whole posse of butlers then advances.
Steed faces them.
STEED
Go -- !
Emma hesitates.
Then turns, heads for an ornate dual shaft elevator.
She bangs the
button, gets inside, doors shut, as the BULLETS from MACHINE-GUNNING gas
masked butlers strike the brass door as --
Steed whips his rapier from his umbrella and duels with the butlers.
To give Emma
time, he uses every trick and prop at his disposal, plus, brute force to --
Kick, chop, punch, and impale them into submission, as --
223
ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Emma sighs with relief.
COOL HUM as the ELEVATOR rises.
227
ON STAIRS - MEANWHILE
Steed gaining on the butlers, heading for the stairs, as --
228
At the next floor, the doors open --
Two butlers rush inside.
BLAM -- !
Emma cuts one in the throat with an elbow
punch,
then --
Punches -- kicks -- stabs the other butler, a more brutish type, who recovers enough to
grab Emma by the throat.
She chokes, breaks his stranglehold, swerves him round, gains a nelson hold on his
arms and throat --
And a knee in his back in time for --
PING!
The BELL RINGS at --
3rd floor where --
Emma spins her captive butler round, in time to face --
Whooomph!
a blast of fire from --
A flamethrower launched in the hall.
Aaargh -- !
The butler gets fried, but --
229
ELEVATORS - CONTINUOS ACTION
Slam shut.
COOL HUM ...
231
ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Up Emma goes.
Looks for an escape route.
Bangs on the walls.
No trap doors.
No

The "floor" light flickers between floors.
Waiting, until ...

ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
-- and looks round.
Nobody there.
Until, as we --
PULL BACK UP to reveal -- FROM ABOVE, spread-eagled like an X on the elevator
roof, limbs flexed against the walls is --
Emma, who -- drops down and --
Scissors the butler's head between her legs.
The grenade rolls free ...
Emma twists around, grabs his ears, and --
Sits on his face.
Buries his head in her crotch.
A muffled sound from the guy, until --
Emma scissor kicks, breaking his neck.
She drags --
238
ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE AND BELOW - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Breaks from its ropes, and --
Plummets down the elevator shaft, shaking the building as it crashes --
240
PALACE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Everything shakes with the impact of the elevator as Steed battles his way up, step by
step, throwing gas-masked butlers over his shoulder as he struggles...
241
PALACE ATTIC - NIGHT
Up the winding staircase, at the top, a skylight, which --
Flips open.
The man leaps out, throwing back inside a smoke grenade, and locks the
skylight.
As the grenade --
242
NARROW STAIRCASE
BOOM!
explodes in the narrow staircase, fills it with purple smoke.
Emma rushes
thru smoke, choking.
She gets to the skylight, tries to open it -- locked.
A moment's panic.
Then Emma -- punches a hole in the glass, flicks the switch, flips
the skylight up, and --
Emerges into the night air.
Snowflakes tumble around her.
243
CHOPPER - NIGHT
Above London rooftops, after dark --
The man (still wears gas mask) the Pilot, CO-PILOT and a Butler (ditto).
From the
chopper, a giddy look down thru a glass command module.
A fairy tale, snow white
city.
OVER the RADIO, interference.
A changing of stations.
Then a CRACKLY
broadcast of "The Merry Widow."
As the WALTZ serenades them high above the city
--
a KNOCKING from outside on the door --
Surprised reactions.
The Butler opens the door, sees --
Emma hanging onto the helicopter struts.
The Butler is too dumbstruck to say
anything.
EMMA
(shouts, re:
the
gas mask)
Anyone ever tell you you look
like a housefly?
Emma grabs his epauletted shoulder, yanks him up, flicks him out --
The Butler is jerked out -- flies into the open air.
Emma watches him fall ...
EMMA
Anyone else need a lift?
The white-coated Man moves forward, but Emma is out, slamming the door, still
clinging ...
MAN
(to Pilot; intercom)
Can't you throw her off?
The Pilot nods, works controls, the chopper dips as --
Blam -- !
a kinky leather boot crashes --
Into the Pilot's face as Emma kicks in the GLASS from the front of the chopper,
SMASHES so the Pilots can't see -- a sudden rush of cold air --
The INSTRUMENT PANELS WHIRR round as the Pilots struggle for control --
VOICE (V.O.)
(intercom)
Where'd she go?

CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT
The white-coated Man gets control ...

CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT
The Man sees the bomb ...
Also flings himself onto the bridge as --
Against b.g. of the fireworks display --

WIDE ANGLE - TOWER BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT
BOOM! -- the CHOPPER EXPLODES.
Ball of flames.
The crowd roars in
appreciation ... great fireworks!

TRUBSHAW'S - DAWN
On Jermyn Street, snow lies waist high.
BLARING SIRENS.
Searchlights.
PA
announcements urge citizens to stay indoors ... PULL BACK to reveal a fire glows, a
CLOCK TICKS calmly.
Emma sits with her shoe, surrounded by a pile of shoes.
Steed & Trubshaw beside her.
EMMA
This time the shoe's on the other
foot. You said a hand-made shoe
was as good as a photo-fit or
D.N.A.? Well, all we have to do is
find the shoe that fits ...
TRUBSHAW
It should be easy. A Trubshaw
client has his shoes delivered
personally. The Ministry should
be able to confirm our delivery.
STEED
I'll be back ...
EMMA
Where are you going?
STEED
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather
may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
EMMA
You needn't bother. I can't drag you
further into this. After all, I am still
the chief suspect.
STEED
No bother. Mother and Father think
I've joined you. I might as well.
EMMA
But --
STEED
(comes back)
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about
time you got rid of that chip on your
shoulder.
EMMA
If you'd been through what I have,
you wouldn't --
Steed reaches and pulls off the micro-bug from her shoulder.
STEED
A microtag. One of Mother's little
toys. There you are. Free at last.
He tips his bowler off her surprised reaction.
270
TRUBSHAW'S BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION
An armory.
Steed stands before racks of umbrellas, displayed like ceremonial swords --
ivory handles, duck handles, you name it ...
Steed hefts a few, as picky as a Samurai ...

UPSTAIRS - HOURS LATER
Emma surrounded by a mountain of shoes.
Triumphantly, she holds up a pair of shoe
lasts.
EMMA
Prince Charming, I presume.
Your name is ...

TRUBSHAW
She just left, sir. In a hurry.

What?
TRUBSHAW
She said you'd understand.

Worried.

Inside the archives, among leather volumes.
A file goes through the air, passed to

A map is opened across a desk from her.
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were
delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park.
Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the
site of a former Ministry installation...
EMMA
... and now?
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
Privately owned by ...
EMMA
Let me guess:
Wonderland Weather.
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
EMMA
I shall need a small plane.
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
You're not venturing alone, surely.
EMMA
I'm going to find out who killed
my husband. Will you take these
documents to Steed?
INVISIBLE JONES (V.O.)
Of course.

SECRET SERVICE HQ - DAY
below the Thames as at the beginning.
In darkest paranoia, Mother lies at the heart of his Labyrinth.
Controls around him
flash emergency.
Panic.
Cakes piled up beside him, uneaten.
Beside him, Father.
Brenda hands a phone.
BRENDA
Steed for you.
Mother grabs the phone, furious.
MOTHER
Where's Mrs. Peel?
He signals frantically for Father to trace the call, but being blind, Father just sits
there.
STEED (V.O.)
(filtered)
I was hoping you could tell me.
MOTHER
You're getting yourself into terrible
trouble, my son. Weather's turning
very nasty -- and so am I.
STEED (V.O.)
(filtered)
I'm going to follow up on a hunch of
my own. If I'm right, Mrs. Peel is
innocent and you have a mole.
MOTHER
(grabs mirror;
searches his face)
Where?
STEED (V.O.)
(filtered)
In your operation.
MOTHER
I'm warning you for the last time,
Steed: whoever's behind all this,
looks like Mrs. Peel, walks like
Mrs. Peel and kills like Mrs. Peel.
CLICK.
The line goes dead.

CLOSE ON MOTHER
Furious.
MOTHER
Steed??

Find Mrs. Peel.
Brenda smiles at the thought.
Father rises, grim.

A GUARD patrols.
Emma pushes herself against a wall.
The wall gives way to flip
round, and Emma swivels into --
286
TOTALLY DARK CHAMBER
The door locks behind.
Alone, Emma stands warily.
From nowhere, a chilling, disembodied voice.
Intimate.
Seductive.
VOICE (V.O.)
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have
been a worthy opponent. You have
tracked us down. You are within an
ace of winning.
EMMA
This isn't a game.
VOICE (V.O.)
Quite right, but we still make the rules.
EMMA
Rules are made to be broken.
VOICE (V.O.)
People, too.
EMMA
Then who wins?
VOICE
You and I. Together. But first you
must confront your greatest enemy.
Who could that be, Mrs. Peel?
The answer is obvious ...
Suddenly lights!
Emma is in a hall of mirrors.
VOICE (V.O.)
Yourself.
In every direction Emma turns, a thousand reflections of herself stare back at her,
splintered into fragments as Emma spins, freaked and confused by the multiple images.
Emma turns into herself -- only herself drapes arms around her and kisses her on the
lips.
Bad Emma -- whose eyes stare into Emma's startled ones as Emma pulls her mouth
away, staggers back; realizes too late.
The hallucinogenic lip poison.
Emma crumples
to her knees as --

A face peering in:
Father.
FATHER
(filtered)
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome,
Mrs. Peel.
(filtered)
We've been expecting you. We hope
you'll enjoy your stay with us.
Decontamination is almost complete.
EMMA
Decontamination -- ?
FATHER
And you've a new wardrobe. He
does want you to look attractive.
(beat )
He tells me you're very beautiful.
Emma pounds the glass in frustration.
FATHER
Relax, Mrs. Peel. We're hundreds
of feet below ground. The Ministry
made it impregnable. No one can
save you.

UNDERGROUND HQ - DINING ROOM
Bathed in candlelight.
A romantic supper for two ...
A door opens, admitting -- Emma. Dressed, coiffed, super-glamorous.
She locks
around, sees another door.
In search of escape she hastens to open it, only to reveal --
A giant rabbit -- the one we saw at the Teddy Bear meeting.
Emma gasps in surprise, moves back into the room as he advances, removing the
head -- it's Dr. Darling!!!
DR. DARLING
Emma, my dear. How lovely you
look.
He steps out of the rest of his costume ...
EMMA
Would that I could say the Same.
DR. DARLING
Ah, but you haven't see the real
me. Watch closely ...
He pulls at his face, which bubbles and collapses as he walks towards her --
Emma's horrified expression, eyes widening as --
Dr. Darling turns into ... Peter!
EMMA
Peter ...
PETER
Darling Emma --
EMMA
It was you ... all the time?
PETER
Not really. Not quite. I'm
afraid you still don't see ...
Again he claws at his face, pulling, twisting ...
Emma winces at the sight, her eyes popping out of her head.
It's Valentine!
TEACHER (V.O.)
Valentine Peel ...

Come, come, you're a widow -- a
most attractive widow. Now I think
of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
He pushes a button.
Bad Emma enters.
Tattooed Z424.
Unmistakably hostile.
VALENTINE
My latest model. A compound of
plastics and sensor chips. A big
improvement on the old X404s.
The poor thing is quite fond of me.
Emma, say hello to Emma.
BAD EMMA HISSES, a strange mix of STATIC and FEEDBACK.
VALENTINE
You know, I believe she's actually
jealous.
EMMA
Valentine, listen to me ...
VALENTINE
Right, bridesmaid. Now what
have I left out? Oh, yes, I know:
the ring.
EMMA

Ring?

That's better. I say, isn't this
where you came in? It's
impenetrable, by the way ...
EMMA
You're mad.
VALENTINE
Entirely. On the other hand
(he advances towards
her, smiling)
Mad people get things done. Let
me show you --
307
UNDERGROUND H.Q. - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Steed stealing down a corridor and --
hides, as a posse of guards rushes past, alerted by the peacock cameras.
He waits till
they pass, then reaches out his umbrella, and --
Nabs Father around the neck who was feeling her way after them.
Brings her down.
FATHER
Steed
STEED
How did you guess?
FATHER
You reek of Mrs. Peel's Black
Leather ...
STEED
It was you who gave Valentine
Peel his security clearance ...
you're the mole who betrayed
the Ministry.
FATHER
Mother betrayed me. She was
going to replace me with a younger
Father.
Errand boy that's all I was.
'Find Steed...'
STEED
Well, you found me. Have a sniff of
this, why don't you? Careful, the
scent can be overpowering ...
Holding Father securely, Steed forces her nose into his rose boutonniere, squeezes the
rubber tube, sprays a Mist.
Father passes out.
Steed rises, locks around.
Sees --
A grille and removes it, climbs in and replaces it before the guards return.
He turns
and --
308
DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION
crawls forward through a mass of wires and plumbing --
until he hears a VOICE -- VALENTINE'S.
Steed reaches another grille, through which he can see --
309
TORTURE CHAMBER
Emma's coffin, standing on end, like the Iron Maiden faces a wall of TV monitors as
Valentine explains.
VALENTINE
People expect weather to be free.
They're used to it. I call that a
denial of freedom. No freedom of
choice. An abuse of human rights.
They buy water, electricity, gas.
Why shouldn't they be able to buy
their own weather if they want to?
If they have a little incentive ...
Emma reacts -- also Steed (unseen) behind her.
EMMA
Such as?
VALENTINE
Destruction of their local weather
systems. I can zap a thousand
Chernobyls into the air.
EMMA
The result would be ...
VALENTINE
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop
failure.
Economic disaster.
Frostbite or sunburn ... on a
massive scale.
You've seen a few samples...
EMMA
Then what's stopping you?
VALENTINE
One very small thing. A diamond
'cyclone' chip. A thousand times
more information on a fraction of
the size. If I possess that, my
powers would be unlimited. My
dear half-brother was developing
it. But he suspected sabotage.
He gave the chip to ... you,
'Mrs.' Peel. I want you. But
also your ring.
Valentine takes her by the hand. Kisses --
310
CLOSEUP - HER RING
A diamond.
In the light, a patterned imprint.
ZOOM IN -- a complex fractal equation of circuits.
311
BACK TO SCENE
VALENTINE
The missing piece of the jigsaw.
I tried to get you to give it to me
as Peter; I tried to steal it from
you as Dr. Darling. As myself I'll
be a bit less subtle.
(he slips it off her
finger; holds it up)
With this ring my plan will be
complete.
EMMA
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean
to say you've waited all these
years because you couldn't create
a chip on your own? That would
have amused Peter.
VALENTINE
Speaking of Peter, there's more good
news: You won't even have to change
your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
EMMA
What are my choices?
VALENTINE
Choices?
EMMA
I'll never marry you.
Valentine is philosophical.
He spins the sarcophagus on an axis, lying it flat -- Emma
lying in her coffin as he looks down at her --
VALENTINE
One out of two isn't bad. I'll keep you
alive, darling Emma. In a year or five,
you may change your mind. If you're
still in it.
Valentine presses a button.
From the ceiling -- a surgical laser.
Moves down to within
inches of her face.
VALENTINE
This little toy gave me back my face.
It can replace yours. What do you think?
Medusa? Madame Defarge? Maggie
Thatcher?
He marks an imaginary line round Emma's face.
An ALARM BELL RINGS.
Emma reacts.
FATHER (V.O.)
Dr. Darling, this is Father. We
have an intruder. I repeat --
Valentine switches off the PA.
VALENTINE
Ah. That will be Steed. He followed
you. Please excuse me. I have work
to do. My most spectacular
performance. A ballet of clouds. It
was made for you. I want to give you
a heart, Emma. I want all of London
to see it. And now with this ...
(flourishes ring)
They will.
(leans close)
And for an encore: the biggest cyclone
in history will wipe the City from the
face of the earth.
(winks)
Shape of things to come, my darling.
He stuffs a gag into Emma's mouth and closes the coffin on her muffled protests.
Darkness.
Immediately, Steed tries to force his way through the grille.
No such luck.
STEED
Blast. What to do? Mrs. Peel!
He doesn't dare say her name too loud -- and there's no telling if she could hear him in
that thing, anyway.
He turns around in the tunnel -- heads the other way.
312
DUCTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Steed crawling.
A rat runs over him ...
STEED
The things I do for England ...
Pitch dark, then --
Emma's coffin is opened and we see Bad Emma, looking down.
Bad Emma stares at her human double -- Emma: who looks imploringly at her to undo
the gag.
Bad Emma removes it, she --
Runs a finger down Emma's body, inside a hole torn in the leather -- warm human flesh.
Blood.
Her flesh.
Her blood.
Fascinated.
EMMA
You must let me go ...
Bad Emma listens.
Gently lays her head on Emma's breast, listens to --
the HEARTBEAT.
Ba-boom.
Ba-boom ...
EMMA
Don't you understand? If he has
me, he'll have no use for you ...
he'll destroy you ...
The words jolt Bad Emma back, remembering her mission.
She goes to the laser, aims
it at Emma's face!
EMMA
No...
Bad Emma hesitates, looks strangely human as --
315
ANOTHER PART OF UNDERGROUND H.Q.
The grille pops off and Steed emerges where the guards are waiting for him --
STEED
Oh, dear.
No escape.
He takes off his bowler -- deftly removes a strip from its brim, aims it at
the guards, and --
Hurls it ...
316
CLOSEUP - BOWLER (IN FLIGHT)
A glinting razor's edge, which --
Swoosh -- !
Slices into the closest guard before returning, like a boomerang to Steed.
He taps twice hard steel as ...
317
OTHER GUARDS
run towards him, Steed swivels gracefully and - slams the bowler in their faces, a
sartorial knuckleduster -- wham -- !
One drops -- Bam -- !
The other collapses, slump
to the ground.
Steed stoops down, picks up his hat, sees --
A dent in its steel top.
For the first time, Steed loses his cool.
Genuine rage.
STEED
Someone's going to pay for this.
Stepping over the nearest body, Steed moves on his way, as --
318
CLOSEUP - VALENTINE
places a ring inside a control module filled with identical-looking diamond chips ...
WIDEN to reveal ...
319
CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
Masses of dials and switches.
( Off to one side, on a wall, a rack of rapiers ... )
Valentine hits a switch ...
VALENTINE
Start the countdown. Action
stations. Five minutes ...
The countdown starts, red digitals going backwards --
Colorized computer screens map out hostile weather fronts.
A COMPUTERIZED VOICE STARTS to COUNT.
The CLOCK TICKS.
Father enters behind him.
FATHER
Congratulations. The clouds are
on course ...
VALENTINE
To explode. London will be ashes.
FATHER
Not yet! They haven't heard our
terms ... !
Father tries to hit the switch.
Valentine yanks her off.
VALENTINE
Are you insane? Stop the program
and you activate the auto-destruct!
FATHER
But all those people -- !
Valentine strikes her hard --
VALENTINE
My cloud ballet! My cyclone!
Father slides to the floor.
Valentine ignores her.
Concentrates on the control panel red
lights, as --
320
MOTHER'S UNDERWATER HQ - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Mother at the controls.
RINGS the ALARM.
Panic stations as -- SIRENS BLARE.
WARNINGS RING OUT OVER TV and RADIO --
MOTHER
Dense cloud formation moving south-
west. On course for the center of the
city. A fog floating in from the river.
The prediction is ... unstable chemical
reaction. Enforce the curfew ...
Emergency stand by ... !
324
HI-TECH TORTURE CHAMBER - DAY
Chaos on all TV monitors as ...
Valentine hastens down the spiral steps and opens Emma's coffin.
What will he find??
Emma's there, still gagged.
Looks asleep.
VALENTINE
My dear.
(pulls the gag:
kisses her)
I wouldn't want you to miss the
grand finale ...
Emma opens her eyes.
Valentine looks down at her, until -- a tell-tale sign:
Z424.
Bad Emma is unmistakable.
He strikes her -- yanks her out of the coffin.
VALENTINE
Find her. Kill her ...
He races back upstairs as ...
330
UNDERGROUND HYDE PARK - HQ CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS
ACTION
Emma makes her way through the labyrinthine superstructure of the place, crawling
high on a girder over some BURBLING LIQUID below.
She hears NOISE IN the
DISTANCE.
Suddenly --
331
UNDERGROUND HQ - STEED - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Steed battles more guards!
No time to lose.
Wham -- ! Bam -- ! Now moving with deadly earnest, Steed downs all oncomers,
closing in on --
332
UNDERGROUND CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Steed rushes in, BOLTS the AIRLOCK behind.
Pounding on door.
He sees the timer racing backwards -- stands over the controls, trying to figure out how
to stop the program.
Looks for the chip -- amongst all the rest it's like trying to find a contact lens in
water.
333
FLOOR-LEVEL HATCH
opens behind.
Valentine emerges, drops the HATCH COVER with a THUD.
Steed
whirls.
VALENTINE
John Steed.
STEED
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone
back to using your original face.
VALENTINE
The last one you'll ever see.
STEED
Perish the thought.
Valentine fulls forth a rapier from the wall.
VALENTINE
Did they tell you at Eton that I
was fencing champion, too?
Steed unsheathes his umbrella, revealing ditto.
STEED
They said you were a very naughty
boy.
The fight is on as the numbers grow smaller!
334
SEVERAL ANGLES
VALENTINE
You're better than I expected.
STEED
I was at Harrow ...
VALENTINE
But did they teach you this?
Valentine whacks the blade off Steed's umbrella handle.
Laughs.
A diminished phallic
symbol.
Steed, dumbfounded.
Valentine advances towards Steed --
Who points the umbrella at him.
STEED
Bang-bang ... you're dead.
VALENTINE
You wish.
He moves to close in, when ...
335
CLOSEUP - FLASH OF LIGHT
from the muzzle, as a BULLET ZIPS out, and --
336
VALENTINE
recoils.
Blood streams from his shoulder.
He looks up, devastated.
Steed blows
smoke away from the muzzle.
STEED
One shot -- for emergencies.
VALENTINE
(clutches wound)
That's not playing by the rules.
STEED
(echoes Emma!)
Rules are made to be broken.
VALENTINE
(pulls his own gun)
If you say so.
STEED
I do.
He FIRES again.
To the heart.
Valentine spins to the floor.
VALENTINE
You said ... one shot.
STEED
Did I? My mistake.
Steed turns to the console, tries to figure out how to stop the countdown, when behind
the hatch opens again, revealing Emma.
Valentine pulls her up, grabs her as hostage --
VALENTINE
I wouldn't do that, if I were you.
Steed turns.
STEED
Mrs. Peel -- !
Valentine has Emma, a knife to her throat, stands over the hatch.
VALENTINE
Bullet-proof waistcoats -- just the
thing. I get mine from Trubshaw's.
We'll be off now, won't we, darling?
(to Steed)
We wouldn't want to miss the
fireworks. Figure it out if you can,
Steed ...
337
DOWN HATCH
Valentine drags Emma, bolting the hatch.
338
ON STEED
He's torn briefly, but there are thousands of lives at stake; Steed goes to the control
module and starts pulling out chips, looking ...
339
CATWALKS - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Valentine drags Emma backwards ...
342
CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The SIRENS CEASE.
Steed allows himself a smile of relief.
345
CONTROL ROOM - ON SCREENS - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Steed sees the breakup of the cyclone ...
Then -- behind him -- an ominous CLICK-CLICKING as the PROGRAM reconfigures.
A DIFFERENT ALARM BUZZER SOUNDS and the words:
"AUTO-DESTRUCT, 3 MINUTES"
start flashing ...
A different set of numbers start running backwards ...
STEED
You must be joking ...
349
TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Steed and Emma race in -- she sees the sarcophagus.
EMMA
Quick!
Emma scrambles in and Steed leaps on top of her, bringing down the lid as ...
357
SEVERAL ANGLES
3-2-1 -- and a BLAST like a nuclear EXPLOSION -- as the Underground HQ is
fragmented to smithereens -- Emma's " coffin" goes flying ... as the SCREEN WHITES
OUT.
358
