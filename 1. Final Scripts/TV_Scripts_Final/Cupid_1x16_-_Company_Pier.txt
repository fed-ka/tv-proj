      INT. CLINIC AREA WAITING ROOM - DAY

      A GROUP OF PEOPLE wait for their blood tests.  From the looks 
      of it, they ve been waiting since the dawn of time.  They all 
      hold numbers in their hands.  The clock TICKS.

          Majordomo-receptionist is GLENDA TRAPP, the bureaucrat s 
      bureaucrat.

      TREVOR arrives...

                                  TREVOR
                          (singing)
                    ... Glad to meet you!  Hope you 
                    know my name!  Uh-huh!  But fooling 
                    you is the nature of my game!  Woo-
                    woo!  Woo-woo!
                          (to the people)
                      Everybody!
                          (singing)
                    Woo-woo!  Woo-woo!
                          (to the people on his 
                            left)
                    On the left!

      Nothing.  They stare at him like lobotomized sheep.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    Now the ladies!  Sing it high!
                          (singing)
                    Woo-woo!  Woo-woo!  Okay, now just 
                    the dried up undead zombies with no 
                    hope left in their souls!  Sing it 
                    low!
                          (singing)
                    Woo-woo!
                            (frustrated)
                    You know the words!  Woo.  Woo.

      Nothing.  He gives up and approaches Glenda.

                    It s too late for these people, 
                    they ve already died.  Let me go 
                    first.

                                  GLENDA
                    Name?

                                  TREVOR
                    Glenda!  It s me!  Trevor.  Second 
                    Monday of every month, I come for

                    They told me their last names.

      GLENDA produces a mini-recorder, places it on the counter and 
      CLICKS it on. WE NOTICE her long fire-engine red, press-on 
      nails.

      The people in the waiting room BURST into APPLAUSE.

                    OUCH!

      INT. HOSPITAL EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

      TREVOR, his eyes tightly shut, squirms and recoils as MAGGIE 
      HOLLINGS --

      young, impish, cute, a physician s assistant -- swabs his arm 
      with alcohol in preparation for taking blood.  Tacked on the 
      wall behind her, a collection of postcards --  Van Gogh 
      masterpieces.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Do we have to go through this every 
                    time?

                                  TREVOR
                    At least scrape the rust off the 
                    needle.

                                  MAGGIE
                    We went out again the other night.

      MAGGIE inserts the needle, but she s said the magic words.  
      His attention is on her relationship; he doesn t notice the 
      prick.  She unwraps the rubber tubing.

                                  MAGGIE (CONT D)
                    Dinner.  Movie.  Music.  It was 
                    nice.

                                  TREVOR
                    Helpful hint:  this time when you 
                    jab the needle in, stop before it 
                    comes out the other side.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Then, back to my place.  Always my 
                    place.
                          (off his arm)
                    All done.  See you next month.

      TREVOR looks at his arm, shocked to see that she s finished.

                                  TREVOR
                    You are the Mozart of bloodsuckers.
                          (then)
                    Bachelors like the woman s place.  
                    It s cleaner and easier to escape.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Or... what if he s not a bachelor?

      MAGGIE packages up the sample and heads out, Trevor close 
      behind.  Before she exits, she looks in her centrifuge.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      4.
      CONTINUED:

      Inside is a Hershey s Kiss. MAGGIE smiles as she pockets the 
      candy.

                                  TREVOR
                    You re worried he s got another 
                    squeeze?

      And they move into...

      INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

      Walking and talking --

                                  MAGGIE
                    He forgets to call, starts playing 
                    his fiddle when we re talking, 
                    won t plan weekends -- and there s 
                    that sacred Thursday night poker 
                    game.

                                  TREVOR
                    So, basically, what you re saying 
                    is that he s undomesticated?

                                  MAGGIE
                    It s like he s got a split 
                      personality.

                                  TREVOR
                    So, why are you still with him?

                                  MAGGIE
                    Because one of the personalities is 
                    really sweet:  my windshield is 
                    clear every morning, Hershey s 
                    Kisses in my centrifuge, fresh 
                      strawberries in my urinalysis 
                    kit...

                                  TREVOR
                    Okay, you don t eat that right?

                                  MAGGIE
                    And every couple days, he sends me 
                      a postcard of a Van Gogh painting.

                                  TREVOR
                            (disapprovingly)
                    You like crazy, one-eared Mr. 
                    Swirly?

                                  MAGGIE
                    All these little surprises that say 
                     I love you. I m thinking of you. 

                                  TREVOR
                    So, to recap, he s perfect except 
                    for the fiddle and the card game.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      5.

                    It s a good policy, Claire.  It s 
                    designed to crack down on sexual 
                      harassment.

                    ... In the Dunking Booth at the 
                    hospital carnival last August, she 
                    dunked me three times.  She was 
                    just so vivacious.  So funny.  So 
                      energetic.  It was this 
                      Shakespearean moment -- love at 
                    first sight.

                    Sometimes I have trouble sleeping 
                    so I drive by her house early in 
                    the morning.  Clear the ice off her 
                      windshield, dig out the

      in a suit and carrying a briefcase.   He strides up to the 
      busy reception desk, shoots his cuffs, puts his leather 
      briefcase on the desk and opens it with a crisp snap. Suave.  
      He definitely practiced this at home.  He removes a small 
      stack of 8X10 pictures and resumes, as KIKI LABROSSE a seen-

      She points to an in/out basket which contains at least 50  
      similar pictures and resumes.  Her phone RINGS.  Kiki grabs

                    I wonder if I might speak to Lorna

                    Is there an African-American 
                    gentleman standing there with you 
                    right now?

      KIKI looks to Champ, he nods yes.

                    Yes.

                    there when I arrive.

      KIKI gets up and runs off.  Champ prepares himself.  The door 
      to the inner sanctum opens and out steps LORNA BENDER, 30, 
      very attractive and very successful.  She smiles broadly at 
      Champ and offers her hand.

                                  LORNA (CONT D)
                    I m Lorna Bender.  Is there

      LORNA smiles.  This is going to be all right.

                    You mortals are so addicted to

                    Right,  us mortals.   And all those 
                    animal sacrifices in the Temple of

                    Guy can never have too many sheep

                    Are you sure she didn t say  nude

                    I know it s hard for you to 
                      understand, but not everything s 
                    about sex.

      The phone RINGS.  Champ answers.

                                  CHAMP (CONT D)
                    Hello?
                          (then surprised)
                    Hi.  Lorna.
                          (listens)
                    Sure.  That d be great.  What time?
                          (jots a note)
                    I ll be there.  Okay.  Bye.

      He hangs up, looking slightly stunned.

                                  CHAMP (CONT D)
                    She just asked me out.  On a date.

      Off Champ, confused.  And Trevor smirking.

      INT. CLAIRE S BEDROOM - DAY

      CLAIRE enters, followed by FRANK CANTOS, intense, sexy, 
      confident and carrying a large, wooden toolbox.  He is as 
      serene as Buddha. He stops halfway into the room, as Claire 
      proceeds to the corner where the wall is marked up with color-
      coded anal retentive little lines.  She doesn t notice he s 
      no longer following.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Now, the closet door will be here --
                    standard size.  These red lines 
                    here indicate...



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    14.
      CONTINUED:


      She looks back over her shoulder and sees Frank wandering 
      about the room, peeking into corners and squinting at random 
      walls.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Mr. Cantos?

      FRANK continues his circuit.

                                  FRANK
                    Call me Frank.

      He looks over, but says nothing and continues his circuit.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Frank?  We re over here.

                                  FRANK
                    I m getting the feel of the room.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Just a plain, old room.  Nothing 
                    special.

      She waits for him to finish, and he sedately wanders over to 
      the patterned wall, which he regards with some disdain.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    I ve marked off --

                                  FRANK
                    It s gonna take six weeks.

                          (astounded)
                    Six weeks?
                          (off Frank s nod)
                    The Hodgins said you were good and 
                    fast.

                                  FRANK
                    I put up a garage for the Hodgins.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (not understanding)
                    And that s easier than a closet?

                                  FRANK
                    You can use power tools for a 
                    garage.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You re not going to use power 
                    tools?

                                  FRANK
                    What kind of doctor are you?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m a psychologist.  Now, as I 
                    mentioned on the phone --

                                  FRANK
                    I m sort of like a psychologist 
                    myself.
                          (off her look)
                    Like people, every room has a 
                    distinct personality.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Except for garages?

      FRANK thinks Claire has figured things out nicely.

                                  FRANK
                    Exactly.
                          (off room)
                    This is a good space. I m going to 
                    help you unlock its potential.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Really?  Because I thought you were 
                    going to build me a closet.

                                  FRANK
                    No, I m going to make you happy.

      He smiles at her.  He certainly does have blue eyes.

                                  CLAIRE
                    A closet would make me happy.

                                  FRANK
                    And that s what you re gonna get.

      CLAIRE stops arguing.  Maybe it s the eyes.

      EXT. MAGGIE S HOUSE - DAY

      MAGGIE emerges, bundled up and ready for work.  She trudges 
      to her car, hoping she won t have to wrestle with the scraper 
      and is delighted to find that once again the job s been done 
      for her. This is the way to start the morning.

      INT. CLAIRE S outer OFFICE - DAY

      CLAIRE enters her office, shedding coat and briefcase, to see 
      Dr. Greeley standing somberly, waiting.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Uh-oh, nothing s quite as scary as 
                    Milton in the Morning.

                    I have some difficult news.
                          (reluctantly)
                    There have been allegations made to 
                    the effect that you may be 
                      having...uh, inappropriate 
                    relations with Trevor Hale.

      CLAIRE can t believe what she s hearing. She feels her 
        professional life crumbling around her.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      INT. CLAIRE S OFFICE - DAY

      GREELEY and Claire listen to a tape recorder.  With them are 
      two suits: ANDREW SELL, a laid-back, slightly rumpled 
      romantic type, and TIM DELAUNE, perfect to the last detail, 
      including a part in his hair straighter than the straightest 
      thing that ever was straight.

                                  CLAIRE ON RECORDER
                    Not tonight.  I m exhausted.

                                  TREVOR ON RECORDER
                    It s not like you ever want to see 
                    me at the office.

                                  CLAIRE ON RECORDER
                    I see you in the morning, I see you 
                    at night, I wouldn t be surprised 
                    if you popped up in my dreams.

      GREELEY looks at Tim.  He shuts off the recorder.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (numbly)
                    That s not in context.
                          (regarding Tim and Andrew)
                    Why are the Human Resources guys 
                    here?

                                  TIM
                    It s a Human Resources issue.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m being fired?

                    Now, Claire --

      TREVOR KNOCKS and enters.  He s in his bartending apron.  He 
      looks like a keg of Guiness just exploded on him which is 
      exactly what s just happened.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Trevor, you re late.

                                  TREVOR
                    Now, Claire, a keg of Irish stout 
                    sprung a leak at Taggerty s same 
                    time I got your call.

                                    GREELEY
                    You managed to get a tap into it?

                    You really think I would have a

                                    GREELEY

                    Given the nature of the tape, we re 
                    required to investigate your 
                      relationship with Mr. Hale.

      TREVOR now understands what s going on...

                            (apologetically)
                    We got caught because she hollers 
                    so loudly when we make love, right? 
                    Well, not to boast, but if you knew 
                    the specifics, you wouldn t blame 
                    her.

                    rooftops!  My darling.  My fertile 
                    crescent.  My own private Idaho.

      No one is amused.  Greeley turns to Claire.

                                  DR. GREELEY
                    During the investigation, Mr. Hale 
                    will have to be reassigned to 
                    another therapist.

      TREVOR is blind-sided by that pronouncement.

                                  TREVOR
                    Okay, joke s over, we re not even 
                    friendly.  It s a strict no 
                    touching zone, we don t even 
                    breathe the same air.  Nothing to 
                    see here, folks, move along.  Move 
                    along.

      FRECHETTE smiles.  It s too late for that.

                                  FRECHETTE
                          (to Claire)
                    I have no doubt these allegations 
                    are false, Claire, but I am 
                    delighted to be helping you with 
                    Mr. Hale s case.

                                  TREVOR
                    Oh, God.

      He looks to Claire.  She shrugs.  It s out of her hands.                                                                                    20.



      INT. HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE - DAY

      Typical shared office space.  A VAN GOGH POSTER adorns the 
      wall between the two desks. MAGGIE and Andrew are making out.  
      As they kiss, Andrew backs Maggie into an ANT FARM, which 
      Andrew catches at the last moment.

                                  ANDREW
                    Oh, God.

                                  MAGGIE
                          (throatily)
                    I know.  I know.  I know.

                                  ANDREW
                    I mean Tim s ant farm.  Could ve 
                    infested the whole hospital.

      He puts it back as carefully as he can.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Where were we?

                                  ANDREW
                    Okay, whoa, time out.  What if Tim 
                    comes back and catches us?

                                  MAGGIE
                    Oooo, would he cut off the supply 
                    of paperclips?

                                  ANDREW
                    He d report us in a heartbeat.  
                    He s not a fun guy like me.  He 
                    takes everything way too seriously.
                          (off the ant farm)
                    He s like an ant.

                                  MAGGIE
                    He can carry ten times his own body 
                    weight?

                                  ANDREW
                    He s all about regulations.  
                      Completely by the book.  The man s 
                    never missed a day s work in his 
                    life.

      MAGGIE leans toward Andrew when Tim enters...

                                  TIM
                    What s up?

      ANDREW just about jumps out of his skin, then freezes in 
      panic.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    21.

                                  ANDREW
                    Uh --

                                  MAGGIE
                    I came here to ask a question about 
                    my health benefits and Mr...?

                                  ANDREW
                    Sell.  Andrew Sell.  Ms...?

                                  MAGGIE
                    Hollings.  Maggie Hollings.  Well, 
                    Mr. Sell and I started discussing 
                    movies.

                                  ANDREW
                    Miss Hollings suggested that Brad 
                    Pitt s Irish accent in --

                                  MAGGIE
                     The Devil s Own  was worse than --

                    Kevin Costner s English accent in 
                     Prince of Thieves. 

      TIM regards them flatly just long enough for them to think 
      that he doesn t believe a word they re saying, when --

                                  TIM
                    What about Sean Connery as a 
                    Russian submarine commander?
                          (imitating Mr. Connery)
                    Mr. Krepsulov, please inform the 
                    Kremlin that the imperialists 
                    running dog lackeys have retreated.

      MAGGIE LAUGHS.  Tim smiles, his facade cracking for just a 
      moment.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Well, I gotta --

      MAGGIE nods politely at Tim, grimaces at Andrew behind Tim s 
      back and takes her leave.  Tim watches her go.

                                  TIM
                    My name s Tim Delaune, by the way --

      But she s gone.  Too late.

                                  ANDREW
                    You weren t coming onto her there, 
                    were you Tim?

      TIM sits at his desk and starts to work.  Andrew sits at his 
      desk and starts playing with a slinky.                                                                                    22.



      INT. FRECHETTE S OFFICE - DAY

      FRECHETTE works at his desk when suddenly a paperclip whizzes 
      past his ear, knocking a mini Wagner bust off of Frechette s 
      computer monitor.  Frechette doesn t even look up.

                                  FRECHETTE
                    I suppose it was your marksmanship 
                    that charmed Dr. Allen?  Please sit 
                    down.

      TREVOR enters and peruses Frechette s belongings.  
      Frechette s office is... Wagnerian.  Heavy, serious, slightly 
      fascist and humorless.  Trevor roams.

                                  TREVOR
                    Very homey place, if you re a 
                    Spartan.

                                  FRECHETTE
                    I did agree not to alter Dr. 
                    Allen s course of treatment, such 
                    as it is. Nevertheless, I am not 
                    Dr. Allen, Trevor.

                                  TREVOR
                    Really?  Because I know Claire 
                    Allen. I ve worked with Claire 
                    Allen. And... Ian Frechette...
                          (eyes him; shrugs)
                    ... you could pass.

                                  FRECHETTE
                    Once again, please sit down.

      TREVOR picks up the Wagner bust, and holding it in front of 
      his face, BELTS OUT a bit of faux Wagnerian Opera at full 
      volume.   Kill De Wabbit!  Kill de Wabbit! 

      FRECHETTE flips through Trevor s file.

                                  FRECHETTE (CONT D)
                    So, you believe that for each 
                    couple you match up, you will win a 
                    bead?
                          (off Trevor s shrug)
                    And when you receive a hundred such 
                    beads, you will magically transport 
                    back to Olympus to resume your life 
                    of leisure.

                                  TREVOR
                    Correct -- except there s no magic.  
                    An invisible fiery chariot will 
                    simply pick me up at Division and 
                    Wacker.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    23.
      CONTINUED:


                                  FRECHETTE
                    I don t think you understand, 
                    Trevor.

                                  TREVOR
                    But if I don t understand Trevor, 
                    who will?

                                  FRECHETTE
                          (calm as a lake)
                    I agreed to keep you off medication 
                    and off the psychiatric ward 
                      sheerlyout of professional 
                    courtesy.  But if you don t sit 
                    down, right now, in that chair, I 
                    will amend your treatment as I see 
                    fit.

      Trevor hears the steel in Frechette and stops moving.

                                  FRECHETTE (CONT D)
                    We will begin by talking about your 
                    earliest memories --

                                  TREVOR
                    I m over three thousand-years-old.  
                    I hope you have a lot of time.

                                  FRECHETTE
                    As a matter-of-fact, I do not.  So, 
                    if necessary, we will find ways to
                      streamline the process.  
                      Electroshock comes to mind.

      A moment, and Trevor makes his decision.  He quickly 
      stretches out on the couch.  Frechette is pleased.  He smiles 
      and makes a note.

      INT. CHAMP & TREVOR S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      TREVOR is searching for something.  He s poking around under 
      the sink, in the fridge, through the garbage.  He s wearing a 
      baseball cap that Mr. Zippy Pizza.  Champ enters.

                                  TREVOR
                    Welcome home from your date.  You 
                    and Lorna Doone what I think you 
                    been doone?

                                  CHAMP
                    We went out and had a nice time.

                                  TREVOR
                    You do a killer  naive. 

                                  CHAMP
                    We barely talked about work.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    24.
      CONTINUED:


      CHAMP observes Trevor curiously.  Trevor is now looking under 
      the couch cushions.

                                  TREVOR
                    So riddle me this, Bachelorman:  
                    would you have asked her out if she 
                    hadn t asked you first?

                                  CHAMP
                    No.

                                  TREVOR
                      Because...

                                  CHAMP
                      I wouldn t want her to think I was 
                    using her to get work.

                                  TREVOR
                    And you don t think she s capable 
                    of using work to get you?

                                  CHAMP
                          (troubled)
                    She did insist on paying for 
                    dinner.
                          (off Trevor s odd 
                            behavior)
                    I m pretty sure I m going to regret 
                    asking this, but -- what the hell 
                    areyou doing?

                                  TREVOR
                    Earning a bead.  Trying to get 
                    home.  That pizza we had delivered 
                    last night -- where s the box?

                                  CHAMP
                    The pizza I had delivered?

                                  TREVOR
                    Details.

      CHAMP begins walking towards Trevor s bedroom.

                                  CHAMP
                    Dare I ask what it s for?

                                  TREVOR
                    If I can prove to this amazing 
                    nurse down at the hospital that her 
                    boyfriend isn t married, that poker 
                    night isn t code for poke-her 
                    night, she ll commit to him.  
                    There s my bead.

      CONTINUED: (2)


      CHAMP gets down on his hands and knees and pulls a pizza box 
      out from under TREVOR s bed.

                                  CHAMP
                    And you need a pizza box to do it?

                                  TREVOR
                    Yep.

      CHAMP pulls out another box, and another...

                                  CHAMP (CONT'D)
                    There you go.  Save two more 
                      relationships.

      EXT. ANDREW S PLACE - NIGHT

      TREVOR comes up the porch looking very much like a pizza 
      delivery guy.  He knocks.  And waits.  No response, but he 
      hears the sound of conversation and laughter from inside. 
      Spotting the window beside the door, he stretches to look in, 
      but can t quite see.  Standing up on the railing, and 
      grabbing the window frame, he can lean out a little further, 
      and finally gets a peek inside.

      angle - Andrew & an attractive blonde sitting on the floor at 
      the coffee table drinking white wine. Although not overtly 
      romantic, it certainly isn t poker with the guys. Just before 
      he loses his f ooting and tumbles into the bushes, Trevor 
      realizes Maggie s in a world of trouble.

                                                                          FADE OUT:

                                                                            FADE IN:

      INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION AREA - DAY

      GLENDA sits at her desk, needlessly harassing the person at 
      the head of a long line.  Trevor enters, doesn t even glance 
      at the admit desk.  Heads straight back to Maggie s 
        workstation.  Glenda notices.  She s irked.

                                  GLENDA
                    Hey!  You can t go back there!

      TREVOR doesn t slow.  He holds up a beaker of amber liquid.

                                  TREVOR
                    Just dropping off a sample, Frau 
                    Blucha, won t be a minute.

      She starts to get up, but THE MAN at the front of the line 
      shoves a sheaf of papers under her nose.  Glenda sits, and, 
      still glaring in Trevor s direction, starts blindly stamping 
      the forms.

      INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

      TREVOR approaches Maggie s area.  The bearer of bad news, 
      he s not his usual jovial self.  Maggie emerges just as he 
      arrives, carrying several hospitally items.  She s happy to 
      see him.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Yeah, I ve seen it before.  First 
                    they re afraid of needles, then 
                    they start to like it.

      She keeps walking, and Trevor follows.

                                  MAGGIE (CONT D)
                          (off the sample)
                    And by the way, I take blood.  That 
                    you can keep.

                                  TREVOR
                    It s apple juice.  To get by 
                    Colonel Klink.

                                  MAGGIE
                    I m sorry, you re scheduled for one 
                    blood test a month and that s all 
                    you re getting.

                                  TREVOR
                    Maggie, I went by Andrew s house 
                    last night.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.
      CONTINUED:


                                  MAGGIE
                    Ah, poker night.  How d you do?

                                  TREVOR
                    There wasn t any poker game.

      A beat as this sinks in.

                                  MAGGIE
                    And lemme guess, he wasn t alone?

      TREVOR winces and shakes his head.  Maggie tries to hide the 
      pain she s feeling without much effect.

                                  MAGGIE (CONT D)
                    See, the rules are there for a 
                    reason.  Fishing off the company 
                    pier anything you catch, you re 
                    gonna have to throw back.

      And a movement catches her eye.  She looks down the hall, 
      causing Trevor to look as well...

      REVEAL - Glenda

      who has obviously heard this last bit of crucial information, 
      and she s damn pleased about it.  Trevor salutes her with his 
       sample.   Then he chugs it.

                                  TREVOR
                    Waste not; want not.

      Off Glenda s look of disgust...

      INT. HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE - DAY

      GLENDA barges in, about ready to bust.  Andrew and Tim look 
      up from their desks, unimpressed by her enthusiasm.

                                  ANDREW
                    Oh, boy, here we go again.

                                  GLENDA
                    You know sometimes I question your 
                      dedication to our job.

                                  TIM
                    Our job?  You re a receptionist.

                                  GLENDA
                    You know my goal is to work in 
                    Human Resources.  That s where the 
                    action is. What s happening with 
                    the Dr. Allen case?





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    28.

                                  TIM
                      Unfortunately, we are unable to 
                    comment on ongoing inquiries.

                                  ANDREW
                    So, unless you have something 
                    new...

                                  GLENDA
                    Maggie Hollings is dating someone 
                    at the hospital.

      ANDREW is shocked into silence.  Tim takes the info in 
      stride.

                                  TIM
                    Do you have any proof?

                                  GLENDA
                    She admitted it right to my face.  
                    Almost.

                                  ANDREW
                    What about a name?

                                  GLENDA
                    No.
                          (off their disinterest)
                    But you have to look into it.

      TIM ushers Glenda toward the door.

                                  TIM
                    If you re going to work in Human 
                      Resources, Glenda, you have to 
                      understand that gossip isn t proof.  
                    You re Doctor Allen tape isn t even 
                    holding up.

                                  GLENDA
                    Then I ll get proof.

      As she leaves.  Tim and Andrew share an exasperated look.

      INT. CLAIRE S OFFICE - DAY

      CLAIRE returns to her office, her chair spins around, 
      courtesy of its occupant:  Trevor (wearing her glasses.)

                                  TREVOR
                          (sounding very Dr. Ruth)

                          (as if this makes it okay)
                    But I m here with an idea.  
                      Matchmaking in Chicago in winter -- 
                    too many layers of clothes.  What 
                    I m thinking is by relocating to 
                    Club Med, flying south for the 
                    winter, all those oiled, nearly 
                    naked bodies --

                                  CLAIRE
                          (the nerve!)
                    I m being investigated for my 
                      relationship with you, and you re 
                      suggesting we hop a plane to Club 
                    Med?

                                  TREVOR
                    Okay, you can come, too.  It ll be 
                    fun! We ll swim, rub lotion on each 
                    other, get a tan, rub lotion on 
                    each other, drink Mai-Tais, rub 
                    lotion on each other.

      Not missing a beat, Claire throws her hands up in the air and 
      backs out of the office.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (yelling)
                    Jaclyn!  Jaclyn!

      CLAIRE flees.  Trevor follows.

      INT. CLAIRE S RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS

      JACLYN looks up.

                                  TREVOR
                    You ll have to pay, though.  I m 
                    tap city.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I am not talking to this man 
                    because I am being investigated for 
                    improper conduct and I don t want 
                    to lose my career.

                                  JACLYN
                    Can I talk to him?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Let me just say that if I had it 
                    all to do over again, I d avoid 
                    him.

                                  TREVOR
                    You miss me.

                    He s a child.  He has no 
                      understanding of what damage he did 
                    by corroborating the charges 
                    against me.

                                  TREVOR
                    I m sorry.

      CLAIRE and Jaclyn regard each other in shock.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Did he say...?

                                  JACLYN
                    Yes.

                                  TREVOR
                    I m in Claire withdrawal.  Give me 
                    a quick fix.  Anything!  A stinging 
                    retort! A withering look!

      Claire provides the withering look without even trying. 
      TREVOR reacts as if Claire s expression is erotic art.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    Oh, yeah.  That was good.  Diss me 
                    again.  This time, say something.  
                    Slowly.

      CLAIRE heads into her office, SLAMMING the door.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    She misses me, too.

                                  JACLYN
                    Yeah, she does. Me too.

                                  CLAIRE (O.S.)
                    I DO NOT MISS TREVOR HALE!

      JACLYN nods:   She does too.   Trevor heads off, satisfied.

      INT. FRECHETTE S OFFICE - DAY

      TREVOR lies on the couch, getting drowsier and drowsier as, 
      Frechette attempts to hypnotize him.  Frechette is a study in 
      ignoring Trevor s remarks.  Trevor uses a  trance voice. 

                                  FRECHETTE
                    The elevator is going down, down...

                    Down, down, past hardwares, past 
                    the bargain basement --

                    As the elevator approaches the 
                    Earth s core, gravity gets 
                    stronger.  You re unable to lift 
                    your limbs.
                          (then)
                    Try to lift your arm.

      TREVOR tries, and cannot.  Frechette is pleased.

                                  FRECHETTE (CONT D)
                    Good.  You trust me.  You trust my

                                  TREVOR
                    You re my friend.  We played Little 
                    League together.  We rode bikes 
                    together.  We indulged in healthy 
                      experimentation at Cub Scout Camp --

                    You see a spiral staircase going

                                  TREVOR
                    Like a lighthouse.

                          (a child s voice, worried)
                    Mom and Dad... they re fighting.

                    What about?

                                  TREVOR
                    Whether or not to destroy Atlantis.

                                  FRECHETTE
                    Another step...




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.

                    There s a rock floor.  Stone.  
                    Thick.

                                  FRECHETTE
                    No, it s paper.  It s mist.  It is 
                    your delusion.  Listen to me.  Take 
                    the step.

                                  TREVOR
                            (struggling)
                    I -- I can t.  It hurts.

                                  FRECHETTE
                    It may be painful, but I want you 
                    to step back to before you were a 
                    god. Before the delusion.

      A long silence...  Is Trevor seeing his past?

                                  TREVOR
                    A girl...

                                  FRECHETTE
                          (feels he s onto 
                            something)
                    What girl?

                                  TREVOR
                          (heartbroken)
                    She s leaving.  She s never coming 
                    back.  My heart... it s breaking.

                                  FRECHETTE
                    What s her name?

                                  TREVOR
                    It s broken.  My heart is broken.  
                    Can t take the pain.  I have to 
                    heal my heart.    I have to heal 
                    all the broken hearts...

      FRECHETTE smiles.  He s made a huge breakthrough.

      INT. CLAIRE S BEDROOM - NIGHT

      CLAIRE comes home to find Frank packing up his tools.  Claire 
      notes that nothing has been done on the closet.  She shivers.

                                  FRANK
                    Long day?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Why s it so cold in here?





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.
      CONTINUED:


      FRANK indicates the paper plate-sized hole in the wall 
      opposite the proposed closet space.  It s covered in opaque 
      plastic.

                                  FRANK
                    I should have that finished soon.

                                  CLAIRE
                    There s a hole in my wall.

                                  FRANK
                    It won t be a hole for long.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I wanted a closet, over there.  On 
                    that wall.

      CLAIRE points at the opposite wall.  Frank shrugs.

                                  FRANK
                    Dr. Allen, how seriously would you 
                    take it if I told you should start 
                      prescribing more lithium to your 
                    patients?

                                  CLAIRE
                    As long as we re drawing analogies, 
                    wouldn t it make you nervous if 
                    your psychologist didn t use modern 
                    tools of the profession?  If she 
                    said,  hold still, let the leech 
                    get proper suction. 

                                  FRANK
                    I don t need a psychologist.

                                  CLAIRE
                    That remains to be seen.  Please, 
                    plug something in!  A belt sander!  
                      A cordless drill!  How about an 
                    electric hole fixer?  Handy for 
                    those sub-zero Chicago nights.

                                  FRANK
                    Plug in a cordless drill?

                                  CLAIRE
                    It s freezing.  How am I supposed 
                    to fall asleep, tonight?

                                  FRANK
                    You re such a big fan of electric 
                    devices, can I suggest --

                                  CLAIRE
                    Don t you dare!



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

      FRANK pauses.  This woman is crazy.

                                  FRANK
                    An electric blanket.

                                  CLAIRE
                    An electric blanket.  Of course.
                          (attempts to laugh it off)
                    I m sorry.  That was my Trevor 
                    reflex.

      FRANK has no idea what that means.  He ignores it.

                                  FRANK
                    Look, if, when I m done, you re not 
                    happy with the results, there ll be 
                    no charge.  Do your customers get 
                    that guarantee?

      FRANK picks up his toolbox, departs.  Claire calls after him.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t have customers.  I have 
                    patients.

                                  FRANK (O.S.)
                    Not nearly enough.

      CLAIRE shakes her head, not appreciating the pun.

      INT. ANDREW S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      ANDREW is playing a playful little number on his violin as 
      Maggie returns to the living room. Andrew sets down the 
      violin.

                                  ANDREW
                    Okay, a complete tour of the house.  
                    No sign of a live-in girlfriend.

                                  MAGGIE
                    What happened to your Thursday 
                    night poker game?

      ANDREW doesn t miss a beat.  He LAUGHS.

                                  ANDREW
                    Is that what this is about?  Don in 
                    Pharmacy ratted me out, huh?  Well, 
                      I cancelled it.  Would you like to 
                    know what I did instead?
                          (off Maggie s nod)
                    I had dinner with the wife of my 
                    best friend from college.

      MAGGIE breathes a sigh of relief.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    35.

                    I m sorry to sound so suspicious...

                                  ANDREW
                    Have I done something to make you 
                    mistrust me?

                                  MAGGIE
                    Why haven t you brought me here 
                    before?

      Guilt and worry flash over his face.  This is hard.

                                  ANDREW
                    You ve heard about the Cupid Cops, 
                    right?

                                  MAGGIE
                    You re afraid the Cupid Cops will 
                    catch us?  They re fictional, like 
                    the Boogeyman, a story someone made 
                    up to keep us in line.

                                  ANDREW
                    Maggie, they re real.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Even if they did exist, why would 
                    they watch your apartment any more 
                    carefully than mine?

                                  ANDREW
                    Sometimes my boss drops by.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Tim?  He s a Cupid Cop?

                                  ANDREW
                    Uh, we both are.

                          (takes that in, then, 
                            touched)
                    You re risking your career to see 
                    me?

                                  ANDREW
                    You see why I maybe act a little 
                    weird.  Especially now.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Why now?

                                  ANDREW
                    We heard a rumor this morning -- 
                    about you.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    36.

                    lover I m supposed to be seeing?

                                  ANDREW
                    We re looking into it.

                                  MAGGIE
                    So, with this Cupid Cop job... do 
                    you get handcuffs?

      The pair get lost in kissing.

      INT. CHAMP & TREVOR S APARTMENT - DAY

      TREVOR sees Champ enter looking a little dazed and confused.

                                  TREVOR
                    How d Lorna take the news?

                                  CHAMP
                    Didn t quite get all the words out.

                                  TREVOR
                    She told you that you re the 
                    loviest, doviest, most cuddly-
                    wuddly boy-toy in town, and you 
                    folded.

                                  CHAMP
                    No.  She told me she got me an 
                    audition for a national truck 
                      commercial.
                          (beat)
                    That s when I folded.

      Off Champ looking sheepish.

      INT. HALL OUTSIDE CLAIRE S OUTER OFFICE - NIGHT

      close - feet walking down the hallway.  We pan up to --

      REVEAL - a massive ring of keys as one after another is tried 
      in a lock.  Finally one works, and we continue to pan up to

      REVEAL - Glenda as she enters Claire s office, flashlight in 
      hand.

      EXT. ANDREW S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      POV SHOT - MAGGIE & ANDREW

      kiss goodbye at the front door.  Andrew shuts the door and 
      Maggie heads for her car.  She looks up to see --                                                                                    37.



      REVERSE ANGLE - TIM

      watches from his car.  To his surprise, Maggie crosses over 
      to him and knocks on his window.  Maggie is two parts 
      sadness, one part disdain...

                                  MAGGIE
                    Do you like your job, Tim?

                          (joyless)
                    Not always.  But it s important.

                                  MAGGIE
                    I love my job.  And I love Andrew.  
                    Your job is to spoil all that.  How 
                    is that important?

      She favors him with one more sad look and heads over to her 
      own car.  Tim, emotionless, rolls up his window again.

      INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION AREA - DAY

      ANDREW strides up to Glenda s desk.

                                  ANDREW
                    You better not have called me down 
                    here cause you saw a couple people 
                    making eyes in the cafeteria.

      She hands him a bright red folder marked  CONFIDENTIAL. 

                                  GLENDA
                    Here s your proof that Maggie 
                    Hollings is having an affair with 
                    employee number 21245.

                                  ANDREW
                      Two-one-two-four-five?
                          (then, off the folder)
                    A case file from Dr. Allen.  This 
                    is completely illegal.

                                  GLENDA
                    You wanted proof.  Frankly, I was 
                    hoping to find something out about 
                    Dr. Allen and her lunatic patient.  
                    In any case, you didn t say it had 
                    to be legal.

      And off Andrew s nervous expression...

      INT. HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE - DAY (TIME CUT)

      INT. CLAIRE S OFFICE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

      For the first time, the camera FINDS the Mystery Patient.  
      And it s our TIM, lovelorn and in pain.

                                  TIM
                    All I know is that I love Maggie

      ANDREW considers what he s discovered.  A smile blooms on his 
      face.  All his problems have just been solved.

      INT. HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICE - DAY

      MAGGIE enters Tim and Andrew s office wearing a worried 
      expression.  Tim is there, rolling up the Van Gogh poster 
      which had been on the wall.  A box containing the rest of his 
      personal effects sits on his now barren desk.

                                  MAGGIE
                    You re leaving?

                                  TIM
                    Moving on.

      MAGGIE looks questioningly at Andrew.  Andrew is impassive.

                                  MAGGIE
                    I m gonna miss seeing that poster 
                    when I come in here.

      TIM presents her with the poster.

                                  TIM
                    A parting gift.
                          (to Maggie)
                    I really hope things work out for 
                    you.

      There s a sincerity and sadness in his voice that registers 
      on Maggie.  He nods, and takes his leave.  Maggie looks 
      questioningly at Andrew.

                                  ANDREW
                    He resigned.

                                  MAGGIE
                    That s good for us.

                                  ANDREW
                    Get this.  We got evidence that he 
                    was in love with a hospital 
                    employee.  I mean desperately in 
                    love.  He quit before Greeley could 
                    fire him.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Well, at least he s got integrity.

      They share a moment of relief.

      MAGGIE opens the centrifuge and finds it... empty.

      INT. CHAMP & TREVOR S APARTMENT - DAY

      CHAMP has a toy truck set out on the kitchen table.  He moves 
      around it pointing out the features, rehearsing for his 
      commercial audition.

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL - TREVOR

      who shakes his head  no.   That s all wrong.  Trevor moves 
      over to the truck, shows Champ a  better  approach, indicates 
      he should smile more by pushing up the corners of his mouth.

      INT. CLAIRE S FOYER - MORNING

      TREVOR walks up to Claire s house with a donut bag.  He picks 
      up her paper, takes the comics section, then places the donut 
      bag and paper on the welcome mat, RINGS the bell, then runs 
      away.

      EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

      MAGGIE goes out to her car.  Pauses, a bit disappointed, when 
      she discovers her windshield has not been de-iced.  She 
      shrugs and gets out her scraper.

      INT. FRECHETTE S OFFICE - DAY

      TREVOR stretched out on the couch staring vacantly at the 
      ceiling, his lips moving.  Frechette nodding along, taking 
      notes, pleased with the progress.

      INT. CLAIRE S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

      CLAIRE watches from her bedroom doorway while Frank, unaware 
      of her presence, sexily sands something.

      END MONTAGE.

      INT. FRECHETTE S OFFICE - DAY

      TREVOR is on Frechette s couch again, fully entranced.  
      Frechette takes notes proudly.

                                  TREVOR
                          (trance voice)
                    I was her first -- she was mine.  
                    We trusted each other with our 
                    hearts.

      CLAIRE enters, quietly.  With a wave and a  shush  gesture 
      Frechette tells her to listen quietly and witness the marvel 
      that is Trevor s progress.TREVOR does not notice a thing.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

                                  TREVOR
                    Even my mom liked her.

      FRECHETTE shoots Claire a look of supreme smugness.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    Everyone did.  So beautiful, 
                    innocent.  I loved her so much... I 
                    wish the pain would go away.  I 
                    want everyone s pain to go away...

      CLAIRE reacts.  Has Frechette really gotten to Trevor s core?

                                  FRECHETTE
                    Tell me her name.

                                  TREVOR
                    But we were never happier than the 
                    time we went to Club Med together.  
                    We swam, rubbed lotion on each 
                    other, drank Mai-Tais, rubbed 
                    lotion on each other...  She 
                    surprised me with the tickets.  Two 
                    first class tickets.  She knew how 
                    the winters make me suffer.

      CLAIRE bites her upper lip, decides not to say a word.

      INT. TAGGERTY S - NIGHT

      TREVOR hands three darts to A PATRON in exchange for his 
      license, then turns to Maggie, who s sitting at the bar.

                                  TREVOR
                    Darts.  Now there s a sharp, pointy 
                    thing with a positive purpose.  
                    Unlike your damn needles.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Needles don t poke people; people 
                    poke people.

                                  TREVOR
                    Not often enough, if you ask me.  
                    But as long as we re on the topic, 
                    how s your favorite poker... 
                    player.

                            unconvincing)
                    He s fun.  We re having a lot of 
                    fun.   It s spontaneous, you 
                    know...  Fun.

      Trevor recognizes that Maggie is attempting to justify her 
      feelings about Andrew.  His responses are supportive, but 
      knowing.

                    his favorite band is REO

      INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

      MAGGIE walks down the hall towards Andrew s door.  As she 
      gets closer, she hears something that is cause for concern.

        Intermittent SOUNDS of a VIOLIN being played, followed by...

      The SOUNDS of female laughter.

      MAGGIE pauses.  Her first impulse is to feel sorry for 
      herself.  Tears well up in her eyes.  She hears another burst 
      of violin soloing.  Her expression changes on a dime.  Anger 
      and resentment replace the sorrow.  She raps loudly on the 
      door, wipes her eyes, takes a deep breath.  The door opens...

      REVEAL - THE ATTRACTIVE BLONDE

      wearing a man s dress shirt and little else.  This can t be 
      anyone s wife.

      The woman gives Maggie a cursory once-over.

                    Andy, it s some girl.

                    When you quit loving me, why didn t 
                    you just say it was over?

                                  ANDREW
                      I haven t.  Quit loving you, I 
                    mean.  I know this looks --

                                  MAGGIE
                    It was so obvious.  When everything 
                    stopped -- the windshield...

                                  ANDREW
                    What?

                                  MAGGIE
                    And the fruit.  The chocolate.  The 
                      postcards.

      ANDREW has no idea what she s talking about, and it shows.

                                  ANDREW
                    Uh...

      As Andrew stands there, Maggie has an epiphany.

                                  MAGGIE
                    You have no idea what I m talking 
                    about, do you?

      Standing there helpless with the violin in one hand and the 
      bow in the other, Andrew scratches the back of his calf with 
      his other stocking-covered foot.

                                  MAGGIE (CONT D)
                    You re a grasshopper, Andrew.

      And those are the final words Maggie will share with Andrew.  
      She turns and moves down the hall away from him.  WE STAY on 
      Andrew watching her go, his expression melancholy.

                                  ATTRACTIVE BLONDE
                    What d she call you?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.

      INT. CHAMP & TREVOR S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      TREVOR and Champ.  Champ hangs up the phone.

                                  CHAMP
                    Lorna s coming up.

                                  TREVOR
                          (enjoying this)
                    Sugar Mama s here?  I ll clear off 
                    a spot on the couch so you two can 
                     work. 

                                  CHAMP
                    I can t believe I m saying this, 
                    but... please stay.

                                  TREVOR
                    Nope.  You re on your own, son.

      TREVOR goes to his bedroom.  There s a KNOCK at the door. 
      Champ answers. It s Lorna, carrying a bag of something.  She 
      buzzes in, kisses Champ.

                                  LORNA
                    I come bearing news.

                                  CHAMP
                    You heard from the Ford people?

                                  LORNA
                    Normally when I ve got news this 
                    good for a client, I like to treat 
                    them to a fabulous dinner at Les 
                    Deux.  But in this case, I m 
                    thinking maybe a quiet celebration 
                    here with just you and me and this 
                    bottle of Dom Perignon would be a 
                    better idea.

                                  CHAMP
                    I got the spot?

                                  LORNA
                    You did.  Congratulations.

      As Champ absorbs this great news...

                                  CHAMP
                    Let s go out.  We ll have a great 
                    dinner.  I m buying.

      LORNA s nervous -- is she moving things too quickly?


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.
      CONTINUED:


                                  LORNA
                    I was more thinking we could stay 
                    in.

                                  CHAMP
                    Oh.

                                  LORNA
                    Is that all right?

      Hard to refuse.  She pulls a second bottle of Dom out.

                                  CHAMP
                    Two bottles.  We are celebrating.

                                  LORNA
                          (blushing)
                    We don t have to drink it all 
                    tonight.

      LORNA is worried she might be pushing too hard.  And Champ 
      isn t at all sure what this relationship is based on.  He 
      makes his own decision.

                                  CHAMP
                    Mimosas for breakfast?

      They kiss.

      INT. CLAIRE S BEDROOM - MORNING

      CLAIRE wakes up.  She sees a kind of blobby group of colors 
      on the wall where her closet will be.  She turns to look at 
      the plastic-covered hole. The colors are visible on the 
      opaque plastic. She crosses to the plastic pushes it aside to 
      uncover a STAINED GLASS WINDOW.  The overall effect is 
      gorgeous.  The pattern of colors from the window picks up a 
      design Frank has carved into the wood.

      CLAIRE crosses to the door, and runs her fingers over the 
      colored light, overwhelmed by Frank s work.

      EXT. CITY STREET - MORNING

      TIM carries a thermos out of his apartment.  When he gets to 
      his car, he s surprised to discover that his windows have 
      been de-iced.  He runs his hand down the windshield almost as 
      if he believes this is a mirage that s in danger of 
      disappearing.

                                  MAGGIE (O.S.)
                          (re: the windshield)
                    Nice surprise, huh?

      TIM s head whips up.                                                                                    48.



      REVEAL - MAGGIE

      thirty feet away, across the road, an ice scraper in hand.  
      She begins walking towards him.  Tim can only manage to nod.

                                  MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                    No one s done that for me for... 
                    oh... how long ago did you quit, 
                    Tim?

                                  TIM
                            (uncomfortably)
                    Nine days ago.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Nine days.  Yeah.  Weird.  That s 
                    how long it s been since anyone s 
                    scraped my windshield.
                          (beat)
                    I always thought that Starry Night 
                    poster was Andrew s.

      TIM is speechless.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Why d you quit, Tim?

                                  TIM
                    Uh, that s complicated.  Lots of 
                    things.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Andrew said something about you 
                    being in love with someone at the 
                    hospital.

                                  TIM
                    Oh, yeah.  Well... there was that.

      MAGGIE now stands just on the other side of Tim s car.  She 
      smiles big. The cat s out of the bag.  Tim realizes there s 
      nothing to be nervous about.  For the first time in the 
      scene, he allows himself to smile.

                                  MAGGIE
                          (re: his thermos)
                    You already found a new job, huh?

                                  TIM
                    Yeah.

                                  MAGGIE
                    Whaddya say you call in sick.  Play 
                    hooky.  We could get to know each 
                    other.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.
      CONTINUED:


      TIM opens his car door, unlocks the passenger door 
        electronically.

                                  TIM
                    I may not even call in.

      TIM and Maggie share a smile as they get in the car.  The 
      camera stays outside, we just hear them.

                                  MAGGIE
                    We ll stop at a payphone.

                                  TIM
                    That d probably be best.

      As the car pulls away, the final image is of her reaching up 
      and obliterating all semblance of the razor-sharp part in 
      Tim s hair.

      INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

      TREVOR and Claire stroll.

                                  TREVOR
                    I m glad you were cleared, but I 
                    found it a little insulting that 
                    nobody thought we d ever --

      He makes vaguely suggestive motions which Claire stops.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Really?  I was mortified that 
                    anyone even felt they had to 
                      investigate.

      GLENDA hurries by them, carrying her box of belongings.

                                  GLENDA
                          (to Trevor)
                    It s a sad state of affairs when a 
                    lunatic can get someone fired.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Glenda, it was me who got you fired 
                    for stealing a confidential file.  
                    If you re going to break into 
                    people s offices, you should glue 
                    those nails on tighter.

                                  GLENDA
                    I want you to know I m going to 
                    dedicate my life to proving you two 
                    are fooling around.  Then I ll get 
                    my job back.

      TREVOR  shivers  in fear.  Glenda heads off.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.

                          (then, back on the topic)
                      I could ve gotten you fired if I d 
                    wanted.

      CLAIRE pokes Trevor.  Frechette is coming toward them.  
      Trevor smiles at CLAIRE.  Claire sees what s coming.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Trevor... don t gloat.

      Too late.  Trevor rushes up to Frechette, the very picture of 
        unhappiness.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                            (distraught)
                    Dr. Frechette!  I just got the 
                    news!  They can t do this can they?  
                    Keep us apart?  Make me go back to 
                    her?

      He points to Claire, who has decided, for once, just to enjoy 
      Trevor in full Trevor mode.

                                  FRECHETTE
                    It was always an interim 
                      arrangement. I m glad we made some 
                    progress --

      TREVOR grabs Ian s lapels.

                                  TREVOR
                    She doesn t understand me the way 
                    you do!  She makes me work and 
                    strive to get better!  With you, I 
                    just take a nap and have the nicest 
                    dreams...

                                  FRECHETTE
                    Dreams?

      TREVOR pretends to be a HYP-NO-TIZED zombie.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    I m going down the stairs!  Down, 
                    down, DOWN!  I m a baby!  I m a 
                    sperm!

      FRECHETTE realizes Trevor had him fooled.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Don t worry about it, Ian.  He s a 
                    tough nut to crack.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

                    He was in the trance.  I could 
                    tell.

                                  TREVOR
                    I m a god, Dr. Frechette.  We 
                    invented trances so you people 
                    could see us, not the other way 
                    around.

      FRECHETTE shakes his head and moves down the hallway.  Trevor 
      returns his attention to Claire.  They continue down the 
      hallway.  WE STAY on their backs -- an EXIT sign represents 
      the sunset in this scenario.

                                  TREVOR (CONT D)
                    Now, about Club Med...

                                  CLAIRE
                    The walls have ears, Trevor.

      TREVOR whispers to one of the walls.

                                  TREVOR
                    The woman is insatiable, 
                      unquenchable, a black hole of 
                    sexual desire.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You know, from time to time, I 
                    forget that you re a mental 
                    patient.  Then you do something 
                    that brings it all back into focus.

                                  TREVOR
                    Really?  Like what?

      CLAIRE looks over to regard him.  Notices he s DOING 
      SOMETHING straight out of the Ministry of Silly Walks.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Oh, stuff.

      CLAIRE pushes open the double door at the end of the hallway.  
      Trevor follows her out.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK:


                                        THE END
