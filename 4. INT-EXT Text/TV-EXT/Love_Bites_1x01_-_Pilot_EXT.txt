      Frannie, still smiling, is now looking at the ceiling of her 
      gym.  

                                    FRANNIE
                    It was the best sex I ever had.

      Frannie is doing flies with some light weights as Annie does 
      squats next to her.  Frannie is in a great mood.  Annie is 
      not.

                                  ANNIE
                    The only sex you ever had, right?  
                    Because you re a virgin? 

      Frannie sits up to talk to Annie.  

                                    FRANNIE
                    Annie... 
                          (a beat... feeling bad?)
                    I love being a virgin!  There were 
                    hours and hours of foreplay!  And 
                    he kept trying things to see what I 
                    liked.  I thought I knew what I 
                    liked, but--

                                  ANNIE
                    You stole my virginity!

      A few MEN WORKING OUT nearby turn and look at them.  Some 
      WEIGHTS DROP onto the floor.

                                    FRANNIE
                          (quietly)
                    I didn t sleep with you.

                                  ANNIE
                    You took something I care about, 
                    and used it for sex.

                                    FRANNIE
                    For great sex.   

                                  ANNIE
                    You can t build a relationship on a 
                    lie.

                                    FRANNIE
                    What relationship?  He liked me 
                    because I was virgin, and now I m 
                    not.                                                                                       11.



                                  ANNIE
                    You were never a virgin!

                                    FRANNIE
                    Once I was a virgin!  The point is, 
                    I took advantage of a typical 
                    male s shallow, egotistical desire 
                    to be a girl s first.  I used him 
                    and he used me.  The fewer 
                    illusions you have about these 
                    things, the better.

      Frannie s cell phone rings.  She picks up.

                                    FRANNIE (CONT D)
                    Hello?...  Oh.  Hi, Jordan... 

      She looks at Annie, amazed he called.

                                    FRANNIE (CONT D)
                    No, I feel fine about it...  I 
                    didn t regret it at all.  Did 
                    you?...  It was really special...  
                    No, better than I expected...  I 
                    promise I m not freaking out... 
                          (then)
                    Yeah, I could do dinner tonight.  
                    I ll call you later and we ll make 
                    a plan...  Bye.

      She hangs up.  She looks sick.

                                  ANNIE
                    He seems so nice.

                                    FRANNIE
                    He is so nice.
                          (depressed)
                    And he s good in bed.  And cute and 
                    smart and funny and successful...  
                    Annie, what have I done?

                                  ANNIE
                    Screwed up our chances with the 
                    last good guy in Virginia.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Our chances?

                                  ANNIE
                    He was flirting with me before you 
                    stole my virginity!                                                                                      12.



                                    FRANNIE
                    Could you please stop saying that?
                          (a beat, getting excited)
                    What should I wear tonight?

                                  ANNIE
                    You have to tell him, you know.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Yeah.  Of course...  Do I?  I mean, 
                    he should have been my first.  And 
                    if he was my first, how romantic!  
                    And what a great story for our 
                    kids!

                                  ANNIE
                    Um, there are a few men who could 
                    refute that story. 
                          (a beat)
                    At this gym.

      Frannie laughs a little at this, then glances around, worried 
      it s true.

                                  ANNIE (CONT D)
                    And who knows?  Maybe he ll think 
                    it s funny.


      Jordan, not at all amused, stares at Frannie, who is wearing 
      her cutest  please forgive me  dress.  They are at a romantic 
      outdoor table, mid-way through dinner. 

                                  JORDAN
                    You lied about being a virgin?!

                                    FRANNIE
                          (weakly)
                    But I m telling the truth now.

                                  JORDAN
                    Wow.  What else did you lie about, 
                    Fran?  If that s even your name.

                                    FRANNIE
                          (considers how to answer)
                    That s another funny story.  It s 
                    almost my name.  See, Annie didn t 
                    want to--

      He gets up and leaves.                                                                                    13.



                                    FRANNIE (CONT D)
                    Jordan?

      A WOMAN SELLING ROSES approaches Frannie.

                                  WOMAN SELLING ROSES
                    Rose for the pretty lady?

                                    FRANNIE
                    No, thank you.


      PAN PAST SOME ANGRY MEN sitting at the bar yelling at a 
      televised New York Rangers hockey game.

                                    RANGERS FAN
                    You suck, Perling!

      Annie is doing the same.

                                  ANNIE
                    C mon, Perling, get it together!

      Frannie, depressed, is eating cheese fries.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Honesty is so overrated.

                                  ANNIE
                    No, it s not.  You should always be 
                    honest.  That s why I prefer to 
                    tell the truth right up front. 

                                    FRANNIE
                    Uh huh.  Is that why you come here 
                    and pretend to care about hockey 
                    when clearly you re here for the 
                    favorable man to woman ratio?

                                  ANNIE
                    It s not that.  
                            (whispering)
                    It s the bartender.  

      She nods discretely in the direction of the CUTE BARTENDER, 
      who is laughing with one of the HOT WAITRESSES.

                                  ANNIE (CONT D)
                    I find him so dreamy, but he flirts 
                    with every waitress here.  How can 
                    I compete with Double D s, heels 
                    and hot pants?                                                                                    14.



      Frannie knows how, and she feels like she owes Annie one.  

                                    FRANNIE
                          (to the bartender)
                    Hey, hi.  Can I get a Diet Coke for 
                    my friend here.  
                          (proud)
                    She s a virgin, by the way.

      The bartender laughs hard, as do a few of the Rangers fans 
      who overheard.  Annie is insulted and confused.

                                  CUTE BARTENDER
                    Is that a great story or what?

      The men laugh some more.  Finally Annie asks:

                                  ANNIE
                    What story?

                                    RANGERS FAN
                    The Last Virgin in Virginia!

      Annie and Frannie aren t sure how to react.

                                  CUTE BARTENDER
                          (to Annie)
                    You didn t hear this?  The guy who 
                    called into the John & Nikki show 
                    this morning?  He met some girl who 
                    tells men she s a virgin so the sex 
                    will be better!

      He smiles at Frannie, thinking she s in on the joke.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Ha.  Ha ha.

                                    RANGERS FAN
                    So now everybody s a virgin!

      The guys laugh.  Annie and Frannie laugh along weakly, then:

                                  ANNIE
                    Except... I m really a virgin.

                                  CUTE BARTENDER
                    Yeah, right!

      Two of the HOT WAITRESSES chime in:

                                  HOT WAITRESS #1
                    Me, too!                                                                                    15.



                                  HOT WAITRESS #2
                    Me, too!

      As everyone else laughs, and men chat with the waitresses...

                                    FRANNIE
                    It s not like it was a policy.  It 
                    was a one-time thing.

                                  ANNIE
                    Losing your virginity is a one-time 
                    thing!  Don t talk to me about one-
                    time things!

                                    FRANNIE
                          (trying to convince 
                            herself as much as Annie)
                    This will all blow over.  It was on 
                    local radio, not national 
                      television.  

      The bartender hands Annie her Diet Coke.  

                                  CUTE BARTENDER
                    Here you go, virgin.

      He and the guys crack up again.  Annie looks at Frannie.

                                    FRANNIE
                    You know what?  Maybe this is good.  

                                  ANNIE
                    How is this good?!

                                    FRANNIE
                    Well, if everyone is a virgin, 
                    maybe slut is the new virgin.

                                  ANNIE
                    So it s good for you.

                                    FRANNIE
                    Well, yeah. 

      As Annie worries whether this relationship with Frannie is 
      going to work out, the bartender drops a cherry in her soda.

                                  CUTE BARTENDER
                    Forgot the cherry.

      He smiles at Annie with his dreamy smile, then walks off.                                                                                      16.



                                  ANNIE
                    Is he... flirting with me?

                                    FRANNIE
                    You re welcome.

                                  ANNIE
                    So what now?  I have to pretend I m 
                    not a virgin?

                                    FRANNIE
                    Just until he gets to know you 
                    better.

      As Annie considers this and our THEME MUSIC comes up...


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    17.


                                        ACT TWO

      As our THEME MUSIC plays, we again see the three tattoos 
      which represent tonight s three stories: the CHERRY with the 
      words  first time,  the BRIEFCASE with the words  first to 
      go,  and the STAR with the words  first on the list ... 

      The briefcase tattoo that says  first to go  fills the frame 
      and becomes...


      Carter, carrying his briefcase, pauses outside of his 
      apartment for a moment, dreading having to tell his fiancee 
      his news.  Then he hears the faint sound of MOANING.  Someone 
      somewhere is having sex...


      Carter and Kell are having a beer at a New York pub.

                                  CARTER
                    So I ve been replaced by a machine 
                    at work and in bed.

                                  KELL
                    At least it wasn t a guy.

                                  CARTER
                    A guy I could compete with.  How am 
                      I supposed to compete with  the 
                    Cadillac of vibrators?  

                                  KELL
                    You don t require batteries.

                                  CARTER
                    It s not battery operated.  It 
                    plugs in.

                                  KELL
                    Jesus.

                                  CARTER
                    Exactly.  It never gets tired.  It 
                    can go forever.

                                  KELL
                    You ve got trouble, man.

                                  CARTER
                    That s what I m saying!

                                  KELL
                    It s not that damn bunny, is it?  
                    My ex-wife had one of those, and I 
                    still say it s why she didn t cry 
                    when she left me. 

                                  CARTER
                    No, that I might have recognized.  
                    This just looks like a back 
                    massager.  That s the insidious 
                    part.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    26.

                                  CARTER (CONT'D)
                    It could be lying around, you might 
                    not even notice it, then boom!  She 
                    tells you it s better in bed than 
                    you are.

      A moment as they sip their beers and contemplate their very 
      tenuous position in the world.

                                  KELL
                    I blame her friends.  That s a gift 
                    for a woman who s getting dumped, 
                    not a woman who s getting married.

                                  CARTER
                    Says who?  Emily Post... coital?  

                                  KELL
                    Liz has you whenever she wants.  
                    She doesn t need... a device.  That 
                    should be the first thing to go 
                    when two people move in together, 
                    just like your porn has to go.

                                  CARTER
                    It does?

                                  KELL
                    Yes.  Then when you get divorced, 
                    you ve got no woman and no porn.  
                    And now... no job! 

      Kell raises his glass, then takes a long swig.   

                                  CARTER
                    At least now we can drink during 
                    the day.

                                  KELL
                    Yeah.  There s that.  

                                  CARTER
                    The thing is, I can t forbid her to 
                    use it.  I mean, I still plan to...

                                  KELL
                    ...Pat the Buchanan?

                                  CARTER
                    Yeah.  Right?  When you were 
                    married, you still--

                                  KELL
                    Sure.  More than ever -- which was 
                    maybe a bad sign.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    27.

                                  KELL (CONT'D)
                    And it could be challenging, 
                    knowing someone was just outside 
                    the door, waiting to use the blow 
                    dryer, or to fight about something.  
                    So sometimes I did it at work. 

                                  CARTER
                    That s why you logged so many 
                    hours!  Not in our office, I hope-- 

                                  KELL
                    No!  In the john.

                                  CARTER
                    So when I was on my cell yesterday--

                                  KELL
                    I only did it at work when I was 
                    married.  Now I can do it at home.  

                                  CARTER
                    Now you can do it all day.

                                  KELL
                    Another perk of unemployment.

      They both raise a glass to that, then...

                                  CARTER
                    I don t want her to leave me.

                                  KELL
                    She s not going to leave you. 

                                  CARTER
                    But I don t even have a job.

                                  KELL
                    I don t even have someone to lose 
                    over losing my job, so consider 
                    yourself lucky.

                                  CARTER
                    I do.  I am lucky.  
                            (determined)
                    In fact, you know what?  My job, 
                    while I don t have a job... is to 
                    become as good in bed as the 
                    Cadillac of vibrators.

                                  KELL
                    How are you gonna do that?                                                                                    28.



                                  CARTER
                    Business 101:  Know your 
                      competition.


      The BED IS SHAKING, and so is Liz.  She looks at the clock.  
      It s 8:15am.  

                                  LIZ
                    Honey...  Honey...

      Carter emerges from under the covers, looking like he just 
      ran a marathon.  He can barely move.

                                  CARTER
                    Yeah?

                                  LIZ
                      Everything you re doing feels 
                    amazing, and I am so close... 
                            (apologetic)
                    ...but I have to get to work.

                                  CARTER
                    But you didn t--

                                  LIZ
                    That s okay.

                                  CARTER
                    No, it s not.  What can I do? 

                                  LIZ
                    Well... want to take out the Caddy 
                    and drive this home?                                                                                    30.



      She smiles, but for Carter, that was a stake in the heart.

                                  CARTER
                    So I m what?  The fluffer?  

                                  LIZ
                          (lovingly)
                    It s not a competition.  I love 
                    you.  I m marrying you.  And sex... 
                    sex is whatever works. 
                          (looks at the clock, torn)
                    Shit.  I really have to get to the 
                    office.  

      She kisses him on the forehead and gets up.

                                  CARTER
                    Yeah.   
                          (covering)
                    Me, too.  


      From outside the apartment, we hear PORN MUSIC, the BUZZING 
      of the Caddy, the MOANING of porn actors... all mixing with 
      the moaning of Liz and Carter, and culminating in a giant...


      ...a STAR TATTOO on the shoulder of COLLEEN ROUSCH, 30ish, 
      hip, cool, about to drop off her husband, JUDD ROUSCH, 32, a 
      slightly chubby Venice Beach tattoo artist, and his good 
      friend, BOWMAN, single and used to being their third wheel. 

      They are moving slowly in AIRPORT TRAFFIC, trying to get to 
      the airline s passenger drop-off point.   

                                    COLLEEN
                    So, Judd, about this bachelor 
                    party...  Do we need to establish 
                    some ground rules?

                                  JUDD
                    I told you, it s a lame fishing 
                    trip.

                                    COLLEEN
                    I thought maybe that was code for 
                    drunken debauchery with strippers 
                    shooting strawberries out of their 
                    hoo-hahs.

                                  JUDD
                    No, sadly, it s code for lame 
                    fishing trip.  

                                  BOWMAN
                    Since when do we fly cross-country 
                    for a G-rated bachelor party?

                                  JUDD
                    Since the groom lost his job and *
                    needs some cheering up. *

                                    BOWMAN*
                    I bet strippers would cheer him up.*

                                  JUDD
                      Apparently Liz told Carter if he *
                    had strippers, the wedding was off.                                                                                    35.



                                  BOWMAN
                    See?  That?  There?  
                          (to Judd)
                    That s why you re giving me a 
                     better dead than wed  tattoo, 
                    right here on my ring finger.

                                    COLLEEN
                    Hell, yeah!  Then you can see 
                    strippers shooting strawberries out 
                    of their hoo-hahs anytime you like.

                                  BOWMAN
                    What s with you and the 
                      strawberries, Colleen?

                                    COLLEEN
                    It s just... the kind of thing I ve 
                    heard happens.

                                  BOWMAN
                          (pretends it s ridiculous, 
                            then to Judd:)
                    Why would you tell her that?

                                  JUDD
                    I found it disturbing.  I needed to 
                    share. 
                          (suddenly)
                    Ohmygod!  Stop!

                                    COLLEEN
                          (stepping on the brakes)
                    What? 

                                  JUDD
                    Pull over!   

                                    COLLEEN
                    This is first class only.

                                  JUDD
                    Look.  Who s.  Here.

      They follow his gaze.  Up ahead, getting her bags from the 
      DRIVER of a black town car is ALYSSA MILANO.

                                    COLLEEN
                    Hey, it s your girlfriend!

                                  BOWMAN
                    Who are we looking at?  I m lost.                                                                                    36.



                                  JUDD
                    Alyssa Milano!

                    And... my Celebrity Exemption List.

                                  BOWMAN
                    Is that a reality show?  I m lost 
                    again.

                                    COLLEEN
                    It s a married thing.  You know, 
                    the list of five or so famous 
                    people you get to sleep with if you 
                    ever get the chance? 

                                  JUDD
                    And it doesn t count as cheating.  
                    It s exempt.  
                          (to Colleen)
                    It s exempt!

                                    COLLEEN
                          (completely supportive)
                    I know, honey.

                                  JUDD
                    So pull over already!

                                    COLLEEN
                    I m just waiting for this guy to 
                    pull out.

      Judd looks impatiently at the car in their way.

                                  BOWMAN
                          (to Colleen)
                    Who s on your list?

                                    COLLEEN
                    Well, first, of course: Johnny 
                    Depp.  Then Javier Bardem, Denzel--

                                  JUDD
                          (to Bowman and Colleen)
                    I should go talk to her, right?  
                    But I can t just...  I mean...  
                    What...  How...  What do I say?                                                                                    37.



                                  BOWMAN
                    How about  goodbye ?  
                          (pointing)
                    She just went inside.

                                  JUDD
                          (turning to look)
                    What?  No!  Should I follow her?!

                                    COLLEEN
                    Yes!  Run after her!  Go!  GO!!!

      Judd just looks at Colleen.

                                  JUDD
                    You don t think I can make it 
                    happen, do you?

                                    COLLEEN
                    Not really.  No. 

                                  JUDD
                    Me neither.  Shit. 

                                    COLLEEN
                    But you could talk to her at least.  
                    Tell her what a big fan you are.

                                  JUDD
                    It s not the celebrity conversation 
                    list.  It s the celebrity exemption 
                    list.

                                    COLLEEN
                    Hey, I was game.  

                                  JUDD
                    I know.  I appreciate that.

      As Colleen pats Judd on the shoulder, consoling him...
