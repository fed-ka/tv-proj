CLOSE ON A WOODEN STICK-FIGURE TOY, held by a SIX YEAR OLD BOY.
Another BOY grabs the toy away and RUNS OFF, laughing --
CHILDREN are playing under a cluster of date palms, part of a
small desert commune somewhere in the Middle East. Their
MOTHERS, veiled in black, gather and talk. Bearded, turbaned
MEN carrying AK-47's argue politics. A domestic, even tranquil
scene of life in another part of the world...
A CARAVAN of VEHICLES RACE DOWN A HIGHWAY:. SUV's mounted with
surface-to-air RPG's form a protective cordon around a BLACK
MERCEDES. As the cars ROAR INTO LENS, we go.to:
POV THOUGH A LONG-RANGE SCOPE: the caravan as seen by a TWO-MAN
SPECIAL OPS TEAM perched on a ridge. As the LEADER surveils the
cars, his partner finishes assembling a two-foot UAV (Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle), rigging it with EXPLOSIVES:
SPECIAL FORCES LEADER
We have visual onthetarget. Confirm
'go' for UAV launch.
The Ops Team activates a remote transmitter, LAUNCHING the UAV
into the sky like a small ROCKET -- amazingly, its silent.
DRONE POV: tracking the caravan, singling out the MERCEDES. The
drone emits a THIN LASER BEAM that hits its rear windshield --
Mothers grab up their children and pull them aside as the
vehicles arrive. ARMED MEN emerge...
INTERCUTTING - THE PENTAGON OPS ROOM: the computer pinpoints
DOTS on the satellite feed that represent WEAPONRY on-site --
TECHIE
We've got AK-47's, RPC's, Chaparral
guided missiles --
COLONEL THOMPSON
Looks like a training camp.
THE DESERT: Bodyguards cluster around a TURBANED:MAN as he
emerges from the Mercedes. It looks a lot like the man from the
file photo, but the beard makes it hard to confirm.
MID-AIR WITH THE UAV: It SWOOPS, targeting the man -- SNAP:
THE PENTAGON: a BLURRY SNAPSHOT of his FACE appears. A DIGITAL
WIRE-FRAME is overlaid on the man's face: "5I$ PROBABLE MATCH -
INSUFFICIENT DATA. RECOMMENDATION: ABORT MISSION."
TECHIE
51%. 'Abort' rec holds.
THE DESERT: Now our guy DISAPPEARS into the crowd as they begin
MOVING toward a large WOODEN PLANK on the desert floor. Some of
the men take hold of the plank, drag it back to reveal... a PIT.
THE PENTAGON: SAME IMAGE in real-time on the feeds:
CALLISTER
What is that, a weapons cache?
ANALYST
Sir, the placement of stones around the
pit, markers for the Five Pillars of
Islam... I think it's a funeral.
Everyone trades looks -- this just got even more complicated.
THE DESERT: from the back of a TENTED TRUCK, a BODY is lifted,
shrouded in white. The men carry it through blowing sand... the
procession stopping at the pit. They begin lowering the body...
THE PENTAGON: on monitors, a section of the GENEVA CONVENTION
SCROLLS:
TECHIE
Sir, striking a funeral would put us in
violation of the Geneva convention.
3/28/07 4.
CONTINUED:
COLONEL THOMPSON
Once this guy's gone, he's gone.
The PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL pipes in --
PENTAGON GENERAL COUNCIL
"Hors de Combat" -- legally we'd be open
to international prosecution. But we
have no independent intel verifying it's
in fact a funeral, and the presence of
weapons certainly leaves room for
interpretation.
TECHIE #2
I have POTUS calling from Air Force One.
CALLISTER
(a beat, looks around).
Everyone agree this is the best course of
action?
No one dissents. Callister picks up:
CALLISTER (CONT'D)
Mr. President, we have.a.51% identity
match on Majid Al-Khoei. There is some
possibility he's at a funeral, but we
don't know. Regardless, counsel thinks
we can claim 'Overriding Legal
Authority.' Also, you should be aware we
have an abort recommendation, but your
cabinet, the Speaker, the Joint Chiefs
urge a 'go.'
THE PRESIDENT (V.0.)
You left yourself out of the lineup.
Callister pauses. AS THE MESSAGE ON THE MONITOR STARTS
BLINKING: "ABORT, ABORT, ABORT..."
CALLISTER
Yessir... we gauge our strategy by two
standards: the highest probability of
success with the least amount of
collateral damage. At 51% probability,
we don't have either one.
GENERAL THOMPSON
And if it is Al-Khoei and he walks, Sir,
we're putting our people at risk.
There's a long silence as the President considers.
3/28/07 5.
CONTINUED: ( 2)
THE PRESIDENT (V.0.)
I respect your caution, Geoff, but we
won't get another chance like this... you
have a green light.
Callister's obviously opposed, but he bites his tongue:
CALLISTER
Understood.
(hangs up)
We're weapons free.
And with deadly calm, Techies execute orders into-headsets:
TECHIE TECHIE 2
-- Switching to Tac-2, -- MTS active, painting the
acquisition's good -- target --
The women begin to SING the "Nasheen," a.funeral song praising
Allah. The beautiful VOICES grow until all other sound is GONE.
DRONE POV: the feed from the CAMERA INSIDE THE NOSE-CONE as it
LAUNCHES its missile -- it ZOOMS toward the funeral gathering --
The haunting, beautiful voices WAIL... in the moment before
impact, we see: birds flying across the great plain... a herd of
running gazelles... the DESERT WIND blankets a layer of sand
over the shrouded body in the pit... a CHILD'S HAND grasping his
mother's...
A WHITE FLASH AS THE MISSILE HITS:
HOLD IN WHITE:
CREDIT SE UENCE: WORDS CLOSE UP... a digitized electronic scan,
as if they're being analyzed by someone: "We the people of the
United States... more perfect union..." Highlights of The
Constitution, The. Declaration of Independence...
We land on: "...whenever any form of government becomes
destructive...it is the right of the people to alter it or to
abolish it..." CLOSE IN on these last words: "ABOLISH IT."
WHITEWASH:
An ATM CARD gets slid into the slot. Jerry looks up. THE ATM
CAMERA IS STARING RIGHT AT HIM. Then, a BEEP gets his
attention: "INSUFFICIENT FUNDS." He processes this a moment...
his exhale doesn't just say, "FUCK," it says "FUCK 1 KNEW IT."
MOURNERS are gathering in their somber best, shaking hands.
Across the street, we find Jerry, getting out of a taxi.
Standing in a rumpled suit. Grim; the last thing he wants to do
is enter that church. It's almost as if he can't. Finally,
from somewhere, strength. He walks forward.
3/28/07 11.
Rachel and Kyle HAUL ASS toward the bus stop, both struggling
with Kyle's carry-on, a.garment bag, her purse, and a trumpet
case marked with STICKERS (Green Bay Packers among them)--
RACHEL
I put vitamins in your toiletry bag,
don't forget to take two in the morning --
KYLE
and one at night, I know --
RACHEL
And your inhaler, which I may need to use
now, is in the outside pocket -- wait!
They rush back to a MAILBOX, she pulls bills from her purse:
KYLE
More bills?
RACHEL
Yup -- that's what happens when you have
a kid on lay-away.
They smile at each other. When SUDDENLY a BUS ROARS PAST the
WIND GUSTS and the bills go FLYING into traffic:
3/28/07 13
CONTINUED:
RACHEL (CONT'D)
OH, SHIT! STAY HERE!
Rachel waves her arms at oncoming cars, runs INTO TRAFFIC--
KYLE
YOU SWORE!!
As she chases the bills, SCREECHING and HONKING around her:
RACHEL
I KNOW, I'M SORRY!
(Porsche HONKS as it
PASSES)
HEY, A LITTLE COMMON COURTESY, ASSHOLE!
And she runs back to Kyle, THROWS the bills in the mailbox --
KYLE
You swore again. Was that our bus?
Rachel looks: PAN to across the street, the bus is now LEAVING
THE BUS STOP. PAN back to Rachel: SHIT!!
RACHEL:
Okay, now were gonna.be late.
She puts fingers in her mouth and WHISTLES HARD for a cab --
CLOSE ON THE PIN NUMBER AGAIN, getting PUNCHED IN. Then FIND
JERRY, exhausted from the funeral, slipping the money his father
gave him into a deposit envelope. A glance at the SECURITY
CAMERA. Then a BEEP makes him look at the screen.
3/28/07 17
CONTINUED:
AND WE PUNCH IN TIGHTER ON JERRY, WHO STARES, STUNNED. The
screen reads: "BALANCE: $750,000.00"
What the HELL? Glances back to the people behind him, they want
him to hurry. He hits "Cancel." But the machine, as if
disobeying, spits out five $100 bills--
JERRY
-- whoa --
Jerry stabs cancel again. Now TEN MORE $100 bills-come out. He
glances at the people in line, nervous--
JERRY (CONT'D)
-- two seconds, sorry --
Eyes flick back to the ATM CAMERA. He covers it with his hand,
pushes "cancel" again and again. But now.. TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS
IN $100 BILLS HAS COME OUT, getting JAMMED' in the slot. People
start to PEER OVER as Jerry SCRAMBLES to keep the cash from
flying everywhere. And finally. The machine stops. He stuffs
all the money in his pocket. Everyone's staring.
JERRY (CONT'D)
Big date. So... fingers crossed.
Jerry prepares himself, then JUMPS TO A DRAIN PIPE -- grabbing
it and lowering himself from the third floor -- dropping the
last ten feet, landing HARD, recovering, running off --
A SUBWAY TRAIN pulls into the station. WHIP PAN to find Jerry
running onto the platform -- out-of-his-mind-scared -- passes a
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA looking down, as if watching him --
Jerry's eyes scan the area... then he FREEZES. THE ELECTRONIC
SCHEDULE SIGN HAS CHANGED TO READ: "JERRY, BOARD TEE TRAIN"
THEN JUST AS FAST, ITS BACK TO THE SCHEDULE.
HOW IS THIS HAPPENING?! Across the station, Jerry sees Morgan
and a team of Agents pouring down the stairs =- he runs onto the
train as the DOORS CLOSE -- Morgan turns, doesn't see him.
JUMPS off the train, pushes through the busy platform. Spots
TWO TRANSIT OFFICERS talking on radios as they scan the crowd.
Jerry turns and ducks into another TRAIN just as --
3/28/07 29.
The rear subway car's now become the front. TILT DOWN to the
track, it SWITCHES OVER to another line all.by itself --
Out of the station! Spots the BLACK 760 BMW SEDAN parked by the
curb -- sleek, ultra-fast. Jerry tears open the passenger door,
jumps inside, meeting, behind the wheel:
Jerry, dazed but driven, SLAMS a piece of plywood again and
again into the LEXAN WINDOW of the barge's CONTROL BOOTH.
Rachel paces, on her cell -- hearing:
KYLE'S VOICE
This is Kyle. Who is not allowed to. use
this phone with my friends... so leave a
message, Mom. (BEEP --}
RACHEL
Honey? Honey? It's me -- Baby, you need
to call me. Soon as you get this, 1 please
-- check your messages and.call me.
Sweetie. I love y_ou.
And she hangs up, staring'off. CRASH! Jerry's knocked the
window back -- opens the control booth door and enters, examines
the controls. The computer panel reads: "CONTROL OVERRIDE."
JERRY
-- this thing's on auto-pilot or
something. Which doesn't happen, these
barges are operated, by people.
He steps out. In thought, tears in her eyes, Rachel asks:
RACHEL
D'youthink -- she could derail a train?
JERRY
Are you kidding me? She changed every
traffic light! This woman's called me on
other people's phones -- some dude who
happened to be sitting next to me! His
phone rang -- it was her! For me! She
broke me out of maximum-security custod
in a way I'm not even gonna tell you
cause you won't believe it -- and you
saw how she directed us away from the
police, then lifted us outta the world
and dropped our ass onto the ghost barge!
Can she derail a train? She could
probably turn a train into a duck. Yes.
I think she c--
3/28/07 36.
CONTINUED:
-- but now he stops, because Rachel is crying. Jerry lamely
attempts to backpedal:
JERRY (CONT'D)
I mean... I don't know, I'm not sure she
could derail a train, what the hell do I
know?
Rachel brushes her tears away. Afraid, but fighting it.
RACHEL
My son is on a train. She threatened to
kill him if I don't do what she says.
They share a look. The difference between them galvanized in an
instant. She has something to lose.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
You tell me -- how does someone do all
this?
When: RING! A CELL PHONE. Rachel looks down, hoping it's Kyle
-- but it's not her phone. They realize the phone's somewhere
in the trash. Jerry starts digging. It's nast Finally, he
finds it in an old take-out box --- re: the phone.
JERRY
-- you see what I mean?
He wipes it off, holds it to his ear despite the stench;
JERRY (CONT'D)
Hello?
WOMAN'S VOICE
You both need to swim to shore. Go to
line tower 108.
"JERRY RACHEL
"Swim to shore? Are you -- she wants us to swim --?!
insane?
JERRY
Lady, what if I told you we don't know
how to swim.
WOMAN'S VOICE
But you do. I've seen you at the beach
house.
(Jerry is chilled)
And the female was once a swimming
instructor at the YMCA in Westport,
Connecticut. Go now or the authorities
will find you. They're more dangerous
than the water.
3/28/07 37.
CONTINUED: (2)
CLICK -- she's gone. Jerry hangs up, turning something
unnerving in his mind.
JERRY
She called you "the female."
(beat, weird)
That's like... something a foreigner would
say, like a bad translation. But she has
no accent.
RACHEL
Jerry, that's your name, right? Are we
swimmincr?
JERRY
Does it bring back memories of
Westport Y?
RACHEL
(pale, at a whisper)
how did you know that?
JERRY
I didn't.
And they turn to look down at the FREEZING RIVER WATER as we PRE-
LAP the SOUND of a clear F SHARP and CUT TO --
An endless stretch of road lined with electrical line towers...
Two FIGURES, like specks against the landscape -- Jerry and
Rachel, walking, wet, cold. And then:
RACHEL
So you're a twin.
(BEAT)
Who works at a copy place.
And she manages a clipped, judgemental (frankly rude) laugh.
JERRY
Yeah, I know... that's occurred to me.
3/28/07 40.
CONTINUED:
RACHEL
So this whole situation is obviously
about him.
JERRY
Excuse me? I would offer this whole
situation isn't "obviously" about
anything.
RACHEL
Just think about it: you said your
brother worked at the State Department --
JERRY
-- so what?
RACHEL
-- so that means he could've: been into
anythinc -- he was a twin -:- you..received
a shipment of weapons and cash and
airplane manuals -- it seems to me that
they sent the stuff to.the wrong brother--
JERRY
Wait a minute -- you're suggesting all
that stuff was for Paul?
As they approach TOWER 108:
RAC HE L
Hey, I'm sorry that he died, I'm not
trying to insult his memory --
JERRY
he hasn't been dead long enough to
become a memory! And if you knew Paul,
which you did not, you'd laugh all day at
the idea that he was a spy or terrorist
or whatever you're implying --
RACHEL
I'm implying if not him... then why you?
JERRY
Well hasn't that been the question my
whole life. You know how I know Paul
wasn't a terrorist? Because if he had
been, he would've been the best fucking
terrorist in history: he wouldn't have
gotten caught, the United States would be
a crater -- he would've won awards for
being a great terrorist.
(THEN)
What about you? Why'd she choose you --
what's your day job? I know it isn't
"manual-shift driver."
3/28/07 41.
CONTINUED: (2)
RACHEL
I did just fine driving, thanks. I'm a
paralegal -- I have no connection to
anything.
JERRY
Really?
Suddenly they're interrupted by the ROOSTERTAIL OF DUST
approaching in the distance. Rachel stops dead and on INSTINCT,
grabs Jerry's hand, all their mutual hostility vanished:
RACHEL
Someone's coming.
And what's approaching is the "Hassad DryCleaners." van. It
comes to a stop and out steps the Middle Eastern Man. Stands
some twenty-five feet from them.
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
Are you Jerry Shaw?
JERRY
who are you?
Rachel grabs Jerry's arm as the man reaches into his jacket --
JERRY (CONT'D) MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
-- Whoa -- I dropped it off like she
said. I'm done.
The man's pulled out an unusual-looking STEEL KEY.
JERRY (CONT'D)
-- dropped off what? Who are you?
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
Take it --
He TOSSES the key..-- it lands, LARGE IN FRAME, somewhere between
them. Then:
JERRY
what's it for?
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
I don't know -- I don't care -- but I
will not drive you. You take the van
(touches his EAR: beat)
I'm not listening to you any more!
And the man turns to go, just walks away.
RACHEL JERRY
-- hey! -- wait, who are you?! You
have to tell us what you know!
3/28/07 42
CONTINUED: (3)
And as the man walks away from them his CELL PHONE RINGS: He
pulls it out -- the LCD READS: "LAST CHANCE." And the man
DROPS the phone and just starts RUNNING --
JERRY
WAIT!!
And Jerry takes off after him, he's not letting him go. Catches
up to the guy and grabs him. Spinning him round --
JERRY (CONT'D)
What do you know?
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
-- let me go!
JERRY
-- who's doing this?
And they begin to struggle. Middle Eastern Man's dropped CELL
PHONE RINGS. Rachel. Terrified, hesitant. Knows somehow its
for her -- she answers:
WOMAN'S VOICE
Stop him now or he will die.
RACHEL
(looking around)
How are you seeing us?!
Jerry and the Middle Eastern Man. Fighting. Thrashing.
Throwing sloppy punches:
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
Let go of me!
On Rachel:
WOMAN'S VOICE
Stop him now.
CLICK. Rachel turning to SCREAM at Middle Eastern Man --
RACHEL
Stop! You have to STOP!
When the Middle Eastern Man CRACKS Jerry in the nose and he goes
sprawling. He takes off again, yelling back:
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
I cannot! I have a family!!!
RACHEL
She's going to KILL YOU!
3/28/07 43.
CONTINUED: (4)
And just then, something TERRIFYING: an IMMENSE POWER SURGE --
HEARD, FELT -- and a SIX-STORY-HIGH COIL THE SIZE OF AN SUV
EXPLODES IN SPARKS. CABLES BLAST FREE. Rachel SCREAMS. Jerry
TACKLES HER TO SAFETY as the tree trunk cables SWING DOWN AND
STRIKE THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN and he is SLAMMED OFF HIS FEET,
the current making the cable STICK TO HIM LIKE GLUE.
And he's ON FIRE INSTANTLY -- SMOKE EVERYWHERE as he's TOSSED BY
THE HORRIFYING TENTACLE, POUNDED INTO THE GROUND, BACK INTO THE
AIR, PUMMELLED DOWN AGAIN, BURNING...
Jerry and Rachel watch this in horror -- until she looks away.
Jerry holding her -- the two in shock, strangers, in each -
other's arms. Having shared another moment, too real, horror -
RACHEL (CONT'D) JERRY.
Oh my God... Oh God... oh We--we have to do something,
God... Oh God... we have to... figure out what
to.. what...
And then his PHONE RINGS. And they're both too afraid to answer
it. Another RING. And another. Finally Jerry answers it, hand
shaking slightly:
JERRY
You killed him... you killed that man...
WOMAN'S VOICE
It was unavoidable. Take the van. Drive
to Indianapolis. 7002 West 56th Street.
Arrive no later than eleven AM. Disobey
and you die.
CLICK. Rachel's eyes on Jerry.
JERRY RACHEL
she wants us to drive to
Indianapolis.: , -- why? What's there, what? --
-- I don't know -- -- no, this can't keep
happening! We have to go to
the police, explain it --
explain what?! What're we -- I'm not doing it!! I'm not
gonna tell them?! going anywhere!
Jerry can see she's losing it. Grabs her by the shoulders:
JERRY
-- Rachel. She's watching us. Right
now. You wanna die too? Your son? We
have to go.
Rachel looks right at him, still shaking, knows he's right. And
nods. Okay. Okay. As our MUSIC BUILDS, LARGER THAN YOU MIGHT
THINK -- AND AT THE HEIGHT OF AN UNRESOLVED CHORD, IT --
3/28/07 44.
-- STOPS.
Just the eerie, faint whistle of wind. We PAN a barren
landscape. Scattered scorch marks. Then, a high-pitched TONE
as the PAN continues and arrives at a parked military truck,
which gives us scale to understand the SUDDEN COLOSSAL EXPLOSION
THAT SHAKES OUR BEING -- HOLY FUCK THAT THING WAS HUGE AND AS
DEBRIS IS STILL RIPPED INTO THE SKY, PIECES ARE COMING DOWN AND
THERE WILL BE SMOKE FOR HOURS as a SUPER APPEARS:
"BRIAR POINT TEST RANGE -- ABERDEEN, MARYLAND. "-
And we hear CLAPPING -- PULL BACK, realizing that we are inside:
A chopper ROARS over skyscrapers. Morgan beside the PILOT in
front, listening to Latesha over his helmet headset.
LATESHA (V.0.)
-- he was Defense.
3/28/07 46.
CONTINUED:
MORGAN
You're kidding me. What capacity?
LATESHA (V.0.)
Black-file: classified B-36.
MORGAN
B what?
THE CHARRED FACE OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN, FROZEN IN A SCREAM.
Morgan runs towards it, the SHERIFF and a POWER WORKER trying to
keep up. Chopper in B.G. Police officers work the scene.
POWER WORKER
Never seen anything like it. Power blew
out from Franklin High School down to the
river club. I can't explain it -
They arrive at the body. Contorted, blackened, teeth bared.
SHERIFF
No I.D. We know he's male, though.
Probably in his 20's.
(points off)
Tire treads entering and leaving the
scene over three. Three sets of shoe
prints.
MORGAN
And we're about 4 miles from the river --
Just then we see Agent Grant running towards them, stumbling on
some rocks. Just finishing-.up a cell call:
AGENT GRANT
Agent Morgan!"
(out of breath, sotto)
Just got off with HQ. The fake fax from
Justice that got Shaw his phone call?
Came from inside Justice.
MORGAN
Inside?! You absolutely sure on that?
AGENT GRANT
Yes, s--
(catches himself)
Yes I am.
MEDICAL EXAMINER
Got something --
As the M.E. pulls something out of Middle Eastern Man's ear: a
small, charred GIZMO. Small WIRE sticking out. Lifts it up for
them to see. Morgan takes the TWEEZERS --
GRANT
Looks like a bone mic, military grade.
3/28/07 52.
CONTINUED:
MORGAN
Can't even get these things on the black
market.
(looks around landscape)
Someone was talking to him.
Something's rotten in Denmark. No, something's rotten
everywhere. Morgan turns abruptly and starts back for the
chopper. The Sheriff helplessly calls after him:
SHERIFF
We'll be needing that for evidence!
Jerry and Rachel's van pulls up to THE FEDERAL BANK OF
INDIANAPOLIS. Across the way is a STADIUM for the COLTS. The
parking lot's full, mid-game. They stare;.steeling themselves
for the inevitable...
RACHEL
a Federal bank?
JERRY
Could be worse. Could.be.a Federal
Prison.
Latesha sits next to the DOUBLE DOORS. Laptop open, typing
madly. She's been waiting a long, long time -- WHEN SUDDENLY
they burst open and she SNAPS to her feet. Standing expectantly
as GENERAL after GENERAL files out of the situation room. Each
as tall and broad as the next --
LATESHA
(looking UP at them all)
Afternoon... afternoon, sir...
afternoon... afternoon, General...
Pretty intimidating. Finally CALLISTER walks out, flanked by
ADVISORS. The weight of the world's on his shoulders.
LATESHA (CONT'D)
Secretary Callister?
He looks back, preoccupied. She catches up, holding her ID:
LATESHA (CONT'D)
Latesha Simms, DHS, level 2 clearance. I
need to ask you a question, sir --
3/28/07 58.
CONTINUED:
CALLISTER
Not now, you can direct it to my office.
LATESHA
It'll only take a minute, sir, thirty
seconds -- B-36? Can you tell me what it
is? 'Cause its not --
CALLISTER
-- you don't have clearance, Agent Simms,
and I don't have thirty seconds.
LATESHA
So should I assume it has something to. do
with the four CVN class 21 aircraft
carriers you and the president just
ordered to the Strait of Hormuz -?
He looks at her, stunned. How the hell--?
LATESHA (CONT'D)
I just checked the intel, sir, we have
some of the same indexes --
CALLISTER
You need to stop assuming.
And he moves on. Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling
like a mouse in cage filled with lions. Until she ROARS:
LATESHA
Secretary Callister.
Voice echoing down the hail. Callister stops short, stunned by
the gall and volume of this woman. She weaves through the
GENERALS, planting herself in front of him:
LATESHA (CONT'D)
My Department's tracking a home-grown
terrorist on the loose as we speak who
may be connected to a cell with ties
inside this building. Now seeing as you
just had a meeting back there with more
brass than the Navy Marching Band and
with the terror threat rising every three
hours, I'm going to just have to assume
you're in the middle of a very delicate
dance to stave off World War Three... so
with all due respect, you either give me
my thirty seconds and tell me what the
hell B-36 is, or this world just fell
into an even bigger heap of trouble.
Sir.
Callister looks down at her, completely struck dumb. She's hit
a chord deep inside him. It's called balls. SLAM TO:
3/28/07 59.
The bank's roped off and labelled "CRIME AREA." Morgan
questions the Couriers, studies their transport manifest:
MORGAN
Biotech? The chemical company?
BRINKS COURIER #2
When they make a new compound, they, hold
it in a vault for clinical trials.
MORGAN
(scans the manifest)
Why'd the HAZMAT office issue a special
permit for the case?
BRINKS COURIER #1
You'd have to ask -- could be` anything
from a boner pill to a bioweapon, they
never tell us.
BRINKS COURIER #2
Tell you one thing, though... the guy
never handled a gun before.
That LANDS with Morgan.
He nods to an agent, dismissing the
couriers. Grant approaches:
AGENT GRANT
We pulled video... nothing. No good
angles on Shaw or the girl.
MORGAN
There.are 14 visible cameras in the
lobby! " 8 hidden no one can see!
AGENT GRANT
Gotta be a hacker, someone keeping them
ahead of us.
MORGAN
It's a Federal bank; encryption doesn't
get more secure.., from now on assume our
air's been compromised, too. Tell
everyone to go secure on Tac-3, nobody
communicates outside this task force
without my say-so.
3/28/07 69.
CONTINUED:
AGENT GRANT
I'm on it -- also: they found this
upstairs, but the trace signal's dead --
Holds up an evidence bag with Jerry's BONE MIC inside.
MORGAN
Do not tell me that is what I think it
is.
(snatches it, pissed)
Goddamnit, who's leading these people
around?! Someone's behind the Wizard of
Oz!
He turns and spots something: A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in the
window of a 7-11. Starts MOVING toward it.--
Jerry approaches the door, hair now BROWN. Beat. He knocks:
JERRY
Rachel? We gotta go
INTERCUT: Rachel in the bathroom, her face betraying the horror
of what she's just heard, what Aria's just told her to do --
RACHEL
What? No way, I can't just --
ARIA
-- when the time comes I'll instruct you
to stepaway:fromJerry. Once you hear
those words, you'll have thirty seconds.
JERRY (V.0.)
Rachel? You in there?
ARIA
Answer Jerry, please.
INTERCUT:;Jerry still standing outside the door. Rachel's
VOICE,"mustering strength through the door:
RACHEL (V.0.)
COMING)
Steeling herself, she steps out. Forces a smile while averting
her eyes. And pushes past h2-,n like he's lagging...
MOVING FAST together down the same corridor Paul went down.
They turn a corner... and STOP DEAD:-
A FIRE EXTINGUISHER is mounted on the wall.
Latesha sees the placement of the CAMERAS caddy-corner to the
intersecting hallways... and knows what Paul was doing:
LATESHA
It's the only spot in the hallway not
covered by .the cameras.
(LOW)::
He was hiding something from her.
A SHIFT to ARIA CAM confirms it: she can't see exactly what
they're doin
Latesha moves urgently to the extinguisher, starts examining it
for something, anything... but finds NOTHING.
LATESHA (CONT'D)
I don't get it. He had to be saying
'Fire Extinguisher.'
Scott pulls a MAINTENANCE SHEET off the wall. Scans --
SCOTT
Maintenance replaced it yesterday.
(scanning the sheet)
This isn't right... they weren't supposed
to do it til June.
They lock eyes.

LATESHA
(WHISPERS)
She read the code too... where's
'Recyling'?
The limo glides through traffic. In back, Rachel's nodded off.
Jerry watches her from across the limo, sketching something on a
cocktail napkin... RACHEL'S FACE. It's a perfect, beautiful
rendering. And we sense something in his look too--
something's changed. As Rachel wakes with a start --
RACHEL
Hey -- sorry, I didn't mean to -- am I
drooling? I bet I'm drooling. You
didn't sleep?
JERRY
Night shifts. I'm used to.
Rachel sits up, sees the napkin. Grins, surprised.
RACHEL
Wow, is that me?
JERRY
One of my only party tricks.
RACHEL
(truly impressed)
It's really good.
Jerry looks down at it, not used to having his work appreciated.
Rachel, can see how deeply affected he was by what Aria said.
It seems to make her feel uuiilty somehow... kinder...
RACHEL (CONT'D)
About what Aria said... I'm sorry.
They're;starting to connect. He glances out the window...
JERRY
You have to understand, I wasn't his
twin, I was more like his... little
brother. Always trying to catch up. And
you wouldn't believe how... nice he was
to me. Teaching me things when we were
kids, telling me how great I was. He was
the only one who ever did.
(almost smiles)
Of course he was involved in some super
secret National Security project. He was
a superstar. He had a rocket strapped to
his back. I'm the fuck-up.

CONTINUED:
JERRY (CONT'D)
I wear it like a medal, like it actually
means something... but the funny thing
is? This is probably the most important
thing I'll ever do. This. Right now.
This completely insane journey or
whatever it is. I'm actually needed in
something, me. Jerry Shaw is required.
But what am I thinking? I'll probably
fuck this up, too --
RACHEL
You're being too hard on yourself--
JERRY
No. I'm not being hard enough. That's
been the problem.
They look at each other. A real moment for Jerry. A seismic
shift in his life perspective. But then something catches his
eye -- his look DARKENS. Out the window, a highway sign:
"DAYTON INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT." The driver's.tinted divider
window lowers, he offers a folder.
CHAUFFEUR
Your passports and itinerary.
Now Rachel's seen the airport. sign, too. Looks at Jerry...
JERRY
(to driver)
Uh... could you give us a minute?
The Chauffeur nods, the window RISES again. Heart pounding,
Jerry grabs the briefcase and slides back the timer sheath to
check the countdown: "00:15:36...00:15:35..."
RACHEL
You don't think --
JERRY
-- we know what she can do, she doesn't
need us to crash a plane --
RACHEL
-- what if it's not about just one plane?
They look at each other. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. What to do. When
Rachel grabs the briefcase as the limo pulls curbside.
RACHEL (CONT'D)
I have more to lose in this. If anything
happens to Kyle then my life's over
anyway --
But Jerry grabs her hand, taking the case.
3/28/07 78.
CONTINUED: (2)
JERRY
Rachel -- til we met, I had nothing to
lose. We do this together.
A LONG LOOK BETWEEN THEM. As they realize, this could be it.
A chopper TOUCHES DOWN near a waiting contingent of AGENTS and
AIRPORT PD -- Morgan and Grant hop out on the MOVE, handing out
BLURRY VIDEO STILLS from the 7-11:
MORGAN
He's with a brunette female,
approximately five-seven -- I want
airport PD at all exits -- have the tower
shift commander ground every flight outta
here under Federal jurisdiction but don't
change the departure boards, I don't want
'em to know we're coming--
The agents enter the airport through a door on the tarmac --
A FORKLIFT rolls down the aisle to.the crate. The DRIVER picks
it up, drives it out toward the tarmac. There, waiting, is a C-
130 ARMY TRANSPORT PLANE...
A HELICOPTER ERUPTS INTO VIEW, barreling toward THE PENTAGON.
Up front beside the pilot is Morgan; Grant filling him in:
AGENT GRANT
-- they were moving experimental
explosives from a testing facility in
Aberdeen.
MORGAN
What do you mean, 'experimental?'
AGENT GRANT
Compound called 'Hex' -- some kinda weird
crystals that detonate with a sonic
trigger -- it disappeared too, few days
ago.
3/28/07 89.
CONTINUED:
MORGAN
Wanna give me some kind of ratio here?
AGENT GRANT
One crystal to a football field --
MORGAN
You mean one Goddamned crystal that
someone could put in their pocket?!
(pulls off glasses)
This is not good. This is not a
coincidence. What about a trace?
AGENT GRANT
Computer log shows the diverted Hex was
sent to an address in Virginia,.jewelry,
shop called 'Ashland And Sons' - care
of Jerry Shaw.
Morgan puts his glasses back on and looks hard at Grant. Opens
his mouth to give and order when--
AGENT GRANT (CONT'D)
(cutting him off)
-- I'm all over it. ''.
Grant finally coming to his own when they're suddenly cut off by
two ARMY BLACKHAWK CHOPPERS, door gunners at the ready:
BLACKHAWK PILOT (V.0.)
(over squawk box)
Helo flight VY84X, you're in restricted
US Military Airspace. Identify.
CHOPPER PILOT
Blackhawk flight, we're on a DHS pri-one
mission to the Pentagon heliport. FAA
will confirm, over.
Morgan just wants to get the fuck down there -- finally:
BLACKHAWK PILOT (V.0.)
Roger, FAA confirms. We'll lead you in.
As the Blackhawks dip toward the Pentagon, the pilot follows:
CHOPPER PILOT
(to Morgan)
Sorry. State of the Union tonight,
they're locking up the city.
PENTAGON HELIPORT: The choppers touch down -- Morgan jumps into
a waiting SW while Grant hops into another HELICOPTER:
3/28/07 90.
CONTINUED: (2)
MORGAN
(to armed officers)
We have two fugitives in the building,
get us to 'Freight and Cargo' -- close
all access points and seal the building--
The SUV races into the fire tunnel, toward the center ring
The door's SOUNDPROOF, the GUARDS oblivious -- video screens
show everyone still in the vault. Aria's looped the feed.
3/28/07 100.
SATELLITE VIEW -- the armored van travelling along the highway.
We SNAP CLOSER and realize it's Aria, tracking the van --
At the back of the vehicle, a window lowers and all electronics
fly out: blackberrys, watches, walkie-talkies, the GPS --
ARIA'S POV: the items are RUN OVER, DESTROYED by speeding cars --
Quiet. Two AIR FORCE MECHANICS shoot the shit. Behind them...
A MOBILE HYDRO-PNEUMATIC UAV (AERIAL DRONE) LAUNCHER. Dormant
along a line of other dormant launchers. These MINI-DRONES are
similar to the one we saw in our opening,. only they're strictly
for surveillance. Smaller. Suddenly:
The launcher ACTIVATES, like it's just been woken up. The
girder arm TELESCOPES UPWARD, moving one of the mini-drones into
place like a Pez dispenser. The.mechanics RACE to the console:
AIR FORCE MECHANIC #1 AIR FORCE MECHANIC #2
-- is it supposed to do that?! I can't override it!
With a PNEUMATIC BLAST,the.drone's CATAPULTED into the sky --
PIVOTS purposefully, SOARS off --
The drone ROARS into frame over the armored truck -- descending,
about 10,000 feet away. Its nose cone emits a LASER BEAM that
hits the SMALL REAR WINDOW.
ARIA POV: "ACTIVATE LASER MIC." We HEAR Jerry's DOPPLERED VOICE:
JERRY (MIC FILTER)
--the President was on it, the Vice
President, there were like twelve people--
The armored vehicle SCREECHES to a U-TURN, heading up an
embankment by the Potomac
THE DRONE
A red light BLINKS and it suddenly dips down, dive-bombing the
truck --
JERRY AND MORGAN
TURN as they hear an INCOMING WHINE and... THE DRONE HITS THE
TRUCK'S TIRE LIKE A SUICIDE BOMBER, EXPLODING!!! The truck
FLIPS off its axis -- SKIDS trailing SPARKS -- and like a
monster cannonball, SLAMS into the water --
HORRIBLE IMPACT, BODIES TUMBLING AS THE TRUCK SINKS -- water
begins to flood in FAST -- Jerry SCRAMBLES, holding on -- the
truck TILTING as it DROPS farther and farther... he sees:
The guards through mesh steel up front, heads bashed against the
wheel and dashboard. Unmoving. Turns --
3/28/07 106.
CONTINUED:
MORGAN. Jesus. A bloody piece of metal PIERCED THROUGH HIS
CHEST. Blood fountains from his mouth --
JERRY
-- oh God -- nonononono --
Morgan's breathing, it's SHALLOW. Jerry tries to stop the
bleeding, to free the metal from Morgan's chest, but even
pulling it a centimeter causes Morgan to SCREAM in agony --
JERRY (CONT'D)
I'm sorry! Jesus, I don't know what --?
MORGAN
(bug-eyed, SHOUTS)
SHUT UP: KEYS -- MY BELT -- TAKE THEM --
Jerry sees them, grabs them -- starts desperately UNLOCKING his
own cuffs --
MORGAN (CONT'D
MY BADGE -- COAT POCKET --
JERRY
(frozen in horror)
-- lemme try and get you. free
MORGAN.
NO!!! LISTEN TO ME: THERE'S A PERIMETER
AROUND THE:'CAPITOL, TELL 'EM YOU NEED TO
GET TO THE SERGEANT OF ARMS, THEY HAVE TO
RADIO IN A 10-13, IT'S AN EVACUATION
ORDER -- YOU UNDERSTAND? 10-13, SAY YOU
UNDERSTAND!
The water's up to their chins, now --
JERRY
I UNDERSTAND!!!
MORGAN
THEN GO!!! THERE'S NO TIME!
The water ENVELOPS them. Morgan shoves him away, even now, even
under water, stabbing his finger at Jerry: GO!
And Jerry looks at him. Moved and awed by this tremendous act
of sacrifice. Finally twists round and kicks away at the
shattered window, taking one last look behind him... SWIMS OUT.
Kyle's class files off the bus, escorted by Secret Service
Agents. HARRIER JETS blast overhead, Hummers with Stinger
missiles are parked in a defensive line. Kyle looks around,
awed, clutching his TRUMPET CASE --
SERIES OF SHOTS: The Capitol's locked up like Fort Knox:
Road blocks cover a 3 mile radius. The National'G.uard is
stationed.
Spotters with binocs and shoulder-mounted rocket launchers scan
the horizon.
Secret Service and U.S. Capitol Police run security inside the
building and out. Explosive Ordinance Disposal Teams with bomb
dogs check the House floor. Over these images:
RADIO VOICES
Were green on arrivals,;S.O.S., Interior
are at the Capitol ;steps` -- VP and
President's motorcade twenty minutes
away.
Jerry staggers up the embankment, wet, bloody. MOVES to the
street. SIRENS in the background.!. Sees a WOMAN parking her
Toyota Matrix. Yanks open her.: door and shows Morgan's ID:
JERRY
The government would like to buy you a
new car --
Pulls her out as she WAILS in protest. Steps on the gas,
veering onto a SIDE STREET -- as CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! The
TRAFFIC CAMERA takes his picture and we CUT TO:
ARIA CAM: Jerry's face: "82% PROBABLE MATCH -- SHAW, JERRY."
One of the Harrier jets SOARS over the city, securing airspace.
IN THE COCKPIT, the pilot REACTS as his display suddenly goes
BLANK and the stick LOCKS UP --
JET PILOT
One to Base: alert, alert! Primary
function's jammed, transponder's
firewalled -- respond! One to Base do
you copy?!
But of course the answer's no, because Aria's taken control of
the let -- and what's more, the display REACTIVATES: "EJECT
SEQUENCE COMMENCED... 5... 4... 3... 2...
JET PILOT (CONT'D)
WHAT THE HE --
3/28/07 110
CONTINUED:
THE PNEUMATIC CANOPY BLOWS, EJECTING THE PILOT! He rockets away
as his parachute DEPLOYS -- now the jet's flying itself --
ON THE HEAD'S UP DISPLAY: a SATELLITE GRID appears, vectoring
the Matrix's coordinates to the jet, it SCREAMS into a valley.
The matrix crashes through trees, obscured under the forest
canopy -- Jerry hears the jet circling back around.
THE JET'S 20MM NOSE CANNON OPENS UP, MOWING DOWN THE FOREST --
Jerry SWERVES as trees splinter into a thousand pieces, like
MINI MISSILES launching at the car -- it's rocked violently but
Jerry keeps going flat-out at breakneck speed. ROARS PAST,
circles back -- with her superb aim, Aria FIRES A LONG BURST OF
BULLETS that rake across the Matrix's windshield
As the fireball DISSIPATES into the sky, cars SCREECH to a halt
-- people on their cell phones to call 911, but no phone has a
signal. Among drivers, we favor a COUPLE in a Prius--
WOMAN IN.PRIUS MAN
-- I can't...get 911 -- -- me neither --
A miles-long backup of traffic from the chaos...
JERRY RUNS LIKE HELL THROUGH BACKED-UP TRAFFIC, ON A MISSION --
ARIA SATELLITE POV: she tracks him as he races across a small
park and onto Pennsylvania Avenue -- THE CAPITOL DOME ahead--
Jerry sprints across the street when -- ALL THE LIGHTS SUDDENLY
TURN GREEN and a thirty cars barrel towards him. The deafening
HONK of a SEMI bearing down and he LEAPS in front of it, lust
clearing the grill and landing hard on the sidewalk.
3/28/07 114.
CONTINUED:
MAYHEM as cars SMASH into each other, people SCREAMING, horns
HONKING. Jerry staggers to his feet. Turns to look up at the
sky, eyes on fire, knowing he's being watched...
AND WITH A BIG GRIN, GIVES ARIA THE FINGER. KEEPS ON RUNNING --
By a barricade, two CAPITOL COPS react as Jerry races towards
them, bloody and panic-breathing, flashing Morgan's badge --
JERRY
Listen to me, I've been working with a
DHS officer, he gave me his badge, he was
just killed, you gotta radio in a 10-13--
CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER #1
Whoa whoa whoa, who the hell're you?
JERRY
You have to MOVE, right now! Radio it
n i n! There's a bomb in the building!
(they.look at each
OTHER):
You wanna be the guys who didn't do
something?!
ARIA'S SAT.VIEW ZOOMS IN JUST AS THE OFFICER KEYS HIS WALKIE:
CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER #2
Capitol, this is checkpoint 21, I've got
a guy out here who says --
SCREECH! HISS! The radio cuts him off with piercing FEEDBACK --
as Jerry breaks into a RUN--
CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER #1
Hey--!
The PRESIDENT'S MOTORCADE nears the Capitol. His limo's lead by
Motorcycle Cops, headlights FLASHING, Secret Service...
The Presidential convoy slows by PRIVATE ENTRANCE. The Secret
Service agents exit in unison -- scanning: for trouble --
The Secret Service opens the limo door for THE PRESIDENT. The
PRESS POOL snaps photos as he's ushered towards the Capitol --
As the cops drag Jerry around a corner... he suddenly HEAD-BUTS
one of them and BREAKS the grab. Starts RUNNING LIKE HELL --
the agents draw weapons and pursue -- into wrist mic:
SECRET SERVICE AGENT
10-13! 10-13! COPY!
But all he gets is that SCREECHING FEEDBACK in his earpiece --
Kyle's birthday party: streamers, other kids, cake, ad hoc
soccer game. Rachel cutting pieces of cake when --
KYLE'S VOICE
Jerry!
She turns to see JERRY standing there. He's still got his
scratches, arm in a SLING. It's the only real injury we can see
and it'll heal. Kyle runs up to him and throwing his arms
around his waist.
JERRY
Hey, little man!
Locks eyes with Rachel. Her heart beating like a drum, happier
to see him then she'd ever imagine. And. Jerry holds up a
present for Kyle.
JERRY (CONT'D).
Sorry I'm late, this was hard to find --
Rachel's eyes well. She pulls it back. Manages to say:
RACHEL
Kyle. What do you say?
KYLE
I dunno, I haven't opened it yet.
RACHEL
(rolls her eyes, grins)
Who brought you up?
Kyle rips open the present to find a brand new PLAYSTATION 3.
KYLE
They're on backorder everywhere! Mom --
can I go play with it?
RACHEL
One hour. That's it...
As Kyle tears off with his friends, Jerry walks over to her.
It's like everyone else at the party has disappeared...
RACHEL (CONT'D)
(almost a whisper)
you remembered...

JERRY
My new thing.
(BEAT)
Responsibility.
RACHEL
It suits you.
JERRY
Yeah?
RACHEL
(SWEETLY)
Yeah.
He smiles, shrugs:
JERRY
I have my life back... I can do whatever
I wantihwtit.
RACHEL
You know what? Me too.
They smile at each other, like they have an enormous secret. He
tucks a loose hair behind her ear.,..,
JERRY
And I think... I finally know what I
want.
And we see in her eyes, she feels the same about him...
RACHEL
I owe you, Jerry. Everything. I don't
think you understand --
JERRY
(PLAYFULLY)
Hey: shh. Officially we can't talk about
it, remember?
RACHEL
Right. Or even about how we met.
(SHRUGS)
So what do we tell people?
He thinks about it. Smiles...
JERRY
I dunno -- computer dating service?
Rachel LAUGHS, giving him a playful push as we CUT TO:
3/28/07 125.
