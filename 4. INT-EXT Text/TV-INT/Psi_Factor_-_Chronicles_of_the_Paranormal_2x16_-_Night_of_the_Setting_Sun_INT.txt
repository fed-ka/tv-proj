                                    DAN AYKROYD
                    Like many people, I have long been
                      fascinated by cryptozoology, the
                    study of rare and sometimes mythical
                    animals.  Normally these creatures
                    live in remote areas, largely
                    untouched by man.  But could it be
                    possible for a previous unknown 
                    creature to survive undetected in
                    the center of a modern city?

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Davison circles Stephenson's corpse, dictating into an
      overhead mike as she goes.  She is accompanied by a CORONER.

                                      DAVISON
                    Neal Stephenson.  Caucasian.  Male. 
                      Twenty-four years old according to
                    his driver's licence.

      She circles the corpse.

                    Feet discoloured.  Almost black.

      She pats down his chest.                                    Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 8.

                    Good muscle tone.  Something of a
                    looker, our Mr. Stephenson.  If this
                    was myocardial infarction it must
                    have a congenital source.  Those
                    present at the time of death report
                    he was coughing up a storm.

      She leans down close to Stephenson's face.

                          (surprised)
                    Crusted with blood.

      She turns his head to the side.  Opens his mouth.  Blood
      dribbles out.  She looks inside.

                                      DAVISON (CONT'D)
                    Blood in the mouth.  He died so fast
                    he didn't even have time to swallow. 
                    Could be respiratory failure.

                    His lungs are filled with a thin,

                    the lung tissue.

                    This is not good.

                          (shaken)
                      Stephenson died.  The symptoms,
                    congealed lungs, blackened feet,
                    resemble Spanish Influenza.

                    You better get down here right away.

                                      DAVISON
                    Can't.  I'm under quarantine.  The
                    best I can do is forward materials
                    to the health authorities to help
                    develop a vaccine.  Of course, that
                    won't help anyone who is already
                    infected.  Like me.

      OFF Davison's concern --

      LINDSAY DONNER (28, fiercely intelligent) on a cell phone.

                                      DONNER
                    Neal Stephenson was the last surviving
                    member of his family.  I tracked
                    down his executor: a Lisa Benning. 
                    She's also a director of the family
                    company.

                                      PRAEGER (O.S.)
                          (through phone)
                    When are you meeting her?                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 13.

                    Half an hour.
                          (off file)
                    Here's something odd.

                                      PRAEGER (O.S.)
                          (through phone)
                    What?

                                      DONNER
                    Well, H.L. Stephenson & Sons is really
                    just a holding company.  Except,
                    according to their balance sheet,
                    they still make some hand-crafted
                    furniture for the high end market.

      RESUME PRAEGER

                                      PRAEGER
                    But this place looks deader than
                    dead.  Keep in contact.

                                      DONNER (O.S.)
                          (through phone)
                    You too.  Bye.

      Praeger turns the corner of the mobile lab to find...

      Axon installing the gangplank which leads into the mobile
      lab.  As Axon locks the steps into place, Praeger walks up
      the ladder.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Thanks, Pete.

                    I don't think this was in my job
                      description.

      And Praeger heads into...


      ...where Praeger finds Cooper observing the passenger pigeon
      in the "snake box".

                                      PRAEGER
                    Seems lively for an extinct species.

                                      COOPER
                    Columba ectopistes.  In the 1800's
                    they would flock in the billions.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 14.

                                      COOPER (CONT'D)
                    But a well-organized team of men and
                    boys could net 250,000 in a single
                    day.  Pack them in barrels and sell
                    the meat.  The last passenger died
                    in a zoological garden in 1914.

                                      PRAEGER
                    So how did a bird and a virus not
                    seen in eighty years pop up here at
                    the same time?  Could the pigeon be
                    a carrier of the virus?

                                      COOPER
                    Possibly.  One theory is that flu
                    strains originate when avian flus
                    and swine flus combine with human
                    strains.  It's called viral sex.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Kinky.

                                      COOPER
                    New flu strains usually start in
                    migratory birds.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Pigeons don't migrate.

                                      COOPER
                    Passenger pigeons did.

      Hendricks joins them.  He carries four plastic bottles filled
      with a viscous orange liquid.  He passes them out to Cooper
      and Praeger.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Drink this.  It should help.
                          (off Praeger's dubious
                            look)
                    It's just orange juice with added
                    glucose.

                                      PRAEGER
                    What, no chicken soup?

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Keep hydrated.  And if you experience
                    any back aches, coughs or other
                    symptoms -- find me.

      Donner talks with LISA BENNING, late 30s, stylish.  In
      contrast, her office is a small and undistinguished.

      Benning SNEEZES.

                                      DONNER
                    Bless you.

                                      BENNING
                    Ragweed.  Every fall.

      Donner hands her a card.

                                      DONNER
                    This is the city health office.  You
                    should check in with them.

                                      BENNING
                          (uneasy)
                    Thanks.  I just saw Neal last week. 
                    He seemed fine.

                                      DONNER
                    How well did you know him?

                                      BENNING
                    Neal was a client I inherited from
                    my dad.  The fourth and last
                      generation to guide H.L. Stephenson
                    & Sons.

                                      DONNER
                    Who takes over now, Ms Benning?

                                      BENNING
                    I guess I do.  His will creates a
                    trust to preserve the factory complex
                    as a private historical site.

                                      DONNER
                    The OSIR could recommend historians
                    to work with you on this project.

                                      BENNING
                    Thank you, but we'll manage.

                                      DONNER
                    Who are the trustees?

                                      BENNING
                    There's only one.  Josef Schullman. 
                    I believe he's a friend of Neal's.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 16.

                                      BENNING
                          (abruptly)
                    I've never met him.  Ms Donner, I
                    want your colleagues to leave the
                    factory.  It's dangerous.  The
                      floorboards are rotted through. 
                    It's a firetrap.

                                      DONNER
                    Really?  Then why is it still
                    producing furniture?

                                      BENNING
                    Where did you hear that?

                                      DONNER
                    Your annual report.  Aren't company
                    directors personally responsible for
                    fire safety violations?

                                      BENNING
                    What do you want?

                    Just access for a few days.

      With a sigh, Benning nods her agreement.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Cooper enters the vast room.  Peers into the darkness.

      On the floor he finds some DROPPINGS.  Scrapes them up into
      a metal container.

      Cooper hears a faint WHAMP.  He stands up.  Listens carefully.

      Cooper caps the container.  Behind him the floorboards CREAK
      and MOAN.  Cooper wheels around.

      There's no one there.

      Cooper exhales.  He cautiously makes his way further into
      the room.  He spots...

      AN OLD FASHIONED CHICKEN COOP

      Inside, passenger pigeons COO.

                                      COOPER
                    Wow.

      Cooper reaches out to the pigeons.

      Steps ECHO ahead of them, CLATTERING up the stairs.  Axon
      and Praeger charge up the stairs.  They reach the...


      A large old fashioned workshop.  Praeger feels the hackles
      rise on the back of his neck again.  Are they being watched?

      Pause.  Quiet.  They listen again.  Nothing.

      Axon pulls a drop cloth off of a pedal-powered lathe.

      Praeger finds straight-backed chairs with round legs.

                    look milled - they look like they
                    were hand forged.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 19.

      Another sound.  The GROAN of machinery.

                                    AXON
                    Freight elevator!

      They race down the stairs to --

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      The ground floor.  The elevator SHUDDERS into position.  The
      door opens.  No one's there.

      OFF Praeger's frustration --

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      The Schullmans sit around the table.  They tear into OSIR
      prepackaged rations and plates of sandwiches.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 22.

      The Schullmans eat ravenously.

      Juice dribbles over the chin of a COUSIN (male 20's).

      The Cousin leans close over his plate and rips apart a chicken
      sandwich, eating only the meat.

      Food slobbers out the side of Josef's mouth.  He wipes it
      away with the back of his sleeve.  He grabs a sandwich from
      the center of the table.  His eyes lock with his Cousin's. 
      The Cousin backs down.  Josef takes the sandwich.

      On the other side of the glass partition, Praeger and
      Hendricks watch them eat.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Charming.

      With a nod, Hendricks draws Praeger into...


                                      HENDRICKS
                    They show all the early signs of
                      malnutrition.

                                      PRAEGER
                    They must have relied on Stephenson
                    for their groceries.

      Praeger finds Sophie's skipping rope on the counter.

                                      PRAEGER (CONT'D)
                    That's interesting.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    What?

                                      PRAEGER
                    The handles are made out of wood not
                    plastic.  Look at the carving.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    This is no toy.  It's an antique.

      Praeger considers this.

                                      PRAEGER
                    I want to see what Cooper found.

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 23.


      Cooper and Praeger stand in front of an old-fashioned chicken
      wire set of coops.  Pigeons COO.  Sophie gives them the tour.

                                      SOPHIE
                    That's Clara and that's Lillian.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Lillian.  Nice name for a pigeon.

                                      SOPHIE
                    She's my favorite.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Sophie do you mind waiting while Dr.
                    Cooper and I talk?

                                      SOPHIE
                    No.  Are you a real doctor?

                                      COOPER
                    I'm an animal doctor.

                                      SOPHIE
                    Oh, you're a veterinarian.

      She moves away and starts skipping in the background.

                                      COOPER
                    It looks like the Schullmans bred
                    these for generations.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Why?

                                      COOPER
                    For meat.

      The FLAP FLAP FLAP of Sophie's skipping starts.

                                      PRAEGER
                    If they're eating pigeons no wonder
                    they're starving.

                                      COOPER
                      Interesting.  There's only sixteen
                    birds in the flock.  They kept the
                    bare minimum to promote genetic
                      variation.

      Praeger glances over to Sophie.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 24.

                                      PRAEGER
                    They don't look like geneticists to
                    me.

      Sophie chants as she skips:

                                      SOPHIE
                    I had a little bird.  And it's name
                    was Enza.  I opened the window.  And
                    in - flew - Enza.

      Where Hendricks draws blood from Josef.  Josef sits in the
      med chair.  Josef's shirt is off.  Hendricks applies a cotton
      swab to the crook of Josef's elbow.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Just apply a little pressure there.

                                      JOSEF
                    No one in my family has needed to
                    see a physician for some time.  Really
                    Sir, I feel fine.

      Praeger joins them.

                                      JOSEF (CONT'D)
                          (to Praeger)
                    But you, Sir, look pale.  You should
                    work more in the sun.

      Praeger steps behind the chair and examines Josef's shirt as
      they talk.  And as they talk, Hendricks checks out Josef's
      lymph nodes.

                                      PRAEGER
                    I should.  Where exactly do you and
                    your family live?

                                      JOSEF
                    In the vicinity.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Here, at the factory?

                                      JOSEF
                    Yes.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 25.

                                      JOSEF
                    Sophie?  She's my cousin.  We teach
                    her at home.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Doesn't she miss having friends?

                                      JOSEF
                    We have our work, our family, our
                    beliefs, Sir.

                                      PRAEGER

                                      JOSEF
                    It is a good life.

      Josef stands up.  Praeger hands him his shirt.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Elena coos to the pigeon Cooper captured earlier.

                    You found Barrymore.  Sophie will be
                    so pleased.

      Axon attaches his laptop to a SPECTROMETER.

                                      ELENA (CONT'D)
                          (re: the laptop)
                    That is a beautiful machine, Peter. 
                      Wonderfully crafted.  Can you show
                    me how it works?

                                    AXON
                    Sure.

      He picks up a core sample and empties some dirt into a Petri
      dish.  He slides it under the spectrometer's aperture.

                                    AXON (CONT'D)
                      I collected this soil sample this
                    morning.

      Axon fires up a program, hoping to impress her.  Numerical
      data races across the screen.  She presses closer to him,
      the better to see the screen.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 26.

                                    AXON (CONT'D)
                    The machine, ah, bounces light off
                    the dirt and then tells this machine
                    what minerals are there.

                                      ELENA
                      Wonderful.

                                    AXON
                    And it tells me...you are living on
                    top of magnetic rock.  Iron ore,
                    nickel, lead.  Other heavy metals.

                                      ELENA
                    And that is not good?

                                    AXON
                    It's not exactly healthy.  How long
                    have you been here?

      Elena changes the subject.

                                      ELENA
                    Have you not done enough work for
                    the day?

                                    AXON
                          (with a smile)
                    You planning to get me into trouble?

                                      ELENA
                    No, just out in the air.  I would
                    love a walk.

                                    AXON
                    Sure.  You can show me around.

                                      ELENA
                    No.  I mean outside the wall.  Outside
                    of here.  You can escort me.  The
                    other girls on the promenade will be
                      completely jealous.

      Praeger and Josef come around the corner.  Josef notices
      Elena's attention to Axon.

                                      JOSEF
                    Elena, do not bother Mr. Axon.  We
                    should go.

      With a regretful glance back to Axon, Elena steps to her
      cousin's side.

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 27.


      Team meeting.  Axon, Hendricks and Cooper are seated.  Donner
      and Davison are on the big screen (split screens).  Praeger
      considers the white running shoe in its evidence baggie.

                          (on screen)
                    We're making progress on the vaccine. 
                    But it's slow going.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Any more reported cases?

                          (on screen)
                    Twelve.  Three fatalities.

      Praeger coughs.  Axon and the others look concerned.

                                      PRAEGER
                    I'm fine.

                                    AXON
                    You don't look fine.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Let's just say I'm waiting for the
                    other shoe to drop.

                                      DAVISON
                    Take care of him.  I'll check in
                    later.

      She BLIPS off the screen to be replaced by an OSIR logo.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Matt, maybe we should get ourselves
                    to a better facility.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Maybe we should figure out what's
                    going on first.  Medical report.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    All the Schullmans have influenza
                      antibodies in their blood but few
                    active cells.  They are carriers.

                    No current records for Josef or Elena
                      Schullman.  They've never even paid

                                      HENDRICKS
                    That could fit with their behaviour.
                          (to Praeger)
                    Have you noticed the close family
                      structure, the emphasis on work and
                    religious beliefs?  These are people

                    Neither of you two are symptomatic.

      Praeger joins Hendricks over at the microscope.

                                      PRAEGER
                          (to Hendricks)
                    What do you have?

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Josef and Elena both possess extensive
                    amounts of telomorase in their
                    systems.

                                      PRAEGER
                    I take it that's unusual.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Normally, you'd only find telomorase
                    in cancer cells.  It's the enzyme
                    which helps protect the chromosomes
                    and allows cells to keep reproducing.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Anton, start from the top.

                                      HENDRICKS
                          (beat)
                    Think of a cell like a shoelace.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Okay.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Over time.  Just from ordinary use,
                    our cells lose their elasticity and
                    start to fray.  That's one theory as
                    to why we age.

                                      PRAEGER
                    And telomorase...

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Builds the plastic tips which protect
                    the ends of shoelaces.  So long as
                    you have that, your cells keep
                      reproducing.  Now, cancer cells have
                    the unlimited capacity to keep going
                    until their source of nutrition, the
                    tissues they attack, is gone.

                                      PRAEGER
                    So the Schullmans' entire system
                    works like a cancer.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 40.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Yes.  You know what this means?  If
                    we can replicate the Schullmans'
                      biochemistry, we can stop all
                      degenerative diseases associated
                    with aging.  We could live forever.

                                      PRAEGER
                    But on what exactly?

      The room is empty.  Axon turns on his flashlight.

                                      COOPER
                    Where's Sophie?

                                    AXON
                    Maybe she's at the Schullman town
                    meeting.  What's that?

      He turns the beam around to...

      THE STEEL FIRE DOOR


      The door SCREECHES open.  Light shines inside, silhouetting
      Axon and Cooper.  They move inside and find...

      FRANCO

      Almost dead.  Ghastly pale.  Hanging like a slab of meat,
      bound to rusted machinery.  He wears only one shoe.

                                      FRANCO
                    No.

                    Hang on.

                                      FRANCO
                    STAY AWAY!  STAY AWAY!
                          (beat)
                    Don't bleed me again.

      OFF Axon's horror --

      Cooper and Axon lay Franco down on the floor.

                                    AXON
                    Take it easy.  Take it easy.

                                      FRANCO
                    They pulled me down off the wall
                    and...and she left me.  With them.

      Franco passes out again.

                                    AXON
                    I'm getting Hendricks.

                                      COOPER
                    What did they do to him?

      He turns around and sees

      SOPHIE IN THE DOORWAY

      Her mouth is crusted with blood and gristle.  In her hands,
      the remains of a pigeon.  She sinks her teeth into it.

                                    AXON
                          (to Sophie)
                    What do you have there?

                                      SOPHIE
                    I didn't want to do it, but I got
                    hungry.

                                    AXON
                          (re: Franco)
                    We can carry him.

                                      COOPER
                    Not a good idea until Hendricks checks
                    him out.  I'll be okay with Sophie. 
                    Sophie and I are friends, right?

      Sophie stands silently, watching them.

                                    AXON
                    Okay.

      Axon carefully sidles by Sophie and is out the door.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 42.

      Sophie takes a few steps closer to Cooper and...

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Praeger and Hendricks.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    The Schullman cells replicate the
                    way a cancer would.  They would
                    require massive amounts of iron to
                    stay alive.  Liver, other internal
                    organs.

                                      PRAEGER
                    I'm betting they order their steaks
                    raw.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    The Schullmans -- or people like
                    them -- may actually be the factual
                    basis for the vampire myth.

                                      PRAEGER
                    So the Stephensons locked the gate
                    not to keep the world out, but to
                    keep something in.

      With a BHHHHHHJH the lights dim down to emergency level.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    What was that?

      Praeger checks the machinery and control consoles.

                                      PRAEGER
                    We're on auxiliary.  Someone must
                    have pulled out the cab's battery.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    Who would do that?                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 43.

                                      PRAEGER
                    I don't know.  Maybe the Schullmans.

      Josef Schullman's eyes pierce through the semi-light.

                                      JOSEF
                    Why not, Sir?  Simply because I choose
                    not to use electricity or modern
                      conveniences does not mean I do not
                      understand them or their use.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    What do you want?

                                      JOSEF
                    Our lives returned.  But with
                      Stephenson dead and you here that
                    does not seem possible.

      Josef steps into the light.  He is flanked by two of his
      COUSINS.  They are not armed.

                                      JOSEF (CONT'D)
                    We will take what we need and be
                    off.  I cannot vouch for the behaviour
                    of all my family.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Who can?

                                      HENDRICKS
                    We know how you survived this long.

      In the background, the cousins empty out Hendricks' medical
      cabinets.

                                      JOSEF
                    Do you?  I really do not think so. 
                    You cannot know what it is like to
                    be reviled and hunted.  For never
                    aging, for having hungers so acute
                    that you need to slaughter animals
                    for their blood alone.  For being
                      different.

      Praeger grabs the shotgun.

      Josef shakes his head sadly.  Holds out in his hand the
      shotgun shells.

                                      JOSEF (CONT'D)
                    She fired both barrels.

      A THIRD COUSIN circles behind Praeger and Hendricks.  They
      are boxed in.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 44.

                                      JOSEF (CONT'D)
                    Then we came to the New World and
                    thought we would be left alone.  But
                    it was the same.

      The Third Cousin edges closer.

                                      JOSEF (CONT'D)
                    Until the Stephensons offered us a
                    shelter of sorts.

      The Third Cousin launches at Praeger.  Praeger grabs a fire
        extinguisher off the wall.  Clouts the Third Cousin.

                                      JOSEF (CONT'D)
                    NO!

      The Third Cousin falls to his knees.  Praeger sprays him
      with the extinguisher.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Get him under control.

                                      JOSEF
                    Over here.

      The Third Cousin, partially blinded, staggers past Hendricks
      and Praeger to Josef.

                                      JOSEF (CONT'D)
                    He wasn't thinking.

                                      PRAEGER
                    Guess not.  Why are you doing this?

                                      JOSEF
                    Don't you think we deserve to survive?

                                      PRAEGER
                    Not at any cost.

                                      HENDRICKS
                    We can help you.

                                      JOSEF
                    Maybe you can.

      OFF Josef moving towards them --

      Cooper stands with Franco.

                    I'm hungry, Doctor Cooper.  We're

      Sophie approaches them.  Franco whimpers.

                    What will happen to the pigeons?

                    We will have to eat them, I suppose.                                  Psi Factor: Night of the Setting Sun - Final 46.

                                      COOPER
                    You know, I was thinking about Clara
                    and the others.  Maybe they would
                    like to fly again.  Maybe they want
                    to be on their own.  You could release
                    them, Sophie.  They would have a
                    chance.

                                      SOPHIE
                    But I'm so hungry.

      Sophie stares at the pigeon coop.

      Cooper takes the opportunity to gather Franco up.
