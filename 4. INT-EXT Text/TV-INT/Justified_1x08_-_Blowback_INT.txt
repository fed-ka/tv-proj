      AVA sits alone, picks at a wedge of cherry pie.  When a man *
      sits down across from her, she looks up with the beginnings *
      of a loving smile -- only to discover her former father-in-*
      law, BO CROWDER.  Yeah, the lion is out of his cage.  He s *
      grinning, but everything about him radiates menace.*

                                  BO*
                    What s wrong, daughter-in-law?  You *
                    look like you just walked over your *
                    own grave. *

      Ava stares, in shock, but unwilling to let Bo see it.*

                                  AVA*
                    Bo.  What rock did you crawl out *
                    from under?*

                                  BO*
                    I figured Givens would a told you I *
                    was getting out, seeing s how he s *

                    because I swear, if I d seen him *
                    inside, he d ve paid.  In blood.*

      Ava just looks at him. *

      Without asking, he pulls Ava s plate over to himself and uses *
      his fork to take a big bite of the pie.*

                                  BO (CONT D)*
                    The pie you get in prison is *

                    requires a little imagination.  But *
                    it simply cannot compare to a nice, *
                    warm, sticky piece of homemade.*

      Bo takes another bite of pie, stares at Ava. *

                    Time to go, old man.*

      Bo s not smiling anymore.  He looks down at Raylan s hand on *

      Bo nods toward the coffee shop s door, where a well-dressed *
      MAN (40s), whom we ll indeed come to know as the Crowders  *
      lawyer, stands watching them.  The lawyer HOLDS UP a *

      OMITTED44


      Raylan enters the bullpen, notices a pair of uniformed PRISON 
      GUARDS lounging outside the closed door of the holding cell.  
      One of them is TAPPING on the observation window the way a 
      kid might tap on the glass of an aquarium, trying to get a 
      rise out of the fish inside.  

      Art stands outside his office, shoots the shit with AUSA 
      DAVID VASQUEZ.  

                                  ART

                    Devil appears.

      Raylan and Vasquez shake hands. 

                                    VASQUEZ
                    You were right about Owen Carnes 
                    not offing himself.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Didn t take a genius to read that

                    Oh, I know, but I ve done a number 
                    of these.  Some people have a union

      WINONA arrives home.  She s carrying a sheaf of papers and a 
      black bag full of her steno equipment.  She heads for her 
      bedroom, puts her hand on the doorknob... and then stops.  
      She turns around, keeps walking toward the kitchen at the end 
      of the hall.


      Winona sees a STRANGE MAN, 30s, sitting at her kitchen table 
      in a way that (if we ve been paying attention) may echo 
      Raylan s similarly uninvited appearance at the same table 
      toward the end of the Pilot.

      Winona GASPS, drops her stack of papers.  The Man stands up

      nonthreatening as possible.

                    Mrs. Hawkins, I m so sorry to have 
                    startled you.  I assumed Mr. 
                    Hawkins had told you to expect me.

                    My name is Wynn Duffy. 

      Winona eyes Wynn Duffy warily, but his unaggressive manner, 
      coupled with his having known her name and the fact he s 
      wearing a suit and holding a briefcase, is enough to keep her 
      from running and/or Macing him.  She reaches out, takes the 
      card.

                    Mr. Hawkins hasn t mentioned 
                    anything?

                                  WINONA
                    Must have slipped his mind.

                    Not surprising given the number of 
                    things he has on his mind -- the 
                    safety of his family, for instance.  
                    Mrs. Hawkins, I can offer you and 
                    your husband the peace of mind that 
                    only comes with knowing your 
                    personal security situation is 
                    under control. 

      Winona s not scared anymore, but she doesn t buy a word of 
      this.

                                  WINONA
                    None of which explains what you re

                    Well, ma am, in order to upgrade 
                    your security situation, I first 
                    have to assess your security 
                      situation.

                                  WINONA
                    Mr. Duffy, what are you doing here?

                          (ignoring her)
                    And just because it s your 
                     physical security  we re working 
                    to safeguard, that doesn t mean all 
                    our solutions have to be physical. 
                    The average citizen has no idea how 
                    much the quality of their personal 
                    security is determined by the way 
                    they treat people, whether they 
                    live up to their obligations. 

                                  WINONA
                    I ll ask you once more--

                                  DUFFY
                    And also by the security of their 
                     personal information  -- which 
                    doesn t just mean bank passwords or 
                    social security numbers.  With one 
                    phone call, I was able to discover 
                    that the deposition you were 
                    scheduled to work this afternoon 
                    had been cancelled, letting me know 
                    that you d likely be home early and 
                    home alone.  Imagine what a genuine 
                    predator might have been able to do 
                    with that information.

                                  WINONA
                    Or I could call the police.

                                  DUFFY
                    The police?  The police are a 
                      janitorial service that comes to 
                    clean up your blood after you ve 
                    been murdered.  But if you want to 
                    trust them to handle your security 
                    needs... 

                                  WINONA
                    No, I mean now.  I mean I could 
                    call the police now, if you refuse 
                    to get out of my house.

                                  DUFFY
                    Mrs. Hawkins -- you haven t asked 
                    me to get out of your house.

                                  WINONA
                    Well, I m asking now.

                    That s fine.  I understand personal 
                    security can be an emotionally 
                    charged issue.

      He picks up his briefcase, heads for the back door.

                                  DUFFY (CONT D)
                    I hope you ll let Mr. Hawkins know 
                    I was here -- tell him I didn t 
                    forget.

      He leaves.  Winona closes the door behind him, throws the 
      dead bolt.  Off Winona standing frozen in her kitchen, 
      staring at the closed door--

                                                                          BACK TO:


      Art is still running Raylan through his dress rehearsal.

                                  ART
                    So you walk in, he s already alone, 
                    sitting by himself in the corner, 
                    nothing but ocean behind him?

                                  RAYLAN
                    That a problem?

                                  ART
                    Just seems like he made it easy for 
                    you.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (getting testy)
                    Didn t feel that way when he was 
                    drawing down on me.

      In the b.g., through the glass, the guards escort prisoner 
      CAL WALLACE, in leg irons and handcuffs, to the locker room.

                                  ART
                    All I meant is he did you a favor 
                    sitting there by himself, no one

                                  RAYLAN
                    And here I forgot to thank him.  
                    You know anybody carries a gun for 
                    a living who doesn t sit with their

                    If there was someone else at the

                                  ART
                    Meaning when you sat down, you were 
                    already planning to shoot him.

      They stare at each other for a moment while that sinks in.

                    You get what I m saying, Raylan?  
                    We have a letter-of-the-law, spirit-
                      of-the-law problem: guy pulls 
                    first, gives you no choice but to 
                    put him down.  Which is fine unless 
                    it looks like you maneuvered him 
                    into giving you no choice.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (gets it)
                    So, you want me to tell Vasquez I 
                    don t think in  what ifs. 

                                  ART
                          (yes)
                    Don t let him bait you into 
                      speculating, let your smart mouth 
                    talk you into a jackpot.  I ever 
                    tell you what my daddy said about 
                    lawyers?  He said,  Treat lawyers 
                    like mushrooms: feed  em shit and 
                    keep  em in the dark. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    You sure that was your daddy? 
                    Could ve sworn I heard it in a 
                    movie.

                                  ART
                    Where you think they got it?
                          (smiles)
                    Point is, Vasquez may be all right, 
                    but you still don t give him any 
                    more than you have to.  You let 
                    Bucks s history as a maggot, plus 
                    all the witnesses saw him go for 
                    his piece, do your talking.

      They re startled by a COMMOTION from the main room -- THUDS, 
      GRUNTS, ND SHOUTING ( Knife, knife, knife!   Drop it!  
       Bullshit, you drop it! ). 

      Raylan s out of his chair like a shot.  Art follows into--


      Mayhem near the entrance to the locker room.  Through the 
      door we can see one of the prison guards (call him Guard #2 -- 
      the one we saw earlier tapping on the holding cell s 
      observation window) on the floor, bleeding from the nose, 
      apparently unconscious.  The other guard (Guard #1) is being 
      used as a human shield by Wallace. 

      Several ND MARSHALS as well as RACHEL and TIM have drawn 
      their weapons and are SCREAMING orders and threats at 
      Wallace. 

      Wallace SHOUTS back at them, brandishes a shiv at the neck of 
      his hostage.  He kicks the locker room door shut.

      Off Raylan and Art taking in the situation -- 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT TWO


      Wallace pushes his hostage (Guard #1) away from him, then 
      quickly goes to Guard #2, moaning on the floor, and puts his 
      shiv to the man s eye.

                                    WALLACE
                          (to Guard #2)

                          (to Guard #1)
                    Do what I say or I pop his eye.


      Art backs the Marshals up.

                    I want those weapons back in their 
                    holsters right now and I don t want 
                    to see them again till I say 
                      otherwise.

                    Call Washington, tell them we need 
                    a SOG team.

      As Rachel moves off, Art notices Vasquez has returned and is 
      standing just inside the main door.  This is the last thing 
      Art has the time to deal with at the moment.

                    You need anything from my office, 
                    just let me know. 

      They hear metal scraping sounds from inside the locker room.  
      Art moves back toward the locker room door, where Raylan is 
      still standing.  

      Vasquez drifts over to the desk at which Rachel is on the 
      phone.

                    In case you re wondering why we

                                    VASQUEZ
                    I m not wondering anything.

      At the locker room door, Art motions for Raylan to follow him 
      to the holding cell.

      Raylan nods, lets his right hand drop to his belt.  But 
      Raylan can t help but see...

      Vasquez, standing near Rachel.  Art sees Raylan looking at 
      Vasquez.

                    Ignore him.  You have to pull, you

      They walk into...                EPISODE 106 - "BLOWBACK" - GOLD REVISIONS - 1/08/10    14.



      Art and Raylan enter.  Art goes up to the mirror/window.  
      They can only kind of see in through the mirror, see motion, 
      Guard #1 moving the lockers.

                    There s still a way for you to step 
                    back from the cliff here, Wallace -- 
                    you let those boys go and I ll 
                      personally see to it there s no 
                      retribution. 


      Wallace has handcuffed Guard #2 and is unlocking his own leg-
      irons.  Guard #1 is moving lockers (hence the metal scraping 
      sound) into position in front of the two windows and two 
      doors.

                    Depending on how bad that one boy s 
                    hurt, I might even be able to keep 
                    you out of the SHU.

                                    WALLACE
                    Who are you?

                                  ART
                    Chief Deputy Art Mullen.

                                    WALLACE
                    You re the boss, huh?  Well, do me 
                    a favor, bossman -- quit blowing 
                    smoke up my ass, before I decide to 
                    bite through one of these 
                      shitbirds  Adam s apples just to 
                    spit blood in your face.

      Raylan takes a look at Vasquez, figures what the hell, steps 
      up closer to the glass.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Chief s just trying to get this 
                    situation resolved before the Tac 
                    Team arrives, steals all the credit 
                    for bringing you out of there.

                                    WALLACE
                    Won t be my first time dealing with 
                    a Tac Team.

                    You re the shooter?

      Raylan is thrown -- is Wallace referring to his reputation 
      re: Tommy Bucks, etc?

                                    WALLACE (CONT D)
                    He brought you in to ghost me if 
                    things go any further south?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Chief s a good shot himself.  He 
                    taught firearms--

                                  RAYLAN
                    I am.

      Art looks at Raylan.  Raylan shrugs -- it s the truth.

      Guard #1 has finished moving the lockers.

                                    WALLACE
                          (to Guard #1)
                    On the floor, face down, cuff your 
                    hands behind your back.

      Guard #1 complies.

      With both guards down and cuffed, Wallace is free to move.  
      He gets up.  Through the narrow strip of glass not blocked by 
      a locker, he can see Art and Raylan in the holding cell.

                                    WALLACE (CONT D)

      Art gives Raylan a look -- you keep talking.  Raylan nods.  
      Art exits into...


      Art goes to Tim and Rachel.  Vasquez is standing with them.

                    Get us some eyes in there.

      Tim and Rachel move off.  Art looks at Vasquez.

                                  ART (CONT D)
                    Let s be clear.  Deputy Givens will 
                    try to talk Wallace out of there.  
                    But I have told him, if Wallace 
                    makes a move to kill, he s to take 
                    him out if he can.  My order.

                                    VASQUEZ
                    Chief, you have me all wrong.  I 
                    don t give a shit if Deputy Givens 
                    shoots Cal Wallace.

                                  ART
                    But you do give a shit that he 
                    killed a low-life like Tommy Bucks.

                                    VASQUEZ
                    Like the rest of the world I m 
                    delighted Tommy Bucks is dead.  But 
                    didn t the circumstances give you 
                    pause?

      Art has no answer to that.

      CROSSCUT

      Throughout the following, Wallace goes through the guards  
      belts and the lockers, looking for anything he can use -- 
      telescoping batons, socks to gag the guards, clothes to pad 
      himself up.

                                    WALLACE
                          (re: Vasquez)
                    That little guy in the suit some 
                    kind of big bossman?  He wasn t 
                    here when the hacks were walking me 
                    to the men s room.

                                    WALLACE
                    I do.  I saw how just now, before 
                    you tagged in, you kept looking out 
                    at that little guy, like you had to 
                    ask his permission.  

                                  RAYLAN

                    That why you didn t put me down at 
                    the jump?  You wanted to resolve

                    You were moving and dragging that 
                    poor guard.  No better than 50/50 I 
                    coulda put you down before you cut 
                    him.  Besides, the object of this 
                    exercise is everyone lives.

                                    WALLACE
                    You think you can pull that off?

                    You have much experience with this

                    You ve  established a rapport with

                    although he did sit around all 
                    morning with a shiv up his ass.

                    Which brings us to the sixty-four-
                      thousand-dollar question:  Is the

                    live?  Has he expressed needs or

                    realistic and achievable?   Told

                    See, the problem you have, Marshal, 
                    is I m doing four consecutive life 
                    sentences and no parole board in 
                    its right mind is ever gonna put me 
                    back on the street. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    So, as part of  establishing a 
                    rapport with the subject  am I 
                    supposed to weep with him over all 
                    the unsympathetic parole boards 
                    refuse to release him back into 
                    society when he clearly poses it no 
                    further danger?

                    Nah.  I wouldn t put me back on the 
                    street, either.  I just want to 
                    save us some time, let you know 
                    there s nothing you can offer me.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Sure.  What do you get for the man

                          (beat)
                    Thing is, no one who s not 
                       emotionally disturbed  takes 
                    hostages unless he wants something.

                                    WALLACE
                    Tell you what, Marshal -- you 
                    figure out what that might be, you 
                    let me know.

                                  RAYLAN
                    That s not how this works, me 
                    guessing at the key to your heart.  
                    In my experience -- and I know I 
                    haven t been through as many of 
                    these things as you -- but in my 
                      experience, you ask for what you 
                    want and I try to get it.

      Rachel shows Raylan photos of Wallace s tattoos, points to 
      one in particular -- of a tattoo on Wallace s chest: just the 
      name Simone.

                    We could try.

                                    WALLACE
                    Man, that would be great.  It d 
                    also be a miracle, considering the 
                    Simone on my chest is for David

                    Get their rocks off turning men

                    I m guessing it s not pleasant.

                    It s when the guards dump 
                      everything from your tray into a 
                    blender, then put that in the oven, 
                    cook it like a casserole, burn it

                                    WALLACE
                    Right.  So what I do, I screw with 
                     em back.  Pretend the  juke cake  
                    is fried chicken from Prince s Hot 
                    in Nashville, make sure the guards 
                    can hear me licking my fingers. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    I do love fried chicken.  Can t 
                    recall ever having any in 
                      Nashville, though.  They call it 
                    Prince s Hot  cause it s spicy?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Best fried chicken I ever had was 
                    the takeaway from Joe s Stone Crab 
                    in Miami.  You believe that?  A 
                    Kentucky boy has to go all the way 
                    to Florida to find his favorite?

                    Well, I can t say I ever made it 
                    down to Florida, so I don t feel 
                    qualified to judge.  I will say I 
                    find it tough to swallow the idea 
                    that the best chicken could be 
                    served by a place with  crab  in 
                    its name.

                    I was actually looking forward to 
                    coming here for the hearing.  Few 
                    days with a change of scenery.  I d 
                    at least enjoy the drive.  
                          (nods at guards)
                    But they made sure it was shit.  Up 
                    at three.  Cold eggs for breakfast.  
                    Travel in a van with no windows.  
                    Get here, they tap on the glass 
                    like I m a monkey in the zoo.

                    Closest SOG team is four hours

                    there, I d be happy to share it

                    You really think a box of chicken s

                    Can t say I think about it all that 
                    much.

                                    WALLACE
                    I had a boss once, back when I was 
                      roughnecking just after I left high 
                    school.  Ended up braining him with 
                    a piece of that heavy chain we used 
                    to use to trip pipe?  And when I 
                    say I brained him, I mean you could 
                    actually see brain coming out his 
                    nose.

                    four life sentences -- you get the

      Winona sits at the kitchen table in the same chair Wynn Duffy 
      used.  The papers she dropped earlier are still strewn all 
      over the floor.

      We hear (O.S.) the SOUND OF THE FRONT DOOR OPENING AND THEN 
      CLOSING.

                                  GARY (O.S.)
                          (calling)

                    In the kitchen.

      Gary appears in the kitchen doorway.  He s frazzled, sweating 
      a little.

                                  GARY
                    I can t remember the last time you 
                    called to ask me to come home early 
                    -- I thought maybe your father had 
                    another heart attack.

                                  WINONA
                          (calmly)
                    Your friend was here.

      Gary looks down at the papers scattered on the floor.

                                  GARY
                    What happened?

                    You don t want to know which 
                    friend?

                    right here.

                    I don t know -- we didn t get that

                    He could ve found an old checkbook

                    that.  
                          (beat)
                    Why didn t you tell me sooner?  

                                  GARY
                    Because I don t like talking about 
                    your ex-husband.  He strikes me as 
                    somewhat unbalanced.

      Winona just looks at Gary.  Gary matches her look.

                                  GARY (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  WINONA
                    Or maybe you didn t tell me about 
                    Raylan because there is something 
                    going on.

                                  GARY
                    Okay.  That s enough.

      Gary starts out.  Winona grabs him.

                                  WINONA
                    Gary, please just tell me what s 
                    happening so we can handle it 
                    together.

                                  GARY
                    I hope before our next 
                      interrogation you ll at least read 
                    me my rights.

      He storms out of the kitchen, heads for the front door. 
      Winona stands, but doesn t go after him.

                                  WINONA

      Raylan still stands just outside the closed doorway of the 
      locker room. 

                                    WALLACE
                    You know I worked as a security 
                    guard for a while -- one of those 
                    big office towers in Memphis.  My 
                    daddy got me the gig.  


      Wallace has laid out all the gear he needs -- batons, some 
      mace, the shiv.

                                    WALLACE
                    He worked for that outfit thirty 
                    years, sitting on his ass, signing 
                    for deliveries, checking IDs, 
                    anytime somebody asked him what he 
                    did he d say he was  in law 
                      enforcement. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    My daddy used to grift people out 
                    of their welfare checks.

      Just then, THE TAC TEAM, in bulky assault vests, helmets, 
      bags of weapons, enters the bullpen, led by STEVENSON.  

      Wallace hears the commotion.  

                                    WALLACE
                    That the Tac Team?

      Raylan says nothing.

                    Now we get to the fun part.

      Off Raylan, frustrated--

      OMITTED1414


      The Tac Team is in the bullpen, getting ready.  

      Art huddles with Stevenson, the Tac-Team commander, and 
      Stevenson s SECOND-IN-COMMAND.  They look both at the video 
      feed and a hand-drawn floorplan.

                                  ART
                    Windows here and here, 
                      shatterproof.  Doors here and here.  
                    Simple wood.  He s got  em all 
                    blocked with lockers.

                                  STEVENSON
                          (to his 2nd-in-command)
                    For starters, he doesn t need to 
                    see.

      His 2nd heads out into the bullpen. 

                                  ART
                    We need ten minutes.

                                  STEVENSON
                    For what?

                                  ART
                    We re waiting for something, might 
                    diffuse the situation.

      Stevenson looks at Art -- what?

                                  ART (CONT D)
                    One of Wallace s complaints is 
                    food.  Deputy Givens thought if we 
                    brought him some fried chicken it 
                    might do the trick.

                                  STEVENSON
                    You think he pulled a shiv out of 
                    his ass because he wanted lunch?

                                  ART
                    There s also the thought that it 
                    might not be a bad idea to give 
                    Wallace an out that let s him save 
                    face.

                                  STEVENSON
                    My experience, trying to appease 
                    the bad guy gives him the 
                      advantage.  The Israelis don t even 
                    talk anymore before they go 
                    tactical.  Longer we wait, more 
                    likely one of my boys gets hurt.  

                                  ART
                    But if my boy stops you having to 
                    assault, there s a chance nobody 
                    gets hurt.

                                  STEVENSON
                    Sorry, Chief.  Your boy s got maybe 
                    two minutes before my door-kickers 
                    are set.  Then we re going in --

                          (off their silence)
                    Didn t think so.  Two minutes.

      Stevenson heads out to join his team.  Vasquez pulls his

      Tim enters to find PORTER, 40, filling a big bag with buckets

      unfold a big square of black duvateen and quickly pull it up 
      over the window/mirror and tape it to the wall.

      Wallace sees the window to the holding cell go dark.

                    You wanna tell me how getting your 
                    head caved in by a Tac Team screws 
                    the guys who screw with you?

                                    WALLACE
                    When they do you like they done me -
                    - tell you for the rest of your 
                    life you don t get to choose when 
                    to sleep, when to eat, laugh, shit, 
                    talk -- they do you like that, 
                    you re screwing with them just by 
                    staying alive.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Sounds like another reason to give 
                    this up.

                    Sixty.

      Wallace blows out some ragged breaths, sounding almost like a 
      snarling animal -- he s obviously psyching himself up to slit 
      the guards  throats as soon as the Tac Team hits the door. 
      The guards look fucking terrified.

                                    WALLACE
                    Sooner or later, only way you can 
                    prove you re alive is to show you 
                    have the freedom to decide when you 
                    die.
                          (re: the guards)
                    Besides, Marshal, you know these 
                    two ll be dead long before my head 
                    gets caved.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I know if I see you moving to slit 
                    throats, I ll ghost you myself.

                                    WALLACE
                    Through a closed door?  On a 
                      quickdraw?  Nobody s that good.

                                  RAYLAN
                    If it was easy, anybody could do 
                    it.

                                    WALLACE
                    You sure you wanna go for your gun

                    in unpleasant circumstances stay 
                    alive not because they think 
                    things ll get better, but because 
                    they want to see how their story

                                    WALLACE

      Vasquez steps up to Stevenson and whispers something in his

                    Hold.

      In the conference room, Raylan looks as Tim enters with the 
      bag of chicken, a bottle of Jim Beam and two plastic cups.  
      Tim leaves.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Hey, Wallace.  See what I got here?

      Wallace peers out of the locker room, sees Raylan unpacking 
      the chicken.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                      Twenty-four-piece, extra-spicy.  
                    Think I saw some greens.  
                          (looks in bag)
                      Cornbread.  Potato wedges.

      Raylan takes a bite.

                                    WALLACE
                    What d they, crumble up some 
                      tranquilizers into it?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I sure hope not.

                    No one s trying to play you for a 
                    fool here, Wallace.  Way this

                    sit together and have a meal like a

                    you out, make sure no one gets 
                    nervous and decides to pop you.

      Silence.  Raylan takes another bite.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    Don t know if it s as good as

      Stevenson gives Art an impatient look, keys his mike.

                    In ten.

                    Whew!  If that don t cool it off

                    Five.

      And then...

      ...there s a scraping sound from inside the locker room.

      Raylan holds up his hand.

      Stevenson sees Raylan s hand.






















                                                                              (CONTINUED)                EPISODE 106 - "BLOWBACK" - GOLD REVISIONS - 1/08/10    37.

                    Hold.

      The scraping stops.  Beat.  Then the door from the locker 
      room into the conference room opens three inches.  A HAND 
      appears.  Holding the shiv.

      Raylan grabs the wastebasket, holds it out.

      Wallace drops the shiv, which THUNKS against the bottom of 
      the wastebasket.  Raylan passes Wallace a drumstick wrapped 
      in a napkin.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Use the napkin.  You don t want to 
                    touch food with that hand, where 
                    it s been.

      Wallace s hand withdraws with the chicken.  He takes a bite.  
      Evaluates.

                                    WALLACE
                    It s no Prince s.  But it ll do in 
                    a pinch.  Any shot at some of that 
                    Jim Beam?

                    Two cups aren t just for me.

      Raylan pours more bourbon into the two cups, hands a cup to 
      Wallace.

      Three cups click together.  Raylan, Art and Vasquez are 
      having a drink.  In the bullpen, Stevenson talks to ND TAC 
      GUYS as they head out.

      Stevenson shrugs, heads out.  Art, Raylan and Vasquez watch

                    I said I hoped the lawsuit against

                    I figured there s always some kind

      The room quiets.  Talk of lawsuits brings them back to why 
      they were supposed to get together.

                                  RAYLAN
                    When s our time-out up?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)              EPISODE 106 - "BLOWBACK" - GOLD REVISIONS - 1/08/10    38A.

                                    VASQUEZ
                    We don t have to do this today.

                                  ART
                    Not a bad idea.  Take a rain check. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    I d rather get it over with.

      Looks fly between Art and Raylan.  Art looks at him -- you re 
      sure?  Raylan nods.  Art nods to Vasquez.

                                    VASQUEZ
                    Okay.  Just have to grab my 
                      briefcase.

      Vasquez heads out to the bullpen.  

                                  ART
                    Well, I sure as hell owe you one.  
                    This had gone another way -- 
                    violent hostage stand-off inside a 
                    Marshals Office?  Let s just say it 
                    could ve been a real black eye. You 
                    managed to get us out of it so 
                    quietly I doubt it ll even make the 
                    papers.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    My sole purpose, my guiding 
                      principle, was to try to protect 
                    your reputation.  

                                  ART
                    And I appreciate it.  

      They see Vasquez heading back with his briefcase.

                                  ART (CONT D)
                    Remember -- no  what ifs,  no 
                     would haves. 

                                  RAYLAN
                    Just the facts, ma am.

      Vasquez enters Art s office, sets his briefcase down on the 
      desk.  He s much less jovial than he was moments ago.  

                                    VASQUEZ
                    You mind if I record?  Just for my 
                    own recollection; better than 
                    having someone take notes.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)              EPISODE 106 - "BLOWBACK" - GOLD REVISIONS - 1/08/10    38B.

      Off their nods/shrugs, Vasquez opens his briefcase, takes out 
      a digital audio recorder.

                                    VASQUEZ (CONT D)
                          (into the recorder)
                    Deputy Marshal Raylan Givens. 
                    Initial post-shooting interview. 
                    Also present, Chief Deputy Art 
                    Mullen.

      Vasquez again reaches into his briefcase, pulls out the 
      distinctive RED FOLDER we saw Bo Crowder s lawyer holding in 
      the Teaser. 

      Vasquez hesitates a second, gives Raylan an odd look, then he 
      fans out the contents of the folder onto Art s desk: PHOTOS 
      of Raylan and Ava together (and obviously together).

                                    VASQUEZ (CONT D)
                    Deputy Givens, how would you 
                      characterize your relationship with 
                    Ava Crowder?

      Off Raylan and Art--

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      Some time has passed.  The digital recorder s still running. 
      The photos of Raylan and Ava are still spread out across the 
      desk.  Raylan looks guilty and frustrated.  Art looks 
        disappointed and somehow older than we ve ever seen him.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (re: the photos)
                    Where did you get those?

                                    VASQUEZ
                    Does it matter?  

                                  RAYLAN
                    One of your  meetings  today happen 
                    to be with Bo Crowder and his 
                    lawyer? 
                          (off Vasquez s silence)
                    Whatever Ava and I have been doing 
                    together, you ve gotta know any 
                    jury is gonna take our word over 
                    Boyd s.

                          (re: the photos)
                    Do you honestly not see the story 
                    Boyd Crowder s attorney will put 
                    together from these?  The day 
                    before you ride back into town, Ms. 
                    Crowder decides to ventilate her 
                    husband with a hunting rifle.  Then 
                    a few days after that, she stands 
                    by -- holding a Marshals-Service 
                    shotgun, I believe -- while you 
                    shoot Boyd Crowder in the very same 
                    house, same room, same damn chair 
                    where his brother died.
                          (beat)
                    He ll strongly suggest you began 
                    your relationship before your 
                      reassignment. 
                          (takes a breath before he 
                            drops his bombshell)
                    Which is why we re going to have to 
                    release Boyd Crowder. 







                                                                              (CONTINUED)                EPISODE 106 - "BLOWBACK" - GOLD REVISIONS - 1/08/10    47.

      For a moment, Raylan is too stunned to move.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Release him?

                                    VASQUEZ
                    We have no evidence linking him to 
                    the bank robberies; the witness in 
                    the church bombing failed to 
                    identify him. 

                                  ART
                    Maybe one of his boys will flip on 
                    him for the banks.

                    Given the life expectancy of guys 
                    in the federal prison system who 
                    snitch on Aryan-underground 
                    leaders, I wouldn t hold my breath. 
                    Which means the only viable charges 
                    against Mr. Crowder would be for 
                    the kidnapping of Ms. Crowder and 
                    the attempted murder of a Federal 
                    officer, both of which are 
                      predicated on the testimony of Ms. 
                    Crowder and Deputy Givens.  Now 
                    that the two of them have been 
                      compromised as witnesses, who s to 
                    say Mr. Crowder was at his sister-
                    in-law s house that night for any 
                    reason other than to have dinner?

                                  RAYLAN
                    You must be kidding.

                                    VASQUEZ
                    I wish I was.

      The three of them sit in silence for a few seconds.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (to Vasquez, sounding 
                            defeated)
                    Chief Mullen didn t know anything 
                    about Ava and me.

                          (cutting him off)
                    He didn t know anything.  He warned 
                    me to stay clear of her.  I lied 
                    every time he asked me about her.

                                    VASQUEZ
                    Well, then, Chief Mullen will have 
                    to decide whether he wants to bring 
                      disciplinary action, call in your 
                    Internal Affairs.

                                  ART
                    So, what happens now?

                    What happens now is Boyd pleads to 
                    a minor gun charge, gets sentenced 
                    to time served, then he walks and 
                    we pray he doesn t decide to sue.

      Vasquez turns off the digital recorder, starts to pack up his 
      photos.

                                    VASQUEZ (CONT D)
                    Deputy Givens, my advice to you is 
                    to stay the hell away from him.  
                    And from Ms. Crowder.

      Vasquez gathers his belongings, heads for the door.  When 
      he s gone, Raylan and Art haven t moved.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Art--

      Art cuts him off, stands to go.

                    Do me a favor -- steer clear of me 
                    for a while.
