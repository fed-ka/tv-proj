      The dead, staring German, cooling in the back seat.

      Sarah, sickened, covers her with a car blanket.

      She swabs blood droplets off the front windshield with
      kleenex. Fumbles with bloody hands to swab down the seats.


      On Sarah, an abyss of horror just over her shoulder in the
      back seat.

      She fumbles out her own phone.


      ON FELIX, edgy, dry as toast, standing apart from -

      Sarah's wake. The motley mourners are getting despondently
      drunk in his studio. VIC, ROCKABILLY BOB, the random BIKERS
      and PUNKS. Everyone's attention is on SHERRY, mascara-
      streaked, sharing her pain with the group.

                                      SHERRY
                    Sarah always stuck up for me. Like
                    with guys. When guys were pigs? She
                    never backed down.

      "Pigs" was directed at Vic, who dangerously resents it.
      Rockabilly Bob sees this and defuses sagely.

                                      ROCKABILLY BOB
                    Freaks and punks and lost puppies.
                    We always had a friend in Sarah.

                                      SHERRY
                    Well she was an orphan herself, so.

      Felix just wants this to be over. His phone rings. Vic can't
      believe the rudeness.

                                    VIC
                    Turn your phone off for fuck's sake.                                                                                      5. 


                                      FELIX
                    Sorry.

      He checks THE CALLER ID: Sarah. He really wants to take the
      call, but can't.


      Sarah cusses as she gets Felix's voice mail.

                                      FELIX (O.S.)
                    Leave it for Felix.

                                      SARAH
                    Felix? Kira was at your stupid
                    memorial!
                          (chokes)
                    My daughter can't think I'm dead,
                    Fee.

      She hangs up in anguish. Another glance to the back seat -
      bloody hair, a hand poking out from under the blanket.


      Vic's emotionally volatile, choked up.

                                    VIC
                    I just... I cant...

      Bob puts a sympathetic hand on his shoulder.

                                      ROCKABILLY BOB
                    It's all right, Vic.

                                    VIC
                    I can't figure out why she would
                    kill herself. It's not her.

                                      ROCKABILLY BOB
                    We're ultimately opaque to one
                    another, man. That's the human
                      condition.

      Vic buries his face in the coffee table as if in anguish,
      but he's hoovering up a line of coke.

                                    VIC
                      Ahhhhrrrrggghh ... but she had love.

      Felix harrumphs his displeasure.

                                      FELIX
                    Who's love did she have? Yours?                                                                                      6. 


                                    VIC
                          (his excuse)
                    Love is imperfect. Love is
                      imperfection itself.

                                      FELIX
                    If that's your definition, no wonder
                    she jumped.

      Vic snaps, leaps up and grabs him by the throat, taking
      everyone by surprise.

                                      ROCKABILLY BOB
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa ... take it easy.

                                      SHERRY
                    Let him go, Vic, you dick!

      Felix and Vic, eye to eye.

                                    VIC
                    Go ahead and say it. Tell them it's
                    my fault.

                                      FELIX
                    It's ... your --

      Vic squeezes his throat harder, but Bob is there, gingerly
      prying him off.

                                      ROCKABILLY BOB
                    Vic, man, be cool. Everyone's raw,
                    it's okay. 

      Vic relents quickly and lets go, a cocaine mood swing.

                                    VIC
                    Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

      He opens his arms to Felix, cajoling him to hug it out.

                                    VIC (CONT'D)
                    Felix. Come on, my bad.

                                      SHERRY
                    Don't do it, Felix.

      Felix has no intention to.

                                      FELIX
                    I'm not a huggy griever, Vic ...

      He sidesteps him and plays to the others                                                                                      7. 


                                      FELIX (CONT'D)
                    But if this is going to be that kind
                    of wake, let's have some of that
                    blow!

      Everyone's relieved. He's urged to the table, handed a rolled
      up bill.


      Headlights through the trees. The Audi on a rough track,
      pulls off, casting light into the bush.

      A shovel breaks ground. A dirt pile grows beside a shallow
      hole. Sarah's breath rasps - with emotion, not the work.

      The Audi's interior light comes on as the rear door opens.
      Sarah grabs the body by the feet and pulls. It rolls off the
      seat and gets wedged. She has to grapple with it, face to
      face...

      Just as the mindfuck is all too much, the body comes free,
      hits the ground. Sarah drags it slowly to the grave, flops
      it beside the hole --

      And retches, the edge of puking, acid fear in her mouth. But
      she steels herself for the grisly task of ...

      Going through the German's pockets. She finds her wallet, a
      hotel keycard, spare change and crap. She checks her ID in
      the headlight glow. A German driver's license. The photo: a
      pasty, short-haired version of herself.

                                      SARAH
                    Katja Obinger ... Stuttgart? Who the
                    hell are you?

      Sarah looks at her again and softens. She overcomes her
      disgust, reaches down and closes Katja's eyes. Then she rolls
      her into the hole.

      Now she fights the horror of throwing dirt on her own corpse.

      A familiar, ominous ring - the pink phone. She freezes.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Shit.

      She fishes out the phone. Hangs on it. Tells herself ...

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Don't. Walk away.

      She turns off the phone. Throws a shovel full of dirt that
      covers the German's face for good.                                                                                      8. 



      Felix, finally ready for bed, pulls curtains over grimy
      windows to hide the dawn. He groans at a soft knocking on
      the door, drags himself back to open it.

                                      FELIX (O.S.)
                    Vic, I have a knife and I will stab
                    you in the face.

      He opens the door on Sarah and jumps out of his skin.

                                      FELIX (CONT'D)
                    Fuck! Aren't you supposed to wait
                    three days before rising?

      He turns away fuming, but lets her in. She's angry too.

                                      SARAH
                    What was Vic doing here?

                                      FELIX
                    Your wake. It was agony.                                                                                      10. 


                                      SARAH
                    Then why did you have one?

                                      FELIX
                    I'm sorry. I was mad at you. Why are
                    you back? I thought you were going
                    to let things settle down.

                                      SARAH
                          (nothing else matters)
                    Felix? Does Kira think I'm dead?

      Felix is sick over it too. He gives her a guilty shrug.

                                      FELIX
                    I don't know. Vic fucked everything
                    up when he phoned Mrs. S. But I don't
                    know what she told Kira

      Sarah's legs give out. She sits, head in hands.

                                      SARAH
                    Vic.

                                      FELIX
                    Since you died he's even more
                    obsessed. He wants to meet Kira.

                                      SARAH
                    No. 

                                      FELIX
                    Of course not. You think we'd let
                    that happen?
                          (notices something)
                    Sarah, what's...?

      There's blood on her sleeve. He sees more on her and gets
      totally creeped out.

                                      FELIX (CONT'D)
                    Oh my God. What happened?

      Sarah doesn't want to tell him too much.

                                      SARAH
                    Remember those birth certificates?
                    Beth's and two others?

                                      FELIX
                    Katja and Alison.

                                      SARAH
                    Well, I met the German.                                                                                      11. 


                                      FELIX
                    What? Was she ...
                          (his skin crawl)
                    A twin?  

                                      SARAH
                      I seriously cannot explain.

                                      FELIX
                    You had a robo-Mom. You're robo-spawn.

                                      SARAH
                    Stop. I can't answer those questions
                    so please don't ask them. I just
                    need your help with Kira.
                          (beat)
                    You have to tell Mrs. S I'm not dead.

                                      FELIX
                    No way. You fuckin' do it.

                                      SARAH
                    If I walk in there now, after ten
                    months? Think about how hard she can
                    make custody.

                                      FELIX
                    So I go in and say what?

                                      SARAH
                    That I faked my death to get away
                    from Vic. It's true. Felix, we can
                    still do this. We can still get
                    quietly out.

      Sarah kicks the bag she brought across the floor to him. 

                                      FELIX
                    Is that the money from your evil
                    twin?

                                      SARAH
                    150 thousand in cash.

      He kneels to open it.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Enough to lose Vic. Lose the twin
                    sister weirdness. Just somewhere
                    safe with my daughter. Is that so
                    much to ask?

                                      FELIX
                    Um. Maybe?                                                                                      12. 


      He's looking in the bag skeptically. Sarah's heart sinks.
      She reefs open the bag to see --

      No money. Nothing but a stack of police files. She picks
      something out with two fingers - a business card - holds it
      up for him to read.

                                      FELIX (CONT'D)
                    Detective Art Bell.

                                      SARAH
                    Beth's partner. Bastard must have 
                    followed me and taken the money.

      Her blood is rising, Felix is wary of an explosion.

                                      FELIX
                    Okay ... let's not go off.

      She snaps and hurls the bag at the wall with a roar. Files
      scatter. She starts punching things, unhinged.

      Felix knows better than to intervene. He puts on the kettle,
      waiting for her to wind down. But her destruction gets too
      close to a piece of his art.

                                      FELIX (CONT'D)
                    Not that! I'm working on that!

      Her tantrum veers to avoid the piece, then pulls up to a
      sudden halt.

      Something caught her attention amid the scattered files on
      the floor -- a CRIME SCENE PHOTO of a shooting victim, an
      Asian woman, 40's. Two in the chest, eyes staring.

      She picks it up incredulously, it's labelled...

                                      SARAH
                    Maggie Chen ...

                                      FELIX
                    Who?

                                      SARAH
                    Maggie Chen. This is the civilian
                    Beth shot.

      She quickly sorts through scattered paper, rebuilding the
      file. We see shards:  Crime scene diagrams. "Statement of
      Detective Art Bell", "Statement of Detective Beth Childs".                                                                                      13. 


                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    This is all of it, everything. Time
                    line. Ballistics. Art left it for
                    her. Look ...

      Sarah lays out the Maggie Chen photo. Beside it she puts a
      MUGSHOT of a felon: a different Asian female, roughly the
      same age. The ID board she's holding says "Xan Yip".

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Beth's shrink said she mistook her 
                    victim for a known felon.

                                      FELIX
                    That's her defense? They all look
                    the same?

      Another photo:  Close on the phone, clutched in the victims
      hand.

                                      SARAH
                    Thought her cel phone was a gun.

                                      FELIX
                    That is so fishy. With her 150
                    thousand stashed in a secret account
                    and her pill problem. This twin is
                    like the Bad Lieutenant.

                                      SARAH
                    Well her partner's more like Serpico
                    and he's got our money.

      Beth's phone rings. Sarah checks the ID and darkens.

                                      FELIX
                    Is that him?

      Off the phone in her hand, Sarah gives her head a shake. She
      really can't believe it.

                                      SARAH
                    I gotta be Beth again ...

                                        END ACT ONE                                                                                      14. 


                                          ACT TWO


      Sarah and Felix on pins and needles over the ringing phone.

                                      SARAH
                    I don't want to be Beth again.

                                      FELIX
                    Then don't answer it.

                                      SARAH
                    I have to.

                                      FELIX
                    Sarah it's not worth it --

      But Sarah hits 'talk', stepping into Beth's "skin" already
      pissed off.

                                      SARAH
                    What do you think you're doing?

                                                                                INTERCUT:


      Art at his desk, gloating as he adds sugar to his first shitty
      cup of coffee of the day.

                                    ART
                    How far'd you get? Buffalo? Or
                    Niagara. You stopped to check it
                    before you hit the border, right?

      Art opens a gym bag beneath his desk with his foot -- inside
      is a jumble of cash.

                                      SARAH
                    I'm downtown, Art. You got it all
                    wrong.

      She shoos Felix away - he's gawking at her chameleon switch.

                                    ART
                    I never get it all wrong, Beth, you
                    know that. But I'll give you a chance
                    to set me straight on a few things.
                    What do you say?

                                      SARAH
                    Bring me my money.

      Art scoffs at that. The conversation is over.                                                                                      15. 


                                    ART
                    Maybe I'll bring backup. Your place
                    in an hour.

      He hangs up on her. Beth "deflates" back to Sarah. She looks
      to Felix, drained by it all. He just shakes his head, awed
      by her performance.

                                      FELIX
                    Wow. You really missed your calling.


      Art has packed up and is leaving the office when he hears

                                      HARDCASTLE (O.S.)
                    Bell!

      He winces, turns to see

      Hardcastle at his desk in his office. With him is DESK
      SERGEANT GREAVES, who despises Art.


      Art steps to the doorway, doesn't come right in.

                                    ART
                      Lieutenant.

      Hardcastle just shrugs. It's obvious what he wants.

                                    ART (CONT'D)
                    Beth won't mess up again.

      Hardcastle looks to Greaves like he just proved a point.

                                      HARDCASTLE
                    See? Loyal to a fault. 
                          (back to Art)
                    Sergeant Greaves was betting you'd
                    throw her under the bus at this point.

                                    ART
                    Well he's wrong. The Board reconvenes
                    in two days, she'll be ready.

                                      SERGEANT GREAVES
                    Not if the head shrinker says she's
                    unfit for duty. 

                                    ART
                    The Shrink'll sign off.                                                                                      16. 


                                      HARDCASTLE
                    She better. If we don't get a "No
                    Fault" ruling, I.A. stays on her.
                    The department's open to civil suits.
                    This fuck up just hangs around.

      Art nods goodbye to them both.

                                    ART
                    I'll get her through, Lieutenant.

        Hardcastle's not so sure.


      To establish. The Audi pulls into the UNDERGROUND PARKING.


      Sarah gets off the elevator. She's cramming on her feet, 
      bag of files over her shoulder and one in her hands.

      She pulls up with her keys to the door, but hesitates and
      listens. Damn, someone's inside.

                                      SARAH
                    Shit, Paul ...

      The door opens, and he's standing right there, heading out
      for work.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Paul!

      She throws herself into a hug. He's dumbfounded.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    I'm so sorry I didn't call!


      She pushes past inside, making him follow, using the file in
      her hands as a prop. Paul's recovering and he's not happy.

                                      SARAH
                    I was at the station catching up on
                    this backlog.

                                    PAUL
                    You're under suspension.

                                      SARAH
                    So? They reconvened the hearing. I
                    need to get on top of this stuff!                                                                                      17. 


      He shakes his head at the ceiling, can't believe her.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    What? 

                                    PAUL
                    First, you fuck me wild for the first
                    time in months, then, you don't even
                    call to say you're out all night.

                                      SARAH
                    Sorry.

                                    PAUL
                          (end of his rope)
                    You know. I can see this shooting's
                    killing you. But you stopped talking
                    to me months ago, Beth. What am I
                    supposed to do? 

      Sarah's not used to decent guys. She really doesn't want to
      hurt him.

                                      SARAH
                    Paul, this is all my problem. You
                    don't have to take it on.

                                    PAUL
                    Well I have. It's been a long year.
                    And I can't keep waking up every
                    night to check your breathing because
                    your mixing meds and everything else.

      He picks up a bag by the door, she realizes he's not just
      leaving for work.

                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                    I'm going back to Cody's for a while.

      Sarah has a pang of losing him, but has to take the path of
      least resistance. 

                                      SARAH
                    If that's what you want.

      Paul just shakes his head and turns away. As soon as the
      door closes, she hangs her head.

      But she shakes it off. Checks her watch and the open file
      laid out before her:  Statement of Detective Elizabeth Childs.

      She flips open a notebook, begins jotting things down.                                                                                      18. 



      SEQUENCE: Beth at the table, files laid out. She's on Google
      Earth, building a picture of the shooting, her process
      rendered in abstract visual and audio detail ...                                                                                      19. 


      Her finger traces an intersection, following Beth's statement.
      New crime scene photographs. Chinatown. A courtyard of some
      kind. Diagrams of angles of fire. Another file labelled "New
      Town Jewelry Heist".  The rap sheet for "Xan Yip". The little
      notebook fills with Sarah's handwriting. She flips to a new
      page.

      ON SARAH in the medicine cabinet mirror. She opens it to
      reveal:  all Beth's pill bottles. She looks through the pills,
      making notes in the pad.

      The door BUZZES loudly. Sarah closes the cabinet and looks
      at herself in the mirror.

                                      SARAH
                    Okay, Beth ...


      ON ART: giving her 'The Stare'.

      The bag full of money sits between them.

                                      SARAH
                    It's not a payoff.

                                    ART
                    It's punching way above your paygrade.
                    And it sure looks hinky on the heels
                    of this shooting.

                                      SARAH
                    Well it's not a payoff.

                                    ART
                    Then where'd you get it?

      Sarah hangs, then goes all in with a Big Lie.

                                      SARAH
                    It's Paul's.

      Art stares. It has the ring of truth.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Paul's and mine. I cleaned out our
                    savings. He doesn't know yet.
                          (then)
                    Yes, I was leaving town. But I
                    couldn't go through with it, I turned
                    around.

                                    ART
                          (dripping sarcasm)
                    For Paul.                                                                                      20. 


                                      SARAH
                    To clear the shooting, Art. I'm not
                    dirty, I'm just freaked out. 

                                    ART
                    -- Jesus H. Christ --

                                      SARAH
                    But I swear. I'll clear this thing.
                    I won't screw you, Art. 

                                    ART
                          (re the money)
                    Not while I've got this, you won't.
                          (stands)
                    Let's go.

      Sarah has no idea where, but he's waiting.


      Mrs. S stares sourly at Felix across the kitchen table. Kira
      can be seen out the window, playing on the rope swing.

                                    MRS. S
                    I knew it was too good to be true.
                    Sarah's too tough to commit suicide.
                    Most feral mutt I ever took in.

      Felix shrugs, what can you do? She snaps.

                                    MRS. S (CONT'D)
                    Don't shrug. You're just enabling
                    the mayhem as usual.

                                      FELIX
                    Sorry. We staged a funeral to get
                    rid of Vic. You weren't supposed to
                    know.

                                    MRS. S
                    Why would you help with such a stupid
                    plan?

                                      FELIX
                          (weakly)
                    Vic's a dick.

                                    MRS. S
                    I know there's more to it, Felix.
                    There always is with her. Plagued
                    from birth, that child.

                                      FELIX
                    What do you mean by that?                                                                                      21. 


                                    MRS. S
                    Never you mind! Tell her she hasn't
                    seen her daughter in nearly a year
                    and I think it's best it stays that
                    way.

      Felix stands, martyrly, tired of being in the middle

                                      FELIX
                    Actually, I just came to make sure
                    Kira doesn't think her mother's dead.
                    Oh good, she doesn't. You and fucking
                    Sarah can work out the rest of it.


      A pressure cooker in the car. Art stoic, his intention opaque,
      dangerous. The city rolls by. Sarah's hands are shaking, she
      tries to hide them.

      Finally she sees they're entering CHINATOWN. They share a
      look.

                                      SARAH
                    This isn't necessary.

                                    ART
                    Last time you cracked under
                      questioning.

                                      SARAH
                    Actually, I cracked before and avoided
                      questioning.

                                    ART
                    Well you're gonna walk me through
                    the whole thing so it doesn't happen
                    again.

      He pulls the car over to the curb and puts it in park. Sarah
      shakes her head at him.

                                      SARAH
                    No.

      He's testing her. She points across the street.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    We parked North side, right over
                    there at Huron.

      Art's not even close to impressed. He drops the car in drive
      for a U-turn.                                                                                      22. 



      It's slow. BOBBY, 25, proprietor and Goth Mother, is reading
      a graphic novel behind the counter. A sparse crowd of SKETCHY
      DINERS. Felix alone at a booth in back, waiting.

      Sarah comes in, the strain obvious on her face. She strides
      straight for him. He holds his palms up, placating.

                                      FELIX
                    Kira's fine. You're not dead to your
                    daughter.

      A huge, debilitating rush of relief. Sarah falls into his
      arms.

                                      SARAH
                    I'm still just away?

                                      FELIX
                    I told her you're coming back for
                    her.

      They hold tight, a rare display of intimacy.

                                      SARAH
                    Thank you.

                                      FELIX
                    Just take me with you when you leave
                    again.

      She laughs through the emotion. Pulls herself together.

                                      SARAH
                    Soon. Art's holding the money. But
                    if I can clear Beth's shooting, I
                    think he'll give it back.

                                      FELIX
                    You mean clear her in front of a
                    police board? With like lawyers and
                    cross examination?

      Then, the ominous ring of the pink phone.

                                      SARAH
                    That's the least of my worries.

      Sarah takes it out of her pocket and puts it on the table
      between them. It rings on beneath their convo.                                                                                      27. 


                                      FELIX
                    That's Beth's other phone.
                          (she nods, a whisper)
                    Is it the German?

                                      SARAH
                      Definitely not the German.

                                      FELIX
                          (off her tone)
                    What's going on, Sarah?

                                      SARAH
                    You said this could be my story? If
                    it is, it's on the other end of that
                    line. Beth was investigating her
                    twins too. A Detective wanted to
                    know and I think it drove her to
                    suicide. So, do I pick up?

      Felix shakes his head madly. She smiles.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Really? I can't help myself.

                                      FELIX
                    Then why even ask.

      She hits 'talk', a finger to her lips because it's on speaker.

                                      SARAH
                    This is Beth.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Where have you been?

      Felix cringes and writhes at the sound of Sarah's voice.

                                      SARAH
                    Busy.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Did you go to the German's hotel?

                                      SARAH
                    No. Why?

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    You know where she's staying?

      Sarah gets the German's key card from her bag. Felix wants
      something from the bag too and they struggle over it.

                                      SARAH
                    Hotel Diplomat. Room 701.                                                                                      28. 


                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Pretend to be her. Go in and pack up
                      everything she has.

                                      SARAH
                    Uh. What am I looking for again?

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Answers, Beth.

                                      SARAH
                          (for real)
                    That would be nice.

                                      VOICE (V.O.)
                    I'll call back at two o'clock.

      The phone goes dead. Felix is flabbergasted.

                                      FELIX
                    Who is that?

                                      SARAH
                          (shrugs)
                    Every time I think I know something,
                    I'm wrong.

      Felix pulls what he wanted from her bag - the three birth
      certificates.

                                      FELIX
                    Beth, Katja ... and Alison Hendrix.
                    Is it her?

                                      SARAH
                    Felix, I don't know.

                                      FELIX
                    What happened to the German?

      Sarah's not going there. She takes his face in her hands and
      kisses him, time to go.

                                      SARAH
                    Thank you for helping with Kira.

                                      FELIX
                            (frustrated)
                    Sarah ...
                          (then softens)
                    Whatever, be careful.                                                                                      29. 



      Sarah enters, clocking the sleepy, faded art deco lobby. The
      front desk is empty. She makes for the elevator, hits the
      button.

      Just as the mousy DESK CLERK steps out of a back room, the
      elevator opens. He just spots Sarah ducking in.

                                    DESK CLERK
                    Oh! Miss Obinger --

      But the doors slide shut, saving her.

      A hefty HOTEL SECURITY CHIEF steps out of the back too.

                                      HOTEL SECURITY
                    Was that her?


      Sarah steps into a wide, threadbare corridor, silent except
      for the electrical buzz of dim sconces like runway lights
      down the walls.

      Rooms pass on either side - 708, 707, 706, 705 ... 701. She
      stares at the number plate. She slots the key card. A green
      light winks, she's in.


      It's dark, curtains drawn. She closes the door behind her.
      Her hand creeps along the wall, finds the switch ...

      The room is ransacked. Drawers turned out, cupboards dumped,
      possession scattered. A thin sheen of feathers everywhere.

      Sarah steps through the debris, picking it over visually.

      Her feet squelch on wet carpet. Sound of running water. She
      looks into ...                                                                                      30. 



      There are toiletries flung about. The sink is broken, dripping
      water. Sarah reaches in and turns off the tap.


      She turns back to the room, taking it in. She notices a
      bedside drawer, open a crack.

      Sarah eases open the drawer and flinches a little. 

      Laying on top of the Gideon's bible is a barbie doll. She
      lifts them both out. The doll's face looks like it's been
      burned with cigarettes. Hair hacked short, coloured red like
      the German.

      Sarah opens the bible. It's desecrated. Someone has maniacally
      circled passages, tearing through the pages. She tries to
      read a half destroyed passage.

                                      SARAH
                    "Your dead shall live, their bodies
                    shall rise ..."

      There's a knock at the door. Sarah freezes like a deer.
      Another knock.

                                    DESK CLERK (O.S.)
                    Miss Obinger?

                                                                                INTERCUT:


      He's there with Hotel Security at his shoulder. The Clerk is
      obsequious, afraid to offend his guest. Security is gung-ho,
      righteous, none too smart - but still a threat.

                                    DESK CLERK
                    Sorry, Miss Obinger are you in there?

                                      HOTEL SECURITY (O.S.)
                    Hotel security, Ma'am, please open
                    the door.

      Sarah grimaces, casts about for a plan.

      Security hammers on the door harder.

                                      HOTEL SECURITY (CONT'D)
                    Miss Obinger, I'm going to need you
                    to open the door.                                                                                      31. 


      The door opens a crack on the chain, just enough for them to
      see her.

                                    DESK CLERK
                    Sorry. Avery from the front desk?
                    Several of your neighbors reported a
                      disturbance?

                                      SARAH
                          (German accent)
                    A what?

                                      HOTEL SECURITY
                    Loud noise from your room, Ma'am.
                    May we check inside?

                                      SARAH
                    I just returned.
                          (appeals to Desk Clerk)
                    You saw me.

                                    DESK CLERK
                    The call was a little before that?
                    Sorry.

                                      HOTEL SECURITY
                    Ma'am, I have the option of calling
                    police.

                                    DESK CLERK
                    It's easiest if you just let us check
                    the room.

      Sarah closes the door.

                                      SARAH
                    Shit.

      But she'd rather deal with these two than cops. So she unhooks
      the chain and just throws open the door.

      The duo step in, jaws dropping.

                                      HOTEL SECURITY
                    Did you do this?

      She shrugs like she wrecks German hotel rooms all the time.

                                      SARAH
                    Rock and roll.

                                      HOTEL SECURITY
                    Rock and roll? What the heck is wrong
                    with you?                                                                                      32. 


                                    DESK CLERK
                    Oh, this is unfortunate ...

                                      SARAH
                    You have my card on file, ja?

                                    DESK CLERK
                    Yes.

                                      SARAH
                    So? I pay damages.

                                      HOTEL SECURITY
                    Stuff dumped everywhere ... water
                    damage ... the sink is broken.

      He comes across the weird Barbie doll beside the defaced
      bible, looks at Sarah appalled.

      Sarah gives him the rock and roll "devil horns".


      Security glares, arms folded. Other STAFF gathered, all eyes
      on the bad guest, Sarah, keeping up her Berlin rocker
      impression. The Desk Clerk processes payment.

                                    DESK CLERK
                    Six thousand, four hundred, thirty
                    seven dollars and eleven cents.

      Sarah shrugs. He runs it. Awkward silence as they wait for
      approval. It's broken by the printer spitting out a receipt.

                                    DESK CLERK (CONT'D)
                    Hm.

      Sarah hides her relief with nochalance. Spots -- some left
      luggage behind the desk, tagged and waiting for guests. She
      remembers --

      A LUGGAGE TAG in the German's wallet. She holds it out to
      the Security guy expectantly. He takes it, surly.

      An expensive, combination-locked metal briefcase lands on
      the desk before Sarah. She smiles.

                                      SARAH
                    Danke schoen.


      Sarah stabs buttons on the onboard navigator. The ROUTE MAP
      appears on screen. The helpful-sounding assistant pipes up.

                                    NAV ASSISTANT (V.O.)
                    Distance to - 251 Black Oak Drive,
                    Waterloo: 95 kilomet--

      Sarah hits a button, cutting it off.

                                      SARAH
                    Shuttup, I can read.


      Sarah pulls up down the street from 251. She shuts the engine
      off and eyes the house.                                                                                      35. 


      The blinds are drawn, no car in the drive. It looks just as
      sterile and deserted as the rest of the neighborhood.


      Sarah tails the SUV through traffic. Nothing can be seen
      through the rear windows.

      The SUV makes a left turn. Sarah holds up traffic to see the
      car broadside but still can't see the driver. She steps on
      the gas after it.

      Tailing again, the SUV's rear view almost offers a glimpse.

      Then the SUV is signaling, turning into an empty parking
      lot. Sarah drives past, watching as ...


      Sarah pulls up at a distance with a clear view.

      The SUV stops idling. Nothing happens. It just sits there
      looking ominous ...

                                                                                INTERCUT:


      No one in sight, Sarah slips in. Moves along the stalls.

      Under one of the stall doors, she glimpses the soccer cleats.

      She steps to the door. It's too silent. She reaches out,
      finds it unlocked, slowly swings it open on --

      The empty soccer cleats on the floor ...

      Suddenly Alison steps up behind Sarah, rams her against a
      wall in shock, eye to eye.

                                      ALISON
                    How dare you show your face around
                    my children!

                                      SARAH
                    Jesus ...                                                                                      38. 


                                      ALISON
                          (hisses)
                    How did you find me?

                                      SARAH
                    The German had your address.

                                      ALISON
                    Idiot. Do you even know who you're
                    talking to? Where is Beth?

                                      SARAH
                    Dead. She's dead.

      Alison steps off in shock.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry. She killed herself.

      Alison just paces, holding her head.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Look, I can explain. My name is Sarah --

                                      ALISON
                    I don't care.
                          (fumes)
                    Why Lord, why me? I never wanted any
                    part of this. Do I wear a huge kick
                    me sign on my back?

                                      SARAH
                    Please.  Just tell me: Who are we to
                    each other?

                                      ALISON
                    Are you kidding? I am not doing this.
                    This is not my responsibility ...
                          (forceful)
                    You need to get out of here, whoever
                    you are. Go and wait for a call.

      Alison turns to leave but Sarah catches her arm. She yanks
      away forcefully

                                      ALISON (CONT'D)
                    Let go! Wait for a call. And hide
                    your ugly face on the way out of
                    here.

      Alison pushes out of the washroom.

      Sarah reels, grabs a sink like an anchor to steady herself.
      She looks at herself in the mirror in shock.                                                                                      39. 


                                      SARAH
                    Well, that one's a bit of a bitch.


      Sarah scans the building, making sure there's no light on.

      But headlights flash in her eyes. A car screeches up beside
      her, window to window.

      It's Art, all business. He signals "roll down the window".
      She complies.

                                    ART
                    Get in.

      She gestures to the building like an excuse.

                                      SARAH
                    Art --

                                    ART
                    Paul's out. He's staying with a buddy.

                                      SARAH
                    You checking into my love life now?

                                    ART
                    Such as it is. Let's go. You need to
                    get through the shrink.

                                      SARAH
                    What?

                                    ART
                    The shrink.

                                      SARAH
                    The shrink.

                                    ART
                    Is this a two car echo chamber? She
                    has to declare you fit for duty, or
                    there is no hearing.

                                      SARAH
                    I know ...                                                                                      40. 


                                    ART
                    So let's go. The Lieutenant requested
                    she stay open late, so you're gonna
                    tell her whatever it is she needs to
                    hear.

      Sarah opens her door. She walks round to his passenger side
      reeling. Can't believe she has to go --

                                      SARAH
                    Back to the shrink?


      Dr. Bowers wears a skeptical expression. Sarah is on the hot
      seat.

                                      SARAH
                    I'm making progress. Full progress.

                                    DR. BOWERS
                    Really. How?

                                      SARAH
                    You know, with the guilt. Admitting
                    my mistake.

                                    DR. BOWERS
                    Good.

                                      SARAH
                    The best thing for me now is to get
                    back to work.

                                    DR. BOWERS
                    Last time I saw you, you couldn't
                    remember the shooting.
                          (from her notes)
                    "I'm missing myself. I glitched. A
                    break or something."

                                      SARAH
                    No, I remember it just fine. It's
                    all in my statement.

      Bowers puts down her notes and sits back, bracing her.

                                    DR. BOWERS
                    I'm sorry. But considering your mental
                    state in the months leading up to
                    the incident --

                                      SARAH
                    -- That's behind me now ---                                                                                      41. 


                                    DR. BOWERS
                    -- And by your own admission of  
                    blackout or psychotic break ... I
                    can't recommend you for duty.

      Beat. Sarah has to push back.

                                      SARAH
                    That's not going to work for me.

                                    DR. BOWERS
                      I understand, you're a cop. But this
                    is my job.

                                      SARAH
                    Can you read that back again? "I'm
                    missing myself ..."

      Dr. Bowers indulges her, refers back to her notes.

                                    DR. BOWERS
                    "I'm missing myself. I glitched, a
                    break or something."

                                      SARAH
                      "Glitched". Sounds stoned.

      Sarah pulls out her own notes, her cop pad.

                                    DR. BOWERS
                      "Glitched" sounds "stoned"?

                                      SARAH
                    Tweeked, gakked, spun ...

      Sarah flips through the pad, finds the notes she wrote in 
      Beth's bathroom.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Lexapro. Abilify. Xanax. Zyprexia
                    ... What's the difference between a
                    "mood stabilizer" and an anti-
                    psychotic again? 

      Bowers realizes where she's going with this.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    I've been confused. I mean it's very
                      confusing.
                          (off more notes)
                      Anti-depressants, anti-anxieties,
                    SSRI's. Aderol? That one's a
                      stimulant.                                                                                      42. 


                                    DR. BOWERS
                    Beth. We've known each a while now --

                                      SARAH
                    That's where you're wrong.

                                    DR. BOWERS
                    You have constantly tested me with
                    personal appeals for tranquilizers.

                                      SARAH
                    I know. My bad. So I'll just explain
                    to the board - that I shot this poor
                    civilian after mixing up all your
                      overlapping scrips.

      Bowers just stares at her, rooked.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Or am I making progress?


      The room settles. Across the table, Sarah faces the same 3
      Board Members: INTERNAL AFFAIRS, POLICE CAPTAIN, and a
      CIVILIAN woman in her 40's.

      Observing in the back:  Art, Hardcastle and Sgt. Greaves.

                                      POLICE CAPTAIN
                    All right, if everybody's here let's
                    see if we can do this again ...

                                      INTERNAL AFFAIRS
                    Board convenes in a fatal, line-of-
                    duty shooting, February 7th of this
                    year.                                                                                      43. 


                                      POLICE CAPTAIN
                    State your name and rank for the
                    record. And begin.

      Sarah clears her throat, all in.

                                      SARAH
                    Detective Elizabeth Childs ...

                                        END ACT FOUR                                                                                      44. 


                                            ACT FIVE


      The hearing is just over, people milling out. Art is already
      waiting. He watches from a distance as --

      Sarah emerges talking with her Lawyer, a positive vibe.

                                      LAWYER
                    You did well. We'll have a ruling in
                    a couple days.

      Art watches the Board Members emerge, Hardcastle shepherding
      them. As they pass, Hardcastle stops to shake Sarah's hand
      briefly, tacit approval.

                                      HARDCASTLE
                    Not bad, Childs.

      Off this, Sarah sees Art watching. She gives him a hopeful
      shrug. But then her smile drops. She reaches in her pocket
      and pulls out -- the pink phone, vibrating.

      Art's expression hardens as she indicates she'll be right
      back. She makes for the bathroom.


      Sarah steps in - to the same bathroom with the still-broken
      soap dispenser from the first Hearing.

      The phone vibrates insistently. She answers it, her own voice.

                                      SARAH
                    This is Sarah.

                                                                                INTERCUT:


      Alison is on speaker, in the middle of making some Mother
      Hubbard casserole. She's just as irked and angered by all of
      this as she was last encounter.

                                      ALISON (O.S.)
                    Well, Sarah, this will be quick.

                                      SARAH
                    Good.

                                      ALISON (O.S.)
                    Since you apparently know where I
                    live, and I can't get a sitter, come
                    here after 9 tonight.                                                                                      45. 


                                      SARAH
                    You're over an hour away --

                                      ALISON (O.S.)
                    It's not optional. Be discrete and
                    don't ring the doorbell.

      The line goes dead. Sarah growls.


      Sarah driving. Felix in the passenger seat, kvetching as the
      burbs roll past.

                                      FELIX
                    I never would have got in if you
                    said we were going to Waterlooser.
                    My skin breaks out as soon as I leave
                    downtown. Look: acne.

                                      SARAH
                    I don't see acne.

                                      FELIX
                    Am I blushing? Redness! Little
                    suburban stress zits emerging in
                    direct proximity to bad architecture.
                          (out the window)
                    Look at this travesty!

      In answer, Sarah pulls over.


      Felix looks around them like Sarah's lost her mind.

                                      FELIX
                    Keep moving. Someone might speak to
                    us.

                                      SARAH
                    Felix. I'll have the money in a couple
                    days. I'll make good with Mrs. S,
                    then we'll take Kira somewhere quiet.
                    Somewhere warm.

      Felix has noticed she's watching the house.

                                      FELIX
                    Yes, please, now what's in the house?

                                      SARAH
                    I won't be long.

                                      FELIX
                    Oh my God. Who's there?

                                      SARAH
                    Just stay here, okay?

                                      FELIX
                    The German?

                                      SARAH
                    Felix, the German's dead. This one's
                    an uptight soccer mom.

      Felix squeaks. She reaches for the door but he stops her.

                                      FELIX
                    You always do this to me!

                                      SARAH
                    I just need you to be my back up.

                                      FELIX
                    I don't do back up. How does one
                    "back up"?

                                      SARAH
                    Give me half an hour.

      She opens her door, he keeps holding her half in the car.

                                      FELIX
                    Then what? What am I supposed to do?                                                                                      48. 


                                      SARAH
                    Nothing. I just need someone to know
                    where I am.

                                      FELIX
                    That is not comforting!

      She closes the door on him. He cranes his neck after her.

                                                                                INTERCUT:


      It's dim. Sarah can't see much, but she hears -

                                      ALISON
                    Close it, lock it.

      She can see Alison now, just barely in the murk. She
      cautiously closes the door. Deadbolt clicks.

      The lights flip on and Alison steps quickly forward, seizes
      her by the scruff, puts a gun to her head.

                                      SARAH
                    Whoa! Really?

                                      ALISON
                            (loud-quiet)
                    SHUT-up. My kids are sleeping.

                                      SARAH
                    You're going to shoot me in the head
                    when your kids are sleeping?

      Alison presses the gun into her temple.                                                                                      49. 


                                      ALISON
                    You wake them up, or show your face,
                    yes, I will shoot you in the head.
                    It's one of the rules.

      Alison pushes her ahead down the hall, gun on her.

                                      ALISON (CONT'D)
                    Down the stairs.


      They come downstairs. Alison steers her down the hall.

      They pass doorways: A disastrous kids PLAYROOM, a SEWING
      ROOM.

                                      SARAH
                    Well I've never known a blood
                    relation, but so far I must say,
                    being your twin certainly fucking
                    sucks.

                                      ALISON
                    You really have no idea, do you?

      She's purposely scaring her. Indicates a doorway.

                                      ALISON (CONT'D)
                    Go ahead.

      Sarah gives her a hard look, then steps cautiously through.


      A big TV lounge, fireplace, walkout patio. Sarah gasps as 

      ANOTHER TWIN stands to greet her, a surprising new version.
      American. A geek girl, tattooed, intelligent demeanor.

                                      COSIMA
                    Hi.
                          (Sarah is dumbstruck)
                    I'm Cosima. We talked on the phone.

                                      SARAH
                    The phone ...

      She looks to Alison and back, freaking.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    How bloody many of us are there?

                                        END OF SHOW
