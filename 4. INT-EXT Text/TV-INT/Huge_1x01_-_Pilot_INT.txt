      Will, Becca, Amber, Caitlin, Chloe, and THREE OTHER GIRLS 
      enter the cabin. Their counselor POPPY (20, way too perky) 
      greets them.

                                  POPPY
                    Hi! I m Poppy. Welcome to the first 
                    day of the rest of your lives!So 
                    find the bunk with your name on it! 

    ON WILL AND AMBER: finding their shared bunk at the same 
      time. They try to be cordial.

                                  AMBER
                    You want the top?

                                  WILL
                    You can have it.

      Will puts her stuff on the bottom bunk. Amber gets on top and 
      takes out a folder of magazine cutouts of skinny models. Will 
      watches as Amber tapes up the pictures around her bunk. 

                                  POPPY
                    Okay, so the first thing we re 
                    gonnado is-- contraband check!

      Caitlin and Chloe groan--                                                                                    10.



                                  POPPY (CONT D)
                    I know, but we ll feel so good
                    after! 

      Poppy drags a trash can to the middle of the room.

                                  POPPY (CONT D)
                    I m gonnacome around and look 
                    through your bags. If you have 
                      anythingthat s not allowed, just 
                    throw it out now, no questions 
                    asked. That means any kind of food, 
                    even gum.

                                  CHLOE
                    What if it s sugar free?

                                  POPPY
                    Is it gum?

      Chloe sadly throws her gum in the trash.

                                  POPPY (CONT D)
                          (consulting a manual)
                    This also includes cigarettes, 
                    breath mints, lozenges, certain 
                    forms of lip gloss... 
                          (looks up, spots Amber)
                    What s that?

      AMBER has a toothpick in her mouth. Hastily removes it, as...  

                                  AMBER
                    Toothpick. 

                                  POPPY
                    Is it flavored? 

                                  WILL
                          (close to losing it)
                    It s wood! It s wood flavored.

      Troubled, Poppy consults her manual. Finally--

                                  POPPY
                    I guess it s alright. 

      Poppy goes bunk to bunk, inspecting luggage. Meanwhile-- 

      Amber runs out of tape, hops down from off her bunk and 
      crosses to Caitlin, who also tapes up decorations--

                                  AMBER
                    Hey, can I borrow some tape?                                                                                    11.



                                  CAITLIN
                    Go for it.

      Amber takes the tape, looks at the paper in Caitlin s hands: 
    a handwritten affirmation, decorated with doodles and 
      sparkles, that reads  BEAUTY COMES FROM WITHIN. 

                                  CAITLIN (CONT D)
                    I always bring this with me so it s 
                    the first thing I see when I wake 
                    up.

    She tapes it above her bunk.

                                  AMBER
                    That s cool.  

      Chloe moves past them, and almost bumps into Becca.

                                  BECCA
                    Sorry--

      Noticeable tension between them. Becca approaches Will--

                                  WILL
                    Hey.
                          (then)
                    What s wrong?

                                  BECCA
                    The girl behind me? She and I-- 
                          (Will starts to turn)
                    Don t look! She and I were really 
                    good friends last summer. Then she 
                    lost a bunch of weight and started 
                    hanging out with the popular girls. 

                                  WILL
                          (feels for her)
                    Uch--that makes me want to set 
                    someone on fire. 

      Becca notices the WALL OF MODELS. Will follows her gaze. 

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Don t look at them too long-- 
                    they ll take your soul.  
                          (Becca LAUGHS)
                    Don t laugh. These are her only 
                    friends.

      Amber returns to the bunk just in time to hear this. Tension.

                                  AMBER
                    They re thin-spiration.And you 
                    don t have to look at them.                                                                                    12.



                                  WILL
                    Actually, I do, because they re 
                    here and I have eyes. 

                                  AMBER
                    Well, you can decorate yourbunk 
                    how youwant.

      They glare at each other. Poppy pops in.

                                  POPPY
                    Hi! 
                          (toAmber)
                    Willamina?

                                  AMBER
                    She is.

                                  POPPY
                          (to Will)
                    Oh! Hi! Can you just open your 
                    suitcase for me?

      Will does, waits, impatient, as Poppy searches her bag.

                                  POPPY (CONT D)
                    What do you think of camp so far?

                                  WILL
                    It s really something.

      Poppy doesn t pick up on the sarcasm, continues to dig--

                                  POPPY
                    I totally have this shampoo!

                                  WILL
                    Mm.

      Suddenly Poppy stares into the bag, her face darkens.

                                  POPPY
                    Wait-- what s this?

    A FLICKER OF PANIC crosses Will s face. She swallows hard. 
      Poppy reaches in, pulls out-- cough drops.

                                  POPPY (CONT D)
                    Cough drops count as lozenges. Do 
                    you have a cough? You can totally 
                    go to the nurse!

                                  WILL
                          (relieved)
                    I m fine.                                                                                     13.



      Poppy tosses the cough drops. 

                                  POPPY
                      CongratsWillamina, you re clean!

                                  BECCA
                    She prefers Will.

                                  POPPY
                          (winks)
                    Got it!

      Poppy moves on. Will crouches down; the lid of her suitcase 
      blocks her from view. She unscrews her giant shampoo bottle 
    to REVEAL: IT S FULL OF M&Ms. She covertly pops one, smiles 
      like the cat that caught the canary.

    END OF ACT ONE

    ACT TWO:



      Will stares at a little menu sign labeled DINNER:

                                  WILL
                     Poulet  la Basquaisein rosemary-
                    basil glaze with steamed vegetable 
                    pate and whole wheat focaccia. 

    She looks down at the teeny portion of unidentifiable food on 
    her tray, unable to reconcile it with the description.

    ON DR. RAND at the head of the room. With her is JOE 
      SALZNIAK, 70s, curmudgeonly. Not slender.

                                  DR. RAND
                    Attention, new campers, I d like 
                    you to meet our resident chef, Joe 
                    Salzniak, who carefully plans and 
                    executes every meal.

      SEVERAL RETURNING CAMPERS HOOT:

                                  RETURNING CAMPERS
                    Whoo!!! Salty!!!

                                  DR. RAND
                    Chef Salzniakis dedicated to 
                    creating well balanced, low fat, 
                      sustainable nourishment.

                                  SALTY
                    No seconds.

    He shuffles back into the kitchen. 

      Will sits down at a table where the other girls from the 
      cabin are deep in conversation:

                                  CHLOE
                    My mom makes these incredible 
                    mashed potatoes with white cheddar 
                    and garlic... I miss those potatoes 
                    more than I miss her.

      Will tastes a bite of camp food, reacts with disgust, as...

                                  CAITLIN
                    Here s what I do: Cookie dough ice 
                    cream. Microwaved. Then peanut 
                    butter on top. And then, Captain 
                    Crunch. 

    A few of the girls MOAN.                                                                                     19.



                                  CHLOE
                    Ewww!

                                  CAITLIN
                    No, it s so good.

                                  ANOTHER CABIN GIRL 
                          (to Amber)
                    Okay, your fantasy meal. Go.

                                  AMBER
                    Honestly, this is it.

      Will SNORTS. Louder than she meant to.

                                  AMBER (CONT D)
                    Cause there s no guilt. Like, it 
                    doesn t taste good for real, but it 
                    tastes like, the sweetness of being 
                    thin later.

                                  WILL
                          (sotto to Becca)
                    That was deep.

                                  AMBER
                    I might actually skip my dessert.

                                  WILL
                    I ll take it.

                                  AMBER
                    You really think that s a good 
                    idea? 

    Oh snap!

                                  WILL
                      Absolutely. If I m gonnagain 
                    weight here I need to fully commit.

      Only Becca grins. Amber thrusts her dessert at Will--

                                  AMBER
                    Whatever.



    As Will exits, Caitlin grabs her--

                                  CAITLIN
                    Hey. I heard you re holding.

                                  WILL
                    What? What do you mean, I don t--                                                                                    20.



                                  CAITLIN
                    Relax. I don t want to bust you. I 
                    want to buy some. 

      This hadn t occurred to Will.

                                  WILL
                    Oh. 

                                  CAITLIN
                    Come on. Please? 

      WILL S FACE: She can t think of a reason not to.


      MONTAGE:

      WILL pours M&Msfrom a shampoo bottle into a plastic baggie, 
      then hands the baggieto Caitlin, for a wad of cash.



      Will waits impatiently for her turn at the sink while Amber 
      painstakingly blow-dries her hair in front of the mirror. 
      ANOTHER CABIN GIRL tugs Will s sleeve, she turns--

      CLOSE ON Will s hands: 

      -Opening a maxi pad box-- filled with snack cakes.

      -Pulling marshmallows from a bag of cotton balls.

      -Lifting the false bottom of her suitcase to reveal a 
      cornucopia of junk food: Chips, jerky, cheese whiz, etc.

      -Counting up her cash.



      Will and Becca giggle, Xerox unseen images from an ART BOOK.                                                                                    21.





      Campers practice Tae-bo moves on one another in a class: Will 
    and Becca next to Ian and Alistair. 

      IAN S POV: AMBER, a few yards away, practicing with Caitlin. 

      Distracted, Ian accidentally kicks Will. She playfully 
      retaliates.



      Amber is shocked and furious to find that the models in her 
      wall collage have been pasted over with voluptuous women from 
      classical paintings. She glares at Will and Becca, who barely  
      contain their giggles before totally losing it. 

      Amber snatches down the art pictures angrily--



      While the others sleep around her, Will munches a candy bar 
    in the bottom bunk. We pan up to AN IRRITATED AMBER in the 
    top bunk, wide awake, forced to listen to her CRUNCHING.



      Will faces down a stern Dr. Rand. Will tries to play it cool, 
    but she s a little intimidated in spite of herself.

                                  DR. RAND
                    Any idea why you re here, Will?

                                  WILL
                    Actually, I ve been thinking about 
                    it? And I prefer Willamina.

                                  DR. RAND
                          (tries not to strangle 
                          her)
                    We try to create a controlled 
                      environment here when it comes to 
                    food, Willamina.But there are 
                    always some campers who feel the 
                    rules don t apply to them. Who try 
                    to have their cake, and eat it. So 
                    to speak. 

                                  WILL
                    What kind of cake?

                                  DR. RAND
                    You tell me. 
                          (beat)
                    What if I were to say I had 
                    received a letter. From my Uncle 
                    Hershey?

                                  WILL
                    Who?

                                  DR. RAND
                    It s a code. A secret language for 
                    buying and selling contraband food.

                                  WILL
                    Okay...?

                                  DR. RAND
                    I ve heard some troubling rumors.  
                    Which is why we ll be performing 
                    random cabin checks throughout the 
                    week. Anyone caught with food will 
                    face serious consequences. I trust 
                    you understand that.

                                  WILL
                    Yes ma am.                                                                                    29.



                                  DR. RAND
                    I prefer Dr. Rand. 



      Trent and his posse are seated on the couch opposite the TV, 
      watch a football game. Nearby, Will and Becca play foosball.
      Becca watches the clock on the wall anxiously--

                                  WILL
                    So-- somebody ratted me out.  
                    Probably someone in our very cabin.

                                  BECCA
                    Who?

                                  WILL
                    I don t know. Yet. 

      Becca gives another anxious glance to the clock. 

                                  BECCA
                    It s almost on.

                                  WILL
                    Just ask them!

                                  BECCA
                    I can t-- they re already--

                                  WILL
                    It s easy, watch!

      Will strides over to the guys, who don t look up. 

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Uh, my friend is really into 
                      BattlestarGalactica, and it s on 
                    in like three minutes? 

      Will waits. The jocks glance at her, then at each other. 
      Before they can respond--

      Amber, Caitlin and Chloe enter. Caitlin leans flirtatiously 
    on one arm of the couch towards Trent. 

                                  CAITLIN
                    Hey-- are you like, watching this?

                                  TRENT
                    Uh, sorta.

                                  CAITLIN
                    Cause there s this thing? That we 
                    seriously need to watch?                                                                                    30.



                                  CHLOE
                    Yeah, it s serious.

    ON WILL: In disbelief. 

                                  WILL
                    Uh, excuse me? We were here first.  

                                  BECCA
                          (tugs her, uncomfortable)
                    It s fine, I ll just get my Mom to 
                    describe it to me... 

      Trent looks from Caitlin to Will, shrugs lamely:

                                  TRENT
                    Sorry.

      Trent hands the remote to Caitlin. The other guys make room 
    on the couch. Caitlin and Chloe sit down, but there s no room 
    for Amber. She stands there, awkward, until--  

                                  TRENT (CONT D)
                    Come here--!

    He pats his lap. Amber hesitates. Is he serious?

                                  TRENT (CONT D)
                    Come on, best seat in the house!

    As Caitlin clicks channels, Amber cautiously lowers herself 
      into Trent s lap, trying not to rest her full weight on him. 
    She looks at him covertly, checking to make sure he s okay. 
    He smiles. She starts to let herself enjoy this moment. 

      Will watches this, furious. Becca: Longingly. 

      Meanwhile, Caitlin finds what she s looking for:

    ON THE TV SCREEN: THE OPENING OF A REALITY SHOW. 

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    One beefy bachelor! Fifteen large 
                    and luscious ladies! All stuffed 
                    into one super sized villa! Who 
                    will find the love of their dreams-- 
                    and who will be sent packing?

    ON SCREEN: A MONTAGE OF SCENES FROM THIS FAT REALITY SHOW-- 
      plus size women sob, frolic in the surf, receive roses...

      CAITLIN AND CHLOE clutch each other in excitement. AMBER is 
      also riveted. Will watches this like it s a train wreck. 

                                  TRENT
                    What is this crap?                                                                                    31.



                                  CAITLIN
                    Shut up! 

    ON THE TV:

                                  NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    It all. Happens. NOW. On Love 
                    Handles.

    Ian and Alistair walk in, cross to Will and Becca. 

                                  IAN
                    Hey-- oh, my mom loves this show.

      Will closes her eyes in agony.  

    ON THE TV: A plus-size HOST addresses the contestants.

                                  HOST
                    There are twelve of you left. And 
                    the competition is about to heat up 
                    because tonight... your date... 
                    will take place... in a sauna. 

                                  ON SCREEN CONTESTANT (COCO)
                    When I heard the date would be in a 
                    sauna, I started to sweat.

    WE CONTINUE TO HEAR THE SHOW IN THE b.g.as--

                                  WILL
                    This is unwatchable.



      MORE CAMPERS are now gathered around the TV, totally absorbed 
    in the show. Will stands exactly where she was, watching.

    ON THE TV: An elaborate elimination ceremony.

                                  BACHELOR
                    There are eleven onion rings in 
                    this basket. When I call your name, 
                    please step forward. Shasta. 

      SHASTA steps forward. The Bachelor hands her an onion ring 
      with grave solemnity. She tears up. 

                                  TRENT
                    I can t believe he didn t pick 
                    Albany first. 

                                  AMBER
                    Wait.                                                                                      32.



      Ian, off to the side near Will, Becca and Alistair, can t 
      stop staring at Amber. Will notices this, as...

                                  BACHELOR (O.S.)
                    The next name I m going to call 
                    is... Albany.

    All REACT. Becca SQUEALS involuntarily. Will turns to her in 
      disgust. Ian watches as Trent high fives Amber.

                                  TRENT
                    You called it!  

      Will can t take anymore, stalks off.  



    All prepare for bed. Chloe, in pj s, reads aloud the table of 
      contents of a teen magazine while Caitlin paints her nails. 
      Amber studies her body in the mirror; turns sideways, sucks 
    in her stomach.

                                  CHLOE

                                  CAITLIN
                    That one. 

                                  AMBER
                    Do I look any thinner to you guys?  

                                  CAITLIN
                    I can t tell.

                                  CHLOE

                    do you reach for A) a thick eye 
                    crayon in bad girl black...

    ON WILL: Watching Amber tug at the waistband of her shorts.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    B) a dewy shimmer, hold the mascara 
                    or C) long false lashes, the wilder 
                    the better! 

      Will appears in the mirror behind Amber, staring her down.                                                                                     34.



                                  AMBER
                    What.

                                  WILL
                    You been talking about me?

                                  AMBER
                    No. 

      Caitlin and Chloe put down the magazine to watch this-- 

                                  WILL
                    Then why does Rand think I m 
                    selling food?

                                  AMBER
                    Uh, maybe  cause you are.

                                  WILL
                    Or maybe someonehas a problem with 
                    me. Which they should take up with 
                    me instead of tattling.

                                  AMBER
                    I didn t say anything. Get over 
                    yourself. I don t care what you do. 

      Will doesn t know whether to believe her. Neither do we. 
      Amber pointedly turns her attention back to the mirror. Will 
      retreats. 

                                  AMBER (CONT D)
                    I just feel like nothing s 
                    happening. 

    As Will watches Amber from afar, she gets an idea...



      Will takes wet clothes from the washer as Becca tapes up A 
      FLYER:  Interested in LARPing?  See Becca, cabin 4!! 

                                  BECCA
                    What exactly did Rand say to you?

                                  WILL
                    She wanted to buy some Mallomars
                    off me. There was like begging, and 
                    tears... it was sad, really.

      During the above, Trent walks by with a basket of clean 
      laundry, stops to read Becca s flyer. Becca lights up 
      expectantly. Trent exits. Crushed, Becca turns back to Will.                                                                                     35.



                                  BECCA
                    No, really, what happened? 

      Will shoves her wet clothes into a dryer, as--

                                  WILL
                    What do you think?  Troubling 
                    rumors, serious consequences... 
                    we re here to help...  

                                  BECCA
                    Well, but-- she is.

                                  WILL
                    Right. She s making money off us 
                    being here-- she s never gonnatell 
                    us we re fine the way we are!

      Becca squelches her real feelings, per usual. Will holds up a  
      pair of wet, pink shorts--

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                          (sing song)
                    Look what I stole! 

                                  BECCA
                    Are you sure this isn t too mean?

      Will ignores her, throws the shorts into the dryer-- and 
      turns the DIAL TO EXTRA HOT. 

                                  WILL
                    No, it ll be hilarious, just--

    She clams up as CAITLIN enters. She and Caitlin share a look.  



      Amber struggles to zip her shrunken pink shorts. Will lies on 
    her bunk, peeking at Amber covertly, a smug grin on her face. 
      Becca watches from her own bunk, worried. 



      Amber enters, upbeat, still wearing George s hoodie, to find

    THE OTHER GIRLS, crowded around an uncharacteristically 
      somber Poppy.                                                                                     42.



                                  CHLOE
                    What do you mean, what happened--

                                  POPPY
                    I m sorry, I m not supposed to 
                    discuss it. 

      Amber now sees: 

      CAITLIN S NOW EMPTY BUNK, stripped of its sheets. 

                                  AMBER
                    What s going on?

                                  CHLOE
                    Caitlin s gone. 

                                  AMBER
                    What?! Why?

                                  POPPY
                    Her mom came to get her.

                                  AMBER
                    Oh my God-- 

                                  POPPY
                    I m really not supposed to discuss 
                    details yet, Dr. Rand s coming by 
                    later, to talk to you. 

                                  AMBER
                    Wait, is she okay? What happened?

                                  CHLOE
                          (angry)
                    We have a right to know! 

                                  POPPY
                          (uneasy)
                    Yeah, she s okay. Um--I heard her 
                    throwing up.
                          (beat)
                    I thought maybe she was just sick, 
                    but then I found out-- she s done 
                    it before. I had to go to Dr. Rand. 

                                  WILL
                    So they kicked her out?

                                  POPPY
                    I know this is upsetting, but I 
                    think we should wait til Dr. Rand 
                    gets here. I ll see if she s in her 
                    office-- just stay here, okay?                                                                                    43.



      Poppy exits the cabin. The girls stand there, some sit down 
    on their bunks. The mood is somber. Will breaks the silence:

                                  WILL
                    I can t believe they kicked her 
                    out.

                                  AMBER
                    That s so screwed up! I thought 
                    this place was about helping us, 
                    they could have given her 
                    counseling or something!

                                  BECCA
                    It s a liability. If she hurt 
                    herself, her parents could sue the 
                    camp.

                                  CHLOE
                    So who told Poppy she d done it 
                    before?

    She glances at Becca.

                                  BECCA
                    Why are you looking at me?

                                  WILL
                    Wait, did everyone know she was--?

      AMBER S FACE: She knew. The other girls exchange glances.

                                  ONE CABIN GIRL
                    I didn t.

                                  ANOTHER CABIN GIRL
                    I thought maybe.
                          (beat)
                    You ever look at her fingers? Right 
                    here? That s where the teeth hit 
                    when you--

    She mimes putting her fingers in her mouth. 

                                  BECCA
                    We were in the same cabin last 
                    year, you kind of couldn t not 
                    know.

      Chloe turns on Becca:

                                  CHLOE
                    So did you tell on her?

                                  BECCA
                    No, but I m glad someone did!                                                                                    44.



                                  AMBER
                    Why?! 
                          (getting emotional)
                    So she gets kicked out?

      Will jumps to Becca s defense--

                                  WILL 
                          (to Amber)
                    Cause it s the right thing! At 
                    least she can get help now. 
                            (includingChloe)
                    Didn t you ever think you should 
                    say something? You re supposed to 
                    be her friends.

                                  CHLOE
                    I was beinga friend! You don t 
                    know anything. Home is the last 
                    place she should be.

                                  AMBER
                          (to Will, furious)
                    You re the one who gave her all 
                    that crapto eat. What did you 
                    think was going to happen?! 

      This is like a punch in the gut to Will. She doesn t know how 
    to respond. Amber turns to Chloe. Will stands there, facing 
      Amber s  thin-spiration  wall. She scrambles up Amber s bunk-- 
    and starts tearing the pictures down.

                                  AMBER (CONT D)
                    Hey!

                                  WILL
                    And you re the one who made her 
                    LOOK AT ALL THIS CRAP!

      Amber tries to pull Will down, punching her legs-- Will 
      tumbles to the floor, knocking Amber over. Becca GASPS. Chloe 
      tries to pull Will off of Amber. The other girls SHRIEKING-- 
      Poppy returns with Dr. Rand--

                                  POPPY
                    Oh no--!

                                  DR. RAND
                    Amber! Willamina!Stop this 
                    immediately!
                          (yanksthem apart)
                    Physical violence will notbe 
                    tolerated. 

      Will, shreds of thin-spiration still in her hands, rushes 
      into the bathroom. Becca follows her. Rand turns to Amber.                                                                                    45.



                                  DR. RAND (CONT D)
                    Alright-- what happened.

                                  AMBER
                    Nothing.



      Becca tries to put her arm around Will-- she shakes it off. 
      Becca s hurt. A beat.

                                  WILL
                    Do you know how to get to the main 
                    road from here?

                                  BECCA
                    What? Yeah, why?

                                  WILL
                    I m busting out of here. Tonight.

    END OF ACT 3. 

    ACT 4:



      Amber sleeps. We hear MUFFLED CRYING from OS. Amber cranes 
    her neck to see where it s coming from and sees the empty 
      bunk beneath her.



      Amber tiptoes in, following the sound of the crying, and 
      finds Becca on the floor.

                                  AMBER
                    Hey.

    She grabs a roll of toilet paper and offers Becca some. Becca 
      blows her nose.

                                  AMBER (CONT D)
                    What s wrong? 
                            (sensingit s related)
                    Where s Will?

                                  BECCA
                    She left.

                                  AMBER
                    Like, left left?

                                  BECCA
                    She s hitchikingto Montera.                                                                                    48.



                                  AMBER
                    To where? 
                          (Becca starts to explain)
                      Nevermind.I don t care.
                          (beat, can t leave)
                    That s a really stupid idea. 

      Amber reels. Sits down next to her.

                                  BECCA
                    And it s partly my fault. I told 
                    Rand about her stash. 
                          (offAmber s surprise)
                    I didn t want to get her in 
                    trouble, I just couldn t take 
                    having that stuff around anymore. 

                                  AMBER
                    Look, she hated it here. It s 
                    better that she s gone. 

                                  BECCA
                    I m a horrible friend.

                                  AMBER
                    No. I am. 
                          (beat)
                    I told on Caitlin. 

                                  BECCA
                    Oh. 

                                  AMBER
                    I didn t know they could kick you 
                    out for that. I m so stupid. 
                          (beat)
                    You can t tell anyone. 

                                  BECCA
                    Neither can you. 

      Amber nods. They sit there in silence.



      Will sits in a booth, orders from the WAITRESS--

                                  WILL
                    I ll have the disco fries. Extra 
                    gravy. And a chocolate shake.

    The Waitress goes off. Will pulls out her CD player, pops 
      Ian s CD in, puts in earbuds. We hear A MELANCHOLY SONGas 
    she looks around the diner, noticing the LONELY LOOKING 
      PEOPLE around her. All eating.                                                                                     49.



      Suddenly Will does a double take, yanks out her ear buds-- 

      WILL S POV: DR. RAND! In a booth, engrossed in a book and a 
      salad, across from Salty, equally engrossed in his chili and 
      newspaper. Salty glances up from the paper to Rand--   

                                  SALTY
                    That Beyonce--she s everywhere. 

      Will ducks behind her menu; peeks out at Rand, who doesn t 
    yet see her. Will starts to sneak towards the door. The 
      WAITRESS S VOICE rings out--

                                  WAITRESS
                    Where ya goin sweetie?

      Everyone (including Rand) looks up. Will freezes.

                                  WAITRESS (CONT D)
                    I got your fries here!

      Will stands there, no idea where to look.

                                  WAITRESS (CONT D)
                    You want them or not?

      Rand crosses briskly to Will.

                                  DR. RAND
                    She does. 

    She escorts Will back to her booth. The waitress sets down 
      Will s food. Rand sits down opposite Will. RAND S GAZE moves 
      from the shake and fries to-- Will s DUFFLE BAG. 

                                  DR. RAND (CONT D)
                    I d hoped that you d be able to 
                    take advantage of what we offer 
                    here. That you might face some 
                    personal issues, and grow.

                                  WILL
                    You mean shrink. 
                          (beat)
                    So- what happens now?

                                  DR. RAND
                    Well, I know your parents are in 
                    Europe for the summer-- there s a 
                    relative they mentioned-- 

                                  WILL
                          (can t look at her)
                    My uncle.                                                                                    50.



                                  DR. RAND
                    Right. I have his contact 
                    information. We ll call him as soon 
                    as we get back to camp. 
                          (beat)
                    It s funny, isn t it. The way--

    She breaks off, because SALTY is standing there. He puts 
      Rand s salad and her open book down, in front of her. Salty 
      looks briefly at Will, then--

                                  SALTY
                    I ll be in the truck. 

    He exits. Will glances into Rand s open book-- a line of 
      print jumps out at her: 

       Faith has to work twenty four hours a day in and through us, 
    or we perish.  

      Before she can read more Rand shuts the book, shoves it away.  
    A beat, then...

                                  WILL
                    You said something was funny--?

                                  DR. RAND
                    Oh. Yes. Well, the last train s 
                    come and gone; there s no bus 
                    service on Sundays. So you were 
                    probably planning to hitchhike. 
                    Which means-- you d rather risk 
                    your life than change it. Not so 
                    much funny as sad, really.
                          (chews, swallows)
                    Your fries are getting cold.

                                  WILL
                    I don t want them.

                                  DR. RAND
                    Go ahead-- you re not a camper 
                    anymore.  

                                  WILL
                    I m not eating them in front of 
                    you, okay!? And no, I don twant to 
                    change! Why should I? Just cause my 
                    parents are ashamed of how I look?!

      Silence. Dr. Rand stops eating. Looks hard at her. 

                                  DR. RAND
                    I should have realized this 
                    wouldn t work out. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    51.

                                  DR. RAND (CONT'D)
                    The campers who get something out 
                    of our program are here because 
                    they want to be. 
                          (beat)
                    Listen to me, Willamina--

                                  WILL
                    Will.

                                  DR. RAND
                          (almost smacks her, but--)
                    I know why you re running away, I 
                    know you re scared--

                                  WILL
                    I m not scared! I just think 
                    everything you stand for is crap.
                    No offense.

      Rand takes a moment, then turns to the waitress.

                                  DR. RAND
                    Check! 



      Everyone s asleep. Except Amber, rifling through Will s stuff 
      with a flashlight. She unscrews a shampoo bottle, turns it 
      over into her palm-- it s shampoo! Damn. Suddenly she hears 
    LOW VOICES from outside.



      Amber listening to this at the window. Then, she hears 
      footsteps, scurries back to bed. 



    As the other cabin girls CHATTER and finish breakfast, Will 
      captivates Becca with her story:

                                  WILL
                    So she refusesto call my uncle--
                    andshe s all like: What are you so 
                    afraid of, Willamina?Then she 
                    drags me back here, in this really 
                    gross truck. 

    ON AMBER: Listening in. Knowing the truth.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    I gotta give the woman credit for 
                    how committed she is to ruining my 
                    summer.

                                  BECCA
                    Well, to be selfish, I m glad 
                    you re back.

      Chloe glances across the table at Amber, who avoids her gaze. 
      Chloe offers an olive branch.                                                                                    53.



                                  CHLOE
                    Wow. Amber. 
                          (Amber turns to her, 
                            distrustful)
                    Your face really looks thinner. 

                                  AMBER
                          (lights up)
                    Really?

                                  CHLOE
                    Totally. 

      Amber and Chloe share a tentative smile. Will observes this.

                                  WILL
                    How about me? Do I look any fatter?

      Before they can respond, George appears at their table. 

                                  GEORGE
                    Uh, hi. 

    It takes Amber a few seconds to realize he s addressing her. 

                                  GEORGE (CONT D)
                    You wanna walk with me to the Life 
                    Saving Demonstration?

    The girls at the table: OMG!(Even Will, though she covers 
      it.) Amber can t speak. Chloe nudges her into saying:

                                  AMBER
                    Sure.

      Amber stands, exits with George. Becca stands, turns to Will.

                                  BECCA
                    Let s go. I wanna change my shoes 
                    before the Life Saving thing. 

                                  WILL
                    I ll meet you. There s some stuff I 
                    gotta do first.



      Girls get ready for bed, brush teeth, put in retainers, pop 
      prescription pills. Will, on her bunk, writes in her journal.

                                  WILL (V.O.)
                    So this is me. Actually trying. 
                    What have I got to lose? HA. It s 
                    not like my life can get any worse. 
                    I don t want to become a 
                      superficial weight obsessed freak, 
                    like-- some people. So what do I 
                    want to get out of this?  

      Will looks over at Amber, on Caitlin s old bunk, toothpick in 
      mouth, wearing George s hoodie.Sewing the shorts she split. 

                                  AMBER
                    These are never gonnalook right 
                    again. 

                                  WILL
                    Sorry. 
                          (Amber looks up)
                    I mean-- that sucks. I mean, it 
                      must vesucked. When it happened. 

                                  AMBER
                          (removes the toothpick)
                    Whatever. 
                            (can tresist saying)
                    George gave me his hoodie.

    She snuggles it around herself. After a beat--

                                  WILL
                    Got any more of those?

      Amber wordlessly hands Will a toothpick.  

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    I ve only been off sugar twenty 
                    four hours and I already feel like 
                    defacing public property.   
                          (hardto ask)
                    How do you do it? 

                                  AMBER
                    The first few days are the worst.

                                  WILL
                    And then it gets easier?                                                                                    57.



      Amber hesitates, not sure how to describe it.

                                  WILL (CONT D)
                    Great.

      Amber hands Will a whole pack of toothpicks.

                                  AMBER
                    Here. I ve got tons.

      Amber spots something peeking out from behind the bunk frame-- 
      pulls out Caitlin s now torn and dusty  BEAUTY COMES FROM 
      WITHIN  sign. Holds it in her hands.

                                  WILL
                    You miss her, huh.

                                  AMBER
                          (doesn t look at Will)
                    Yeah.

      Amber dusts off the sign, puts it among her things. 

                                  POPPY
                    Lights out ladies! Sleep tight! 

    The girls climb into their bunks. THE LIGHTS GO OUT. Amber 
    and Will lie in their bunks, in the dark. They whisper.

                                  AMBER
                    It s not that it gets easier... but 
                    you start wanting it.

                                  WILL
                    Iwon t.
                          (beat)
                    I m so damn hungry. That toothpick 
                    made it worse!

                                  AMBER
                          (not unkindly)
                    Shut up.

                                  WILL
                    I should have had that shake, when 
                    I had the chance. I had a double 
                    chocolate shake right there, in 
                    front of me. 

      Silence. Around them, girls are falling asleep. Amber seems 
    to be too. Until-- 

                                  AMBER
                    You mean, like extra large? Or 
                    double scoops of regular chocolate?                                                                                     58.



                                  WILL
                    Both. 

                                  CABIN GIRL
                          (calls out from her bunk)
                    Shush!

      Will and Amber go silent. Then... very quietly...

                                  WILL
                    The chocolate ice cream itself was 
                    like-- double.

                                  AMBER
                    Go to sleep. 

                                  WILL
                    Plus the chocolate syrup. 

                                  AMBER
                    I m not listening!

                                  WILL
                    I know.
                          (yawns, then, softly)
                    I ordered fries too. The curly 
                    kind.

    As Will snuggles into sleep, WE PULL BACK, UNTIL 

    WE CAN SEE THEIR LITTLE CABIN, IN THE WOODS.

      FADE OUT.

    THE END.
