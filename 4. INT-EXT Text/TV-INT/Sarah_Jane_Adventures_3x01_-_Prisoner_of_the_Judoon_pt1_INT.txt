                    No problem, Miss Smith.  Who wants*
                    to go home for the day when you're*
                    on the edge of something bigger
                    than the discovery of fire or
                    splitting the atom.

      Yorke smiles easily.  He's practiced that smile.

                    I know there are people worried
                    about nano-technology, Miss Smith. 
                    But people were scared of
                      electricity, of trains, of
                      telephones.  Science has always
                    scared people.*

      YORKE is leading SARAH JANE through a sparkling hi-tech*

      speaks - this is where the nanoforms are grown.

      But there's no time as the police car rolls to a stop. 
      Tybo levels the gun at the two COPS and holds out a plastic
