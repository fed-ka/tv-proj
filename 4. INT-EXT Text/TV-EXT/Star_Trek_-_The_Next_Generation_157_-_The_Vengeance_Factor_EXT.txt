     PICARD (V.O.) 
   Captain's log, Stardate 43562.9. 
   In an effort to put an end to the 
   Gatherer raids, we have come to 
   the Acamar System to enlist the 
   aid of Marouk, the sovereign of 
   Acamar Three. 
 
 
 leaving its orbit of Acamar Three. 
 
 
 Arriving in orbit around Gamma Hromi Two. 
 
 
 Riker, Worf, GEORDI, and Data MATERIALIZE in the midst 
 of a "junkyard" of high-tech equipment scattered about.

17   CONTINUED: 
 
 Worf scans the area with his tricorder as Geordi, Data 
 and Riker inspect the various piles of stuff. 
 
     GEORDI 
   Artonian lasers, Tonkian homing 
   beacons... quite a collection. 
 
 Data looks at a pile of scrap metal. 
 
     DATA 
   Noranium alloys. Their salvage 
   value is low. 
 
     RIKER 
   Looks like the Gatherers aren't 
   very discriminating in what they 
   steal. 
 
 Worf looks over the array, then announces with disgust: 
 
     WORF 
   The spoils of animals without 
   honor. 
 
 Worf lifts a tarp on another pile. 
 
     WORF (cont'd) 
   Commander. 
 
 Riker, Data, and Geordi step up to examine Worf's find 
 -- a small reactor. 
 
18   CLOSE ON WORF 
 
 frowning suddenly. He sniffs the air, then grabs 
 Riker, Data, and Geordi, pulls them to the ground -- 
 
     WORF 
   Ambush! 
 
19   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL) 
 
 as THREE GATHERERS (BRULL, TEMAREK, and one n.d.) -- 
 armed with phaser rifles -- pop out from behind a ridge 
 and take aim at the away team. (Like their Acamarian 
 cousins, the Gatherers are muscular humanoids with a 
 "primitive" appearance -- belied by their sophisticated 
 weapons.) They FIRE. 
 
 


                                                                                                                Converted to .pdf for pdfscreenplays.net    STAR TREK: "Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/9/89 - ACT ONE   14. 
 
20   ON RIKER, WORF, GEORDI, AND DATA (OPTICAL) 
 
 as a PHASER BLAST just misses them. 
 
21 WIDER (OPTICAL) 
 
 Data, Riker, and Geordi scramble behind some rocks as 
 Worf provides a BLAST of cover FIRE, then he too finds 
 cover. 
 
22   ON RIKER (OPTICAL) 
 
 his back against a rock, and phaser in hand. 
 
     DATA 
   Rigellian phaser rifles. Not very 
   powerful. 
 
 Another BLAST scorches the rock nearby. 
 
     RIKER 
   Powerful enough... 
 
         FADE OUT.

 FADE IN: 
 
 
 As before. The three Gatherers have positioned 
 themselves well -- Riker, Data, and Geordi are pinned 
 behind a cluster of equipment while Worf is behind 
 another. Riker yells to the Gatherers: 
 
     RIKER 
   We want to talk -- 
 
 A phaser BLAST from the Gatherers confirms they aren't 
 interested in chatter. 
 
24   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL) 
 
 as Worf moves closer to Riker, Data, and Geordi -- 
 his adroit maneuvering sparing him from a phaser HIT. 
 
     WORF 
   Your words are wasted, Commander. 
    (holding up his phaser) 
   They understand only this. 
 
     RIKER 
    (convincing himself as 
     well) 
   We're here to establish a 
   dialogue. 
 
 A phaser bolt STREAKS OVERHEAD. Then Riker has a 
 thought: 
 
24A  RIKER'S POV 
 
 of the pile of scrap metal Data looked at earlier. 
 
24B  ON RIKER 
 
 as he turns to Data. 
 
     RIKER 
   Data... noranium vaporizes at... ? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


                                                                                                                Converted to .pdf for pdfscreenplays.net

24B  CONTINUED: 
 
     DATA 
   Two thousand three hundred 
   fourteen degrees. Of course, 
   noranium carbide alloys vaporize 
   at a slightly higher temperature. 
 
 Riker indicates the pile of alloys -- Worf, Data, and 
 Geordi catch on. 
 
     GEORDI 
   Phaser setting seven ought to do 
   it... 
 
 Riker nods; all four adjust their phasers. 
 
25   ANOTHER ANGLE (OPTICAL) 
 
 as Riker, Data, Geordi, and Worf FIRE at the pile of 
 noranium. The noranium quickly bellows huge clouds of 
 SMOKE -- filling the area almost immediately. 
 
     RIKER 
   Now! 
 
25A  ANGLE 
 
 In a quick moment, Riker gives the others sotto voce 
 instructions, then using the smoke as cover, the four 
 make a break for it. 
 
26   ON THE GATHERERS (OPTICAL) 
 
 trying to peer through the smoke. We hear: 
 
     RIKER (O.S.) 
   Enterprise -- four to beam up! 
   Energize! 
 
 Brull, the Gatherer leader, sneers with contempt. 
 
     BRULL 
   Cowards. 
 
 Brull turns his attention to the rising smoke. He 
 grabs a bucket of sand and pours it on the noranium. 
 The two others Gatherers follow suit. After a beat, 
 the smoke ceases. 
 
 
 
 

                                                                                                                Converted to .pdf for pdfscreenplays.net   STAR TREK: "Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/11/89 - ACT TWO  17. 
 
27   ON BRULL 
 
 as he breathes a sigh of relief -- his precious loot 
 not completely lost. 
 
 As the smoke clears -- 
 
28   ANGLE ON RIKER, WORF, DATA, AND GEORDI 
 
 emerging from the smoke -- phasers aimed at Brull and 
 the two Gatherers. 
 
     WORF 
    (to Brull) 
   Your ambushes would be more 
   successful if you bathed more 
   often. 
 
 Brull GRUMBLES, but he knows there is nothing he or 
 his Gatherers can do. 
 
     RIKER 
   We've brought the sovereign of 
   Acamar... 
 
     BRULL 
    (surprised) 
   Marouk... here? 
 
     RIKER 
    (nods) 
   With an offer of amnesty. 
 
 Brull and the other two Gatherers are curious, but 
 suspicious.

 CLOSE on Yuta taking a sip of wine. WIDEN to reveal 
 Marouk, her bodyguard, Picard, Riker, Troi, Worf,

     MAROUK (O.S.) 
   Full dispensation will be extended 
   to all Gatherers who are willing 
   to return to Acamar Three. 
 
 After a beat, Yuta nods -- "it's okay" -- and hands the 
 chalice to Marouk, who drinks. Brull frowns 
 
     BRULL 
   You don't trust me. 
 
     MAROUK 
   Should I? 
 
 Marouk passes the chalice to Brull. 
 
     BRULL 
   Oh, but you expect me to trust 
   you. Perhaps you just poisoned 
   it yourself. 
 
 He gruffly hands the chalice to Temarek... all this 
 for show... 
 
     BRULL 
   Taste it. 
 
 Temarek looks and says who me? Brull finally grabs 
 his hair, and pours the wine down his throat, 
 laughs... Marouk is furious, insulted, standing, looks 
 to Picard... 
 
     MAROUK 
   Barbarians... this is futile... 
 
     PICARD 
   Sovereign... 
 
 Rising voices upon voices -- 
 
     BRULL 
    (standing) 
   Go home, old woman... 
 
     PICARD 
   Brull... 
 
     MAROUK

   hundred years.

     BRULL 
   You were there. You should know. 
 
     PICARD 
   Sit down. 
 
 They both stop and look at Picard. 
 
     PICARD 
   We are here to talk. 
 
     MAROUK 
   It is a waste of time, Captain... 
   they don't care how they live... 
 
     BRULL 
   And I am supposed to believe that 
   you do care how we live? 
 
     MAROUK 
   Yes. 
 
     PICARD 
   She is here, isn't she, Brull? 
 
     BRULL 
   Perhaps you forced her... 
 
     MAROUK 
   Nobody forces me anywhere, 
   Brull... nobody. 
 
 Brull looks at her, believes it, grins, sits down. 
 Picard looks at Marouk, she sits. 
 
     BRULL 
    (feigning disinterest) 
   What is there for us on Acamar 
   Three? 
 
     MAROUK 
   A life. A home. You can end your 
   wandering, your miserable 
   existence... 
 
     BRULL 
   Do I look miserable? 
 
 Marouk's first instinct is to go back at him... but 
 Picard looks her off. 
 
 

                                                                                                                Converted to .pdf for pdfscreenplays.net   STAR TREK: "Vengeance Factor" - REV. 10/11/89 - ACT TWO  20.

     MAROUK 
   The clan wars are over, Brull. 
   It is a past we are ashamed of. 
   It is why you had to leave. 
    (beat) 
   Now it is time to come home. 
 
 Brull thinks it over. Maybe it's a worthwhile offer. 
 But being a good poker player, he keeps a gruff face as 
 he commands: 
 
     BRULL 
   I want to talk privately with 
   Picard and Marouk. Everyone else 
   -- leave. 
 
 The other Gatherers get to their feet. Yuta and 
 Marouk's bodyguard look to Marouk. She nods to them -- 
 "go." Picard indicates to Riker, Worf, and Troi that 
 they should go, too. 
 
30A  NEW ANGLE 
 
 As everyone -- including Riker, Troi, and Worf -- leave 
 Picard, Marouk, and Brull to negotiate. Riker looks to 
 Troi: 
 
     RIKER 
   Any insights, Counselor? 
 
     TROI 
   Brull's ready to negotiate. He 
   wants privacy so he won't appear 
   weak in the presence of the other 
   Gatherers. 
 
 Riker nods agreement. They look back at Picard, 
 Marouk, and Brull in the b.g.

30B  ANOTHER ANGLE 
 
 A few yards away, Volnoth passes Yuta, taking a second 
 look at her, as if she's vaguely familiar. Yuta looks 
 calmly back at him. Volnoth walks off. 
 
 FOLLOW Yuta as she follows Volnoth. 
 
31   NEW ANGLE 
 
 as Yuta turns a corner, is out of sight of Riker and 
 the others. She continues walking until she comes 
 upon: 
 
32   ANGLE ON VOLNOTH 
 
 alone, warming his hands over a fire pit. 
 
     YUTA (O.S.) 
   You are of the clan Lornack. 
 
     VOLNOTH 
    (crossly) 
   So? 
 
 Volnoth looks up as Yuta steps into the firelight. He 
 scowls.

     YUTA (cont'd)

33   CLOSE ON VOLNOTH 
 
 as Yuta's fingertips come in contact with his skin. 
 It's a feather-light touch -- but Volnoth's suddenly

 nothing comes out but a desperate GASP.

 Volnoth stiffens in agony and dies.

 Picard, Brull and Marouk are standing. Riker returns 
 to the edge of the group, stands by awaiting orders 
 from Picard. 
 
     BRULL 
    (grudgingly) 
   Marouk's offer has value... 
   still, I'm not sure... 
 
 In the b.g., Yuta rejoins the bodyguard, Riker, Troi, 
 Worf, and the other Gatherers. 
 
     PICARD 
    (trying to pin him down) 
   But you agree it's worth 
   presenting to your leader. 
 
     BRULL 
    (more decisive) 
   Chorgan is a better judge of such 
   things... I will go to him... you 
   will hear from me in twenty days. 
 
     PICARD 
   Brull, in twenty days, I hope to 
   be... very far away from here. 
 
 That has a couple levels of meaning... 
 
     MAROUK 
   With all due respect, Brull, I 
   would like to make the offer to 
   Chorgan myself. 
 
 Brull grunts, well, maybe... Picard seizes it and 
 motions for Riker and the others to join him.

 Brull shrugs -- "why bother?"

    (to Temarek) 
   You found him?

   Yes. And there are no other

 Marouk looks helplessly to Picard -- how can you deal 
 with such barbarians? She walks away. Beverly 
 MATERIALIZES. Moves quickly to scan the body... Riker 
 has to push Temarak, who is stripping the corpse, out 
 of the way. She shakes her head.

   He's been dead too long.

   How? 
 
     BEVERLY 
   Cardiac arrest... 
 
 But there's a look, an edge to her voice... she stands 
 and Temerek goes back at the body... Riker moves with 
 out of earshot of the others... 
 
     RIKER 
   You don't sound convinced. 
 
     BEVERLY 
   No, it was a heart attack, all 
   right. But I can't figure out 
   what caused it. Cardiac muscle 
   is strong... no sign of arterial 
   occlusion...
