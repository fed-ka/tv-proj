      INT. PROFESSOR HIGGINS  OFFICE (DEAN S OFFICE) - DAY11

      CLOSE ON: a beautiful bouquet of flowers.  As the original 
      score to My Fair Lady plays, we PAN BACK to REVEAL: Professor 
      Higgins (AKA DEAN BERUBE) pacing in his book-lined study.  
      He s in his 50s, scholarly and proper. 

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                            (exaggerated elocution)
                    The rain.  In Spain.  Stays mainly in 
                    the plain.  Again?

      We see that the  student  perched on his couch is BLAIR as 
      Eliza Doolittle, dressed in drab street urchin garb. 

                                  BLAIR
                          (slightly Cockney)
                    The rain... in Spain... stays mainly 
                    in the plain?

      Higgins sighs, disappointed, provoking more Cockney:

                                  BLAIR (CONT D)
                    I m a straight-A student, I am!
                            (determined)
                    The rain in Spain...

      The door to Higgins  office opens, interrupting Blair.  
      SERENA glides in, in an elegant white dress, and perfectly:  

                                  SERENA
                    The rain in Spain stays mainly in the 
                    plain.

      She smiles her 1000 watt smile at the Dean, who is enchanted.

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    By George, I think she s got it!

                                  BLAIR
                          (excited)
                    I do?

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    No, she does.

      As the Dean takes SERENA s arm, Blair pounds the couch in 
        frustration, letting out a full-on Cockney SQUAWK worthy of 
      Audrey herself.  The squawk turns into BEEPING.    GOSSIP GIRL - Episode 206 - McNally & Safran - Double White   2.


      INT. WALDORF PENTHOUSE - BLAIR S BEDROOM - MORNING (D-1)22

      Blair sits up in bed, tugging off her satin sleep-mask, 
      fumbling for her alarm.  Her eyes dart to the LV luggage 
      packed and ready near the door.  She relaxes; just a dream.

                                   GOSSIP GIRL (V.O.)
                    Rise and shine, Early Birds, Gossip 
                    Girl here.  We all have dreams: some 
                    good, some bad, some fun and 
                    Freudian.  Some fade with the first 
                    sip of cafe au lait, some stay with 
                    you all day...

      Blair steps out of bed, catching a glimpse of a PHOTO of 
      herself and Serena on her dresser, and nonchalantly tosses 
      the sleep-mask over it, covering the image.

                                  GOSSIP GIRL (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    And some are the dreams you ve had 
                    your whole life.  

      As Blair puts on her Yale blue robe, DOROTA enters, carrying 
      a tray with breakfast and tea, morning newspapers under her 
      arm.  Blair opens her shades to let light in, cheery.

                                  DOROTA
                    Morning, Miss Blair.  Your mother 
                    already left for work but she was 
                    very specific about your breakfast.

                                  BLAIR
                    Dorota, can you believe in three 
                    small hours I ll be stepping through 
                    the gates of Yale?

      Dorota smiles at her as she puts down the tray and hands 
      Blair her morning papers -- NY Times, Observer, Post.  Blair 
      takes them to her desk, picking up a breakfast pastry with 
      her other hand.

                                  DOROTA
                    You used to sleep in your father s 
                      sweatshirt every night until it fell 
                    apart.

                                  BLAIR
                    I ll get a new one.  Right after I 
                    attend the Dean of Admissions  
                    private reception, of course.  Most 
                      candidates think it s an urban 
                    legend, but Daddy was invited when he 
                    first visited. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    GOSSIP GIRL - Episode 206 - McNally & Safran - Double White   3.

                                  DOROTA
                    Some Kombucha, Miss Blair?

                                  BLAIR
                    Since the Dean handpicks guests after 
                    their interviews, I m a shoo-in.  If 
                    there s one thing I know, it s that I 
                    give good interview.  I could make 
                    Larry King cry. 

                                  DOROTA
                    Just like we practiced.  I am so 
                    proud of you.

                                  BLAIR
                    And I m so ready to be surrounded by 
                    people who are more like me and less 
                    like --

      Blair looks down to see Serena s face smiling up at her from 
      a photo in Page Six.  She scowls.

                                  BLAIR (CONT D)
                    ... her.

                                  DOROTA
                    Miss Serena and you are still not 
                    speaking?

                                  BLAIR
                    Not a word in a week, but I can t 
                    escape her.  Since Mother s show, 
                    Manhattan has turned into 
                      Serenaville.  

                                  DOROTA
                    I heard Marc Jacobs named a purse 
                    after her. 

                                  BLAIR
                    I simply don t understand the 
                      fascination.  Fortunately, Yale is 
                    out of her reach.

      Blair emphatically sets down her teacup on Serena s face.  We 
      CUT TO:

      INT. VDW/BASS APARTMENT - SERENA S BEDROOM - MORNING (D-1)44

      CLOSE ON: THE PAGE SIX PHOTO. It s Serena, at an event with 
      Lily -- or half of Lily; she s been nearly cropped out. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)    GOSSIP GIRL - Episode 206 - McNally & Safran - Double White   3A.

        CONTINUED:44

      Serena regards the photo as LILY enters with two garment bags 
      and a letter.  Serena pushes the paper aside so Lily won t 
      see.

                                  SERENA
                    I m all packed and ready!  Aren t you 
                    excited, me at your alma mater?

                                  LILY
                          (re: letter)
                    So I guess that means you turned down 
                    this personal invitation to tour Yale 
                    this weekend...

                                  SERENA
                    Brown s always been my plan, like it 
                    was for you.

                                  LILY
                    And I loved it there, but if Yale had 
                    invited me, I would have said yes.  
                    The invitation is handwritten, 
                    Serena.  In cursive. 

                                  SERENA
                    Yale is for overachieving bookworms 
                    and preppies, the Blairs of the 
                    world.  And even though we re not 
                    exactly talking right now, there s no 
                    way I m going to step on that 
                    particular land mine.
                          (subject change)
                    On your way to lunch with the Ladies 
                    Who Lunch?

                                  LILY
                    Actually, it s brunch with the Ladies 
                    Who Lunch, which is almost the same 
                    except there s a lovely seafood 
                    frittata and a lot of hangovers.
                          (spotting page six:)
                    By the way, you don t have to hide 
                    it, that photo was all the talk this 
                    morning.

                                  SERENA
                    I m sorry they called you my 
                       unidentified friend. 

                                  LILY
                    I guess it s better than  Mother. 

      Lily unzips a garment bag.

                                  SERENA
                    What s in the bag?

      Inside the bag is a short, sexy dress.  Serena crosses over.

                                  LILY (CONT D)
                    Oh, my...  It s edgier than I 
                    expected, but I like it.

                                  SERENA
                    And it s apparently for me. 

      Serena points to a tag that reads  Serena van der Woodsen.   

                                  LILY
                    Then this one must be mine.  

      Lily unzips the bag labeled  Lily Bass.   Inside is an 
      elegant, sophisticated, yet much less-revealing dress. 
      Although she tries to cover, Lily feels outmoded. 

                                  DAN (O.S.)
                    What do you think of the color?

      INT. HUMPHREY LOFT - MORNING (D-1)55

      At the breakfast bar, waffles on the table, DAN holds out one 
      of his stories to RUFUS. 

                                  RUFUS
                    Of the paper?  It s white.

                                  DAN
                    It s not white, it s  soft ecru. 
                          (holds up another version)
                    This is white.  I like the ecru 
                    myself.  But I m not sure about this 
                    font --

      The paper looks the same to Rufus.  He pats Dan on the 
      shoulder.

                                  RUFUS
                    I used to get the same way before a 
                    big show.  But don t worry.  You ll 
                    be fine.  More than fine.

                          (a confession)
                    Maybe, but I just can t help thinking 
                    Yale is for Presidents, not 
                      Humphreys.

                                  RUFUS
                    And as the man who cursed you with 
                    the Humphrey moniker --

                                  DAN
                    I didn t say cursed, cursed would be 
                    cruel --

                                  RUFUS
                    I now feel compelled to give a 
                    speech: Daniel.  My son.  You have 
                      near-perfect grades, excellent SATs, 
                    more talent than money could ever buy-

                                  DAN
                    But --

                                  RUFUS
                    After that, you find a  but? 

                                  DAN
                    But what if it s not enough?

                                  RUFUS
                    If that s not enough, something s 
                    wrong with Yale, not you.

      As Dan slides his folder of stories into his beat-up 
      backpack, he looks at Jenny s closed bedroom door.

                                  DAN
                    I m kinda surprised Jenny didn t wake 
                    up to say goodbye...

      NATE is quiet as CHUCK tops off his flask at the bar and

                    Harvard s were obsessed with the

                    are among the best in the world.

      Both girls look away quickly. 

                                  HEADMASTER PRESCOTT

      As the speech finishes, Dan turns to leave.  Chuck and Nate

                    will actually appreciate my ability 
                    to write stories about damned and 
                    damaged characters such as yourself.

                    hello to all the other  characters

      EXT. CONSTANCE BILLARD - ENTRANCE - LATER (D-1)88

      Filing out from the courtyard toward a queue of waiting 
      limos, Blair and Serena find themselves face-to-face.  The 
      silence?  Deafening.  Serena breaks it.

                                  SERENA
                    So.  Off to Yale?

                    Your deductive reasoning skills are 
                    perfect for a place like Brown. 

                                  SERENA
                          (say what?)
                    A  place like Brown? 

                                  BLAIR
                    An enclave of trustafarians and the 
                    children of celebrities who major in 
                    drum circles and  semiotics,  
                    whatever that is.  I can t wait till 
                    you come home next Thanksgiving a

                    are the holy trinity: Harvard, Yale

      Blair has now officially managed to offend Serena.

                    This might be hard for you to 
                    believe, but not everyone wants to go 
                    to Yale, because not everyone wants 
                    to be Blair Waldorf.

                                  BLAIR
                    Not everyone can be.  Since we re not 
                    friends anymore, let me speak 
                    frankly.  You re not that smart, and 
                    you lack focus and discipline.  Charm 
                    is all well and good, but in the real 
                    world knowledge is power.  You d 
                    never make it past the first round of 
                      admissions at Yale, no matter how 
                    hard you tried.
                          (as Serena reels)
                    Have fun in Providence!  Maybe you 
                    can get your hair dreadlocked while 
                    you re there? 

      Blair walks off, leaving a seething Serena.  As her limo 
      DRIVER opens her door...

      Rufus is at the counter with a now-cold plate of waffles when 
      Jenny comes out of her room, showered and dressed.

                    After that shower there won t be any

                    I wasn t in there the whole time.  I 
                    was waiting for something.

      Rufus is confused.  Just then, VANESSA enters.

                    As soon as I smelled the caramelized 
                    bananas I knew it was a trap.  So I 
                    called in reinforcements.  Before you 
                    launch into school stuff, Vanessa and 
                    I have a pitch for you.

                    I m listening.

                                  JENNY
                    Did you know Vanessa s applying to 
                    NYU for next fall?

                                  VANESSA
                    I m really hoping to get into the 
                    Steinhardt School; I can study fine 
                    art and take film classes, and they 
                    have an amazing grad program.

                                  RUFUS
                    Until you re eighteen, what you want 
                    is trumped by what I want.

      It s a standoff.  Jenny looks to Vanessa, who nods, with:

                                    VANESSA
                    Plan B.

      Jenny tries logic in place of emotion:

                                  JENNY
                    Come to the atelier with me today?

                                  RUFUS
                    Come with you...?

                                  JENNY
                    I ll make you a deal: spend the day 
                    with me.  If at the end of that day 
                    you honestly think I should go back 
                    to Constance on Monday, I will.

                                  RUFUS
                    Jenny, I ve seen your designs and I 
                    heard about your internship all 
                    summer long.  What more is there?

                                  JENNY
                    Things are different now.

                    Sometimes doing things by the book 
                    isn t the only way.  You have to have 
                    an open mind.  In my humble opinion.

      As Rufus mulls it over...

                                  RUFUS
                    At least we ll be moving forward one 
                    way or another.  It s a deal. 

                                  JENNY
                    Really?  You mean it?

      Rufus realizes what this means to her.  And:

                                  RUFUS
                    You have my word.

      EXT. YALE - DAY - ESTABLISHING (D-1)1010

      Shots of the classic Gothic buildings; blazing fall foliage; 
      students with bookbags, headed for the library.  Dan runs 
      through the Quad, late somewhere.  We see him bound up the 
      steps of the administration building, and we CUT TO:

      INT. YALE - DEAN OF ADMISSIONS  OFFICE - DAY (D-1)1111

      Dan sits across from DEAN BERUBE (pronounced Barraby), whom 
      we saw in Blair s dream.  In real life, he s a far more 
      foreboding presence.

                                  DAN
                    To summarize, I really do think that 
                    I have something to say --

                                  DEAN BERUBE 
                    Well, by all means, say it.

                    class English department, Yale would 
                    be the ideal place for me to grow as 
                    a writer.  To flourish.  Thrive...?

                    Kudos to you and your inner

                    It seems you only have one letter of 
                      recommendation, from J.L. Hall.  Noah 
                    Shapiro declined to write on your 
                    behalf.

                                  DAN
                    Mr. Shapiro and I had... creative 
                      differences.  But if you look further 
                    down, you ll see I spent the summer 
                    interning for Jeremiah Harris...

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    A fact which Mr. Harris has not been 
                    able to confirm himself.  

      Dan is stunned.  He was counting on Harris at the very least.

                    Did you call early in the morning?  
                    Because he s not a morning person.  
                    He s not really an afternoon person 
                    either, but maybe we could try ag--

                    Mr. Humphrey.  Your academics are top-
                    notch and your enthusiasm infectious, 
                    so I d like to give you some advice: 
                      internships and recommendations are 
                    crucial for students who are applying 
                    for scholarship.  If you want your 
                      application to stand out, you need 
                    another letter, one about your work. 

                                  DAN
                    Another letter?  From whom?  And how?

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    This is Yale.  If you haven t 
                    noticed, we traffic in brick 
                    buildings full of professors.  I 
                    suggest you put on your walking shoes 
                    and start knocking?

      Off Dan -- under the gun.

      EXT. YALE - QUAD - DAY (D-1)1212

      Nate and Chuck are sitting in the picturesque quad.  Nate is 
      watching life pass him by, while Chuck could care less -- 
      he s resting with his hat over his face.

                    I thought we were going to do 
                    something.  What happened to your 
                    master plan?  Finding Skull & Bones?

                    Great.  So we just sit here?
                          (reads an itinerary)
                    There s a football game at one, and a 
                    tour of the University art gallery at 
                    three...

      A couple of YALE GUYS walk by with three SUPER-HOT GIRLS.

                    Or there s that. 

      As one of the girls, JORDAN, looks at Nate and smiles, he 
      gets up, with:

                                  NATE (CONT D)
                    Maybe this place does have more to 
                    offer than USC?  Good luck sitting on 
                    your ass.

      Nate takes off after the group.  As soon as he s gone, Chuck 
      stands.  Looks at his watch.  He starts to walk through the 
      campus.

      EXT. YALE - QUAD - CONTINUOUS (D-1)A12A12

      Chuck walks around a corner where he is immediately bumped 
      into by a GUY passing.  He s nearly knocks him over.  Winded 
    and off-balance, Chuck turns to confront him.

                                  CHUCK
                    What the hell...

      Another GUY throws a hood over Chuck s head.  As Chuck is 
      roughly dragged off by two SKULL AND BONES MEMBERS --

                                  SKULL AND BONES LEADER

      Blair waits on a chair outside the Dean s office, her game 
      face on.  LAUGHTER floats out from behind the closed door.

                          (locking eyes with Blair)
                    Looks like he s ready for you now.

    As Serena exits her interview, the Dean stands at the door.

                    I ve never been more prepared.

    But we don t believe her.  Off Blair, rattled beyond belief.

      INT. DARK ROOM - DAY (D-1)1414

    The hood is pulled from Chuck s head.  He s in a pitch-black 
      room.  Six SKULL AND BONES MEMBERS surround him.  One shines 
      a flashlight in Chuck s face -- he is the LEADER.  When he 
      speaks, his measured tone is menacing.

                                  NATE (CONT D)
                    Is Dan.  Dan Humphrey.

      Jordan stands and grabs Nate s hands, pulling him up. CUT TO:

      INT. DEAN OF ADMISSIONS  OFFICE - DAY (D-1)1616

      Blair sits across from the Dean.  We can tell she s nervous. 
      The Dean is looking over her application packet; WE SEE her 
      rather long essay typed on Blair Waldorf stationery.

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    I have to say, your application is 
                    most impressive Miss Waldorf.  
                    There s just one thing I d like to 
                    know.  Tell me something about you 
                    that isn t in this packet.

                                  BLAIR
                    What do you mean, not in there?  

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    Do you like to drive racecars?  Can 
                    you cook authentic Szechuan?

                    The young lady before you told me a 
                      delightful story; she was recently in 
                    a fashion show, just for fun!

                                  BLAIR
                    I know I must seem rather traditional 
                    compared to that  young lady,  but 
                    isn t tradition what Yale is all 
                    about?

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    Well, yes, but we ve been trying to 
                    change that image.  Too stuffy.  So?

                                  BLAIR
                          (slowly unravelling)
                    Well I m aware I lack some people s 
                    easy grace with strangers, and I 
                    don t exactly make you feel like 
                    you ve known me forever even though 
                    we just met.  When I laugh you might 
                    not smile just at the coquettish 
                    sound of it.  And I may not be 
                       spontaneous  and  delightful  and 
                     full of surprises,  and my hair 
                    might not sparkle when it catches the 
                    light --
                          (catching herself:)
                      Everything worth knowing about me is 
                    in that envelope.  I made sure of it.

      After a small but very awkward pause, the Dean stands.  

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    Well, then.  Thank you, Miss Waldorf.

                                  BLAIR
                          (hinting)
                    Isn t there anything else you d like 
                    to ask me?  Perhaps what my plans are 
                    for this evening?  

                                  DEAN BERUBE
                    There s so much to do on campus, I m 
                    sure you ll find something.

      Not exactly the invitation Blair was angling for.  The Dean 
      crosses to the door and opens it, extends his hand to Blair. 

                                  BLAIR
                    It was so nice to meet you.

      She takes his hand but instead of shaking it -- she kisses 
      the Dean on the cheek.  The Dean pulls away, aghast.  He 
      ducks into his office, shutting the door.  Blair realizes how 
      inappropriate she was, and how badly her interview went.

      EXT. ADMISSIONS BUILDING - DAY (D-1)1717

      Blair comes out of the Admissions Building with a head of 
      steam, only to see: Serena, standing by a table manned by 
      COLLEGE STUDENTS.  They have given her a course catalogue and 
      she s paging through it, looking at things they recommend to 
      her.  Blair crosses to her, hot. 

                                  BLAIR
                    What are you doing, Serena?

                                  SERENA
                    These lovely people are just showing 
                    me the course --

                                  BLAIR
                    No, here.  Yale.  Yale is mine.

      Serena knows where this is going, and:

                                  SERENA
                    While I ll admit I came to punish you 
                    for what you said to me this 
                      morning...

                                  BLAIR
                    Fine.  Consider me punished.  You can 
                    go home now.

                                  SERENA
                      I actually like it here.  Everyone s 
                    so nice, the campus is beautiful, and 
                    do you know how great the Drama 
                    School is? 

                                  BLAIR
                    Of course I know, it s world 
                    renowned! 

                                  SERENA
                    The Dean really made me realize that 
                    by being so set on Brown I closed 
                    myself off to all other options.
                          (off Blair s disgust)
                    Maybe you were right.  Maybe it s 
                    time I focus.






                                                                              (CONTINUED)  GOSSIP GIRL - Episode 206 - McNally & Safran - Double White   20A-

                    While that s a lovely epiphany, I m 
                    afraid it s irrelevant.  It s not as 
                    if you re actually going to get in 
                    here. 

      That s when Serena s phone rings.  Answering --

                                  SERENA
                    Hello?  An intimate gathering at the 
                    Dean s house tonight?  I d be 
                    honored.  Yes, that s my e-mail 
                    address, I ll look out for it.  Bye.

      Blair s face falls.  Serena hangs up.

                                  BLAIR
                    You got invited to my gathering?

                                  SERENA
                    You should make other plans.  She 
                    said I was her last call.

      Blair can t hide her vulnerability.  Her mood darkens.

                                  BLAIR
                    Of all the things-- Nate, my mom, the 
                    girls at school -- you wouldn t take 
                    this away from me.  Because if you 
                    do, I swear I will take you down.

                                  SERENA
                    I m not taking anything from you, B.  
                    I was invited.  And as for taking me 
                    down?
                          (newly confident)
                    I d love to see you try.

      INT. ELEANOR WALDORF DESIGNS ATELIER - DAY (D-1)A17A17

    The atelier is busy.  Jenny seems in the center of it as 
      Laurel s ASSISTANT comes up to her.

                                  ASSISTANT
                    Did you look over the resort samples?  
                    Eleanor wanted your opinion --

                    I ll check them out right now.

    As Jenny walks, she passes Rufus, sitting at her workstation.  
    He smiles at her, proud.  As she exits, Rufus sees Eleanor at 
    her desk.  He stands and crosses to her.

                                  ELEANOR
                    I didn t realize it was  Bring Your

                    Yes, well, it was Jenny s idea to 
                    show me why this is so important to 
                    her.  Do you have a moment?

                                  ELEANOR
                    Just.

                                  RUFUS
                    I gave Jenny my word about something 
                    this morning but I m not sure I can 
                    keep it.  I need your help.

                                  ELEANOR
                    What can I do for you?

                                  RUFUS
                    Fire her.

                                  ELEANOR
                    I ll do no such thing.  Fashion is a 
                    young person s career, and this is 
                    Jenny s moment.

                      Opportunity can wait till she s

                                    ELEANOR
                    Do you remember the dreams you had 
                    when you were fifteen, Mr. Humphrey?  
                    What if they all started to come 
                    true?  Would you have told them to 
                    wait?

      Eleanor s question sinks in as Rufus looks at Jenny.

      INT. JORDAN S DORM ROOM - DAY (D-1)1818

      Nate and Jordan are entwined on her bed.  Clothes are about 
      to be shed.  There s a copy of  Love In The Time Of Cholera  
      on the bedside table.  Jordan sees it.

                                  JORDAN
                    Okay, before we go any further, I 
                    have to know something.  And tell the 
                    truth.  As a writer, what do you 
                    think of M rquez?

                                  NATE

                    You re right, too broad.  Let s just 
                    talk  Cholera? 

      Nate can t bluff his way out of this one, so he jokes.

                    hoping you might help me... 
                          (seeing him)
                    Nate?

                    Help you what?

                                  DAN
                    Isn t that Nate Archibald?

                                  JORDAN
                          (confused)
                    No, that s Dan Humphrey.

      Nate shakes his head, caught.  Dan stares at him.  WTF?  
      Jordan gets that something is up, looks at them both.

      Chuck is on his phone when he sees Serena walking across the 
      Quad.  As he approaches her, he finishes his phone call:

                    Make sure they re up for anything?   
                    This crowd might get... particular.   
                          (hangs up, to Serena)
                    I know you re not a geography whiz, 
                    but you are aware that Providence is 
                    in Rhode Island?

                                  SERENA
                    I don t have time to explain.  I ve 
                    been invited to the Dean s house 
                    tonight, and I need to get ready.

                                  CHUCK
                    The Dean s house?  Nice.  What s your

                                  SERENA
                     Yes? 

                                  CHUCK
                    No.   What person, real or imagined, 
                    living or dead, would you most like 
                    to have dinner with?  
                          (off her look)
                      Apparently the Dean asks invitees 
                    over hors d oeuvres.  The rumor is if  
                    your answer impresses enough, you get 
                    on the shortlist for early admission.  
                    Or so says Blair.

                          (oh god...)
                      I should ve just given my spot to her.

                    You re lucky to be alive.

                    dressed like a man and is apparently 
                    the Dean s favorite writer.  And I 
                    know because talking to Blair about 
                    how she s going to get into Yale gets

                    haunt me for the rest of my life.  

    As she runs off, Chuck watches after her, smiling. 

      INT. DEAN OF ADMISSIONS  OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY (D-1)2020

      Blair marches into the office on a mission.  She smiles 
      sweetly at Shirley, and then, point blank:

                                  BLAIR

      Dan and Nate exit the building, Nate buttoning his shirt.  
      They ve been kicked out by Jordan and they re equally upset.

      INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT (N-1)2323

      Chuck enters the room where seven Skull and Bones members 
      (including the Leader, SKULL and BONES) wait for him.  

                                  CHUCK
                    Your party has arrived.

      Entering behind him are THREE MASKED WOMEN.  The women are 
      gorgeous, mysterious and a little scary.  They drop their 
      capes, revealing very scant lingerie underneath. 

                                  CHUCK (CONT D)
                    Straight from... well, I can t tell 
                    you where they re from, actually.  
                    But they re the best that money can 
                    buy -- with knowledge that isn t even 
                    on the internet yet.  Before you ask, 
                    they don t speak English.

      One of the women goes over to the LEADER, and sits on his 
      lap, and starts kissing him, hard.  Chuck smiles.

                                  CHUCK (CONT D)
                    And they don t care.  By the way -- 
                          (turning to SKULL and 
                            BONES)
                    -- that s not one for each of you.  
                    They do their best work in threes.

      The other two women cross to Leader.  One bites his ear.  The 
      other pulls his tie tight around his neck.  He can barely 
      speak.  

                                  SKULL AND BONES LEADER
                    Not bad, Bass.

      He dismisses the girls for the moment, turns to Chuck.

                                  SKULL AND BONES LEADER (CONT D)
                    But you re not done.  Sure, the girls 
                    are all right, but they re just... 
                    girls.  You still need to prove your 
                    loyalty.  Show us the coldness of 
                    your soul.

                                  CHUCK
                      Archibald s not worth your time.

                    We think he is.  Pull him in, take

                    Please, there are so many things one 
                    could do in an hour, why waste your 
                    time pranking a kid like Nate?

                    My family lost our compound in

                    fund.

      INT. DEAN S HOUSE - NIGHT (N-1)A24A24

    The private reception has begun in the Dean s house, a lovely 
      Colonial on campus.  A fire in the fireplace, classical 
      music.  APPLICANTS mix among two dozen FACULTY MEMBERS. We 
      find Serena, looking lovely, standing over a table.  She 
      clutches an index card in one hand and a pen in another.  

                                  BLAIR (O.S.)
                    Trying to come up with an answer for 
                    the Dean s parlor game?  

      Serena looks up to see Blair standing next to her, a big 
      smile on her face.  Blair folds her index card in half and 
      slips it into a hat.  Serena reacts -- she should have known.

                                  SERENA
                    You manipulated your way in here.

                    I get what I want, Serena.  Just like 
                    I m going to win tonight.  What s 
                    your answer?  Wait, no: let me guess,  
                    Lauren Conrad?  

      Serena boils.  If that s how she s going to play it:

                    heard the Dean asks his question in

                    comes before  W,  it seems like the 
                    answer is all mine.

      Serena s pleased, tucks her card into the hat and turns away, 
      victorious.  We hold on Blair, stunned, as she glances back, 
      nervously, to the hat...  GOSSIP GIRL - Episode 206 - McNally & Safran - Double White   31A.


      INT. DEAN S HOUSE - LATER (N-1)2525

      Serena stands with a FACULTY MEMBER and his WIFE, charming 
      the pants off them -- in French.

      Suddenly, there is Blair, taking the orange slice off of 
      Serena s glass of sparkling water and eating it.

                                  BLAIR
                    Actually, it s  vous,  as a sign of 
                    respect.  I m sure that s why you 
                    don t know it very well.

                    you; you were my father s favorite 
                    teacher.  You inspired his 
                      expatriation to France.  Shall we?

      ROUND TWO: Blair stands with a stuffy HISTORY PROFESSOR.

                    Although I love Henry the eighth, I 
                    prefer Sir Thomas Moore.  I think it 
                    was great that Pope Benedict 
                    canonized him when he did --

      And there is Serena, right there depositing her dirty 
      cocktail napkin in Blair s outstretched hand with:

                    Quite right, Miss... van der Woodsen,

      As Serena smiles, the Professor smiles back and moves off.  
      Blair turns to Serena, trying not to let Serena get to her.

                                  BLAIR
                    How do you even know that, you slept 
                    through history last year.

                                  SERENA
                    I love  The Tudors.   Henry Cavill is 
                    a total babe.  You re pretty calm for 
                    someone who no longer has the perfect 
                    answer to the Dean s question.

                                  BLAIR
                    You don t think I came all this way 
                    without a backup answer, do you?  Oh, 
                    and it s a real crowd-pleaser, too.  
                    It s going to kill.

      Serena is confused, but then there s the ding-ding-ding of a 
      fork hitting a champagne glass.  The Dean is standing in the 
      doorway to the dining room.

                    That s Latin for  the quiz.  

      Serena throws Blair a look.  The Dean is excited, jovial. The 
      potential Yale applicants are nervous.

                    yourself very professionally.

                                  JENNY

                    I think you should go back to school.

                    school is too important.

      Jenny looks like she s going to cry, but she doesn t.  
      There s a moment.  She stops herself, pulls back.

                                  JENNY
                    If that's what you think, then that s 
                    what you think.  We made a deal, and 
                    I agreed to it.  

      Rufus is surprised at her maturity.  He also feels bad about 
      lying, but he feels he has to.

                    did.  I respect that.  Your decision 
                    is your decision.

                                  RUFUS
                    That s very mature, Jenny.

                                  JENNY
                    I know.  That s what I was hoping 
                    you d get.

                    Get your hands off me.  Or are you 
                    trying to kill me, too?

      Serena releases her dramatically.

                                  SERENA
                    Blair, a guy died.  And you use it as 
                    part of a game?  Who does that? 

                                  BLAIR
                    It s not a game, and this isn t just 
                    another thing on a laundry list.  
                    This is Yale.  My dream.  You crossed 
                    a line.

      Now Blair shoves Serena.  

                                  SERENA
                    So did you, when you brought up Pete. 
                    And as for my being here, take that 
                    up with the school.  

      Serena shakes her off and turns to leave, but Blair beans her 
      with her handbag.  Serena stops -- she did not just do that!

                                  BLAIR
                    Why do you think you were invited?  
                    You know on paper you're not Yale 
                    material.  Could it be your face on 
                    Page Six?  Your name everywhere?  
                    Face it, Serena -- Yale needs to up 
                    their Q rating just like all the 
                    other schools, and girls like you are 
                    what they re going to use to do it. 

      Finally Serena can take no more, practically runs at Blair --

                                  SERENA
                    Shut up --

                                  BLAIR
                    No, you shut up --

      Blair tries to duck but Serena grabs her dress.  Blair slaps 
      her away.  Serena slaps her back.  And they re into it.  A 
      full-on S and B catfight.  As we leave them, mid brawl --

      Lily examines herself in front of a full-length mirror.  We 
      see that she's wearing the short, sexy,  Serena  dress, not 
      the one that had been sent over for her.

      She looks beautiful, but is not at ease in the dress.  She 
      starts to pull it down lower on her legs when she hears the 
      elevator doors open, and VOICES.  She exits the bedroom...

      INT. VDW/BASS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (N-1)3535

      Jenny and Rufus exit the elevator.  Rufus is apprehensive.

                                  RUFUS
                    You sure it s okay for us to just

      Lily has come out from the hall wearing the dress.  Rufus  
      jaw might drop a little.

      He looks at his watch -- where is Chuck?  He takes out his 
      phone, calls.  He gets Chuck s voicemail, leaves a message.

        compromising position, humiliated.  A couple STUDENTS pass. 

                                  DAN
                    Uh, hi?  D you think maybe -- 
                          (they ignore him)
                    No?  Okay.
                          (as someone else crosses)
                    Hey!  Hi there -- I was just 
                    wondering if --

      As he s ignored again, there s Nate. 

                                  NATE 
                          (re: statue)
                    I hope you at least bought the statue 
                    a drink first.

      Nate moves to his aid, tries to untie him.

                                  DAN
                    Hey.  I don t know if I want your 
                    help. 

                                  NATE
                    You might if you knew the only reason 
                    you re here is because they thought 
                    you were me. 

                                  DAN
                    How is that possible?  I didn t lie 
                    about my name.

                                  NATE
                    Yeah, but I have a feeling someone 
                    else did for you.  

                                  DAN
                    Why would anyone want to hurt Mr. 
                    Perfect, Nate Archibald?  

                                  NATE
                      Apparently my  legacy  at Yale 
                    involves a lot of people hating my 
                    father s guts.  
                          (off Dan)
                    By the way, this knot is ridiculous.

                          (seeing someone)
                    Could you try a little faster?  
                    There s something approaching that 
                    looks female and I m not entirely 
                    proud of my choice of underwear...

      The female approaching is none other than Jordan, the Lit 
      Department TA.  She sees them and stops.

                                  JORDAN
                    You two again?

      Dan and Nate are embarrassed in different ways.

                        DANNATE
      H--hi.Uh huh.

                                  JORDAN (CONT D)
                    Is this performance art piece your 
                    new plan to get my attention?

                                  DAN
                    Would it work if it was?

      She almost can't help herself.  Jordan shakes her head, and 
      moves to untie Dan.

                                  JORDAN
                    Move over, my mom was in the Navy.

      As she starts untying, Dan looks to Nate, nods. 

                                  DAN
                    Thanks.

      A tousled and tired Serena and Blair sit on the steps.  
      Broken-heeled shoes in hand, torn straps akimbo.

                    Y know Blair, I can t do it anymore.

                                  BLAIR
                    That s because you were about to 
                    lose.  I had you pinned with that 
                      chicken-wing -- don t deny it.

                    The wars, the betrayals, the watching 
                    out for every possible landmine.  
                    It s exhausting.

                                  BLAIR
                    I m sick of it, too.  Sick of always 
                    looking like Darth Vader next to 
                    Sunshine Barbie.  Life s too short, 
                    but you make it feel so long.

                    If that's how we really feel, maybe 
                    we shouldn't be friends?  We were 
                    probably going to grow apart in 
                    college anyway, we might as well just 
                    start now.

                    Fine by me.  You live your life, and 
                    I'll live mine? 

    The two girls look at each other.  Is this really it?  Maybe 
    if one said something, the other would follow, but instead:

                                  SERENA
                    Sounds great.

                                  BLAIR
                    I agree.

                                  SERENA
                    Goodbye, Blair.

                                  BLAIR
                    Goodbye, Serena.

    And with that, the girls walk their separate ways.  As they 
      disappear into opposite corners of the campus...

      Dan, Nate and Jordan are having their morning coffee on 
      benches in the Quad.  Jordan has read Dan s stories.  Nate is 
      happy to have brokered this meeting.  He looks on, proudly:

                    So you think maybe you can help?

                    pretty sure I can get someone in the 
                      department to read these and write 
                    you a recommendation.

                    my dream of Yale isn t totally dead.  
                      Humiliated and embarrassed, sure, but

                    I would have liked you whatever your

      Jenny comes out from her bedroom to find Rufus cooking 
      breakfast.  Vanessa's also sitting there, with a big smile on

                    When I was your age, the only thing I 
                    wanted was to be a musician, but my 
                    parents didn t think it was a good 
                    idea.  Which made for some pretty 
                      uncomfortable years, and ended up 
                    causing more damage between us than 
                    it needed to.  Last night I realized 
                    we don t have to do things that way.

                          (pauses, small:)
                    Doing the same thing for you.

      The two girls look at each other.  Of course.  

                                  SERENA
                    I was up all night thinking about the 
                    first time we came here together when 
                    we were nine.  Remember when your dad 
                    took us to the Harvard/Yale game, and 
                    you tackled Senator Schumer s 
                    daughter because she was in a Harvard 
                      sweatshirt? 

                                  BLAIR
                          (wistful)
                    I bet those grass stains never came 
                    out.
                          (off Serena s smile)
                    I don t want to not know you.  I   
                    can t not know you.  

                                  SERENA
                    But everything we said to each other 
                    last night...

                                  BLAIR
                    Was the truth that needed to be said.  
                    Like this: I'm jealous because it all 
                    seems so easy for you, and I have to 
                    fight for everything.

                                  SERENA
                    Or this: I only take things from you 
                    because if you want them, I know 
                    they re worth having.  I don't know 
                    what I want, or who I am, without 
                    you.

      Serena takes Blair s hands in hers.  Blair s eyes well up.

                                  BLAIR
                    I know who you are.  The only person 
                    in the world who could put up with an 
                      overachieving, Machiavellian know-it-
                    all like me.

                    Maybe we had that fight because the 
                    reality of being separated next year 
                    is just too scary to think about?

                                  BLAIR

                    ride home together?

      Chuck finds Nate, who is waiting by their parked limo.

                    Hey, you should be glad.  Those guys 
                    were coming for you.  I saved your 
                    ass.

                    You didn t have to send them after 
                    Dan.

                    Two birds, one stone?  Seemed good to 
                    me.  Besides, since when do you care 
                    what happens to humdrum Humphrey?

                    We ll talk about it in the car.  

      Nate sees Dan walking off, and makes a quick decision. 

                                  NATE
                    I think I d rather take the train. 

      Nate heads off after Dan with a  Dan, wait up! .  Dan turns, 
      surprised.  Chuck looks after them, more pissed than ever...

      Blair and Serena are walking to their limo together.

                    So the Dean seemed inscrutable to you

                    I don t think he even blinked.

      Blair stops Serena.  Looks at the campus, wistfully. 

                                  BLAIR
                    Well, since we re probably both going 
                    to end up at Hunter after what 
                    happened, I think we ought to say a 
                    proper goodbye.

      They look at the beautiful campus in the morning light.  It s 
      heartbreaking.  Serena s cell rings.  She answers:

                                  SERENA

                    Oh, hello, sir!
