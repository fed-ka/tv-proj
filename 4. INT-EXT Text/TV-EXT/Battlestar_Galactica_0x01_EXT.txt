      A tiny SPACE STATION hangs in the deep void. 

                                                                            FADE OUT. 

      SUPER: They were the product of a desire to make life easier on the planet Kobol. 


      A small COLONIAL TRANSPORT glides into frame and toward a docking with the station.  There 
    are no other ships or planets visible. 

                                                                            FADE OUT. 

      SUPER:  At first, they were simple robots.  Toys.  Conversation pieces at parties for the rich and 
      trendy.   


      The Transport is docked at the station. 

      SUPER:  A remote space station was built where Cylon and Human could meet and maintain 
      diplomatic relations.  Every month, the Colonials send an officer.   


      The Colonel's Colonial Transport EXPLODES. 


                                                                            FADE OUT. 

                                                                          OVER BLACK: 

      The echoing BOOMS of the explosions become the SOUND of RUNNING FEET on a metal 
      grating. 

      BANG-BANG, BANG-BANG, BANG-BANG... 

      FADE IN: 


      A busy terminal where both aircraft and spacecraft await passengers.  A large SPACE 
      TRANSPORT is docked at one of the gangways.  We should feel like we're viewing this FX shot 
      through a hand-held camera. 


    As the Transport ship LIFTS OFF from the terminal, our hand-held camera tracks it up toward the 
      sky. 

                                                                          DISSOLVE TO: 


      Our first look at the enormous ship, cruising slowly through space sets the tone for all the exterior 
      space shots to follow -- We see Galactica not in a big sweeping 3-D hero shot, but as if it were 
      being seen from a hand-held camera aboard a plane flying alongside the ship.  The framing is a 
      little wobbly and the picture goes soft once or twice as our imaginary cameraman struggles to 
      keep the ship in focus. 


      Our view is from a camera mounted just ABOVE the cockpit of a Viper fighter and our view is 
      straight ahead.  Up ahead we can see Galactica's stern coming into focus and at the very bottom 
    of the frame we can just make out the top of the cockpit canopy.  This is a FIXED CAMERA, 
      which neither pans nor zooms, and the frame constantly changes and moves as the Viper makes       minute course adjustments.   We HEAR the WIRELESS (our term for RADIO) transmissions 
      between Galactica and the pilot: 

                                  LEE (WIRELESS) 
                    Galactica/Viper Four-five-zero.  Beam acquisition lock. 


      A similar angle as that seen on the Viper, but now looking forward over the double side-by-side 
      cockpit of a RAPTOR.  The Hangar Deck TILTS dangerously to one side as we careen toward a 
      landing. 


      The Transport ship seen in Act One maneuvers in for a docking with Galactica. 


    On the bank of a RIVER flowing through the middle of the city, Baltar and the beautiful dark-
      haired Woman stand next to the rail.  It's an idyllic romantic scene as they watch the light 
      reflecting off the water... vendors selling trinkets from their stands... music wafting out of shops 
      and cafes.                                     BALTAR 
                    It may interest you to know that the final results of my 
                    CNP project were in this afternoon -- it's working at close 
                    to 95% efficiency throughout the entire Fleet.  Hold your 
                    applause, please. 

                                  WOMAN 
                    What, no applause for me?  I doubt you would've ever 
                    completed the project in the first place without me. 

                                  BALTAR  
                    Well, you helped, yes, but... 

                                  WOMAN 
                    I did more than help.  I rewrote half your algorithms and 
                    saved your project. 

                                  BALTAR 
                    Okay, okay.  Let's not get crazy.  You were... extremely 
                    helpful.   But you got something out of it.  I let you poke 
                    around inside the Defense mainframe -- breaking about 
                    twenty statutes in the process, I might add -- and now 
                    your company will have a huge advantage for the next 
                    defense contract. 

                                  WOMAN  
                    That's not why I did it.  I helped you because I love you.  
                    Besides, God wanted me to help you. 

                                  BALTAR 
                          (uncomfortable) 
                    Right.  He... spoke to you. 

                                  WOMAN 
                    He didn't speak to me in a literal voice and you don't 
                    have to mock my faith.   

                                  BALTAR 
                    I'm not. 

                                  WOMAN 
                    I pray for guidance and try to listen for God's wishes in 
                    my heart.  Anything wrong with that? 

                                  BALTAR 
                    No.  Of course not.  I'm just... not very religious. 

                                  WOMAN 
                    Does it bother you that I am? 

                                  BALTAR 
                    Honestly?  It puzzles me.  You're an intelligent, attractive 
                    woman. How you can be taken in by a bunch of 
                    mysticism and superstition is beyond me.  But I'm willing 
                    to overlook it because of your other... attributes.     He gives her a lascivious once-over. 

                                  WOMAN  
                    You are the very definition of a sinner. 

                                  BALTAR 
                    Guilty as charged.   

    He moves to kiss her, but she turns her head. 

                                  WOMAN 
                    I have to go.  I'm meeting someone. 

                                  BALTAR 
                    Really.  Who is he?  I'm insanely jealous. 

                                  WOMAN 
                    I doubt that.   

                                  BALTAR 
                    So touchy tonight.  Well, I'm meeting someone too -- 
                    business.  New project at Defense I might do.  Anyway -- 
                    call you tomorrow.  'Bye. 

    He gives her a quick kiss on the cheek and heads off.  She watches him go with an enigmatic, 
      thoughtful expression.  Then she hears something -- turns, reacts to someone o.c. 

                                  WOMAN  
                    It's about time.  I wondered when you'd get here.   

      CLOSE ON A CYLON 

      Right out of the 1970's show.  Red-eyed visor, chrome body suit, the whole thing.   

                                  ELOSHA 
                          (prelap) 
                    ... with humility and piety we ask for your blessing, oh 
                    Lords of Kobol... 

      REVEAL:  


      The ceremonial squadron is circling in formation at a distance from Galactica. 

                                  ADAMA (WIRELESS) 
                    The values we fought for are still worth preserving today.   


      The massive bulk of the Galactica looms directly before us.   


      Shooting hand-held from our imaginary camera platform, we follow Lee's Viper as it spins and 
    rolls before executing a perfect recovery and roaring over the Galactica. 

                                  LEE (WIRELESS) 
                    This is Apollo.  I'm clear. 


      From a fixed camera mounted on one of the wings of the massive RAPTOR, we're looking in at 
    the canopy, where the heads of Sharon and Helo are sitting in the cockpit. 

                                  CAG (WIRELESS) 
                    Boomer, you're on.  Take'em in. 


      The sun is just starting to creep up over the horizon.  Not a beautiful, glorious morning, just an 
      average day: 

      SHOP KEEPERS open up their stores... 

      POLICEMEN take a report at a crime scene... 

        CONSTRUCTION WORKERS setting up their equipment... 

      A MAN jogging down by the river... 


    Out in front of the (old) Viper, we see the Transport as it pulls away from Galactica. 

                                  LEE (WIRELESS) 
                    Colonial Heavy 798, this is Viper 105.  My callsign is 
                    Apollo and I'll be your escort back to Kobol. 


      The Viper takes position alongside the transport as they both head away from Galactica. 

                                  WIRELESS VOICE 
                    Copy that Viper 105.  Glad to have you with us, Apollo.  
                    We'll do our best to make it an uneventful trip. 

    In the b.g., the entire Galactica SQUADRON comes into view, with Sharon's Raptor in the lead. 

                                  SHARON (WIRELESS) 
                    Viper 105/Raptor 238.  This is Boomer, just wanted to 
                    say it was an honor to fly with you, Apollo.                                     LEE (WIRELESS) 
                    Copy that, Boomer.  The feeling is mutual.  You heading 
                    back to Kobol? 

                                  SHARON (WIRELESS) 
                    Yes, sir.  Back to Kobol and reassignment. 

                                  LEE (WIRELESS) 
                    Hope our paths meet up again someday, Boomer. 

                                  SHARON (WIRELESS) 
                    Copy that sir.  Safe journey. 

      The Galactica Squadron pulls away from Lee and the Transport and heads off into space. 


      From a camera mounted on the ship's belly, we see a PORTAL OPEN and three MASSIVE 
      WEAPON COILS are EJECTED from Galactica into space.  They travel a short distance away 
      from the ship by their own inertia. 


      IMPLODE with a minimum of fuss.  One minute they're there, the next, they're a field of dust. 


      With Boomer's Raptor still in the lead. 

                                  CAG (WIRELESS)                     Boomer, acknowledge Galactica's signal, send them our 
                    position...  


      The two ships flying formation. 


      Leading the (new) Vipers into battle.   


    As the 20 Vipers charge ahead. 

      3 -- CAG looks out the canopy at his Vipers. 

                                  CAG (WIRELESS) 
                    All right, boys and girls, break into attack formation -- 
                    there might be only two of them out there, but stay with 
                    your wingman and don't get overconfident.  

      4 -- The 20 Vipers spread out into pairs. 

                                  PILOT #1 (WIRELESS) 
                    Anybody know what these things look like?                                   PILOT #2 (WIRELESS) 
                    The pictures I've seen of old Cylon fighters were sorta 
                    like a big flying wing. 

                                  PILOT #3 (WIRELESS) 
                    Those pictures are forty years old. 

                                  PILOT #2 (WIRELESS)  
                    Yeah, well how do we engage a fighter we've never 
                    seen before? 

                                  PILOT #3 (WIRELESS) 
                    It doesn't matter what they look like genius, just shoot at 
                    whatever it is you see.   

                                  PILOT #4 (WIRELESS) 
                    Time for a little payback. 

                                  PILOT #5 (WIRELESS) 
                    I hear that. 

                                  CAG (WIRELESS) 
                    Okay, keep the chatter down. 

      2 -- Sharon looks down at her radar screen, which we will learn is called a DRADIS (Direction, 
      RAnge and DIStance).  The tracks of the Viper approaching the Cylon targets are clearly marked. 

                                  SHARON (WIRELESS) 
                    CAG/Boomer.  You should be in visual range.  Do you 
                    see them? 

                                                                  COLLAPSE SCREENS 
                                                                                    TO: 


      And there they are -- TWO CYLON FIGHTERS coming out of the black void of space like two 
      white sharks appearing in the murky depths.  There is something vaguely anthropomorphic about 
    the design, as if the original Cylon bipedal warriors had been reworked and reconceptualized into 
      spacecraft.  There is at least a suggestion of design elements that recall the classic Cylon -- 
      chrome sheen, metal grill work in front, a hint of a helmet in place of a cockpit.  It's like facing a 
      Cylon warrior in space. 


      Cruising along, unperturbed. 

      4 -- The Vipers going in for the kill... 

                                  PILOT #2 (WIRELESS) 
                    Hey -- there's no cockpits!  There's nobody flying these 
                    things. 

                                  PILOT #3 (WIRELESS) 
                            (disappointed) 
                    So they're just some drones?  Ah...  

      3 -- CAG leads the charge. 

                                  CAG 
                    I don't care what they are.  We've got good targets.  All 
                    Vipers -- weapons free.  Go get'em. 

      5 -- And then it happens.  DOORS slide aside on the noses of the Cylon fighters, revealing a RED 
      TRACKING LIGHT.  The oscillating light emits a BEAM which SWEEPS out and hits...     

      4 -- The Vipers.  Each ship LOSES POWER the instant the beam hits it.  Engines, running lights, 
      cockpit lights -- everything.  The ships continue moving forward out of sheer inertia, but without 
      guidance. 

      3 -- The CAG reacts in shock.  His wireless no longer works. 

                                  CAG (cont'd) 
                    What the hell was that...?  I've lost power!  Jolly, take 
                    over!  Jolly...?  Can you read me...? 

    He looks around at the other DARK and SILENT Vipers cruise through space. 

      2 -- Sharon and Helo watch their screens with growing concern. 

                                  HELO 
                    What're they doing?   

                                  SHARON 
                    I don't know.  They're just going straight in. 

                                  HELO 
                    The com chatter's gone.  They're not talking anymore... 

      Sharon watches for another beat, then dials in a wireless. 

                                  SHARON 
                    CAG/Boomer.  
                          (beat) 
                    CAG/Boomer.  Do you read?  

      5 -- The Cylon BEAMS STOP and the fighters head toward the powerless Vipers, which are 
      sitting ducks.       3 -- The CAG can only watch helplessly as he sees 20 MISSILES drop from the Cylon wings. 

                                  CAG 
                    Oh my God. 

    4 & 5 -- On the nose of the lead Cylon fighter, the red light continues its remorseless oscillation.  
      Then the Cylon MISSILES STREAK away from the fighters and SLAM into the Vipers -- 
      DESTROYING ALL OF THEM. 

      3 -- The CAG's Viper EXPLODES around him. 

      2 -- On Sharon's Dradis screen, the Vipers symbols abruptly VANISH.  Sharon and Helo just sit 
      there for a moment, stunned by the sudden and complete destruction of the entire Galactica 
      squadron. 

      5 -- The Cylons avoid the billowing CLOUDS of VAPORIZED PARTICLES that moments ago 
      were ships, and continue on. 

      2 -- The dradis screen now shows the Cylon fighters heading straight for them. 

                                  HELO 
                    Uh... Boomer...? 

      Sharon sees it, nods. 

                                  SHARON 
                    Right.   

      1 -- The Raptor wheels about and STREAKS AWAY. 

                                                                  COLLAPSE SCREENS 
                                                                                  TO: 


        A PASSENGER liner is at the same terminal we saw in Act One.  It's smaller and sleeker than the 
      multi-purpose Transport. 


      Baltar wanders outside the terminal as if in a daze.  PEOPLE are hurrying around in various 
      stages of panic or apathy.  It's a scene of mass confusion and fear.  Baltar still has his suitcase in 
    his hand.  Doesn't know what to do. 

      Then he sees her.   

      Number Six is standing a short distance away, watching him.  He goes to her, not sure what else 
    to do.  Baltar just stands there. 

                                  BALTAR 
                    I can't leave. 

                                  NUMBER SIX 
                    I know. 

                                  BALTAR 
                    That your doing? 

                                  NUMBER SIX 
                    No.  That wasn't my job. 

                                  BALTAR 
                    What was your job?   

                                  NUMBER SIX 
                    We should discuss this after. 

                                  BALTAR 
                    After?  After wha--? 


      The Shopkeeper reacts to the FLASH... 

      The Policemen reacts... 

      The Construction workers react... 

      The jogger reacts... 


      Baltar reacts to the flash and a second later, all the WINDOWS in the terminal are BLOWN OUT 
    in a shower of GLASS. 


      The bustling metropolis is being consuming by a BLINDING WHITE LIGHT.  The flash recedes, 
      forms a BALL of FIRE, then rises into a tower MUSHROOM CLOUD as a fifty-megaton 
      thermonuclear weapon detonates over the city. 

                                                                            FADE OUT. 


                                    END OF ACT FOUR 
                                        ACT FIVE 

      FADE IN: 

                                                                        MULTI-SCREEN: 


      The Raptor is twisting and turning, running from some unseen pursuer.   


      Are chasing the Raptor. 

    2 -- Sharon turns around, looks behind them. 

                                  SHARON 
                    Jam the warheads! 

                                  HELO                     Trying...  but I can't find their frequency... better drop a 
                    swallow. 

                                  SHARON 
                    We've only got two left... 

      1 -- A small DECOY DRONE drops from the Raptor's belly.  It races away from the Raptor. 

      3 -- One of the Cylon missiles turns to chase the decoy, but the second one hesitates, then 
      continues after the Raptor. 

      2 -- They watch the missile continue to track them on the screen. 

                                  SHARON (cont'd) 
                    Dammit. 

                                  HELO 
                    Uh, oh... 

                                  SHARON 
                    What? 

                                  HELO 
                    Check the screen ahead. 

    On Helo's screen, there are so many contacts ahead of them, that it's like a field of moving stars. 

                                  SHARON 
                    I guess we found the main fight. 

      3 -- The single remaining Cylon missile is getting closer. 

    3-- A BUZZER goes off in the cockpit. 

                                  HELO 
                    Missile lock! 

      Sharon hits the switch. 

      1 -- The Raptor drops its last DECOY, it streaks off. 

      3 -- The Cylon missile is close.  It "senses" the decoy, almost goes after it, then turns back and 
      EXPLODES. 

      1 -- The Raptor makes a final twisting maneuver and misses the full brunt of the explosion, but 
    still catches a heavy blow. 

      2 -- Inside the cockpit, the electronics go on and off, circuitry POPS and SPARKS.  A small FIRE 
      starts. 

      1 -- The Raptor is trailing FROZEN VAPOR PARTICLES, the interior lights FLUCTUATING. 

      2 -- Sharon struggles to bring the ship under control.  She puts out the fire with a small 
      EXTINGUISHER.                                     SHARON  
                    Okay... Okay... We're still here.  Helo?  Hey!  You okay? 

      Helo is conscious, if groggy. 

                                  HELO 
                    Present... 

                                  SHARON 
                    Stay with me... 

      Sharon makes a quick survey of the situation. 

                                  SHARON (cont'd) 
                    We've gotta fuel leak... we're gonna have to put down to 
                    repair it... 

                                  HELO 
                    Lotta company between us and home... 

                                  SHARON 
                    Yeah. 

      She thinks for a beat, then gets an idea.  She grabs the controls and hits the throttle. 

      1 -- The damaged ship LEAPS FORWARD on full thrust. 

      2 -- Sharon guides the Raptor straight ahead, then CUTS THE POWER.  The cockpit goes 
      DARK. 

      1 -- The ship goes DARK, but continues to move ahead. 

      2 -- Sharon and Helo are just dark silhouettes against the starfield out the canopy. 

                                  HELO 
                    So we coast? 

                                  SHARON 
                    Best way to avoid attracting attention.  No power 
                    signature, go in a straight line -- unless somebody gets 
                    close enough to actually see us, we'll look like a chunk 
                    of debris on sensors. I think we have enough inertia to 
                    make it to Kobol's ionosphere, then we'll power up and 
                    find a place to land.   

                                  HELO 
                          (pained) 
                    Nice... nice thinking there.   
                          (beat) 
                    I think we can officially stop calling you a Rook now, 
                    Lieutenant. 

      The unexpected praise catches her off-guard.  She grins at him, he grins back -- then winces.  He 
      looks down in surprise -- the side of his flight suit is soaked with BLOOD.                                                                   COLLAPSE SCREENS 
                                                                                  TO: 


      We MOVE through the devastated city, finding it littered with rubble, drifting clouds of DUST and 
      debris.  And bodies.  Hundreds of bodies, including the Shopkeeper, the Policemen, the 
      Construction workers, the jogger...  

                                  JACK (WIRELESS) 
                    It's complete chaos... never seen anything like it... the 
                    dust in the air... people wandering the streets... 


      The lumbering Transport is cruising through space, seemingly unaware of the danger from... 

      2 -- FROM CYLON MISSILE CAMERA 

      Mounted on the fuselage, we're looking directly ahead at the Transport as it rushes toward us.  

      ROARS into frame directly ahead of the missile, its ENGINES BLAZING with heat and 
      afterburners. 


      The Viper is still racing away from the cylon missile. 


      Directly ahead is a MOON.  Deeply cratered and pitted, and strewn with rough, craggy mountain 
      ranges.  

      1 -- As the Viper dives toward a CANYON on the moon's surface, the missile follows it move for 
      move. 

      4 -- CYLON MISSILE CAMERA POV 

      The camera mounted atop the missile's fuselage gives us a perfect view of Lee's Viper as it drops 
      down into the canyon and heads for a TIGHT PASSAGE. 

      5 -- CHASE CAMERA - AERIAL POV 

      Looking DOWN on the chase.  The Viper races through the passage and makes an immediate 
      hard TURN.  But instead of taking the bait and smashing into the wall, the missile opts to go UP 
      and over the passage.  As Lee's Viper winds its way through the treacherous canyon, the missile 
      flies safely above, but following him all the way. 

      2 -- Lee glances up at the missile far above his canopy. 

                                  LEE 
                    Clever little bastard aren't you...  

      He's looking for something up ahead. 

      3 -- From the overhead view ahead, we begin to notice that there are SIGNS and SYMBOLS 
      dotting the sides of the canyon.  This is a Viper TRAINING RANGE.  There's a TUNNEL 
      OPENING in the floor of the Canyon straight ahead.  A sign that flashes by us says:  INTERIOR 
      FLIGHT RULES AHEAD -- REDUCE SPEED 

      5 -- Looking DOWN on the chase.  We see Lee's Viper suddenly ZIP straight down INTO the 
      Tunnel.  The Cylon missile immediately plunges down and FOLLOWS him into the tunnel.  

      3 -- We're tearing along through the tunnel.  It's a long CAVE that's been smoothed out and 
      turned into a training run.  WARNING LIGHTS and SYMBOLS line the walls, along with the 
      occasional scorch mark.   

      2 -- Lee grips the throttle and the control yoke, braces himself... then CUTS the throttle and 
      PULLS back on the yoke.  The Viper begins to FLIP END OVER END. 

      1 -- The Viper FLIPS END OVER END, still traveling through the tunnel on inertia, but without 
      engine thrust.  Lee steadies the Viper upside down (to us) and facing directly BACKWARDS. 

      3 -- From the overhead cockpit view, it looks like we're travelling BACKWARDS and slowing 
      down a little.  We can see the Cylon missile starting to gain ground. 

      2 -- Lee watches the missile get closer, and he keeps glancing out the canopy to check his 
      position. 

      1 -- FLYING BACKWARDS, the Viper makes slight turns and adjustments to avoid obstacles and 
      keep away from the walls during turns. 

      3 -- The Cylon missile is getting BIGGER and CLOSER.         2 -- Lee reaches out quickly, JAMS a PEN on top of his instrument console -- tries to use it as a 
      CRUDE GUNSIGHT -- he squints, tries to line up the missile.  He FIRES. 

      4 -- From the Cylon missile we see FIRE streak out from the Viper guns, but MISSES. 

      1 -- Lee FIRES again... MISSES AGAIN. 

      2 -- Lee is determined, grim...  

      3 -- The Cylon missile is nearly on top of him, this is the last chance...  

      1 -- Lee FIRES -- HITS THE MISSILE -- it EXPLODES. 

      3 -- The EXPLOSION roars toward Lee's Viper -- the BLAST HITS the Viper -- blows it 
      BACKWARD... 

      1 -- The Viper is BLOWN out the END of the TUNNEL and into SPACE above the moon.  The 
      ship tumbles end over end. 

      2 -- Lee struggles to regain control of the ship.  He finally does, IGNITES the ENGINE. 

      1 -- The Viper tries to head out into space, but then the ENGINE SPUTTERS and DIES. 

      2 -- The fuel gauge is EMPTY.  Lee reacts. 

      1 -- The ship is caught by the moon's gravity and is pulled down into an ORBIT, where it coasts. 

      2 -- Lee lets out a long breath.  At least he's alive.  He works the wireless. 

                                  LEE (cont'd) 
                      Krypter-krypter-krypter.  This is Apollo to any Colonial

                    fleet training range on the Trevor moon.  Out of fuel and 
                    need assistance.   

                                                                  COLLAPSE SCREENS

    As the Viper silently orbits the moon.

                    Viper one-nine, clear forward. 


      From a camera mounted atop Galactica, we see the Viper streak away from the ship and then 
      JOIN UP with TEN OLD VIPERS already spaceborne and assemblying at a distance. 

                                  KARA (WIRELESS) 
                    Galactica/Viper one-seven.  Ready. 


      Cutting around the ship to see the THRUSTERS FIRING.  The Galactica ANGLES UP and 
      TURNS to the LEFT. 


      Now TURNING in another direction, giving us a look at the port launch tubes again. 

                                  PILOT #1 (WIRELESS) 
                    Come around again, try to --

                    bye. 

      Kara's Viper comes BLASTING out of the launch tube. 

                                                                        MULTI-SCREEN: 


      Racing away from Galactica. 


      The Vipers race away as Galactica TWISTS and TURNS to avoid a direct hit but it's not enough 
    to get completely away.  

                                                                  COLLAPSE SCREENS

      6 -- The nuclear warhead EXPLODES less than a mile away from Galactica's starboard bow and 
    the resulting energy BLOOM results in a... 

                                                                            WHITE OUT.

      partially CRUMPLED.  (The flight pods are the massive "skis" on either side of the ship.)  It's 
      VENTING AIR, FUEL, and other GASES to space from various openings in the hull.   

                                  KARA (WIRELESS) 
                      Galactica/Starbuck, if you're reading me, the forward 
                    section of the port flight pod has sustained heavy 
                    damage.    


      Another bulkhead EXPLODES and DECOMPRESSES.  Then ANOTHER. 


      DOZENS of emergency HATCHES OPEN and vent AIR directly into space.  BALLS of FLAME 
      surge out with the rushing air, but then are snuffed OUT.   


    On an abandoned emergency airstrip somewhere outside of Caprica City, Sharon's damaged 
      Raptor is parked in the sun.  The area is OPEN, with gently ROLLING HILLS.  Helo is propped 
      underneath the Raptor, a blood-soaked bandage strapped to his side, while Sharon works on the 
    fuel lines within the engine mounting.  Helo is looking off toward something o.c.  

                                  HELO 
                    That's six. 

      Sharon looks out toward FIVE MUSHROOM CLOUDS which dot the horizon.  A SIXTH is just 
      reaching up into the sky. 

                                  HELO (cont'd) 
                    How you coming on that fuel line? 

                                  SHARON 
                    Almost there.  We'll be airborne pretty soon. 

                                  HELO 
                    Good.  Gotta get back in the fight. 

      Sharon tears her eyes away from the mushroom clouds. 

                                  SHARON 
                    Yeah.  Back in the fight. 

      Sharon goes back to work and Helo stares out at the mushroom clouds.  Then he sees 
      something -- 

                                  HELO 
                    Sharon.  Get your sidearm. 

      Sharon twists around, looks in the same direction -- pales.  A MOB of people are running across 
    the distant HILLS.  And they're heading this way. 


      FIFTY desperate people.  Some half-dressed.  Some carrying suitcases.  Some hurt.  A man 
      carrying a violin.  A woman dragging a chair.  All of them running away from the mushroom 
      clouds behind them and all of them determined to get to that one spacecraft on the airstrip. 

      A man in the crowd trips, falls, pushes himself to his hands and knees.  No one even glances at 

    As the Transport maneuvers above the Viper and OPENS one of the pairs of CARGO BAY doors. 


      The MOB of people STOPS as the DEBRIS rains down on them.  Sharon is standing in front of 
    the Raptor with her sidearm out.  Helo is lying on the ground, also with his weapon at the ready.  
      Helo FIRES AGAIN (the gun does not emit a energy bolt effect -- it fires an explosive projectile) 
      and the Mob falls back a few steps.   

                                  HELO 
                    That's as close as you get!  Okay?  Let's just settle down 
                    here... settle down and no one gets hurt... 

      The Mob doesn't like it -- people curse and yell, but they don't charge either.  It's a hostile, 
      extremely desperate group of people.  Baltar is in the middle of the crowd.  A MAN speaks up. 

                                  MAN 
                    I have to get out of here!  I'll give you fifty thousand 
                    cubits!   

                                  WOMAN 
                    Sixty thousand! 

      Other voices start chiming in, in a sudden bidding war. 

                                  HELO 
                    We're not taking -- WE'RE NOT TAKING MONEY!! 
                          (they quiet) 
                    This isn't a rescue ship.  This is a military vessel and 
                    we're--  

                                  MAN #2 
                    You can't leave us here!  Look at that!   

    He gestures toward the mushroom clouds -- the people YELL and SCREAM.  The crowd 
      SURGES forward, Sharon FIRES over their heads and they fall back again.  A WOMAN with a 
      BOY pushes her way to the front of the crowd. 

      THE BOY 

    Is six-years old.  He's he same boy we saw in the Colonel's PHOTO on Armistice Station.  The 
      Woman pleads with Sharon. 

                                  WOMAN 
                    For God's sake -- take my nephew!  Please! 

                                  MAN #2 
                    What about my wife! 

      More SHOUTS and SCREAMS for help.  Sharon and Helo exchange a look -- this is getting out 
    of control fast. 

                                  SHARON                         Alright-alright-ALRIGHT!! 
                          (they quiet again) 
                    Children first -- children! 

      FIVE CHILDREN (ages 7-15) are brought to the fore, some by their parents, others just pushed 
      up through the crowd. 

                                  SHARON (cont'd) 
                    All right.  The kids go...  and we can take three more 
                    people. 

      YELLS of protest, but Helo shouts them down. 

                                  HELO 
                    That's the maximum load if we're going to break orbit.   

                                  MAN 
                    Who chooses the three?  You? 

      Murmurs of unhappiness at that idea. 

                                  SHARON 
                    No one chooses.  No one chooses! 
                          (beat) 
                    Lottery.   

      She glances at Helo -- he nods agreement.  

                                  SHARON (cont'd) 
                    Everyone gets a number.  We put the numbers in a 
                    box... pull out three.  That's it.  No arguing, no appeal.   

                                  HELO 
                    And I will shoot the first person who tries to board this 
                    ship without a winning number. 

      They don't like it, but there's acquiesence in the air. 

                                  SHARON  
                    Helo... get your flight manual... tear out the pages. 


      The Transport ship is underway. 


      The lottery has begun.  Sharon pulls scraps of the shredded flight manual out of a tool box.  The 
      crowd is silent, anxious, each of them knowing their individual chances are slight, but also 
      knowing this is the only chance.  The children selected earlier are standing in the front, saying 
      good-bye to their parents or just staring at the spacecraft. 

                                  SHARON 
                      One-twenty-seven.  One-two-seven.       An immediate SQUEAL of joy from a WOMAN toward the back of the crowd.  People make room 
    for her as she goes toward the miracle of her rescue.   

      She passes right by Baltar, and we DROP OFF on him, clutching his own scrap of paper along 
      with everyone else.  He shifts his weight from foot to foot, has trouble standing still.  Keeps 
      glancing at the giant mushroom clouds on the horizon. 

    All the lottery winners are being herded onto the Raptor by Helo, who's propped against the 
      hatch. 

                                  SHARON (cont'd) 
                    Last one. 
                          (pulls out paper) 
                    Forty-seven.  Four-seven. 

      The number in Baltar's trembling hand is 188.  He just stares at it, afraid to look up and face his 
      fate.  People are craning around, trying to see who has the winning number, but no one is 
      shouting with euphoria yet.   

                                  OLD WOMAN 
                    Excuse me...? 

      Baltar looks up to see a white-haired WOMAN in her 70's standing next to him in a faded print 
      dress.    

                                  OLD WOMAN (cont'd) 
                    I forgot my glasses somewhere... I don't remember 
                    where exactly, but... could you read this for me? 

    He looks at the paper in her hand -- 47.  He looks back up at her slightly confused and apologetic 
      face.  She only has one shoe on.  She'll believe anything he tells her.  Baltar stares back into 
      those eyes... he reaches out for the paper... and as we wonder just what he'll do -- 

                                  HELO'S VOICE 
                    Hey, aren't you Gaius Baltar? 

      Suddenly everyone is looking at the celebrity in their midst.  Whatever he might or might not have 
      done a moment ago, the opportunity is gone.  He pulls his hand away from the winning number, 
    his paranoia now in full cry. 

                                  BALTAR 
                    Yes, why?  I haven't done anything. 

                                  HELO 
                    Could you come up here, please? 

                                  BALTAR 
                    All right. 
                          (beat) 
                    This woman has number forty-seven.   
                          (to Old Woman) 
                    Come on.     As Baltar and the Old Woman walk to the Raptor, the crowd reacts with a universal groan of 
      dismay and despair.  Some are crying, some sit down as if the wind were sucked out their lungs.  
      Others just stand and stare.  Sharon watches them, her sidearm still in hand. 

                                  SHARON 
                          (sotto, to Helo) 
                    What're you doing? 

                                  HELO 
                          (sotto) 
                    Giving up my seat. 

                                  SHARON 
                    Like hell. 

                                  HELO 
                    A civilian should go in my place.   

                                  SHARON 
                    You're going. 

                                  HELO 
                    Look at those clouds, Sharon.  Look at those clouds and 
                    tell me this isn't the end of... everything. 

                                  SHARON 
                    Helo... 

                                  HELO 
                    Whatever future is left is going to depend on the people 
                    who survive.  Give me one reason why I'm a better 
                    choice than one of the greatest minds of our time? 

      Baltar and the Old Woman have arrived at the front of the crowd.  Sharon looks at him for a long 
      beat.  Baltar, of course, hasn't heard any of this and just looks back at her with genuine 
      confusion.   

                                  HELO (cont'd) 
                    You can do this without me, Sharon.  I know you can.  
                    You've proven it. 

      She struggles with it for a moment, then makes the choice. 

                                  SHARON 
                          (low, to Baltar) 
                    Get on board. 

      Baltar gapes at her for a beat, then shuts his mouth and clambers aboard the Raptor with the Old 
      Woman.  He glances back at the crowd and sees -- Number Six watching him placidly.  Baltar 
      looks again -- then she's gone.  Was she even there in the first place? 

      The Crowd notices that Baltar's going aboard and they start to get upset -- they don't like the 
      sudden change in rules -- things start to get ugly. 

                                  CROWD                           (various) 
                    Hey what's this?  What's going on?  Why is he going?  
                    What're you doing?  I'm important too!  That's not fair!  
                    Start over!  etc. 

                                  HELO 
                          (to Sharon) 
                    I think you better go. 

      Sharon pauses just long enough to shake his hand, then climbs into the hatch.  People are 
      starting to edge toward the ship.  A MAN RUSHES forward and Helo SHOOTS HIM DEAD.  The 
      crowd hesitates, then the Raptor ENGINES ROAR to life and the Raptor rises into the air like a 
      modern day Harrier jet and then ANGLES UP and roars off into the sky. 

                                                                        MULTI-SCREEN: 


      Kara's Viper makes a pass over the now stabilized ship. 

                                  KARA (WIRELESS) 
                      Galactica/Starbuck -- good to hear your voice again, D. 


      The Transport is approaching the PASSENGER LINER, which is essentially a space-going luxury 
      cruise ship.   

                                  TRANSPORT PILOT (WIRELESS) 
                    Gemon Liner 1701, this is Colonial Heavy 798.  No -- 
                    strike that.
