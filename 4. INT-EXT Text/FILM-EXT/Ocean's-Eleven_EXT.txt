A sign reads: "NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY." Someone has graffitied below it:
"If you were in prison, you'd be home now."
The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its
frame, ready for release. (If it matters -- and if you
notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.)
He hovers
there for a moment, on the precipice of
freedom.
The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of
the gate,
and the view ahead is not pleasant (New
Jersey):
Life is hard out there.
But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step
into free America...

TOPHER (O.S.)
Hey!
Hey, Rusty!
Rusty turns to the voice and --
CUT TO:
ANOTHER ANGLE
MOVING WITH him and Topher Grace, the actor, as they push
down a back alley.
TOPHER
Hey, I don't know if you're, uh,
you know, incorporated or anything,
like Rusty Ryan. And, I don't know,
incorporated, but you should think
about it, really, 'cause I was
talking to my manager yesterday --

me that since this, what we do,
could be considered research for,

should be able to write it off as
a business expense. So he suggested
that it'd be better if I wrote you
a check, and thereby --
Rusty looks at him:

REUBEN TISHKOFF, the grimace of a man in mid-movement,
forever cemented on his face, scrutinizes his two lunch
guests (Danny and Rusty) at his poolside.
TISHKOFF
Are you listening to me? You are,
both of you, nuts. I know more
about casino security than any man
alive. I invented it, and it
cannot be beaten. They got
cameras, they got watchers, they
got locks, they got timers, they
got vaults. They got enough armed
personnel to occupy Paris. Okay,
bad example...
DANNY
It's never been tried.
TISHKOFF
Oh, it's been tried. A few guys
even came close. You know the
three most successful robberies in
Vegas history?

Both Danny and Rusty look chastened.
RUSTY
You're right.

He's right.

TISHKOFF
Just out of curiosity, which
casinos did you geniuses pick to

Danny stops, almost as if he's been waiting for this
question, which of course he has.
DANNY
The Bellagio, Mirage, and the
M.G.M. Grand.
TISHKOFF

Those are Terry Benedict's

Tishkoff waves them back, sipping on his umbrellaed
cocktail.
TISHKOFF
You guys... Whadda you got against
Terry Benedict?
DANNY
What do you have against him?
That's the real question.
TISHKOFF
He torpedoed my casino, muscled me

At the end of this he better not

Because he'll kill you, and then
he'll go to work on you.

That's why we've got to be very

We have to be well-funded.
TISHKOFF
Yeah, you gotta be nuts, too. And

DANNY (V.O.)
Frank C. is in.

Frank carries his bag toward the taxi bay. He stops to

CLOSE ON a souped-up tractor-wheeled monster truck, its
ENGINE ROARING before a starting line, itching to cross
it. Now take a step back...
That souped-up monster truck stands a foot-and-a-half off
the ground and sprouts an antenna from its back bumper.
It's a remote-controlled toy.
The ROARING ENGINE comes from the vehicle next to it: an
actual monster truck. Both vehicles peer down the track
at a finish line a hundred yards away. This is a race.
The drivers stare each other down: TURK (behind the
wheel of the truck) and VIRGIL (track-side, remote
control in hand) MALLOY. They're nice boys. Really.
Peckerwoods, sure, but nice.
RUSTY (V.O.)
I talked to the Malloys yesterday.
DANNY (V.O.)
The Mormon twins?
RUSTY (V.O.)
They're both in Salt Lake City,
six months off the job. I got the
sense they're having trouble
filling the hours.
Lights flash red-to-yellow-to-green and while the TRUCK
COATS RUBBER on the track, Virgil's toy zips to a lead.
It's looking to be an embarrassment for Turk until he
jerks his wheel a little and -- ka-thunk -- flattens his
brother's vehicle.
Virgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry.
DANNY (V.O.)

Livingston walks down the boardwalk. A rollerblader with a

The men exit through the front doors, their hands over
their heads, Basher trailing them. Policemen and SWAT
members encircle the group, weapons trained on them,

COP
Well, how 'bout it?
VOICE (O.S.)
Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style.
The Cop turns; standing behind him, stone-faced, is
Rusty, in a dark suit and shades.
RUSTY
Isn't that right, Basher?
BASHER
That's right.
RUSTY
(flashing badge,
briefly)
Peck, A.T.F. Let me venture a
guess. A simple G4 mainliner,
double-coil, backwound, quick
fuse with a drag under 20 feet.
(off Cop's reaction)
That's our man. Tell me something
else. Have you checked him for
booby traps on his person? I mean
really checked, not just for
weapons...
The Cop looks bewildered. Rusty steps forward, yanks
Basher onto his feet, spins him around. He moves his
hands up and down Basher's legs, around his waist, under
his arms.

Around the corner.
BASHER

Okay: go.
And they both start running.
RUSTY
Everyone down! Get down!
There's
a bomb in the...
And behind them the SQUAD CAR ERUPTS with a BANG! A
collective SCREAM rises from the crowd, everyone ducks,
cops hit the ground and cover their heads. Rusty and
Basher move briskly past them, dodging their splayed legs
like tires on an obstacle course. By the time the
Explosives Cop thinks to look around for Basher, they've
both disappeared.

Rusty appears in the f.g. behind a pillar, as dapper as
Saul is down-at-heel, watching him go. When Saul
disappears into the tunnel, he moves.

IN INFIELD

Saul sits on one of the long, general admission steps
under the box seats. He produces an orange from his
pocket, starts to peel it. A pair of well-shined shoes
appears behind him. Saul senses their presence, but
doesn't turn around.
SAUL
I saw you in the paddock before
the second race, outside the men's
room, when I placed my bet. I saw
you before you even got up this
morning.
RUSTY
How ya been, Saul?
SAUL
Never better.
RUSTY

On the track: The dogs are now coming around the back
stretch, and the crowd on the bleachers rises, cheering.
SAUL
You gonna treat me like a grownup

is?
Under the noise: Rusty leans in and whispers in Saul's
ear. Saul's eyes widen, then glaze over as all around
him people are standing and shouting.
Rusty places an envelope in Saul's lap, then gets up and
walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish
line... last by several lengths.
Saul considers his options. In one hand: a fan of
losing tickets. In the other (courtesy of Rusty): a
ticket to Las Vegas.
DANNY (V.O.)
And Saul makes ten.

Linus exits, casually reaching into his jacket to count

"DANIEL OCEAN." On the flip side, in handwriting: "Nice

With two dozen other tourists, Basher crosses the street
and when he meets a manhole cover he stops and,
extracting a small metal hook from his jacket, removes it
from its perch, so casual about the action that no
passerby looks twice at him.
DANNY (V.O.)
Second task: power. On the night
of the fight, we're gonna throw
the switch on sin city. Basher,

Basher drops into the hole, pulling the cover over him,
as we PULL UP OVER the Bellagio and...

BILLY TIM
(just can't get
his hand back)
Uh-huh. You said you'd be willing
to pay in cash?
FRANK
I did. You know: they say
cinnamon is wonderful for your
pores. Read that on the internet.
And that ideally you should be
wearing gloves to bed, but I find
that would interfere with my
social agenda. Problem is: I get
a reaction to camphor so I can't
use traditional remedies...
BILLY TIM
If you could pay cash, I could
probably drop the price a little.
To, say, seventeen...

Just down the block from the Terry Benedict Trinity

A crowd has gathered to witness its destruction: Terry
Benedict, for one, his finger on the button and his face
in the spotlight; Tess another, standing (near)by her
man; Danny, too, hidden within the masses, eyes fixed on
his ex; and Linus, who keeps a steady bead on Danny.

... and here's Reuben Tishkoff,
former owner of the Paradiso, come

resort and wish Terry Benedict all

Terry greets Reuben before the TV cameras and newspaper
reporters, and everyone's smiling and shaking hands, but
behind those smiles and under their breaths...
BENEDICT
Good to see you.
REUBEN
Go shit in your mouth.
Tess, her eyes roaming the crowd, finds a pair staring
back at her: Danny's. She holds his glance a moment --
long enough for both Linus and Benedict to notice --
before turning away, to...
... Benedict, who puts his public smile back on and steps
up to a podium alongside MIKE TYSON and LENNOX LEWIS, and
together they all put their hands on "the plunger" and
Benedict leans into a microphone...
BENEDICT
I hope there's as much dynamite in
the Paradiso as there will be in
this Saturday's fight.

Then hit it.
Basher flips the switch. BOOM! A quick TREMOR, then
stillness. He picks a point on the horizon, like Babe
Ruth, and suddenly...
BASHER
... One...

whole blocks of lights disappear.
Casinos vanishing one-

FLAMINGO
Every pink light vanishes.
BELLAGIO
The fountain goes flaccid.
BASHER (V.O.)

NEW YORK, NEW YORK
The roller coaster stops dead; its passengers keep their
arms raised, not sure what to do.

MGM GRAND GARDEN ARENA

Both fighters move in simultaneously, sweat flying, both
reach back, both going for the lights-out power cut to
the jaw, when... lights out.

In the distance, lights come up again, first at the
Mirage, then the MGM, gradually approaching...

All the lights are back on, and Basher observes his
achievement with great pride, his job complete.
BASHER
Viva Las Vegas.

The white VAN (now clean of the "Nevada Telecom" sign)
IDLES before the Bellagio, its windows tinted, the
driver's identity inscrutable. It is swarmed by
security, but they maintain a wide perimeter.
RUSTY (V.O.)
Your guards will load the bags
into the van's rear. If anyone so
much as approaches the driver's
door, we blow everything.

The guards carry out the money and load it into the van's
rear. There, they find a video camera mounted within the
back seat of the van monitoring them. Still they cannot
catch a glimpse of the driver. They close the van doors.
248
BELLAGIO - FROM HIGH ABOVE
248
The white van departs the valet station in front,
clandestinely shadowed by five sedans. Meanwhile, behind
the casino, a SWAT van arrives and unloads its squad.
BENEDICT (V.O.)
Now what?
RUSTY (V.O.)
Now, when I get word that the van
hasn't been followed, that the
money is secure, my men will exit
the building, and once their
safety is confirmed, you'll get
your vault back.
249
262
As the white van arrives at a charter airline's entrance,
the five sedans converge upon it, TIRES SCREECHING, Goons
emerging, weapons drawn.
HEAD GOON
Get out of the van, now!
Now!
No response within the van. The Head Goon signals and
the others SHOOT the van's tires.

263
265
The stalemate with the van continues.
Still no movement
from inside.

HEAD GOON
Out of the van now! Hands up!
An EMPLOYEE from the charter airline sticks his head out
of his office door.
EMPLOYEE
(innocently)
Hey, what's going on here?
Half-a-dozen firearms turn and point in his direction.
The Employee disappears back inside his office.
The Head Goon cautiously approaches the van, reaches for
the driver's door, and yanks it open...
Inside: There is no driver. Just a video camera mounted
at eye-level. The Head Goon cranes back his head,
befuddled, when he notices for the first time (and maybe
we do, too) an enormous antenna sprouting from the van's
rear bumper.
The van suddenly lurches.

SHORT DISTANCE AWAY - CLOSE ON REMOTE CONTROL
266
complete with a tiny video monitor (displaying the van
driver's POV) and a steering mechanism -- it's a near-
replica of the one Virgil Malloy used in the monster
truck drag race against his brother.
And Virgil's using it now, too, as he sits next to Reuben
Tishkoff in one of Reuben's Rolls and watches the Goons
scramble back from the flat-tired van.
TISHKOFF
Enough monkey business.
Virgil brings the van to a stop, then readies a
distinctive red button on his remote.
267
BACK WITH VAN
267
As the Head Goon reaches for the rear door, his hand
inches away when...
... BARROOOOM!
The door EXPLODES open!
Knocked on his ass, the Head Goon watches as the canvas
"X" bags within burn to cinders. He does, however,
happen to notice one burning shred of paper dislodged
from a bag: It's a promotional flier for a call girl
service.

The SWAT team exits and boards the second vehicle Turk
and Virgil have been working on all this time, the one in
the warehouse with an air freshener hanging from its
rearview mirror: it's a replica of a SWAT van.
Turk takes the wheel as the others jump in the back.
Rusty flips open another cell phone...
RUSTY
Las Vegas P.D. This is Officer
Brooks, New Jersey Probation
Division. I have a violator in
your jurisdiction...
(cupping phone)
Hit it.
Turk hits the gas and the VEHICLE PEELS away, carrying its
cadre of new multi-millionaires far away from the
Bellagio Hotel and Casino.
282
292
The SWAT van rounds a corner and ducks inside the
warehouse.
Three-and-a-half seconds pass.
And the eight SWAT members reappear, now all in suits,
perfectly pressed, and with grins on their faces and
change in their pockets, they begin their victory stroll,
single-file and sloppy... right down the...
293
STRIP - MOVING WITH THEM
293
Turk, Livingston, Frank, Basher, Yen, Saul, Linus and
Rusty march down the strip single-file, and when they
come to an intersection...
... Virgil and Reuben, also in suits, fall into stride
for a victory lap in front of the Bellagio fountains.
Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into
different hotels or grabbing cabs, until there are only
two left: Rusty and Linus.
They take each other in, shake hands, and part.
294

Tess exits, searching for Danny.
She rounds the building
to...
295
295
Where a LVPD squad car has just arrived to take goon-held
Danny away. She runs toward it.
TESS
Wait!
They do. As Danny is handcuffed and prepared for loading
in the back, he and Tess hold each other's glance.

A cop lowers Danny's head as he directs him into his

How long will you be?
DANNY

Three to six months, I should

The squad car door closes him in and Tess stands vigil as
it pulls away.

Rusty watches Danny being driven back to prison, too.

SUPERIMPOSE:
THREE TO SIX MONTHS LATER.
The great metal gate opens once more, revealing Danny
Ocean in its frame again, ready for release.
He looks forward -- no one's there to greet him, and the
view of New Jersey looks no brighter than it did before.
He takes his first step into free America...
... to discover Rusty leaning against the prison wall.
Beyond him sits his second-hand Mercedes from L.A.
RUSTY
Looking for someone?
DANNY
Thirteen million and you drive
that piece of shit cross country
to pick me up?
RUSTY
Hello to you, too.
They shakes hands.
Rusty looks Danny over.
RUSTY
Your hair's grayer.

Life... is a roomful of pillows.

C'mon...
MOVING WITH Danny and Rusty toward the Mercedes, together
again.
RUSTY
Where do you want to go first?
DANNY
To a phone.
Rusty had anticipated this.
RUSTY
I stopped and picked up your
personal effects, put them in the
back seat.
DANNY
My what?
Danny gets to the passenger door and looks in to see Tess
sitting in the back. She smiles at him.
DANNY
(smiling back,
then)
I'm not sure these belong to me.
TESS
Sure they do.
Danny and Rusty get in.
Danny kisses Tess.
Rusty STARTS
the CAR.
DANNY
We need to find Rusty a girl.
RUSTY
There's a women's prison just down
the road...

He drives off. In the back, Danny takes Tess's hand in
his. Notices a silver wedding band on it.
DANNY
You said you sold this.
TESS
That's what I said.
DANNY
Liar.
TESS
Thief.
As they drive away...
... another car STARTS its ENGINE begins to follow.
At
the wheel: Benedict's goons.
