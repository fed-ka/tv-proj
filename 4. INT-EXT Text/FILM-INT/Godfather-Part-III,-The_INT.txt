A young Latino, and we will recognize him as Ar=igo,
has moved to Tony's side. As the cheers have erupted
once more, Amigo, with'a brief nod of the head, indic-
ates that Tony shouldfol:ow him.
ANOT'_R ANGLE
As Arrigo goes, Tony looks after him briefly, then over
to the American Delegation including Lucas, the Assistant
Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs; Cariock,
the Speaker of the House and several prominent liberal
Senators including McKissick of Utah and the elegant
Harthaiemew of Pennsylvania.
Also in the delegation, in uniform, is Stu Palmateer.
The older man's eyes meet with Tony's for a brief
moment. He has seen the exchange. He watches as
Tony leaves, then looks over toward u_agudo, Vidal's
I
Chief of Police. The harsh, heavy Policeman is laugh-
1 ing at something Vidal has said, seemingly paying no
attention to Tony's exit.
As Tony is crossing the lobby, Elizabeth Ann Dunne,
followed by 'a small entourage, enters. Half a pace
behind her is Kenny Morton, her producer and behind
them are three men carrying portable TV equipment,
cameras, tripods, batteries, so on. She is speaking

trusts or is ready to forgive his father, but he
knows the sound of good sense when he hears it.

out that the President used the
Corleone family to assassinate the
head of a foreign state.

want, my friendship, the benefit of
my experience -- if you'll accept it.
It's yours.
TONY
I I need your advice.
MICHAEL
(nods, then)
There are two ways I see to handle
this. First, I can make you dis-
appear in. Sicily until everything
blows over. Things change. Men get
old and angers cool. In four or
five years you could probably be
safe to come home again..
TONY
What's the other way?

could lose.
