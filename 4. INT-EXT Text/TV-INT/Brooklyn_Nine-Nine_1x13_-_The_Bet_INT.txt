  JAKE, HOLT, and CHARLES are in the wings of a small stage 
  area.  They look dapper in their dress blues. 

                              JAKE
                      (can you believe it?)
                Charles!  Medal of Valor!

                              CHARLES
                I know! 

                              JAKE
                For getting shot in the butt!

                              CHARLES
                For  exceptional acts of heroism or 
                  voluntary risk of personal safety.   But 
                you know, six of one.

                              HOLT
                This is one of the NYPD s highest honors.  
                Today is your day, Detective Boyle. 

  Charles smiles.


  ON THE STAGE, DEPUTY CHIEF GERBER stands at the podium.  
  Charles can be seen in the wings glowing with pride.  Jake 
  and Holt stand behind him, supportive.

                                GERBER
                Heroism can t be measured by a piece of 
                metal, but it s the best we can do to 
                  recognize brave officers who put their 
                lives on the line.  It is my great honor 
                to present the Medal of Valor to 
                  Detective Charles Boyle... 

  Charles walks on stage.  The crowd, including AMY, TERRY, 
  ROSA, GINA, SCULLY, AND HITCHCOCK applaud politely.

                                GERBER
                ...and Sergeant Peanut Butter! 

  The crowd ERUPTS as A POLICE HORSE is lead onto the stage.  
  Jake turns to Holt, delighted.  

                              JAKE
                Oh my god, Charles is getting the same 
                prize as a horse.BROOKLYN NINE-NINE    "The Bet"      Shooting Draft         10/25/13   2.

                At least Boyle was announced first.

                              JAKE

                amazing!

                That s enough, Peralta.  This is a huge 
                honor, and nothing can take that away 
                from him-- 

                              JAKE

  The horse NEIGHS.

                That is unfortunate.

  They both give a weak thumbs-up to Charles.

  Amy, Rosa, Terry, Hitchcock, and Scully work at their desks.  
  Jake walks up to Amy, and they stare each other down.

                I was born ready.

                              JAKE

                you ready to lose?   And you said you 
                were born that way.

                              AMY
                Twist my words all you want -- I m 
                winning this bet.

                                HITCHCOCK
                What bet?  What are you guys talking 
                about?

  Everyone turns to him in disbelief.

                Whoever makes more felony arrests wins.


  The squad minus Holt is gathered.  Jake and Amy argue.

                car.

                              CHARLES
                Jakey, no!  Thor would never wager his 
                hammer.  Neil Patrick Harris would never 
                wager his showmanship!  Losing that car 
                would be the worst thing in the world for 
                you.

                Then it s settled: if Peralta loses, 
                Santiago gets his car.  If Santiago 
                loses, she goes on a date in said car.

  They SHAKE on it.

                That s a very firm handshake.

  Captain Holt exits his office.  Charles hobbles after him.

  Holt returns to his office.  Jake and Amy look at each other, 
  then sprint after him.  Jake pushes A CHAIR at Amy, then 
  throws A PEN, then swipes A STACK OF PAPERS off GINA S Desk.

                Rosa died eight years ago.  Let s get you 
                a drink.


  Jake stands in the center of the bar.

                  Attention, everyone!  We are about to 
                leave, but now, for the first time as 
                winner and loser, Santiago and I will 
                perform the steerage jig from the film,  
                   Titanic,  which we have in no way 
                  practiced.

  Jake and Amy are back in their regular clothes.  They sit in 
  the car.  Jake looks through BINOCULARS.

  Terry and Sharon talk it out at a quiet corner table.

                                SHARON
                Why would you go back in the field and 
                not tell me?

                Baby, I m sorry.  Captain s life was in

                I guess I can kind of understand that.

  Holt walks up.

                Sharon, I have to apologize.  I want to 
                assure you that the call to put Sergeant 
                Jeffords in the field wasn t some spur of 
                the moment, impulse decision.  It s been 
                in the works for a few months now.

  Jake and Amy, still on the stakeout.  Jake checks his watch.

                worst date of your life.

                Hmmm no.  Nothing will ever be worse than 
                the date I had with my aunt s dentist... 


  Amy sits across from DOCTOR NASH, a dentist.  

                              DR. NASH

  He offers a bite of food on his fork, then uses the fork and

                choice to go back in the field that night 
                was an impulse decision.  He didn t even

                who I was protecting.  I just saw a gun 
                and an NYPD vest so I dove on instinct.

  Rosa is stunned.

                But it is really cold.  It s -- I see it  
                -- can we just switch?  

  They awkwardly switch places.  


  Amy talks with Holt.  

                              HOLT
                  Excellent job on the stakeout last night.  
                I m glad to see you two still work well 
                together despite that ridiculous bet. 

                              AMY
                Thanks.  Me too.  

                              HOLT
                And I appreciate you turning down the 
                relief team.  I m not sure they would ve 
                been able to make that bust.  

                              AMY
                Yeah... right... relief team.

  Amy turns to exit and looks at Jake at his desk.


  Charles enters.  Gina walks up to him. 

                              GINA
                Hey, Charles, what do you think about 
                Scully s shirt? 

                              CHARLES
                I think it s really elegant. 

  REVEAL: Scully is wearing a purple, suede shirt.

                              GINA
                He looks like an eggplant.  
                      (calling off)
                Captain Holt, Charles is back to normal, 
                can I go home now?

                              HOLT (O.S.)
                No.  It s nine am.  

  Gina walks away.  Rosa passes. BROOKLYN NINE-NINE    "The Bet"      Shooting Draft         10/25/13   33.

                              CHARLES
                Hey Rosa, I got a new shipment of beans.  
                They re exquisite.  Want a cup?

                              ROSA
                Not even a little bit.

  Charles smiles.  She smiles and exits.


  Amy walks up to Jake. 

                              AMY
                So... sorry you lost so much money last 
                night.  Guess you can add it to your list 
                of bad dates.

                              JAKE
                Nah, it goes on the good date list.  You 
                know --  cause we caught the bad guys.  

                              AMY
                That s a very mature way to look at it.

                              JAKE
                Well, I m a very mature man.   

    A DELIVERY GUY enters.

                              DELIVERY GUY
                Package for Amy Santiago. 

                              AMY
                That s me...

                              JAKE
                Oh no!  No, no, no, I forgot to cancel-- 

  The Delivery Guy hits play on a BOOMBOX and strips for Amy.

                              DELIVERY GUY
                Special Delivery from Jake Peralta...to 
                say,  Thanks for last night. 

                              JAKE
                I ll take this bullet for you, Amy!

  Jake jumps between Amy and the Stripper, who GRINDS on him.

                              JAKE
                Ew!  I deserve a Medal of Valor for this!
