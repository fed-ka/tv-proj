BOOM!
A crack of lightning illuminates the silhouette of a
perched crow large in the f.g.
TIGHT ANGLE - FRESH GRAVE
As a spade smooths the walls of a new double-decker plot.
DIMITRI (O.S.)
We're losing the light; let's pack
it in.
ANGLE - DIMITRI AND ALEXI
TWO GRAVEDIGGERS.
Scoop digger parked f.g. towering gothic-
style church b.g.
Rolls of astro turf.
They look up toward
the sky.
ALEXI
Snow, maybe?
DIMITRI
What, you gonna ski on this?
He indicates the mound of fresh dirt.
Spits into the grave.
DIMITRI (CONT'D)
Come on, let's bag this.
It's
beer time.
Alexi nods and unfurls the tarp over the dirt.
LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT - FLOWERS ON GRAVES
As we MOVE alongside a pair of canvas-sided combat boots, as the
wearer collects the most lively flowers from each grave in
sequence.
TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW
Cemetery DEFOCUSED b.g.
Large, glossy-black, the bird follows
the arc of movement in the previous shot.
Ruffles its feathers
as it begins to sprinkle rain.
ANGLE - ELLY - RESUMING HER MOTION
A dirty-blondish tenement KID of eleven, clad in a blend of cast-
offs and hand-me-downs; her version of street punk chic.
She
totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson
Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with
day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may
unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain.
She
stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT b.g.
ELLY
Guess the picnic got rained out.
She looks down o.s. at --
ANGLE - SHELLY WEBSTER'S GRAVE
as Elly places the gathered flowers down.
Almost reverent.
RESUME CROW ANGLE - ELLY B.G.
as Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave
near Shelly Webster's.
ANGLE ON GRAVE - AS ELLY LEAVES
TILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the
granite, darkening it.
EXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE
It blinks in its alien way.
WITH THE CROW
as it takes wing from it's unseen perch.
Lands stop Eric's
headstone.
It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument.
ANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE
She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird.
ELLY
Oh, scary.
The bird blinks at her from the headstone.
ELLY
What are you, like, the night
watchman?
Another blink from El Birdo.
CAMERA WITH ELLY -
BOOMING BACK HIGH
as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking
back.
Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad
alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we
continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in
the middle of the city.
CLOSE-UP of a foot-long hot dog being drowned in mustard.
MICKEY (O.S.)
What this place needs is a good
natural catastrophe.
Earthquake,
tornado...
ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND MICKEY
ALBRECHT is a black beat cop, 35, in a rain slicker.
MICKEY is the grease-aproned entrepreneur of MAXI DOGS, a steamy
open-front fast foodery.
ALBRECHT
You gotta put the mustard
underneath first.
MICKEY
Maybe a flood, like in the Bible.
ALBRECHT
Here, let me do it.
He grabs the dog from Mickey.
Mickey puffs his cigar while he
cooks.
Albrecht methodically spreads a napkin and performs
surgery on the hot dog, coating the bun with mustard, rolling
the dog in the bun.
Flashes Mickey a "gimme" look.
ALBRECHT
Come on... onion.
Don't cheap
out on me.
Lotta onions.
MOVING ANGLE - AS ELLY SKATEBOARDS TOWARDS MAXI DOGS
MICKEY
Heyyy -- it's the Elly monster.
ALBRECHT
How do you ride that thing on a
wet street?
ELLY
Talent. Hi.
ALBRECHT
Care for a hot dog?
ELLY
You buying?
ALBRECHT
I'm buying.
Elly grabs the stool next to Albrecht.
They`ve done this routine before.
ELLY
No onions though, okay?
ALBRECHT
(horror)
No onions?
ELLY
They make you fart.
Mickey laughs.
Spots Elly a Coke.
MICKEY
What's goin' on, Elly?
ELLY
I went to see a friend of mine.
MICKEY
Well, how's your friend?
ELLY
She's still dead.
Albrecht and Mickey exchange a look re:
Elly's matter-of-
factness.
Thunder KABOOMS o.s.
The crow pecks the top of the stone again
and a chip of granite flies off, bang!
EXTREME CLOSE - THE HEADSTONE
as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock.
CLOSE-UP - THE CROW
A dot of blood on its ebony beak.
LOW ANGLE - HEADSTONE
A thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the
stone towards the earth.
Rain does not interfere.
Lightning
plays in the rolling cloud cover, b.g.
RESUME THE CROW
as it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain.
CLOSE-UP - THE BLOOD
It slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock.
CLOSE-UP - FOOT TAPPER
A LOW ANGLE like the SHOT introducing Elly's boot.
This time
we see cowboy boots, leather chaps.
The foot taps.
Waiting.
MEDIUM ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER
as lightning strikes.
Just enough for us to see a figure in a
long duster and a cowboy hat.
RESUME ERIC'S HEADSTONE
DRAVEN fills with blood.
Blood continues groundward.
NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER
Turning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched
arm.
This is the SKULL COWBOY.
We glimpse the deathshead,
beneath the brim of the cowboy hat.
RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE
as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave.
TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW
shaking off rain.
Watching intently.
CLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND
Black gloved.
It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's
knuckles, like a quarter somersaulting.
RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE
The turf stirs beneath the white rose.
Magically, a slim white
parts the earth to grasp the rose.
SKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE
as the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own
headstone.
LOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC
Pale.
Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in
back.
WHite shirt.
A nothing tie.
No shoes.
Rain sluices mud
from his upturned face.
He looks to the sky.
Lightning.
ANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC
as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.
Looks o.s.
ERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY
water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched
on his arm like a hunting falcon.
He releases it and it flies
to the tree.
ANGLE -
ERIC
Watching this.
Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision.
The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.
Eric
looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy.
ERIC
What the hell are you?
SKULL COWBOY
Interested?
Follow the crow.
NB.
The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike
charnal house whisper.
Unsettling and hackle-raising.
Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His
eyes follow it.
He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the
Skull Cowboy is gone.
LOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW
Taking wing in the rain, showing the way.
ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC
alone in the cemetery.
After a moments hesitation, he lurches
off, following the crow.
DISSOLVE TO:
A candy-flaked muscle T-bird is parked at the curb.
As the T-Bird fishtails wildly around the corner and eats street.
As the T-Bird slews wide, cutting sidewalk, scattering
nightwalkers, immediately attracting everybody's attention.
ANGLE - ALBRECHT - AT MAXI-DOGS
Reacting, with a mouthful.
ALBRECHT
Goddammit.
Mickey grabs the counter phone instantly.
MICKEY
Call it in?
Albrecht is off and running for the corner already.
ALBRECHT
Yeah, do it!
(to Elly)
Stay right there!
HOLD ON MICKEY.
He points at Albrecht's hot dog.
Yecch.
MICKEY
(yelling after)
You want I should save this for
you?
The car slides to a nose-down panic stop.
SKANK (O.S.)
Dump her, man, dump her!
The woman comes tumbling from the car, which blasts off with a
war hoop from the guys inside.
ANGLE - CORNER - ON ALBRECHT
Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement.
Aims at the departing
car.
Gives it up.
Still too far away.
Pedestrians in the way.
ANGLE - THE WOMAN
hurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster.
Duct tape
stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth.
With her as
she falls into the alley darkness... straight into the arms of
CLOSE TWO-SHOT - ERIC AND THE WOMAN
Their eyes lock.
Eric stiffens with his first FLASH.
NB:
Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature
of things with which he makes physical contact.
Hints and
fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR.
Puzzle pieces he
must assemble.
Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and
accompanied by a degree of pain.
It hurts to remember.
FLASH:
Eric in lurching flight, panting.
Stops and steadies against
the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games.
ANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING)
Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric.
BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - ("CROWVISION")
"CROWVISION" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see.
Visually
distinct and immediately identifiable.
ERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES
Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes.
ANGLE - ERIC
looking up at the crow.
Disoriented.
Doesn't understand.
Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield
from:
ANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES
The rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and
debris.
ANGLE - WITH ERIC
he reels back, crashes into a dumpster.
Falls.
ANGLE - THE CROW
landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat
boots in the trash.
Flames.
LOW ANGLE - ERIC
The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.
He tears the
shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.
Wipes his face
with his shirt.
Discards it.
Stops, held by his discovery --
PUSH IN ON ERIC
as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his
chest.
Almost a circle.
Comically, he feels his back foe exit
wounds.
Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow.
His glance at the bird is almost accusatory.
ANGLE - THe CROW
Inscrutable.
We should get the idea that some silent
communication is taking place.
ANGLE - ERIC'S FEET
bare, muddied, frozen.
TILT to Eric.
His gaze moves from the
crow to the boots in the trash.
He grabs them, pushes them onto
his bare feet.
His eyes catch the firelight.
Distant o.s.
SIRENS
ERIC
Fire.
In the rain.
DISSOLVE TO:
Eric, wearing the combat boots, climbs as the crow leads him.
Up.
He jams his hand on a rusty wedge of metal.
Ouch.
CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM
Blood flows from the gash.
He vises his fist shut.
ANGLE - ERIC ON FIRE ESCAPE
Eye-to-eye with the crow.
Opens his hand.
CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S PALM
The blood flows back into the wound, which closes itself,
leaving another scar.
ANGLE - ERIC
Vising the rail.
Speaks to the night.
Almost a mantra.
ERIC
"My kitten walks on velvet feet,
and makes no sound at all.
And in
the doorway nightly sits to watch
the darkness fall.
I think
he loves the lady night..."
(to crow)
Am I alive?
Am I dead?
Something
else?
Something in between?
CLOSE-UP - THE CROW
Inscrutable.
No answer here.
RESUME ERIC
Almost bemused.
Steadier.
A hint of friendliness.
ERIC
Thanks for sharing that.
ETC. GIDEON`S PAWN SHOP - NIGHT
As the T-Bird grumbles tp park curbside.
Menacing.
Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from
the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him
on.
Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird.
ERIC
All right.
And he takes off on a run.
Only to stumble and fall.
But the
falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet
still moving.
He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and
runs out of the frame.
ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN.
as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up.
TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.
He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.
The next
roof-top is a one-story jump down.
Eric clears the jump with a
WOOF of air.
Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining
strength.
His next leap is more like a broad-jump.
Athletic.
FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW
keeping airborne, keeping ahead.
MOVING ANGLE - ERIC
Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space...
UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS
As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up
where there is no connecting building.
CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE
as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist,
grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him
downward.
ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET
Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed.
He hangs
for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment,
executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass.
ERIC
Gotcha.
He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the
ledge.
As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket
rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.
UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL
It's a looooooong way down.
ANGLE - ALLEYWAY
as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two.
A beat as we wonder
if any bones are left unpulped.
PUSH IN as Eric rolls from
facedown to his back.
TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE
as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one
piece.
ANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW
It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up,
examining his hands.
Frustrated and pissed off.
ERIC
Thanks.
CLOSE-UP - THE CROW
Not "your welcome", but other-worldly patience.
It waits.
RESUME ERIC
ERIC (CONT'D)
Where're we going next -- the
sewer?
Still, dark silence until Eric lands from ABOVE FRAME, feline.
The crow lands simultaneously b.g., perched near a roof access
door with a shaded, dim-yellow bulb.
CLOSE-UP - THE CROW
It just blinks at him.
LOW DOLLY of Elly's little combat boots moving toward the
entryway of the pit.
MUSIC gradually UP LOUDER O.s. as she
nears.
ANGLE - ELLY IN DOORWAY
Luridly-lit.
A grown-up's place.
A burly BOUNCER appraises
her, his tone jokey.
He knows Elly.
BOUNCER
Hey!
You got any ID?
ELLY
Very funny.
Ha.
Ha.
Oh my,
sides.
The Bouncer jerks a thumb.
Go on in.
High above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose
stray shards that fall toward frame.
He swings into an upside-
down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the
building's side, face down. by his quarter-inch finger grip.
CLOSE-UP - ERIC
Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension.
Hold.
Then he
relaxes, and swings back inside.
Eric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip.
An
occasional PEDESTRIAN passes without comment, brutalized
by the city.
Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet.
Two men around a trashcan fire.
We should recognize Tin-Tin by
his black leather trench coat.
A wonderfully rude Rap tune, "Got
a White WOman Tied Up In My Closet, Gonna Jab Her With A Stick,"
RAZZLES b.g.
As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen.
Slows.
Stops.
And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley.
He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel.
FOLLOW as
he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom
box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept.
Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash.
TIN-TIN
Three hundred and your a
gunslinger.
HIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO
As the crow is still watching, yet perched.
A brief
shove-and-standoff.
The gun deal has gone bad.
RATSO
Please, TIn-Tin, you know I'm good
for the money, man, I promise,
Leslie put me up to it, please,
man, don't --
(choking scream)
Tin-Tin has just up-rammed a throwing knife into Ratso.
TIN-TIN
Ratty -- shut the fuck up.
Tin-Tin lifts Ratso on the knife, gutting him.
Ratso goes
slack, deader'n hell.
Tin-Tin reaches around to click OFF
the boom box... then let's Ratso`s corpse fall.
ERIC (O.S.)
Another satisfied customer?
TIGHT ANGLE - TIN-TIN
galvanized by the surprise voice.
He automatically draw a
fresh knife from the bandolero of knives across his chest inside
the coat.
Can't yet track the source of the voice.
TIN-TIN
Who the hell is that?
(beat, venomous)
Come on out man, I won't hurt
you.
ANGLE - ERIC IN ALLEY
He steps out from behind another flaming trashcan.
Wearing a
long black scarf and the Tragedy mask.
ERIC
Hello, Tin-Tin.
ANGLE ON TIN-TIN - AS HE RISES (FROM RATSO)
trying to process what he sees.
And cover.
And buy time.
TIN-TIN
Little early from trick-or-treat,
homie.
(re: Ratso)
This dick trying to bushwack me.
ERIC
Murderer.
Tin-Tin blows out a breath.
No bluff.
Time to kill again.
TIN-TIN
Guess you got that goddamn right.
He shrugs.
The shrug becomes the launch of a knife.
TIGHT SHOT - MOVING - ERIC
His black-gloved hand slaps away the incoming knife and inch from
his nose.
It CLATTERS.
Eric continues striding toward Tin-TIn.
ERIC
Try harder.
Try again.
SHIFTING ANGLE - ERIC NEARS TIN-TIN
as Tin-TIn throws another knife.
Eric closing in.
He claps
hand together, immobilizing the next knife.
Opens his hands,
almost an "oops" gesture.
Keeps on coming.
ANGLE - ERIC AND TIN-TIN
As they meet.
Tin-Tin attempts a roundhouse.
Eric blocks it
and smashes Tin-Tin into the alley wall.
ERIC
A year ago.
Halloween.
A man
and a woman.
In a loft.
You
helped to murder them.
TIN-TIN
Last Halloween, eh?
Yeah...
(beat)
Yeah, I remember.
I fucked her
too, I think.
ERIC
You cut her.
You raped her.
(rage)
You watched!
TIN-TIN
Hey, I got my rocks off, so
fuck you in the ass, man.
They're face-to-face now, sweaty and tense.
Eric peels off
the Tragedy mask.
ERIC
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
TIN-TIN
I don't know you...
But, as Eric bears down on Tin-TIn, Tin begins to recognize him.
Fear.
Sweat.
For the first time, Tin-Tin starts to loose control.
TIN-TIN (CONT'D)
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
EXTREME CLOSE-UP - ERIC

A MEDIUM SHOT as lightning strikes; a storm brews.

Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework.

Eric's hands discard a hairbrush there.
He moves off.

The storm boils.
Eric framed in broken window.
CLOSER ANGLE - ERIC IN WINDOW

Firm-wrapped.
Tight-wired.
The trenchcoat

His shadowy face framed by the upturned
collar, his hair punkish and spiky.

The crow lights on his shoulder.
ERIC
All right, bad guys...
FRONT VIEW - ERIC
Full crow regalia.
Face makeup streamlined.
Eric's eyes flash.

PULL BACK swiftly, vertiginously, as Eric swan dives from the
window, his voice a howl.
UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S FALL
Coat, wing-like.
MATCH his dive yell with o.s. crow SCREECH.
SLOW MOTION as Eric fills the frame and we --
DISSOLVE TO:
Cop lights bounce, competing with the trash fires.
Albrecht and
several other UNIFORMS assess the double-death scene.
A

TORRES
Couldn't have happened to a nicer
couple.
ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND TORRES OVER DEAD TIN-TIN
Tin-Tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of
him.
Dead Ratso, b.g., where he fell.
ALBRECHT
Sure it coulda.
Funboy's not
here, neither is T-Bird -- none
of Top Dollar's number ones.
TORRES
You know, you sure got a hard-on for
a guy that's guilty of zip on
paper.
Top Dollar runs Showtime;
what's the matter, don't you like
adult entertainment?
ALBRECHT
This sack of shit is called Tin-
Tin.
TORRES
Don't any of your little pals have
real, grown up names?
ALBRECHT
He was a runner for Top Dollar.
Just muscle.
TORRES
Was.
ALBRECHT
(sigh)
This isn't Top Dollar's style
anyway.
This was somebody else.
Somebody new.
Albrecht lights a fresh smoke.
Torres waves the smoke away.
TORRES
And you're gonna tell me who.
ALBRECHT
Who ever made that.
Albrecht points.
CAMERA FOLLOWS to wall behind Tin-Tin.
A crow
silhouette has been daubed in blood there, now dry.
TORRES
What in the hell... do you
call that?
ALBRECHT
I call it blood, Detective.
If
you want, you can call it graffiti.

Eric silhouetted, unmoving as
the whole store front blows hellaciously out around him, raining
glass and debris.
Stirring his hair.
Eric is the black eye of
the fireball.
LOW ANGLE - FRONT OF PAWN SHOP - EMPHASIZE ERIC
lit by flames and residual explosions.
He hurls the shotgun
into the inferno.
Casually brushes flaming/smoking detritus
from his own clothes.
ALBRECHT (O.S.)
Don't move! I said don't move.
NEW ANGLE - ERIC
as he turns slowly, to see Albrecht, out of reach, gun drawn.
Eric's attitude lightens; Albrecht is not the threat here.
ERIC
I thought the police always said
"freeze:.
Albrecht divides his attention, jumpy, between the odd sight of
Eric (guitar on his back), and the raging instant inferno of
Gideon's.
ALBRECHT
I'm the police and I say don't
move, Snow White.
You're under
arrest; I don't care what else is
wrong with you!
You move and
you're dead.
Eric has begun to pace towards Albrecht.
Palms up.
A gesture of
submission.
Albrecht's battle calm begins to waiver.
ERIC
And I say I'm dead... and I move.
ALBRECHT
No further.
I'm serious.
Eric bows, bringing his forehead in line with the gun's muzzle.
ERIC
Then shoot, if you will.
TIGHT ANGLE - ALBRECHT
He gives it up.
Can't shoot.
This is too weird for him.
ALBRECHT
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
NEW ANGLE - LESS THREATENING - ERIC AND ALBRECHT
ERIC
You must listen carefully:
the
Fire Department will be here soon.
There is an injured man in the
alley who needs assistance.
(meaningfully)
As Shelly Webster once needed your
assistance, and as you are shortly
going to need my assistance.
Albrecht gestures casually, almost comically, with his pointed
gun.
B.g., the crow lands on a fire escape to monitor them.
ALBRECHT
You wanna run that back for me one
time?
SIRENS near, o.s.
Eric listens to them, to the night.
ERIC
Listen:
Top Dollar.
He "owns the
street here."
He will "erase
my ass."
ALBRECHT
You don't say.
ERIC
I know Top Dollar has turned your
streets into his hell.
ALBRECHT
Fucking A, my friend.
ERIC
The others are called Skank, T-
Bird.
Street names.
Funboy.
(beat)
Watch me, office Albrecht.
Eric lifts a chunk of glass from the sidewalk.
Slow and easy.
Albrecht doesn't completely trust him.
Up comes the gun.
ALBRECHT
Watch it...
Eric slices open his palm.
Blood flows.
To his fingertips.
NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT
as Eric quickly daubs a crow silhouette in blood on the wall...
then exhibits the gashed hand to Albrecht.
CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND
as the blood retreats and the wound seals itself up.
TIGHT ON ALBRECHT
and the silhouette.
Mouth hangs.
ALBRECHT
You're the one who did Tin-Tin...
PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame.
Albrecht does
a quick 180.
No Eric.
Flashbars from incoming units begin
to bounce red and blue off his face.
ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
Great.
Good night.
Guy shows up
looking like a mime from hell.
(beat)
Least he didn't do that "walking
against the wind" shit;
I hate
that.
A night-owl pornucopia.
T-Bird enters beneath a garish theater
marquee.
The 2-bill:
RUMP ROMP with BUTTBUSTERS II.
Taking in the street, the Pit, and a little girl seated on an
abandoned car.
ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - ON ELLY.
Seated on the looted wheelless car, playing with a small doll.
CLOSER ANGLE - ON ELLY
She doesn't notice someone is watching her yet.
TIGHT ON DOLL, THEN ELLY
She looks up o.s. at Eric, who is still out of the frame.
ELLY
What are you supposed to be?
A clown?
CLOSE-UP - ERIC
He smiles for what seems to be the first time.
Warm, even past
his crow makeup.
ERIC
Sometimes.
He glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not
in a big hurry just now.
Turns back to Elly.
WIDE ANGLE - ERIC AND ELLY
ELLY
You look like a rock star without a
job.
ERIC
I dabble.
May I?
He indicates the car hood, a "seat" next to Elly from which he
may observe the Pit.
ELLY
If you're not some kinda child
molester.
Eric looks behind himself.
Who, me?
Genuinely amused.
He
shakes his head no and sits down next to Elly.
Still hanging by the car, a bit more familiar with each other
now.
A low-slung mirror-windowed LIMOUSINE hisses past them and
curbs across the street from the Pit.
ELLY
My mom works over there.
I'm
waiting for her, but she's
probably with him, right now.
ERIC
Who?
ELLY
Mister Funboy.
ERIC
Mister Funboy lives there?
TWO SHOT - ELLY AND ERIC - (PIT B.G.)
ELLY
He has a room, upstairs.
I don't
like him very much.
Elly is not happy about this.
B.G. we see Grange get out of the
car, heading to the Pit, and notice in passing a guy with the
white face talking to the little girl down on the block.
ELLY (CONT'D)
Can you play that thing or do you
just carry it around everywhere?
Elly indicates the guitar strapped to Eric' back.
ERIC
I can pick out a tune now
and again.
ELLY
Can you play "Teddy Bears' Picnic?"
(re: doll)
It used to be her favorite.
ERIC
Does she have a name?
ELLY
No name.
You sure ask a lot of
questions.
Elly HANDS the doll to Eric and he experiences a wholly
unexpected flash.
FLASH:
Elly and SHelly sitting as SHelly's vanity, goofing with
makeup, test-driving lipstick, the doll visible on the vanity.
FLASH ENDS.

Pain is trying to fight it's way out of Eric in surges.
ELLY (OS)
(smart alec)
Hel-lo?
Earth to anybody...?
Eric snaps out of it.
Elly retrieves the doll.
ELLY (CONT'D)
Do you feel okay.
ERIC
No.
ELLY
You gotta go now, I bet.
ERIC
I have to go.
Half-zomboid, half-determined, he exits.
Eric's gloved hand slides sinuously up rusted railing.
Albrecht hasn't gone three steps before Eric appears behind him,
cat silent, matching pace.
NB:
Eric has got a new black rock-n-roll shirt on... and a
shell casing from Funboy's gun tied in his hair.
ERIC
Freeze.
Albrecht startles; drops his file.
Nearly draws his gun.
ALBRECHT
Jeezus!
Don't ever do that, man!
Albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down.
Eric waits.
ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
I told you cops don't say
"freeze".
He retrieves Eric's doctored photo from the spill of papers.
ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
You, my friend, are dead.
I saw
your body.
You got buried.
ERIC
I saw it, too.
Albrecht gathers up the file.
Eric stands there.
We realize he
is hesitant about touching the file.
ERIC (CONT'D)
Walk with me.
As Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk.
ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT ON THE STREET
ALBRECHT
You died, man.
I can't believe it
but here you are.
Last year,
you and your girlfriend --
ERIC
I need you to tell me what you
remember.
What happened to us?
ALBRECHT
You went out the window.
She was
beaten and raped.
She died in the
hospital.
They stop.
Eric didn't know this.
Fixes Albrecht with a look.
ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
Hey, you asked, man.
(beat)
She held on for thirty hours in
intensive care.
Hemorrhage,
trauma.
He body just finally
gave it up.
(beat; regret)
I saw it and couldn't do jack for
her.
Eric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines.
Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with
his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes.
TIGHT ON ERIC - ALBRECHT AGAINST WALL
We see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the
Flash.
NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT
And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own
head.
His crow face slacked in realized horror.
ALBRECHT
You okay, man?
I mean, what just
happened.
ERIC
The venom of bad memories.
You
were there; you saw her.
I saw
you seeing her.
Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette.
ALBRECHT
You gotta understand -- I was
hoping she'd talk, give me a lead,
a clue, something to work with.
But she only said one thing to me
before she died.
Eric lowers his head, penitent.
ERIC
My name.
ALBRECHT
(fizzles)
I'm sorry as hell, man.
ERIC
Thirty hours.
A day of life, plus
change...
TIGHT TWO-SHOT - ALBRECHT AND ERIC
Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single
contemplative puff from it.
ERIC
Halloween is coming, soon.
You
will have Top Dollar if you watch
for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
ALBRECHT
I should be trying to stop you.
Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette.
ERIC
Thank you.
For giving a damn.
ALBRECHT
My pleasure.
ERIC
Don't smoke these.
As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and
simultaneously ducks out of frame.
ANGLE - ALBRECHT TURNS
to see a blank building wall.
Fire escape.
Darkness.
No Eric.
He does a full 360 degree turn.
Eric is gone again.
ALBRECHT
Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that.
MOVING ANGLE - FROM BUS ROOF
Coat flapping, Eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves
away from Albrecht's position.
A LONG SHOT of the T-Bird parked across the street from the
store as two figures -- T-Bird and Skank -- approach on the
store side.
SKANK
I wish to hell I had torched
Gideon's, that fat fuck.
T-BIRD
I wish to hell I knew who it was
that made Tin-Tin into a voodoo
doll last night.
ANGLE - CLOSER ON T-BIRD AND SKANK - STREET LEVEL
They stop walking.
Look at each other and sanctimoniously cross
themselves.
Tin-Tin's big R.I.P. moment.
T-Bird indicates the
liquor store.
T-BIRD
We need some smokes and some road
beers.
SKANK
Got it.
Skank hustles toward the store.
T-Bird crosses to the car.
ANGLE - T-BIRD - THROUGH CAR WINDOWS
WIDEN ANGLE to include the car as he nears it.
Behind him, two
12-year-old KIDS, AXEL and CHOPPER, enter the store after Skank,
one wearing a long duster.
as T-Bird climbs in, digs the last cigarette from his pack,
snaps his Zippo and in the sudden orange light, sees:
INSERT - REARVIEW MIRROR
Eric's purloined Strat in the back sear reflecting the light.
ANGLE - T-BIRD
He tries to spin and draw his gun but Eric is upon him, nestling
one of Tin-Tin's throwing knives right inside T-Bird's ear.
T-BIRD
What the fuck are you supposed to
be, man?!
INSERTS:
Eric liberates T-Bird's automatic from the shoulder
holster; Eric's hand closes T-Bird's door for him.
ERIC
I'm your passenger.
You drive.
And stop talking.
TIGHT ANGLE - T-BIRD'S HANDS
on ignition key and gearshift, making ready.
As ordered.
as the car burns up the obstacle course of pavement, kicking
wake of litter.
PEDESTRIANS scurry to clear the way.
as the cruiser roars out to give chase.
A 3-way pursuit until the T-Bird reaches the outskirts of the
city.
All quiet... until the T-Bird ZOOMS past frame.
The lead cop
tries to duplicate the T-Bird's corner-cut and starts spinning.
It clips a light pole.
Rebounds into the path of MJ's unit.
as MJ's unit broadsides the first cop car.
The T-bird careens through dockside silence, alone, then
fishtails, SCREECHING, to a lung-compressing halt.
A HIGH ANGLE of the car as Eric opens the trunk.
ERIC'S POV - The Trunk.
loaded with plastique, canisters, timers, arson paraphernalia.
ERIC
All gone.
ANGLE - T-BIRD REACHES DOCKSIDE
Lifting off and blowing all to hell, a billion smithereens of
phosphorescent firs pattering into the dark water.
It hits.
Sinks.
Weird flare glow as the car quickly submerges.
ANGLE - ERIC
heaving the gun into the distant water.
Plosh.
He produces T-
Bird's accelerator.
Squirts it into the ground.
He
prestidigitates and T-Bird's Zippo appears in his hand.
He
flicks it and drops it into the flammable puddle.
HIGH LONG SHOT - ERIC
walking slowly out of the scene as the firepool coalesces into
a burning crow shape.
EXTREME CLOSE of a Pignose Amp.
More soft GUITAR strokes as
CAMERA FOLLOWS a patchwork a taped-together, jerry-rigged
cables to:
ANGLE - ERIC ON ROOF -- shirtless, crosslegged, his Crow make-up
streaked by the night's work.
His fingering is unsure and he
tries the tune again.
INSERT - We she Shelly's engagement ring on a leather thong
around Eric's neck.
Like an amulet.
ANGLE - ERIC PLAYING
He's got it right this time.
Strong, sure CHORDS.
Passionate.
We can almost imagine him conjuring Shelly via musical sorcery.
He holds a stroke, letting it ring.
Sun rises behind him.
IRATE VOICE (O.S.)
Hey, shut the fuck up!
Eric's eyes, closed with the moment, dart left.
Funny.
Later.
Elly is seated on a stool..
Mickey gives her a chili
dog.
MICKEY
Chili dog for breakfast... it's
original.
ELLY
Mom tried to cook.
MICKEY
Oh.
CUSTOMER (O.S.)
Hey, Mickey, I need a special
with everything.
No sawdust.
MICKEY
(to Elly)
Everyone's a comedian.
Enjoy.
Mickey EXITS FRAME.
GRANGE (O.S.)
You're Elly, right?
I know your
mom.
Elly turns.
Grange sits next to her.
Lao's mirrored-windowed car
is parked across the street, b.g.
ELLY
A lot of people "know" my mom.
Grange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey.
GRANGE
I know your friend, too -- the one
that looks like a rock star.
ELLY
I don't know you.
GRANGE
(easily)
I'd like to get in touch with him.
Elly sizes Grange up.
ELLY
You're not a cop, either.
What do
you want him for?
GRANGE
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
ELLY
Right.
Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across
the countertop to Mickey.
ELLY (CONT'D)
You buying?
(cuts him some slack)
He kinda wanders around.
You'll
see him if you pay attention.
GRANGE
I need to find him kind of soon,
Elly.
A phantom GRAFFITI ARTIST is spray-painting a crow shape on the
condemned building right across the street.
As Top turns from the window,
PULL BACK to incorporate the
chunky shadows where the lights don't fall.
Eric is there,
perched on the narrow exterior ledge...but we don't know it
until he opens his eyes, two dots of white in the blackness.
Damaged from the wreck, limping home, piloted by our pals Speeg
and MJ.
Skank smashes down into the roof, imploding the
flashbar and windshield.
MJ drenches his lap in fresh coffee.
MJ
OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH!
ANGLE - SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET - ON ALBRECHT
who watches with slow marvel from the shadows
ALBRECHT
Jesus Christ...
He runs to assist the demolished cruiser.
Picking up Eric on his dive through the window, bullets chasing
him.
Immediate police fire from below sparks off the ironwork.
Eric ducks slugs balletically and scampers to the roof.
ANGLE - SHOWTIME ROOFTOP EDGE
Eric somersaults over.
Bullets chip brick in his wake.
STREET LEVEL - UP ANGLE TOWARD ROOF.
Showtime girded police cars and MARKSMEN, Eric a distant
shadow figure above.
Here comes a TEAM LEADER with a bullhorn.
TEAM LEADER (FILTERED)
On the roof!
Keep firing!
Keep

A fury of law enforcement ordnance cuts loose all around him.
RESUMING ERIC ON SHOWTIME ROOF EDGE
A forearm up against the fusillade.
Below him --
ANGLE - PIT FRONT FIRE ESCAPE
Here come Lead SWAT and his Merry MEN.
MOVING ANGLE - WITH ERIC - ADJACENT ROOFTOP
Eric runs for it.
Half a story higher.
He hits the wall and
skitters up, gripping tiny cracks in the brickwork.
ANGLE - RESUMING MEN ON FRONT SHOWTIME FIRE ESCAPE.
Lead SWAT hesitates -- because of what he sees.
LEAD SWAT
Holy shit, it's spiderman.
He tries to pull a bead and fires too late.
LEAD SWAT (CONT'D)
What're you boy scouts staring at!
Let's Go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
MOVING ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON NEXT ROOF
He sprints to the far edge and dives to the next lower rooftop.
As he lands he is nailed by a helicopter spotlight, boring in
from behind and above the row of buildings.
MOVING ANGLE - THE STREET BELOW
COPS below, COPS in the chopper, everyone rushing parallel to
Eric, trying to keep up.
ERIC'S POV - THE STREET, THE HELICOPTER
PAN QUICK to the next ledge.
COPS right behind him on the roof
as well.
WITH ERIC - AS HE RUNS TO THE EDGE.
and finds a void waiting there.
No connecting building.
ANOTHER MOVING ANGLE - ERIC
staying ahead of the search light.
A fantastic series of artful
moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof.
ANGLE - SWAT MEN ON NEXT ROOF
sighting Eric as the light picks him out.
Eric glances at
them... then jumps.
CHOPPER PILOT (O.S./FILTERED)
He's off the roof.
We can't see
him.
CLOSE-UP - LEAD SWAT
pulling his weapon off target, because there is not target.
LEAD SWAT
Dammit to hell!

Come on.
ANGLE - ALLEY - STREET LEVEL
Eric lands like a falling safe, scattering garbage.
But he's
okay, up and running.
ANGLE - ERIC'S RUNNING POV - END OF ALLEY
as his escape is cut off by a police car that screeches to a
stop, blocking the exit.
ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC
as he backpedals, scanning for an alternate escape.
ALBRECHT
(from car)
Come on!
CLOSER ANGLE
- POLICE CAR
We can see Albrecht.
Eric dives inside and the car burns rubber.
It hangs a turn and their escape is made.
ERIC (O.S.)
They couldn't do anything for me.
ALBRECHT (O.S.)
How 'bout the morgue?
ERIC (O.S.)
No.
I have one more thing to do.
Lonelier, less traffic, more deserted.
ANGLE - ON ALBRECHT AND ERIC THROUGH WINDSHIELD - TRAVELLING
ALBRECHT
You're gonna kill somebody else.
(beat; no response)
We're gonna stop and get a shit-load
of Band-Aids?
Eric is obviously fighting to stay centered, stay conscious.
His last fight has caused him a great deal of damage, taken a
lot out of him.
He needs to recharge.
ERIC
I have to prepare for an
anniversary.
This coming night.
HOLD on their two kinds of determination. as we
DISSOLVE TO:
High blue sky.
It might even be pretty if it wasn't Detroit.
Blowing wind.
TRICK-OR-TREATERS wisp past.
Ghosts, witches,
demons out for Halloween.
ANGLE - CEMETERY FENCE

A
fire engine wails past in the opposite direction.

Strictly downscale building.
Elly to Gabriel"
ELLY
You're gonna like it here.
A car curbs across the street as she enters the building.
ANGLE - PUSH IN ON CAR
as the window cranks down to reveal Grange at the wheel.
Dark clouds have gathered to highlight the sunset.
Eric plays
the guitar - LOUD, the SHelly theme in a major key.
Where
before it was wandering, uncertain, now it's bold and
heartbreaking.
Definitive.
Pain replaced by strength and a
sense of homecoming.
As Eric gets to the end of it, the notes are flying out... At
the climax, rips the guitar up over his head and brings it
down -- SMASH -- on the Pignose.
He's finished here.
ROOF EDGE - FROM STREET
as the broken guitar SAILS OUT over the building edge.
Eric marches along in plain view since everyone around him seems
to be in costume.
The wind whips his coat.
KIDS bustle around
him with trick-or-treat bags.
The crow perched on his shoulder.
ERIC'S POV - CITY SKYLINE
Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning.
ANGLE - ERIC WALKING
A fire engine races past on the street.
He steps out in its
wake and crosses over to --
MEDIUM MOVING SHOT - THE CEMETERY
waiting for him as he crosses to the fence.
Beyond the fence,
in the distance, the church looms.
ANGLE - ERIC
He pauses.
A KID in a Creature from the Black Lagoon mask
comes, passes Eric, then comes back for a touch.
CREATURE KID
Trick or treat!
Eric smiles.
Not tonight.
Eric is standing over the grave of Shelly Webster, looking down.
He holds for a moment then moves on.
Eric ascends toward giant oak doors, tres Gothique.
The crow
flaps past, leading him.
NEW ANGLE - TOP OF STEPS -- where waits the Skull Cowboy.
As
Eric approaches, the Skull Cowboy interposes himself between
Eric and the huge double doors.
Eric glares up, defiant.
Moves up the steps.
The Skull Cowboy
extends a skeletal hand.
STOP.
SKULL COWBOY
Stop screwing around.
TIGHT ON ERIC
Angry, ready to battle:
You talking to me?
SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D)
Your job is done.
You interfere
with the living again.
ERIC
Tell me I'll get hurt.
That I
might die.
(beat)
I've already done that.
I don't
need anyone's help.
Yours
included.
STAIR ANGLE - ERIC AND SKULL COWBOY
Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them.
SKULL COWBOY
Do this thing and you will be
vulnerable.
The blood will not
return.
(beat)
No powers.
No reunion.
Nothing.
ERIC
Fine with me.
He ADVANCES a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast.
SKULL COWBOY
You'll be alone.
ERIC
I'm already alone.
Eric, eyes steely, stares down the Skull Cowboy.
ERIC
Don't waste my time.
SKULL COWBOY
Very well, it's your ass.
And the wind kicks up around them both, powerfully.
ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY (EFFECT)
As the force of the storm dust-devils around him and begins to
disassemble him.
The fire in his eye sockets goes out.
His hat
flies off an is pulverized by the wind.
The garments begin to
disintegrate and blow around, rotten cerements falling apart in
mid-air.
ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS -- transfixed by this unexpected
development.
A shard of the Skull Cowboy blows past Eric's face
and transmutes to dust!
RESUME SKULL COWBOY AT TOP OF STEPS (EFFECT)
Transparent, ancient bones, crumbling and blowing away.
ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS
As Eric lunges for what's left of his mysterious, smart-ass
mentor
CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S LUNGING HAND
Meeting only a swirl of vaporous dust where the Skull Cowboy's
heart would have been.
TIGHT ANGLE - ERIC ON STEPS
He has time to register the dust in his palm before it, too,
renders down to nothingness,
leaving a vague green glow that
dies.
And as he looks to the sky --
UP ANGLE - THE CROW
flapping down to land on Eric's shoulder.
Eric is astonished.
ERIC
But why are you still here?
CLOSE-UP - THE CROW
No answer in the crow's eyes.
RESUME AND FOLLOW ERIC
That's good enough for Eric.
He marches to the double doors and
shoves them back.
Albrecht digs through a sling bag of weaponry, trying to
simultaneously monitor the peephole, muttering sotto to
himself.
ALBRECHT
Had to go get yourself hip-deep in
shit, didn't you, my friend.
It begins to rain.
Albrecht glances resentfully toward the
sky.
ALBRECHT (CONT'D)
Give it a rest, huh?
A hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under.
CUTS LOOSE on
full auto into the Madonna on the window.
Albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily
destroyed all around his position.
Chunks of the window
continue to disintegrate.
Lao SNAPS Elly's free handcuff to the dimly glowing
lightning
rod and advances, one foot on either side of the peak of the
roof, his blade brandished.
CLOSE MOVING SHOT - ERIC -- Hands up to grapple, but
weaponless.
He spiders to meet Lao, suddenly PICKING UP SPEED
and RUNNING along the precarious peak.
Lao sees him coming, braces to strike, but Eric executes a BROAD
FLYING LEAP right over Lao's head.
ERIC LANDS, SLIPS, sprawls sideways, clinging to the peak of the
roof.
Lao hurries in to slash with the blade, as Eric averts.
The steel RINGS.
Eric converts his dodge into a low spin kick
that DUMPS Lao.
Eric SPREAD-EAGLES to keep from falling.
Distantly, Lao
similarly saves himself.
NEW ANGLE -- THE FIGHT -- Here comes Lao, crabbing back toward
the peak.
Eric ROLLS to Elly's position, GRABS the lightning
rod and tries to wrest it loose.
SIZZLE OF FLESH as Eric's hands are scorched: the metal is still
blue-hot.
MOVING WITH LAO as Eric battles to free the lightning rod.
Lao
closes up distance, gives a warcry and prepares to swing as -
Eric WRENCHES the rod loose and turns to deflect Lao's blow.
The weapons spark as they meet... and there goes Elly, her
handcuff freed, SLIDING DOWN THE ROOF SLOPE.
ANGLE
-- ROOF SLOPE -- WITH ERIC
as he dodges Lao by using the
lightning rod to vault down to where Elly is about to slip off
the roof.
With the rod embedded in the roof, Eric hangs on, and elly hangs
on to Eric.
UP ANGLE -- LAO, a dark figure against the night sky, raising
the sword.
LAO
Face me!
Eric guides Elly to the top of one of the flying buttresses.
When he looks up, Lao is gone.
ANGLE - BELL TOWER -- Albrecht's head pokes up at last.
Looks
around, finally spots Eric below and to the left.
YELLS, serio-comic.
ALBRECHT
Is he dead yet?
INSERT - ALBRECHT'S HOLSTER as Lao's hand draws Albrecht's
gun quickly.
ANGLE - ALBRECHT AND LAO --Lao has blindsided Albrecht.
LAO
No.
You are.
He jams the gun into the base of ALbrecht's neck and fires three times.
CLOSE ANGLE - ERIC - He's too far away to matter.
Shock.
INSERT - ALBRECHT'S CIGARETTE as it rolls down the slope,
trailing sparks, snuffing out.
ANGLE - ERIC holding onto the lightning rod as lightning CUTS the
night above him.
ANGLE -- LAO AT BELL TOWER, triumphant and a bit wild, SHOUTING.
LAO
You've caused another death,
Mister Draven!
The girl will die
as well -- because of you!
ANGLE - ELLY ON FLYING BUTTRESS
The base of a triangle - Lao, Eric, Elly.
ELLY
You go to hell, you pervert!
RESUME ERIC
Rage over the loss of Albrecht.
He RISES, hurting but mad as
hell.
GLARES UP toward Lao.
ERIC
And how many lives have you destroyed?
LAO
I took yours from you.
Your
little girlfriend?
I took hers,
too.
Your meaningless, petty
life?
I took it so that tonight
your existence might gain a
purpose.
You're no avenger.
You're mine.
PUSH IN TIGHT ON ERIC.
Eyes alight with hatred for Lao.
ERIC
(to himself)
You're right, I'm not an avenger.
Not any more.
As lightning strikes, Eric Fires his gaze TOWARD THE SKY.
HIGH ANGLE - LAO ON ROOFTOP - ("CROWVISION")
SEEING the crash dive toward Lao through the row's eyes.
ANGLE
- LAO ON ROOFTOP
As the crow wings down INTO FRAME and lights on Lao's head, CLAWING!
CLOSE-UP -- THE CROW ON LAO'S HEAD slashing with its claws.
Pecking out Lao's eyes.
WITH ERIC -- on the roofslope as he totters but maintains his
climb, the crow/Lao UPFRAME B.G.
RESUME LAO -- as the crow abandons him.
Lao STAGGERS AND FALLS
down the roof - toward Eric.
SLANTED ANGLE -- ERIC AND LAO -- Eric ARRESTS Lao's fall,
fisting lapels and bringing him nose to nose.
Fury.
ERIC
Time for a sacrifice.
Lao's face is a hideous bloody mask with black holes where the
eyes used to be.
He smiles gruesomely.
LAO
I don't need eyes to take what I
want from you.
He EMBRACES Eric and RAMS the killing blade deep into Eric's
back!
ON ERIC as he looks down to see the blade protruding from his
sternum.
Tight grimace.
A lot of pain.
ERIC
Can you fly?
He pulls Lao into a BACKWARD ROLL down the roof, HOLDING HIM
TIGHT.
MOVING ANGLE -- INTERCUTS -- ERIC AND LAO FALL
Eric lands on his back, forcing the blade THROUGH himself and
INTO Lao.
Eric completes the roll and KICKS Lao off INTO SPACE,
the killing blade still embedded in him!
WITH LAO as crashes, sliding, sprawling down PAST Elly's
position.
Gets to his knees atop the flying buttress.
Sees the
blade in his own chest.
CLOSE-UP - ELLY - she sees it all happen.
RESUME LAO - a regretful look toward Eric.
He PLUMMETS off the
roof edge.
ANGLE - ERIC SLIDES DOWN ROOF --
He slows, stopping when Elly
is in frame.
He clutches his own chest.
Regards his own
shaking hand, drenched in his won blood.
Glazed.
ON ELLY, as she finally gets the duct tape off her mouth, trying
to get to Eric.
She flails and cries out.
ELLY
Don't let me fall!
CLOSE-UP -- their hands finally meet and GRASP TIGHT.
A low angle TRACKING SHOT (as when we first met Elly).
Eric's and Elly's feet pass graves.
Eric's pace is slow, crippled,
limping.
They STOP at a grave where elly BENDS INTO FRAME to steal
the flowers there.
Eric is bloody and out of it.
She helps him walk.
ELLY
Now do you get to see her? Shelly, I mean.
ERIC
In a better place.
I hope.
ELLY
You're not gonna come back, are you?
Eric's response is halting and uncertain.
But he tries to give
her hope.
He reaches for Shelly's ring around her neck, holds
it up to her.
ERIC
I don't know if I can.
But you
have this... and you know where to come.
ELLY
You mean you'll, like' dig your way
out of the grave?
Euww.
Eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries.
He grasps Elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss
her on the forehead.
ERIC
For you, I'll try.
Promise.
MOVE WITH ERIC
Spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never
going to make it the few yards back to his own grave.
So close.
His legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus.
One
groping hand tries to drag him further.
ERIC
Leave me now.
ANGLE - ELLY
Tears on her face.
She can't watch this.
She TURNS and drops
the flowers on Shelly's grave.
ERIC'S POV - HIS OWN GRAVE
Still too far away to matter.
RESUME ERIC ON GROUND
He gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat
before SHELLY'S HAND intrudes INTO FRAME to GRASP his hand.
No ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near-dead Eric's
blank-faced astonishment, and he moves forward.
ANGLE - ELLY - SHELLY'S GRAVE BG
She struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly
wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve.
She turns
toward Eric's grave.
Then, surprised, she looks close.
ANGLE - ERIC'S GRAVE
Eric is gone.
The white rose lies neatly on the top of the
undisturbed
earth there.
HIGH ANGLE - CEMETERY
Emphasizing that Elly is now ALONE in the graveyard.
LOW ANGLE on Elly, ROSE in the foreground --
She walks OFF.
HOLD the rose.
CUT TO:
An UP ANGLE from Eric's grave toward the tree as the crow FLIES
INTO FRAME and perches there, shucking water.
PUSH IN on the
crow.
Watching.
Waiting.
SLOW FADE TO DEAD BLACK.
