Joan hurries out of the house and runs down the drive-

JOAN
Socorro!! Wait a minute!
I want
to talk to you!
The Low-Rider comes to a stop. Joan approaches the pas-
senger window and leans down to Socorro:
JOAN
Excuse me, Socorro, but do you
mind if I ask what's happening,
why are you leaving?
SOCORRO
No se, lo siento.

SOCORRO
It's my understanding

BALTO
Yeah, but she got her time off,

Joan straightens up, sighing angrily and looking up at
the house:
JOAN
Well, this is just glorious.
The low-rider moves down the driveway and as it disap-
pears onto the street, Joan moves to an electric box
atop a metal column at the edge of the driveway. She
presses the button and looks at the gates. They remain
open. She steps over to the gates and tries to close them
manually. The locking device fails to engage and a
portion of it falls off into the bushes.
ANOTHER ANGLE
As she leans
down to look for the fallen part,
a pickup
truck can be
seen parked down the street. The

driver's head
(BUTCH GABLE) can be seen and on

Giving up on the gates, Joan turns and moves with evident
reluctance up the driveway, passing a three-car garage in
which her Mercedes and another car hidden under a trap can
be seen.

HARRY
Now, in regard to any

seeking to give you a
bad time, I
want to show you what
you can
expect from a dog of
this caliber.
He takes hold of the dog's muzzle, lifting the lips to
reveal the large scimitar-like canines:
HARRY
Here we have the dog's arsenal, so
to speak. The animal is trained
to apply pressure to specific
points of the body until the bone
is more or less crushed.
(releasing the
muzzle)
If the attacker is bearing a
weapon of any kind, be it a gun, a
club, a knife or what-have-you,
the dog will, excuse me for
saying...
("politely"
indicating
his crotch)
... automatically go for the
testicles.
JOAN
Oh god, what if I don't want him
to do that?
HARRY
You want him to do that.
JOAN
No, I just want him to scare
someone.
HARRY
Believe
me, this will scare them,
as well
as incapacitate their mind
and any
ability to maneuver
against
you.
JOAN
You know, I have an extremely
sensitive reaction to dog dander,
so maybe I shouldn't...

Let me ask you something. I like

JOAN
I'm in the process of a divorce
and I moved up here because my
apartment was burglarized and...
(suddenly
mistrustful)
But I'm not entirely alone,
there's a housekeeper here, and
several friends.
HARRY
Well, the hills are hit heaven as
far as burglaries go. And right
up on Mulholland is where they
found the fifth victim of the
Westside Slasher...
JOAN
No, please, don't tell me about
that.
HARRY
Believe me, I know what you're up
against, being an attractive, and
I take it, unattached woman, such
as you are...
(flicking his
cigarettte away)
But we're going to remedy that
situation right now, and get you

She holds Duke on a short lead, and as they move along a
wooded area of the grounds, he leans in close, directing
her in confidential tones:
HARRY
Alright now, Joan, give him the
command, 'Duke, wachen sie.'
JOAN
Duke, wachen sie.
HARRY
Good.
The dog is now on alert.
As they walk, Harry glances about, impressed with the
appearance of wealth inherent in the house and grounds:
HARRY
This is really a nice piece of
real estate you've got here.
JOAN
(tense and
distracted)
It's not mine, it's my sister's.
HARRY
Oh, it's your sister's.

They move forward a few feet, when Harry, now slightly

of some trees several yards ahead of them.
June, in a padded attack suit, suddenly jumps out from
behind the trees, assuming an aggressive stance and
emitting a repertory of menacing sounds.
JOAN
HARRY
Oh my God!
Duke, fasse!
Duke responds immediately, lunging toward June, pulling
Joan along with him. June screams and starts to run
away. Harry moves after Joan, yelling ahead to June:
HARRY
Dammit, June, don't exhibit fear
until I tell you!
Seeing the dog still in pursuit, June ignores the command
and as Duke continues to tow Joan behind him:
HARRY (CONT'D)
Get him under control now, Joan.
JOAN
I am...
(struggling
with Duke)
Good boy, be nice.
HARRY
Give him the off command!
JOAN
I forgot it!
You tell him!
Duke,

He hurries up behind her, grabbing her around the waist
to anchor her and addressing the dog:
HARRY
Duke, aus!
The dog instantly assumes a sitting position. Joan, out
of breath and exhilarated with fear and excitement, turns
to Harry:

Okay.

And Joan, I want you to know, it's

This is quality clientele. It

the house)
Just soak some of this in, will

He steps past her and goes to the van:

Soak this.
As he opens the back panel:
HARRY
Start to pattern yourself. Breed

Observe the woman, for Christ

with water.
EDDY
Don't do what?
JOAN
You're not supposed to look him
straight in the eye.
EDDY
You have a dog you can't look in
the eye, Joan?
JOAN
He's not just a dog. He's a
Schutzhund trained attack dog.
EDDY
Oh...
He steps back from the dog as Joan leans down to give
Duke some water from the cup.
JOAN
I was told to avoid a direct gaze
and always look at the base of the
right or the left ear.
EDDY
You don't have to go to all this

Joan and Harry come down the steps of the Inn. The sun

Under the following they cross the driveway to a low
fence railing off an Oriental garden.
JOAN
You know, it's very sad. I look
at my sister and all her marriages
and affairs, not to mention the
mess my own life is in, and I
think it's very sad and very bleak
that men and women can't manage to
be friends.
HARRY
It depends on the man and woman
you're talking about.
They arrive at the fence and as she speaks she rests one
of her hands on the railings:
JOAN
What a tragedy that sex is often
such a barrier to friendship
between men and women.
HARRY
There I disagree with you.
He places his hand over hers. She remains silent a
moment, restraining her response to the gesture. Then:
JOAN
You know Dante and Beatrice never
slept together.

Oh yeah, I forgot that part.

a mailbox in front of the broken gates.
She pauses to lavish the DOG with an exuberant display of
affection and finds herself intimidated as he responds by
leaping about and BARKING joyously:
JOAN
Alright now, don't play too rough.
The excitement has unleashed Duke's libido and as she
tries to resume her mission, he makes a few attempts to
rise against her flanks. Just before she approaches the
mailbox, he manages to grip his paws around one of her
thighs and unmistakably begins to hump her:
JOAN
No, no, Duke, don't do that,
that's not nice. Now sitz. And
behave yourself.
He sits, panting, with a furtive expression on his face,
watching as she steps over to the mailbox and opens it.
She takes out a number of letters and sorts through them
as she starts back to the house with Duke following.
They are in the main addressed to Andy, but in amongst
them she finds a bank statement addressed to her, as well
as a letter with her name written in pencil on the
envelope. She opens it, takes the contents out and stops
suddenly:

holding the envelope.
Turning around, he angrily stuffs it into his back pocket

From behind a sheet of
plywood resting against the back
wall of the garage, and
just visible in the darkness, a
man's hand can be seen
reaching to the handle of an ax in
amongst other gardening
tools in an iron rack.
Helen opens the passenger door and Joan whispers to her:
JOAN
Helen, quick, get in the car!
Helen leans down and looks in at her:
HELEN
What?
Looking in the
direction
of Joan's gaze she sees the dark
figure of a man
wearing a
hood over his head, stepping
out from behind
the sheet
of plywood, holding the ax in
his hand and as
he moves
toward the front of the car, she
screams.
He lifts the ax over his head and swings it down vio-
lently, cleaving the blade into the hood of the Mercedes.
(From inside the house, DUKE can be heard BARKING
furiously.)
Joan leaps from the car and in stark terror, runs out of
the garage toward the house. Stopped by the sounds of
HELEN'S HYSTERIA, she turns around to see her, hampered
by her crutches and unable to move.
ON the hooded man's eyes, shifting their homicidal intent
from Helen to Joan.
Joan runs back into the garage and frantically tries to
pull Helen away from her death grip on the door handle.
The man begins stalking around the front of the car
toward her. She grabs one of Helen's crutches and raises
it up as if to hit him. As he steps back to the ax and
tries to extract it from the hood, she suddenly rushes at
him and begins belaboring him with the crutch. He lifts
an arm to fend off the blows while his other hand con-
tinues to tug at the ax handle.
JOAN
Helen!
Help me!
HELEN
I can't!
I can't move!!
Raising both arms to protect himself, the man is forced
to give ground, moving further back into the garage, with
Joan continuing to batter at him. Then in a sudden burst
of rage he grabs hold of the crutch, yanks it from her
grasp and lunges at her.

(Helen SCREAMING OVER:) The hooded man has Joan up
against the garage wall. One of his hands is on her
throat and the other is held over her mouth. In the
struggle, she manages to sink her teeth into his hand.
He pulls it free and hits her across the face. She
reaches to a flower pot on a potting shelf and pole-axes
him on the top of the head. It staggers him briefly and
enables her to move out of his grasp. She immediately
grabs an iron rake from the garden rack and turns
fiercely toward him.
Now standing, vanquished, breathing hard, and apparently
having had enough, he begins to back away from her. When
he reaches a safe distance, he turns and moves quickly
off, disappearing into the dark.

Yeah.
Sure.

EDDY
We had a few drinks in your room.

And a certain intimacy took place.
She appears uncertain that she shares the same memory.

EDDY (CONT'D)
And when I asked to see you the next
*
night, you know what you said? You
*
were too tired and sleepy.
JOAN
That was witty of me.
EDDY
But you weren't. Because an hour
later, you went into Lewie's room
and you didn't come out.
JOAN
Well, if you remember, I was in
love with Lewis around that time,
which I confided to you, so you
did know...
EDDY
That's not the reason.
JOAN
Excuse me, Eddy, you just passed
the turn off to my street.
No response.
JOAN (CONT'D)
Eddy.
EDDY
I just want to drive a little, so
*
we can talk.
She sighs impatiently, then:

JOAN
Anyway,
if I remember correctly,
*
we only
kissed. But if that led
you to
believe something that hurt
you in
any way, I apologize.

What happened to your hand?

JOAN (CONT'D)
It looks like somebody bit you.
EDDY
Somebody did.
He returns his hand to the steering wheel. She looks at
him, with a slight smile, waiting for him to elaborate,
then:
JOAN
Well, am I supposed to guess, or
are you going to...
She breaks off, suddenly aware that the teeth marks are
her own:
JOAN
Oh, Eddy.

The Jeep pitches about on its shocks as it moves up an
incline graded slightly higher than the one already
giving Harry trouble. Eddy shifts into four-wheel.
Joan, jostled about by the uneven surface beneath them,
looks over at him:
JOAN
Why did you do these things?
EDDY
Because you deserved it.
JOAN
I didn't deserve it. I've always
thought of you and treated you as
one of my closest and dearest
friends...
EDDY
I use to think very highly of you,
too, but now I don't like what I
see. In fact, it's been very
disturbing to me, Joan.
(pauses, then)
Very disillusioning. To see that
before you've even gotten rid of
Lewie, you've started up with some
other man.
JOAN
Eddy, I want you to take me home
now.

The wheels of the van loose traction. Harry gets out and
looks up toward the taillights of Eddy's Jeep, disap-
pearing in the hazy distance. He looks for a rock and
finding one large enough, wedges it under one of the rear
tires. Then he quickly gets back into the van.

The Jeep pulls onto a large dirt promontory situated

The driver's door suddenly opens and Harry, in the heat
and fury of his jealousy, instantly begins berating her:
HARRY
Okay, what is this! What the hell
are you doing with this guy!
He reaches in and pulls Eddy away from Joan.
JOAN
Harry, look out!
The warning is simultaneous with an attempt by Eddy to
stab him with the knife.
HARRY
Jesus Christ...
He grabs Eddy's arm and in hauling him out of the car,
rips loose the sleeve of Eddy's shirt.

possessed of the prodigious strength of the psychotic.
Joan hurries around
the car. Harry, his cheek cut, is
trying to force the
knife out of Eddy's hand. She looks
toward Harry's van,
parked several yards behind Eddy's
car and immediately
runs over to it.

She pulls open the door and addressing the dog inside,

The shepherd jumps out of the car, runs past her to the
nearest bush and lifts his leg on it.

causing all three of them to land in the brush on an
incline at the side of road.

A frantic free-for-all takes place on the precarious
footing of the hillside, with Joan alternately pulling at
one and pushing at the other. The intensity and violence
of their struggle is such that she is knocked further
down the incline. Harry, quickly glances down the hill
to see if she is alright and is left open to severe blow
by Eddy, who breaks free and runs to his car.
Harry pursues him, catching him as he tries to get into
the car. He pushes him against the door and they begin
battering each other with a series of punches.
The SHEPHERD, wanting to join in the excitement, leaps
about them, BARKING joyously. Then finding Eddy's
sleeve, he takes it in his mouth and begins shaking it
vigorously.
Joan, her hair fretted
with twigs, climbs up over the
edge of the hill. In
the b.g. behind her, a HELICOPTER
APPROACHES. She looks
toward Harry and Eddy trading
blows, then climbs up
the rest of the way, and as she
gets to her feet, she
picks up a stone and throws it at
them, yelling:
JOAN
You bastards!!
The search beam of the COPTER spotlights Joan. She is
bent over, picking up sticks and stones and as if routing
a deadly enemy, she begins hurling them, as well as a
series of invectives, at the lights of the city below,
her words barely audible over the sound of the ROTORS.
The beam sweeps from her, to pick up Harry and Eddy and
an AMPLIFIED, God-like voice comes from above:

(from above)
What are you people doing down
there?
Joan turns back to Harry. He holds the now unconscious
Eddy by his shirt front and resuming his accusations,
starts to move toward Joan:
HARRY
Are you crazy?! What are you
doing, running around with a guy
like this!!
She raises her arm, ready to hurl the last stone:
JOAN
You maniacs!!
You liars!!
You
shits!!
