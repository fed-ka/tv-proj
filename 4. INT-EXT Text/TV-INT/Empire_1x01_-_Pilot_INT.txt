      A GIRL GROUP wails away at a microphone in a state of the art *
      recording studio. They sound as magical as Labelle and early *
      Whitney Houston. Angels sweating. Mind blowing.*

      They finish a stunning three-way harmonized belt, staring *
      toward the glass booth, anxious to hear the response from the 
      man inside...*

      LUCIOUS LYON, 52, charismatic, tough, wise, a superstar. 
      Wearing a gold chain over a white HANES T-shirt, he stares 
      down, gathering his thoughts. His concentration is intense. 
      He slowly lifts his head to give his verdict. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    It ain t there yet. *

      Their faces drop, they want to please him so bad. 

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    I need you to sing like you know 
                    you re going to die tomorrow. Like 
                    you know this is the last song you 
                    are ever going to sing. Can you do 
                    that? Because if you can. If you *
                    can show us your soul through the *
                    music, then you will own this 
                    world. Every single last bit of it. 
                    I promise you. 

      The Girls are hypnotized by him. They nod in unison, like 
      cult followers talking to their leader. Lucious nods to the 
      Sound Engineer, ROGER, mid-20 s, a nerdy kid with big hands.

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    Hit it again. 

      Roger hits play on the instrumental track as we hear SNORING 
      from BUNKIE CAMBELL, 50 s, a streetwise thug and Lucious  
      side kick from the old days, seems out of place here. He nods 
      off, mouth open on a sofa nearby.

      The LEAD SINGER storms to the mic with her opening stanza as *
      if life depended on it. In the booth, Lucious starts to *
      smile, she s made the adjustment he wants.  

                                  ROGER
                    It s better. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Shut up, ya little bitch.                                                                                       2.


      Roger smiles, loves the ribbing. Bunkie snores louder. Then, 
      ANIKA GIBBONS, 27, drop dead perfection and very smart, walks 
      into the room sporting a white Tom Ford suit. She gives 
      Lucious a peck on the mouth and sits next to him. 

                                  ANIKA
                    They sound great. 

      Lucious turns to her, he stares at her with intensity. He has 
      something to tell her, something is wrong. 

                                  ANIKA (CONT D)
                    What is it? 

      He nods to Roger to leave the room. He quickly hurries out.

                                    LUCIOUS
                          (loud to Bunkie)
                    Wake up nigga! We need to be alone.

      He kicks him on his leg to wake him. Bunkie s startled.

                                  BUNKIE
                    Money why you so rude?

      Irritated, he leaves. Lucious stares at Anika, very silent. 
      Then - his eyes fill with dread, making her scared. 

                                  ANIKA
                    Baby, what is it?!

                                                                    QUICK CUT TO:*



      Lucious sits in a doctors office wearing a patient s rob. A *
      DOCTOR stands in front of him explaining something to him. We *
      don t hear what is said, but Lucious face slowly drops. *



      Lucious WHISPERS in Anika s ear. Whatever he is telling her *
      causes her face to slowly drop in horror just like Lucious in *
      the doctor s office. Through the glass window, we see...*

      ...the Girl Group continue to sing their asses off. *                                                                                      3.



      We pull out from the studio into the hall with GOLD and *
      PLATINUM RECORDS on the walls next to pictures of Lucious *
      performing in various stadiums. As we continue down the hall *
      the Girls sound fainter until we burst through a door into...*



      Lucious bustles down his hallway covered in DAMIEN HIRST art. 
      A marble statue of APOLLO at the end of the hall faces us. 
      His adorable assistant, BECKY, 23, looks like a little boy, 
      struggles to keep up with him. She goes through a list on a *
      iPad.  

                                  BECKY
                    The designs for the jacket line 
                    need approval by noon. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      5.

                                  BECKY (CONT'D)
                    Still no word on when they are 
                    going to break ground on the 
                    Phoenix apartment complex. The 
                    Grammys are requesting you ll 
                    perform-- 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Pass.

                                  BECKY
                    American Idol wants--

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Pass.

                                  BECKY
                    And the President asked if you d 
                    attend the China State Dinner.

      Lucious slumps in frustration. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Tell him yes, but make it clear 
                    this is the last one for a few 
                    months.  

      Becky starts to walks away, but Lucious stops her. 

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    Hey. After the press conference I 
                    want you to cancel my meetings for *
                    the day. 

      Becky looks stunned. 

                                  BECKY
                    All of them?

      Lucious nods, he s dead serious. *

                                  BECKY (CONT D)*
                    Did everything go okay with the *
                    doctor?*

                                  LUCIOUS*
                    Oh, yeah, all good. *

      She nods, relieved. As she walks away, he stares off at her *
      with concern, clearly it wasn t all good.  *                                                                                      6.



      Lucious is at a conference table with the BOARD OF DIRECTORS. 
      Next to Lucious sits VERNON TURNER, 60 s, the Chairman of the 
      Board, a commanding figure, built, handsome and all business.

      Scattered around the room are a group of REPORTERS and 
      CAMERAMAN from CNN, MSNBC, CBS NEWS. Lucious addresses them. *

                                    LUCIOUS
                    On behalf of myself, our CFO Andre 
                    Lyon, our chairman, Vernon Turner.

      He motions to Andre and Vernon who nod to the reporters. 

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    And the entire board of directors, 
                    we are proud to announce that 
                    Empire Entertainment has just filed 
                    documents to become a publicly 
                    traded company on the New York 
                    Stock Exchange. 

                                  VERNON
                    We are going to be the first urban 
                      entertainment company to ever be 
                    publicly traded. 

      Many clap. Flash bulbs pop as Lucious and the Board grin. 
      Vernon and Andre exchange big smiles, Lucious notices, hides *
      his annoyance at their camaraderie. *



      An AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN whose face we don t see, is getting 
      released from prison, her belongings are slid under the bars 
      by a PRISON OFFICER, 30 s, female. 

                                  PRISON OFFICER
                    We re gonna miss you around here. 

      The Woman stares at the Prison Officer for a long beat. We 
      still don t see her face, but we hear her mutter...

                                  COOKIE
                    You gotta Newport?



      Jamal and Hakeem are seated at the huge dining table in the 
      beautiful room, a touch gaudy in how much money has been 
      spent. Hakeem s feet are up on the table as he drinks a beer. 

                                  JAMAL
                    You gonna release another single?*

                                  HAKEEM
                    I wanna take my time, cut a whole 
                    album first. I think that s why the *
                    first one didn t catch on. *

                                  JAMAL
                    Yeah, you re probably right. That s *
                    smart to take your time.  *

                                    HAKEEM*
                    Oh, so NOW your ass didn t like it?*

                                  JAMAL*
                          (laughs)*
                    Nah, it was good. But I think *
                    cutting a whole album before you *
                    release a single will strengthen *
                    your sound.  *

      Hakeem nods, but looks bummed his brother didn t like it. *
      Andre walks in. There is an awkwardness between him and his *
      brothers, but Jamal gives Andre a hug. *

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    Good seeing you, Dre. 

                                  ANDRE
                    You too. How s your friend?*

                                  JAMAL
                    Good, real good. We should all get 
                    dinner, he ll cook for you and 
                    Rhonda. He cooks good.                                                                                      8.


                                  ANDRE
                    Her schedule is pretty crazy, but 
                    we can figure something out. 

      Jamal nods, knows it will never happen.

                                  JAMAL
                    Cool, cool. 

       Then, Lucious storms into the room, a barrel of energy. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    All here. Good. I need to talk to 
                    you all. 

      He smacks Hakeem s feet off the table. 

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    And get your big ass feet off my 
                    forty thousand dollar table. 

      Lucious stands at the head of the table. He nods to Andre. 

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    Y all know, your brother and I been *
                    working round the clock to turn 
                    Empire into a publicly traded 
                    company. This is some historic *
                    shit. I m going to do what Berry 
                    Gordy, Quincy Jones, Russell 
                    Simmons, Puffy, and Jay Z were 
                    never able to. I m going to turn 
                    our business into a Fortune 500 
                    company. This is my legacy.

                                  HAKEEM
                    You gonna be a tycoon. 

      Lucious grins at his favorite son. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    That s right Negro. Once we go 
                    public, I m no longer a retired 
                    gangsta from Philly, I m IBM and 
                      Coca-Cola. 

      Hakeem and Andre beam at their father, they love it. Jamal 
      looks indifferent. Lucious looks at each son pointedly and 
      says the following carefully:  

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    As part of going public, I need to *
                    pick someone who s going to take 
                    over the company when I m gone. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      9.

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    It s not gonna happen today or 
                    tomorrow, but I need to start 
                    grooming a successor.  
                          (Then)
                    And I can only pick one of you. 

      Andre and Hakeem stare at him, the importance of this *
        conversation fully dawning on them. Jamal is nonplused.*

                                  JAMAL*
                    Are you serious? What is this, King *
                    Lear?*

                                  LUCIOUS*
                    You can call it that if you want to *
                    smart ass but over the next several *
                    months, I m going to make a *
                    decision. *
                                                                                              *

                                  ANDRE
                    So what are you saying? That we re 
                    all in competition to be the future 
                    head of the company?*

      Jamal shakes his head amused. Can t believe it.*

                                    LUCIOUS
                    It s time for you boys to figure *
                    out what you want from this life.  *
                    And then you need to take it. *

      The brothers all shoot each other glances, as they realize *
      they are being pitted against each other. Lucious doesn t *
      notice at all. He looks out at his magnificent view deeply *
      troubled. *



      Jamal s boyfriend, MICHAEL SANCHEZ, 31, Hispanic, gorgeous 
      and deeply ambitious, is prepping a chicken. Jamal helps *
      cutting vegetables. The apartment is oddly messy. For gay men *
      they seem to have this part of it all wrong.

                                  JAMAL
                    He d never pick me anyway. *

                                    MICHAEL
                    Why do you think that?

                                  JAMAL
                    Too much homophobia in the black *
                      community.                                                                                     10.


                                    MICHAEL
                    It s 2014. Nobody gives a shit *
                    anymore. *

                                  JAMAL
                    They do, believe me. And I don t 
                    want it anyway. 

      Michael looks slightly frustrated with Jamal. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    So then what do you want?

                                  JAMAL
                    What s that supposed to mean?

                                    MICHAEL
                    You don t want to release an album. 
                    You won t tour. You don t want to 
                    take over your family s company. 
                    I ve never met anyone so talented 
                    with so little ambition. 

                                  JAMAL
                    I just want to make music and I 
                    don t want anything else to get in 
                    the way. That entire business 
                    corrupts the purity of the sound 
                    man. I ve seen it all my life. Look 
                    at my dad. He was a genius, now he 
                    wants to be Coca-Cola. 

      Michael smiles at him, kisses him. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    You re the last real artist on the 
                    planet. 

                                  JAMAL
                    I just want my shit to be good. *
                    That s all that matters to me.  *

      Their intercom phone rings. Jamal answers it. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    Hello. 

                                  COOKIE V.O.
                    Let me in.  

      Jamal s confused. It can t be.

                                  JAMAL
                    Who is this?                                                                                    11.


                                  COOKIE V.O.
                    Look out your window. *

      Jamal walks over to the floor to ceiling windows that face 
      the cobble stone street. Outside he sees Cookie at the 
      building s intercom in her mink. *

                                  COOKIE V.O. (CONT D)
                    Y'all better have a elevator in 
                    here. My feet hurt.

      Jamal stares in shock. Never imagined this day would come. 

      CUT TO - FLASHBACK - 17 YEARS EARLIER: 



      8-YEAR-OLD JAMAL and a much younger Lucious sit in silence in 
      the waiting room. Both nervous, not the first time they ve 
      gone to visit Cookie. They both seem to know the routine 
      here. After what seems an eternity, Lucious turns to Jamal:

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Go see your mama without me today. 

                                  8 YEAR OLD JAMAL
                    Why?

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Don t ask questions, boy, just go 
                    in there and tell her I love her. 
                    And don't come back here crying. 

      Little Jamal nods, trying not to cry. 



      Little Jamal sits across from Cookie, separated by a glass 
      window. This is really hard for Cookie, but she s putting on 
      a tough face. They speak into telephones. 

                                  8 YEAR OLD JAMAL 
                    When you coming out, Ma?

                                  COOKIE
                    I told you to stop asking me that. 
                    Where is your father? 

      Jamal points outside. Cookie looks at the metal door. Hurt 
      that her husband has abandoned her.                                                                                    12.


                                  COOKIE (CONT D)
                    Yeah. Okay. 
                          (Then)
                    How you doing in school?

                                  JAMAL
                    My friends pick on me all the time. 
                    Bashir is stealing my lunch. I m 
                    afraid to tell Dad. He ll tell me 
                    to fight him.

      Cookie leans into the glass.

                                  COOKIE
                    Listen to me, Mal. I got something 
                    to tell you. *
                          (Slight beat)*
                    You different. It s only something *
                    mama knows, but you gonna know soon *
                    enough and it s gonna make life 
                    hard sometimes. But I want you to 
                    always remember I got you. You hear 
                    me? I got you.

      Jamal nods, deep down he knows what she s talking about. 

      CUT BACK TO - PRESENT DAY

      Jamal snaps out of the memory, scans their messy apartment, 
      starts picking up dirty boxer shorts and pizza debris.  

                                  JAMAL
                    She s out.

      Michael seems to know exactly who  SHE  is. Lighting a 
      cigarette, he follows en tow.

                                    MICHAEL
                    How? 

      Annoyed, Jamal dumps an ash tray in a nearby waste can.

                                  JAMAL
                    How what? How did she get out?
                          (Genuinely dumbfounded)
                    I don t know.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Did you tell her about us?

                                  JAMAL
                    No. And dude stop smoking. You 
                    promised.                                                                                    13.


      There s a knock at the door, Jamal opens it revealing Cookie 
      in heavy mascara, red lipstick and a too tight leopard dress. 
      Michael has instantly fallen in love, a gay man s wet dream. *
      Cookie gives Jamal a bear hug. She s missed him terribly.  *

                                  COOKIE
                    My baby. My boy.

      Then she heads straight for the kitchen chuckling to herself. 
      Cookie is amused by her son s spectacular yet untidy place.

                                  COOKIE (CONT D)
                    You sure do keep a messy place for 
                    a faggot. What you need is a good 
                    maid up in here. Smells good. What 
                    you cooking, chicken?

      She finally notices Michael standing there in complete awe.

                                  COOKIE (CONT D)
                    Who are you?

                      MICHAELJAMAL
            (smiles)Cookie this is my friend *
      Michael. Hi.*Michael. We re sorta  living *
                                                    together.**

      Giving Michael the once over, Cookie decides she likes him. *

                                  COOKIE (CONT D)
                    Honey you didn t tell me you were 
                    dating a wet back. Look at him. 
                    He s adorable... 
                          (then sotto to Jamal)
                    You should get la cucaracha to tidy 
                    up in here a bit. 

      Jamal shoots a glance at Michael, praying that he hasn t 
      heard her. Thank God not. His head is still reeling. 

                                  JAMAL
                    When did you get out? And why 
                    didn t you call me? I would have 
                    picked you up.

      Cookie dips her long pink fingernails into the simmering stew 
      on the stove. She pulls out a chicken leg and starts eating 
      it. Michael watches mesmerized by her every move.

                                  COOKIE
                    I just got out. Good behavior. 

      Many thoughts run through Jamal s head as he tries hard to 
      hold his emotions in check.                                                                                     14.


      Michael still stands in the doorway, mouth agape. Cookie sits 
      at the kitchen table chewing her chicken leg. She s thinking 
      hard.

                                  COOKIE (CONT D)
                    Tell your boyfriend to close his 
                    mouth.

                                  JAMAL
                    What are you gonna do now?

      Cookie ponders a bit. Her eyes turn serious, for the first 
      time you can see this woman has served hard time in prison.

                                  COOKIE
                    I m here to get what s mine.

                                  END OF ACT I



      Lucious, Andre and Bunkie are seated in a huge luxury box. On 
      the court a Brooklyn Net DUNKS the ball causing the crowd to 
      cheer! A WAITRESS brings over an array of elegant food. 

                                  WAITRESS
                    Shrimp cocktail and lobster tails. 
                    I m sorry but we re out of crab. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    You know I own 46% of this team?

      She looks nervous, but he smiles, was just kidding around. 

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    It s all good. 

      The guys immediately start digging in as the game continues 
      down on the court. Lucious turns to Bunkie. 

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    Can you give me and Dre a few 
                    minutes alone. 

      Bunkie is mid-bite into the lobster tail. 

                                  BUNKIE
                    Right now?

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Yeah, you can take the lobster with 
                    you. We got some family business we 
                    need to discuss. *                                                                                    15.


                                  BUNKIE
                    I ll be out in the hall. *

      Bunkie is annoyed, but covers it up as he leaves. Lucious *
      turns to Andre, this is a little tough for him to say:  *

                                    LUCIOUS
                          (smiles)*
                    I m proud of you boy. *

      Andre s immediately defensive. His dad doesn t talk like *
      this. *

                                  ANDRE*
                    Thanks, dad. *

                                  LUCIOUS*
                    When you were 11 you wanted to be *
                    the boss. Always wanted to be the *

                    off running around helping people *
                    at the office. Answering phones. *
                    Sweeping them floors at night *
                    during high school... *

      An awkward silence now. Andre s not sure if he likes were *
      this is all headed. He smiles, never showing a sign.*

                                  ANDRE*
                    Even during my finals at Penn I was *
                    still coming back doing your *

                                  LUCIOUS*
                    Was you stealing from me nigga?*

      Andre s not in the mood for his fathers sick humor.*

                        ANDRE*LUCIOUS*
      Dad?!*(Laughs his ass off)*
                                                  I m just fuckin with you. *
                                                  Grown up boy.**

      Andre shakes his head at this warped man that he loves. *
      Troubled that he s still laughing. Wonders if he ll ever *
      understand him. Lucious calms down.*

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)*
                    You ve put your blood and guts into *
                    Empire. Your whole life. Gone on *
                    and gone to grad school. Ain t *
                    nobody done that in this family.*

      Lucious is very serious. Almost proud.*                                                                                    16.


                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)*
                    Your work ethic is incredible. *
                    You ve even taught me some things.*

      Andre seizes the moment.*

                                  ANDRE*
                    Which makes me the most qualified *
                    to run the company dad. *

      Lucious grins at him. *

                                  ANDRE (CONT D)*
                    I ll kill for this company. It s *
                      everything to me. *

                                  LUCIOUS*
                    It s tricky. This is a celebrity *
                    driven brand. I m the face of *
                    Empire. Don t you think that face *
                    should remain a celebrity? We re *
                    selling personality, not intellect. 

                                  ANDRE*
                    No, I don t. You can stay the face *
                    forever, and I ll run it. I m the *
                    only one that can do it, you know *
                    that. And you re not going anywhere *
                    anytime soon.  *

      Lucious gives him a confident smile. *

                                  LUCIOUS*
                    Nothing is more important to me *
                    than this company living on after *
                    I m gone. Nothing. *

                                  ANDRE*
                    Does this have anything to do with *
                    Cookie?*

      Lucious looks at him like he s crazy. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Cookie?! What the hell are you 
                    talking about?

                                  ANDRE
                    I haven t spoken to her since she 
                    got out, but I figured you had. 

      Lucious  eyes slowly peel open in confusion. Shock even.                                                                                    17.


                                    LUCIOUS
                    Cookie s out?



      A furious Lucious has Bunkie cornered in the hallway. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    How d you not know?! You re *
                    supposed to be my eyes and ears. 

                                  BUNKIE
                    I m sorry, Money, I didn t know. 
                    What s the problem? You knew she 
                    was going to get out eventually. *
                    Don t worry, you got this. Cookie 
                    ain t nothing. 

      Lucious stares at Bunkie like he could kill him. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I want you to tell me everything 
                    she is up to. Everything. *

      Bunkie nods. A pissed off Lucious starts to walk away. 

                                  BUNKIE
                    Hey, Money, I gotta talk to you. 

      Lucious slumps in frustration, knows what s coming. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    How much?

                                  BUNKIE
                      Twenty-five. That s it. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I told you if you don t have the 
                    cash, you can t make the bets. 

                                  BUNKIE
                    It s the last time. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    It s always the last time. I m sick *
                    of it.*

      He walks away, angry. Bunkie looks pissed too.  *                                                                                    18.



      Cookie walks around Lucious  massive office. Against the wall 
      is a shelf full of music awards - Grammys, Billboard, MVA, 
      AMA s, literally every award a musician can win. She looks 
      out at the stunning view of Central Park, she stares in awe. 

      CUT TO - FLASHBACK - 21 YEARS EARLIER 



      Expensive art hangs from the wall that Hakeem stares at while 
      getting a hair cut. GOOSE, 25, his morbidly obese barber 
        meticulously trims his sideburns. ScHoolboy Q blasts from 
      invisible speakers as two Great Danes run around. 

      Cookie sits across the room on an uncomfortable German 
      designed sofa. She watches it all as if it were a circus act.

                                  HAKEEM
                          (loud over the music)
                    Mal said you wanted to see me. 
                    What s up?

      Cookie walks over to Hakeem. She nods her head for Goose to 
      disappear. Goose gets it, starts to pack up.

                                  GOOSE
                    I ma i ma mmm a leeeet you aalone 
                    with the lady.

      Hakeem is annoyed. Cookie comes close to his ear, very calm.

                                  COOKIE
                    I m not competing with this sound. 
                    Turn it off.

      It s a clear order. Hakeem stares at her. A stand off moment. 
      Finally relents. Rolling his eyes he grabs the remote. CLICK. 
      CLICK. Just the sounds of Bud and June barking now.                                                                                     22.


                                  HAKEEM
                     What do you want?

      Cookie softens. The thought of not having seen her son since 
      infancy is now showing. She looks her age as she weakens.

                                  COOKIE
                    I just wanted to see you.

      Hakeem continues his defiant stare, doesn t know his mother 
      nor does he want to. He lets her get a good look. Then - 

                                  HAKEEM
                    OK. You done?

      Cookie s hurting but you can barely tell.

                                  COOKIE
                    Why didn t you accept any of my 
                    collect calls in all these years? 
                    Return a letter?

      Awkward silence. Hakeem feels very little connection to her. 
      He grabs a broom and starts sweeping his hair up off the 
      hardwood floors, won t make eye contact. Is he ashamed? 

                                  COOKIE (CONT D)
                    Listen boy, I m not asking much 
                    from you. And from the looks of it, 
                    you don t need much from me. I just 
                    want you to know that everything I 
                    did was for you and your brothers. 
                    I ended up where I ended up for you 
                    and your brothers.

                                  HAKEEM
                    What do you want a medal, bitch?

      Cookie s eyes go dead. She SNATCHES the broom from Hakeem and 
      violently BEATS him with it! With each blow we feel the years 
      of Cookie s pent up anger. The broom SNAPS in half but Cookie 
      keeps beating him with the broken half!*

                                  COOKIE
                    I WANT SOME RESPECT YOU UNGRATEFUL 
                    BASTARD!!

      Blood is drawn as Hakeem recoils into a fetal position *
      screaming.*                                                                                    23.



      He walks in to see an upscale CROWD, all holding 100 dollar *
      bills, in a circle SCREAMING at two large PITBULLS on the *
      ground barking at each other. A full fledged dog fight.*

      A BROWN PITBULL finally rips half the neck off of A WHITE *
      PITBULL causing blood to GUSH everywhere. Some on people. *
      Half the crowd screams in triumph, the other half in anger. *

      Bunkie sees a smiling SHYNE, late-30 s, intimidating, *
      collecting money from a few people. Shyne s smile drops as he *
      sees Bunkie. He nods to him to follow him to another room. *



      A pissed of Shyne talks to Bunkie in a tackle room.  

                                  SHYNE
                    No more, Bunkie, no more. You pay 
                    me the twenty-five you owe me, then 
                    I float you another twenty-five. 
                    You don t pay me the twenty-five, 
                    then you got a problem. 

                                  BUNKIE
                    But how can I pay you back if you 
                    don t float me another twenty-five?

      Shyne looks so annoyed, hears this shit all the time. 

                                  SHYNE
                    What happened to your Sugar Daddy?

                                  BUNKIE
                    Lucious won t give it to me, he s 
                    taking his company public. Worried 
                    this kinda shit could block it. 

      Shyne stares at him. Starting to get an idea.                                                                                     24.


                                  SHYNE
                    Lucious scared of the Feds right 
                    now? How much money he gonna make 
                    when Empire goes public?

                                  BUNKIE
                    Hundreds of millions. 

                                  SHYNE
                    And I bet you ain t got a penny in 
                    the game do you? 

      The irritated look on Bunkie s face tells Shyne he s correct.  *



      Black eyed and busted lip, Hakeem lies in a bed in a plain *
      apt with TASHA, late-40 s, her enormous breasts are the only *
      thing keeping her sexy. She wears a negligee ICING his face.*

                                    HAKEEM*
                    You think Jamal is more talented *
                    then me?*

      Tasha gently strokes his face.*

                                  TASHA*
                    You should be more concerned about *
                    the crazy cow that did this do you.*

      Hakeem winces. Still in pain. Then -*

                                  TASHA (CONT D)*
                    He had a hit when was 14 for God *
                    sake. We ain t heard nothing from *
                    him since. Why would you ask a *
                    stupid question like that? YOU are *
                    the one.*

      Tasha hands him a BONG and lights it for him as he takes a *
      huge hit and blows it out. *

                                  TASHA (CONT D)*
                    Feel better?*

      He nods. Sort of.*

                                    HAKEEM*
                    Let me see it. *

      She grins, then LOWERS her strap. He stares at her tits for a *
      beat, then starts to SUCK on them. She rubs his head.  *                                                                                    25.


                                  TASHA*
                    You not gonna let that cow get in *
                    between us now, are you? *

      Sucking away, he shakes his head, no. *

                                  TASHA (CONT D)*
                    Good. Cuz I m the only real momma *
                    you got.*
                          (Then)*
                    Tell me I m your mama. *



        Intoxicating music glides us into the hottest club in 
      Manhattan, raunchy yet terribly chic. Sexy girls dancing, 
      people smoking bongs, a poker game in the corner.  

      From a balcony above, Lucious looks down on his latest 
      creation. Pleased. Hakeem approaches from behind.

                                  HAKEEM
                    You wanted to see me?

      Lucious glances at Hakeem s busted lip and swollen black eye. 
      He can t help but laugh.*

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I see you ve met your mother.

                                  HAKEEM
                    And I see why you kept me from her. *
                    She s a psychotic animal.

                                    LUCIOUS
                    She s been locked up a long time. 

                                  HAKEEM
                    What I m supposed to say to her? I 
                    don t know that woman. 

      Lucious ponders this. It s time to talk some ugly truths. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    You remember Miss Dottie?

      Hakeem nods. Vaguely remembering.

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    When Cookie was sent away the judge 
                    told us thirty years. You were just 
                    a baby.*
                          (Then)*
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    26.

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    I never cheated on your mother. Not 
                    once when we were together. We lost 
                    our virginity to each other. I was 
                    16, she was 14. I must a slept with 
                    anything with a heartbeat after she 
                    was sent away. 
                            (embarrassed now)
                    It was my way of acting out I 
                    guess. I didn t know nothing about 
                    raising y all. She did all that.

      Hakeem is uncomfortable. Why is he telling him this?

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    Anyway, I met Dottie along the way. 
                    She fell for me hard. Said she 
                    wanted to raise y all. You weren t 
                    even one. Cookie didn t want y all 
                    visiting her in jail. And that 
                    suited Dottie just fine. Cookie *
                    wasn t a bad woman. We was just in *
                    a bad situation, that s all.

      Hakeem has seen a vulnerable side of his father that he s 
      never seen before. He s not sure how he feels about it.

                                  HAKEEM
                    Whatever happened to Miss Dottie?

      Still pained by it all, Lucious waves him off. Enough of this *
      story. He looks around his incredible club. Then -*

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Time you get your act together boy.

                                  HAKEEM
                    My act is together, dad.

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Like hell it is. You phoned in your *
                    first single.*

                                  HAKEEM
                    I m working on new stuff now.*

      Lucious studies his son. He knows the monster he s created.

                                    LUCIOUS
                    You re half steppin it, Keem. You 
                    never had to work a day in your 
                    life cuz you re spoiled. I m taking 
                    you in the studio tomorrow. We 
                    gonna record some new stuff I 
                    wrote. It s time to get you going. *                                                                                    27.


      Hakeem thinks he understands where his father is going with 
      all of this. He grins. Gives Lucious a cocky nod.

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    And get that shit eating grin off 
                    of your face.*



      Jamal is seated on a plush couch in Lucious  office. Lucious *
      struts into the room, sits across from Jamal. They are *
      distant, awkward. *

                                    LUCIOUS

                    Yeah, that s right. Sorry. He works *
                    for those bastards at Atlantic, *
                    right?*

      Jamal wants to get to the point fast.*

                                  JAMAL*
                    So what s up? I was surprised to *
                    get your call.*

                                  LUCIOUS*
                    Let s get right to the point. And *
                    this is the last time that I m *
                    going to tell you this.*

      He looks Jamal straight in the eye.*

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)*
                    Your sexuality is a choice. You can *
                    choose to sleep with women Jamal.*
                    This company can be yours. If you *
                    just do it the right way.*
                    You re going to eventually release *
                    another album, and there s a lot of *
                    people in this country that don t 
                      understand people like you. It *
                    would hurt sales. *                                                                                    28.


                                  JAMAL
                    Because a sissy can t sell albums *
                    to black America?*

      Lucious cringes at the word SISSY. Cuts him off. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    --or all those white kids that make 
                    up 75% of our business. And stop *
                    calling yourself that.

                                  JAMAL
                    That s what I am dad. A sissy. A 
                    faggot.*
                          (then)*
                    You ve done some pretty awful *
                    things to me. Telling all those *
                    lies to the magazines. And that *
                    fake wedding mess. I was a kid dad.  *

      Jamal sees how uncomfortable Lucious is. He knows not to push *
      him too far.*

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    What we need to do is spend some *
                    time together. Why don t you get to *
                    know me?*

                                    LUCIOUS
                    The second you re ready to release *
                    an album, you ll have my full 
                      attention. *

      Jamal explodes. *

                                  JAMAL
                    Why is everything always about 
                    business with you? *

                                  LUCIOUS*
                    Take that damn bass out of your 
                    voice when you re talking to me.

                                  JAMAL
                    I m confused. One minute you want 
                    me with bass and the next you 
                    don t. Which is it?

      Lucious stares at him, upset, this isn t how he wanted this *
        conversation to go. Then, a perky Becky sticks her head in. *                                                                                    29.


                                  BECKY
                    We need to be wheels up in 15 if 
                    you re going to make it to 
                      Copenhagen on time. 

      Lucious nods, starts to get up. *

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I ll call you later.

      Jamal nods, knows it will never happen. *

                                  JAMAL
                    Sure. *

      Lucious watches Jamal leave his office. Deeply troubled.

      CUT TO - FLASHBACK - 17 YEARS EARLIER



      The Jackson Five s CHRISTMAS SONG blasts as a lively holiday 
      party is going on with younger Lucious and Cookie hosting 
      their NEIGHBORS. Bunkie and Vernon are there as well. 12 year-
      old Andre runs over to Vernon with his report card.  

                                  12 YEAR-OLD ANDRE
                    Uncle Vernon, I got straight A s. *

      Vernon high-fives him!

                                  VERNON
                    That s what I m talking about! You 
                    keep getting damn A s and you re *
                    gonna be as rich as the President. *

      Cookie's sister, CAROL, 35, a heavier version of Cookie holds 
      court in the room. She points to their shy neighbor DEE.

                                  CAROL
                    This bitch leaves ACME with a damn 
                    ham under her mink coat. I mean she 
                    is walking down Broad street in the 
                    middle of the day with a stolen ham 
                    under her stolen mink. Is that a 
                    Merry Christmas for you?

      Dee shakes her head embarrassed. The entire room laughs, then 
      all of a sudden, everyone abruptly STOPS talking as they see - 

      8 year-old Jamal walk down the stairs in HIGH HEELS and his 
      mother s SCARF. Lucious' face fills with disgust and 
        humiliation. He barrels up toward a now scared Jamal...                                                                                    30.



      Lucious lays on the bed of a large MRI machine, staring *
      forward. Deeply saddened at the memory. DR. SHAHANI, 50 s, *
      Indian, kind, hovers above him, snaps Lucious out of it.  *

                                  DR. SHAHANI
                    Try to relax, it ll help us get a *
                    more accurate read. And remember, 
                    nothing is conclusive yet.

      Lucious nods as he GLIDES into the MRI contraption. His 
      scared face disappears into this ominous white machine. 

                                  END OF ACT II



      Andre and Vernon are playing squash, their Ivy League *
      backgrounds showing. Andre HAMMERS the ball against the back *
      wall, with each hit he looks angrier and angrier. There is a *
      rage simmering inside him. Vernon looks at Andre, concerned. *                                                                                    31.


                                    VERNON*
                    You okay?*

      Andre nods he s fine. He serves the ball, SMASHING it against *
      the back wall with fury! Clearly not fine.*



      Andre is sprawled across his bed in his modern apartment. He 
      looks severely depressed. Rhonda stands above him holding a *
      glass of water and two white PILLS. 

                                  RHONDA
                    Come on, honey, take your pills.  *

                                  ANDRE
                    They make me feel worse. 

                                  RHONDA
                    You always say that when you don t 
                    take them, then in two days you ll 
                    feel normal again. Now take your 
                    pills or I ll tell your dad your *
                    off your anti-depressants again. 

      This gets his attention. Bitter and angry, he reluctantly 
      takes the pills. Rhonda sits next to him, starts gently 
      running her nails on the back of his neck. 

                                  ANDRE
                    He s always loved them more than *
                    me, even Jamal who he hates. *

                                  RHONDA
                    My dad is the same way. He loves my 
                    fat, idiot brother more than me *
                    because they watch TV and smoke pot 
                    all day together. Deep down it s 
                    because they re jealous of us. They *
                    hate that we went to Ivy League *
                    schools. It makes them feel 
                    inferior, so they treat us like 
                    we re inferior to keep us down. 

                                  ANDRE
                    He loves them because they re *
                    talented like him. I think he s *
                    going to leave it all to Hakeem.*

                                    RHONDA*
                    And I bet Jamal won t object, *
                    because he s too passive. *                                                                                    32.


                                  ANDRE*
                    Nope. *

                                  RHONDA
                    But what if he did?

      Andre turns to her, she has his attention. 

                                  RHONDA (CONT D)
                    What if Jamal made a play for the 
                    company and your two brothers end 
                    up going to war against each other?*

                                  ANDRE
                    It would never happen. They re as 
                    tight as can be. 

                                  RHONDA
                    Money and power has torn apart a 
                    lot more than two brothers. And if 
                    they did go to war, they just might 
                    end up killing each other...

                                  ANDRE
                    ...and the talent-less brother is 
                    the last man standing. 

      Rhonda smiles at him. 

                                  RHONDA
                    Looks like those pills already 
                    started working. 

      Andre stares at her, intrigued, but unsure. *

                                  ANDRE*
                    I don t know. That s some tricky *
                    shit. *

                                    RHONDA*
                    Do you really want that company?*

      He looks at Rhonda with fire in his eyes. *

                                  ANDRE*
                    What do think?*

      She grabs his face and passionately kisses him on the mouth. *

                                    RHONDA*
                    Prove it.*                                                                                    33.



      Cookie sits on the floor in the empty large apartment she 
      just moved into - boxes, a couch, a TV. The buildings of 
      midtown are seen out the windows like a concrete jungle. 

      Unpacking boxes, Cookie comes across an old picture of her 
      family from years ago. One of the last times they were all 
      together. She looks devastated at the family she left behind. 

      Then - a knock at the door. A surprised Cookie takes out a  
      small .22 PISTOL and leans against the door. 

                                  COOKIE
                    Who is it?

                                  ANDRE V.O.
                    It s Andre. 

      She quickly hides the gun and opens the door. They stare at 
      each other for a long beat, it s been many years. 

                                  ANDRE
                    Hey, Momma. 

                                  COOKIE
                    Hi, Andre. Come on in. 

      He walks into the apartment, looks around.  

                                  ANDRE
                    Dad set you up in a nice place. 

                                  COOKIE
                    I had this coming to me, and a hell 
                    of a lot more. 

                                  ANDRE
                    So I hear. 

      She stares at him for a long beat. Tries to be angry at him 
      but can t. Instead, a mother filled with pride at her son. 

                                  COOKIE
                    I m proud of you. Going to the 
                    Wharton and all. Jamal told me 
                      everything over the years. You 
                    really made something of yourself. 

                                  ANDRE
                    Thank you, Momma. I m sorry I never *
                    came to visit.*                                                                                    34.


                                    COOKIE*
                          (Fighting tears)*
                    I thought you d come eventually. I 
                    never gave up hope. 

                                  ANDRE
                    I just couldn t do it. 

                                  COOKIE
                    Too ashamed of your dope selling 
                    Ma? 

                                  ANDRE
                    I m sorry, I truly am. 

      This instantly melts her. She holds out her arms. 

                                  COOKIE
                    Give me a hug. 

      He hugs Cookie, she hugs him tight, moved to hold her son 
      again. On his face we see complete indifference. 



      The entire BOARD OF DIRECTORS sit in the conference room with 
      Vernon and Lucious at opposite ends of the table. Lucious 
      stands up to make a speech. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Before we begin, I just want to say 
                    what an honor it is making history 
                    with you all. It is because of your 
                      dedication that we have made it to 
                    this historic moment. 

      As everyone applauds, Cookie BURSTS in like a tornado.  

                                  COOKIE
                    Don t forget me, baby! Don t forget 
                    to thank your Cookie on this 
                    historic occasion! 

      Vernon looks concerned, immediately jumps to his feet.                                                                                     37.


                                  VERNON
                    Cookie, it s great to see you. 

                                  COOKIE
                    Kiss my black ass, Vernon.

                    according to the Dodd Frank Wall

                    would be launched into the business 
                    dealings of Empire Entertainment.  

      Lucious looks at Vernon who nods. 

                                  VERNON
                    It would kill us on Wall Street. We

      Lucious looks horrified. He turns to Cookie, desperate. 

                                    LUCIOUS

                    You got him.  

      Cookie smirks satisfied, then turns to Vernon.

                    So nice to see you, Vernon. 

      As she walks toward the door to leave, we begin to hear the 
      sounds of a soulful guitar being played...

                    Cookie.

      She storms out of the room as the sounds of the guitar 
      EXPLODE into...



      Jamal plays the guitar with a back up band in the basement of 
      a coffee shop. He plays a soulful tune about a boy who wants 
      to be loved. The packed room is enthralled with his music. 

      Cookie stands in the back, beaming with pride. The song ends 
      with a big finish. Crazy applause! Jamal humbly nods, then 
      sees Cookie in the back. He smiles at her, she smiles back. 



      Still stunned, Cookie sits in the Taxi, not sure what to do. 
      Then - she pulls out her cell phone and makes a call. 

                                  COOKIE

      Jamal and Hakeem sit in a booth in a VIP section of the 
      packed bar with hot girls, hipsters and jet setters. Hakeem s 
      bruises have mostly cleared up.   *

                                  HAKEEM
                    You seen her yet?

                                  JAMAL

                    Oh, yeah. The bitch is crazy. She 
                    beat me with a broom. 

      Jamal starts to laugh.                                                                                     41.

                    I m serious. It hurt. 

      Jamal laughs even harder. Hakeem starts to laugh too. 

                                  JAMAL
                    I read Dad was in the Illuminati.

      This brings both boys practically to the floor howling. Then -*

                                  HAKEEM
                    What s she gonna do now? Dad won t 
                    want her around. 

                                  JAMAL
                    She wants to manage my career. 

                                  HAKEEM
                    She does?

                                  JAMAL
                    Yeah, but I told her no. I don t *
                    want to release an album. I m still 
                    working through the sound. 

                                  HAKEEM
                    Yeah, well, if you do end up 
                    working with her, and dad is 
                    handling me, they re gonna be using 
                    us to try to kill each other. 

      Jamal realizes he s right. Uneasy about it all. Then -  *

                                  JAMAL
                    Hey, no matter what happens with 
                    our music or with them we both know 
                    what time it is.

                                  HAKEEM
                    I got you right back, Mal.

      The two brothers clasp hands and then hug. They really love 
      each other. Over Jamal s shoulder, Hakeem sees a HOT WHITE 
      GIRL giving him the eye. He smiles back at her. 

                                  JAMAL
                    You wanna get out of here. *

      Hakeem nods toward the Hot White Girl. 

                                  HAKEEM
                    I gotta talk to a friend of mine. *                                                                                    42.

                    Aren t you recording in the 
                    morning? You should get some sleep. 

      Hakeem gets up and winks at his brother. 

                                  HAKEEM
                    It s all part of my artistic 
                    process. 

      He saunters over to the Hot White Girl and throws his arm 
      around her, she s immediately perceptive as she giggles. *
      Jamal shakes his head as he watches.*



      Hakeem is recording in the studio, looks haggard, hung-over 
      and his voice sounds raspy: 

                                  HAKEEM
                     I got no fear in my soul/Cuz I 
                    know-- 
                          (He stops)
                    Wait, I gotta start again. 

      In the booth, Lucious drops his head in frustration. Anika 
      looks annoyed as well. Andre is trying not to smile. 

                                  ROGER
                    This is take 37. 

      He hits the instrumental track. Hakeem starts up again: 

                                  HAKEEM
                     I got no fear in my soul/Cuz I 
                    know when I go people will-- 

      He looses his focus, forgetting the lyrics. 

                                  HAKEEM (CONT D)
                    What s the word again? 

      Lucious can t take it anymore. He speaks into the microphone. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    The word is you re a mess. The word 
                    is you re a disappointment. The 
                    word is you are wasting my time. 
                    Those are the words that are coming 
                    to mind.                                                                                     43.


      Hakeem storms out of the studio, barrels past them into the 
      green room, slamming the door. Lucious and Anika give each 
      other solemn looks, Andre can barely hide his glee.  



      Hakeem sits on the coach, stewing. He picks up a chair and 
      SLAMS it into the ground until it SMASHES to pieces! He picks 
      up another chair and throws it across the room! 



      In the booth, they hear the noise of Hakeem trashing the 
      room. Lucious starts to SMILE, clearly digs what he s 
      hearing. Andre looks confused. 

                                  ANDRE
                    Why are you smiling?

                                    LUCIOUS
                    He s scared. 
                          (Then)
                    That means he wants it. 



      Hakeem sits on the ground in the trashed room, it s all 
      fucked up. He stares forward in a haze, upset and scared. 

      Anika walks in holding a bottle of tequila. She looks so 
      beautiful as she pours them shots. They down the shots. *

                                  ANIKA
                    Do you want to be a Prince or do 
                    you want to be the King?

                                  HAKEEM
                    I wanna be the King. 

                                  ANIKA
                    Then you come back next week and 
                    claim your throne. 

      She leans in and whispers in his ear. 

                                  ANIKA (CONT D)
                    And don t ever forget, Kings get 
                      everything they want. 

      She saunters out, the most beautiful woman Hakeem has ever 
      seen. He s stunned, can t believe Dad s girl just said that. *                                                                                    44.



      Lucious and Anika are asleep when Lucious  phone rings. 
      Groggy, Lucious sees  Bunkie  on the caller ID. He answers:

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Somebody better be dead. 

                                  BUNKIE
                    We need to meet. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    What?

                                  BUNKIE
                    Now. The warehouses. *

      Lucious looks concerned, knows it s serious. 



      Cookie and Jamal ride through the Holland tunnel.

      Jamal laughs.



      Cookie and Jamal look around their old house, it s different 
      now, but in many ways it s still the same. Lounging on the 
      couch are Carol s kids - KEISHA (14), LUTHER (11), AND TANYA 
      (8). Watching TV, they don t seem too interested in Cookie or 
      Jamal or anything really. Carol snaps at them:

                                  CAROL
                    Turn off that damn TV and give your 
                    Aunt Cookie a hug!

      They come over and give her a half hearted hug. 

                                  CAROL
                    And this is your cousin Jamal. 

      They all stare at Jamal who feels guilty and ashamed that 
      these kids, let alone family members, live like this. 

                                  JAMAL

                    So what do you study in school?

      They look at him like he s fucking crazy. Cookie jumps in. 

                                  COOKIE
                    You know Jamal is a singer too. 
                    He s gonna be a star.

                    Oh yeah, a big one, as big as his 
                    daddy. You want him to play 
                    something for you?

      The kids all start nodding, excited. Jamal is embarrassed. 

                                  LUTHER
                    Come on, Cuz, play us something.

                                  COOKIE
                    You know you don t need no guitar. 

      Jamal relents. He grabs a chair and starts pounding out a 
      rhythm on it. He sings a fun, upbeat tune about following 
      your dream. The kids are slayed. Carol whispers to Cookie: 

                                  CAROL
                    He s as good as his daddy. 

      Cookie nods. Carol leans in to her. 

                                  CAROL (CONT D)
                    Times are kind of hard right now. 
                    We could use a little extra cash. 

      Cookie straightens her fur. 

                                  COOKIE
                    I hear that.                                                                                     51.


      Carol stares at her, waiting for her to offer money, but 
      Cookie just nods along to the music, not offering anything. 

      The kids start clapping along. Jamal gets more into it as he 
      sees his cousins come to life before his eyes as he sings for 
      them. The song continues into the next scene...



      Driving home from Philly, Jamal stares out the window, 
      contemplative. Clearly the day had an effect on him. He then 
      sees Cookie holding out a large gold RING to him. 

                                  JAMAL
                    What is that?

                                  COOKIE
                    It belonged to James Brown. 

                                  JAMAL
                    The James Brown?

      Cookie nods. 

                                  COOKIE
                    He was my Uncle. 

      Jamal looks stunned, had no idea. 

                                  JAMAL
                    James Brown was your Uncle?

                                  COOKIE
                    I grew up in this. That s how I 
                    know it so well. Uncle James was 
                    the greatest there ever was and 
                    when he died there wasn t a penny 
                    left. His kids, brothers, sisters, 
                    nieces, nephews, no one got 
                    nothing. Lucious saw it all and 
                    made sure that was never going to 
                    happen to him. That s why he 
                    created Empire.

                    the ring, honey. 

      Jamal stares at her, it s tempting.

      Jamal then turns and looks out the window. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Keep the ring, ma. 

      Cookie stares at him, really frustrated. 



      Hakeem records the song Jamal had written with Jamal playing 
      guitar as back up. The song is great and Hakeem sounds 
      fantastic. He ends on a jaw dropping note. So talented. 

      As soon as it finishes, the door to the booth BURSTS open. A 
      beaming LUCIOUS barrels into the room with his arms out.  

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I told you you had it! I told you! 

      Hakeem is beaming, he points to Jamal. 

                                  HAKEEM
                    Jamal came up with most of it--

                                  JAMAL
                    --nah, it was all Hakeem. He came 
                    up with the whole thing. 

      Lucious beams at Hakeem. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    That s cuz you re a genius. A GOD. 

      He gives Hakeem a huge hug, clearly so proud. 

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    You re gonna be a huge star, Keem. 
                    I m so proud of you.                                                                                     53.


      Jamal watches Lucious embrace his brother. He can t hide the 
      bitterness his father won t treat him like this. We hear 
      Hakeem s song play into the next scene... 



      Lucious sits on an examining table wearing a patients robe. 
      He looks nervous, scared. Dr. Shahani comes into the room, he 
      looks solemn, clearly has bad news. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    That good, huh?

                                  DR. SHAHANI
                    I m so sorry, but all of our follow *
                    ups have confirmed what we ve 
                    always feared. You ve got ALS. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I ve really got Lou Gehrig's 
                    disease? Really?

      Dr. Shahani sadly nods. 

                                    LUCIOUS (CONT D)
                    And there s no cure for it? I gotta 
                    lot of money, doc. 

                                  DR. SHAHANI
                    It s such a rare autoimmune disease 
                    there s been very little progress 
                    in treating it. Unfortunately 
                    they re no where near a cure.  

                                    LUCIOUS
                    So what happens next?

                                  DR. SHAHANI
                    You may start feeling symptoms 
                      immediately which vary from person 
                    to person. Slurred speech, tripping 
                    on carpets or twitching in your 
                    fingers or toes. But slowly it will 
                    shutdown your entire body. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    How long do I have left?

                                  DR. SHAHANI
                    Three years, maybe more, but more 
                    likely less. I m so sorry, Lucious. 

      Dr. Shahani starts to tear up.                                                                                     54.

                    and country have been astounding. *

      Lucious stares at him, he can t believe he s really dying. 



      Jamal lies in bed next to Michael, staring up at the ceiling.  *
      He has that same lost look in his eyes. Michael notices. *

                    What s wrong? *

      Cookie lounges in her apartment watching WENDY WILLIAMS when 
      she hears a knock at the door. 

                                  JAMAL V.O.
                    It s Jamal. 

      She hurries over and opens the door, so pleased to see Jamal 
      standing in her doorway. He stares at her, determined. 

                                  JAMAL
                    I m not going to do this to get

      She smiles. Deeply touched. *

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)*
                    But I want to do it as me. *

      We see a tiny smile form on Jamal s face. He loves it. *



      Still pensive, Lucious sits across from Vernon. He stares off 
      into space as Vernon takes out a manila envelope. 

                                  VERNON
                    So we were able to find out--
                          (Then)
                    You okay?

      Lucious snaps out of his daze. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Yeah, I m good. What do you got?                                                                                    56.


      Vernon opens up the envelope and takes out photographs of 
      Bunkie at a poker table in Shyne s club, drinking with Shyne, 
      at a strip club, car shopping at a Range Rover dealership. 

                                  VERNON
                    It looks like Bunkie has gotten 
                    close with Shyne Johnson. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I know him. The Bronx. 

                                  VERNON
                    Card clubs, girls, drugs. And he s 
                      dangerous. This isn t a great time 
                    to get shaken down by a gangsta who 
                    has no problem taking people out. 
                          (Then)
                      Suggestions?

      Lucious looks at the photographs, then looks Vernon in the 
      eye, unable to hide his rage. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I ll think of something. 

      Andre comes into the room, Lucious smoothly hides the photos. 

                                  ANDRE
                    We re ready. 



      A beaming Cookie sits at the conference table surrounded by 
      LAWYERS. Lucious sits across the table, more amused than 
      angry at her. A LAWYER, 50 s, explains to Cookie:

                                  LAWYER
                    In exchange for the pre-negotiated 
                    salary, a stipend for housing and 
                    control over Jamal Lyon s career, 
                    you are signing away your rights to 
                    ever disclose you were the original 
                    investor in Empire Entertainment. 
                    If you violate the non-disclosure 
                      agreement, the deal is void. 

                                  COOKIE
                    I know, I know. You re paying me 
                    off to shut my fat ass up.  

                                    LUCIOUS
                    That s right, Cookie.                                                                                     57.


      She smiles at Lucious, he smiles back. A trace of their old 
      chemistry starting to come back. 



      In an office that s connected to the conference room, Andre 
      and Vernon watch Cookie sign the documents through a window. 

                                  VERNON
                    You got one tough mother. 

                                  ANDRE
                    I know. 

      Vernon leans in and whispers to Andre...

                                  VERNON
                    I know your dad wants it to be 
                    Hakeem, but you re the only one 
                    that can truly run this company.

      Andre is surprised, but Vernon gives him a paternal smile. 

                                  VERNON (CONT'D)
                    I m a firm believer intelligence 
                    and hard work are more important 
                    than being able to rap. You deserve 
                    to fly this plane. *

      Andre stares at him for a beat, processing. Then - *

                                  ANDRE
                    You re right, I do deserve it and *
                    I m going to take it. *

                                    VERNON*
                    And I ll do everything I can to *
                    help you. I hope you ll remember me *
                    when you re in the pilot seat.*

      Andre smiles at him with charm. *

                                  ANDRE*
                    How could I forget you, Uncle *
                    Vernon?*



      Lucious and Cookie sit on a sofa in a palatial room on the 
      yacht. They are laughing, looking like an old married couple. 

                                  COOKIE
                    And you know I ain t never believed

                    Girls walking around with their 
                    scalps smelling and shit. 

      Lucious laughs even harder. He smiles at Cookie. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    It s good to see you again. 

      She takes his hand. 

                                  COOKIE
                    It s good to see you too. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I m sorry I didn t visit you. I am. 
                    I feel so ashamed. 

                                  COOKIE
                    Tell that shit to Anika or one of 
                    those other young girls you messing 
                    with.

      Lucious smiles at her, laughs. She s just Cookie. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    I wanna play something for you. 

      He takes out his iPhone and plays the song Jamal wrote for 
      Hakeem. Fully mixed, it sounds perfect. Cookie nods her head.

                                  COOKIE
                    You know what Uncle James would 
                    call that? A big fat hit. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    There are five more just as good. 
                    No matter what you do with Jamal, 
                    he ll never be as big as Hakeem. 
                    His sound isn t mainstream enough. 

                                  COOKIE
                    Jamal is going to be huge and you 
                    know it.                                                                                     61.


                                    LUCIOUS
                    It s never gonna happen, Cookie. I 
                    won t let it happen.

      Cookie is mad and hurt by this. The fun has left the room.

                                  COOKIE
                    Lucious why? He s your son for *
                    God s sake.

      Lucious is genuinely confused by her stand. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    You re really not ashamed of him, 
                    are you? 

                                  COOKIE
                    No, I m not. I m gonna make it 
                    happen and I will take down 
                    anything that gets in my way. 

      Lucious smiles at her. Knows she s telling the truth. 

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Then I guess this is war. 

                                  COOKIE
                    War against a son looking for his 
                    father s love.  

      She gets up and walks to the door.

                                    LUCIOUS
                    Why are you doing this, Cookie?

                                  COOKIE
                    So you can see a faggot really can 
                    run this company. 

      She walks out. Lucious watches her go. Then he notices - 

      His pinky finger is SHAKING uncontrollably. He stares at it 
      as a sadness fills his soul. He knows he s a dying man.
