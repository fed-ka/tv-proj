CLOSE on a mud-streaked AIRFIELD in mist and driving RAIN.
A Lockheed ELECTRA sits. Sleek, twin-engine, state-of-the-
art, its metallic surface battered by the monsoon. Waiting.
PULL BACK to see...
...our VIEW down onto the landing strip is from an open-
sided, thatched roof BAR high above the airfield. And
peering down through the mist and rain...
...a WOMAN in grimy flight clothes gazes at the plane.
Slender. Feminine. At first glance, fragile. Then the gray
eyes change like the sea, as a stray thought transforms her.
Something fierce lives there.
SUPERIMPOSE:
LAE, NEW GUINEA - 1937.
FRED (O.S.)
Sure I can't talk you inta
somethin' more adventurous?
She turns. FRED NOONAN is tall and lean, ruggedly handsome
in a reckless way. His flight clothes as rumpled and dirt-
streaked as her own. He carries his bottle of tequila, and a
Coke which he sets down for her.
AMELIA
Adventurous? You've got the wrong
girl, Mister. You should know that
by now.
Her eyes study him.
Assessing something as he pours himself
four fingers.
FRED
Actually. I knew that the moment I
met ol' George.
He sips his drink.
She says nothing.
FRED (CONT'D)
I like how you don't talk about
him.
AMELIA
That why I get so many chances to
not do it?
FRED
Well.
Natural curiosity.
His charming smile. She's thinking more about the tequila.
She reaches to take his bottle and glass. Moves them to her
side of the table.
2.
FRED
I mean, why would a guy who needs
to run the show. Pick the one girl
he knew could kick his tail?
No response.
Just her clear direct gaze.
FRED (CONT'D)
I'll bet he knew that. First time
he met you.
She looks out to sea.
AMELIA
He thought I hated him.
He never
knew I was fascinated.
Two LITTLE GIRLS, maybe 10 years old, walking in a field.
Amelia and a girlfriend. They stop, hearing...
The DRONING of an engine, a small red plane APPEARING above
the treetops. The pilot seeing two girls alone in the field,
SWOOPS down to BUZZ them. Amelia's friend runs for her life.
But Amelia stands still, throws her arms WIDE, and the
plane...
...DROPS lower, and LOWER, as it CLOSES straight in on the
slender girl with her outstretched arms. LOUDER and FASTER,
as if intent on winning some impulsive duel of wills. The
aircraft SCREAMS past, just above her head.
AMELIA (V.O.)
As the little red airplane passed
by, it said something to me.
Amelia beams.
She fills her lungs, transported.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I don't think I've ever stopped
listening.
HOLD on her, hair and uniform whipping in the breeze.
SMASH CUT TO...

A small HANGAR in a lonely field.
See a group of...
...MECHANICS in their grease-stained jumpsuits. Three big
guys and one little one working on an engine that's been
pulled from Amelia's Kinner. When the little guy comes up
for air...
...he isn't a guy at all.

AMELIA
Got it.
I think.

Amelia and Sam walk a wooded path beside the grounds.
Through the chain link fence, they watch other social workers
playing with groups of children.
SAM
And it's a secret.
AMELIA
Has to be. Competition, you know.
Millionaire heiresses, hot shot
girl pilots. If George knew I told
you, he'd have me publicly flogged.
She looks over.
12.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
So long as he could sell tickets.
He's not smiling.
SAM
And no one else knows.
AMELIA
Marion. She's giving me a leave
of absence.
SAM
I would think so. Your name will
be in all the papers, and not just
Boston. Denison House stands to
come in for funding, national
attention.
AMELIA
Specially if I don't make it.
SAM
Don't joke about that.
She wasn't joking at all.
SAM (CONT'D)
You'll make it. And then you'll
have opportunities to work in
aviation. Anywhere you want.
She laughs.
AMELIA
Well, I'll have impressive
credentials as a long-distance
passenger. That's not exactly a
career in aviation.
She looks up at his eyes.
I
AMELIA (CONT'D)
'm not going anywhere, social work
is my life. After all the years of
false starts, I found the thing I'm
meant to do.
Keep walking.
She gives him time to say...
SAM
And where does that leave us?
13.
AMELIA
You do love to look on the dark
side. Whatever did you see in a
sunny character like me?
She gives him a sweet playful smile.
It doesn't reassure
him.
SAM
It's not as if I'd been putting
pressure on you.
AMELIA
What love means to you. What it
requires. Is the pressure.
He stops walking.
SAM
I love you. Is that such a
terrible problem?
She gazes at him.
Can he even hear this?
AMELIA
The problem is what it's always
been. The problem is me.
George and Amelia approach a waiting motorboat, as the lights
of Boston glimmer across the harbor. His head is down.
She's watching his profile.
AMELIA
Sorry.
I'll try keeping my mouth
shut.
GEORGE
What I ought to try. Is listening
to you once in awhile.
H
e meant that.
And she seems oddly touched.
AMELIA
Careful.
I could get to like it.
No reaction from him. He hops into the boat. Turns, holds
out his hand. She hesitates. Clearly doesn't need his help
to jump into a boat. Their eyes lock. We are watching her
decide. And then...
She reaches to clasp his hand.
Hops down beside him.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Thank you, Simpkin. Thank you for
everything.
GEORGE
(a smile)
Simpkin.
AMELIA
It's in a book. Oh, that's right.
You read the ones you publish.
Her smile is friendly, not flirtatious. She goes to sit in
the bow. He doesn't follow. But he is watching.

Amelia in a flying outfit.
Hands on her hips as if posing.
AMELIA (V.O.)
There's a Beatrix Potter story
about a cat named Simpkin.
PULL BACK to see the PHOTOGRAPHER, George beside him. They
are on a hotel rooftop, precariously high above Boston.
T
A
17.
AMELIA (V.O.)
He wasn't happy unless he had
several mice, each under a
different teacup. So he could
never become bored.
We see that Amelia's POSE looks exactly the SAME as a photo
of CHARLES LINDBERGH in the photographer's hand. It is
labeled `LUCKY LINDY.'
AMELIA (V.O.)
THe illusion of activity was
essential for him to feel at peace.
The photographer now shows George ANOTHER PHOTO of Lindbergh
in a different pose.
AMELIA
What are you boys doing over there?
GEORGE
Trying to make you look like a
girl.
George studies the photo, then goes to Amelia and begins
moving her body into the new pose. Tilting her head to
Lindbergh's angle.
MELIA (V.O.)
I wondered.
Was I Mr. Putnam's
43rd mouse?
Or his 307th.
Now touching her, adjusting her coat, fluffing a bit of her
hair, pulling the collar around to frame her face...
G
EORGE
he more we can make you look
like a girl, the better.
AMELIA
Oh god, is it worth the effort?
He cocks his head, studies her.
Nah, guess not.
GEORGE
Wondering who should play you
in the film of all this. I'm
thinking Chaplin.
AMELIA
Valentino's not available?
He shakes his head sadly. Adjusts her collar once more.
This time, his hands linger.
18.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Two things. One, Chaplin can't
play me because he's perfect for
you. And two, you have company.
She glances to where a WOMAN, beautiful and aristocratic, is
being helped onto the roof. George's face lights to see her.
He rushes over, sweeps her into his arms, kisses her
tenderly. Amelia smiles to see this, makes her like them
both.
GEORGE
Amelia Earhart, this is Dorothy
Binney Putnam.
The women trade smiles.
They shake hands, holding eye
contact.
DOROTHY
Great to meet you. George talks
so much about you.
(a wink)
In fact, lately, you're all he
does talk about.
George steps in close, and the photographer SNAPS a three-
shot. And another.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Hold those smiles for one more,
please.

The FRIENDSHIP bobbing on its pontoons. Bill and Slim are
off-loading equipment and other gear from the plane to a
TUGBOAT filled with support crew and family. The plane's
engines REV in the predawn stillness. PULL BACK to see...

...the yacht club dock. George and Amelia alone at the
railing. She's wearing her leather flight jacket and boots.
They stare out at the plane, so frail and awkward. From her
bag now, she pulls three ENVELOPES...
Puts them in George's hand.
Straight, unblinking...
AMELIA
Popping off letters. For my dad,
my mom, my sis. You know. In
case.
19.
He stares down. Rocked by the weight of this against the
simplicity of her words. The top envelope says: DEAREST
DAD.
GEORGE
I'm honored. That you'd leave
these with me.
AMELIA
Who else? If I do pop off, it's
your fault.
Said in her sunny way. But she's not kidding.
It takes a
beat before he can offer...
GEORGE
I'll call them once you're safely
on your way.
AMELIA
Sam will handle that.
They trust
him.
That registers.
GEORGE
I've figured out the Simpkin thing,
you know.
AMELIA
Have you.
GEORGE
Sure. There are so few books I
haven't published, it was easy
to find.
Well...?
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Beatrix Potter, the Tailor of
Gloucester. He's a cat in a
green frock coat.
AMELIA
But why is he you?
Oh.
GEORGE
He's brilliant, charismatic...
AMELIA
So you haven't actually read it.
Do you actually read?
H
20.
GEORGE
...neurotic, compulsive,
manipulative. Am I getting warmer?
She sighs.
AMELIA
P
ray I make it. Or the secret pops
off with me.
A held look.
A friendly...
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Well.
See ya.
She walks off down the dock toward the Friendship.

MOVIETONE NEWSREEL CONTINUES. We are looking at foggy, bleak
Trepassey Harbor as the Friendship makes an unsuccessful
attempt to take off.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
Eleven days of failure for plucky
Amelia Earhart and her crew. If it
isn't storms over the Atlantic,
it's the inability of the
seaplane's pontoons to lift from
the sea.
S
ERIES OF ANGLES.
One failed take-off after another.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Perhaps it's for the best.
Remember, no woman has beat the
jinx of the Atlantic and three have
died trying. Including a princess
and the niece of former President
Woodrow Wilson.
The plane's engine SPUTTERS and STALLS.
It floats on the
sea.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Maybe this one's not to be. Hey,
Mabel! How's your weather report?

Seven-year-old KIDS dressed as cowboys and Indians are
gathered on the front lawn of a white clapboard home. We
CLOSE on a clear-eyed tomboy with war paint and tousled hair,
AMELIA at seven, looking up excitedly as a car pulls to the
curb.
H
er FATHER climbs slowly from the car, WOBBLES his way across
the lawn. The kids part to let him through, the confusion
and disappointment on every face. He ignores them all, even
Amelia. The front door opens...
...Amelia's MOTHER gazes at him with shame and disdain.
As
she helps him stagger inside...
It's dark and cold. Bill and Amelia stand at the dock beside
their plane. He's drinking coffee as they watch Slim come
down the quay with a slip of paper in his hand. Amelia steps
forward to take it. Reads with neutral eyes.
AMELIA
Good.
Slim, start the engines.
She still hasn't given the paper to Bill. Slim steps onto a
pontoon. Starts CRANKING up the propellers. As the engine
KICKS to life...
S
27.
She hands the weather report to Bill.
He reads.
Looks to
her eyes.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
You signed a contract. You've got
a direct instruction from me to go.
That report indicates some degree
of risk and it's a risk I'm taking.
BILL
Have a nice flight.
AMELIA
Thanks.
She motions to Slim, get on board. The navigator grins,
starts to climb up, looking back at Bill...
SLIM
Hey, I'm scared shitless of this
dame.
She climbs up after him.
One look back...
AMELIA
Read tomorrow's papers, Bill.
We'll both be in them.
And disappears. Alone on the dock, Bill hears the engines
REV. Jesus, God, she's going to do it. He takes a step
toward the plane, but her head appears in the hatch...
AMELIA (CONT'D)
So, to take off, you pull back
on the thing, right?
Her perfectly straight, innocent face.
He BUSTS out
laughing. This fucking girl.
T
osses his coffee.
Climbs aboard.
...the seaplane LIFTS, struggles, then SOARS FREE.
RAPID SERIES OF ANGLES. War-painted Amelia looking up from
the cowboy she's tied to a tree. The car pulling to the
curb. Out climbs...
29.
...her FATHER glassy-eyed.
Stumbling through the children.
Her MOTHER at the door.
ANGLE. Amelia still in war paint enters her parents' room
She knows just where to go. Opens a drawer, digs beneath
crisply starched shirts. Finds the BOTTLE.
ANGLE. Amelia in the bathroom, POURING the bottle out into
the sink. She looks up in the mirror to see...
...her father in the doorway. She turns straight to him.
MEETS his eyes, direct and unafraid.

The little plane sputtering, shuddering, as Bill drops in for
a splashdown. We PAN to the shore...
...a rural railroad dock. Deserted except for THREE WORKERS
who glance up as the Friendship taxis to a buoy a few hundred
yards offshore. Amelia at the hatch, tiny in distance, WAVES
a towel...
...one friendly worker takes off his coat and WAVES back.
Then all three guys go back to work. SNAP TO...
REVERSE ANGLE. From the Friendship, we watch the workers
ignoring us. Bill and Slim HOLLER and jump up and down on
the pontoons. Nobody cares. Amelia sits in the doorway, her
legs swinging free.
AMELIA
Out of gas. May have to swim for
I

LATER. Amelia alone. Six pages written by her side. Still
working, as a rowboat pulls up. Bill stands in the bow.
Calls to her...
BILL
Mr. Putnam phoned. He says there's
fella coming from London. Hilton
Railey.
32.
AMELIA
Oh, yeh. Very important man.
More
important than any of us.
Really?
Yep.
BILL
He says ya mustn't come ashore til
he gets here. No matter what.
Great.
She doesn't like it, but there it is.
She waves, so
long.
BILL (CONT'D)
Some kind of royalty, is he?
She nods.
AMELIA
Public relations.
Goes back to work.
DISSOLVE TO...
LATER. Amelia sits with her papers in her lap, dangling her
feet from the hatch. Alone. Hear the BUZZ of...
...a PLANE dropping slowly from the sky, gliding onto the
water on its pontoons. She stares at it. Gathers up her
things.
LATER. Amelia sitting in a tiny dinghy, behind her the
Friendship in distance. She is being rowed to shore. Our
VIEW is over the back of the man rowing. Amelia is staring
past him, vaguely apprehensive.
REVERSE ANGLE. She's looking at TWO THOUSAND WELSHMEN
swarming the docks. You can't even see the sand.
The crowd is silent and staring. No cheers. As if they were
staring at an alien or an animal in the zoo. Bill and Slim
help pull the dinghy to the rocky shore. But when Amelia
jumps out, the crowd...
.
..begins to soberly APPLAUD, and slowly CLOSES IN around
her. At first she seems pleased, trying to shake every hand
thrust toward her. She doesn't see that Bill and Slim have
been shunted to the back. Suddenly...
...people get BOLDER. CLAPPING her on the back, reaching to
TOUCH her, someone SNATCHES her scarf, she looks around
frantically for Bill and Slim as...
...a SHERIFF and three DEPUTIES muscle their way to her using
billy clubs to push people back. They surround Amelia, begin
to escort her to the station...
33.
SHERIFF
Sorry Ma'am. Shoulda brought
more men.
AMELIA
No, really, this is very sweet,
it's an honor. I'm actually
enjoying it.
SHERIFF
That's a good thing.
She looks at him as they are jostled along.
SHERIFF (CONT'D)
Because you're stuck with it.
From here on.
She is brought to a smiling avuncular HILTON RAILEY, standing
beside the closest thing Burry Port has to a limo. She
throws an affectionate arm around him, kisses his cheek.
AMELIA
Hullo, Hilton.
Railey stands back as FLASHBULBS catch the moment.
He's
brought photographers with him. And more.
R
AILEY
Amelia, say hullo to Allen Raymond
of the New York Times.
A hearty handshake.
She holds out her sheets of paper.
AMELIA
I believe you've come for these.
Both men regard the pages as if they were gold bullion.
Come
for these indeed.

MOVIETONE FOOTAGE of Amelia being welcomed by a SEA OF PEOPLE

water. Ships circling, fireboats spray, every craft BLARES
its horn. Police hold back the screaming throng as FLASHES
EXPLODE and NEWSREEL CAMERAS CHURN. Amelia at the center of
the storm. Welcomed by AMY GUEST and the lady LORD MAYOR of
Southampton.
Throughout, we see SUPERIMPOSED IMAGES of the article she
gave Railey, displaying her byline, on the front pages of the
London Times, New York Times, the Times of India, Sydney
Morning Herald, the Toronto Star, Le Monde, as her story
echoes around the world. These IMAGES CONTINUE OVER...

Amelia flanked by George and Dorothy, coming out of a
reception hall. Amelia glances to George...
AMELIA
Guess you can burn those letters.
Dorothy wonders.
Letters?
GEORGE
I saved them for your book.
One simple shake of Amelia's head.
A soft...
AMELIA
The book's yours.
The letters are
mine.
He smiles.
Bows in submission.
GEORGE
ou're the boss.
36.
DOROTHY
Hey, that's my job.
(to Amelia)
Do you think there's enough of him
to boss for the two of us?
Amelia still looking at George.
Laughs.
AMELIA
Barely enough for one.
A battery of reporters and flashbulbs wait by our motorcade.
REPORTER
Miss Earhart, can you tell us some-
thing about your future plans?
S
he likes this question.
Fixes the man with that clear,
honest gaze.
AMELIA
Well, being a social worker by
trade and passion, I'll be going
back to work at Denison House when
all this fun is over.
She sends the guy a smile, and a dozen FLASHES catch it.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
...if I haven't been fired.
George holds the door of their limo. She looks up to him
with a mischievous smile. And with no warning...
...Amelia bypasses the limo, climbs into the SIDECAR of a
cop's motorcycle, and SMACKS its side. The cop looks up to
George, who...
...nods, go for it. And the cop DOES, wheeling out into
traffic, opening up the SIREN, as everyone laughs or cheers
or darts into the street desperate for a fleeting photo.
George watching her go.
Dorothy watching George.
REPORTER
Mr. Putnam, sir. How did a social
worker like Miss Earhart become
comfortable as a celebrity so
quickly?
George smiles.
His eyes still following Amelia.
GEORGE
The truth is, she was a celebrity
on smaller stages all her life.

GEORGE(cont'd)
This is just when the rest of us
discovered her.
And Dorothy.
Watches this, too.

Amelia in a sunlit garden ringed by trees. She sits at a
folding table, writing longhand. A large dog lies at her
feet.
AMELIA (V.O.)
So they took me home with them to
Rye. And I lived there, while I
wrote my book.
PULL BACK to see our view has been George's. He sits at an
antique writing desk, watching her through a picture window.
He rises slowly. We see that he has been reviewing a
CONTRACT, which he takes with him.
A
NGLE. Amelia writing, looking up to see George coming down
the back porch steps to the garden.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I thought he'd be a tyrant and that
I would have to manage him.
He smiles as he approaches.
She goes back to work.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Instead he was kind and generous.
And only picked the fights he
needed to win.
He drops the contract on her table.
She looks at it.
GEORGE
Lucky Strike endorsement.
I wrote
the copy myself.
AMELIA
What does it say?
`I don't smoke
but you should?'
GEORGE
It says Lucky Strikes were the only
cigarettes aboard the Friendship.
That's true.
AMELIA
True and misleading.
Why would I
sign that?
GEORGE
So Bill and Slim get paid.
38.
Oh.
His smile simple, comfortable.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
If you're too proud to take tobacco
money, donate it to Byrd's
expedition, and we get great
publicity.
She stares at him with hard eyes. His smile just becomes
more relaxed. An easy win, no big deal. She begins to sign
the contract. He places a stack of letters in front of her.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
This week's marriage proposals.
The top one's the most creative.
It's from Sing Sing.
She starts to read.
Her eyes widen.
Goodness.
AMELIA (reads)
`...in the prison yard, so everyone
can watch and share in our...'
(
looks up)
Did you write the copy on this one,
too?
DOROTHY (O.S., approaching)
Have you no shame, George? No
sense of the scandal you create?
They look up.
She has a tray of lemonade and cookies.
DOROTHY (CONT'D)
You make her work for nothing. At
least you can feed her.
(to Amelia)
Are you done yet? If not, make him
write the rest, he will anyway.
Here she comes along the roses, still drinking, still fuming.
A figure comes up behind her. Falls in step.
GEORGE
Lovely party, huh?
DOROTHY
Depends on your point of view.
I've been listening to some idiot
brag about his girlfriend.
Still walking.
She never looks at him.
GEORGE
Well, in that case, for your
information, it is a lovely party
indeed. Anything on your mind?
DOROTHY
It's not so much that my husband
is having an affair with his meal
ticket. It's just a pity we can't
have one honest conversation about
it.
GEORGE
What's wrong with this one? A
promising start, I'd say, in the
honesty department.
She finishes her drink. Throws the glass away. From our
ANGLE we can now see D
Amelia in the window, watching them.
OROTHY
If this is what you call an honest
talk, I'd say you need some
practice.
GEORGE
Great. Let's try one about you
and Fred Upton.
She stops walking.
Turns in shock, to see his easy smile.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Well, I'm waiting for our practice
conversation. Hoping I'll learn
something. About honesty.
44.
She GLARES at him, and storms off. He lets her go. Hear a
car engine TURN OVER. Dorothy PEELING OUT. George reflects.
As he walks back toward the party, he now sees Amelia in the
window. He stops. Their look holds.
42

Amelia and nearly 20 WOMEN lined up in front of planes.
Waving, smiling, talking to each other.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
Amelia Earhart and a bevy of lovely
competitors say hello to the press
announcing the First Women's Air
Derby, racing from Santa Monica to
Cleveland. Dubbed by Will Rogers
`the Powder Puff Derby,' these gals
certainly know how to capture our
attention.
The next ANGLE shows Amelia watching some of her colleagues
bouncing playfully on a see-saw. She smiles tolerantly, but
maybe there's a little too much cheesecake for her taste.
46

Amelia holds tight to George's hand, leading him out into the
falling snow. She turns, fixes him with a look. Hands him
the letter. And steps back. As if giving him space.
At first, he smiles. What is this? She gestures for him to
read. As he begins, there is nothing for a few seconds.
Then...
AMELIA (V.O.)
...I want you to understand I shall
not hold you to any medieval code
of faithfulness to me. Nor shall
I consider myself bound to you
similarly.
Snow falling.
Absolute silence.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
If we can be honest I think the
difficulties which may arise may
best be avoided should you or I
become interested deeply, or in
passing, with anyone else.
She gazes intently, her heart in her eyes.
He never looks
up.
M
52.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Please let us not interfere with
the other's work or play, nor let
the world see our private joys or
disagreements.
And then...
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I
must exact a cruel promise. And
that is you will let me go in a
year if we find no happiness
together.
He stops on this.
His thoughts unreadable.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I will try to do my best in every
way. And give you that part of me
you know and seem to want.
He folds the letter carefully.
Places it in his pocket.
And
smiles.
GEORGE
y Amelia. Brutal in her frank-
ness. Beautiful in her honesty.
He steps to her.
Looks in her eyes.
They kiss.

CLOSE on Amelia as she kneels, carefully putting new plants
into the ground. We see patience, concentration.
Contentment. After a moment...
AMELIA
I'm surprised you're all right with
this...
WIDEN ANGLE.
George kneeling beside her.
Happily planting
his own.
GEORGE
Really.
AMELIA
Mmm-hmmn. I was braced for the
lecture. Five years since
Lindbergh, no one's made it solo,
so many of them died.
He looks at her work. Reaches over. Starts packing the
earth HARDER around her plant. She just watches, then...
D
W
54.
GEORGE
ell, they were only men.
This is
different.
She reaches to his plant and starts LOOSENING the soil...
AMELIA
I was waiting to hear that I'm only
doing this because I was just a
passenger last time, and I'd rather
die than go on living as a fraud..
No one cracks a smile. It's like Laurel and Hardy in a food
fight where each lets the other take his best shot. George
A
reaches now, starts REPACKING her soil...
MELIA (CONT'D)
But you don't think that, do you,
ear?

Of course not. But if I did...
She SMACKS his hand. He just keeps working. She finally
grins, smacks him HARDER. He doesn't seem to notice.
GEORGE (CONT'D)

AERIAL ANGLE. In the sun's last light, two figures walk
slowly, far below us. The Vega waits.
CLOSE ANGLE. They stand beneath the wing. Her ground crew
in far distance, giving them their moment. Her look is not
breezy and cavalier this time, but tender and intimate. She
knows the fear beneath his easy smile.
He produces a RING, a band of black fibers.
GEORGE
Elephant hair, I think you wear
it on your toe. It's good luck.
He puts it in her hand.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Anyway. That's what the elephant
told me.
Amelia looks at the ring.
Turns it in her fingers.

AMELIA
I think luck has rules. And I try
to respect them. My favorite is...
She glances up.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
We make our own luck, you and I.
Remember that.
He will remember that.
And more.
GEORGE
Do you have money?
AMELIA
No.
He pulls out a twenty dollar bill.
Hands it to her.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
All this? G
EORGE
Sure.
AMELIA
Thank god, I thought you were going
to tear it in half.
GEORGE
I spent our money on ocean liner
passage to go bring you back. It's
non-refundable. So try to do your
part.
She nods.
She'll try.
He doesn't want to leave her yet.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
So the Simpkin thing. What was all
that?
AMELIA
I put it in a letter. Which you'll
get if I don't make it. So...mixed
emotions, huh?
He shakes his head.
GEORGE (very soft)
Either way, something to look
forward to.
She puts her hands on his face.
She doesn't want to leave
him either.

AMELIA (murmurs)
Stake up the peonies, huh? They're
messy when they bloom on the
ground, and...
And.
AMELIA (a whisper)
I want to see their heads high.
When I come home.
She leans up to kiss him. And again.
Feeling in her eyes
that he will never forget.

GEORGE (O.S.)
Are they completely sure it's her
plane?
MCGUIRE (O.S.)
Yes sir, absolutely.
...the Vega RIGHTS itself and GLIDES in for as fine a landing
as a bumpy meadow could allow. COWS look up as she rolls
past, toward...

She cuts her engines,
leans from the hatch...

Excuse me, sir. Where am I?
A blink.
The truth...

ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
Amelia Earhart arrives to a tumul-
tuous New York reception after her
whirlwind tour of Europe, in which
our Queen of the Skies danced with
her royal counterpart the Prince of
Wales, before meeting both Benito
Mussolini and the Pope.
The MAYOR, the GOVERNOR, every dignitary that could get an
invitation is there to greet her.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
The second human to fly the
Atlantic solo, she is the only one
ever to fly it twice. And she set
the record, man or woman, for the
fastest crossing. Fourteen hours
54 minutes.
As she waves to the crowd...

music playing from within. Gene climbs from the cab, as yard
lights go ON.
As Gene starts up the path, the front door opens and Amelia
BURSTS into the night, RUNNING to Gene, JUMPING INTO his
arms, HUGGING him in her delight. We PULL BACK to...
George watching it all from the doorway.
His easy smile
seems comfortably in place, as...
...Amelia walks Gene up the path, her arm around his waist,
talking excitedly, flushed as a schoolgirl. As they reach
the door...
George is the picture of calm and dignity. He beams and
CLASPS Gene's hand. Throws an arm around his shoulder as
Amelia leads them inside.
The door closes.
We hear laughter.

When are you leaving?
GEORGE
Thing is.
I'd like you to come.
She stiffens only slightly.
Can he sense it?
AMELIA
I don't really see how I can.
GEORGE
I've talked to the promoters,
they'll switch some lecture dates
for us.
Now he's looking at her profile.
Saddened, if not surprised,
by what he sees.
AMELIA
Well, it's not just that. There's
y work on the shuttle, we're at a
critical stage, and...I've just
started as Gene's consultant at the
Aeronautics Branch...
She knows he's watching.
Shakes her head.
Keeps on working.
GEORGE
Normally, I'd be worried about
leaving you here alone. But I
suppose that won't be a problem,
will it?
She stops now. Looks up at him.
If he wants a direct
conversation, he can have it.

What are you trying to say?

A long held look.
Neither backing away.
Sadness on both
sides.
GEORGE (softly)
Is there anything you want to say?
She sighs.
Her fingers reach out, rub his hand with
affection.
AMELIA
I can't think of anything helpful.
He nods.
Well, then.

NNOUNCER (O.S.)
The odyssey began in Honolulu when
he became the first person, man

Pacific to California.
Touching down, the cheering CROWD held back by police. As
Amelia taxies to a stop, the crowd BREAKS THROUGH police
lines and SURGES toward the plane.
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Then, the first human to solo from
California to Mexico City. Followed
by her daring solo across the Gulf.
As she passed over Washington,

GEORGE
Boy, that is the last thing I'd
want.
Well, then?

GEORGE (CONT'D)
I only thought that if you're
serious about this around-the-world
nonsense. It might be handy to
have a plane to fly in.
AMELIA
Except it would have to be an
Electra, and they cost...
GEORGE
...$36,000. After a generous
discount from Lockheed.
AMELIA
May as well be a billion.
GEORGE
...not to mention at least another

She glances at him.
He looks awfully smug.
AMELIA
And your surprise is, you robbed a
bank.
GEORGE
Actually.
A university.

I've sort of persuaded Ed Elliot to
create an Amelia Earhart Fund for
Aeronautical Research at Purdue.
And suggested a budget item of...

...oh, eighty grand. For a
suitable `flying laboratory.'
Her eyes just bug out.
No!
He nods, slowly.
Uh-huh.
And
she...
...THROWS her arms around his neck, KISSING him hard enough
G

Nah.

By the way. That's not the

Uh-uh.

magnificently carved CHEST. On a crest in the front: AE.
We PAN the surface, to see planes, oceans, a shamrock for the
Londonderry landing, dozens more symbols of her triumphs, and
in a bottom corner, looking up at all of this in wonder...
...a small cat.
In a long frock coat.
GEORGE (a whisper)
Merry Christmas.
Her tears just come. She's standing on Park Avenue and she
can't do anything about it. He reaches a tender hand...

He is her hero.
See it in her
eyes.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
Can't wait to see what you got me.
She sniffles.
AMELIA
Cat food.
A whole case.
A Coast Guard station overlooking the Pacific. A lone woman
leans on a railing. From the station, a MAN emerges, he
has...
...a thermos and two large mugs. He pours steaming coffee
into each, and brings them to the woman at the rail. She has
turned to study him as he approaches.
AMELIA
Hullo, Fred. It's good to meet
you.
She holds out her hand. He juggles the mugs, so he can shake
it. Strong look in each other's eyes. Hands her a mug...
FRED
I hear you like your coffee black.
AMELIA
This time of day, I like it with
bacon and eggs.
His slight grin.
A handsome guy.

Lovely. We've got so much fuel we

A wrenching battle, plane versus monsoon. The storm is
heavier, deafening, actually STRIPPING PAINT from the
Electra's wings.

Establishing shot of a graceful pillar of the Raj.
Night

A fountain in an ornate courtyard. There is a RECEPTION, as
every evening for Amelia, attended by local DIGNITARIES.
Fred, already a little drunk, leads Amelia to a massive teak-
wood table. He breaks off the corner of a cracker, sets it
down in the center of the table.
FRED
Howland Island.
He strikes a match. SNUFFS the flame. Puts the burned-out
match head just by the scrap of cracker.
FRED (CONT'D)
B
lack smoke from the Navy ship that
could help us get a fix.
Points way across the marble courtyard.
FRED (CONT'D)
Now stand over there. That's what
it's going to look like, if the
weather's good.
SERVANT (O.S.)
Mrs. Earhart?
She glances up.
He beckons respectfully.
NGLE. Alcove still with a VIEW of Fred and the courtyard.
She lifts a telephone...
INTERCUT:

...Amelia's FACE, as we left it in the first scene. The
STORM PELTING all around the open-sided bar. Fred studying
her across the table.
FRED
A touching love story, really.
He's been drinking, we can hear it in his voice.
SEE the
bottle now. Nearly gone.
AMELIA
An honest one. It's what you
wanted.
He nods.
That's right.
Y

FRED
I wonder if it's honest enough for
George. If it's what he wanted.
ou know.
AMELIA
If you mean Gene, we're not
together anymore. In that way.
Not for a long time.
FRED
Whose choice was that?
She doesn't like his tone.
Shifts in her seat.
AMELIA
It was mine.
FRED
Well, isn't it always? You choose
in, you choose out. Makes things
easy.
AMELIA
Anything but easy. Are you
disapproving of the way I live?
FRED
Hell, no. It's just like me. In
fact, it's like most guys I know.
His smile.
FRED (CONT'D)
Actually, I'd like a piece of it
myself. Right about now.
Her eyes harden.
A
MELIA
If you have a point, Fred.
Make
it.
FRED
Oh, I believe I have.
She rises slowly. Zips her flight jacket.
Takes her slicker
from the back of her chair.
AMELIA
Allow me to cut you a deal, my
friend.
Steel in the spine of that.
114.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
You show up tomorrow morning.
You show up sober and you get
me to Howland Island.
Okay?
AMELIA (CONT'D)
And I'll forget you ever said that.
She WHEELS around and holding her slicker over her head, goes
OFF into the POUNDING RAIN.
Fred's smile is gone.
He stares after her.
DISSOLVE TO...

Amelia down the path in her slicker toward a small hut.
She
knocks. Opens the door to reveal...

A sober, contrite Fred comes down the runway in early light.
As he reaches the Electra, he sees a pile of discarded
OBJECTS on the tarmac...
...metal containers, carton of oranges, parachutes.
Bedrolls, cold weather gear. Souvenirs from their stops:
flags, a metal plaque, native crafts, a Welcome Miss Amelia
Earhart banner. As he studies the pile...
...a COFFEE POT comes FLYING out of the plane to roll at his
feet. Suddenly, a 10 pound coffee tin SAILS PAST, as he
DUCKS. Amelia appears at the hatch, sees him.
G
118.
FRED
You're finding the range. But it
might be easier to just shoot me.
She stares at him for a moment.
A subdued voice...
AMELIA
Traveling light, that's all.
She sits on the lip of the hatch.
Her legs dangling.
Her
eyes down.
FRED
Got room for 190 pounds of asshole?
No answer.
She's still looking down.
He's never seen her
like this.
FRED (CONT'D)
M
a'am, I am so sor...
AMELIA
It's fine.
Her eyes come up.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
Everything is.
He doesn't understand, but he's glad to be forgiven. She
takes a LETTER from her pocket. Runs her finger over the
envelope.
FRED
I can run into town before we go.
et that in the post for you.
She shakes her head slowly.
AMELIA
It's for my husband. I'm going to
hand it to him. So I can watch his
face as he reads it.
She sniffles slightly.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
It's our tradition.

A RUNWAY that ends in a drop-off at the waters of Huon Gulf.
The Electra, engines REVVING. Ready to go for it. Our ANGLE
CLOSES on the belly of the plane. The ANTENNA MAST
supporting a trailing WIRE ANTENNA.
119.
GEORGE (V.O.)
Ten A.M., Friday July 2. They
lined up on the thousand-yard
runway. One thousand gallons of
fuel, enough for 20 to 21 hours of
flying.
LONG ANGLE. Crew and onlookers watch as the plane STARTS its
run, gathering speed, BOUNCING over uneven ground...
CLOSE now on the jouncing undercarriage, a momentary PUFF of
DUST, and as the plane moves PAST, we may notice that the
belly antenna mast seems to be GONE.
DOWN the runway it RUMBLES, still earthbound, only 200 yards
to go. Then 100. Then FIFTY, then at the water's edge, the
Electra RISES and...
.
..DROPS out of sight below the land, as we SMASH CUT to...
ANGLE. The Electra has FALLEN to SIX FEET above the surface
of the Gulf. The engines THROB at max, the propellers
THROWING SPRAY. The overloaded plane...
...RISING.
Slowly, then faster, then...
...SOARING free.
PULL BACK to a VIEW from down the runway. The Electra in
distance. RACK FOCUS to see something long and slender
GLINTING on the ground. Could it be a length of WIRE?
ERIAL ANGLE. A tiny, flat, nearly invisible speck adrift in
the endless Pacific. Howland Island. PAN to see just
offshore...
GEORGE (V.O.)
The U.S. Coast Guard cutter Itasca
had been anchored off Howland just
for us.
CLOSE on the ITASCA now...
GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Its radio would be her lifeline.
Its black plume of smoke would
reach for miles. More visible than
the island itself.
DISSOLVE TO NIGHT. The island visible only by its slender
LIGHTHOUSE. The ship illuminated in the darkness.
CLOSE now on a path by the sea. A lone figure with a
FLASHLIGHT approaches a SHACK. Enters...
110
110
CLOSE on the ship, illuminated.
PUSH IN...
121.
111

114

Alone.
In a moonlit garden.
GEORGE (V.O.)
If I tried to count the insane and
reckless chances she took from the
first moment I met her. I wouldn't
know where to begin.
Slowly to his knees.
By the plants they had tended together.
GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It was the most tragic of endings.
The most cruel and senseless and
wasteful. And yet...
And yet.
GEORGE (CONT'D)
It's hard to imagine another.
SMASH CUT TO...
115
115
Sun and cloud.
The sea below.
AMELIA (V.O.)
My Simpkin.
We POINT toward the water.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I want to be married to you. The
way you've been married to me.
It begins to draw CLOSER.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
As you read this. I am watching
your face.
127.
And CLOSER.
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I am hoping to see. That you know
how much I mean each word.
Gaining SPEED now...
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
All the things I never said, for
so very long...
HURTLING TOWARD the surface...
AMELIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Look up. They're in my eyes.
SMASH CUT TO BLACK.
Hold.
ROLL END CREDITS.
Amelia
