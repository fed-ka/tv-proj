  EXT. KANSAS - MORNING11

  An Amtrak train snakes through the countryside.  The January 
  morning is so cold, it's clean.  Welcome to Kansas.

  EXT. AMTRAK TRAIN - MORNING22

  The wheels of the train chug along.  We watch this image long 
  enough to wonder why we re watching it for so long.

  INT. AMTRAK BAR CAR - MORNING33

  The intercom announces,  Next Stop, Topeka!  as we move down 
  the aisle, past businessmen and tourists, reading their 
  papers.  Each paper has a different photo and a differently 
  worded headline.  But all of them tell us one thing...  The 
  President s State of the Union Address is tonight.

  We move past two little girls pointing out the window,  Dad, 
  lookit!  and finally land on... JAKE GREEN, 27, the charming 
  prodigal son.  Jake is old movie handsome.  A rogue.  
  Troubled.  As he sips his whiskey, he looks sad and deep in 
  thought.  Jake stares through the window as billboards 
  advertising the Golden Eagle Casino and Trading Post roll by.

                                JOVIAL MAN (O.S.)
                Tough day?

  Jake turns to find a chubby JOVIAL MAN, 47, smiling.

                                JOVIAL MAN (CONT D)
                Just curious why you re drinking so 
                early in the morning?  Break-up?  
                Lay off?  Titans fan?

                              JAKE
                      (finds himself smiling)
                No.  I m going back home for the 
                day.  Going to visit my grandfather.

                                JOVIAL MAN
                Is that bad?

                              JAKE
                No.  The bad part is seeing my 
                father and brother.
                      (gestures like a boxer)
                Dad will hit me with the 'you're a 
                  disappointment' right, and Peter 
                will come in with the 'family 
                values' left.  Good times.                                                                                  2.



                                JOVIAL MAN
                      (smiles)
                Let me guess.  You re grandpa s 
                  favorite?

                              JAKE
                I don t know.  But he was my 
                  favorite.

  They smile.  Jake points to the man s empty beers...

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                What about you?  Why are you 
                drinking so early in the morning?

                                JOVIAL MAN
                Because I m a drunk.

  INT. AMTRAK STATION - TOPEKA, KANSAS - MORNING44

  Jake s laughter becomes the squeal of the train s brakes.  
  Jake exits the train and passes baggage handlers, pushing 
  luggage carts.  If we look closely, we see one of them load a 
  silver suitcase on the train.

  EXT. PARKING GARAGE - TOPEKA, KANSAS - MORNING55

  Jake s taxi moves through the city streets, then enters a 12 
  story parking garage with a sign... Monthly Rates Available.

  INT. PARKING GARAGE - 8TH FLOOR - MORNING66

  The taxi moves around a cement pilar to reveal... a vintage 
  Ford Mustang Convertible.  Jake turns to the taxi driver.

                              JAKE
                You got jumper cables?

  INT. PARKING GARAGE - GROUND FLOOR - MORNING77

  Jake, now sitting in the Mustang, hands his ticket to the 
  TICKET TAKER, an African American woman, about 31.  She looks 
  at the ticket.  All yellow and faded.  She s confused.

  INT. PARKING GARAGE OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER88

  The ticket taker enters the messy office and approaches her 
  BOSS, a gruff man.  She holds up Jake s ticket.

                                TICKET TAKER
                I don t know what to do with this.                                                                                  3.



                              BOSS
                What do you mean?  Take his money.

                                TICKET TAKER
                You don t understand.  This man s 
                had his car here for... 5 years.

  EXT. KANSAS INTERSTATE HIGHWAY 77 - LATE MORNING99

  We see a MOTORCYCLE GANG making life hell for a student 
  driver, then move over to Jake's Mustang as it pulls off the 
  crowded highway.  A sign reads... Jericho 87 miles.

  INT. JAKE'S MUSTANG - LATE MORNING1010

  Jake flips through the radio dial.  Bill O Reilly blurts, 
   Larry.  Pensicola, Florida.  Go.   Larry,  Hey, Bill.  So, 
  the State of the Union tonight...   Jake changes the channel.  
  Rush Limbaugh groans,  It makes me ill that the President s 
  speech is going to acknowledge this liberal--   Click.  Al 
  Franken says,  The arrogance of this administration--   
  Click.   ... it ll be cold tonight.  Low in the mid 20 s. 

  Jake finally finds some music.  Bad Company s anthem,  Bad 
  Company.   Our new title song.  Ahh.  Much better.

  EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - LATE MORNING1111

  The image goes high as the Mustang cuts through the 
    countryside.  Jake passes rivers, streams, bridges, farms.  
  Jericho may be isolated, but nobody can say that the ride to 
  it isn t gorgeous.  No traffic.  Blues skies.  Peace.

  EXT. POTAWATOMI NATION INDIAN CAVES - LATER1212

  As Jake pulls up to a stop sign, he looks to his right to 
  see... a JERICHO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUS.  The CHUBBY BUS 
  DRIVER stands in front of the bus s smoking engine.  He 
  shakes his head in frustration and pulls out his cell phone.  
  Jake shifts his glance to the PRETTY TEACHER as she guides a 
  group of excited 2ND GRADE KIDS into the visitor s center.

                                PRETTY TEACHER
                Come on, kids.  Single file now.  
                      (a fat girl trips)
                Oh, dear.  Are you okay, Hilda?

  EXT. PETERSON FAMILY FARM - ROADSIDE STAND - AFTERNOON1313

  As customers browse the farm s roadside stand, BONNIE 
  PETERSON, 17 and cheer-leader juicy, sits behind the cash 
  register.  She text messages her boyfriend.   I miss you so 
  much.  Can you come back this weekend?                                                                                   4.



                              STANLEY PETERSON
                BONNIE!

  Startled, Bonnie turns to her big brother, STANLEY PETERSON, 
  27, an avid car lover who has no luck with women.

                              STANLEY PETERSON (CONT D)
                Mom and dad didn t keep you out of 
                school today so you could text 
                message your boyfriend.
                      (off Bonnie s groan)
                I know.   He moved away.  My life 
                is over.  Blah blah.   Put down the 
                phone, Bonnie!

  Bonnie grumbles.  Stanley turns and sees Jake climb out of 
  his Mustang.  At first, Stanley can't believe his eyes.  
  Then, a smile creeps over his face.  Jake approaches.  The 
  two old friends smile.  And then, Stanley starts hugging him.

                              STANLEY PETERSON (CONT'D)
                I can t believe it.  Jake Green!  
                My God.  When you get back to town?

                              JAKE
                Just now.

                              STANLEY PETERSON
                You seen Emily yet?  The family?

                              JAKE
                I just got back now, Stanley.

                              STANLEY PETERSON
                Oh, right.  Right.  Sorry.  Wait.  
                Where the hell have you been?

                              JAKE
                Around.

                              STANLEY PETERSON
                No one is  around  for 5 years.  

                              JAKE
                Believe it or not... the Army.

  Just then, a woman emerges from the farm house.  MIMI CLARK 
  is 30, sexy, stylish, Jewish, urbanite, and couldn't look 
  more out of place.  Stanley s good humor instantly vanishes.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Who s that?                                                                                  5.



                              STANLEY PETERSON
                That?  That s the government.

                              JAKE
                Sexy government.

  Mimi Clark runs frightened from a chicken.   Ewww! 

                              STANLEY PETERSON
                Don t let the style fool you, Jake.  
                Miss  shiver me timbers  is from 
                the I.R.S.

                              JAKE
                IRS?  Audit?... Not going well?

                              STANLEY PETERSON
                Forget it.  How about you and me 
                get together tonight?  Catch up?

                              JAKE
                I d love to, but I m only in to see 
                my grandpa, then I gotta get back.  
                So, if I can get my mother s 
                favorite Peterson Apple Pie...

  Stanley nods, slaps Jake s shoulder, and turns to find...

                              STANLEY PETERSON
                BONNIE!

  Bonnie drops the phone and scrambles to get Jake's order.

                              STANLEY PETERSON (CONT D)
                Welcome back to Jericho, Jake.

  EXT. JERICHO - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - AFTERNOON1414

  We see it all through Jake s eyes.  Unlike most of flat, 
  dusty Kansas, Jericho is nestled in the foothills.  It s a 
  town that embraces its Old West roots and Frontier Spirit.  A 
  statue reads... Welcome to Jericho: We Stand Strong.  
  ELECTION POSTERS hang on every storefront and telephone pole.  
  ELECT GRAY ANDERSON.  RE-ELECT MAYOR GREEN.  All to the 
  lovely sounds of Sean Hannity raving on the radio...

                              SEAN HANNITY (V.O.)
                ... we got an advanced copy, and 
                let me tell you, friends, this 
                speech is going down in history.  
                Bold agenda.  Bold.  Okay, who do 
                we have?  Tiffany in Homestead, 
                  Pennsylvania.  Hi, Tiffany.                                                                                  6.



  As Tiffany tells Sean he s a great American, Jake turns off 
  the radio and keeps driving.  To his right, Jake sees a 
  moving truck.  ROD HAWKINS, 39, serious, African American 
  tips the movers as his wife and kids play in the yard.  
  Suddenly, POLICE LIGHTS FLASH behind Jake.  Jake pulls over.  
  He looks in the side view mirror as two ominous pairs of 
  policeman s legs approach.  Jake sighs until...

                              JIMMY
                  I thought I recognized this car.

  Jake looks at JIMMY, 42, and BILL, 42, two best friends and 
  the laughing stock of the police force.  They smile at Jake.

                              JAKE
                Hey Jimmy, Bill.  Still buying 
                those lottery tickets?

                              JIMMY
                Man, if we ever win the lottery, 
                our wives are going to become world 
                  travelers.  

                              BILL
                Yeah, they re going to go 
                  everywhere looking for us.

  Jimmy and Bill laugh.  Jake smiles.  Same old joke.

                              BILL (CONT'D)
                So, where you been hiding, Jake? 

                              JAKE
                Believe it or not... the rodeo.

  INT. GRACIE LEIGH S SUPERMARKET - AFTERNOON1515

  A poster endorsing Mayor Green hangs in the window of this 
    medium-sized supermarket and trading post.  STEPHANIE 
    LANCASTER, 16, a teenage princess of the highest order, 
  samples lipstick.  She complains to the cute tech nerd, ALVIE 
  CLEMONS, 15, who worships her like a beaten dog.  They ve 
  been friends since they were 3 years old.

                                STEPHANIE
                I ll never forgive my parents for 
                not taking me on their trip to New 
                York.  I could be shopping on 5th 
                Avenue right now instead of...
                      (referring to lipsticks)
                Look at this sad collection.  This 
                color was out of style before it 
                was invented.                                                                                  7.



                              ALVIE
                I think it looks nice on you.

                                STEPHANIE
                That s because you re staring at my 
                chest, Alvie.

                              ALVIE
                Yes, I am.  But, we really should 
                get back to--

                                STEPHANIE
                Would you forget about studying for 
                the SAT s and live a little?

                              ALVIE
                You re right, Stephanie.  Forget 
                M.I.T. and my dreams of a happy 
                life.  Let s ponder your chest.

  We move to the counter, where Jake indulges the never-ending 
  gossip of good-natured GRACIE LEIGH, 45.  Gracie almost scans 
  his bouquet of flowers and Swiss Army Knife... several times.

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                ... his name is Rod Hawkins.  That 
                new man.  I think his wife is 
                lovely, but him... I don t know.  
                Mrs. Olson made me promise not to 
                tell anyone, but she heard he 
                bought that nice house in cash.  
                Cash.  Promise not to tell anyone.

                              JAKE
                Scout s honor, Mrs. Leigh.

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                So, how about you, Jake?  Where you 
                been keeping yourself all this 
                time?

                              JAKE
                Promise not to tell Mrs. Olson.
                      (off her crossed heart)
                Believe it or not... I ve been 
                playing minor league baseball.

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                That a fact?

                              JAKE
                Scout s honor.                                                                                  8.



  EXT. GRACIE LEIGH S SUPERMARKET - MOMENTS LATER1616

  As Jake leaves the store, he sees a woman coming out of her 
  car.  EMILY SPENSER, 26, is young, pretty, and idealistic.  
  Jake's heart skips a beat.  She flirts into her cell phone.

                              EMILY
                No, it s a surprise.  No, Roger.  
                You ll find out tonight.  Now, when 
                do you get in from Chicago?

  Emily looks up to see Jake.  Her heart skips a beat.  Emily 
  is immediately distracted as she talks into her cell phone.

                              EMILY (CONT D)
                11 o clock.  I ll see you tonight.
                      (locking eyes with Jake)
                I love you, too.

  She hangs up.  Jake and Emily look at each other.  It hangs 
  in the air for a long, charged moment.

                              JAKE
                Hi, Emily.

                              EMILY
                Jake.  My God.  What--

    A complete loss for words.

                              JAKE
                Yeah.  I just came in for the day.  
                See my grandfather.  The family.

                              EMILY
                Sure.  I just... I didn t hear.

                              JAKE
                Well, I would have called, but... I 
                have to get back to Santa Fe.
                      (off her look)
                Long boring story.  How have you 
                been?  Mom tells me you re teaching 
                at the high school now.

                              EMILY
                I know.  Weird, huh?  But it s 
                good.  Other than teaching the kids 
                I used to baby-sit.  But I love it.  
                Just got a house in the Pines.

                              JAKE
                East Side?  On a teacher s salary?                                                                                  9.



                              EMILY
                Well... my... fianc  is in banking.

  Just the word.  Fianc .  Jake does his best to keep it light.

                              JAKE
                That helps.  Do I know him?

                              EMILY
                No, I was at a conference.  We met 
                in Chicago.
                      (off his look)
                I know.  A city boy, right?  But 
                Roger loves small town life.

  Jake nods.  He never did.  Finally... 

                              JAKE
                Well, I m happy for you, Emily.  I 
                mean, you know, other than...
                      (turns on charm)
                ... the part of me that s dying.

  Emily laughs.  It breaks the ice.  All kidding now.

                              EMILY
                How about you?  You have somebody?

                              JAKE
                No.

                              EMILY
                I m sorry.

                              JAKE
                No, you re not.  You love it. 

  Emily laughs.  Jake keeps smiling and riffing.

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                You won the reunion.  You know it.  
                Look at you.  

                              EMILY
                      (huge smile)
                Where have you been all these 
                years?

                              JAKE
                Believe it or not... the navy.

  Emily gives him a look.  Jake smiles.  Guilty boy grin.                                                                                10.



                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Right.  You always know when I m 
                lying.  One of your less attractive 
                  qualities.

                              EMILY
                  Seriously, Jake.  Where you been?

  The laughs are over.  Jake looks at the ground.  Decides.

                              JAKE
                Can you keep a secret?

  INT. GRACIE LEIGH S SUPERMARKET - AFTERNOON1717

  We see Jake and Emily through the large storefront window.  
  The stock boy, DALE TURNER, 16, is the trailer park kid 
  everybody picks on.  Dale watches Jake lean in to whisper in 
  Emily s ear.  Dale s jealous.  Stephanie Lancaster smirks.

                                STEPHANIE
                Well, here s to you, Mrs. Robinson. 
                Dale, do you really think you have 
                a chance with Miss Spenser or any 
                girl in her right mind?

  Dale looks away, embarrassed, and goes back to sweeping.

                              ALVIE
                Leave him alone, Stephanie.  He s 
                got enough problems.

  Dale takes one more look as Emily and Jake hug and say good-
  bye.  The door rings as Emily enters the store.  She s very 
  sad.  Whatever Jake told her, it s not good.

  EXT. GREEN FAMILY HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - AFTERNOON1818

  Ding dong.  Jake waits at the door, nervously.  We hear 
    footsteps.  Then, the door opens, revealing Jake s mother.  
  GAIL GREEN, 56, is a brilliant politician's wife and a cooler 
  lady.  Strong.  Savvy.  Jake presents the apple pie.  They 
  both break out in smiles.  Then, they both break out in hugs.

  INT. MAYOR GREEN'S DEN - MOMENTS LATER1919

  MAYOR JOHNSTON GREEN, 58, small town charming, and PETER 
  GREEN, the 33 year old star of the family, hold an informal 
  meeting with Jericho s answer to a labor crisis.  On the side 
  of labor is union boss, SHEP CALE, 45, a blue collar Joe.  
  The Mayor hangs back, waiting for his moment to intervene.                                                                                11.



                              PETER
                We re all in agreement about that.

                              SHEP
                No, we re not in agreement, Peter.  
                My men have been promised safety 
                  equipment, a cost of living increa--

  On the side of management is NORMAN PERRY, 42, a high strung 
  workaholic.  He groans.

                                NORMAN
                You were not promised, Mr. Cale.

                              SHEP
                I m not talking to you, Mr. Perry.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                 Mr. Perry?  Mr. Cale?   For God s 
                sake, you two used to get drunk in 
                high school together.  Remember?  
                Look, that factory keeps this town 
                alive.  So, I don t want to hear 
                anything about strikes or lock 
                outs.  I want you two to sit down 
                like gentlemen and talk this thing 
                through.  That s what we do in 
                Jericho.  We don t feud.

  Shep and Norman look off screen.  Then... 

                              SHEP
                We don t feud, huh?

  The Mayor looks confused until he turns to the doorway to 
  find... Jake.  The Mayor turns instantly chilly.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                You re early.


                                END OF TEASER                                                                                12.


                                    ACT ONE

  INT. GREEN FAMILY HOUSE - LATER2020

  The door opens to reveal Peter's wife, ANN GREEN, 33, 
  Jericho's answer to Hillary Clinton when she moved to 
  Arkansas.  Normally, the Green family would stop to say 
  hello, but right now, they are too busy with...

                              MAYOR GREEN (O.S.)
                ... don t you know I m fighting for 
                my political life?

                              JAKE (O.S.)
                Dad, I am not here to interfere 
                with your campaign.  All I want is 
                your signature, then I ll visit 
                grandpa, then--

                              PETER
                After 5 years?  That s all you have 
                to say to dad?

                              JAKE
                Peter, it s none of your business.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                It is his business.  It s all our 
                  business.  What you have put this 
                family through--

                              GAIL
                  Johnston, please.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                No, Gail.  He could have been a--

                              JAKE
                Dad, we could spend a week talking 
                about what I could have been.  I 
                have apologized.  I have made 
                amends.  This is me now.  I have a 
                plan.  But I need my money to--

                              MAYOR GREEN
                It isn t your money.  It s your 
                  grandfather s money.  

                              JAKE
                I know it s his, dad.  I didn t ask 
                for it.  But he gave it to me for a 
                reason.                                                                                13.



                              MAYOR GREEN
                And he gave me authority over it 
                for a reason.  So, when you 
                convince me you re leading a more 
                  productive life--

                              JAKE
                That s why he gave me the mone--

                              MAYOR GREEN
                You start the new life.  Then, you 
                get the money.  It doesn t work the 
                other way around.  

                              PETER
                That s right, Jake.

                              JAKE
                Peter, we were both born on 3rd 
                base.  Stop pretending you hit a 
                triple.

  Peter is silent.  Jake turns back to his father.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                You always look for the easy road, 
                Jake.  And I can t let you this 
                time.  I can t give you something 
                and watch you squander it again.  
                It s like that time I gave you my 
                swiss army knife from the war, and--

  Jake produces the new swiss army knife he bought at Gracie s 
  store from his pocket and hands it to his father.

                              JAKE
                I know the next 50 things you re 
                going to say, dad.  I wish I could 
                give you back the real one, but I 
                can t.  I am not here to fight.  I 
                just want to make grandpa proud.  
                So, just sign the papers, so we can 
                all get on with our lives.

  The Mayor looks at the knife, then hands it back to Jake.

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                Dad, when are you going to realize 
                that I m 27 years old?

                              MAYOR GREEN
                When you do.                                                                                14.



  With that, the Mayor goes into his den and closes the door.

                              JAKE
                Peter, you know this is unfair.

  Peter, the loyal daddy s boy, says nothing.  He leaves the 
  house with Ann, who shrugs.   Sorry, Jake.   Gail approaches.

                              GAIL
                Let s visit your grandfather.

  EXT. BAPTIST CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON2121

  The tombstone reads... "Peter Jake Green: Beloved Father.  
    Grandfather.  Mayor."  Jake takes the bouquet of flowers he 
  bought at Gracie s store, then kneels down.  He places the 
  flowers on his grandfather s grave.  It s a painful moment 
  for him.  Gail is a rock for him.

                              JAKE
                Mom, I m sorry I couldn t come to 
                the funeral.

                              GAIL
                It s okay.  I understand.  And 
                don t worry about dad.  I ll work 
                on him.  In the meantime...

  Gail holds out a handful of bills.  Jake shakes his head, no.

                              JAKE
                Thanks, but I didn t come here for 
                charity.

                              GAIL
                Are you sure you can t stay?

                              JAKE
                I have to get back by tomorrow.  
                You know that.

  They move to his Mustang.  They hug for a long time.  Gail 
  quietly slips the wad of bills into Jake s coat pocket.

                              GAIL
                When will I see you again?

                              JAKE
                Whenever you can visit Santa Fe.  
                      (off her look)
                Mom, I can t start a new life in 
                the old one.  This is the last day 
                I ll ever spend in Jericho.                                                                                15.



  One kiss.  Jake climbs into his car.  Gail smiles, sadly.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Oh, mom.  One more thing...

  Gail walks up to the driver s side window.  Jake puts the 
  bills back in her hand.  And smiles.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                You have clumsy hands.

  She smiles.  Jake pulls away.  Gail watches her boy go down 
  the foothills and to the horizon as the sun begins to set.

  INT. GREEN FAMILY HOUSE - DUSK2222

  Gail walks into the house to find a very angry Mayor Green.

                              GAIL
                  Johnston, when you give birth, you 
                can tell me about taking sides.

  The law is laid down.  The two sit down in front of the TV as 
  the State of the Union Address begins.  The page shouts, 
   Ladies and gentleman.  The President of the United States! 

  INT. PETER AND ANN GREEN'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER2323

  Applause.  The President takes the podium as Peter puts his 
  arm around his wife, Ann, holding their 6 MONTH OLD BABY.

                              PETER
                      (hurt)
                Jake s going to tell me about 
                things being unfair.

  INT. PETERSON FARM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER2424

  The President drinks in the applause as Stanley Peterson 
    approaches his parents in the living room.  MR. and MRS. 
  PETERSON, 54, both salt of the earth, shake their heads.  
  They hand the final IRS bill to Stanley.  $131,852.  

  Stanley looks over at Bonnie, who is text messaging her 
    boyfriend.   We re going to lose the farm. 

  INT. JIMMY'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER2525

  The President holds up his hands and the applause slowly dies 
  down.  Jimmy, Bill, and their respective kids watch the TV.  
  Jimmy's son, WOODY, 9, looks up at Jimmy.                                                                                16.



                              WOODY
                Do we have to watch this?

  Jimmy and Bill look into the kitchen at their two ball-
  breaking wives, both named MARGARET, giving them the eye.

                              JIMMY
                Sorry, kid.  Mom wants us to 
                improve ourselves.

  INT. GRACIE LEIGH'S STORE - MOMENTS LATER2626

  The President begins, "Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, 
  members of Congress, my fellow Americans..."

  Dale Turner gets ready to leave for the night as Gracie Leigh 
  gossips into the phone.  

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                ... You heard me.  Minor league 
                  baseball.  He and Emily were

                      (to Dale Turner)
                Thanks, Dale.  See you tomorrow.

  Dale Turner waves, then leaves the store.  Back to the phone.

                Everyone thought they were going to 
                get married back in the day...

  INT. EMILY SPENSER'S NEW HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER2727

  "... by law and custom, we meet here once a year in this 
  sacred chamber to discuss the state of our union... 

  Emily looks at an old YEARBOOK picture of Jake.  The 
  inscription reads.   Emily, I ll love you until the day I 
  die.   She shakes herself out of her nostalgia, turns up her 
  iPod, and goes back to the champagne, flowers, and candles to 
  make her fianc  s arrival perfect.  The post-it note reads... 
  Roger s flight.  Kansas City Airport.  11:00pm.

  INT. JAKE'S MUSTANG - MOMENTS LATER2828

   Tonight, with a growing economy, with...   

  Jake switches off the radio and continues to move down the 
  rural road.  He sighs.                                                                                17.



  INT. BAILEY'S TAVERN - MOMENTS LATER2929

  We scan the old-fashioned saloon.  Mimi Clark from the IRS 
  looks sad as she drowns the unfortunate aspect of her job 
  down with a little wine.  The SEXY BARMAID turns up the 
  volume on the TV.  We move in on the TV as his voice booms.

                                PRESIDENT
                ... democracy in the Middle East, 
                the former Soviet Satellite nations 
                  stabilized, and threats from Iran 
                and North Korea contained... the 
                state of our union is... strong.

  Just then, the TV turns to snow.  The patrons grumble.  

                              PATRONS
                      (ad-lib)
                Damn.  The cable s out!

  INT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS3030

  Woody and the kids cheer!

                              WOODY
                Yay!  The cable s out!

  INT. STEPHANIE LANCASTER'S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER3131

  Stephanie Lancaster turns off the snowy television and goes 
  right back to fighting with her mother on the phone.

                                STEPHANIE
                I didn t do anything to the TV, 
                mom.  Well, if you had brought me 
                to New York, then maybe--  What?  
                Oh, I wish you d just die.

  Silence.  Stephanie is furious.

                                STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                Mom.  Did you hang up on me?!

  INT. PETERSON FARM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER3232

  As Stanley shakes his head at the satellite TV, Bonnie looks 
  at the cell phone on the table flash green.  A picture 
  message.  Bonnie hits a button and the image begins to load.

  INT. BAILEY'S TAVERN - EVENING3333

  Mimi Clark, IRS employee, checks the ATM machine.  The sign 
  reads...  Technical difficulties.  Please, try again later.                                                                                 18.



  INT. SCHOOL BUS - MOMENTS LATER3434

  The pretty school teacher, HEATHER LISINSKI, 26, rides in the 
  front seat of the school bus.  She talks on her cell phone.

                              HEATHER
                We finally found a garage that 
                could fix it.  Had to take a 
                detour.  We re heading back now.

  Heather strains to see the road signs through the windows.

                              HEATHER (CONT D)
                We re on... Cedar Run Road.  We ll 
                be back in an hour, Mr. Mcvey.  Mr. 
                Mcvey?  Hello?

  Heather shrugs, folds her phone, and turns to the chubby bus 
  driver, who smiles.

                              BUS DRIVER
                      (thick Southern drawl)
                You wanna use my Blackberry?

  EXT. JIMMY'S HOUSE - LATER3535

  Good old hide and seek outside of this isolated house on the 
  west side of town.  Woody, his hands over his eyes, counts it 
  down.  His breath is foggy from the cold.

                              WOODY
                3-2-1... ready or not, here I come!

  Woody looks around.  No one under the porch.  No one in the 
  tool shed.  He finally creeps around to the bushes on the 
  West Side of the house.  And...

                              WOODY (CONT D)
                Gotcha!

  Woody grabs his little sister, SALLY, who giggles until she 
  sees Woody has a horrified expression on his face.  She turns 
  around, and the image moves with her.  It s then that we see 
  it.  In the distance, what used to be Denver is now...

    A mushroom cloud.


                                END OF ACT ONE                                                                                19.


                                    ACT TWO

  INT. JAKE S MUSTANG - DUSK3636

  The mushroom cloud bellows in the distance of this isolated 
  highway.  Jake holds his hands in front of his face to shield 
  his eyes from the blinding light coming from the rear view 
  mirror.  We stay inside this white light for a beat.  

  The light subsides.  Jake blinks to find his visual bearing.  
  And once his eyes focus, he sees it.  A station wagon going 
  the other direction has just veered into his lane.  Jake s 
  eyes go wide and just before the moment of impact...

  INT. STEPHANIE LANCASTER'S MANSION - DUSK3737

  CRASH!  Stephanie Lancaster has just dropped a plate of food 
  on the living room floor.  She moves to the massive bay 
  windows of her family s mansion on the hill.  The mushroom 
  cloud bellows in the distance.  Stephanie is speechless.

  EXT. PETERSON FARM - DUSK3838

  They are speechless.  Stanley, Bonnie, and the rest of the 
  Peterson family rush out of the house to get a better view of 
  the horizon.  Bonnie drops her open cell phone to the ground.

  EXT. RURAL ROAD - DUSK3939

  CRASH!  Jake holds his left arm up to brace his impact, but 
  it s too powerful.  His head hits the steering wheel.  The 
  car buckles, then careens into a ditch.  Jake passes out on 
  the steering wheel.  His head makes the horn Beeeeeeeeeeee.  
  We move away from him into the freezing night on this 
  isolated road.  His car looks small.

  INT. GREEN FAMILY HOUSE - BATHROOM - EARLY EVENING4040

  The faucet runs.  Unaware of events, Mayor Green opens up his 
  bottle of prescription pills.  He coughs twice, then downs 
  the pills with a little water.  He sighs.  Thinking about 
  Jake.  When he turns off the faucet, he hears something... 
  the sound of crying.

  INT. GREEN FAMILY HOUSE - EARLY EVENING4141

  The Mayor walks down the stairs to find Gail kneeling with 
  Jimmy and Bill standing in front of her.  Both look sad.  
  Gail rises to reveal Jimmy s son WOODY, horrified.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Gail?  What s going on?

  Gail turns around.  Her own expression... horrified.                                                                                20.



  EXT. GREEN FAMILY HOUSE - EARLY EVENING4242

  Peter parks his Oldsmobile with a skid.  Doors open.

  INT. GREEN FAMILY HOUSE - SECONDS LATER4343

  Peter and Ann, carrying their baby, rush into the house, now 
  buzzing with activity.  The Mayor holds up his hand for 
  silence as he moves to the other side of the room.

                              PETER
                Dad!  Dad!

                              MAYOR GREEN
                We heard, Peter.  Everyone, please.  
                The explosion came from the West.  
                There are military bases in 
                  Colorado.  It could have been a 
                test.  An accident.  Let s not get 
                ahead of ourselves.  I ll call the 
                  governor.  Find out.  In the mean- 
                time, let s not forget who we are.

  The Mayor s confidence settles the group down.  They watch as 
  he turns his back to them as he picks up the phone.  We see 
  the Mayor s face.  The line is dead.  He is now spooked.  But 
  he can t show it to the others.  He takes a breath.  Turns.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT D)
                Anyone s cell phone working?

  They all shakes their heads.  No.  Scared.

                              PETER
                Are we under attack, dad?

  Silence.  The Mayor thinks.  Looks at their frightened faces.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                I don t know.  Jimmy, Bill?  Get on 
                the radio.  I want everyone at the 
                  Sheriff s office in 20 minutes.  
                Tell them to assess any damage 
                along the way.  I need to know if 
                our town is still standing.  Peter, 
                we need to get the city s emergency 
                plan.  Let s move.

  They begin to scurry.  Woody trails after Jimmy.  

                              WOODY
                Dad, don t leave!  Dad, I want to 
                go with you!                                                                                21.



  Jimmy kneels.  Wipes the tears out of his son s eyes.  
  They ve said these words 1,000 times.  No sentiment.  

                              JIMMY
                Who s my hero?

                              WOODY
                Me.

                              JIMMY
                Who s the best?

                              WOODY
                Me.

                              JIMMY
                Who s going to take care of these 
                nice ladies?

                              WOODY
                Me.

  Woody hugs his dad.  Peter kisses Ann and the baby and 
  leaves.  Ann watches him go.  Gail and the Mayor lock eyes 
  with a look that only comes with 35 years of marriage.

                              GAIL
                Jake.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                We ll find him.

  EXT. JERICHO STREET - EVENING4444

  A police car flies down the street, followed by a Fire Truck.  
  But Stephanie Lancaster doesn t notice them.  Stephanie 
  Lancaster is in another world.

  EXT. TRAILER PARK - DUSK4545

  Dale Turner sees the police car racing down the street.  He 
  moves to his trailer past a few frightened and crying folks.

                              TRAILER PARK FOLKS
                 Oh, my God    Are we under 
                attack?    Oh, those poor people. 

  INT. DALE S TRAILER - DUSK4646

  Dale opens the trailer door.  He sees old beer cans, pizza 
  boxes, and an answering machine flashing ONE MESSAGE.                                                                                22.



  INT. BAILEY S TAVERN - NIGHT4747

  The juke box blasts as the people in the tavern enjoy their 
  last blissful moment of ignorance.  Mimi Clark, IRS employee, 
  leaves the ATM machine and approaches the SEXY BARMAID.

                              MIMI CLARK
                Excuse me, miss.  I m going back to 
                DC tomorrow, and I need money for 
                the cab.  Where can I find an ATM?

  INT. SHERIFF S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER4848

  Mayor Green and Peter burst through the door where the EMT, 
  Fire, and Police Crews have gathered.  The Mayor points to 
  the flashing lights on the cars through the window.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Could we turn off the Christmas 
                Tree out there before the whole 
                world starts asking questions?

  The SHERIFF, 57, all business, nods to one of his younger 
  deputies.  The deputy charges outside.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT D)
                Sheriff.  Chief.

  The FIRE CHIEF, 48, a real cowboy, nods to the Mayor.  The 
  Mayor lays his emergency plan on the sheriff s desk.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT D)
                Any damage?  Fires?  Buildings?

                              SHERIFF
                Nothing, Mr. Mayor.  Town s fine.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Let s hope you re right.

                              SHERIFF
                What do you mean?

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Do we have any Geiger counters?

  EXT. BAILEY S TAVERN - MOMENTS LATER4949

  As Mimi Clark exits the tavern, she sees it.  Something s 
  strange.  People are gathering outside.  Some are crying.  

                              MIMI CLARK
                Excuse me, sir.  What s going on?                                                                                23.

                But... what... did they get D.C.?

  INT. ALVIE CLEMONS' BEDROOM - EVENING5050

  Alvie is too focused on his SAT book and blasting stereo to 
  hear the knock.  His mother, TERESA CLEMONS, 45, shouts up.

                                TERESA CLEMONS (O.S.)
                Alvie, your friend Stephanie s here!

  Alvie bounds up, checks his hopeless hair, and leaves.

  INT. ALVIE CLEMONS  HOUSE - EVENING5151

  Alvie walks down the stairs to find Stephanie Lancaster, who 
  is in a complete daze.

                                STEPHANIE
                I can t get my mom on the phone.

  EXT. TAVERN - NIGHT5252

  We see a cell phone that reads... Call Was Lost.  We move up 
  to the shattered face of Mimi Clark.  

                              MIMI CLARK
                Mom, please pick up the phone.

  She tries again.  No service.  Panicked, she begins to run, 
  past a poster of the smiling face of GRAY ANDERSON.

  EXT. SHERIFF S OFFICE - EVENING5353

  GRAY ANDERSON, 44, is slick, savvy, and politically astute.  
  He passes a lady cop, speaking into her radio.

                              LADY COP
                Bill?  What s the ETA on those 
                Geiger counters?

  INT. SHERIFF S OFFICE - EVENING5454

  Gray Anderson enters the room as the impact of the news 
  spreads across the group s faces.  The leaders are holding 
  their composure.  The younger cops and firemen are shaky.  
  Some cry.  Most are silent.  Men.  Women.  Black.  White.  
  It s the one human moment before...                                                                                24.



                              MAYOR GREEN
                I know.  We re all scared.  We re 
                all thinking of our families.  But 
                in about 2 minutes, people are 
                going to pour through those doors, 
                looking for answers.  So, we better 
                get some quick.  If we re calm, 
                they re calm.  Understood?  

  They all nod.  The sheriff gestures to the emergency plan.

                              SHERIFF
                What does the emergency plan say?

                              PETER GREEN
                Contact the governor.  National 
                Guard.  State troopers.

  They all look at the RADIO OPERATOR in the corner.  Static.  
  He turns to them.  Shakes his head.  Nothing.

                              SHERIFF
                Anything else?

                              MAYOR GREEN
                A whole lot about tornadoes.

  The group sighs.  One young cop panics.

                              PANICKED COP
                Are we under attack?  We re under--

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Son.  Until we hear otherwise, I 
                don t want to hear that word again.  
                One explosion is not an attack.

  Gray Anderson makes his way into the center near the Mayor, 
  Peter, the Sheriff, and Fire Chief.  The Mayor and Peter 
  politely nod to him although we can feel the chill.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT'D)
                I m glad you re here, Gray.  We 
                could use the help.

                              GRAY ANDERSON
                Thank you, Mr. Mayor.  Peter.  
                Anything I can do.

                              BILL
                Mayor Green!  Sheriff!

  They turn to see Bill set down a box of Geiger counters.                                                                                25.



  INT. STANLEY PETERSON S PICK-UP TRUCK - EVENING5555

  The pick-up truck flies down the road.  Bonnie is shell-
  shocked.  Stanley puts a hand on her shoulder.

                              STANLEY
                Hang in there, Bonnie.  We need to 
                make sure the Mayor knows.

  INT. SHERIFF S OFFICE - EVENING5656

  The Mayor holds the Geiger counter.  He looks at the 
  assembled group.  Silence.  Prayers.  The Mayor switches the 
  power on.  Pins and needles as they wait.  Nothing.  Until 
  the Mayor lowers the Geiger counter and it starts CLIK-CLIK-
  CLIK ing.  People gasp.  Cry.  Terrified until...

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Wait a minute.

  The Mayor lifts the Geiger counter up.  The CLIK-CLIK goes 
  away.  Puts it back down.  CLIK-CLIK.  The Sheriff gives the 
  Mayor a quizzical look until...

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT D)
                I didn t turn off my cell phone.

  The group sighs in relief.  Almost laughing.  A YOUNG COUPLE 
  enters the Sheriff s office.  Shaken.

                              YOUNG HUSBAND
                Mr. Mayor?

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Folks, no need to panic.  So far, 
                it looks like there s no radiation 
                fallout.  We ll keep checking 
                around town, but in the meantim--

                              YOUNG WIFE
                  Actually, sir.  We... uh... we 
                spoke to Principal McVey.  The 
                school bus isn t back from the 
                field trip... with our son.

  INT. ALVIE CLEMONS  HOUSE - NIGHT5757

  Alvie is speechless.  His mother now has tears running down 
  her face.  We might think she s reacting to the news, but...

                                TERESA CLEMONS
                Alvie, call Principal McVey to find 
                out where your little sister is.                                                                                26.



  INT. GREEN FAMILY HOUSE - EVENING5858

  Gail is now surrounded by a group of concerned parents.  Some 
  are worried.  Some are crying.  Some are irate.

                                CONCERNED PARENTS
                 It should have been back an hour 
                ago.    Where is your husband!? 

                              GAIL
                  Everyone, please calm down.  I m 
                sure my husband and the sheriff are 
                doing everything they can to find 
                the school bus.

                              IRATE MOTHER
                That s easy for you to say.  You 
                don t have a child out there!

  This hits Gail.  Ann puts her hand on Gail s shoulder.  Gail 
  kills herself not to cry.  One tough lady.

  EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT5959

  Beeeeee.  In the freezing January night, we see Jake's 
  Mustang, crumpled in the ditch.  After a beat, Jake opens his 
  eyes.  He blinks a couple of times and slowly moves his head 
  off the steering wheel.  The beeeeeeeee is replaced by the 
  sound of silence.  He touches his forehead.  Blood.  He looks 
  at his leg.  More blood.  He moves his pants back.  

  A surface cut runs down his leg.

  Jake tries to start the car, but the engine block seems 
  cracked.  Vrrrr.  Vrrr.  Nothing.  Jake reaches over with his 
  left hand to open the car door.  The second he pushes on the 
  door, he screams out in pain.  His left arm is severely 
  sprained.  Jake opens the door with his right arm.  Then, he 
  limps toward the station wagon he collided with.  

  He peers into the wagon and sees... AN OLD COUPLE.  Not 
  moving.  Jake grimaces.  He opens the door.  Feels the lady s 
  pulse through her neck.  Dead.  He reaches over and feels the 
  old man s pulse through his wrist.  Same.  He stands, and in 
  a reflex from childhood, he crosses himself.  Then, the 
  shivers take over his body.  It s freezing. 

  EXT. RURAL ROAD - SECONDS LATER6060

  Jake opens the station wagon s back.  Looks for anything that 
  can help him.  Mixed in with all the junk, souvenirs, and 
  luggage, he sees a golf bag, a belt, and an overcoat.  He 
  wraps the belt around his leg to try and stop the bleeding.                                                                                  27.


  Then, he grabs a golf club.  Finally, he grabs the overcoat.  
  When he picks it up, something goes clunk on his hand.  He 
  reaches into the coat and pulls out... a flask.

  EXT. RURAL ROAD - SECONDS LATER6161

  Jake, using the 5 wood as a makeshift crutch, begins to walk 
  down the road toward a hill.  A small body in a massive sea 
  of black.  He s in the middle of nowhere.  

  INT. SHERIFF S OFFICE - NIGHT6262

  We see the Mayor in silence for a breath.  His face registers 
  a flash of resigned sadness and worry about Jake.  He looks 
  over at the crowded room.  Townspeople asking questions, 
  panicked, some just wanting to help.  Then, the volume comes 
  back up, and it's right back to business.  The Mayor points 
  to the map of the surrounding counties.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Okay.  The school bus was here at 
                the caves.  Who can tell me where 
                they might have gone for repairs?

                              FIRE CHIEF
                There s Wilson s garage off 183.

                              EMT CREW CHIEF
                Or maybe Cedar Run Road.  They said 
                they took a detour before the phone 
                cut off.  What do you think, Sheriff?

  The crowd is getting louder.   What about fallout?    Are we 
  under attack?    Can we help?   Peter steps up and shouts.

                              PETER GREEN
                FOLKS!  WE CAN T HEAR OURSELVES 
                THINK OVER HERE!

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Peter, enough.

                              SHERIFF
                I figure two teams.  There are only 
                so many places it could be.

  The Mayor nods.  Good work, sheriff.  And then, Gray Anderson 
  throws in his two cents.  Just loud enough for the crowd.

                              GRAY ANDERSON
                What about the parents?

  Parts of the crowd react.   Yeah.    We want to help.   Mayor 
  Green looks at the Sheriff.  Sotto voice.                                                                                28.



                              SHERIFF
                It s your call, but we don t know 
                what s out there.  Could be 
                fallout.  Could be the Chinese army 
                for all we know.  

  The Mayor thinks.  Makes the tough call.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Folks, I m sorry, but I want the 
                police out there finding your kids.  
                Not you.
                      (off their outrage)
                You re safe here.  And God forbid 
                you go out there, get stranded, and 
                your child comes back an orphan.  
                We ll get your kids.  I promise.

  The parents are furious.  Peter stares daggers at Gray 
  Anderson.  The Mayor pulls the sheriff aside.  Whispers.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT D)
                I know the school bus has to come 
                first, but Jake...

                              SHERIFF
                We ll get your son, Mr. Mayor.

  The sheriff pats his shoulder and moves.  Gray approaches.

                              GRAY ANDERSON
                What can I do, sir?

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Peter and I will find a way to call  
                the governor.  I need you to 
                  coordinate with the fire department 
                to make sure no citizens leave 
                town.  It could be a death trap out 
                there.  No one s dying on my watch.

                              GRAY ANDERSON
                Anything I can do, Mr. Mayor.

  Gray leaves.  The Mayor watches him.  The look on his face 
  gives new meaning to the word mistrust.

  INT. EMILY SPENSER'S HOUSE - NIGHT6363

  In stark contrast to the chaos we ve seen, Emily Spenser is 
  still in her own world.  Her iPod is still playing romantic 
  music.  She's still smiling at the champagne, the candles, 
  the "Welcome Home, Roger" sign.  And suddenly...                                                                                29.



                              EMILY
                Oh, God!

  We might think she just reacted to the tragedy.  But no.  The 
  clock on the wall reads: 9:30pm.  She takes off her iPod, 
  rushes over to the table, and grabs her keys, revealing...

  The Post-It note.  Roger s flight.  Kansas City Airport.  
  11:00pm.  In a dash, Emily is out the door.

  INT. EMILY S VW JETTA - NIGHT6464

  Emily turns the key.  The radio plays static.  But she has a 
  CD in there before it even registers to her that something is 
  wrong.  The romantic music continues.  

  EXT. THE PINES - NIGHT6565

  Emily drives through the Pines - Jericho s community on the 
  East Side of Town.  Quite ritzy.  Quite isolated.  Behind 
  trees.  In the dark of night.

  She turns right and takes the East Road out of town.  Her 
  Jetta gets smaller and smaller in the distance until it 
  disappears.  And then, finally, the Fire Truck arrives to 
  block the East road out of town.

  EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT6666

  Jake turns around.  Did he hear something?  He looks at the 
  woods.  The breeze rustles the leaves.  He turns around and 
  keeps walking.  Three steps.  He stops.  He hears feet 
  running at him.  His imagination gets the better of him.  The 
  feet are getting closer.  Jake holds up the 5 wood, ready to 
  defend himself.   And just when he - and we - were sure he 
  was going to be attacked... two little kids run up to him.  
  One boy.  One girl.  Terrified.

                              GIRL
                Mister, please.  

                              JAKE
                What is it, kids?  What s wrong?

                              BOY
                I think they re dying.


                                END OF ACT TWO                                                                                30.


                                  ACT THREE

  EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT6767

  The kids drag a limping Jake onto an isolated rural road.

                              GIRL
                Please, mister.  Hurry.

  EXT. SHERIFF S OFFICE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT6868

  The police gear up to go on the search and rescue mission.  
  Guns.  Ammunition.  Extra batteries.  The Sheriff looks at a 
  jittery YOUNG COP, who s obviously terrified.

                              SHERIFF
                Don t worry, son.  There s nothing 
                out there we can t handle.

  ROD HAWKINS, the new man in town, passes some townspeople, 
  asking questions.   Folks, it could have been an accident.  A 
  test.  Please.   Rod approaches one of the younger cops, an 
  African American guy, about 25.

                              ROD HAWKINS
                Excuse me, son?  Who s in charge?

  The cop points at the Sheriff, who is busy barking orders.  

                              SHERIFF
                ... Jimmy, get on the bullhorn and 
                calm the folks down.

  Jimmy clicks on the bullhorn.  As he tries to quiet the 
  crowd... Rod approaches the sheriff.

                              ROD HAWKINS
                You the sheriff?  Rod Hawkins.

                              SHERIFF
                Good to meet you, Mr. Hawkins, but 
                I m afraid we got our hands full 
                right now... Damn fools!

  Just then, the Sheriff sees 2 pick-up trucks enter the 
  parking lot.  Inside the trucks are the FATHERS of the 
  missing school kids with rifles.

                              SHERIFF (CONT D)
                Gray, will you tell the weekend 
                warriors the drill, please?

  Gray Anderson nods and approaches the trucks.                                                                                31.



                              ROD HAWKINS
                Could you use an extra man?

                              SHERIFF
                No civilians.  Mayor s orders.

                              ROD HAWKINS
                I used to be a cop.  St. Louis.

                              SHERIFF
                You know those roads out there?

                              ROD HAWKINS
                No.  Just moved to town.

                              SHERIFF
                Then, I m afraid you d only slow us 
                down.  Sorry.

  The Sheriff pats his shoulder, then turns.  The only thing 
  Rod hates more than machismo is a mistake.

                              ROD HAWKINS
                Sheriff.  You might want to get 
                some black spray paint.

  The Sheriff is confused.  Rod points at the big Jericho 
  emblem on the sides of the police car.

                              ROD HAWKINS (CONT D)
                To cover that.  Look, I know you re 
                telling people it was an accident.  
                And I hope it was.  But if it was 
                an attack, and there is chaos out 
                there... you might not want the 
                wrong people to know that Jericho 
                is still here.

  Rod starts to leave.

                              SHERIFF
                Mr. Hawkins... The fire department 
                could use an extra man.  Next time, 
                you re with us.

  Rod nods at the sheriff.  Respect.  As Rod leaves, Stephanie, 
  Alvie, and his mother, Teresa Clemons, approach.

                              SHERIFF (CONT'D)
                Mrs. Clemons.  I already told you.

                                TERESA CLEMONS
                But my daughter, Stacy--                                                                                32.



                              SHERIFF
                You want to help your daughter?  Go 
                rustle up some black spray paint.  

  She nods, eager to contribute in any way she can.  They start 
  running the other way, passing... Gray Anderson as he talks 
  to the FATHERS in the pick-ups.

                              IRATE FATHER
                But my son is out there!

                              GRAY ANDERSON
                If it were up to me, I d let you.  
                But those are the Mayor s orders.

  INT. SHERIFF S OFFICE - NIGHT6969

  Mayor Green and Peter sit with the radio operator, trying 
  channel after channel.  Static.  Static.

                              RADIO OPERATOR
                We have our frequencies, sir.  But 
                outside.  It s like no one s there.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Is the problem digital?

                              RADIO OPERATOR
                Maybe.  We could switch to CB but 
                it only has a radius of 15 miles.  
                That doesn t get us to the highway.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                What about analog?  A ham radio?

                              RADIO OPERATOR
                That s better, but we sold those 
                off when we switched to digital.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                I know where we can get one.  Come 
                on, Peter.

                              PETER
                Dad, stay.  We ll send somebody.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                No.  He won t talk to anybody else.
                      (to radio operator)
                Try the CB.  We ll be back.                                                                                33.



  INT. GRACIE LEIGH S SUPERMARKET - NIGHT7070

  GRACIE LEIGH, her gossip long forgotten, throws black spray 
  paint in a bag.  Alvie s mother digs in her purse for money.

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                Mrs. Clemons, put your money away.  
                We re in this together, right?

  She nods.  Grateful.  Gracie turns to Stephanie, staring 
  absently at the cosmetics section.  Thinking of her mother.

                                GRACIE LEIGH (CONT D)
                  Stephanie, remember what the Mayor 
                said.  One explosion isn t an 
                attack.  Right now, your mom could 
                be calling you, worried.

  Stephanie nods.  Somewhat comforted.

  INT. DALE TURNER S TRAILER - NIGHT7171

  The ramshackle trailer is cold and messy.  One photograph of 
  Dale Turner and his mother at a little league game.  Even in 
  the picture, his mother is holding a beer.  Dale Turner sits 
    motionless in front of the answering machine.  We hear his 
  mother s voice on tape...

                                DALE S MOTHER (V.O.)
                      (drunk)
                ... sorry I didn t call sooner, 
                Dale, but we decided to stay a 
                couple extra days in Boulder.

                                BOYFRIEND (V.O.)
                      (drunker)
                Put down the phone and come to bed.

                                DALE S MOTHER (V.O.)
                      (laughs)
                Stop that.  It s my kid.  Honey? 
                Honey, what are you starin  at...

  A low rumble.  Glass shattering.  And then... silence.  Dale 
  hits rewind.  Then, he presses play.  From the look on his 
  face, we get the feeling he s been doing this for an hour.

                                DALE S MOTHER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                      (drunk)
                ... sorry I didn t call sooner, 
                Dale, but we decided to stay--

    Mercifully for Dale, the power blows.                                                                                34.



  EXT. JERICHO - SKY ANGLE - NIGHT7272

  We see the power grid begin to cut off across town from 
  above, and then we move to specific locations...

  EXT. JERICHO - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT7373

  Quick shots like a ricochet...

  - The street lights turn off like a kick line.  

  - The radio operator s static turns to... silence.

  - The FIRE CHIEF shouting into a bullhorn  Folks, there is no 
  fallout.  We think it was an acci--   The streetlights turn 
  dark.  People scream.   We re under attack. 

  - The Shell gas station.  Packed with cars.  Some townspeople 
  get what gas they can in the panic.  The numbers click off.  
  Gallons.  Dollars.  Cents.  And then... complete darkness.  
  The pumps stop.  No more gas.

  - Mimi Clark in her hotel room.  Trying the landline phone 
  for the 100th time.  Losing it.  Darkness.

  - Road Out of Jericho.  Jimmy and Bill spray paint the sides 
  of the cars.  Darkness.  The EMT Crew Chief turns to the 
  Sheriff.   Don t worry.  We ll handle the town.  Move. 

  - The Mayor and Peter in the Oldsmobile as the traffic lights 
  go black.   Hurry, Peter. 

  - Stanley in his pick-up truck with Bonnie driving into the 
  dark town.   I guess they already know. 

  - Gracie Leigh alone in her store.  Darkness.  The broom in 
  the corner now looks like an attacker.   Who is that? 

  And then...

  EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT7474

  Jake s eyes go wide.  Near a cluster of trees, he sees... the 
  Jericho elementary SCHOOL BUS.  A flat tire on the rear axle.  
  The hood smashed from the tree the bus hit.

  INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT7575

  Jake enters the bus and looks around.  We don t see it, but 
  his face tells us the whole picture...

                              JAKE
                Jesus.                                                                                35.



  EXT. ROAD OUT OF JERICHO - NIGHT7676

  Two police cars head out into the night.  Lights flashing.  
  Passing the tall water tower that reads:  Jericho.  The 
  police cars each split in a different direction.

  INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT7777

  The image darts around with Jake as he takes in the sights of 
  the bus.  The BUS DRIVER is passed out on the driver s seat 
  with a severe concussion.  Jake checks his pulse.  Alive.

                              WOMAN S VOICE (O.S.)
                What s happening?

  Jake turns to his left.  The pretty teacher, HEATHER 
  LISINSKI, 26, slammed into the metal partition when the bus 
  collided with the tree.  She s breathing shallow.  Bleeding 
  from the forehead.  But still conscious.  Frightened.

                              JAKE
                I don t know.  Are you okay?

                              HEATHER
                I can t move.

                              JAKE
                Can you feel your toes?

                              HEATHER
                Yes.  But I think... my insides.  
                Are we under attack?

                              JAKE
                It was one explosion.  That s not 
                an attack yet.

  Jake takes off his coat.  Puts it on her to keep her warm.

                              HEATHER
                Don t worry about me.  Worry about 
                them.

  Jake turns his attention to the school bus.  The children are 
    terrified.  Some cry.  With a never-ending chorus of... 

                                DIFFERENT KIDS
                 Mister, I want to go home.    I 
                want my mommy.   I m hungry.  
                 Please, Mister.    I m scared.   
                 They re coming to kill us. 

  And through the din, one little boy shouts at Jake.                                                                                36.



                                LITTLE BOY
                Mister, she s sick.  Mister, she 
                can t breathe.

  Jake finally focuses on the little boy.  

                              JAKE
                What?  

  The little boy gestures to a little BLONDE GIRL, shaking with 
  terror, her hands holding her neck.  Jake rushes over.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                What s wrong?  What s wrong with 
                her?

                                LITTLE BOY
                When the bus stopped, Stacy was 
                like this...

  The little boy puts his chin on the seat in front of him.  
  Jake moves his gaze to the frightened Blonde Girl.  In a 
  flash, Jake s mind puts the pieces together.  The little 
  Blonde Girl took the whole impact on her throat.

                              JAKE
                Are you okay?  Let me see.

  The little Blonde Girl removes her hands.  Her throat is 
  severely swollen.  Jake does his best to stay calm.

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                      (to Heather)
                Do you have an ice pack?  We have 
                to stop the swelling now.

  Heather weakly points to the first aid kit.  The little Blond 
  Girl starts panting.  Jake turns back to her.

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                It s okay, Stacy.  Calm down.

  A little boy brings the first aid kit over.  The little 
  Blonde Girl looks at it.  Panicked.  Breathing faster.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Just breathe normally.  You re 
                going to be okay.

  The girl nods.  Terrified.  Her breathing faster.                                                                                  37.



                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Oh, God.  Calm down.  You re making 
                it worse.  

  Jake fumbles for the emergency ice pack.  Punches it to break 
  the seal.  Shakes it up.  The girl s eyes start to flutter.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Stay with me.  Come on.

  The girl gives Jake a look of sheer horror, then she 
  collapses in his arms.  The children scream. 

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Wake up.  Wake up.

  He lays the girl on the floor and puts the ice pack on her 
  throat.  He frantically searches his pockets.  He rushes over 
  to the coat and pulls out the flask.  He puts the metal of it 
  near her nose.  No breath.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Dammit!

  EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT7878

  Alvie s mother, Alvie, and Stephanie surround the Fire Chief 
  along with a crowd, shouting questions.  Did they blow up the 
  power station?    We re under attack!   And then... ROD 
  HAWKINS approaches.

                              ROD HAWKINS
                Folks, I doubt anyone blew up the 
                power station.  It was probably a 
                drain on the system from Denver.

                              FIRE CHIEF
                Are you the science teacher?

  EXT. OLD SHACK HOUSE - NIGHT7979

  Knock.  Knock.  Peter stands with Mayor Green, who coughs.

                              PETER
                Dad, did you take your pills?

                              MAYOR GREEN
                I m fine.  Don t worry about me.

  Suddenly, the door flies open and a shotgun is leveled at the 
  Mayor s chest.  Chik-chik.  After a beat, OLD MAN OLIVER, 68, 
    a bonafide kook, puts down the gun.                                                                                38.



                              OLD MAN OLIVER
                Sorry, Mr. Mayor.  Thought you were 
                aliens.  We re under attack by 
                aliens, don t you know?

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Oliver, do you have your ham radio?

                              OLD MAN OLIVER
                Yeah, but I ain t got power to run 
                it.

                              PETER
                I know someone with a generator.

                              OLD MAN OLIVER
                Okay, then.  50 cents.

                              PETER
                OLIVER!

                              OLD MAN OLIVER
                I need my 50 cents.

  The Mayor pulls out a dollar.

                              OLD MAN OLIVER (CONT'D)
                Okay, let me get your change.

  EXT. SHERIFF S CAR - NIGHT8080

  The Sheriff drives through the darkness.  

                              SHERIFF
                Jimmy, what s your 20?

                              JIMMY (V.O.)
                Willow Creek, Sheriff.  Nothing.

                              SHERIFF
                We re almost to Cedar Run.

  The nervous YOUNG COP stares at the Geiger counter, waiting 
  for it to CLIK-CLIK.  You can almost hear his heartbeat.

  INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT8181

  The school kids are beside themselves with panic.  They re 
  shouting.  Crying.  Jake rummages through the first aid kit.  
    Band-aids.  Gauze.  Not what he needs.                                                                                  39.



                              JAKE
                Kids, calm down.  I need to focus.  
                Please.  I need quie-- DAMMIT!  
                WOULD YOU SHUT THE HELL UP!?

  His shouting only made it worse.  And then, out of nowhere...

                              HEATHER
                THE FIRST PERSON WHO STOPS TALKING 
                DOESN T HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL 
                  TOMORROW!

  Immediate silence.  Jake looks at Heather, who nods at him.  
   Go ahead.   As he rummages through the bus driver s pockets, 
  Jake turns to the kids.

                              JAKE
                Kids.  I need everyone right now to 
                help me.  Who has a pen?  Anyone 
                have a pen?

                                LITTLE BOY
                      (hopeful)
                We have pencils.

                              JAKE
                No.  A tube.  Something hollow.  A 
                straw.

                              GIRL (O.S.)
                I have a straw.

                              JAKE
                Who said that?

  A girl raises her hand.  Jake rushes over to her.  

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Let me see it.  Let me see it.  

  She hands him her... juice box.  Jake pulls out the straw.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                It s too thin.  Does anyone else 
                have a juice box?

  30 hands go up.  

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Get them out.  Now.  What s your 
                name?

  Jake points to the first little girl who raised her hand.                                                                                40.



                              JULIE
                Julie.

                              JAKE
                Give your straws to Julie.  Quick.

  Jake moves back to the first aid kit.  Grabs two band-aids.  
  The kids all hand the straws to Julie.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Kids, put the straws in a circle.

  The kids do it literally.

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                      (barks)
                No.  No.  No.  Not a circle circle.

  The kids don t understand.  Heather gestures with her hand...

                              HEATHER
                Like your moms when they measure 
                  spaghetti.  Or pick up sticks 
                before you drop them.

  The kids get it.  They start putting the juice box straws in 
  a tight bunch, making the equivalent of a wide straw.  Jake 
  hands 2 band aids to Julie.

                              JAKE
                Make it tight.

  Jake fumbles through his pockets as Heather guides the kids.

                              HEATHER
                      (calm)
                Nice and tight on the bottom.  Good 
                Julie.  Now, the top.  Nice, Roy.

  Jake pulls out his father s... SWISS ARMY KNIFE.  He opens 
  the knife and flask.  Then, he douses the blade with alcohol.

  INT. SHERIFF S CAR - NIGHT8282

  The Young Cop keeps looking at the Geiger counter.  Paranoid.

                              JIMMY (V.O.)
                Sheriff.  Anything?  Over.

                              SHERIFF
                No.  We don t-- wait.  I see 
                  something.  This could be it.                                                                                41.



  INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT8383

  Jake bends over the Blonde girl.  The kids lean, staring.

                              HEATHER
                Give him some room, kids.  

  The kids back away.  Jake grips the knife in his right hand.  
  He looks at the soft skin in the divit below her neck.  He 
  puts his sprained left arm on the girl s chest.  Winces.

                              JAKE
                Who s the strongest kid?

  17 hands go up.  8 boys.  7 girls.   Me.    Me.    Me. 

                              HEATHER
                Danny.  You.

  Danny, wide-eyed, approaches.

                              JAKE
                Danny.  I hurt my left arm.  I need 
                you to hold down her shoulders in 
                case she wakes up.  And don t look.

  Danny is frightened, but does as he s told.  Jake bends over, 
  his left arm now on her forehead.  He brings the blade to her 
  neck.  Danny shuts his eyes.  We don t see it.  But Jake 
  starts making the incision.  Danny slowly peaks open his left 
  eye.  Curiosity killed the cat.  We see Danny s reaction to 
  the blood.  And Jake s focus.  

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                Grab the gauze.  Stay with me, son.

  INT. JIMMY S POLICE CAR - NIGHT8484

  Jimmy drives.  Bill s in the passenger seat.

                              SHERIFF (V.O.)
                Jimmy.  We see the bus.

                              JIMMY
                Thank God.  What s your 20?

                              SHERIFF (V.O.)
                About 6 miles west of 183.

                              JIMMY
                You want us?                                                                                42.



                              SHERIFF (V.O.)
                Keep looking for Jake.

                              JIMMY
                10-4.

  Jimmy holsters the radio.  After all the intense focus of the 
  last few hours, the relief breaks him.  He starts crying.

                              BILL
                Better not let the sheriff catch 
                you do that.

  Jimmy smiles.  Bill pats his back.

  INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT8585

  Jake finishes the incision and lifts up his arm.  He wipes 
  his forearm on his forehead.  Blood.  He nods to Danny, who 
  gives him the gauze.  Jake mops up the small pool of blood on 
  the girl s neck.

                              JAKE
                Julie.  Where are my straws?

  Julie hands him the juice box straws all wrapped tight.  He 
  brings the contraption to the incision.  Danny watches as 
  Jake inserts the juice box straws into the incision.  His 
  mouth hangs open.   Wow.   Jake bends down, revealing the CPR 
  sign behind him.  He moves his mouth to the straws.  He 
  blows.  The girl s chest doesn t move.  

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Come on, Stacy.

  INT. SHERIFF S CAR - CONTINUOUS8686

  Through the windshield, we see a bus.  The men in the 
  sheriff s car are ecstatic.

                              SHERIFF
                Let s not start cheering.  Stay 
                focused.  They may need help.

  The car stops.  The Sheriff and his men move toward the bus.

  INT. SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS8787

  Danny hands Jake 2 band-aids.  Jake quickly tapes them around 
  the juice box straws to make the seal around the air hole 
  tighter.  He moves to it again.  Blows into the tube.  The 
  girl s chest moves up and down.  Jake blows again.                                                                                43.



                              JAKE
                Come on, kid.

  He blows again.  Again.  Finally, the little girl takes a 
  breath on her own.  The kids are awestruck.  Jake exhales.  
  He looks at the blood on his shaking hands.

                              HEATHER
                How did you know how to do that?

  Jake turns to the pretty teacher.

                              JAKE
                Military school.  My father sent 
                me.

                              HEATHER
                Were you a soldier?

                              JAKE
                No.  A screw up.

  EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT8888

  The flashlight rises, lighting the Sheriff s face.  He looks 
  shocked.  A reverse angle reveals that he s not looking at 
  Jake, Heather, the kids, or the School Bus Driver, but a...

  PRISON GUARD

  Shot through the forehead.  He moves the light to the bus.  A 
  State Trooper is dead.  The rest of the bus is empty.

  The Sheriff s men shine their flashlights on the outside of 
  the bus.  We see the words...  

  KANSAS STATE MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON


                              END OF ACT THREE                                                                                44.

  EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT8989

  Rod Hawkins climbs quickly up the telephone pole.  He looks 
  out over the town.  People roam the streets.  Frightened.

                              ROD HAWKINS
                Chief!  You need to get some lights 
                on.  Folks are starting to lose it.

  EXT. GREEN FAMILY HOUSE - NIGHT9090

  Stanley Peterson s pick-up truck comes to a skid.  He opens 
  the door and rushes to the house.  Bonnie follows.

  EXT. SHELL GAS STATION - NIGHT9191

  The station is still crowded as the crowds of cars try to 
  untangle themselves in the darkness.  Cars honk.

  INT. GREEN FAMILY HOUSE - NIGHT9292

  Gail and Ann open the door to reveal... Stanley and Bonnie 
  Peterson.  Stanley is sad.  Bonnie is shell-shocked.

                              STANLEY
                Mrs. Green, we uh... we saw 
                  something.  It s horrible.  You 
                should get Jake and your husband.

  EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT9393

  Stephanie Lancaster starts crying.  Alvie holds her.

                                STEPHANIE
                I told my mom I wish she d die.

  EXT. JERICHO STREET - NIGHT9494

  People rush down the streets.  In the middle of this storm of 
  activity, we see a lone figure, walking.  The trailer park 
  kid, Dale Turner.  With a blank expression on his face.

  INT. GRACIE LEIGH S SUPERMARKET - NIGHT9595

  Gracie walks through the darkness.  Every corner has 
  something that looks like an attacker.  A broom.  A globe.  
  Finally, a KNOCK makes her scream.  She shines the flashlight 
  through the glass door.  Standing there is Dale Turner.                                                                                45.



  INT. GREEN FAMILY HOUSE - NIGHT9696

  The cell phone casts a glow on Stanley Peterson, Bonnie, Ann, 
  and finally Gail, who holds the cell phone to her face and 
  looks at the picture on it.

                              GAIL
                Oh, dear God.

  EXT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT9797

  The freezing night.  Quickly.  We move from the jack, 
  hoisting up the bus, to the rear of the bus where Jake grabs 
  the spare tire.  He throws the spare on the ground.  Thud.  
  He connects the lug wrench with the first lug nut on the flat 
  tire.  He kneels down, his leg throbbing.  Grimaces.  Fights 
  through it.  He leans in and pushes with all the strength in 
  his right arm against the lug wrench.  Nothing.

  He tries again, GROANING this time.  Nothing.  He s gotta use 
  his legs.  He stands, steadies the lug wrench, brings his bad 
  leg up.  And just as he brings it down as hard as he can...

  INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT9898

  Heather and the children watch Jake as his foot slips off the 
  tire iron and his bad leg buckles.  Shrieking with pain.

                              JAKE (O.S.)
                WHERE S THE GOD DAMN RESCUE PARTY!?

  INT. JIMMY S POLICE CAR - NIGHT9999

  Jimmy and Bill look at the highway.

                              BILL
                It s like a ghost town.

                              JIMMY
                Bill, let s face it.  He didn t 
                come this way.

  INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT100100

  Jake rushes into the bus.  

                              JAKE
                Kids.  I need you.  Now, dammit.

                              JULIE
                Mister, you swear a lot.                                                                                46.



  Jake and Heather exchange a brief smile and then... he looks 
  her over.  She is getting more and more pale.

                              JAKE
                How you holding up?

                              HEATHER
                      (not fine)
                Fine.  How about your leg?

  Jake s eyes say it all.  He s losing blood fast.

                              HEATHER (CONT D)
                Hurry.

  INT. GREEN FAMILY HOUSE - NIGHT101101

  Silence like a heartbeat.  Gail s eyes scan Bonnie s cell 
  phone again.  We see her boyfriend s smiling face.  Then, the 
  image pans to reveal... the fire ball 5 miles behind him.  

  Gail turns to Stanley, sad, and Bonnie, who is on Mars with 
  shock.  Gail struggles to keep her own composure.

                              GAIL
                Where was this?

                              STANLEY
                Atlanta, Mrs. Green.

                              GAIL
                We ll notify the Mayor.  Thank you, 
                Stanley.  Bonnie.  God bless you.

                              STANLEY PETERSON
                Ma am... I m sure Jake will be 
                okay.

  Gail nods.  Thank you.  Stanley nods back.  Truth is, neither 
  of them are sure.  Especially when...

                                BONNIE PETERSON
                No, he s not.  He s not okay.  
                Nobody is okay.

                              STANLEY PETERSON
                Bonnie--

                                BONNIE PETERSON
                Jake s dead.  Don t you get that?  
                Why don t you get that?  He s dead.                                                                                47.



  EXT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT102102

  The kids are in a line on the side of the bus.  Jake bends 
  down on his knee.  Pain.  He puts the lug wrench onto the 
  flat tire s lug nut.  Holds it in place.

                              JAKE
                Go.

  The first kid in the line runs at the tire iron and jumps.  
  He lands on it.  Doesn t budge.  

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Out of the way.  Next!

  The second kid runs at the tire iron.  Jumps.  Nothing.  Jake 
  bows his head.  His body shivers in the freezing cold.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                Please, help us God.

  EXT. SHELL GAS STATION - NIGHT103103

  Cars honk in the darkness.  With no power, the pumps will not 
  work.  NORMAN PERRY, whose labor dispute with Shep Cale feels 
  like an ancient memory, kneels by his SUV, screwing the cap 
  on his extra 2 gallon gas can.  A BURLY MAN approaches.

                              BURLY MAN
                Hey.  You get extra there?

                                NORMAN
                Sorry.

                              BURLY MAN
                What do you mean sorry?

                                NORMAN
                First come.  First serve.

                              BURLY MAN
                You already filled your car.  What?  
                You gonna mow your lawn?

                                NORMAN
                Sorry.  My family--

                              BURLY MAN
                We all have families.  Come on.

  The Burly Man reaches for the can.  Tug of war.                                                                                48.



  INT. SHELL GAS STATION - CONVENIENCE MART - NIGHT104104

  An ANGRY CROWD stares down the convenience store CLERK.

                              ANGRY MAN
                But what if ours is contaminated?!

                              CLERK

  EXT. BAILEY S TAVERN - NIGHT105105

  Mayor Green helps Peter unload the ham radio from the trunk.  
  The Mayor has to stop.  He begins coughing.  Pale and sick.

                              PETER
                Dad, you don t look well.  Let me 
                take you home.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                I m fine.  Let s get it inside.

  INT. BAILEY S TAVERN - NIGHT106106

  The tavern is now half full.  The people with no families to 
  go home to are riding this out together.  The doors burst 
  open and the Mayor shouts at the SEXY BARMAID, known to her 
  friends and neighbors as MARY BAILEY, 32.

                              MAYOR GREEN (O.S.)

                  immediately.

  EXT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT108108

  We see a pair of little feet run toward the lug wrench.  The 
  feet jump.  The feet land.  Click.  The lug nut budges.  The 
  image tracks up to a little fat girl.  Jake smiles.

                              JAKE
                What s your name?                                                                                49.



                              HILDA
                Hilda.

  Jake smiles at her.  Hilda smiles back.  A long beat.

                              JAKE
                      (funny)
                I DIDN T TELL YOU TO STOP JUMPING.  
                COME ON!

  Hilda goes back to starting position.  Jake shakes his head.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                God, is there anything worse than 
                handling kids?

  EXT. SHELL GAS STATION - NIGHT109109

  The answer is yes.  Handling adults.  The gas can is dropped 
  as the Burly Man throws the first punch.

  INT. SHELL GAS STATION - CONVENIENCE MART - NIGHT110110

  Over the shouting protests of the Clerk, the angry crowd 
  begins taking the convenience store s water supply.

                Where are you going!?  You can t 
                just take it!

  INT. GRACIE LEIGH S SUPERMARKET - NIGHT111111

  Dale Turner leaves the store through the back, his arms 
  loaded with frozen foods.  Gracie is confused and frightened.

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                Dale, what are you doing, honey?

  EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT112112

  The Fire Chief, Rod Hawkins, and the Firemen are surrounded

                Lights.  Lights.  Well, we got a 
                couple portable generators.  And 
                some flashlights.  Not enough to 
                cover the streets, though.

                              FIRE MAN (V.O.)
                Chief, we got real problems down

  Gray Anderson hears the news about the Shell Station.  He 
    considers.  Then, he leaves the scene.

  EXT. BAILEY S TAVERN - NIGHT113113

  Peter stands with Mary Bailey, the sexy barmaid, out in the 
  alley.  He s on his knee, trying to start the generator.

                              MARY BAILEY
                Peter, what are we going to do?

                              PETER

                              MARY BAILEY
                I m scared.  Peter...

  Peter turns around.  She looks at him.  One look and we 
  suddenly realize... they are not talking about the bomb.

                              PETER
                  I can t... we can t... not anymore.

                              MARY BAILEY
                But... Peter, I need you.

                              PETER
                I m sorry.  I have to be there for 
                my family.

  INT. BAILEY S TAVERN - NIGHT114114

  The lights come on.  The frightened crowd surrounds the Mayor 
  as he turns on the ham radio.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                This is Mayor Johnston Green of

                plant.  Is anyone there?

  EXT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT115115

  The 4 lug nuts are on the ground.  Jake slaps himself a 
  couple of times to stay awake, but the blood loss is making 
  it difficult.  Hilda huffs and puffs.

                              HILDA
                Are you okay, mister?                                                                                51.

                Just don t let me fall asleep, 
                Hilda.  Come on, guys.

  Jake directs two boys pull the flat tire off of the bus.  
  They pick up the spare tire.  Jake helps them guide it into 
  the right spot.  Click.  Jake grabs the lug wrench, puts the 
  lug nut in place, and starts turning.  

  EXT. JERICHO STREET - NIGHT116116

  Gray Anderson continues walking, past terrified townspeople.  

  INT. BAILEY S TAVERN - NIGHT117117

  Mayor Green keeps trying channels.  Static.  Static.  Mary 
  Bailey looks at Peter.  Peter looks away.  The EMT CREW CHIEF 
  enters with the sealed envelope.

  The Fire Chief puts his radio away.  He looks at the portable 
  generators, flashlights, and lanterns on the streets.  Sighs.

                              FIRE CHIEF
                We re just not going to have enough 
                light.

                              FIRE MAN
                Maybe torches?  I don t know.

                              VOICE (O.S.)
                Turn on your headlights.

  The Fire Chief looks around in the crowd.  They find the face 
  of... Rod Hawkins.

                              ROD HAWKINS
                Have everyone turn on their head-
                lights and point them at the street.

  The Fire Chief looks at Rod Hawkins.                                                                                 52.



                              FIRE CHIEF
                Are you sure you re not the science 
                teacher?

  EXT. GRACIE LEIGH S SUPERMARKET - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT119119

  Dale Turner exits the store, his arms loaded with frozen 
  dinners.  And just when we thought he was indeed looting, 
  Gracie Leigh follows, her own arms loaded with frozen foods.  
  The image follows Gracie as she lays the dinners on...

  ... and enormous stack of frozen foods.  Dale has turned the 
  freezing alley into a makeshift freezer.  It looks like Dale 
  and she put the whole store in the back alley.  

                              DALE
                The food won t go rotten as long as 
                the weather stays below freezing.  
                But we need to get a tarp up to 
                keep the sun off of it tomorrow 
                morning.  Hopefully, they ll fix 
                the power before then.

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                Thank you for this, Dale.  But I 
                can take it from here.  You should 
                get on back to your mother.

  Dale is silent.  Then, he begins crying.  It finally dawns on 
  Gracie that Dale is all alone in this world.  She holds him.

  INT. BAILEY S TAVERN - NIGHT120120

  The crowd watches as Mayor Green reads the letter.  We see a 
  few words.   Bonnie Peterson...   Atlanta...   At the bottom 
  of the letter...  Honey, how many pills do you have left? 

                              PETER
                What does the letter say, dad?

  EXT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT121121

  Jake tightens that last lug nut.  Starts to lower the jack.

  INT. SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS122122

  Julie sits with Heather, who looks ghastly now.

                              HILDA
                Miss?

                              HEATHER
                Yes, Julie?                                                                                53.



                              JULIE
                Are we going to have school 
                anymore?

  Heather is about to say,  Of course  when she stops.  She 
  realizes she has no idea what tomorrow will bring.

                              HEATHER
                We ll figure it out, honey.

                              JULIE
                I vote no.

  Heather smiles, weakly.  Just then, Hilda and the two boys 
  rush into the bus, followed by Jake.  He moves to the school 
  bus driver, grabs him with his right arm, and struggles to 
  drag him out of the seat.

  INT. BAILEY S TAVERN - NIGHT123123

  Mayor Green looks at the frightened crowd.  Somberly.  He 
  folds the letter.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Bonnie Peterson's boyfriend was 
                killed outside of Atlanta by... 
                another explosion.  We can rule out 
                  accidents now.  We re under attack.

  EXT. SHELL GAS STATION - NIGHT124124

  The fight has spread.  People are beginning to loot more than 
  the water at the convenience mart.  The Fire Men scream.

                              FIRE MEN
                 For God s sake!    Stop it!   
                 We re all in this together! 

  INT. BAILEY S TAVERN - NIGHT125125

  The Mayor turns back to the ham radio.  He struggles to keep 
  his composure in front of the distraught crowd as he leans 
  into the ham radio microphone.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                This is Mayor Johnston Green of 
                Jericho, Kansas.  Is there anyone 
                out there who might have seen...
                      (voice breaks)
                ... my son?                                                                                54.



  INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT126126

  Jake gets in the driver s seat.  He starts the engine.  He 
  blinks twice.  Feeling faint.  His leg bleeding.  He fights 
  it.  But he can t.  He collapses.  His head hits the steering 
  wheel with a...

  INT. BAILEY S TAVERN - NIGHT127127

  GONG!  The church bell is ringing.  The Mayor, Peter, Mary 
  Bailey, and the others look at each other.

  EXT. GREEN FAMILY HOUSE - NIGHT128128

  GONG!  Gail and Ann leave the house to see what s going on.  
  Ann carries the baby.  Gail holds Woody s hand.

  INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT129129

  Hilda, crying, pounds on Jake s shoulders.

                              HILDA
                Mister, wake up!  Please, wake up!

  EXT. SHELL GAS STATION - NIGHT130130

  GONG!  The noise quiets down the crowd.

  EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT131131

  GONG!  Alvie, his mother, Stephanie, Rod Hawkins, and the 
  Fire Chief all begin walking toward the sound of the bell.

  INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT132132

  Hilda pounds on him.  Jake opens his eyes.  Shakes out the 
  cobwebs.  Hilda keeps punching.

                              JAKE
                Thanks, Hilda.  You can stop 
                hitting me now.

  EXT. JIMMY S HOUSE - NIGHT133133

  GONG!  The two Margarets leave the house with the children.

  INT. STANLEY S PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT134134

  GONG!  Stanley Peterson puts a comforting hand on Bonnie s 
  shoulder.  She begins to cry.                                                                                55.



  EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT135135

  The bus inches away from the tree it struck.  Jake backs up 
  the bus.  Gets it onto the road.

  EXT. MAYFLOWER HOTEL - NIGHT136136

  GONG!  Mimi Clark leaves the hotel to follow the sound.

  EXT. GRACIE LEIGH S SUPERMARKET - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT137137

  GONG!  Gracie heads toward the sound.  Dale doesn t.

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                Dale, honey... aren t you coming?

                              DALE
                Someone has to guard your food.

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                This is Jericho.  We don t lock our 
                doors.  No one s going to steal it.

                              DALE
                Not everyone is as nice as you, 
                Mrs. Leigh.  And there are animals.  
                It s okay.  I ll be fine.

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                Thank you, Dale.  You might have 
                just saved the town, you know?

                              DALE
                Anything for you, ma am.  I won t 
                let anything ever happen to you.

  Gracie walks away, but not before looking back to see Dale,  
  stomping his feet and blowing on his hands to keep warm.  
  Having gone from the age of 17 to 40 in the space of 5 hours.

  EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT138138

  GONG!  The throngs of people descend upon the church.  We see 
  quick reunions as Woody runs over to Jimmy s Margaret.  

                              WOODY
                Mom, I took care of the nice ladies!

  Peter rushes to Ann, much to Mary Bailey s dismay.  And 
  finally, Mayor Green joins Gail with a hug.                                                                                56.



  On the last GONG, the headlights and lanterns go on, 
    illuminating... GRAY ANDERSON.  He stands in front of the 
  church on the top of the hill, welcoming his town.

  INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT139139

  Jake looks at the odometer.  The gas gauge is hovering on 
  empty.  He turns to Heather, who fights to stay awake.

                              JAKE
                Don t you quit on me.

  Heather nods, weakly.  Jake turns back to the road, looks to 
  his left, and his eyes open WIDE.

  EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT140140

  The school bus passes the PRISON BUS and keeps moving down 
  the road.  The image follows it, then moves to the other side 
  of the prison bus.  The Sheriff and all of his men are dead 
  on the ground.  Their uniforms stripped off.  Their car gone.  
  The image moves to the Sheriff s hand where his radio starts 
  making a crackling sound.

                              JIMMY (V.O.)
                Sheriff?  Sheriff?  It's Jimmy.  Is 
                that your car behind us?  Why 
                aren t you with the kids?  Sheriff?  
                Slow down.  Sheriff.  You re going 
                to hit us.  Sheriff?!  Stop!!!!

                                    ACT FIVE

  INT. SCHOOL BUS - NIGHT141141

  The gas gauge is now below the red.  Jake glares at it.  
  Woozy, he blinks a couple of times.  Pale.  He turns and sees 
  Heather, who smiles at him weakly.  Until...

                              JAKE
                Does this bus have a gas can?

  She shakes her head, no.  Jake looks at the gas gauge again.  
  Looks at the rearview mirror at the children.

                              JAKE (CONT'D)
                Kids... do you know what road we re 
                on? 
                      (off their  no )
                This is Cedar Run.  If you go 
                straight ahead for a long way, 
                you ll come to a stop light.  Then, 
                if you make a left...

                              JULIE
                Which way is left?

  Jake looks at Heather, who nods, sadly.  She understands that 
  the children might have to make it back on their own.

                              HEATHER
                      (gestures with her hand)
                If you hold up your hand and stick 
                out your thumb, it makes an  L , 
                see?  That s left.

  Jake smiles at Heather.

                              JAKE
                They don t pay you enough.
                      (to kids)
                So, kids, turn in the direction of 
                the  L  and walk straight ahead for 
                a long way.  That s where town is.

  The kids all nod to each other.   Oh.   And then...

                              JULIE
                Why are you telling us this?

  Jake looks at Heather.

                              JAKE
                You want to take this one?                                                                                58.



  INT. CHURCH - NIGHT142142

  The crowd is noisy.  Torches, flashlights, and lanterns 
    illuminate faces, casting shadows.  Gray Anderson stands at 
  the pulpit as Mayor Green moves to the front of the room.

                              GRAY ANDERSON
                With all due respect, Mr. Mayor, 
                this isn t a debate about road 
                signs and taxes.  We have a missing 
                bus.  No police.  Fireman doing 
                  policemen's jobs.  No plan.

                              PETER
                Gray, how dare you politicize--

                              MAYOR GREEN
                      (under his breath)
                Dammit, Peter.

  Big reaction.  The crowd split down the middle.  Some 
  shouting,  Yes!   Some shouting,  No!   Gail sighs.

                              GRAY ANDERSON
                  Politicize?  Peter, I m not talking 
                to my opponent.  I m talking to my 
                Mayor.  There was almost a riot at 
                the Shell station, and I haven t 
                seen him in hours.  What?  You 
                think I planned that just to get a 
                few votes?  

  Peter is silenced.  He sits down.  

                              GRAY ANDERSON (CONT D)
                I don t care about the election.  I 
                care about survival.  We might be 
                on our own here, and I need to know 
                what my Mayor intends to do.

  The Mayor takes the stage.  Scans the crowd.  He collects 
  himself and gives a heartfelt address.  He means every word.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Folks, I know we ve been through a 
                lot tonight, but I want to tell you 
                  something.  I have been to big 
                cities.  I have been to foreign 
                  countries.  And I would take the 
                good people...

  Shep, the union boss, nods.  He s not being cruel, but...                                                                                59.



                              SHEP
                ... good people of Jericho over any 
                city.  We know, Mr. Mayor.  We ve 
                heard the speech.  We need to know 
                what you re going to do now.

  The Mayor is taken aback.  If he weren t such a proud man, 
  you might have seen his heart break a little bit.  Gail 
  watches, concerned.  Not for the Mayor.  For her husband.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Well, uh... Shep, I hope you don t 
                think I ve been asleep at the 
                switch here.  I have spent tonight 
                trying to contact the governor to 
                  coordin--

                              SHEP
                But what if the governor is dead, 
                Mr. Mayor?

  That starts the seed.  People we ve come to know begin asking 
  the real questions.  Some helpful.  Some frightened.  Louder 
  and louder.  The Mayor does his best to keep up.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Now, hold on.  There have been no 
                reports of anything happening to 
                Topek--

                              IRATE WOMAN
                How are there going to be reports 
                with no phones?

                                NORMAN PERRY
                Or no televisions.

              MAYOR GREENSTEPHANIE

                      (to Stephanie)

                                GRACIE LEIGH
                How are we going to get the power 
                back on, Mr. Mayor?                                                                                60.



              WOMAN S VOICEMAN S VOICE
  What about firewood?  I m Is the drinking water okay?


                              MAYOR GREEN
                Folks, one at a time.

                BURLY MANJIMMY S MARGARET
  What happens when we run out Let the Mayor speak!


  Gray Anderson slowly steps back into the shadows and watches 
  as the town swallows the Mayor with questions he can t 
  possibly answer.  Peter bangs the pulpit for order.  People 
  shout at him angrily.  Teasing.

                              SHEP
                Oh, Peter, put your gavel away.

                              MAYOR GREEN
                Please, folks.  Calm down.

                              IRATE FATHER
                Calm down?  My boy is still out 
                there, and you--

                              MAYOR GREEN
                The sheriff is looking for your boy 
                and my boy right now.

                              IRATE MOTHER
                And why weren t there more police 
                in the budget?!

                              IRATE WOMAN
                Why didn t we have more emergency 
                workers?

                              MAYOR GREEN
                The school needed books.

  Gail joins the fray.

                              GAIL
                People, please.  This shouting 
                isn t helping anything.

  She is swallowed.  Voices shouting.  Gray Anderson watches 
  the chaos with a measured eye.  A faint, pleased look.  He 
  takes the stage, raises his arms to give the town the 
    leadership it needs, and just as he opens his mouth...

  HONK.  HONK.  HONK.                                                                                61.



  EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT143143

  The school bus limps into town, through the rows of 
    headlights and lanterns, its horn honking.  It stops in front 
  of the proud statue.

  INT. SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS144144

  Jake, relieved almost to the point of tears, puts the bus in 
  park.  And turns off the engine with a shaking hand.

  EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT145145

  The people rush out of the church, down the hill, to the 
  school bus, as Jake staggers out.  He looks like a ghost.

                              JAKE
                Help them.

  EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT146146

  Illuminated by the town s headlights and Mr. Henderson s 
  lanterns, we see the best of Jericho at work.  

  The Fire Chief guides the EMT vans to the bus.  The EMT Crew 
  Chief pushes little Stacy.  Alvie and his mom follow with 
    Stephanie.  

                                TERESA CLEMONS
                Oh, Stacy.

                              EMT CREW CHIEF
                Don t worry, ma am.  We got her.

  Little Danny is scooped up by the Young Couple who first told 
  the Mayor about the school bus.  The second the Irate Father 
  sees his little girl, Hilda, he bursts into tears of relief.  
  The Irate Mother hugs her precious Julie.

  Gail, Mayor Green, Peter, and Ann move to the bus.  The crowd 
  parts and they see Jake, being loaded on a stretcher.

                              GAIL
                Oh, Jake!

  Gail rushes up to him.  Grabs his left hand.  Winces.   Ow! 

                              GAIL (CONT'D)
                      (cries laughs)
                Sorry.  Sorry.

  The crowd whispers,  Is that Jake Green?   Seconds later... 
  Peter, Mayor Green, and Ann approach Jake.                                                                                62.



                              EMT MAN
                Mrs. Green, we have to move him.

  Gail backs away.  Mayor Green and Jake look at each other.  A 
  mixture of every emotion.  Mayor Green touches Jake s good 
  shoulder.  Peter watches with a trace of jealousy.

                              JAKE
                Dad, there s an empty prison bus 
                out there.  

                              MAYOR GREEN
                I ll take care of it.

  Mayor Green backs away, but not before...

                              JAKE
                Oh, Dad.  One more thing.

  Mayor Green approaches and Jake puts something in his hand.  
  The EMT Crew carts Jake away and loads him on the ambulance 
  with Heather Lisinski.  The doors close.

  INT. AMBULANCE - MOMENTS LATER147147

  Heather and Jake ride in the back of the Ambulance.  Jake 
  turns to Heather.  They smile.  A lifetime in one night.

                              JAKE
                What s your name?

                              HEATHER
                Heather.

                              JAKE
                Jake.

                              HEATHER
                It s nice to meet you, Jake.

                              JAKE
                You, too.

  They both finally close their eyes for sleep.

  EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT148148

  As the ambulances pull away, Mayor Green looks at the SWISS 
  ARMY KNIFE in his hand.  He turns to his town.  Mayor Green 
  is now a man who has seen the dark side of his town and will 
  never be the same.  He speaks from the heart.                                                                                63.



                              MAYOR GREEN
                You said you ve heard the speech 
                before, Shep.  But you ever wonder 
                why I say it?  Because I happen to 
                trust you people.  Because I love 
                my town so much that I never 
                thought you could riot.

  The crowd stares back at him.  He doesn t blink.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT D)
                You want to blame me for that?  
                Well, you go right ahead if you re 
                fresh out of mirrors.  Have someone 
                treat you like children.  Have a 
                dictator if you want.  But it s 
                never going to be me.

  The crowd looks down.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT'D)
                  Something happened in Denver.  
                  Something happened in Atlanta.  And 
                there s a chance we could wake up 
                and find out that s where it 
                stopped.  So, until we know, are we 
                going to use our imaginations to 
                solve problems or cause them?

  The Burly Man and Norman Perry look at the ground.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT'D)
                We can get the power on.  We can 
                find out how big this thing is.  We 
                can feed ourselves.  Protect 
                  ourselves.  Fight if we have to.

  Mimi Clark looks over at Stanley and Bonnie Peterson.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT D)
                But the only way that s going to 
                happen is if we work together.  I 
                know where I stand.  How about you?

  Gray Anderson watches the crowd.  Silent.  Digesting.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT'D)
                My son said there is an empty 
                prison bus out there, so until the 
                police return, I need guards on 
                every entrance and exit out of 
                town.  Volunteers?                                                                                64.



  The Fire Chief, Rod Hawkins, and the Burly Man raise their 
  hands along with some of the other men in town.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT D)
                Thank you.  Everyone else, go home.  
                We ll meet at the town hall in the 
                morning.  And folks... don t you 
                dare break my heart again.

  As the crowd disperses, the Mayor turns to his family.

                              MAYOR GREEN (CONT D)
                Come on.  Let s go to Jake.

  Some people shake hands.  Like the EMT Crew Chief and the 
  Fire Chief.  Other people are more suspicious.  Like Shep and 
  Norman Perry - union and management.  Still others reach out 
  to each other.  Like the two Margarets with the kids.

                                BILL S MARGARET
                Don t worry.  Jimmy and Bill will 
                be home soon.

  Just before the Mayor gets into Peter s Oldsmobile, he looks 
  over at Gray Anderson.  The men lock eyes.  Both smart, both 
  tough, both savvy.  It s going to be a dogfight.  

  As the volunteers team up to stand watch, the Fire Chief 
    approaches Rod Hawkins, looking out into the night.  The 
  world outside of Jericho.

                              FIRE CHIEF
                What are you thinking, Mr. Hawkins?  

                              ROD HAWKINS
                I was just wondering what it was 
                all going to look like in the  
                morning.

  The two men stand silently, watching.  The image pushes past 
  them into the darkness.  Into the world outside of Jericho.

  INT. EMILY SPENSER S HOUSE - NIGHT149149

  We see the champagne.  The ice is now melted.  We see the 
   Welcome Home, Roger  sign.  We see the candles, still 
  waiting to be lit.  We end on the Post-It Note: Roger s 
  flight.  Kansas City Airport.  11:00pm.
