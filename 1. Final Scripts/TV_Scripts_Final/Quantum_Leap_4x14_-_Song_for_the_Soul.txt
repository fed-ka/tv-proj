      INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT - ON SAM

      An explosion of azure and white subsides into sam as he is
      being hustled off stage. He slams his head into a low
      overhang while screams and applause wash in from the wings.
      "My Boyfriends Back" vamps from the house band on stage.

      WIDER ANGLE

      Sam wears a beehive wig and a black chiffon dress. He is
      being pushed by two black girls in identical wigs and
      dresses. The smallest is Lynell. She is all of fifteen and 
      a bundle of adorable energy. Next to her is Paula, 
      seventeen, lanky and all attitude.

                                  PAULA
                          (To sam)
                    Are you all right?

                                  LYNELL
                            (Thrilled)
                    Listen, God listen, they love us!

                                  PAULA
                      Girlfriend, we were bad!

      They slide some skin and squeal with delight. The announcer
      yells to the audience from the stage.

                                  BOBBY LEE'S VOICE
                    Y'all want more?

      Screams and cheers from the crowd.

                                  BOBBY LEE'S VOICE
                              (continuing)
                    Let's bring 'em back one more time!
                            (Beat)
                    Ladies and Gentlemen, The Lovettes.

      They both turn wide-eyed to Sam; a mix of panic and delight
      flushes their faces.                                  LYNELL
                    They want an encore!
                            (beat)
                    Cheree, what do we do!

                                  SAM
                    What?

      NEW ANGLE - INCLUDING BOBBY LEE

      He's slick and handsome and is all style with his conk and
      shiny sharkskin suit. He anxiously rushes up to the girls 
      and Sam.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Ladies, ladies, get to it!

                                  PAULA
                    We don't have any more songs.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                          (to Sam)
                    Just do a reprise. Cheree?

                                  SAM
                    Oh, no I...I don't think I...

      Sam catches his reflection in a full length mirror.

      SAM'S POV - INTO MIRROR

      A healthy black girl, stuffed into the chiffon dress, 
      stares back at him. Her eyes widen as she looks from the 
      beehive wig and down to the dress. Then settling on 
      Cheree's face, we hear...

                                  LYNELL'S VOICE
                    Come on Cheree.

      FEATURING SAM - INCLUDING MIRROR IMAGE

      His expression is one of total stun as he mouths...

                                  SAM
                    Oh, boy.                                  PAULA
                            (calls out to the band 
                            leader)
                    From the bridge!

      They shove a reluctant Sam back on stage as we...

                                                                            FADE OUT:

      INT. BOBBY'S BLUE NOTE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT - FEATURING SAM

      He is hopelessly trying to get through the lyrics, not to
      mention the choreography of "My Boy Friend's Back."


                                    PAULA/LYNELL/SAM
                    'And he knows that you've been
                    tryin', and he knows that you've
                    been lyin'. What made you think he
                    believes all your lies. My Boy
                    Friend's back and there's gonna be
                    trouble.'

                                  SAM AND PAULA
                    'Hey la de la, My Boy Friend's
                    back. Hey la del la My Boy
                    Friend's Back.'

      Lynell wails on top, trying to hold onto the crowd all the
      while looking from Paula to Sam, as if he's lost his mind.

      WIDER SHOT

      The audience is with them for awhile, but even they are
      having trouble figuring out what the hell is going on. The
      handclaps dissipate from a rockin' full house to a measly 
      few.

      CLOSE ON SAM

      He's dying. As he smiles and fakes his way through the end 
      of the number, you have to feel for the way he's suffering.

      ON GIRLS AND SAM

      They can't believe what's happening. They hit their final
      pose and Sam scrambles to match the picture. We hold an
      anguished beat, and we hang on to the sound of one hand
      clapping, as we...

                                                                              CUT TO:      EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT - ON SAM AND GIRLS

      They talk and walk down a southside neighborhood street,
      carrying their bundles of costumes and wigs. Their makeup 
      has been washed away and they are dressed in cotton dresses 
      of the period. For the first time you can see how young 
      these girls are. In the distance a street gang harmonizes a 
      "Do Wop".

                                  LYNELL'S VOICE
                    You must have hit your head a lot
                    harder than you thought.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      NEW ANGLE

      Sam looks around him, a little uncomfortable about the area
      they are walking in. They pass an occasional wino.

                                  SAM
                      Uh...yeah. I guess I did.

                                  PAULA
                            (angry)
                    We could have won.
                            (beat)
                    That would have been a hundred
                    dollars, new costumes and a shot
                    at the finals.

                                  LYNELL
                    Bobby Lee said we could come back
                    and try again.

                                  PAULA
                    He was scopin' you so hard, he
                    would have said anything.

                                  LYNELL
                    That's not true. He just saw that
                    Cheree hurt herself and wanted to
                    give us another chance.

                                  PAULA
                    We should have won.      Paula notices Sam checking out the street.


                                  PAULA
                              (continuing; to Sam)
                    Now, what's your problem?

                                  SAM
                    Well, I was just thinking that it
                    was kind of late for you...us...to
                    be out walking around by ourselves.

                                  LYNELL
                    My daddy would kill me if he knew
                    I was here and so would yours.

                                  PAULA
                    Cheree's old man doesn't stay home
                    long enough to know when she's
                    gone.

                                  RAG HEAD TEEN'S VOICE
                    Hey baby, come on over here and
                    talk to me.

      The "Do Wop" dissipates into cat calls and whistles.

      NEW ANGLE - INCLUDING THREE HARD-LOOKING BLACKS

      They lounge all over the stoop of a run-down Brownstone.
      Garbage is strewn around them.

                                  PAULA
                    Now, who the hell would want to
                    talk to your ugly ass?

                                  SAM
                    Paula...

                                  RAG HEAD TEEN
                    You're talkin' to me, Paula. Come
                    on, bring your fine brown body
                    over here...                                  PAULA
                    I said I don't talk to night
                    crawlers. So why don't you just
                    crawl back into whatever hole you
                    crawled out of.

      The boys start to get up and Paula stops defiantly and puts
      her hands on her hips. Sam grabs Paula by the arm and pulls
      her along.

                                  LYNELL
                    Damn, Paula!

                                  SAM
                          (to girls)
                    Just keep walking.

      The boys circle around in front of them. The Rag Head stops
      Sam.

                                  RAG HEAD TEEN
                    What about you darlin'? 'Cause you
                    know I like me some tall, healthy
                    woman.

                                  SAM
                    Why don't you and your friends
                    just go on back and sit down.

                                  RAG HEAD TEEN
                    Why don't you just sit down with
                    me?

                                  LYNELL
                    Well, actually we were supposed to
                    be home hours ago, and my father's
                    gonna be real upset if...

                                  RAG HEAD TEEN
                            (grabbing Lynell)
                    Well, let's give him somethin' to
                    be real upset about.

      NEW ANGLE - FEATURING SAM

      Sam's moves are so fast that the youth never knew what hit
      him. A roundhouse kick, followed through with a straight      kick, sends the boy into a mound of trash cans. The little
      group stands frozen in shock for a beat and then Sam takes 
      a stance to face off the other two youths. They scramble 
      and vanish into the night, with the Rag Head a few steps 
      behind.

      ON SAM, PAULA AND LYNELL

      They are staring at Sam with their mouths hanging wide 
      open.

      Sam shuffles, trying to cover and starts walking, dragging
      the two stunned girls with him.

                                  PAULA
                    How did you do that?

                                  SAM
                    I think we better get home.

                                  LYNELL
                    We live this way.
                            (turning the corner)
                    Cheree, I think we better get you
                    to the hospital. I mean, somethin'
                    must of really happened when you
                    hit your head.

                                  PAULA
                    Are you crazy? That bump turned
                    this child into some kind of
                      supergirl.

      Paula mimics one of Sam's moves like a dance step.

                                  PAULA
                              (continuing)
                    Maybe we can put some of it in the
                    act.
                            (beat)
                    I love this move.

                                  SAM
                      I...really don't know what
                    happened back there. But I do know
                    young girls shouldn't be walking
                    the streets at two in the morning.                                  LYNELL
                      Especially one with a mouth like
                    Paula.

                                  PAULA
                    I can take care of myself!

                                  LYNELL
                    Yeah, right.

      NEW ANGLE

      They turn the corner and head past a row of old Brownstone
      houses. They stop and head down some steep steps to a
      basement door. Lynell hands her bundle to Sam. Her voice
      drops to a whisper and she begins to work the lock with a
      hidden key.

                                  LYNELL
                              (continuing)
                    All I know is if Cheree hadn't
                    done whatever it was she did,
                    you'd be tellin' my daddy about it
                    'cause I'd a made sure I was dead.
                            (reaching for bundle)
                    Are you gonna spend the night?

                                  SAM
                    Well, no, maybe I better...

                                  MAN'S VOICE
                    Maybe the three of you better...

      WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING REVEREND WALTERS

      He's a tall, imposing man of about fifty. He stands before
      them wearing a simple sweater and a stern look. Reverend
      Walters voice explodes like a cannon in the night.


                                  REV. WALTERS
                    ...get your hides right through
                    this door and do some serious
                      explaining about what my daughter
                    is doing out until two in the
                    morning.      Paula, Sam and Lynell look like deer caught in someone's
      headlights, wide-eyed and frozen.


                                  REV. WALTERS
                              (continuing)
                    I said, inside!

                                  SAM'S VOICE OVER
                    Leaping into other people's lives
                    has taught me never to judge a
                    book by its cover, as well as many
                    other equally cliche, but useful,

      INT. WALTERS HOME - MIRROR SHOT

      The girls sit quietly in a row on the living room couch
      looking down at their hands while the Reverend preaches to
      them about the sins of singing in nightclubs. Lynell is in
      tears.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    ...and you certainly aren't old enough 
                    or experienced enough to understand 
                    the kind of people who frequent places 
                    like that. Not to mention the fact 
                    that three young girls have no place 
                    on the streets of Chicago unescorted 
                    at two o'clock in the morning. And 
                    since you are foolish enough to not 
                      understand the dangers of life in a 
                    big city...

                                  SAM'S VOICE OVER
                    I liked this man. Even with all his 
                      blustering and bravado, Reverend 
                    Walters was actually saying
                      everything that I had wanted to say 
                    since this leap started. His concern
                    for his daughter's safety and well-
                    being was as grounded in as much 
                                  (MORE)                                  SAM'S VOICE OVER (CONT'D)
                    reality as the walk we just took
                    home.

      NEW ANGLE

      Camera pans around with the pacing Reverend to reveal Sam
      sitting on the couch.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    So, I've taken it upon myself to
                    call your parents and tell them
                    what's going on and how you
                    children have lied to us.

                                  LYNELL
                    We wouldn't have to lie if you'd
                    come hear us, Daddy.

                                  PAULA
                    We're really good, Reverend.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    I will not support my fifteen-year-
                    old daughter singing in a brothel.

                                  PAULA
                    It's not a brothel!

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Paula, your mother is waiting up
                    for you right now and Cheree,
                    since your parents are...not
                    in...you are staying with Lynell
                    and I, until they come back.

                                  LYNELL
                    I...I don't think you understand
                    how important this is to us, Daddy.


                                  REV. WALTERS
                          (to Lynell)
                    What's important is that you
                      understand there will be no more
                    nonsense about singing in

      NEW ANGLE - FEATURING LYNELL AND REVEREND WALTERS

      Lynell stands in terrified defiance, her small frame 
      dwarfed under his strong angular shoulders. She unleashes a 
      rage of anger.

                                  LYNELL
                    It...it's not nonsense.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Not finishing school is nonsense.
                    Not getting your degree is
                    nonsense. Not becoming...

                                  LYNELL
                    I want people to hear me sing!

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    You can sing for God and my
                      congregation.

                                  LYNELL
                    God gave me a voice to do with
                    whatever I want.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Not as long as you are under my
                    roof.

                                  LYNELL
                    Then I'll leave!

                                  SAM
                    Lynell!

                                  LYNELL
                          (to Sam)
                    I won't let him lock me away in
                    this miserable house. I killed
                    mama and I won't let it kill me
                    too!

      With that Lynell runs out of the room, trying desperately 
      to hold onto her emotions.                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Lynell! Lynell Walters!
                            (beat)
                    You come back here.

      NEW ANGLE - ON ALL

      Sobbing, Lynell races up the stairs to her bedroom. Paula 
      is on her feet and about to go after her when Reverend 
      Walters holds her back.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                              (continuing)
                    Let her go, Paula.

      Paula turns on the Reverend. He is crestfallen by his
      daughter's words. His eyes never leave the empty stairs.

                                  PAULA
                    She didn't mean that, Reverend. I
                    swear she didn't.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                            (softly)
                    But she did. She still misses her
                    mother.
                            (beat)
                    I love her and I have to do what
                    I believe is right. She'll
                      understand that when she grows up.
                          (to Paula)
                    I better walk you home. Your
                    mama's up waitin' for you.

                                  SAM
                    I'll walk her home. Why don't you
                    go talk to your daughter.

      The Reverend smiles.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    And then who's gonna walk you back
                    here?                                  PAULA
                    Cheree can take care of herself,
                    Reverend. You should have seen...

      Sam clamps a hand over her mouth to shut her up. Sam looks
      into the mirror.

      SAM'S POV - MIRROR SHOT - ON CHEREE AND PAULA

      The two girls stand there as Paula pulls her hand away and
      shoots her a look.


                                  SAM/CHEREE
                    Of course. I don't know what I was
                    thinking of.

      NEW ANGLE - BACK ON SCENE

      The Reverend Walters picks up Paula's bundle, hands it to 
      her and then gestures toward the door. He turns back to 
      Sam.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Tell Lynell to get you a nightgown
                    from her mother's chest. There's
                    a blue one that should fit you
                    just fine.
                            (beat)
                    We'll all talk after services
                    tomorrow.

      With that he opens the door and gestures for Paula to exit.
      Paula shoots a last look at Sam and they head out, closing
      the door behind him.

      He stands quietly in the b.g., watching. Sam startles a

                    All Ziggy's come up with is that
                    her mother dies five years ago of
                    no apparent causes.

                    From what little we have to put
                    together, she just went to her bed
                    one day and stayed there until she
                    died, six months later.

                                  SAM

                    Lynell deal with her mother's

      She stands watching Sam with a curious look on her face. He
      picks up a photo of the three girls together in the living
      room.                                  SAM

                    People are gonna think you're as
                    crazy as I feel.

                                  SAM
                    You're not crazy.

      Sam crosses next to her and the two of them sit on the 
      sofa.

      FEATURING SAM AND LYNELL

      She is dressed in her babydoll PJ's and holds a folded
      nightgown in her arms. There is almost a reverence in the 
      way she touches it before she passes it on to Sam. Al 
      stands to the sides. He and Sam exchange a look. The 
      handlink beeps.

                    I'm going to be, if I don't get

                    Your father seems to be trying to

                                  LYNELL
                    He wants to control me.

                    He loves you.

                    I don't think your mother's death
                    was your father's fault.

                                  LYNELL
                    You weren't here, Cheree. You

      The strains of a gospel chorus wail and fill the cloudless
      sky with songs of praise. Above the chorus Lynell's voice
      soars clear and free singing, "He may not come when you 
      want him, but he's right on time."

      well as the handclaps of the congregation, praise the Lord.

      Sam rolls his eyes to heaven as they start to fall into a
      groove. The song lays into the ending vamp and even Sam 
      looks like he's starting to have fun.

                                  LYNELL

      NEW ANGLE - FEATURING BOBBY LEE

      He stands in the bedroom doorway looking wickedly handsome
      and holding a slip covered forty-five. The girls are 
      stunned and Sam and Al are suspicious.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    It's by Martha and the Vandellas

                    How'd you get in here, Mister Lee?

                                  BOBBY LEE
                            (piano smile)
                    I told you to call me Bobby.

      Al starts a rundown on Bobby. It's obvious that Lynell has 
      a crush on him. But she's more afraid of her father than of 
      her emotional attraction.

                                  LYNELL
                    My father will get upset if he
                    finds you here, Bobby.

                                  PAULA
                    He'll be more than upset, honey.

                    degree.


      CLOSE ON LYNELL AND BOBBY LEE

      He crosses uncomfortably close and stands next to Lynell. 
      He strokes her cheek as he talks to her, his eyes locked 
      into her eyes. There is some definite heat between them and 
      Lynell is totally overwhelmed.                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Well, that's because a lady would
                    never entertain a gentleman in her
                    bedroom.

                                  SAM
                    Well, since you understand that,
                    why don't we go downstairs.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    It's not my fault, you see. There
                    I was, walking down the street,
                    and I heard that sweet, sensual
                    voice of yours riding on a cool
                    breeze. So I walked up to the door
                    and knocked. But nobody came. So
                    I knocked a little harder and...
                            (gesturing the door)
                    ...it opened.

      Al steps into the shot.

                                  OBSERVER
                    Watch him, Sam. This guy's slicker
                    than spit on a pair of patent
                    leather shoes.

      WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING AL

      Sam steps in between Bobby and Lynell and breaks the 
      moment.

                                  SAM
                    You shouldn't be here.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Lynell knows I mean no disrespect.

                                  OBSERVER
                    Trust me, Sam. This is a snake.

                                  SAM
                    I'm sure you didn't. So why don't
                    you leave.

      He kisses Lynell's hand and steps back near Paula, handing
      her the record.                                  BOBBY LEE
                    I still meant what I said about
                    this song.
                            (beat)

                      Especially with a voice like
                    Lynell's.

                                  LYNELL
                    We don't have charts for the band
                    or...

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Can you learn the song?


                                  PAULA/LYNELL
                    Well, yeah.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Then I'll get Rainy to do up some
                    charts. He knows your keys.

                                  SAM
                    Why?

      Bobby Lee cuts Sam a look. The handlink goes wild.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    'Cause I believe in talent. And if

      Sam takes Bobby's arm and directs him out the door. Bobby's
      surprised by the brute force.

                                  SAM
                    Well, Mister Lee Lynell, Paula and
                    I need to talk about this
                      and...listen to the song...

      INT. WALTERS LIVING ROOM - DAY - FEATURING SAM AND BOBBY 
      LEE

      Sam is escorting him down the stairs and toward the front
      door.

                                  SAM
                    ...before we can make a final
                    decision.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    That's a hellified grip you've got
                    there darlin'.

                                  SAM
                    You don't know the half of it.

      WIDER ANGLE - TO REVEAL REVEREND WALTERS

      Paula and Lynell are close behind. Sam reaches the door and
      runs smack dab into the Reverend who's standing in the
      doorway watching everything. Al pops in just in time to 
      know there's big trouble. Everyone else freezes. Like a       bolt of lightening he's got Bobby by the collar, dragging 
      him toward the door.

                                  LYNELL
                    Daddy!

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Get out of my house!

                                  SAM
                    He came by to bring us a new
                    record.

                                  PAULA
                    That's the God's truth, Reverend
                    Walters. It's so new it hasn't
                    even been played on the radio yet.

      Reverend Walters slams Bobby into the door frame and then
      looks at Sam and the girls.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Then you better tell me why this
                    sinner has to deliver his record
                    to my daughter's bedroom?

                                  LYNELL
                    Daddy!

                                  REV. WALTERS
                            (flaring)
                    I asked a question.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    The fact that I don't attend your
                    church doesn't make me a sinner,
                    Reverend.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Even the fact that you don't
                    attend any church doesn't make you
                    a sinner.
                            (beat)
                    But what you said to Leda Brown's
                    little girl, that makes you a
                    sinner.                                  BOBBY LEE
                            (controlled smile)
                    That's her word against mine. Now
                    if you don't mind.

      Bobby pries the Reverend's hands off his jacket lapels. 
      Again Sam looks to Al. Al punches the handlink.

                                  OBSERVER
                    I got nothing, Sam. Whatever
                    happened, the charges were never
                    pressed or else they didn't stick.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Well, in my home your word has as
                    much truth as the devil hisself.

                                  LYNELL
                            (exploding)
                    Stop it!
                            (beat)
                    Mister Lee was trying to be nice
                    to me, not commit a crime.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    This man will only hurt you,
                    Lynell.

                                  LYNELL
                    Does that privilege only belong to
                    you?

      Reverend Walters raises his hand to slap Lynell's face. He
      freezes as she cowers, covering her face. The group is
      stunned.

      FEATURING LYNELL

      Her eyes widen. Shock is the only emotion. He trembles,
      trying to control himself.

                    that brothel down with my bare

                    Do something, Sam. This must be
                    where it started.

                                  LYNELL
                    Stop it!

                                  SAM
                    You better leave, Mister Lee.

      Reverend Walters and Bobby are nose to nose. Sam steps in 
      the middle and pushes the Reverend gently back toward the 
      stairs.

                                  SAM
                              (continuing)
                    Please.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    I'm leaving.

      Even Bobby Lee knows when it's time to go and exits out the
      door. Lynell moves to follow.

                                  LYNELL
                    Daddy, don't do this.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    I'm doing this for your own good.
                            (beat)
                    Now come in and close the door.

      Reverend Walters goes back into the kitchen as Lynell 
      glances from Bobby to her father. As soon as the Reverend 
      disappears, Lynell is out the door.      EXT. WALTERS PORCH - ON SAM AND LYNELL

      She exits out onto the street, Sam is close behind. He 
      grabs her arm and turns her.

                                  SAM
                    Lynell.

      She turns and looks at Sam and then after Bobby Lee, who
      disappears down the street.

                                  LYNELL
                    He's my chance to get out of here.

                                  SAM
                    Maybe there's another way.

                                  LYNELL
                    What?

                                  SAM
                    I don't know.

                                  LYNELL
                    Then let me talk to him.

                                  SAM
                    Not until you give me a chance to
                    figure out another way.

      She looks after Bobby then back to Sam. Flustered, she 
      gives Sam a look and turns going back into the house. Al 
      pops next to Sam.

      His eyes shift from Al to Lynell. His face is filled with

      The city stretches out before us filled with a million 
      faces. As they pass, each face keeps its secrets.

      INT. WALTERS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - FEATURING LYNELL

      Lynell sits on the steps, staring down at her shoes and
      humming. After a beat, Sam comes in and crosses to sit 
      beside her.

                                  SAM
                    What are you doing?

                                  LYNELL
                    Lookin' at my feet.

                                  SAM
                            (looking down)
                    Nice feet.

                                  LYNELL
                            (sigh)
                    Yep, and they're nailed down right
                    here at forty-seventh and Ellis.
                    Nailed down tighter than pine
                    coffin...
                            (looking to Sam)
                    ...and I'm running out of air,
                    Cheree.

      Sam puts a comforting arm around her slumped shoulders.

                                  SAM
                    You're going to be fine.

                                  LYNELL
                            (funny smile)
                    That's what my momma used to say.
                    She'd say, you'll make it just
                    fine Lynell. Just fine.                                  SAM
                    I'm sure she meant it.

      NEW ANGLE

      Lynell gets up and crosses to the upright piano that sits 
      in the corner of the room. She picks up a photo of her 
      mother.

      CLOSE ON PHOTO

      She is a beautiful woman in her thirties. Alive and 
      vibrant.

                                  LYNELL'S VOICE
                    She meant it until the day she
                    decided to die.

      ON LYNELL AND SAM

      She stares sadly down at the photo.

                                  SAM
                    People don't decide to die.

                                  LYNELL
                    Momma did.
                            (beat)
                    And you know what? I think she was
                    happy. Happy to be free.

                                  SAM
                    She couldn't have been happy,
                      Lynell...not to leave a daughter
                    she loved.

                                  LYNELL
                    She hated him more.

      Setting the photo down.

                              (continuing)
                    She tried to leave him once. She
                    took me and she tried to run away.
                    But he brought us back.

                                  SAM
                    Because he loved you.

                                  LYNELL
                    Because he was afraid of what
                    people would say about the
                    righteous Reverend Walters if his
                    wife had run off and left him.
                            (beat)
                    It didn't matter that she was
                    unhappy. Or that she had no life
                    of her own. The only thing that
                    mattered was what everybody
                    thought.
                            (beat)
                    That's when she decided to die.
                    And so will I if we don't sing in
                    that contest tomorrow night.

                                  SAM
                    Singing in a talent contest isn't
                    going to save your life.

                                  LYNELL
                    Bobby will give us a contract
                    and...

                                  SAM
                    We don't need Bobby Lee or his
                    contract.

      He holds up a piece of paper.

                                  SAM
                              (continuing)
                    I called Mister Madison Simms,
                    he's head of Checker Records and
                    he's willing to hear us sing.

                                  LYNELL
                            (excited)
                    When?                                  SAM
                    As soon as I can find a club.

                                  LYNELL
                            (excited)
                    He can hear us at Bobby's club
                    tomorrow night.

                                  SAM
                    No.

                                  LYNELL
                    We don't have a choice.

      NEW ANGLE

      Sam is up and pacing. He knows he is running out of time.

                                  SAM
                            (reluctantly)
                    Okay, we sing in the club.

                                  LYNELL
                            (thrilled)
                    Alright!

                                  SAM
                    But you have to promise not to
                    sign with Bobby.

                                  LYNELL
                    What?

                                  SAM
                      And...finish high school.

      WIDER ANGLE

      The look of hope in her eyes changes to one of betrayal. 
      Sam crosses to her and turns her to him.

                                  SAM
                              (continuing)
                    Trust me, Lynell. It's the only
                    way to get your father to let you
                    sing.                                  LYNELL
                    I can't change him, Cheree.

                                  SAM
                    I think I'm here to try.

      Lynell thinks about Sam's idea. Part of her wants to 
      believe and the other struggles with what has gone before. 
      Finally...

                                  LYNELL
                    How?

                                  SAM
                    We'll invite your father down to
                    see us.

      Her face falls.

                                  LYNELL
                    Are you crazy?

                                  SAM
                    It's the only way. He'll accept
                    your singing career and you accept
                    his love.
                            (beat)
                    It's the only way.

                                  LYNELL
                    But if this doesn't work...

      She turns and walks up the steps.

                                  OBSERVER'S VOICE
                    It doesn't work.

      WIDER ANGLE ON SAM AND AL

      Al stands by the steps watching as Lynell disappears 
      upstairs.

                                  LYNELL
                    ...we sign with Bobby.                                  OBSERVER
                    According to Ziggy, she ends up
                    with Bobby and a miserable life.

      When she's out of earshot...

                                  SAM
                    I don't think history can change
                    until after I talk to her father.

                                  OBSERVER
                    And when do you plan to do that?

                                  SAM
                    Tomorrow night right before the
                    show. You'll choreograph some
                    steps to the new song and...

                                  OBSERVER
                    What about the sleaze with the
                    perfect teeth?

                                  SAM
                    What he doesn't know won't hurt
                    him and keeping Lynell out of his
                    clutches is all that matters.

      Al looks at Sam wondering if he's bitten off more than he 
      can chew. He punches up the stats on the handlink.

                                  OBSERVER
                    Ziggy says this is still going to
                    be a disaster.

                                  SAM
                    Tell Ziggy to have a little faith
                    in human nature.

                    She says that's the problem.

      Sam looks at Al, whose look of concern only spurs him on
      more, as we hear...                                  OBSERVER'S VOICE
                    Hands over your heart and pump
                    those hips.

      INT. BLUE NOTE CLUB - DAY - ON SAM AND GIRLS

      They are dressed in rehearsal clothes and standing three
      across with Sam out front leading them through the moves.

                                  SAM
                    Then on 'itchin' in my heart,
                    fists clenched over your heart...

      WIDER TO REVEAL AL

      He dances a few feet ahead of them. A waiter passes by.

                                  OBSERVER
                          (to waiter)
                    Hey, watch where you're going!
                          (to Sam)
                    Pump those hips. Then rip and open
                    and shoulder, shoulder.

                                  SAM
                    Keep the hip action. 'Tearin' it
                    all apart'. Then tear and open
                    your hands like this and shoulder,
                      shoulder...

                                  PAULA
                    Show me that shoulder thing again.

      NEW ANGLE

      Sam steps back and does the whole sequence again slowly 
      with Lynell and Paula.

                                  SAM
                    Then when we say, 'It's like a
                    heat wave', both hands go up...

                                  OBSERVER
                    ...and shimmy down your body, real
                    sexy and sensual...

      Al is getting off on his choreography. Sam shoots him a       look as if to say, 'Cool off'.

                                  OBSERVER
                              (continuing)
                    Okay, okay, a little sexy.

      Sam repeats the look and they put all the moves together.

                                  LYNELL
                    Okay, let's try it with the words.
                    Take it from the chorus.

      ANOTHER ANGLE - FEATURING BOBBY LEE

      He sits at one of the cocktail tables watching Lynell, with
      a look of a cat about to pounce on a canary. Rainy Gregoir,
      the musical director, comes to the table and shows Bobby 
      the charts. He's a fair-skinned Creole with glasses and 
      mussed hair.

                                  RAINY
                    These charts are so hot I hope to
                    hell your girls can handle them.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Lynell will do fine and that's all
                    that matters to me.
                            (calling out to Sam)
                    Cheree. Rainy's made a pass on the
                    chord sheet. You want to take a
                    look at it.

      He says something to Bobby and Bobby gestures him toward 
      the stage.

      WIDER ON AL

      Sam stops the rehearsal.

                                  SAM
                      Uh...Okay.

                                  OBSERVER
                    Say 'Let's take five!'.                                  SAM
                    Take five everybody.
                            (aside to Al)
                    I forget, can I read music?

                                  OBSERVER
                    You have a doctorate in it

                                  SAM
                    Oh. Good.

      Sam and Rainy meet by the first row of tables. Sam and Al
      study the chart while Lynell looks on. Paula slips into the
      wings and after a beat something catches Lynell's eye.

      NEW ANGLE

      We see Bobby crook a finger to Lynell. She smiles and looks
      around then slips over to talk to him.

      CLOSE ON BOBBY AND LYNELL

      He leads her off into a shadowy corner of the club where 
      they can talk privately.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    You ladies are going to be
                      fantastic.

                                  LYNELL
                    There's so much to do and it's
                    already one o'clock.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    You'll be perfect.
                            (pulling her away)
                    Come here, I want to show you
                      something.

      INT. BACKSTAGE WINGS - ON LYNELL AND BOBBY

      He takes her into the dimly lit corridor that leads to the
      dressing rooms. Lynell is uncomfortable and hesitant.

                                  LYNELL
                    Where are we going?                                  BOBBY LEE
                    I have a little surprise for you.

      He stops at a wardrobe rack and pulls back a sheet to
      reveal...

      NEW ANGLE - FEATURING THREE SEQUIN GOWNS

      Even in the dim light they sparkle and shine almost as much
      as Lynell's eyes.

                                  LYNELL
                    Oh Bobby, they're beautiful!

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    I had them made for a girls group
                    I was puttin' together
                      but...things didn't work out.
                            (beat)
                    I want you girls to wear them
                    tonight.

                                  LYNELL
                            (thrilled)
                    Oh, Bobby!

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Now they're just on loan until
                    you're under contract and start
                    earning some real money. Then you
                    can pay me back.

                                  LYNELL
                    I...I don't know what to say.

      CLOSE ON BOBBY AND LYNELL

      He smiles as he runs his fingers down her neck. She is 
      caught in his eyes. Slowly his face moves toward hers.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Darlin' you don't have to say a
                    thing.

      He kisses her passionately, pulling her body into his and
      taking her breath away. There is a moment of resistance but
      she doesn't have a chance. As the kiss intensifies, we...                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. STAGE - ON SAM, AL AND RAINY

      They finish up some minor changes.

                                  SAM
                    Then vamp for twelve bars and
                    punch the end.

                                  OBSERVER
                    Oh, tell him if there's a big
                    applause, be ready to come back in.

                                  SAM
                    If we've got the crowd, be ready
                    to go back in at the coda.

                                  RAINY
                    Smokin'.
                            (beat)
                    You ladies pull this one off,
                    ain't nobody to stop you.

                                  SAM
                    That's what I'm countin' on.

      Rainy smiles and walks off leaving Sam and Al. After a 
      beat, Paula walks back on from the other side of stage.

                                  PAULA
                      Everything together?

                                  SAM
                    I don't know about everything but
                    the charts are...smokin'.

      Sam is so proud of himself for being hip. Al just rolls his
      eyes.

                                  PAULA
                    Well, we better get our chocolate
                    behinds in motion of we're gonna
                    look like a bunch of amateurs from
                    the boonies.                                  SAM
                    You got it.

                                  OBSERVER
                    Where's Lynell?

                                  SAM
                    Yeah, where's Lynell?
                            (calling out)
                    Lynell! Lynell!

      There's no answer. Al punches up the computer.

                                  OBSERVER
                    I'll center in on her and give you
                    a holler.

      He pops out.

      INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY - ON BOBBY AND LYNELL - CONTINUOUS

      She struggles in his embrace. Her blouse pulled up, her 
      small arms pushed against him. Al pops in.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Come on, baby. Just relax.

                                  LYNELL
                    Bobby, please. Please, stop.

      INT. STAGE - FEATURING BOBBY, LYNELL AND AL - SFX

      Bobby is getting more aggressive. He pins her to the wall 
      and kisses her. By now she is a frightened little girl in 
      tears. Al grabs through them trying to defend Lynell.                                  LYNELL
                    You're hurting me!

                                  OBSERVER
                    Sam!
                          (to Bobby)
                    Take your hands off of her, you
                    slime!

      Sam rounds the corner and in a flash, assessing the
      situation, pulling Bobby away from her. Bobby pushes Sam 
      away and out of reflex, Sam slugs him, knocking him to the 
      ground at Paula's feet. She looks from a very pissed Bobby 
      to Sam.

                                  PAULA
                    Damn.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                            (getting up)
                    Don't you ever lay a hand on me,
                    bitch!

                                  SAM
                    Then keep your hands off...

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    I wasn't doin' nothin' she didn't
                    want.

                                  LYNELL
                    You...you were hurting me.

                    As far as I'm concerned you can

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Hurtin' you? You don't know the
                    meaning of the word.

                                  SAM
                    She doesn't have to learn it from
                    you.                                  BOBBY LEE

                                  SAM
                    We don't need you or your club.

                                  LYNELL
                    Cheree!

      FEATURING LYNELL

      She is torn and frightened. She looks back from Sam to 
      Bobby Lee. Her young life and all its dreams are falling 
      apart in front of her.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    You better apologize.

                                  LYNELL

                    We don't need him.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Then leave.
                          (to Lynell)
                    You want to to perform tonight,
                    you be here with my apology or
                    forget it.

      With that he exits rubbing his sore jaw.

      NEW ANGLE - ON ALL

      Lynell is freaking.

                    get the man from the record
                    company to...

                                  LYNELL
                    To do what? Come see us perform in

                    Now either you apologize with me
                    or I'm going on by myself.

      Lynell storms off. Paula looks after her and throws up her
      hands.

                    and she still ends up alone. But
                    this time she's completely alone.
                            (beat)
                    She never speaks to Cheree and
                    Paula again.

      Now he's ruined everything. Off of his stunned expression
      we...

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. CHURCH - EVENING - FEATURING REVEREND WALTERS

      He moves through the front pew straightening bibles and 
      stops frozen in thought. He sits, tired and confused and 
      stares up at the stain-glass window. After a beat his eyes 
      close in prayer and he talks to the heavens.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                            (sigh)
                    Oh, Sylvia. Some days I miss you
                    so much.
                            (beat)
                    The way you laughed. The sound of
                    your footsteps at night. The smell
                    of your hair on my pillow. But you
                    know what I miss most of
                      all...your wisdom.
                            (small smile)
                    You always knew just the right
                    thing to say to Lynell.

      WIDER ANGLE TO INCLUDE SAM

      He stands near the back of the church, listening. He walks
      slowly toward the Reverend.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                              (continuing)
                    She won't listen to me you know.
                    Lord help her. That child's got so
                    much anger locked inside her.
                            (beat)
                    See, I used to think she was mad
                    at you for dying and me for
                    letting you, but Lynell...

                                  SAM
                    Lynell's mad at herself, Reverend.

      Reverend Walters turns to see Sam. After a long beat he 
      turns back toward the window but speaks to Sam.                                  REV. WALTERS
                    I never should have let her take
                    care of her momma. She was too
                    young to see that kind of pain.

                                  SAM
                    My mom used to say, God only gives
                    us what he knows we can handle.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    She blames me.

                                  SAM
                    She's hurt and angry.

      NEW ANGLE

      Sam sits down next to him.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    I've lost her.

                                  SAM
                    Not yet.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    If I try to hold her she'll run
                    away.

                                  SAM
                    Like your wife did?

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Sylvia was very sick for a long
                    time. She stopped seeing her
                    friends and locked herself away
                    from everybody.
                            (beat)
                    When she found out she was dying,
                    she tried to run away from me.

                                  SAM
                    Lynell told me you stopped them.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Them? She didn't take Lynell.                                  SAM
                    But Lynell said...

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    That's what Lynell needed to
                    believe.
                            (beat)
                    After Sylvia left, Lynell cried
                    for weeks. I finally found her
                    mother in a hotel and brought her
                    home.
                            (beat)
                    Lynell wouldn't leave her side
                    until they took her away.
                            (beat)
                    She has a right to be angry. I
                    left them there to face death,
                    while I went and hid in my church.
                            (beat)
                    And now, I've lost my little girl.

                                  SAM
                    Not if you stand by her.
                            (beat)
                    Tell her you want her to sing
                    tonight. And you want to be there
                    to hear it.

      NEW ANGLE

      Reverend Walters looks at Sam. For a moment it looks as
      though he's going to bend.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    I can't. I want her to finish
                    school. Be someone.

                                  SAM
                    Trust her to find her own reasons
                    to finish school. Make her own
                    choices.

      Reverend Walters stands, he is weary and adamant with his
      decision.                                  REV. WALTERS
                    She's fifteen. She has plenty of
                    time to make her own choices.
                    Right now she has to live by mine.

      With that he walks to the back of the church and finishes
      gathering the bibles.

                                  OBSERVER'S VOICE
                    Now what?

      FEATURING SAM AND AL

      Al stands next to Sam. They watch Reverend Walters.

                                  OBSERVER
                    Ziggy says there's a seventy
                    percent chance that Lynell goes
                    back to the club and... apologizes
                    to the slime bucket.

                                  SAM
                    So, she goes on tonight?

                                  OBSERVER
                    Alone.

                    But she doesn't win. That's what
                    really makes her desperate.

                                  SAM
                    What about the man from Checker
                    Records?

                                  OBSERVER
                    I guess he never shows up.
                            (beat)
                    Sam you've got to stop Lynell.
                    That pervert's gonna destroy her...

                                  SAM
                    Not if I can help it.

      Sam is on his feet and heading out of the church.                                  OBSERVER
                    She's at her house. I'm going to
                    check on Mr. Sleazoid.

      Al pops out as Sam disappears out the back door of the
      church, as we...

                                                                              CUT TO:

      EXT. WALTERS HOME - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

      The Chicago hawk whips at the barren branches of the front
      tree.

                                  PAULA
                    Why are you doing this?

      INT. LYNELL'S ROOM - CLOSE ON LYNELL

      She sits at her vanity applying makeup. The lipstick is too
      red, the shadow too heavy and the dress is too revealing.

                                  LYNELL
                    Doing what?

                                  PAULA
                    Don't go playin' stupid with me
                    girl. You're gonna go give it up
                    to that creep, so you can sing
                    tonight.

                                  LYNELL
                    I'm not gonna give up nothin'. I'm
                    gonna apologize so that 'we' can
                    sing.

                                  PAULA
                    Don't use me as an excuse. You
                    want to lay down for that old man,
                    do it cause you want to, not for
                    me and Cheree.

      Lynell stops putting on makeup and turns to Paula.                                  LYNELL
                    Bobby's just mad at Cheree. I'll
                    tell him I'm sorry and everything
                    will be fine.

                                  PAULA
                    But you shouldn't be sorry. Or
                    have your forgotten what he tried
                    to do?

                                  LYNELL
                    I just wasn't ready for what he
                    wanted.

                                  PAULA
                    Are you ready now? 'Cause if you
                    go in there talkin' a bunch of I'm
                    sorry, he's gonna be all over you.

      FEATURE LYNELL - MIRROR SHOT

      She looks at herself and tries to be brave.

                                  LYNELL
                    I'm only fifteen...

                                  PAULA
                    So! To men like Bobby Lee that's
                    woman enough.

                                  LYNELL
                    You're wrong.

      Cheree steps into the mirror behind her.

                                  CHEREE/SAM'S VOICE
                    No, she's not.

      NEW ANGLE - INCLUDING SAM

      He stands in the doorway. After a beat he crosses over and
      sits on the edge of the bed next to Paula.

                                  LYNELL
                    Oh, don't you start too. Bobby's
                      a business man who wants to help
                                  (MORE)                                  LYNELL (CONT'D)
                    us and y'all are talking about him
                    like he's dog.

                                  PAULA
                    If the name fits...

                                  SAM
                    Some men believe they should have
                      everything they want and they
                    don't care who they hurt to get it.

                                  LYNELL
                    But Bobby's not like that.

                                  SAM
                    Yes, he is.

                                  LYNELL
                    He respects my talent.

                                  SAM
                    I respect your talent but I'm not
                    going to seduce you to prove it.

                                  LYNELL
                            (with a giggle)
                    You're a girl.

                                  SAM
                    You know what I mean.
                            (beat)
                    You can't go to Bobby Lee by
                    yourself.

                                  LYNELL
                    I will if I have to.

                                  SAM
                            (getting an idea)
                    You can't go by yourself...but you
                    can go with us.

      Lynell gets up and crosses to Sam and Paula.

                                  LYNELL
                    You'll come with me?                                  PAULA
                            (after a beat)
                    You gonna apologize to that fool?

                                  SAM
                    I'll do whatever Lynell needs me
                    to do.

      Sam is heading out the door. A stunned Lynell and Paula 
      look on.

                                  SAM
                              (continuing)
                    Well, don't just stand there.
                    We've got ourselves a contest to
                    win.

      He's out the door. Paula and Lynell squeal and hug, then 
      bolt out the door as we...

      He stands adjusting his tie and admiring himself in the

                    Mr. Lee, The Lovettes are here.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                            (smug smile)
                    Well, we knew that.

                            (mimicking him)
                    Well, we knew that.
                          (to himself)
                    Sam, I hope you know what you're
                    doing.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Give them the pink sequins to skip
                    into and then bring them to me.
                            (back to the mirror)
                    I want them gorgeous when they
                    crawl.

      JoJo pads off in double time. Al all but growls and Bobby
      just gloats.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Mr. Lee? May I have a word with
                    you?

                                  OBSERVER
                            (looking up)
                    Uh oh. Gooshie center me on Sam.

      With that and a punch of the handlink he pops out.

      NEW ANGLE

      Reverend Walters stands with his hat in his hand. If it's
      possible Bobby's smug smile gets smugger.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Well, well, well.
                            (beat)
                    You know Reverend, you said some
                    pretty harsh words to me at your
                    home yesterday and...                                  REV. WALTERS
                            (cutting him off)
                    What I said to you yesterday had
                    nothing to do with why I'm here.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    And why is that?

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    My daughter wants very much to
                    sing in your contest.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    That's up to her.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    It's up to you too. And I want you
                    to tell her no.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                            (surprised)
                    Now why would I do that?

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Because she's fifteen years old.
                    Let her grow up.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                            (calmly)
                    No, you let her grow up.
                            (beat)
                    I see kids in and outta here, year
                    after year. Lynell's got the gift.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    She'll still have it three years
                    from now. But she'll be able to
                    handle herself.
                            (beat)
                    I'm asking you as a father to help
                    me.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    What's in it for me?                                  REV. WALTERS
                    I...I'll make a deal with
                    you...you get my daughter out of
                    here and I won't call the police
                    and tell them you've got minors in
                    your club

                                  LYNELL'S VOICE
                    I don't need you to make a deal
                    for me.

      NEW ANGLE - INCLUDING SAM, LYNELL, PAULA AND JOJO

      They are visions in hot pink sequins. Bobby is pleased.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Then come home.

                                  LYNELL
                    I can't.

                                  JOJO
                    The Lovettes are on next, Bobby.
                    What do you want me to do?

                                  BOBBY LEE
                          (to Sam)
                    I'm waiting.

                                  OBSERVER
                    Don't say it Sam.

                                  SAM
                    We want to sing in your club
                    tonight.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    And when you win, you sign a seven
                    year contract with me.

                                  SAM
                    If that's what Lynell wants.

                                  PAULA
                    Cheree!                                  REV. WALTERS
                    I can't let you do this, Lynell.

                                  SAM
                    It's Lynell's life. She's got to
                    decide what's important.

                                  LYNELL
                    I...I want to sing. Please Daddy.
                    Please understand.

      Sam crosses next to Reverend Walters.

                                  SAM
                          (to Reverend Walters)
                    Tell your daughter you love her,
                    Reverend Walters. Tell her that
                    you trust her enough to stand by
                    her, whatever decision she makes.

      The reprise is done and the audience is chanting for the 
      next act. The Reverend looks desperately to Lynell.

                                  JOJO
                    They're going crazy out there. You
                    want me to get the next act?

                                  LYNELL
                          (to her father)
                    Daddy, I...

      She's a frightened little girl. The crowd chants louder.

      NEW ANGLE - FEATURING REVEREND WALTERS AND LYNELL

      He crosses to her and holds her face as if she's touched by
      a spirit. Lynell looks at her father. He smiles.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Sing Lynell. Sing with all your
                    soul.
                            (beat)
                    I love you.

      She smiles and hugs her father.      WIDER - INCLUDING ALL

        A triumphant Bobby turns to face him.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                          (to Lynell)
                    Win this and I'll take you to the
                    top.

                    Win for me, baby.

                            (with new strength)
                    I'll win for me, Bobby. Me.

      ON STAGE - FEATURING BOBBY

      He is a master MC. He has this crowd eating out of his 
      hand.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Alright! Are you feelin' good?

                                  THE CROWD
                    Yeah!

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    I can't hear you! I said, are you

                    YEAH!

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Then put your hands together and
                    get ready to stand up and party
                    with the lovely, the vivacious,
                    the fabulous...Lovettes!

      The band kicks into a funky groove of "Heat Wave".

      BACKSTAGE - ALL

      Lynell looks to her father. His face is hard and cold and
      then as if he is touched by a spirit, he crosses to Lynell
      and touches her. He smiles.                                  REV. WALTERS
                    Sing Lynell. Sing with all your
                    soul.
                            (beat)
                    I love you.

      She smiles and hugs her father, then races out on stage. 
      Sam and Al exchange a look of triumph.

                                  OBSERVER
                    Alright!

      ON STAGE

      INTERCUT WITH BACKSTAGE - REVEREND WALTERS

      He watches his daughter with pride and love.

      ON BOBBY LEE

      looking like the cat that ate the canary and loving every
      minute of it.

      THE CROWD

      totally into it and having a party.

      ON AL

      Mister Soul himself in a total groove.

      ON STAGE - SAM AND THE LOVETTES

      having a great time. They are tight and together.

      ON BOBBY LEE

      A man in a silk suit whispers in his ear. Bobby's smile 
      gets bigger. He turns back to Lynell with dollar signs in 
      his eyes.      CLOSE ON LYNELL

      She is singing her ass off.

      WIDER ANGLE

      The song ends to wild applause. They run off the stage.

      BACKSTAGE - FEATURING BOBBY

      He sweeps Lynell into his arms.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Y'all did it. You are going to the
                    Regal.

      Paula screams. Sam looks at Lynell who hugs Bobby. Reverend 
      Walters watches the excitement and then fades back, 
      slipping out the door. The crowd shouts for more.

                                  PAULA
                    We did it! We did it!

      ON SAM AND AL

      Sam is caught up in the excitement. Al sees the Reverend
      leave and nods to Sam.

                                  OBSERVER
                    Sam.

      ON REVEREND WALTERS

      He slips out the side door.

      WIDER ANGLE - ON ALL

      Sam starts to go after him when Bobby sweeps Lynell into 
      his arms. She struggles to get free, looking for her 
      father.

                                  LYNELL
                    Where's my father?                                  BOBBY LEE
                    Who cares? All that matters now is
                    that I'm gonna make you a star.
                    You belong to me, baby.

                                  LYNELL
                    I don't belong to anybody.

                                  BOBBY LEE
                    We had a deal.

                                  SAM
                    No deal.

      Sam jerks him off Lynell and slams him against the wall. 
      He's about to punch him out when Paula grabs his arm 
      pulling him and Lynell back on stage for the reprise. The 
      crowd goes crazy and Lynell soars, giving a grateful smile 
      to Sam.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

      It's dimly lit and hangs in the silence of loss. Reverend
      Walters sits next to his pulpit, an empty man. Sam walks up
      to him with Al close behind. Sam has changed out of his 
      gown.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    I've lost her forever.

                                  SAM
                    A profit named Gibran once said
                    'Hold your children with open arms
                    and they will always know they can
                    come home.'

                                  REV. WALTERS
                            (shaking his head)
                    Too much sorrow has gone between
                    us. I don't think she can ever
                    forgive me for loving her the only
                    way I knew how.
                            (beat)
                    I'll miss her, Cheree.

                    I'll miss
                    that I'll never hear her sing
                    again.

      Lynell's voice fills the church and echo the strains of 
      "Eye on the Sparrow". Sam and the Reverend turn. Tears fill 
      the Reverend's eyes as he moves toward her.

      NEW ANGLE - She stands in her gown, backlit by a wash of
      light from the entry and singing with the passion of an 
      angel.

                            (song to come)

      NEW ANGLE - ON SAM AND AL

      They look on like proud parents who've done a good thing. 
      Al reads the handlink.

                                  OBSERVER
                    She turned down the Regal, the
                      contracts, the whole kit and
                    caboodle and stays at her father's
                    church.

                    money to get through medical
                    school. She becomes a doctor, Sam.
                    Gets married and has three kids.

      ON LYNELL AND HER FATHER

      She finishes her song and touches his face. Her eyes well
      with tears.

                                  LYNELL
                    I love you, Daddy.

                                  REV. WALTERS
                    I love you too.

      They embrace. Paula stands in the b.g. watching, happy for
      her friend.      INCLUDING SAM AND AL

      They smile. With a small good-bye he's enveloped by a flash
