Max speaks to someone O.S.
MAX
..."What about Beth?"
Max is talking to Beth. It's a beautiful Spring day.
8.
MAX (CONT'D)
I mean, I know we're just friends, but
you really mean a lot to me and we've
been spending a lot of time together
lately, and maybe... I guess what I'm
saying is, maybe we could try going out
on a date or something?
BETH
Max...
MAX
I mean, it wouldn't have to be, uh...
BETH
Sure.
MAX
We wouldn't have to... What?
BETH
I'd love to. How's tomorrow night?
MAX
Um, yeah, it would have to be after, or
maybe... Yeah, tomorrow, uh, tomorrow
night's fine.
BETH
Great. I know the perfect thing.
She splits, leaving Max befuddled at his change of fortune.
Max and Beth are walking through the night in overcoats.
BETH
Never?
MAX
Not until Sam and Jen.
BETH
A perfect record. Wow.
MAX
I don't get what the fuss is. I knew you
and that Chris guy wouldn't last a week
as soon as I saw you together.
BETH
But you can tell with everybody? I don't
know if that's sad or incredible.
9.
MAX
Or incredibly sad. I'm amazed I'm the
only one who can tell. Take any couple.
If it's not incompatible lifestyles, it's
conflicting priorities. If it's not that,
it's usually clashing levels of self-
esteem. It's always something.
BETH
Living with you would be a nightmare. I'd
be afraid to bring any boyfriends home.
Oh, uh, sorry.
Awkward pause.
MAX
Well, just because I see it, doesn't mean
I talk about it. I don't say a word to my
suitemates.
BETH
You guys never talk about anything
important anyway.
MAX
Oh, come on, we have philosophical
discussions all the time.
BETH
Like whether Voltron could kill the
Transformers?
MAX
To name one hot-button issue, yes. You
want us to talk about girls? Sam is
nearly married to Jen, Charles doesn't
want his relationships to last, Tommy's
girlfriends are located in online
chatrooms across the country, and Scott,
well... you know.
BETH
For such "close" friends, it just seems
weird, that's all. I must admit, I'm a
lot closer to you than any of them.
They are at the Library.
MAX
What are doing here?
10.
Max and Beth leave the library. Their dispositions have
switched: Max is perky while Beth is subdued.
MAX
I can't believe how many great lines
there are. Even the little throwaways,
like when she parks and he's like,
"That's okay, we can walk to the curb
from here."
BETH
Yeah. I loved it, I'm serious. I'm so
glad we did this.
MAX
Yeah, me too.
BETH
But man, relationships are a lot of work,
aren't they?
MAX
Uh, sure, sometimes...
Beth stops him, and they sit on a bench. The night is cold.
They sit close and lean in, speaking in hushed tones.
12.
BETH
If I'm going to jump into anything with
you, Max, I need some sign that you're
serious about it. About me.
MAX
What? You want me to get a tattoo or
something?
BETH
Look, you've gotta admit, you're the most
pessimistic person in the world.
MAX
Obviously you've never met my mother.
BETH
Can you be serious for a second?
MAX
I guess you really haven't met my mother...
Beth isn't laughing.
BETH
Look, Max, this isn't going to work.
MAX
Wait a second.
BETH
Okay. No more jokes. Now. Tell me how you
feel.
MAX
About what?
BETH
About me.
MAX
I, I...
(EXASPERATED)
Why are you doing this? Since when have
you gotten "serious" about relationships?
Your last boyfriend dumped you after four
days.
Beth sits up, pulls her jacket closed.
BETH
Well, that was intimate. Thanks, Max.
13.
MAX
No wait, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, hold on.
BETH
Max, I don't think this is such a good
idea. I mean, it would be really foolish
to jeopardize our friendship.
MAX
No, it wouldn't!
BETH
We shouldn't have rushed into this. I'm
sure you know it wouldn't have worked
out.
MAX
I don't know that.
BETH
Please tell me we haven't hurt our
friendship. You don't even know how much
you mean to me.
MAX
I'm starting to get the idea.
He's dazed, slightly ill. Beth touches his arm gently and
walks away. Max turns to us. A radio mike swings into view.
MAX (CONT'D)
Things weren't the same after. We quickly
became the kind of friends who say Hi on
the paths but don't stop walking. Then,
she moved across campus and changed
majors, and basically, except for the
random phone call, I haven't seen her in
ages.
DISSOLVE TO:
MAX, thoughtful. PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
It's late January and the campus is showing signs of a
temperamental winter.
MAX (V.O.)
This morning, we were skipping class.
Max and Charles walk across the quad towards us. At first,
they are only specks in the distance.
CHARLES
Max, you're insane.
MAX
It's ridiculous that even at a liberal
school like this, I have to put up with
anti-Semitism.
CHARLES
So you got a C minus! Don't you think
you're getting carried away?
MAX
He couldn't just fail me, think about it.
The paper was about my grandparents'
experience in the Holocaust.
CHARLES
Your paranoia has always been out of
control, but this is absurd.
MAX
You don't understand, you're not Jewish.
CHARLES
Neither are you!
MAX
But the professor probably thinks I am.
CHARLES
And wasn't that the paper that you handed
in two weeks late?
MAX
You know what else? I think he might be
German.
CHARLES
Professor Wang? Will you stop it...
We can now see that Charles has a fedora cocked back on his
head, and is wearing incongruous "Vegas" clothes.
15.
They walk past and into the University Center.
Sara sleeps on a couch. Charles, wearing only boxers, hung
over and mostly asleep, passes through the living room. He
stubs his toe and crashes into the wall.
CHARLES
Ow! Shit! Ow!
He continues into the bathroom. Sara wakes up and looks
around groggily. A FLUSH. Charles walks out of the bathroom
and blinks at Sara with surprise.
CHARLES (CONT'D)
Jeeezzus! Shit, sorry you um...
SARA
It's all right, this isn't the first time
this has happened. At least this time I'm
not the naked one.
CHARLES
It's just that, I mean, I'm just
surprised to see you here.
SARA
Hmm, yeah, I must have shown up after you
came back, or something. I was planning
to go home, but I guess I fell asleep.
She waits for something from Charles. He doesn't respond. She
reluctantly gets to her feet.
SARA (CONT'D)
Anyway, I, uh, I've got a bunch of stuff
to do. I'll see you later.
CHARLES
Bye.
28.
As she leaves, Max comes in, still in last night's clothes.
MAX
You all right?
CHARLES
She's around all the time! I chose to
live with my hombres, not her. She's got
to realize that we're not right for each
other and get on with her life.
MAX
No, I mean, I thought I heard you fall or
something.
CHARLES
Oh, what? I just stubbed my toe.
MAX
That sucks. Bad way to start the day.
CHARLES
The toe's the least of it.
MAX
This is funny, in a way. Yesterday you
were complaining about not having any
girls. Now you're complaining because you
have one.
CHARLES
I know. It's a shame. And I was attracted
to her once, too. What happened?
MAX
Want me to tell you?
CHARLES
No! I think I've heard enough from the
Nostradamus of failed relationships to
last a lifetime.
MAX
Speaking of failed relationships, I was
thinking about your Annie Hall theory.
Specifically, I was thinking that you're
insane.
CHARLES
I said I was joking, so why do you keep
bringing it up?
29.
MAX
It's like you insulted my religion. Like,
"Hey, Cardinal, I think Jesus might be
why you're not getting laid..."
CHARLES
Your attitude's too dour. You've gotta be
more fun.
MAX
It's not my fault Annie Hall's honest
about the futility of romance.
CHARLES
You're just a wuss. The very thought of
not seeing that movie scares you. You're
like a junkie, you need movie methadone.
Like, from now on you can only see
Manhattan.
MAX
Forget it, I hate Manhattan.
CHARLES
You think addicts like Methadone?
MAX
My Uncle Harry didn't seem to mind.
CHARLES
So what are we doing for lunch?
Scott enters.
SCOTT
You mean breakfast.
MAX
Actually, I'm supposed to eat with Beth.
He doesn't look excited at the prospect, but Charles does.
CHARLES
Beth? Wow. She hasn't been around in
ages. Say hi for me.
Max walks with Beth down the city street. She carries an
umbrella and scans the skies.
BETH
Wasn't it supposed to rain?
30.
MAX
I dunno.
BETH
Max, it's been ten minutes and we're
still discussing the weather.
MAX
So? Think of all the people who've died
in hurricanes. I bet they think it's a
worthy issue.
BETH
I just feel like there are other things
we could be talking about. You're the one
person I could rely on to say something
original.
MAX
Okay, okay.
(BEAT)
So, what classes are you taking?
BETH
This was a mistake, wasn't it?
MAX
What? No.
They stop in front of Frannie's, a small greasy spoon.
BETH
Look, let's just call it a day. I was
excited to hear from you, but I can't
take you like this.
A COUPLE exit, the guy holds the door for them. They
hesitate. Suddenly, from inside:
CHARLES (O.S.)
Max! Beth! Come sit with us!
MAX
No, I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. To
be honest, it's nice being with someone
besides my suitemates for a change.
They look in and see...
Max walks down the street toward an ATM, where a long line of
college students has formed. Next to the ATM is an arthouse
theater. The marquee reads "Thru Valentine's Day: ANNIE HALL
and CASABLANCA."
He joins the ATM line. A moment later, Julie walks by. She
notices him and stops.
JULIE
Hi. Look at this line.
33.
MAX
Oh, hey. Yeah, I hate coming here this
time of day, but I need money. You know,
gambling debts and all.
JULIE
Aren't ATMs great? They save so much
time. Think about what life must have
been like before them.
MAX
I can't support an acronym without
knowing what it stands for. I once joined
NAMBLA because I thought it was an animal
rights group.
She laughs.
MAX (CONT'D)
So, are you a junior, too?
JULIE
I'm listed as a sophomore, but I've taken
some time off.
MAX
What're you majoring in?
JULIE
Why is that always the first question?
MAX
It was my second question.
JULIE
And how would you answer it?
MAX
I'd be honest. Oh, wait. Media Studies.
This week, I'm majoring in Media Studies.
I used to be a double-major, Renaissance
Footwear and Neurosurgery, but, ya know,
it was just too hard to get course credit
for watching movies.
JULIE
I bet. Me, I'm in Soc., but I'm leaning
toward Business, or Psych. Or Art
History.
MAX
Why don't you just be undeclared?
34.
JULIE
Not my style.
Max's turn-- but he spots ANNIE HALL on the marquee.
Impulsively, he turns Julie to face him, so that her back is
to it. In doing so, he steps away from the ATM.
JULIE (CONT'D)
Are you okay? I thought you needed money.
MAX
Uh, I forgot, my bookie takes checks now.
JULIE
Seriously, is everything okay?
MAX
Actually, yes. But I need something from
you.
JULIE
What?
MAX
Your name.
JULIE
It's Julie, no nickname. Don't even think
of calling me "Jewel."
MAX
Okay, Julie with no nickname, I, um, I'll
see you around?
JULIE
Probably.
She leaves. Max goes back to the end of the line.
Max shakes a tumbler as Amanda keeps time.
AMANDA
Tired yet?
MAX
This is ridiculous. What other art form
involves industrial toxins and complex
chemical reactions? Nobody ever got
cancer from dancing.
AMANDA
You're so paranoid.
MAX
I'm serious. Chemicals make me very
nervous. Isn't this how the Unabomber got
started?
He continues shaking.
AMANDA
Max, do I bother Scott when I'm around?
MAX
Uh, boy, this fixer smells delicious...
AMANDA
`Cuz, sometimes it seems like I do. I
know he's not, like, interested, but
then, sometimes it seems like he is. I
just don't want it to be awkward. Please,
tell me the truth.
MAX
I, uh, I mean, the truth is, it's not a
topic. It doesn't bother him, or us. Or I
mean, he doesn't talk about it.
AMANDA
So he never talks about me?
MAX
Yes, I mean, no, not with us, anyway.
39.
AMANDA
I knew it.
MAX
Listen. All I'm trying to say is, you're
not a topic that comes up very often.
AMANDA
So with all the time we spend together,
none of you have any opinion of me?!
Amanda storms out of the room.
MAX
Well, that's not... what I meant. Oy.
Amanda returns, still upset.
AMANDA
It's time! To unroll the film.
Max, startled, fumbles open the tumbler.
MAX
Listen, Amanda. Scott likes you as much
as we all do, so it doesn't leave much
room for discussion. We mostly only talk
about what we hate.
AMANDA
I know. It's just sometimes, I wish...
MAX
Yeah, I know.
Amanda takes the negatives, opens the door to a closet, hangs
them from a clothespin, and leaves. Max takes his, selects a
clothespin, and knocks several others to the floor. He tries
to pick them up, and manages to step on them.
AMANDA (O.S.)
Max? Are you coming?
He throws the crumpled negatives in the closet and grabs his
bag. At the door, he notices one stuck to his shoe.
MAX
Shit!
He takes the negative off his shoe, almost knocking himself
over, and hurries out.
40.
AMANDA (O.S.)
Why does it always take you so long in
there?
Max and Julie approach Shelly Hall.
MAX
So you live here, huh? Does it bother you
to be in an all-female dorm?
JULIE
No, well, a little, sure. But there are
always men around. During fire drills,
more guys come out than girls. Never the
same ones either. They come and go.
MAX
I bet they do.
Julie catches herself and laughs. Max shares a smile with her
in the doorway.
JULIE
I had a good time tonight, but next time,
let's have some real fun.
MAX
Oh, fine, uh, next time I'll bring Jack
Nicholson and a case of Schnapps.
JULIE
Good night, Max.
Julie enters the dorm. Max watches her through the glass.
CUT TO:
TITLE CARD: white on black: "WEDNESDAY"
MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE UP of a schedule's column heading: "Wednesday"
PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
52.
A shitbox pulls up. Sam drives, Max rides shotgun. Scott and
Amanda are in back.
AMANDA
And then I got to thinking, you know, I
really think I like vanilla.
Sam turns off the car.
SAM
I'll be right back.
MAX
Me too.
They get out and go into the store.
The car pulls up.
SAM
I'll be right back.
MAX
Me too.
They leave.
Amanda and Scott are alone in the back. Amanda looks tense.
AMANDA
Scott, can I ask you something?
SCOTT
Okay.
AMANDA
It's just that, sometimes, you're really
cool and other times you act like I'm not
even here. Or like you don't want me
around.
SCOTT
Yeah.
AMANDA
Well, I was wondering if... never mind.
SCOTT
Okay.
A moment passes.
AMANDA
All right, look, I'm just going to come
right out with it. I think I like you. I
think I, I really like you.
SCOTT
I know.
As she opens her mouth, Scott opens the car door and exits.
57.
Max, distressed, passes the campus theater, where someone is
tacking up a poster for Annie Hall. Max sees it and averts
his eyes.
He walks past the Kidney Bean. Something catches his eye
through the window. He changes direction and enters.
Outside, Max beats himself in the forehead several times.
Then, a picture of misery, he trudges off--
Passes by Julie's dorm again.
Eventually finds himself approaching the University Center.
76.
Max plays video hockey. Charles comes in.
CHARLES
Studying for a test?
MAX
You shouldn't talk, theater major.
CHARLES
Hey, I have a test on lighting next week
that'll make your hair go grey.
He sprawls on the couch.
77.
CHARLES (CONT'D)
Thanks for bailing on me last night. I
had to hear Sara gab for an hour.
MAX
Why didn't you just leave? At least you
can escape your problems.
CHARLES
What do you mean?
MAX
I just got my textbooks for this term.
Max holds up a thick book, Post-Modern Semiology. The entire
cover is a still from Annie Hall.
CHARLES
Holy shit.
MAX
When the gods give you a sign like that,
there's only one thing to do.
He passes a controller to Charles and they play.
CHARLES
By the way, I saw Julie last night.
MAX
Was she alone?
CHARLES
Not if you count this huge purse she had.
She was rummaging through it and finally
had to dump the thing out. I swear, I'm
surprised Kennedy's brain didn't fall out
of that thing. Anyway, it made me think
of Annie Hall.
MAX
Oh, great.
CHARLES
Although Julie dresses better.
Max slowly lowers his controller.
MAX
What are you saying, I like her because
she's like Annie Hall?
CHARLES
I didn't say that.
78.
MAX
Oh my God, I think you're right.
CHARLES
I didn't say that.
MAX
I don't want to like someone because she
reminds me of someone in a movie. Now I'm
wondering why I like her. Maybe I don't.
CHARLES
Good Lord, Max. Take some harder classes.
Sam returns, sees what they are playing.
SAM
Look at you two. Wouldn't something else
be fun for a change? How about Goldeneye?
CHARLES
Great game.
MAX
No. I don't know how to play it.
SAM
Lucky for you, I actually have time to
teach you. Normally I would be having
lunch with Jen.
MAX
Oh, shit, I forgot about lunch!
Max gets up and runs out. Charles and Sam exchange a look.
SAM
Man, he'll do anything to avoid change,
won't he?
Max leaves the building and stops to look at the winter
sunrise.
SUPER: black on white: "SATURDAY"
I don't believe
In an interventionist God
But I know, darling
That you do
Students work in the library as light refracts through
icicles in the window.
But if I did
I would kneel down and ask Him
Not to intervene
When it came to you
88.
A boy and a girl hold hands as they cross an icy street.
Squirrels play in the light.
The sun reflects off the University Center windows and back
onto the snow.
Not to touch a hair on your head
To leave you as you are
But if He felt He had to direct you
Direct you into my arms...
Max and Julie walk through the snow together, toward a
parking lot. She's taking deep drags off a cigarette.
94.
JULIE
This has been some crazy week. I still
have a six page paper due Monday.
MAX
Six pages? That's nothing. Triple spaced,
in 14 point type, that's only like 500
words. If a picture's worth a thousand
words, that's like a bad photocopy.
JULIE
Don't worry about it, I needed a break.
Good to get out and enjoy the weather.
MAX
What are you, from Maine?
JULIE
No.
MAX
Phew, because I don't know if I'd be able
to handle something like that. That's a
hard thing to drop on a person.
JULIE
I'm from northern Vermont. Not too far
from Canada.
MAX
Shit, I'm sorry.
JULIE
It sucked but I managed. Read a lot. Had
a few close friends. That's all you need.
It's quiet up there, dull but nice.
MAX
It sounds it.
They get to her car, and he surprises her by kissing her. She
responds, after a hesitation.
Julie's car pulls up. Her bumper sticker: "EAT ANIMALS, DON'T
`LOVE' THEM"
Max opens the door, gets halfway out, turns back.
MAX
Are you sure?
JULIE
No, it's okay. I just need a few hours to
work.
MAX
It'll be fun, just the two of us.
Julie lights a cigarette off her old one.
JULIE
Okay, see you later.
She peels out.
It is moist and foggy as Max trudges across the deserted
campus.
BETH (O.S.)
Max!
Max stops in the middle of a path as Beth walks up.
BETH (CONT'D)
Hi there. Happy Valentine's Day.
MAX
Oo, witty.
BETH
Yeah, I hate Valentine's Day, too. If
you're in love, you're in love. And if
you're not, who wants to think about it?
I want to be in love so badly, don't you?
MAX
You know, there's this joke...
BETH
Ah, forget it, Max.
MAX
You know the joke?
BETH
Does a bear shit in the woods?
MAX
Yeah, that's the one.
108.
BETH
You told it the night of our date. I hate
that joke, Max. It's not a philosophy.
MAX
But I think I know what it means now.
BETH
Yeah, and it's dreary and depressing,
right?
MAX
Not this time.
BETH
No?
MAX
(INTIMATELY)
Beth, I just want to say, before it's all
over and I don't have the chance, that
I'm sorry. For everything. Last semester
and last year.
Beth is speechless; she never though she'd ever hear that.
MAX (CONT'D)
You mean the world to me, and I was an
idiot to throw it away. You were right:
if I can't be a friend to you, how could
I be a boyfriend? I've done a lot of
things wrong, and I've been confused as
hell, but I think it's time for a change.
Beth looks him over, as if for the first time.
BETH
Really?
MAX
Really.
BETH
Then allow me to recommend a movie that
you've never seen before. It's called
Annie Hall.
MAX
I was going to see it tonight. Do you
want to join me?
BETH
I would love to, but I think you need to
do this alone.
109.
MAX
No, you're right.
BETH
But I'll see you later?
MAX
Sure. After the movie, I'm doing my last
radio show. It's going to be all
requests. You should tune in.
BETH
The end of an era.
MAX
The start of a new one.
He smiles and walks away. The fog begins to obscure him.
Beth opens her backpack and removes a Walkman. She hits POWER
and the LED changes from TAPE to RADIO.
MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)
And that's how I let go of her. Although,
it's probably more honest to say that she
let go of me. Julie, Beth, and Annie.
Three women in my life and I was
desperate for one.
REVERSE ANGLE. Beth stands alone, watching him go. She snaps
the headphones over her ears.
MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)
Of course, I saw her again. It's a small
campus. The last time was at a film
festival. We're better friends now then
ever, and there's always a chance we can
have some kind of future together. So
far, so good.
Finally, Beth turns and walks away.
CUT BACK TO: Max still walking, getting smaller and smaller.
Soon all we see is fog.
MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)
She'll always mean a lot to me, and it's
nice to run into her and reminisce about
what we, ya know, went through. It was a
weird period of my life. I mean, shit, I
really got off track there, didn't I?
