'She' plays through the credits.
Exquisite footage of Anna Scott -- the great movie star of our
time -- an ideal -- the perfect star and woman -- her life full of
glamour and sophistication and mystery.
Mix through to William, 35, relaxed, pleasant, informal.
We
follow him as he walks down Portobello Road, carrying a load of
bread.
It is spring.
WILLIAM (V.O.)
Of course, I've seen her films and
always thought she was, well,
fabulous -- but, you know,
million miles from the world I live
in.
Which is here -- Notting Hill
-- not a bad place to be...
It's a full fruit market day.
WILLIAM (V.O.)
There's the market on weekdays,
selling every fruit and vegetable
known to man...
A man in denims exits the tattoo studio.
WILLIAM (V.O.)
The tattoo parlour -- with a guy
outside who got drunk and now can't
remember why he chose 'I Love Ken'...
WILLIAM (V.O.)
The racial hair-dressers where
everyone comes out looking like the
Cookie Monster, whether they like
it or not...
Sure enough, a girl exits with a huge threaded blue bouffant.
WILLIAM (V.O.)
Then suddenly it's the weekend, and
from break of day, hundreds of stalls
appears out of nowhere, filling
Portobello Road right up to Notting
Hill Gate...
A frantic crowded Portobello market.
WILLIAM (V.O.)
... and thousands of people buy
millions of antiques, some genuine...
The camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained
glass windows of various sizes, some featuring biblical scenes
and saints.
WILLIAM (V.O.)
... and some not so genuine.
WILLIAM (V.O.)
And what's great is that lots of
friends have ended up in this part of
London -- that's Tony, architect
turned chef, who recently invested
all the money he ever earned in a new
restaurant...
Shot of Tony proudly setting out a board outside his restaurant,
the sign still being painted.
He receives and approves a huge
fresh salmon.
WILLIAM (V.O.)
So this is where I spend my days
and years -- in this small village in
the middle of a city -- in a house
with a blue door that my wife and I
bought together... before she left
me for a man who looked like Harrison
Ford, only even handsomer...
We arrive outside his blue-doored house just off Portobello.
WILLIAM (V.O.)
... and where I now lead a strange
half-life with a lodger called...
WILLIAM (V.O.)
And so it was just another hopeless
Wednesday, as I set off through the
market to work, little suspecting
that this was the day which would
change my life forever.
This is
work, by the way, my little travel
book shop...
A small unpretentious store... named 'The Travel Book Co.'
WILLIAM (V.O.)
... which, well, sells travel books
-- and, to be frank with you, doesn't
always sell many of those.
William enters.
William sets off.
William swings out of the little shop -- he turns the corner of
Portobello Road and bumps straight into Anna.
The orange
juice,
in its foam cup, flies.
It soaks Anna.
ANNA
Oh Jesus.
WILLIAM
Here, let me help.
He grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting
far too near her breasts in the panic of it...
ANNA
What are you doing?!
He jumps back.
WILLIAM
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just
over the street -- you could get
cleaned up.
ANNA
No thank you.
I need to get my car
back.
WILLIAM
I also have a phone.
I'm confident
that in five minutes we can have you
spick and span and back on the street
again... in the non-prostitute sense
obviously.
In his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being
genuinely annoyed.
She turns and looks at him.
ANNA
Okay.
So what does 'just over the
street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
WILLIAM
Eighteen yards.
That's my house
there.
He doesn't lie -- it is eighteen yards away.
She looks down.
She looks up at him.
The two of them on the rooftop terrace, passing the day.
William is reading 'The bookseller.'
The terrace is small and
the plants aren't great -- but it overlooks London in a rather
wonderful way.
Spike still in scuba gear, goggles on.
SPIKE
There's something wrong with the
goggles though...
WILLIAM
No, they were prescription, so I could
see all the fishes properly.
SPIKE
Groovy.
You should do more of this
stuff.
WILLIAM
So -- any messages?
SPIKE
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
WILLIAM
Two?
That's it?
SPIKE
You want me to write down all your
messages?
William closes his eyes in exasperation.
WILLIAM
Who were the ones you didn't write
down from?
SPIKE
Ahm let's see -- ahm.
No.
Gone
completely.
Oh no, wait.
There was --
one from your mum: she said don't
forget lunch and her leg's hurting
again.
WILLIAM
Right.
No one else?
SPIKE
Absolutely not.
Spike leans back and relaxes.
SPIKE
Though if we're going for this
obsessive writing-down-all-messages
thing -- some American girl called
Anna called a few days ago.
William freezes -- then looks at Spike.
WILLIAM
What did she say?
SPIKE
Well, it was genuinely bizarre...
she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then
she said, call me at the Ritz -- and
then gave herself a completely
different name.
WILLIAM
Which was?
SPIKE
Absolutely no idea.
Remembering one
name's bad enough...
William jumps off a bus and walks toward the Ritz.
He carries a
small bunch of roses.
William and Anna step outside.
From inside they hear a massive
and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true
feelings.
William is a little embarrassed.
WILLIAM
Sorry -- they always do that when I
leave the house.
The house is in Lansdowne Road, on the edge of Notting Hill.
They walk for a moment.
A bit of silence.
ANNA
Floppy, huh?
WILLIAM
It's the hair!
It's to do with the
hair.
ANNA
Why is she in a wheelchair?
WILLIAM
It was an accident -- about eighteen
months ago.
ANNA
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to
do with the accident?
WILLIAM
You know, I'm not sure.
I don't
think they'd tried for kids before,
as fate would have it.
They walk in silence for a moment.
Then...
WILLIAM
Would you like to come... my house is
just...?
She smiles and shakes her head.
ANNA
Too complicated.
WILLIAM
That's fine.
ANNA
Busy tomorrow?
WILLIAM
I thought you were leaving.
ANNA
I was.
A little later in the walk.
ANNA
What's in there?
They are now walking by a five foot railing, with foliage
behind it.
WILLIAM
Gardens.
All these streets round
here have these mysterious communal
gardens in the middle of them.
They're like little villages.
ANNA
Let's go in.
WILLIAM
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're
private villages -- only the people
who live round the edges are allowed
in.
ANNA
You abide by rules like that?
WILLIAM
Ahm...
Her look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on
the answer to this.
WILLIAM
Heck no -- other people do -- but not
me -- I just do what I want.
He rattles the gate, then starts his climb -- but doesn't quite
make it, and falls back onto the pavement...
WILLIAM
(casually)
Whoopsidaisies.
ANNA
What did you say?
WILLIAM
Nothing.
ANNA
Yes, you did.
WILLIAM
No, I didn't.
ANNA
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
Tiny pause.
WILLIAM
I don't think so.
No one has said
'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean
unless they're...
ANNA
There's no 'unless.'
No one has said
"whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and
even then it was only little girls
with blonde ringlets.
WILLIAM
Exactly.
Here we go again.
He fails, and unfortunately, spontaneously...
WILLIAM
Whoopsidaisies.
They look at each other.
WILLIAM
It's a disease I've got -- it's a
clinical thing.
I'm taking pills and
having injections -- it won't last
long.
ANNA
Step aside.
She starts to climb.
WILLIAM
Actually be careful Anna -- it's
harder than it looks...
But she's already almost over.
WILLIAM
Oh no it's not -- it's easy.
A few seconds later.
Anna jumps down into the garden.
ANNA
Come on, Flops.
William clambers over with terrible difficulty, dusts himself
off, and heads towards where she stands.
WILLIAM
Now seriously -- what in the world
in this garden could make that
ordeal worthwhile?
She leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first
time -- she kisses him.
This time a proper kiss.
A tiny pause.
WILLIAM
Nice garden.
They walk around the garden.
It's a moonlit dream.
We see
the lights of the houses that surround the garden.
They come
across a single, simple wooden bench.
ANNA
'For June, who loved this garden --
from Joseph who always sat beside
her.'
We cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood.
She
doesn't read the dates, carved below -- 'June Wetherby, 1917
- 1992.'
She is slightly chocked by it.
ANNA
Some people do spend their whole
lives together.
He nods.
They are standing on either side of the bench,
looking at each other.
The camera glides away from them, up
into the night sky, leaving them alone in the garden.
Music
plays.
They are walking.
ANNA
I shouldn't have done that.
I
shouldn't have done that.
WILLIAM
No, you were brilliant
ANNA
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what
am I doing with you?
WILLIAM
I don't know, I'm afraid.
ANNA
I don't know either.
They have arrived at the end of the arcade.
ANNA
Here we are.
(pause)
Do you want to come up?
WILLIAM
(he hoes)
There seem to be lots of reasons
why I shouldn't.
ANNA
There are lots of reasons.
Do you
want to come up?
His look says yes.
ANNA
Give me five minutes.
He watches her go -- and stands in the street.
Music plays.
William walks down the arcade outside the hotel.
He is
stunned.
William sits alone on a bus.
We see him through the side
window.
As it drives away, we see that the whole back of the
bus is taken up with a huge picture of Anna.
William emerges from the house, a little ruffled from a night
away from home, a heads off.
William walks past the newsagent, heading for home.
We see,
though he doesn't, a rack of tabloid papers, all of which seem
to have very grainy, grabbed pictures of Anna on their front
page.
Headlines --'Anna Stunna'-- 'It's Definitely Her!'
and 'Scott of Pantartica.'
William arrives at the door and opens it.
There stands a dark-
glassed Anna.
ANNA
Hi.
Can I come in?
WILLIAM
Come in.
She moves inside.
Her hair is a mess -- her eyes are tired.
Nothing idealized.
A little later.
They're in the thick of the script.
WILLIAM
'Message from command.
Would you like
them to send in the HKs?'
ANNA
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we
need radar feedback before the KFT's
return at 19 hundred -- then inform the
Pentagon that we'll be needing black
star cover from ten hundred through
12.15' -- and don't you dare say one
word about how many mistakes I made in
that speech or I'll pelt you with
olives.
WILLIAM
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that
on straightaway.'
ANNA
'Thank you.'
How many mistake did I
make?
WILLIAM
Eleven.
ANNA
Damn.
'And Wainwright...'
WILLIAM
Cartwright.
ANNA
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever
your name is, I promised little Jimmy
I'd be home for his birthday -- could
you get a message through that I may
be a little late.'
WILLIAM
'Certainly.
And little Johnny?'
ANNA
My son's name is Johnny?
WILLIAM
Yup.
ANNA
Well, get a message through to him
too.
WILLIAM
Brilliant.
(the scene's over)
Word perfect I'd say.
ANNA
What do you think?
WILLIAM
Gripping.
It's not Jane Austen, it's
not Henry James, but it's gripping.
ANNA
You think I should do Henry James
instead?
WILLIAM
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James.
But, you know -- this writer's pretty
damn good too.
ANNA
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone
in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve
to say 'inform the Pentagon that we
need black star cover.'
WILLIAM
And I think the book is the poorer for
it.
Anna smiles her biggest smile of the day.
He is helping.
William heads down the corridor and opens the door.
Outside
are hundreds of paparazzi -- an explosion of cameras and
questions, of noise and light.
The press seem to fill the
entire street.
WILLIAM
Jesus Christ.
He comes back inside, snapping the door behind him.
Anna is in
the kitchen.
ANNA
What?
WILLIAM
Don't ask.
She heads back the corridor, with no suspicion.
ANNA
You're up to something...
She thinks he's fooling around.
She opens the door, the same
explosion.
In a split second she's inside.
ANNA
Oh my God.
And they got a photo of you
dressed like that?
WILLIAM
Undressed like this, yes.
ANNA
Jesus.
From outside -- we see this scrawny bloke in the frame of the
doorway, in his grey underpants.
A thousand photos.
Spike
poses athletically.
As full, sad music plays -- William begins to walk through
Notting Hill.
This walk takes six months... as he walks, the seasons actually
and magically change, from summer, through autumn and winter,
back into spring...
First it is summer -- summer fruits and flowers -- a six-month
pregnant woman -- Honey with another leather-jacket boyfriend.
As he walks on the rain starts to fall -- he turns up his coat
collar -- umbrellas appear.
Followed by winter coats --
chestnuts roasting -- Christmas trees on sale and the first hint
of snow.
Then he comes to Blenheim Crescent, which is startling snowscape,
for the hundred yard, right across Ladbroke Grove.
By the time he reaches the purple cafe, the snow is melting and
in a few yards, it is spring again.
He passes Honey again --
arguing with her boyfriend, walking away tearful.
Then turns
past 'the pregnant woman' -- now holding her three-month baby.
The camera holds on her.
Cut to the wide sweep of Hampstead Heath.
William entirely
alone.
He marches up a hill... goes over the crest of it -- and
sees a huge film crew and hundreds of extras in front of the
radiant white of Kenwood House, with its lawn and its lakes.
Now closer to the house, William approaches a barrier -- where
he is himself approached.
SECURITY
Can I help you?
WILLIAM
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
SECURITY
Does she know you're coming?
WILLIAM
No, no.
She doesn't.
SECURITY
I'm afraid I can't really let you
through then, sir.
WILLIAM
Oh right.
I mean, I am a friend -- I'm
not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
SECURITY
... can't let you through.
At that moment -- thirty yards away, William sees trailer door
open.
Out of it comes Anna -- looking extraordinary -- in a
velvet dress; full, beautiful make-up; rich, extravagant hair.
She has a necessary cluster of people about her.
Hair, make-up,
costume and the third assistant who has collected her.
She walks a few yards, and then casually turns her head.
And
sees him.
Her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a
simple smile.
His being there is a complicated thing.
Cut back to him.
He does a small wave.
She pauses as the whole
paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them.
The
movie divides them.
But then she begins to walk through it, and
followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him.
When
she reaches him, the security guard stands back a pace, and her
people hold back.
She doesn't really know what to say...
ANNA
This is certainly... ah...
WILLIAM
I only found out you were here
yesterday.
ANNA
I was going to ring... but... I didn't
think you'd want to...
The third assistant is under pressure.
THIRD
Anna.
She looks around.
The poor third is nervous -- and the first is
approaching.
ANNA
(to William)
It's not going very well -- and it's
our last day.
WILLIAM
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
ANNA
But... wait... there are things to say.
WILLIAM
Okay.
ANNA
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
She is swept away, four people touching her hair and costume.
KAREN
Come and have a look...
As they make towards the set...
KAREN
Are you a fan of Henry James?
WILLIAM
This is Henry James film?
A complicated shot is about to happen -- with waves of extras --
and a huge moving crane.
They end up next to the sound desk.
KAREN
This is Harry -- he'll give you a pair of
headphones so you can hear the dialogue.
Harry the sound man is a pleasant, fifty-year-old balding
fellow.
He hands him the headphones.
HARRY
Here we go.
The volume control is on
the side.
WILLIAM
That's great.
William, the headphones on, surveys the scene -- the cluster is
a full 100 yards from the action, to allow a gracious sweeping
wide-shot.
He watches Anna.
She is with her co-star in the
Henry James film -- let's call him James.
JAMES
We are living in cloudcuckooland --
we'll never get this done today.
ANNA
We have to.
I've got to be in New York
on Thursday.
JAMES
Oh, stop showing off.
He studies an actress a few yards to the left.
JAMES
God, that's an enormous arse.
ANNA
I'm not listening.
JAMES
No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so
many tragic young teenagers with
anorexia -- and that girl has an arse
she could perfectly well share round
with at least ten other women -- and
still be beg-bottomed.
ANNA
I said I'm not listening -- and I think,
looking at something that firm, you and
your droopy little excuse for an 'arse'
would be well-advised to keep quiet.
Back by the desk, William is listening and laughs.
That's his
girl.
Anna prepares.
ANNA
So I ask you when you're going to tell
everyone, and you say...?
JAMES
'Tomorrow will be soon enough.'
ANNA
And then I... right.
JAMES
Who was that rather difficult chap you
were talking to on the way up?
ANNA
Oh... no one... no one.
Just some...
guy from the past.
I don't know what
he's doing here.
Bit of an awkward
situation.
Cut back to William -- he has heard.
WILLIAM
Of course.
He takes off the headphones and puts them gently down.
WILLIAM
Thank you.
HARRY
Anytime.
William walks away.
The moment of hope is gone.
He couldn't
have had a clear reminder.
Max's car arrives in the street outside.
They pile into the
car.
MAX
If anyone gets in our way -- we have
small nuclear devices.
BERNIE
And we intend to use them!
MAX
Where's Bella?
HONEY
She's not coming.
MAX
Sod that.
Bernie -- in the back!
He shoots out of his door, rushes round and grabs Bella out of
the chair.
MAX
Come on, babe.
Max's car is shooting up Stanley Crescent.
We are inside and
outside the car.
BELLA
Where are you going?
MAX
Down Kensington Church Street, then
Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
BELLA
Crazy.
Go along Bayswater...
HONEY
That's right -- then Park Lane.
BERNIE
Or you could go right down to Cromwell
Road, and left.
WILLIAM
No!
Suddenly the car slams to a halt.
MAX
Stop right there!
I will decide the
route.
All right?
ALL
All right.
MAX
James Bond never has to put up with this
sort of shit.
The car turns illegally right across Piccadilly the wrong way
down a one-way street and ends up outside the Ritz.
William
sprints into the hotel.
Bernie follows.
BERNIE
Bloody hell, this is fun.
IT. RITZ LOBBY - DAY
WILLIAM
Is Miss Scott staying here?
It is the same man.
RITZ MAN
No, sir.
WILLIAM
How about Miss Flintstone?
RITZ MAN
No, sir.
WILLIAM
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or
Butthead?
Man shakes his head.
RITZ MAN
No, sir.
WILLIAM
Right.
Right.
Fair enough.
Thanks.
He turns despondent and takes two steps when the Ritz Man stops
him in his tracks.
RITZ MAN
There was a Miss Pocahontas in room 126
-- but she checked out an hour ago.
I
believe she's holding a press
conference at The Savoy before flying to
America.
William is very grateful.
He kisses the Ritz Man.
Bernie's also
gratuful.
He kisses him too.
BERNIE
We have lift off!!
A Japanese guest assumes this is the way to behave and the Ritz
Man gets kissed a third time.
The car speeds through London.
It gets totally stuck at a
junction where no one will let them in.
SPIKE
Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.
He gets out of the car and boldly stops the traffic coming in the
opposite direction.
Our car shoots past him.
SPIKE
Go!
They leave him behind.
Honey leans out the window and shouts...
HONEY
You're my hero.
Spike waves wildly -- he loses concentration and is very nearly
hit by a car.
They pull to a stop.
William leaps out.
MAX
Go!
Anna and William at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the
crowd.
Honey, a bridesmaid in peach satin -- she is surrounded by at
least four other bridesmaids, all under five.
Nearby, Tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous,
pyramidical wedding cake.
William's mother is not quite happy with how he's looking.
She
tries to brush his hair.
Max, dressed in the most devastating Bond-like white tuxedo is
dancing with Anna -- thrilled.
He does a rather flashy little
move.
Cut to Bella who is watching and laughing.
Martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a
song, entirely happy in the corner.
A huge premier -- screaming crowds -- Anna and William get out
of the car, she holding his hand --
looking ultimately gorgeous
-- he in a black tie that doesn't quite fit.
He's startled.
A pretty green communal garden.
Children are playing, watched
by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose.
A very
old couple wander along slowly.
A small tai chi group moves mysteriously.
And as the camera
glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden
bench overlooking the garden.
He is reading, she is just
looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant.
It
is William and Anna.
