Autumnal streets seen through the sooty glass of a STREET
LAMP. Shadows within shadows. Fog in the air. Full
moon.
WATSON (V.O.)
The year was 1891. London was the
capital of the world -- the height
of modernity, with the hiss of
steam and smell of coal in the
air. It was also the great
cesspool into which all the
sinners and criminals of the
empire drained.
Gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a
POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making
his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern.
WATSON (V.O.)
I had come to London, ten years
prior, to find a life after the
Afghan war. I had hoped to start
a medical practice and settle into
a nice, steady existence. The
life I found was anything but nice
and steady.
We can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive
silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. A
FURIOUS CLATTER OF HOOVES APPROACHES in the distance.
The MAN tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing
stampede.
WATSON (V.O.)
And that had everything to do with
one man. My friend, my partner,
my burden...
The MAN exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the
impression that he knows something that we don't.
WATSON (V.O.)
... Sherlock Holmes.
WHAM! The MAN in the deerstalker hat is KNOCKED FLAT by
A RUNNING MAN who has vaulted over a wall, sending him,
his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles.

The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead
just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies
it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he
recognizes his famous assailant.
MAN
Sherlock Holmes?!
SHERLOCK HOLMES offers the handle of the umbrella to the
MAN, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken
umbrella.
HOLMES
My apologies. Send the bill to
John Watson, 221B Baker Street.
Sherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway.
The MAN
takes a step into the road to watch him go --
-- and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a
number of POLICE CARRIAGES, hurtling by on a serious
pursuit, Victorian-style.

Almost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the
Embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the
river.
As the carriage banks, we see Holmes cut across the
carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot
follow.
CUT TO:
ANOTHER ANGLE
Holmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and
runs across a courtyard to a side door.
WE PULL BACK to see the FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.

Autumn has turned to winter.
SUPERIMPOSE:
THREE MONTHS LATER
FROM A RAVEN'S POV
We FOLLOW a lady, MRS. HUDSON, walking down the street
with the day's shopping. She picks up a paper with the
day's headline "BLACKWOOD HANGS TOMORROW: CLAIMS PACK
WITH THE DEVIL." She continues down the street until
arriving at 221 Baker Street. A raven lands on the entry
gate, she shoos it away, walks up the steps, and inside.

Watson and Holmes ride in a cab, passing familiar
landmarks as the city comes to life. They sit in
silence, tension hanging between them. Finally Holmes
grabs Watson's bag, rummages around and pulls out a clean
white shirt.
Watson looks out the window, frustrated. He sees THE
HALF-CONSTRUCTED MASS OF TOWER BRIDGE. Near ground
level, workers take down a large BLACKWOOD STEEL sign.
HOLMES
Look at that structure. What has
it been? Five years' work
already? Are you aware that is
the first combination of bascule
and suspension bridge. Very
innovative.
No reply.
As Holmes is taking off his jacket, he reaches into his
pocket and pulls out a wad of money.

HOLMES
Oh, I have your cut from last
night, by the way. You weren't
there so I laid your customary
bet --
Silence.
Holmes takes off his shirt.
HOLMES
You're right... I'll keep it with
your check book, locked safely
away in my drawer.
Silence.
Holmes pulls on the clean shirt.
HOLMES
The opera house is featuring Don
Giovanni and I could easily
procure two tickets if you had
some cultural inclination this
evening.
Silence.
HOLMES
You have the grand gift of
silence, Watson. It makes you
quite invaluable as a companion.
Watson punches him square in the face.
WATSON
And your grand gift is the uncanny
ability to demoralize people. I
was aware she'd been engaged. She
told me.
Holmes rubs his jaw.
HOLMES
So that's a `no' to the opera
then?
Watson's steaming.
Holmes puts on his vest.
WATSON
That's my waistcoat.
HOLMES
It's too small for you.
WATSON
Well, it's my property and I want
it back.

Holmes hands him the waistcoat which he promptly tosses
out of the carriage window. Holmes frowns, looks out the
opposite window.

Already a CROWD is gathering outside the jail, papers are
for sale, Blackwood's death is the headline. Religious
zealots and occultists swarm. Police keep them away from
the entrance. Holmes heads inside, Watson stops.
WATSON
You go ahead. I've no business
with him while he's alive.

We PICK UP Irene crossing a street. She passes a DARK
ALLEYWAY. Pauses. Looks. She turns into the alley.
HOLD ON the alley for a long beat. Too dark to see much
in there.

IRENE
emerges from the alley holding a lovely bunch of roses.
She sniffs them appreciatively, walks on.

IRENE
approaches a waiting carriage, looks around her, gets in.

A rough-looking BEGGAR wearing an eye patch has fallen
under a wheel of the coach.
BEGGAR
Ow, me leg!

COACH DRIVER
Get out of it!
BEGGAR
You run me over, sir, yes you did!
COACH DRIVER
You fell right into the carriage!
The Beggar is up, limping toward the window where
Moriarty and Irene sit. He has disgusting blackened
teeth.
BEGGAR
A little charity would go a long
way, yes it would, sir.

CONTINUED: (2)

He reaches toward the window. Within a nanosecond,
Moriarty extends his hand into which a PISTOL appears,
delivered by a concealed mechanism (Travis Bickle style).
The gun rests on the Beggar's forehead. The cold eyes of
the man that holds the weapon bore into the skull of the
Beggar, who backs off in fear. The carriage moves on.
35
37
Holmes flies from the window and lands neatly on a tin
roof. The jump to the next level is a more taxing
prospect. Holmes weighs the distance and hurls himself
down with a determined look. He lands just right.

Holmes jumps off the shed, heads for the street one block
over from Baker Street.

He runs down the mews in great haste, stops at the same
alley that Irene disappeared into -- but at the other
side.
CUT TO:
HOLMES' POV DOWN ALLEY
from concealment:
Irene walks towards a MAN HOLDING A
BUNCH OF ROSES.
MAN WITH ROSES
Got some roses for you,
sweetheart. Cut you a deal `cos
you're so pretty.
IRENE
Oh, how nice of you.
Even without the man -- who is scrofulous and sly -- no
woman in her right mind would go down this alley.
38B
38B
Holmes exits the alley, catches a glimpse of Irene
through a STREET FAIR, which is being assembled.
Holmes picks up the pace.
He snatches a HAT from a one-eyed old BEGGAR with his
hand out. He drops a coin in his hand, then another coin
and snatches the beggar's eye patch too.
He runs past a coal cart, snags a lump of coal, rubs it
on his face and hands, then pops it in his mouth, chews
it to blacken his teeth.
He pauses to singe the sleeve of Watson's coat on a
fairground fire-breather's flames, runs on.
39
39
Holmes emerges as the beggar we saw previously. Again he
stops the coach and again the gun comes out, but this
time we can see that Holmes gets a view of the man on the
other end of the weapon before the carriage pulls away.
37B.

Judging by the estate, Blackwood comes from old money,
and lots of it. We FOLLOW the carriage hurrying Holmes
and Watson forward.
42
42
Generations of wealth buried in moss-covered marble
memorials. Not a place for a picnic, not even on a
bright sunny day -- and it's starting to rain.
A COP stops the carriage, opens the door. Holmes and
Watson exit, Watson carries a black leather FORENSICS
KIT.
They walk up the pathway towards the Blackwood Family
Crypt. Watson barely lifts his head, scanning the ground
while Holmes appears to have taken an interest in a clump
of trees in the distance.
WATSON
Look at this mess. Nothing but
standard-issue police bootprints.
Any possible evidence there might
have been has been trampled.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

HOLMES
Scotland Yard at their finest,
once again.
Police lamps light one large marble CRYPT. The cops are
in tight clusters, whispering to themselves, spooked.
They'd rather be anywhere but here.
As Holmes and Watson approach, they see the marble doors
of the crypt have been BLASTED OPEN FROM THE INSIDE.
Holmes and Watson share a quick glance -- this is
interesting.
Lestrade emerges from the crypt.
He is sweating, shaken.
(CONTINUED)

Holmes offers Lestrade his handkerchief, Lestrade waves
it off.
LESTRADE
Look at those slabs of marble --
they're half a ton each if they're
a pound -- smashed outward like
they were nothing.
On second thought, Lestrade does take Holmes'
handkerchief.
LESTRADE
Explain it if you can, Holmes.
Holmes inspects the door, checking the hinges. He
notices the Blackwood CREST, and the image of a SPHINX.
HOLMES
And the coffin?
LESTRADE
We're digging it up now. The
witness is over there. You can
question him if you like -- but
you won't get much.
The old GROUNDSKEEPER, pale and terrified, stands out of
the rain under an ancient cypress tree.
Watson heads for him.
Holmes disappears in the opposite
direction.
As soon as their backs are turned, Lestrade marches over
to a nervous knot of cops, grabs a fistful of blue in
each hand, drags his boys in close. He doesn't want
Holmes or Watson to hear this.
LESTRADE
(low, angry)
If you lot don't stop behaving
like a bunch of superstitious milk
maids, you're on double-time!
You're an embarrassment! Also,
you're forbidden to talk about
this to anyone, not a word. Are
we bloody clear on that?
The cops nod, duly chastened.

THE GROUNDSKEEPER
mumbles the Lord's Prayer under his breath. Watson
immediately goes into doctor mode checking his pulse,
looking in his eyes.
The Groundskeeper just keeps praying. Watson takes a
boiled sweet from his pocket, pops it in the man's mouth
and gently sits him down.
Holmes walks over holding a small branch from a tree.
WATSON
He's in shock.
We should give him
a few moments.
Lestrade stomps up.
LESTRADE
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the
grave.
(at Watson,
accusingly)
Well? You pronounced the man
dead.
WATSON
(stung)
He had no pulse.
HOLMES
Inspector, do you know if this is
a spruce or a sycamore?
Lestrade shakes his head.
It hasn't been a good day for
him, or the Yard.
There's a clunk. They all turn to see the coffin has
been extracted from the crypt.
Four beefy, soil-stained cops emerge lugging the coffin.
They place it on the ground, step back, crossing
themselves, murmuring, plainly terrified. Holmes
chuckles.
LESTRADE
OPEN IT!!
(CONTINUED)
41.
42
CONTINUED: (4)
42
But no one moves. The cops pass a CROWBAR around as if
it were red-hot. Watson's had enough. He marches
forward --
-- snatches the crowbar away, jams it under the lid and
levers it off with a slow, eerie groan.
Holmes and Lestrade move forward, the cops move backward.
The coffin is filled with EARTH, overflowing. They brush
away a layer of dirt, to reveal... A DEAD BODY in the
coffin. The body is a much smaller man than Blackwood,
in everyday clothes, with red hair.
LESTRADE
That's not Blackwood.
HOLMES
Now that we have a firm grasp of
the obvious...
Watson opens his forensic kit, disturbed. Vials, silver
tools. He takes a CALIPER, begins examining the body.
WATSON
Lividity is late stage. Diptera
deposits are approximately --
(measuring)
-- three quarters of an inch,
putting the time of death at ten
to twelve hours ago.
HOLMES
Inspector, may I see your pen?
Lestrade hands over a nice fountain pen, still stunned.
Holmes takes the pen and pries open the corpse's mouth,
revealing: two missing teeth in the man's jaw.
WATSON
Missing two incisors in the upper
jaw...
(a look at Holmes)
Adler's midget.
Holmes spots something glinting in the man's dirt-filled
pocket. He uses the pen to fish out: a POCKET WATCH.
HOLMES
All yours, Inspector.
Holmes hands the pen back to Lestrade. Lestrade looks at
it with dismay, takes it in Holmes' handkerchief -- a
small measure of revenge.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (5)

Holmes and Watson begin walking away from the crypt.
Lestrade follows, anxious. Holmes shows him the dusty
pocket watch.
HOLMES
Scratches around the keyhole where
the watch is wound. Most drunks
are the same, and pawnbrokers
scratch the ticket number and
their initials inside the lid.
This one has five, so the owner --
GROUNDSKEEPER (O.S.)
He was walking.
They all stop, suddenly. The old Groundskeeper stands in
front of them, ready to unburden himself.
GROUNDSKEEPER
(quivering voice)
He was walking but his feet didn't
touch the ground. And I'm not
daft, I know what I saw and I know
Lord Blackwood. He was as alive
as you or me. It's not right.
It's not natural.
(turns, leaves)
Our Father Who art in heaven...
(etc.)
All three men watch the Groundskeeper go. A sudden gust
of wind moans eerily. They all want to get the hell out
of there.
HOLMES
Now the game is afoot, Watson.
42A-50 OMITTE

Holmes stands in the middle of the street contentedly
observing humanity. Watson ENTERS FRAME and hands Holmes
a bundle wrapped in newspaper.
WATSON
I fail to see how these fish and
chips are different from the three
other places we passed along the
way.
HOLMES
Trust me.

WATSON
Just eat.
Holmes complies hungrily and they start to stroll along.
Watson appears preoccupied.
WATSON
You know, I've seen things in war
that I couldn't explain. I once
heard a man predict his death,
down to the number and placement
of the bullet holes that killed
him. You have to admit that a
supernatural explanation is at
least theoretically possible.

HOLMES
(mouth full, near
indecipherable)
Never theorize before you have
data. Invariably, you end up
twisting facts to suit theories,
instead of theories to suit facts.
Adler's midget is the key to this.
Holmes pulls out a JEWELER'S LOUP, screws it into his
eye, and flips Reordon's watch open. He examines the
lid.
HOLMES
Hmm... scratches around the
keyhole, what does that tell you?
WATSON
The owner was most likely a drunk.
Each time he wound the watch his
hand would slip, hence the
scratches.
HOLMES
Very good, Watson! You've
developed considerable powers of
your own.
Watson looks quite chuffed.
HOLMES
Let's see now, there are several
sets of initials scored into the
lid.
WATSON
Pawnbroker's marks.
HOLMES
Excellent.
Watson looks extremely pleased with himself until they
turn a corner into a street where EVERY SECOND SHOP IS A
PAWN SHOP. His face falls.
HOLMES
The most recent is M.H...
Watson shakes his head.
WATSON
Maddison and Haig.

HOLMES
Oh my Lord, here we are. They
should give us an address.
WE SEE MADDISON & HAIG, PAWNBROKERS, RESPECTABLE,
DISCREET, ahead of them there on Bow Street.
WATSON
There's one thing you've missed.
On the watch.
HOLMES
I think not.
WATSON
The time. Which leads me to
deduce that I'm already late for
my appointment with Mary. You
remember, the one I was leaving
for before you talked me into
coming to dig up dead bodies with
you.
A GYPSY PALM READER approaches Watson as he turns to
leave.
PALM READER
Reckon your future, sir?
HOLMES
Perhaps we do need a little help
from the beyond.
WATSON
No, thank you.
She grabs his hand anyway.
PALM READER
You need to hear what I have to
tell you.
Watson is so taken aback by the urgency and gravity of
her tone that he doesn't pull away.
PALM READER
I see two men, brothers. Not in
blood but in bond. I see the
letters S and an L, no... wait, a
J.
Holmes and Watson look at each other.
She has their
attention.

PALM READER

Watson looks at Holmes.
PALM READER
I see a letter... the letter M...
another M... Mary? You will be
married... I see... I see...
(horrified)
Patterned table clothes, china
figurines, lace doilies...
Watson snatches his hand away.
WATSON
You think you are clever don't
you?
Holmes feigns innocence.
PALM READER
She turns to fat...
WATSON
Enough.
The Palm Reader looks at Holmes.
HOLMES
(to Watson)
Do you have any changes?
Watson shakes his head as he pays the woman.
WATSON
This is a new low -- even for you.

HOLMES
It's the most honest prediction
old Flora has made in years. And
you know it yourself, Watson.
That is precisely the reason you
can't find a suitable ring.
You're terrified of a life without
the thrill of the macabre, as well
you should be.
Holmes swallows the last of his cod and casts the
wrapping aside, pleased with himself.
WATSON
Do you still have my cut from the
fight?
Holmes digs into a pocket, produces a wad of coins.
HOLMES
Why, do you --
Watson snatches the money, storms into Madison and Haig.
Holmes is confused until he spots a sign in the window:
"Large selection of engagement rings for every wallet."
Holmes starts to look a bit nervous. As he follows
Watson, he is intercepted by the Palm Reader who grabs
his arm.
PALM READER
I seen something in his hand.
Darkness and great pain. Mortal
peril. Warn your friend, he's not
safe.
Even Holmes is taken aback by this.
52
52
Holmes and Watson move down the street, the pawnshop
behind them. Now Watson is smiling, and Holmes is not.
Watson is beaming at: an ENGAGEMENT RING in a box.
WATSON
Not bad, eh?
Holmes turns away, looks down at the TICKET he got from
the pawnshop: an ADDRESS.
HOLMES
Reordon's lodgings should be right
around this bend. Here we are...

For now though, big wooden chocks hold it in place, the
whole thing is attached to a heavy chain that coils back
around the shed that they just ran through.
Holmes trails the hulking form of Dredger into this
network of struts. They weave through the shadows.
Holmes sees one of the cables shifting slightly.
He

ZAP! Holmes steps into Dredger's path, hitting him with
the lightning-rod, knocking him back. ZAP!! Holmes
gives another jolt, but the shaft starts to LOSE POWER.
Dredger knows there isn't much juice left. He reaches
out, grabs the weapon and... smiles a terrifying smile.
A moment of reckoning between Holmes and Dredger:
The shaft slowly... sizzles... out. Dredger tosses the
rod. And now, Holmes backs away, as --
Dredger grabs a sledgehammer, and swings the hammer at
Holmes, smashing some of the wooden supports, tearing
others out of his way. The ship LURCHES forward.

Watson runs round the end of the building and sees Holmes
scrambling under the half-built hull. Dredger in
pursuit.

64A
A police WHISTLE echoes through the air.
Dredger turns
for a moment, just long enough for --
Holmes to launch himself at Dredger. They tumble down
onto the massive runners on the floor of the slipway.
Holmes wrestles Dredger's head onto the runner and pins
him down. Dredger kicks out viciously, splintering
another chock. It's the last straw for the support
mechanism, the whole thing starts to creak.
64B

From his vantage point, Watson can see what's coming.
WATSON
Holmes!

Grappling frantically on the runners, both Holmes and
Dredger look up as the HUGE CHOCKS holding the ship
EXPLODE BACKWARDS --
-- the PROPELLERS on the stern of the ship start sliding
down towards them.
52.
66

Dredger looks up at the approach of the propellers --
-- Holmes charges into Dredger again, pulling him
backwards across the runners. Dredger pulls Holmes down
with him, Holmes' head hits the ground hard.
Holmes lies semi-conscious, eyes rolled back into his
head, as the leviathan roars down towards him.
The ground beneath him shakes, knocks his head against
the runner -- once, twice -- as he blinks back into
consciousness, he sees the great shadow sweeping over
him. He's doomed. And...
The stern lurches to a STOP INCHES from his face. He
opens one tentative eye, half expecting to find himself
in the after-life, and sees black metal an inch from his
nose. He realizes the ship has stopped, but he doesn't
know why. He tries to roll out of the way, as --
66A
66A
We see the chain extended taut as a tight-rope behind the
half-launched ship.
The SHIP squeals and groans as its timber supports buckle
and crack with the weight of the tethered ship.
A beat where the whole business hangs in limbo and...
The timber finally gives way.
The ship is free again,
falling through the air --
Holmes rolls sideways as the propellers slice through the
air above his head -- the hull screams past him with a
sound like the side of the world being torn off --
-- and then the ship's away, parting the Thames with a
vast, frothy explosion of water.
Holmes watches the ship drift gracefully out into the
river -- from vortex to serenity in a matter of seconds.
A quiet beat.
Holmes collapses back, great gulps of air disappearing
into his lungs. He tries to pull himself to his feet,
but Dredger's bone-shaking punches have taken it out of
him and he sags back to the ground.
Watson arrives, helps him to his feet. They stagger back
to the slipway where Dredger was standing. And they
find:

Holmes and Lestrade march along. Lestrade holds out a
copy of the newspaper. The headline reads: "BLACKWOOD
LIVES AND THE DEVIL WALKS WITH HIM! MURDERER

LESTRADE
Tell me you have answers.
HOLMES
All in good time.
LESTRADE
We don't have time. I've an

crosses over their desks. A
public that's working itself into

A few DROPS OF RAIN trickle down. He looks up, surprised
by the rain. He raises his collar, and keeps moving.
He hits the door to a building. It is locked. He bangs
on the door, as the rain comes harder. The door finally
opens. As he enters, we see the rain stops behind him,
gone as fast as it came. A RAVEN flaps into the night.

The fireball plummets through the sky, lighting city
blocks. People look up, gape, and --
WHOOMPF! Standish lands on the roof of a carriage.
Horses and carriages SCREECH to a stop.

An industrial area on a bend of the Thames. Work doesn't
stop when the sun goes down. Wharves stretch out into
the water. WE SEE a boat is being loaded. We PULL BACK
FROM the scene and look ACROSS the water.
Just above the thump of industry we can hear a
distinctive and irregular CHUGGING sound. Slowly a
decrepit and eccentric little steam launch chugs INTO
VIEW. Holmes is on the deck along with a much older man
in a sailor's hat -- CAPTAIN TANNER.
HOLMES
Everything all right, Captain
Tanner?
Captain Tanner has few teeth and a large white beard.
TANNER
Just a little leak, nothing to
worry about.
Watson is busy with a bucket clearing the boat of a very
serious leak. He's soaked, and furious.
TANNER
Not a great one for the water, are
you, doctor? Army type, aren't
you? You wouldn't have lasted
long in the Navy.
Watson glares. Holmes scans the banks with a telescope.
He sees a jetty with a few shadows shifting on it. The
engine shudders off, the boat drifts. Tanner whispers:
TANNER
That's as far as we can go.
Holmes starts clambering over the side.
Watson's pissed.

Holmes' head is just visible before he drops over the
prow. He whispers at Tanner.

Tanner nods. A soft "splosh" as Holmes disappears.
Watson carefully leaves his valued possessions behind,
watch, etc. He lays down his wallet and looks at Tanner.
WATSON
I know precisely how much money is
in there.
TANNER
(taking the piss)
I am sure you do, doctor.
Watson glares, goes over the side, with his walking
stick.

Holmes and Watson emerge out of the shallows, covered in
mud. Holmes doesn't seem bothered. Watson does.
They look up and see a jetty that heads out into the
river. Two shadowy THUGS guard the dock, while more
THUGS are loading the boat with something.
Holmes and Watson scuttle forward, towards the entrance,
where two more THUGS patrol. Watson pulls out Holmes'
GUN.
HOLMES
What are you doing with my gun?
WATSON
Oh, please.
HOLMES
It was an honest mistake --
WATSON
There was nothing honest about it.
Holmes looks back at Watson, takes the gun, says nothing,
the closest he'll come to a confession. Watson steps
forward.
WATSON
Come on, let's get this over with.

They look out at the thugs guarding the door. Holmes
whispers, trying to figure out the best strategy.
HOLMES
The one on the left seems more
attentive, might prove easily
distracted. The big one's been
drinking -- whether for courage or
from habit... Watson?
Watson has already left. He simply walks up to the door
and whacks the larger man in the face with the gun --
before dispatching the other with a backhand pistol-whip.
Holmes follows, notices that both men have hip flasks.
He picks one up, takes a whiff, and pockets it as he
follows Watson. He slows, sensing something behind him.
He turns, looks at shadows. Nothing. And he enters --

Watson runs out of doors and towards the end of the dock.
He sees: Blackwood and the boat are disappearing into
the darkness.
Holmes and Irene run out of the doors following Watson.
Holmes slows, looking around the dock, seeing something
on the planks:
Steel drums are dripping.
A chemical.
Holmes recognizes
it.
HOLMES
Watson!
Watson continues down the dock, tripping a wire connected
to the steel drums, he turns realizing he has set off a
trap and turns back to warn the others --
WATSON
Holmes...
A metallic conductor SPARKS.
Time slows.
BOOM!
The drums of chemicals all EXPLODE! A blinding
conflagration engulfing Watson. For a moment, it lights
up all of London.
HOLMES
WAATTTSSSSSONNN!!!!
Holmes is pushed back
by the explosion as the rest of the
barrels that line the
dock begin exploding arond them --
it looks as it Watson
hasn't survived. BOOM! Irene is
knocked to the ground
by the blasts and flying debris.
Holmes races towards her as more explosions, flames and
debris fly all around him in slow motion, occasionally
knocking him to the ground.
He reaches Irene, picks her up and grabs part of an
exploded barrel to shield the two as they run for cover --
BOOM! The barrel splinters as a final blast knocks them
down, but to safety.
As he opens his eyes --

We see Lestrade and his men swarming the scene, they spot
Watson, alive, but unconscious. Irene has disappeared.
Holmes sees this and heads toward his friend, but --
-- is intercepted by Constable Clark.
CONSTABLE CLARK
There's an order for your arrest
all the way from the top, sir --
so you'll have to hit me now.
HOLMES
From Lord Coward?
CONSTABLE CLARK
Yes, sir, so make it look good.
HOLMES
Thank you, Clarky.
Holmes cracks Constable Clark in the sweet spot, helps
him gently to his knees. Holmes turns away, makes his
escape fast.
Holmes turns back to look at the explosion.

ESTABLISHING SHOT of London, possibly the bustle of Fleet
Street during the morning rush hour. A train crosses on
an overhead railway.
We PUSH IN UNDER the railway arch until we can make out a
splash of white in the shadows -- the Doctor from the
hospital is slumped down against the wall.
We PUSH IN ALL THE WAY, so that we CAN SEE that the
Doctor is actually Holmes.
There is something grotesque about his face, he hasn't
completely removed his disguise. Parts of it hang down,
obscuring him --
-- but not obscuring the light of instability in his
eyes. They begin to overflow with tears. He brushes
them away then looks at his wet hand, horrified.

The carriage pulls up. Crowds are gathering outside,
hawkers and tourists, plenty of flags and enthusiasm.
Holmes sees the hands of BIG BEN, climbing toward noon.
105
SPLASH! Holmes dives into the river handcuffed. He
disappears for a moment then surfaces, looks about in the
water. A moment of concern until we hear the familiar
"chug" of a struggling engine.

Holmes looks in the water and sees a rope trailing on the
surface. He grabs it with his hands. And... it pulls
him closer to the rickety boat of Captain Tanner.
Watson stands on the rear deck, pulling Holmes in on the
rope. Irene is also present.
When Holmes is level, Watson leans over and clips off his
cuffs using bolt cutters. Clearly the whole escape has
been planned. Holmes is pulled up into the boat.
TANNER
(to Watson)
I told you he'd be coming out the
top window, soldier boy. No way
he'd be coming over the terrace.
Watson hands over the change from the engagement ring.
Tanner takes it happily.
WATSON
How was Lestrade?
HOLMES
Performed his role perfectly.
A
little too perfectly, come to
think of it.
Watson has the PAPER that Holmes gave him in the attic.
WATSON
Well, your instructions were
fairly precise... about everything
except the window.
Tanner smiles, still pleased with himself.
IRENE
Where to, Sherlock?
Holmes points to a dark recess in the embankment.
HOLMES
Port side, Captain Tanner, into
the sewers.
Tanner turns the boat.
Irene looks out, her eyes narrow.
HOLMES
Watson, did you bring my clothes?
Watson hands over a pile of clothes and Holmes' PISTOL.
Holmes opens the drum, checks the load, grimaces, pockets
it. He's never going to like guns.

Then Holmes reaches inside a pocket of clothes he is
still wearing, and pulls out the hip FLASK that he took
from the men at the slaughterhouse. He takes a shot.
IRENE
Starting early, aren't we?
He offers the flask to her.
HOLMES
Trust me, have a drink.
She can see this is more than a social invitation, she
takes a hit, pulls a face. Holmes nods towards Watson,
Irene passes him the bottle. He drinks, grimaces, hands
it on to Tanner, who swallows it without flinching, wipes
his mouth, smiles. The boat is almost at the sewers.
WATSON
What are we doing in the sewers?
HOLMES
Patience, Doctor. I am about to
show you...
As they head toward the sewers, Holmes glances up toward
Big Ben, the time moving toward noon.

DAY
OF IRENE at the top of TOWER BRIDGE. She's climbed up
the inside of the Tower. She's 250 feet above the
Thames.
We've gone straight from maximum claustrophobia to
maximum knee-buckling exposure.
PULL BACK and SWEEP INTO a massive, NEAR 360-DEGREE
HELICOPTER SHOT that starts with Irene at the
(unfinished) window --
-- then shows the skeletal bridge spanned tenuously with
scaffolding --
-- then the glory of London, the center of the world,
laid out for us in breathtaking, spectacular beauty --
-- and returns to Irene as, recovered somewhat -- she
darts onto the walkway scaffolding that crosses above the
Thames.

Irene works her way through the construction debris on
the bridge. She makes it to the end, no further to go.
SHERLOCK
Woman!
Sherlock appears behind her, winded.
SHERLOCK
It's bad manners to leave without
at least saying `goodbye.'
Irene turns.
IRENE
Goodbye!
He start to move towards her.
She whips out her gun.
IRENE
You of all people know I will pull
this trigger.
They circle around each other.

IRENE
I'd tell you I'm sorry, that I
wish things could be different but
you wouldn't believe me anyway.
HOLMES
Why hurry off, give it a try.
He moves in again.
She shoots him in the arm.
And in that split second --
Blackwood drops down from behind Irene, HITS her with
WATSON'S SWORD STICK. She drops, stunned. As she falls,
Blackwood plucks the cylinder out of her hand, and kicks
her gun away. Her gun goes flying off the side of the
bridge. But Irene doesn't pause:
She swings her legs through the air, trying to take out
Blackwood's knees. But he swipes her legs away, and
KICKS DOWN and --
IRENE FALLS OFF THE BRIDGE.
BLACKWOOD
You're better off without her,
Holmes!
High above:
a RAVEN lands.

A look between them and then it's on. Holmes grabs a
short section of wooden batten out of the railing.
Flimsy, no match for the sword --
-- which is immediately apparent as Blackwood comes in,
slashes, chops six inches off the batten.
BLACKWOOD
I planned to kill a handful of
senile old men to make this empire
strong... but now because of you
thousands are going to die.
Holmes is on the defensive throughout, but, as before,
his target is the cylinder first, Blackwood second, self
defense third.
BLACKWOOD
All I have to do is break this
cylinder. The wind will do the
rest. And you'll be the first.
The two men continue their swordfight: Holmes grabs some
rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swings off
the bridge. Blackwood steps to the edge with his sword
out, awaiting Holmes. Holmes swings towards the blade
and then pushes off the bridge once again to avoid it.
Holmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from
Blackwood. He lands, whips off his scarf and twirls it
around Blackwood's arm, binding them together. They
continue to spar, now bound.
Blackwood snarls, mounts a frenzied attack, which Holmes
simply tries to survive. The two men finally part, with
Holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge.
Blackwood smiles. He grabs Holmes' gun (which Blackwood
knocked from Irene's hand earlier).
Blackwood fires at Holmes. Holmes quickly ducks. The
bullet misses him, but hits a bucket twirling above his
head. A black liquid (tar) begins to pour out in a
circle around him.
Holmes turns, as if to flee (not that there's anywhere to
go) -- his eyes lock on to something. He looks back to
Blackwood.
-- Holmes kicks a huge scaffolding plank, which falls --
-- whipping a coil of rope across the floor, hooking
Blackwood around his ankle.

119H
Blackwood is DRAGGED down the walkway by the weight of
the falling plank, pulled toward the edge.
Holmes grabs the cylinders as Blackwood passes.
Blackwood digs his fingers into a gap, screeching to a
painful halt. His fingers are white from strain. Holmes
remains cool.
HOLMES
There was never any magic.
Only
conjuring tricks.
Above Holmes:
the raven starts PECKING at a rope.
HOLMES
The simplest involved paying
people off, like the prison
guard...
Holmes looks over the edge of the walkway. He sees the
plank swinging dangerously in the storm. Blackwood
strains desperately to hold on. As Holmes steps closer
we INTERCUT with relevant FLASHBACKS.
HOLMES
(guard choking/
payoff)
Who pretended to be possessed
outside your cell. Your
reputation and your jailers' fear
did the rest.
(burial ground/
licking rocks)
Others required more elaborate
preparation, like the sandstone
slab that covered your tomb. You
had it broken before your burial
then put back together using a
mild adhesive. An ancient
Egyptian recipe I believe -- a
mixture of egg and honey.
Designed to be washed away by the
rain or eaten by animals.
(bath/Reordon
flashback)
Arranging for your father to drown
in his own bathtub required more
modern science. Very clever of
Reordon to find a paralytic that
was activated by the combination
of copper and water and was
therefore undetectable once the
bath water was drained.

HOLMES (CONT'D)
That might have been quite
challenging had he not also tested
it on some unfortunate amphibians.
(Standish in rain/
pulling the trigger/
wharf explosion)
The death of Standish was a real
mystery, until you used the same
compound to blow up the wharf. An
odorless, tasteless, flammable
liquid -- yet it burned with an
unusual pinkish hue. Did Standish
mistake it for rain as he entered
your Temple? All it took was a
spark. A simple rigged bullet in
his gun. Ingenious.
(Parliament/flask/
ceremony, dev ice)
Like all great performers you
saved your piece de resistance for
the end. Had it worked, your
followers in Parliament would have
watched unharmed as their
colleagues were dying around them.
They didn't know that you had
given them the antidote -- at one
of your ceremonies I suspect.
Instead, they would have believed
it was magic and that you
harnessed the ultimate power.
END FLASHBACKS.

Blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a
second and is dragged back toward the precipice. Wind
whips harder.
Holmes doesn't notice: The Raven's rope SNAPS, starting
a slow, subtle DOMINO EFFECT IN B.G.: a bucket drops,
hits a row of standing timbers. The timbers start to
topple.
(NOTE: Each time one object strikes another, we hear a
faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale
that Holmes played earlier for his flies.)
HOLMES
You hated your father and the
other members of the Temple of the
Four Orders for what they did to
you. How satisfying it must have
been to use their own system
against them.
IN B.G.: We see the slow, inexorable dominoes continue
to fall. The last timber falls over the edge, lands on a
rope. The rope yanks down a crane, the crane swings,
strikes another crane...
BLACKWOOD
Cut me loose, Holmes!
Blackwood's eyes are full of fear. Holmes thoughtfully
looks out at the angry storm, the atmosphere electric and
dangerous. Holmes gives the slightest hint of a smile.
HOLMES
You better hope that it's nothing
more than superstition as you
performed all the rituals
perfectly.
Holmes looks around at the gathering storm.
Blackwood can hold on no longer. He screams as he
releases his grip and is torn down the walkway at
breakneck speed.
Quick as a snake, Holmes grabs a workman's ax placed on
the side and hurls it at his feet, cutting the rope.
Blackwood's imminent death is brought suddenly to a halt.
The storm grows in ferocity. Holmes bends down,
Blackwood is on his knees, cowed.

HOLMES
First, the world will see you for
what you are. Then you will
hang... properly this time.
Blackwood looks up. CRACK! The crane dislodges a METAL
GIRDER, which misses Holmes by inches as it crashes
through the floorboards --
Blackwood smirks.
BLACKWOOD
We'll see about that shall we.
It's a long journey from here to
the rope.
CREAK.
Holmes looks up.
Blackwood looks up.
HOLMES
We'll see about that shall we.
BANG! The top of the crane crashes down. The wooden
infrastructure supporting Blackwood falls away.
Sending Blackwood falling into a lattice of HANGING
CHAINS below. Blackwood screams as the chains begin to
snap off one by one. He falls farther... and farther...
and finally --
SNAP! The last chain CATCHES, TIGHTENS around
Blackwood's neck, killing him instantly.
Blackwood dangles on the rusty chain, hanged like a
common man after all, with Tower Bridge as his gibbet.
Holmes just stands there, stunned. He looks out to see:
the RAVEN flying away, a silhouette against the stormy
sky. The bird flaps its wings, disappearing into a
cloud.
His brow furrows. Perhaps there really are some things
that cannot be explained.
Holmes looks over the side of the bridge, sees:
IRENE is awkwardly splayed on the lower level. She
appears to be dead, possibly a small trickle of blood is
coming out of her mouth. Holmes moves down to her. He
takes her hand.
HOLMES
Oh, Irene...
His fingers move to take her pulse.

Her eyes pop open.
Irene makes a quick move: she tries to CUFF him.
But
this time, Holmes is ready for it:
He reverses the move, cuffing her instead.
He takes a
seat next to her.
They sit there for a beat, an odd lovers' moment looking
out over the Thames.
IRENE
It looks like rain.
HOLMES
We've still got a moment.
A bit of a smile and break.

Holmes reaches over to grab the key. Their faces close,
near a kiss. Holmes drops the keys down the top of her
shirt (just as she dropped them down his pants). He
snatches the DIAMOND from around her neck, turns and
walks away. She smiles, calls out:
IRENE
You'll miss me, Sherlock.
HOLMES
Sadly, yes.
Holmes walks away, pauses to pick up Watson's sword
stick, keeps walking.
At the end of the top of the stairs.
Holmes hands the

arrogant and insufferable than
ever.
Then Lestrade cracks a smile.
LESTRADE
You're welcome, detective.

Watson shakes Holmes' hand, puts a hand on his arm.
A
warm look, an understanding between the two men.
WATSON
Take care of yourself, Holmes.
Watson moves to the open door of the carriage but Mary
stops him.
MARY
Try not to be too late for dinner
with my parents and... be careful.
She waves to Holmes as the carriage pulls away.
Watson
looks relieved and excited.
HOLMES
Magnificent woman, Watson.
Magnificent!
They climb into Constable Clarke's black mariah which
pulls away down Baker St. We PULL BACK FROM the carriage
WIDE and UP like our opening on Baker Street -- perhaps
the POV of the raven.
FADE OUT.
