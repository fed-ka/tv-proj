The BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us.
We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through:
An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They
bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees--
ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its
destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is
dead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could
scream for a week and no one would hear a thing.
As the van stops--
WE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS:
It would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are
preparing for a "HEAL THE BAY" rally at the end of the pier.
VENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead.
BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE
MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design.
HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand.
FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite.
A short time later, Ryan cruises through a Venice
neighborhood.
Ryan drives an early 70's Ford Bronco; clothes are strewn
across the backseat, and a box of "Heal the Bay" T-SHIRTS now
sits on the shotgun seat.
Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush.
He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing.
Checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa,
and grabs the cellphone.
RYAN
(into phone)
Dex, wassup? You won't believe the
hotties I just met at the pier.
Smoking. You wanna meet them?
Yeah? Well don't get too excited
'cause I need my money.
Ryan stops at a red light.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Bullshit, you're not going
anywhere,
(quickly adding)
I'm pulling up right now.
Some AMBULANCES SPEED BY, SIRENS BLARING.
It's deafening.
Ryan lays on the horn.
When the light changes, Ryan peels
away angrily.
RYAN (CONT'D)
(covering his ear)
What? Yeah, you better be. And I
need your shower, I'm talkin' code
red stankage-
The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan
drives under an OVERPASS.
Suddenly --
The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan
notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car
skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before
hitting the other car's bumper.
He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHED
WITH STATIC.
RYAN (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Dex? You still there...?
And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Damn.

As traffic resumes and Ryan clears the overpass--
ID
iu
SFX:
THE CELLPHONE RINGS.
Ryan picks up the phone.
RYAN
Sorry, got cut off.
Hey -- what's
my Caller ID say?
But there's no voice on the other end, only shuffling sounds.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Yo Dex...?
MATCH CUT TO:

RYAN
If you were really in trouble, you
would've called the cops, not me.
Now I've got a real call on the
other line--
MATCH CUT TO:

The Ford Bronco roars up; snags the handicapped spot. Ryan
hops out and limps theatrically the first few steps until
he's far enough away from the car to start running.
RYAN
(into phone)
I'm here.

Ryan guns the engine as Jessica panics on the other end of
the phone. We can hear her hyperventilating.
\
JESSICA (VO)
Where are you now?!
RYAN
I just got off the 405.
JESSICA (VO)
You've got to go faster, Johnny!
RYAN
You've gotta chill! You're
stressing the crap out of me!
(looking around)
Where the hell is a cop hiding in a
speed trap when you need one?
Ryan takes a hard right, tires squealing.
Pushing it against
his better judgment.
RYAN (CONT'D)
What do these guys want, anyway?
JESSICA (VO)
How should I know?!
RYAN
What do you do?
JESSICA
I'm an obstetrician. They don't
want anything from me.
24.
36

Ryan slaloms around other cars like a racecar driver.
RYAN
So your husband's like, uber-rich?
JESSICA (VO)
What--? No. He's an accountant.
I make more money than he does.
RYAN
Could they've mistaken you for
someone else?
JESSICA
No! I don't know.
None of this
makes any sense.
Jessica starts losing it completely, upsetting Ryan so much
that he takes the next corner too fast and -- SKKRRASH! --
37
37
The BRONCO EXPLODES through an orange-and-white "ROAD CLOSED"
CONSTRUCTION BARRIER!
And dead ahead is a CONSTRUCTION CREW resurfacing the road!
RYAN
Oh...SHIT!!
Ryan SLAMS on the brakes and SWERVES to avoid hitting a group
of workers -- and OBLITERATES THE BRONCO'S PASSENGER SIDE
MIRROR against another BARRIER --
Ryan cringes with every muscle!
And the mirror ricochets off the ground -- and smashes
through the windshield of a recently waxed Acura Legend!
RYAN (CONT'D)
(smirking)
...Ain't that a bitch.
As the heavily-muscled workers start running to beat the shit
out of him, Ryan floors the gas, sending a shower of wet
asphalt all over the cursing workers as he peels away,
CRASHING through a FINAL BARRIER.
More cautiously, Ryan rounds the next corner and --
RYAN (CONT'D)
There's the school.
Ryan's right.
Just ahead, we see:

private prep school for boys. Ryan pull: A private prep

RYAN
Okay, I'm here.
JESSICA (VO)
How much time do we have?
Ryan checks his watch.
It reads:
"1:40 PM".
He enters.
RYAN
Five minutes. What's your kid's name?
JESSICA (VO)
Ricky.
RYAN
Ricky what?
JESSICA
Martin.
RYAN
Ricky Martin? You named your kid
Ricky Martin?! Why didn't you
tattoo "kick me" on his ass while
you were at it?
JESSICA
He was named before the singer ever-
RYAN
Forget it.
What does he look like?
JESSICA (VO)
He's eight years old. Blonde hair.
Green eyes. Small for his age.
He's wearing a light blue shirt and
dark blue pants--
RYAN
They're all wearing blue shirts and
pants!
Ryan turns down a hallway and we see that he's right.
It's
filled with IDENTICALLY-UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS.
As a TIMID BLONDE BOY passes in front of him, Ryan grabs him
and wheels him around.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Ricky Martin?
The Boy's eyes get huge.
He tries to pull away.
TIMID BOY
Don't touch me!
RYAN
No, kid, it's okay!
I didn't mean
to--
26.
38
38
TIMID BOY
Help!
Don't touch me!
Don't touch!!
Ryan quickly moves on... aware that other ADULTS are now
beginning to take notice of him.
RYAN (INTO PHONE)
Does he have anything else? A
jacket? A backpack? What's his
lunch box look like?
JESSICA (VO)
I don't remember.
RYAN
You don't remember your own kid's
lunch box?!
JESSICA
I don't pack it! Rosario, our
housekeeper does! Sometimes Craig,
but...
Jessica begins to sob, which causes Ryan to panic further.
RYAN
Ricky Martin, where are you!?
None of the Stepford kids respond.
JESSICA (VO)
(through tears)
I wish I could give you more.
Now Ryan's running.
He yells into a BATHROOM.
RYAN
Ricky Martin?
MALE VOICE (OS)
Can I help you, sir?
Ryan turns to see a MUSCULAR GYM TEACHER looming there.
Clearly, the guy thinks Ryan's peeping into the boys' room.
RYAN
I'm looking for a little blond boy--
(off his shocked look)
--No, no! Not like that!
GYM TEACHER
Sir, come with me, please!
Ryan isn't going anywhere. And that's when the BELL RINGS.
Like a nightmare, HUNDREDS OF UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS come
racing out of their classes.
RYAN
Oh shit...
27.
38
38
As the boys stampede by, Ryan yanks the WHISTLE from around
the Gym Teacher's thick neck and starts blowing it like
crazy.
GYM TEACHER
HEY--11
RYAN
RICKY MARTIN! DOES ANYONE KNOW
WHERE RICKY MARTIN IS?1 I can't
believe I'm yelling this at an all-
boys school.
All hell is breaking loose. The kids ignore him. The huge
Gym Teacher races after him. Jessica yells in his ear.
JESSICA (VO)
Was that the bell? Was that the
bell?!
RYAN
Yes.
RICKY! RICKY MARTIN!!
Ryan wades through the sea of uniforms.
JESSICA (VO)
He'11 go to the parents' pick-up
spot. Oh God, they're going to get
him!
"\
Ryan turns around and starts bulling through.
The Gym
Teacher violently grabs his arm and yanks--
GYM TEACHER
Where do you think you're going?
--causing the phone to fly out of Ryan's hand and --crack!--
hit the pavement.
RYAN
No--!
Ryan tugs his arm free and races to the phone.
The LCD
display GLASS is cracked into a SPIDERWEB.
RYAN (CONT'D)
(desperate into phone)
Jessica? You still there?!
JESSICA (VO)
Yes?
Relieved, Ryan turns and races for the front of the school.
RYAN
No one's gonna get your kid!
He's
not slow, is he?
JESSICA (VO)
What--?
No!
28.
38
38
RYAN
Then he won't go anywhere with
strangers.
JESSICA (VO)
Unless they have our Escalade. Ricky'11
think it's Rosario and hop right in!
She's got a point. Ryan picks up the pace and arrives at the
pick-up spot. Scans the lot.
RYAN
What color?
JESSICA
Black!
RYAN
(looks)
Of course it is.
PAN AROUND to see what Ryan sees -- three black Cadillac
Escalades.
RYAN (CONT'D)
There's three of them.
What's your
plate?
JESSICA (VO)
4..7..wait, no...3 -- Oh my God, I
don't remember!
RYAN
Like you don't remember the lunch
box? Or anything else about your
kid--
(stops, realizing)
Oh, man. This is a prank, isn't
it?
JESSICA (VO)
No!
RYAN
Bullshit! Oh, you're good lady.
Your friends too. Getting me to
scream out 'Ricky Martin' at a boys
school. Damn, you really nailed
me.
JESSICA (VO)
No--
This is great, the police think I'm
a whack job. The school thinks I'm
some kind of perv child molester.
I'll probably get the Herpes from
the gym teacher's whistle --
29.
38
38
JESSICA (VO)
No, Johnny, you have to listen to
me-- /.'
But Ryan's had enough.
He turns to leave --
RYAN
I'm done being your entertainment for
the day. I'm going back to the pier
while I still have a chance --
-- and passes right by a blonde-haired, green-eyed, EIGHT-
YEAR-OLD BOY carrying a Lord of the Rings lunchbox. Ryan
hesitates and is about to stop the kid...but then decides
"screw it", and keeps on hoofing.
Ryan rounds a corner to leave -- and is confronted by the Gym
Teacher and a RENT-A-COP SECURITY GUARD.
GYM TEACHER
Here he is! He's the one that's
been stalking the students.
RYAN
Stalking?!
No, I can explain--
The Rent-a-Cop mumbles into his walkie.
RENT-A-COP #1
Okay, we got him. We're at the
front of the school.
(then, to Ryan)
Sir, come with us.
RYAN
(as they grab him)
Hey, HEY RENT-A-DUDE--!!
Hang on a
sec! This is a huuuge
misunderstanding--
A little RENT-A-COP CAR (think geeky, wanna-be cop car) pulls
up in the driveway below. The Security Guard starts forcibly
leading Ryan toward it, but as he gets close--
JESSICA (VO)
(interrupting)
Lord of the Rings! I forgot his
father bought him a Lord of the
Rings lunchbox last week!
Ryan's heart stops in his chest. He turns to see the Boy
with the Lord or the Rings lunchbox racing down the school
steps and up to one of the waiting Escalades.
RYAN
(struggling)
RICKY MARTIN!!
The Boy opens the car door...but turns as he hears his name
called. For the briefest moment, Ricky and Ryan lock eyes--
[CONTINUED)
30.
38
38
--and that's when a HAND reaches out, snags his backpack and
YANKS Ricky into the dark of the car! Instantly, the door
slams shut and the Escalade begins to take off.
WHIP PAN to Ryan's shocked reaction. He's the only one who's
seen it. He tries to struggle free of the Guard.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Oh shit!
You just see that?!
Losing control of Ryan, the Rent-a-Cop calls to his partner
in the car.
RENT-A-COP #1
Roy, some help over here!
Below, the Escalade is leaving the driveway.
RYAN
(struggling harder)
Goddamn it, that little kid was
just kidnapped!! Do something!!
RENT-A-COP #1
Roy--! !
The second Rent-a-Cop, hops out of his car and runs over, but
as he gets near -- Ryan breaks free!
^
RENT-A-COPS
HEY--! !
They chase after him, but Ryan hops over the hood of the
idling RENT-A-COP CAR and throws himself into its driver's
seat.
Rent-a-Cop #1 reaches through the open window and grabs
Ryan's collar -- and is dragged twenty feet as Ryan throws
the little car in gear and burns away.
39
41
Cautiously, so as not to give himself away, Ryan PASSES one
commuter car. Then the next. Narrowing the gap between the
rent-a-cop car and the Escalade to one last auto.
It takes Ryan literally standing on the gas pedal to get up
enough speed to get around the final car. Now the Escalade
is dead ahead. Ryan begins gently closing the distance
between them, and is just starting to relax, when--
A CITY BUS
merges into traffic from a Bus Stop right ahead of him!
32.
41
41
RYAN
SHIT!
Ryan SLAMS on his breaks and is forced to crawl along at a
ainful 25 m.p.h.. Worse, he has his view of the Escalade
glocked by the bus' titanic silver ass.
JESSICA (VO)
Johnny!
RYAN
Damn!
There's this stupid bus--
Ryan jags left and right, catching glimpses around the bus of
the Escalade still ahead.
RYAN (CONT'D)
(taps his horn)
Come on!
But the bus doesn't pull over. Ryan tries flashing the
security car's CLEAR BUBBLE LIGHTS on the roof, but who the
hell would pull over for that? The bus sure doesn't.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Jesus.'
JESSICA (VO)
Can't you go around it?
There's an ungodly amount of opposing traffic--
But suddenly there's
a break in the
flow! Seizing the
moment, Ryan SLAM-SH
IFTS the rent-a -cop car's uni-cylinder
engine into gear and
starts to tear
around the bus -- but has
to SWERVE BACK as a
SPEEDING TRASH
TRUCK rounds a bend and
almost creams him!
RYAN
Goddamn it!
JESSICA (VO)
What?!
Did you lose him? !
RYAN
No, I just almost got killed, is
all.
JESSICA
Oh thank God!
RYAN
Thank God?
(irritated)
That's nice.
Just then, the bus signals that it's pulling over.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Hey, here we go!
33.
41
41
As the bus pulls aside, Ryan floors the wanna-be cop car
around it...but directly in front of him is a HOMELESS MAN,
dressed like a sheik, dragging his caravan of TWO COVERED
SHOPPING CARTS.
RYAN (CONT'D)
SON- OF- A-- II
Ryan SLAMS on
the brakes, SWERVES HARD to avoid a collision --
and loses cont
rol of the car! The rent-a-cop car goes POWER
SLIDING across
oncoming traffic, HORNS BLARING AT HIM and
heads straight
for a the FLOOR TO CEILING WINDOW of a CAR
DEALERSHIP.
42
44
The rent-a-cop car exits the dealership, SMASHING through
another GLASS WINDOW!
Ryan quickly regains control of the car and steers it back on
the street. Only to find that the Escalade has disappeared!
JESSICA (VO)
What's happening?! Are you okay?!
RYAN
SHIT I
34.
44
44
JESSICA (VO)
What?!
Yo u lost--
RYAN
No, No!
just give me a second--
As Jessica goes off, Ryan tosses the phone down and focuses
on finding the Escalade. He floors the rent-a-cop car, engine
CLATTERING, to the intersection.
Ryan franticly searches in every direction, but the Escalade
is nowhere to be seen. He floors it.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Jesus!
Where the hell did they go?
Dreading talking to Jessica, Ryan slowly picks up the
receiver.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Jessica, I--
JESSICA (VO)
You let them get away.
Ryan wants to snap at her, but guilt crushes it right out of
him. He knows she's right.
DISSOLVE TO:
j
47
And with that, Ryan CRANKS the steering wheel hard right and
HITS THE GAS!
Despite other drivers' protests, the little
Rent-a-Cop vehicle blasts across the gridlock, TEARS through
the rusty GUARD RAIL and -- VROOOOM! -- flies off the side of
the hill!
Ryan lets out a frightened yell as he SAILS through the clear
blue sky.
RYAN
HOOOOLLYYY SHIIII--
THUMP! The Rent-a-Cop car touches down on a steep downslope.
Ryan struggles to control the bucking automobile,
miraculously avoiding the minefield of ROCKS and TREE STUMPS.
He needs both hands for the job and holds the phone by its
antenna in his teeth.
There's so much noise, the only thing Jessica could possibly
hear is a CACOPHONY OF NOISE and Ryan HYPERVENTILATING.
JESSICA (VO)
What's going on?!
RYAN
(with phone in teeth)
mmmrrmph mrm mrmph!
Ryan is bounced around like a corn kernel in a popper until
the car hits a jutting rock and -- WHOOOOM! -- goes up on two
wheels. It looks like it's going to roll but gravity brings
38.
47
47
it back down -- SLAMM! -- so hard that the phone goes flying
across the car!
RYAN (CONT'D)
Shit!
Ryan scrabbles for the phone -- but gives it up when he
bounces over a rise and sees A BILLBOARD DEAD AHEAD!
RYAN (CONT'D)
WHOAAAAAA!
Ryan whips the wheel and navigates the little car between the
billboard's concrete posts, but -- WHAM! -- obliterates the
rent-a-cop's BUBBLE LIGHTS on the billboard's lower edge.
Somehow, Ryan muscles the bucking econocar safely down the
rest of the hill and into the strip mall parking lot, where
it SKIDS OUT.
RYAN (CONT'D)
(grabbing phone)
Jessica?! Can you hear me?!
JESSICA (VO)
I'm here!
Ryan hops out and races inside--

THE VERIZON WIRELESS STORE - CONTINUOUS

And of course, they're having a sale and the place is packed.
Every SALESPERSON is beyond busy in the feeding frenzy.
SFX:
BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!
Panicking, Ryan pushes his way to the front of the counter --
IRATE CUSTOMERS
Hey, what do you think you're
doing? There's a line!
-- to the OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN helping someone else.
OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN
..and if you get the new Nokia
9200, you can switch out faceplates
to match your mood! And we have a
special today on tiger stripes...
Are you feeling fierce?
The salesman makes a playful paw swipe with his hand.
EASILY-EXCITABLE CUSTOMER
Oh, how fun!
RYAN
Excuse me--
OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN
I'm sorry, sir, I'm with a customer
now.

OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN (CONT'D)

But if you take a number, someone

Ryan glances at the dispenser. A BIG YELLOW SMILEY FACE with
tickets ejected from the mouth. The next ticket it offers is
"#97"...and the Now-Serving Display on the wall reads "#71".
SFX:
BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!I
Just then, a BUSY SALESWOMAN walks by.
Ryan grabs her.
RYAN
Hey! Hey!
I've got an emergency
here --
BUSY SALESWOMAN
Sorry, I'm on break--
RYAN
Damn it, will you listen to me?!
I've got a life and death call on
this phone and my battery's dying!
Do you have a charger?
BUSY SALESMAN
Sure.
(walks away)
Take a number and one of the sales
associates will grab you one when
your turn comes up.

RYAN
Bu t-- !
SFX:
BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!!
Ryan breaks out in a cold sweat. Can't catch his breath. As
a SALESWOMAN rushes by, Ryan reaches for her.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Help, I --
SALESWOMAN
Take a number.
The room starts spinning around him. It's clear no one's
going to help him. Like the clap of doom, the NOW-SERVING
DISPLAY on the wall flips happily to "#72"
SFX:
BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!!
Frantic, Ryan glances at the phone. And just as the last
BATTERY BAR on the power indicator FLICKERS and DISAPPEARS --
RYAN
Aw, screw this...
-- Ryan pulls the rent-a-cop's big .38 SPECIAL from his
pocket and BLOWS THE SMILEY FACE DISPENSER TO DUST!

Instantly, people hit the dirt.

Mooney exits the mayhem of the s

CAR. Gets in. As he pulls his
seatbelt on, something
CRINKLES in his breast pocket.
He pulls it out -- the SCRAP
OF PAPER where the scribbled the
words "JESSICA MARTIN" and
"BRENTWOOD" when Ryan handed him
the phone.
Mooney crumples the paper and is about to throw it away...but
stops himself. He stares at the words, then unable to let it
go, punches keys on the MOBILE DATA TERMINAL. A name and
address appear on the screen:
JESSICA KATE MARTIN.
327 ELMWOOD ESTATES, BRENTWOOD.
Mooney stares at the name. Then, after a moment, he sighs
and pulls a LA LAKERS cellphone from his coat. Dials.
MOONEY
Hi, honey. Yeah, I'm gonna be a

And as Mooney closes the door and starts up the engine--

Ricky plays innocently -- while Hodges now COCKS his pistol.

NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

A PATROL CAR prowls down a quaint residential block. Comes
to a stop in the driveway of what we know to be Jessica
Martin's house. Mooney gets out. Knocks.
The door opens, revealing the ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN from
before.
MOONEY
Ms. Martin?
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
Yes?
MOONEY
Jessica Kate Martin?
The Woman nods. Mooney is plainly disillusioned by the
woman. Maybe his hunch was wrong...
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
Cam I help you, Officer...?
She scans Mooney's badge.

MOONEY
Mooney.

No. No, I guess not. Must've been

The Woman smiles and nods, and Mooney walks off. When he
gets to his car, he CRUMPLES the paper with Jessica's name
and address, and shakes his head, chuckling at himself.
As Mooney drives off--
THE ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
walks back into the house and flips open her CELLPHONE. When
she finishes dialing, a familiar DEEP MALE VOICE answers.

Ryan eyes Simon's mouth while hearing:
SIMON COWELL (VO)
(over Ryan's cellphone)
Murdered your housekeeper? Don't
bullshit me; I work in the Industry
that invented it you stupid COW!
Ryan sees Simon Cowell MOUTH THE WORDS "STUPID COW" in synch
with the conversation. BINGO!
Ryan floors the Rent-a-cop car ahead of the Cadillac and
PULLS A 90 DEGREE turn at an intersection; cutting Cowell
off!
SCREEEECH! Cowell, trying to avoid a collision, SLAMS on the
brakes, causing the Cadillac to SKID twenty feet.
Ryan jumps out of the rent-a-cop car he's left in the middle
or the intersection and runs over to the Cadillac, banging on
the window with the .38 Special.
Cowell practically jumps out of his skin at the sight of the
gun and the kid with the crazy look in his eyes.
SIMON COWELL (CONT'D)
BLOODY HELL!!
RYAN
Give me that phone... or I shoot
your car!
Cowell is prepared to comply -- but suddenly behind them--

THE RENT-A-COP CAR

EXPLODES into tiny pieces of junk as the semi PLOUGHS THROUGH
IT! Flaming debris rains down around Ryan, and he covers his
mouth, unable to believe his shitty luck.

Cowell all but dives out.

It's on speaker!
Ryan turns to the car.
Calls out.
RYAN
Jessica?
JESSICA (VO)
Ryan?!
I'm here!
Her voice says she can't believe her ears.
Relieved, Ryan jumps in the Cadillac XLR and tosses his phone
on the passenger seat, next to a LAPTOP computer. Guns the
engine and STOMPS the gas.
As he passes the ruins of his rent-a-cop car, he slows just
enough to open the Cadillac's door and snatch up his bag of
Verizon goodies laying on the pavement -- then peels away.
Practically frothing at the mouth, Simon Cowell chases after
on foot, cursing as his beautiful new Cadillac disappears in
the distance --
SIMON COWELL
Your career's over!
YOU HEAR ME?!
OVER!

Along with the million other cars, FIND the Cadillac
threading its way up to the main terminal.

Ryan rides back into the city in a cab.
He listens some more, then covers the phone's mouthpiece and
taps the CABBIE on the shoulder.
CRAIG (V.O.)
I dropped it down the mail chute at
work. It's gotta be in the
mailroom.
JESSICA (VO)
(for Ryan's benefit,
weakly)
You hid it downtown?

RYAN
Change of plans.
I need to get to
downtown fast.

Ryan, in the cab, weaves through cars.
RYAN (INTO PHONE)
I'm already on my--
Suddenly, the cab rounds a bend -- and grinds to a halt from
backed up traffic!
RYAN (CONT'D)
You've gotta be kidding me!
(to cabbie)
Can't you back it up?
The cabbie tries, but is hopelessly locked in by cars pulling
up behind him. Shrugs.
About a hundred yards up the road, Ryan sees the 4th
Street/Figuroa Exit. He's so close...
RYAN (CONT'D)
Aw, screw this!
Ryan throws some bills at the driver, hops out the passenger
side and starts RUNNING.
108
108
A short time later, Ryan( drenched in sweat, sees Craig's
office building in the distance --
109
109
With an all cement exterior (and few windows), it's a
cellphone user's nightmare.
110
110
As Ryan huffs and puffs toward the building, he sees a BIKE
MESSENGER bullshitting with a HOT DOG VENDOR. Ryan stops and
stares at the PACKAGE POUCH on the seat and a flashy red BIKE
HELMET hanging on the handlebars.
The helmet is futuristic, like something The Flash might
wear. Ryan eyes the Messenger, grabs the bike, hops on and
peddles for dear life toward Craig's building with the
Messenger hot on his heels.
111
111
As Ryan arrives at the building, the Escalade pulls up in
front of him and Greer, Hodges and Ellis file into the
building.

Ill

Ryan skids to a stop.
Eyes the carrying pouch...
*12
124
Ryan's eyes SCAN the rooftop. Construction is in progress up
here; tarpapering. Huge ROLLS OF TARPAPER lie about,
PALATTES holding supplies covered with TARPS, an industrial
AIR CONDITIONER...
Ryan quickly shoves a 2"x4" under the doorknob to jam it.
Heart pounding, he races to the building's edge and looks
down. Nothing but a straight drop 60 feet down.
Footsteps are approaching! POUNDING on the door! Ryan darts
behind a tarp-covered mass of supplies just as --
125
125
GREER shakes the 2"x4" loose.
He and Hodges explode out onto
the roof, looking for Ryan.
Greer encircles the huge air-conditioner while Hodges hunts
behind a large SATELLITE DISH. No Ryan.
GREER
(to Hodges)
Here.
Cop-instincts crackling, Greer stands on one side of the tarp-
covered stockpile and waits for Hodges to secure the other.
This is it; they signal go at each other and spring around --
But Ryan's nowhere to be found!
GREER (CONT'D)
Dammit!
No, wait! Greer turns and sees a LARGE ALUMINUM CHUTE that
leads from the roof and elbows down toward a DUMPSTER on
ground level.
78.
125
125
Greer peers down the chute for long seconds...but nothing can
be seen from this angle. It all falls to blackness.
THE ALARM STOPS.
Greer cocks his head in the sudden eerie silence. The only
sounds are INCOHERENT SCREAMS coming from the stairwell. He
eyes where the chute empties into the dumpster, thinks...
REVEAL --
126
127
Greer picks up a large roll of tarpaper and starts lugging it
toward the open mouth of the chute...
.28

GREER watches amazed when Ryan actually tumbles out of the
ass-end of the metal chute into the dumpster. He drops the
next roll of tarpaper ready to go and reaches for his gun --

RYAN is in serious pain.
He frantically fishes through the
refuse to find:
SIMON COWELL'S CELLPHONE
Or rather, what's left of it:
A million shattered pieces
scattered everywhere.
Ryan sifts through the plastic debris as if he had secretly
hoped he could still use it. Yeah, right... He's barely able
to sit up when --
BLAM!! BLAM!! BLAM!!
He ducks back down as bullets ricochet off the steel
dumpster.
As SIRENS get louder, closer, Ryan's got to make his move --
he jumps out of the dumpster, landing on his ass on the
opposite side of Greer.
BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!!
Bullets ricochet off the steel dumpster and Ryan summons his
courage -- and takes off limping!
135
135
BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!! Greer's pistol is ill equipped for long-
range shooting. The kid's too far away by now. He grabs his
walkie --
GREER
(into walkie)
The kid's outside, headed toward
the front of the building--
HODGES
-Gotta go, boss. The Guard's dead.
Hodges waits by the rooftop door, looking concerned
as COPS spill out around him onto the roof.
COPS
Who the hell's shooting up here?
Greer points to Ryan bolting around the corner.
GREER
Sonofabitch shot the poor bastard
right in front of us!

A gold FORD TAURUS pulls up in front. The driver door opens

But this time, there's no answer.
Mooney rings the bell. Still nothing. Suspicious, he checks
around the side...and sees the back door SWAYING in the wind.

Ryan wanders the streets. Checks his wallet -- a measly four
bucks. Despair overtakes him and he almost gets CRUSHED as a-
TOW TRUCK speeds by -- An old Hyundai mounts it like a hippo!
A lightbulb clicks on for Ryan.
RYAN
Ho - shit!
Ryan bolts to the nearest BUS STOP just as a BLUE LINE BUS
pulls up.

Jessica SMASHES A REAR WINDOW with a long thick branch and
uses it to try to pry the bars apart. The limited leverage
won't enable her to bend them enough for Ricky to squeeze

RICKY

And just then--
SFX: GRAVEL CRUNCHING IN THE DRIVEWAY
Jessica leans her head around the back corner of the
guesthouse -- and sees the Escalade pulling in!

JESSICA
(to Ricky)
Get down! Get down!
And Jessica DUCKS OUT OF VIEW just as the--
143
143
Pulls into the driveway.
Greer and his team are going over surveillance photos taken
from the cameras at the Fegan Securities Building. The
hotos are useless, though, as Ryan's face is obscured by his
E helmet and visor.
GREER
These are the best pictures you
could get of him?!
ELLIS
He was wearing a visor.
Greer glares at him -- no shit -- and throws the pictures .
GREER
Useless!
The car parks and Greer storms out, followed by Ellis and
Hodges. They head for the house, and the moment they enter --
Jessica reappears. But now she's STARING at something.
The Escalade.
JESSICA
(to son; through window)
Baby, listen to me. I want you to
get away from this window. I want
you to go to the other side of the
room as far away from the door as
you can --
RICKY
No, don't leave me!
Don't leave
me!!
The terror in his voice breaks Jessica's heart.
JESSICA
Honey, I'm getting you out of
there!
RICKY
Where are you going?!
JESSICA
I'm only gonna be gone a second,
and then we're gonna go home, but
you have to do this first. It's
gonna be loud, but don't be scared,
okay? Now go find somewhere safe
like I told you.

Mooney watches other PARAMEDICS carry sheet-covered corpses
into awaiting ambulances. Flashbulbs POP from inside.
A sedan pulls up and Mooney's relieved to see Tomlin get out.
DETECTIVE TOMLIN
What the hell, Moon? It's all over
the radio.
MOONEY
Jack, she didn't identify herself.
DETECTIVE TOMLIN

Dana Bayback. From the 23rd.
She
was one of the kidnappers.
Tomlin looks stunned by the revelation.
DETECTIVE TOMLIN
Let me call the tw9~three. See

Tomlin pulls out a cellphone.
MOONEY

involved, but--
DETECTIVE TOMLIN

MOONEY

Detective Tomlin frowns.

A GONZOLEZ TOW TRUCK drives up (like the one we saw at the
airport), and stops temporarily beside:
Simon Cowell, from the CADILLAC XLR incident, who stands at
the window, screaming at the JADED CASHIER.
His car idles just on the other side of an IMPOSING FENCE.
SIMON COWELL
Just give me my goddamned car!
JADED CASHIER
Don't take that tone of voice with
me, sir. I've already told you, we
do not release vehicles until all
impound fees are paid.
In the E.G., NOTICE Ryan skulking closer, behind the GONZALEZ
AUTO TOW TRUCK.
SIMON COWELL
But I didn't cause it to get
impounded! Can't you understand
that?! It was stolen from me!
JADED CASHIER
Sir, do you want the car back or
not?
Noticing Cowell standing at the window, Ryan presses further
into the shadows, not wanting to be noticed.
SIMON COWELL
Yes!
But I'm not paying for it!
The Cashier signals a GRUNGY YARD WORKER on the other side of
the fence.
JADED CASHIER
Nevermind, Howie. Take 'er back.
Howie nods, and just as he's about to drive the Cadillac back
into the yard --
SIMON COWELL
Wait, wait! All right you bloody
fascist, I'll pay. But if there's
even the slightest scratch on it...
Howie smiles, thought so, gets out and splits. As Cowell
angrily starts making out a check, the Cashier flicks the
switch to open the gate, and as it opens--
Ryan slips in. He sneaks behind the wheel of the idling
Cadillac. And the moment Cowell hands over his check --
VRRRROOOM!!
Ryan burns rubber out of there.

SIMON COWELL (CONT'D)
Hey, that's my car!
Cowell chases it -- and watches in horror as Ryan takes a
speed bump too fast and TEARS THE REAR BUMPER OFF THE
CADILLAC XLR CONVERTIBLE IN AN EXPLOSION OF SPARKS!
SIMON COWELL (CONT'D)
NOooooooo...!!
146
146
As he zooms away, Ryan searches the passenger seat with his
free hand. He hunts through the car and finds -- HIS BLUE
TOOTH VIDEO CELL PHONE!
RYAN
Thank you!
As he flips it open, his eyes spot THE LAPTOP on the floor of
the passenger seat.
Ryan thinks, pulls out his SECURITY DVD and pops it in.
At first, the SCREEN is a mere wash of digital gobbledygook--
And as Ryan grunts with frustration --
--a Hi-Res QUICKTIME MOVIE suddenly fills the screen:
47
ANGLE ON LAPTOP MONITOR - FOUR WAY SPLIT SCREEN

The Fagen Securities Building parking lot. A police pursuit
in progress. Three Police Cars skillfully box in a BMW with
TWO HISPANIC YOUTHS, forcing it to come to a dead stop.
GREER and HODGES explode from their cars, guns drawn.
BAYBACK and ELLIS come from the back. DEASON appears, and he
and HODGES yank the teens out of the car, who struggle
frantically to avoid vicious baton blows. When one decks
Hodges and tries to run, ELLIS SHOOTS HIM in the back!
WE QUICKLY PAN TO ANOTHER ANGLE:
Inside the building, CRAIG gets up from his chair, hurries

And as BAYBACK drags a DEAD HISPANIC YOUTH out of the frame,
legs disappear off-screen in short bursts.
PAN DIAGONALLY TO ANOTHER ANGLE:
And more terrifying, GREER stops picking up shell casings,
turning his head ominously toward the CAMERA! Noticing us!
Greer motions to several others; DEASON and BAYBACK, who rush
OUT OF FRAME toward the front entrance.
ANGLE ONE: At the SIDE DOOR, ELLIS and HODGES start kicking
in the door with full force.
ANGLE TWO: GREER, outside, unholstering his GUN at the

Ricky, please!
Somehow, the kid digs deep and finds the courage to run to
the Escalade, where his mother scoops him up into the cab
just as--
The kitchen door bursts open and Greer's team spills out into
the yard. They spot her instantly.
ELLIS
Get out of the car!
Get out of the
goddamned car!!
As they rush at her--
163
163
Jessica throws the big car in reverse and tries to back out --
but the Escalade's stuck! Caught by the debris, the wheels
just spin.
JESSICA
Come on!
COME ON!!
Jessica rocks the car forward, and back. Forward, and back.
And just as it finally comes loose -- KRRRAAASHHH!!
The window next to Jessica's head EXPLODES in a shower of
tempered glass, shocking us. Two arms snake in and wrap
around Jessica's neck. Greer.
But Jessica STOMPS ON THE GAS, hoping the big car will pull
her free.
It doesn't. As the Escalade surges away across the lawn,
Greer's vice-like grip holds, PULLING JESSICA OUT the broken
window and -- THUMP! -- to the guest house debris below.
As Jessica watches in horror:
THE DRIVERLESS ESCALADE
Careens down the driveway and crashes into a pillar.

Seething mad, Greer rips his gun from its holster and is
literally about to blow Jessica's brains out when--
SFX:
THE CORDLESS PHONE IN GREER'S POCKET STARTS RINGING!
The entire world stops. There's an awkward moment: Jessica
cowering, Greer recovering, the phone just ringing and
ringing... The telephone is the only sound in the world,
getting louder and louder with each ring until--
Greer answers it.
GREER
Bad timing, Tomlin.

And Ryan hangs up. He waits nervously, sweating, staring at
the phone for the longest seconds of his life--
RYAN (CONT'D)
Ring.
C'mon, damn it, ring!
RING!
Then it does. Ryan waits a couple rings, slowing his
speeding heart, then nonchalantly picks up.
GREER
So, how do you want to do this?
RYAN
Put on a big ass Ronald McDonald smile,
apologize to the kid and the woman and
bring 'em to the Santa Monica pier.

GREER wrestles with his better judgment--
RYAN
Three...
Four...
--but Ryan's got him by the balls.
Angrily, Greer lifts his
walkie.
GREER
Okay! Okay.
(into walkie)
Hodges, put 'em on the Ferris
wheel.
HODGES (VO)
What? I
GREER
Shut up and do it!
RYAN
Not bad. Most people never get
past two.
Greer flinches as his own taunts are used against him.
GREER
(to Ellis)
Keep an eye on them. As soon as we
make the trade, take the woman and
her kid out.

RYAN watches from a distance as Hodges exits the van.
GREER (VO)
Don't screw me kid, y9u won't live
long enough to enjoy it.
RYAN
Oooh, I think I just pissed myself.
Ryan looks optimistic when Hodges gets out and opens the back
door. And just as he's on the brink of success--
FEMALE VOICE (OS)
HEY--!
102.

A woman's HAND grabs the hood of Ryan's windbreaker and rips
it away from his face. Wheels him around. It's:
CHLOE
There you are! Where the hell were
you! ?
RYAN
Chloe!
Get away from here!
CHLOE
Know how many hours I waited for
you to bring back those stupid
shirts?! What'd you do? Sell them
on the Prominade yourself--?
But Ryan's got no time for this.
RYAN
GO!
NOW!!

A sickly-looking MOONEY glances at the commotion -- and sees
the hoodless Ryan.
MOONEY
(motioning to Tomlin)
That's him! There he is!

Ryan desperately tries to shoo Chloe away.
RYAN
It isn't safe to talk, get it? I --
People are after me!
CHLOE
(shrugs free)
What -- are you high?
Suddenly, Mooney steps up beside Ryan and grabs him.
MOONEY
(winded)
I've been..looking for..you, kid--
But Ryan struggles, thinking Mooney is with the bad guys.
Mooney grabs him as he tries to make a break for it.
RYAN
Let go of me! Sonofabitch, let go!

Instantly, Greer jams the walkie to his face, and we--

RYAN struggles with Mooney. The crowd completely ignores
them in favor of the raucous concert.
In the heat of battle, Ryan's cellphone clatters by Chloe' s
feet.
MOONEY
(sweating profusely)
Jesus, kid, calm down!!
Trying to break Mooney's stronghold, Ryan SHOVES him
backwards, SLAMMING his injured shoulder into the PIER
RAILING.
Mooney SCREAMS out in pain and grabs his shoulder, releasing--
Ryan, who BREAKS AWAY and turns to see Mooney COLLAPSE to the
ground, holding his blood-soaked shoulder. Ryan looks over
to Chloe, whose face is a combination of shock and confusion.
CHLOE
Oh my God--
(checking Mooney)
Someone call 911!
A CROWD starts to gather when --
Ryan feels the barrel of a gun nudging his back.
Tomlin's
gun.
TOMLIN
It's over kid.
Fuck! Ryan's got no choice but to slowly walk toward the end
of the pier.
MOONEY - From his prone position, he catches a glimpse of
Tomlin backing Ryan quietly into the crowd. Not trying to
help. Not calling for an ambulance. In that instant, Mooney
knows he's been betrayed. Tomlin's in on this.

TOMLIN (CONT'D)
For all the trouble you've caused,
you'd better have that goddamned
disc. Where is it?
Just then, Greer appears through the crowd ahead of him.
Like a nightmare, he closes in.
Ryan slowly slips his phone into a waterproof pocket in his
windbreaker and zips it up.
RYAN
Aw shit...
Ryan's world is spinning -- the NOISE, the CROWDS, the
TENSION...
He KICKS BACK hard into Tomlin's SHIN. It is enough for
Tomlin to release his grip and Ryan bolts.
Tomlin recovers and raises his GUN to get a bead on Ryan, but
it causes the crowd around him to PANIC.
CROWD GOER (OS)
Dude's gotta gun!
Ryan navigates through the fleeing crowd and turns to see
Greer and Tomlin quickly gaining ground.
He has to make a choice, either go over the railing, or deal
with Greer and Tomlin. Ryan decides on the ocean. He runs
to a MAN FISHING WITH HIS SON and uses their ice chest as a
step. Just as he JUMPS THE RAIL -- Tomlin gets off a SHOT!
SLIIIIIICEE!!! The bullet tears through Ryan's shoulder as
he spins headlong into the Pacific!
TOMLIN AND GREER run to the railing and see Ryan HIT the
CHOPPY WATER below.
GREER
Under the pier. Go! Go!

UNDERWATER POV

Ryan flails, panicking, exhaling all his air and sucking in
the dark water of the ocean --
187
UNDERWATER
187
Ryan is struggling. Bleeding. Sinking. Dying. His lungs
convulse, trying to breathe, burning like a thousand red-hot
needles are pushing their way through his chest.
The WAVES POUND against the thick pylons below the pier. Just
as Ryan comes up for air he's SLAMMED into a wooden pylon!
Ryan fights for his life as the surge churns him underwater,
BASHING him repeatedly against the pillars. It's not pretty.

As he struggles toward the shore, he's constantly thrown back
and forth underwater like a rag doll.

TOMLIN races down the pier towards the beach --
GREEK aims his weapon at the ocean, daring Ryan to surface.

Ryan finally makes it to shore; coughing, retching. He crawls
up the sand, out of breath, blood trailing behind him.
He unzips the waterproof pocket of his shorts, pulling out
the cellphone, which thank God is actually dry. Ryan forces
himself into action; stumbling, exhausted into a --

TOMLIN - racing through the sand under the pier. He spots
Ryan's bloody footprints and follows them toward the --

Chloe hands Mooney a cup of water and frantically looks
around for the paramedics. Mooney starts rising to his feet.
CHLOE
You better lie still. The
paramedics should be here shortly.
But Mooney's obstinate.
He rises despite her best efforts.

MOONEY
Just keep that ambulance close by.
And as he stumbles off--

Greer pulls out his ringing cell phone. On the text screen
it says, "CALL HIM". Greer flashes an wicked grin, and dials
the last number on his call log.
CUT TO:

RYAN - losing blood, he does his best to move quickly through
the sand. He stumbles, but regains his footing as he makes
his way towards the STAIRS LEADING UP TO THE PIER.

He's in the parking lot.

POLICE CRUISERS race down the pier bridge, desperately trying
to avoid the fleeing crowd.

ELLIS (OS)
He's heading for the cops.
We
should do it now.
Mooney looks to the roof of the carousel and sees Ellis.

MOONEY
""Freeze! Drop your weapon!
Ellis quickly swings his rifle and--
BAM! Mooney shoots Ellis in the head, causing him to slide

RYAN - stopping in his tracks, looks in the direction of the
gun shot. He turns around only to find --
A PISTOL pointed right at his face -- Greer's pistol.
He PUSHES Ryan behind a SUV so as not to be seen by the cops.
GREEK
No more bullshit!
Just give me the
goddamn disc!
Ryan slowly unzips his front jacket pocket and removes the
DVD.
Greer snatches it and SMASHES it to pieces. Fragments fall
through the cracks in the pier, to the ocean below.
Ryan, pale as ghost, knows he's seconds from meeting his
maker.
GREER (CONT'D)
This is about to be the most
enjoyable part of an extremely
shitty day.
And just as he's about to pull the trigger --
BLAM!! Jessica fires a WARNING SHOT. Greer( startled, spins
around to see Jessica pointing Hodges' gun in his face.
JESSICA
Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.
For the first time, Greer actually looks frightened.
Recognizing the homicidal look in her eyes, he SPUTTERS, but
nothing comes out.
Ryan, weak and pale with blood loss, looks up at his guardian
angel.
RYAN
Jess... Jessica?
Don't.
Jessica trembles with rage, a tear falls.
JESSICA
I... I have to.

MOONEY (O.S.)
Lower the weapon, Jessica.

Jessica looks behind her and sees Mooney, surrounded by EIGHT
POLICE OFFICERS.
MOONEY (CONT'D)
(trying to reason with
her)
Ricky's safe. It's all going to be
okay. Put it down.
Jessica slowly lowers the gun and looks into Ryan's face.
JESSICA
Thank you for keeping your promise.
As the cops move in and drag Greer to his feet, Ryan calls
out to him.
RYAN
Hey man, your shitty day is about
to get a whole lot shittier.
Ryan flips open his phone and on the SCREEN plays the
SECURITY FOOTAGE of the murder in the parking lot. We see
that Ryan must've copied the DVD with his videophone.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Ain't that a bitch?
And through the tears, Jessica manages a laugh. A small one.
But enough to let us know everything's going to be okay. And
as we PULL BACK on the scene--
DISSOLVE TO:
