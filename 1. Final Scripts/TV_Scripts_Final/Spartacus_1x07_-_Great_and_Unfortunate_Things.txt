  FADE IN:


  INT. HUT - THRACIAN VILLAGE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  SURA and THE THRACIAN (Spartacus) fall back into bed, both 
  breathing hard -- and smiling the type of smile that only 
    earthshaking sex can elicit.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                                  laughs)(
                        That was... vigorous.

                                        SURA
                        You seem the kind of man that could 
                        take it.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        I am rather rugged...

  She laughs as he kisses her, his hands exploring, gearing up 
  for Round Two. She responds, then suddenly breaks off and 
  slips out of bed.

                                        SURA
                        The hour is late. Father will be 
                        worried.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                      As well he should be...

  He reaches for her, trying to pull her back to bed. She 
  laughs, moving out of reach to pull on her clothes.

                                        SURA
                        I have to go.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                      If you do, my heart will break.

  She pauses, considering.

                                        SURA
                        Ask me to stay.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Stay.

                                        SURA
                        Ask me. By my name.

  The Thracian hesitates. He obviously doesn t know it. Sura 
  laughs, far from angry.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    2.

                        You do not even know it, do you?

  The Thracian grins, caught.

                                          SURA(cont'd)
                        Sura. My name is Sura.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Sura.

  He likes the feel of that on his tongue.

                                        THE THRACIAN(cont'd)
                      As beautiful as the woman herself. 
                      My name is --

                                        SURA
                        Every woman knows who you are. And 
                      to avoid you.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        That bad, am I?

                                        SURA
                        The worst.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                                  frowns)(
                        Then why lay with a man of such ill 
                        reputation?

                                        SURA
                        Because the gods led me to your 
                        bed.

  The Thracian laughs.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        The gods?

                                        SURA
                        They come to me.  In my dreams.  
                        They showed me the man you could 
                        become.

  Spartacus takes that in with a wry grin.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Could?

                                        SURA
                      If set upon the proper path.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.
  CONTINUED:

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        And what else did the gods tell you 
                        about my future?

  She pauses at the flap to his hut. Radiant in the light, a 
  soft, confident smile bending her lips.

                                        SURA
                        That you will never love another 
                        woman.

  She slips out into the night. OFF THE THRACIAN, his own 
  smile taking hold...


  INT. SPARTACUS  CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON SURA S LIFELESS FACE as a hand gently brushes a 
  stray lock of hair aside. POP WIDE to reveal

  SPARTACUS,

  grief stricken as he prepares Sura s body for the pyre. He 
  pulls out the PURPLE BINDING, kisses it, then places it in 
  her hands folded across her chest. He pulls a WHITE SHROUD 
  over her body, WIPING US TO --


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus carries Sura s shrouded body towards a pyre in the 
  center of the square. VARRO stands beside it with a torch. 
  DOCTORE and the GLADIATORS ring the square. BATIATUS, 
  LUCRETIA, and NAEVIA watch from the balcony.

  SPARTACUS

  gently places Sura s body onto the pyre. Varro solemnly 
  hands him the torch. Spartacus gazes at his wife for one 
  last anguished moment. He lights the pyre.

  DOCTORE

  stands stoically at the edge of the square. Despite his 
  sympathy, he has not forgotten Spartacus  betrayal of 
  drugging his wine (from episode 106).

  PIETROS

  stares sadly at the flames. His heart heavy with loss now 
  that Barca is gone.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.
  CONTINUED:

  GNAEUS

  glances at Pietros, a hungry look filling his eyes.

  ASHUR

  chews seeds as he looks on from the shadows.

  BATIATUS AND LUCRETIA

  gaze down from the balcony. Lucretia glances at her husband, 
  privy to the secret that Sura s blood stains his hands. But 
  his attention never strays from the pyre, his eyes 
  unreadable as the light from the flames plays across his 
  face.

  BACK TO SPARTACUS,

  his eyes full of tears. His wife, his reason for living -- 
  gone. SLOW PUSH IN ON SPARTACUS as the flames rise, 
  consuming his heart...


  INT. BATH - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  CLOSE ON A POOL as a steady stream of water fills it. 
    Bloodstained hands dip into it. ADJUST to find Spartacus, 
  alone, mechanically washing his wife s blood from his hands.

                                        BATIATUS (O.S.)
                        The heart weighs heavy.

  Spartacus looks up to find Batiatus has entered.

                                        BATIATUS
                      So much hope in reunion. To come to 
                        such bitter end...

                                          SPARTACUS
                        How is it so?

                                        BATIATUS
                                  a beat, soft)(
                        The fault lies with me.

  Spartacus stares at him in surprise. But instead of 
  confessing, Batiatus spins.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        The road traveled from Neapolis is 
                        known to be treacherous. I should 
                        have doubled the guards. Tripled 
                        them. I should have delayed 
                                        (MORE)

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        granting Barca his freedom and sent 
                        him along as well. I pray the gods 
                        forgive my error.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        No.

  Anger flares in Spartacus  eyes. Batiatus tenses -- but 
  Spartacus turns away.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        There is nothing for you to pray 
                        for. You kept your word. The fault 
                        lies with the men who took her 
                        life. And with Claudius Glaber, who 
                        condemned her to slavery.

                                        BATIATUS
                        There is nothing to be done to 
                        change what has passed. We must 
                        look towards the future. You are 
                        the Bringer of Rain. The Slayer of 
                        Death. Together we will etch the 
                        name Spartacus into the pillars of 
                        history.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  soft)(
                        Spartacus. That is not what she 
                        called me. It is not my name.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  a beat)(
                      It is now.

  Batiatus turns and exits. OFF Spartacus as he sits by the 
  bath, empty and truly alone...


  INT. OFFICE CHAMBER - BATIATUS  VILLA - NIGHT

  COINS spill across Batiatus  desk. ADJUST to find AULUS, the 
  driver of Sura s cart, as he scoops them up.

                                        AULUS
                        Nearly a year you have me search 
                        for the Thracian woman. Why have me 
                        end her life short of the mark?

  He looks up at Batiatus.

                                        BATIATUS
                      An unfortunate necessity.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.
  CONTINUED:

  Lucretia appears in the doorway.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        I trust the sum sufficient?

                                        AULUS
                                  nods)(
                      If other  necessities  arise, 
                        consider me your man.

  He bows slightly before exiting. Lucretia watches him go, 
  concerned.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        A large expense, to have her 
                        delivered all but dead. You could 
                        just as easily have told Spartacus 
                        she had perished abroad.

  Batiatus pours two cups of wine.

                                        BATIATUS
                        She was his life. The heart beating 
                        beneath his chest. No. Such a man 
                        would not believe her gone, unless 
                        his own eyes told him it was so. It 
                        was the only course.

                                        LUCRETIA
                                  taking the wine)(
                        One you could have told me you were 
                        undertaking.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I would keep such blood from your 
                        hands, as I have said.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        They hold yours. Are they not 
                        stained by the touch?

                                        BATIATUS
                        There has been too much death of 
                        late. I would turn towards more 
                        respectable ventures. With his wife 
                        removed from thought, I will mold 
                        Spartacus into a gladiator the 
                        likes of which the world has never 
                        seen. He has already defeated 
                        Theokoles. Imagine what he will 
                        accomplish once his mind has been 
                        focused on nothing but victory.

                        You will be the greatest lanista in 
                        all the Republic.

                                        BATIATUS
                        And on that title we shall climb 
                        beyond our station. Beyond Capua. 
                        Perhaps to the very steps of the 
                        senate itself...

  OFF Batiatus, dreaming of such a day...


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON CRIXUS. Unconscious, tormented by fever. POP WIDE 
  to reveal Doctore looming over him. He casts a concerned 
  look to the MEDICUS, who mixes herbs into a paste.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The fever grips him.

                        Yet he lives. For the moment.

                                          DOCTORE
                        I would know if his condition 
                        changes.

                                          MEDICUS
                        You and everyone else.

  The Medicus applies the paste to Crixus  wounds. Doctore 
  lingers for a moment, turns to leave.


  INT. CORRIDOR - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Doctore moves down the corridor. Pietros falls in step.

                                          PIETROS
                        A word, Doctore.

  Doctore nods.

                                          PIETROS(cont'd)
                        The birds, left in Barca s cell. 
                        What should I do with them?

                                          DOCTORE
                                  absently)(
                        Whatever you wish.

  Pietros nods, his heart obviously broken.

                                          PIETROS
                      He told me we would release them. 
                        When he gained our freedom.

  Doctore pauses.

                                          DOCTORE
                      He intended your freedom as well?

                                          PIETROS
                        That was his purpose in speaking 
                        with Dominus. Ashur said the price 
                        was too high for us both.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Ashur?

                                          PIETROS
                      He helped negotiate the sum.
                                  tentative)(
                        Would it be all right if I kept 
                        them? The birds?

                                          DOCTORE
                      It would not cause notice.

  Pietros forces a sad smile, turns and disappears down the 
  corridor. OFF Doctore, watching him go...


  INT. BARCA S CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  TIGHT ON A PIGEON in a cage being fed bits of stale bread. 
  POP WIDE to reveal Pietros kneeling by the cage, tears 
  filling his eyes. A SOUND pulls his attention to the 
  doorway. GNAEUS

  looms there. Pietros eyes him with fear. Gnaeus grins with 
  lust. He moves in, his sweaty body WIPING US TO --


  INT. SPARTACUS  CELL - NIGHT

  Spartacus sits in his cell, NUMERIUS  THRACIAN KNIFE (from 
  106) in his hand. A beat as he numbly considers the blade.

                                        VOICE (O.S.)
                        That is unwise.

  Spartacus looks up to find Varro in the doorway.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    9.

                        it...

                                          SPARTACUS
                        What could they do to me, that 
                        hasn t already been done?

  Varro has no response. A beat.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        I never should have left her.

                                        VARRO
                        You did not leave her. She was 
                        taken from you.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Before Glaber and the Romans. 
                        Before I went to war. She asked me 
                        not to go. Instead I prattled on 
                        about blood and honor.

                                        VARRO
                        You did what you thought was right. 
                      To protect her.

  Spartacus barely hears him, lost in his own grief.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                                  re: knife)(
                        You should toss that over the 
                        cliff. Best to be done with such 
                        thoughts.

  A long beat. Spartacus doesn t look up.

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  soft)(
                        I never should have left her.

  There s nothing Varro can say. OFF the anguished moment...


  INT. BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  The villa is bustling with WORKERS and SLAVES. They hang 
  expensive FABRICS and place new STATUES. An ebullient 
  Batiatus strolls through the chaos with Lucretia.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.

                        Careful with that! It costs more 
                        than your worth.

                        They will need to stand in line...

  Naevia hustles in with the Medicus in tow. Lucretia breaks 
  from the kiss, tenses with dread.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Crixus...?

  OFF Lucretia s concern...


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Crixus, weak and his brow slick with sweat, tries to sit up. 
  He grunts in pain.

                                          MEDICUS
                        I told you to lay still!

  The Medicus rushes over, Batiatus and Lucretia trailing him. 
  Naevia stays a respectful distance back.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Best to heed the advice. For a 
                        while we thought you for the 
                        afterlife.

                        Not all of us.

  Crixus spots Naevia, who lights his soul with a subtle 
  smile. He returns it, making it appear intended for 
  Lucretia.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    11.

                                          MEDICUS
                        The injuries are severe. The fact 
                        that he lives is miracle in itself.

  That dampens the mood. Lucretia forces a smile.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I fear you underestimate the man.

                        crowd will one day again roar the 
                        name Crixus!

  He glances at the Medicus, his eyes revealing concern.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        A word.

  Batiatus moves off into the corridor to consult with the 
  Medicus. Lucretia takes the opportunity to slide in closer 
  to Crixus, whispering in his ear.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It would be improper for me to 
                        visit you in the ludus. But know my 
                        thoughts are with you.

  She glances at Batiatus and the Medicus to make sure they 
  aren t looking, steals a quick kiss. Naevia tries not to 
  react.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        I will send Naevia often to attend 
                        your needs.

  He smiles in thanks, catching Naevia s eye. The joy of the 
    unintentional excuse for them to be together barely 
  concealed. Batiatus finishes with the Medicus.

  She exits, Naevia following. OFF Crixus, his smile giving 
  way to the crushing reality of his injuries...


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Spartacus stands at the cliff, looking out across the hills 
  with heavy heart. Behind him the MEN assemble for the day s 
  training.

  VARRO

  eyes Spartacus from across the square, deeply affected by 
  his friend s loss. Ashur limps past.

                                        VARRO
                        Ashur? A word.

                                        ASHUR
                        Couple it with coin and make it a 
                        sentence.

                                        VARRO
                        I would see a message delivered to 
                      my wife.

  Ashur glances at Spartacus.

                                        ASHUR
                        The Thracian s loss stirs you to 
                        letters. Ten sesterci will see it 
                        placed in her hands.

                                        VARRO
                        Ten?

                                        ASHUR
                        Five would also see it along. 
                        Eventually.

  Varro frowns in acceptance. ACROSS THE SQUARE, Pietros 
  hustles up to Spartacus with twin practice swords.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    13.

                        Your swords for practice, Champion.

  Spartacus takes them, pauses as he sees Pietros now sports a 
  bruised cheek and a busted lip. Pietros looks away in shame. 
  Doctore breaks the moment with a crack of his whip.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The day s training begins. Pair up!

  Pietros hustles off the sand as men move to comply. Varro 
  heads for Spartacus.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Spartacus! I am your man.

                        Sword and shield!

  The men register that with interest. Varro shoots Spartacus 
  a worried look. Pietros hands Doctore a practice sword and 
  shield. Doctore locks eyes with Spartacus as he moves into 
  position.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                                  sincerely)(
                        Your wife s passing. It was an 
                        unfortunate thing.

  Spartacus nods, too filled with the grief of it to respond.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                      As was your plan for escape.

  Doctore attacks, the brutality of the assault driving 
  Spartacus back. Varro and the men can t help but glance over 
  during their own sparring. Spartacus recovers. The two men 
  circle each other, eyes burning, voices harsh whispers.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        I have not tasted wine for many 
                        years. Yet a single cup would not 
                        rob me of my senses.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The choice was to see you sleep... 
                      Or never awaken.

  Doctore attacks. Blows are traded, each man drawing blood. 
  They part, circling. Doctore wipes blood from his lip.

                        Then part lips and see it done!

  Spartacus attacks, rage flashing across his anguished face. 
  The two men exchange thunderous blows.  They end up in a 
  stalemate, their swords both raised to crack each other's 
  skull.  A frozen beat.

                                          DOCTORE

                        had best kill me.

  Doctore turns his back on Spartacus and walks away.  OFF 
  Spartacus, his rage draining away, replaced by crushing 
  grief... and regret that he was forced to betray Doctore...


  INT. BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  Batiatus greets MERCATO, the rich patron from ep. 103. 
  Workers and slaves are still working on the villa.

                        affairs completed before your

                        reenact Rome s victory over the 
                        Maedi, the Thracian tribe that 
                        dared invade Macedonia. They were

  INT. MESS HALL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Gnaeus laughs at a table with RHASKOS, HAMILCAR, and a knot 
  of other sweaty men. Spartacus sits alone at another table, 
  absently eating his midday meal. Varro joins him, eyeing 
  Doctore who passes from the hall.

                                        VARRO

                        Yet.

  Gnaeus brays, pulling Pietros onto his lap as he passes with 
  the water jug, causes him to spill it. Pietros squirms, 
  making Gnaeus laugh even harder.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Pietros. Bring more water

  The laughter dies out. Gnaeus stares at Spartacus, a  fuck

                        Now.

  Gnaeus hesitates, releases the boy with a sneer. Pietros 
  exits. Spartacus goes back to his meal, eating without 
  thought or enjoyment.

                                        VARRO

  Spartacus glances at Varro. Varro responds delicately,

  recent loss.

                        message herself.

  Ashur indicates towards the front gate. Varro s wife 
  AURELIA, a young beauty in her early 20s, stands nervously 
  with a Guard. In her arms is Varro s 2-year-old son JANUS. 
  Varro rushes to them, kissing his wife and swinging his son 
  up into his arms.

  Ashur hobbles off, not at all touched. Spartacus takes in 
  the reunion, eyes filling with sadness for the family he 
  will never have. He rises to leave, his body WIPING US TO --

  Aurelia eyes her surroundings nervously.

  Varro half smiles, not comprehending. His eyes drop to her 
  flat belly. His smile quickly follows.

  Janus starts crying. Aurelia takes him, trying to soothe 
  him.

                        you?

  That hits Varro hard. His own eyes well with tears.

  INT. TROPHY ROOM - BATIATUS  VILLA - DAY

  Batiatus leads Spartacus in. Two Guards position themselves 
  at the entrance.

                        Good Mercato has insisted that

                        guise of his storied grandfather, 
                        Marcus Minucius Rufus!

  Spartacus  brow knits in dark recognition.

  Batiatus signals the Guards. OFF Spartacus weighing the 
  exchange as they move in to return him to the ludus...


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  WIDE ON two Guards standing duty at the entrance. CAMERA 
  MOVES PAST and inside to FIND Naevia gently sponging Crixus.

                                        CRIXUS

                        than pleasing to the nose.

  He chuckles at that, giving her a warm smile.

                        awaken, I had feared the worst.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Which has come to pass, if 
                        Spartacus is now champion.

                        A feat not done from my backside.

  Crixus starts to rise, grunts in pain. Naevia quickly 
  maneuvers him back down.

                        Lay still. You will open your 
                        wounds.

  Crixus reluctantly complies, drained by the simple movement.

                                        CRIXUS
                        I cannot even rise. Yet you promise 
                        former glories.

                        misfortune.

  Crixus locks eyes with her. These two love each other, want 
  each other, but before things can go any further --

                        Barca.

  Doctore shoots Naevia a look. She avoids his gaze.

                        Have you not told him?

  Crixus  face darkens, expecting the worst.

                        Far the opposite. He has purchased 
                        his freedom.

  Crixus laughs, stunned.

  Crixus shakes his head, can t believe what he s hearing.

                                        CRIXUS
                        The thought is foreign. Barca, the 
                        giant fuck, tending goats and 
                        picking vegetables? Pietros by his

  Naevia shifts, visibly worried as Crixus expresses his 
  doubts. Afraid of where this conversation is heading, Naevia 
  lies per Lucretia s instructions.

                                        CRIXUS
                      He shared words with you?

                                        NAEVIA
                        No, but -- I saw his eyes, as he 
                        was escorted through the gates.

  Doctore stares at Naevia, surprised to learn that she saw 
  Barca off.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You were there?

  She nods. Doctore hesitates, turns his attention to Crixus.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Regain your strength. I would see 
                        you again with sword in hand.

  Doctore exits. Naevia remembers to breathe. Crixus doesn t 
  notice, lost in his own dark musings.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Barca gone. Spartacus champion. I 
                        awake to a world of shit.

  OFF CRIXUS, stewing at the recent turn of events...


  INT. BATHS - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus sits with Varro, whose mood is considerably darker 
  after Aurelia s news (which he has not told Spartacus). 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    26.
  CONTINUED:

  Rhaskos and several others GAMBLE on the floor in the 
  corner.

                                        VARRO
                        You are a fool to refuse Batiatus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The man makes unreasonable demands.

                                        VARRO
                      He is your master. His demands your 
                        duty, reasonable or otherwise.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I will not be made to slaughter my 
                        countrymen.

                                        VARRO
                        Countrymen in dress only. You share 
                      no kinship with these prisoners. 
                        They are murderers. Rapists. Their 
                        death well deserved.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Then let another man s blade grant 
                        it.

  Varro stops. He s in no mood for Spartacus  hard-headedness.

                                        VARRO
                        You act as if you have free will in 
                        the matter. You are a gladiator.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I am a Thracian.

                                        VARRO
                        You are a slave. To cling to a life 
                        beyond these walls is to see your 
                        heart parted from your chest. You 
                        above all others should know this.

  The pain of that flickers across Spartacus  eyes. Varro 
  instantly regrets the statement.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                        I do not think before I speak.

                        I will remove myself to less 
                        deserving company.

  Varro turns away to join the gamblers, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    27.


  INT. CORRIDORS - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus moves down the corridor, a ghost in his own body. 
  He passes Pietros moving in the opposite direction, head 
  down. Spartacus glances at him, pauses.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Pietros.

  The boy turns back, revealing

  PURPLE AND BLACK BRUISES

  that tattoo the right side of his face, his eye swollen 
  shut. It s a jarring sight. Spartacus darkens.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                        Gnaeus  hand?

  Pietros averts his eyes, ashamed.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                                  tightly)(
                        I shall have a word.

                                          PIETROS
                      To what end? Will it see Barca s 
                        return? Will it see me in his arms, 
                        free, as he promised?

                                          SPARTACUS
                      He promised you freedom?

                                          PIETROS
                      He promised many things. Yet his 
                        swift departure proves each false.

  Spartacus  guilt for having left Sura still fresh, he speaks 
  more for himself than for Barca.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Fate often takes a man far from his 
                        heart. To his regret.

                                          PIETROS
                        Felt more keenly by the one left 
                        behind.

  Pietros moves off, broken and empty.  Spartacus watches him 
  go, lost in his own thoughts of regret.  He turns away, 
  WIPING US TO --                                                                                    28.


  INT. TRICLINIUM - BATIATUS  VILLA - MORNING

  A sumptuous breakfast is spread out. REVEAL Lucretia 
    entertaining ILITHYIA. Naevia hovers, making sure their cups 
  are full.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Rome is positively aflutter with 
                        news of Theokoles  defeat. No one 
                        believed such a thing was possible.  
                        Especially at the hands of a 
                        Thracian.

  She sips her wine, her hatred for Spartacus beyond 
    concealment.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        The gods truly bless the House of 
                        Batiatus.  We have even been 
                        entertaining thoughts of a patron, 
                      to share in our good fortune.

  The bait is dangled. Ilithyia absently brushes it aside.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        And does your good fortune extend 
                        downward?

  Ilithyia smiles, a twinkle in her eye.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I do not follow.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The Priestess.
                                (re: Lucretia s 
                                  belly)
                        Has her fertility rite born any 
                        seed?

  Lucretia smiles politely.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I was unable to conclude the rite 
                        within the allotted time.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        No!

                                        LUCRETIA
                      My husband was sadly absent.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.
  CONTINUED:

                                        ILITHYIA
                        What of the other man?

  Lucretia shifts uncomfortably. Ilithyia leans in closer, her 
  voice a conspiratorial whisper.

                                          ILITHYIA(cont'd)
                        You still have not told me anything 
                        about him. Is it Solonius? I have 
                        seen the way he looks at you.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I would rather fuck an eel.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        The thought of his naked cock is 
                        rather distressing. No, a woman as 
                        beautiful as you deserves a man. 
                        Someone of position maybe...?

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He is no one of note.

  Naevia tempers her reaction in the background, not caring 
  for the dismissal of Crixus.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      No one of note... Someone more 
                        physical, perhaps.
                                (shocked and 
                                  titillated)
                        A slave?!

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Your cup is empty.

  She motions to Naevia to fill it.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      It is, isn t it? But not just any 
                        slave, not for you. He would have 
                      to be forged by Jupiter himself...

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Let us move from the subject.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      Of course. To other matters.

  She sips her wine, her wheels turning.  They come to rest on 
  a likely suspect.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

                        How fares Crixus?

  That catches Lucretia by surprise. Ilithyia s grins, having 
  elicited the response she had hoped for.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Crixus?

                                        ILITHYIA
                        His injuries, suffered against 
                        Theokoles. Is he expected to live?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        His strength returns.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Joyous news. It would be a great 
                        tragedy for such a man to pass from 
                        this world, would it not?

  She locks eyes with Lucretia. Lucretia smiles, refusing to 
  confirm what Ilithyia has already divined.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      It would.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Pity he will not take the sand in 
                        good Mercato s games. I long to see 
                        his sword thrust home.

  She can t help but giggle. OFF Lucretia, forcing a polite 
  smile...


  INT. MESS HALL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  A grotesque stew is ladled into a bowl. WIDEN TO FIND 
  Spartacus being served by the cook (EUCLID). He gives 
  Spartacus an extra portion and a proud grin. Ashur slides in 
  behind him.

                                        VARRO
                        Poorly, as I often have. I will 
                        balance the loss at next chance --

  He's interrupted by a PIGEON fluttering up on the table. 
  Varro shoos it away, pauses as he spots Euclid fending off 
  several more PIGEONS that have descended on his serving 
  table.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                      It would seem Pietros has lost 
                        control of his flock.

  PUSH IN ON Spartacus as he eyes the birds, a bad feeling 
  uncoiling in his gut...                                                                                    32.


  INT. CORRIDOR - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  A few more PIGEONS scamper out of the way as Spartacus moves 
  through the corridor with grim purpose. Varro follows. 
  Spartacus reaches Barca s cell where even more birds have 
    congregated.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Pietros --

  Spartacus freezes at the entrance to the cell. PIETROS HANGS 
  LIFELESS from a beam in the ceiling. Pigeons flutter. Varro 
  comes up behind Spartacus, frowns at the sight.

                                        VARRO
                                  soft)(
                        The boy has freed himself.

  Spartacus  eyes fill with rage. He turns, storming off 
  towards the training square.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                        Spartacus --

  Varro hustles after him, WIPING US TO --


  EXT. TRAINING SQUARE - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Gnaeus spars with Rhaskos. He knocks Rhaskos to the ground, 
  the prongs of his practice trident pointed at Rhaskos  face.

                                          SPARTACUS (O.S.)
                        Gnaeus!

  Gnaeus turns just as Spartacus slams into him. TIME SLOWS as 
  the two smash to the ground. Spartacus unleashes on the 
  stunned Gnaeus, his fists raining down.

  THE MEN

  laugh and cheer, delighted by the unexpected violence. 
  Varro, having followed Spartacus, frowns nervously.

  GNAEUS

  shoves Spartacus off and scrambles to his feet. Spartacus 
  attacks, his eyes wild with rage. TIME SLOWS AND ACCELERATES 
  as the two men trade vicious blows. BLOOD SPLATTERS in 
  glorious slow motion.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.
  CONTINUED:

  SPARTACUS DRIVES GNAEUS BACK,

  coming dangerously close to the edge of the cliff. He rears 
  back to finish him off. THE CRACK OF A WHIP stops him.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Enough!

  Doctore strides up, coiling his whip. The square goes quiet. 
  Doctore s blazing eyes fall on the two offenders.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        What is this foolishness?

                        Pietros. The boy has taken his own 
                        life.

  Doctore frowns at the news. Gnaeus appears to take the news 
  hard.

                                        GNAEUS
                      He will be missed.
                                (a fuck you to 
                                  Spartacus)
                        Especially his lips around my cock.

  TIGHT ON SPARTACUS as the world GOES RED behind him with 
  rage. He swings with all his might, launching a fist at 
  Gnaeus. TIME SLOWS as it connects with Gnaeus  jaw, lifting 
  the man off his feet and sending him SAILING OVER THE CLIFF 
  to the jagged rocks below.  Stunned silence.  Doctore glares 
  at Spartacus.  OFF his smoldering wrath...


  INT. HOLDING CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  Batiatus rages. REVEAL Spartacus now secured by chains to 
  the wall. Two Guards stand sentry.

                                        BATIATUS
                        This morning I boasted the top 
                        Retiarius in all of Capua! Now I 
                        possess nothing more than bones and 
                        brains scattered upon the rocks!

                        return for the value lost! The 
                        price of the man will be subtracted

                      As you see fit, Dominus.

  Batiatus paces back and forth, growing more and more 
  agitated.

                                        BATIATUS
                        All of this because of what? 
                        Pietros? He was nothing. Shit from 
                        a whore.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      He was a man. His life had worth.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Half a coin at most. Yet Gnaeus was 
                        a gladiator! Years of training, 
                        each mounting to exorbitant cost. 
                        That is true worth!

                                          SPARTACUS
                                  eyes burning)(
                      He did not deserve to live.

  CRACK! Without thinking Batiatus slugs Spartacus in the 
  face.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I alone decide who lives! Not you! 
                        Not a fucking slave!

  A tense beat. Batiatus composes himself.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                      My generosity has been boundless,

                        Roman. Or die a Thracian.

  Batiatus exits, motioning to the Guards as he goes.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        See him to the Medicus.

  The Guards move in, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    35.


  INT. INFIRMARY - BATIATUS  LUDUS - DAY

  TIGHT ON PIETROS, dead, red welts around his neck from where 
  he hung himself. ADJUST to find Naevia standing over him, 
  eyes filled with tears. Crixus looks on from where he lies 
  recovering.

                                        CRIXUS
                        You shed tears for the boy?

                                  a beat, not unkind)(
                        The boy was weak. Without Barca to 
                        protect him --

                        Not all of us can be strong.

  She exits quickly, seized by emotion as she passes Spartacus 
  being ushered in. Crixus glares at him as the Medicus 
  hustles over to tend the injury.

                                        CRIXUS
                                  snorts, re: face)(

                        From which you emerge the mangled 
                        cunt. Did his little net prove too 
                        fierce an opponent?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Question the man himself. If you 
                        can scrape enough of him from the 
                        cliffs for reply.

  Crixus stares in angry surprise.

                                        CRIXUS

                      is your brother, deserving of an 
                        honorable death in the arena. I am 
                        shamed to have fought by your side.

                        I did. I chose not to end you in 
                        the arena and be done with your 
                        shit. A decision I presently 
                        regret.

  Crixus locks eyes with Spartacus, expecting a fight or harsh 
  words in return. But instead --

  INT. CORRIDOR/BARCA S CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Naevia gently places a pigeon back in its cage. Doctore

  close as he eyes the pigeon in the cage.

                      It surprises that Barca would claim 
                        freedom, yet leave the things he 
                        loved in captivity.

  Doctore nods, seemingly paying more attention to the bird

                                        NAEVIA
                      It was late, my head clouded with 
                        slumber.

                        Apologies, but I must return to the 
                        villa. Domina awaits.

  Naevia moves to exit. Doctore does not let her pass.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The fear in your eyes betray the

                        way. Please. Let me pass.

  Doctore sees the absolute panic in her eyes, and steps 
  aside. Naevia hustles out, two Guards waiting in the 
  corridor join her. OFF DOCTORE s rising suspicion...


  INT. BATHS - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Slaves scrape the Gladiators after a hard day s practice. 
  Ashur sits amongst the men, grimacing as he removes his leg 
  brace. He grunts to Varro being oiled up nearby.

                                        ASHUR
                        The day approaches when I'll be 
                        free of this.

                                        VARRO
                                  snidely)(
                        Perhaps you can fashion a proper 
                        cock from it.

  Doctore appears before Ashur can respond.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Remove yourselves.

  The men know not to argue, all heading for the exits. Ashur 
  stands with a grunt. Doctore pins him with a hard glare.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        Remain. There is a matter I wish to 
                        discuss.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

                        provides.

                                          DOCTORE
                        I seek information.

                                        ASHUR
                      On what subject?

                                          DOCTORE
                        Barca.

  Ashur smiles pleasantly, giving nothing away.

                                          DOCTORE(cont'd)
                        I understand he placed wager upon 
                        the match with Theokoles.

                        And won a small fortune, applied 
                        towards his freedom.

                                          DOCTORE
                        With no thought towards Pietros?

                                        ASHUR
                        Not enough coin remained to 
                        liberate him. Barca s eyes filled 
                        with tears, although spurred by 
                        regret or impending freedom, I know 
                        not.

  Doctore nods, satisfied.

                                          DOCTORE
                      It is a stirring sight. To see the 
                        bonds of servitude lifted.

                                        ASHUR
                        I confess my own eyes swimming as 
                        Barca took leave of the villa.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Who else offered farewells?

                                        ASHUR
                        Only our masters and myself.

  Doctore locks eyes with Ashur.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    40.

                        Naevia claims to have escorted 
                        Barca to the gate. She did not 
                        mention your presence.

                                        ASHUR
                        She is a simple thing, her mind 
                        easily --

  Lightning fast Doctore grabs Ashur s neck and pins him 
  against the wall.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Stories in conflict give me 
                        concern. If I discover there is 
                        more to the matter of Barca s 
                        departure... we shall have words.

  Doctore releases Ashur and strides out. OFF ASHUR, gasping 
  for air as he glares after Doctore...


  INT. SPARTACUS  CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - NIGHT

  Spartacus stands with Numerius  Thracian dagger in his hand. 
  He considers the blade, his face consumed by grief. He 
  squeezes his eyes shut against it, only to be met with

  FLASHES OF SURA

  from their first encounter. Happy. Flush with the promise of 
  love. Her radiant smile now a dagger in his chest.

  SPARTACUS DROPS TO HIS KNEES,

  overcome by the memory, tears streaming down his face. He 
  clutches the knife as if preparing to take his own life. 
  SLOW PUSH IN on the gleaming blade as it catches the light, 
  the FLARE TRANSITIONING US TO --


  EXT. PLAINS - THRACE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

  ADJUST off the dying campfire to find a makeshift lean-to. 
  The Thracian (Spartacus) curled with Sura, post-coital. 
  [NOTE: This is the same location as in ep 101, scene 14. 
  After Spartacus rescued Sura from the Barbarians, but before 
  being captured by the Romans.]

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        You still believe in them?  The 
                        gods?

                        Yes.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Why?

  A beat as she considers the question.

                                        SURA
                        Our village is gone.  Everyone we 
                        held close, dead.  If there are no 
                        gods... if there is nothing to 
                        shape what happens in our lives... 
                        Then there is no meaning to any of 
                        it.

  The Thracian absorbs this, troubled.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Then you must believe I am cursed.

                                        SURA
                        Why would you say such a thing?

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Your dream of the Red Serpent, 
                        before I left for war.  You said it 
                        was a vision from the gods, that I 
                        was destined for great and 
                        unfortunate things.

                                        SURA
                                  a beat)(
                        A warning, perhaps.  But far from a 
                        curse.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        Everything that has happened is 
                        because of me.  The Romans... Our 
                        village... If I am not cursed, I 
                        know not the word.

                                        SURA
                        I cannot believe the gods would 
                        lead me to you... to bless me with 
                        such love... only to make me bare 
                        witness to your suffering.  No.  
                        There is a deeper purpose to the 
                        path you have been set upon.  One 
                        that has yet to be revealed.

  The firelight dances across The Thracian's face.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

  He pulls her closer.

                                        THE THRACIAN
                        I will never see you from my side 
                        again. Without you, there is no 
                        reason for breath.

                        No.  The gods would set you on the 
                        proper course.  All you need do is 
                        close your eyes... and place 
                        yourself in their hands.

  She nestles in close, sleep beckoning as she closes her 
  eyes. OFF The Thracian, still troubled, his own eyes 
  remaining open...


  INT. SPARTACUS  CELL - BATIATUS  LUDUS - MORNING

  The cell door opens, revealing Batiatus backlit like a god. 
  Spartacus still kneels on the floor, his tears long since 
  dried, the knife in his hand (his back towards Batiatus, 
  blocking view of the blade).

                                        BATIATUS
                      We leave for the games. Is your

  Spartacus rises, turning towards Batiatus with the knife. 
  Batiatus tenses, but Spartacus flips the knife over, 
  extending the handle to him.

                                        BATIATUS

                        Sura spoke often to me of the gods.  
                        She believed in them.  I never

                        forward... I give myself over to 
                        her beliefs... and embrace my fate.

  A slow smile spreads across Batiatus  lips.

                        Your words give my heart great joy. 
                        Enough even to erase questions of

                        Magistrate s son came to your

                        I will take to the sands against

                        will face them alone.

  Not what Batiatus expected.

                        Six to your one? I will not risk 
                        the Champion of Capua to such 
                        absurdity.

                      If this is my fate, if this is the 
                        path the gods have truly set me 
                        upon... then they will not see me 
                        fall. Not yet.

                        And if you are wrong?

                        spectacle of blood... before I join 
                      my wife.

  Batiatus considers Spartacus. Less than a god, yet far more 
  than a man.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The gods have brought you this far. 
                        I believe they are not done with 
                        you yet. Nor am I.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You will allow me to fight alone?

                        With a condition of my own. When 
                        you kill the last of these shits 
                        garbed as your countrymen, what 
                        remains of the Thracian inside you 
                        dies with him. You  will embrace 
                        this fate of yours... and  your 
                        destiny as Spartacus, Champion of

  INT. THE CHUTES - ARENA - DAY

  Spartacus stands at the gate, fully dressed as a Roman 
  General, sans helmet. He carries a sword in each hand.  
  (Spartacus now fights as a Dimachaerus like Theokoles in ep.                                                                                     45.

  steel, as --


  EXT. ARENA - CAPUA - DAY

  The crowd BOOS as the six PRISONERS are led onto the arena s 
  sand. Each dressed as a Thracian soldier, the men s 
  appearance almost identical to that of Drenis and the others 
  Spartacus fought alongside in the auxiliary in 101.

  PULVINUS

  Batiatus steps onto a podium and raises his hands for an 
    announcement. Mercato, Lucretia, and Ilithyia behind him.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Citizens of Capua! Today, we honor 
                        the noble Marcus Minucius Rufus. A 
                        Roman consul and commander 
                        unmatched in glory. As tribute, 
                        good Mercato has seen fit to  re-
                        enact his grandfather s most famous 
                        battle against the Thracian hordes!

  The crowd CHEERS and Mercato stands and tosses a one-handed 
  salute to his adoring public. Batiatus lets him have his 
  moment, then launches into the story of the re-enactment.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Gaze at the prisoners standing 
                        before you. And imagine the 
                        Thracian Maedi that invaded 
                        Macedonia. Raping and pillaging its 
                        noble people. Murdering all in 
                        their path... even a Roman 
                        governor!

  ARENA

  The Prisoners react as the crowd BOOS and throws assorted 
  garbage in their direction.

  PULVINUS

  Batiatus continues his oration, working the crowd, building 
    anticipation with every word.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Violence and madness swept the 
                        land. Echoing into the heavens, 
                        where the gods themselves turned

  ARENA

  The gates open and Spartacus marches out. An impressive 
  sight. The picture of the Roman Legion s finest.

  PULVINUS

  Batiatus has set up the event, now he shifts gears to hype 
  his own goods.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        For the honorable role of Rufus, 
                        there was but one choice. The 
                        Bringer of Rain! Slayer of 
                        Theokoles! And Champion of Capua... 
                        I present to you -- Spartacus!!!

  The crowd goes totally Thunderdome at this announcement. 
  CHANTS of  Spartacus! Spartacus!  reverberate. Ilithyia 
  glowers.

                                        ILITHYIA
                                to Mercato)(
                        I thought it was your grandfather 
                      we honor. Yet the crowd chants 
                         Spartacus .

  Mercato frowns, dissatisfied. Batiatus sweeps in, smoothing 
  the waters.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Worry not of details, good Mercato. 
                        The glory remains your 
                          grandfather s alone. Come! Give the 
                        signal to begin his glorious 
                        victory!

  Batiatus steps aside. Lucretia gives him an appreciative 
  grin -- nicely played. Mercato moves to the edge of the 
  pulvinus, beaming with pride.

                                          MERCATO
                      In honor of Marcus Minucius 
                        Rufus... Let blood be shed!

  THE ARENA

  The crowd ROARS as the Prisoners fan out to attack.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.

  SPARTACUS

  remains motionless, paying them no attention.  TIME SLOWS as 
  he turns his head slightly upward to consider the clouds and 
  the heavens.

  PULVINUS

  Batiatus' face slips into absent worry.  This is not what he 
  expected.

  ARENA

  A sad smile bends Spartacus' lips as feels the sun on his 
  face, the gentle breeze... and closes his eyes, putting his 
  fate in the hands of the gods.

  PRISONER #1

  steps forward and HURLS HIS SPEAR at Spartacus.  It soars 
  through the air -- and CATCHES THE BREEZE, altering its 
  course just enough to miss slamming into Spartacus' face. 
  The gleaming tip draws a thin line across Spartacus' cheek. 
  TIME RESUMES as

  SPARTACUS' EYES CRASH OPEN

  and hell is unleashed.  Spartacus attacks.  PRISONER #2 
  thrusts his sword at Spartacus' neck, but Spartacus deflects 
  it, just in time to sidestep PRISONER #3's assault.  As the 
  Prisoner's sword swings through air

  SPARTACUS

  slices the man's right arm, PRISONER #3 screaming in pain as 
  his blood SPRAYS onto the sand.  Spartacus has no time to 
  react as PRISONER #4's sword carves a giant gash across his 
  shoulder blades.

  PRISONER #2

  sees an opening and advances.  Spartacus and Prisoner #2 get 
  tangled up, but before the others can descend, Spartacus 
  slams an elbow into the man's throat.  Prisoner #2 hits the 
  sand and Spartacus spins around just in time to see PRISONER 
  #5's

  BATTLE AXE

  spinning toward his head.  TIME SLOWS as Spartacus bends out 
  of the way, the axe rotating lazily an inch from his face. 
  Spartacus needs to get to open space.  He barrels towards 
  PRISONER #4, smashing the man's helmet.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.

  PULVINUS

  Mercato bolts from his seat, thrilled by the hit.  Batiatus 
  laughs and swills wine.  Lucretia eyes the action with 
  wonder.

                      By the gods themselves.

  ARENA

  Prisoner #1, having retrieved his spear, attacks.  Spartacus 
  counters.  Prisoner #1 swings the base of the spear, 
  catching Spartacus across the jaw.  Spartacus staggers back, 
  momentarily stunned.

  THE PRISONERS REGROUP

  stalking towards him.  Each prisoner with but one mission -- 
  kill Spartacus.  Spartacus eyes them, breathing hard, 
  feeling the odds closing in against him.

  PULVINUS

  A hush has fallen over the arena.  Scattered MURMURS.  The 
  crowd concerned that their champion may not survive this 
  battle.  Mercato sits panicked as he turns to Batiatus.

                                          MERCATO
                        You do realize my grandfather won 
                        this battle?

  Ilithyia is unable to suppress a satisfied smile.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Perhaps this day history will not 
                        repeat itself.

  ARENA

  Spartacus surveys the Prisoners in front of him.  His face 
  hardens with new resolve.  If this is his destiny, let it 
  begin now.

  SPARTACUS SPRINTS FORWARD,

  a sword gripped tightly in each hand.  With his right sword, 
  he stabs Prisoner #2 through the throat.  Spartacus releases 
  the sword's grip and ducks just as


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    49.
  CONTINUED:

  PRISONER #4

  swings his sword at Spartacus' neck.  From the sand, 
  Spartacus clutches his remaining sword with both hands and 
  thrusts it upward, skewering Prisoner #4, who vomits RIBBONS 
  OF BLOOD on Spartacus and the sand below. SPARTACUS RISES

  and removes his sword from Prisoner #2's lifeless neck.  He 
  then turns and hurls his other sword at Prisoner #5, the 
  blade lodging deep inside the man's skull.  Three down, 
  three to go.

  PULVINUS

  The crowd is in a fervor.  Mercato rises from his seat, the 
  thrill and excitement almost too much for him.  Batiatus 
  leans forward, eager.  His eyes alive with purpose.

  THE ARENA

  Prisoner #3 and PRISONER #1 attempt to work as a team, 
  circling Spartacus.  Finally, the two rush from opposite 
  sides.  Spartacus runs his sword through Prisoner #3's 
  stomach as Prisoner #1 thrusts his spear at Spartacus' neck.

  TIME SLOWS

  as Spartacus leans back, the spear's tip narrowly avoiding 
  his chin.  TIME RESUMES.  With his right hand, Spartacus 
  grabs the spear's shaft and yanks it out of the Prisoner's 
  hand.  He breaks the spear in two across his knee and then

  STABS THE POINTED TIP

  through Prisoner #1's right ear, the spear, and some brains, 
  exiting his left.  The Prisoner's eyes roll back in his 
  empty head as Spartacus turns and looks for the last 
  prisoner.

  PRISONER #6 FLEES

  to the opposite side of the arena.  Looking for a miracle, 
  some sort of way out.  He grabs the chute's gate and shakes 
  it... but it's no use.  He's trapped.  The man turns to face

  SPARTACUS,

  stalking over, both swords dripping blood onto the sand. A 
  Roman killing machine. Realizing there s nowhere to flee,





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.
  CONTINUED:

  PRISONER #6

  sprints towards Spartacus, both hands holding his sword 
  above his head.  Prisoner #6 brings it down with all his 
  might... but Spartacus easily deflects it.  Prisoner #6 
  loses the sword's handle and is sent crashing to his knees. 
  SPARTACUS  SHADOW descends over the fallen Prisoner.  ON 
  SPARTACUS, as he raises his sword, set to deliver the final 
  blow, only to pause when he sees

  HIS OWN FACE

  staring up at him from the sand. Not Spartacus as he appears 
  now, but as he did when he was a Thracian. Long hair and 
  beard, face bloodied from battle with Solonius  men (from ep 
  101). The Thracian Spartacus locks eyes with Spartacus. A 
  frozen moment.

  TIGHT ON SPARTACUS,

  as Batiatus  words echo in his head. Knowing that to kill 
  this man is to kill his Thracian past. Thracian Spartacus 
  looks up with pleading eyes and utters but one word:

                                        THRACIAN SPARTACUS
                        Don t...

  SPARTACUS SNARLS

  as he brings his sword down with violent fury, decapitating 
  the defenseless Prisoner. Blood erupts from the Prisoner s 
  neck like a scarlet volcano as his head (not Thracian 
  Spartacus ) tumbles to the sand.

  PULVINUS

  The crowd ROARS. Mercato beams. Ilithyia frowns, 
    disappointed yet again.

                                          MERCATO
                        A marvelous show!

                      An honor to be of service.

  Batiatus glows. Lucretia basks in the warmth of it.

  ARENA

  Spartacus stands exhausted and blood-soaked, absorbing the 
  public s deafening CHEERS. His eyes are hard, but there s a 
  certainty there. He is a man who s accepted his fate. He 


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.
