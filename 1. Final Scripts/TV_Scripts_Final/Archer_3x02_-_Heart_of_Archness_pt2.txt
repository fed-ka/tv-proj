1EXT. ISIS HEADQUARTERS -- ESTABLISHING -- AFTERNOON

  As we PUSH IN to the upper floors, we hear the voice of PAM.

                                    PAM (O.S.)
                    Aw c'maaaahn!

2INT. ISIS BULLPEN -- CONTINUOUS

  Pam, with PURSE and COAT, stands by the desk of CHERYL/CAROL,
  who looks bored and exhausted (hair unkempt, baggy eyes, etc.)

                                    PAM
                    Clock yer skinny ass out already,
                    and let's go get outside some dranks!

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                    Ugh, I can't!  I have to cover her
                    stupid phone in case those stupid
                    pirates call with a stupid ransom
                    demand for Mr. Stupid Archer!

                                      MALORY (O.S.)
                    Carol?!

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                    Y --

                                      MALORY (O.S.)
                    Carol!  Have they called?!

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                    No!
                          (oops, now sweetly)
                    Ma'am!  But rest assured I'll let
                    you know the minute they dooo!

                                      MALORY (O.S.)
                          (to herself)
                    Rest?  My God, who can rest...

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                    Not me, apparently.

    CYRIL, also looking exhausted, comes in with a bunch of FILES.

                                      CYRIL
                    Or me!  I have to re-do the annual
                    budget because she's blowing it all
                    on this so-called rescue of Archer!                                  ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     2

                                    PAM
                    Well his plane did crash, and the
                    distress signal was last heard coming
                    from a known pirate fortress, so...

                                      CYRIL
                    So?!  That doesn't mean Ray and Lana
                    have to bankrupt ISIS getting there!

3EXT. OCEAN -- CONTINUOUS

  WIDE on a 100' luxury motor yacht, skimming across the Pacific.

                                      GILLETTE (O.S.)
                    Oh, would you relax?

4EXT. LUXURY MOTOR YACHT -- CONTINUOUS

  On GILLETTE, dressed like Thurston Howell III, reclining in a
    swivel chair on the bridge, lazily holding a FRUITY DRINK.

                                      GILLETTE
                    You rent a boat, that money's gone. 
                    This way, we can sell it when we're
                    done.  I bet it'll come out cheaper.  

    WIDER: LANA, in her tactical attire, stands at the steering
    wheel/dashboard, intently watching the ocean as she steers.

                                    LANA
                    I wasn't talking about the boat.

    REVEAL: a handsome, shirtless, and slender young Filipino guy,
  MANU, 18, kneels on the floor massaging Gillette's bare feet.

                                      GILLETTE
                    Five grand for the week was a steal.

                                    LANA
                    So a twink escort you rent, but --

                                      GILLETTE
                    That's different!  You can't -- I
                    mean, they did ask if I wanted to
                    actually buy him, but I thought...

                                    LANA
                    What, that I'd be weird about it?

                                      GILLETTE
                    I --                                  ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     3

                                    LANA
                    That I, perhaps due to my race, might
                    have a problem with the concept of
                    owning a human being?

  Beat.

                                      GILLETTE
                      I actually just thought I'd get tired
                    of him.

                                    LANA
                    You?  Mr. Can't Even Commit To A Pet?

                                      GILLETTE
                    Wh-?  Yeah hi, two cats!  One of whom
                    I think has FIP, so... commit that.

5INT. ISIS BULLPEN -- CONTINUOUS -- BACK TO SCENE

                                      CYRIL
                    You know how hard I worked on this
                    budget?!  Nights, weekends, canceled
                    my vacation, and now it's all wasted!

                                    PAM
                    Wasted, exactly, let's go be that! 
                    C'mon, happy hour at Pita Margarita's!

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                    Is... that what it sounds like?

                                    PAM
                    Only if it sounds like a shitload of
                    tequila and some A-rab hoagies.

                                      MALORY (O.S.)
                    How dare you?!

    MALORY, also looking exhausted, and sloshing a large HIGHBALL
    around, lurches out of her office and stands in the doorway.

                                    PAM
                    Arab, sorry.

                                      MALORY
                    Oh shut up, how can you even think
                    about happy hour at a time like this?!
                          (slugs drink)
                    When probably as we speak, my poor
                    Sterling is being tortured by pirates!                                  ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     4

                                      CYRIL
                          (low, chuckling)
                    I wish...

                                      MALORY
                    What?!

                                      CYRIL
                    Wish you wouldn't say that!  Because
                    I'm sure he's not being tortured...

6EXT. PIRATE ISLAND -- ESTABLISHING -- MORNING -- CONTINUOUS

  As we slowly PUSH IN to the pirate fortress, from deep within
  its damp stone walls we hear a bloodcurdling scream: ARCHER.

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)
                          Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagghhhhhhhhhh!

7INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS

  As we PAN from the open balcony doors overlooking the Pacific
    ocean, across the things you'd expect to see in a pirate
    captain's quarters (old table covered with CHARTS, a TELESCOPE,
  RUM, a GLOBE, and quite possibly even a PARROT) we hear Archer.

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)
                    Ohhhh my God, stop, stop, stop,
                    seriously I can't take anymore!

  The PAN brings us to Archer, lying nude in a big old four-poster
  bed, holding a fifth of RUM and covered with two gorgeous nude
    NATIVE WOMEN (with sheets, etc. covering all the X-rated parts). 
    There's fruit and goop smeared around, ping-pong paddle, etc.

                                      ARCHER
                          (laughing)
                    Whew!  That was insane, I never even
                    heard of that position!  Did the
                      missionaries not swing by here, or...?

  KNOCK KNOCK!  We hear a knock and the heavy door creaks open.

                                    NOAH (O.S.)
                    Excuse me?  Sorry, pirate-king Archer?

                                      ARCHER
                    What!  Noah!

  NOAH stands by the door with a CLIPBOARD, pushes up his GLASSES.

                                    NOAH
                    Ready for the uh, morning briefing?                                  ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     5

                                      ARCHER
                    Noah, I'm half drunk and slathered
                    in... every bodily fluid there is.
                          (swigs rum)
                    So yeah, this is about as pirate-
                    kingy as I'm gonna get.  Brief away!

                                    NOAH
                    Okay, item one!  The --

                                      ARCHER
                    Noah.

                                    NOAH
                    Yes sir?

                                      ARCHER
                    Good morning.

    Archer flashes that shit-eating grin a beat, then we CUT TO the


  MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE                                  ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     6

                                        ACT ONE


8EXT. PIRATE FORTRESS -- MOMENTS LATER

  Wide elevated-angle shot, looking down into the courtyard of
  the fort, where about twenty PIRATES mill about doing pirate
    things (coiling ROPE, sharpening MACHETES, cleaning ASSAULT
    WEAPONS) with most of them glaring sullenly up toward camera.

                                    NOAH (O.S.)
                    Item one.  The morale problem.

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)
                    How do we have a morale problem?

9INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS

    Archer, in chinos and open Aloha shirt, looks out the balcony
    doors, distractedly tossing/catching a COCONUT with a FISH NET
    (i.e., lacrosse style).  Noah stands nearby with the CLIPBOARD.

                                    NOAH
                    Well --

                                      ARCHER
                    C'mon, karaoke night's a big hit...

10FLASHBACK: KARAOKE NIGHT -- NIGHT

  On a makeshift bamboo stage lit with TIKI TORCHES, a slightly
    bucktoothed pirate, BUCKY, croons a weird Malay song...

                                      PIRATE
                    Roti dan mentega, bakar dan selai!

  Until Archer staggers onstage with RUM, his arm thrown over a
    native girl, and shoves him offstage as he grabs the MICROPHONE.

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooo!

11FLASHBACK: FEAST -- NIGHT

    Sullen pirates sit on log stumps and crappy chairs around a 
    bonfire, attended by hot NATIVE GIRLS with big PLATTERS.  

                                      ARCHER (V.O.)
                    We have an awesome feast every night...

    Archer staggers into the foreground with RUM, his arm over a
    native girl, and smacks the PLATE right out of a pirate's hands.

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooo!                                  ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     7

12FLASHBACK: INTRAMURAL LACROSSE -- DAY

  On a makeshift lacrosse field (bamboo goal with fishnet, COCONUT
    "ball" etc.), Archer totally pwns the other pirates (who use
  FISH NETS as sticks but somehow have sleeveless mesh JERSEYS)

                                      ARCHER (V.O.)
                    Not to mention intramural lacrosse!

  1) SWOOSH!  WHUMP!  Archer scores a goal and then cross-checks
  the GOALIE in the chest, knocking him down and out of frame.

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooo!

  2) KRUNCH!  Archer decimates a (much smaller) pirate with a
    flying cross-body check as the other pirates look on sullenly.

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooo!

  3) Archer bobs up and down, his NET/STICK held over his head.

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooo!

  We PULL OUT to see he's "HALO-bagging" another pirate, whom
  (one assumes) he has just knocked both down and totally out.

                                      ARCHER (V.O.)
                    So how can they have low morale?

13INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS -- BACK TO SCENE

                                    NOAH
                    Well um, besides all of those things,
                    they haven't been paid.

                                      ARCHER
                    So pay 'em, what do you need, new
                    payroll software?  Cyril always
                    handled all that stuff.  Payroll,
                    budgets, he's a genius at that crap...

14INT. CYRIL'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS -- NIGHT

    Cyril, tie loose, looking crazy, a half-empty bottle of BOURBON
  and a ROCKS GLASS on his desk, types furiously on his KEYBOARD.

                                      CYRIL
                          (mocking Malory)
                    Just find the money, Cyril!  You're
                    an accounting genius, Cyril!
                                      (MORE)                                  ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     8

                                      CYRIL (CONT'D)
                          (normal)
                    That's right you hawk-faced harpy...

  ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN

    Crazy.  Numbers scrolling up, down, sideways.  All Matrix-y. 
  The "how" TBD, but the upshot is Cyril is dumping money from
  ISIS into dozens of money-laundering accounts, then into Swiss
    accounts.  We see his crazy-eyed reflection on the screen.

                                      CYRIL
                    I am an accounting genius!  So good
                    luck finding all these Swiss accounts!
                          (maniacal laughter)
                    Mwah ha!  Mwah ha ha ha ha haaaaaa!

                    Aagh!

    Cyril's shocked reflection turns toward the door, and we CUT
  TO see Pam standing there drunk, coat on, holding a big 32-oz.
    GO-CUP and a carpet-dripping FALAFEL PITA from Pita Margarita's.

                                      CYRIL

                    I think it's because she's such a

  Wide shot of the pirate MOTHER SHIP alongside a TUNA BOAT.

                                      ARCHER (V.O.)
                    It's not really what I expected.

19FLASHBACK: FIRST BOARDING -- TUNA BOAT DECK -- CONTINUOUS

  Waist up on Archer as he frog-marches a Malaysian guy on deck,
  one hand on the guys's collar, his COLT .45 in the guy's cheek.

                                      ARCHER
                    Dammit, I said get over there!

    Archer shoves him off-screen and we CUT WIDE to see the deck is
    stacked with big, freshly caught TUNA.  Archer has shoved the
  guy (who turns out is a pirate) toward Noah and the rest of his
    (armed, sullen) pirate crew.  He now stands between them and
  the CAPTAIN and CREW of the tuna boat, all with hands up.

                                      ARCHER
                    For the jillionth time, nobody is
                    raping anybody!  Actually no, you
                    know what?!  Now nobody gets anything,
                    because I'm letting him go!

                    my research vessel and enslaved me...

21INT. PIRATE FORTRESS -- DUNGEON -- MOMENTS LATER

  RILEY leans his forearms through the bars of his cell, talking
  to BUCKY, the HALO-bagged pirate, who sits outside the cell on
    a stool, lazily wiping his AK-47 with a RAG.  The floor of
    Riley's cell is covered with dirty straw, and the only other
  items in it are a thin BLANKET and a crusty, fly-buzzing BUCKET.

                                      RILEY
                    I'm not kidding, this Archer guy's

                    Riley!

    Archer storms up with Noah on his heels.  Bucky glares
    malevolently at Archer as he wipes his AK-47 with the RAG.                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     12

                                      RILEY
                    Archer, what a coincidence.  I was
                    just talking about you.

                                      ARCHER
                    With who?  Cause that bucktooth little
                    shit doesn't even speak English!

                    I do little bit --

  Bucky leaps up and flip-flops away, down the dank corridor.

                    Man, that is not gonna help morale.

                                      RILEY
                    Yeah, Bucky's an incorrigible gossip.

                                      ARCHER
                    Who -- to whom you are forbidden to
                    speak!  I locked you down here so 
                    you couldn't contact my mother, not
                    so you could, whatever, sow disharmony!

                                      RILEY
                    You're sowing plenty all by yourself. 
                    Face it kid, you're a bust as a pirate-
                    king.

                                      ARCHER
                    King, exactly!  And unless you want
                    to spend the rest of the afternoon
                    with a bunch of scorpions, don't

                    your ears" and they were like "Apa?"

                                      ARCHER
                    Damn it --

                                    NOAH
                    I can't do idioms.                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     15

                                      ARCHER
                    Shut up.  Then unshut up, and tell
                    them I understand their frustration...

                                    NOAH
                    Saya mendengar anda!

                                      ARCHER
                    But you don't change horses in mid --

                                    NOAH
                    Idiom!

                                      ARCHER
                    Now is not the time for a new king!

                                    NOAH
                    Sekarang tidak ada raja baru!

                                      ARCHER
                    Because the king is strong!

                                    NOAH
                    Raja yang kuat!

                                      BUCKY
                    If you so strong... melawan raja!

                                      PIRATES
                    Yah!  Melawan raja!  Melawan raja!

                                      ARCHER
                    What's melawan raja?

                                    NOAH
                      King-fight.  If the king loses to a
                      challenger in one-on-one combat, he
                    has to step down.  Or just be dead.

                                      ARCHER
                    Since when?!

                                    NOAH
                    Since always.  Did you not read the
                      orientation materials?

26FLASHBACK: PIRATE FEAST -- NIGHT

    Pirates around a bonfire in background as Archer staggers into
    foreground, shirtless and wearing a crazy tropical STRAW HAT,
    a bottle of RUM in the hand that's slung over a native girl, a
    flaming BOOKLET ("Pirate King Orientation") in the other hand.

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooo!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     16


27EXT. PIRATE FORTRESS -- COURTYARD -- BACK TO SCENE

                                      ARCHER
                    Mmmmore skimmed it?

  Bucky hops off the stump, raises his arms to the crowd.

                                      BUCKY
                    Enough talk!  Melawan raja!

    Archer takes off his shirt, exposing his muscular torso (NB:
  if we go OTS, make sure we still have the TATTOOS on him.)

                                      ARCHER
                          (chuckling)
                    Okay Bucky, we'll melawan raja...

                                    NOAH
                    Oh, one thing --

                                      ARCHER
                    Noah shut up and translate.
                          (to the room)
                    I accept your challenge!

                                    NOAH
                    Cabaran diterima!

                                      ARCHER
                    Because your mouth's been writing
                    checks your butt can't cash, so now
                    I am gonna hand you your shit!

                                    NOAH
                    Anda --
                          (annoyed sigh)
                    Do you even know what an idiom is?

                                      ARCHER
                      Colloquial metaphor.

                                    NOAH
                    No, it's -- well actually yes, but I
                    really think this is a bad idea --

                                      ARCHER
                    I'm not paying you to think, Noah!
                          (thinks)
                    Even if you weren't a slave.  And
                    your three-fifths of an opinion is
                    noted, so -- oh sweet Jesus Jones!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     17

    REVERSE: before the wickedly grinning pirates stands a... well,
  not quite a man, but not quite a thing.  But if you need a
    reference, The Thing will do.  Only not made of orange rocks. 
    Basically a Malaysian Hulk.  In a loincloth.  But not green.

                                    HULK PIRATE

                      [animal-like growl]

  CUT TO Noah and Archer, the latter slack-jawed in amazement.

                                    NOAH

                    See, Bucky doesn't have to fight you
                    himself.  He can choose a stand-in.

                                      ARCHER

                    Who is... huge!

                                    NOAH

                    That's what I was --

                                      ARCHER
                    Why didn't he come out for lacrosse?!

                                      BUCKY
                    You lucky I don't let him!

                                      ARCHER
                    Let him?

                                    NOAH
                    He's Bucky's girlfriend.

                                    HULK PIRATE
                      [animal-like roar]

                                      ARCHER
                    Way to eschew traditional gender
                    roles, pirates.

                                    NOAH
                    Yeah, they're fascinating...

                                      BUCKY
                    Now we melawan raja!  And then we
                    see who is bucktooth little shit!

                                      ARCHER
                    It'll still be you.  Listen --

                      Melawaaaaaaan rajaaaaa!

                                      PIRATES
                    Mela-wan, ra-ja!  Mela-wan, ra-ja!

  As the pirates chant, Archer leans in toward Noah.

                                      ARCHER
                    Hey, maybe there's a way to make
                    some money on this.  Bet on me.

                                    NOAH
                    I would, but who'd bet on -- wait,
                    don't you have that backwards?

                                    LANA (O.S.)
                    No.

28EXT. LUXURY MOTOR YACHT -- CONTINUOUS

  3/4 on the yacht as it speeds toward, then past, camera.

                                    LANA (O.S.)
                    Because you know what I bet?

29INT. LUXURY MOTOR YACHT -- CONTINUOUS

    Gillette, now in tactical attire (and watch cap), stands nearby
  as Manu puts CAMO MAKE-UP on him using CAMO GREASEPAINT STICKS.

                                      GILLETTE
                          (bored)
                    I bet I know you're gonna tell me...

  CUT TO Lana, peering through BINOCULARS as she steers.

                                    LANA
                    I bet after we Zodiac in past the
                    reef, take out at least one O.P.,
                    make our way through a jungle full
                    of Claymores, neutralize the fortress
                    garrison, and finally extract that
                      kidnapped-gettin ass sonuvabitch,
                    he's gonna be all like --

30EXT. PIRATE FORTRESS -- COURTYARD -- CONTINUOUS

  On Archer, a bit blood-spattered, in the Tiger Woods pose.

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooooo!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     19

31INT. LUXURY MOTOR YACHT -- CONTINUOUS

  On Lana, still steering, briefly mocking Archer's Tiger pose.

                                    LANA
                          (mocking Archer)

                    Wuhhhhh!
                          (normal)

                    Like this whole thing was all just
                    part of some... dumbshit master plan.

                                      GILLETTE (O.S.)

                    She said, trying to convince herself
                    that she no longer ached for his --

    RROWRR!  Lana cranks the wheel, hard, and Gillette screams.

                                      GILLETTE (O.S.)

                    Oww!

                                    LANA
                    I'm sorry, what were you gonna say?

  CUT TO Gillette, the PAINT STICK jammed into his eye.  Beat.

                                      GILLETTE
                    Cock.

32EXT. PIRATE FORTRESS -- COURTYARD -- CONTINUOUS

  On Archer, blood-spattered, coming out of the Tiger pose...

                                      ARCHER
                    Suck it!  Cause I'm still the king!

  ... to reveal he's holding Riley's COLT .45 in the other hand.

                                    HULK PIRATE (O.S.)
                    [wounded animal roar/cry]

    REVEAL: the Hulk Pirate sits on the grass clutching bloody
    fingers over his ruined kneecap, as Bucky hugs his head/neck.

                                      BUCKY
                    This no fair!  You break the rules!

                                      ARCHER
                    What rules?!  We're pirates!

                                      BUCKY
                    Melawan raja mean hand-hand combat!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     20

                                      ARCHER
                    Show me!  Show me where it says that!

33EXT. PIRATE FORTRESS -- COURTYARD -- MOMENTS LATER

  New angle on Archer, arms crossed and smug, Noah at his side.

                                      ARCHER
                    Take your time.  I'm hourly.

  CUT TO Bucky as he flips through Archer's half-burned BOOKLET.

                                      BUCKY
                    I know it in here somewhere...
                          (flip flip flip)
                    Damn!  Okay, maybe it don't say this
                    exact words, but everybody know --

                                      ARCHER
                    Nooop!  Fair is -- well it wasn't
                    exactly fair, but since it wasn't
                    expressly forbidden... tough titties!
                          (thinks)
                    Wow, I never realized how much we
                    rely idioms.

                                      BUCKY
                    You win this round, Archer!

                                      ARCHER
                    Duh.

                                      BUCKY
                    But every dog has its day!

                                      ARCHER
                    See?

                                      BUCKY
                    And when that day come Bucky make
                    you sorry!  Bucky make you say --

                    Mayday mayday mayday...

    SCROOWNK!  We hear Riley on the P.A., followed by feedback. 
    Archer and Noah and all the rest look skyward, confused.

                                      ARCHER
                    Um...

                    That's not me.

                                      ARCHER
                    I know that!

                    Damn it, is that the P.A.?!  Way to
                    eschew traditional labeling, pirates.

    ZZZRPT!  Riley (we assume) hits a switch.  The P.A. goes silent.

                                      ARCHER

    Archer sprints off, COLT .45 at the ready, followed by Noah.

34INT. PIRATE FORTRESS -- RADIO ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

  Riley sits at a large (and pretty antiquated) SHORTWAVE RADIO
  and dials a KNOB while speaking into a desktop MICROPHONE.

    Malory, clutching a HIGHBALL, addresses the big monitor.  The
    "dash-cam" shot in the INSET has been replaced by a WAVEFORM.

    Cheryl/Carol walks in, holding a gooey GLUE BOTTLE and pouting.

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                    What.

36INT. PIRATE FORTRESS -- RADIO ROOM

  On the SHORTWAVE, shot six times, now smoking and sparking.

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)

                    I told you, I'm not going anywhere!

  WIDE: Archer holds the COLT .45 on Riley, who stands by the
  radio desk with his hands up.  Noah hovers next to Archer.

                                      ARCHER

                      Especially not back to ISIS, and
                      especially not now that I just shot --
                          (to Noah)
                    What I assume was the only radio?

                          (checks clipboard)
                    Yeah, "See about getting a back-up
                    radio" was itemmmmm five.

                                      ARCHER
                    And item one, is Riley get your ass
                    back in your cell!

                                    NOAH
                    Item one's actually the morale problem.

                                      ARCHER
                    Noah?

                                      RILEY
                    More like potential mutiny.

                                    NOAH
                    Yeah, right?

                                      ARCHER
                    No!  You're not!  Because there is
                    no mutiny, potential or otherwi --

                      Pemberontakan!

  We hear Bucky yell, followed by a huge yell from the pirates.

                                      PIRATES (O.S.)
                      Pemberontakan!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     24

  And as we hear that dreadful host spring into action   weapons
    clattering, calloused feet slapping   Archer turns to Noah.

                                      ARCHER
                    So, is that Malay for --

                          (raises clipboard)
                    So I guess I should upgrade it from
                      "potential" to, what would be the...?

                    No!  Do not upgrade that mutiny,
                    Noah!  I will tell you!  When it's

    KLINK!  A HAND GRENADE bounces off the side of the (unglassed,
    castle-like) window, hits the floor with a KLUNK, then rolls a
  foot or two and starts to smoke a little with a loud FZZZZZZ...

    A beat as they all look at it, then Archer turns to the others.

                                      ARCHER
                    Mutiny, okay, so...

38INT. PIRATE FORTRESS -- RADIO ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

  Under a low-volume, high-pitched WHINE, we find ourselves in

    RILEY'S POV: a woozy, double-vision PAN of the grenade-blasted
  room: the upended radio desk and chair, papers strewn about...
    here's Noah against the wall, clutching his knees to his chest
  and screaming like Private Ryan... now here's Archer on his
  knees before Riley, holding a (lacrosse) FISH NET, yelling:

                                      ARCHER

                      [unintelligible over the whine]

  CUT TO Riley, squinting, trying to make sense of it.  CUT TO
    Archer, still unintelligible, until a "Lost"-style WHOOSH SFX
  snaps everything, audio and visual, into clarity.  Now we can
  hear Archer, over the crackle of SMALL ARMS FIRE and a pounding
  (of what sounds like a pirate mob) at the thick oaken door.

                                      ARCHER

                    -- is what I was talking about, with
                    the whole tinnitis thing!  You hear
                    that high-pitched whine?  It's like --

                                    NOAH

                          Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

  CUT TO Noah about halfway through this scream, still clutching
  his knees to his chest like Private Ryan, until Archer yells:

                                      ARCHER
                    Noah!

                                    NOAH
                    Aagh!  What?!

                                      ARCHER
                    I -- well for one thing, I'm kinda
                      regretting making you first mate!

                                    NOAH
                    Me too!  Now I'm... management!

  CUT TO Riley, looking out the (unglassed, castle-like) window
  and ducking as a few SLUGS ping into the room through it.

                                      RILEY

                    What?!

                                      RILEY

                    Shut up!  Noah!

                                    NOAH

                    What?!

                                      RILEY

                    What'd you say about a back-up radio?!

                                    NOAH

                    I -- that we need one!  It's itemmmm...
                          (checks clipboard)
                    Five!

                                      RILEY
                    Oh well that's just --

    KRUNCH!  We hear the door get smashed by something like...

                                      ARCHER
                      A battering ram?

39INT. PIRATE FORTRESS -- CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

    Outside the radio room, Bucky directs four PIRATES who heave
  back, then slam a (LOG) BATTERING RAM into the door: KRUNCH!

                                      BUCKY
                    Archer!  Kami membunuhmu!

40INT. PIRATE FORTRESS -- RADIO ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

  Riley still at one window, ducking the odd SLUG.  Archer is at
    another, ducking the odd SLUG as he catches   and throws back
    the occasional HAND GRENADE with the FISH NET.  Noah, a deer
  in the headlights, shields himself with his CLIPBOARD.

                                      ARCHER
                    What was that, what'd he say?

                                    NOAH
                    "We're going to kill you."

                                      ARCHER
                    Oh.  Thought they were surrendering.

                                      RILEY
                    Why?!  Would you think that?!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     27

                                      ARCHER
                    They did before!   For no good reason!

                                      RILEY
                    At least then we had assault weapons! 
                    Now we've only got -- give me that!

  Riley snatches his COLT .45 out of Archer's waistband.

                                      ARCHER
                    Yeah go nuts, Sundance, it's empty.

    Archer catches a GRENADE and throws it back out as we CUT TO

41EXT. PIRATE FORTRESS -- CONTINUOUS

  LOW ANGLE: several PIRATES scale a makeshift LADDER as the
    GRENADE flies past them and down to the next level and WHOOM! 
  It explodes, flinging two PIRATES ass-over-teakettle, "A-Team"
    style, over the low parapets of whatever level they're on.

                                      RILEY (O.S.)
                    It's empty!  Because you emptied it!
                    Into the only radio on the island!

42INT. PIRATE FORTRESS -- RADIO ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

  On the upended SHORTWAVE, to show the tight grouping of BULLET
  HOLES which are (one has to admit) pretty damn dead center.

                    All six, right in the ten ring...

  WIDE: as we were, dodging SLUGS and tossing back GRENADES.

                                      RILEY
                    Well, congratulations!  We're trapped!

                                      ARCHER
                    We're not --

    KRUNCH!  The thick oaken door gives inward a little, its rusty
    hinges straining, about to pop clean out of the damp stonework.

                                      ARCHER
                    Trapped.  Okay yeah, we're trapped.

                                    NOAH (O.S.)
                    Uh, why don't we just use that?

  They turn toward Noah, who points to a TRAP DOOR in the floor.

                                      ARCHER
                    Well obviously we're gonna use that.                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     28

  CUT TO the door as KRUNCH!  KRUNCH!  KRAAWNCH!  The pirates
  smash it off its hinges, knocking it off-screen.  Their eyes
  go wide and we CUT TO their POV: the door has fallen on top of
  the trap door, so it looks like Archer et al. just vanished.

                                      PIRATES
                          (collective gasp, then)

43INT. MALORY'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

    Malory wails into the crook of her arm on the desk, a DRINK in
  the other hand.  Cheryl/Carol, in her coat, stands beside her.

                                      MALORY
                    Those dirty pirate bastards!  They
                    killed my baby boy-hoy-hooyyy!

    Cheryl/Carol starts to rub Malory's hair, very tentatively.

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                    Oh now, you don't know that for sure...

    Malory jerks her head up.  Cheryl/Carol yanks her hand away.

                          (gasp)
                    You're right!  That sound could've
                    been anything!  Like... a firecracker! 
                    Orientals are crazy for firecrackers!

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                    Oh my God, and rice?

                                      MALORY
                          (wheels turning)
                    Or maybe Rip shot a pirate, and
                    Sterling yelled "No" because he didn't
                    want to give away their position!

                                      MALORY
                    Yes, you know, I bet they've escaped!

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                      Dragons...

                                      MALORY
                    Because if anyone can escape from a
                    pirate fortress, it's Sterling and
                    Rip.  Especially if they cooperate.

44INT. PIRATE FORTRESS -- VERTICAL SHAFT -- CONTINUOUS

    Archer (on top), Riley (middle) and Noah (bottom) climb down
  using the rusty iron ladder rungs embedded in the damp stone.

                    The feeling's mutual.  Because if my
                    son was as big a bonehead as you --

                    Uh...

    Archer looks up as we hear the TRAP DOOR open.  CUT TO his POV
  to see two pirates looking down at him/us.  KLINK!  One of
  them pulls the pin on a GRENADE and holds it over the shaft.

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)
                          (back to normal)
                    Not really.  Why?

45INT. DUNGEON -- CONTINUOUS

  Noah hangs by his skinny arms from a large round hole in the
    ceiling of... Riley's cell.

                                    NOAH
                    Just curious.

46INT. SHAFT -- CONTINUOUS

  Same (vertical) angle but much closer to the trap door as PING! 
  The pirate lets the striker pop off the GRENADE and drops it.

                                      ARCHER (O.S.)
                    Go go go go go!

                    Waaaagh!

    WHUMP!  We hear them slam into each other, then the ground.

                                    NOAH (O.S.)
                    Oww!

47INT. DUNGEON -- CONTINUOUS

  The trio lies in a heap, Noah squished on the bottom, as the
    GRENADE falls out of the shaft and hits the floor right in
  front of them with a KLUNK then FIZZES for a tiny beat, then

                                      ARCHER
                    Oh, shi --

    KROOOMP!  A blinding flash, a deafening bang, and we CUT TO

48INT. RADIO ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

49INT. DUNGEON -- CONTINUOUS

  The same high-pitched WHINE from before, back in Riley's POV:

    A woozy, double-vision PAN of the grenade-blasted cell: here's
  Noah on his knees, a finger in his ear, mouthing something...
  now here's Archer on his knees before Riley again, yelling:

                                      ARCHER

                      [unintelligible over the whine]

  CUT TO Riley, dazed.  CUT TO Archer, still unintelligible,
  until that same WHOOSH SFX snaps everything back to normal.

                                      ARCHER
                    -- just a flash-bang grenade!  Still
                    super-bad for your ears, though...

                    So when we get outta here, you should
                    go see my ENT doctor, he's good.

                    Are we supposed to get out of here?!

                                      ARCHER
                    Isn't this your cell?

                                      RILEY
                    Yes!

                                      ARCHER
                    So how'd you get out before?

                                      RILEY
                    I bribed Bucky!

                    Huh?

                                      ARCHER
                    That is annoying as shit!
                          (to Riley)
                    And I doubt we can bribe Bucky again,
                    since I crippled his girlfriend...

                                      RILEY
                    So what're we supposed to do now?!

  Beat.

                                      ARCHER
                    I dunno.

50INT. MALORY'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS -- (DAWN?)

    Malory   coat on, purse over her shoulder   stands beside her
  desk.  Cheryl/Carol sits behind the desk, arms crossed, pouting. 
    Behind her, in the monitor, Lana's GREEN DOT is now at Pangu.

                                      MALORY
                    But I may as well go home and rest. 
                    If they haven't escaped already,
                    Lana will be there any time now, and
                    she'll get them out.  And it's not
                    like I can do anything from here...

                                      CHERYL/CAROL
                    Exactly!  So why do I have to stay?!

                          (as she exits)
                    Because Lana may call.  Or because I
                    said so.  Pick one.

51INT. CYRIL'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

  On Cyril, snoring gently, face down at his desk, which is
    covered with printouts, spreadsheets, etc., the bottle of "OLD
    BUNCOMBE" BOURBON and GLASS.  His open door is in background.

                    [snoring gently, maybe mumbling?]

    Malory walks past Cyril's door, backs up a step, WHISTLES.

                                      CYRIL
                    Waagh!

  Cyril jerks bolt upright, maybe knocking over the bottle.                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     34

                                      CYRIL
                    I, um, this is, uh, what was I doing?

                                      MALORY
                    Whatever it was, you better pray it
                    had about three coats of Scotch-Gard.

    Malory gestures with her thumb and we CUT TO see Pam is passed
  out, face down and nude, on Cyril's sofa.  If he has a coffee
  table it has TO-GO PITA and MARGARITA CUP on it (if not on the
    table, the floor).  Pam gives a teeny, high, 1.5 second POOT.

                                      CYRIL
                    And that it wasn't, ick, Pam...

                    [sound of utter disgust]

    Malory makes that sound and exits.  Pam POOTS again, shorter.

                                      CYRIL
                    Ugh...

52EXT. OCEAN -- NIGHT

  The luxury motor yacht sits at anchor offshore, under a sky
    brilliant with stars and just a thumbnail sliver of moon.

                    His narrow twinky ass better not
                    steal the boat, is all I'm saying...

53EXT. BEACH -- CONTINUOUS

  On (what one assumes is) the side of the island opposite the
    lagoon, Lana (from knees up), with a black DUFFEL BAG slung
  over her shoulder, pulls a ZODIAC onto the beach by its bow
    handle and then drops it with a wet THUMP onto the sand.

                                    LANA
                    Oh!  And just, before we get in there,
                    I am not still attracted to Archer! 
                    I'm sure he's still attracted to me,
                    though, I mean, he'd have to be --

    Gillette, a DUFFEL BAG over his shoulder, walks into the shot. 
  He has a PATCH/BANDAGE over his injured eye.  He says nothing.                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     35

                    Uh, blind... not to, um... I am so
                    sorry about that.  Does it hurt?

    SHUNK!  Suddenly they are illuminated by blinding FLOODLIGHTS.

                                      GILLETTE
                    No...

    REVERSE: a half dozen PIRATES are silhouetted in front of some
  huge FLOODLIGHTS, ASSAULT WEAPONS aimed Lana and Gillette-ward.

                    Just professional.

  CUT TO Lana and Gillette, their hands raised in surrender.

54INT. DUNGEON -- CONTINUOUS

    Archer leans his forearms through the bars.  Riley pulls vainly
  on the bars (on the other side of the door from where Archer
  is leaning, keeping door free).  Noah jumps up, repeatedly,
    trying to reach the hole in the ceiling (missing by three feet).

                                      ARCHER
                    We set Noah on fire --

                                    NOAH
                    What?

                                      ARCHER
                    -- and when they come to put him
                    out, we overpower them.

                                      RILEY
                    Don't have a lighter.

                                      ARCHER
                    Well then I'm out of ideas.

                                      BUCKY (O.S.)
                    And also out of luck!                                ARCHER: "Heart of Archness: Part II" (LOCKED)  6/7/11     36


  Bucky strolls in smugly, flanked by two pirates with AK-47's,
  and sets about unlocking the door with some big old-timey KEYS.

                                      BUCKY
                    Because no rescue for you, Archer! 
                    We catch your friends on beach!

    Gillette walks into the shot, HANDCUFFED behind his back.  He
  walks past Archer, and into the now open cell, without a word.

                                      ARCHER
                    My -- Ray?!  Holy shit, where'd you --
                          (starts laughing)
                    -- get that eyepatch?!  What're you,
                    in pirate disguise?!  Good job, buddy!

  Now Lana walks into the shot, HANDCUFFED behind her back. 

    Riley's eyebrow slides up ("She's hot!") when he sees her, but
  we quickly CUT TO Archer, very nearly spluttering with relief,
  his mocking tone now gone, replaced by (actual) genuine feeling.

                                      ARCHER
                    Lana?!  You, you came all this way?! 
                    To rescue me?  Oh my God...

                                    LANA
                    [takes a breath, about to speak]

                                      ARCHER
                          (a shithead again)
                    Still got it pretty bad for me, huh?

  Lana exhales, walks into the cell.  KLANG!  Bucky slams the
  door closed behind her.  Archer grins, starts to chuckle.

                                      ARCHER
                    [starts to chuckle]

                                    LANA
                    Archer, don't you --

                                      ARCHER
                    Woooooo!

  And as he flashes Lana that shit-eating grin (yet again), we
