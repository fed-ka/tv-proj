We TRACK through the living room, passing framed photos of an
athletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as
she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her
side.
WOMAN
(into phone)
Yes Donna, I'm out the door.
We TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the
kitchen, unable to see her face.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
Just inform Kayleigh that
anesthesia is on the way to prep
the epidural and I'll be there as
soon as I can.
Still looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently
straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she
talks.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
And promise her she's about to have
a woooonnderful labor.
As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her
HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket.
They give each other a silent wave.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
Right, I'll see you in twenty.
She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME
AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but
ready for the day ahead.
JESSICA
Buenas dias, Rosario.
ROSARIO
Good morning Miss Jessica.
Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY.
In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads
for the back door carrying the basket of laundry.
MALE VOICE
(on machine)
Honey? Honey, wake up.
Pick up the-
And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips--
SLAMM!! The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN
storm in, wearing SKI-MASKS. Everything is a whirlwind of
quick cuts, noise and confusion.
Jessica's DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup! -- is
stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark.
Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM --
LEAD GUNMAN
Get away from there! Don't touch
that -- !!
-- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM!!
He
blows her away, too. The Gunman curses, then turns on
Jessica.
LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)
(dire)
Where is he?
Jessica cringes.
JESSICA
Where is who?
LEAD GUNMAN
Wrong answer.
The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the
face, knocking Jessica cold.
Then he turns to his men.
LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)
Search the house.
And as the answering machine fills the silence:
CRAIG VO
(on machine)
-I'll call back later.
The LEAD GUNMAN spins around, and we PUSH INTO the blackness
of his masked face.
MATCH CUT TO:
A door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing
the dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the
room and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she
frantically pulls her blindfold off to see--
THE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER
Standing in front of her.
Sturdier than the rest.
Solid.
Imposing.
JESSICA
Wh... what do you want?
Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her.
Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze...
Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room.
Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her
throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT.
Grim as death, he stalks toward her --
JESSICA (CONT'D)
No, wait..
And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS --
JESSICA (CONT'D)
NO!
PLEASE--//
SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above
Jessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that
hung there.
As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns
and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking
Jessica in the darkness.
Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to
show through. Trembling, tears running down her face,
Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic--
JESSICA (CONT'D)
Wha... what the hell is happening?!
The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE OCEAN
Skimming along the water.
And we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern
California, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICA
PIER.
ANGLE ON - ARCADE GAME SCREEN.
The screen displays a car-race arcade game. A computer
generated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed.
Playing the sit-down game, DAYTONA USA, is:
RYAN ACKERMAN, early twenties, looks like he grew up on the
beach without so much as a pot to piss in. His lethal
reflexes and bold recklessness, however, have made him a Jedi
Master of the game.
Ryan's score approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the
screen.
RYAN
You recording this?
CHAD (OS)
Yeah, sure...
CHAD, his best bud, aims a BLUE TOOTH VIDEOSTREAMING
CELLPHONE at some CUTE GIRLS instead. We can see their faces
on the tiny SCREEN of the cellphone.
Ryan's car gets caught behind a blue speedster, then passes
on the shoulder.
RYAN
Move, bitch.
He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes "NEW RECORD."
Nearby, a KID watching the game nods.
KID
Nice.
The HIGH SCORE starts rising to match Ryan's score.
RYAN
Get that?
Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down
the front of his tattered shorts. And he's freeballing it.
CHAD
Check it; Attack of the Bubblegum
Monster in Hi-Def videostream-
RYAN
C'mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on
that.
Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the
cellphone out of his pants and hits "SEND".
CHAD
(through cup-holding
teeth)
Sweet. It's going to my email
right now.
S9me soda inadvertently SPILLS onto the cellphone and Chad
wipes it dry on his pants.
RYAN
Watch it dude, I gotta return that
thing in seven days.
CHAD
They aren't giving you shit yet?
RYAN
Nah, whenever I return it, I just
list off why the phone sucks and
they give me a new model. Figure
by the tenth time I'll have to go
somewhere else.
Ryan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames.
Game Over.
CUT TO:
THE OCEAN
As seen looking over the rail of the pier.
The tide is in,
but it's still a forty foot drop.
RYAN stares over the railing like a death row inmate
contemplating his last meal.
CHAD
Go already. No one's looking.
His left hand holds his WALLET.
CHAD (CONT'D)
(re: wallet)
Need me to hold that?
Ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips
a zipper, tucks a Velcro flap. Pats his pocket proudly.
RYAN
Waterproof.
But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left
leg starts trembling like crazy.
RYAN (CONT'D)
This is stupid. I could get
killed. Pick another dare.
Chad lowers the phone, irritated.
CHAD
My ass. Not after you made me
march in the Gay Pride Parade
wearing a thong.
RYAN
Screw it then. In one... Two...
Two and a half--
CHAD
Whole numbers only, Rabbitfoot.
Ryan stares at the waves crashing below. His leg starts
snaking like crazy... And he chickens out, hopping back to
the deck.
CHAD (CONT'D)
Just so you know, I'm emailing this
to every chick you ever met.
But suddenly Ryan's oblivious to the dare.
His eyes are
glued to something else--
CHAD (CONT'D)
(speaking like HAL 900)
Transmitting pussy file now.
CHLOE, early 20s, a head turner, confident, funny; she can
pull you in like a tractor beam. She and some CUTE FRIENDS
carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the
"Heal The Bay" rally.
Ryan walks over like he owns the place.
RYAN
Got any more? I'm here to help.
CHLOE
Thanks, but no, we got 'em all.
RYAN
What's in 'em?
Chloe opens the box.
Hands him a "Heal The Bay" pamphlet.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Cool, you're handing these out
during the concert?
CHLOE
Yeah, wanna help?
Ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart.
RYAN
Hell yeah.
I'm all about "Heal the
Bay. "
His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup
thing, of course...
An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder,
pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so
Ryan can see it. Piece of cake, now.
RYAN (CONT'D)
We've collected water samples with
the Stream Team, raised money on
the Promenade... I'm surprised I
haven't seen you.
He offers his hand.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Ryan.
She takes it.
CHLOE
Chloe.
The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and
they both smile at each other. Chad splits.
CHLOE (CONT'D)
I can't tell if you're full of it.
Ryan stops posturing, gets real.
RYAN
You ever go up to Santa Barbara?
My dad used to take me there all
RYAN (CONT'D)
the time. Their pier is amazing,
clear water, huge crabs everywhere,
oysters right there on the rocks,
starfish... Hard to believe it's
the same ocean sometimes.
He's managed to win her back.
CHLOE
Maybe you and I can take a break
later when Pat Benatar goes on.
RYAN
Sounds like a plan.
There's a moment...
Then --
CHLOE
Oh no -- I forgot. I still have to
pick up a box of T-shirts at the
Kinkos on Venice.
RYAN
I'll do it for you... if you want.
CHLOE
Seriously, you would?
RYAN
Sure.
How much is the bill?
CHLOE
Nothing.
It's been paid up front.
RYAN
Do you promise not to go anywhere?
CHLOE
Done.
Ryan makes a graceful exit.
Turns back.
RYAN
Okay, I won't be long.
CHLOE
(laughing)
Bye.
Ryan grabs Chad, and as they walk out of earshot:
RYAN
Dude, does Santa Barbara have a
harbor or a pier?

ECU - A TANGLE OF PHONE WIRES
12
Their insulation picked off and spliced together. PAN ALONG 12
the attic floor, past the rubble of the shattered phone,
foll9wing the crudely repaired wires to JESSICA'S HANDS,
tapping the dialer wires together. She's trying so hard to
simulate a NUMERIC PULSE that she almost doesn't hear:
RYAN (VO)
Hello...?
Jessica's hands go suddenly still, then -- WHOOM! -- her head
slams down INTO FRAME on top of the crushed earpiece, a
desperate hope filling her eyes.
CUT BACK TO:

With still no answer, Ryan pulls the phone from his ear --
RYAN
Whatever.
Signing off-

female voice on the other end.
JESSICA (VO)
Wait!
Don't hang up!
Ryan puts the phone back to his ear.
RYAN
Hello?
JESSICA (VO)
There's not much time! I need you
to go to the police. My name is
Jessica Martin; I've been kidnapped!
RYAN
(not buying)
Oh really? Kidnapped, huh?

j.j
JESSICA (VO)
Please. I know what you're
thinking, but it's real! I'm in an
attic somewhere. I think they're
going to kill me! You need to-
RYAN
Awfully polite kidnappers to give
you a phone...
Jessica's voice TREMBLES uncontrollably.
Desperate, fearful
and frustrated.
JESSICA (VO)
No!
You don't understand!
Suddenly, the cellphone BLIPS twice in Ryan's ear.
He pulls
it away and looks at its faceplate.
14
INSERT SHOT - THE CELLPHONE

The LCD reads:
CALL WAITING.
ACCEPT?
15
16
A WIDER SHOT so we see Jessica's bound hands. Her bruised
face. Whispering frantically into the DEMOLISHED TELEPHONE
she's JERI-RIGGING back together as she talks.
JESSICA (VO)
Goddamn it, listen to me! The
phone I'm on...it's shattered!
There's no dialer! I've been
clicking wires together for hours
trying to get someone, anyone, and
you 're the only connection I was
able to make!
(important beat)
If you hang up, I may not get
anyone else.

INTERCUT CALL - RYAN IN FORD BRONCO/JESSICA BOUND IN ATTIC

SFX: Ryan's call waiting BLIPS again.
He considers
everything Jessica has said, then:
RYAN
Hmm. Sucks to be you. Try crank
yanking someone else. Late.

JESSICA
Wait!
Don't hang up!
DON'T HANG UP!!
But -- CLICK!
Ryan flashes over to the next call.
RYAN

A TELEMARKETER checks Ryan's name on a list, then glances at
the script.
TELEMARKETER

you the benefits of Mastercharge
Credit Union's-
RYAN (VO)
Awesome, I can totally use a credit
card. Tell me more.
TELEMARKETER
Absolutely.
We've lowered our APR-
RYAN
-Shucks, now's really not a good
time, but why don't I get your
number and get back to you later.
TELEMARKETER
Sure, it's 818...
RYAN
That's the office number?
TELEMARKETER
Yes.
RYAN
Why don't you give me your number
instead. That way I can call you
when you're having dinner with your
family.
A beat.
TELEMARKETER
Sorry to have bothered you.
Click!
The Telemarketer hangs up.
RYAN
Damn skippy.
And that's when he notices the message flashing on the
phone's faceplate: CALL ON HOLD. Ryan clicks the FLASH
button to pick it up...and Jessica is still there.
INTERCUT CALL - RYAN IN CAR/JESSICA IN ATTIC

JESSICA (VO)

RYAN
You still there? You're getting
kinda creepy, lady. See ya.
JESSICA
No!
Don't! They're going to kill
me!
They're going to kill me!!
A silent beat.
A calculated look in her eyes...
RYAN pulls the phone from his ear and is about to hang
up...when he hears the one sound that stops all men cold.
On the other end, Jessica begins to CRY.
RYAN
Oh, it's like that, huh?
Nice with
the fake tears, lady...
JESSICA
Please...
I just need help.
But Ryan won't be manipulated.
RYAN
You need acting lessons. Now go take
your meds and bug someone else.
JESSICA
These men!!!--
Jessica stops herself short, quieting the rising hysteria in
her voice before it gives her away. She glances anxiously at
the attic door, then continues, more in control.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
These men killed my housekeeper.
My dog. You have to help me.
Ryan bristles at being saddled with anything, much less this.
RYAN
No, actually( I don't. Not with a
hot chick waiting for me at the
pier.
JESSICA
Please...you're my only hope.
(beat)
What's your name?
That catches Ryan off-guard.
He stalls, not wanting to make
this personal.
RYAN
Why, you writing a book--?

x?
JESSICA
--Please, just tell me your name!
Ryan glances around the street, his eyes falling on a stone
fountain outside a French Restaurant.
RYAN
Uh...Johnny. Johnny Fountain.
JESSICA
Johnny... What if it was your
mother who was calling for help?
How would you feel?
RYAN
Well, I'd be damn impressed,
considering she's dead.
JESSICA
Goddamn it, how difficult is it to
hand this phone off to the police?!
I'll pay you!
RYAN
How much?
JESSICA
Five thousand dollars.
RYAN
Sure you will. I'm hanging up now.
JESSICA
No, wait! WAIT!! Even if there's
a eighty percent chance I'm lying,
you nave a one in five chance to
make five grand f9r a lousy twenty
minutes of your life.
(panics as Ryan is silent)
Haven't you ever bet on a horse or
bought a Lottery ticket? I'm
talking one-in-five odds, twenty

Ryan slaps the radio off.

OFFICERS manhandle a drunk toward the back, a HOOKER screams
at us with unholy rage, in the far corner, a JUNKIE spits on

through invisible soup.
Sounds are distant, eerily muffled.
A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE

BOB MOONEY'S EYES.
Concerned, but not panicked.
MOONEY'S POV. Still surreal, SLOW-MOTION, as an Officer with
a CREWCUT responds by spinning the Junkie's face into a wall,
legal but hard.

WHAM!! Back to reality when a YOUNG GANGBANGER is slammed
into the station desk by a ROOKIE.
ROOKIE OFFICER
Problem, Mooney. If I put this one

be a bloodbath.
GANGBANGER
Put me in there! I'll waste all
them pussies!
REVEAL SERGEANT BOB MOONEY -- a tough, fifty-something beat
cop who's fighting growing old every step of the way. He
rolls his eyes at the situation and takes a bite of PIZZA.
MOONEY
Come on Powell, put the Sharks with
the Sharks, the Jets with the Jets
and make room.
Rookie Powell suppresses his irritation and roughly yanks the
Gangbanger back over to the holding cells.
Mooney puts down the pizza, no appetite, and stares at the
news story playing on the TV mounted in the corner.

ON THE TELEVISION

a NEWS REPORTER is in the middle of a segment. Over him,
FOOTAGE rolls of six guilty-looking cops testifying in court;
being led away in handcuffs.
NEWS REPORTER
...was somber when the indictments
came down this afternoon in the
23rd Precinct corruption scandal.
Though the names of six police
officers were read aloud, the
District Attorney stated that this
was merely the "tip of the iceberg"
and that unfortunately many other
arrests are likely to be coming as
the investigations proceed.

MOONEY
Dirty pricks deserve what they get.
Public hates us enough without this
shit.
DETECTIVE TOMLIN
(leaving)
There's good men over there.
A FEMALE OFFICER passes Mooney and reaches for his box of
pizza.
FEMALE OFFICER
Mooney? What are you doing?
You can't
be eating this crap.
Mooney plants his own firm grip on the box.
MOONEY
Keep walking, Shelly.
Nothing to
see here.
A friendly tug of war.
FEMALE OFFICER
You sure you wanna do that?
What
would your wife say?
That's it. Mooney snatches his lunch back and turns to
lecture this little girl.
MOONEY
She'd say nothing, 'cause she's not
gonna know about it! Christ, Shel,
my old man had eleven heart
attacks. Eleven! I have one
little infarction and you guys
start treating me like an invalid!
I'm a grown man! Leave me alone,

FEMALE OFFICER
(abashed)
I was merely referring to your

Mooney sighs and lifts his pizza to his mouth when --
WHAMM! The station doors burst open and two dozen GANG

MOONEY
is busy doing ten things at once. Signing release papers.
Booking a DRUNK whose wife-beater Tee is drenched in blood,
Etc.
RYAN
Excuse me, officer --
But Mooney ignores him in favor of the three cops that
suddenly need arrest sheets signed.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Hey, I've got an emergency here --
Just then, CREWCUT OFFICER shoulders his way through with a

relief that he didn't spot the phone. But her victory is

Instantly, a hulk of a man (DEASON) and an arrogant, red-
headed prick (ELLIS) stand and exit the house.
As Greer stalks away( BOOM DOWN the bar to REVEAL a telephone
sitting there, unnoticed by the men -- and on its face, the
LINE-IN-USE INDICATOR LIGHT is lit.
PUSH IN on the flashing orange light that threatens to give
Ryan and Jessica's call away. Closer and closer, until we
ENTER the phone and TRAVEL THROUGH THE WIRES to --

A MATCHING LIGHT ON RYAN'S CELLPHONE

As we PULL BACK we see that we're in the Ford Bronco, racing
through:

Trying to catch the Escalade, a quarter-mile ahead. Ryan
feels completely conspicuous in the security car as he
slaloms through the streets of East Hollywood.
JESSICA (VO)
What's happening, Ryan?!
RYAN
Don't worry, I can fix this.
JESSICA (VO)
Oh my God.
There are three cars between Ryan and the Escalade.
RYAN
It's okay, I can see them ahead.
31.

JESSICA (VO)
Don't lose them! If you follow them
back here, you can tell the police
where they're holding us!
RYAN
Okay.

The mountainous Deason drives as Ellis sits shotgun. In the
back sits Jessica's son, RICKY; who eyes the two men
suspiciously. CCR plays on the RADIO.
Ellis, turns down the radio.
Faking sincerity, he turns to
face Ricky.
ELLIS
(gesturing to the radio)
Do you want me to change the
station to something else?
Ricky refuses to answer.
Ellis turns around, his fake smile
quickly vanishing.
ELLIS (CONT'D)
Yeah.
I like Creedence too.
He's about to turn the radio volume up when --
RICKY
Where's Rosario?
ELLIS
I told you, kid, she had a doctor's
appointment, so your mother asked
us to pick you up. Don't worry,
you'll see your mommy in a few
minutes.
Ricky nods... but we can tell by the look on his face that
he's not buying their story one bit.
CUT BACK TO:

SMASH!!! The car goes through the window and RACES down the
center aisle. CAR SALESMEN and PATRONS are forced to dive
out of the way as the rent-a-cop car MOWS DOWN DISPLAYS and
everything else in its path.

The mountainous Deason drives. In back, Ellis sits with

Anyone following us?
Deason checks:

We see the bus about five car lengths behind, but the rent-a-

Deason flashes an evil grin.

Mooney changes out of his blues, his ears glued to THREE COPS
in the corner, boasting about an arrest.
COP ONE
-- so of course everyone's playing
dumb to what kind of drugs he's on.
The cops start to snicker; they've all heard that one before.
COP ONE (CONT'D)
So I start searching the place.
I'm about to open a closet door
when a kid with a Mac 10 jumps out
of the bathroom. He shoots.
Misses me and hits one of the
E.M.T's. Fires again, but the gun
jams and BAM! Blows half his face
off. Had enough black tar heroin
in the closet to resurface the 405.
Mooney tries to join in on the conversation.
MOONEY
It must've been around '84, when...
The Cops turn around, while grabbing their stuff.

COP TWO
Sorry Moon, we're late for a
briefing.
Mooney waves them on, but looks disappointed for not being
able to join in.
DEEP MALE VOICE (O.S.)
I'll bet in your day you had some
stories.
Mooney whips his head around to see DETECTIVE JACK TOMLIN.
MOONEY
Hey Tomlin.
DETECTIVE TOMLIN
Taking off?
MOONEY
(hardly thrilled)
My anniversary. You know, duty
calls; pricey dinner and then some
crap-ass play.
(beat)
Hey, I sent some college kid down
to see you this morning. Had some
rap about a kidnapping --
DETECTIVE TOMLIN
I haven't seen anyone, but I'll ask
around. Kidnapping, huh?
MOONEY
I thought it was a prank at first,
but the kid was so worked up--
DETECTIVE TOMLIN
Well, don't you get worked up.
(slaps Mooney's chest)
If the kid comes back, page me, and
I'll be sure to see him.
MOONEY
(swallowing his pride)
Yeah. Okay, Jack. Thanks.

JESSICA (VO)
Goddamn it, stop thinking about

everything to them later!
SUDDENLY -- SFX: RYAN'S PHONE BEGINS BEEPING.
RYAN
What now?
Ryan pulls the phone away from his ear and checks it out.
INSERT SHOT - CELLPHONE FACE PLATE
The BATTERY INDICATOR is flashing:
LOW BATT.
LOW BATT.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Great!
Now the battery's dying.
JESSICA
Don't you have a charger?
RYAN
It's in my car!
Hold on.
SFX:
BEEP-BEEP!
The battery indicator has lost another bar.
Ryan fumbles around in the armrest. Finds nothing. Opens
the glovebox and -- a snub-nosed .38 SPECIAL tumbles out.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Jesus -- !
JESSICA
What's going on? Did you find one?
RYAN
(staring at the gun)
Not exactly...
SFX:
BEEP-BEEP!!
Jessica starts growing afraid.
JESSICA
Johnny, don't lose me!
RYAN
Well what the hell do you expect me
to do?!
Just then, Ryan rounds a corner -- and sees traffic GRIDLOCKED

almost immediately boxed in.
SFX:
BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!
JESSICA
Johnny--!

RYAN
I know, Jessica!
The phone starts a STEADY BEEPING now, dying imminent. And
traffic isn't going anywhere. Ryan looks around desperately.
Nothing. No emergency lane. No shoulder. Just a long drop
down a HILL to a strip mall below--
STRIP MALL?! Ryan scans it and does a double-take on one of
the store's signs: "VERIZON WIRELESS".
Traffic inches forward. Now he sees an OFF-RAMP a quarter-
mile ahead -- but at this rate, it'll take forever to make it
there.
SFX:
BEEP-BEEP-BEEP...'.'
Ryan's got to do something.

We hear Jessica's
outgoing message, then a BEEP and-
MALE VOICE

Jessica? Damn, where are you?

I called earlier and... Jess, I'm
in serious trouble. I can't explain
right now, but we're all in danger.

Just as the phone literally dies -- Ryan rips a new CHARGER
from its packaging, slaps it into the phone and voila, it
begins CHARGING.
RYAN
Whew!
That was so no bueno!
JESSICA (VO)
You found a charger?
RYAN
Among other things...
Ryan glances at piles of phone gear he's appropriated from
Verizon. EARBUD MIKES. MANUALS. RECEPTION BOOSTERS.

INTERCUT CALL - RYAN IN CAR/JESSICA IN ATTIC

Ryan fiddles with the now war-torn phone.
JESSICA
Thank you for doing all this,
Johnny.
RYAN
Yeah, look, about that...
(awkward beat)
My-name isn't really Johnny
Fountain.
JESSICA
Good, it sounded like a porn star
name.
(then softly)
It's okay. I know. You don't have
to tell me --
RYAN
It's Ryan. Ryan Ackerman. I'm a
bar-back. I'm twenty-two, and just
a little freaked out right now.
Jessica is moved with emotion by his honesty.
JESSICA
Thank you, Ryan.
But before they can say any more, suddenly--
SFX: FEET ON THE STAIRS - COMING TOWARD THE ATTIC!
Jessica JUMPS with a start. Tries to push the PHONE GUTS
behind a beam with her foot as Greer enters -- but fails.
The receiver sits in front of the beam, EXPOSED!
Greer crosses the room and sits on a box next to Jessica.
He
stares at her for long, uncomfortable moments. Then:

Greer's question still hangs in the air.
JESSICA
N-no...
Jessica scoots away, trying to draw Greer's eyes in another
direction from the phone that lies OUT IN THE OPEN.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
...but I am going to, aren't I?
GREER
Up to you. Your husband left a
message asking you to meet him in
left field. Where's that?
JESSICA
What?
I don't understand--?
Greer winds up and BAM! Hits Jessica in the stomach, knocking
the wind out of her and causing her to fall to the ground.
GREER
--A base ball field !? Wh ich o ne
does he mean?!
JESSICA
(choking out the words)
I... I don't know what you want me
to say. I swear--
GREER
Shut up!!! Which field?! He
wouldn't leave a message that
didn't make sense to you!
Greer tightens his fist and is about to hit Jessica again--
JESSICA
Wait! The bleachers behind left
field at Dodger Stadium! That's
where we first met.
43.
54
54
Greer stares at Jessica for a long uncomfortable moment,
searching her soul. She's lying.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
Please! Believe me. That has to
be where he means. I swear to God.
Then he stands, looking away for just a moment -- but long
enough for Jessica to NUDGE the phone back behind the beam!
GREER
Working in my profession as long as
I have, you begin to recognize the
truth when you hear it.
Jessica, trembling, hangs on Greer's every word.
GREER (CONT'D)
(turning back)
Go to the window, Jessica. There's
something I want you to see.
Relieved at hiding the phone, Jessica gets up and moves to
the attic window -- and GASPS.
55
JESSICA'S POV - THE YARD BELOW
55
Down in the yard below, Jessica's eleven-year-old son Ricky
stands uncomfortably in the middle of a basketball half-court
as one of the kidnappers (a severe-looking ex-con named
HODGES) stands nearby, watching.
56
56
Jessica's knees nearly buckle.
JESSICA
Ricky!

Jessica sees her son start shooting the ball -- completely
oblivious to Hodges, who flicks open his coat, revealing
SILENCED PISTOL tucked into his waistband.

Down below, Ricky shoots baskets, unaware of Hodges closing
his hand around his gun.
GREER

JESSICA
Please!
Please, believe me!
Ricky plays innocently -- while Hodges now COCKS his pistol.
GREER

Frantic, Jessica locks eyes with Hodges, silently pleading
for him not to do this. Hodges stares back with glacial ice.
JESSICA

Ricky backs up to retrieve a high rebound. Jessica watches
in horror as Hodges begins to slowly DRAW HIS GUN.

GREER

Most people don't get past two.
Greer signals, and:

Jessica watches as her son is led away to the GUEST HOUSE
across the yard. Once he's inside and out of view, Jessica
collapses in a heap on the floor.
Greer is about to exit the attic -- when Jessica speaks.
JESSICA
You won't get away with this.
When I didn't show up at the
hospital, someone must have called
the police--

Jessica hears it first. The pumping cacophony coming from
the phone behind the beam. It's subtle at first, but grows
increasingly louder. She closes her eyes, praying Greer
won't hear it--
But Greer does hear it. On the verge of leaving the room,
Greer stops. Cocks an ear. Instantly, Jessica tries to
cover it with her own voice.
JESSICA
Do you honestly expect me to
believe we're going to walk away
from this alive?
But Greer isn't listening to her. He strides back into the
room, listening to the noise under her voice.
GREER
(to Jessica)
Shut up.

Oblivious of Jessica desperately trying to clue him in.
JESSICA (VO)
How can I SHUT UP? You threaten to

Suddenly, it hits Ryan like a punch to the face.
And he
scrambles, trying to cover the phone.
RYAN
Oh shit!

BUT AT EXACTLY THE SAME MOMENT --

Ryan finds the MUTE BUTTON.
Presses it and--

Greer listens intently... and HEARS NOTHING but silence in

RYAN
You can't know that for sure.
JESSICA

Jessica tries another tack.
JESSICA
Look, I have no right to ask you
this Ryan, but you re my family's

Something in the way she says that last sentence, a mixture
of strength and vulnerability, gets through to Ryan.

herself in an OLD MIRROR standing in the corner.
Bruised.
Clothes torn. Staring at her own cracked reflect

breaks down, but silently this time, locked in he r own
personal hell.
For Ryan, the silence is deafening. Despite his frantic
driving, he feels her pain. And hates being unable to help.

There's an emotional beat, then--
JESSICA
Do you think God will forgive me?
RYAN
What do you mean--?
JESSICA

Ryan is moved by the emotion in her voice.
RYAN
Jessica, they have your kid. You
had no choice.
JESSICA
I don't know. I don't know...

My son and I are going to die here,

maybe I could've saved Craig...
The truth of this has a profound effect on Ryan. And just
when Jessica is about to lose herself to despair --
Ryan finds a resolve within himself even he didn't know he
had.
RYAN
Jessica, listen to me. I promise
you, I'm not going to let that

There is a moment between them, two people connecting on a

But the moment is suddenly cut short as a STATICKY VOICE
start bleeding into their phone call -- some BRITISH ASSHOLE
having his own phone call.
BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO)

Cadillac XLR convertible. No, you

Look woman, tell your kidnapping

Ryan sees Simon Cowell MOUTH THE WORDS "STUPID COW" in synch

Ryan floors the Rent-a-cop car ahead of the Cadillac and
PULLS A 90 DEGREE turn at an intersection; cutting Cowell
off!
SCREEEECH! Cowell, trying to avoid a collision, SLAMS on the
brakes, causing the Cadillac to SKID twenty feet.
Ryan jumps out of the rent-a-cop car he's left in the middle
or the intersection and runs over to the Cadillac, banging on
the window with the .38 Special.
Cowell practically jumps out of his skin at the sight of the

Her voice says she can't believe her ears.
Relieved, Ryan jumps in the Cadillac XLR and tosses his phone
on the passenger seat, next to a LAPTOP computer. Guns the
engine and STOMPS the gas.
As he passes the ruins of his rent-a-cop car, he slows just
enough to open the Cadillac's door and snatch up his bag of
Verizon goodies laying on the pavement -- then peels away.
Practically frothing at the mouth, Simon Cowell chases after
on foot, cursing as his beautiful new Cadillac disappears in
the distance --
SIMON COWELL

WHIP PAN AROUND to see what Ryan's staring at. Just ahead,
JESSICA'S ESCALADE is pulling up to the curb.
JESSICA (VO)
What?
RYAN
Your car's here.
Ryan pulls along side the red curb and watches as four tough-
looking men exit the vehicle. We recognize them as Greer,
Deason, Ellis and Hodges.
JESSICA (VO)
Hurry, Ryan! Just find Craig!
Ryan hops out -- but stops when the car CALLS OUT TO HIM.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
Wait, Ryan! What about me--?!
Ryan searches the car and finds the HANDSET in the armrest.
As he grabs it and races after Greer into the airport, a
Traffic Cop comes up to the car.
TRAFFIC COP
HEY, YOU CAN'T PARK HERE!!
But it's too late.
Ryan's already gone.

Greer and his men stride through the airport like sharks
honing in on bleeding prey.
Soon, the Kidnappers break up into two groups: Greer and
Ellis heading for the DEPARTURE GATES; Deason and Hodges go
the other way towards the INFORMATION KIOSK.

Ryan heads toward the --

Greer, who waits in the LINE OF PASSENGERS waiting to pass
through airport's METAL DETECTORS. This is Ryan's chance.
He cuts through the line.
RYAN
Oops. Excuse me. Pardon me. My
grandmother needs her walker...
Soon, he makes his way to the front, right behind Greer and
BUMPS into him. As he does, NOTICE --
ECU of Ryan slyly slipping the rent-a-cop's tiny .38 Special
into Greer's heavy motorcycle jacket.
Greer turns, glaring -- But no one's there.
Greer looks around, and there's a heart-stopping moment that
we're afraid he's going to notice Ryan, who now stands
innocently the next line over--
--but Greer's eyes pass right over him as he scans the crowd.
Ryan breathes a sigh of relief as Greer finally turns away to
walk through the metal detector and...
SFX:
BZZZZZZZTTH
...sets off the alarm.
DETECTOR OPERATOR
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind
emptying your pockets over here?
Confused, Greer does. He lays his wallet on the table, then
his keys... Then looks baffled as he pulls out -- the GUN 1
DETECTOR OPERATOR (CONT'D)
Code red!
Code red!
The response she gets is stunning. SECURITY GUARDS jump out
of the woodwork with guns drawn. ALARMS go off. SECURITY
GATES start coming down. Travelers start SCREAMING and
PANICKING!
SECURITY GUARDS
GET DOWN!
GET ON THE GROUND!!
ELLIS
(reaching for something)
Wait, this is a mistake--
TENSE GUARD
HANDS/
HANDS!!
As one, the entire security force POUNCES on Greer and Ellis,
TACKLING them to the ground and IMMOBILIZING their limbs.

And while that chaos is going on, Ryan slowly backs through
to the metal detector...and starts running for Left Field.

GREER AND ELLIS are crushed under the dogpile of security.
Behind them, a door slams open and a formation of NATIONAL
GUARDSMEN race on-scene, showing just how seriously security
is taken in the wake of Sept. 11th.

Ryan jogs down the concourse when--
PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM
Attention travelers. Due to a
security problem, all persons are
required to clear the terminal and
return immediately to the security
checkpoint at the entrance to
Concourse B...
At once, everyone begins filing out of the terminal. Ryan
looks like a salmon swimming upstream, the only figure moving
against the tide of people rushing to get out.
JESSICA (VO)
"Left Field" is in Terminal C.
RYAN
Listen to me! They're clearing the
terminal. Before your husband passes
me, what does he look like?
JESSICA (VO)
He's thirty-eight. Six feet.
Trim
build. Thinning hair...
RYAN
(scanning the passengers)
That's not enough! What's he
wearing?
JESSICA (VO)
I don't know! We have completely
different schedules. I was fast
aslee p--
(thinking it through)
-- A suit... He wears glasses,
thick rims, like Buddy Holly or--
Bingo! The Buddy Holly glasses is what did it. Ryan sees a
man in the distance hurrying in his direction -- CRAIG.
RYAN
Found him!
59.
91
91
And just as Ryan bee-lines it towards Craig--
VOICE (OS)
Excuse me, sir--
Ryan turns and finds a NATIONAL GUARDSMAN right behind him.
NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
You can't be here now. You have to
leave the area.
RYAN
But --
NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
Now, sir.
And as Ryan is marched away he sees--

GREER AND ELLIS

Knees in their necks.
Hands covering their faces.
GREER

can explain! Someone reach into my
coat pocket! Goddamn it, reach
into my pocket!
*'V
A YOUNG GUARDSMAN does -- and in a big reveal, we see that he
WITHDRAWS A BADGE. A Los Angeles policeman's badge...
Ryan's jaw drops.
He can't believe it -- they're cops?!
YOUNG GUARDSMAN
Hey, this one's on the job.
RYAN
Holy shit, Jessica, these guys are
cops!
JESSICA (VO)
What?!
The Guardsman's SUPERIOR OFFICER examines it.
Is it real?
SUPERIOR OFFICER
Run it.
(the Guardsman runs off;
turns back to Greer)
Is that your gun?
GREER
(hesitates)
--yes. Yes. It's my piece.
SUPERIOR OFFICER
Well, you're supposed to declare it.

GREEK
I know. We just got focused on a

Just then, the Young Guardsman returns.
YOUNG GUARDSMAN

Ryan looks relieved when the airport's alarms SHUT OFF._ The
P.A. system cheerily thanks everyone for their cooperation
and, all around, security gates begin to rise.
RYAN
(noticing; to Guard)
Hey, can I go now? Can I go?!
The Guard nods, and Ryan takes off like a shot, racing back
towards the bar.
Ryan spots Craig Martin outside the Left Field sports bar.
Ryan grabs him by the elbow and starts hustling him through
the concourse.
CRAIG
Hey, what the hell?!
Get your
hands off m--!!
RYAN
Shut up and keep walking. If they
see us they'll kill us both.
CRAIG
What--?
RYAN
Your wife sent me.
CRAIG
She did?
But how--?
RYAN
Would you hurry your ass?! You
need to hide. They're here, and
they're looking for you. They
already have your family.
Craig looks at him, growing terrified.

I don't
know how to repay you...
An awkward, emotional pause falls between them.
RYAN
Forget about the cash. Just get you
and y9ur son home safely and we'll
call it even.
JESSICA
I will.
I promise.
RYAN (VO)
I know you will.
RYAN hands the cellphone over to Craig.
RYAN (CONT'D)
I'm gonna be outside this door.
Don't come out unless I get you.
Got it?
CRAIG

Okay.
Ryan walks out the restroom door as Craig puts the phone to

GREEK
I didn't.
ELLIS

Something weird is going on.
Greer stares daggers at everyone he passes.
Ellis Io9ks around before glancing down at a PHOTO COPY of a
California driver's license.

Trying to act inconspicuous, Ryan guards the entrance to the
Men's Room. He's starts to check out a magazine rack at an
adjacent concession stand when he hears:
CRAIG
HEY, RYAN?
RYAN!
Ryan turns. RACK FOCUS past Ryan to Craig standing fifty
feet back, holding the phone out.
CRAIG (CONT'D)
This isn't my wife.

As it sinks in.
Disbelief.
Anger.
Dread.
CRAIG (CONT'D)
My wife's name is Patty. I'm not
Craig. I'm Paul. Paul Boyd.
In utter disbelief, Ryan turns back toward the gate -- and
sees Greer, Ellis, Hodges and Deason, cornering another MAN.
Tall. Lean. Thinning hair.
And wearing Buddy Holly glasses.

Craig's eyes swell with fear.
CRAIG
Who, what?... No one!
Nobody!
GREER
Answer me!
Greer looks around the crowded airport.
CRAIG
I'll forget I saw anything, just
leave them alone!
Whatever.
Greer manhandles Craig toward the exit.
GREER
For your family's sake, you better
not have done anything stupid.
RYAN snatches the phone from the bogus Craig Martin -- and
hauls ass through a sea of travelers, trying to catch up to --
GREER AND ELLIS
"x
who scan the crowd bulling their way through throngs of
people, leading Craig Martin between them.
BUT RYAN
Has more difficulty. Gets STALLED and SWEPT AWAY in the
crowd long enough for the kidnappers to make it outside--

To their car. Craig is forced into the ESCALADE between
Greer and Ellis.
CRAIG

Greer surprises him with a vicious ELBOW to the face.

that you were right, it was all a
prank. Nothing to worry about.
MOONEY
Yeah, I know.
She pulls him back down for another kiss.
MARILYN
What am I gonna do with you?
MOONEY
You're gonna dance with me all
night long, until we're too pooped
to pop... Well almost.
A giggle.
They kiss.
MARILYN
You'll never change.

Yes I will, after I shower.
They both share a laugh.

Get out!
As Craig reaches blindly for a door handle, Ellis opens the
door and shoves him out onto the driveway. Greer yanks him
up by his collar.
GREER (CONT'D)
GET UP!

With guns at his back, Craig is dragged inside the house.

JESSICA (OS)
Craig?
Craig stops dead, hearing the voice. Scans the cobweb-filled
room, seeing nothing -- then from the depths of the shadows,
Jessica materializes looking haunted and lifeless as a ghost.
CRAIG
Jessica?
Jessica races for the safety of Craig's arms, but just as
she's about to be embraced, Greer steps forward and YANKS
Jessica back by her hair. She squeals in pain.
CRAIG (CONT'D)
HEY --/ /
Craig moves to object, but -- OOF! -- Deason sends him
gasping to the floor with a sledgehammer fist to the gut.
JESSICA
No, don't hurt him!
Jessica struggles and, with an annoyed shove, Greer sends her
spilling into Craig. She hugs tightly against him.
When Craig gets his wind back, he comes to his knees and
manages to croak out--
CRAIG
Ricky...?
Jessica nods gravely. He's here, too. Craig looks at his
wife's face, bruised and hurt, and tears rise in his eyes.
CRAIG (CONT'D)
Oh, God, Jess... What have they
done to you?
But Jessica won't let this moment be about pity.
JESSICA
Who are they, Craig?
Craig doesn't know what to say.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
Tell them, Craig. Tell them they
have the wrong family. Tell them
they've made a mistake--
But something in his eyes disagrees.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
What?!
What is it?

CRAIG
This isn't a mistake, Jess.
And that's all it takes for Jessica's world to shatter.
GREEK emerges from the shadows, startling them, and backhands
Craig's jaw with the butt of his gun.
GREEK
Where is the disc now?
Blood trickles from the corner of Craig's mouth.
CRAIG
You have to promise. If I give it
to you... you'll let my family go.
GREER
I'll tell you what, you tell me
where it is--
(turns his gun on Jessica)
--and I won't blow her brains all
over you right now.
Greer traces the barrel of the gun down Jessica's cheek.
Craig looks utterly helpless.

Greer lowers the gun to her neckline( pulls her shirt

When he gets near the door, Jessica is overcome with emotion
and races to her husband.
JESSICA
Wait!

She brushes past Hodges and hugs on tight to her husband,
tears flowing from her eyes.

Hodges goes to pull them apart, but Greer stops him.
He
knows this is going to be their last time together.
CRAIG
I love you.
Craig squeezes the good years of their marriage into a
strong, loving embrace. Jessica hugs him closer. Leans into
his ear to seemingly whisper her love in return -- but what
she actually whispers takes Craig by surprise.
JESSICA
(quickly; sotto voce)
Pretend I'm telling you that I love
you. There's an open phone line in
here. You'll have help at the
office, but if you give these men
what they want, we're dead.
Jessica kisses her husband on the lips and withdraws, leaving
Craig with an utterly confused expression on his face. But
before his look can betray him--
GREER
Let's go.

room. When the door locks behind them, Jessica once again

Wait, we --(bzzt!)--ve to think!
What --(bzzt!)--re we going to do?

Still wearing his holster, he shifts uncomfortably on the bed
as he watches the news.

Mooney jolts upright as they display A FUZZY PHOTO OF RYAN
from the Verizon surveillance cameras.
NEWS ANCHOR (CONT'D)

today's bizarre string of crimes,
most notably the theft of an $80,000
Cadillac at gunpoint.

spree", but gets the bigger picture, realizing that every
event --the Verizon store; searching for the Martin kid;

stealing the Cadillac -- centers around the cellphone call
Ryan tried to tell him about this morning.
Detective gears turning, Mooney reaches for the phone on the
bedside table. Dials 411.

Thank you for using Pacbell. This
is Claire, how may I help you?
MOONEY
I need the phone number for a
residence. Jessica Martin in
Brentwood.

That number is (310) 555-8364.
For

Mooney hangs up, dials the number. The phone rings and

Mooney listens intently -- and is troubled.
MOONEY

The woman at the house didn't have
an accent.
Marilyn smiles, realizing he's really talking to himself.
Mooney hangs up, thoughts racing. He reaches behind him, and
without looking he grabs his wallet and keys.
He then walks over to Marilyn and kisses the top of her head.
She knows him, and knows something's up.
MOONEY (CONT'D)
I'm sorry honey( but I have to
check on something real quick.

Dripping with sweat, Ryan shambles out of the stairwell, the
bike helmet now strapped to his head and the pouch over his
shoulder -- just as the ELEVATOR ARRIVES behind him!
As Greer, Hodges and Craig get out, Ryan turns and searches
for the mailroom that's supposed to be here! Where the hell
is-- Ah I He finds it and hustles into --
116

A wide COUNTER separates Ryan and a few BUSINESS MEN and
WOMEN from the MAIL CLERKS that busily work the other side.
Ryan leans against the wall, pretending to be an ordinary
bike messenger waiting for a package as Craig and the dirty
cops enter, brushing right past him.
Craig scans the faces of the other patrons as they enter,
desperately trying to figure out who is his secret ally. He
ignores Ryan completely, whose face is mostly hidden by the
tinted plastic VISOR attached to the helmet.
Craig notices an AGING SECURITY GUARD stationed in the area,
but knows better than to make any waves.
MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
(recognizing Craig)
Anything I can help you with Mr.
Martin?
CRAIG
Hey, Benny. This might sound
ridiculous, but I dropped a DVD
mailer into the chute this morning
and I forgot to put down an
address.
MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
Happens all the time. Let me see
what's back there. Gimme a sec'.
The Supervisor disappears into the back room.
Greer and Hodges take a seat only a few feet away from Ryan.
The moment is uncomfortable...and gets infinitely worse as--

MAIL CLERK ,
Excuse me, sir? Sir? Sir?
Ryan turns, realizing with horror that another MAIL CLERK is
speaking to him.
RYAN
Me?
MAIL CLERK
You waiting for a package?
Now everyone's looking at Ryan.
Including Greer.
RYAN

Sure, uh... I'm supposed to pick
something up for Mr. Fountain over
at the Bonaventure.
MAIL CLERK
From what department?
RYAN
I'm not sure... They said it was a
contract, though, I know that, so
what would that be, Legal?
MAIL CLERK
What's the tracking number?
RYAN
(patting himself down)
Uh... Right. Tracking number.
It's looking grim.
Thankfully, the Supervisor reappears.
MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
Mr. Martin? I found a number of
things that could be what you're
looking for. Mind coming back to
take a look?
Hodges shoots Craig a look, "go".
CRAIG
Sure.
The Supervisor leads Hodges and Craig away to the back room.
Unfortunately, Greer stays behind.
RYAN

I might... Maybe it's on the
clipboard on my bike?
Ryan watches Greer out of the corner of his eye as Hodges and
Craig disappear inside the vault.

HODGES cautiously watches Craig shuffle through the mailers,
opening two or three before finding -- he turns one upside
down -- and a DVD case slides out!
A quick glance at the label, "ADT Digital Surveillance'.
5/19/05 06:00 - 07:00" confirms it's the disc.

Hodges seems uncomfortable with the Supervisor hovering over

Ryan now sits by the window, cellphone pressed to his ear.
Feigning frustration.
RYAN
You believe this? Everyone's got
their head up their ass over there.
The Mail Clerk ignores him almost as much as Greer wants to.
Greer opens his cellphone to make a call, but when the signal
is no good, he wanders outside the mailroom toward the window
at the end of the hall.
MAIL CLERK
(impatiently)
Sir? You think you could just go
outside and get your clipboard?
Just then, Hodges and Craig come marching out of the vault.
MAIL CLERK (CONT'D)
Sir?
Ryan glances at Greer, momentarily distracted on the phone.
At Hodges, almost out of the bank. As he and Craig near the
door --

A moment where Craig finally locks eyes with Ryan -- and
suddenly realizes: This is the guy!
It's now or never.
Ryan has to do something.
MAIL CLERK (CONT'D)
Sir!?
RYAN

Screw the package.
Ryan stands and, unable to find anything better, snatches a
metal HAND TRUCK sitting by the door, and as Hodges walks by--
MAIL CLERK
WHAT ARE YOU DOING--?!
-- swings it full-force into Hodges' face -- WHAMM!!
Hodges
drops like a slaughterhouse cow.
Instantly, employees hit the ground; scream; run for their
lives. Craig dives for the DVD case. The Security Guard has
come to life; drawing down on them.
SECURITY GUARD
FREEZE!
Craig does.
But Ryan grabs him and moves, racing out of the
bank.

At the end of the hall, GREER sees Craig and Ryan running out
of the mailroom. Drops his phone, draws his gun --
SECURITY GUARD (OS)
FREEZE!!
-- just as the Guard comes running out. His gun was fixed on
Ryan, but now that he sees Greer with a piece, he trains his
gun on him instead.
SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
DROP YOUR WEAPON!
Ryan and Craig are struck in the middle of the crossfire.
GREER
(flashing his badge)
L.A.P.D.! I'M A COP!
SECURITY GUARD
DROP IT NOW!!
The instant Ryan and Craig try to escape into a nearby
stairwell -- Greer turns his gun on the SECURITY GUARD --
BANG! BANG!

-The Security Guard drops and Greer aims his weapon at Craig
again!
BANG! -- Greer fires.
Craig, SHOT IN THE BACK, slams against Ryan with the impact.
They fall half-in/half-out of the stairwell. Craig weakly
shoves the DVD into Ryan's hands.
CRAIG
..run...
But Ryan is overwhelmed.
His legs feel like a thousand
pounds of jelly.
CRAIG (CONT'D)

As Craig slumps to the ground, Ryan stares in shock -- but
when Greer starts sending a hail of bullets toward them, he
DIVES into:

He starts flying down the stairs...but when he sees four
BUILDING SECURITY GUARDS racing up from below--
RYAN
Damn!

Hodges gets to his feet. Stumbles out, holding his gushing,
broken nose. Yells at Greer, who's racing into the stairwell.
HODGES
The kid!!
GREER
No shit.
122

With the Guards and Greer only a floor behind, Ryan thinks
fast and CHUCKS HIS BIKE HELMET down the corridor, ELBOWS the
In-Case-Of-Emergency Glass, setting off the FIRE ALARM -- and
starts running UP.
Seconds later, when they reach that level, one of the Guards
sees Ryan's helmet and the broken glass leading away.
GUARD
(racing down the hall)
This way!
The other Guards follow...but Greer isn't convinced.
On a
hunch, he turns and continues running UP also.
Peeking over the edge from the floor above--

RYAN
Sees Greer and Hodges coming.
Big-ass guns out and ready.
Shit.'
THE ALARM BELLS SCREAM.
PEOPLE start filling the stairwell
on every floor.
Forcing his body to its very limits, Ryan bolts up the stairs
until he sees the ROOF EXIT on the next floor up. He shoves
open the nearest door and continues running up to the roof.
He slips out and silently closes the door behind him just as--
123

GREER and HODGES reach the floor beneath. See the door
swinging shut -- but neither fall for the bait. They runs up
toward the-

RYAN, wedging himself against the sides of the chute, tries
to be as still as possible. Every slight movement makes the
ALUMINUM BUCKLE AND GROAN.
From his shirt pocket, Jessica's tiny desperate voice pleads.
JESSICA (VO)
Ryan... ? Ryan, please answer me I
But Ryan just sits there.
Afraid to move.
Terrified to
discuss Craig.

Ryan holds his breath.
Trembling.
His leg threatening to
rabbit-foot again.
Straining to hear Greer, it's impossible not to hear:
JESSICA
You have to talk to me! Ryan,
please you have to talk to me--.'
The sweat from his hands causes the tiniest SLIP -- and as he
catches himself, there is a soft metallic BOOOONG from the
stressed metal.
Unable to ignore her pleas any longer, Ryan carefully pulls
the cellphone from his pocket and presses it to his ear.
Desperate to console her, Ryan --
BANG!! The TARPAPER ROLL flies down the chute. Ryan looks
up to see it angrily launching itself right at him!
He has to let go of the walls to avoid being hit.
He presses
himself to one side but --
WHAM!! The bloodthirsty roll bashes his wrist -- and he DROPS
SIMON COWELL'S CELLPHONE!
79.

Ryan reaches out, but the phone goes sliding down the chute!

Jessica hears a loud SCRAAAAPE, CRASH and a wash of STATIC.
JESSICA
Ryan?!
OH MY GOD, RYAN?!
RYAN--?!

The hulking Deason hears Jessica's PANICKED VOICE and stands
with a start. As he moves toward the attic, he notices a
small RED LIGHT FLASHING behind the bar. As he passes, he
checks it out and--
DEASON
WHAT THE--?!
WHIP PAN DOWN to what Deason sees: The red light is on one
of the house phones. The LINE-IN-USE INDICATOR.
And it's lit.
Shaking like a bear pissing pineapples, Deason rages away
toward the attic...
CUT TO:
131
131
Jessica is curling herself into a tiny sobbing ball on the
floor when -- WHAMM! -- the attic door crashes open. Jessica
jumps. Deason looms there. Sees the phone.
DEASON
YOU STUPID BITCH!
Jessica hurls the phone receiver away.
DEASON (CONT'D)
WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?! WHO HAVE YOU
TOLD?!
JESSICA
NO, DON 'T H URT M E--
Deason roars up and grabs Jessica's neck with one hand.
HURLS her across the attic and into the OLD MIRROR,
shattering it in a million pieces around her.
Desperate for anything, Jessica PALMS a TINY SHARD as she
struggles to her feet. A two-inch chip.
DEASON
YOU AND YOUR KID ARE DEAD!
She lowers her arm, defeated, out of breath...
You win.
80.
131
131
JESSICA
Don't hurt me, and I'll do
anything... Anything.. .
There is a promise in what Jessica offers that Deason
responds to. His fist FLASHES toward her throat, making her
flinch. But rather than hitting her, he wraps his meaty
fingers around her throat, almost daring her to stop him.
Jessica trembles, but that is all, and just as Deason begins
to enjoy his work, Jessica JABS at his face, but he predicted
as much and easily moves to deflect it -- SNICKK! -- she
flicks her wrist up and SLICES the underside of his upper
arm.
Deason flinches a little bit, like a bee sting, then laughs
as he notices the tiny SHARD in her hand--
DEASON
(sarcastic)
Oooh.
--but that's when he HEARS it. A DRIPPING SOUND. Deason
looks down at his arm and is confused to see his entire shirt
sleeve SOAKED IN BLOOD. It literally pours from his arm onto
the floor like a river.
Deason drains white; dizzy.
He looks at Jessica, confused.
JESSICA
Brachial artery. Pumps up to 30
liters of blood per minute...and
there's only five liters in the
human body.
Three seconds later, Deason crumbles...and Jessica leaves the
attic.
BACK TO:
132

RYAN'S still trapped. Sounds of approaching SIRENS in the
distance. Ryan listens for Greer; is he still there?
BANG!!
BANG!!
Two more heavy TARPAPER ROLLS come right at
him!
The first one he gets lucky with, but the second NAILS HIM
before bouncing furiously away and Ryan loses his grip
completely and slides out of control.
133
136
Jessica races across the dead brown lawn toward the guest
house/prison that holds her son. Getting her first good look
82.
136
136
at the secluded premises she's on confirms that screaming
would do no good. She's on her own.
When she reaches the guest house, she's shocked to find a
HUGE LOCK on the front door. Frantic, she makes her way
around the structure to a BIG BAY WINDOW. Though it's
protected by SECURITY BARS, she can see Ricky through the
glass.
Jessica pounds on the glass, and Ricky turns.
When her son
sees her, he races to the bars.
RICKY
Mom!
JESSICA
Baby!
Are you okay?!
RICKY
I can't get out!
Jessica looks around for something to bend the bars with.
There's nothing.
137
138
Mooney's cop senses scream as he walks inside. A POLICE
SCANNER chatters in the background. The place is a shambles.
Someone's been looking for something. He then sees-
BLOOD STREAKS the floor. It leads from over by the telephone
to underneath the pantry door.
MOONEY
(calling into house)
Hello? L.A.P.D. Anybody home?
No answer.
Drawing his gun, Mooney stalks carefully into--
139
139
A SMALL STAIRCASE leads up to the second floor. As Mooney
starts up the steps, BOOM UP to the top to REVEAL:
THE IMPOSTER JESSICA MARTIN (BAYBACK)
Hiding in ambush at the top of the stairs, gun in hand. She
listens to Mooney's footsteps and when she thinks he's neared
the top -- she springs out, blasting away down the staircase!
But Mooney's not there.
83.
139
139
MOONEY
Drop your gun, now.
I got you.
Now we see him. Still down in the entryway, behind some
cover, gun aimed and steady.
MOONEY (CONT'D)
I said drop it.'
Bayback relaxes -- then WHIRLS around, disappearing down the
hall! Mooney curses and quietly jogs up the stairs,
following her into--
140
140
A narrow hallway with multiple OPEN DOORWAYS on each side.
The Imposter Jessica could be hiding in any one of them...
Taking care not to give himself away, Mooney inches down the
hallway. And just when he's thinking that he may have
successfully created an element of surprise for himself--
SFX: SQUEEEEAK -- the floorboards of the old house groan
softly -- GIVING HIS POSITION AWAY!
Instantly Bayback swings out from a doorway right next to
Mooney, taps her gun to his chest pulls the tang--
But Mooney DIVES OUT OF THE WAY! BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!!
Two
miss, but the third shot NAILS HIS SHOULDER!
OOF! Mooney lands hard. Blood spreading out under his white
dress shirt. He cocks his head... listening for the sound of-
BAYBACK EJECTS A MAGAZINE and is about to reload--
Mooney JUMPS UP, RETURNS FIRE -- slamming Bayback against the
wall with two .38 caliber slugs. She collapses to the floor.
MOONEY
Damn it!
DAMN IT!!
Angry, the adrenaline drowning out the pain, Mooney turns to
the kidnapper laying in the hall, bleeding out. Kicks her
gun away and kneels.
But for the first time, Bayback isn't tough.
Just scared.
BAYBACK
..a-ambulance...
MOONEY
Tell me where Jessica Martin is or
you bleed to death right here.
BAYBACK
..p-please..call.. I.. I'm a--
Fuck this, Mooney kicks her ribs.
84.
140
140
MOONEY
WHERE IS SHE?!
Bayback struggles for air, reaching for him--
BAYBACK
...I'm a cop...
Bayback squeezes her eyes shut against a wave of pain -- and
DIES. Mooney stares at her. What did she say? Starts
patting her down.
And that's when he finds her BADGE.
L.A.P.D.
23rd Precinct.
She is a cop.
MOONEY
Oh shit...
Mooney grits his teeth against a fresh wave of pain and picks
up the phone, dials 911.
MOONEY (CONT'D)
Request emergency back up and medical
units! Officers down at-

Pulls into the driveway.
Greer and his team are going over surveillance photos taken
from the cameras at the Fegan Securities Building. The
hotos are useless, though, as Ryan's face is obscured by his
E helmet and visor.
GREER
These are the best pictures you
could get of him?!
ELLIS
He was wearing a visor.
Greer glares at him -- no shit -- and throws the pictures .
GREER
Useless!
The car parks and Greer storms out, followed by Ellis and
Hodges. They head for the house, and the moment they enter --
Jessica reappears. But now she's STARING at something.
The Escalade.
JESSICA
(to son; through window)
Baby, listen to me. I want you to
get away from this window. I want
you to go to the other side of the
room as far away from the door as
you can --
RICKY
No, don't leave me!
Don't leave
me!!
The terror in his voice breaks Jessica's heart.
JESSICA
Honey, I'm getting you out of
there!
RICKY
Where are you going?!
JESSICA
I'm only gonna be gone a second,
and then we're gonna go home, but
you have to do this first. It's
gonna be loud, but don't be scared,
okay? Now go find somewhere safe
like I told you.

Ricky n9ds and runs off into another room of the house.
And
as Jessica rushes for the Escalade --
CUT TO:

nearing the attic that Jessica's supposed to still be in...

As Greer reaches the first landing, the HOUSE PHONE starts
RINGING. Ignoring it, Greer continues on and is about to turn
the corner to the attic when --
HODGES (OS)
Boss, you better take this.
Greer stops, a footstep away from seeing the open attic door.
From the bottom of the steps, Hodges tosses him a CORDLESS
PHONE. Greer puts it to his ear.
GREER
What?
MATCH CUT TO:
.57
158
To our surprise, Ryan isn't talking to Greer...but to the
same TELEMARKETER that called him earlier.
TELEMARKETER
Look, sir, we can take your name
off our list if you want, but you
don't have to get nasty--
RYAN (VO)
What--?
Who is this?
TELEMARKETER
Mark.
At Mastercharge Credit Union-

RYAN (VO)

A frickin' telemarketer? But I

Ryan suddenly puts it together.
RYAN (VO) (CONT'D)
You bastard.
The Telemarketer quickly hangs up before it gets ugly.
CUT BACK TO:

Greer listens intently to a call.
So who is on his end of
the phone? Tomlin.
TOMLIN (VO)
Look, Captain, we've got to do
everything we can to protect this
guy. I mean, shit, with all his
years in he's owed a little.

INTERCUT CALL - GREER JUST OUTSIDE ATTIC/

TOMLIN STANDING NEXT TO MOONEY OUTSIDE JESSICA'S HOUSE
GREER VO
He's with you? How'd he find out?
TOMLIN
Said something about a kid who came
into the station earlier--
Greer grimaces, putting it together.
GREER
Early twenties? Stumbled out of
Brian Wilson's hamper?
TOMLIN
Yeah.
Something like that.
GREER
Tomlin. Take care of him.
No
witnesses.
That's more than Tomlin bargained for.
TOMLIN
Are you sure that's necessary, sir?
GREER
You know once the shitstorm starts,
there's nothing I can do to save
you.
TOMLIN
Sure. That's what I thought.
I'll
tell him.

Tomlin hangs up with a calm FLICK.
The Paramedic finishes up
Mooney's bandage.
PARAMEDIC #1
Keep pressure on it until you get
it stitched.
MOONEY
What's the word?
TOMLIN
Not g9od. I.A.'s not throwing out
any lifelines with all that's going
on.. .
(re: Mooney's sh9ulder)
Come on. You can write a statement
while I take you to the hospital.
CUT TO:
161
Greer slips the cordless into his jacket pocket, continuing
up the stairs. Hodges follows, staring expectantly.
HODGES
Well?
What'd he say?
GREER
You know a desk jockey named
Mooney?
HODGES
-- HOLY SHIT!
Greer sees Hodges gaping up the stairwell. Following his
look, Greer turns...and sees the attic door WIDE OPEN!
Further in, he can make out Deason's bloody body and the
rigged-together phone...
In fact, the only thing Greer doesn't see is Jessica.
GREER
NO!
Greer turns and pounds down the stairs.
BACK TO:
162
163
Jessica throws the big car in reverse and tries to back out --
but the Escalade's stuck! Caught by the debris, the wheels
just spin.
JESSICA
Come on!
COME ON!!
Jessica rocks the car forward, and back. Forward, and back.
And just as it finally comes loose -- KRRRAAASHHH!!
The window next to Jessica's head EXPLODES in a shower of
tempered glass, shocking us. Two arms snake in and wrap
around Jessica's neck. Greer.
But Jessica STOMPS ON THE GAS, hoping the big car will pull
her free.
It doesn't. As the Escalade surges away across the lawn,
Greer's vice-like grip holds, PULLING JESSICA OUT the broken
window and -- THUMP! -- to the guest house debris below.
As Jessica watches in horror:
THE DRIVERLESS ESCALADE
Careens down the driveway and crashes into a pillar.
Hodges
races over and yanks Ricky out.
GREER
Balls his fist in Jessica's hair and yanks her around hard.
GREER
WHO DID YOU TELL?!

JESSICA
Nobody!
GREEK
LYING BITCH! ! WHO WAS THAT KID IN
THE MAIL ROOM?!
Jessica screams as he yanks her to her knees.
RICKY
Stop it!
Don't hurt her!!
Seething mad, Greer rips his gun from its holster and is
literally about to blow Jessica's brains out when--
SFX:
THE CORDLESS PHONE IN GREER'S POCKET STARTS RINGING!
The entire world stops. There's an awkward moment: Jessica
cowering, Greer recovering, the phone just ringing and
ringing... The telephone is the only sound in the world,
getting louder and louder with each ring until--
Greer answers it.
GREER
Bad timing, Tomlin.
But it isn't Tomlin on the phone this time.
It's--
RYAN (VO)
Feel like a trade?
INTERCUT PHONE CALL:

HODGES is about to let Jessica out of the van, when he hears--
GREER (OVER WALKIE)
Hodges, do not let them go! Do you
hear me? Do not let them go!
BACK TO:

The place is dark. Empty. An array of rowing shells covered
in ghostly, flapping tarps make the place look vaguely haunted.
This place is also filled with storage equipment, such as
buoys and safety netting used by the beach patrol.
CUT TO:
191
192
RYAN - sees Tomlin coming.
Ryan's trapped like a rat -- and
dripping blood everywhere.
He looks for anything that'll save him, but finds only
useless boating tools (sanders, saws, box cutters, etc.)
RYAN
(to himself)
Think! Think!
193
194
TOMLIN - By the time his eyes adjust to the dark, Ryan is
nowhere to be seen. TARPS undulate over jumbles of boxes and
equipment everywhere -- a hundred places to hide.
Alone, Tomlin stalks among the equipment.
Gun out.
Hunting
Ryan like a snake on the scent or prey.
TOMLIN
You're wounded kid, just give me
what I came for, and I'll let you
all go.
Police sirens in the distance grow louder.
Tomlin's offer goes unanswered.
That's when he notices the
BLOOD on the ground. Tomlin smiles, following Ryan's trail
to a PILE OF BLOOD-SMEARED TARPS -- where the trail ends!
It's obvious Ryan used these to staunch his wound. Shit!
He's gonna have to search this whole place--
Then, suddenly, Tomlin gets an idea. He pulls out his phone,
making sure it's concealed from view, and writes a TEXT
MESSAGE to--
x95
196
Tomlin's ready to pounce.
SFX:
Nearby, Ryan's cellphone starts to RING, betraying him!
Instantly, Tomlin hones in on the noise -- coming from under
a bulky tarp along the far wall -- and EMPTIES HIS GUN at it!
The tarp shreds. Nothing could survive the assault.
Tomlin walks calmly across the room to stand before the tarp.
TOMLIN
Shoulda stayed at home this
morning, kid.
And just then, Tomlin throws off the shredded tarp exposing--
Ryan's cellphone.
And nothing else.

RYAN (OS)
Funny. I was about to say the same
to you.
TOMLIN
What the--
And in the instant Tomlin realizes he's been tricked, he
turns and--
WHAM!
RYAN HITS TOMLIN in the face with a 2x4, SMASHING his TEETH
and sending him backwards. Before Tomlin has time to
rec9ver, Ryan swings again. CRACK! -- And his KNEE CAP is
obliterated. Ryan, looking like a psychotic Babe Ruth, gives
Tomlin two more vicious WHACKS before grabbing his cellphone
and high-tailing it out of there.

HODGES - has no luck on the walkie.
HODGES

Jessica, cuffed from behind, covertly wriggles the handcuffs
under her ass toward her feet. Ricky, terrified, screams
"no" with his eyes. But she knows she's out of time.

No! We don't have the DVD. Just
hold his location. Hodges, parking
lot now!
Just as Hodges reaches for the door handle -- Jessica wraps
her cuffs around his throat, throws her legs against the back
of his seat and pulls like her life depended on it.
Hodges chokes, flails, digs, and claws at the cuffs, but his
fingertips are no match for Jessica's muscular legs.
JESSICA
Ricky run!
Find help!
Ricky's paralyzed with fear.
JESSICA (CONT'D)
RUN!
Ricky bolts from the car.
CUT TO:

JESSICA - finishes squeezing the last bit of life out of
Hodges.
She finally exits the van, but not before grabbing the WALKIE
TALKIE and GUN.

The ECU OF A TELEVISION SCREEN
showing an aerial shot of the Santa Monica Pier.
PULL OUT to reveal-
CHLOE AND RYAN, sitting in a hospital dayroom, engrossed in
the NEWS REPORT that plays in the far corner of the room.
Ryan's shoulder has now been BANDAGED, his arm's in a sling.
NEWS ANCHOR
...The Santa Monica Pier was the
latest setting in the ongoing 23rd
Precinct corruption scandal. Ryan
Ackerman, a local resident, risked
his life to save a family kidnapped

It hurts... But you're making it
way better. I'm just glad it's
over.
CHLOE
(smiling)
Modesty can be sexy.
RYAN
And to think this was our first
date.
CHLOE
Next time, skip the shower.
In the background, Jessica and Ricky exit a hospital room and
join the two lovebirds.
JESSICA
Craig's very weak, but the doctors
say it looks promising. He's
probably going to have to walk with
a cane, but that's the worst of
it... I'm just thankful.
Chloe senses that Jessica and Ryan might need a moment alone.
CHLOE
Come on Ricky, let's get a hot
chocolate.
A small smile forms on Ricky's exhausted face. Chloe leads
Ricky down the hall.
JESSICA
I can't believe I almost lost
everything that means... I don't
know how I can ever thank you.
RYAN
I do.
(weak smile)
Don't ever call me again.
A shared laugh, then as they turn to the television--
ECU OF SECURITY FOOTAGE OF THE PARKING LOT MURDER
A CELL PHONE RINGS on a nearby table. They turn to look at
it, neither one apparently having any idea to whom it might
belong...
But this time, as we PULL BACK on the scene, we realize no
one's going to answer it.
