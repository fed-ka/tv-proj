      Becca and Lolly stand on the sidewalk in the cold. Lolly 
      leans over a trash can, stock still. Becca holds her hair, 
      waiting for the inevitable.

                                  LOLLY
                    Nope. False alarm. Think I m good.                                                                                    2.


                                  BECCA
                    You sure?

                                  LOLLY
                    Totally. Lezzgo back in. Thizzthe 
                    most fun I ve had since last night.

    She stands up, shakes it off. Becca waits a cautious beat, 
    and then heads for the door. Lolly wheels around and pukes 
      into the trash can. Becca dashes back to grab her hair.


    The last few guests depart as Becca waves good-bye. Andy 
      joins her. She throws her arms around him.

                                  BECCA
                    Are you really serious about 
                    spending the night apart?

                                  ANDY
                    It s tradition. I know it s stupid. 
                    But... it s my first wedding. I 
                    want it to be special. 

      After a beat, they both have to laugh.

                                  BECCA
                    Well, I ll see you tomorrow then. 
                    I ll be the one in white. 
                          (correcting herself)
                    Ivory.

                                  ANDY
                    Isn t that white?

                                  BECCA
                          (reassuringly)
                    You ll think it s white.

    He kisses her and hails her a cab. She rolls down the window 
    and leans out for another kiss.

                                  ANDY
                    Love you.                                                                                    10.


                                  BECCA
                    Love you too. 

                                  ANDY
                    Text me if you need to.

                                  BECCA
                    Sure. Because we re twelve. 

    He kisses her again and pats the top of the car.


    To establish: A typical Upper West Side co-op. Green awning, 
      timeworn marble steps. Elegant, but nothing too fancy. This 
    is where Becca grew up. 


      Becca and Lolly. Bundled up. Rosy cheeks. Lolly looks 
      preoccupied.

                                  LOLLY
                    Becca... there s something I have 
                    to tell you.                                                                                    15.


                                  VOICES (O.S.)
                    Seven, six, five...


      Becca s taxi rolls up to a warehouse studio in the heart of 
    the as-yet-undeveloped meat-packing district. From inside the 
      cab, she sees him sitting on the industrial metal steps, 
      wearing his paint-spattered jeans, worn out work boots, and a 
      well-loved, threadbare flannel shirt. 

      Becca gets out of the cab. It pulls away, leaving her staring 
    at SEAN, whom we recognize from the photos. He s in paint-
      spattered jeans and a t-shirt, shooting the breeze with some 
      rough-looking Con-Ed guys. 

    He glances over, doesn t immediately notice her, but then 
      does a double-take as she catches his eye. He walks over to 
      her, looking not unhappy but a little puzzled...                                                                                    26.


                                  SEAN
                    I thought we weren t seeing each 
                    other today.

                                  BECCA
                    I changed my mind. I had to see 
                    you.

      After a beat: he grins. And just like that, it s like the 
      first time they met  - that smile, that stomach flip -

                                  SEAN
                    Wanna come up?

    The bright sunlight. Anonymous strangers who barely take 
      notice of a runaway bride. An ordinary day that just became 
      extraordinary. 

                                  LOLLY
                    Oh my God. What just happened?                                                                                    49.


                                  BECCA
                    I don t know.

                                  LOLLY
                    What do we do now?

                                  BECCA
                          (borderline screaming)
                    I don t know!

                                  LOLLY
                    Is that joy or hysteria?

                                  BECCA
                    I don t know!

      A beat... and then Lolly throws her arms around Becca and 
      hugs her for dear life. They rock back and forth for a moment 
      until Lolly pulls out of the hug and takes Becca s face in 
    her hands. 

                                  LOLLY
                    We have to do something. Something 
                    big. Something symbolic. What do 
                    you want to do?

      Becca thinks of everything that has slipped away from her. 
    The missed opportunities. The wistful longing for everything 
      that she thought was gone forever. The mistakes she can 
      correct. The new things she can screw up.

                                  BECCA
                    I want to start my life over. I 
                    want to take the other path. I want 
                    to choose Door B instead of Door A. 
                    I want to do everything different. 
                    Starting with you and me.
                          (realizing)
                    But first... I want to smoke in a 
                    bar.
