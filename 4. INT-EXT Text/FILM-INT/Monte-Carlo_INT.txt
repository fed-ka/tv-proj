ALICE PERRY (30s), her innate and amiable authority eclipsed
only by a self-consciousness about her hair, afraid perhaps
that she hasn't lived up to the promise of its red color,
chalks "Futur Anterieur" in precise cursive at the board.
ALICE
"By tomorrow, we will have flown to
France."
She turns to face her TENTH GRADE FRENCH CLASS.
Though Alice's make up, earrings and practical flats are
simple, there is an inherent elegance to their combination
that hints at a more complex, if uncharted, interior.
ALICE (CONT'D)
Who can give me an example? Paul?
NOTE: Throughout, all blocks of italicized dialogue should be
read as in FRENCH with ENGLISH subtitles.
PAUL
"I will have completed the assigned
translation by the end of

ALICE
C'est bon! Amber?
AMBER
I will have failed French again by
the end of the year.
Alice pauses, regarding Amber with a pained sympathy.
ALICE
En francais si'l vows plait?

EMMA LINDGARD (late 20's) rapidly scribbles a complex

skirt and heels. She turns suddenly, smiling brightly.
EMMA (CONT'D)
Okay! Kyle?
KYLE snaps his eyes up to Emma's face, tries to cover.
KYLE
Um... I guess I'm a little lost.
If optimists see a glass as half full, Emma's is in a
constant state of cheerful, blonde overflow, even when a
level of wilfulness is required.

DAVID gazes back dumbly, stuck in an erotic fog.

TWO GIRLS ( 17) laugh conspiratorially, dredging woven pot
holders through an egg mixture and dropping them into a
sputtering pan, as the rest of the CLASS makes French toast.
The girls sneak looks at MEG KELLY (30's) who tears recipes
from a Gourmet magazine at her desk at the front of the room.
Dark hair pulled into a pony tail, face unadorned by makeup,
Meg's natural sexiness is muted by an air of indifference.
She glances up when the pan erupts in flames and the girls
leap back with a shriek, shakes her head.
The girls attempt to knock the pan from the burner with the
handle of a broom when a pot lid bangs down, instantly
snuffing the flames.
They shrink back as Meg waves the lid, clearing the smoke.
MEG
Do me a favor, and let's just try
to get to vacation.

FINN
She wants to see Paris, too!
MEG
Finn, if Edith goes to Paris with
me, she can't go to Daddy's with
you.
Finn's brows come together as she considers this, then
reaches for the dog.
MEG (CONT'D)
That's what I thought.

SEAMUS, Meg's ten year old son, pounds down the stairs

Hello. You've reached the home of

In Europe. But, please, do leave a

Princess'...
Emma turns at the counter to see Princes Diana touring an
African encampment with children on the television.
EMMA
Ooh!
She hangs up the phone and sits herself down at the coffee
table where a game of solitaire is laid next to a microwaved
Lean Cuisine dinner.
She turns up the volume with the remote and gathers the
cards, shuffling.
Eyes glued to Princess Diana on television, Emma suddenly
shoots her hands three feet wide, rifling the cards in
perfect vertical formation like a seasoned cardsharp.
Alice zips the suitcase shut and raises her arms in victory

There's no way I'm going to be able

RICHARD
Good for me.
They kiss.
ALICE
I mean, how long have I been
talking about this?
RICHARD
Mmm... You were reading Colette.
In the teacher's lounge. First
time we met. Long time.
Alice pauses as this lands somewhere deep inside.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
This is just the beginning.
ALICE

It feels like it.
They clink glasses and Richard watches Alice tip her glass
back then stop mid-sip to peer down at the delicate diamond
ring sitting at the bottom of her glass.
ALICE (CONT'D)

Wait. You're serious. Are you

Let's do this when I get back. In

RICHARD
Can you hear yourself?
ALICE
Honey, listen, it's just the
timing. I wasn't planning on this
TONIGHT--
RICHARD
Whoa. I planned tonight. Tonight
was my plan--
ALICE
And it's great. This is great.
You're great. But, Richard, I feel
like I just need to do this one
thing first. Then I can do the
next. Then I can do this.
(off his silence)
Can you understand? There's a
world I haven't even seen yet...
Alice, hopeful, searches Richard's inscrutable expression a

open suitcase, wincing.

I'm sorry...
PILOT (PRE-LAP)
Ladies and Gentleman, we are about
to begin our descent into Charles
de Gaulle International Airport...
Meg sleeps in an aisle seat of the dim coach cabin where all
the window shades have been drawn down, Emma dozing beside
her, a game of cards laid out on her tray table.
Alice brings her seat to the upright position as instructed
and sits, hyper-alert, looking at her closed window shade.
A beat.
She reaches out and raises the shade a tentative crack,
flooding their row with light.
She glances furtively around the cabin, then inches the shade
higher, drawing in a sharp breath at what she sees.
She flings the shade up.
ALL OF PARIS is laid out below her; a magical nautilus-like
wheel with the Eiffel Tower as its central axle.
Her breath steams the window as she drinks it all in.
She turns, eyes full, to Meg who cranes across Emma to share
in the view and squeeze Alice's arm with a smile.
EMMA

ALICE
This is ridiculous...
EMMA
Hey, Alice! Meg!
Alice and Meg turn to Emma across the aisle, who hooks a
thumb at CARL and DEEDEE (late 60's, both stout) beside her.
EMMA (CONT'D)
Can you believe? They're from St.
Paul! On their honeymoon!

Alice, Meg and Emma race past gallery after gallery, trying
to keep Madame Valery's little blue flag in sight as it flies
over the crowd in the distance.
Alice whipsaws her head at everything they're missing, making
notes in her guidebook on the fly.
ALICE
Try to remember that! We'll double
back for the Chagalls!
Madame Valery leads the charge up the right wing of the Daru
staircase, past the statue of Winged Victory.
Alice stops Meg and Emma in front of the statue, while Carl
and Deedee try to catch their breath on the landing.

Alice turns Meg and Emma around to come back down.
DEEDEE

EMMA
Alice, I'll e-mail it to you.
Meg looks up, catching Alice eyeing their surroundings.
MEG
(re: Mona Lisa)
At least she's smiling.
ALICE
(snaps to, smiling)
What? No. I'm--. I'm just a
little tired.
EMMA

Hey! I'll bet you have jet lag!
We'll probably all get it!
Meg raises a glass of wine.
MEG
To jet lag.
Emma and Alice raise their glasses to toast as WAITERS plunk
down identical plates of steak frites before them.
MEG (CONT'D)
To Alice. Best organizer. Best
guide. Best friend.
EMMA

napkin, and waiters sweep their plates away, replacing them
with creme brulees.
ALICE
Oh! No. Wait. Pardon, Monsieur--
CARL
(RECEIVING CATSUP)
Merci!
He turns now, catsup in hand, to blink at the creme brulee
that has replaced his own and Deedee's steaks.
Alice places a hand on Madam Valery's arm as she passes.
ALICE
Pardon, Madame, but...
Madam Valery slowly raises her eyes from Alice's hand.

The women lower the travel brochure and its photograph of a
tidy well-appointed suite, to regard the actual one in which

twin beds and a military-style cot.
EMMA

Holy--! Alice, help--
Alice climbs onto one of the beds to help Meg lift.
ALICE
Emma, what have you got in here?
EMMA
Just the stuff you put on my list--
(off her look)
And a couple options.
The bag slips from Meg's grasp, crashing onto the foot of the
bed which collapses, catapulting Alice onto the cot which
flips up over her, knocking Emma into the tiny bathroom.
EMMA (CONT'D)
Hey! Come on, guys!
Alice gazes out a window that opens onto a narrow alley and
the ugly backsides of buildings, as Meg and Emma sleep
fitfully behind her.
She looks down at the cellphone in her hands, scrolling
through her speed dial to stop at: 1. Richard.
She hesitates with her thumb over the "call" button.
She turns back to the miserable view, considering for a beat,

grabbing a towel to swipe at her wet hair.

A toilet flushes and Cordelia opens her stall door, heads for
the counter, oblivious to Alice and Meg who freeze with their
towels, blinking at her uncanny resemblance to Emma.
CORDELIA (CONT'D)
Do you know if there's an evening
flight--?
Alice and Meg turn to each other, then to Cordelia's
reflection in the glass, their mouths hanging open.
CORDELIA (CONT'D)
Ooh, I think I can just make it.

not staying in it?
An ANXIOUS WAITER races in, refilling Alice's glass.

understand if you feel we shouldn't
go.
The women swivel around in their plush seats at the POP! of a
cork as a STEWARD opens a bottle of Champagne.
ALICE
Okay. We go. We take a look
around. We get on a train and come
right back...

MEG
Anything goes wrong, we say it was
a language thing, that we didn't
UNDERSTAND--
EMMA
Now, I like that idea, because it's
true!
They fall silent as the steward appears with glasses of
Champagne, wait for him to retreat.
ALICE
Go, look, come right back. It's a
good plan.
Alice, Meg and Emma clink glasses.
MONTAGE:
Their escort opens a door ahead of them to a roof deck, wind
spilling in to the stairway they climb.
Alice, Meg and Emma delight as the helicopter banks along the
coast, the Mediterranean glittering in blue and green below.
A craggy ridge falls away and all of MONTE CARLO unfolds in
step upon step of coral rooftops, cream and gold.
END MONTAGE.
Within a glossy brochure: A collage of "snapshots" shows
happy African children grouped outside their new school;
raising their hands at their desks in a pristine classroom;
finding their country on a glossy globe.
ALICE
(ANGUISHED)
Oh, would you look at these kids?
MEG
No, I can't. I can't stand it.
Emma reads to Alice and Meg from the brochure in the seating
area of their luxurious suite, enjoying none of it, nor the
incredible balcony view of Monte Carlo's marina and bay.
EMMA
"With your help The Michand
Foundation is able to sow the seeds
of education, transforming lives,
families, and villages, one child
at a time..." She didn't say
anything about a school!
MEG
Schools, with an "s." More than
one.

ALICE
(MISERABLE)
In Africa.
MEG
That horrible, irresponsible girl!
I've never stolen a thing in my
life, now I've taken a trip from
school children.
ALICE
In Africa.
Meg hangs her head.
EMMA
Reykjavik! That takes some nerve!
They're counting on her for a
charity auction and she doesn't
even show up!
ALICE
Only she did.
Emma reaches for a gigantic wrapped fruit basket.
EMMA
She did?
MEG
Do not touch that!
ALICE
You, Emma. If you're Cordelia.
They've seen you. You're here.
EMMA
Well, I can't go to that thing
tonight.
(A BEAT)
I don't have anything to wear.
The phone RINGS! and Emma snatches it up before Alice can.
EMMA (CONT'D)
(PERFECT BRITISH)
Hello?
Alice gestures for Emma not to say anything, to hang up.
(CONTINUED)
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 41.

EMMA (CONT'D)
(INTO PHONE)
Oh yes, please. Send it up... Um.
Yes, all of it. Everything. Thank
you, ever so. Merci!
She hangs up and holds a beat before turning to Alice.
EMMA (CONT'D)
My luggage is here.
Alice and Meg stand in front of the tower of Louis Vuitton
trunks and cases while Emma idly thumbs the combination lock
of a steel briefcase in her lap.
ALICE
Okay. But, just for tonight. And,
that's it.
CLICK! Alice and Meg look to Emma, holding the now open
briefcase, eyes wide.
EMMA
Lucky guess?
0
A necklace of diamonds and enormous yellow stones sparkles
like a constellation from within the case's velvet lining.
ALICE
(CLOSING IT)
No jewelry.
Emma nods.
ALICE (CONT'D)
Then it.all goes back.
MEG
Dry-cleaned.
The gaming hall's towering ornate doors are opened by TWO
DOORMEN for Alice, Emma and Meg to make their big entrance in
Cordelia's couture chiffon, silk and organza.
Heads held high, backs straight, they strike a remarkable
tableaux as they pause in unison at the top of the room's
raised landing to survey the swirl of roulette wheels and the
tony European jet set.
(CONTINUED)
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 42.
CONTINUED:
At first glance they look spectacular, but under closer
scrutiny one can read Meg's composed discomfort in wearing a
dress that is too tight, nearly spilling her breasts, and the
self-consciousness Alice endures in a dress made daringly
short by her height.
But, this is because we know them; to all other eyes they not
only belong here, they own the room.
They glance at one another, eyebrows up: "We're here!"
EMMA
Don't you feel like we've won
something already?
Jean-Pierre comes to greet them with PRINCE DOMENICO DA
SILVANO (30's, movie-star handsome), both in tuxedos,
offering a hand to escort Emma down the few steps.
JEAN-PIERRE
Mademoiselle Scott, you made it!
Emma withholds her natural smile, placing just the tips of
her fingers in Jean-Pierre's palm with exaggerated hauteur.
EMMA
Enchante.
Jean-Pierre assists Meg and Alice, Meg clutching the top of
her dress, Alice anxiously keeping the skirt of hers in place
with a hand as she steps down.
JEAN-PIERRE
And Mademoiselle Margaret Kelly and
Mademoiselle Alice Perry--
(FOR ALICE)
I am very glad you were able to
come this evening.
Alice nods, blushes and tries to cover.
JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D)
May I present His Highness, Prince
Domenico Da Silvano?
Prince Da Silvano bows from the waist.
DOMENICO
MADEMOISELLE SCOTT--
EMMA
Please, call me "Cordelia."
(CONTINUED)
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 43.

DOMENICO
If you will call me "Domenico."
EMMA
I shall certainly try.
Domenico escorts Emma out onto the casino floor as Jean-
Pierre touches Alice's elbow.
JEAN-PIERRE
Shall we?
Alice and Meg allow Jean-Pierre to lead them, following Emma
as GAMBLERS break from their games to track these three
elegant women gliding smoothly through the room.
MEG
(aside to Alice)
I may as well be topless.
ALICE
Please. I'm mooning everyone
behind us.
A DEALER unseals a new deck of cards as Domenico pulls out a
chair for Emma at the room's enormous game table.
EMMA
Oh, but, I really wasn't planning
on playing this evening. I so much
prefer to watch--
Emma looks to Alice and Meg for help as Jean-Pierre leads
them to the far side of a low railing to view the game.
DOMENICO
(A WINK)
This I do not believe about you.
He turns to the eight other PLAYERS (of various ages and
genders, but all rich) clustered at the room's small bar.
DOMENICO (CONT'D)
Ladies and gentlemen? Shall we
begin?
The other players make obligatory introductions and take up
positions at the table as Jean-Pierre offers Alice and Meg
tall upholstered stools to sit.
(CONTINUED)
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 44.
CONTINUED:
Alice moves to sit, but then remembers her skirt, looks to
Meg who is unable to even raise a leg in her tight dress.
ALICE
(TO JEAN-PIERRE)
Easier to see if we stand.
Jean-Pierre hands them both a glass of Champagne.
ALICE (CONT'D)
And why aren't you playing?
JEAN-PIERRE
Ah. I play behind the scenes.
Like Robin Hood, I take from those
who have more than enough, for
those who have nothing but need.
(LAUGHS)
Also, I do not play because I have
no money of my own.
Alice smiles, charmed by his candor, but then stops.
ALICE
They're playing for money?
(turns to Meg, flat)
IS
They're playing for money.
Together they turn to see Emma happily arranging the cards
she is dealt in her hands.
DOMENICO
Cordelia, why don't you do us the
honor of setting this evening's
stakes?
Emma glances over to Alice and Meg who look back at her,
ashen, and turns to the players who smile expectantly.
EMMA
Oh. Um. Okay...
She takes her handbag into her lap, opens it, looks.
EMMA (CONT'D)
(A GUESS)
Alright. Why don't... Why don't
we start at ten?
A shocked player sputters into his drink.
Emma places a twenty Euro note on the table.
(CONTINUED)
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 45.
CONTINUED: (2)
EMMA (CONT'D)
That is if anyone is able to make
change.
A beat.
Jean-Pierre, Domenico and all the other players burst out
laughing and Emma smiles, laughing too, but shoots a
desperate look to Alice and Meg.
DOMENICO
Marvelous!
He signals an ATTENDANT over as Emma's shoulders relax.
DOMENICO (CONT'D)
Please bring Mademoiselle Scott a
rack of chips.
(TO EMMA)
Two hundred?
EMMA
(BIG GULP)
Um. Sure.
JEAN-PIERRE
You would not know it, but she is
very funny.
MEG
A riot.
Domenico casts a glossy chip into the pot.
DOMENICO
Mademoiselle Scott starts us at ten
thousand a hand.
Alice and Meg freeze, their champagne glasses sliding from
their hands, while Emma's eyes grow as large as all the
zeroes on Domenico's chip.
DOMENICO (CONT'D)
You must be feeling very lucky.
DEALER
Mademoiselle Scott? It is your
call.
(CONTINUED)
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 46.
CONTINUED:
Emma sits locked in a cool stare-down over the top of her
cards with Domenico across from her at the tensed table.
Meg downs a glass of Champagne in one gulp, snagging the back
of the WAITER's jacket, hauling him back for a refill.
The waiter turns to Alice, who pats at her face with a damp
napkin, struggling to breathe.
MEG
(takes bottle from waiter)
I should probably keep this.
DEALER
(PRODDING)
Mademoiselle?
Emma places her cards face down before her, appears to fold.
EMMA
Well...
She moves her hands to the stacks and stacks of chips beside
her, and pushes them to the center of the table.
EMMA (CONT'D)
0
I'm all in.
The other players gasp and Alice fails to suppress a whimper
as she grasps Meg's pouring hand, spilling Champagne, drawing
Jean-Pierre's attention.
JEAN-PIERRE
Are you alright?
ALICE
Great. I'm just--. Excuse me.
Alice slips around the railing and heads for Emma as two
players fold in near tears, leaving just Emma, Domenico and a
DOWAGER (60's) in the game.
ALICE (CONT'D)
I'm terribly sorry to interrupt.
But, Cordelia, you look a little
overheated... Why don't we--?
(WHISPERS LOW)
.Have you completely lost your mind?

Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 47.

EMMA
(WHISPER BACK)
Hey. Don't distract me. I'm in
the middle of a hand--
ALICE
Emma! That isn't Monopoly money!
EMMA
Relax. I've got it under control--
ALICE
And this isn't the mathletes finals
in Kenosha!
EMMA
Jean-Pierre, would you be a dear
and get Alice some water?
(TO ALICE)
You're the one that got us into
this--!
ALICE
What?!
DOMENICO
I will see you, Cordelia.
Domenico pushes his own mountain of chips to the pot in the
center of the table and Alice buries her face in her hands
when the dowager folds her cards.
EMMA
(whisper to Alice)
Now, go sit down and try to be
cool, would you? Jeeze! Let me
handle this.
Alice moves back to her stool, tries to smile as she takes
the water Jean-Pierre offers.
MEG
What'd she say? What'd she say?
ALICE
(SICK)
We're going down, Meg. Going down
hard.
DEALER
Mademoiselle. Your Highness. Your
0 cards, please.

Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 48.

Alice and Meg turn helplessly to the game table.
DOMENICO
Ladies first.
EMMA
After you. Please.
Domenico can hardly contain his gloating as he reveals his
three aces.
DOMENICO
I am very sorry, Cordelia.
A beat, then Emma shrugs.
EMMA
Well. It is just a game after all.
She turns her cards over and fans them on the table felt: A
royal flush in the suit of hearts, ace high.
EMMA (CONT'D)
I do hope there are no hard
feelings.
The other players cheer as Domenico's smile crashes.
Emma shrieks with delight, turning to Alice and Meg who grab
each other, barely keeping themselves from pitching over,
glasses spilling, as the other players applaud.
Emma rakes in the Everest of multi-colored chips with both
arms, laughing as she's congratulated.
DOWAGER
You must play often, Miss Scott.
EMMA
Oh, a little, online. But, this is
so much more fun!
Domenico and Jean-Pierre, each toting buckets of chips,
escort Alice, Emma and Meg to the elevator, all giddy.
DOMENICO
Not even a last drink in the bar?
(CONTINUED)
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 49.
CONTINUED:
EMMA
It's been such a splendid evening,
I am reluctant to press my luck any
further.
MEG
Yeah. Good call, Cordelia.
DING! The elevator arrives and the doors open as Domenico
leans in towards Emma.
DOMENICO
Then you must promise to dance with
me at my party tomorrow.
Emma evades Domenico by stepping onto the elevator.
EMMA
Oh, Delmonico--
DOMENICO
"Domenico."
EMMA
I would not miss it for the world.
Meg collects the buckets from Domenico and steps on.
MEG
Great meeting you, your Highness.
Good times. Really.
Jean-Pierre places his buckets in Alice's hands, a certain
frisson to the simple exchange.
JEAN-PIERRE
Tomorrow night?
EMMA
Wait!
Before Alice can respond to Jean-Pierre, Emma takes one of
the buckets from Alice and hands it back to him.
EMMA (CONT'D)
You must keep this one. For your
foundation.
JEAN-PIERRE
But, your family has already been
SO GENEROUS--
(CONTINUED)
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 50.
CONTINUED: (2)
ALICE
She really believes in education.
The doors start to close.
JEAN-PIERRE
Good night, then.
DOMENICO
And, welcome to Monte Carlo.
The doors close, leaving Jean-Pierre and Domenico to gaze
fondly where the three women had just been.
They both sigh and turn for the bar, when they hear shrieking
from the elevator as it rises above them.
Alice, Meg and Emma jump up and down, screaming like girls at
a slumber party, chips flying everywhere.
MONTAGE:
The wings of a brass-framed three-way mirror spin and spread
in a swirling kaleidoscope of shifting reflections:
Alice, Meg and Emma work their way through an increasingly
spectacular and audacious series of combinations, dresses and
gowns, modeling for each other as they are tended to by
SHOPGIRLS and SEAMSTRESSES...
--Alice twirls in a navy dress with white polka dots.
--Meg slaps her own ass with a laugh, admiring herself from
the back in a pair of pencil thin sexy black jeans.
--Emma glows in a pale lavender strapless satin gown.
END MONTAGE:
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 51.
Alice, Meg and Emma watch as a number of their dresses are
boxed and a CASHIER writes them up.
SHOP GIRL
Would you like these put on your
account, Mademoiselle Scott?
ALICE
No. Thank you, we'll be paying
CASH--
EMMA
But, it would be darling if you
could have them sent round our
hotel.
MEG
Wait. You know what, on second
thought, I'm not getting these--
She pulls the pair of jeans from her pile of clothes.
EMMA
But, they looked amazing on you!
A SHOP OWNER (60's) slips a pair of freshly polished men's
shoes into a paper bag, placing them on the counter in front
of Richard, who pulls out his wallet.
RICHARD
(REMEMBERING)
Oh. And the suitcase.
The shop owner retrieves Alice's mended suitcase from a
nearby shelf, a tag on the zipper.
RICHARD (CONT'D)
How much do I owe you for that?
Glenn paces as Richard holds the phone at his desk, the
Esprit de Corps Tours website on his computer's screen.
RICHARD
It's been two days and it didn't
occur to you to call anyone?
A cascade of yellow and gold balloons washes over Alice as
she dances with Meg and Emma to a Euro-trance-pop beat at the
center of the crowded dance floor.
Emma screams with delight in a new dress and plastic tiara,
batting balloons as Domenico who spins her away.
Alice watches with heightened vigilance as Emma dances with
her prince and blows a kiss to Alice and Meg.
MEG
Alice, she's fine...
(MARVELING)
Look where we are! Can you even
remember the last time we danced
like this? It's gotta be-Martha
Lapland's wedding--

Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 59.

ALICE
Actually, sometimes Richard and I
go to Madison's on Saturdays--
MEG
(stops dancing, laughs)
The gay bar?
ALICE
(shrugs, matter of fact)
They've got the best music.
MEG
I am so butting in on that.
Alice laughs and spins, crashing directly into Jean-Pierre.
JEAN-PIERRE
And I was looking for you!
From the edge of the dance floor, NIKOLAI LUDOVIC (late 30s),
squat, bald, completely nondescript but for his white tie and
tails, watches Emma ardently.
He stops a waiter, taking his tray of Champagne flutes.
Emma spins to find Nikolai at her elbow, grinning, holding up
this offering, and she takes him for a waiter.
EMMA
Ooh! Thank you! I'm so thirsty!
Nikolai remains planted, holding his tray with a smile,
watching with bright eyes as Emma drinks.
She lowers her glass and her full attention snags on Nikolai,
really registering his presence now as she searches his warm,
gentle eyes.
EMMA (CONT'D)
It's a wonderful party, isn't it?
Nikolai nods and offers her another glass of Champagne.
Alice, dancing with Jean-Pierre, subtly repositions herself
in order to keep an eye on Emma.
JEAN-PIERRE
Cordelia, she can take care of
herself, yes?
(CONTINUED)
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 60.

ALICE
What? Oh, yeah, of course...
Meg dances by herself, having a great time, taking in the
room, the music and the people, when a handsome MAN begins to
match her moves, insinuates himself.
She smiles but shakes her head as she moves away, turning her
back to evade him.
Another gorgeous MAN sidles up to Meg, joining her solo
dance, wiggling his eyebrows invitingly.
MEG
No, thanks.
She moves off only to be met by GIORGIO (40's, sexy, Euro-
suave) who smoothly steps in.
MEG (CONT'D)
NO--
GIORGIO
(GRINNING WIDE)
Yes! Giorgio!
Emma slips away from dancing with Domenico, moving to Nikolai
who remains with his tray at the ready,.brightening at her
approach, lifting a glass.
EMMA
Don't you need to, like, circulate?
NIKOLAI
Ya znal, chto naydu tebya.
Emma blushes as though showered in compliments.
EMMA
Really?
PENELOPE
(FLAT)
Cordelia Winthrop Scott.
Emma turns, still smiling, to find PENELOPE PENROSE (late
20s, British), frail and bird-like, but attempting to hold a
warrior's stance with her shoulders thrown back.
EMMA
Yes?

Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 61.

PENELOPE
Do you not know who I am?
Emma's smile falters as she glances furtively about.
EMMA
Um. 'Course I do... Hi.
PENELOPE
Penelope. Penelope Penrose.
Penelope's chin quivers as she reads Emma's blank look.
PENELOPE (CONT'D)
I spent a year in hospital--
EMMA
Hospital? What happened?!
PENELOPE
You did! You happened!
Alice swivels around at the raised voices, spots Penelope
facing Emma.
ALICE
Excuse me!
She dodges away from Jean-Pierre, hooking Meg's arm in
passing, yanking her away from Giorgio as she heads for Emma.
PENELOPE
Don't pretend you don't remember!
Third year at Le Rosey! You threw
my luggage in the pool. Set fire
to my mattress. You cut off all my
HAIR--
MEG
What? That's awful!
PENELOPE
While I was sleeping
EMMA
She did that to you?
ALICE
(CORRECTING)
Cordelia! How could you?

PENELOPE
That was just the first night.
ALICE
Say you're sorry, Cordelia.
(WHISPERS)
And let's get out of here!
EMMA
Alice, no--. Wait a minute--
PENELOPE
(to Alice and Meg)
she turned all my friends against
me... They had to send me away...
To live with the nuns--
Emma grabs Penelope by the shoulders.
EMMA
Now, you listen to me, Penelope
Penrose. You have no idea how long
I've waited for this moment.
Penelope flinches, preparing for a beating.
EMMA (CONT'D)
But, I had no way of finding you
after you left us, and...Oh, Penny.
Don't you see? Don't you know that
I was just jealous?
Alice and Meg exchange looks.
PENELOPE
(SMALL)
Jealous?
EMMA
You were so smart. So clever and
BEAUTIFUL--
PENELOPE
I was ugly--
EMMA
No, Penny. I was ugly. I was a
monster.
PENELOPE
Penny Pignose. That's what you
called me--

EMMA
Because, I knew I could never
compete! Not with anyone as
special as you.
PENELOPE
You thought I was special?
Emma looks at Penelope, nods emphatically.
EMMA
You want to know what I've waited
for all these years, Penelope
Penrose?
Penelope shakes her head almost imperceptibly.
EMMA (CONT'D)
To do this.
Emma opens her arms wide and pulls Penelope into a hug.
She looks at Alice and Meg over Penelope's shoulder, and then
closes her eyes with genuine emotion for a beat, pulling back
to smile into Penelope's grateful, tear-streaked face.
EMMA (CONT'D)
Now... Friends?
DOMENICO
(raising a glass)
To friends! old and new!
Emma seizes Penelope's hand from across the table, placing it
in Domenico's as she drunkenly sings the old Girl Scout song.
EMMA
"Make new friends and keep the old,
one is silver and the other's
gold!"
Alice and Jean-Pierre lean toward each other intimately'
across the packed, lively table of PARTY-GOERS.
JEAN-PIERRE
But, no one really lives here.
Monte Carlo. It's like Hong Kong.
People merely come and go. People
like me. Well, and then, people
like yourself.

Alice nods to a WAITER who arrives to refill her Champagne
glass, pouring as Jean-Pierre speaks.
ALICE
People like me?
JEAN-PIERRE
People with money. This is why I
come. I help assuage their guilt
when I remind them that there are
children in this world who do not
have clean water to drink, while
they drink Champagne.
ALICE
And that works?
Jean-Pierre blinks, then bursts out laughing.
JEAN-PIERRE
I take myself far too seriously.
ALICE
No. I'm sorry, I didn't mean--.
I've seen the pictures of the
schools. The work you do is
ADMIRABLE--
JEAN-PIERRE
And I'm afraid I talk about it
because I myself am not that
interesting...
(a hand on her arm)
I'd rather know about you.
ALICE
(TRAPPED)
Oh. Well. You know. I...do what
I can, here and there. A little
volunteer work...
She turns to her Champagne, rolling her eyes at herself.
ALICE (CONT'D)
Oh, brother.
Meg sits further down the length of all the tables laid end
to end, beside Giorgio, who has pulled his chair close,
draping an arm casually across the back of hers.

Okay, wait. You're a man, right?

Giorgio laughs.
MEG (CONT'D)
Yeah, I know: I'm funny. But, see

Ten years you're married, to the
girl you dated in high school. I'm
talking the girl you lost your
virginity to, the one who gave you
two great kids that you're just
crazy about. Then one morning,
what? You wake up, and out of the
blue, it's like, "Oh, hey, honey, I
think I'm in love with this other
woman..."
(PAUSES)
His patrol partner.
A beat as Giorgio shakes his head sadly.
MEG (CONT'D)
I thought I was his partner.
Giorgio takes Meg hand, more in comfort than come on.
GIORGIO
You heart feels betrayed.
MEG
(telling a secret)
I feel like I failed.
GIORGIO
I tell you this: A man...he will
always love the mother of his
children.
Meg blinks, taking this in.
GIORGIO (CONT'D)
Now you must kiss someone else.
MEG
(LAUGHS)
Oh, I see--
GIORGIO
To break the spell. You must!
Then you will be free.
A plate of beautifully arranged langoustine is placed on the
table in front of Meg.

Madame Kelly.
He heads toward for the kitchen before she can say anything.
Emma pours sloppy glasses of Champagne for her companions as
though playing a game of tag, spilling wine.
EMMA
And you're my friend...and you're
my friend. . .and you're my--
She turns with the bottle to find Nikolai who has
materialized beside her on the long banquette.
EMMA (CONT'D)
Oh, hey! You were at the party!
Do you work here, too?
Nikolai cheerfully shakes his head, holds up her purse.
EMMA (CONT'D)
Oh! Did I forget that? Wow, what
a lifesaver! Thanks!
NIKOLAI
Ti takaya vaskhititel'naya.
Emma sets the bottle down to concentrate on Nikolai.
EMMA
You're not from here, are you?

I'm Emm--. My name is Cordelia.
NIKOLAI

Nikolai.
Bernard takes a tray of dishes from his FATHER (70's,
striking resemblance) who enters from the dining room.
BERNARD
Papa, sit down. Rest.
Bernard enters with the tray, stopping when he sees Meg
examining a menu by the front door of the empty bistro.
MEG
(SLY SMILE)
You do cook.
Bernard shrugs, smiling as he comes forward.
BERNARD
You enjoyed your meal?
MEG
Adding the fresh orange; nice.
Bernards nods, accepting the compliment.

Meg hesitates, turning between her friends and Bernard.
BERNARD

You should not miss it.
Alice's repaired suitcase tumbles off the conveyer belt.
RICHARD
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Richard skirts around a man with a newspaper to retrieve the
bag and heads for customs.
As Richard exits, the man folds his newspaper to its bold
headline: SCOTT MAKES A SPLASH!, and a huge photograph of
Emma, Alice and Meg laughing together in the fountain.
Emma enters from the bedroom in a swimsuit and wrap, to find
Alice hanging up the desk phone.
EMMA
Alice, have you seen my sandals?
ALICE
Okay, there's a two o'clock and a
four o'clock train to--

Where are you going?

I'm going to the beach. With
Penelope.
Meg enters through the suite's door carrying a bakery bag.
MEG
Breakfast is here! There's this
fantastic bakery around the corner.
I've already had three brioche.
And I saw the greatest little shop
for the kids, but they weren't open
YET--
(off Alice's look)
What's going on?
(TO EMMA)
What happened?
EMMA
I don't know. She's talking about
train schedules...
Emma trails off as she and Meg and Alice look between each
other in confusion, each processing for a beat.
ALICE
We need to start packing, right?
If we're going back to Paris--
EMMA
Back to Paris?
ALICE
That was the plan--
MEG
What plan?
EMMA
We're not staying for the auction?
ALICE
We were just going to come down,
take a look around and--
MEG
That was before we knew it was for
a charity. Remember the kids?

The ones we stole a trip from? The
kids who are paying for this room?
MEG
Alice, what's with you? We'll pay
for the room--
EMMA
We're rich!
ALICE
So, I'm the only one worried about
the fact that we're lying to
everyone we've met?
MEG
Lying? To who? Jean-Pierre?
EMMA
You're the one who said we had to
go to the casino--
ALICE
And now I'm apparently the only
who's worried we might get caught.
MEG
She's in Iceland.
ALICE
One of her friends is bound to find
out, or her family--
MEG
What friends?
EMMA
I've got friends.
The doorbell rings and they turn their heads in unison, then
look to each other with sudden alarm.
A beat.
Emma goes to the door, finding Penelope, also dressed for the
beach, who holds up the newspaper with it's fountain photo.

Oh, my god! We look great!

MEG
(LAUGHS)
We have got to get that in the
yearbook.
PENELOPE
Yearbook?
ALICE
Penelope, could you excuse us?
PENELOPE
Oh. of course. Where--?
Alice shows Penelope to the bedroom, closes the door and
spins to face Emma and Meg.
ALICE
(HUSHED PANIC)
This is what I'm talking about!
This is why we have to go--
EMMA
Doesn't it mean we have to stay?
MEG
Oh, this is so typical. Just
because it's not on your map,
'cause you didn't plan it--. We
all agree to take this adventure
and then you won't jump.
ALICE
I won't--? Jump?
Meg drops into a chair, mumbling an aside to herself.
MEG
Now I know how Richard must feel.
Alice comes to a full stop and gapes at Meg, stung.

Meg's eyes flick up to Alice.
ALICE (CONT'D)
You can't even bring yourself to
buy a pair of jeans anymore--
EMMA
Okay, you know what? Let's just
pack. It's not fun anymore.
Alice, if you think we should go,
then that's what we're gonna do.
You're in charge.
Meg scoffs, an exasperated exhale.
ALICE
No way. Not anymore I'm not. You
want to go to the beach? Go to the
beach. You want to go the market?
Go! "Liberte, egalite,
fraternite!"
EMMA
What does that mean?
Alice snatches up her purse and heads for the door.
ALICE
It means everyone should do exactly
what they want.
MEG
Exactly.
EMMA
Alice, wait! Where are you--?
You're not going back to Paris--?

She exits, slamming the door behind her.

MEG
(off Emma's look)
Don't look at me like that.
The door opens, and Alice re-enters, striding across the room
for the desk, not looking at either Emma or Meg.
ALICE
I just--. My guide book.
She picks up her book and crosses back to the door.
Penelope, dressed for the evening, gets up from reclining on
the bed to join Emma who models a gown before a mirror.
The two regard Emma's reflection, cocking their heads in an
identical manner at precisely the same time.
Penelope draws a necklace in gesture, indicating Emma's bare
collar bone.
Emma turns, lit by an idea, and pulls the'steel briefcase
from its hiding place beneath the bed.
Meg opens the door from the street, stepping inside, wearing
the sexy jeans she hadn't bought the day before.
Bernards's father makes his way to meet her with menus.
EMILE
Madame?
MEG
Just one.
He leads her to a table along the wall and holds out a chair.
Seated, Meg follows him with her eyes to the kitchen where
Bernard works furiously at the stove, tossing the contents of
a sauce pan with an expert flick of his wrist.
Bernard glances out to the dining room, seeming to sense Meg
before knowing he'll find her there.

The trio of paparazzi putter alongside in a small boat,
peppering the yacht with their camera flashes.
Emma looks out at them, without her usual animation.
PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
Smile, Cordelia! Please, smile!
Emma waves, but can't seem to manage that smile.
NIKOLAI

Emma turns to find Nikolai standing beside her in white tie,
a piece of cake extended in one hand, a fork in the other.
Emma's eyes light up as if a switch has been thrown and the
flash of a camera records her huge, dazzling smile.
EMMA
Niki.
He bows slightly, offering the cake.
EMMA (CONT'D)
You work here too? You never get a

She'll be six in June--
Emile examines photographs of Seamus and Charlotte from Meg's
wallet while she refills their glasses at the kitchen table
and Bernard works at the stove.

MEG
Oh, she's no chicken. She's not
scared of anything--

Not a chicken. He says, she looks

Meg lifts her glass with a sly smile as Bernard brings plates
of food to the table.

But, that's a nice word for it.
Bernard and Meg, flush from their ride, enter the kitchen
through a back door, to be hailed by a half-dozen CHEFS
crowded around a table littered with dishes.

The best chefs of Monte Carlo.
They come here to drink and show
off. The end of every night.
HENRI (60's, a bear in chef's whites) lumbers towards them.
HENRI
No! No! No! We are only cooks
allowed here!
BERNARD
Ah, but, this is why we've come! I
have finally found someone who can
teach you how to cook!
(INTRODUCING)
This is Meg, from America.
(TO MEG)
And this is Henri, the worst
egotist, my mentor.
The two men embrace, merrily kissing each other on both
cheeks, then Henri pulls Meg under his arm.
HENRI
(turns to the table)
A chef from America! Come to flip
hamburgers!
Jean-Pierre drives an open silver sports car full of PARTY
GOERS down the twisting streets, when he sees the commotion
and crowd around the dirt lot.
Then he spots Alice running-around.
Meg tries to follow the discussions and familiar teasing of
the chefs as they pass plates, goading her to taste.
She looks over at Bernard, who smiles as he holds his hands
up at the scene, his boisterous friends, the food; as though
to say "this is good, enjoy."
Meg relaxes her shoulders and gives in to the spirit of the
table, spears a bite of food and lifts her glass to Bernard.
CUT TO:
Meg and another chef, locked in a chopping duel, plow though
onions at a blinding pace, their knives flashing, creating an
escalating staccato on their cutting boards.
Meg sweeps her onion from her board to a pan, and slams her
knife down in victory as all the chefs erupt with applause.
Henri seizes Meg's hand, raising her arm in the air, and
presents her with a bottle of wine.
Meg turns to Bernard, beaming, thrilled, utterly happy, as
the other chefs clap her on the back, shake her hand.
Jean-Pierre opens the door at the top of the fire stairs,
revealing the open sky, turning back to take Alice's hand.

Alice steps out onto the hotel's roof with Jean-Pierre's
jacket over her shoulders.
ALICE (V.O.)
Well, Africa, then. How often do
you get to go?
He leads her around the maze of skylights to the front of the
building that faces the sea and the lightening sky.
JEAN-PIERRE (V.0.)
Not enough. Mostly I am on planes.
To the places where sunlight and
parties make people generous.
Alice, still wearing Jean-Pierre's jacket, walks down the
hall with Jean-Pierre close beside her, neither speaking.
She turns to him when they reach the door of her suite.
A long beat stretches, full of every possibility.
JEAN-PIERRE
Come with me.
ALICE
What?
JEAN-PIERRE
To Dubai. I leave the day after--.
What is today? Friday? I leave

You don't know me.
JEAN-PIERRE
This is why I ask. I would like to
know you, Alice. Very much.
Alice regards him a beat, then slowly pulls his jacket from
her shoulders.
ALICE
Before this, I'd never even been to
France.
Jean-Pierre blinks and Alice laughs, as much at herself.
ALICE (CONT'D)
It's true. Just kept putting it
off. Always managed to find an
excuse. But, really, it was that I
was afraid. That it couldn't ever
live up to the France I'd imagined.
And if it did... Then I'd never be
able to go home.
JEAN-PIERRE
And, now?
Alice gently places Jean-Pierre's jacket in his hands and
steps near to kiss him on the lips.
ALICE
But, thank you.
She turns and opens the door with her key as Jean-Pierre
smiles ruefully.
ALICE (CONT'D)
For everything.
Alice steps into her room and closes the door.
Richard stands at the information counter, conferring with an
ATTENDANT in his broken French.
RICHARD
Excusez-moi...I'm looking for the
train. To Monte Carlo.
Behind him, Cordelia strides through a set of doors to stop
directly at Richard's back as she searches the terminal and
hisses into her cellphone.
CORDELIA
Yes, Daddy, I'm here. No, I do not
see a driver. Yes, I am looking!
The attendant points over Richard's shoulder to an exit.
Richard begins to turn in Cordelia's direction, but the
attendant corrects him, pointing the other way.
RICHARD
Merci.
He picks up Alice's suitcase and heads off just as a
UNIFORMED DRIVER approaches Cordelia.
DRIVER
Mademoiselle Scott?
CORDELIA
Where have you been?
The driver leads her away, neither she nor Richard having
taken note of the nearby newsstand and its display of today's
front page: Emma on the yacht wearing Cordelia's necklace.
Alice sits on the edge of the bed with the hotel phone, idly
looking out at the sparkling bay and anchored boats.
ALICE
(leaving a message)
Well, I wish you were there. Or
here. I wish you were here,
Richard. I do... Because I keep
thinking, no matter what I see, I'm
only seeing half of it. Because
we're not seeing it together...
Meg lets herself in the front door and heads for the bedroom,
stopping when she overhears Alice on the phone.
ALICE (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, Richard. I hope you'll
be there when I get home...
Because that's all I want.
Alice hangs up the phone, so lost in thought she doesn't see
Meg standing at the door.

I don't know how I would've gotten

weren't for you--
ALICE
No. It's okay. You were right--

Oh, Meg! I made a huge mistake!
MEG
Wha--?
ALICE
Richard asked me to marry him--
MEG
Wait. What? When?
ALICE
I told him we should wait a week!
MEG
No. You didn't--

didn't take, they just crashed down
on me: And I hadn't seen anything
but the end of Lake Avenue. The
only clear thought in my head was,
"this guy is so wonderful, how can
he marry half a person?"
MEG
But, Alice. You were going. We
were on our way.
ALICE
I thought he was asking me to make
a choice. But, he wasn't. He
wasn't doing that at all. It was
me. Because I couldn't believe he
loved me just for who I was.
France or no.

All I had to do was say, "yes."
MEG
Honey, Richard knows you... It
might feel like it's over. But,

The suite's doorbell rings and they both look up.

Cordelia strides across the lobby, passing WORKERS who set up

very center of the suite, their heads swinging toward the
door when they hear the key inserted from the other side.

marches in to the room...

attempted murder in the Grimaldi
Suite. Cordelia Scott--
Richard, sitting nearby, looks up at the mention of
Cordelia's name, at the same time that Nikolai takes a seat
at the far end of the same sofa.
CLERK
No. No. It is robbery. But,
Mademoiselle Scott said it wasn't.
Jean-Pierre, checking lists at the ballroom's entrance, notes
the commotion and Cordelia's name, joins the group.
JEAN-PIERRE
Excuse me. What's--? Mademoiselle
Scott has been robbed?
CLERK
No. She said, not.
POLICE CAPTAIN
She said someone was trying to kill
her! We are going up!
Richard seems to debate getting involved as the police, the
clerk and Jean-Pierre head for the elevators.
Looking over, he notices Nikolai, who smiles and nods.
CORDELIA
You can save your "sorrys" for the
POLICE--
EMMA
The police--?

CORDELIA
You robbed me!
ALICE
But, the necklace is right here--!
CORDELIA
You stole from me--!
EMMA
ONLY BORROWED--
MEG
We haven't taken anything--
EMMA
And, we dry-cleaned the dresses--
Meg and Alice wince, look daggers at Emma.
CORDELIA
(ICY DISGUST)
You wore my clothes?
EMMA
Well... For the children.
CORDELIA
Wha--? What children?
MEG
In Africa.
ALICE
(IMPATIENT)
This whole thing is for charity.
Your necklace is for the auction.
CORDELIA
Well, there will certainly be no
AUCTION NOW--
EMMA
But, that's not fair! It's not the
CHILDREN'S FAULT--
ALICE
Look, you weren't here. Everyone
thought she was you--

CORDELIA
(INCREDULOUS LAUGH)
Thought she was me? Who could
possibly believe--?
ALICE
They all did.
Cordelia looks at Alice a beat as this lands with her.
MEG
(drives it home)
Every one of them.
CORDELIA
But, look at you!
Emma takes a step towards her doppelganger, facing off.
EMMA
Well, look at you!
ALICE
EMMA--
CORDELIA
(DRIPPING CONTEMPT)
Common country cows playing dress
up. Pretending to be something
you're not. Trying to be something
that not one of you could ever hope
TO BE--
EMMA
You mean miserable?
Cordelia blinks.
EMMA (CONT'D)
Or a petty, spoiled, selfish--
CORDELIA
(REELS BACK)
You--!
EMMA
Bitch!
Cordelia slaps Emma across the face.
Alice and Meg gasp and they all stand a beat in shock.

Emma raises a hand to cup her cheek as Alice and Meg turn
slowly to Cordelia, their faces set like warrior masks.
DING! The elevator doors open and the police spill out,
followed by the clerk and Jean-Pierre.
They hear a SCREAM! and break into a run.
Alice shoves Cordelia roughly into a chair, thrusting her
back down as she tries to struggle up, points at Emma.
ALICE
You apologize to her right now!
CORDELIA
Apologize--?!
ALICE
You know, I feel sorry for you--
MEG
I don't.
Cordelia scoffs and Alice leans over her, menacing.
ALICE
Because no matter where you go, no
matter where you jet to in this
world, you are still going to be
you.
(points to Emma)
And, let me tell you; she is who
you want to be!
The all freeze when a BANGING erupts at the door.
POLICE CAPTAIN (O.S.)
Mademoiselle Scott? It is the
police! Open up!
Alice claps a hand over Cordelia's mouth, looks to Meg.
EMMA
(mouths the words)
The police?
0
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 112.
The police captain pounds on the door again, motioning for
the clerk to use his pass key.
POLICE CAPTAIN
Mademoiselle? Open this door!
ALICE (O.S.)
Coming! Just a moment, please!
The captain grabs the key from the clerk and turns the
handle, just as Alice coolly opens the door from within.
ALICE (CONT'D)
Bon jour.
The police enter, followed by Jean-Pierre and the clerk.
ALICE
(FEIGNED SURPRISE)
Cordelia, it's the police.
Emma turns her head from the mirror she faces.
EMMA
Oh, no! This is going to be so
embarrassing. Please tell me you
didn't run all the way over here
just for me.
POLICE CAPTAIN
You said there was someone trying
to kill you--
CLERK
It was a robbery, but, no.
JEAN-PIERRE
Alice, what's going on?
ALICE
A terrible misunderstanding. You
see, she couldn't find her
necklace.
JEAN-PIERRE
(PANICKED)
But, you have it?

Emma turns, holding the necklace up to her throat.
EMMA
Yes, but, Jean-Pierre, would you be
a dear and help me? I can't seem
to manage the clasp.
Jean-Pierre senses something amiss, but steps to assist Emma.
POLICE CAPTAIN
We heard a scream--
ALICE
When she found it--
EMMA
JUST NOW--
ALICE
She was so happy--
EMMA
Relieved! I screamed with delight.
POLICE CAPTAIN
And there is no one that wants to
kill you?
EMMA
(LIGHTLY JOKING)
Well, I can't speak to that.
POLICE CAPTAIN
You said on the phone--
ALICE
She said she would die. If she
didn't find it--
EMMA
The necklace!
ALICE
Yes!
Alice turns her brightest smile to the captain.
POLICE CAPTAIN
And this is the necklace? For the
auction?

JEAN-PIERRE
(CHECKING)
It is.
He looks back and forth between Alice and Emma.
JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D)
Very lucky.
EMMA
Extremely! Think of all the
schools we'll build!
(to charm captain)
Do you like it?
POLICE CAPTAIN
(falling for it)
Allow me to escort you,
Mademoiselle. As a precaution.
Emma, spots one officer poking his way toward the bedroom.
EMMA
(seizes captain's arm)
Oh, but, yes! Would you? What an
entrance I'll make! So dramatic!
Alice, are you coming, dear?
Jean-Pierre takes Alice's elbow as Emma leads the captain and
the rest of the group from the suite.
ALICE
Let me just grab my purse.
Alice opens the door as narrowly as possible.
ALICE
You okay in here?
Meg sits on top of Cordelia who is tied to a chair with a
scarf, the fruit-basket apple jammed in her mouth.
MEG
We're great. But, now you can add
KIDNAPPING--
ALICE
(RE: CORDELIA)
Well, don't tell her that. Throw
me a purse.
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 115.
DING! Richard and Nikolai both look up as the elevator doors
open and Emma emerges led by the police captain.
Nikolai leaps up.
NIKOLAI
Moy angelochek?
Richard jumps up when he sees Jean-Pierre escorting an
anxious Alice from the rear of the battalion.
RICHARD
Alice?
Alice winces as she sees Richard approaching, at the same
time Nikolai rushes to Emma.
EMMA
Niki, I'm sorry. It's just going
to another minute.
NIKOLAI
Ya sdelayu vsyo, chto smogoo--
EMMA
Perfect! That sounds good.
Emma is led to the ballroom by the captain as Richard meets
Alice and Jean-Pierre in the center of the lobby.
ALICE
(quick, preemptive)
Richard, this is Jean-Pierre, Jean-
Pierre this is Richard, my fiance--
RICHARD JEAN-PIERRE
(BLINKS) (BLINKS)
Fiance? Fiance?
Jean-Pierre offers his hand to shake, smiling knowingly.
JEAN-PIERRE
Ahh... A pleasure to meet you.
You've come for the auction--?
ALICE
Yes! He came all this way!
Richard tightens his grip on Jean-Pierre's hand.

RICHARD
Alice? Who is this guy--?
Alice breaks Richard's vice grip with a bright smile.
ALICE
I told you, that's Jean-Pierre!
(TO JEAN-PIERRE)
He's exhausted! It's such a long
trip!
Richard flicks his eyes narrowly at Jean-Pierre.
JEAN-PIERRE
(DEFLECTING)
I believe we are ready to start.
Shall we go in?
Alice loops an arm through Richard's to follow Jean-Pierre,
but jerks to a stop when Richard doesn't budge.
RICHARD
Is there something I need to know?
Alice looks at Richard, reading his face, and smiles.
ALICE
No. There's isn't.
She leads Richard through the ballroom entrance only to be
stopped by an ATTENDANT.
ATTENDANT
Pardon, Monsieur, invitation--?
ALICE
He's with me!
As Alice pulls Richard through to the ballroom, Nikolai steps
to the reception table behind them, producing an elaborate
invitation from inside his jacket.
ATTENDANT
Oh! Monsieur Ludovic! Welcome!
As Nikolai is ushered into the auction with great fanfare,
the lobby's revolving doors turn and Bernard enters, carrying
Meg's bottle of wine.

Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 117.
Meg, holding the apple, sits facing Cordelia, still tied to a
chair, the two glaring at each other.
CORDELIA
You will never get away with this.
MY FATHER--
MEG
Believe me, nothing would make me
happier than having a little talk
with your father--
Both their heads swing toward the door when the bell RINGS!
Meg jumps to Cordelia, stuffing the apple in her mouth just
as she opens it to scream.
Bernard looks up when Meg opens the door a crack.
MEG
Bernard...?
He holds out the bottle of wine.
BERNARD
We forgot your prize.
MEG
Oh, I...
She glances back into the room behind her, carefully
obscuring Bernard's view through the half open door.
BERNARD
I have come at a bad time?
MEG
No. No, Bernard, that's not it.
Cordelia kicks her legs against the floor, straining against
the scarf as she tries to overturn the chair.
MEG
I'd invite you in, but--

THUMP! They both hear Cordelia's chair hit the floor inside
and Bernard darkens.
BERNARD
I think--. You are busy. I think
now I go--
Meg reaches out to stay him with a hand on his arm.
MEG
No. Bernard, wait--
CLICK! Meg and Bernard both turn their heads to look down
the corridor when Cordelia sticks her head out the bedroom
door into the hall.
A beat as Cordelia and Meg lock eyes.
DING! The elevator doors open at the end of the hall, closer
to Cordelia.
She looks back at Meg for an instant then bolts as Meg leaps
past Bernard into the hall.
MEG (CONT'D)
Hey! Stop!
Emma models Cordelia's necklace on a stage for over a hundred
GUESTS with Domenico fielding bids beside her.
DOMENICO
The bid is three hundred thousand!
Alice stands just off to the side on the floor below, between
Richard and Jean-Pierre, with Penelope.
RICHARD

Cordelia Scott because...
ALICE
It's for a school, Richard--
RICHARD
In Africa.

Nikolai steps to the front of the assembly.
DOMENICO

ALICE
Oh,no...
JEAN-PIERRE
Yes !
EMMA
(TO HERSELF)
No.
Nikolai smiles up at Emma as ANOTHER GUEST raises a Champagne
glass in bidding.
DOMENICO
Five hundred, five hundred fifty
thousand!
Bernard races to catch up as Meg flies down the stairs.
BERNARD
But, Meg! Why do we run?
Meg stops on a landing, turns.
MEG
Bernard, you should stop. You
really don't need this. I may be
going away for a long time--
BERNARD
To America?
MEG
Something like that. Look, this is
where we should say "au revoir."
Bernard smiles and pulls Meg to him, kisses her.
BERNARD
But, I must see how this ends!
0 He grabs her hand and they plunge down the stairs together.
Monte Carlo Draft 3 - November 4, 2007 120.
NIKOLAI
Eight hundred!
The crowd applauds happily.
EMMA
Niki. What are you doing?
NIKOLAI

EMMA
Well, don't. Just stop, okay?
JEAN-PIERRE

Why is she stopping him?
ALICE

He doesn't have any money. He's
just a busboy, but they're in love-
JEAN-PIERRE
That's Nikolai Ludovic--
ALICE
He means no harm--
JEAN-PIERRE
Alice. Lithuania?
ALICE
Yes?
JEAN-PIERRE
He owns it.
Alice blinks.

Jean-Pierre reacts to Alice's "Emma!" as she breaks away.
RICHARD
Alice--!
She climbs the stage to Emma before the baffled audience.
EMMA
Alice, he doesn't understand. It's
like a foreign language to him--
ALICE
Actually, it's not. Let him bid.
EMMA
But, he'll get in trouble--
ALICE
He's fine. Let's just get this
THING DONE--
NIKOLAI
One million!
EMMA
Nikolai! You cannot bid against
yourself!
DOMENICO
One million Euros!
EMMA
No! Stop! Stop! I'm sorry. I

The crowd gasps, stepping back to reveal Cordelia in the
center of the ballroom, backed by all the police, just as Meg
.and Bernard enter, skidding short when they see the crowd.
MEG
Oh, shhhh--
EMMA
Merde.
Richard, Jean-Pierre, Penelope, and Domenico all swing
between the two "Cordelias," as Meg makes her way forward
with Bernard.
CORDELIA
Arrest those women! They are
imposters!
A wave of comment sweeps the confused crowd.
PENELOPE
Wait!
Penelope steps up onto the platform, shielding Emma and Alice
as the police come forward and Meg climbs up.
PENELOPE (CONT'D)
These are not imposters! These are
my friends!
CORDELIA
Penelope Pignose?!
PENELOPE
And, you were never anyone's
friend.
Alice takes in the escalating situation, steps bravely
forward to the front of the stage.
ALICE
It's true!
A ripple of exclamation sweeps the dumbfounded crowd.

Richard smiles at Alice, supporting her with his gaze.
ALICE (CONT'D)
We wanted to help.

We never meant to mislead anyone--

NIKOLAI (CONT'D)

Emma's eyes slowly come into focus as it all becomes
clear-and she FAINTS.
Alice sits between Richard and Meg at the departure gate,
each lost in their own thoughts as TRAVELERS pass to and fro.
A long beat.
A small smile finds its way onto Alice's face and she gently
lowers her head to rest it on Richard's shoulder.
Richard finds Alice's hand and squeezes it in his own.
Meg walks down the jetway in her skinny jeans, a bounce in
her step, shopping bags in one hand, the bottle of wine
gripped in the other, as though headed for a party.
Behind her, Alice carries her shopping bags and Richard totes
Alice's suitcase.
ALICE (V.0.)
"I used to wander aimlessly,/
Wanton my goal, grievous my
plight./Your dear hands led me,
guided me."
Alice encircles Richard's waist as they walk, and he slings
an arm around her shoulder, kisses her hair.
FADE OUT.
FADE IN:
A bulletin board in Meg's classroom is covered in African
fabric, photographs and letters, all under a banner that
reads: Food Drive for Our Sister School - Zambia.
The two students who had cooked their pot holders sort canned
goods beneath the board, while Meg cooks, surrounded by the
rest of her CLASS.
ALICE (V.0.)
"No sound - save his own tread
upon/The ground - to ease the
wanderer's heart./Your voice
encouraged me: 'go on!"'

A STUDENT carefully scoops spices with a measuring spoon,
holding it out for Meg to add to her pan.
She ignores the spoon, instead reaching to pinch some spice
with her fingers and encourages the student who follows her
example.
Alice moves freely around the center of the circle of desks
her STUDENTS have formed, reciting by memory.
ALICE
"Yes, my heart - dark, cowed, set
apart,/Alone - bewailed its dire
distress./Sweet love, with its all-
conquering art."
The entire classroom hangs on her every word.
