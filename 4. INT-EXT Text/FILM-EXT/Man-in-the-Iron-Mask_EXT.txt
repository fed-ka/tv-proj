ESTABLISHING THE ISLAND FORTRESS PRISON - DAY
On a gash of rock thrusting upward from the sea along the
southern coast of France stands an island fortress, a prison,
like an Alcatraz of the Mediterranean.
Just off a coastline
renowned for its beauty, the fortress is horrible and
foreboding.
As we SUPERIMPOSE:
1662
TWENTY-TWO YEARS LATER
ESTABLISHING PARIS - DAY
SUPERIMPOSE:
PARIS
PARIS STREET - NIGHT
Through the narrow streets of the old city gallops a dashing
figure, his cloak flying behind him and catching the
moonlight, his horse's hooves clattering along the
cobblestones as he dodges the beggars living in the filthy
shadows.
He is a magnetic sight, riding the horse as easily
as if they were racing across an open field and not through a
cluttered street, and guiding the stallion as if its grace
and power came not from the animal but from the rider.
Sitting lightly in the saddle is
D'ARTAGNAN
famous Musketeer, Captain of the King's Royal Bodyguard.
He
is still handsome at mid-life, still erect, unambiguous in
his courage and his loyalty.
He rides past a knot of angry beggars, moving through the
streets breaking windows and scavenging for food.
When they
see d'Artagnan, some throw rocks at him.
They sail by
d'Artagnan's head; he ducks them with the fluid grace of a
boxer dodging punches, and keeps on riding.
OUTSIDE THE CATHEDRAL
D'Artagnan rides into the courtyard of a grand old residence
beside Notre Dame Cathedral.
Priests are dispensing food to
beggars gathered in the courtyard.
As d'Artagnan reins his
horse to a stop the wretched people stare with contempt at
the royal symbols on his uniform.
But d'Artagnan is not a
man anyone would be quick to confront; as he dismounts and
moves toward the doorways the people part for him.
He pauses as he sees, parked to one side of the old
residence, a big rickety carriage.
D'Artagnan smiles.
D'ARTAGNAN
Porthos too!
D'Artagnan hears drunken feminine giggles echoing down the
staircase of the tower above him.
THE ROYAL PALACE - GARDENS - DAY
Attractive young adults strut about in the extravagant attire
of Louis XIV's France, the men like peacocks, the ladies in
gowns that seem to squeeze their entire bodies up into their
bosoms.
They laugh and smile and strike courtly poses
pretending to talk with each other -- but all eyes are on the
doorway, through which the king is about to come...
JUST BEYOND THAT PALACE DOORWAY
KING LOUIS the Fourteenth is having his wardrobe adjusted by
a flock of tailors.
He is twenty-two, and would be quite
handsome, except for the total self-absorption.
He's
checking himself in a full length golden mirror as two of his
advisors, PIERRE and CLAUDE, try to speak with him.
PIERRE
Your Majesty, I know it is a... a
festive time, but before --
KING LOUIS
The blue sash.
No, the burgundy!
PIERRE
... before the party begins --
KING LOUIS
The party has already begun -- so
why are you delaying me?
PIERRE
We do not wish to delay you,
Majesty, but... as your advisors, we
feel it is our -- our --
CLAUDE
... our duty.
PIERRE
Yes!
It is our duty to let you
know... there are riots in Paris.
LOUIS
Riots?
My people live in the
world's most beautiful city, their
king has the grandest palaces on
earth.
Why should they feel
anything but pride and contentment?
PIERRE
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and
I'm sure they are content... except
that... well, they are starving.
LOUIS
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry.
But why would they riot about it?
As he says this, a replica of the Matterhorn made of fruits
and meringues is carried past the window by a team of chefs.
PIERRE
Majesty... We have more than enough
food set aside for your birthday
celebration next week.
If we
distributed some of that, we would
have time to gather more before --
LOUIS
Aramis!
I have been expecting you!
(to the tailors)
We are satisfied, that will do.
The tailors and advisors withdraw as Aramis -- still in his
simple priest's robe -- strides forward and bows to the kind.
ARAMIS
Your birthday celebration, your
Majesty?
LOUIS
Next week.
This is a mere garden
party -- and I wish to join it, so I
will be brief.
I am experiencing
resistance from the Jesuits.
ARAMIS
Well... perhaps you should speak
with them, your Majesty.
LOUIS
I have demanded it -- and common
priests present themselves!
Can you
imagine the arrogance?
Common
Jesuit priests try to act as my
equals, and they refuse to reveal
the names of anyone else in their
order!
No one can keep secrets like
the Jesuits can, and the identity of
their leader is the darkest secret
they hold.
Even the Pope himself
does not know who leads the Jesuit
Order in France!
He suspects the
Governor General of Jesuits, whoever
he is, is angling to become Pope
himself.
ARAMIS
How can I serve you in this?
LOUIS
Perhaps you can find out who this
secret leader of the Jesuits is.
You are now a priest, but you were
once a Musketeer, serving the throne
of France, a throne ordained of God.
Can you accept this mission, and
keep it private?
ARAMIS
If I find out the identity of this
Jesuit rebel.
I will kill both him
and the man who told me.
LOUIS
Once a Musketeer, always a
Musketeer, eh?
Aramis bows and Louis turns back to his mirror.
There are
mirrors everywhere in his palace, and he loves his
reflection, adorned as he is all in golden cloth, like fabric
from the sun.
Aramis leaves and the advisors return.
LOUIS
Ah yes, the riots.
We have food
stocks on the wharves right now, no?
PIERRE
That food has spoiled.
That is why
it was not shipped to the army.
LOUIS
Exactly why it should be given away.
PIERRE
What... an excellent idea, your
Majesty!
PALACE GARDENS - DAY
Among the guests are Raoul and MICHELLE, a stunningly
beautiful young woman.
Michelle is awed by the richness all
around them, while Raoul sees only her.
He holds the ring.
MICHELLE
Isn't it glorious!
RAOUL
Michelle...
But just as he starts to speak, trumpets blast and the King
steps through the doors and out into the lavish gardens; the
party goers give him a rousing ovation.
Raoul returns the
ring to his jacket, to wait for another moment.
Everyone watches the King, who begins guzzling wine and
telling jokes to his sycophants, who howl at the King's
witticisms.
Then Louis catches sight of Raoul and Michelle,
and lowers his voice, to his FRIENDS...
LOUIS
Who is that?
FRIEND 1
Raoul, son of Athos.
LOUIS
Not the soldier, you idiot!
FRIEND 2
Her name is Michelle.
The king is transfixed.
D'ARTAGNAN
is presiding over a huddle of fresh faced young Musketeers,
directing them to their positions around the gardens, like
secret service agents protecting a president.
He leaves
them, and quickly moves to the King.
D'ARTAGNAN
Your Majesty...
LOUIS
What is it, d'Artagnan?
Assassins
falling from the sky now?
The sycophants laugh loudly.
D'ARTAGNAN
The plans for use of the maze were
not disclosed to me.
LOUIS
I decided it this morning.
D'ARTAGNAN
Then you must allow me to stay close
to you so that --
LOUIS
I am King, d'Artagnan.
I will
change my mind as I wish, and I will
enjoy my banquet as I wish!
D'ARTAGNAN
But I deployed the Royal Guards
according to your previous --
LOUIS
Let us play a game, d'Artagnan, let
us pretend I am King and you are
Captain of my Musketeers.
Let us
behave as if my wish is law.
And my
wish is to enjoy this party!
D'Artagnan bows sharply as the young sycophants chuckle.
D'Artagnan retreats, then looks back to Louis and follows his
gaze to the tender young beauty who caught his eye.
D'Artagnan recognizes Raoul, son of his friend Athos.
RAOUL AND MICHELLE
As the guests mix and mingle, Raoul tries again.
RAOUL
Michelle, I... Ever since I returned
I've been wanting to speak with you
about... about --
A gaunt SERVANT interrupts, presenting a tray of delicacies.
SERVANT
Monsieur, Mademoiselle...?
RAOUL
No!
Thank you -- Michelle, I --
They are interrupted by the SQUEAL of a piglet, squirming in
the hands of the king's dwarf, who holds the fat little
animal above his head and runs among the startled guests.
LOUIS
It pleases us to announce an
entertainment for our guests!
A
contest of agility and cunning!
He takes the pig from his dwarf; the pig is clean and
perfumed, a colorful fake horn tied onto its head.
LOUIS
Behold our unicorn!
Whichever of
our guests captures the unicorn
shall win its treasure!
With this announcement the King produces a diamond the size
of a pecan, suspended from a ribbon; the guests gasp at its
richness.
The King ties the diamond around the pig's neck.
RAOUL AND MICHELLE
Michelle is amazed at this.
MICHELLE
I have never seen a diamond so
large!
It almost makes Raoul ashamed of the modest ring hidden in
his hand.
LOUIS
Into the maze!
All of you!
Disperse, I command you!
The dwarf releases the pig, poking him through a tiny break
in the hedge; the critter skitters as only a pig can, eluding
the first laughing lunges of the guests.
THE PIG CHASE is a merry melee, as the maze becomes a tangle
of confusion.
LOUIS climbs to a platform above the top of
the ten foot hedge that forms the maze.
From his perch he
looks down on all the action, and calls encouragement.
LOUIS
Are you men or mice?!
MICHELLE squeals as the pig scurries by and Raoul dives for
it.
He almost has the pig... then it kicks free.
RAOUL
The pendant will be yours!
With that he races after the pig.
MICHELLE tries to follow, this way, that way, through the
maze.
Then she stops, face to face with the King, entering
through a gate hidden in one of the maze's dead corners.
LOUIS
Michelle, isn't it?
Speechless, she nods.
LOUIS
I would have said it was impossible,
but I believe the excitement of the
chase has made you even more
beautiful.
MICHELLE
Sire, I --
LOUIS
You blush!
You do not wish to be
beautiful to your King?
Her eyes go still; she understands what is happening.
FROM BEHIND THE GATE, we see d'Artagnan, watching as Louis
tries to seduce the young woman.
Even as d'Artagnan watches,
the pig comes rooting through the hedge; with a deft movement
d'Artagnan catches the animal's leg and lifts it with the
sureness of the farm boy he once was.
The pig is quiet and
comfortable in d'Artagnan's hands.
D'Artagnan watches as the King approaches Michelle, and she
allows him to touch her cheek.
The king leans to kiss her...
Michelle does not move...
WHHEEEKKKK!
The pig sails over the gate and hits the ground
running, right at Louis' feet; it sets him dancing.
The spell of the king's royal attention is shattered; as the
pig scrambles away, Michelle backs away.
LOUIS
Wait!
Michelle, I --
Too late, he sees the shadow of the man looming above him,
leaping down onto him from the observation platform.
It is
the servant who offered the tray to Raoul and Michelle; he
has armed himself with a knife from the carving table, and is
diving now to plunge the blade into the king's throat.
The king is helpless, frozen.
The assassin leaps, falling
toward the king... and is impaled on the sword of d'Artagnan,
springing through the gate to save his king.
Michelle screams, the king gasps, and the assassin drops,
mortally wounded.
They stare down at him now; the would-be
assassin gurgles words through his agony...
ASSASSIN
Feed... your... people.
Party guests, having heard Michelle scream, are running in to
find them.
Michelle rushes off, to find Raoul; several
people are coming up.
ASSASSIN
Your people starve...!
Feed --
The king snatches out his own dagger and imperiously cuts the
throat of the dying man, to stop these offensive words.
The
king looks at his stunned subjects.
LOUIS
A pitiful madman, nothing more.
Come, let us continue our chase!
Where is our unicorn?
The King prances away.
It takes the guests a moment, but
they know that only gaiety will please their King, and off
they go again, laughing as if nothing happened.
D'Artagnan stands still as the young Musketeers under his
command come rushing up with swords drawn.
YOUNG MUSKETEER
Captain!
Seeing the dead assassin, their eyes fill with admiration.
YOUNG MUSKETEER
You are the best --
D'Artagnan can't even listen; with a last glance at the King
he turns quickly and walks away.
PARIS STREETS - DAY
Magnificent public buildings -- palaces and cathedrals --
grace the city's skyline, but here in central Paris all is
squalor.
On a narrow, filthy street, beggars bother the
sullen city peasants who are weak with hunger themselves.
But interest perks up when two soldiers drive up in a wagon,
and one of them, Lieutenant Andre, announces --
LIEUTENANT
Here is food, the gift of your
loving King, on his birthday!
He
gives to himself by giving to you,
in that he loves you so much!
Slowly at first the paupers stand and shuffle forward.
As
the soldiers begin handing out foodstuffs -- bread, cabbages,
tomatoes, eggs -- those nearest the wagon begin to jostle
each other, and a large crowd gathers quickly.
LIEUTENANT
No need to fight, there is plenty
for all!
It's looking like a holiday celebration... until a RUFFIAN
breaks open a loaf of bread, and wrinkles his nose.
RUFFIAN
This stuff stinks.
It is rotting!
The King gives us rotten food!
He hurls the moldy bread back at the soldiers.
Other paupers
sniff the food, and its stink set off an explosion of anger:
they throw food at the soldiers... Then a paving stone
crashes through a shop window, and suddenly it's a riot, with
the mob overwhelming the soldiers and dragging them down the
streets in the direction of the palace.
D'ARTAGNAN, riding toward the palace himself, turns a corner
and sees the mob coming.
And they see him:
the elegant,
dashing Musketeer on the prancing stallion.
And at that moment, two more soldiers race out of a side
street, fleeing a similar mob, coming from another direction.
D'Artagnan understands everything at a glance; the second
pair of fleeing soldiers reach him in panic.
PANICKED SOLDIER
Back, toward the palace!
We cannot
hold them off!
We will fire a
volley into them!
D'ARTAGNAN
No!
Run to the palace and close the
gates.
But do not fire!
The two new soldiers race away; d'Artagnan waits calmly on
his horse, as the mobs from both directions converge on him.
THE MOB, seeing the dashing Musketeer wait so confidently for
them, slow up; but the ruffian urges them on.
RUFFIAN
Come on!
To the palace!
D'Artagnan sits calmly in their way.
He doesn't even draw
his sword, though members of the mob grab the reins of his
horse.
Some of the mob recognize him, and murmur...
MOB
It's d'Artagnan!
Le Generale de
Musketeers!
The mob hesitates -- for the name d'Artagnan means heroism
and patriotism to all of them.
RUFFIAN
One Musketeer can't stop us!
D'ARTAGNAN
Stop you?
You are Frenchmen, are
you not?
I am one of you.
RUFFIAN
The King is a Frenchman, but he is
not one of us!
D'ARTAGNAN
Citizens of Paris!
Give ear to me!
RUFFIAN
We'll give you their ears!
With that he draws a dagger from his filthy shirt and puts it
to the ear of the young Lieutenant who is already bloody from
being dragged through the street.
D'ARTAGNAN
Wait -- and listen!
I beg you!
RIOTER
They give us garbage, not fit for
rats!
They think we are garbage!
With that one of the rioters hurls a moldy beet at
d'Artagnan, who draws his sword in a slick liquid movement,
he cuts the vegetable from the air.
The display of expertise is startling.
Someone else throws a
head of lettuce; d'Artagnan slices it in half, and as the
pieces fly he skewers one with the point of his sword.
D'ARTAGNAN
I'm on my way to a salad!
Doesn't
anybody have any endive?
The mob laughs at this panache, and the amazing display of
swordsmanship that lies behind it.
Someone tosses more
lettuce, and d'Artagnan divides and skewers this one as well.
This time the crowd applauds.
D'ARTAGNAN
A tomato?
Can he do it?
Someone fires a tomato right at his head, and
sure enough d'Artagnan spears it.
Then, with a victorious
flourish, he takes a bite of it.
His face contorts with the
taste, and he spits the pieces out; the crowd is hushed.
D'ARTAGNAN
You are right.
It is rotten.
I
will speak to the King myself.
You
have my word.
The mob is completely won over by d'Artagnan; the ruffian,
angry that his riot is fizzling, raises his knife again over
the soldiers, but now the point of d'Artagnan's sword flicks
to the ruffian's neck.
D'ARTAGNAN
And you will release those men --
for they serve France... and you.
RIOTERS
Three cheers for d'Artagnan!
Hurrah...!!
Hurrah...!!
The soldiers who moments before were about to be ripped apart
now stand and look at d'Artagnan in gratitude and awe.
The
mob has forgotten them; they see only d'Artagnan as he rakes
his blade clean, returns it to its scabbard, reins his horse
around, and slowly rides away, escorting the soldiers back
toward the palace.
TRENCH - DARKNESS
Two men move along a deep trench, the siege works of 17th
century siege warfare.
One of the men is Raoul, carrying a
musket; in his new uniform he looks out of place among the
dirty, battle weary men they pass.
He is following the STAFF
OFFICER who is no older than himself, but whose eyes are
already dead, while Raoul's are wide and wild.
The trench is deep as a grave; by crouching, both men keep
their heads below the surrounding ground.
Thick smoke rolls
over their heads; we can't tell if it is day or night.
From
all around come sounds of battle, with the sporadic fire of
muskets and the rumble of cannons; officers shout orders in
the distance; wounded men nearby whimper for water and the
officer leads Raoul by them as if they did not exist.
The young Staff Officer stops at a bend in the trench.
STAFF OFFICER
Here.
Without another word he goes back the way he came.
Raoul
grips his musket and looks around him; he finds himself among
several dozen stark eyed men manning the forward curve of the
trench.
He has little time to wonder what will happen next.
A horn trumpets close by, and with a shout, the French
soldiers clamber out of their breastworks.
For an instant, Raoul hesitates in pure terror, then joins
the charge with a shout of his own --
RAOUL
Mi-cheeelllll!! --
On the stone wall looming above the French soldiers, orange
blossoms of fire -- the muzzle flash of primitive cannons --
penetrate the smoke, and the ground at Raoul's feet explodes,
hurling him backwards.
He covered barely a few feet, and
falls almost exactly where he started.
Dead.
CUT TO:
CLOSE - THE DOOR OF ATHOS' ROOMS - DAY
A gloved hand raps on the door.
Athos opens it to a military
messenger, who shoves at him a single sheet of paper, rolled
and tied with ribbon.
MUSKETEER'S GATE OF THE PALACE - DAY
The Musketeer's Gate is close to the stables where the
Musketeers train and keep their horses.
D'Artagnan hurries
from the Palace and snaps an order.
D'ARTAGNAN
Saddle my horse!
The grooms jump to work; several young Musketeers nearby stop
their training, noticing their Captain's agitation.
D'ARTAGNAN
Hurry --
But then d'Artagnan sees Athos coming, riding furiously
through the Musketeers' gate.
D'Artagnan steps out to meet
him as Athos reins in his horse and jumps from the saddle.
D'ARTAGNAN
Athos, my friend --
Athos marches to the palace door; d'Artagnan cuts him off.
D'ARTAGNAN
Athos, please...!
ATHOS
Get out of my way.
D'ARTAGNAN
(grabbing him)
Athos, I beg you --
Athos punches d'Artagnan with furious strength, knocking him
aside.
The young Musketeers reach for their weapons, but
d'Artagnan is up quickly, throwing himself in front of Athos
again, blocking the doorway into the palace.
D'ARTAGNAN
Where are you going?
ATHOS
To kill the king.
At this, the swords of the young Musketeers sing from their
scabbards.
Athos wears a sword, but he has not drawn it.
D'ARTAGNAN
Athos!
I know life means nothing to
you at this moment, but I will not
let you kill yourself.
ATHOS
The King killed my son!
D'ARTAGNAN
The cannons killed Raoul!
The
cannons, and love.
But not the King.
A YOUNG MUSKETEER steps up.
YOUNG MUSKETEER
I'll kill the old man for you,
Captain, if you don't wish to --
Athos spins, striking like a rattlesnake, his sword whipping
from its scabbard and slicing off the arrogant young
Musketeer's ear.
He flicks another's sword from his grasp,
then brings the the point of his own blade up beneath the
chin of a third, shoving him back.
ATHOS
Come on!
All of you!
D'Artagnan tackles Athos from behind and pins him face down
to the hay.
For a moment Athos bellows in rage --
ATHOS
Coward!
Fight me!
Fight me...!
Emotion spills up into Athos' throat, and he begins to sob.
ATHOS
He killed my son, d'Artagnan!
He
killed my son...!
D'Artagnan, dying inside, still grips Athos.
Athos grows
quiet, and the young Musketeers drift closer.
D'ARTAGNAN
Get back, all of you!
D'Artagnan stands, and Athos rises, still holding his sword.
He looks at d'Artagnan a long beat, then sheathes his sword
and turns to his horse.
The young soldiers move to him.
D'ARTAGNAN
Let him go!
Athos mounts his horse, and with a last glance back at
d'Artagnan, he gallops away.
NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY
The great cathedral rises next to the monastery where Aramis
resides.
We PAN DOWN and PUSH IN on the cobblestones between
the two structures, as if penetrating to --
SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGES
Aramis leads Porthos through tunnels, twisting, descending.
PORTHOS
Aramis... is this the way to hell?
ARAMIS
Hell may be our destination, dear
Porthos, but not this trip.
They reach an iron door and move through it, into
A GORGEOUS, SECRET CHAPEL
Candles illuminate masterpiece frescoes.
The place is
breathtaking.
PORTHOS
Where are we?
ARAMIS
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy
among the profane.
If we are to
have a place of private prayer,
where better than here, beside the
channels where the shit and the
garbage run to the river?
Porthos notices niches in the walls; he looks closely and
sees the face of a corpse, enclosed behind glass.
PORTHOS
Mother of God!
ARAMIS
It is also a place of burial.
PORTHOS
A tomb?
We're in a tomb?
ARAMIS
Catacombs.
Very holy.
Porthos looks as if the bodies could resurrect at any moment
-- then jumps out of his skin as the door opens.
PORTHOS
Yaaaahhh!
A hooded figure, looking like the Grim Reaper, enters.
ARAMIS
Relax, you big fool, it's
d'Artagnan.
And sure enough the hooded figure, whom we now see has been
led in by a little monk, is d'Artagnan.
Aramis nods to the
monk, who leaves quickly.
Before d'Artagnan can ask
anything, Porthos jumps again; the back door has opened, and
monks usher in Athos, who freezes as he sees d'Artagnan.
ARAMIS
It's all right.
D'Artagnan was the
one who warned us that he'd been
given an order for your arrest.
Here you have sanctuary -- does he
not, d'Artagnan?
The escort monks disappear, closing the chapel door so that
the four Musketeers are left to sit at a small table the
monks have set up, Athos and D'Artagnan opposite each other.
ARAMIS
Look at us.
We are old men now.
But
once we were young.
And when we saw
injustice, we fought it.
D'ARTAGNAN
We have grown wiser with age.
Now
we know that some problems cannot be
settled with a sword.
ATHOS
And some problems cannot be settled
without one.
ARAMIS
Well here is the problem at hand:
the King has ordered me to discover
the identity of the Governor General
of Jesuits, and kill him.
As our
English rivals have left the
Catholic Church, Louis has struck on
a plan to dominate the whole of
Europe by uniting Church and State
and making himself head of both.
He
has already picked the Pope.
Only
the Jesuits, who put God above
throne or papacy, stand in his way.
PORTHOS
But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope
and King?
ARAMIS
So they tell us.
But what are we to
believe when the king is a tyrant,
and the Church, meant to stand for
all those oppressed, has become the
tool of oppression?
When no
conscience is tolerated?
No
dissent, no objection?
PORTHOS
It is a weighty problem, Aramis --
but perhaps you should leave it to
this secret General of the Jesuits,
whoever he might be.
ARAMIS
Easy to say, but hard to do.
For
what I am trying to tell you is that
I am the Governor General of Jesuits
in France.
A stunned silence.
ATHOS
What do you propose to do?
ARAMIS
Replace the king.
D'ARTAGNAN
I cannot hear this!
PORTHOS
It can't be done.
ARAMIS
It can.
I know the way.
ATHOS
I am with you!
D'ARTAGNAN
No!
Stop --
ARAMIS
I will need you all.
All for one.
One for all.
D'ARTAGNAN
(jumping up)
You -- You cannot ask me to betray
my king!
I have sworn to him!
ATHOS
It is honor you serve, and when the
king is dishonorable you are removed
from your oath of honor!
D'ARTAGNAN
An oath is an oath precisely because
it cannot be removed!
ATHOS
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?!
I know you have put service above
your own life, but why does this
King deserve such loyalty?
He is a
monster!
He executes ministers for
his own blunders, with their
families hostage so they take the
blame!
He has no honor!
D'ARTAGNAN
No man is all bad... or all good.
I
believe -- I must believe -- that
Louis can learn.
And perhaps I can
help him.
Athos leaps up from the table, and glares at d'Artagnan.
ATHOS
Whatever the plan... I am in it!
The next time we meet, one of us
will die.
He storms out of the rear door of the chapel.
ARAMIS
Porthos, see to Athos, won't you?
Porthos follows Athos; Aramis and d'Artagnan are left alone.
ARAMIS
I have heard many confessions,
d'Artagnan.
But even if I were not
a priest, I could tell your heart
has a secret weight, and it is
hurting you to carry it alone.
D'ARTAGNAN
The secret I carry I cannot share.
Not even with God.
D'Artagnan moves to the door.
D'ARTAGNAN
I cannot betray Louis.
I will
defend him with my life.
ARAMIS
I know.
God go with you.
D'Artagnan leaves Aramis alone in the secret chapel.
THE MONASTERY - NIGHT
Aramis leads Athos and Porthos out of the catacombs.
ARAMIS
This way.
They move into a moonlit courtyard of the monastery.
A
hooded Jesuit standing guard steps from the shadows, then
recognizes Aramis and admits the trio to the monastery's
forge, where more hooded Jesuits are working in secret,
heating iron red hot in the bellows furnace.
ATHOS
What are they doing?
ARAMIS
Making the key to the throne.
PORTHOS
They are very large keys.
One of the blacksmiths uses tongs to remove something red
from the fire; he hammers it in a shower of sparks and
plunges it into water.
Aramis pulls the result from the
water and shows it to Athos and Porthos.
It is an iron mask.
A CARRIAGE - FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT
The carriage rolls through the long sweep of the French
countryside, traveling fast.
FRENCH COAST - NIGHT
Lying just off the coast is the forbidden island, where the
imposing fortress prison rises on the promontory off shore.
ATHOS
The Prison of Belle Sur.
ARAMIS
Come, we have a boat waiting.
As hooded Jesuits appear from the shadows to guide them,
Athos and Porthos glance at each other; Porthos shrugs.
AMONG ROCKS AT THE BEACH - NIGHT
The guides lead the Musketeers down a hilly path to a long
boat, hidden among the large rocks that dot the coast.
Sitting next to the boat is a scrawny little man in priest's
garb; at his feet is a long narrow bundle, about the size of
a mummy, with a rope tied at either end.
The guides drag the boat across the sand into the surf.
Aramis throws off his cape, and strips down almost naked.
He's still fit and hard.
With the guides helping him, he
lifts the bundle by its ropes and ties it around his waist.
ATHOS
What is that?
ARAMIS
A body.
ATHOS
I see that is a body!
But where did
you get it?
Aramis ignores the question, and the guides dress him in
priest's garb.
With the robes spreading over the big bundle
added artfully to Aramis' waist, it appears he is a very fat
priest; the wig and false beard the assistants give him adds
to the illusion of Aramis as a wild, reclusive monk.
The sun is beginning to come up over the mountains.
PORTHOS
He gets one day of confession each
year.
Today is the day.
ATHOS
Who does?
PORTHOS
Best not to ask.
Shouldn't even
talk about it.
Aramis steps onto the boat.
The little priest who first
joined them gets in too, along with a couple of rowers.
ATHOS
What do we do now?
PORTHOS
I don't know about you, but I plan
to wait here.
The rowers pull the boat toward the fortress prison.
PRISON - DAY
Aramis climbs into the boat; as he sits down his belly stirs,
but the guards don't see it -- they are using poles to push
the boat away, into the sea.
THE COASTLINE - DAY
Athos and Porthos stand as the boat reaches the shore, and
tucks in among the rocks.
Sheltered from the view from the
prison, Aramis steps from the boat and removes his robes.
The prisoner dangles, tied wrist and ankle, from around
Aramis' neck.
ATHOS
My God...
Athos, Porthos, and the others gawk at the sight of the Man
in the Iron Mask, as Aramis loosens the ropes.
As they back
away from him, he sees the sky.
Endless blue -- and bright.
He shields his eyes.
ARAMIS
It's all right.
Take your time.
Aramis helps him up, and turn him slowly around, to face...
The fortress/prison, in the distance.
THE PRISONER'S POV FROM WITHIN THE MASK:
A vast vista -- the
sky, the sea, and the prison on the island in the middle of
it all.
The prisoner falls to his knees, and weeps.
ARAMIS
Athos... He needs a gentle hand.
Athos moves over hesitantly, and puts his hand on the
shoulder of the Man in the Iron Mask, who holds his hands
against the mask as if to further hide his shame.
PRISON - DAY
The prison's WARDEN GENERAL stands at the wall of the
fortress high above the sea and watches as his guards throw
off the body, wrapped in canvas weighted with stones.
As the
corpse makes a long fall and crashes into the sea, the Warden
writes a message on a royal scroll:
THE UNSEEN PRISONER IS DEAD.
The Warden seals the scroll and hands it to a messenger.
COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT
A carriage pulls into a country estate, isolated among vast
woodlands silver in the moonlight.
Mysterious servants with
shielded lanterns converge on the carriage as it stops.
MANOR HOUSE COURTYARD - NIGHT
Aramis emerges quickly, whispering directives to the Jesuits;
Athos helps the Man in the Iron Mask from the carriage, his
head shrouded by a cloak.
Aramis has a blacksmith waiting; almost before he realizes it
the Man in the Iron Mask finds his head placed on an anvil;
but as the hammer rises he begins to scream.
MAN IN THE IRON MASK
No!
Please!
ARAMIS
What is wrong?
We only mean to free
you from the mask!
But the prisoner is shaking, and Athos understands why.
ATHOS
Prison was horrible but it was his
home.
He's been torn from it by
strangers.
He's frightened,
exhausted -- and the mask is
familiar.
Let him rest in it
tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
ARAMIS
Excellent, Athos.
You have a keen
sense of this man.
ATHOS
His plight is obvious, isn't it?
Athos, angry with Aramis' arrogance and insensitivity, leads
the Man in the Iron Mask toward the house; then Aramis spots
Porthos, looking downcast.
ARAMIS
And why are you so glum?
PORTHOS
I expected action.
There was no
killing, no fighting, I was useless.
In deep depression, Porthos climbs out and shuffles off.
Aramis sighs, shakes his head, and walks to the house.
MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT
Aramis and Athos rush through the courtyard, surrounded by
moonlight and trees, confused about where Porthos is.
Then
they hear bellowing SCREAM OF PAIN from the latrine.
Swords drawn, they bang into the latrine, to find Porthos
just finishing urinating.
PORTHOS
Kidney rocks.
It hurts when I pee.
It hurts when I shit.
I'm just a
fat old fart with nothing to live
for any more.
I'm going to hang
myself, as soon as I'm sober.
They watch him shuffle toward the main house.
PALACE GARDEN - NIGHT
Anne rushes through the evening, toward her little chapel in
the palace garden; she is a tragic, romantic sight, her long
hair flying behind her as she runs.
IN HIS ROOM, D'ARTAGNAN
has been standing at his window, for his nightly glimpse of
Anne.
Now he sees her, not with her retinue of nuns, but
running to her chapel, clearly distraught...
PALACE GARDEN - GARDEN CHAPEL - NIGHT
Anne reaches the door, and finds a few nuns and an old priest
praying in the little chapel.
She staggers forward to the
altar.
and falls to her knees there.
The nuns and the old
priest, seeing the Queen Mother so distraught, stand silently
and file out, leaving her in solitude.
ANNE
Oh God I -- Forgive me...
D'ARTAGNAN
M'lady...?
She whirls to see him; the sight of her face, bursting with
emotions she has kept buried, draws him nearer.
D'ARTAGNAN
What -- ?
ANNE
No, stay back!
Stay back!
He freezes in his tracks; she holds her hands out toward him
as if warding off a blow.
He's desperate to move to her; she
sees it on his face.
ANNE
D'Artagnan!
Her emotions break all her resolve to keep him away; she
rushes into his arms.
They clutch each other, in an embrace
they have denied for many years.
They kiss hungrily.
D'ARTAGNAN
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is
death...
ANNE
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
D'ARTAGNAN
I can't bear to see you cry.
What
is wrong?
ANNE
Nothing... Nothing.
She draws back; he tries to hold her.
But the thoughts of
answering that question makes her stiffen.
ANNE
Nothing.
This... didn't happen.
I
must go back now.
And just like that, their moment is gone.
GARDEN - NIGHT
D'Artagnan and Anne move back to the palace in a stiff
procession, she walking ahead, he trailing like a proper
commoner, several feet behind.
GARDENS - OUTSIDE THE KING'S WINDOW - NIGHT
The apparition ducks into the shadows.
GARDEN - OUTSIDE THE KING'S WINDOW - NIGHT
An old Jesuit priest slips back into the garden chapel where
the nuns have returned to pray.
He kneels at a back pew,
tucking the iron mask deep within his robes.
The young
Musketeers who move through the garden glance into the
chapel, see only the normal piety, and move on.
The old
priest crosses himself, bows his head, and smiles.
CUT TO:
CLOSE - PHILLIPPE'S EYES, THROUGH THE SLITS OF THE MASK
They are frightened.
As we PULL BACK we see the Iron Mask,
in an OVERHEAD POV... Phillippe is lying on his back, his
head resting on an anvil.
Athos stands close by, lending
support; Aramis and Porthos look on.
A blacksmith stands
over Phillippe.
He positions the point of his chisel against
the lock of the mask.
It takes several ringing hammer blows
-- which we experience from a POV WITHIN THE MASK -- before
the lock breaks.
Athos, as gently as he can, pries open the iron mask.
PHILLIPPE'S FACE
is a wretched sight, overgrown with a matted tangle of hair
and beard, and with a deathly pallor.
Phillippe sits up, lifting his head out of the mask.
He
looks at the Musketeers, watching them for their reactions.
At first they are frozen; then there is recognition, awe.
Phillippe sees a cooling bucket beside the forge, and looks
down into THE SURFACE OF THE WATER, at his REFLECTION.
PORTHOS
Aramis!
Athos!
He looks exactly
like... exactly like...
ARAMIS
I will answer all your questions.
But first soap, water, and a razor.
MANOR HOUSE GARDENS - DAY
The gardens are sun drenched, bursting with the beauty of a
French summer.
Athos finds Phillippe there, sitting alone.
ATHOS
Recent hours have been a shock.
PHILLIPPE
Perhaps not as much as you might
imagine.
When tutors answered every
question except those about who I
was.
When I was imprisoned in a way
no other man had ever been, I knew
there was something different about
me.
But a king...
ATHOS
Phillippe... there is something I
hope you understand.
Terrible
cruelty has been used against you.
And... you must understand that you
did nothing to deserve it.
PHILLIPPE
There is... wrath... in me.
I have
learned to hide it.
Those years in
the cell, I dreamed that freedom
would someday just happen, the way
the mask happened.
Now I am free.
And with each free breath I feel the
growing desire to make someone
suffer for all I lost.
Look at
this, all this that for ten years I
could not see!
What if I become a
king -- a king no different from my
brother?
ATHOS
The desire for vengeance... can be a
poison.
PHILLIPPE
What is its antidote?
ATHOS
I suppose... it is to remember there
are many people who have never been
in a prison, who pass such beauty
every day, and never see it.
Phillippe reaches to a flower, plucks it, and smells it.
He
looks around at the beauty of the garden, taking it all in.
Athos looks around too; then Athos realizes Phillippe is no
longer looking at the garden, but at him.
PHILLIPPE
You look so sad.
Is it something I
have done?
ATHOS
It is something I have done -- or
did not do.
PHILLIPPE
What is that?
ATHOS
I did not share beauty with
someone... who is no longer here for
me to share beauty with.
Before Phillippe can pursue this, Athos turns businesslike.
ATHOS
We have much to do, we'd best get
started.
Now suppose you were to
walk into a garden, as a king...
CHATEAU - NIGHT
As Aramis and Athos are downstairs arguing, we PAN UP to the
window of a candlelit bedroom...
CHATEAU - NIGHT
While Aramis and Athos are visible through the window,
arguing and gesturing, Porthos -- still naked -- walks across
the moonlit courtyard, to the barn.
CHATEAU - MORNING
Aramis and Porthos are already loaded into the carriage, as
Athos runs up.
ATHOS
Where are you going?!
ARAMIS
Paris.
There is still much to do.
We'll be back soon.
Be ready.
ATHOS
But Aramis -- !
Phillippe can learn
in time, but --
ARAMIS
He can learn to be Phillippe in
time.
But first he must learn to be
Louis, and for that he has two more
days.
ATHOS
What you're asking is impossible!
ARAMIS
I offer you the perfect revolution.
A revolution without bloodshed,
without any loss of life, even
without treason, for he too is the
son of the King.
ATHOS
But --
ARAMIS
You said you'd do anything, Athos,
anything to replace this King.
So
do it.
Aramis motions to the driver, who snaps the reins and drives
the horses away.
Athos, wide-eyed and alone, watches the carriage roll away.
He turns back toward the house, and see's Phillippe looking
out the window -- without the mask.
PARIS STREET - NIGHT
Aramis' carriage rattles to a stop, the hooves of the horses
sounding hollow on the cobblestones.
They are near the same
area where the riots occurred; now, at night, everything
looks deserted.
Aramis steps from the carriage.
ARAMIS
Coming?
PORTHOS
What use am I?
ARAMIS
We go someplace dangerous.
PORTHOS
Why didn't you say so?
Porthos steps out with him, and Aramis leads the way down a
dark, spooky alley.
PARIS BACKSTREETS - NIGHT
They walk through the murky darkness of Paris' backstreets.
PORTHOS
It is good to be out on a mission
again... We are out on a mission,
aren't we?
Aramis grunts non-committally, lost in thought.
PORTHOS
You're right.
Tell Porthos nothing.
He needs to know nothing, for he is
useless.
Just as he says this a sinister form steps from the shadows
and blocks their way.
He holds a knife.
Another ROBBER with
a sword rises from a doorway beside them.
ROBBER
Your money or your life.
Aramis looks bored; Porthos stands blinking in surprise.
Then a third robber steps up behind them, cocking a pistol.
THIRD ROBBER
Make it quick, old man!
PORTHOS
Old?
Old?!
You're all trying to
rob us because you think we're old?
The man with a sword steps forward to hack Porthos down, but
Porthos spins, slapping the pistol, making it BOOM but miss;
he kicks the swordsman in the groin, then smashes his head
against the alley wall; he backhands the gunman.
The robber
with the knife tries to run; Porthos snatches a barrel from
the street and hurls it into the fleeing robber's back; he
falls in a heap.
Porthos' fury has just begun.
He picks the fallen gunman up
by the throat, slams him stomach down across a broken alley
cart, and with one sweep of his mighty hand Porthos snatches
down the man's pants.
PORTHOS
Old?!
I'll show you old!!
Porthos snatches the pistol from the cobblestones.
We see
the shock and terror on the robber's face as he feels
something shocking happen behind him.
PORTHOS
Let's see you rob somebody with your
pistol there!
ARAMIS
Come on...
Aramis, acting as if nothing happened, leads Porthos away.
PORTHOS
I have to tell you something.
I
love Paris!
Aramis has found what he's looking for:
a filthy brothel.
ARAMIS
Here we are.
Aramis leads Porthos inside.
STREETS OF PARIS - NIGHT
Aramis' carriage rattles through the dark streets; we play
these secret movement sequences with an ominous, Jack-the-
Ripper quality.
The carriage pulls into...
ROADS - NIGHT
The carriage thunders through the countryside, back toward
the manor house.
MANOR HOUSE - DAY
Athos and Phillippe sit at a table in the shade of a tree; on
the table is a model of the palace which Athos is using to
drill Phillippe on the palace's layout.
ATHOS
These rooms are yours.
Up these
stairs -- or through this hidden
passage -- is the room of your
mistress... Michelle.
PHILLIPPE
Whose rooms are those?
ATHOS
Your mother's.
They are interrupted as the carriage bearing Aramis and
Porthos clatters in.
Aramis is out immediately.
ARAMIS
Change the horses!
Clear out
everything!
NOW!!
PALACE - DAY
Teams of servants are filing in and out of the palace with
food and flowers, decorating the ballroom for the ball that
evening.
In contrast, Anne and her devout retinue of nuns
move in single file toward the garden chapel.
ROAD - NIGHT
Aramis' carriage pulls off the road and into the trees.
The
Musketeers and Phillippe pile out, to find another much
grander carriage there waiting.
Aramis ushers them into it.
PHILLIPPE
Whose carriage is this?
PORTHOS
It was mine.
But since you are
about to be the king, it is yours.
The new carriage lurches away.
INSIDE THE NEW CARRIAGE
are bundles of elaborate clothes.
ARAMIS
Phillippe first.
They begin to dress Phillippe in a masquerade costume.
ARAMIS
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is
born in the heart.
ATHOS
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
PORTHOS
And make love as if you don't care.
The way Kings do.
And fart whenever
you wish.
Aramis tucks a note into Phillippe's pocket.
ARAMIS
Remember, all you have to do is get
through tonight.
Smile and nod a
lot, and if you get stuck just wave
and announce, "Continue."
In the
morning you hand this note to
d'Artagnan, pardoning Athos and
instructing that he, Aramis and
Porthos be brought to the palace as
your advisors.
And all is well.
Phillippe nods; everyone's nervous.
Aramis grabs more
clothes and hands them out.
ARAMIS
Now the rest of us.
THE PALACE - NIGHT
Carriages disgorge guests, wildly attired for the masquerade
ball.
Porthos' carriage pulls in among them.
ESTABLISHING THE BASTILLE - NIGHT
A sudden visual, establishing the Bastille, the horrific
legendary prison of Paris.
PARIS STREETS - NIGHT
Squads of young Musketeers gallop along the river, and
through the dark streets around it, searching...
ALONG THE BACK WALL OF NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL, three forms
scurry through the darkness:
Aramis, Porthos and Athos,
heaving, wheezing.
They duck into a niche of the wall to
avoid capture from another patrol galloping by.
Then Aramis
unlocks a door in the cathedral wall and they stagger in.
BASTILLE - NIGHT
The stone walls rising into the Paris night seem to ooze
evil.
The building looks impossible to get into, much less
get out of; its doors appear to be solid blocks of wood,
encased in stone ramparts.
We hear a sharp, echoing KNOCK; Aramis, Athos, and Porthos
stand outside the main entrance, Athos slumped between the
other two like a beaten captive being delivered to jail.
No one answers their knock; the three Musketeers exchange
doubtful glance, and Porthos knocks again.
A guard inside
slides open a view port of the massive door.
PORTHOS
Open up!
We have a prisoner!
The port shuts, bolts rattle, and the great door heaves open.
The Musketeers glance at each other again, and play their
roles, Aramis and Porthos dragging Athos inside.
PALACE GARDEN - NIGHT
D'Artagnan rides away quickly, passing -- without seeing --
Lieutenant Andre, who has been watching him.
PARIS STREETS - NIGHT
Through the night d'Artagnan gallops.
We see his destination
in the distance:
the Bastille.
THE PALACE GATES - NIGHT
The great gates of the palace swing slowly open, and out ride
a whole platoon of young Musketeers, surrounding Louis
himself, on horseback and dressed like a soldier.
PARIS STREETS - NIGHT
Louis and his platoon of young Musketeers ride through the
streets, scattering the paupers who sleep there.
LANE OF ELMS - BESIDE THE PALACE - DAY
At the end of a lane of elms, where the markers of king's
graves stand clustered, royal workmen place a mighty marble
monument stone above the final resting place of d'Artagnan.
Athos, Aramis, Porthos, and the King -- Phillippe, known as
King Louis now -- stand gathered there, as Aramis in his
priest's garments utters the funeral incantations.
Aramis'
voice breaks as he does so.
Porthos' eyes pour out rivers of
tears.
Athos' grief is beyond weeping.
Phillippe holds the arm of his mother.
She holds the rose
d'Artagnan left her.
ARAMIS
Amen.
Athos moves up between Aramis and Porthos, and links them
with his arms.
ATHOS
He was the best of us all.
Aramis and Porthos move off together, to walk the lane of
elms; Athos remains by the grave, unable to leave.
Phillippe pats Anne's arm.
PHILLIPPE
I will be with you in a moment,
Mother.
She too moves down the lane of trees, touching the tip of the
rose pedals to her lips as the tears run down her face.
Phillippe moves up to Athos.
PHILLIPPE
After all you have done, I must ask
you one more service to your king.
I have lost my father.
And you have
lost your son.
Let me love you like
a son to a father.
And I pray you
live for this, to love me like your
son.
Athos can't speak; he can only nod yes.
Phillippe moves to
join his mother, leaving Athos to take one final look down at
the grave.
Then as Athos moves off to join Aramis and
Porthos, we PAN from the name "D'ARTAGNAN" on the stone, to
the pattern chiseled beneath the name.
It is a mask, of iron.
FADE OUT.
