      An old beat up van is parked in an abandoned lot.  A motley
      group of ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS walk by on their way to
      school.  One of them throws a rock at the van.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      We hear kicking against the inside of the van for a beat and
      then the door opens.  On the sidewalk in front of the
      abandoned lot we see a cute woman in her early twenties,
      SABRINA, waiting for the bus in her IHOP waitress uniform. 
      She hears the noise and looks over.  Jimmy gets out the van,
      turns and tries to close the door with his feet.  Eventually
      he succeeds.  As Jimmy crosses to the sidewalk he notices
      Sabrina and makes his way over to her.  

                                      JIMMY
                    Hi.

                                      SABRINIA
                          (beat)
                    Hello.  Why do you have bottles taped
                    to your hands?

                                      JIMMY
                    I'm not sure.  I'm actually heading
                    to work and I'm hoping a guy there
                    can answer that question.

      The bus pulls up. 

                                      SABRINA
                    Good luck.

      She starts to get on the bus.                                                                                          2



                                      JIMMY
                    Hey, uh... what's your name?

                                      SABRINA
                    You just crawled out of a van and
                    you don't know why you have bottles
                    taped to your hands.  I'm not going
                    to tell you my name.

      Sabrina gets on the bus.

                                      JIMMY
                    I can't argue with that.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jimmy approaches MIKE who putting supplies in the back of a
      truck that reads, "Pool Cleaning By Chance".  Mike, an unkempt
      fairly oblivious guy in his early twenties, spots him.

                                    MIKE
                    Jimmy, where you been?  I bought you
                      a breakfast taquito but I ate it,
                    like, two houses ago.  There's still
                    half a Yoo Hoo and some circus peanuts
                    in the truck if you're hungry.

                                      JIMMY
                    Why do I have bottles taped to my
                    hands?

                                    MIKE
                    You don't remember?  It was hilarious. 
                    I also put make-up on you.  I had
                    you telling everyone at the bar you
                    were Edward Forty Hands. 

      Mike takes out an iPhone and shows it to Jimmy.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    Check it out.

      Mike plays a video of Jimmy drunk, wearing white make-up,
      mascara and black lipstick and drinking from the bottles
      taped to his hands.

                                      JIMMY
                    How did I get the make-up off my
                    face?

                                    MIKE
                    Wait for it.                                                                                          3



      On the video we see Jimmy passed out as a big dog licks his
      face and mouth.

                                      JIMMY
                    Gross.  
                          (then)
                    Where did you get an apple phone?

                                    MIKE
                    Found it.  People keep calling and
                    asking for Derek.

      BURT CHANCE, a man in his early forties, comes out of the
      backyard carrying a pool skimmer. 

                                    BURT
                    Go home, Jimmy.

                                      JIMMY
                    Why?

                                    BURT
                    You're fired.  Third time this week
                    you're late and it's only Wednesday. 
                    Your drinking is becoming a problem.

                                      JIMMY
                    What are you talking about?  You
                    were drinking with me.  You made me
                    have a chugging contest with you.
                          (re: Mike)
                    He was drinking too.  He taped bottles
                    to my hands.

                                    BURT
                    But we made it to work on time, Jimmy. 
                    We can handle ourselves.

                                      JIMMY
                    So you're firing me because I'm not
                    as good of a functioning alcoholic
                    as you?

                                    BURT
                    Hey, watch the name calling.  You're
                    not an alcoholic if you can get to
                    work on time.  

      Burt gets in the truck.  Mike's iPhone rings.

                                    MIKE
                          (into phone)
                    Hello.  
                          (beat)
                    No he is not, can I take a message?                                                                                          4



      Mike gets in the truck and they drive off.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      A little pink car that has "Merry Maids" on the side is
      sitting in front of a crappy little house.  There are two
      Latina women in maids' uniforms in the front seat and one in
      the back.  Jimmy walks up the sidewalk behind them, bottles
      still on his hands.  The maid behind the wheel lays on the
      horn like it wasn't the first time.  Jimmy's forty-one-year-
      old mother, VIRGINIA, exits the house through the screen
      door.  She's wearing a maid's uniform and smoking.    

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (to herself)
                    Keep your skirt on.

                                      JIMMY
                    Hey, Mom.

      Jimmy walks past Virginia and towards the house.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    What are you doing home?

                                      JIMMY
                    I got fired.

                                      VIRGINIA
                          (disgusted)
                      Unbelievable.  
                          (then)
                    Don't touch the TV.  I got the VCR
                    Plus set to record "Family Feud."  

      Virginia gets in the back seat of the car.  She rolls down
      the window so she can smoke.

                                      VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
                    What the devil are you ladies in
                    such a hurry for?  You know we're
                    going to scrub toilets, right?  

      She takes a drag and blows it out the window.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jimmy pulls into his yard and parks. 

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jimmy opens the door, comes out and looks around confused.

                                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                        10




      Lucy is inside the cage doing deep knee bends.  Jimmy watches.

                                    LUCY
                    I don't expect anything from you.  I
                    just wanted you to know you were
                    gonna be a dad.  I thought that was
                    the right thing to do.  I may have
                    killed a couple old boyfriends but
                    I'm not a monster.                                                                                        15



      Lucy starts to do lunges and Jimmy walks with her long the
      outside of the cage.  He moves up and down as she does. 

                                      JIMMY
                    Well, I appreciate you not expecting
                    anything from me.  Not that I don't
                    want to have a baby one day.  I do. 
                    But not until I get a record deal. 
                    I play the guitar.  I've written a
                    bunch of songs but I can't seem to
                    master playing and singing at the
                    same time.  It's actually harder
                    than it looks.  It's like rubbing
                    your stomach and patting your head. 
                    Anyway, point is, I'm not ready for
                    a baby right now.

                                    LUCY
                    Tell me about it.  If I was on the
                    outside I'd be screwed.  Luckily
                    women have babies in here all the
                    time.  They got a nursery, cribs,
                      clothes... Prison babies got it made.  

      Lucy gets up and steps closer to Jimmy.

                                    LUCY (CONT'D)
                    And you know what the best part of
                    it is?  I'm supposed to get the
                    electric chair in eleven months. 
                    But that was before they knew I was
                    pregnant.
                          (smiles)
                    No way they're killing a mother of a
                      eight-month-old baby.

      Jimmy walks down the street with a shopping cart and holding
      a brown paper bag.  In the cart and on the bottom rack is
      his acoustic guitar, his microwave, his Nintendo, his stereo
      and some other items.  Also in the shopping cart, lying on
      some blankets is Princess Beyonce.  He spots the cute
      waitress, Sabrina, at the bus stop and stops.  

                                      JIMMY
                    Hi.

                                      SABRINA
                          (thrown)
                    Hello.

      Sabrina looks into the shopping cart and sees Princess
      Beyonce.  She's concerned.

                                      SABRINA (CONT'D)
                    Why is there a baby in your shopping
                    cart?

                                      JIMMY
                    I can't hold her and push it at the
                    same time.

                                      SABRINA
                    Are you homeless?  

                                      JIMMY
                    No.

                                      SABRINA
                    Whose baby is that?

                                      JIMMY
                    It's mine.  I just don't have a
                    regular baby pusher thing yet because
                    I just got her a few hours ago.

                                      SABRINA
                          (not convinced)
                    Okay.

      Princess Beyonce starts to cry.  Jimmy reaches in the paper
      bag and takes out a yellow rubber glove filled with milk. 
      He puts it in Princess Beyonce's mouth and she sucks on it.                                                                                        22



                                      JIMMY
                    I don't have a bottle yet.  It's a
                    clean glove.  Right out of the
                    package.

      Sabrina just stares.

                          (beat)
                    It was a drinking prank, by the way.

                                      SABRINA
                    Excuse me?

                                      JIMMY
                    The bottles I had taped to my hands. 
                    It was a... it was about a year or
                    so ago... you were at this bus stop
                    right here... 
                          (re: vacant lot)
                    I got out of a... 
                          (realizing)
                    you don't remember.

                                      SABRINA
                    No.

      The bus pulls up.  

                                      SABRINA (CONT'D)
                    Just promise me that's your baby.

                                      JIMMY
                      I promise.

      As Sabrina backs onto the bus she takes a picture of Jimmy
      with her phone in case he's a kidnapper.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jimmy is sitting on the curb with a bunch of used baby stuff. 
      He's reading a copy of "What to Expect In The First Year."
      Princess Beyonce is in the stroller playing with a toy, which
      she drops.  Jimmy gives it back to her and she smiles.  He
      smiles back.  Virginia pulls up in a 1964 Dodge Dart.  

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Burt is cleaning a pool.  Mike is mixing and pouring chemicals
      in the pool.  Jimmy enters pushing Princess Beyonce in a
      stroller and carrying the car seat.

                                    BURT 
                    You're late.

                                      JIMMY
                    I hit a few snags.

      Jimmy puts the car seat down and pulls the shade over the
      stroller to protect Princess Beyonce from the sun.

                                    BURT
                    Well, grab a skimmer and start getting
                    these leaves out of here.

      He does. 

                                    MIKE
                    Hey, Jimmy.  You ever worry that
                    thing is gonna grow up to be like
                    her mother?  All crazy.  Murdering
                    people and junk.

                                      JIMMY
                    No, I don't worry about that.

      As they talk Jimmy fishes leaves out of the pool with the
      skimmer; a net on a long metal pole.  Unbeknownst to Jimmy,
      the other end of the pole pokes into the inside of the
      stroller.  From inside the stroller we can see that it just
      misses Princess Beyonce's head before he pulls it back out.

                                    MIKE
                    I'd worry about that.  I'd worry
                    about that a lot.  Like, every time
                    I looked at her.  Which, actually,
                    is what I do.  

      Jimmy pulls more leaves out of the pool. The back of the
      pole enters the stroller and just misses Princess Beyonce's
      head on the other side.

                                      JIMMY
                    That's because you think too much,
                    Mike.  It makes you crazy.                                                                                        28



                                    MIKE
                    Thinking too much doesn't make you
                    crazy.  Crazy is a hermetitary thing.  

      Jimmy pulls more leaves from the pool and the back of the
      pole enters the stroller.  This time Princess Beyonce grabs
      it.  Jimmy walks down the side of the pool not knowing that
      he's pulling the stroller towards the pool as he goes.  

                                      JIMMY
                    Maybe she'll be smart.  Her mom might
                    be crazy but she's also smart.  Maybe
                    she'll get none of the crazy and all
                    of the smart.  Her little brain could
                    be working on the cure cancer for
                    all we know.

      As he walks down the side of the pool the stroller goes into
      the pool.  Jimmy turns, see this and dives into the pool.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Jimmy sits on the porch.  Virginia comes out and sits down
      as well.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    She's asleep.

                                      JIMMY
                    Thanks.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You ready to admit you're not cut
                    out for this?  

                                      JIMMY
                    It was the first day.  I'm not
                    dropping her off at the fire station
                    after one day.  What makes you so
                    sure someone else can do better than
                    me anyway?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Jimmy, you almost killed it twice
                    and we both threw up on it.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        35



                                      VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
                    I'm not sure that baby wouldn't be
                    better off being raised by a rabid
                    pack of pedophile meth-heads.

      Burt comes out of the house with two mugs of coffee.  He
      gives one to Virginia.

                                      JIMMY
                    If giving away your baby is such a
                    good idea, why didn't you guys do it
                    when you had me?  You didn't know
                    what you were doing.  Why did you
                    keep me?

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Because we were stupid.  And selfish. 
                    We should have given you away.  You
                    probably would have had a better
                    life.  

                                    BURT
                    Probably would have graduated high
                    school.  Gone to college.  

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Maybe you'd even be able to eat fruit.

      They sit for a beat.

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah, well, I like my life.  And
                    fruit's overrated anyway.  It's mostly
                    sugar.  That's what the baby book
                    says.  Vegetables.  That's what you're
                    supposed to eat. 

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Ugh.  I don't eat nothing that comes
                    out of the ground.  That's just dirty.

      They sit for a bet.

                                      JIMMY
                    I can't do this without you guys.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    It's not that we don't want to help
                    you, Jimmy.  We can't.  We don't
                    know what we're doing either.

                                      JIMMY
                    It sure looked like you knew what
                    you were doing in there.                                                                                        36



                                      VIRGINIA
                    We sang a song.  Anyone can sing a
                    song.  Charles Manson can sing a
                    song. 

                                    BURT
                    He's actually pretty darn good. 
                    Mike has his album. 

                                      VIRGINIA
                    He is good.  But that doesn't mean
                    you want him helping you raise your
                    child.  
                          (then)
                    Jimmy, what is it with this baby? 
                    Are you afraid people are gonna look
                    at you differently if you give it
                    away?  No one's gonna look at you
                    any differently.  No one expects you
                    to take care of it.

                                      JIMMY
                    That's the problem, Mom.  I want
                    people to look at me differently. 
                    I'm sick of people looking at me
                    like I don't have a purpose.  I want
                    people to look at me like that baby
                    does.  Like I'm someone special. 
                    This is chance for me to do something
                    good.
                          (beat)
                    It's a chance for all of us to do
                    something good.

      Virginia and Burt share a look.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    Well, always did think I could have
                    done better with a girl.

                                    BURT
                    And they do say you learn by your
                    mistakes.  We've already made every
                    mistake there is.

      Virginia and Burt chuckle.  Jimmy waits for an answer.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    What are we gonna name it?  I'm not
                    taking my granddaughter to church
                    with a name like Princess Beyonce.

                                      JIMMY
                    I don't know.  What do you think?                                                                                        37



                                      VIRGINIA
                          (thinks, then)
                    I always liked Hope.

                                      JIMMY
                    Then, Hope it is.

      They sit for beat.  The camera starts to very slowly pull
      out and continues to do so during the following.  The Loggins
      Messina version of Danny's song starts to play. 

                                      JIMMY (CONT'D)
                    I saw that girl at the bus stop again.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    The waitress?

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah.

                                    BURT
                    How did she look?

                                      JIMMY
                    Great.

                                      VIRGINIA
                    You need to grow a pair and take a
                    serious run at that.  We could use
                    another woman around here to help us
                    keep this baby alive.

                                      JIMMY
                    She thinks I'm a homeless kidnapper.

                                    BURT
                    Well, think how happy she'll be when
                    she finds out you're normal.

      As the sun comes up over the house the music continues to
      play and Maw Maw hurries out of the house in her bra and
      pants.  She runs down the street.

                                      JIMMY
                    I got her.

      Jimmy starts after her, passing Mike sleeping in his tent in
      the front yard as he goes.  A newspaper is thrown onto
      sidewalk from a passing car.  On the front page is a picture
      of Lucy with the headline, "Execution Botched.  Lawyers vow
      to get client released."

                                                                                FADE OUT.
