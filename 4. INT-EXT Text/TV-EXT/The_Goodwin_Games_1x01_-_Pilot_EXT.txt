      A prison guard unlocks the main gate, and a scruffy-looking
      JIMMY GOODWIN -- all heart, zero impulse control -- steps
      out into freedom, holding a backpack and an acoustic guitar. 
    He turns back to the guard and gives him a big hug.

      CHYRON: JIMMY GOODWIN, AGE 29

                                      PRISON GUARD
                    We're all gonna miss you, Jimmy. 
                    But I bet it feels great to be a
                    free man again.

                                      JIMMY
                    Yeah.  Can I stay in jail longer?

                                      JIMMY (cont'd)
                    It's just, I owe this guy Frank,
                    like, a ton of money.  I hate to say
                    bad things about anyone, Frank's a
                    nice guy, but he says he can't wait
                    to kill me with a sledgehammer. 
                          (beat, guilty)
                    See, now I feel bad, Frank's a nice
                    guy.

                                      PRISON GUARD
                    Wish I could help, buddy.

      Jimmy nods, then suddenly punches the guard in the face.

                                      JIMMY
                          (hopeful)
                    Assaulting a guard?

                                      PRISON GUARD
                          (sympathetic smile)
                    Sorry, Jimmy.  

      Just then, Jimmy's phone rings.

                                      JIMMY
                    Oh no.  That's probably Frank...
                          (re: phone, relieved)
                    It's my sister.

                                      PRISON GUARD
                    See?  Maybe this day's not so bad
                    after all.

                                      JIMMY
                          (answering)
                    Hey Coney.

      Jimmy's face falls.  He drops his guitar.



      Shots of the small, struggling college town of Granby Ridge,
      New Hampshire and nearby Piscataqua College.  This is where
      the three kids grew up.



      The three siblings sit in a cozy open space at the top of
      the tower.  Henry pours whiskey into plastic cups for them.  

                                      JIMMY
                    Drinking in church.
                          (wistful)
                    Now it feels like home.

      They laugh.  Henry hands Coney a whiskey.

                                      HENRY
                    You're not gonna tattle on me like
                    you always used to, right?

                                      CONEY
                    I'll admit it: I was a total narc. 
                    But not anymore.
                          (re: whiskey)
                    You're my hero. 

      Henry smiles, then sees a faded graffiti heart in one
      corner: "HG + LH."  He balks a little at the sight.

                                      JIMMY
                    It's been way too long, guys.  To
                    being home!  And to Dad.

      The siblings clink cups.  

                                      CONEY
                    Man, I can't believe Dad's really
                    gone.  No more of his crazy puzzles
                    or made-up games...

                                      HENRY
                    Remember all those games?

                                                                          FLASHBACK TO:



      Jimmy is walking outside.  His phone rings.  He looks at it. 
    We see that "FRANK" is calling.

      Jimmy puts the phone away nervously.  He looks at a nearby
      house.  A second-story window is ajar.  He ineptly scampers
    up a rain gutter, pulls himself through the window, and...



      Lawrence addresses the siblings.

                                      LAWRENCE
                    Before we begin the game, are there
                    any questions?

                                      CONEY
                    Yes.  Little thing.  Who's this guy?

      Reveal ELIJAH, a twenty-two year old African-American man,
      sitting in the fourth chair.  

                                      LAWRENCE
                    This is Elijah.  Elijah's the fourth
                    contestant in the game.

      A beat, then the siblings go ballistic.      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 22.

                                      HENRY / JIMMY / CONEY
                    WHAT?!  / NO WAY!!  / ARE YOU
                    KIDDING ME?!

                                      HENRY
                    You're gonna give our dad's
                      inheritance to some stranger?!

                                      LAWRENCE
                    If he wins.

                                      HENRY
                    But who is he?!
                          (to Elijah)
                    Who are you?!

                                      JIMMY
                    Were you one of Dad's students?

                                      CONEY
                    Are you our long lost brother?  And
                    by brother I mean brother brother,
                    not... brother brother.  You got
                    that, right?  I have black friends.

      Elijah remains silent.  Henry tries a new tack.

                                      HENRY
                    Guys, let me handle this.  Elijah. 
                    Obviously you were important to our
                    father.  That makes you important to
                    us.  So let's get to know each
                    other.  My name is--

                                      ELIJAH
                    Look, dude, I don't want to know
                    your name, or anything else about
                    you.  I'm not here to make friends. 
                    I'm here to win.

                                      HENRY
                          (beat, then exploding)
                    WHO ARE YOU?!

                                      LAWRENCE
                          (chuckling)
                    Oh, if you only knew his story...
                          (then, pointedly)
                    But I'm not at liberty to say.
                          (chuckling again)
                    But it's really good.  Anyhoo, it's
                    9AM.  The game you will play is...      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 23.
      REVISED NETWORK DRAFT  1/27/2012

      With some fanfare, Lawrence reaches under his desk, produces
      a Trivial Pursuit box, and places it in front of them.  

                                      HENRY
                    Trivial Pursuit?  

      Henry, Coney and Jimmy share a look: uh oh.

                                      ELIJAH
                    You guys don't like Trivial Pursuit?
                          (to Coney)
                    You don't play it with all your
                    black friends?

                                      JIMMY
                    See, our dad got us into it...

                                                                          FLASHBACK TO:



      The players are gathered as Lawrence enters, smiling.  They
      all sit there, silent and miserable, except Coney.

                                      LAWRENCE
                    So... Trivial Pursuit.  Let's check
                    the results.  Jimmy came in fourth
                    place.  Elijah came in third,
                    somehow beating Jimmy in a quiz
                    about his own family.  Henry was
                    second.  And first place?  Coney.

      Coney smiles, preparing to receive the big check. 

                                      LAWRENCE (cont'd)
                    But of course none of that matters. 
                    Now, the real question: after you
                    finished playing, who cleaned up?  

      Coney stops smiling. The four of them look at each other.  A
      beat.  Slowly, Jimmy raises his hand.  Lawrence grins, and
      presses play on the VCR.  Benjamin reappears on the screen.

                                      BENJAMIN
                    "Clean up your mess." That's a
                    lesson I never taught you kids well
                    enough.  And now look at the messes
                    in all of your lives...

    On Henry:

                                      BENJAMIN  (O.S.) (cont'd)
                    You've hurt people who loved you.

    On Jimmy: 

                                      BENJAMIN  (O.S.) (cont'd)
                    You've let down people who need you.

    On Coney: 

                                      BENJAMIN  (O.S.) (cont'd)
                    You've run away from what makes you
                    special.      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 34.
      REVISED NETWORK DRAFT  1/27/2012

      But then, Coney notices something. As Benjamin continues on
      the TV, we push in on the PENCIL that he's tapping
      absentmindedly on his desk -- or is he?  Subtly, Coney
      transcribes dots and dashes onto a notepad.

                                      BENJAMIN (cont'd)
                    And worst of all, you've lost the
                    one thing that can set you right
                    again: each other.  
                          (beat, then fondly)
                    You kids are the best puzzle I ever
                    made.  But what's a puzzle if the
                    pieces don't fit together?

      A beat as this lands on the siblings.  

                                      BENJAMIN (cont'd)
                    And yes, I know what you're
                    thinking: "Dad's crazy, this whole
                    thing's insane, blah blah blah." 
                    But I bet each one of you heard some
                    things you needed to hear today. 
                    And be honest: for a minute there,
                    wasn't it kinda fun playing Trivial
                    Pursuit together again?  I wish I
                    could've been there to see it...  
                          (beat, then)
                    That being said, only one of you can
                    win the game.  And so...

      Benjamin pauses just long enough for Lawrence to say...

                                      LAWRENCE
                    Jimmy.

                                      BENJAMIN
                    You, my dear, dear--

                                      LAWRENCE
                    Son.

                                      BENJAMIN
                    -- showed strong character by
                    cleaning up.  Congratulations.  You
                    are the winner... 

      Jimmy can't believe it!  On-screen, Benjamin takes a beat.

                                      BENJAMIN (cont'd)
                    ... of five points.

      Huh?  Confused silence.  Benjamin continues:      THE GOODWIN GAMES - "PILOT" 35.
      REVISED NETWORK DRAFT  1/27/2012

                                      BENJAMIN (cont'd)
                    As you'll soon find out, this game
                    is about much more than simply
                    winning my inheritance.
                          (playful smile)
                    But I don't want to spoil the
                    surprise just yet.  

      Benjamin winks and the video ends.  Lawrence walks over to a
      chalkboard divided into quadrants (one for each contestant),
      and writes a "5" in the box labeled "James."

                                      CONEY
                    Five points?  I thought we're
                    playing for 23 million bucks.

                                      LAWRENCE
                    You are.  Trivial Pursuit was the
                    first game in that competition.  

                                      ELIJAH
                    The first game?

                                      LAWRENCE
                    The second game starts tomorrow at
                    9AM precisely.  But for today's
                    victory, Jimmy, you get three
                    hundred dollars.

      Lawrence starts counting out the money to Jimmy as the three
      other contestants act completely stunned.

                                      JIMMY
                    Nice!

                    I need a drink.

                                      CONEY
                    Um, me too. Winner pays.

                                      HENRY
                          (to Elijah)
                    Join us?

                                      ELIJAH
                    Nah.  I'm gonna rest up for
                    tomorrow.  But yeah, you all go out,
                    get drunk, stay up late.

                                      HENRY
                    Seriously...who are you?

                    Okay, I'll tell you.  I'm your
