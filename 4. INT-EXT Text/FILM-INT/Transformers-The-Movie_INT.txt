Standing at the Command Center, watching:
PRIME
Commence countdown, Cliffjumper.
CLIFFJUMPER
Five...Four...Three...Two...
THE
LUNAR
"MOUNTAIN"
Suddenly, smoke starts pouring out of the mountain.
CLIFFJUMPER
One....
Then, the "mountain" which must be made of paper mache or
something blows away revealing -- The shuttle!
CLIFFJUMPER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Liftoff.
Suddenly, the shuttle rips out of the ground in a ball of
fire.

CONTINUED:
As it takes off, we realize this isn't any dinky shuttle, but
a massive ship, capable of carrying all the energon needed
to fight a war and an army to boot. The screen is bathed in
smoke and fire which slowly clears.
ANGLE ON PRIME
As he watches the shuttle shoot into the distance.
PRIME
Now, all we need is a little Energon and
a lot of luck.
ANGLE BEHIND PRIME
We see a bank of computers. Suddenly, a small tape deck pops
open... a cassette pops out and transforms into...
...Laserbeak who flies away unseen.
DISSOLVE TO:
Ironhide is at the controls.
IRONHIDE
If I can dodge Dececpticon rays, I can
sure as shootin' dodge a couple of
asteroids.
Suddenly, there is a terrible BANG! on the side of the ship,
and the two Autobots are thrown from their seats.
PROWL
You were saying?
IRONHIDE (IRKED)
That wasn't an asteroid. There is a blast
of light and they turn to see...

ANGLE ON THE SHIP
The most powerful laser light anybody has ever seen cuts a
gaping hole in the side of the ship... Then, when the light
clears, a panel of the ship falls in and we see -
MEGATRON!
In all his glory.
MEGATRON
Die Autobots!
Then, he transforms to Gun Mode, spins into STARSCREAM'S arms
and Starscream fires.
BRAWN
is cut in half by Megatron's blast.
ON PROWL

THE INSECTICONS
...eat away at the hole in the shuttle to
make way for... ...an ARMY of other
Decepticons including Laserbeak who
enter, firing.
IRONHIDE AND RATCHET
While FIRING back are FUSED TOGETHER... ... then blasted
apart and fall in smoking, glowing fragments.
ON STARSCREAM AND MEGATRON
As they enter the now empty ship, a number of Decepticons
flood past them, taking positions and searching for other
living Autobots.
MEGATRON
This was almost too easy, Starscream.
STARSCREAM
Much easier, oh mighty Megatron, than
attacking the real threat: the Autobots
moon base.
MEGATRON
You're an idiot, Starscream. Were we
simply to wipe out that minuscule base,
they could build another one.

MEGATRON (CONT'D)
But when we slip by their security
systems in their own ship and destroy
Autobot city, the Autobots will be
vanquished forever!
IRONHIDE
Fat chance, Megatron!
Ironhide pulls himself up and grabs onto Megatron who flings
him against the wall.
MEGATRON
Such heroic nonsense!
DISSOLVE TO:

You can explain your security violation
later, Hot Rod! Now, man your battle
station.
HOT ROD
I don't have to explain my so called
violation to you or anyone...
KUP

He said "later!"
Kup moves OFF with Hot Rod and Daniel.
CUT TO:
BLASTER ON FORTIFIED " CROWS NEST" LOOKOUT TOWER
The "Crows Nest" has windows all around and Blaster's seat
rotates so he can watch action and broadcast battle reports
like a Top 40 Deejay. Perceptor climbs up ladder into "Crows
Nest" from lower level. As Blaster speaks, we see Decepticons
FIRING at the windows of the Crows Nest but the bursts
explode harmlessly against the glass

be cool and collected)
Hey, I wasn't worried for a micro-second,

A LARGE ASTEROID
With incredible precision, the rays strike the asteroid,
splitting it in two parts.
ANGLE ON ONE OF THE ASTEROID HALVES
It shoots through space and strikes another asteroid, which,
breaks into several pieces, many of them angling back
towards...
GALVATRON'S SHIPS
which swerve to avoid them as....
THE OTHER ASTEROID PART
Hits another moon or asteroid or general rock in space,
doing the same thing... WIDEN SHOT to show that the pieces
are shooting around like pool balls after an incredibly
violent break... ... zinging into each other... ....
Narrowly missing Galvatron's ship... ... Filling space with
incredible amounts of Dust, lava from inside the moons,

there are several loud gurgles, and we can see the shapes of
something terrible emerging through the muck. Hot Rod spins
to fire, but Kup bats down his arm.

SHARKTICONS

THING)
KUP
See, the Universal Greeting works every
time.

Now, without making any sudden moves,
give them an Energon goody. Kup reaches
into his belt, presses a button and pulls
out an Energon cube. Hot Rod, somewhat
suspicious of the whole process does the
came.
They hold out the cubes and two of the Sharkticons take the
Energon cubes, like dogs getting a treat. Then, the other six
show up looking for cubes.
HOT ROD
This is getting expensive.
KUP
Don't worry, they'll reciprocate. They
each hand out three Energon goodies to
the remaining six Sharkticons... The
Sharkticons eat them happily. Then, they
back off, eyeing the two Autobots with
menace.

The two robots, taken by surprise, fall backwards. PAN FROM
the fallen robots to an area behind a tree. For just a
moment, we see a small yellow Autobot in robot mode. There,
then, as quickly as we realize what it is, it transforms into
automode and vanishes in a flash. It was Wheelie.

Sharkticons march Kup and Hot Rod into a HOLDING PEN within a
walled compound. As we FOLLOW THEM INTO PEN we PULL BACK and
PAN to establish that entry procession is being watched by...
THE QUINTESSONS
slender, spindly framed robotic creatures
with oversized five sided heads, each
side bearing a different mechanistic face
with a different expression on each -
smiling, angry, grimacing, suspicious and
the fifth face is not yet to be seen. As
Hot Rod and Kup are led to certain death
in the Quintesson dungeons, harsh,
dissonant, metallic and terrifying music
plays, underscoring the brutal evil they
face,
KUP (V.O.)
Reminds me of the Niter Slave Mines on
Golgonath Seven....
HOT ROD
Every place reminds you of some place
else.....
KUP (V.O.)
Experience, lad. You should learn to
appreciate it.
HOT ROD
A lot of good it's done us so far!
62.
ON HOT ROD AND KUP
as Hot Rod looks around and reacts sharply
HIS P.O.V.- THE QUINTESSONS
as we feature the Leader Quintesson who is taller and wears a
different color robe from others. He is watching arrival of
Kup and Hot Rod and his faces rotate so it goes from smiling
face to suspicious face to angry face to furious grimace.
RESUME ON HOT ROD AND KUP
as Sharkticons shove and prod them, JOLTING them into the
holding pen and locking the gate. Then, they install
RESTRAINING BOLTS.
HOT ROD
I can't transform!
KUP
They're restraining bolts, lad.
HOT ROD
(looking around)
We got to get a new travel agent....
What is this place?
PAN FROM HIS P.O.V. - A SHADOWED, ALCOVE LIKE HUT
as a figure moves forward slightly and speaks in a harsh,
bass'o voice. It is GRANIX. We saw him in the first scene,
escaping from his planet when Unicron ate it. {Note: The
script says *G*ranix here. Not my mistake.}
KRANIX
The world of the savage Sharkticons and
their cruel masters the Quintessons.
They hunt down those who try to escape
the wrath of Unicron, and put them on
trial.
KUP
But what if they're innocent?
KRANIX
Guilty or innocent, the sentence is
always the same - death!
HOT ROD
Unicron?!
Who's Unicron?
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
KRANIX
A planet six times the size of this one
that absorbs everything in its path.
KUP
So that's the monster's name.
HOT ROD
I wonder if there's any connection
between it and Galvatron.
Suddenly, a Quintesson Guard roars in...
QUINTESSON GUARD (V.O.)
That one!
All turn and look off, reacting as two Guards thunder in,
grab Granix and pull him back out of the door. {NOTE: Another
instance of the spelling of Granix}
ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE LEAD QUINTESSON
as he points at Kup and Hot Rod
QUINTESSON GUARD
Soon, you too shall receive your
sentence.
THEIR POV
- OUT THE WINDOW THE ARENA
Kranix stands on what almost looks like a wide diving board
over a watery (or oily) pit teeming with Sharkticons.
LEAD QUINTESSON
Jury, have you reached a verdict?
JUROR #1
We have your honor.
LEAD QUINTESSON
(to jury of Quintessons)
Guilty.....Or innocent. I repeat.
KRANIX
Spare me this mockery of justice.
LEAD QUINTESSON
I repeat, guilty...or innocent.
JURORS
Guilty!!
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:
Jury's faces rotate to fifth expression - a DEATH'S HEAD ON
GRANIX
{NOTE: Yet another, final, reference to Kranix as
Granix} Suddenly, the Robot is dumped into a pit of teeming
Sharkticons and there is a mad frenzy. In moments, he is no
more.
ANGLE ON KUP
He watches grimly through the bars.
KUP
Not the end I'd wish for, lad.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE EDGE OF A HUGE, SHADOWY PLANET IN SPACE
as Ultra Magnus' Shuttle is BUFFETED BY WINDS AND STORMS as
it enters the atmosphere of JUNKION.
as it SHAKES AND RATTLES VIOLENTLY
DANIEL
Where are we, Springer?
SPRINGER
The place where everything ends up after
you throw it out.
TIGHT ON BLURR
as he holds up hands and CROSSES fingers.
RESUME ON SPRINGER
Tenses and crouches protectively around Arcee and Daniel as
we see mountains of junk whizz past the window.
ULTRA MAGNUS
Brace for impact!
ON SHUTTLE - TRACKING
It plummets through the mountains and canyons of junk,
narrowly avoiding crashing, but frequently hitting junk
pinnacles or sides of junk walls, and causing avalanches of
junk. By the time the ship lands, it is nearly
indistinguishable from the junk.
65.
Everyone is in a jumbled tangle - Ultra Magnus beneath Blurr,
Perceptor upside down and hanging from torn end of stairway,
Arcee crouched over Daniel and Springer with half his body
sticking through the hull
SPRINGER
(pulling himself free of hull
wall)
Remind me to give the Auto Pilot a
raise... Daniel creeps out from under
Arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and
dust off his shoulders
DANIEL
Wow! That was better'n the Roller
Coaster at Future World!
PERCEPTOR
(working scanner, computer
device, thoughtfully)
The composition of this planet seems to
be a chaotic amalgam of discarded ferrous
and non-ferrous articulations.
ULTRA MAGNUS
(baffled)
How's that?
SPRINGER
(opening hull door with a
RIPPING OF METAL)
He says the planet's made of junk.
SPRINGER AND PERCEPTOR AT OPEN DOOR
as they look out on landscape of "living" junk
SPRINGER
Yep, this dump is a dump......
ULTRA MAGNUS
as he straps on TOOL BELT
ULTRA MAGNUS
We might be able to salvage this thing.
(checks LASER DRILL, turns it
on, off)
Ultra Magnus starts for door followed by
Blurr who takes up a saw and tool belt
and Perceptor who rolls up Shuttle Plans
as Daniel moves out to join them
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
DANIEL
Can I help, too?
SPRINGER
It's rough out there, kid. Stay inside
and play with crayons or something.
ARCEE
as she steps forward with a smile, a
strange GRID LIKE "SUIT" in her hand
ARCEE
I think Daniel can make himself useful
with....this! It used to be Spike's.
(holds Grid-like metal frame
"suit")
DANIEL
Wow! Dad's exo-suit. He told me about
it but I never saw it.
ARCEE
Here, try it on.
She starts helping him into the exo-suit.
ON DANIEL
as he gets inside the "suit" which fits
over his body like a grid-work metal
"cage."
Daniel clips "cage" of Exo-Suit shut and stands up inside the
gridwork which makes him taller and broader. He moves
awkwardly, barely able to advance a step
SPRINGER
Just think about what you want to do
before you do it!
DANIEL
brows knitted, thinking.
SPRINGER
Don't fight it Dan-O.
He suddenly starts moving rapidly backwards, then sideways,
then forward, then he starts dancing rapidly, then bounces
off walls... ..spinning upside down, then flips over several
times and lands in a splatter, legs spread, arms this way and
that - amused, startled and unhurt.
(CONTINUED)
67.
CONTINUED: (2)
DANIEL
(continuing)
It's kind of tricky....
He suddenly flips around twice in mid-air then regains his
feet and leans way over against Arcee for support. She laughs
and pats his shoulder
ARCEE
For the first time out, you were great!
ON SPRINGER AT DOOR
as he sends down RAMP and motions to the others curtly
SPRINGER
Show time's over! We've got work to do!
(he starts out)
- MOVING SHOT - VIEW THROUGH CANOPY
Hot Rod and Kup look down on the army of Junkions below
surrounding their friends as they SWOOP BY
KUP
Not since the Crocodillos of Strontero
have I seen such a sight....
ANOTHER ANGLE GRIMLOCK
as he sticks his face up next to Hot Rod. Wheelie, riding on
Grimlock's head, slips down to stand on console next to Hot
Rod
GRIMLOCK
Maybe they make me king, too!
KUP
Don't hold your breath, your majesty.
WRECK-GAR
as he watches Cruiser descend and start
gliding in for a landing
WRECK-GAR
Steady as she goes, mob! Snoopy visitors
get mud in the eye bye and bye, and film
at five!
(gives thumbs up sign, RIDES
OFF)
JUNKIONS
Everything must go by midnight! With a
SINGING ROAR of musical, tribal
excitement, the Junkions sweep Springer
and our friends along with them,
following course of landing Cruiser to
CRUISER LANDING SITE
Cruiser sets down and Junkions line up with weapons aimed at
rampway as they watch door
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED:
ON DOORWAY
as Hot Rod steps out with big smile and
hand full of energon sticks followed by a
very wary Kup, and the Dinobots with
Wheelie riding Sludge's neck.
INTERCUT TO SPRINGER, DANIEL, ARCEE ET. AL FOR REACTIONS
ON WRECK-GAR AND OTHER JUNKIONS
as they react to hot Rod's smile, Wreck-Gar trying to mimic
that smile to his followers who laugh
ON HOT ROD
as he steps up beside Kup and gently pushes Kup's rifle aside
HOT ROD
(aside to Kup, still holding
smile)
Guns aren't exactly friendly.
KUP
(through his teeth to Hot Rod)
Neither are they in case you haven't
noticed.
HOT ROD
(sotto)
What was the Universal greeting again?
WRECK-GAR
growls and slips a SNIPPER, BLOW TORCH
CUTTING TOOL out of a holster and starts
toward Hot Rod with it
HOT ROD
HOT ROD
(big smile)
Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong?
WRECK-GAR AND OTHER JUNKIONS
They look at one another, blink, then beam with smiles

As Hot Rod says this...
...Wreck-Gar takes the energon sticks and holds them over his
head and... ...all the Junkions smile and cheer and start
chanting the universal greeting phrase, laughing, clapping
their hands and dancing around, taking Arcee's hand and...
... taking Springer and Perceptor and Daniel out into center
of a square dance type gathering, moving back and forth with
them dancing happily, singing the universal greeting in a
melodic, rhythmic way
EVERYBODY
Bah weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong Bah
weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong! Bah
weep graaaagnah wheep ni ni bong....
WRECK-GAR
hugs Hot Rod, and Perceptor who winces
and tries to enjoy it, and then hugs
Daniel, Wheelie, Arcee, laughing and
dancing as SINGING goes.
ON GRIMLOCK
as he reacts to Wreck-Gar kissing his leg
GRIMLOCK
Yuck! Me Grimlock, not a kisser!
Me,
Grimlock, a king!
WHEELIE
claps his hands and gleefully makes
noises as he hops about, dancing with
Junkions until we CUT TO
WRECK-GAR
as he stands on top of platform and RINGS
JUNK BELLS AND SIRENS getting silence and
smiling as he waves hands all around
WRECK-GAR
Have a nice day and please, close cover
before striking, friends! Amigos, buddies
and side kicks, Breep drit, aw rootie! So
say the Junkions!
(holds hands over his head)
ANGLE ON HOT ROD
He looks at them, strangely.
HOT ROD
Where did you learn to talk like that?
90.
ANGLE ON WRECK-GAR
He reaches into his body, and about where a heart or some
other organ would be, he pulls out a Watchman.
THE WATCHMAN
On it is a crazy Eddy-type commercial.
WRECK-GAR
We talk T.V. You talk some T.V.?
KUP
looks around nervously.
KUP
I talk some TV. And now, Hot Rod for the
news. Don't touch that dial. Void where
prohibited. JUNKIONS cheer wildly while
the Dinobots react with uncertainty
RESUME ON WRECK-GAR
as he points off and shouts happily.
WRECK-GAR
By George kimosabes your smashed up,
blotto friend, soon like brand new with
ninety day warranty all iciban parts and
labor is!
HIS P.O.V. - JUNKIONS WITH ULTRA MAGNUS
The Junkions move Ultra Magnus' mangled body through an
amazing assembly line, quickly piecing together his body
parts, using junk when they can't find a part. Then, they
lube him, dust him, spray him and polish him. Then, Wreck-Gar
hits a switch, and Ultra Magnus' eye lights go on.
WRECK-GAR
Happy motoring! Cock-a-doodle-do!
ON ULTRA MAGNUS
as he steps away from Junkion line of reconstruction and into
group consisting of Hot Rod, Kup and Springer.
SPRINGER AND OTHERS
(Ad lib jubilation)
Ultra Magnus!
ULTRA MAGNUS
You're all alive...
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
HOT ROD
The matrix!
All turn to Ultra Magnus.
ULTRA MAGNUS
It's gone...
KUP
And with it, all hope.
HOT ROD
No...
(inspired)
The matrix will not fail us.
ARCEE
Didn't you hear Ultra Magnus. We don't
have it anymore. Galvatron does.
HOT ROD
Then we've got to trust in ourselves, and
no matter what they odds, destroy
Unicron.
ON WRECK-GAR
His eyes light up.
WRECK-GAR
Yeah! Destroy Unicron... Kill the grand
poobah.... Flush cosmic troubles down the
drain.
ANGLE ON JUNKIONS
JUNKIONS
(almost chanting)
Destroy Unicron... Kill the grand
poobah... Flush cosmic troubles down the
drain.
ANGLE ON SPRINGER
The Quintesson ship in the BACKGROUND.
SPRINGER
Listen,
I don't want to rain on anybody's
parade,
but how are we going to move the
army to
Unicron. We don't have enough
room on
that ship.
(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:
WRECK-GAR
No fuss, no muss.
(to others)
Hurry, hurry. Sale must end! Rush right
on down to bridge and test drive latest
with no obligation.
Suddenly, several Junkions scramble to concealed doorways in
the Junk.
ULTRA MAGNUS
You have ships here?
WRECK-GAR
New, improved Junkion planet, is sleek
sexy import with turbo handling.
SPRINGER
What's he talking about?
ANGLE ON QUINTESSON
Suddenly, boosters fire from the back side of the junk, and
somewhere under all of the junk, we realize is a real space
ship. Maybe the junk is the space ship. It takes off, bits
and pieces of junk flying off as it moves.
SPRINGER
This is what I call traveling in style.
DISSOLVE TO:
LONG SHOT- UNICRON
as Galvatron stands on the surface of Unicron, holding the
Matrix.
GALVATRON (V.O.)
Listen to me, or suffer the consequences.
UNICRON
Aren't we getting pompous?
GALVATRON
I now possess that which you most fear.
Unicron LAUGHS and the force of it rocks
the surface of the planet, knocking
Galvatron to his knees.
GALVATRON
You will do my bidding, or... Unicron
roars with laughter.
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:
GALVATRON
...taste my wrath.
He leans down and starts trying to open the matrix.
ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING GALVATRON
IN THE BACKGROUND, we see Cybertron getting closer. Galvatron
struggles with the Matrix, but gets a big shock.
UNICRON
You underestimate me Galvatron.
ANOTHER ANGLE - GALVATRON ON UNICRON
He desperately struggles to open the matrix. The planet
suddenly starts shaking. Galvatron is bathed in a reddish
light, and looks up in horror!
ANGLE ON UNICRON
A hideous transformation is beginning. The surface of the
planet in front of Galvatron opens up, and we see that the
hideous light comes from eyes set on a hideous head!
GALVATRON AND UNICRON
Galvatron is maybe the size of a single tooth on the horrible
head before him.
UNICRON
For a time, I considered sparing your
measly little planet, but now you shall
witness its dismemberment!
ANGLE ON GALVATRON
Suddenly, the ground he stands on drops away, and he falls
through space... ... Landing on a protruding plate which
sticks out of Unicron's chest.
GALVATRON - CLOSE
He looks around himself in horror and lets out a loud scream
as he realizes the unimaginable horror that surrounds him.
ANGLE ON UNICRON - LONG SHOT
The massive planet transforms, arms and legs fold out of the
enormous body, hands unfold from the arms, jets from it's
back propel it towards... ... Cybertron, which, now looks
lonely and vulnerable in space.
94.
ANGLE ON GALVATRON
He stands on a ledge on Unicron and desperately tries to open
the matrix, but no cigar.
GALVATRON
No!!!
ANGLE ON CYBERTRON
Unicron enters shot and grasps at Cybertron with a hideous
claw...
ANGLE ON A TOWER ON CYBERTRON
Shockwave talks into a communications device, as alarms sound
and troopers run everywhere.
SHOCKWAVE
Decepticons...we're under
attack...Scramble - Then his voice is cut
off as...
SHOCKWAVE'S POV - OUT HIS WINDOW
Unicron's hand reaches towards the window, squeezes, and the
walls crash in.
SPACE - UNICRON AND CYBERTRON
Unicron tears off the tower and crushes it as...
A FLEET OF DECEPTICON SHIPS
streak out of Cybertron and begin firing on the enormous
planet. Here, we see the true scale of Unicron. The fighters
are the size of bees as they attack.
ANGLE ON UNICRON
He looks down on the swarm of fighters and... ...Breathes
fire down on them. The fighters POP and burn like popcorn in
a blowtorch. In moments they disappear like sparks from a
fire.
ANGLE ON CYBERTRON
Decepticon troopers man a massive gun emplacement as... ...
Unicron's huge hand reaches down... ... scraping buildings
and... ... tearing out gun emplacements.
95.
ANOTHER ANGLE- UNICRON'S FACE
as he puts his face down so his mouth will receive all the
rockets, laser blasts, etc.
THE DECEPTICON DEFENDERS
are silhouetted like ants in the foreground as Unicron OPENS
HIS MOUTH and swallows the fire barrage
GALVATRON
GALVATRON Stop feeding him, you fools!
ANGLE ON UNICRON AND CYBERTRON
As yet more Decepticon fighters rip out of the planet, it
looks like Unicron is going to have a field day tearing it
apart.
CUT TO:
THE QUINTESSON SHIP - SAME TIME
Hot Rod, Kup, Springer, Arcee and Daniel as they also look
through canopy, astonished
DANIEL
Wow!
THEIR P.O.V. - UNICRON Destroying CYBERTRON
HOT ROD (V.O.)
Doesn't it remind you of something, Kup?
RESUME ON KUP, DANIEL AND HOT ROD
as they MOVE CLOSER STILL. Kup is glassy eyed.
KUP

Nope, never seen anything like it.

HOT ROD
I knew there had to be a first time....

Battle stations!
LONG SHOT- HOT ROD'S CRUISER AND THE JUNKION SPACE SHIP
as hatches open and the Dinobots start FLYING OUT.
Hot Rod shoves joystick forward and Cruiser DRIVES TOWARD
UNICRON whom we see turn to take a swat at it through glass
canopy
ON JUNKION SPACE SHIP
as it pulls up beside Hot Rod's Cruiser so they are both in a
line.....The Dinobots behind both ships ...all diving toward
Unicron's nose
As Wreck-Gar also has joystick shoved down and watches
Unicron's face loom closer, closer, closer
LONG SHOT- CRUISER, JUNKION SHIP AND DINOBOTS IN FORMATION
as Unicron smiles and cups both hands together, preparing to
catch the lot of them as soon as they get within reach
UNICRON'S CHEST
Galvatron, the matrix hanging around his
neck. Transforms to Cannon and fires up
at... ... A bright panel on Unicron's
chest...
BLAAAM!
He hits the panel and lights and sparks fly out, causing the
gigantic robot to flicker momentarily.
ANGLE ON UNICRON
The monster lets out a ROAR! Then, reaches down, picks up
Galvatron and drops him into his mouth like a raisin.
ANGLE ON GALVATRON
He drops into the deep pit of Unicron's mouth, narrowly
avoiding both a torrent of fire, and his sharp, crushing
teeth.
97.
As Ultra Magnus, Perceptor and the others watch in
amazement...
WRECK-GAR (CONT'D)
Free bonus surprise!
JUNKIONS
Free bonus surprise!
THE JUNKIONS RUN AROUND
welding things... ...screwing things together... ... and
kicking control panels to make them work...
The cruiser rips through the eye socket and smashes through
several electrical membranes that are, in fact, Unicron's
brain.
ANGLE ON THE SHIP
As the ship tumbles through, it dumps off the various
Autobots like rubbish and disintegrates.
ANGLE ON HOT ROD
He tumbles out of the rubbish and down a deep pit (which we
can assume is a robotic sinus or something)
Hot Rod drops through the darkness and lands in a pile of
miscellaneous junk.
ON HOT ROD
He slowly gets up and looks around the chamber.
WHAT HE SEES
Pan as Hot Rod looks over various different bits of junk,
until he sees the glowing shape of the Autobot Matrix
apparently suspended in mid air.
HOT ROD
The Autobot Matrix!
Then, suddenly two red, burning eyes light up above the
matrix, and we see the hideous form of Galvatron.
GALVATRON
It will do you no good, Autobot.
It
cannot be opened.
ON HOT ROD
He stands up and walks towards Galvatron.
(CONTINUED)
100.
CONTINUED:
HOT ROD
Not by a Decepticon.
ANGLE ON HOT ROD AND GALVATRON
Hot Rod steps towards Galvatron.
GALVATRON
It is strange that we should find
ourselves as allies...
ON GALVATRON
Suddenly, his body is violently twisted,
and his arms are almost broken off.
GALVATRON
Uhhhh...
UNICRON
Destroy him, or feel yourself torn from
limb to limb.
GALVATRON
Of course, my master!
ANGLE ON GALVATRON AND HOT ROD
Galvatron takes a shot at Hot Rod. ... Hot Rod dives away, as
electricity seems to flash everywhere.
ON GALVATRON
He peers into the gloom.
GALVATRON'S POV
-
PANNING THE ROOM
Hot Rod is nowhere to be seen amidst all of the junk.
ON GALVATRON
Weapon drawn.
GALVATRON
Puny Autobot, you lack even Prime's
courage. There is no response.
CUT TO:
Kup, Arcee, Springer and Daniel dash down the corridor.
Suddenly, Daniel's foot is caught in a maze of wiring.
ANGLE ON THE OTHERS
Not noticing, they keep running.
ANGLE ON DANIEL
He tries to pull his foot out. No luck. Then, he looks up.
WHAT HE SEES
The Robotic Antibodies are drawing very close to him.
DANIEL
He looks o.s. towards the others.
DANIEL
Help...
ANGLE ON KUP AND ARCEE
They turn around and see Daniel about to be munched by the
antibodies.
ARCEE
Daniel!
102.
ANGLE ON SPRINGER, KUP AND ARCEE
They dash down the corridor firing on...
THE ROBOTIC ANTIBODIES
Their shots hit some, knocking them to scrap, but there are
so many of them, that they can't hold back the tide as it...
ANGLE UNDER THE ANTIBODIES
Daniel, unscathed by the things, which hover over his head,
munching their way towards the Autobots, gets his foot free.
DANIEL
I'm okay.
They don't even see me.
ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOTS
It looks like Custer's last stand as they are surrounded by
the vicious antibodies.
KUP
They must not programmed to catch flesh
creatures.
SPRINGER
Us, on the other hand...
ARCEE
Daniel... Try to find help! Arcee
fires...
HER SHOT
- TRACKING
Misses the Antibodies, but strikes a large tube.
ANGLE ON THE TUBE
When it is hit, it pours a torrent of liquid which... ...
Goes over the swarm of Antibodies, but hits Daniel... ...
Carrying him away in a flood of glowing liquid.
ON DANIEL - TRACKING
He shouts as he finds himself in a river of flowing goo.
CUT TO:
103.
UNICRON - A FLOWING TUNNEL
Daniel
rips through what seem to be endless caves on the
torrent
of liquid, until he is dumped down a high waterfall
into...
.... A glowing lake. ... He stays under for a
moment,
and then bobs up to see...
UNICRON'S STOMACH
This is the central processing area for
Unicron's "food" and "energy." A long
conveyer belt drops junk into a clear,
bubbling vat, where it is separated into
raw material and energy. The energy,
which comes out in raw form, goes into a
machine and is crunched into energon
cubes, while the solid material, is
separated into it's component metals and
plastics, formed into ingots and sent
elsewhere in an assembly line fashion.
DANIEL
watches this with awe until he sees...
ANGLE ON THE ASSEMBLY LINE
... Several Decepticon troopers hanging from cables like
shirts at a dry cleaners are dropped into the bubbling vat,
and in moments converted to nothing... ... Then, Cliffjumper
and Jazz roll out of the line...
ON DANIEL
He dashes to the shores of the glowing
lake...
DANIEL
Cliffjumper! Jazz!
And then Spike comes rolling down, followed by Bumblebee!
DANIEL
Bumblebee!
Dad!
ON CLIFFJUMPER, JAZZ, AND SPIKE
They look down, but can't move because they are held by
massive pincers.
SPIKE
Shut off the control, Daniel. Daniel
looks around.
Then, he sees.

What do I do? It doesn't have any
buttons or anything.
ANGLE ON SPIKE - TRACKING
He looks down.
SPIKE
Shoot it, Son.
DANIEL
But I don't have a gun.
SPIKE
Use your exo-suit.

He looks down at his hand and concentrates as hard as he can.
Then, a spark comes out. It grows longer.
ANGLE ON THE MACHINE
Spike and the Autobots are about to go in.
CLIFFJUMPER
Hurry!
DANIEL
Starts frying the command console!
ANGLE ON THE LINE
It keeps moving. Then, Cliffjumper is dropped in!
ANGLE ON DANIEL
He looks back, and to his horror sees Jazz, Bumblebee and his
father about to be dropped in. He keeps firing. The panel
starts exploding!

DANIEL
I can't stop it!

Jazz drops in, then Bumblebee, then Spike.
DANIEL
turns around and sees this.
DANIEL
Dad!
There is no answer. Play the moment. Then...
SPIKE
Son.
ANGLE ON THE VAT
It is empty. The Autobots and Spike sit at the bottom,
smoking but alright.
SPIKE
You did it!
CUT TO:
THE DARK CAVERN WITH GALVATRON AND HOT ROD
Galvatron, the Matrix at his neck, stalks around the room.
Looking everywhere for Hot Rod.
GALVATRON
Come out, Autobot. We all must die
sometime.
Suddenly, shockingly, Hot Rod jumps out of the floor and
grabs Galvatron, sinking his fist into the Decepticon's face.
GALVATRON
stumbles backward.
ANGLE ON GALVATRON AND HOT ROD
Galvatron jumps at Hot Rod... ...
Hot Rod transforms to a
car and races away...
ANGLE ON GALVATRON
He transforms to cannon mode and fires... ... Hot Rod
transforms to humanoid mode and the shot goes through his
legs. ...
Then, he fires back at Galvatron... ...
(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:
Hitting him as he transforms back to humanoid mode and
angering him. .Raises his gun, then lowers it.
GALVATRON
No, I will crush you with bare hands. Hot
Rod transforms back to car and tries to
race away... ... Galvatron jumps after
him and catches him... ... Hot Rod,
nearly pinned by Galvatron transforms to
humanoid mode.
... Galvatron wrestles him to his back.. ... The Adolescent
Robot tries to fight back, but the other is stronger. ...
Galvatron puts his hands around Hot Rod's neck and starts
squeezing. ... We hear the crunching of metal.
GALVATRON
First Prime, then Ultra Magnus and now
you. It is a pity Autobots die so easily
or I might have a sense of satisfaction
now. Hot Rod desperately gasps and pulls
at Galvatron's hands...
The walls crush in.
The Junkions and the Autobots are
being
smashed together.
WRECK-GAR
Ashes to ashes. Junk to junk.
Galvatron still strangles Hot Rod.
HOT ROD
Gasps.
GALVATRON
Die!

On Hot Rod, his hands, nearly dead,
spring to life for a moment and grasp the
Matrix which hangs from Galvatron's
chest.
107.
ANGLE ON THE MATRIX
Suddenly, it lights up.
ANOTHER ANGLE
A miraculous transformation takes place.
... Hot Rod begins to grow at an
alarming rate. ... Age shows on his
face. ... He is stronger and wiser.
OPTIMUS PRIME

He fires at Hot Rod as...
GALVATRON
Nooooooo!
... Hot Rod gets up. ...
The shot doesn't even dent him.
HOT ROD
This is the end of the road, Galvatron.
With that, he picks up the Decepticon and
throws him through...
Hot Rod, bathed in the glow of the matrix. Sticks his hand
in the way we saw Galvatron and Ultra Magnus try earlier.
There is no shock. Then, like pulling the pin on a hand
grenade, he unleashes the spiritual equivalent of a bomb!
ASSORTED SHOTS -
INVASION OF THE MATRIX
The matrix rips through Unicron's body, blowing up wires
causing floods and generally causing havoc.
It tumbles through space.
AUTOBOTS AND JUNKIONS
(THEY SCREAM WITH EXHILARATION)
ANGLE ON UNICRON
Suddenly,
he starts tearing into his body.
They are overrun by the antibodies. One takes a whopper bite
out of Springer's chest.
SPRINGER
I'm almost out of energy. Suddenly, he
looks up and sees one of the creatures
explode above
HIM.
Then another explodes, then another.
SPRINGER'S POV - A WALL OF ANTIBODIES
Suddenly, every antibody in the wall begins exploding, and
through the carnage, we see Bumblebee, Spike, Daniel,
Cliffjumper and Jazz.
ANGLE ON THE BATTLE
The last of the antibodies is blown away, and Kup, Arcee and
Springer sit up amidst a pile of antibody bodies.
SPRINGER
That's what I call the nick of time.
ANGLE ON ALL
Suddenly, an entire wall vanishes as Unicron's hand tears at
things.
(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED:
JAZZ
Let's burn rubber!
ANGLE ON THE TUNNEL
They transform. The humans jump in.
THE CHASE - TRACKING
They race up the tunnel, one step ahead
of Unicron's hand
which shoots after them, pulling apart
what we know must be
pieces of his brain... Then, they reach
what seems like a
dead end. In fact, it is the back side
of Unicron's good
eye. The hand comes in after them!
ANGLE DOWN THE CORRIDOR
An unbelievably fast and powerful robot races towards the
Autobots. When it gets there, we realize that it is Rodimus
Prime.
KUP
I knew you had potential, lad!
ANGLE ON RODIMUS PRIME
RODIMUS PRIME
Autobots, transform and roll out. Rodimus
Prime transforms into truck mode as the
other Autobots also transform. Daniel
and Spike jump into him. Then, in a
continuous line, he shoots off, the other
Autobots racing behind him.
