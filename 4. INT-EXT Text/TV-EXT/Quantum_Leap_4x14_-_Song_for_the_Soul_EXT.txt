      They talk and walk down a southside neighborhood street,
      carrying their bundles of costumes and wigs. Their makeup 
      has been washed away and they are dressed in cotton dresses 
      of the period. For the first time you can see how young 
      these girls are. In the distance a street gang harmonizes a 
      "Do Wop".

                                  LYNELL'S VOICE
                    You must have hit your head a lot
                    harder than you thought.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      NEW ANGLE

      Sam looks around him, a little uncomfortable about the area
      they are walking in. They pass an occasional wino.

                                  SAM
                      Uh...yeah. I guess I did.

                                  PAULA
                            (angry)
                    We could have won.
                            (beat)
                    That would have been a hundred
                    dollars, new costumes and a shot
                    at the finals.

                                  LYNELL
                    Bobby Lee said we could come back
                    and try again.

                                  PAULA
                    He was scopin' you so hard, he
                    would have said anything.

                                  LYNELL
                    That's not true. He just saw that
                    Cheree hurt herself and wanted to
                    give us another chance.

                                  PAULA
                    We should have won.      Paula notices Sam checking out the street.


                                  PAULA
                              (continuing; to Sam)
                    Now, what's your problem?

                                  SAM
                    Well, I was just thinking that it
                    was kind of late for you...us...to
                    be out walking around by ourselves.

                                  LYNELL
                    My daddy would kill me if he knew
                    I was here and so would yours.

                                  PAULA
                    Cheree's old man doesn't stay home
                    long enough to know when she's
                    gone.

                                  RAG HEAD TEEN'S VOICE
                    Hey baby, come on over here and
                    talk to me.

      The "Do Wop" dissipates into cat calls and whistles.

      NEW ANGLE - INCLUDING THREE HARD-LOOKING BLACKS

      They lounge all over the stoop of a run-down Brownstone.
      Garbage is strewn around them.

                                  PAULA
                    Now, who the hell would want to
                    talk to your ugly ass?

                                  SAM
                    Paula...

                                  RAG HEAD TEEN
                    You're talkin' to me, Paula. Come
                    on, bring your fine brown body
                    over here...                                  PAULA
                    I said I don't talk to night
                    crawlers. So why don't you just
                    crawl back into whatever hole you
                    crawled out of.

      The boys start to get up and Paula stops defiantly and puts
      her hands on her hips. Sam grabs Paula by the arm and pulls
      her along.

                                  LYNELL
                    Damn, Paula!

                                  SAM
                          (to girls)
                    Just keep walking.

      The boys circle around in front of them. The Rag Head stops
      Sam.

                                  RAG HEAD TEEN
                    What about you darlin'? 'Cause you
                    know I like me some tall, healthy
                    woman.

                                  SAM
                    Why don't you and your friends
                    just go on back and sit down.

                                  RAG HEAD TEEN
                    Why don't you just sit down with
                    me?

                                  LYNELL
                    Well, actually we were supposed to
                    be home hours ago, and my father's
                    gonna be real upset if...

                                  RAG HEAD TEEN
                            (grabbing Lynell)
                    Well, let's give him somethin' to
                    be real upset about.

      NEW ANGLE - FEATURING SAM

      Sam's moves are so fast that the youth never knew what hit
      him. A roundhouse kick, followed through with a straight      kick, sends the boy into a mound of trash cans. The little
      group stands frozen in shock for a beat and then Sam takes 
      a stance to face off the other two youths. They scramble 
      and vanish into the night, with the Rag Head a few steps 
      behind.

      ON SAM, PAULA AND LYNELL

      They are staring at Sam with their mouths hanging wide 
      open.

      Sam shuffles, trying to cover and starts walking, dragging
      the two stunned girls with him.

                                  PAULA
                    How did you do that?

                                  SAM
                    I think we better get home.

                                  LYNELL
                    We live this way.
                            (turning the corner)
                    Cheree, I think we better get you
                    to the hospital. I mean, somethin'
                    must of really happened when you
                    hit your head.

                                  PAULA
                    Are you crazy? That bump turned
                    this child into some kind of
                      supergirl.

      Paula mimics one of Sam's moves like a dance step.

                                  PAULA
                              (continuing)
                    Maybe we can put some of it in the
                    act.
                            (beat)
                    I love this move.

                                  SAM
                      I...really don't know what
                    happened back there. But I do know
                    young girls shouldn't be walking
                    the streets at two in the morning.                                  LYNELL
                      Especially one with a mouth like
                    Paula.

                                  PAULA
                    I can take care of myself!

                                  LYNELL
                    Yeah, right.

      NEW ANGLE

      They turn the corner and head past a row of old Brownstone
      houses. They stop and head down some steep steps to a
      basement door. Lynell hands her bundle to Sam. Her voice
      drops to a whisper and she begins to work the lock with a
      hidden key.

                                  LYNELL
                              (continuing)
                    All I know is if Cheree hadn't
                    done whatever it was she did,
                    you'd be tellin' my daddy about it
                    'cause I'd a made sure I was dead.
                            (reaching for bundle)
                    Are you gonna spend the night?

                                  SAM
                    Well, no, maybe I better...

                                  MAN'S VOICE
                    Maybe the three of you better...

      WIDER ANGLE - INCLUDING REVEREND WALTERS

      He's a tall, imposing man of about fifty. He stands before
      them wearing a simple sweater and a stern look. Reverend
      Walters voice explodes like a cannon in the night.


                                  REV. WALTERS
                    ...get your hides right through
                    this door and do some serious
                      explaining about what my daughter
                    is doing out until two in the
                    morning.      Paula, Sam and Lynell look like deer caught in someone's
      headlights, wide-eyed and frozen.


                                  REV. WALTERS
                              (continuing)
                    I said, inside!

                                  SAM'S VOICE OVER
                    Leaping into other people's lives
                    has taught me never to judge a
                    book by its cover, as well as many
                    other equally cliche, but useful,
                    sayings.

      Sam and the girls march sheepishly inside, as we...

                                                                              CUT TO:


      The strains of a gospel chorus wail and fill the cloudless
      sky with songs of praise. Above the chorus Lynell's voice
      soars clear and free singing, "He may not come when you 
      want him, but he's right on time."

                                  CHOIR
                    He may not come when you want him,
                    but he's right on time. Right on,
                    on time. He may not come when you
                    want him, but he's right on time,
                    on time.


      The row house sits like a cookie cut out of the two that 
      rest on either side. In the heart of Forty-seventh street, 
      their home has the grace of a cared-for property. A rough 
      piano track with drums, plays on the Wallensack tape deck
      underneath their voices.

                                  THE LOVETTES VOICES
                    Do you love me? Do you love me? Do
                    you love me? Do you love me?
                    Now that I can Dance. Dance,
                    Dance, Dance!


      She exits out onto the street, Sam is close behind. He 
      grabs her arm and turns her.

                                  SAM
                    Lynell.

      She turns and looks at Sam and then after Bobby Lee, who
      disappears down the street.

                                  LYNELL
                    He's my chance to get out of here.

                                  SAM
                    Maybe there's another way.

                                  LYNELL
                    What?

                                  SAM
                    I don't know.

                                  LYNELL
                    Then let me talk to him.

                                  SAM
                    Not until you give me a chance to
                    figure out another way.

      She looks after Bobby then back to Sam. Flustered, she 
      gives Sam a look and turns going back into the house. Al 
      pops next to Sam.

                                  OBSERVER
                    You better think of something, Sam.

                                  SAM
                    I have.
                            (beat)
                    I want you to get me the names of
                    all the local record companies in
                    Chicago.
                            (beat)
                    I'm going to call every one of
                    them until I get somebody to come
                                  (MORE)                                  SAM (CONT'D)
                    here The Lovettes. Maybe I can
                    make Lynell understand there's
                    better people out there than Bobby
                    Lee.

      CLOSE ON SAM

      His eyes shift from Al to Lynell. His face is filled with
      concern, as we...

                                                                            FADE OUT:

      STOCK

      The city stretches out before us filled with a million 
      faces. As they pass, each face keeps its secrets.


      The Chicago hawk whips at the barren branches of the front
      tree.
