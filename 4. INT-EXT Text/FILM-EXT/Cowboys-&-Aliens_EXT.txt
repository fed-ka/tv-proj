burning sun FLARES LENS, beating down on... A MAN.
Lying in the barren DESERT. Out cold. Handsome... but HARD.
We'll call him THE MAN IN BLACK, the color of his dirty clothes.
2.
A PINK TONGUE LICKS HIM. The man STARTS AWAKE -- to find a
MONGREL DOG over him. Mangy. But sweet.
COUGHING, the man stumbles up. How'd he get here? And where
the hell i.: here? And -- OWWW. A GASH in his side...
.. part of the wound oddly SEARED. He winces. Trying to solve
this painful puzzle. Something GLINTS on his wrist:
A STEEL BRACELET. No clasp to pull it off. He touches the
surface -- TSSS -- SHIT -- It's HOT!
And there's a BLACK STETSON on the ground. The Man grabs it to
shield his eyes... but STOFS:
A WORN PHOTOGRAPH in the inner brim. A WOMAN. Young,
beautiful. SMILING.
The Man stares: does he KNOW this woman? is this even HIS hat?
The dog BARKS ALERT. The man turns -- QUICK -- his hand reaches
toward his hip on INSTINCT but there's no holster. NO GUNS.
THREE RIDERS ON HORSEBACK ARE COMING OVER THE RISE:
THE CLAIBORNE BROTHERS -- WES, MOSE and LUKE. Dusty and tough.
Wes gallops right up to our Man, gives him the once over --
WES CLAIBORNE
Howdy.
(NO RESPONSE)
We're riding towards Absolution. You
know how far west we are?
The Man's got NO IDEA what he's talking about.
LUKE CLAIBORNE
Maybe he's a dummy.
Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now --
WES CLAIBORNE
There a reason you don't wanna answer my
question, friend?
And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist --
MOSE CLAIBORNE
Wes, he's got iron on his wrist... and
he's been shot.
LUKE CLAIBORNE
Bet he's a chain jumper.
Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's SURROUNDED.
3.
LUKE
If he escaped, there'll be a bounty.
Let's bring him with us.
Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back
scabbard. COCKS both barrels. The dog GROWLS --
WES CLAIBORNE
Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn
round and start walking.
But The Man doesn't move. The Claibornes share glances. Wes
steps forward -- RAISING HIS RIFLE --
WES CLAIBORNE (CONT'D)
Dead or alive, no difference. I said
WALK OR--
THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the rifle
forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the gun's in THE
MAN'S HANDS -- BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards, HOLE IN HIS CHEST!
As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man FLIPS the rifle again --
SLAM! MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls -- UNDER
Luke's horse -- GRABBING Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's FLAT on
his back -- BREATHLESS, staring UP at the double-barrel:
LUKE CLAIBORNE
-- P-please, God -- d-don't --
-- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK! The rifle's EMPTY.
Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down,
knocking him out cold. And ALL of this took about ten seconds.
This man is a cold-blooded KILLER. But somehow... he didn't
seem to KNOW that. CONFUSION. Drops the rifle, looks down at
his hands... covered in BLOOD. And the BODIES in his wake.
The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket. It DANCES
on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot. He picks
it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM --
"TO FORT STANTON -- STOP -- ABSOLUTION TOWNSHIP BESIEGED BY
OUTLAWS -- STOP -- FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ANY MAN WITH A GUN -- STOP
-- ABSOLUTION AWAITS -- STOP"
THE MAN IN BLACK
(a hoarse whisper)
Absolution...
SLAM TO MOMENTS LATER:
With a HYA! The Man sends two horses GALLOPING, mounts the
third, wincing at that gash in his side. Starts to trot off...
sees the dog following...
4.
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
Get outta here. Leave me alone.
But the dog keeps following. Like they're FRIENDS now. The man
turns away dismissively as we BOOM UP to reveal the WIDE OPEN
VALLEY below... and a SPECK within it that is:
A CROOKED SIGN: "ABSOLUTION." The town is dismal and forgotten.
Crumbling buildings blistered by sun. The Man rides in --
dehydrated, the wound DRAINING him.
His eyes fall on the first building he sees... A CHURCH.
Their leader is PERCY DOLARHYDE, a cocky, hot-tempered bastard --
he ignites another Molotov, hurls it at the CLAIMS OFFICE --
PERCY
THIS IS A MESSAGE FROM MY FATHER! ONLY
CLAIM TO LAND AROUND HERE'S THE ONE WITH
HiS NAME ON IT!
The gang rides down Main Street, HOOTING -- Percy cocks another
Molotov, aiming for the SALOON --
But one of his men, half-Apache NAT COLORADO, shouts:
NAT COLORADO
Percy! N2t the saloon!
PERCY
Why the goddamn hell not?!
NAT COLORADO
Cause your dady said so.
Something LOADED in the way he emphasizes "daddy." Percy GLARES
-- strange RESENTMENT between them. With a growl, Percy GALLOPS
OFF, chucks the flaming bottle onto the CHURCH STEPS:
FRIGHTENED TOWNSPEOPLE run for the sanctuary of the church,
Meacham SWATS OUT the fire on the steps --
MEACHAM
All right, folks -- don't panic! Get
inside and you'll be fine... C'mon...
Meacham tosses The Man one of the blankets, nods across the
street to the GENERAL STORE which is just STARTING to burn --
MEACHAM (CONT'D)
Put it out before it gets goin'!
ON THE MAN, not sure how he suddenly became the damn fire
brigade, but HUSTLING across the street to --
THE GENERAL STORE
8.
WHIPS open the blanket, beats at the flames advancing toward the
roof -- PUTS THE FIRE OUT as the door FLIES OPEN and out steps:
A KID. 11. Rough n' tumble. And right now, mouth full of
LICORICE. Two FULL JARS of CANDY in his hands. OOPS:
KID
Just tryin' to save the candy.
(SWALLOWS, worried now)
You one of my Pa's hired guns?
Before he can answer, HOOFBEATS behind them -- and here's PERCY.
He yanks the reins, pulls his REVOLVER on our Man --
PERCY
Who the hell're yam?
Whatever the opposite of Love At First Sight is, THIS is it:
THE MAN
Nobody.
PERCY
Nobody is right. You think you can just
collect your fifty dollars and ride off?
You signed up for the wrong side, boy.
The kid's scared. The Man ISN'T, despite the gun in his face:
PERCY (CONT'D)
Tell you what. You get down on your
knees and kiss my boot.
The Man's eyes narrow --
PERCY (CONT'D)
You do that and I'll let you run back to
wherever the hell you came from so you
can tell whoever you see...
(cocks his gun)
Absolution belongs -tg..th-e- 1Dolar es.
THE MAN
You want me to kiss your boot?
Percy extends his boot just INCHES from The Man's face:
PERCY
Tongue's just fine if you're feelin'
amorous. Don't hold ba --
THWIP! The Man YANKS Percy's boot off his foot in one quick
move and KWHAM!!!1 WINGS IT RIGHT INTO PERCY'S FACE!
Percy FLIES off the HORSE -- The Man grabbing his rifle -- the
moment Percy lands, it's STICKING into his NECK:
9.
THE MAN
Kiss this, you sonofa --
NAT COLORADO (O.S.)
-- PUT IT DOWN !
-- Nat Colorado gallops around the corner, SHOTGUN RAISED.
PERCY
Goddamnit, Nat -- SHOOT HIM!!!
-- but The Man yanks Percy up by his collar, using him as a
SHIELD between himself and Colorado. Eerily calm --
THE MAN
Wherever you came from? Go back.
Colorado knows he's dealing with a PROFESSIONAL. MORE GANG
MEMBERS ride up, surprised -- a dirty outlaw, GREAVEY, barks:
GREAVEY
Sheriff's right behind us, Nat!
PERCY
You goddamned shitheels! Don't you even
THINK about leavin' me!!!!
Colorado -- DECISION -- doesn't take long -- glares at The Man --
NAT COLORADO
Be seeing you.
THE MAN
Look forward to it.
With that, Nat spurs his horse -- YA! The others follow him as
he RIDES HARD out of town. Percy growls at The Man --
PERCY
You are a dead man. You hear me? So
help me God I will kill you my--
DM! The Man's SMASHES Percy's skull with the gun, knocking him
OUT COLD, as LAWMEN approach on horseback --
KID
FA! He caught Percy Dolarhyde!
SHERIFF KYLE TAGGART rears up on his horse. Tall, dark and
handsome despite a SADNESS in his eyes, already dismounting:
SHERIFF TAGGART
Emmett -- you all right?
The Kid (now EMMETT) strides towards his father excitedly:
10.
EMMETT
YOU-SHOULDA-SEEN-IT-HE-TOSSED-PERCY-L IKE-
a-f lap jack- then-stared-down-Nat-Colorado-
like-he-wasn't-even-scared!!!!
Taggart turns to The Man now, cautious, but grateful --
SHERIFF TAGGART
Pardon my boy, mister. He can be
excitable.
(puts out his hand)
Kyle Taggart.
The Man shakes Taggart's hand. A beat. Then --
THE MAN IN BLACK
. Luke.
SHERIFF TAGGART
Well I'm in your debt, Luke. Tune of
fifty dollars, actually.
(off The Man's look)
Our advert? The telegram?
The Man NODS -- Oh, RIGHT.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
Could use a man like you in case any of
'em come back...
THE MAN IN BLACK
-- I'm just passing through.
SHERIFF TAGGART
Fair enough. You don't mind spending the
night, bank opens in the morning... I'll
get you your money then.
(nods down the street)
Saloon's got rooms. You just tell Maria
I sent you.
The Man tips his hat, nods to Emmett (still STARSTRUCK), turns
to go. Taggart furrows his brow as the DOG scampers after him.
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D)
You here with the prospector woman?
The Man stops. Intrigued. Turns back --
THE MAN IN BLACK
woman?
SHERIFF TAGGART
Yup. Real looker. Came into town
yesterday with that there dog. She a
friend of yours?
11.
ON THE MAN. His first real LEAD.
THE MAN IN BLACK
Maybe.
And as The Man heads off, we HOLD ON TAGGART, his spidey-sense
tingling that all is not RIGHT with this...
DEPUTY WADE
Somethin' wrong, Kyle?
SHERIFF TAGGART
What's that French sayin' where you swear
you seen someone before?
DEPUTY WADE
Don't speak French.
SHERIFF TAGGART
No... you sure's hell don't.
Taggart takes one last look at The Man departing as we CUT TO:
300 head of CATTLE under a blood red sky -- BOOM DOWN to THREE
RANCH HANDS by a fire. One's drinking liberally from a BOTTLE;
call him ROY CLANTON. The other two trade glances, nervous:
RANCH HAND #1
Should take it easy there, Pal --
RANCH HAND #2
Mr. Dolarhyde don't like it when we drink
on the job.
ROY CLANTON
I don't give a damn what he don't like --
gotta sit here and babysit a damn herd of
cattle. Dolarhyde ain't gonna do squat.
(rises; grabs his
CROTCH)
Gotta see a man about a buffalo...
He lets out a big BURP and stumbles off behind a ridge. More
THUNDER. Something doesn't feel right. A sudden WHOOSH and --
A COW'S PULLED INTO THE AIR BEHIND THEM BY SOME INVISIBLE FORCE,
JUST LIKE THE APACHES IN OUR OPENING! Flies STRAIGHT UP, out of
FRAME. Its PLAINTIVE MOO blending into all the others:
RANCH HAND #1
You hear that?
RANCH HAND #2
Hear what?
12.
ANOTHER COW zips up from the herd behind them. And ANOTHER.
MANY OF THE SWSSHS. The men slowly turn toward the sound as --
ALL AT ONCE, HUNDREDS OF COWS FLY OFF INTO THE SKY!
RANCH HAND #1
SWEET JESUS!!!
THE DARKNESS EXPLODES WITH EERILY BRILLIANT BLUE LIGHT! THE MEN
SCREAM AS THEY'RE ENGULFED IN IT AND --
ROY CLANTON -- comes RUNNING back up the hill, pulling up his
pants as the light DISAPPEARS -- to find the men GONE. So are
the COWS. PULL BACK... he's ALL THAT'S LEFT in the open range.
POV: UPSIDE DOWN, A MAN, surrounded by his RANCH HANDS -- his
FACE just out of the light, hat brim lowered under an oil lamp:
DOLARHYDE
Name's Woodrow Dolarhyde. I'm what you
might call, the Tall Hog at the trough.
14.
His face comes INTO light: 50's, tailored finery, patent leather
Wellington boots that bespeak wealth. HARD. Exudes POWER:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
You're Roy, right? Clanton, is it? Been
working for me two weeks now, and I
haven't had the pleasure.
Our POV belongs to ROY CLANTON, the ranch hand from the cow
abductions. TERRIFIED -- his arms and legs TIED TO THE SADDLES
OF TWO HORSES, kicking dirt in front of Dolarhyde's RANCH HOUSE:
CLANTON
Mr. Dolarhyde, I... I swear I didn't
STEAL YOUR--
-- a VIOLENT "SSST" from Dolarhyde JOSTLES the horses --
STRETCHING Roy tight enough to SNAP -- he SCREAMS --
DOLARHYDE
Best not to interrupt me, Roy, makes the
horses skittish.
(THEN)
You partial to history? Here's a primer,
LISTEN CLOSE:
He pulls out a WHIP, gripping it by its STERLING SILVER HANDLE.
Starts CIRCLING the horses as he lets the whip UNFURL:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
Following the War Of Northern Aggression
-- what some ironically refer to as the
"Civil" War -- came a prodigious nation-
wide market for beef. Cowtowns sprang up
all along these prairies, Roy; populated
by enterprising young drovers -- among
'em, my daddy, Jeremiah Dolarhyde. Sold
six of his gold teeth and a sword gifted
to him by Robert E. Lee for twenty of the
scrawniest Longhorns you ever saw -- then
turned 'em into the fattest herd West of
the Chisholm Trail.
(stops: the WHIP)
Watched him work this lash, driving those
steer til his fingers bled... but what
good's a whip without a herd, Roy?
And slowly, torturously, SWEEPS the whip tip in the dirt...
ROY CLANTON
Mr. Dolarhyde, Sir, you gotta believe me
-- I went to take a piss and and -- saw a
light in the sky -- blue -- and when I
ran back the cows and fellas were gone!
15.
DOLARHYDE
The sky. Opened up. And took my cows.
Incoming HOOFBEATS -- Dolarhyde looks up to see COLORADO and the
rest of the GANG returning from Absolution.
A WOMAN emerges from the servant's quarters. APACHE. 50's.
Beautiful. As the men REAR, Nat Colorado MEETS EYES with her.
A relationship we don't understand yet as Dolar strides up --
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
Where's Percy?
NAT COLORADO
Jail. Sheriff locked him up.
Dolar darkens. Unsheathes a KNIFE. Looks down at Roy:
DOLARHYDE
When're these people gonna lgarn?
He STABS the knife down... SLICING the rope tethered to Roy's
FEET. His lower body SLUMPS to the ground, he breathes a SIGH:
ROY CLANTON
THANK Y--
Dolar SLAPS the horse's rump, to which Roy's UPPER TORSO is
tied; it GALLOPS off, dragging a SCREAMING ROY into the night.
DOLARHYDE
Everyone saddle up. Got us a sheriff to
kill.
As he MOVES OFF, Dolarhyde's eyes go to the Apache Woman.
Something passes between them. She seems CONCERNED.
NAT COLORADO
Wasn't the sheriff, got him caught. It
was a stranger.
That STOPS Dolarhyde. He turns back, face dark:
DOLARHYDE
... What stranger?
NAT COLORADO
Usually a man gives off a scent. Where
he's been. What he's done.
(STILL SPOOKED)
He didn't have one.
OFF DOLARHYDE, EYES BURNING --
16.
EMMETT'S FACE rises into frame, peering into the saloon from
below a windowsill. Sees THE MAN IN BLACK at the bar as ---
A PRISON WAGON pulls up in front of the Sheriff's office, along
with Taggart's GUNMEN on horseback. ELLA takes frame as the men
dismount and head into the office -- she pursues DEPUTY WADE
with a real sense of PURPOSE:
ELLA
I need to see Lonergan. It's important.
DEPUTY WADE
'Fraid not, Miss -- we're preppin' him
for transport.
And pushes PAST her, into the office with the men. HOLD on Ella
-- dammit, she NEEDS to find a way in there.
21.
Against the RISING SUN, Dolarhyde and 15 GUNMEN ride hard, armed
to the teems. They REAR in the hills above Absolution. Dolar
looks down through BINOCULARS as NAT COLORADO turns to...
an incoming WIND. Across the valley, a massive BLACK CLOUD
is starting to SWIRL. Violent BLUE FLASHES within. Eerie.
GREAVEY
blue light... Clanton said he saw
blue light before the cows disappeared...
DOLARHYDE
Just a storm.
23.
COLORADO
No storm I've ever seen... I say we wait
'til it passes.
But Dolar isn't listening. THROUGH HIS BINOCULARS: he sees
PERCY being carried into the prison wagon. Followed by Jake.
DOLARHYDE
No time, they put him in an iron coach.
With a HYA! he's OFF, the others FOLLOWING with reluctant looks
-- still SPOOKED by that incoming STORM:
As Jake's loaded into the prison wagon after the still-
unconscious Percy, he SEES MEACHAM through the barred window.
The preacher flashes SYMPATHY as Wade takes out the cuff key:
DEPUTY WADE
Gimme your wrist.
Jake holds out his hands. Wade unlocks one wrist, freeing a
cuff... then takes that cuff and LOCKS IT to Percy's wrist.
JAKE
What're you --?
CHARLIE
Best way to make a man stay put: chain
him to his enemy.
(A GRIN)
You lovebirds have a nice trip now.
SLAM: the door CLOSES and LOCKS. Jake SIGHS and tries to sit
back, but it's hard tethered to Percy's slumped form. Shit.
Then QWW -- something starts to STING and he looks down:
HIS BRACELET. Has started PULSING RED. And it's getting WARM.
Jake stares -- ON EDGE -- what the hell's happening? As --
OUTSIDE, Taggart mounts the buckboard. EMMETT feeds the horses:
EMMETT
You sure he's a bad guy, Pa? He did give
Percy a lickin'.
SHERIFF TAGGART
He's bad enough.
EMMETT
(not so sure, but --)
. can I come with you?
SHERIFF TAGGART
Too dangerous.
24.
EMMETT
Dangerous to drive a damn coach? Why
can't Charlie just take him?
SHERIFF TAGGART
Because it's my job, Emmett. That's what
these people pay me to do. And your
mother would kill me if I brought you.
Emmett looks off, half sad, half angry --
EMMETT
Good thing she's already dead then.
And turns without a goodbye. Taggart watches him leave, wishing
he could connect. Takes the reins and looks up -- REACTS:
THAT MASSIVE. FRIGHTENING CLOUD IN THE SKY -- roiling faster
toward town. The scary BLUE FLASHES within grow more INTENSE.
IN THE COACH -- WITH JAKE, looking at the BRACELET, the pulsing
growing MORE FREQUENT -- and then, a VOICE:
ELLA (0.S. )
HEY!
Jake turns to see ELLA, pushed up against the coach window:
ELLA (CONT'D)
Tell me where you got that bracelet...
JAKE
Maybe you should'a asked before you
knocked me out..
ELLA
Please... I need to know. Just tell me
where you got it.
JAKE
Y dOli' .xBmbgX - - I don' t remember my
name or where I've been or any of the
things they said I done, so leave me the
hell alone.
And sits back as the coach starts to MOVE, leaving Ella in the
dust. Some of the gunmen ride atop it; others on horseback
cover the coach in a protective ring.
Wade sees something incoming from the NORTH:
DEPUTY WADE
KYLE!!!
Taggart looks up: Dolarhyde's gang racing down the mountain --
25.
SHERIFF TAGGART
DAMNIT --
He unslings his SHOTGUN as his men ready their weapons --
ON DOLARHYDE'S GANG, riding hard, guns ready too --
This is about to get UGLY. BUT... from the OTHER end of town,
the WIND picks up --
As the massive storm cloud seems shockingly to have STORED AT A
H -- its EYE churning, ROARING and... TWO BOLTS OF BLUE
LIGHTNING CRACK DOWN FROM IT! Happy starts BARKING MADLY. Ella
sees the lightning and starts to BACK AWAY in fear:
ELLA
NonoNO -- GET TO YOUR CELLARS! EVERYONE
UNDERGROUND NAT!
But her cries are LOST as -- RRRRRRRR!!!!!
A LONG, NARROW FUNNEL SHOOTS FROM THE CHURNING CLOUD: A TORNADO!
BREAKING THE MOMENTUM OF THE SHOWDOWN --
The stagecoach UPENDS, FLIPPING SIDEWAYS as the animals try to
break free -- Taggart and his men are THROWN --
Inside, Jake and Percy TUMBLE end-over-end -- SLAMMING into
walls, LOCKED TOGETHER -- JARRING Percy back to consciousness --
Dolarhyde's men are THROWN from their horses too as the animals
STAMPEDE OFF in different directions --
THE 1Q8k=O ENGULFS THE TOWN! THE CONCUSSIVE BLAST BUCKLES
BUILDINGS, PULLING WHOLE SECTIONS OF THEM INTO THE SKY!
THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE. SHERIFF'S STATION. BROTHEL. WOOD
STRIPPED RIGHT OFF THEIR FALSE FRONTS LIKE PIANO KEYS!
Okay, wait. Just wait. Take a breath. 'Cause it's
about ... . to get... . MORE insane...
TEN MANTA RAY-SHAPED HOVER-SPEEDERS BURST FROM THE CYCLONE!
ROARING into the town, FLYING just above ground --
TOWNSPEOPLE'S FACES -- GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE -- 19TH
CENTURY BRAINS TRYING TO PROCESS THE IMPOSSIBLE --
MEACHAM
Jesus God!!
STRANGE STEEL RINGS fire from the speeders and mushroom out --
KA-CHING! -- SNAP OPEN and CLAMP around necks, arms, legs -- and
from these steel collars, CABLES LASH OUT, whip-snapping back to
the speeders and TETHERING MAGNETICALLY to them --
26.
Yeah-these are HIGH-TECH LASSOS:
HELPLESS VICTIMS ARE YANKED OFF THE GROUND AND PULLED BEHIND THE
SPEEDERS LIKE ROPED STEER! Two of TAGGART'S GUNMEN. Now some
of DOLARYHYDE' S. Screaming, just gone. THIS IS A...Qlp lam.
EMMETT -- stunned -- as SHERIFF TAGGART runs for him --
SHERIFF TAGGART
EMMETT !
Emmett runs into his dad's embrace --
EMMETT SHERIFF TAGGART
What's happening?! -- Stay _by-mvside!
A_LIVERY_STABLE -- the HORSES stamp in their stalls as Taggart
tears the door open and rushes Emmett inside; as he's about to
follow... am c1:t lU 01 If
EMMETT
PA!!
-- a STEEL CABLE fires from the collar, SNAPS TAUT as it
connects to a speeder and WHOOSH! Taggart's RIPPED off his
feet, dragged away -- ELLA tackles the boy as ANOTHER RING zooms
overhead, locks around a FLEEING WOMAN -- she's TAKEN --
EMMETT (CONT'D)
THEY TOOK HIM! LEMME 9Q11!!
ELLA
HE'S GONE!
EMMETT
NO HE'S N--
ELLA
LISTEN TO ME! YOU WANNA LIVE?!! WHERE'S
THERE A CELLAR?! TAKE ME TO IT!
-- HE'S COMING INTO FOCUS -- TEARS IN HIS EYES --
EMMETT
BIRDCAGE THEATER!
With a "C'MON!!!" she rushes him through the FRENZIED CROWD --
ELLA -- hurrying Emmett toward the theater's CELLAR DOOR, but a
SPEEDER circles around and ROARS toward them --
ON JAKE. He SEES this -- and suddenly, to HIS surprise as much
as OURS... HIS BRACELET ACTIVATES! METAL COMING TO LIFE,
coiling up around his arm -- WHAT? HOW? -- as it becomes...
A SMART GUN BLASTER WE PON! A HOLOGRAPHIC SCOPE MATERIALIZES,
tracking that speeder as it DESCENDS on Ella and the mother and:
BALLLLAMMMI THE BLASTER FIRES A PULSE, VAPORIZING THE SPEEDER
MID-AIR! THE RECOIL HURTLES JAKE BACK 15 FEET, INTO A WALL.
Ella reaches the CELLAR DOOR with Emmett. LOCKED. Sees a
HATCHET in a stump -- rips it out and HAMMERS the lock to bits:
ELLA
Everyone inside! GO GO GO!!
Ushering Emmett and TOWNSFOLK underground, PULLS the door SHUT --
JAKE stumbles up... as a speeder FIRES A RING AT HIM. But
reflexively, his WRIST WEAPON FIRES ANOTHER BLAST, vaporizing
it! He looks down at the blaster: "Hell y ."
Another speeder circles around -- KABOOM! The blaster's
incredible firepower SPIRALS THE SPEEDER OUT OF CONTROL, it
CRASHES INTO:
As Jake keeps FIRING, the last speeders turn tail and RETREAT --
disappearing back INTO THE TORNADO as the cloud overhead OPENS
UP and INHALES the swirling mass, which spirals to the heavens.
... GONE. The massive cloud seems to VAPORIZE and the DESERT
SUN returns... debris flutters... smoke clears...
And all... is... STILL.
As our CAMERA RISES to reveal... HALF THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN
SUCKED INTO THE SKY.
29.
From the rubble, SURVIVORS EMERGE: EMMETT and ELLA from the
cellar with inhabitants. DOLARHYDE. DOC. Al in SHOCK:
DOC
Maria -- oh God-- they t-took her-- What
just...?
MOANS, WAILS... desperate cries as people search for loved ones.
JAKE'S BLASTER -- RETRACTS, folding in on itself -- shrinks down
to size, reverting back into a BRACELET. He's stunned. So are
the remaining townsfolk. DOLARHYDE is first to speak:
DOLARHYDE
Who the hell're ?
NAT COLORADO
He's the one who caged Percy.
Dolarhyde starts MOVING toward Jake -- wild killer eyes --
DOLARHYDE
Whatwere__tho_se__thinae?
JAKE
-- why're you asking m&?!
Dolarhyde GRIPS Jake's arm -- THE BRACELET:
DOLARHYDE
This! Where'd you get this?! It was
shooting the same light beams they were --
JAKE
Let go of my wrist.
DOLARHYDE
-- I'm not lettin' go of nothin' til you
tell me what the he--
KA-LLLANG!! Suddenly that CHURCH BELL comes HURTLING out of the
church wreckage, PLOWS through debris. People scatter. And out
of the church stumbles...
AN ALIEN. 8 FT. TALL. Standing upright, limbs inverted --
limbs that DRAG, wounded, as people SCREAM and RUN and Jake and
Dolarhyde can only stare, jaws dropped, and the monster LUNGES:
WHUPWHUP -- something SPINNING through the air -- A HATCHET ---
SCHLUCK!!!! -- EMBEDDING IN THE ALIEN'S HEAD! WHIP TO --
ELLA, hang iust hurled it. The alien lets out a DEATH RATTLE
then FALLS FORWARD, the hatchet embedding deeper as it HITS THE
DIRT. Holy SHIT.
30.
Ella's adrenaline dynamo starts to die down, replaced now by
SHOCK. And for what seems like the first time, FEAR. She
EXHALES a crazy breath, stumbles back... as slowly... people
converge around the corpse:
EMMETT
Is it... dead?
Jake KICKS the alien. It doesn't move. Happy BARKS --
DOLARHYDE
. The hell j,,a it?
MEACHAM (O.S.)
A demon.
They all turn to see MEACHAM. TERRIFIED.
MEACHAM (CONT'D)
Revelations 16:14: "For there are
spirits of demons, showing signs."
(points to the alien)
Escaped from hell itself.
EMMETT
Lookit its wrist! It's got one'a those
bracelet things too!
Indeed, there on the creature's wrist is an IDENTICAL BRACELET.
ON JAKE. Mind tumbling. He meets eyes with ELLA. Her face as
EAGER as his to understand this and now... BEEP. BEEP. BEEP.
What's that SOUND? Everyone looks at each other. Colorado
bends closer to the corpse... SCARED...
NAT COLORADO
I think... it's comin' from somewhere
inside it.
People look at each other: WHAT NOW? Trying to control the near-
hysteria they all feel. Finally, Dolarhyde takes a BREATH --
more BRAVADO than actual courage:
DOLARHYDE
Only one way to find out. We need to cut
it open.
(TO DOC)
You're a doctor. Got a bone saw?
DOC snaps out of his stupor, looks up, FREAKED --
DOC
. Are you... serious?
(looks to them all)
WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?!?
31.
DOLARHYDE
Wake u Those things took your wife --
DOC
I KNOW THAT!!
DOLARHYDE
Well this one here's our only chance of
findin' where they went.
That LANDS on all of them. A long beat. Doc looks down at the
thing, ORANGE GOO dribbling around the AXE in its head...
DOLLARHYDE
So you got a bone saw or don't you?
Jake moves FAST past blown-out STOREFRONTS as Ella PURSUES:
ELLA
That's it? You're just gonna run away?
JAKE
No, Sister. I'm walking away.
ELLA
Well s w.
As he keeps on walking, Ella picks up a ROCK, wings it at the
back of his HEAD -- WHAMI Jake stumbles forward, TURNS AROUND --
JAKE ELLA
SONOVA-- -- I told you to gyp.
Ella strides forward, picking up another rock on the move --
JAKE
What's your damn problem?!
ELLA
You're comin' with us.
JAKE
I'm not coming anywhere. And you throw
that rock I swear I'll--
WHAM! The rock glances off his shoulder --
ELLA
If you're walkin' away from here, what
the hell're you walking tsQ?
That PENETRATES as Jake realizes he doesn't really KNOW. And
that's the last thing he's gonna admit --
JAKE
What the hell are you walkin' to, Lady?
'Cause if I heard right, it sounds like
suicide to me.
-- now it's her turn to pause. Cryptically:
37.
ELLA
I... just wanna help these people.
JAKE
Bullshit. You wanna help yourself. Saw
your face light up the minute you knew
that thing might lead you to gold.
And the fact that he's BUSTED her gets Ella's hackles up --
ELLA
It's not gold I want, you dumb
sonofabitch, it's what it'll buy me.
JAKE
And what's that?
ELLA
Remange.
Whatever that means, it's a deep, painful LONGING in her. She
stares at him, DEAD ON:
ELLA (CONT'D)
And lookin' at you? I'd bet a silver
dollar... its what you want, too.
With that, Ella turns and STRIDES OFF as we HOLD ON JAKE, face
knotted in conflict. As her words RESONATE.
MEACHAM (V.0.)
Was the Devil come to Absolution... come
to drag our town down to hell...
SERIES OF SHOTS - AS DUSK TAI .t $. TQ .NIGItT:
Though BURNING EMBERS, Emmett helps a LITTLE GIRL pull her half-
burnt DOLL from the rubble...
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D)
but our town's not just a buncha
buildings, Brothers and Sisters --
Nossir. Our town is fie. Good, God-
fearing souls. Pure and hopeful. And
the devil can't never take that away...
Ella and Doc tend to WOUNDED PEOPLE in a triage area as...
Meacham finds his overturned PULPIT. Determination in his eyes,
he pushes it UPRIGHT:
AND NOW WE CATCH UP TO WHERE MEACHANL'S VOICE 1S_CQMING FRUM:
He's standing on the pulpit in the rubble, his words a
sermon/call-to-arms -- every survivor GATHERED AROUND:
38.
MEACHAM (CONT'D)
In times of darkness, God asks that we
come together so we may stand and fight.
So we're goin' after our kin. Any of you
aren't able or prepared, no shame in it.
Head up to Fort Huachuca, join up with
the garrison there and pray... Rest of us
ride out at sun-up to recover that which
we have lost.
SUNRISE: Pistol chambers SPINNNN -- rifles are COCKED --
MEACHAM (V.0.) (CONT'D)
Thy will be done, Lord, and there's an
amen behind it.
Lo and behold, most of the town survivors are just too damn
scared. They form an EXODUS LINE, heading off toward the fort.
Dolarhyde, Colorado and his REMAINING MEN (6) load the ALIEN
CORPSE onto the back of a WAGON. Some of them trade glances --
DAMN WORRIED about staying. Dolarhyde sees it:
DOLARHYDE
Somebody got something to say?
His withering GLARE keeps them from speaking up. Doc and
Meacham climb onto the wagon:
MEACHAM
(THE ALIEN)
Sure we need to bring that thing along?
Doc nods as he TWISTS the forceps in the Alien's eye, the
COMPASS HOLOGRAM flickering to life before them:
DOC
If this arrow points me back to Maria?
Yeah -- J'm sure.
Emmett appears leading a PONY, a BOW and quiver of ARROWS slung
around his back:
MEACHAM
Can't come, Emmett, too dangerous.
EMMETT
I can protect myself -- shoot, I'm the
only master bowman in my archery club.
Won the county tournament by shootin' a
flipped nickel at 50 paces.
MEACHAM
Somethin' tells me these things don't
carry nickels, son. Answers's no.
39.
EMMETT
You want me to ride off with the
chickenshits, then double back, be happy
to. But let's just skip that part and
get to it, Padre.
And that's the truth. Meacham sighs, no choice... finally:
MEACHAM
Go fill your canteen, dammit.
He SLAPS the reins and the wagon rides off. Emmett GRINS and
mounts the pony, then sees... JAKE riding past. ANGRY EYES from
Ella as she heels her horse and TROTS OFF angrily:
ELLA
C'mon, Happy.
But HAPPY remains, torn between them, tail wagging and looking
up at Jake as if to say: PLEASE COME?
JAKE
Oh shut up.
Suppressing GUILT, he rides on toward the hills -- as Dolarhyde
VEERS his horse in front of Jake, cutting him off:
DOLARHYDE
I was ridin' into town to kill you for
what you done to my son. You owe me your
life, Boy.
(BEAT)
Ride with us, we'll call it square.
His hand rests on his nickel-plated .38. Eyes gleaming cruelly.
JAKE
You that fast?
DOLARHYDE
FAST ENOU--
-- WHOOSH: Jake's hand is already UP with his own PISTOL, having
drawn before Dolarhyde can finish his sentence:
JAKE
Now you owe me y.Q= life. We're square.
In a DAZZLING TWIRL, Jake slaps it back in his holster. Point
made, he RIDES ON. Dolarhyde, burning mad at having been out-
drawn, turns to CULOBAI)U -- speaks LOW:
DOLARHYDE
Follow him. Soon as he's got his back
turned... kill him.
40.
Shit. Colorado hesitates. Dolar GLARES: "Do it." Finally
Colorado NODS acquiescence, moves off...
JAKE -- on the OUTSKIRTS of town now -- riding past Meacham and
Doc on the WAGON:
MEACHAM
Figure out which way you're headed yet?
JAKE
West. Saguaro Pass.
MEACHAM
That's not what I meant.
The inference LANDS on Jake. But he's in no mood. GALLOPS off.
Meacham watches Jake go... MUSIC RISES AS WE DISSOLVE THROUGH:
JAKE -- RIDING HARD THROUGH THE DESERT:
A man running from his demons, or maybe toward them... through
plains and pasturage... until he sees the tilted ROAD SIGN:
"SAGUARO PASS." Up ahead, he sees DEBRIS...
Part of a ROOF, lying broken on the ground. Pieces of a STONE
CHIMNEY. Jake comes over a rise... to REVEAL:
A DESTROYED LOG CABIN. Walls partially TORN AWAY. Something in
Jake is DEEPLY STIRRED. Dismounts, tentatively... walks up to
the PORCH. Boots CRUNCH over broken window glass as they ENTER:
-- we CUT WIDE on the cabin as a GUNSHOT CRACKS. A flock of
BIRDS screech into the sky from the overgrown corn field...
DISSOLVE TO:
The rest of our people RIDE along, following the ever-tilting
HOLOGRAPHIC ARROW, their COMPASS, floating from the dead alien's
eye in the back of the wagon.
Greavey, Dolar's ranch hand, heels up to ELLA. COCKY SWAGGER:
GREAVEY
So... what's a pretty lady like y--
ELLA
-- you finish that sentence, I shoot you
in your beef whistle.
Doc, sipping from his canteen, does a SPIT TAKE. Ella's eyes
DRILL Greavey. Cut down a peg, he tips his hat, red-faced:
GREAVEY
Ma'am.
And rides past her, taking us to EMMETT and DOLARHYDE:
DOLARHYDE
Tell me somethin', Kid... why didn't your
father just take my money?
EMMETT
(CONFUSED)
What money?
UOLARHY DE
offered him a thousand dollars to leave
town. He could's taken you outta harm's
way, relocated... found you a new momma.
And this just BURNS Emmett. A beat; then:
44.
EMMETT
Is it true Percy's momma died givin'
birth to him, Mister Dolarhyde?
Something FLASHES in Dolarhyde. But he's contained:
DOLARHYDE
Yeah.
EMMETT
Then maybe you should use that thousand
dollars to buy yourself a new wife.
Emmett HOLDS his look against Dolarhyde's. Brave and
UNFLINCHING. Doc can't help but grin at the kid's moxie... but
it's short-lived as his face suddenly falls:
DOC
Madre Dios...
And we PAN AROUND, dropping over his shoulder to see what he's
reacting to --
AN ENORMOUS CRATER. ACRES WIDE... TWENTY FEET DEEP. Even
Dolarhyde looks nervous now:
DOLARYHYDE
What the... hell is it?
MEACHAM
It was Winfield's Landing.
They turn to see Meacham, brushing the DUST off a WOODEN SIGN:
Holds it UP. " Winfield's Landing... Population 133."
ON GREAVEY AND THE MEN. Shit. He doesn't mean...?
GREAVEY
You tryin' to tell me those... things
pulled the whole damn town into the sky?
And suddenly a weird CRACK shakes the canyon -- like the SOUND
BARRIER BREAKING -- everyone's look goes UP where:
SWIRLING, DARK CLOUDS LOOM. The same clouds that dropped the
tornado on Absolution. And that appeared in Jake's MEMORIES at
the cabin. But this time, something's SHOT OUT from them --
MEACHAM
That can't be good.
The plummeting object HITS a distant dune, kicking up a SAND
PLUME -- ROLLING TOWARD THEM --
DOLARHYDE
Scatter.
45.
-- everyone runs their horses aside as the object BOUNCES over
rocks -- then SLOWS... to a STOP.
They STARE. Finally Dolarhyde kicks his horse forward slowly...
DISMOUNTS, draws his GUN. What he sees is SHOCKING:
It's an OVAL CAPSULE OF BLUE GOO, the outer layer some kind of
TRANSLUCENT COCOON. Suspended within the murky Jell-o is a
GE, DEC SHAPE. Motionless. UH-OH.
The others draw guns too, converging around it in equal SHOCK
and FEAR. But the thing doesn't MOVE.
DOC
Should we... open it?
DOLARHYDE
Should we open it? Hell NO we shouldn--
EMMETT
-- oops --
-- and now we find Emmett's already POKING it with a stick, a
Small TEAR in the cocoon's outer embryonic layer -- GOO leaks --
then it RUPTURES, EXPLODING as the horses REAR away, WHINNYING
the goo spreads across the desert floor, thinning out.
BEAT. Everyone wipes blue shit off their clothes as they come
FACE-TO-FACE with the object inside, lying there on the ground:
A COW. YES, A COW.
Motionless. DEAD, in fact. A METAL TUBE jammed in its mouth,
connected to a VALVE in the now-flaccid bubble's outer shell.
Greavey notices a BRANDING on the cow's rump -- the letter "D":
GREAVEY
Boss... it's one'a yours.
Dolarhyde's eyes NARROW. Emmett looks at Doc, SCARED:
EMMETT
Is-- is this what happened to my Pa?
Doc dismounts. Moves to the cow's mouth and PULLS OUT THAT TUBE
with a wet SQUISHING sound. Thinking it through:
DOC
This was stuck down its throat... to help
it breathe. That means they wanted to
keep it alive, Emmett.
(forces a small smile)
I'm sure your father is fine.
But Doc's eyes aren't sure. Meacham looks back to the sky:
46.
MEACHAM
Why'd they dump it?
ELLA
Whatever they needed from it, they
must've got.
(THEN)
Gonna get dark soon, need to keep moving.
She does. The others FOLLOW in a chilled daze. The last is
DOLARHYDE, glancing back at his dead cow with angry eyes...
DISSOLVE TO:
Now our people APPEAR riding up a ridge... Dolarhyde shoots up a
HAND, bringing the caravan to a STOP. Once again, SHOCK:
EMMETT
Ho-ly shit.
BOOM UP to reveal a SURREAL SIGHT in the valley below:
AGAMBLING RIVERBOAT. Nose buried in the sand, paddlewheels
facing the sky, as if it'd been dropped from the clouds into the
desert. Just like that cow. Off their LOOKS --
TRACKING alongside of the TILTED PADDLEBOAT, our team rides
around it. Trying to make SENSE. STENCILED on the stern is...
DOC
"Colorado Queen."
(THEN)
The river's two hundred miles from here.
But Ella doesn't seem as impressed as the rest of them. In
fact, her attention is drawn BEHIND them, to something coming up
over the DUNES... the barest flicker of a smile --
ELLA
Son of a bitch.
IT'S JAKE ON HORSEBACK. Followed by another horse, with
COLORADO in the saddle. Wrists tied but ALIVE. As Jake rides
to a stop, he PUSHES Colorado off the horse -- the indian HITS
the ground with a THUD as Jake levels Dolarhyde with HARD EYES:
JAKE
Your man got it in his head that he was
s'posed to kill me. I'm holding onto his
ear 'til he says sorry.
47.
As Colorado stumbles to his feet angrily, humiliated, Dolar
notices his BLOODY EAR. The LOBE has been SHOT OFF. He looks
up at Jake, half-angry, half-EMBARRASSED --
DOLARHYDE
Why'd you let him live?
Jake's hard-as-nails. DRIVEN now --
JAKE
Gonna need him.
He rides past Dolar to Ella. Stops. Says, simply:
JAKE (CONT'D)
Nice boat.
(then... SNIFFS)
What's that smell?
ELLA
That'd be me.
He realizes her shirt's caked in the BLUE GOO from the cow.
JAKE
Why're you blue?
ELLA
(DRYLY)
Cause I missed ya.
Their look HOLDS. A MOMENT. Something REAL between them.
DOLARHYDE
We better keep movin'.
A THUNDERCRACK. On the horizon, sheets of RAIN.
JAKE
Storm's comin'. I say we dig in here til
it passes.
(to Colorado; fucking
WITH HIM)
How's that sound, Nat?
Nat BURNS. Dolar feels his AUTHORITY being undermined:
DOLARHYDE
Storm or no storm, I say we keep movin'.
Colorado finally turns to Uolarhyde. DEFIANT:
NAT COLORADO
Too hard tracking anything in the rain.
48.
Dolarhyde GLARES at Colorado, who GLARES BACK: his loyalty now
in QUESTION. The tide IS turning against the rancher.
RAIN POURS on the overturned boat. Horses tethered. The ALIEN
CORPSE has been moved onto a slanted deck, covered by a TARP...
WE TILT TO THE ALIEN'S HAND. Poking out. Motionless. HOLD on
it, longer than we're comfortable.
The boat is a BALL OF FIRE in the pouring rain, as what remains
of our heroes stumble out, COUGHING, devastated... Jake, Doc,
Dolarhyde, Colorado, Greavey, 2 GUNMEN... and Ella and Happy
atop a DUNE, following a TRAIL OF FLUORESCENT ORANGE BLOOD
streaking into the desert. Happy BARKING MADLY. Ella drops to
a knee, touches the orange blood as it WASHES AWAY in the rain:
56.
ELLA
RAIN'S GONNA COVER ITS TRACKS!
NAT COLORADO
That thing... was dead... it was d-ead...
DOLARHYDE, RAIN pouring down his face... VULNERABLE and GUILTY:
DOLARHYDE
I couldn't stop it -- It just... grabbed
the kid.
ON JAKE. Rage-filled against the flames... Meacham's CRUCIFIX
in his hared, as his FIST closes around it. Looks up, HARDCORE:
JAKE
Then we'd better get him back.
SMASH TO:
Our people RIDE FAST against the rising sun, on the hunt for
Emmett. Colorado REARS his horse, kneels by a trace of ORANGE
BLOOD on some rocks.
NAT COLORADO
(looks off --)
West.
Greavey and the others share a LOOK. E o Turn to Dolar --
57.
GREAVEY
Boss, only took one of them things to
kill four of us. We got no chance here.
Dolarhyde BURNS -- knowing he's being ABANDONED --
DOLARHYDE
You're a goddamn coward.
(to the others)
You work for me, dammit. You're my
m e 1 1 Qyees.
And Greavey, finally FREE to speak his mind, says SPITEFULLY:
GREAVEY
Fine line between a coward and a fool.
The men turn tail and RIDE AWAY. Dolarhyde SHOUTS after them --
DOLARHYDE
You're all FIRED!
Doc takes the opportunity to TWIST the knife:
DOC
Looks like they finally found something
to be more scared of than you.
Dolarhyde feels his world CRUMBLING away man by man...
Ella trots alongside Jake, who's staring at that DARK CLOUD MASS
overhead with a bad feeling:
JAKE
Clouds've been moving east since sun-
up... 'cept that one.
ON ELLA. We SENSE she knows something, something more she isn't
saying. SNAPS her reins and they RIDE OFF:
A TARANTULA
61.
Climbing onto an old desert stump -- BLAM! It's SHOT OFF by a
couple DRUNK OUTLAWS, swigging booze from STOLEN WHISKEY CRATES
piled on a WAGON. We're in an OUTLAW CAMP: roughly 40 fast guns
and saddle tramps. Tents. Horses. Ample weapons. And right
now, most of them are GEARING UP to ride out for some reason...
One of them, CREEK JOHNSON, with a chewed up face like swiss
cheese, slides a RIFLE into his saddle and shouts to the drunks:
CREEK JOHNSON
Hey --- s 4 Lay off that whiskey and
saddle up. Flyer's on its way and we
best damn be sober for it.
HUNT (O.S.)
Creek turns; sees HUNT and BRONC crest the hill with the other
OUTLAWS from the cliffs. ANGRILY:
CREEK JOHNSON
'Bout time you got back.
(re: Hunt's bloody nose)
What the hell happened to you?!?
Hunt nods over his shoulder --
HUNT
He did.
The outlaws part to reveal JAKE, riding in with Ella and the
rest of our people. Creek's eyes NARROW, NOT happy to see him:
CREEK JOHNSON
well, shit.
It gets very, VERY QUIET. Our people tread warily, knowing
whatever reaction Jake's eliciting, it AIN'T GOOD. He runs the
gaunt of ACCUSING GLARES. Smart enough to know that CREEK is
the man in charge. Dismounts:
JAKE
You don't look happy to see me, Creek.
Creek eyes him. TOUGH. Clearly, HISTORY here:
CREEK JOHNSON
We're fixin' to rob us a train in about
twenty minutes and you come ridin' in
like nothin' ever happened?
(FUCK YOU)
No. Lonergan. I ain't happy to see you.
ON JAKE. How to navigate bad blood that he doesn't REMEMBER?
62.
JAKE
Well I'm sure you'll get over it.
Then, pretty much DISMISSING Creek, Jake turns, addresses the
rest of the men. If he's their boss? H _gQDn&. CT LIR .T
JAKE (CONT'D)
Nice to see you, Boys, but we're not
going after a train -- We're going after
something else.
The men seem... . CONFUSED. Not sure what the hell is GOING ON.
BRONC
But Jake... you-- you said you didn't
wanna be in charge no more.
And this is a REVELATION. Jake glances at ELLA -- has to keep
IMPROVISING to hold his ground:
JAKE
Well, I-- changed my mind. So saddle the
hell up.
CREEK JOHNSON
They're not going anywhere with you.
Creek's heard enough. Strides forward, a direct CHALLENGE:
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
You got some balls on you -- walkin'
outta here a week ago sayin' what you
said and doin' what you did and then
ridin' back in here and givin orders.
Just who the hell do you think you are?
The IRONY of the question isn't lost on Jake, as Creek walks
right up to Ella. CLOSE. Violates her space: studies her with
a mixture of curiosity and CONTEMPT.
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
So. Are you her?
ELLA
Am I who?
CREEK JOHNSON
The whore Jake quit this gang for.
OH. Another piece of the puzzle falls into place -- Jake's eyes
SNAP to Ella as they both REALIZE... the men think she's
" e." Jake does his best to stay cool, meets Creek's stare:
JAKE
Watch your mouth, Creek.
63.
CREEK JOHNSON
Or what? These boys are with = now.
jID in charge. You may be fast, but you
are goddamned outgunned.
ON JAKE. OUR HEROES. Shit. Jake turns to the men --
JAKE
That a fact, Boys?
But Creek doesn't wait for them to respond:
CREEK JOHNSON
Put your guns on the whore. He so much
as twitches, blow her brains out her ear.
AT ONCE, 10 GUNS ARE LEVELED AT ELLA'S HEAD. No doubt as to who
the men are LOYAL to. But Jake locks into Creek, UNFLINCHING:
JAKE
Call her a whore again, that'll be the
last word you ever say.
CREEK JOHNSON
You ain't in no position to make threats,
asshole. Hunt: take his gun.
Hunt reluctantly scrambles over to Jake, oh-so-carefully pulls
the PISTOL from Jake's holster:
HUNT
Sorry, Boss... nothin' personal.
Creek now turns to BULL MCCADE, roughly the size of a BARN.
CREEK JOHNSON
Put him down, Bull.
And Jake barely has time to react as Bull lets fly with a
JAWBREAKING HAYMAKER that about knocks Jake out of his BOOTSI
Dolarhyde and Colorado WINCE as Jake hits the dirt with a THUD --
Creek striding over, cock of the walk, LEANS over him:
CREEK JOHNSON (CONT'D)
Where the hell's our gold. Jake?
"Gold?" Jake SPITS BLOOD, defiant:
JAKE
Don't remember.
Creek NODS to Bull: SMASH! Another devastating BLOW. ON ELLA --
ELLA'S DRAGGED BEHIND THE SPEEDER. Hands GRASPING at the
magnetic collar as it HALF-CHOKES HER, yet keeps her upper body
SUSPENDED just oft the ground while her heels BOUNCE HARSHLY --
JAKE ON THE HORSE
Riding hard -- aims his BLASTER, trying to get a TARGET on the
CABLE linking Ella's collar to the speeder -- fires -- MISSES!
The Slaver TILTS VERTICAL to fly through a narrow CANYON
ENTRANCE as Ella's fingers reach wildly for THE BOWIE KNIFE on
her belt. She starts CUTTING THE CABLE, trying to FREE HERSELF:
WHOOSH! The speeder BLASTS out the other side of the canyon,
Jake still in pursuit but suddenly...
THE UNION PACIFIC LOCOMOTIVE IS CURVING AROUND A CORNER, RACING
RIGHT FOR THEM! This is the train Jake's gang was gonna rob!
As the speeder SKIMS alongside the train, ELLA keeps struggling
painfully to CUT HER COLLAR CABLE. Jake FIRES again, MISSES the
cable but DETONATES THE SIDE OF A TRAIN CAR:
The speeder's SHAKEN. The Slaver GROWLS as he fights for
balance. Reaches the TRAIN'S END, skims past the caboose and --
DAMNIT. THE SLAVER ARCS BACK AROUND IN A WIDE U-TURN, SLOTTING
IN FOR COVER BEHIND THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TMIN,=_`T1.2AVF.LLING,.J
THE SAME DIRECTION NOW!
ELLA'S FLUNG WILDLY BY THE HAIRPIN TURN! SHE DROPS THE KNIFE,
IT CLATTERS AWAY! HER ONLY MEANS OF ESCAPE GONE!
JAKE'S POV:
Through a slot between boxcars, the speeder BLURS in the
opposite direction. Up ahead comes the CABOOSE. No more TRAIN:
Thinking FAST, Jake LEAPS off his horse -- CATCHES A LADDER RUNG
ON THE CABOOSE'. Teeth gritted, starts to CLIMB up onto:
Jake JUMPS from car to car -- over LOGS in a TENDER CAR --
BLAM BLAM!!! The PINKERTONS are climbing to the roof, WEAPONS
FIRING -- Jake loses footing, ROLLING off the side --
-- but CATCHES another ladder rung and he DANGLES, looks DOWN:
ELLA IS RIGHT UNDER HIM, DRAGGING BEHIND THE SPEEDER! HE
REACHES OUT --
JAKE
TAKE MY HAND!
She GRUNTS WITH EXERTION as their fingers GRAZE each other and
The Slaver SNAPS AROUND. Hurls a SMART DISC at Jake -- no
choice, he LETS GO of the LADDER -- HITS the ground PAINFULLY
THE PINKERTONS RUSH TO THE ROOF EDGE
-- SXLSKLISH! The disc VIVISECTS THEM THEN CIRCLES BACK AROUND,
cutting the IRON STRAPS that secure the logs in the tender car --
70.
THE LOGS START ROLLING OFF THE TOP. CRASHING DOWN ON THE
SPEEDER. It SPIRALS end-over-end, CRASHING into the desert!
ON JAKE. He picks himself up, WINCING. Sees the SMOKING WRECK
in the distance. Starts to limp, then RUN --
Jake APPEARS through the smoke. No sign of The Slaver. Then --
FALLING ROCKS turns his look upward. Though WOUNDED, the alien
is SCALING a rock-face. Turns... a look that says "Next time."
Then in a BLUR, it's GONE. Jake's blaster REVERTS into a
bracelet. When the smoke clears:
ELLA is revealed on the ground, thrown from the speeder. Jake
REACTS -- EQ -- takes her in his arms.
She desperately tries to SAY SOMETHING... but goes LIMP.
JAKE
Ella...?
Her head just falls back. Yeah. Hard to swallow, but it's
true. ELLA'S DEAD. And if this moment ECHOES Jake holding his
dead wife, well that's just fine. He stares beseechingly as...
HOOFBEATS. The rest of our people gallop in: Colorado,
Dolarhyde, Doc and Emmett in the wagon:
EMMETT
Aw no... is she --?
Jake looks up -- unhinged --
NAT COLORADO
We need to get out of here NOT.
JAKE NAT COLORADO
Not gonna leave her here -- L4Re.Xam --
-- I'M NOT LEAVIN' HER! -- This is Apache territory!
They catch us, they'll kill u--
THHHHHHHUNKI The air SCREAMS as an ARROW pierces the ground
inches from Jake's hand! Suddenly THIRTY MORE -- ALL AROUND
THEM -- forming an instant circle perimeter as --
APACHE WARRIORS FLASH DOWNHILL. Dolar dismounts, swings Emmett
to the ground --
NAT COLORADO (CONT'D)
Nobody move.
Jake and Emmett freeze. The Apaches are ALL AROUND THEM.
Fierce. BOWS and TOMAHAWKS drawn -- OFF THIS:
71.
The sun DIPS behind the mountains... NIGHT FALLS...
BAN! Our people are THROWN TO THEIR KNEES in a large CIRCLE OF
APACHES. GUARDED by warriors with tomahawks and -- WHOOSH! A
PYRE is ignited and if we ever had any doubt about Ella being
dead, the BRAVES carry her roughly past --
JAKE
HEY! GODDAMMIT DON'T YOU TOUCH--
-- he's YANKED BACK and held in place as... ELLAIg BODY IS
THROWN RIGHT INTO THE FLAMES. Jake helplessly watches her BURN.
72.
EMMETT
Wasn't your fault, Mr. Lonergan.
Those things... were lookin' for her.
Had a picture and everything.
That breaks the spell. Jake looks over --
JAKE
What d'you mean... 'a picture'?
EMMETT
Floatin', like that arrow thing we found
in its eye.
Before Jake can makes sense of this, a teepee smoke flap OPENS
and out steps the tribe's SACHEM. This is GREY WOLF -- dark,
wrinkled face enhanced by TATTOOS. He takes one look at his
prisoners and SPEAKS A FEW WORDS OF APACHE.
DOC
What'd he say?
COLORADO
"Kill them. And make it quick."
Doc is amply freaked. Turns to Jake as FIVE OF THE BRAVES move
for them, MENACING --
DOC
Now'd be a good time to use your gun
bracelet, my friend.
But Jake is VACANT. BROKEN. All the fight seems GONE from him.
His bracelet DOESN'T MOVE.
Dolarhyde's grabbed first... PULLED FORWARD by one of the
braves, raising his TOMAHAWK -- they're really gonna KILL HIM --
DOLARRYDE
(SUBTITLED)
SOP. DON'T DO THIS.
SURPRISED looks from just about everyone in the camp (besides
Colorado) as we realize Dolarhyde just spoke APA
ON GREY WOLF -- INTRIGUED as he approaches Dolarhyde:
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
How is it that you speak our language?
UOLARHYUE (SUBTITLE)
Because I'm a damn genius.
Grey Wolf's fascinated this man has the audacity to be a WISEASS
given his circumstances. Turns to the Brave with the tomahawk --
73.
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
Forget about quick. Make him feel it.
The Brave NODS, RAISES the Tomahawk again, but Dolar interrupts:
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
Two hundred head of cattle!
Grey Wolf holds up his hand, halting the Brave's death blow --
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D)
I'll have two hundred head of cattle u_a
here in a day's time if you let me go.
ON GREY WOLF. Considering this.
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
And how do I know you'll come back?
Dolarhyde nods to Colorado --
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
You can keep my associate here. if I
don ' t come back, you can kill him.
Colorado REACTS. He's the only one here who knows what the hell
these two are saying to each other as Grey Wolf approaches
Dolar, looks right INTO HIM --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
Why should I believe that you even care
about this man?
Dolarhyde's eyes flash EMOTION. Quickly bottled. Then:
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
Because he's my son.
Wow. Didn't see that one coming. Grey Wolf levels Colorado
with those unyielding eyes --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
Is this true?
And Colorado answers in ENGLISH, for the benefit of the others:
COLORADO
Yeah... he's my father.
REACTIONS. JAKE. EMMETT. DOC. Stunned silence. And so:
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
Three hundred head.
Dolar looks to Colorado, who won't meet his eyes. His FATHER's
eyes. Turns back to Grey Wolf, HARD --
74.
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
Two fifty.
HOLD ON GREY WOLF for a beat. Then --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
Cut him loose.
The Brave does exactly that. Dolar's FREE to go...
EMMETT
Hey! What about =?!?
ON DOLAR. A FLASH of regret. But it's gone fast.
DOLARHYDE
What about you, kid?
And he just walks out of the camp, leaving his son behind...
GONE. And now, it's back to business --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
Kill all of them except the half-breed.
Our people are GRABBED. Jake's yanked forward, PINNED DOWN -- a
Brave raises a HATCHET to kill Jake, who glares back with
lunatic eyes. Ready to die. Almost wanting it:
JAKE
What're you waiting for, asshole? DO IT.
And as Jake's about to MEET HIS DEATH:
FWOOM! THE PYRE SUDDENLY BILLOWS, TURNING FROM ORANGE TO GREEN
TO WHITE -- EVERYONE BACKS AWAY AS --
ELLA EMERGES FROM THE PYRE. WRAPPED IN A CAUL OF FIRE AND LIGHTI
Except she isn't exactly Ella. She's a HUMANOID, incredibly
close to us in physical appearance, her features acutely
feminine, yet... ALJM.
PANDEMONIUM. The Apache kneel in prostration, DROPPING weapons
as flames DISSIPATE off Ella's backlit form. Her skin RETURNS
to human flesh-tone. Hair too. When she finally STOPS, she
looks like the ELLA we've come to know and love. STANDS there:
ELLA
. what... happened?
ON JAKE. Holy. SHIT. Everyone else equally STUNNED.
EMMETT
You... died.
75.
Ella looks around. Fifty dumbstruck faces staring at her.
ELLA
(QUIETLY; CAUGHT)
. oh.
OFF ELLA, who's got a helluva lot to explain --
Ella emerges to find... JAKE. Standing outside.the teepee.
HARD. And for a long moment, nothing is said. Until she takes
a step TOWARD him:
ELLA
If I'd told you on the boat, you never
would'a trusted me --
-- but he takes a step BACK. If he's relieved she's alive, he
isn't showing it:
JAKE
Did you hear what I said?
ELLA
.. What?
JAKE
When you were playin' possum. Did you
hear what I mid?
He's angry. Yes, even embarrassed. And because of it,
something has SHUT DOWN in him again. That killer look is back.
ELLA
No. I was mendin'.
(BEAT)
It's like sleep.
His eyes narrow, trying to understand:
JAKE
How's it you look like one of us?
ELLA
I can look like whatever I want to.
JAKE
So you can't die?
76.
ELLA
Sure I can. If my heart stops beating...
just like you.
.JAKE
You're nothin' like me, Ella. You're
one'a them.
we can see that hurt her. But she deserved it, too. So
desperately wants to reach him...
ELLA
I'm not, Jake. I'm from a different
place.
He isn't sure what that means. Can he even trust her? Either
way, she has ANSWER;. Darkly:
JAKE
The one that took you.
(BEAT)
It killed her.
That LANDS on her. Knowing and painful.
ELLA
They call him The Slaver. He's the one,
gave me the scars. Broke me. And made
me watch... while he killed my family
too.
Even with his guard up... Jake can't help but be STRUCK. As the
sound of HOWLING WIND takes us to:
A SANDSTORM... through which a GHOSTLY FIGURE materializes...
THE SLAVER. Moving with angry purpose toward the CANYON BLUFF.
As he looks down into it, we hear the SOUNDS of MACHINERY below.
But we DO__QT.YET_ REVEAL what it_ is__ he sees.
He stalks down, LEAVING FRAME -- as we HOLD on the field of
TWINKLING STARS ---
ELLA (V.0.)
For every drop of light in the sky,
there's another world. Filled with
life...
Ella's in front of the campfire, surrounded by EVERYONE
77.
ELLA
Our race was first to map the stars...
that's why they came for us. Took our
planet, piece by piece. Slaughtered
anyone who fought hack. Ones who
survived were turned into slaves.
Trackers.
She says this meeting the eyes of GREY WOLF. There's immediate
SIMPATICO here: a story the Indians could be telling.
ELLA (CONT'D)
They brought me aboard one of their scout
ships -- a ship with only one purpose: to
find other planets like mine. Planets
they can take... people they can enslave.
As the terrible gravity of all this HITS everyone, JAKE is first
to understand...
JAKE
X lead 'em here.
Ella swallows. Wracked with GUILT.
EMMETT
Well damn, lady, thanks a 1.
ELLA
I never wanted this.
(an EMOTIONAL beat)
But they got... ways. Of making you do
things.
Her eyes are HAUNTED with memory. The inference is some kind of
TORTURE. She pushes it away -- staying strong:
ELLA (CONT'D)
Been tryin' to make it right... tried to
blow the ship to hell by burnin' up all
their fuel, then escaped down here.
(BEAT)
'Cept it didn't work... damn thing
survived.
JAKE
Where is it.
Jake's determined -- he's got his OWN agenda. Ella looks up to
that OMINOUS CLOUD. Those BLUE LIGHT FLASHES ripple within:
ELLA
Hiding in that cloud. Way I figure,
they'll find enough fuel to leave by
tomorrow, midday. Then they'll bring
back the others.
78.
DOC
"others"?
ELLA
The whole fleet. They'll take what they
need. Everyone on this planet. Anything
too weak to survive... they'll toss.
Like that cow.
Tomorrow. Midday. Hi noon. This is bad, bad news.
NAT COLORADO
What'd you mean, they're looking for
"fuel"...?
And before Ella can answer, Jake already GETS IT:
JAKE
Gold. That's why they're in a mine.
ELLA
(NODS, solemn)
. wherever it is, that's where you
escaped from -- and it's the only way
back up to the ship.
(STEPS CLOSER)
Even with your memory wiped, your
instincts kicked in --
(HIS BRACELET:)
That's how it works, Jake, the bracelet
reads your impulse -- you wanna fight, it
reacts. Somehow you took it off one of
'em... don't you remember any of it?
ON JAKE. Deeply STIRRED. As he looks down at the BRACELET and:
MEMORY FLASBCUTSI REPLAY POV as we're HELD DOWN in that CAVE
the TERRIFYING OCULAR PROBE lowers right in front of our eyes
One of the ALIENS starts to activate the probe -- it begins to
FLASH STEADILY -- HYPNOTICALLY -- PUvTNG OUR MIND --
But our arm manages to BREAK FREE -- a BLADE hidden in our
sleeve -- WE SLASH OFF THE. ALIEN'S HAND -- GRAB THE BRACELET off
its severed limb -- it COILS around our wrist and ACTIVATES:
BLAM SLAM! We BLAST the creature to oblivion -- we're FREE!
JAKE IN PRESENT -- Eyes ALIVE with MEMORY:
JAKE
I-- I blasted my way out...
MEMORY FLASHCUTI REPLAY POV as we RUN through the cavern --
ESCAPE -- a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel -- BLINDING SUN hits
us as we emerge -- our eyes ADJUST to see:
79.
That STRANGE ROCK FORMATION HIGH ABOVE on the edge of a CANYON --
the STONE TOWER pointing to heaven --
JAKE IN PRESENT: The sequencing is COMPLETE for him now:
JAKE (CONT'D)
I remember seeing a tower... made of
stone... on the rim of a canyon...
Upon hearing that, Grey Wolf suddenly speaks in animated
gestures, pointing North. Colorado REACTS:
ELLA
What? What's he sayin'?!?
Colorado turns to Jake, a flicker of HOPE:
COLORADO
That rock you're talkin' about... he-
knows where it is.
Our people ride up a rocky slope with a few Apaches. Grey Wolf
looks around and SPEAKS, Colorado translates:
NAT COLORADO
This is Kiowa land, their sister tribe.
As they near the bluff, Jake sees the STONE TOWER. Dismounts:
JAKE
That's it.
As they near the bluff, they hear the growing sound of that
MACHINERY. Everyone dips low, peering over to see...
81.
What looks a whole lot like a CAVALRY FORT in the canyon below,
amid a network of trenches and underground tunnels. Except this
fortress is made of some kind of ALIEN ALLOY, glowing impossibly
bright as its steel surface reflects the rising sun.
DRILLING MACHINES are chewing deep into the earth, mining for
GOLD -- THESE ARE THE SAME DRILLS THAT LANDED IN OUR OPENING.
Massive receptacles are FILLED with HUGE CHUNKS.
ALIENS move in and out, working, as if from an ant hive.
DOC
Holy Jesus. Like a damn fort.
Grey Wolf looks to his men, GRAVE, CRESTFALLEN as he realizes:
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
The Kiowa... they were taken too.
Suddenly, the ROOF of the steel structure blossoms open like a
CHROME LOTUS... and WHOOSH! The SHUTTLE TRANSPORT flies out of
the canyon, RISING into the dawn sky...
ELLA
Transports. Way they get people and gold
back and forth to the ship.
DOC
Place is crawling with those things.
We'll never even get close.
Grey Wolf SPEAKS --
NAT COLORADO
He says there's a back way in... The Twin
Rivers run underneath this whole canyon.
Limestone tunnels up by the falls, couple
miles East. Lead right down there.
Jake looks to the SKY. DARK. DETERMINED.
JAKE
The Slaver... he's up in that big cloud?
Ella nods, HARD. Off their SHARED DETERMINATION, our SCORE
rises. A DRUM CADENCE that suggests a MISSION starting to form:
DOC. Skeptical, eyes narrow -- staring at Jake and Ella --
surrounded by our team and the Apaches back at the APACHE CAMP:
82.
DOC
Just so I got this straight... three of
those things just kicked the shit out of
your entire gang, took our whole town,
and now you two're gonna ride right into
that fort, try to hijack one'a those--
He pauses on the word --
ELLA
"Transports."
DOC
-- ride it up to that space boat --
ELLA
Spaceshp.
DOC
Then bring it down here and get everybody
off alive? That's your big plan?
Jake and Ella share a LOOK. Simply:
JAKE
Yup.
DOC
And just how do you figure on getting in
there in the first place?
JAKE
Poke a hornet's nest... they swarm
at'cha.
ELLA
You gotta draw 'em out. Buy us a
distraction.
A long beat of incredulous, do-you-believe-this-shit STARES:
DOC
You want us to storm that fort? Against
those things? With less than fifty men?
It's suicide.
EMMETT
It ain't, it's been done! I read at
school how Ethan Allen and his Green
Mountain Boys took Fort Ticonderoga, they
weren't but a small garrison and they
were outgunned --
ELLA
We need all of you to make a stand.
Together. It's the only way.
83.
NAT COLORADO
Make a stand with what?
Jake turns to the WAGON they rode from Jake's gang camp -- the
WHISKEY CRATES. Sweeps up a bottle:
JAKE
This.
An impossible mission. Sure death. Yet for the first time...
they have an ADVANTAGE. Emmett cuts the moment with a BIG GRIN:
EMMETT
Hell, yeah. Let's squish some bugs.
Grey Wolf CHUCKLES, murmurs. Jake looks to Nat for translation:
JAKE
Somethin' funny?
NAT COLORADO
Yeah... that you whites finally know what
it feels like to face extinction. Now
that we're on the same side, he says we
can all die together.
(THEN)
They're with us.
The LOOK holds between them --
JAKE
Guess that means you're not waitin' for
your dad to come back.
Colorado's face CLOUDS. Years of ANGER and RESENTMENT:
NAT COLORADO
Been Woodrow Dolarhyde's son my whole
life... first time he ever copped to it
was to save his own ass.
(not without emotion)
He's not comin' back.
And as Colorado TURNS away, the PERCUSSION finds another GEAR --
MONTAGE -- OUR CLAN PREPARES FOR BATTLE:
Pieces of CLOTH are RIPPED, stuffed inside the WHISKEY BOTTLES.
MOLOTOV COCKTAILS...
Emmett works with Apaches and their KIDS, roping WOOD together
to build LADDERS and CATAPULTS...
WAR PAINT is applied to faces in DARK STREAKS...
84.
Jake slips on his coat. Sees Emmett lead a horse to mount up
with his BOW and ARROW QUIVER:
JAKE
Not you, Kid.
EMMETT
Aw, hell, we been through this. Ya can't
stop me.
Jake draws his gun, SPINS it in his palm, aims at Emmett's FOOT:
JAKE
I can shoot you in the foot.
EMMETT
Bu111i11SHIT.
Jake SIGHS -- bluff called. Holsters the gun and takes a
knee... but just when we think this is gonna be a tender moment,
he GRABS Emmett by the collar, pulls him CLOSE:
JAKE
You told me your daddy's all you got
left. Want me to save his ass?
Then park yours right there on the
ground, you little shit. Got me?
Emmett's nailed. ANGRY, but knows he's gotta stay.
EMMETT
Yeah. I gotcha.
Jake releases him. Happy moves to Ella but she TSKS:
ELLA
Stay with the kid, Happy.
The dog WHINES but complies, moving next to Emmett. Jake climbs
on his horse. Looks back to the boy -- now he Ia tender:
JAKE
I'll get your father back. Bastard still
owes me fifty dollars.
The hint of a SMIRK... long enough for Emmett to SMIRK BACK.
Ella, Doc, and Colorado mount p too, along with a 10-MAN APACHE
WAR PARTY. Jake meets eyes with GREY WOLF:
JAKE (CONT'D)
You'll be ready?
Grey Wolf NODS. Some part of the PLAN we have yet to learn.
And now Jake starts to trot off, Ella beside him. This plays
just between the two of them:
85.
ELLA
That's a nice thing... what you said to
the boy. I didn't know better, I'd say
you got yourself a sweet side.
She smiles. But Jake turns to her -- deadly serious:
JAKE
There's nothin' sweet about me. I told
that kid what he needed to hear so he
wouldn't get in my damn way. All I care
about is killin' that thing.
And Ella reacts to the DARKNESS in his voice. Shakes her head:
ELLA
I don't believe that.
JAKE
Well believe it. I was playing a part.
(straight at her)
Just like you were.
He CRACKS the reins, riding ahead. HOLD ON ELLA... who finally
follows as they all ride out and MUSIC SOARS:
JAKE, ELLA, COLORADO, DOC AND THE APACHE WARRIORS RIDE LIKE HELL
TOWARD THEIR FATE, SLAMMING RIGHT INTO LENS -- AND WE MATCH TO:
THUNDERING HOOVES -- but it's DOLARHYDE on his horse. REARS
near the SERVANTS QUARTERS -- moving FAST toward a small hut:
A HATCHET is embedded in a wood pile. Dolarhyde YANKS it out.
A CASCADING WATERFALL flows over rock face into the TWIN RIVERS.
The water curtain covers a CAVERN ENTRANCE. The back way in.
Jake, Ella, Doc, Colorado and the Apaches cross slippery rocks
and push through the water...
A BUZZARD picks at the EAR of a DEAD GANG MEMBER. More birds
scavenge the dismembered remains of JAKE'S CREW as the rest of
its LIVING MEMBERS -- roughly 30 -- tend wounds and get ready to
move on. One of them looks up...
.. and sees an INCOMING RIDER on the horizon:
OUTLAW
BRONC!
BRONC and HUNT look up. Draws their GUNS. So does the rest of
the gang... until they see the rider's waving a WHITE FLAG. As
he comes closer -- they realize it's DOLARHYDE:
HUNT
One of them fellas Jake was ridin' with!
Dolarhyde rides into camp, REARING in front of 30 guns
BRONC
The hell you want?
DOLARHYDE
It's about what you want.
He reaches into his pocket and tosses Bronc a GOLD COIN:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
Lonergan stole your gold. That's a taste
of what I got -- more'n you've ever seen.
It's all yours if you help me get my boy
back.
The men trade LOOKS. Bronc eyes the coin. Alight with greed:
BRONC
Who's got your boy?
DOLARHYDE
Well, there's the rub.
(BEAT)
I got two.
Off that --
The shuttle BLASTS through the upper cloud layer, to reveal...
THE ALIEN SCOUT
-SHIP. ENORMOUS AND THREATENING, like a BLACK METAL CLAW. Cloud banks encircle the ship as if it were the eye
of a hurricane.
ON ELLA. Like ice down her spine... as we drift back to JAKE.
Trying to find a word to DESCRIBE this thing. Finally:
JAKE
Sheee-it.
They start spilling over the fort walls in pursuit. A few mount
SPEEDERS and launch as our guys ride DOWN THE CANYON TRENCH:
-- PLASMA FIRE of the shuttle's burners as it ROARS toward the
ALIEN SHIP... a SPECK against the BEHEMOTH:
As the FORT SIEGE continues, DOLARHYDE and COLORADO gallop back
and forth between their men:
DOLARHYDE
DON'T BREAK RANKS! HOLD YOUR LINES
GODDAMIT! WE CAN TAKE THIS FOR--
-- KATHWAM! An EXPLOSION throws them off their horses.
Colorado picks up his father and they start RUNNING LOW under
stray beams of PLASMA FIRE, reaching Doc and Grey Wolf:
THE FOUR MEN -- PINNED BEHIND THE ROCK EMBANKMENT:
Doc's finger is still STUCK in that ALIEN GRENADE, clamped to
the bleeding Apache's shoulder:
DOL.ARHYDE (CONT'D)
The hell iz that?
Grey Wolf MOANS in pain. Doc SHOUTS to Dolar:
DOC
Tell him to hold still! If I have this
thing figured right, long as t keep my
finger under the red pin we won't blow
up!
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
What's he saying?:
99.
DOLARHYDE (SUBTITLE)
He says we're all gonna die.
COLORADO
We need to pull it out of his shoulder!
DOLARHYDE
I'm not pullin' anything!
(RE: DOC)
He's the damn doctor!
ZZZZZZAM! MORE people are CUT DOWN by the Alien GRENADE CANNON
-- the BLOWBACK nearly KNOCKS the grenade out of Doe's hand --
DOC
SHIT!
Dolarhyde gets an IDEA. HARDENS. Looks Doc right in the eye:
DOLARHYDE
Alright, listen -- you slide your finger
from under that pin, I'll slip mine in
and hold it in place. Then you pull it
out and I'll throw it.
Doc NODS fearfully. Dolar carefully SLIPS his finger under the
pin as Doc SLIPS it out. PHEW. Now Doc takes hold of the
grenade itself, nods "ready" to pull it out. Grey Wolf braces
FOR PAIN:
DOC
On three...
(DOLAR NODS)
One... t --
DOLARHYDE
-- Wait.
Everyone LURCHES from the tension interrupt:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
Tell your wife we're clear.
DOC
What?
DOLARHYDE
-- your wife. Maria. We had an
arrangement. I left your saloon alone
and she paid me off.
ON DOC. Reeling, now REALLY confused --
DOC
We're broke. Paid you off with what?
100.
DOLARHYDE
She stole from the people in your morgue.
Gold teeth, trinkets, pocket watches --
It LANDS on Doc: that's why he fond the watch under their bed.
DOC
I thought she was cheating!
DOLARHYDE
Just robbin' corpses.
DOC
Thank God!
(and then -- )
Wait. You hate me. Why're you telling
me this?
With GENUINE REMORSE:
DOLARHYDE
May not get another chance --
(THEN)
-- and I still hate ya.
A MOMENT. Forgiveness and atonement.
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
WILL YOU GET ON WITH IT?111
DOC AND DOLARHYDE
One... two... three!
And Doc RIPS the grenade from Grey Wolf's shoulder -- he HOWLS,
CLAMPS tearing out of his flesh. But they did it!
As more EXPLOSIONS decimate men, Dolarhyde PULLS the grenade out
of Doc's hands, still holding his finger under the FIRING PIN --
DOC
WHAT'RE YOU--
Dolarhyde looks at Colorado:
DOLARHYDE
Tell your mother I love her.
With that, he CHARGES into the swirling chaos
NAT COLORADO
WAIT!
-- but BOOM! Colorado's FORCED BACK by an explosion -- through
the debris, he sees his father running toward...
THE SUPERCANNON
101.
Dolarhyde HURLS the grenade -- BOOM!!! IT DETONATES IN A
MILLION PIECES! DOLARHYDE DISAPPEARS IN THE BLAST!
COLORADO
NO!!!!!
But his sacrifice 7M S THE TIDE! THE EXPLOSION BLOWS THE
FORT'S FRONT GATES OFF! THEY TOPPLE ON A WHOLE BUNCH OF ALIENS!
A CRY OF VICTORY as the humans STORM THROUGH! Aliens hurtle
back in DISORDER --
The Scout Ship SCREAMS down out of the cloud, toward the CANYON:
102.
Outlaws and Apaches finish off the wounded, TOMAHAWKS RIPPING
AWAY TENTACLED SCALPS! Carnage and joy -- but then:
A MONSTROUS SHADOW spreads over the battlefield. Everyone looks
up to see the SCOUT SHIP PLUMMETING DOWN --
GREY WOLF (SUBTITLE)
Fall back!!! NOW!! NOW!!
As the humans FLEE from the fort, the remaining aliens RETREAT
to the last shuttles for ESCAPE... start to LIFT OFF...
But find themselves SMASHING into the ENORMOUS HULL of the ship
as_it crashe _down!
THE SHIP PLUNGES INTO THE CANYON AND CLEAR THROUGH THE ALIEN
FORT, RIPPING IT INTO TIDAL-WAVE MOUNDS OF SHRAPNEL... CHEWS UP
A HALF-MILE BEFORE SLOWLY COMING TO A FINAL, WRENCHING... STOP.
The frame is WHITE with dust and SUNSHINE. As from the ether
comes...
EMMETT, HAPPY, and DOC, with GREY WOLF's arm slung over his
shoulder. Among other faces, White and Apache... all of them
PROUD WARRIORS. Staring in awe at:
THE CRASHED ALIEN SHIP. DUG DEEP INTO THE CANYON FLOOR.
Something starts to rain down. Looks at first like glitter...
until we realize it's GOLD DUST.
From an OPENING in the Scout Ship, the sound of THUNDERING
HOOVES as... ALL THE ANIMALS STAMPEDE OUT. Then, slowly...
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE emerge, dazed -- their minds slowly WAKING
UP. White and Kiowa-Apache ABDUCTEES.
DOC RUSHES IN, searching faces -- no -- no -- no -- n--
THERE she is, his BELOVED MARIA, stumbling weakly toward him as
tears runs down her cheek. He EMBRACES her madly, kissing every
inch of her face as...
EMMETT pushes through the crowd, sees SHERIFF TAGGART --
EMMETT
PAW!!!! PAW!!!!
The kid GRABS his father and holds him for dear life, as Taggart
stares back in a daze --
EMMETT (CONT'D)
It's me -- it's Emmett.
And somewhere in there, RECOGNITION comes to the Sheriff's
eyes... Emmett SMILES and throws his arms around his father
again as --
THE TOWNSFOLK OF ABSOLUTION AND THE APACHES FIND EACH OTHER.
Families, lovers, friends... reunited.
104.
COLORADO
Moving through the FALLEN BODIES toward the lifeless form of
Dolarhyde, his FATHER. Eyes welling, he drops to his knees...
A VOICE (O.S.)
Nat?
Colorado turns -- it's PERCY. Confused. Like waking from a
dream. Sees his father on the ground...
PERCY
What... happened?
And all Colorado can say is...
NAT COLORADO
He's dead.
That HANGS there. Percy blinks. And then --
PERCY
Who's gettin' the ranch?
ON COLORADO. At first, words that don't compute. Then PURE
BLIND RAGE takes hold and his FISTS FLY, PUNCHING PERCY:
NAT COLORADO PERCY
YOU SONOFABITCH! HE JUST STOP! NAT, STOP!!!
SAVED YOUR WORTHLESS LITTLE
LIFE!
DOLARHYDE (O.S.)
HEY!
Colorado WHIRLS -- DOLARHYDE IS STAGGERING TO HIS FEET, ALIVE!
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
No one's gettin' my ranch.
Stunned, Colorado GRINS. Percy spits blood, points accusingly --
PERCY
Paw, he--
Dolarhyde SMACKS Percy across the face:
PERCY (CONT'D)
OW!!! What'd you do that for?
UOLARHYUE
For being an ungrateful little bastard.
Now shake your brother's hand and thank
him for saving your ass, cause it's more
than you ever would'a done bjM.
105.
Chastened, Percy glowers at Colorado. Grudgingly reaches out a
hand. So does Nat. As they SHAKE --
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
That's better.
JAKE
Staggers through the crowd. And sees ELLA. Thgy did it. But
she still looks TROUBLED. Staring out at the vast desert...
JAKE
. what is it?
ELLA
We didn't get all of 'em. Some ran oft.
That LANDS on Jake, as he too looks toward the endless horizon.
HOLD on them, together, a VICTORIOUS but UNRESOLVED note...
We RISE UP over the sea of bodies and the CRASHED SHIP, until
Jake and Ella are just two small figures in the crowd...
FADE TO:
A glorious sight: Absolution in REBIRTH -- FLUSH from all that
GOLD. Storefronts brightly painted, the streets ALIVE.
We PICK UP EMMETT running through the hustle and bustle with two
APACHE KIDS. Suddenly, DOLARHYDE, COLORADO and their gang ride
in. SHERIFF TAGGART emerges from his office with DEPUTY WADE:
SHERIFF TAGGART
EMMETT! GET OVER HERE!!!
EMMETT
-- what? What'd I dQ?
SHERIFF TAGGART EMMETT
Get outta the road before
you're run down! If your (overlapping)
momma saw y-- -- "saw me playin' in the
street she'd roll over in her
grave and shoot lightnin'
bolts outta her eyes," I know,
I know!
He runs off. Taggart SMIRKS:
SHERIFF TAGGART
Kid's got a mouth on him.
106.
DEPUTY WADE
Well, Kyle, considering he saved your
life, guess you'll just have to grin'n
bear it.
Dolar moves up to Taggart, tough as ever. The men HOLD looks:
SHERIFF TAGGART
Woodrow.
DOLARHYDE
Kyle.
Percy STEWS about something. Dolar WHACKS him upside the head:
DOLARHYDE (CONT'D)
Go_ _on.
Grudgingly, Percy hands Taggart a SHEAF OF PAPER --
SHERIFF TAGGART
What's this?
DOLARHYDE
Claims to the land 50 miles west of here.
I've signed it over to the township of
Absolution.
(off Taggart's LOOK)
Considering I'm a businessman, I figure
expansion's in both our interests. Needs
the Sheriff's signature to be official.
SHERIFF TAGGART
Fifty miles west of here is where the
goldmine is, Woodrow.
DOLARHYDE
(A BEAT)
That so.
With surprise, Taggart studies the paper. SMILES:
SHERIFF TAGGART
What's this about twenty percent going to
the Apaches?
Dolarhyde glances at Colorado. A moment. But the hardened
rancher maintains his rock-solid facade:
DOLARHYDE
Figure the only way not to piss 'em off
is to buy 'em.
SHERIFF TAGGART
Since when'd you worry about pissin'
anyone off?
107.
DOLARHYDE
Just sign it, Goddamnit.
With a grin, Taggart gestures for Deputy Wade to turn around and
flattens the paper on his BACK, using it as a surface to SIGN:
SHERIFF TAGGART
I'd say you were being generous, Woodrow,
but I know you'd just be insulted.
DOLARHYDE
Damn right.
Dolar gives his hat a TIP, then mounts up to go -- and we RISE
UP to the UPPER FLOOR of the GOLD LEAF SALOON, in the process of
being rebuilt in grand style -- and MOVE IN on a WINDOW where:
A hand unties a HORSE from its tether bar -- it's JAKE. Saddle
bags packed. A BARK turns him around... HAPPY. Yipping for
Jake to FOLLOW. He GRINS. As MUSIC begins to RISE -- HOPEFUL:
In a LONG SHOT -- the distant SILHOUETTES of Happy BOUNDING
through the shallow TWIN RIVERS, Jake following on horseback...
108.
As Jake approaches, APACHE SENTRIES emerge from rocks to keep
outsiders away. Jake TIPS his hat and they nod, let him pass.
He nears the bluff where ELLA, GREY WOLF, and the rest of the
Apaches finish laying DYNAMITE DET CORD that trails down into
the canyon. Ella hears Happy BARKING -- turns to see her dog
with Jake. She smiles as he rides up, dismounts:
ELLA
Second damn time that dog ran off on me.
JAKE
Second time he brought me to you.
Happy's tail wags. The look between Jake and Ella HOLDS. And
it seems freighted with everything. Finally, he breaks it --
glancing at the Apaches finishing their work with the dynamite,
and the remnants of the ALIEN SHIP and FORTRESS below.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Looks like you got everything set.
Ella eyes Jake's horse, loaded with GEAR. Looks up, clearly
DISAPPOINTED:
ELLA
Where you headed?
JAKE
(A BEAT)
Got some messes to clean up.
But she looks at him. fEADI.NG liim. wryly:
ELLA
Messes.
JAKE
... Yep.
(then; off her look)
What.
She walks right up to his horse. Right up to HIM:
ELLA
I think you're ridin' off cause you're
just scared of what'll happen if you
stay.
An INFERENCE here. Ella's going BOLD. Jake swings off his
horse, lands beside her. Now. Almost CURIOUS:
JAKE
And what's gonna happen?
109.
She steps CLOSER to him... INTIMATE:
ELLA
You know.
A CHARGE between them. All they wanna do is KISS...
But that'd be too easy. And those wounds of his, they haven't
quite healed. He drops his eyes; SOFTLY NOW:
JAKE
If I stay... it's not gonna be good for
anybody, Ella.
A beat. She looks off. Nods. They say nothing. And now he
slowly climbs back on his horse. Ella TOUGHENS:
ELLA
Heard some rumors outta Abilene. Weird
noises at night. Cattle mutilations.
Weather phenomena. Figured I'd ride down
there. Give it a look-see.
JAKE
(his eyes narrow)
What's 'phenomena'?
ELLA
Big storms in places that don't get big
storms.
ON JAKE. Every fighting instinct in him suddenly IGNITED,
though he plays it down:
JAKE
You goin' down there yourself?
ELLA
Why? You worried about me?
You bet your ass he is. But, he shakes his head--
JAKE
No, ma'am. You can take care of yourself
just fine.
(then; tips his hat)
Be seein' you around.
ELLA
goodbye, Jake.
He gets back on his horse. Starts to ride off. Happy BARKS and
trots alongside him. BARK BARK BARK. In dog that means "Don't
be an idiot." Jake glances over --
110.
JAKE
Get the hell away from me, you damn mutt.
(BARK, BARK)
Go on, GET.
He heels his horse, leaving Happy behind to WHINE.
Jake rides off into the sunset. But his heart's KICKING in his
chest. And this is pretty much where things usually end...
But. Jake pulls the REINS as he SIGHS. Turns the horse around.
TROTS back to Ella, whose smile WIDENS as he closes the gap
between them.
Finally STOPS right in front of her. And despite his best
effort to stay TOUGH... he just plain likes her:
JAKE (CONT'D)
Abilene happens to be on my way.
He reaches out a hand... she takes it... as he PULLS HER UP INTO
THE SADDLE. Ella grinning ear-to-ear as she folds her arms
around his waist. Jake -- ever the outlaw -- grumbles:
JAKE (CONT'D)
Stop smiling, Goddammit.
He KICKS the horse and Happy follows. Ella shoots a goodbye
look to Grey Wolf, who NODS. Signals his men and FUSES ARE LIT:
The DYNAMITE FUSES ssssssnake down the mountain -- reaching the
canyon floor -- INTO those limestone tunnels where CLUSTERS OF
DYNAMITE have been placed... and as FUSE MEETS EXPLOSIVE:
ANGLE - JAKE AND ELLA CRESTING A HILL -- B000000000000MI The
THUNDER of EXPLOSIONS makes them rear. They turn back to see...
THE TWIN RIVERS GEYSERING UP INTO THE CANYON. COVERING ALL
EVIDENCE OF THE ALIEN SHIP AND 'Q T.
Ella folds her arms TIGHTER around Jake, her heart full. With a
nod of private affirmation, he spurs the horse with a HYAI
As the canyon behind them fills with rushing water, Jake and
Ella ride hard into the fiery sunset...
Away from the past, toward a future full of promise.
FADE OUT.
