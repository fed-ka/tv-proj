Beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small
Renaissance Fair with florid awnings, demented ACROBATS
and roaring puppets is unfolding.
RUSTIC FARMERS and their families rumble with enjoyment
at the Sabbath afternoon entertainment.
Encircled by children, A JUGGLER WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY
ETCHED FACE elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch
on his mule.
As he begins to juggle, a LOUD EXPLOSION
is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls
and collapse in a heap.
Everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up.
UNFORGETTABLE JUGGLER
Leonardo, che pazzo.
The juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings
up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle...
A FLYING APPRENTICE sails past Leonardo in a bat winged
glider, enthusiastically shouting.
Da Vinci grins back
until he touches his pocket.
He pulls out the crystal
and, after a beat, angrily twists it apart into two
separate, geometric pieces revealing a small intricate
mirror.
He quickly folds the surprisingly shapable
geometric pieces.
Calming down, Da Vinci looks from the three components of
the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the
table in his workshop.
He ponders then looks back out to
the Vinci vista.
The bat winged glider DISSOLVES into:
A HAWK
who is revealed to be flying over Sing Sing prison.
Hawk strides to the Massive Sliding Concrete Door/Wall
between him and freedom.
As music crescendos and
Hawk glows his first smile, the door opens to reveal two
Mafioso brothers, CESAR and ANTONY MARIO, the latter
sitting upon the hood of a tinted window Lincoln
Continental.
Cesar is of cool, hair-slicked-back
attitude, his scumbag brother is not.
ANTONY
Welcome back, buddy ol' pal.
We've got a proposition...
HAWK
Answer's no, not even if you
bathe.
Cesar Mario, Antony Mario,
how's the "Family?"
Kill any
monkeys lately?
CESAR
How many times do I have to say
it?
I didn't put the hit on
Little Eddie... Never had anything
against that kooky chimp.
I
actually found him, "endearing."
HAWK
Sure.
Face down.
Two endearing
shots to the back of the head.
That's your mark, man.
What did
Little Eddie ever do to...
Smouldering, Hawk struts off.
Cesar takes a black
canvas bag from a SCARFACED DRIVER and hustles up to
Hawk.
The Lincoln rumbles behind them, Antony riding
on the hood.
CESAR
You're hitting Rutherford's
Auction House.
Easy as my
brother's wife.
Directions are
in the bag.
Just open the seventh
floor safe and take out the
thingie...
HAWK
Or you cut off my thingie.
Directions even your brother
would understand.
ANTONY
(defensively)
Yeah, directions even I could
understand.
The car squeals to a stop.
Antony bounds off.
Cesar
shove-throws the canvas bag into Hawk's unwilling
hands.
CESAR
Hawk, you're a great thief.
Got
set up, did some time, nothing to
be ashamed of.
Don't give me a
sonata about you always just
really wanted to settle down,
open a hardware Store and sell
spatulas...
HAWK
If the Mario brothers weren't
Jersey's third largest family,
I'd say kiss my ass.
But
considering your status, I'll
say slurp my butt.
Hawk fiercely push-shoves the canvas bag back into
Cesar's hands.
CESAR
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
HAWK
Baseball, why?
Antony opens the back door of the Lincoln and says
"Baseball."
He is handed a baseball bat.
Hawk backs
up as Antony moves threateningly toward him.
HAWK
I meant, ping pong.
Listen, I'd
rather go back in than whore for
you...
(stopping)
Oh, I need to borrow ten dollars.
A PRISON GUARD from above turns as not to be a witness.
Hawk feebly calls up to him.
HAWK
Help?
Police?
Antony swings at Hawk, who pretends not to notice until
the last second.
Hawk ducks and slam-kicks his calf.
Antony crumples, using the bat as a crutch.
Hawk boots
up the bat for a two-handed catch then savagely pivots
it across Antony's face, knocking him into the backseat
of the car.
CESAR
(unfazed)
You need some time to think.
That's cool, but next time, I'm
not going to say "Please."
Cesar floats into the backseat.
The Lincoln takes off.
Hawk seethes...
HAWK
I don't believe this.
I've been
out forty seconds...
A BACKFIRE rings out.
Hawk hits the ground, thinking
it is a gunshot.
HAWK'S ON THE GROUND P.O.V.
A gasping 1960 Caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too-
fancy-to-be-tasteful shoes comes out.
Hawk looks up to
see ALEX MESSINA, his older, maybe-maybe-not-wiser best
friend.
ALEX
That's the first thing I did.
Smooch the ground and taste the
freedom.
Sorry I was late.
Miss
anything?
HAWK
(getting up)
Your timing, and your shoes, are
impeccable...
Good to see you,
Alex, been having a lousy day.
ALEX
Lousy day?
The man's getting out
of prison and he's having a
lousy day.
What, you missing out
on the Cell Block Water Ballet
pageant?
Believe me, it's
overrated.
Hawk pauses to say something, then just hugs Alex.
ALEX
Where's the kiss?
No tongue this
time, I promise.
A laughing Hawk gives Alex's stomach a slap before
getting in the car....
HAWK
Looks like you've been expanding
your...
ALEX
Don't say it, Hawkins.
I'm
incredibly sensitive about my
fucking figure.
HAWK
My next word was gonna be
"consciousness."
Swear to God...
tubby.
The Caddy thunders past a sweet Manhattan view. "Come
Fly With Me" is playing on the radio.
Hawk casually com-
pletes an intimidating hand puzzle.
HAWK
That's your definition of "Hard?"
ALEX
Show off.
Hey, boss tune.
"Come
Fly with Me."
HAWK
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
ALEX
Still do the puzzles, still know
the running times of songs, and
I'll bet you're still the best
damn cat burg--
HAWK
Not anymore.
Now I'm the laziest
damn cat burg--I'm going to take
it so straight that I won't tape
a Mets game without the expressed
written consent of the National
Baseball League.
ALEX
Now that you're born again,what
do you wanna do?
Statue of
Liberty?
Entertain some ladies?
Miss Saigon tix?
Seduce some
women?
Play Nintendo?
Bone some
chicks?
HAWK
Come on, Alex, let's just get to
Alex's.
Your bar's the only
place that's going to cheer me.
God, I'd kill for a damn
cappuccino.
What the hell's a
Nintendo?
ALEX
Oh man, you still got a thing for
those unmasculine European coffees?
Who's your buddy?
Alex pulls a styrofoam cup from a paper bag.
HAWK
The man knows, the man knows!
Hawk takes off the cap with a stimulating whiff.
ALEX
So Mr. Coffee, what went down
outside the prison?
HAWK
Oh, not much.
Mario Brothers want
me to do a job.
Alex brakes and cappuccino flies.
Hawk half-heartedly
tries to lick up with his fingers.
ALEX
Those dago-guinea-I can say
this shit I'm Italian-wop
motherfu--
HAWK
Ah, had the perfect amount of
foam.
Just get me to the bar...
It's the one good thing in my
life that'll never change....
The Guys move through the personably Jersey face of the
bar.
The Empire State Building beams in the background.
Sinatra cuts off.
TWO GRUBBY DERELICTS, one pushing a shopping cart, the
other inside it, situated atop the usual two Glad bags.
They are drunkenly warbling "Witchcraft."
IMPECCABLY
DRESSED NIGHT-LIFERS give them a wide berth.
Our derelicts pass beneath a MASSIVE RED CANOPY of a
distinguished eight story edifice, upon which is written
RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE.
A DOORMAN shoos them away...
A NEWSPAPER TRUCK pulls up in front of the Auction House.
The Driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to
a Dispenser on the corner.
The Bums wheel around the
truck.
The Driver loads the papers and bounds back.
The Truck pulls away from the corner.
The shopping cart
rolls off--the bums nowhere to be seen.
The Truck turns the corner, revealing the derelicts
climbing up the back of it, with Glad bags around their
necks.
The Truck moves toward an enclosed Walkway Bridge
that connects the Auction House with another Building.
Launching low-tech grapples, the Vagrants latch them-
selves onto the Walkway window as the Truck passes
beneath.
AT THE WINDOW
The viewer's viewpoint moves into a tighter view of the
dangling derelicts, revealing them to, of course, be Hawk
and Alex.
Getting a footing, on the small window ledge,
each man cuts a hole in the window while holding onto a
plunger.
HAWK
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole
than that.
ALEX
Hey, you promised......Don't worry,
I'm wearing my girdle.
The ambulance careens onto the Brooklyn Bridge.
CRASHES through a gate-arm of another lane.
Hawk and the
still-wildly whooshing gurney cut it off.
FRONT SEAT OF THE AMBULANCE
Cesar pops his head through the partition.
CESAR
Make him into Roadkill!
Antony, seemingly oblivious to the syringes porcupined in
his skull, pokes his head next to Cesar's.
ANTONY
Yeah, run him down!
Cesar and the Bodyguard/Driver turn to Antony and scream,
then all three look out the windshield and scream.
THE AMBULANCE
jackknifes over a stopped car and somersaults into a
fiery ball.
In the foreground, Hawk's gurney coasts down
A PEACEFUL OFF-ROAD
Hawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle
fear, comes to a tranquil gurney-wheels-gently-squeaking
stop.
Lit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering
young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness,
carrying a steel suitcase.
He kneels before Hawk and
opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara-
tus.
He begins mumbling into a cellular phone.
A malevolent, SILENT DEADPAN WRAITH passes him and
approaches Hawk.
Both men are dressed in outfits that
seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute
couture.
On the fingers of one Wraith hand is carved the word
HATE.
On the other hand is the word FROG.
The Frog Hand
hands a befuddled Hawk a card.
It reads: MY NAME IS KIT
KAT AND THIS IS NOT A DREAM.
Hawk looks up with a "huh" expression as Kit Kat chops
his neck, knocking him off the gurney.
The sneering computer guy hangs up his phone and pulls
forward a small cattle prod from his apparatus.
HAWK
This is the worst night...
SNICKERS
When it rains, it pours.
Name's
Snickers.
The plane leaves in 40.
Snickers zaps Hawk in the leg with his device.
Hawk a-
a-ghs into a kneeling position.
Snickers returns to his
suitcase and is passed by a PLEASANT YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in
the "outfit."
ALMOND JOY
Almond Joy.
I know, pretty silly.
But it's better than when we first
started out, our code names were
Diseases.
You don't know what
it's like being called Clymidia
for a year.
(walking off)
Whoops, forgot....
She deftly kicks Hawk across the face.
Hawk angrily
bounds back up until he sees the BIGGEST MEMBER OF THE
GROUP Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum his way toward them.
Suddenly, the
Giant clumsily trips over Snickers' suitcase apparatus
and ram-collapses into Hawk and the gurney.
Laying atop
Hawk, Butterfinger goofily speaks...
BUTTERFINGER
My name's Butterfinger.
HAWK
No shit.
The mysterious group parts to reveal a much more mature
and cynically subdued man dressed in big lapels and a hat
that screams Old Time CIA.
His name will be GEORGE
KAPLAN.
KAPLAN
Don't you just hate kids...
ALMOND JOY
George, you promised.
No Old CIA/
New CIA jokes...
KAPLAN
I call them the MTV.I.A.
Punks
think Bay of Pigs is an herbal tea.
They think the Cold War involves
penguins and...
HAWK
Don't I know you...
KAPLAN
You just might.
I'm the guy who
tricked you into robbing a
government installation and then
had you sent to prison for it.
At
the time, I was bald with a beard,
no moustache, and I had a different
nose, so if you don't recognize me,
I won't be offended.
HAWK
Bastard, you're going to need
another nose!
Hawk explodes upward.
Everyone but cool Kaplan draws a
gun.
HAWK
But I'm not the type of guy to
hold a grudge.
KAPLAN
I used you as a diversion.
while
you were getting captured upstairs,
I was shredding documents in the
basement.
Deep down, I guess I
was just jealous.
You were one
incredible thief...
HAWK
To what do I owe the dishonor of a
reunion, you centrally intelligent
scumsicle.
As Kaplan converses, Snickers and Butterfinger bring out
a mammoth empty suitcase and open it behind Hawk.
KAPLAN
I Want to make things up to you.
That's why I got you this gig,
doll.
Hawk, my name's George
Kaplan and to quote the late,
great Karen Carpenter, "We've only
just begun."
HAWK
Three minutes, twenty-three
seconds.
If you think I'm doing
another...
KAPLAN
Hush.
My employer wants a meeting.
HAWK
Employer?
The president?
KAPLAN
No, somebody powerful.
Oh.
Look.
what's that up there?
HAWK
I'm supposed to fall for that?
KAPLAN
Shucks.
Guess not.
Kaplan savagely point-blank punches Hawk in the face,
knocking him out cold and into the mammoth suitcase.
Snickers slams it shut revealing a KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL
sticker.
Alfred opens the back door of an omnipotent, Mayflower-
logoed LIMOUSINE.
The car moves off as Hawk slides in...
Hawk and Darwin head up the steps of an overpowering
fascistly marble superstructure.
Alfred brings up the
rear.
DARWIN
So Hawkasaurus, I won't mince
words...
HAWK
Whatever.
You own Boardwalk, you
own Park Place, you own the four
railroads.
You think you're God.
For all I know, you're probably
right.
I just wanted to have a
damn cappuccino, maybe play some
Nintendo after I find out what it
is.
Man, why didn't you just buy
the horse?
What am I saying, you
did buy it...
DARWIN
Oh... Let's see.
There are
organizations that think we wanted
the "Sforza" for reasons other
than putting it in the Da Vinci
museum we're building in Vinci.
Hopefully, these organizations
think our plan has been ruined
with the explosion of our replica.
If I seem vague, grand.
We want a
low profile on this, that's why I
got Kaplan and the Candy bars
involved.
I helped George help
the Mario Brothers and Gates help
get you out....
HAWK
If you're pausing for a "thank you,"
give it up.
So boss, you going to
tell me what the crystal piece
inside the pony means?
DARWIN
Way to go, Alfie!
How many people
did you break that thing in front
of.
Good help's hard to find.
HAWK
I guess that's a no.
The Vatican stands in its glory, mobbed by HUNDREDS OF
LOCALS AND SIGHTSEERS.
The viewer's viewpoint zeroes in
on the Mayflower limousine circling around it.
Hawk comes out onto a circular open-air hallway.
He
scans up to some rooftops and makes a note...until he
sees a line of International Phone Boothettes.
Checking
for Flunkies, he rips one up.
HAWK
Operator, I want to make a collect
call to Alex Messina, New York....
The Flunkies drift into view.
Hawk hangs up and seethes
off.
The evil Hawk clumsily strides around a fountain, looking
off in all directions, soft-shoes past some sedate
painters and swings into...
One of the small Vatican mail trains bullets across an
indoor track.
The viewer's viewpoint whooshes to catch
up, focusing on a very large package, addressed to the
Pope, that has Hawk's sheath of stamps slapped onto it.
The train zips into a tunnel.
Hawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical
skipping-across-the-rooftop jaunt.
Suddenly a brick
on the slightly slanted roof gives way and Hawk FALLS.
His canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof,
landing against the antennae.
Hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof
and slides down toward the dangling-off-the-antennae bag.
The Vatican Guard pops out of the window and fires a
warning shot.
Hawk stretches to the bag.
His fingers touch as the
Guard continues to bound forward.
HAWK
Please God, Please God.......let
the guard shoot me.
Hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see Vatican
Guard hovering over him on the roof.
VATICAN GUARD
The worm's on the other foot,
yankee noodle candy.
Hawk sees the Vatican Guard's foot move toward the
grapple.
Hawk ferociously tugs, ripping the Guard
off-balance and knocking down a side of the roof.
Hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple
across a road around a tree branch.
Hawk ties the end of
grapple line, tosses on a friction belt, takes a breath
and JUMPS OFF THE WALL.
The viewer follows him on his
breathtaking ride.
The brused Vatican Guard flops back atop the roof.
He
gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down.
HAWK
is alnost to the other side when the Guard's bullet hits
the friction belt.
Hawk drops with a wild scream...
and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost.
His eyes bug out with the thought of a life without
children.
He slowly spins off the lamppost and sails
down upon...
and the comfortable luggage housed on top of it.
Hawk
tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling
baggage, but the bus makes a quick turn and Hawk goes
flying off...
Panting and discombobulated, Hawk looks across the table
to the female hands holding open a menu.
The menu comes
down.
It is Anna.
Hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas
bag.
ANNA
Oh Hudson, I was worried you
weren't going to drop by....
HAWK
I never break a date.
Scout's
honor.
Hawk does the honor sign with his black gloved hand
then quickly rips it off as a WAITER comes to the
table.
HAWK
Fettucini con Funghi Porcini.
WAITER
Bellissimo, signor.
HAWK
Oh, and could I have some ketchup
with that.
Anna hits her forehead with the palm of her hand while
the waiter's entire body sinks in disappointment.
Other
TABLE OCCUPANTS sadly shake their heads.
At a comfortable distance curled behind a heat lamp,
Snickers is being an Uglier American to an UNCOMPREHENDING
WAITER, while Almond Joy chuckles and Butterfinger spreads
butter over an entire baguette.
SNICKERS
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger,
Fren-n-ch Fries.
This is France,
you gotta have French.....
ALMOND JOY
Actually we're in Italy, Snickers,
she said as if it made a difference.
The Waiter sneaks off.
Butterfinger devours his bread.
SNICKERS
Italy, France, Moscow.
They all
just wanna be Nebraska.
Old Man
Kaplan thinks since Communism is
dead, we got nothing to do.
Man,
Democracy isn't free elections.
We gotta teach the world that
Democracy is Big Tits, College
Football on Saturdays, Eddie
Murphy saying the word "Fuck"
and Kids putting their hands down
garbage disposals on "America's
Funniest Home Videos."
ALMOND JOY
Damn baby, when's the last time
you had a vacation...Jesus, I
gotta get out of this job.
If
my Mom knew her daughter
assassinated the leader of the
anti-Apartheid movement....
SNICKERS
Quit bitching, you got the
employee of the month plaque for
that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is
and in love.
They look off to....
HAWK AND ANNA'S TABLE
Physically sarcastic, the Waiter brings a tall wine
basket with a bottle of ketchup in it.
Hawk nabs it.
HAWK
This is bueno.
They had the worst
ketchup in prison.....uh...
ANNA
Prison?
HAWK
I was the Warden?
ANNA
How long were you in?
HAWK
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
ANNA
Wow, you were "in the joint."
"Doing hard time."
It's funny,
but that excites me.
I seem to
have a thing for sinners.
HAWK
I seem to have a thing for sinning.
sinning.
Check please....
WAITER
Ah, anything for dessert?
ANNA
(she shoots)
Yes.
Something to go.
HAWK
(she scores)
I'll bring the ketchup.
Crammed together in the front seat, Snickers, Almond
Joy, and Butterfinger are watching the shadows of
Hawk and Anna up in the window.
Snickers snaps a
cartridge into a gun while Butterfinger attacks a
goo-ey pastry.
SNICKERS
What's going on in there?
BUTTERFINGER
Do you want me to rape them?
(throwing pastry down)
Dunkin does it better.
SNICKERS
Just read, Butterfinger.
Butterfinger pulls up the book on Da Vinci that Anna
wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy.
BUTTERFINGER
"Da Vinci had fears about his
more dangerous designs, so he
created a shorthand code in
reverse script..."
ALMOND JOY
To yourself!.....What are they
doing?
In twenty seconds, we go
in.
A helicopter thunders up to the awesome castle from the
opening Da Vinci sequence.
Moving into the chopper, Anna glimpses, Bunny, the
obnoxious dog, in a Mayflower logo dog tag, taking a leak
on some bushes.
She fakes a yawn to the like dressed Kit
Kat who fakes one back.
The piazza from the fascist E.U.R. building are bustling
with office workers laughing, smoking, and hustling.
Darwin, Minerva and Kaplan are a solid troika in the
center of the steps.
The other agents stroll in the
periphery....
KAPLAN
I just don't think it was a
smoking hot idea to leave them up
there alone.
MINERVA
Don't worry George, this is the
reason we put the old diabetic
guinea on the payroll to begin
with.
To keep Hawk in line.
They'll talk about "being buddies"
and "chugging brewskis."
DARWIN
(raising glass)
You gotta love male bonding.
As Darwin slaps Kaplan on the back, behind them, Hawk and
Alex come crashing out of the windowed doors of the building.
KAPLAN
You were saying...
Moving to the edge of the stairs, Hawk and Alex, latter
holding his gun, sprout up from their own debris and
continue savagely brawling.
The wigging out passers-
by give them space.
HAWK
You bastard!
You fucked my
freedom for a lousy job!
Alex trembles, going into a diabetic seizure.
He shakily
raises his gun.
ALEX
Hawk... I'm so sorry...
Hawk roars forward like a bull and helmets Alex.
They
roll together down the massive staircase past Darwin,
Minerva, and the CIA who react with "This can't be
happening" catatonia.
Two SHOTS go off as Hawk and Alex crash to the bottom of
the staircase.
Hawk rises up in a daze to see Alex on the
ground with two bloody bullet holes.
HAWK
No.....Alex!
Wake up, you can't
go out like this.
Hawk falls to his knees as Snickers hustles toward him.
Suddenly, sirens are heard as a police van pulls up.
Snickers stops.
Four policemen blast from the back of the van.
One holds
back the crowd.
One strenuously pulls Hawk into the van.
The other two drag in Alex.
The villains look to each other for non-existent guidance
as the van pulls away.
MINERVA
Plan B, anyone...
Using initiative, Snickers hops on a Vespa and roars off
after them.
The van can be seen swerving off.....
AROUND A CORNER
where it bolts up into a much larger truck marked VATICAN
SOUVENIRS.
TWO SEEMINGLY-INNOCENT-BYSTANDER PRIESTS break
demeanor to flop up the wheel ramps, slam close the back
of the truck, lock it shut, and continue on their solemn
way.
The TRUCK BELLOWS off as the Vespa spins around the corner.
Snickers brakes and looks around for the police van.
He
hits his handle with frustration.
Out of her habit but still in her incredible sunglasses,
Anna looks out to a lovely view of Italy.
The Vatican Truck
pulls up behind her.
A giddy, blood-stained Alex and a not-
so-giddy Hawk bound out of the back.
Alex excitedly gives
himself an insulin shot.
ANNA
Oh thank God, you're dead...
ALEX
It was so beautiful!
When the
blanks went off, they...
Hawk's fist whooshes into frame and blasts Alex's jaw.
HAWK
You bastard.
You fucked my
freedom for a lousy job.
ALEX
But I said I was sorry....
HAWK
No sweat, Alex, you only made the
biggest mistake of my life.
What
was your per-diem?
ALEX
Don't act like you've never committed
a crime before, Hawkins?
I know, I
made call, when Anna tracked me down I...
ANNA
Hudson, don't you understand...
HAWK
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky
I don't hit women, assuming you are
a woman.
I'm not taking anything for
granted anymore.
ANNA
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian-
organization.
The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me.
I-care-for-you...
HAWK
Oh.
Well, what's this?
Hawk pulls out the Demon Head that was in the Mayflower
Museum from out of his pocket.
Anna turns white.
ANNA
Where did you get this?
HAWK
You know, the place where you gave
the bad guys the Codex.... the
Mayflower Museum.
ANNA
It's from the machine.
All they
need is the crystal to run it and
they have 2/3 of it already.
We
can't let that happen.
ALEX
You're saying you want us to beat
them to the crystal and save the
world from financial disarray.
ANNA
Something like that.
ALEX
(pulling out plane
tix)
Well, forget about it.
Hawk and I
are going to Rio.
We're hurt,
we're tired, and a hero ain't
nothing but a sandwich.
Right,
buddy?...
ANNA
Hudson, God's given you a gift for
cat burglary, you can t just...
HAWK
You better believe I can.
I'm
sick of people telling me what I
have to do.
ANNA
It's that kind of selfish attitude
that...
HAWK
Selfish attitude?
I'm just some
guy who wants a little nap and a
cappuccino for when he wakes up,
not too much foam...
ANNA
You re not "some guy" anymore,
Hudson.
Right now, you're the
only guy.
Without your help, I....
Anna looks to Hawk with a choked-up expression.
The
weight of the world on his shoulders, Hawk turns away
to a lovely view, his mind painfully raging and
swirling toward peaceful clarity.
HAWK
The world is beautiful.
Every day
in prison I made sure to remember
that.
It's only when I actually
got out that I forgot.
If I was
sane, I'd be on that plane to Rio.
But being beaten and abused to
fulfill some corporation's
perverted vision does something to
your mental health.
The world is
beautiful and I'm tired of being
fucked.
(turning around)
It's Darwin and Minerva's turn to
bite the pillow...
Anna involuntarily does the sign of the cross.
Alex
goodnaturedly does a jerking off motion.
ANNA
That was beautiful.
ALEX
I laughed, I cried.
Shaking his head, Hawk swipes the plane tickets from
Alex.
HAWK
Rio, Alex?
After all they've
done to...Hey, these tickets are
for Moscow!
ALEX
(knowing smile)
Damn travel agency.
That Kremlin
thing is in Moscow, isn't it?
A proud Hawk slaps Alex on the back as some passing
ITALIAN LOCALS stop to stare, horrified, at Alex's
bullet holes.
Anna sweetly intervenes.
ANNA
Ketchup.
Stupido Americani...
The locals give off a slightly dazed "A-a-h" and move off.
Kaplan, Snickers, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger slam down
upon the roof of the Kremlin and discard their
parachutes.
Snickers opens up his computer screen, upon which is the
image-map of the Kremlin with a flashing blue light at
the top of the building and a flashing green one inside.
SNICKERS
We are the blue light.
The green
light is where the Art Treasures
room is.
KAPLAN
Let's go make a purple light.
Where's Kit Kat?
Dressed in cat burglar black and all chewing gum, Hawk,
Alex, and Anna crawl across the Kremlin grounds.
They
scope out a shabby Delivery Entrance.
ALEX
Delivery Entrance.
Low Security.
ANNA
Gum.
All three spit out their gum into Hawk's bag.
HAWK
Count of three?
ALEX
Why not just go now?
HAWK
Okay.
The Trio rush for the door.
THE KREMLIN ROOF
SOVIET GUARD ONE comes out on the roof to light a cig-
arette.
He looks in the distance to the motivating CIA
team.
Suddenly a card floats down into his hand.
It reads:
WILLIAM TELL.
ADAM'S APPLE.
GET IT?
The not-getting-it Guard looks up from the card as a
grinning Kit Kat parachutes behind him.
The Guard
swerves around and Kit Kat savagely skewers him with a
crossbow shot to his Adam's apple.
THE DELIVERY ENTRANCE
Hawk, Anna, and Alex race to the door, the latter
bashes it...
The agents are trotting across the roof when a phone on
Snickers' apparatus rings.
Kaplan answers it.
KAPLAN
Everything's going fine, Minerva,
thanks for asking...
A man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat.
It is THE
TRAVELING JUGGLER WITH THE UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE.
He pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule.
He begins a stoic juggle when another loud BOOM sends him
to the ground.
An explosion of steam and gas blows out the windows!
Debris frisbees toward the camera along with....
Anna, hanging on Hawk's waist, and Hawk, hanging from
the bar on DA VINCI'S BAT WINGED GLIDER.
The glider gracefully swooshes down through the castle -
through the glorious vista.
The glider floats to a perfect landing before the
Unforgettable Juggler.
JUGGLER
Che pazzo....
Hawk and Anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke
billowing castle.
They smile and gush in relief.
They
wrap arms around the confused but warming up Juggler and
laugh again.
A SMALL PIAZZA
The mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush
of dawn.
Hawk, Anna, and the unforgettable Juggler ride
atop it.
A WOMAN WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE moves to a cafe
table with a luminous smile.
She unfolds a table cloth
atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos.
Hawk and Anna dismount, thank the Juggler, then cozy into
the table.
HAWK
Have I ever told you the world is
beautiful...
(semi-seductively)
I'd really like to play
Nintendo with you, or something...
ANNA
Hudson, I'm afraid I'm sticking
with God.
(smiling)
But you're a close second, tough
guy.
What is that smile?
HAWK
(broadly grinning)
I got my planet back.
Hawk puts on a pair of sunglasses that look exactly like
the ones Da Vinci wore in the opening and raises his cup.
HAWK
The first one's for Alex.
Cheers.
The viewer's viewpoint moves into Hawk's lips having a
sip of that damn unmasculine European coffee.
FADE OUT.
THE END
