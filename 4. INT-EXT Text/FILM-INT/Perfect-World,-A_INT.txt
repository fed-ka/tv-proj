Gladys retreats
from the sparsly decorated living room to the
predictably drab
linoleum kitchen. At the table, hands on
their laps, sit
her children, NAOMI and RUTH, twin girls aged

Gladys sets a casserole on the table and goes to the frig for
a container of milk. The children WHISPER to one another...
NAOMI
Judy Baumer is going as a twirler.
RUTH
But she's so fat.
I'd go as Cinderella...
or Peter Pan.
NAOMI
Peter Pan's a boy. Tinker Bell's a girl.
Phillip could go as Peter Pan... 'cept
you gotta' fly.
Phillip smiles a bit at the notion.
RUTH
Phillip could go as a bump on a log.
The girls giggle and Phillip frowns.
PHILLIP
Why can't we go just once?
NAOMI
Caus' we jus' can't, ok?
Gladys sets milk and butter on the table and stares directly
at her son.
GLADYS
Our personal beliefs lift us to a higher
place. 'Sides, Halloween is nothing but
the Devil's work.
The DOORBELL RINGS.
The kids gulp as Gladys turns and heads

BUTCH HAYNES, a 38-year-old inmate who reeks with knowledge
procured from the wrong side of the tracks, but whose sad,
tired eyes bemoan a maximum of regret, stands on the top of a
cell bunk chipping at the ceiling.
JERRY PUGH, 29, rail thin, a punk who constantly licks his
lips, keeps watch at the door. An OLD TIMER sits on his bunk
and watches both with a cautious eye.
Butch chips through to something.
BUTCH
Damn if the old man ain't right.
Jerry smiles, turns and grabs the old man by the shirt.
JERRY
And this goes to the roof?
OLD TIMER
Used to... afore they walled it over.
JERRY
If it don't I'm gonna' rip your tongue out.
OLD TIMER
Get yer' damn hands off me!
Jerry laughs and joins Butch, who is already well on his way
to bending open a slot in a corrugated metal air shaft hidden
behind the wall.

An assembly line at the kitchen sink as the twins wash and
Phillip dries the evening dishes. Gladys sits at the kitchen
table, reading religious pamphlets and keeping a watchful eye

Phillip jumps down off his stool and races into the living
room.

Haven't heard that one in awhile.
The woman, MAE, 45, a dog-tired waitress, punches in the
numbers and returns to her post behind the counter. A
lonesome HANK WILLIAMS tune pours forth.
MAE
Not since last night.
How's the pie?
RED GARNETT, 60, a grizzled but handsome Texas Ranger, sits
at the counter slowly chewing.
RED
Kinda rubbery.
It was better yesterday.

Same pie as yesterday. Not much call

In the background we hear a SIREN. Red turns and watches a
police patrol car whiz past, lights on.
MAE
Yer off duty. Tell me, if I stopped bakin'
'em would you still come by every night?
Red, preoccupied, takes another rubbery bite.
RED
I don't know.
Mae smiles and turns her back to Red as she cleans the grill.
MAE
Naw, Red Garnett, you don't come in here
for the coffee and pie. You come in here
for the company. To see me.
Another patrol car races past.
Red's eyes follow it.

MAE
Now that I've said that, I'll go

What say I cook you dinner at my
place
sometime? Steaks, baked taters,
cold beer,

you out.
She turns to face Red but he's gone. A coupla dollars lie
next to the half-eaten pie. All she can do is sigh.

Red pulls up in front of a small house in a residential
section of town. Police cars are everywhere and several
officers are behind their vehicles, guns pointed at the house.
Red steps out of the car and is greeted by a POLICE SERGEANT,
about the same age as Red.
SERGEANT
Long time, no see. What are you doin'
here, Chief?
RED
Couldn't sleep.
Whattaya got?

They walk. Red arrives at a truck with a 10 gallon coffee
urn roped to the tailgate. He grabs a paper cup and pours.
SERGEANT
Guy holdin' his family hostage. She kicked
him out, served him divorce papers, he came
back drunk and pulled a .38. Fired two shots
but we don't think anybody's hit. Actually
you might know the guy from your sheriff
days. Hayden Webb. Been on suspension for
awhile. Ring any bells?
RED
Yeah.
Lemme talk to him.
SERGEANT
No can do.
Police jurisdiction.
Red tastes the coffee -- cold. He spits it out, pours the
contents of the cup on the ground and walks toward the front
yard. Sergeant follows.
RED
And how are you guys doin'?
SERGEANT
We got specific rules to follow in these
kinda situations, Red.
(gives in)
He won't talk. Jus' keeps yellin', crying
and waving his gun around.
Red moves forward into the yard.
SERGEANT
At least use the megaphone, you stubborn
jackass!
But Red ignores and arrives at the front door.
He knocks.
RED
Hayden, this is Red Garnett. We worked together
a few years back. Mind if I come in?
The YELLING inside STOPS and the door opens a crack.
HAYDEN,
35, distraught, peers out.
HAYDEN
'Evenin', Chief.
RED
Leave it to the P.D. They got a three-
ring circus out there and not one cup
of hot coffee. You mind?
Hayden mulls it over, then opens the door.

16D
On the couch sits Hayden's wife, JULIE, cradling her two kids,
an infant and an 8-year-old boy. Julie sobs. Her eye and
temple are bruised purple.
Red slowly enters, nods to Julie, takes off his hat and sets
it on a lampstand. Hayden has moved away from Red against
the wall. He holds the gun out at no one in particular.
HAYDEN
Julie, put a pot of coffee on.
She slowly gets up and moves to the kitchen, still weeping.
RED
Appreciate it.
Jus' what is it you want,
Hayden?
HAYDEN
I dunno... I want my job.
I want my family.
RED
What'd they suspend you for?
HAYDEN
I answer a call in South Austin. Girl
gettin' raped, that's the word. I bust
in the door, this lowlife is beatin' the
shit outta her with a tire iron. 'Help me,
help me,' she says. I take the guy down.
He bites me. I break his arm. Case closed,
right? No. She was his wife and they both
sue me and the department. The guy's about
to kill her and she sues me 'cause now he
can't pump gas. They have chump change in
the bank but they got the best lawyer in
town. Three months I'm goin' crazy. No
pay. Then my wife leaves me and I get
served divorce papers by John Reese -- a
sheriff's man. You know how embarrassin'
that is? What's happenin', Chief? I
mean, everybody's got a fuckin' lawyer!
Julie emerges from the kitchen and retakes her seat.
RED
You love her?
Love the kids?
HAYDEN
Yeah.
JULIE
Then why do you hit me!
Hayden grips the quivering revolver tight and points it
at her. Red calms the situation...

RED
You don't wanna shoot her.
HAYDEN
I swear to God I think I do.

you'd like a way out
of this whole mess...
That's where I come

Red sits on the coffee table, unloading Hayden's gun.
He
opens the cylinder and drops the shells to the floor.
A calmer Hayden exits the kitchen with Red's coffee.
Red
accepts it, takes a sip.
RED
Hits the spot.
Hayden starts to sob a bit.
Red hands over a handkerchief
which Hayden accepts.
HAYDEN
No cuffs, huh, Chief?
RED
Okay.
You ready?
Hayden nods, they stand. Red picks up his hat, sticks it
on his head, opens the door and holds it for...
Hayden, transfixed by the multitude of lights outside.
He
gulps.
RED
We'll walk out together, okay?
Hayden steps back, looks at Red, then reaches behind his
back, underneath his shirt and pulls out a .22 pistol.

Hayden points the gun at Red, freezing him.
HAYDEN
Was I a good officer, Chief?
Red nods.
HAYDEN
Was I a good deputy? The kinda man you
could depend on to do what's right?
RED
Yeah.
Hayden smiles.
HAYDEN
Thank you.
Then he turns the GUN on himself, swallows the barrel and
BLOWS his brains out.

Jerry skims through a girly magazine, turning the pages with

Butch, wearing Larry's plaid jacket, jimmies open the cash
register. He looks to the floor then to...
Jerry, who catches Butch's gaze, holds it, looks down at the
floor, then, smiling, looks back to Butch. He returns to
the skin mag.
Butch holds his stare at Jerry then, in one move, grabs a wad
of cash and hops over the counter and out of the store.
Jerry notices Butch leaving, grabs a handful of assorted
Brach's candies and hurries after.
JERRY
Hey, wait up!
Jerry's feet scurry through a pool of blood and past a
quivering hand.

It's very late, after midnight, and only a handful of people,
half of whom are cleanup crews, shuffle through the offices.
A light from an office at the end of the hall catches our

Red, behind a huge
ranchstyle desk covered with files and
paper, sips coffee
with one hand, works a buffalo nickel
through magician's
paces with the other and balances the
phone receiver in
the crook of his neck.
RED
(on phone)
Cons are creatures o' habit. Like old
coyotes, they'll crawl back into familiar
holes. Uh huh... Yeah... Sure yer' right.
Listen you go back to bed and I'll call you
in the A.M. with an update. I'll have the

Red sighs, puts the PHONE back in the hook and stares at
it until it RINGS again.

As the kitchen light comes on we see that the couch has been

Butch drives while Jerry scours the block.
JERRY
There's a Buick.
BUTCH
Don't want a Buick. Want a Ford.
JERRY
Ford's leak oil.
A car's a car.
Butch puts on the brakes and brings the car to a stop.
BUTCH
Then take the Buick.
JERRY
Soon as we cross state line I'll do just
that.
(beat)
I'm tired of riding around. I'll check
down the block... for a Ford!
Jerry gets out, slams the door, lights a cigarette and walks
away.
Butch waits a few seconds, quietly turns the key one notch
and checks the gas ggauge. It reads almost empty. He taps
it with his finger but it doesn't budge. He sighs, looks up
and sees...
JERRY
as he checks one locked car, then feeling eyes on his back,
turns, looks at Butch, grins and disappears around a corner.
BUTCH discreetly exits the car himself, carefully closing the
door without a sound.

controls herself when he brandishes the pistol. He motions
for her to open the back door. She does. He slides into the

Jerry stuffs a piece of toast in his mouth, grins at Gladys
and makes a motion to the counter.
JERRY
A lil' on the bland side.
Gimme' that
ketchup.
She picks up a bottle of Heinz and inches toward him. When
she gets close, he grabs her and forces her onto his lap. He
holds the gun to her throat and whispers in her ear.

Her shaking hands raise a forkful of eggs to his lips.
He
licks them once then gobbles with gusto.
Phillip enters the room and stops dead in his tracks.
JERRY
Well lookie here, you do got a man!
Jerry smiles at Phillip while he kisses and licks Glady's neck.
At once, Phillip darts across the room at Jerry, who backhands
the boy with his gunhand, sending Phillip sprawling.
Butch blasts through the door in an instant. With a swift
kick to the head, Jerry is knocked senseless onto the floor
against the cabinets.
The gun slides across the floor and lands at Phillip's feet.
JERRY
(holding his ear)
I'm bleedin'! You happy?
Butch gives Jerry an icy stare and kneels down to eye level
with Phillip. Butch looks at the gun and then at Phillip.
BUTCH
What's your name, boy?
PHILLIP

Ph...

BUTCH
Well, okay Phillip. Reach down and pick

Now say 'stick 'em up.'
PHILLIP

Stick 'em up...
Butch laughs and then a NOISE from outside brings him back
to reality. He grabs the gun and spins to see...
MR. CUMMINGS
Standing outside the screen door, gun leveled. Before the old
man can utter a syllable, Butch grabs Phillip and points the
gun straight at Cummings. Jerry jumps up and grabs Gladys.
BUTCH
Put the gun down, old timer. You couldn't
hit me anyway. Probably shoot the boy.
The PHONE RINGS.
BUTCH
Leave it be.
The twins wiping sleep from their eyes, wander into the room.
NAOMI

PHONE continues to RING. Cummings can't decide what to do

BUTCH
We'll take the boy.
Silence.
Gladys can't believe her ears.
Then...
GLADYS
Nooooo!!!
Jerry tosses Gladys aside. She collapses onto the floor.
The TWINS instantly start to CRY.
Phillip winds up and hits Butch as hard as he can. Butch picks
him up, directs Cummings into the kitchen with the gun and nods
for Jerry to lead.
BUTCH
You'll get him back. I swear it.

Red's deputy and boy friday, TOM ADLER, 40, lank, thinning
hair, with a face as soft as Red's is hard, warms up Red's
coffee with a jolt from the Chief's favorite plaid Thermos.
RED

Yes, Johnny, I do understand that...
The jabbering on the other end of the phone line continues
as Red's eyes squint to read the files.
INSERT - FILES
The first is Jerry's, complete with a grinning mug shot in the
upper right hand corner. There are several pages in the file,
but Red's fingers quickly peruse the top rap sheet before
turning to...
INSERT - SECOND FILE
It's Butch's and again Red's fingers start to move down the
page then they stop and move to the photo of Butch at the top
of the page.

Press has been waiting almost an hour, Red.
Red nods then notices someone at the door and motions her
in... SALLY GERBER, 28, cute in a plain, no nonsense way,
with giant curls accenting her round face in step with the
latest hair fashions, enters the room, closes the door behind
her. She's nervous as hell but trying to hide it.
Red motions her to have a seat while he finishes his call.
RED

Yeah.... Clear as a bell... Mi' sabe.
Red hangs up the phone, takes a draw on the coffee mug and

Red is confused.
He turns a blank expression to Adler.

Adler searches the messy desk for something.
ADLER
Rings a bell, Red. Believ' they sent us

Adler shakes somewhat reluctantly, not sure if he's supposed
to like her or not.
ADLER
Tom Adler.
Deputy. State Police...
System.
SALLY
It's a relatively new procedure but I
was assigned by Governor Connally...
RED
(reading from telex)
... 'to work with State law enforcement
officials in all affairs where penal
matters coincide with those of the State
Police.' It don't say nuthin' about...
SALLY

programs as well as penal escape situations.
The office PHONE BUZZES.
Adler picks it up.
ADLER
(into phone)
On our way, Marge.
Adler hangs up the phone.
ADLER
Gettin' antsy, Red. You scheduled it.
Adler hangs up, grabs Red's tie and coat from a brass rung on
the wall and hands them over. Red puts down the telex, stares
at Sally and reluctantly attempts to make himself presentable.
SALLY
The idea is that an understanding of the
particular behavioral case histories
should, in parole situations, help the
subject to avoid habitual traps and, in
penal escape situations could, conversely,
identify those self-same traps as an aide
to apprehension.

before he exits...
RED
In the first place, Miss Gerber.
SALLY
Sally, please.
RED
In the first place, Sally, it ain't a
'penal escape situation.' It's a manhunt.
Fancy words in a circle don't help much.
SALLY
And what does?
RED
A nose like a Blue Tick, a medulla with an
antenna and one helluva lot of coffee.
And with that he's out the door.

A throng of photogs and news writers stuff the undersized
room. The clamor settles when Red enters and steps behind
the lectern.
RED
Listen up, I'll only say it once. At
approximately ten o'clock last night two
inmates over to Huntsville, Robert 'Butch'
Haynes and Jerry David Pugh, escaped through
an air shaft, grabbed a prison employee's
car and got out through the main gate. At
approximately 1 A.M. we believe they robbed
a market outside of Cut-n-Shoot and killed
the store's owner.

Any sex offenses on Haynes or Pugh?

I doubt they're out of bed yet.
A few chuckles.

Red, how do you plan to apprehend the
escapees?
RED
Officially I can only say we have a full
manhunt team on their trail and we'll

She's straight from the Governor's

profiles and the like. You probably

Red steps back and to one side. Sally is taken aback but then
warms to the idea and steps to the podium for her first press
conference, ready to take on the tough questions, to show off
a bit, but....
There are no questions. In fact there is utter silence as
every raised hand drops. Eyes stare.
Red sighs and starts to walk away.
RED
Look, fellas, I got work to do.
And he heads out the door, followed by Sally's eyes and every
reporter's in the room, who commence once again to yell out
questions and mob after the Chief. Every reporter, that is,

He's near the back of the room and he smiles and raises his

Sally enters, balancing the

a nervous KAISER, the radio man,

smirk from Bobby Lee.
When the Airstream takes off again, she loses her balance and
drops one of the boxes. Adler and Suttle jump forward to help
but she gives them the evil eye.
SALLY
I've got it.
She kneels down to pick it up and feels eyes on her.
She
looks up to the men staring at...
Her skirt, raised a bit, exposing a thigh.
She calmly stands and looks to Adler, a piece of cinnamon roll
dangling on his chin.

In the b.g. we see Jerry strut to the phone booth and pore
through a thin directory. Phillip steals a glance at Butch,
who watches his rear view mirror and grits his teeth.
PHILLIP
Why'd he take the keys?
BUTCH
So I won't leave him.
PHILLIP
(a tad hopeful)
Would you leave him?
BUTCH
Oh yeah.
In the b.g. Jerry rips the 20 page phone book in half and
returns to the car, half pleased with himself. He tosses
the keys to Butch, who starts the car and drives off.
JERRY
Musta' moved. Prolly' couldn't have heard
'em anyway. Goddam ear's still bleedin'.
You ever try that shit again...
BUTCH
What?
JERRY
What?
BUTCH
You were in the middle of threatenin' me.
JERRY
(from the movies)
Ain't a threat. It's a fact.
Butch reaches over, takes Phillip's hand and places it on the
steering wheel.
BUTCH
Here kid, take the wheel.
Phillip, scared at the prospect, nevertheless does his best
to see over the dash and keep the wheel straight. Butch
turns back over the seat to confront Jerry.
BUTCH
In two seconds I'm gonna' break your nose.
That's a threat...

Before Jerry has time to snicker Butch hits him full in the
face and grabs the gun. Blood spurts from Jerry's nose and
the injured man cups his hands over the wound.
Butch spins and retakes the wheel from a frightened Phillip.
BUTCH
... And that's a fact.
Instead of expressing outrage, Jerry slinks back down in the
seat wearing a look of pure hatred.
JERRY
I'm gonna' kill you for that.
BUTCH
And that's a threat. Beginnin' to
understand the difference?
Somethin' catches Butch's eye and he turns and slows down and
turns into...
45
46
BUTCH
Okay, Phillip, listen up. I'm gonna'
run in here and get some smokes.
JERRY
Get beer.
Butch hands Phillip the revolver.
BUTCH
Here, hold it like this.... And point it
right between his eyes.
JERRY
What the hell?...
BUTCH
(to Phillip)
If he so much as moves you pull the trigger
... right here... Put your finger on it.
Jerry snickers and then laughs maniacally. Butch reaches
over and cocks the pistol. Jerry's guffaws stop on a dime.
JERRY
Yer' a fuckin' crazy man.
(CONTINUED)

BUTCH
And that's a fact. I believe yer

Butch steps out of the car and heads for the market.

Butch enters.
A short fat man with a fishing cap is sweeping
up.
BUTCH
How-do.
Where's yer' sodees?
MAN
Hot in the first aisle.
Cold in the
back, in the cooler.
48
48
Phillip's slightly shaking hands hold the pistol pointed
directly at Jerry's head.
JERRY
You ever shot a gun before, boy?
No answer. Phillip steals a glance at the store, anxious for
Butch to return.
JERRY
Powww!!!...
It'll knock you on your ass.
PHILLIP
Be quiet, mister.
JERRY
Naw. You ain't never shot no gun before.
Livin' in a house with three split tails...
no Daddy around. You'll prolly' grow up
queer, you know that?
A bead of sweat rolls down Phillip's cheek.
JERRY
Now I'm gonna' lean up here real slow,
okay? So we can talk.
Jerry raises his hands, palms up and slowly leans forward in
the back seat. Phillip's hand quivers but he doesn't pull
the trigger.
JERRY
There we go. Now we can have a 'man to
man.' You are a man, ain't ya'?

Butch dumps a six pack of RC Colas, a handful of Moon Pies,
a handful of beef jerky and some gum on the counter.
50

Jerry's chin is on the front seat now and his arms are draped
over it.
JERRY
Those are cute little underwears you got
there, boy. Say does your mama sew yer'
name in 'em, initials or anything?
Jerry's hand slowly reaches down to the white briefs. He
places one finger in the front elastic waistband and slowly
pulls it open.
JERRY
Whatcha' got in there?
Jerry sneaks a peek.
JERRY
Kinda' puny, ain't it?
Phillip, diverted, looks down.
In a flash Jerry grabs the
gun.
JERRY
The hand is quicker than the eye.
Jerry flicks open the revolver, spins it -- empty slots.
JERRY
(re: Butch)
That sonofabitch. Hell's bells, no
shells.
51

The Old Man puts down his broom and ambles to the register.
OLD MAN
This be all for ya'?
BUTCH
This and a carton of Chesterfields.

Are those .38 shells? Gimme a box.
The Old Man puts the cigs and shells on the counter and starts
to tally the bill on a notepad.

OLD MAN
With deposit comes to four dollars eighty.
Butch reaches in his pocket and extracts the wad stolen from
the convenience store. The Old Man takes note. Butch
selects a five and places it on the counter.
OLD MAN
Land's sake.
What line of work you in?
The Old Man bags the goods, but Butch takes the shells and
puts them in his coat pocket.
BUTCH
Used cars. Buy 'em, fix 'em up. Sold a
Cadillac down in Madisonville this mornin'.
OLD MAN
Don't say.
52
52
Jerry puts his gun hand around Phillip's neck and pulls the
sobbing boy closer. Jerry rests his face on Phillip's neck.
JERRY
Come over a little closer.
As Jerry
groans, Phillip seizes the moment and bites Jerry
hard on
the ear. Jerry screams and drops the gun, which
Phillip
picks up and carries with him as he scurries out of
the car
and into the hay field.
Jerry, in pain, now with both ears bleeding, crawls out of
the back seat and gives chase.

The place is a functioning mobile headquarters now. Adler on
the short wave and tacking up a map, Bobby Lee still in his
corner, Red and Sally sitting across from one another at the
"kitchen table".
In the rear section of the Airstream Red's chair and a mini
office for the Chief have been put together.
ADLER
Got a spot on 'em. A store right outside
of Benhur. About 20 miles from here.
Adler sets down the mike, sticks a tack on the map and stands
back.
RED
All right. Push the roadblock on 288
north by 50 miles.
Kaiser calls in the instructions. (NOTE:
Kaiser's radio
transmissions are not scripted but go on a lot of the time
we're in the Airstream. In addition, his
and Adler's direc-

ADLER
Ya' figger' they're that far along?
RED
Hell, I dunno'and neither do they. They're
jus' happy to be out. It's a high speed
Sunday drive to them.
ADLER
Sunday drive. I like that. Never heard
you use that one before, Red.
Sally is watching Red and listening to all of this with a
troubled look on her face. Red notices...
RED
Somethin' eatin' at you?
SALLY
It's... perhaps premature, but do you have
an auxiliary roadblock plan for when they
split up?
Everyone stares.
No one ever questions Red.
ADLER
What makes you so sure they won't stay
together?
Sally hesitates.
Red notices...
RED
You got somethin' to say, spit it out.
SALLY
Their situation is one of accommodation.
They won't be together long.
Silence.
Sally continues.
SALLY
Haynes and Pugh are opposites. Haynes is
a criminal's criminal -- armed robbery,
mano y mano confrontation. Pugh, on the
other hand, has a rap sheet littered with
molestation and petty crime. They'll
split sheets soon.
ADLER
(still on attack)
What about the hostages? They gonna' flip
a coin to see who gets to keep who?
Red rises and walks to the sink.
He rinses a spoon.

SALLY
It's happened before. Either way it's a
dilemma they'll address soon.
(beat)
That's why we should address it now.
She looks to Red.
He refuses to return her gaze.
RED
We don't have a dilemma. And neither do
they. They'll keep one hostage... and get
rid of one, if they haven't already.
SALLY
Okay... which one?
RED
If there's a SNAFU, who's John Q. Public
more likely to give a rat's ass about --
an innocent boy or a goddam bureaucrat.
Red wipes the water off the spoon on his shirt and walks to
his office in the back. Adler, Bobby Lee and Kaiser chuckle
lightly at their boss's snubbing of the female upstart in
their midst. Sally's face glows a bright red.
59
59
Red sits in his office chair, pulls out the spoon and pours
Geritol from a bottle into his coffee. He doesn't even look
up when Sally enters, a stern look on her face.
SALLY
We need to talk, Chief Garnett.
RED
Call me Red.
SALLY
Red.
(beat)
Why are you so hell-bent on embarassing me?
RED
I'm hell-bent on one thing. You hang
around long enough you'll find that out.
Til' then a tough backside and a sense of
humor will get you through a lot.
SALLY
I have a fine sense of humor, but the one
thing I won't do is be your straight man
so you can play hero to a bunch of morons
who think you're some kind of hillbilly
Sherlock Holmes.

Red sips from the mug calmly then groans, his face contorted.
RED
Awful. Arthur Godfrey says it keeps ya'
young, but I'm not sure it's worth it.
SALLY
I'd like an answer.
RED
This yer' first time out of an office?
She refuses to answer.
RED
Thought so.
What'd ya' expect ya' signed
on for?
Adler, Bobby Lee and Kaiser all watch the discussion, smiles
on their faces. Sally abruptly closes the door.
SALLY
You think I'm what? Some dumb schoolgirl
who wandered into the boy's locker room?
Well you're wrong. I don't mean to boast,
but I happen to be one of the two most
intelligent people involved in this fiasco.
RED
Didn't ask that.
Asked what you expected.
SALLY
I expected to be allowed to do the job
assigned to me by the Governor.
RED
I happen to like the Governor, hunt quail
together every year. But deep down he and
I know that win, lose or draw this is my
ship, not his.
SALLY
The Governor as chief executive officer
of this state bears ultimate responsibility
for...
RED
... Bullshit. Responsibility lies with the
one that loses sleep; the one with the most
ulcers. This mess turns bloody -- and it
might -- all it's gonna cost the Governor
is a few votes! Me, I'm the one that's...

Red catches himself about to get too personal. He takes
another swig of his coffee/geritol. Sally softens her stance.
SALLY
You're the one that what?
But Red side-steps.
RED
Tell ya' what. You think I'm makin' a
wrong turn you speak up. Might not agree,
but I'll listen. As far as stepped on
toes and wounded pride, I'll buy everyone
a drink when we head for home. Not until.
I got more to worry about.
(beat)
That sound fair to you?
SALLY
Yes.
RED
Well okay then.
Sally turns, about to leave.
RED
So who's the other one?
SALLY
Other one?
RED
If yer' one brain, who's the other?
SALLY
Haynes.
He was tested in prison.

Butch drives and catches an occasional glance at Phillip who
sits quietly, but who, too, steals looks at his captor
between swigs of RC Cola.
He finishes off the bottle. Butch reaches in the sack for
another, pops the top on the dashboard and hands it to
Phillip.
PHILLIP
Thankyew.

Butch notices that Phillip is pretty somber as he tugs on
another RC.
BUTCH

PHILLIP
Nuthin'.
BUTCH

Phillip nods.

Lemme' ask you somethin'.
You right or
left handed?
Phillip meekly holds up his right hand.
The car races
forward.
BUTCH
Then that's the way we'll go. You ever
ridden in a time machine before?
Phillip shakes his head.
BUTCH
Sure you have.
Whattaya' think this is?
PHILLIP
A car.
BUTCH
Yer' lookin' at this thing bassackwards.
This is a 20th Century time machine.
I'm the captain and you're the navigator.
Butch points forward through the dash.
BUTCH
Out there... that's the future.
Butch taps on the rearview mirror.
BUTCH
Back there... that's the past. If life's
moving too slow and you wanna' project
yerself into the future you step here on
the gas. See?
He does so and the Impala surges forward.
BUTCH
And if yer' enjoyin' the moment yer' in,
well hell, just step on the brake here
and you can slow it down.

Then he laughs uproariously and steps on the gas.

The Airstream sits in the parking lot of the store.
Bradley
and Suttle sit up front in the truck.
Bradley turns the knob on an intercom speaker system next
to the radio.
SUTTLE
It's an intercom speaker system. You can
get and give instructions to and from the
rear of the vehicle.
BRADLEY
How's it work?
SUTTLE
You push the power button but if you've
got the volume turned up...
Bradley pushes the power button. The SYSTEM SQUAWKS LOUDLY
and then CREAKS TINNILY. Speakers blown.
SUTTLE

Sheeeit...
Red cringes, his ears still ringing from the squawk, and turns

thumbtacks at crossroads indicated by the circle mark.
ADLER
That oughta' put his pecker in a sling,
huh, Red?
(remembers Sally)
Sorry, ma'am.
SALLY
(ignoring Adler)
Shouldn't these be roadblocked as well?
She points to several other unmarked roads.
RED
Sooner or later he'll get on a main road.
We don't got the manpower to roadblock
every farm to market.
ADLER
In a perfect world, Miss Gerber, we'd lock
arms and thrash the bush til' he turned up...
SALLY
In a perfect world things like this wouldn't
happen in the first place.
Adler hears something on his headset, turns to Red.
ADLER
Locals are heading out.
Wanna' follow?
RED
Let's sit tight.
He'll turn up.

BUTCH
Ok, Phillip, we're gonna do some
car
shoppin'. You ever play cowboys

See that Ford sedan? Now I want
you to
sneak on over there like an Injun

a peek and see if the keys is in
it.
Phillip hesitates.
BUTCH
Don't have to if you don't wanna... but
I'd appreciate it... You bein' the new
navigator and all.
Phillip thinks it over then opens the door and slips out.
BUTCH
Hey, Phillip, check for a radio, too.

The CAR is SCREECHING down the road but the Farmer holds on
for dear life and auto. He claws at Phillip, who does his
best to fend off flailing hands and fingers.

Butch shakes his head and laughs.

Sitting still. Bradley tries to light a cigarette with

BRADLEY

Lighter don't work. Put that on the list.
Bobby Lee sits alone in the back corner of the main room of

cynically at Sally.
Adler takes the latest info off the radio while the others

ADLER

SALLY
He likes Fords.
Adler looks at the map.
ADLER
Looks like you was right, Red. He's off

Whattaya' wanna' do?
RED
Beef up the I-20 roadblock.
Adler gets more news through the headsets.
ADLER
What's that?

Adler puts the headphones back on.
Bobby Lee smirks a bit.

Red gives her a look that says, "Don't defend me".

I suppose you figger' he'll jus' give up.
SALLY
Maybe, maybe not.
BOBBY LEE
Well now there's a safe bet.

Butch and Phillip enter. Butch holds the door open and smiles
at them. They say "thanks" but can't help but notice Phillip,
cowering behind Butch, still clad in his underwear. He hides
behind a nearby display which reads: Cast Your Vote For
Friendly's Friendliest Clerk!
A clerk, LUCY, 30, holding a handful of shoeboxes notices
their entrance. She's schoolmarmish with a smile that looks
like it's painted on.
LUCY
Well, hello there and welcome to Friendly's.
Looks like the little fella' needs some pants.
BUTCH
As a matter of fact. Shoes and new skivvies,
too. He'll tell you his size. Go with the
lady, Buzz.
Phillip, still in somewhat of a daze, doesn't recognize his
own "name".
BUTCH
Buzz!
Phillip snaps to, cracks a smile at Butch and follows the lady
to the children's section of the store.
LUCY
Buzz, what a cute name.
Like a bee.
BUTCH
walks past the cash register, gives the clerk behind the desk
a wink and proceeds to an aisle which features hardware, rope,
tape, nails, etc. He stoops and grabs a shank...

aisle and drop a pair of jeans and sneakers onto the counter.
LUCY
Here's the clothes, but Buzz has his
heart set on a Halloween costume for
next year. It is half off.

We'll get it next time.
Go get in the

once again, the Halloween display.
BUTCH
pays Paula, then stuffs a $20 in her blouse.
BUTCH
You are truly the friendliest clerk I
ever met.
She blushes a "thank you" as Butch makes a hasty retreat to
the door.
PAULA
(an afterthought)
Thank you for shopping Friendly's!

Phillip stands at the costume display, looks around, then
grabs a Casper costume carton, stuffs it under his T-shirt
and walks quickly to the door.

Butch checks the back seat. No Phillip, no Buzz.
He checks
the rear view mirror and sees...

Pete, his cherry top spinning, pulls in behind Butch, blocking
his entrance to the main street.

Butch, driving like a maniac, turns into the back alley and
steps on it. All at once he mashes on the BRAKES and comes
to a SQUEALING stop.
HIS POV
The alley is a dead end.
BACK TO SCENE
Butch rips the CAR into reverse and SQUEALS all the way back
to the original side alley.

Lucy and Paula peer from behind the counter at Phillip and
the fracas taking place in the street.
LUCY
I knew something was wrong from the get-go.
They spot Phillip standing a few feet in front of the door.
PAULA
Look, he left his little boy.
LUCY
And look, the little rascal has... he's
no better than...
PAULA
What?!...
LUCY
He's got that Casper costume.
He stole it!

The GLASS DOOR and surrounding WINDOWS SHATTER into a million
pieces, sending Lucy, Paula, makeup, pantyhose, grins and all
into a heap on the floor.

Paula emerges from behind the counter and stares at Lucy, on
the ground amidst glass and mayhem.
PAULA
Say what you want. I'm keepin' the twenty.

The car is parked in a field of some sort.
Butch reaches in
the back seat for the bag of clothing.
BUTCH
Here, take them nasty skivvies off and
put on yer' jeans.
He spots Phillip's not so successful effort to hide the
costume box.
BUTCH
Whatya' got there?
PHILLIP
A ghost suit.
BUTCH
From the store?
You kyped it?
Phillip nods, expecting the worst.
BUTCH
Well, hell, Phillip, put it on.
PHILLIP
You ain't mad?

Stealin's wrong, ok? But if there's
somethin' you need bad and you ain't got
the money, then it's okay to take a
loaner on the item. It's what ya' call
an exception to the rule.
Phillip tears into the box, rips out the costume, looks at it,
starts to take off his underwear then balks. Butch notices.
BUTCH
What's wrong?
PHILLIP
Nuthin'.
Butch notices Phillip's hands covering his crotch.
BUTCH
What? You don't wanna' get undressed,
is that it?
Phillip shrugs.
BUTCH
You embarrassed caus' I might see yer'
pecker?
PHILLIP
It's... puny.
BUTCH
What?
PHILLIP
It's puny.
BUTCH
Well hell, lemme' see.
Phillip still hesitates.
BUTCH
Go on.
I'll shoot ya' straight.
Phillip gingerly pulls off his underwear. Butch smiles a
broad grin.
BUTCH
Hell no, Phillip, it's good size for a
boy yer' age!
Phillip, remasculated, smiles and starts to put on the
costume.
BUTCH
Here they come.

Sally, deep in her files.
She looks up from the file to...
ANOTHER ANGLE
Bobby Lee who sits by himself, whittling away at a stick and
leering at her. Adler is at the map, holding the shortwave
mike and wearing the earphones. Behind him, Red stares out
the window.
ADLER
Haynes bought tape, rope, and some clothes
for the boy.
Red comes to and turns to Adler. Sally smiles almost to her-
self. She was right -- Haynes is looking after the boy.
Everyone knows it, but no one says anything.
ADLER
One puzzler though. They say the boy
could have gotten away but didn't.
SALLY
Probably scared to death.
ADLER
That's not all. The kid stole a
Halloween outfit.
RED
Holy Jeezus, they're a team.
ADLER
With the pit stop in Noodle looks like
he's headed for the Panhandle.
Red sighs and groans. Unpleasant news but somehow he knew it.
He moves to the back room for another shot of Geritol.
SALLY
(to Red)
What?
ADLER
There's more roads than people in the
Panhandle.

SALLY
How's that happen?
KAISER
(over his shoulder)
Poor counties. They tend to half finish
roads then start on another one.
ADLER
But if anybody knows them backroads it's
Red.
Sally lifts her head, watches Red reenter the room, then
stares out the window.
SALLY
Okay, so... I'm Robert Haynes. Called
Butch by everyone. I was born in
Amarillo, but grew up in the French
Quarter of New Orleans.
ADLER
(sotto voce)
What's she doin', Red?
SALLY
I killed a man when I was eight.
Silence. Nobody seems willing to play along.
Red turns
from the window to Sally.
RED
How'd ya' kill him?
SALLY
Shot him with a pistol. There was always
one around the dance hall. That's what
they called it but it was a whorehouse.
We lived there.
Red moves away from the discussion and stands at the front
of the Airstream, staring out the front window.
ADLER
What'd the authorities do?
SALLY
The victim was wanted by the locals so
the whole thing got shoved under the
carpet Cajun-style.
ADLER
They didn't even stick him in juvy?

SALLY
They were.
For awhile.
When I'm twelve
mom dies.
ADLER
What happened?
SALLY
Delilah Jane Haynes hung herself in the
bathroom of the brothel. Could have saved
herself the trouble. Post-mortem check
uncovered last stage syphilis.
KAISER
Where's yer' father?
Red's face tells us he's listening.
SALLY
Nobody knows where he is now. Ditched
when I was six. He was a small-time felon.
Popped up again after Mom died -- he'd just
been paroled. Moved us back to Amarillo.
A year later I'm in trouble again.
ADLER
Yeah?
Kill somebody else?
SALLY
Took a joyride in a Ford coupe that I
just couldn't resist.
KAISER
Hell, that's no big deal.
SALLY
Judge gave me four years in Gatesville,
toughest juvy farm in Texas.
ADLER
That's where the son-of-a-bitch learned
to be a criminal. Seen that before,
ain't we, Red?
Red doesn't answer.
He seems in a faraway place.

So, Butch, why don't you tell us where
yer' goin', save us the trouble o'
huntin' you down?
SALLY
Where I'm going isn't as important as
'Why am I going there?'
BOBBY LEE
(tired of the game)
Shit. 'Caus' I'm runnin' and they're chasin'
and I'd jus' as soon go north as south as
east as west. It's a fun lil' parlor game,
lady, but right now Butch Haynes don't
have the slightest idea where he's headed!
104A
Phillip, now fully-attired in his Casper outfit and mask, is
looking at a folded map while Butch drives.
BUTCH
An inch is 24 miles. Hold yer' pointin'
finger along the line of the road. You
got three lines on your finger, don'tcha'?
Each one's an inch. So how many inches
to Childress?
Phillip holds one finger to the map, then another.
PHILLIP
One, two... six.
BUTCH
Yer' a helluva' navigator, Phillip. A lot
smarter than Jerry. But I guess that's not
sayin' a lot.
Something catches Phillip's eye.

Bradley presses the pedal to the floor. The ENGINE STRAINS.
Suttle nervously sneaks a peek at the speedometer.
SUTTLE
It's... it's not safe to go over 65 with

The speedometer reaches 80.
The ENGINE SCREAMS.

The whole thing is shaking, twisting, bumping.
All aboard try

SUTTLE
Yer burnin' up the engine!
But Bradley pays no heed.
111F
Bobby Lee unholsters his pistol and leans back out the
window. Red spots him.
RED
Holster that firearm and get yer ass

Bobby Lee thinks it over, shakes his head in disgust and
holsters his piece.

Butch spots an opening and...
BUTCH
Hold on, Phillip!

Airstream behind them.
SUTTLE
Ahhhh!!
They're gone!!!
Bradley looks in the rear-view mirror, turns around and
screams, too. Without visual guidance...

It's an anti-gravity room what with the files, coffee, maps
and bodies flying around.

Adler, still wearing the headphones, rises first and goes to
the radio to answer an incoming call.
Red groans. Sally crawls to her feet and offers Red a helping
hand, which he accepts.

RED
What?
ADLER
They wanna know if the boy looked
okay?

A large group of very serious advisors sit and stand in a
circle around the Governor's desk. Across from GOVERNOR
CONNALLY sits a nervous, near tears GLADYS PERRY. An AIDE
on the telephone, turns to the Governor.
AIDE
They say the boy looked A-okay.
Governor Connally nods, sighs, and reaches hand across the
desk and touches Gladys's shoulder.
GOVERNOR
He'll be fine, Mrs. Perry. This whole
nightmare will be over and done with very
soon and you'll be home with your boy. I
promise.
Gladys, distraught, nods. Governor Connally discreetly nods
to a photographer in the group while keeping his hand on
Gladys's shoulder. A CAMERA'S FLASH causes everyone to blink
in reaction.

The Airstream is fast becoming a pig sty. Coke bottles,
coffee spills, overfull ashtrays, etc. are everywhere. Adler
holds the mike and stares at the thumbtacked map.
ADLER
(into mike)
Spur 208 northbound. And 83 at Aspermont
coming and going.
(to Red)
That it?
RED
Yeah.
Adler moves to set down the mike and topples a cup of coffee.
It spills on the floor. Suttle grabs a towel to wipe it up
but realizing the futility of keeping the Airstream clean, he
simply throws it aside.

Butch drives while Phillip digs through the sack and comes
up with a jar of mustard.
BUTCH
You sure there's no meat in there? Spam
maybe, Vienna sausages, anything like that?
PHILLIP
Nawsir.
BUTCH
Well, I bet you can make us some mustard
sandwiches, can't ya'?
PHILLIP
Yeahsir.
BUTCH
Well go to it.
Phillip breaks out the loaf of bread and lays out four
slices on the dashboard.
PHILLIP
How many?
BUTCH
Many as you want.
Phillip
lays out six more slices. The dashboard is now
covered
with bread. Phillip pulls out the mustard but has no
knife.
Butch pulls out a stick of gum and hands it to
Phillip
to spread with.
As they drive
along they pass a large, happy family (Mom, Dad,
girl 5, boy 7)
picnicking in the dip of a long hill alongside
the highway.
From the look of their brand-new loaded down
station wagon
they are on vacation.
CLOSEUP - PHILLIP
Mesmerized by the family.
CLOSEUP - BUTCH
Ditto.
He pulls his eyes back to the road, notices something.
128
130
It's
full to the brim with the Family Bob plus two, Butch
and
Phillip, who ride in the back with Bob's son. As the
car
approaches the roadblock Butch grabs a blanket, reclines,
and
hides behind a stuffed animal.
BOB
Sorry for the inconvenience, Edgar. The
kids like the back down like that so they
can play.
BUTCH
No trouble at all, Bob.
131
133
As in the old Westerns, it's quiet, too quiet. The
inside of
the RV is pretty much trashed now -- the product of
men
working in close contact. Sally stares at a file.
The
silence is broken as Red spits tobacco juice into an
empty
Coke bottle.
Sally peruses a file.
INSERT - FILE
It's Butch's again. She's reading an addendum page with
JUVENILE COURT RECORD stamped at the top. A photo of 14-year-
old Butch is stapled in the corner.
BACK TO SCENE
Sally finds something very interesting.
She looks up at Red.
He returns her stare.
RED
What?
134
135
Adler is getting something on the shortwave.
ADLER
(to Red)
They've got two Highway Patrol cars they
can give to us now.
RED
Tell 'em stand by. We got the
best seat

move north. Check every road,
every farm

Adler surveys the map and sticks in a few more thumbtacks.
ADLER
He knows he's hemmed in. I predict we'll
have him singing a different tune by
nightfall.
136
137
Butch, truly "singing a different tune," whistles "Old
MacDonald." Bob joins in and soon the whole damn Family Bob
is whistling the tune.
Bob's daughter PATSY, 5, red hair, freckles, starts jumping
up and down on the back seat, singing and spilling her drink.
BOB'S SON
You're spilling!
You're spilling!
Bob and his Wife immediately turn around.
WIFE
Patsy!
Look at what you're doing?!
BOB
Ahhh noooo!
Bob's wife grabs Patsy by the arm and shakes her. Butch con-
tinues to whistle softly, almost eerily, but he's watching
closely.
BOB'S WIFE
Look at what you did! It's all over
the seat of your father's new car!
The little girl
starts to cry while Bob grabs at tissues
feverishly and
hands them to his Wife who, leaning over the
seat is wiping
hard at the stain. She grabs her daughter's
arm and shakes
her, staring into her face.
Butch, directly behind the little girl, watches closely.
BOB'S WIFE
What is wrong with you?! I told you twice
not to jump up and down! Didn't I!!
Patsy bawls harder than ever. Bob's Wife finishes wiping and
reseats herself in the front seat.

BOB'S WIFE
So much for the new car smell.
The little girl muffles her tears.
Butch smiles sincerely then looks to the passing landscape.
BUTCH
This will do fine right here, Bob.
But I
do have one more favor to ask.

Butch STARTS the CAR and he and Phillip slowly pull away.

Well, uh...
Adler jumps up and goes to the frig.
ADLER

A skinny, small town WAITRESS checks her face in a bathroom
mirror. She applies too much lipstick and pinches her cheeks
before exiting. We FOLLOW as she exits the kitchen bathroom
door, grabs two already prepared hamburger platter specials
from beside the grill and moves through a swinging door into
the diner. A counter, three booths, grease everywhere...
She sets the two plates in front of Butch and Phillip at a
booth.
Butch digs in but Phillip holds for a beat. Butch notices
and stops chewing while Phillip says "grace".

She brazenly stares a hole through Butch as she lifts a slice
of pickle off his plate, places it in her mouth and slowly
chews.
Phillip, mouth full, takes note of the confusing spectacle.
Eileen turns to walk away.
EILEEN
If you need me, I'll be right over here.

Bobby Lee slides in behind her.
BOBBY LEE

She doesn't back down, instead looking him straight in the
eye.
SALLY
Excuse me?
BOBBY LEE
Well yer' not smart but you are pretty.
Sally stares right at Bobby Lee then moves for the door.
He
shifts his position and blocks her.

Bobby Lee and Red are left standing face to face.

Bobby Lee flinches first and moves back into the main room.
Red follows.
ADLER
That's the Governor's line, Red!
Red calmly walks past Sally who smiles a "thanks". He gives

Eileen slides back down toward Butch. She makes refilling
condiment bottles the sexiest pasttime since the hula hoop.
EILEEN
Very polite.
BUTCH
I try hard but, ya' know, since his mama
died...
PHILLIP
-- My mama's not dead!
Butch, a tad annoyed, turns to Phillip and gives him a look.
Once again, when he turns back, Eileen has moved.
She's flirting with Butch, moving, bending, wiping her hands
on her hips. His eyes are focused on her every squirm.
BUTCH
(over his shoulder)
Okay now, Buzz, you go on out in the parking
lot and chunk some rocks or something.
BACK TO SCENE
Phillip reluctantly slides down off the stool and slowly walks
out the door. His eyes stay on Butch and Eileen, barely
concealing confusion mixed with a hint of jealousy.
EILEEN
So is she dead or not?
BUTCH
(covering badly)
Well his biological mother is alive. Gave
him up for adoption to me and my wife. My
dead wife, that is. She is, was Phil, er
Buzz's stepmother, so she's his mom, was his
mom, stepmom, but... she's dead.

EILEEN
I'm so sorry.
But she's not.
In fact it seems to have turned her on even
more.
She puts her hand behind Butch's neck and slowly pulls him
close for gentle kiss.

A one room addition office built onto
the kitchen. It has a
desk against one wall, a few chairs, a
fan -- pretty sparse.
Two large windows throw light from the
outside neon sign onto
the room. A large lamp provides harsh
light.
Eileen leads Butch by the hand into the room, closing the door
behind them. At once they are all over each other. Butch
lifts her up onto the desk and starts to kiss her face and
neck. Then, in an instant, he flips her over, pulls the
ribbon from her hair and unzips the back of her waitress
outfit to the waist. He kisses her neck, her back and
suddenly, passionately, he flips up her skirt and begins
kissing her voluptuous backside.
152A
Phillip's nose is pressed to the glass.
In fact if he pressed
any harder there wouldn't be any glass.
152B BUTCH AND EILEEN
152B
hold their pose for a second until...
152C PHILLIP
152C
comes back to real time and bolts away into the darkness of
the parking lot.
EILEEN
Nosy little feller'.
152D BUTCH
152D
races to the side window and watches as Phillip runs into the
parking lot.
BUTCH
Phillip!...
EILEEN
(a last try)
I keep a cot in the back.
But Butch, still at the window, just keeps breathing.
153
154
Silence. Butch drives away libidinous desires, Phillip sits
quietly, staring straight ahead, now and again stealing a peek
at Butch.
PHILLIP
You mad at me?
BUTCH
(curt)
No.
More silence.
PHILLIP
You kissed her, huh?
BUTCH
(much regret)
Jus' barely.
PHILLIP
Why?
BUTCH
Caus' it feels good. Ain't you ever seen
your mama kiss a man?
PHILLIP
No.
(beat)
You kissed her backside, huh?
BUTCH
It's, well, uh, it's kinda' hard to
explain. I know how it musta' looked.
(beat)
Hell, I don't know how it looked....
As Butch's voice trails off silence overtakes the car. After
a few seconds Butch seems happy not to have to answer any
more questions. Phillip fidgits with the door handle.
Several more seconds pass, then...
(CONTINUED)
98.
154
CONTINUED:
154
PHILLIP
Do you love her?
BUTCH
Who?
PHILLIP
The lady that cooked the hamburgers?
Butch ponders this, then a grin slides across his face.
BUTCH
Yeah, Phillip, I love her.
(beat)
Kissed her butt didn't I?
And they both start to laugh.
155
156
Butch KILLS the ENGINE but keeps the RADIO MUSIC on low.
BUTCH
Things go our way we'll be in Alaska in
four or five days. Get the jump on winter.
Phillip looks a little sad.
BUTCH
What's wrong?
PHILLIP
I wanna' go home.
BUTCH
If you wanted to go home so bad, why
didn't you stay at that store today?
(CONTINUED)
99.

PHILLIP
Caus'.
BUTCH
Caus' why?
PHILLIP
'Caus' I stole. They'd put me in jail.
Prolly' go to hell.
Butch chuckles at the notion.
BUTCH
Same difference.
We'll get you home soon.
I swear, okay?
PHILLIP
Butch?
BUTCH
Yeah, Phillip?
PHILLIP
I can drive.
BUTCH
Done proved that ain'tcha'? There's lots
and lots of stuff you can do, Phillip.
(gets an idea)
Reach in that glovebox there. See if
Bob's got a notepad or something.
Phillip extracts a small ringed memo pad.
BUTCH
Good old Bob. Can you write?
PHILLIP
I can print.
BUTCH
Good enough. Now I want you to make a
list of everything you ever wanted to do
but wasn't allowed to. Okay?
PHILLIP
Like what?
BUTCH
Like... cotton candy.
PHILLIP
Cotton candy?

The aftermath of a full scale Texas Bar-B-Q: plates full of
gristle and bone, cigarettes burning in ashtrays and swirl-
ing in half-drunk bottles of Coke and mugs of coffee, men
groaning and picking their teeth with toothpicks.
Bradley, Adler and Suttle are dead-ass asleep and snoring.
Bobby Lee, too mean to sleep, sits by himself cleaning his
fingernails with a pocket knife.

resting on Phillip's lap.
BACK TO SCENE
His fingers release it as he drifts to sleep.
CLOSEUP - PHILLIP
asleep, the way a child sleeps.
Soundly.

also asleep, but only his body -- his mind works over-

DISSOLVE TO:
161
SERIES OF SHOTS - BUTCH'S DREAM
161
(NOTE: the entire dream is a series of snapshots to a
strong Coonass beat)
A)
A baby snapshot of Butch.
(CONTINUED)
105.
161
CONTINUED:
161
B)
A Haynes family photo -- a grizzled father standing
behind a mother seated holding a baby. They stand
in front of a small, white framed house.
C)
Extreme closeup -- The baby in the snapshot - Butch.
D)
Snapshot of a young Butch, age 6, with his father and
another adult male, who are both holding deer rifles
with one hand and with the other the antlers and head
of a dead deer.
E)
Extreme closeup -- Butch's father from the same photo.
F)
Snapshot of Butch, 8, with his mother but no father.
G)
An establishing snapshot of a nightclub in New Orleans.
The gaudy sign above the joint reads: CLUB - DANCE HALL.
H)
A snapshot of Butch's mother dressed in a somewhat
sleazy Latino outfit. She's surrounded by 3 or 4
lounge lizard types, whose hands are all placed on
parts of her body. She has a drunken sneer on her face.
I)
Snapshot of Butch, 8, being taught to dance in the club
by his mother. He looks awkwardly into the camera.
J)
Snapshot of Butch, 8, sitting on the bar of the club,
surrounded by a motley group of sleazy "dime dancers".
K)
Another snapshot of Butch being taught to dance by his
drunken mother.
(NOTE: A heavy MACHINE GROWL should START LOW and INCREASE
IN VOLUME through the remainder of these fast-paced series
of cuts.)
L)
Snapshot of Mom dancing very closely, too closely, to
a handsy patron of the club.
M)
Snapshot of Mom kissing the same man.
We see a tattoo
on his arm.
N)
Extreme closeup -- the tattoo. It is of a naked
girl. The words "hell-bent" in cursive frame the
tattoo.
O)
Snapshot of Mom sitting on the tattooed man's lap at
the bar. His hand is resting on the inner portion of
her thigh.
P)
Snapshot of Butch at the bar with the club bartender.
Q)
Same as (K) -- Butch being taught to dance.

T)
Extreme closeup -- Butch in same photo.
U)
Same as (O).
Mom with tattooed man.
V)
Extreme closeup -- tattooed man from same photo.
W)
Snapshot of crime scene in the bar. A man lies
on the
floor in a pool of blood. Onlookers, including
some of
the dime dancers and Butch's mom, express their
shock
at the incident while police photographers and
newsmen
look on.
X)
Extreme closeups
-- Some of the onlookers faces.
Y)
Extreme closeup
-- Butch's mom's face. As
opposed to
the others, her
face is rather displaced.
You'd think
she'd witnessed
a fender bender instead of a murder.
Z)
Extreme closeup -- The face of the victim.
It's
the tattooed man.
AA)
Extreme closeup -- The tattoo.
The ROAR of the MACHINE GROWL is now DEAFENING as the image
of the tattoo...
FADES INTO:
162
BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT
162
that FILLS the FRAME.
Except it's brighter than the brightest day as a high power
light shines directly at...
EXTREME CLOSEUP - BUTCH
who exits his dream and enters reality with a throttled
shock. He squints and tries to discern the source of the
light while groping for his gun under the seat.
BUTCH'S POV - WHITE LIGHT
It's bright as hell but getting clearer, less fuzzy.
We can now see it's the headlights of a huge COMBINE which
sits, ENGINE RUNNING, directly in front of the station
wagon.
(CONTINUED)

162
A BLACK MAN - 50 or so, KILLS the ENGINE (but leaves the
lights on) steps down from the combine cab and starts
toward the station wagon.
BACK TO SCENE
Phillip, now wide awake and scared.
He notices that...
Butch is fingering the gun, resting it in his hands and
under his right leg.
The Black Man, whose name is Mack, crosses the front of the
wagon and walks to the driver's side window.
MACK (BLACK MAN)
Didn't mean to scare ya'. I work at
night. It's cooler. Ya'lls car break
down?
BUTCH
Me n' the boy was just catchin' some
shut-eye in yer' field.
MACK
Oh, it ain't mine. I just works it for
Mr. Andrews. Where ya'll from?
BUTCH
Drove from Texarkana yesterday.
MACK
Quite a haul.
BUTCH
Said a mouthful there.
MACK
Well, ain't no sense in ya'll
sleepin' in the car. Not when I got a
fold out couch sittin' empty.
BUTCH
Wouldn't want to put you out.
'Sides we
need to get back on the road.
MACK
No trouble t'all. Wake you up first
light, fill yer' belly and send you on
yer' way.
163
165
Two officers, MONTGOMERY and HALL, scan the horizon.
They
look like they've driven all night.
Saunders wakes up in the back seat and leans forward.
SAUNDERS
We didn't pass it did we?
Saunders spots the RV on the horizon.
MONTGOMERY
There it is.
166
167
Hall and Montgomery view the beat to hell RV while Saunders,
ready to cry, jumps out and runs into the field.
MONTGOMERY
Good Gawd Almighty. Governor ain't
gonna' like this.
168
168
Suttle is asleep among the rubble. He jumps to when
Saunders bursts in. Saunders gasps when he sees the shape
his prize vehicle is in.
SAUNDERS
Where are they?!
SUTTLE
Uh, uh, they're gone.
SAUNDERS
How long?!
SUTTLE
I don't know, uh, four, five hours.
Saunders, dejected, starts to move some of the trash from
the couch. He sits down and moans...
SAUNDERS
Well, goddammit, did he say anything?
SUTTLE
Yeah.
(CONTINUED)
109.
168
CONTINUED:
168
SAUNDERS
What?!
SUTTLE
Well, uh, Chief Garnett wanted me to tell
you that the vehicle gets his seal of
approval....
Saunders' face begins to turn red.
SUTTLE
And that he wants his chair back.
If he was red before, now Saunders is crimson.
A ther-
mometer dropped into boiling water.
169
171
OFFICER JONES, a lean, hard-nose of 25, drives. Adler in
the front seat, Red and Sally in the back. Not a word is
spoken. Serious business.
172
172
ANOTHER OFFICER drives this car. Kaiser rides shotgun
working the radio. In the back seat sit Bobby Lee and
Bradley.
173
173
A COFFEEPOT RATTLES on the stove.
Two black hands move the pot and rescue overfried eggs in
a skillet on the stove.
Two small black
feet dangle from a too-high bathroom
toilet. As they
hit the ground we hear a FLUSH. We
FOLLOW the feet
DOWN down a short hall and into the
living room. As
they pass the bottom of a fold-out couch
we...
BOOM UP to reveal Butch and Phillip asleep. Butch's arm
has found its way under Phillip's head and is acting as
an early morning pillow.

173
CONTINUED:
173
A small head pops up on the side of the bed nearest
Phillip. The six-year-old eyes of CLEVELAND peer close
to Phillip and watch, only inches away, as Phillip sleeps.
Phillip's eyes blink a bit and then they open...
PHILLIP
(scared)
Aaaayyyyy!
CLEVE
(more scared)
Aaaayyyy!!!
Butch jumps up like a rocket and is on the floor in an
instant.
BUTCH
Aaaayyyyy!!!!
Cleve races into the kitchen and the apron strings of his
grandmother, Mack's wife, LOTTIE.
LOTTIE
He wake ya'll up?
(to Cleve)
Now I told ya not to do that.
BUTCH AND PHILLIP, breathing hard, can't help but laugh.
BUTCH
No harm, Ma'am.
LOTTIE
I'm Lottie. Mack's wife.
This here's
my grandbaby, Cleveland.
CLEVE
Name's Cleve.
I'm six.
PHILLIP
I'm eight.
Mine's Buzz.
174

Butch, Cleve and Phillip finish breakfast while Lottie
pours coffee. Cleve and Phillip, hitting it off well, are
engaged in fervent storytelling.
CLEVE
We got us a creek down the way.
Wanna go later?

PHILLIP
Sure thing.
Mack enters after a hard night's work.
BUTCH
Mornin' to ya.
MACK
Mornin'.
Rest done ya'll some good.
LOTTIE
You wanna plate?
MACK
Not jus' yet.
(to Cleve)
Boy, go get my thermos from the truck.
Cleve, still whispering and giggling with Phillip, isn't
really listening.
MACK
Don't ya hear good, boy?!
Mack firmly cuffs the boy's ear and Cleve jumps up and out
the door, one hand holding the side of his head. Butch and
Phillip both look up at Mack.
MACK
Boy don't got the sense Gawd gave a
chicken.
175

JONES
Want me to stay on Highway 70?
RED
Let's head on over towards Amarillo.
We'll cross him there or wave goodbye at
the border.
176
176
Phillip sits on
the couch and watches as Butch shows Cleve
a trick. Cleve
bends over, puts his hands between his legs
and Butch grabs
them and pulls -- a flip. Cleve is
ecstatic at the
result. Phillip and Butch laugh along.
CLEVE
Agin'!
Do it agin'!

LOTTIE
(to Butch)
Where's the boy's mother?
BUTCH
We left her at home this time.
Boy's
night out kinda thing.
Butch spots an old phonograph.
BUTCH
Say, lookie here.
He gives it a spin with his finger and searches through a
stack of 78s.
LOTTIE
Mr. Andrews give 'em to us when he got
hisself a newfangled one.
Butch finds a particular favorite.
BUTCH
Jeezus. Now this is music. You know
how long it's been since I heard this.
LOTTIE
That's an oldie all right. Mrs.
Andrews' maiden name was Bougeois --
half-Creole herself she is, but Mr.
Andrews he don't like nobody to know.
'Suppose that's why he give 'em to us.
177
177
Mack drops his pants and sits on the throne. He reaches
over and turns ON the RADIO resting on the wash basin. A
FARM REPORT comes on just as...
178
178
A NEEDLE DROPS on a 78, filling the room with the SCRATCHY
sounds of a Coonass waltz.
Butch's eyes come to life.
BUTCH
You dance, Lottie?
LOTTIE
Lawd goodness no.
(CONTINUED)
113.
178
CONTINUED:
178
BUTCH
Here, jus' follow me.
He takes her in his arms and slowly but surely adjusts her
movement to his. After a few rough turns they're not too
bad.
Phillip can't help but smile as he and Cleve watch and
giggle.
Butch and Lottie dance, swirling around the room.
LOTTIE
Mr. Poe, you sure can move.
BUTCH
Oughta be able to. Was raised in a dime
a dance whorehouse.
LOTTIE
Yer' foolin' me?
BUTCH
No, ma'am. My mama would dance their
asses out of the fryin' pan and into the
back room fire.
Butch spots Phillip and Cleve, watching, giggling.
BUTCH
Get on yer' feet, Buzz.
You'n Cleve
shake a leg.
LOTTIE
(encouraging)
Well go on!
Cleve and Phillip reluctantly stand and stare at one
another.
BUTCH
Dance, boys!
The little boys do their best to emulate the adults and
soon they're laughing and dancing, too.
The RECORD STOPS. They all clap and laugh.
Butch hears
something... The RADIO in the bathroom.

Mack sits, cleaning his fingernails with a Barlow knife as
the radio announcer begins a news flash.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Update on the manhunt for the escaped
convict. Haynes is armed and extremely
dangerous. He is believed to have a
hostage with him, an eight-year-old boy.
A finger turns OFF the RADIO. We FOLLOW the finger UP an
arm TO Butch's concerned face. He sits down on the edge of
the tub across from Mack and takes the knife away from him.
BUTCH
We'll be leavin' soon enough. I'll kill
all of you if you try anything stupid.
Mack swallows hard.
180

Lottie quizzes Phillip...
LOTTIE
What's Texarkana like? I ain't never
been there.
PHILLIP
(through his teeth)
Oh, it's real nice. I got a dog named...
Phillip and a tree house and...
Mack, nervous, enters the room followed by Butch.
BUTCH
Come on, Buzz.
Time for us to hit the
road.
LOTTIE
Whass' wrong, Mack? You look like you
seen a ghost.
Cleve runs up to Butch, turns around backwards and puts his
hands between his legs.
CLEVE
Do me agin'!
MACK
(scared for the boy)
No!
Boy! Get over by yer' Mammaw!
Lottie senses something is wrong.
Cleve, too young to
smell trouble, persists...
CLEVE
Come on, Mister, do me agin'!

Butch smiles and starts to oblige the boy, but Mack inter-
venes and smacks Cleve hard, sending him sprawling to the
floor bawling.
Butch, instantly enraged, back-hands Mack, grabs him by the
collar and tosses him onto the floor.
Phillip -- frozen, sitting, watching as things go from bad
to worse.
Cleve -- confused, bawling, afraid.
Butch pulls
the gun from his pants, bends down, picks up
Mack by his
throat, presses the gun in his mouth and lifts
him into a
chair beside Lottie. He bends close to Mack --
their noses
are inches apart.
BUTCH
Why'd ya'
wanna' go and hit Cleve for?
He didn't
move fast enough for ya', is
that it?
Or maybe he gets excited
sometimes
and don't hear everything ya'
say? You
make me sick to my stomach.
Butch spits in Mack's face, then rises and walks over to
Phillip and hands him the revolver.
BUTCH
Point it at 'em.
PHILLIP
I don't wanna'...
BUTCH
Point it!
Phillip does so, occasionally wiping a tear from his eye.
Mack reaches down and holds Lottie's hand.
Butch kneels down to a still-sobbing Cleve.
BUTCH
Now, son, you wanna' flip?
Cleve shakes his head "no" between sobs. Butch gently
takes the boy and lifts him to a standing position.
BUTCH
Go ahead. Put yer' hands between yer'
legs. I won't hurt ya'.
Cleve turns to Mack and then runs to him. Butch walks
calmly over and pulls the crying child away from the old man
and back to the center of the room.

He don't trust ya' no more. You gotta'

Put yer' hands 'tween yer' legs, son.
Cleve,
still sobbing, does so. Butch reaches down and
flips
him, all the while staring at Mack. Each time he
flips
the boy, Butch reaches down, grabs Cleve's hands and
flips
him again.
Finally he allows the frightened child to go to Mack and
Lottie.
Butch takes the gun from Phillip.
BUTCH
Buzz.
Go out to the car and get that
rope.
Phillip stands frozen.
BUTCH
Phillip!...
Phillip slowly rises and walks away.
He stops for a moment
and turns his back.
EXTREME CLOSEUP - PHILLIP
His eyes lock in a gaze with...
EXTREME CLOSEUP - CLEVE
His sobbing eyes plead for something, anything.
181
182
Butch sits on the coffee table across from Mack, Lottie and
Cleve.
BUTCH
(to Mack)
Now you hold that boy and tell him you
love him.
Mack grabs Cleve and sets him in his lap.

MACK
(scared)
I love you.
Butch cocks the revolver and slides forward.
His nose is
almost touching Mack's.
BUTCH
No, old man.
Say it like you mean it.
MACK
This boy know I loves him, mistah'.
BUTCH
Then say it.
LOTTIE
Please, mistah'. I gotta' sense about
you. I know you a good man.
BUTCH
Nome', I ain't a good man. Ain't the
worst neither, jus' a different breed.
183
184
Butch, enthralled with the episode he's directing, almost
quivers with anticipation.
BUTCH
Say it, Mack.
Don't cost nuthin'.
MACK
I love you, Cleve.
BUTCH
(serious)
Gawd that's beautiful.
Butch spots Phillip standing at the entrance to the living
room with the bag. He takes it from the boy, empties the
contents -- candy, cookies, bread, sugar and all -- and
picks up the rope, takes Mack's Barlow knife from his
pocket and cuts off a long shank. Butch takes the rope and
begins to tie up the three.
(CONTINUED)
118.
184

184
Phillip stands, stares, aware that something bad is
happening.
Butch finishes tying, sticks the knife in his pocket and
walks over to the PHONOGRAPH. He turns it back ON. The
SCRATCHY RECORD plays. He turns UP the VOLUME.
BUTCH
(to Phillip)
You can go wait in the car or you can
watch. Yer' old enough to think for
yer'self.
Phillip, unsure what to do, stands his ground.
Butch returns to his seat
on the coffee table and stares
at the three hostages. He
appears as if he's about to cry,
closes his eyes and rests
his chin on the barrel of the
revolver while he recites
instructions...
BUTCH
Shut yer' eyes, Cleve. Mack, you and
Lottie hold the boy tight. Shut yer'
eyes, too.
Phillip, awkwardly aware that he's going to witness an
execution, starts to cry out, then squelches himself.
Butch seems to be in another world now -- taken to another
place and time. A slight smile finds its way to his face,
then disappears.
LOTTIE
Please, mistah', ain't no use in it.
MACK
We'll give you ever'thing we got!
But Butch doesn't even hear the words. He slowly opens his
eyes, pulls his chin from the pistol barrel and points it
at Mack.
LOTTIE
Our Father, which are in heaven, Hallo
be thy name...
BUTCH
(to Lottie)
Shhh... shhh... shhh...

Say it wif' me....
Butch looks to Phillip in a strange way, sets the gun on
the floor between them, and crawls amongst the candy, gum
and wrappers until he finds the electrician's tape.
Phillip watches, not knowing what to do.
The revolver -- cocked, resting on the floor.
MACK, CLEVE & LOTTIE
Giv' us this day our daily bread and
forgiv' us, Lawd, our trespasses as we
forgiv' those who tresspass agin' us...
Butch rips tape from the roll and slaps a piece over each
of their mouths, silencing their prayers one by one.
Out of breath, he kneels down in front of them and stares
at the three while he reaches his hand behind him for the
.... pistol -- but it's not there...
Butch looks up to see...
Phillip -- teeth gritted, holding the pistol, pointing it
directly at Butch.
CLOSEUP - BUTCH
His expression is blank -- then a slight smile. For a
second it's as if none of this has happened, that Butch will
grasp Phillip in his arms...
A DEAFENING GUNBLAST turns his expression to blank.
Phillip, knocked to the floor by the revolver's kick,
recovers to his knees, shaking like a leaf.
The MAMBO RECORD comes to an END, but SCRATCHES ON AD
INFINITUM.
Butch falls back to his knees, still staring at Phillip.
He looks at his stomach, where a stain of brown-red
gushes through his T-shirt, and back to the boy.
BUTCH
(as if he hasn't
seen him in years)
Phillip?....

Phillip, momentarily dazed, stares at the gun in his hand,
at Butch, the blood pouring from Butch's side, and the
shocked faces of Mack and his family. Then, in a flash, he
runs, pell-mell, out of the house.
185
186
Butch gropes to his feet, still in shock. He stumbles
toward the door, then stops, reaches in his pocket,
extracts Mack's Barlow knife, holds it up and walks toward
them, staring hard.
Mack, Cleve, Lottie -- Afraid they'll be killed after all.
Butch, surprisingly, meekly sets the knife down on the
coffee table...
BUTCH
Thanks for yer' hospitality.
And walks away.

ARCH ANDREWS, 50, the owner of the Ranch, slows down when
he sees...
ARCH
What the hell?...
HIS POV - PHILLIP
clad in his white costume, running across a field toward
a grove of trees beside the creek.
BACK TO SCENE
Arch continues on down the road and passes...
Butch -- nearly in shock, stumbling down the road.
TRUCK
pulls into Mack's place, and Arch gets out, peers into the
station wagon, sees blood, grimaces and walks up to the
house. He notices a dripping trail of blood on the porch.

Arch enters the kitchen, sees no one and starts toward the
living room. The MAMBO continues to SCRATCH.
ARCH
Mack?... Lottie?...
Arch enters the living room and stops when he sees Mack and
family, still gagged and tied to the chairs.

Adler listens in on the shortwave.
KAISER (V.O.)
A town called Happy, over in Swisher
County.
RED
(to Jones)
How far?
JONES
Half-hour tops.
RED
(to Adler)
Get on the radio and tell whoever gets
there first to play it nice and easy.
Sally gives him a look.
KAISER (V.O.)
They've got the boy's mother flyin' in
on a private. You want her on standby?

RED
Jeezus, who did that?
ADLER
Guvner, I assume.
SALLY
Not a bad idea.
RED
Go ahead and chopper her in.
After a moment of silence, Sally turns to Red.
SALLY
I didn't mean to pry last night.
RED
Yes, ya did.
SALLY
Look, Red, it was 20 years ago.
RED
Funny thing. When the judge sent him
away the kid stared at me. Like he knew.
Not hard or mad like you'd expect. It
was... It was like he was forgiving me.
SALLY
Forgiving you for what?! For looking
at the facts and doing what you
thought was right?
RED
Naw.
For what's gonna happen today.

A country cop answering the report, drives slowly down the
road, his pistol drawn and held upright in one hand. He
pulls into Mack's driveway and parks. Arch walks out of
the house to greet him.
ARCH
That's his car. Took off on foot. He's
got a pistol. Mack says it looks like a
.38.

Sally watches Red. When the car comes to a stop, she
reaches out and touches his arm.
SALLY
I think our chances of this thing ending
peacefully are good.
He smiles a lonesome smile, opens the door and exits.
