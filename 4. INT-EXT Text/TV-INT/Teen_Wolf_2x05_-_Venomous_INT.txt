      Lying on a weightlifting bench, Jackson stares up with steel-
      eyed focus. He grips a bar with two plates on each side and 
      lifts it off the rack. Tendons in his neck stretched taut, he 
      pushes out three reps.

                                    JACKSON
                    More.

      Another two plates go on the bar with a heavy CLUNK.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    More.

      A reluctant pause. Two more plates slide on. Jackson takes a 
      breath and pushes up. Only two reps this time. HANDS dart in 
      to grasp the bar. His spotter, Danny, guides the weight back 
      onto the rack.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                      I said--don t help me.

                                  DANNY
                    Don t help you as in don t spot 
                    you? Or don t help you as in let 
                    the bar crush your throat?

      Jackson glares at the reddened palms of his hands.

                                    JACKSON
                    I should be able to do twice that.

                                  DANNY
                    On the surface of the moon, maybe.

      Removing the two extra plates, Danny turns to go.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    I m hitting the shower. If I come 
                    back and you re lying dead under a 
                    pile of weight, I m taking the 
                    Porsche.

      As Danny steps away, Jackson lies back on the bench.                       TEEN WOLF "Episode 205" BLUE12/24/112.

      When he grips the bar again, something odd happens... SOUNDS 
      drift toward him, rising into pristine focus.

      A DROP of water. The WHIR of a FAN. Something METALLIC 
      JANGLES. And then the ROAR of the SHOWER causes him to 
      flinch. 

      Jackson shakes his head and the sounds quiet to a whisper. He *
      returns his attention to the bar.

      He pumps out a rep. The second hits his chest, slowing on the 
      return up. Eyes squeezed shut with effort, he does not see--

      A FEMALE HAND slip under the bar and guide it back onto the *
      rack as if it weighed nothing. Bracelets on the wrist JANGLE 
      SOFTLY, the same noise Jackson heard a moment ago.

                                    JACKSON
                    Thanks.

      Erica leans over the bar.

                                  ERICA
                    Any time.

      Jackson blinks, barely having a moment to react, when Erica s 
      hand STRIKES down to grab him.


      Jackson TUMBLES across the floor of the station. As he rolls 
      to a stop, Isaac drags him to his feet to face Derek.

                                  DEREK
                    What happened to you on the night 
                    of the full moon?

                                    JACKSON
                    What? Nothing. Nothing happened.

                                  DEREK
                    You re lying.

      Derek begins slipping on a pair of BLACK GLOVES.

                                    JACKSON
                    Woah, wait a second. I can prove 
                    it. I taped myself.

                    Yes. It was the full moon. And 
                    maybe while you were curled up in a 
                    corner having an existential crisis 
                    about turning into a monster, I was 
                    preparing for the so-called  gift  
                    your big, bad Alpha promised me. 
                    And what did I get? Nothing. You 
                    want proof? Let me get the video.

                                  DEREK
                    I ve got a better idea.

      With gloved hands, Derek holds up a SHARD OF MIRRORED GLASS. 
      The same broken glass in which the Kanima saw its reflection 
      by the swimming pool.

                                    JACKSON
                          (nervous)
                    What is that?

      Derek tilts the shard, letting a drop of CLEAR, VISCOUS 
      LIQUID slide menacingly across it.

                                  DEREK
                    You know, Jackson, you ve always 
                    been kind of a snake.

      Isaac grabs Jackson, pinning his arms behind him as Erica 
      yanks his head back, forcing his mouth open.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    And everyone knows a snake can t be 
                    poisoned by its own venom.

      A DROP slides down the glass, clinging to the edge. Derek 
      tilts the glass and let s the venom DRIP RIGHT INTO JACKSON S 
      MOUTH.

      Erica shoves his jaw closed as he struggles and writhes 
      against Isaac. Until finally, they let him go, retreating to 
      Derek s side.

      Jackson staggers back, spitting and wiping at his mouth. Then 
      glares up at them with a mixture of fear and hatred.

      The three wolves tense, preparing for the worst. But Jackson 
      simply blinks, swaying to the side as if dizzy. And then--

      He falls. Knees buckling, he crumbles to the floor. 

      His body stiffens, muscles paralyzing, until all he can do is 
      lie there, staring up with wide, terrified eyes.                       TEEN WOLF "Episode 205" BLUE12/24/114.

      Derek s disappointed face comes into view.

                    You re still a snake, Jackson. Just 
                    not the one we re looking for.

      As Derek walks away, Isaac takes his place, kneeling down.

                                  ISAAC
                    But you re going to do one more 
                    thing for us. Actually... for me.


      Jackson sits across from Sheriff Stilinski who appears to be 
      trying to keep himself from exploding in anger.

                                  STILINSKI
                    So now you re saying you didn t see 
                    Isaac arguing with his father 
                    before the murder?

                                    JACKSON
                    Not... exactly.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Not exactly or no? Because when it 
                    comes to the law there s a pretty 
                    large divide between not exactly 
                    and no. If not exactly were sitting 
                    in this chair, no would be 
                    somewhere in the middle of the 
                    Pacific Ocean. Drowning. Along with 
                    my career. So which is it? Not 
                    exactly or no?

                    No?

      Stilinski slumps back down in his chair.

      He nods to the back of the room where Isaac now sits. Back in 
      school. A slight but sinister smile at his lips.

      Hurrying down the corridor for their next class, Stiles 
      whispers to Scott.

                                  STILES
                    I only found one thing online 
                    called the Kanima. A werejaguar *
                    from South America that goes after 
                      murderers.

                    But you did see it kill someone. 
                    Which is probably why it tried to 
                    kill you. And probably still wants 
                    to kill you. And probably won t 
                    stop until you re dead.

      Jackson winces at each CLANG of METAL while talking to Danny.

      As Danny steps away, the sound of METALLIC CLICKING catches 
      Jackson s attention.

      Ahead, he notices students stepping aside, getting out of the 
      way of two oddly intimidating teenagers--Erica and Isaac.

      Jackson spots Erica s bracelets, the metallic clicking he 
      keeps hearing. When she and Isaac pause at a locker, their 
      WHISPERS hit Jackson like tiny pinpricks. Wincing with each 
      word, he s able to catch only phrases here and there.

      Dropping into a seat right behind Scott and Stiles for the 
      beginning of class, Jackson leans forward.

                    I m aware of that. But I swear, 
                    it s not her. It can t be. Lydia s 
                    fine.

      Sitting quietly at her seat in the back, Lydia certainly 
      appears fine. However, when she glances up from her notes--

      The student writing at the board is no longer a student. It s 
      a MAN IN A LONG, BLACK LEATHER COAT.

      Unnerved, Lydia leans sideways to see the man s face. The 
      moment she s about to catch a glimpse, however, he takes a 
      step to the right, remaining concealed. 

      He continues writing, pressing the chalk to the board with 
      rapid and violent strokes, covering it in STRANGE EQUATIONS 
      that connect by ARROWS and curve around to form--

      A SPIRAL.

      But even more disturbing is that EVERY STUDENT in class now 
      has their head turned toward Lydia. All of them staring 
      blankly RIGHT AT HER.

      The Man stops writing. Chalk hovering at the board. His hand 
      drifts down to his side and he slowly turns to face Lydia, 
      revealing his identity.

      PETER HALE.

      Handsome and burn-free, he stares at her with curiosity. 
      Oddly, it s now just the two of them, Lydia and Peter, in an 
      empty classroom.

      He starts walking, STRIDING toward her. Then grabs a desk and 
      tosses it out of his way. It flips up, SMASHING against the 
      wall. Another desk goes FLYING.

      Lydia scrambles out of her chair, retreating against the wall 
      as Peter closes in. He CRUSHES SOMETHING in his fist and then  
      stops.

      Opening his fingers, Peter reveals a handful of CHALK DUST. 
      He blows the powder into Lydia s eyes turning her world a 
      BLINDING WHITE.

      watching her.                       TEEN WOLF "Episode 205" BLUE12/24/119.

                    Okay then. Anyone else want to try 
                      answering? In English?

      Lydia turns back to the board where she s written one strange 
      word over and over... EMPLEHENOEMOS

                                  SCOTT*

                    What is that? Greek?

                                  STILES
                      Actually... it is English.*

      Stiles has used his phone to take a picture of the word. With 
      the touch of a button he flips the photo horizontally to 
      reveal the MESSAGE Lydia has written over and over on the 
      board...

      FADE IN:


      Scott and Stiles rush in for the beginning of Chemistry Labs.

                                  SCOTT
                            (whispering)
                    Derek wouldn t kill her without 
                    proof.

                                  STILES
                    So then he tests her like Jackson, 
                    right? But when and where?

                                  SCOTT
                          (looking past him)
                    I think here and now.

      Scott eyes the door where Isaac and Erica enter. Seeming 
      almost to glide in, they catch everyone s attention. Even Mr. 
      Harris glances up from his desk. 

      The only one who doesn t seem to notice is Lydia. As she 
      settles in her seat--

      Scott and Stiles swoop in, dragging their chairs over to sit 
      on either side of her like bodyguards. Lydia throws a curious 
      glance at the two of them.

      Nearby, Allison eyes Scott with a questioning look. He gives *
      a quick shake of his head, unable to explain.

      Harris shuts the door and turns to address the class.

                                  HARRIS
                    Einstein once said  Two things are 
                    infinite: the universe and human 
                      stupidity. And I m not sure about 
                    the universe.  I myself have 
                      encountered infinite stupidity...

      He pauses at Stiles s desk for a not-so-subtle punctuation.

                                  HARRIS (CONT D)
                    So to combat the plague of 
                    ignorance in my class, you re going 
                    to combine efforts through a round 
                    of group experiments. Let s see if 
                    two heads are indeed better than 
                    one.

                    Or in Mr. Stilinski s case, less 
                    than one. Erica, take the first 
                    station. You ll start with...

      Every male hand in the class SHOOTS UP.*

                                  HARRIS (CONT D)
                    I didn t ask for volunteers. Put 
                    your hormonal little hands down.

      The hands drift down with disappointed grumbles as Harris 
      aims a pen at Scott.

                                  HARRIS (CONT D)
                    Start with Mr. McCall.

      A nervous Allison watches Erica smile, pleased at the 
      pairing.

                                  HARRIS (CONT D)
                    All right. Next two...

      MOMENTS LATER, the clinking of glass vials and clatter of 
      metallic instruments fill the room as the students complete 
      various steps of each experiment.

      Scott whispers to Erica by his side.

                                  SCOTT
                    Whatever you re thinking of doing, 
                    wait. Give me a chance to talk to 
                    Derek.

                                  ERICA
                    Why don t you talk to me instead?

      She moves closer, breathing him in. Scott flinches back as 
      she catches a familiar scent.

                                  ERICA (CONT D)
                    That s funny. In school you guys 
                    act like you re broken up. But 
                    she s all over you.

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about.

                                  ERICA
                    If I were Allison, I d be wanting 
                      you--wanting it--all of the time.

      She moves her hand to his thigh, fingers inching up and up.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 205" BLUE12/24/1112.

      AT ANOTHER LAB STATION - Lydia turns to Allison.

                                  LYDIA
                    Never? You never get jealous?

                                    ALLISON
                    Why would I?

                                  LYDIA
                    Because that thing happening over 
                    there?

      She points to Erica s hand slowly rising up Scott s thigh 
      underneath the table.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    That requires some jealousy.*

      Allison watches the display briefly. Only when she looks away *
      does Scott swat Erica s hand off his leg.

                                  SCOTT
                    You re not my type.

                                  ERICA
                    I m exactly your type.*

      Her eyes flare YELLOW for a brief second. Scott opens his 
      mouth to respond, but--

      Harris hits a BELL on his desk.

                                  HARRIS
                    Switch.

      The students split up, rotating to new lab stations. But *
      Allison stays by Lydia s side, whispering to her.

                                    ALLISON
                    Listen to me, okay? Don t talk to 
                    Erica or Isaac.

                                  LYDIA
                    Why?

                                    ALLISON
                    Just don t. Trust me, all right?

                                  HARRIS
                    Girls, let s go. Next station.

      Allison reluctantly steps away from Lydia while Stiles 
      notices just how alone she looks in the middle of the room.                     TEEN WOLF "Episode 205" BLUE12/24/1113.

        CONTINUED:77

      Until she turns and finds herself standing at the next 
      station with Scott.

      Stiles breathes in relief and returns to his own experiment. *
      With Isaac. As the taller boy hands him the compounds to mix, 
      Stiles whispers a quiet threat.

                                  STILES
                    If you harm one perfect, strawberry-
                    blonde hair on her head, I m going 
                    to turn your little werewolf ass 
                    into a fur coat and give it to her 
                    as a birthday present.

                                  ISAAC
                    Really? Because I ve never actually 
                    been to her big invite-only 
                    birthday party. I did ask her out 
                    once, though.

                                  STILES
                    This sounds like the beginning of a 
                    heartfelt story. I ll pass, thanks. 

                                  ISAAC
                    It was first day of freshman year--*

                                    STILES*
                    And you thought everything was *
                    going to be different in high *
                    school. But she said no.*

                                  ISAAC*
                    That s right. She even laughed and *
                    told me to try again when the bike 
                    I rode to school had an engine, not 
                    a chain.

                                  STILES
                      Unrequited love s a bitch. Maybe *
                    you should write about it in 
                    English. Channel that negative 
                    energy.

                                  ISAAC
                    I was thinking I d channel it into 
                    killing her.
                          (looking Stiles in the eye)
                    I m not very good at writing.

      Stiles and Scott watch Isaac take his place next to Lydia. 
      Neither of them knowing what to do. Stiles starts forward but 
      A WOOD POINTER SMACKS down on the table.

                                  HARRIS (CONT D)
                    If you want to test my patience, 
                    Mr. Stilinski, I guarantee it will 
                    be a failing grade.

      While Stiles backs off, at the station behind them, Allison 
      turns to Erica.*

                                    ALLISON
                    What are you going to do to her?

                                  ERICA
                    Don t you think the better question 
                    is: What s she going to do to us?

      Catching their whispers, Scott glances back at Allison. Erica 
      notices the looks between them.

                                  ERICA (CONT D)
                    I have to say, you guys are cute *
                    together. But you know, I ve always 
                    had this feeling like I m a little 
                    psychic. And I just don t think 
                    you re going to last.

                                    ALLISON
                    You think you can hurt me by 
                    sliding your hand up his thigh?

                                  ERICA
                    Would you like it better if it were 
                    your thigh?

      Erica s CLAWED FINGERS glide across Allison s leg, pressing 
      into her jeans and causing her to wince. Allison grabs her 
      wrist, but Erica s claws go deeper, PUNCTURING the fabric.

                                  ERICA (CONT D)
                    Let s do it. Girl fight in Labs. 
                    It ll be hot.

      But just as Allison s grip tightens, Harris hits the BELL.

                                  HARRIS
                    Time. If you catalyzed the reaction 
                    correctly you should now be looking

        CONTINUED:77

      Stiles and Scott gaze down at a pathetic molten glob of 
      chemical detritus bearing no resemblance to a crystal.*

      At the same time, Isaac watches Lydia raise a beautifully *
      formed CLUSTER OF CRYSTALS between her fingers.

                                  HARRIS (CONT D)
                    Now, the part of this last 
                      experiment I m sure you ll all 
                    enjoy. You can eat it.

      While other students bite into the sugary experiment, Isaac 
      allows himself a smile of anticipation as Lydia slowly brings *
      the CRYSTAL to her lips.

      Scott s amplified vision kicks in, eyes focusing on the 
      crystal between Lydia s fingertips. He spots a tiny CLEAR 
      DROP OF LIQUID glistening on the edge. Venom from the Kanima.

      Scott stands, knocking his chair to the floor.

                                  SCOTT
                    Lydia--

      But he s too late. Lydia swallows the crystal.

                                  LYDIA
                    What?

      Realizing his shout has turned every head, Scott backs down.

                                  SCOTT
                    Um... Nothing.

      Which is exactly the problem. Isaac and Erica watch Lydia 
      closely, waiting patiently as nothing happens to her. *

      A defeated Stiles slowly sinks into his seat while Scott 
      notices Isaac give a nod toward the window. Following his 
      look, Scott sees--

      Derek. Standing outside. Watching from a distance and 
      receiving the confirmation he s been waiting for.

      Lydia is the Kanima.

      Slipping inside Coach s dimly lit office, Scott flips the 
      lock on the door and turns to Stiles and Allison.

                    Derek s outside. Waiting for her.

                    You mean waiting to kill her?

                    It doesn t matter. Derek thinks 
                    it s her. So either we convince him *
                    he s wrong or we figure out how to

                    What about after school?

      Scott gives a nod, the implication clear: after school Lydia *

                    There could be something in the

                    I could talk to Derek. Maybe *
                    convince him to give us a chance to *
                    prove it s not her.

      He and Allison look to Stiles who reluctantly nods.*

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    All right. But if anything happens *
                    you guys let me handle it.*

                                    ALLISON
                    What does that mean?

                                  SCOTT
                    It means you can t heal like I do. 
                    I don t want you getting hurt.

      Allison puts her bag on Coach s desk and unzips it. She pulls 
      out a black item with a pistol grip on it. With a snap of her 
      wrist, the sides fly out and lock into place to reveal a 
      collapsible and quite deadly CROSSBOW.

                                    ALLISON
                    I can protect myself.

      Brandishing it in her hands for the two wide-eyed boys, she 
      sets the crossbow down. But Scott still doesn t look 
      convinced.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    What? Did something else happen?

      Scott struggles in silence, both friends watching him.

                    I just don t want anyone getting

      He turns for the door, but hears an odd SNAPPING SOUND. He 
      spins back, hand whipping up just in time to catch a CROSSBOW 
      DART.

      Stiles lowers the crossbow with a guilty smile on his face.

      The abstract black shapes of a RORSCHACH INKBLOT come into 
      focus. Ms. Morrell holds up the card in front of Lydia. The 
      shape on it looks peculiarly like a WOLF.

      Morrell holds up the next card. This one looks almost exactly 
      like a wolf.

                      Butterfly. Butterfly. Butterfly.

      Morrell lifts up one last card. She flips it over to reveal - 
      Peter Hale s BURNED FACE.

                                  MS. MORRELL
                    Lydia?

      Breath momentarily caught, Lydia blinks and looks to Morrell.

      Morrell lays the cards down, seeing that she isn t getting 
      anywhere.

      They stare at each other. A stand still. Morrell turns the 
      last Rorschach over in her hand.

                                  MS. MORRELL
                    Huh. I would have said wolf.

      FADE IN:


      Lifting the torn lacrosse pads to the light to get a better 
      look, Scott barely listens to Coach lecturing him.

                                  COACH
                    You know there are certain 
                      responsibilities to being a captain 
                    of the lacrosse team.

                                  SCOTT
                      Co-Captain.

                                  COACH
                    Okay, partial responsibilities.

                                  SCOTT
                    Where did you find these?

                                  COACH
                    Under the bleachers. Somebody has 
                    to pay for them, you know.

      Scott examines the lining of the shredded pads. When he 
      presses the torn fabric together, the two halves of the tag 
      form the owner s last name: MAHEALANI.

                                  SCOTT
                    They re Danny s.

                                  COACH
                    Great. Mystery solved. So either 
                    you tell Danny to take care of his 
                    equipment or I m going to make you 
                    take care of his equipment. You 
                    really want to be taking care of 
                    Danny s equipment all the time?

                                  SCOTT
                    That depends. Are we still talking 
                    about lacrosse pads?

                                  COACH
                    Get out of my face, McCall.


      And SLAMS shut. Stiles locks it. Then flips the deadbolt. *
      Then latches the chain. He turns to a suspicious Lydia.

                                  STILES
                    There s been a few break-ins around *
                    the neighborhood.

      Clutching their bookbags they all stare at the door. Then 
      Stiles wedges a dining room chair underneath the knob. Lydia 
      looks at him in disbelief.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    And a murder. It was bad.

      As he retreats from the door, Allison gives Jackson a nod to 
      the stairs.

                                    JACKSON
                    Lydia, follow me. I need to talk to 
                    you for a minute.*

                          (under her breath)
                      Seriously, what is going on with 
                    everyone?

      While she follows Jackson up the stairs to the second floor--*                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 205" BLUE12/24/1131.



      Scott fights the student traffic hurrying to the exits at the 
      end of the school day. Carrying Danny s pads, he passes right *
      by Matt.*

                                  MATT
                    Hey, McCall!

      Scott spins back as Matt SNAPS a picture of him.

                                  MATT (CONT D)
                    Thanks!

      He smiles and waves at a confused Scott. Then peers down at *
      the camera s LCD, gazing with curiosity at the photo of *
      Scott, face obscured by TWO YELLOW BURSTS OF LIGHT just over *
      his eyes.


      Jackson closes the door of Scott s room. While Lydia waits *
      for him, his eyes squeeze shut, hand reaching up to his *
      temple as if a migraine were hitting him.

                                  LYDIA
                    You okay?

      Jackson nods, turning to face her.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    So...

                                    JACKSON
                    So. You never gave me back my key.

                                  LYDIA
                    What? Your key? That s what you *
                    wanted to talk about?

                                    JACKSON
                    Why didn t you give it back?

                                  LYDIA
                    Not.

      Jackson s head cocks to the side. The sound of Lydia s *
      heartbeat hits his ear as his eyes focus on the tiny bit of *
      nervous PERSPIRATION at her temple.

                                    JACKSON
                    You just lied to me.


      Alone in the library, Danny glances to the screen where the *
      video of Jackson continues rendering. A message underneath *
      the window reads: RESTORING DATA 60%...*

      He looks up when Scott drops his pads on the table. Confused, *
      Danny examines the numerous tears.*

                                  DANNY
                    Dude. What d you do to my pads?

                    I was in goal, remember? Different

                                  SCOTT
                    Then who was wearing these?

      says: STILES. But when he answers--                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 205" BLUE12/24/1133.

      Stepping away, Scott covers the phone with his hand.*

                    What s wrong?


      Back to the wall beside the living room window, Allison grips *
      Stiles s phone in one hand, crossbow in the other.*

      On the other side of the window, Stiles peers out to the 
      street outside where--

      FOUR SILHOUETTED FIGURES stand. Derek and his pack.

      lacrosse pads--never notices what transpires on his COMPUTER *
      SCREEN.*

      IN THE RESTORED VIDEO - Jackson slowly sits straight up in *
      bed, almost as if pulled by an unseen string. With a robotic 
      stiffness, he swivels his head to face the camera, revealing 
      a blank but distinctly ominous stare.

      Ominous because his eyes are now GLOWING.

      Sun almost set, Allison and Stiles throw cautious glances at *
      Derek and his pack outside the window. With the hand not *
      holding the crossbow, Allison pulls out her phone.*

                                  STILES

                    They re here to kill Lydia.

      Breath tightening with anxiety, Stiles looks at the phone in 
      Allison s hand. Neither of them knowing what to do.


      Jackson calmly approaches Lydia, closing in on her.*

      Lydia carefully unclasps the necklace and silently sets the 
      key in the palm of his hand.

      Gazing down on it, his lips part to speak, but he has no 
      response. When he peers up, he notices her eyes are *
      glistening as she tries to hold back tears.

      In a rare moment of empathy, Jackson brings his hand up to 
      touch her cheek.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Don t.

      But he does. And her face seems to drift into his hand, 
      toward his touch. His thumb pushes away the tear at her eye, 
      moving down her soft cheek, bringing her face closer, and *
      then finally, bringing her lips to his.

      They kiss. 

      Softly at first. Then with more and more urgency. They pull 
      each other closer, bodies drawn together as Jackson presses 
      her against the wall.

      Lydia s hands reach to his back, fingers digging into his 
      shirt, pulling the fabric down to reveal--

      THE NAPE of Jackson s neck where something strange begins 
      happening to the skin. It ripples up, darkening, flesh 
      seeming to harden, surface becoming reflective.

      Isaac grabs Stiles, lifting him off his feet and--TOSSING HIM *
      clear across the room.

      Allison raises the crossbow to shoot. But Isaac moves too *
      fast, knocking the weapon up so that the dart FIRES *
      harmlessly into the ceiling.*

      Grabbing a handful of her coat, he lifts Allison up and sends 
      her flying. As she SMACKS painfully to the wood floor--                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 205" BLUE12/24/1137.

      doesn t see his hands come up to his head, mouth opening in a 
      silent cry of agony as--

      THE TRANSFORMATION takes hold.*


      Lydia steps into the hallway. Behind her, in Scott s room, 
      Jackson pitches forward and drops to all fours. *

      Unaware, Lydia moves down the hall, inching toward the *
      stairs. A CRASH comes from below, stopping her.

                                  LYDIA
                    Allison? Stiles? What s happening?

        A breathless Allison appears at the stairs.

                                    ALLISON
                    Get back! Someone s trying to break 
                    in. Go!


      Lydia rushes back into the room and slams the door shut. When 
      she spins around, Jackson is no longer there. The window lies 
      open.

                                  LYDIA
                    Jackson?


      Pushing open the door, Lydia peers into the empty bathroom. 
      Another CRASH from downstairs startles her into a SCREAM. *

      She yanks the bathroom door closed and locks it while pulling *
      her phone out of her pocket. She quickly dials 911.

                                  LYDIA
                          (into the phone)
                    Yes, I--I need the police.                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 205" BLUE12/24/1138.



      Allison backs into Scott s room and kicks the door shut. 
      Hands shaky, she nocks another dart into the crossbow. Then 
      glances to the empty bedroom, the closed bathroom door and--

      THE WINDOW, where a CLEAR, VISCOUS LIQUID drips from the claw-
      marked open sill.

                                  ALLISON*
                    It s here... Stiles, it s here!*


      Pressed into a corner of the bathroom, a terrified Lydia 
      grips her phone in both hands. She listens, waiting for a 
      sound. Waiting for--


      Scott s bedroom door CRASHES inward. YELLOW EYES emerge from 
      the darkened hallway. Erica steps in to face Allison aiming *
      the crossbow.

                                  ERICA*
                    This might make me sound like kind 
                    of a bitch, but I ve always 
                    wondered what it feels like to 
                    steal someone s boyfriend.

      She steps forward. Allison s finger tenses over the trigger.*

                                  ERICA (CONT D)
                    I bet it s a pretty sick rush of 
                    power. I think I m going to try it *
                    with Scott. And you know what? I 
                    don t think it s going to be that 
                    hard. Because why would he be 
                    waiting around to steal ten minutes 
                    with you when he could have me any 
                    time he wants? Any time. All of the *
                    time.

      Lips pressed tight, Allison doesn t respond. Instead, she 
      pulls the trigger. THE CROSSBOW FIRES. 

      Erica whips back as if slapped. But then she slowly turns 
      back to reveal the DART gripped in her hand.

                                  ERICA (CONT D)
                    You didn t really think that would 
                    work, did you?                    TEEN WOLF "Episode 205" BLUE12/24/1139.

                                    ALLISON
                    Actually, yeah.

      Confused, Erica lowers the dart and opens her hand to see the *
      Kanima s VENOM covering the shaft. Venom which now sticks to *
      the fingers of her hand.

      The dart slowly falls to the floor. 

      With a look of pure hate, Erica uses the last bit of strength 
      she has to charge toward Allison. But with only her first 
      step, she goes down--

      Collapsing to the floor with a CRY OF ANGER, the paralysis 
      begins to take hold. As she struggles to move, Allison *
      casually kneels down to look her in the eye.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    I thought you were psychic. Bitch.
