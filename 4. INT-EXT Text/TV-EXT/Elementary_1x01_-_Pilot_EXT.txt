  LOW ANGLE -- as TWO SNEAKEREDFEET pound the concrete of this  
  GothamSIDEWALK.  FIND JOAN, ear-buds IN, pushing herself HARD 
  as she jogs.   

  SERIES OF SHOTS: Joan, SPLASHING through a puddle as a SHOPKEEP
  hoses down the sidewalk in front of his Midtown bodega... Joan, 
    accelerating past OTHER JOGGERS as she rounds the Jackie O
  reservoir in CENTRAL PARK... Joan, CHURNING down this lush 
  section of the HUDSON RIVER GREENWAY, her stride as strong and 
  deliberate as the current of the river itself...

  ...and finally: Joan, stopped by a  DETOUR  sign on a HARLEM 
  SIDEWALK under construction.  Jogging in place, she checks her 
  watch, tries to figure out if she should turn back or carry on.  
  Then, as she seems to settle on a plan and makes a sharp left 
  OUT OF FRAME...

                                                                            CUT TO:


  CLOSE ON A WEATHERED SIGN that reads  CARVER CEMETERY.   PULL 
  BACK to find a solemn Joanstanding just beyond the FENCE that 
  lines this small, urban graveyard, her eyes LOCKED on a 
  headstone that bears the name  Charles Azzarello.   The name 
  obviously means something to Joan, who YANKS OUT her ear-buds, 
  bringing the music to an abrupt HALT.  And as she finally TURNS 
  and GOES... 

                                                                            CUT TO:


  Joan returns from her jog to find TY MORSTANsitting on her 
  stoop.  Ty is 29, an old friend of Joan s, and -- as we ll learn 
  in time -- a rising star in the New York District Attorney s 
  Office.  And as he holds up his watch...

                                  TY
                    8:47.  You re usually back from 
                    your jog by 8:30.  You start late 
                    today or did you run too far?                                                                                                  3

                    Took a little detour.

                    What reyou doing here?  Aren t you 
                    supposed to be at the D.A. s,

                    Your folks called, said they were 
                    having a tough time getting a hold 
                    of you.  And since I m not due in 
                    court until 10 today, I told them 
                    I d make sure you were okay.  

                                  JOAN
                    And you re doing it in person

                    I was in the neighborhood.  Thought  
                    I d stop by. 

                                  JOAN
                    I m fine.

  And as she steps PAST HIM, stabs her key into her lock --

                                  TY
                    Work s good?

                          (yeah...)
                    I m starting with a new client 
                    today.  Picking him up from Hemdale
                    in 20 minutes.  So if you ll excuse 
                    me --

                                  TY
                    You safe with him?

  Joan s annoyed, but forces a smile as she turns back to him.  
  And as Ty gives a small smile of his own -- 

                                  TY (CONT D)

                    N.A. prayer.  But I bet you already 
                    knew that. 

  She did.  

                                  JOAN
                    You and my parents.  You think what 
                    I do is penance, but it s not.  I 
                    likemy job, okay?  I m good at it.  
                    And regardless of what you or they 
                    want to believe, I ve got 
                    everythingunder control. 

  But no sooner has she pulled open the door to her building than 
  her cell phone RINGS, its display identifying the caller as 
     HemdaleRehabilitation Facility.   And as she ANSWERS:

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    Hello?

                    escaped?

  ON JOAN, we PRELAPthe  BEEP  of an answering machine, and we --

  Joan, dressed for the day now, PHONE to her ear, slams her car 
  door SHUT as she approaches a particular BROWNSTONE and leaves a 
  message:

                                  JOAN
                    Hi, it s Joan Watson.  On the off 
                    chance you haven t already been 
                    contacted by Hemdale... your 
                    brother left rehab a little early 
                    this morning.  I m already at his 
                    house to see if he s here --

  She STOPS SHORT at the sight of a WOMAN S BARE BACK through one 
  of the brownstone s first floor windows.  And as we SEE that 
  nearly every square inch of the woman s flesh is TATTOOED, and 
  the woman pulls on a SHIRT... 

  RESUME JOAN --  This can t be good.  

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    I ll call you if there s a problem.

  NEW ANGLE -- as Joan hangs up and makes her way up the front 
  stairs.  The tattooed woman is just EXITING.                                                                                                  5

  She s undeniably beautiful, but she s also a jigsaw of tattoos 
  and piercings.And as we note the SHEEN OF PERSPIRATION on her 
  face and arms...

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    Excuse me, I m trying to find Mr. --

  But the woman SAYS NOTHING; just moves past her.  STAY WITH a 
  concerned Joan as she finally continues into --


  And as we SAIL over the bridge s familiar spires, the speed of 
  the cars below telling us that rush hour has passed...

                                  SHERLOCK (O.C.)
                    Prior to my stint in  junkie jail,  
                    I worked as a consultant at 
                    Scotland Yard.


  Moments later.  Joan trails Sherlock as he approaches a small 
  clutch of PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES and UNIFORMED POLICEMEN 
  huddled in front of this multi-million dollar residence. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Tell me.  How do clients typically 
                    introduce you?

                                  JOAN
                    What do you mean?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I mean I find it hard to believe 
                    they d actually tellpeople they d 
                    been assigned a glorified  helper-
                    monkey  in the wake of their 
                    rehabilitation.

                                  JOAN
                          (to herself)
                     Helper monkey.   That s a new one.
                            (toSherlock)
                    You and I have what s known as 
                       companion/client confidentiality,  
                    Mr. Holmes.  That means you can 
                    introduce me to people however 
                    you d like -- friend, relative, co-
                    worker -- and I ll play along.  But 
                    the truth is, most clients just 
                    call me their companion. 

  Sherlock mulls that.  Interesting.  Then CALLS OUT --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Captain Gregson?

  New ANGLE -- as CAPTAIN TOBIAS  TOBY  GREGSON turns his head.  
  Gregson is early 50s, a cop s cop, manicured but Naugahyde-
  tough.And as he peels away from the other cops --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Ms. Watson, meet Captain Gregson.  
                    Captain Gregson, meet Ms. Watson, 
                    my... personal valet. 

  Joan clearly doesn t love that handle, but forces a smile.

                                  GREGSON
                          (to Sherlock)
                    She waits out here.                                                                                                14

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I m afraid she s quite crucial to 
                    my process, Captain. 

                                  JOAN
                    It s okay.  Really.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Actually, it isn t.  At least not 
                    according to my brother s e-mail.
                          (then; off her confusion)
                    He explained it s the job of a 
                    proper  valet  to accompany his or 
                    her charge to his place of 
                    business.  Well, consider thismy 
                    place of business.  Consider the 
                    coroner s officemy place of 
                    business.  Consider every wretched 
                    hive of depravity and murder in 
                    this citymy place of business.
                          (then)
                    Unless, of course, you don t think 
                    you have the stomach for the work I 
                    do.  In which case you should 
                    probably tell my brother that a man 
                    like me shouldn t havea  valet.  

  ON JOAN -- getting it now.  Not the least bit intimidated. 

                                  JOAN
                    I m good. 

                                  GREGSON
                          (to Sherlock)
                    You know I m going out on a limb 
                    just letting youinto this scene, 
                    don t you? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    If by  going out on a limb  you 
                    mean  virtually guaranteeing a 
                    successful outcome,  then yes.

  A beat, and then Gregson relents, TURNS to lead them into the 
  house.  Holmes, pleased with himself, pulls on a pair of LATEX 
  GLOVES as he and Joan follow into --


  It s MOMENTS LATER and Holmes is typing on his phone as he and 
  Watson emerge onto a sidewalk that BUSTLES with downtown foot 
  traffic.   

                                  SHERLOCK
                    So.  Of the six names Dr. Mantlo 
                    gave me, only two have ever been in 
                    any trouble with the police.                                                                                                  28

                    The first is the contractor who 
                    oversaw the redesign of their 
                    house, Joseph Narducci.Has a 
                    string of unpaid parking tickets.  
                    The second is Carter Polk, an 
                      administrator at Bellevue Hospital.  
                    He was accused of stalking a 
                    neighbor two years ago.  Charges 
                    were eventually dropped, but still.

                                  JOAN

                    Logged onto the NYPDmainframe as 
                    Captain Gregson.  Only took me 
                    seven tries to deduce his password.
                          (then)
                      Admini-stalkerseems like the best

                    What do you mean?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I mean we should talk to him first.  
                    Then the other five. 

                                  JOAN
                    But... the police still think 
                    Mantlo is their guy. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    The police  think  lots of things.  
                    It s adorable.  
                          (then)
                    I m confused.  I thought you agreed 
                    with me about the hands. 

                                  JOAN
                          (exasperated)
                    It was a photograph!  I think
                    you re right, but to know for sure, 
                    I d have to examine the bruise 
                    patterns on the body myself!  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Fine.  I ll arrange it.  After
                    we ve spoken to the suspects. 

  So not what Joan meant.  And after a beat:

                                  JOAN
                    You ve been out of rehab all of 
                    four hours now, and you ve injected 
                    yourself into a murder 
                      investigation.  I think a minute of 
                    breath-catching is in order, don t 
                    you? 

  And as she TURNS to get in line for a dog, and a frustrated 
  Sherlock follows --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I m sure you ve gleaned quite a bit 
                    in your years as an addiction 
                      specialist, but it s important that 
                    you understand that absolutely none
                    of it applies to me.  I moved at a 
                    certain pace before my... time 
                    away, and I ll move at that same 
                    pace now that I m back.  You can 
                      demonstrate your comprehension of 
                    that fact by following me to your 
                    car.   

  He starts to move off, but Joan calls after him --

                                  JOAN
                    Your friend, Captain Gregson.  He 
                    doesn t know where you reallyspent 
                    the last six months, does he?  

  Sherlock FREEZES.  Keeps his back to her as --

                                  JOAN (CONT D)
                    He told me you called him from 
                    HeathrowAirport the other day, 
                    when I know for a factyou were 
                    still in Hemdale. 
                          (then; when he SAYS 
                            NOTHING)
                    Makes me think you re worried he 
                    wouldn t be as keen on inviting you 
                    to crime scenes if he knew about 
                    your...  time away.   

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You can t tell him about it.  It 
                    would be a breach of our 
                      confidentiality.                                                                                                30
  CONTINUED: (3)

                                  JOAN
                    I can tell your brother.  And I can 
                    strongly recommend that hetell the 
                    Captain.  
                          (then)
                    The choice is yours, Mr. Holmes.  
                    Do you want to risk losing the 
                    brownstone andyour day job?  Or do 
                    you want to eat a hot dog? 

  A beat, then Holmes TURNS to her.  She knows that she s got him.  
  She indicates to the hot dog vendor that she d like two... and 
  as she passes one to an unhappy Sherlock...

                                                                            CUT TO:


  Joan EMERGES from a stairwell.  STOPS SHORT at the sight of...

    ...Sherlock, sitting in a lawn chair and WATCHING (from only a 
  semi-safe distance) as thousands of BEES swarm around man-made 
  HIVES on PALLETS.  

  RESUME JOAN.  Dumbstruck by the realization that Holmes keeps an 
  apiary on his roof.  In Brooklyn.  And after a moment --  

                                  JOAN
                    Did you know honey is dripping 
                    through the ceiling downstairs?

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (absently)
                    Yes, that happens sometimes.  

  And when it becomes clear that s all he has to say about it --

                                  JOAN
                    I take it beekeeping is a hobby?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I m writing a book.   Practical 
                    Handbook of Bee Culture with some 
                    Observations upon the Segregation 
                    of the Queen.   

  Then, as Joan observes his lack of writing implements, he taps 
  his head --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Up here.  Just started chapter 19.  
                    Would you like to hear the last few 
                      paragraphs? 

  Joan just pulls a chair.  And after they watch the bees a 
  moment...

                                  JOAN
                    You talk to the police about scary 
                      administrator guy yet? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I have not. 

                                  JOAN
                    But I thought...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Mr. Polk is a prat, no doubt.  But 
                    his body language said sub, not 
                    dom.I don t see him having the 
                    berries to take another life.                                                                                                 35

  Another QUIET MOMENT passes, and then --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    You re not comfortable here.

                                  JOAN
                    Bees sting.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I m not talking about the roof, I m 
                    talking about my home. 

                                  JOAN
                          (admits)
                    It s different.  But I ll get used 
                    to it.  Just like you ll get used 
                    to me -- 

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (suddenly; out of nowhere)
                    Why do you suppose you hate your 
                    job so much? 

                                  JOAN
                          (huh?)
                    I don t hate my job.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You have two alarm clocks.  No one 
                    with two alarm clocks loves their 
                    job.  Two alarms means it s a chore 
                    for you to get up in the morning.  
                    You don t hate what I do, though.  
                    That much was obvious when we spoke 
                    with Mr. Polk.  

                                  JOAN
                    What reyou talking about? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    The look on your face.  I d imagine 
                    it was the same you wore to the 
                    O.R.when you were still a surgeon.

  He s right, of course, but Joan just laughs it off.

                                  JOAN
                    You re crazy. 

  Holmes doesn t think so.  And after he studies her a moment --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I know my brother secured your 
                    services for the next six weeks, 
                    but the simple truth is: I don t 
                    need you.  I m finishedwith drugs.                                                                                                  36

                    I won t be using them again.
                          (STANDING from his chair)
                    My advice?  Go on a six-week 
                    vacation.  I promise I won t tell 
                    big brother.  

  He disappears into the stairwell.  And ON JOAN...

                                                                            CUT TO:


  Holmes is leaning against Joan s car she EMERGES from Teresa s 
  house.  He starts to say something, but she cuts him off:

                                  JOAN
                    The name of the man who attacked 
                    her is Peter Saldua.                                                                                                 41

                                  JOAN (CONT'D)
                          (then; when she SEES she 
                          has his attention)
                    He was her brother s best friend 
                    growing up.  His dad was abusive, 
                    so her parents took him in during 
                    his senior year of high school.  He 
                    was like a sibling to her.
                          (lets that sink in; then)
                    She wasn t lying when she said he 
                    wore a mask the night he attacked 
                    her.  She didn t know he was the 
                    one who hurt her until he came to 
                    her a few days later and confessed.  
                          (then)
                    He was devastated.  Ashamed.  He 
                    begged her forgiveness and swore 
                    he d get help.  She decided to take 
                    him at his word.  And she never 
                    told anyonetheir secret.  
                          (beat)
                    Doesn t prove he s alsothe man who 
                    killed Lisa Dampier, of course... 
                    but if we want to talk to him, 
                    Teresa heard from her brother that 
                    he s working as a delivery man for 
                    a florist in Chelsea.

  A lengthy beat as Sherlock absorbs that... and then he SMILES.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I knew it. 

                                  JOAN
                          (huh?)
                    Knew what?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I knew she d open up to you after I 
                    left.  
                          (then;  Don t you see? )
                    She has issues with men, or 
                    couldn t you tell?  Understandable, 
                    of course, given what she went 
                    through.  I knew that if I made a 
                    row in there you d come to her 
                    defense.  And I knew that if you 
                    came to her defense, she might very 
                    well tell youthe truth.

  He claps his hands, delighted with himself.  Pulls out his phone 
  and dials a number.  And after Joan STUDIES him a moment --

                                  JOAN
                    You re full of it. 
                          (then; off his LOOK)                                                                                                42

                                  JOAN (CONT'D)
                    You re embarrassed because I 
                    figured out something you couldn t, 
                    so now you re making it sound like 
                    you  planned  the whole thing. 

  Sherlock just smiles at that --  Absurd  -- as he HEARS a 
  familiar voice on the other end of the line:

                                  GREGSON (V.O.)
                    This is Gregson.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Captain, it s Sherlock Holmes.  I m 
                    calling because I believe I ve 
                    uncovered the name of a strong 
                    suspect in the murder of Lisa 
                    Dampier--

                                  GREGSON (V.O.)
                          (cuttinghim off)
                    Name wouldn t be Peter Saldua by 
                    any chance, would it? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (beat; the wind GONE from 
                          his sails)
                    How did you know? 

                                  GREGSON (V.O.)
                    Because.  I m at his house.  I m 
                    looking at him right now.  

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Are you saying he s in police 
                    custody? 

                                                                    SHOCK CUT TO:


  Dr. Nicholas Mantlo climbs out of a six-figure SPORTS CAR, 
  moonlight beating down on the EAST RIVER and FDRDRIVE beyond 
  him.  And as Sherlock suddenly approaches, trailed by Joan: 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Youwere Peter Saldua s last 
                    therapist, weren t you?  You 
                    started treating him, what... 
                    eighteen months ago?  Probably just 
                    a few weeks before you talked your 
                    wife into all that plastic surgery. 

                                  MANTLO
                    Excuse me? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Saldua wanted to fix himself.  Dr. 
                    Jessupwas his first attempt, you
                    were his second.  Quite a bit of 
                    luck, that.  You, a man with a wife 
                    he wanted dead, stumbling across 
                    him, a man with an obsessive 
                      personality and a history of 
                    violence?  Only problem, of course, 
                    was that Lisa didn t fit his victim 
                    profile.  You accounted for that by 
                    pressuring her into altering her 
                    appearance until she did.  

  FLASH TO: Pre-surgery Lisa, sitting with Mantlo in their DINING 
  ROOM.  And as he addresses her (MOS), showing her PICTURES he s 
  clipped from magazines of women with curves and red hair... 

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    My guess is you made her think it 
                    was all for her; that she d look 
                    more beautiful than ever...

                                  MANTLO
                          (seemingly confused)
                    You re Mr. Holmes, right?  We met 
                    the other day --                                                                                                 54

                    The pill vial in Saldua s home.  It 
                    came from you.  A sample from the 
                    hospital, no doubt; virtually 
                    impossible to trace back.  He 
                    thought he was taking a 
                      tranquilizer, but he wasn t, was 
                    he?  He was taking a steroid.

  FLASH TO: Mantlo, sitting at a table in his HOME, emptying a 
  VIAL of Xanaxpills and replacing them with the same round, pink 
  pills Gregson handled in the BULLPEN of the POLICE STATION.

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    You were whipping him into a 
                    killing frenzy.  A frenzy that only 
                    made him moreconfused, more
                    violent -- 

  FLASH TO: Saldua, in a fit of RAGE, TEARING his own washing 
  machine out of his wall and then STOMPING on it with one foot. 

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    -- more likely to give into his 
                    terrible compulsions.  

                                  MANTLO
                    I never even heardthe name  Peter 
                    Saldua  until the police told me he 
                    was the man who d killed Lisa --

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Bollocks.I have no doubt you ve 
                    eliminated whatever  paper trail  
                    there was to connect you, but that 
                    doesn t mean you didn t know each 
                    other.  Out of curiosity, how many 
                    sessions was it before you realized 
                    you could usehim to take a life?

  Mantlo just TURNS and walks away.  And as Holmes follows --

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    Once you did, I imagine you took to 
                    meeting in odd places at odd times 
                    so you d never be seen together...  

  FLASH TO: A tortured-looking Saldua, sitting with Mantlo on this 
  BENCH in CENTRAL PARK and pouring his heart out.

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    If he ever questioned it, you told 
                    him it was part of his therapy.  
                    When the time was right, you took 
                    advantage of his job as a delivery 
                    man to place him in Lisa s orbit.                                                                                                  55

                      Youarranged for flowers to be sent 
                    to the house once a week because 
                    you needed him to see her; you 
                    needed him to become obsessedwith 
                    her.    

  FLASH TO: A front door OPENING to REVEAL a Post-Surgery Lisa 
  Dampier.And as a REVERSE ANGLE finds Saldua on her doorstep, a 
  FLORAL ARRANGEMENT clutched in his hands...

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    You loaded him like a weapon, and 
                    then you pointed him squarely at 
                    your wife. 

  ON MANTLO -- as he suddenly STOPS at this.  Turns back to 
  Sherlock.  And while he SAYS NOTHING... it s hard not to get the 
  sense that 1.) Sherlock s theory is correct, and 2.) that
  Mantlo, on some bizarre level, actually appreciates that 
    Sherlockappreciates the intricacy of his crime.  And ON JOAN, 
  who can SEE for the first time the GUILT in Mantlo s eyes... 

                                  MANTLO
                    So... according to you... I tricked 
                    a stalker into hunting my wife.  
                    I m sorry, but that just doesn t 
                    make any sense to me.  Stalkers 
                    stalk.  Eventually, he would ve 
                    seen us together and realized I was 
                    up to something.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You could ve used GPSin his cell 
                    phone to keep track of him.  All 
                    you would ve needed was access to 
                    his phone to download the necessary 
                      application -- access you had
                    during your sessions.   

  FLASH TO: Central Park again.  Mantlo s  session  with Saldua is 
  just ending.  He tries to make a call, but indicates to Saldua 
  (MOS) that he doesn t have reception.  Saldua is only too happy 
  to pass the doctor his own phone.  And as a grateful Mantlo 
  takes it and begins to manipulate its display...

                                  SHERLOCK (CONT D)
                    That way, when he found himself in 
                      a  stalking mood,  you could make 
                    yourself scarce around the house.  
                    He d see Lisa, but not you, and 
                    your secret would be safe.
                          (then)
                    Of course, that s not why you took
                    his phone after you murdered him 
                    and made it look like a suicide.                                                                                                  56

                                    SHERLOCK(CONT D)
                    You took it because he d been 
                    recording yoursessions as well.  I 
                    imagine you were fine with it in 
                    the beginning;  whatever helps the 
                    poor nutter.   But then, once it 
                    occurred to you how you might  use  
                    Saldua, you realized the phone was 
                    the only evidence of a linkbetween 
                    you.  Problem?  Of course not.  

  FLASH TO: Saldua, hitting the floor of his HOME with a THUD, a 
  bloody hole in the side of his head.  And as Nicholas Mantlo 
  KNEELS DOWN, pressing a PISTOL into the dead man s hand...

                                  SHERLOCK (O.C.) (CONT D)
                    Killing him was always a part of 
                    the plan; you would just nick the 
                    phone after you d done the deed.

  Mantlo just gives a small smile.  And as he finally leans in 
  close to Holmes, speaking quietly so that passersby can t hear: 

                                  MANTLO
                    Hypothetically, Mr. Holmes, a man 
                    wants out of his marriage to his 
                    very wealthy wife.  He knows that, 
                    over the course of their 
                      relationship, he s signed a 
                    prenuptial agreement that says he 
                    gets nothing if he leaves her... 
                    and a living trust that says he 
                    gets everythingif she dies.  
                          (beat)
                      Hypothetically... wouldn t that man 
                    be smarter to look for a way to 
                    trigger the clauses in the second
                    document as opposed to the first?  
                    As to the lengths such a man -- 
                    hypothetically, a very intelligent 
                    and careful man -- would go to keep 
                    his hands clean, well... how better 
                    to commit a murder than manipulate 
                    someone else into doing it foryou?

  A beat, and then he pulls away from Holmes.  Nods a quick  good 
  evening  to Joan before he resumes his course for the hospital.  

                                  JOAN
                    What did he say?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    He said that he did it. 

                                  JOAN
                    We need to tell the police --                                                                                                57

                                  SHERLOCK
                    There s no point.  It s hearsay.  
                    We don t have any proof and he 
                    knows it. 

  He s SEETHING.  To say he s unaccustomed to being bested by his 
  adversaries would be putting it mildly. 

                                  JOAN
                    So... what do we do now? 

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (beat; then)
                    I need your car keys. 

  Joan is only too happy to hand them over.  She watches as he 
  TAKES them, STALKS back to her car, gets behind the wheel... and 
  then FLOORS IT, tearing ACROSS the parking lot and INTO the side 
  of Dr. Mantlo s expensive sports car.  And ON Joan, GOBSMACKED--
