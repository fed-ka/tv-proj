A nunnery tucked in a clearing, forest all around.  A chapel, 
a main hall, living quarters, outbuildings complete with 
livestock. Crops.  These nuns are self-sustaining.

CHYRON - CONVENT ST. MICHEL - FRANCE, 1557


A tangle of lean legs scissor through frame, fighting over a 
hand-stitched muddy soccer ball.  TEENAGE GIRLS (students) in 
drab uniforms, and YOUNG NUNS (in habits) on both teams. 
Skirts hiked, tied at the waist for ease of movement. 

A small crowd of students and nuns are also on the side-
lines, cheering or waiting to get in the game. Among them, a 
young girl, ROSE, 9, roots with fervor for a single player:

ROSE
Go Mary, go!  Get ready, take it -- 

ON MARY, 15, a fresh-faced Scottish beauty and a natural 
athlete, racing to receive a pass, when a plain-faced nun 
(SR. AGNES, 20 s), SLAMS into her.  Mary reels, in pain, as 
the ball sails past.  A girl, a newer student, checks in.

TEAMMATE
She did that on purpose.  
Why does she hate you so?

Mary clocks both the offending nun and the ball in play.  

MARY
I ve no idea, but I m used to it. 
(encouraging)
Don t worry, most everyone else on 
the team are really good sports. 

Mary sees a break and races for the ball.  Wedging between 
other players, aggressively taking control.  CRIES of  MARY! 
MARY! MARY!  as she takes the ball down the field, passing to 
another girl for a GOAL.

Girls, nuns, Mary and her teammates roughly embrace -- Mary 
is well liked, easily approached, a total team player.      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft

Dozens of horses pummel the ground.  Mounted by a SMALL ARMY 
of Kingsmen, guards.  Racing to the convent.  To Mary.


-- obscuring the fact, for the moment, that a short period of 
time has passed.  

WIDEN ON MARY -- TRANSFORMED.  No longer a convent girl, she 
is a YOUNG QUEEN.  Wearing a gorgeous gown, jewels, a floor 
length cloak -- she is stunning, regal.

Mary moves forward, her WOLFHOUND following faithfully. ROWS 
of CONVENT GIRLS standing on either side of her path.  They 
stare, slack-jawed, in their drab uniforms. NUNS behind them 
in small clusters. And in the distance:

An ARMY OF GUARDS waiting in FORMATION. An ornate CARRIAGE, a 
FOOTMAN unfolding upholstered steps, extra horses, 
provisions, silks for shading, all for our young queen. 

ON MARY walking as the Abbess steps forward to say goodbye.

MARY
I m not sure I m ready...

ABBESS
To leave here or marry the future 
king of France?       REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
4.

MARY

Both.

The nun embraces her.  Quietly, aware of the French guards: 

ABBESS
You re doing this for your faith, for 
your people, for Scotland.
(reassuring)
He will love you. 

MARY
I m not sure that matters.

ABBESS
(warmly)
It does to you. 

Mary s look tells us the nun is right as we -- 


At the CARRIAGE now, Mary about to step inside when young 
Rose breaks from the pack, races to her.  Hands Mary a small 
DOLL made from twigs and yarn (with a girl s features). 

ROSE
I made it to protect you.

MARY
Protect me from what? 

ROSE
Ghosts.  They say the castle s 
haunted.  A blind priest slaughtered, 
a young girl whose face is a ruin, 
she hides it --

MARY
(comforting, shush now)
I ve lived at French Court before, 
you know, until I was your age.  I 
never saw any ghosts. 

ROSE 
But what if they saw you. 

A chill up Mary s spine as the procession begins to shift 
into gear, a footman taking her elbow -- it s time to go.       REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft

ON MARY - inside her carriage now, door shut; secured, locked 
away, anxious but hopeful. Leaving the other girls and her 
childhood behind.  Off Mary s grand exit:


Establishing the structure, its towers and walls, a wide 
stream winding through low grasses.  A thick forest nearby, 
and in the far distance, some villages. 

CHYRON - PALACE OF FONTAINEBLEAU - COURT OF KING HENRY II 


We re with Francis as he enters the suite. A very large, 
formal main room, where CATHERINE DE MEDICI, Queen Consort 
(early 30 s, Italian-born, hard-eyed, contained but feral), 
and Francis s father, HENRY II (also early 30 s, strapping, 
fit, confident), bicker in hushed tones. An old disagreement 
rekindled.

In the b.g, in an anteroom, out of earshot, PRINCESS 
ELISABETH (18, pretty) reviews fabric, food, and sketches for 
her wedding, with the help of a stern Queen s lady (JEANNETTE 
LOUISE, 40) and a few highborn girls. Elisabeth nods toward 
her brother, Francis, who settles in the main room, closer to 
their parents  debate, unreadable. 

QUEEN CATHERINE
Mary should be protected.  Hidden --

KING HENRY
(calling bullshit)
So you ve claimed. You sent her away 
for her education and her health too. 
I let you because it served my ends.  
It doesn t any longer. Not to 
mention, there s been an attempt on 
her life. 

Watching from the b.g. group is NATALIA, 16, a delicate, 
highborn Italian girl. Hoping to catch Francis s eye during -- 

QUEEN CATHERINE
She s not an orphan. Her mother s 
ruling Scotland in her stead, let her 
protect Mary there.  

KING HENRY
Those were not the terms.  

Unnoticed, Elisabeth moves closer with a small pastry.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
7.

QUEEN CATHERINE
(tries another tack)
There are those who say too many 
alliances make a king look weak. 

KING HENRY
We don t need alliances?  Then why 
were you so keen to sell our daughter 
to Spain? 

ELISABETH
Father!

He turns to his daughter unapologetically, eyes the pastry.

KING HENRY
Be a good princess, Elisabeth, and 
practice your Spanish. 

Catherine tastes the pastry s gold leaf, disapproving. 

QUEEN CATHERINE
It lacks the bitterness of a better 
gold.  Tell them it won t do. 

Elisabeth sighs, returns to her wedding planning area.  The 
Queen turns, finally acknowledging Francis with a look. 

FRANCIS
I m told I was needed. Or should I 
just come back on my wedding day?  
You ve chosen my wife, have you set 
the date, too? 

KING HENRY
Here s the date: when I say so.  Or 
England turns its sword in our 
direction. 
(adds, less gruff)
She s on her way. 

FRANCIS
Mary Stuart, you mean.  I heard. 

KING HENRY
And her ladies-in-waiting. Three 
titled, the other ridiculously rich.

QUEEN CATHERINE
(to King, a dig)
Just your type. I remember them.

The King looks from Catherine to his son.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft

KING HENRY
They say your bride s a beauty, at 
least. And she has a country, and an  
army, should you need it.
(to Queen, back at ya)
Not just a big pile of money.

And he exits.  Catherine angles closer, reminding: 

QUEEN CATHERINE
He s right about one thing.  My money 
funds the realm. Your father might 
talk like a king, but your wedding 
won t happen until I say so. 

Catherine heads back to join her daughter Elisabeth.  Francis 
looks across the way to Natalia. Her gaze and small smile 
searching for some affirmation. He gives her a slight nod, 
confirming their connection, but goes --  


A bustling harbor.  A large SHIP in the distance. Three girls 
are reunited for their journey.  GREER, 15, wealthy but 
lacking title, and AILLIE, 14, tomboyish but capable of 
blossoming, hug, thrilled to be together again.  KENNA, 15,  
vibrant, daring, marvels as Greer s things go aboard. 

GREER
Kenna, Aillie, it s been too long --  

KENNA
Greer, these can t all be clothes!

GREER
(shrugs, wry)
There s jewelry and silver too.  

KENNA
I can t believe we re going back to 
France! Ladies at Mary s side. 

GREER
(what s the big surprise?)
It s only been planned since we were 
infants. 

AILLIE
But we weren t supposed to return 
until next year. It s because of the 
poisoning --      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
9.

KENNA
It s because Mary and Francis are 
nearly of age.  Best to get our young 
queen in the game before the prince s 
eye wanders.  

AILLIE
But the marriage is already arranged.

KENNA
As an agreement between Scotland and 
France.  But allegiances can shift.  
Passions can bloom beyond control...
(nods, amused)
Lola can warn Mary all about that. 

The girls follow Kenna s gaze, and meaning, to: 

A COUPLE entwined behind a carriage, mostly protected from 
view.  We see LOLA, 15, pretty, with her hands entangled in a 
boy s hair, hips and lips pressed to his... 

KENNA (CONT D)
Lola better be careful. They check 
girls before marriage in France.

GREER
Just the nobles...

Kenna shakes her head, not what I ve heard, as:

AILLIE
Check them?  You mean --

KENNA
For purity.  You have to be a virgin.  
You must know that.

AILLIE
But how do they...

KENNA
It s all very medical, over with 
quickly, quick as your chance of 
marrying anyone good if you fail. 

GREER
(feels insecure)
Some of us start out with better 
chances than others.
(to Aillee, then Kenna)
You re both titled.  Your father s a 
count, yours an earl --       REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
10.

KENNA
And you ll be titled too, before you 
know it.  
(so excited)
We re going to live at French Court. 
We ll meet rich, powerful men from 
dozens of countries. Girls like us?  
We can t lose.  

Lola has pried herself from her boyfriend.  Joins them now.  
Accepts the hug from Greer but glancing to the boyfriend.

LOLA
I m so excited, and so, so sad.  
Colin says he ll wait for me.  

GREER
Until when?  We might never be back 
in Scotland again. You do know that.  
Our lives belong to Mary now. 

The reality of this settles. But Aillie is firm, positive.

AILLIE
We re together, we re friends, we re 
Scots.  Mary belongs to us. 


REVERSE ANGLE -- at a distance.  A small window encases a 
shape that might be a girl -- obscured by the rippled glass. 
Her head oddly shaped, as if something covered it completely. 

In the foreground, just inside the open gates, Kenna, Greer, 
Lola and Aillie, are exiting carriages, looking towards --

Mary s arrival.  Dozens of Kingsguards, her ornate carriage, 
and Mary stepping out of it. Rushing to her friends. 


Mary hugs each of her friends, who chat and primp amongst 
themselves as she releases them, all casting anxious glances 
toward the castle as people begin to spill out.

MARY
Lola, Greer, Kenna! I m so glad 
you re here.  
(a special hug for)
Aillee, we re all together again. 

Seeing Mary s hair is loose and wild, Greer quickly winds it.

GREER
Oh Mary, your hair, didn t the nuns 
teach you anything -- 

Amused but not caring, Mary shakes it free as quickly as 
Greer has loosely wound it.  Laughs as -- 

AILLIE
Look, they re here, they re coming --     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
14.

ON THE KING a distance away, positioning for Mary s group s 
approach.  Henry s with his coterie and the WOMAN we glimpsed 
earlier, his mistress, DIANE de Poitiers, a very sexy 40. 

MARY
There s the King, but is that 
Catherine...?

LOLA
(eager to share)
That s Diane de Poitiers, his 
mistress.  The rumors are true -- 

KENNA
That is bold. 

The King, as well as a group of YOUNG MEN (SQUIRES), 
Francis s men, already checking out our girls. Bash, pushing 
out in front of them.  The girls shyly catch the men s 
appreciative stares, look away, particularly when the King s 
gaze passes over them.  All but Kenna who meets the King s 
look for a moment.  Her eyes glitter, amused, daring. 

Mary is preoccupied, scanning the court for Francis as Bash 
crosses, gets a warm nod from the King, stands by Diane.

KENNA (CONT D)
Is that Francis?  He s gorgeous...

MARY
That s not Francis, I know it isn t.

From another area, QUEEN CATHERINE and her ladies and guards. 
The girls scan the gathering, Mary still seeking Francis...

ON FRANCIS -- approaching, unnoticed, except by Mary. Their 
gaze locks and it is electric.   He seems thrown by her 
beauty, stopping momentarily to take it in.  To herself, a 
wide smile forming as he nears -- what a relief, what luck...

MARY (CONT D)
I don t believe it...

Standing before her now, Francis bows slightly. 

FRANCIS
Your Grace. 

MARY
Call me Mary, please.  

FRANCIS
Francis.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
15.

She s nervous but also exuberant, open, taking in the castle. 

MARY
The castle seems bigger, how is that 
possible?  And you too, of course.

FRANCIS
(charmed by her candor)
Is that such a surprise?

From a distance, we see Natalia is among the high-borns of 
court flanking the King.  She sees Mary and Francis s easy 
chemistry as an unguarded Mary cheerfully rambles on: 

MARY
No.  Especially since your legs were 
always longer than mine.  I hated 
that when we were young, I was always 
chasing after you, but now...

He s strapping and cute.  Mary blushes, adds quickly:

MARY (CONT D)
Now it suits you.  

Francis can t help but smile.  A jealous Natalia sees this 
too, and she s not the only one... 

From a distance, Nostradamus now stands with Queen Catherine, 
both watching as Mary and Francis talk, making their way 
toward the King. Catherine sees Nostradamus s grim concern.

CATHERINE
What is it?  You ve had a vision...

NOSTRADAMUS
It s clear now.  I saw your son s 
future, with Mary, their union...

CATHERINE
Say it. 

NOSTRADAMUS
She will cost Francis his life.

ACT ONE


Mary and Aillie are near the wide but shallow stream.  Mary s 
WOLFHOUND is with them, angling through the grasses as Mary 
collects small, pretty rocks, agates, along the shoreline. 

AILLIE
...I can t believe the door in the 
old Keep is still unlocked. 

MARY
It looked like it hadn t been opened 
since we were last here. 

AILLIE
You should tell Francis about it.  If 
you re going to meet alone, and I m 
not saying you should, you need to be 
careful. 

MARY
It wasn t a meeting.  We weren t 
alone on purpose.  He s... I... 

Aillie knows her friend. Knows Mary s smile and stammering 
means she s just beginning to hope.  Aillie can tell: 

AILLIE
You like him.  You were children 
together, why wouldn t you?      REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
26.

MARY
Because it s all so forced now. I 
thought, what are the odds?  But...

AILLIE
But...? 

MARY
What if this isn t just our fate, 
what if it is Fate?  What if we 
actually belong together? Wouldn t 
that be amazing.

Mary laughs, more hopeful than convinced. Aillie loves it.  

AILLIE
Yes.  It would. 

The girls happy, at ease as Mary picks some pretty stones --

ANOTHER POV - watching them.  The dog senses something, 
doesn t like it. Turns in our direction, uneasy, growling.

On Mary and Aillie as the dog lunges toward the tall grasses. 
Aggressively barking and starting off toward the woods.  
Startling Mary, who drops some of the stones she s collected. 

MARY
Stirling, no!  Come! Now!

The dog hesitates, turning back, but distracted, on guard. 

From a distance, we see Mary, Aillie and the dog head back 
toward the castle. The stones she dropped left behind. 


Back at the stream, Mary fumes.  Takes the small stones she d 
brought to Francis and HURLS them toward the water. They 
spray across the tall grasses, rustling some ducks and birds.  
Mary s WOLFHOUND alerts, and bounds off, giving chase. 

MARY
Stirling, not again, leave it... 

The dog ignores her, after something, going INTO THE FOREST.

MARY (CONT D)
Stirling, no, wait!

Mary races after the dog.


Darkening under the thick canopy of trees.  Mary pushes 
through the woods, using the sharp edge of an ARROW to MARK 
TREES.  Her face is scratched from branches, her thin-soled 
shoes nearly destroyed.  No sign of the dog, and worse yet... 
She finds a MARK she d already cut into the bark of a tree.

MARY
No... I ve gone in a circle.
(calls out, pissed)
Stirling!  You got us lost!  
Stirling, where are you?  

No response.  Irritated but driven, Mary pushes on. 


Darkness all around.  The castle lit in the distance.


FIREWORKS EXPLODE in the night sky, showering trails of 
glittering silver and gold over the palace in celebration.


The final send-off for ELISABETH as she sets off for Spain 
with PHILIP, her new husband.  Two carriages at the front of 
the procession -- one for Philip and his STEWARD, the one 
behind it for Elisabeth and her LADIES.  Several carts laden 
with chests containing clothes, provisions, Elisabeth s 
dowry, etc... lined up behind. The YOUNG VALOIS SIBLINGS, 
including HANK, run up and down the procession.  Hank s 
wielding one of the swords we recall from Francis  workshop.   

NEW ANGLE - HENRY plants a perfunctory farewell kiss on 
Elisabeth s forehead.  

HENRY
God be with you, child.  Remember 
your duties to France.

He looks to Philip, pats his shoulder --

HENRY (CONT D)
As well as your duties to Spain.

ELISABETH
Yes, father.

Henry s restless, his eyes roam the crowd.  DIANE notices, 
knowingly follows his gaze as it lands --

ON KENNA who demurely averts her eyes, but smiles in spite of 
herself.

NEW ANGLE - LEITH, and other KITCHEN SERVANTS, pack 
provisions onto one of the carts. He sees GREER looking his 
way, but studiously ignores her as he goes about his work.

ON LOLA, pale and listless as she stands with AILLIE watching 
Elisabeth embrace CATHERINE.     REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft

LOLA
(to Aillie, re: Elisabeth)
Look how happy she is.  She s in 
love, and her life is just 
beginning...

Her voice trails off as her eyes well with tears and Aillie 
puts a comforting arm around her.

REVERSE ANGLE - MARY overhears Lola.  She moves toward her, 
but stops when she sees FRANCIS with NATALIA and catches a 
fleeting touch between the two of them.

ON CATHERINE - pleased, as she clocks Mary seeing Francis 
with Natalia.  She can t help it, feels jealous, irritated.

NEW ANGLE - BASH also clocks Mary s jealousy.  He crosses to 
her.  She smiles at his approach.

BASH
Seems we were just here.  Welcoming 
you to court.

MARY
Does it?  To me, it feels like a 
lifetime ago.

REVERSE ANGLE - FRANCIS watches Mary and Bash, wondering what 
they re talking about.

The clatter of hooves and wheels on stone as the procession 
lurches into motion and the CAMERA CRANES UP watching it 
snake away from the palace out onto the road that hugs the 
treeline of the woods beyond the palace walls as --  

DAY DISSOLVES INTO NIGHT, AND THE RUMBLE OF THE PROCESSION 
FADES TO AN ECHO --


FOLLOW A DARK FIGURE/N.D. HENCHMAN, dragging a heavy load -- 
a body -- deep into the forest.  Through dense tree coverage, 
in snippets, we see: 

A rope swung over a tree limb.  The corpse hoisted, feet 
first, just high enough off the ground to allow gravity to do 
its work.  The flash of steel as a dagger slits the dead 
throat.  Blood draining into a sacrificial bowl.  The bough 
creaks, and the rope twists to REVEAL - COLIN S DEAD BODY, 
swaying in the moonlight.

ANGLE DOWN TO - the sacrificial bowl, now brimming with 
blood.       REIGN PILOT - network rewrites 1/15/2013 Draft            
61.

WIDEN TO REVEAL a hooded, CLOAKED FIGURE (distinct from and 
more refined than the N.D. Henchman) emerging from the trees, 
slinking toward the bowl, carefully picking it up.  The 
figure moves off with the bowl, deeper into the woods -- 
toward some unseen destination.


Alone, Mary stands on a stone parapet that provides a BIRD S 
EYE VIEW of the castle grounds, framed by the deep dark woods 
in the distance.  A light snow falls.  

SHIFT POV - SOMEONE STANDING BEHIND MARY, watching her.  

ANGLE DOWN TO - edges of a tattered, dirty gown.  Delicate, 
ashen grey, bare feet standing in the snow.

BACK ON MARY - she senses a presence but does not turn or 
confront.  Softly, calmly, she speaks to the watcher:

MARY
I don t know who you are or why you 
hide, but your warning saved me.  
Danger surrounds me here, and I am in 
your debt.  

WIDEN TO REVEAL both figures, silhouetted in shadow - 
Clarissa behind Mary, a burlap hood obscuring her head.

MARY (CONT D)
Are you in danger, too?

BACK ON MARY - as she pauses, hoping her words have put her 
listener at ease.  She turns -- but CLARISSA IS GONE.
