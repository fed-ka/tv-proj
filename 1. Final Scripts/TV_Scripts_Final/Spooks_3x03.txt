      EXT. ROOF TOP GARDEN. DAMASCUS - 1200
11

      Damascus, Early 2003


      Oliver Mace and Muhammed Khordad - leader of an powerful 
      Pakistani terror group - The Path of Light - sit on either 
      side of a small table.  Mace wears a Western suit.  Khordad, 
      is in simple robes.

      They are in a small roof garden on top of tower block in the 
      Syrian capital.

      Khordad points to a small row of catci in a tray near them. 
      He speaks in Urdu.


                                    KHORDAD
                          (subtitled)

                    You know this plant has been known 
                    to survive in sand measured at 
                    80 C. It has no known predator.


      Mace watches him.  He resumes in English.


                                    KHORDAD
                    Early in  97, I was told that there 
                    was a traitor in my organisation - 
                    but by the time I uncovered him, it 
                    was already too late -  he had 
                    already been ... spirited away.

      He looks over at Mace.


                                    KHORDAD
                    And I assume you and the Americans 
                    are still looking after him.  The 
                    witness protection scheme or 
                    whatever misnomer you give it.

      Mace doesn t react but he knows what s coming.


                                    KHORDAD
                    This man is the price of our co-
                      operation.

      Mace shakes his head. 


                                  MACE
                    That s not going to be possible. 
                    Why on earth do you think we would 

                    betray an old friend like that?

                                    KHORDAD
                    Because I m your new friend and am 

                    now more important to you than the 
                    old one. 


      The picture suddenly FREEZES into a BLACK AND WHITE still of 
      the two of them - taken from high above.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      INT. DANNY AND ZOE S FLAT - DAY A. 0900
22

      Saturday, Present.

      Zoe is dressing for a wedding.  Will lies on the bed.  She 
      walks past him in her underwear holding a Grace Kelly dress 
      in front of herself.

                                  ZOE
                     Preview of forthcoming attraction

                    Know-all.

      She stops a moment.

                                  ZOE
                    You know what?  I ve been looking 
                    forward to this ... all week.

                                  WILL
                    That long?

      She smiles. 

                                  ZOE
                    It s been a long week, alright?

      INT. DANNY AND ZOE S FLAT - DAY A. 0920

      Will and Zoe, now dressed, come out of her room and go to 
      leave the flat.  They have overnight bags with them.  Zoe 
                                                                                              *
      stops when she sees Danny, lying awake on the sofa. Still in 
      his clothes from last night.  A empty wine bottle and an old 
      book next to him. (Later we will know the book is The Wisden)

      He never made it to his bed.

                                  WILL
                    I ll see you outside.
                                                                                              *

      Zoe nods, he heads off and she goes over to Danny.  She 
      stands for a moment.  Then he looks up and sees her.

                                  ZOE
                    Danny... it s me... you should get 
                    some sleep...

      He looks at her taking moment to focus. 

                                  ZOE
                    ... in a bed.

      He looks at her.

                    he had to act: he had to get out 
                    while the going was good. 

                                  ZOE

      Danny slumps back on the sofa, the week just gone still in 
      his head. 

      INT. BOOKSHOP. PADDINGTON - DAY 1. 1100

      Monday, the beginning of that week.

      Kevlar vest under his jacket, earpiece, Sig 9mm in a shoulder 
      holster, DANNY stands with his back to a wall shelved with 
      books.

      He s on CQP - Close Quarter Protection - alert, tense and

      ZULI: late forties, half-moon glasses, expensive suit. 
      Writer, intellectual, brought up in Pakistan, educated at 
      Yale and Cambridge.  And now, under a fatwa, the most wanted 
      man in the West.

      He argues in Urdu with his friend HARAKAT who runs the 
      bookshop and who is older, balder and wears traditional 
      Islamic robes.  They sit on large cushions, drinking coffee 
      and smoking foul-smelling Turkish cigarettes. 

      Danny watches them.  Guesses they re arguing about politics 
      or women or both.



                                  ZULI
                    What do you think Danny? 

      He looks at them.

                                  DANNY
                    My Urdu s a little rusty.

                                  ZULI
                    Harakat thinks I should consider 
                      renouncing what I wrote and then 
                    the fatwa would be lifted.

                                  DANNY
                    But what about me? What will I do 
                    then?

      The others laugh.

                                  ZULI
                    Go back to breaking into foreign 
                    embassies or stitching up 
                      Greenpeace or whatever it was you 
                    were doing before ...

      Danny shakes his head.

                                  DANNY
                    Trainee stuff.

      Danny smiles as they go back to talking in Urdu.

      rifle already up in the shoulder.  Just enough like a

      The room freezes.  Zuli and Harakat s argument cut off in mid-
      air.

      ANGLE ON: Zuli s eyes.  He s been imagining this moment 
      forever and here it is.

      ANGLE ON: Danny.  In one movement his gun is out, safety 
      catch off and he fires two rounds as he piles across the room 
      into Zuli.  Bringing him down hard.  

      Just as the first burst of fire sprays from the intruder s 
      gun, chewing up the packed bookcase behind them.

                    Red! Red! Zoe!

      Danny fires again.  Two shots ricochet off the wall and 
      around the room like pin ball.  The intruder is down, 
      crouched for an instant.

      But then he s back up.  Unhurt.

      GUNMAN S POV: he has a clear shot of Danny trying to drag 
      Zuli behind a table.


      Nothing can stop him this time: 

      He fires his second burst which would kill them both except 
      for ...

      The gunman sees the movement outside.  He fires off a burst 
      at the door shattering the glass.  Moving back now.  Covering 
      for his exit.

      Danny lying on the ground sees the disappearing figure 
      heading through the back door.  The smash of the Special 
      Branch coming straight through the window.

      The Special Branch and Zoe move through the shop covering

      Adam s catching up with Zoe and Danny as they walk through

      still ringing in his ear. 

      Zoe holds out the clear plastic forensic bag for Danny s 9mm 
      and spare magazine.

      Danny unplugs his earpiece and transmitter.  Drops them in a 
      separate bag.

      Danny has a book in front of him.  Malcolm sits with him 
      turning the pages.  Photographs and silhouettes of weapons. 
      While it s still fresh.  Weapon Identification. 

      Danny goes back on one of them.  His hand shaking slightly on 
      the page.

                                  DANNY
                    That s it.

                    No, it s not.  There s something 
                    missing.

      He concentrates hard a minute, goes back there.

                                  DANNY
                    Only the barrel had ... some sort 
                    of silencer.  The sound was 
                    muffled.

      Malcolm looks at him sceptically.  There s nothing in the 
      book to indicate this.

                                  DANNY
                          (slower)
                    It had some sort of silencer.

                    I very much doubt ...

                    long have you got?  Half the Muslim 
                    world wants me dead.  Wasn t it 
                    your job to protect me?

      And he actually points at Danny here.  And Danny s wired 
      enough as it is.

      Harry glances at him.

                                  HARRY
                    Yes, it is our job.  It was because 
                    of the heightened sense of threat   
                    to yourself that we came on board 
                    and we deeply regret what happened.

                    call  full protective 
                      surveillance .  We d have been 
                    better off just going to Starbucks 
                    on our own ...

                    Starbucks ... that would have been 
                    for coffee not tea.

      Zoe suppresses a smile. 

      And anyway Harry realises that this is getting them nowhere. 

                                  HARRY
                    Anyhow.  We appreciate your coming

      Ruth looks at Zoe a moment ... so she s serious about this 
      guy.  Adam comes over.

                    the people involved ...

      Ruth looks up at him.

                                  RUTH

                    He s being covered.  And Zoe and 
                    Danny will be on the hitman.  No, I 
                    want you to check out our friend - 
                    the bookseller Harakat. 

      She looks at him.

                                  ADAM
                      I sometimes think it s useful to 
                    look at an operation from a less 
                    obvious viewpoint.  Cover all 
                    bases.

      And before she can ask.

                                  ADAM
                    Harry tells me you re the soul of 
                      discretion?

      She pauses a moment, flattered.

                                  RUTH
                    Did he?  Well ... I try ... 

                                  ADAM
                    Good.  Thought so. 

      He starts to walk away to his desk when Ruth calls to him.

                                  RUTH
                    Oh and Tom ... !  Sorry ... oh God 
                    ... so sorry ... Adam ... I assume 
                    that means that you don t want me 
                    to distribute my research to the 
                    rest of the office as normal? 

                                  ADAM

      A table with neatly arranged photographs, drawings, maps 
      cartridges, replica weapons.

      Zoe and Danny heading up the operation, doing research into 
      who the hitman might be.  Zoe is writing suspects on the 
      board.  None yet.

      Malcolm puts a plastic forensic bag on the table.  In it is a 
      metal box the size of a packet of cigarette.

                    The forensic boys found this under 
                    our wagon.  It s a jamming device 
                    that can be triggered up to 500

                    And I d have been close behind.

      He looks at Danny.

                                    HARAKAT
                    That s where you re wrong.  The 
                    world is divided into two types: 
                    people like you who go looking for 
                    trouble and sensible people who 
                    avoid it.  In a moment of insanity 
                    I stepped over the line and look 
                    what happened.  I should have stuck 
                    to my books.

                                  DANNY
                    Well, Zuli and I are still around 
                    because of it.

      A pause.

                                    HARAKAT
                    Why do they think I need 
                      protection?

      He shakes his head - it s no big deal.

                                  DANNY
                    I guess it s because you were the 
                    only one who saw the hitman and he 
                    may come after you.  Probably  
                    someone s heard some chatter on the 
                    wire somewhere.

                                    HARAKAT
                    You saw him, too.

                                  DANNY
                    Maybe I need protection as well

      Danny looks at him.

                                    HARAKAT
                     But who guards the guards?  

                                  DANNY
                    I think they expect us to be able 
                    to look after ourselves.

      Ruth and Malcolm still matching the cctv and the suspects. 
      The forgery suite is dark and quiet.

      Ruth slumps back bored.

                                  RUTH

                     Don t you start,  replies the man.

      Silence.  It s a terrible joke.  Ruth laughs despite herself.

                                  RUTH

      An official-looking photograph is up on the large screen.

                                  RUTH
                    This is our main hitman suspect. 
                    His name is Sharaf Al-Youm.  He 
                    came through Heathrow on a tourist 
                    visa a few weeks ago.

      Then back to the screen.  Another CCTV image of him in the 
      bookstore.

                    These were taken a week before the

                    Who is he and why s he on the data

                                  RUTH
                    He s a big time hitman but with no 
                      particular allegiance that we know 
                    of to any of the groups or 
                    countries he s worked for.

      FLASH TO: Another black and white photo.  Here s Al Youm in 
      uniform, stands with a group of heavily armed soldiers in 
      some grim Balkan forest.  A scene instinct with atrocity.

                    This is Bosnia  96 where he spent

      Danny walks Harakat down the corridor out of the hospital.

                                  DANNY
                      Truthfully?

      Harakat laughs at this.

                                    HARAKAT

                    So then - when do you set me free?

      Danny looks at him.

                    help yourself. 

      Danny laughs.

                    Well, to me this application reads 
                    like something written by an 
                    analyst.  One of those spotty M.I.6 
                    mutants they keep in the dungeons 
                    at Vauxhall Bridge Road, beside 
                    where  C  grows his magic 
                      mushrooms. 

      Mace sighs.

                    And you re asking me to check up on 
                    whether twenty years ago some Mr

                    OK.  I ll keep it simple: you 
                    monitor both Five and Six.  So all 
                    I m asking is do you know anything 
                    about this person Harakat?

      He knows that he won t tell him. 

                                  MACE
                    Of course not.  Harry, we re on the 
                    same side. Don t you think that 
                    instead of wasting your time on 
                    this childish inter-agency rivalry 
                    you should concentrate your 
                    energies on trying to plug some of 
                    the gaps in your own security ... ?

                                  HARRY
                    Meaning what?

                                  MACE
                    As I hear it, the reason this poor 
                    chap was shot was that half of 
                    London knew Zuli s schedule. 

      Harry nods.  Fair point.

                                  HARRY
                    So there s nothing on Harakat 
                    that s not being shared.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)

      Danny watches out of the window while Harakat watches him.  
      Harakat carefully stands and joins Danny at the window.  He 
      hands him a package with the book in it.

                                    HARAKAT
                    Danny ... I want you to have this.

      Danny takes the package from him.

                                    HARAKAT
                    I m sorry for what Zuli said at the 
                    meeting.  He certainly wasn t 
                    speaking for me.  Gratitude isn t 
                    really one of his things. 

                                  DANNY
                    Clearly.

                                    HARAKAT
                    Please open it.  If you don t like 
                    it then you can give it back to me 
                    or sell it.

      Danny slides out a book.  Old faded and yellow ...

      CLOSE ON: Danny s eyes widen as he looks at the title. 

      It s a copy of the annual Cricket almanac: The Wisden.  But 
      not just any old Wisden.  It s the 1913 edition, the rarest 
                                                                                              *

                    I don t like it - I love it.  I 
                    played a lot in Islamabad, but I m

                    Path of Light.  Originated in 
                    Kashmir but now extended their 
                      operations to the whole of South 
                    East Asia, certainly one of the 
                    most vicious and bloody groups 
                    we ve dealt with.

      Colin has his magnifying glass out.

                    I think it was taken by an American 
                    spy plane.  Probably a Predator 
                    from about 25,000ft over the Middle 
                    East somewhere.  Apparently, even 
                    from that height the cameras can 
                    read the letters on the side of a 
                    can of Coke.

      Danny looks at him.

                    That it says Coke on the side?  
                    They already know that.

                                  COLIN

                    I m not saying that s what they use 
                    it for.  I m saying they could. 
                    That s its capability.

                    Or has someone left the secret

      On the SCREEN: the image of the two figures is focused and 
      enhanced.

      We can actually track round the faces in 3D.

      We see Khordad and then the other face from a few black and 
      white dots.  It turns into something recognisably human and 
      then in and out of focus until ...

      We realise that it s Oliver Mace s face looking out at us.

                    not someone I can be seen anywhere 
                    near but here s where and when you 
                    can meet her. None of it is 
                      negotiable I m afraid.  This woman 
                    is taking a tremendous risk in 
                    helping us.  If she s identified 
                    ... even suspected ...

      Adam understands the seriousness of this.

                                  ADAM
                    Who is she?

                                  HARRY
                    Let s just call her a very senior 
                      government official.  We were at 
                    Cambridge together, Trinity. 

      Adam smiles.

                                  HARRY
                    Don t let me down on this one Adam. 
                    Because afterwards I think we 
                    should talk about the future.  You 
                    and M.I.5.

      Adam knows that for him in all ways this is a big test.

      Zoe looks straight at Will who shrugs innocently.  She knows 
      that she s been set up but she s cool.

                                  ZOE
                    How kind of Will to introduce us.  
                    I knew his friends would be many 
                    and varied.

      Zoe not looking at Will now.

                                  ZOE
                    I deal mainly with re-insurance in 
                      biotechnology industries.

                                  ROBERT
                    I don t believe it.  Guess what?  I 
                    work for WRT.

      This has immediately gone further than Will intended.  He 
      looks at her offering to launch a rescue her but she s  
      unfazed for a second.

                                  ZOE
                    You re kidding.

                                  ROBERT
                    I ve been there ... this ll be my 
                    eighth year.  Before I was with

                    I know of him.  Everybody does. 

      Will watches impressed.  She just gets better.

                                  ROBERT
                    Tell me what you think of this ... 
                    I ve got a theory of how you can 
                    tell a good reinsurance agent? 

                                  ZOE
                    How?

                                  ROBERT
                    If you look in their briefcase, 
                    handbag ... whatever ... you ll 
                    always find their business card on 
                    top, ready.  I bet you re no 
                      different.

      He indicates for her to give him her bag.  But she won t.

                    Fair enough.  You open it then.

      Robert cracks up at this apparent lie.

                                  ROBERT
                    I knew re-insurance was getting 
                    dangerous but that takes the 
                    biscuit ...

      Will is seriously impressed with her performance.  Robert 
      wheels away to tell someone else what happened.

                                  ZOE
                    Do I pass?

                                  WILL
                      Frighteningly good.  Just one thing 
                    ... have you really got a gun in 
                    there?

                                  ZOE
                    If you don t believe me, have a 
                    look.

      He doesn t know whether she means it or not.

                                  WILL
                      Absolutely.  So er, you ve actually

                                  ZOE
                    Killed someone?  Oh yes.  You see 
                    at work we have a league - like a 
                    squash ladder - and I like to make 
                    sure I m always near the top.

      And for a split second he actually believes her.

      Waiting up the road for a fare is a SMALL MOUSTACHED CABBIE. 
      His on board computer doubles as an intel image receiver.  On 
      it, a series of pictures sent down the wire by Sam.  And he 
      is matching them to all the people in the street.

      BIG RON - their legendary last line of defence.

      Adam s team head past on beside his cab.  Big Ron munching on 
      a sausage sandwich sifts through the rest of the street - his 
      practised eye looking for likely candidates.  Then he spots 
      the LONE JOGGER - on the other side of the road.

      He know this is someone but just to confirm, he matches him 
      to Badly Drawn Boy.

      She stands, pausing for a moment.

                                  DEEP THROAT
                    The reason I m here ... why I 
                    passed on the photograph ... is 
                    because I disapprove of what s 
                    going on.  This is being done more 
                    for the Corporations more than for 
                    anyone else.  Their hold over our 
                    foreign policy grows by the hour. 
                    It s not something I approve of. 
                    You need to go.

      But in that moment she s the one who is gone.  As if she was 
      never there.

      Adam reaches for his phone until he remembers it won t work 
      here.


      And there are TWO MEN IN DARK COATS heading up one of the 
      paths towards him.  A WOMAN with a camera sitting on a bench. 
      Could be something.  Could be nothing.

      He gets up and heads off.

                    We had taken on a responsibility to 
                    protect Harakat.  We made a deal. 
                    If we so disapproved of him then 
                    you shouldn t have been in business 
                    with him in the first place.

                    The deal with him was superseded by 
                    another.  We gave Khordad our word 
                    as well.

      He shrugs.

                                  MACE
                    Just wait and see - who s to say 
                    that Harakat s life isn t worth all 
                    the lives that will be saved by 
                      befriending the new-improved 
                    Khordad? 

      Harry walks for a while in silence.

                                  MACE
                    If you re asking me - is there at 
                    present anything we shouldn t do to 
                    achieve our ends? Then frankly I 
                    don t know. Post 9/11 we made a 
                                                                                              *

                    don t, can t, say anymore,  This we 
                    don t do.  They do crazy a lot 
                    better than we do.  In the long 
                    term it ll be proved the right 
                    strategy.

                                  HARRY
                    Who s long term are we talking 
                    about?

                                   MACE
                    Harry, before you get on your hobby 
                    horse, think about this: do you 
                    think we did this alone, without 
                    help from Langley?

                                  HARRY
                    And that justifies it?  Part of the 
                    reason for all this trouble stems 
                    from the fact that most Americans 
                    believe anywhere East of the Hudson 
                    is like those blank spaces on 
                    medieval maps, where they drew in a 
                    monster and wrote  Here Be 
                    Dragons.

                    stay with us?  Keep his promises. 
                    As I came out I was hearing reports 
                    of some explosions in Peshawar and 
                    it looks like them - and this is 
                    with the ink barely dry on the
