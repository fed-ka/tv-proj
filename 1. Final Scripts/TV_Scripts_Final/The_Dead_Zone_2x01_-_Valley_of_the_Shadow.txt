                                    "VALLEY OF THE SHADOW"


          RECAP

          We establish the introduction of Greg Stillson, the sexual
          liaison between Johnny and Sarah, Purdy's recruitment of
          Johnny and of course, ending with Armageddon.  

                                                                                FADE TO:

                        There's no doubt in my mind that
                        Johnny Smith is the real thing...

          FADE IN:

  11CLOSE-UP - FAN MAN

          the nerdy Johnny expert from "Unreasonable Doubt" shot
          with melodramatic lighting a la a quickie segment on a
          sci fi 'reality' magazine show...

                                        FAN MAN (V.O.)
                        ...perhaps even the next link in
                        the chain of human evolution.

          Dark and suspenseful music emphasizes the statement and
          leads us into the transition as we cut to:


22LOW BUDGET DOCUMENTARY STYLE FOOTAGE

          Cleaves Mills establishing shot in sepia... push into a
          yearbook to see a school shot of Johnny Smith... close-
          ups of a lone pair of ice skates on the ice... the narrator
          is a familiar voice (i.e. Jonathan Frakes or Peter
          Graves)...  

                                        NARRATOR (TV)
                        Cleaves Mills, Maine.  The young
                        son of Vera and Herbert Smith was
                        an 'A' student... popular... and
                          a heckuva ice skater.  But it was
                          a skating accident on the
                          neighborhood ice pond that led to
                        the first chapter in the saga of
                        Johnny Smith...           DEAD ZONE: VALLEY OF THE SHADOW - TEASER - 10/4/02 - PNK   2.


  33CLOSE-UP ON A 40ISH FAT GUY

          The image slightly pixilated as we begin a slow PULL BACK.

                                        FAT GUY
                        He was out cold on the ice.  I
                        heard him say "Just leave it
                        there."  I didn't know what it
                        meant.  I had to go over to pick
                        up my hockey stick when I fell
                        through the ice.
                                (laughs, shakes his
                                head)
                          I should have left it there...
                        like Johnny said, you know?

          We now understand that this is on television... and as we
          continue the show, we see it being watched in a quick
          montage of locations --

          -- A GYM

          exercisers on machines with headphones on watching...

          -- A BOWLING ALLEY

          on a set over by the snack bar... 

          -- AN ELECTRONICS STORE

          on multiple sets... customers studying the set...

          On the TV screen: more photos of Johnny, (now Michael
          Hall) growing up (Breakfast Club age and beyond)... the
          school he went to... newspaper clippings about hockey
          heroics, science fair awards...

                                        NARRATOR (TV)
                        Johnny overcame some adolescent
                          problems at school to become a
                        leader among his fellow students. 
                        And in his junior year at Cleaves
                        Mills High, he won the Penobscot
                        County science fair with his
                        incredible fiddler crab farm
                        exhibit...


  44INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          Finding another TV set on... and DANA BRIGHT sitting on a
          desk watching, a reporter's notebook in her hand.  A
          scruffy BIKER TYPE, handcuffed to a nearby chair, watches
          as well.  A couple of deputies move about in the b.g. 
          Dana looks at the TV set evenly, with some hurt in her
          eyes... she talks aloud to herself...


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VALLEY OF THE SHADOW - TEASER - 10/4/02 - PNK   3.


    4CONTINUED:4

                                        DANA
                        The fiddler crab farm... he never
                        told me about the fiddler crab
                        farm... how could he keep that
                        from me?

                                        BIKER
                        You know the guy?

          Dana turns to him, having briefly forgotten he was there. 
          Here she is, a Friday night, having a conversation with a
          manacled dirtbag.  She smiles to herself, turns back to
          the set.

                                        DANA
                        I used to.

          Used to?   What's that all about?

                                        NARRATOR (TV)
                        And all through high school, there
                        was a girl... a pretty dark haired
                        girl named Sarah... 

          Dana's eyes narrow...


  55INT. BANNERMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Close on Johnny Junior...

                                        JOHNNY JR.
                        Hey, Mom.  It's you!

          Finding him in front of a TV set... in the background, we
          see the trappings of a campaign for Walt's re-election,
          banners, buttons, signs... Sarah moves to the set and
          it's one of those horrible moments when there is no right
          thing to do - she can't turn off the set, that would be
          too weird, and too suspicious... but her son is watching
          this stuff too... and she doesn't know what he might be
            thinking.  She settles on standing and watching next to
          JJ, an uncomfortable smile on her face, biting her lower
          lip... arms folded around her middle in protective body
          language...

          The documentary now shows Johnny and Sarah through the
          ages together... as kids, her yearbook picture in high
          school, dressed for the prom, eighties clothes at a disco
          party...






                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VALLEY OF THE SHADOW - TEASER - 9/27/02 - WHT   4.

                        Sarah Bracknell was literally the
                        girl next door... the class
                          musician who organized the school
                        talent shows... friends say they
                        were inseparable... except for a
                        brief time in ninth grade after
                        Johnny reportedly got fresh with
                        her at a local movie theater as
                        they watched "Return of the
                          Jedi"...

                                        SARAH
                                  (uncomfortable, re:
                                  pictures)
                        Where did they get all this...
                          stuff...? 

          Finding Walt's arm moving around her shoulder to see he's
          walked over to join his family... his touch cuts like a
          knife... she glances at him and smiles, embarrassed for
          them all... their eyes turn back to the TV set...


  66INT. BRUCE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

          The TV set is on here now too. 

                                        NARRATOR (TV) (CONT'D)
                        But the fight didn't last long
                        and the young couple soon were
                        seen holding hands together
                          again... it would take a tragic
                        turn of events to rip those hands
                          apart...

          The picture shows stock footage of lightning and rain and
            a subjective view through windshield wipers... grim music
          presages what's going to happen...

                                        BRUCE'S DATE (O.S.)
                        What's he really like?

          Moving back to see Bruce's apartment for the first time,
          modest, comfortable with eastern cultural touches...
          finding Bruce on the couch with a very affectionate girl
            snuggling up against him... in fact, we may be surprised
          to see that it's the same volunteer girl KATIE we saw
          screwing Greg Stillson... and we might wonder if she's
          here as a true date or as some kind of spy...

                                all this)
                        I'll tell you what he's not. 
                        He's not the next link in the
                          evolutionary chain.  He's... just
                        a guy.  Just Johnny Smith.  

          He watches the TV set with disdain, worried about Johnny...

                                        KATIE
                        I'd like to meet him sometime. 
                        You think he might, you know...

                                        BRUCE
                                (teasing)
                        Touch you?  What man wouldn't?

                                (smiles)
                        I'm serious.

                                (beat, grim)
                        Johnny isn't telling fortunes
                        these days.

          'Not telling fortunes these days'?  What the hell that is
          all about...

                        Smith leaves Sarah and is on his
                        way to the video store in the
                        near-by township of Lagrange.  A
                        truck driver named Gus Bell is on
                        Route 6 that night as well... he
                        has been driving all day...

          The set pushes in on a family snapshot of the truck
            driver...

                          awake...


  77INT. STILLSON'S CAMPAIGN BUS - THE TV

          is on there too... now showing news footage of the
            aftermath of the accident... the car being towed back up
          in the road as we saw in Destiny... Purdy's interview
          starts voice over and then cuts to on camera...

                          mother... I rushed Vera to the
                          hospital... Sarah, Johnny's
                          fianc e, was there...  Vera and

                        And then of course, the doctor
                        came out and told us the news...
                        that... that Johnny was in a
                        coma...

                        That is one odd couple: Gene Purdy
                        and his freak of nature...

                        That freak of nature is going
                        around asking questions about
                        you.

          Stillson reacts...

                        six years...

  99INT. SMITH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Another TV is on, but this time the couch is empty.  No
          one's watching.

                          Meanwhile the world kept
                          spinning... his mother would pass
                        away... Sarah would marry the
                        county sheriff Walter T. Bannerman
                        and have a child... and then the
                        impossible happened...  

                                        ELAINE (TV)
                        I was about to give him his sponge
                        bath like I did every morning... 
                        except this time, he suddenly
                        grabbed my arm and yelled
                          'Something's wrong!"...

          Photos of the house on fire and the rescue of the little
          girl appear on the documentary...  Camera scopes the
          unfinished CHESS GAME on Johnny's coffee table, next to
          an UNFINISHED MEAL, then moves on, finding a DOOR we've
          never seen before, a stairway leading down.

                        He said my house was on fire...
                        and my little girl...
                                (emotional beat)
                        I owe her life to him... I thank
                        God for Johnny Smith...

                        But that was only the beginning...

          The sound fades as we descend into --


  1010INT. SMITH HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

          Old furniture and clutter dating back fifty years has
          been augmented by several new computer boxes.  A DSL cable
          snakes to a flatscreen monitor, on which JOHNNY is studying
          an old newspaper story about Stillson with the headline,
            "Improprieties Alleged in Shady Pines Deal."

          The story spits out of a printer, and Johnny takes it to
          a BIG BULLETIN BOARD.  About a third is covered with
          material on Stillson; less on Purdy.










                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VALLEY OF THE SHADOW - TEASER - 9/30/02 - BLU   8.


    10CONTINUED:10

          Alone in the center:  an aerial shot of the Washington
            Monument.

          Johnny eyes the board for a beat as he sifts through a
          BOX of brightly colored PLASTIC PUSH PINS.  He chooses a
          red one, then tacks the printout to the board as the SOUND
          of the TV show FADES UP, taking us to our final stop:


  1111INT. A SMALL DARK ROOM - CLOSE ON A PORTABLE B&W TV/VCR

          Plugged into an AC jack.  On the screen, reporters chase
          after Johnny in the aftermath of the "Quality of Life"
          episode...

                                        NARRATOR (TV)
                        As he performed one amazing feat
                        after another, his reputation
                        grew... and so did the number of
                        his detractors...

          The TV sits on a workbench beside a mess of electronic
          components.  A man is putting items in a backpack.  At
          first, we don't see his face, just his gloved hands and
          the items:  GLASS CUTTERS, a roll of DUCT TAPE, a STUN
          GUN.  But as he checks the charge on this last item before
          zipping the bag... we can see his face is covered with a
          sheer stocking type mask...

          On the TV, real-life psychic debunker, JAMES RANDI,
          appears...

                                        JAMES RANDI (TV)
                        Johnny Smith is no different than
                        any of the other charlatans who
                          hoodwink and take advantage of
                        people.  I've publicly challenged
                        him to prove his powers and haven't
                        heard back.  I'm not surprised.

                        Coming up: Johnny Smith predicts
                          a deadly fire at a high school
                        graduation party... and some pay
                        the price for not believing...

          A title card with a dramatic picture of Johnny holds the
          frame for a beat... the man's gloved fingertip brushes
          Johnny's face, then turns off the set.  We hear a metal
          door open and close, as the room rocks slightly, and we
          realize this little workshop is in the back of a van. 
          Then all is quiet.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

  1212INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY - AN ELECTRONIC SCOREBOARD

          Displays "Meet the Candidates Day" as balloons float by. 
          TILT DOWN to find a familiar small-town event underway: 
          part campaign rally, part Fourth of July picnic.

          Camera sketches the scene:  giggling LITTLE GIRLS painting
          flags on each other's cheeks... a TRIO of wizened WWII
          VETS, in full VFW regalia, parlaying with TWO VIETNAM
          VETS in faded fatigue jackets... a high school guy flirting
          with a pretty volunteer... a HEFTY MAN toting a plate
          loaded with fried chicken.  Over which, we hear:

                                        STILLSON (LOUD SPEAKER)
                        Washington has become a town of
                        shell games and spin doctors who
                        shoot off fireworks but don't
                        ever get anything done.  We need
                        action.  We need more jobs.  We
                        need better education.  We need a
                        system of justice that will not
                        fail the people.  We need God
                        back in the pledge of allegiance.  

          A huge cheer erupts... finding Greg Stillson at a podium...

                                        STILLSON
                        We've got to put the country back
                        in the hands of the people.  In
                        plain Maine speaking, it's time
                        to take out the trash.

          Sarah is standing near the stage holding a CLIPBOARD, a
          "Bannerman for Sheriff" button on her blouse... she watches
            Stillson, carefully listening... and she reacts to the
            overwhelming enthusiasm of the crowd... turns and notices --


          ANGLE - FAVORING HER POV OF JOHNNY

          in his dark coat, standing at the back of the crowd,
          studying the candidate... his eyes meet hers briefly...
          but Sarah deliberately breaks eye contact without
            acknowledgement, there's a definite chill between them,
          and she turns back to the speech...

                                        STILLSON
                        I love this country.  I trust the
                          God-fearing people of this country.

                        We know the principles on which
                        this country was founded and we're
                        sick and tired of those principles
                        being violated by the guys with
                        the hundred dollar haircuts in
                          Washington... who don't fear God...
                        who don't fear anyone...

          More cheers... and finding Bruce moving up behind Johnny... 

                                        STILLSON (CONT'D)
                        Well, they better fear Greg
                          Stillson because the day of
                          reckoning is near... Greg Stillson
                        is coming to Washington.

          As Stillson continues...

                                        BRUCE
                        How did I know I was gonna find
                        you here?

          Johnny looks around...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, Bruce.

                                        STILLSON
                        You and me, we own this country. 
                        It belongs to us.  It's time to
                        take it back!  My name is Greg
                          Stillson and I hope you'll send
                        me to Congress.

          The cheers swell and Stillson waves and takes it in for a
            moment... he does not see Johnny. 

                                        BRUCE
                        You understand you're turning
                        into a regular stalker?

          Johnny just watches Stillson taking his bows...

                                        BRUCE
                        You're giving up your life for
                        this thing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This 'thing' has a fairly high
                          priority, don't you think?

                                        BRUCE
                        I just don't like what it's doing
                        to you.   

                                        JOHNNY
                                (quietly)
                        I'm fine. 

                                        BOY
                          Johnny... catch!

          Johnny turns to see a boy about thirteen passing him a
            basketball... he catches it in mid-turn...

                                        BOY
                        Our team's playing Brewer tomorrow. 
                        Can you tell who's gonna win?

          Johnny grins at the kid, rubs the basketball like a crystal
          ball... takes a beat...

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  And I wouldn't tell you if I
                        could.

          Then passes it back...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good luck.

                                        BOY
                                (smiles)
                        Thanks, Johnny.

          Johnny smiles... but Bruce studies him seriously... Johnny
          looks at him, holds a poker face to hide whatever it is
          he's feeling...

                                        BRUCE
                                (pointed)
                        Yeah.  You're fine.


          ANGLE ON STILLSON

          moving off the stage... shaking some hands of his
            entourage... including Katie, the volunteer girl we saw
          with Bruce... they're telling him what a great speech it
          was, they love you, Greg, great going.  Stillson has heard
          all that before from these people so he naturally turns
          to someone he hasn't heard it from before - the attractive
          young woman with the Bannerman button...

                        What'd you think?

                                        SARAH
                                (smiles)
                        Great response from the crowd.

                                        STILLSON
                                (smiles)
                        That's not what I asked; come on,
                        let's hear it... 

          Easily and straightforward... she holds his eyes without
          fear... this is a straight-talking Maine woman, friendly
          but clear:

                                        SARAH
                        I think this routine plays well
                        for maybe a month or two and then
                        you're in trouble if you don't
                        come up with some real issues to
                        hang your hat on.  I know these
                        people, they're my neighbors...
                        they'll cheer for apple pie and
                        the American flag in your
                          speeches... but they won't vote
                        for you come election day unless
                        you really have something to say...
                        and so far you don't.

          Stillson is a good enough politician to maintain his
          smile...

                                        STILLSON
                        Ouch.

          Stillson's entourage is offended, try to move their
            candidate out of this embarrassing situation...

                                        SONNY
                        Come on, Greg...

          But he shrugs them off...

                                        STILLSON
                        Bannerman?

                        You bet.  He must be some

                        Yeah.  He is.  And he's my husband.

          Got it, Stillson says to himself.

                                        STILLSON
                        See you on the campaign trail.

          Now he lets them move him away... he looks very seriously
          at Sonny on the move...

                                        STILLSON
                        Find out more about her.

                                        SONNY
                        Greg, she's the sheriff's wife...
                        this is one broad you don't give
                        your hotel key to...

                                        STILLSON
                        Find out more about her.

          As Greg shakes a few hands, then a new hand grasps his
          and Stillson looks up to see it belongs to Johnny...

                                        STILLSON
                                (reacts)
                        We meet again.

                                  connected)
                        How's my future look these days?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not always so easy to tell.

          Stillson breaks the handshake...

                                        STILLSON
                                (blowing him off)
                        Well, you just keep looking and
                        be sure to tell me if you see
                          anything interesting.

          Pats him patronizingly on his shoulder... moves away...
          and we may begin to realize that we haven't seen any
          visions from Johnny... Johnny glances at the hand that
          just shook hands with Stillson, then casually flexes it
          once...

                        eat food sometimes, maybe see a

                        Come on, as a favor to me... Katie
                        wants to meet you... and I know a

                        I don't exactly remember but I

                        it was, it wasn't good.    

          Johnny picks up the phone.

1515A HELICOPTER DESCENDING - DAY - EXT. MARKOFF ESTATE

          and as it comes down, we reveal the incredible estate -  
          a small group of reporters and photographers have started
          to arrive at the scene... there are several police officers
          and cars visible as well...

          Purdy is the first one out of the chopper, ducking down
          below the rotors, followed by Johnny... and this almost
          feels like newsreel-style footage...

          Purdy shakes hands with a couple of PUBLIC RELATIONS
          persons who work for the Markoffs... Purdy intros Johnny
          in a scene we cannot hear due to the rotor blades noise... 
          Johnny looks tight somehow, some uncertainty in his eyes...

          They move toward the house....

          Finding Walt observing as Johnny approaches...

                                        WALT
                        I'm glad you're here.

          Johnny just nods and follows the lead of the family reps
          toward the house... as he passes the reporters waiting
          outside, start snapping his picture, turning video cameras

          among them... she throws him a half-grin of hello which
          he returns... and we can sense he's uncomfortable...


  1616INT. MARKOFF HOUSE - LIBRARY - DAY

          One man's tasteful shrine to himself, and to capital. 
          There's a goodly number of books, but what catches the
          eye are some celebrity photos -- Arthur Markoff posing
          with President Reagan, with Ted Turner (or Alan Greenspan,
          or one or both Bushes) -- and a framed Fortune magazine
          cover photo of Markoff with the title:  "The Lion of Wall
          Street."  There may be other icons of capitalism:  an
          antique stock ticker, for example.

          On a desk, a slick management philosophy book with another
          picture of Markoff on the cover sits next to a framed
          picture of Markoff posing with his family: his wife and
          young CHRISTOPHER, six...

                                        PURDY (O.S.)
                        He's been called the 'CEO of the
                        New Millenium.'  One of the few,
                        I might add, who managed to survive
                        the recent Wall Street scandals
                        relatively unscathed.   

          Finding Purdy admiring one of the displays...

                                        PURDY
                        Most people have no idea what a
                          philanthropist Arthur is... and
                        that's the way he wants it.  
                        He's always been an extremely
                        private man.  That's why he moved
                        his family up here.    

          Purdy sighs and tries to maintain his composure... the
          door opens... and Arthur enters... moving to him --

                                        PURDY
                        Arthur...!

                                        ARTHUR
                        I'm sorry to keep you waiting...
                        I was with my wife...

          Purdy embraces him, holds him... Arthur (40s) is tall and
          slender.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VALLEY OF THE SHADOW - ACT ONE - 10/7/02 YEL   17A.

          He's normally a brusque man, used to getting his way and
          unused to personal suffering.  Right now he's almost
          numb...

                                        PURDY
                        How is Connie holding up?

          And no one really knows what to say in a moment like this,
          even Purdy... it's surreal... a child has been taken, how

          can we be here talking...?  Arthur looks over Purdy's
          shoulder at Johnny... who nods to him...

                        They have her sedated.
                                (moving to Johnny)
                        I'm Arthur Markoff.

                        John Smith, sir.

          Markoff shakes his hand... looks at him evenly... a hint
          of skepticism in his eyes...

                                        PURDY
                        This is the young man I spoke to
                        you about.

                                        MARKOFF
                        Yes.  My wife will be pleased
                        when I tell her you've come.  She
                          believes in some... things...
                        that I don't necessarily agree
                        with her about.  But at a time
                        like this...

                                        PURDY
                        Of course...

                                        MARKOFF
                        She saw something about you on
                        television last night... she says
                        you've helped the police before...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've tried, sir.  I can't say it
                          always...

                                        PURDY
                        I've seen Johnny do some remarkable
                        things, Arthur.  I truly believe
                        he's doing God's work.

                                (evenly, to Purdy)
                        What kind of God allows a child
                        to be taken from his family?

          That effectively ends the conversation...

                        I'll show you where he broke into
                        the house.


  1717INT. HALLWAY/STAIRS AS NEEDED

          Markoff leading the way past police officials... including
          Walt who is talking to a black woman in a business suit
          with an FBI ID clipped to her breast pocket:  This is
          Special Agent GODDARD, a veteran with wary eyes and a
          deadpan manner.

                                        MARKOFF
                        The police say the alarm system
                        was disabled... obviously whoever
                        did this knew what they were
                          doing... we haven't received a
                        ransom note or any other form of
                          communication from the kidnappers
                        yet...

          As they move out the back door...

                                        GODDARD
                          A little early in the process to
                        be bringing in the lunatic fringe,
                        isn't it...

                                        WALT
                        Watch and learn.

          The FBI agent cocks an eyebrow and follows Walt outside...


  1818EXT. MARKOFF HOUSE - DAY

          And the following sequence is done without dialogue...

          Johnny crouches by a cracked circle of glass that was cut
          out of a nearby sliding glass door.  There's an expectant
          hush broken only by the clicking of camera shutters.

                                                                            INTERCUTTING:

          APPEAR AS 'LIVE' VIDEO)...

          Here he is again, the one and only Johnny Smith, front
          and center, and the whole world is watching... 


          EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF JOHNNY'S EYES

          and there's something in there we haven't seen before...
          you might almost call it fear... but fear of what?


          WIDER

          Johnny hesitates a beat, then touches the glass.  More
          furious clicks.


          EYES - VARIOUS

          watching... Walt, Goddard, Dana, Purdy, Markoff... all
          watching --


          JOHNNY

          who moves to the door itself, the edges of the cut-out
          bearing the remnants of fingerprint dust.  He touches
          that, then the door handle.

          And we may expect to ramp in, see a flash, anything, this
          is the Dead Zone after all, isn't it...

          But we don't... instead we begin a slow pull back... and
          dissolve to wider angle... and dissolve to a wider angle
          still as Johnny gets smaller and smaller in our frame...
          as Johnny moves to examine the soft ground and reaches
          out to touch it...

          And our pull back is so wide now that we can barely even
          see Johnny Smith any more...


  1919EXT. SMITH HOUSE - NIGHT

          The Purdy limo pulls into Johnny's driveway... and Johnny
          gets out...

                        You tried - that's all anyone can
                        ask of you.  We'll write a release
                          reminding everyone that your gift

                        Nothing to be worried about.

          But Purdy's words can't mask a basic disappointment and a
          touch of personal embarrassment...

          He signals the driver to leave... and Johnny closes the
          door... stands there a beat as the car exits...


  2020INT. SMITH HOUSE - NIGHT

          The phone is ringing as he enters the dark house... he
          doesn't stop to turn on the lights...

          Sarah opens the door to find Johnny standing there... wet
          from the drizzling rain... there is a tension that always
          underlines their scenes together now...

                        I'm sorry to bother you, Sarah.

          as Sarah and Johnny enter... campaign stuff scattered
          around, Walt and little Johnny are at the table eating...
          she sits and begins to eat... and perhaps it's just a bit
          odd that Sarah doesn't invite Johnny to join them...

                        Hi.  Hey, Johnny.

          The kid looks up at him, not at all pleased to see this
          man, who once 'held hands with his mother', in his house. 
          Doesn't reply to Johnny's greeting.

                        Stop playing with your pasta and
                        put some in your mouth.

          And we can feel as Johnny stands and they sit at the family
          table, how separated he is.

                        Thanks.  No.  I... need to go
                        back out to the Markoff place.  I
                        heard from the guy.

          Walt reacts, rises without hesitation.  As Sarah's eyes
            narrow...

                          Message.  What kind of message.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  He said I should
                        have been able to find it.  As if
                        this were all some kind of test...

                        You'll pass it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt, I haven't had a vision in
                        weeks.

          Walt reacts...

                        What happened?  You hit your head
                        again or...?

                                        JOHNNY

                        Maybe it just means, you know,
                        you're recovering, getting back
                        to normal...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.  Normal.  Whatever that is.

                        It could be a good thing.  In any

                        I never asked for this.  I never
                        wanted this.  And if it never

  2525EXT. MARKOFF HOUSE - NIGHT

          Thunder rumbles as the rain comes down harder... several
          police cars remain parked in front of the estate...
            reporters huddle in media vehicles to stay warm... it now
          has all the markings of a major crime scene...


  2626INT. MARKOFF HOUSE - NIGHT

          The storm building outside.  Moving with Arthur Markoff,
          Agent Goddard and Walt and Johnny... Johnny is doing his
          thing, touching things randomly, trying to get some
          reading... Markoff, who didn't believe much in Johnny to
          start with, now is beginning to be extremely dubious about
          him... this may be one "ER" type steadicam shot... that
          starts in Christopher's bedroom and then moves into halls
          and other rooms...

                                        MARKOFF
                        He didn't ask for money?... I
                        don't understand... kidnappers
                        want money...

                                        WALT
                        Apparently not this one.

                                        MARKOFF
                        This... this doesn't make any
                        sense to me.  Why did he call you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I wish I knew the answer to that,
                        sir.

          Their eyes meet for a moment before Johnny, failing to
          get any visions, takes one last look at the room...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry; I just don't sense
                          anything here.

          Thunder rumbles outside.  Johnny moves out of the bedroom
          into the hall... and this is just insanity to Markoff... 

                                        MARKOFF
                                (to Goddard)
                        May I... I speak to you?

          Johnny is moving down the hall in the background as we
          hang back with Goddard, Walt and Markoff...

                                        MARKOFF
                                (sotto, but seething)
                        I want this man out of my house...

                        Did you believe him?  

                                        WALT
                        Why would he make up something
                        like...

                        ...I can think of several
                        reasons... the least of which is
                          self-promotion... the worst of
                        which is that he's involved in
                        the kidnapping himself...

          Walt gives her a look... you've got to be kidding...

                                        MARKOFF
                        Kidnappers demand ransom money. 
                        That's how it works.  The idea
                        that someone would use my son
                        to... to... get some so-called
                          psychic's attention...

                                        WALT
                        I can vouch for Johnny Smith.

                                        MARKOFF
                        I think he's dangerous.  And I
                        don't want him here.

          In the background, Johnny has been touching walls and
          pictures... not getting anything... has moved into a den
          now... as we continue our shot as we follow Walt who leads
          Markoff and Goddard take us into this room...

          This is Mrs. Markoff's private study... although we don't
          need to know this explicitly, she's an editor of books,
          some spiritual and new age in nature... and although it
          is handsomely decorated and neat, there are some
          manuscripts on a desk... and what's more important is the
          decor - artwork, knick-knacks and such - reflects her
            interests including... a large painting - or perhaps a
          huge avante garde poster of a Madonna art exhibition at a
          museum - the key is the Mother and Child context... for
          the moment, we only notice it in the background...

          Johnny is already exploring the room when the others come
          in... Markoff getting more agitated...

                                        MARKOFF
                                  (impatient, to Johnny)
                        This is my wife's study... there
                        is no evidence the kidnappers
                        came anywhere near this part of
                        the house...

          Walt puts his hand on Johnny's shoulder, everything
          FREEZES... it's Walt's touch that breaks through the ice...
          and as Johnny feels the jolt...

          We begin a 360 move around them... moving quite fast,
          this doesn't last long... maybe even going around twice
          in a dizzying effect... and somehow Sarah and Little Johnny

          Thunder crashes outside.  Our score is a collision of
            voices... perhaps recalling the monolith sound of 2001...

          ANGLE - THE PAINTING

          the face of a masked man, his mouth opening in a silent
          scream, PUSHES OUT of the canvas, like Hans Solo's tortured
          features jutting out of the carbonite...

          pulling a gloved hand away from the painting, until we

          mask over his face in a split reality -- Walt et al
            incongruously watching this with modest curiosity... and
          the voices are almost deafening now as we ramp to Johnny's
          face... as Johnny's mouth opens under the mask in a silent
            scream...

          He's prepared to throw Johnny out himself if he has to...
          and he moves toward Johnny... but as he does, Johnny rises
          and grabs the poster and lifts it off the wall...

          Behind it, taped to the wall is a white piece of paper...

            A classic "cut-out-letter" ransom note... only this one's
          apparently been scanned and then turned into a COLOR PRINT-

                        The fingerprints aren't his.  He
                        never touched the page.

                                        GODDARD
                        He had to touch the page.

          Johnny just shakes his head.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He knew it would be too easy for
                        me.  He even scanned the original
                        note, then e-mailed the file to a
                        copy store and had them print it
                        up.  That way he wouldn't have
                          physical contact with it during
                        the printing process.

                                        GODDARD
                        He had to touch the page because
                        he had to stick it on the goddamned
                        wall.

          Deputy ROSCOE calls over from a desk.

                                        ROSCOE
                        Bruce Lewis on four for Mr. Smith. 
                        He says it's important.

          Walt presses the button to get the right extension for
          Johnny and hands him the phone but the moment he touches
          it, Johnny reacts.  Covers the mouth piece.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not Bruce.

          Walt reacts and moves into action to trace the call...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello.

          Close on the kidnapper's mouth, perhaps a little looser
          than the last time.

                        You had Christopher do it.

                                        KIDNAPPER
                        You are back on your game. 
                            Congratulations.  He was really
                        quite brave last night, under the
                        most difficult of circumstances. 
                        But he's starting to get a little
                          worried.  Now that the air is
                        running out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If you want me to find him, then
                        you need to give more
                          information...

                                        KIDNAPPER
                        You have everything you need to
                        find him, Johnny.  You're just
                        not seeing it yet but you will. 
                        Say hello to Walt, I assume he's
                        tracing the call... but since I'm
                        forwarding this through a phone
                        bank, I imagine we have some time
                        to talk.  I think it's swell that
                        you and Walt and Sarah can all be
                        friends... and they even named
                        their boy after you... it is their
                        boy, isn't it, Johnny because
                        I've wondered about that... I've
                        looked at the dates and they don't
                        exactly work out...

          Johnny and Walt exchange a serious glance...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Listen to me, carefully.  I promise
                        you if you go anywhere near Johnny
                          Bannerman...

                        Don't you think I could have done
                        that?  It would have been so easy.
                                (beat)
                        But I would never do that to you.

          is picking up his morning paper as Walt drives up in the
          patrol car...

                                        WALT
                        Come on... we've got a lead from
                        the copy shop...

          Johnny gets in the patrol car...


  4040INT. PATROL CAR - CONTINUOUS - MOVING

                                        WALT
                        You were right.  As usual.  The
                        message was e-mailed to the shop
                        with instructions to mail to a
                        post office box.  E-mail and P.O.
                        box both belong to a Mr.
                          Nebuchadnezzar... that's from the
                        bible, right?

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (acknowledges, mind

                        furnace where the angel protected
                        them, am I right?  What were their
                        names?

          Johnny's mind is working, trying to piece these clues
          together... he just shakes his head at Walt's question,
          not remembering... 

                                        WALT
                        Anyway, Mr. Nebuchadnezzar paid
                        for the transaction with a stolen
                        credit card... we know who it was

  4242INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

          MRS. CAHILL, 35, a wife and mother... leads Johnny, Goddard
          and Walt inside... walls have been stripped of paint to
          show original brick and plaster.  The furniture's covered
          with sheets, giving everything a ghostly appearance...
          this is still a house that people are living in, however,
          so the remodeling should be limited...

                                        MRS. CAHILL
                        I'm sorry for the mess... this
                        has been going on for months now...

                        Mrs. Cahill, do you have any idea
                        where you might have been when
                        your credit card was stolen...

                                        MRS. CAHILL
                          I thought I'd left it at a
                          restaurant... but they couldn't
                        find it when I called...

          As the interview continues... we move in on Johnny... and
          the house itself is giving him a feeling... we may focus
          on his feet for a moment if we really need to establish a
          physical connection... and we may reprise the cascading
          voices we heard when Johnny looked at the Madonna
          painting...

                        What was the name of that
                          restaurant?

          Johnny moves away from the others... almost as though
          drawn by the voices...

                          employees...

                                        MRS. CAHILL (O.S.)
                        You really believe someone there
                        might have been involved in this
                          terrible kidnapping...?

                        How awful...

          The sound of the conversation has faded as Johnny has
          moved further away... and the cascading voices increase...
          Johnny comes to a door that's closed... reaches out and
          touches it...

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is John Smith.

                                                                            INTERCUTTING:


  4848INT. INDUSTRIAL SPACE - KIDNAPPER

          Just a little wider each time.

                                        KIDNAPPER
                        You'll always be Johnny to me. 
                        So what do you think, of the house
                        I mean.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know it used to be yours.

                                        KIDNAPPER
                        Can you believe what those people*
                        are doing to my house... I think
                        they want to live in an old Pottery
                        Barn catelogue full of 
                        plaids, ducks and pineapples...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've seen what happened to you
                        when you were child here...

                                        KIDNAPPER
                        Well, of course, that's why I've
                        brought you there, Johnny.  I
                        want you to know.  I want you to
                        know me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then meet me somewhere.  Let's
                        talk.  

                                        KIDNAPPER
                        Soon, Johnny.  You're very close
                        now.  Just a hop, skip, jump away. 
                        Unless you stumble.
                                (beat)
                        Dear God, I hate that house.

          Click; he hangs up.  End Intercut.  Johnny's gaze moves
          around the house looking for some clue...

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's been here.  And not long
                        ago.

                                        MRS. CAHILL
                        In my house?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He's seen the renovations.

                                        WALT
                        Maybe that's when he took the
                        credit card -- when he was here.

          And now through the partly knocked-down wall, Johnny sees
            something odd:  a WALL in the adjoining room that's been
          freshly painted white, beckoning like a blank canvas. 
          Johnny approaches, and finds a can of paint, the sides
            spattered bright red, on the floor beside it.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VALLEY OF THE SHADOW - ACT THREE - 10/4/02 - PNK   40.


    48CONTINUED: (2)48

            A red-encrusted brush lies on the can.  He picks it up
          and we turn 180 degrees as he becomes...


4949A WORKMAN IN COVERALLS - VISION

          His face obscured by a dust mask.  In a split reality,
          Walt, Goddard and the woman observe.  Johnny/Kidnapper
          raises a roller brush...


          NEW ANGLE - PAST JOHNNY/KIDNAPPER

          as he moves in REVERSE MOTION using a power roller brush
          to UNPAINT the wall, (Walt, Goddard and the woman are not
          in shot).  And as the white comes off, three strange NAMES
          painted in RED are revealed beneath it:  SHADRACH... 
          MESHACH... ABEDNEGO.  The vision ends but as we cut back
          to...


  5050JOHNNY - REAL TIME

          He's staring at the blank wall, still holding the brush...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Shadrach, Mesach, Abednego...

                                        WALT
                                (recalling the early
                                  conversation)
                        Right.  The fiery furnace.

          But why the hell are you bringing that up now, his eyes
          ask.  Johnny turns to Walt, Goddard and the woman - and
          sees the trio of them waiting for him to explain... a
          frightening realization dawning...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is anyone else in the house?

                                        MRS. CAHILL
                                (baffled)
                        No...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (calm but urgent)
                        We have to leave.  We have to
                        leave now.

          They're confused but he urges them to move... and they do
          just as...          DEAD ZONE: VALLEY OF THE SHADOW - ACT THREE - 10/7/02 YEL   41.


  5151NEW ANGLE - SLOW MOTION - AS THREE INCENDIARY DEVICES
          DETONATE

          in rapid succession... all around them... and indeed,
          they are in the fiery furnace... as they run for their
          lives outside...


  5252EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - SLOW MOTION

          They run out, helping the poor woman who is losing her
          home... moving safely away from the house just as it erupts
          in flames and explodes in a million pieces... 

                                                                    SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


  5353EXT.  MARKOFF ESTATE - DAY - A NEWS CONFERENCE

          An outdoor, quickly organized conference... the reporters
          and photographers stand pretty much where they were
          standing when we first saw them at the top of the show,
          though there are more of them now... there's a news
          coverage quality to this footage... as though we're one
          of the stations covering this story... Purdy, Arthur
          Markoff and Agent Goddard stand behind Johnny at a
            podium... looking like a man unused to being on
            television... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not really comfortable with
                        all this... I've never spoken in
                          a public forum like this before...
                        but today, I have no choice. 
                        Because I need to make an appeal
                        to the kidnapper of Christopher
                        Markoff...


  5454INT. INDUSTRIAL SPACE - DAY

          TV tuned to the press conference...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (beat, to the camera)
                        ...an appeal that it's time to
                        let the boy go.  There has been
                        enough pain and suffering for
                          everyone involved in this including
                        you...

          Unhappy, the kidnapper rises, crosses the room (so we can
          see it clearly) and turns off the set.  He paces...          DEAD ZONE: VALLEY OF THE SHADOW - ACT THREE - 10/7/02 YEL   42.


  5555RESUME NEWS CONFERENCE

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't believe you really want
                        to hurt Christopher.  Not after
                        what you went through yourself
                        when you were his age.  I'm willing
                        to meet you anywhere you wish...
                          whenever you say... to arrange
                        for the boy's release.

          That's the end of his statement... the reporters hands
          fly up with questions... Johnny... Johnny... are you sure
          the boy is still alive... can you describe the kidnapper's
          voice to us?  And finally...

                                        REPORTER
                        Do you feel responsible for this,
                        Johnny?

                                        PURDY
                                (interceding)
                        Johnny didn't kidnap this boy. 
                        But he is trying to get him back,
                        and at considerable risk to his
                        own safety.

          Moving to pull an uncomfortable Johnny away from the podium
          but the reporter won't drop it...

                                        REPORTER
                        This guy is obviously obsessed
                        with you... maybe he took the boy
                        because he wanted to get your
                          attention... 

          Johnny has wondered about this already of course but it
          wounds anyway and it's painful being up here in front of
          all these reporters to start with...

                                        REPORTER
                        Do you blame Johnny Smith, Mr.
                          Markoff?

          Markoff just ignores the question, turns toward the house. 
          The reporters pile on Johnny... with questions like "How
          does that make you feel?"  "Why can't you see where the
          boy is right now?"  "Why do you think the kidnapper is so
          interested in you?"  "Can you explain how your powers
          work?"

          The camera moves to the back of the pack to see Dana
          watching with sad eyes as the wolves attack... Bruce moves
          up beside her... concerned...

                                        BRUCE
                        A month ago, he was their hero. 
                        Now they can't wait to tear him
                        down.

                                        DANA
                        He's still their hero.  You should
                        see how they treat their enemies. 
                                (beat, considering
                                his arrival)
                        What brings you to the wars?

                                        BRUCE
                                (shrugs, the question
                                is also the answer)
                        The wars.

          He watches Johnny being escorted by Purdy toward the house,
            reporters still yelling...

                                        BRUCE
                        You know someday they really are
                        gonna try to destroy him.

                                        DANA
                        And you want to be there.  To
                        fight the good fight.

                                        BRUCE
                        My daddy taught me it's all we
                        can do in this life.  

                                        DANA
                        Call me if you ever need
                          reinforcements.

          Bruce looks at Dana and they smile, understanding they
          both care about Johnny a great deal...

                                        BRUCE
                        I will.


  5656INT. MARKOFF HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          As Purdy and Johnny enter... the phone is ringing... FBI
          and local officers are present... but Walt and Goddard
          are not there.







                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: VALLEY OF THE SHADOW - ACT THREE - 10/7/02 YEL   44.


    56CONTINUED:56

          Markoff glances at Johnny, answers the phone.

                                        MARKOFF
                        Hello.

          His face is grim as he nods to Johnny, it's him...

                                        MARKOFF
                        Yes.  He's right here.

          ...and hands off the phone.  Johnny takes a beat and
            considers what his role in the scenario is because,
          although we don't know it yet, that's what this... a plan
          that is going exactly as they expected it to...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello?

                                                                            INTERCUTTING:


  5757CLOSEUP ON THE KIDNAPPER

          Close enough so we can't see the background of the room
          he's in.

                                        KIDNAPPER
                        You talk to me on television?  On
                          television?  You've... you've
                        turned this into another reality
                        show... Big Brother Forty-Seven...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You made it clear his air was
                        running out and...

                                        KIDNAPPER
                        This was Purdy's idea, wasn't
                        it...

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, it was mine...

                                        KIDNAPPER
                        Well, it was a bad one.  I am
                          offended.  And disappointed in
                        you.  All those reporters -- 
                        locusts... with the "hair of women
                        and the teeth of lions."  That
                        Dana Bright is using you... just
                        like the others... to advance her
                          career...

          Johnny enters as now we see more of this commercial space,
          filled with partly assembled computers and other techno-
          gear common to start-up companies, as well as a mattress,
          hot plate, and scattered clothes.  The room's being worked

          Johnny's eyes move across the room...  They come to a
          photograph of the kidnapper with an elderly woman, his
            mother... she smiles sweetly, he's more even-faced...

          as the one at the Markoff house.  Only this one's an
            original, no computer printout.  It reads:

          then presses an ear to his chest... lays him flat on his
          back and urgently starts CPR... opening the boy's mouth,
          pinching his nose closed, and leaning down to give him
          two quick mouth-to-mouth breaths.  Checks him again, and
          then a third breath.

          The boy gasps and starts to breath shallowly.  A little
          color returns to his cheeks but he remains unconscious.

                        out before too long.  I just wanted

                        Why are we here, Francis?

          Francis studies Johnny with awe... damn, he's here...
          this couldn't be more perfect...

                                        FRANCIS
                        We put our trust in false gods,
                        bowed down before new golden idols. 
                        We have broken our contract with
                        God just like the people did in
                        ancient Judah...

                                        JOHNNY
                        And when they did, God sent
                          Nebuchadnezzar to punish them.

                                        FRANCIS
                        But God also sent Daniel, Johnny. 
                        He also sent the prophet.

          There, he's put it right on the table.  It couldn't be
          clearer.  He smiles to Johnny: you can see it now, can't
          you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can't speak for you but I'm no

                        Sure, you are.  You proved it...

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                        I had a psychic vision.  That's
                        all.

          Francis considers Johnny incredulously: why doesn't he
          get it?  Then shrugs, whatever...

                                        FRANCIS
                        That's okay, I'm sure enough for
                        both of us.

                        It's refreshing to encounter a
                        modest messenger from God for a
                        change.  They always seem to talk
                        in declarative sentences in the
                          scriptures.  With exclamation
                        points.  A very wise man once
                        told me never to use exclamation
                        points.  They oversell your point.

                                (nods)
                        And you have to save him.  See
                        you're making my point for me. 
                        Without exclamation points.
                                (beat)
                        We all want to be saved, Johnny. 
                        Sometimes, it's from ourselves.

          He looks at Johnny with nothing short of worship...

                        Be a teacher again.  As Daniel
                        was.  Teach them...and maybe
                        they'll save themselves.

                        Bear your responsibilities lightly,
                        Johnny, and your shoulders will
                        not be bowed.  

          And ironically this is exactly the message Johnny's been
          needing to hear, only it hasn't come from Bruce, or Purdy,
          but from this strange and tortured man.

          An amplified voice breaks the moment.

          Francis barely reacts... and then he stuffs the pistol
          into his belt and unslings the assault rifle.  Is he about
          to kill them?

                        Did you know that at the end of
                        his days, Nebuchadnezzar rejected
                        God and went mad... was driven
                        from other men and lived like an
                        animal.  All as Daniel prophesied.

          He then suddenly ejects the magazine from his rifle, along
          with the chambered round, and walks out, still holding
          the rifle, before Johnny can even think to stop him.          DEAD ZONE: VALLEY OF THE SHADOW - ACT FOUR - 10/7/02 YEL   56.
