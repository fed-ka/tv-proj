A landing at the top of a crooked, wooden staircase. There is
a threadbare, braided rug on the floor. There is a long, wide
corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and
battleships. The wallpapers are sun-bleached and peeling at
the corners except for a few newly-hung strips which are
clean and bright. A small easel sits stored in the corner.
Outside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling
the gutters.
A ten-year-old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully
eating a bowl of cereal as he walks. He is Lionel. Lionel
slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window. He
takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the
turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove.
A child's voice says over the speaker:
RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)
In order to show you how a big symphony
orchestra is put together, Benjamin
Britten has written a big piece of music,
which is made up of smaller pieces that
show you all the separate parts of the
orchestra.
As Lionel listens, three other children wander out of their
bedrooms and down to the landing.
The first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe. He is
Murray. The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer
shorts and a white undershirt. He is Rudy. The third is a
twelve-year-old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee-high
socks and brightly polished, patent-leather shoes. She is
Suzy. She carries a one-month-old striped kitten.
The boys drop down to the floor next to their brother. They
lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their
fists, listening.
Suzy sits in the windowsill. She opens a book called Shelly
and the Secret Universe. There is an illustration on the
cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her
neck.
Suzy starts to read -- then pauses. She lowers her book. She
raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes. She looks out
into the rain.
2.
The lining of the tent is printed with images of trees and
pine cones, and a plaid rug covers the floor. There is a foot
locker, a gas lamp, a chair with a folded blanket over it,
and an empty cot. Scout Master Ward steps inside slowly, bent
over, examining the space. He lifts the lid of the foot
locker. He looks under the corner of the mattress. He picks
up a piece of folded yellow notebook paper sticking out from
under a pillow. He opens it and stares at it. He turns
suddenly to the chair against the wall of the tent and slides
it aside.
There is neat but slightly jagged hole the size of a
basketball cut through the fabric in the back corner. Scout
Master Ward looks to his staring troop.
SCOUT MASTER WARD
Jiminy Cricket. He flew the coop.
A small office with a desk, a file cabinet, and a two-way
radio. Captain Sharp comes inside, sits down, grabs a
microphone, and presses a red button on the side of it with
his thumb.
CAPTAIN SHARP
Hello? This is Captain Sharp. Over.
Scout Master Ward's voice comes over a crackly speaker:
SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
Captain Sharp, this is Randall Ward over
at Camp Ivanhoe. Over.
Captain Sharp pours himself a cup of coffee from a pot on a
hot-plate as he answers distractedly:
CAPTAIN SHARP
Morning, Randy. What can I do for you?
Over.
SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
I'm not sure, exactly. I've got an
escaped Khaki Scout. Over.
Silence. Captain Sharp frowns slightly.
CAPTAIN SHARP
What does that mean? Over.
SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
One of my boys seems to have stolen a dug-
out and some fishing tackle, ten pounds
(MORE)
9.
SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.) (cont'd)
of sundries, two bedrolls, plus an air
rifle -- and disappeared. Over.
Captain Sharp slowly stirs sugar into his coffee as he
contemplates this. He says finally:
CAPTAIN SHARP
Any idea why? Over.
SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
No. He left me a letter of resignation.
Over.
INSERT:
A sheet of wide-ruled yellow paper which reads in a boy's
PENCILED SCRAWL:
Dear Scout Master Ward, I am very sad
to inform you I can no longer be involved
with the Khaki Scouts of North America.
The rest of the troop will probably be
glad to hear this. It is not your fault.
Best wishes, Sam Shakusky.
Captain Sharp scratches his head. He checks his watch. Pause.
CAPTAIN SHARP
I guess we better notify his folks. Over.
SCOUT MASTER WARD (V.O.)
OK. Over and out.
A young woman with her hair in a bun sits at an operator's
switchboard eating a sandwich wrapped in wax-paper. She is
Becky. She wears bulky head-phones with a microphone
attached. Captain Sharp paces behind her. Scout Master Ward
flips through a stack of letters and post cards.
A bell rings on the switchboard. Becky plugs cords into
sockets.
BECKY
Hello, Diane.
10.
OPERATOR (V.O.)
Becky, I have your person-to-person from
Chesterfield.
BECKY
Hold the line, please.
Becky signals to Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward. They
sit down quickly and put on their own sets of operator head-
phones.
BECKY
Go ahead, Chesterfield.
CUT TO:
Split-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp,
Scout Master Ward, and Becky. On the other side, we see a
seventy-five-year-old man with a grizzled face sitting at a
kitchen table drinking coffee and smoking a cigarette while a
white-haired woman ices a cake in the background. They are
Mr. and Mrs. Billingsley. Mr. Billingsley says into his
TELEPHONE:
MR. BILLINGSLEY
Hello?
CAPTAIN SHARP
Hello, sir. This is Captain Sharp.
MR. BILLINGSLEY
Yes, sir. I received your message. Thank
you very much. In fact, we've come to a
decision, as a family, because this is
only the most recent incident involving
Sam's troubles, and it's just not fair to
the others, so, unfortunately -- we can't
invite him back, at this time.
Captain Sharp, Scout Master Ward, and Becky all look puzzled.
Captain Sharp says evenly:
CAPTAIN SHARP
There's no cause for alarm, sir. We'll
find him. We're just notifying you as a
matter of protocol and so on.
MR. BILLINGSLEY
I understand that. I'm notifying you of
the situation on my end.
CAPTAIN SHARP
I'm confused by that statement. You can't
invite him back?
11.
MR. BILLINGSLEY
I'm afraid not. He's a good boy, he's got
a good heart, but it's just not fair to
the others, you see? He's emotionally
disturbed.
Long pause. No one moves except Mrs. Billingsley icing her
cake. Captain Sharp says finally:
CAPTAIN SHARP
Am I speaking to Sam's father?
Mr. Billingsley frowns. He says, surprised:
MR. BILLINGSLEY
No, sir. Sam's parents passed away a
number of years ago. We're Mr. and Mrs.
Billingsley. We're foster parents. Sam's
been with us since last June.
Mrs. Billingsley has stopped icing her cake. She watches Mr.
Billingsley. Scout Master Ward interjects:
SCOUT MASTER WARD
Excuse me, sir. This is Scout Master Ward
speaking. Are you implying Sam's an
orphan?
MR. BILLINGSLEY
Well, it's a known fact. Of course, he
is.
SCOUT MASTER WARD
Why the hell doesn't it say that in the
register? Excuse my language.
Scout Master Ward holds up a manila file-card. Mr.
Billingsley shrugs.
MR. BILLINGSLEY
I don't know. What register?
INSERT:
The manila file-card. It is labelled Khaki Scout Register.
Sam Shakusky is typed across the top line. There is an
address, health information, and a small, faded snap-shot
stapled to the corner of it of a twelve-year-old boy standing
in a sunny tobacco field. He wears his scout uniform with a
Davy Crockett-style coon-skin cap.
MR. BILLINGSLEY
We sent him a letter. It should reach you
presently.
12.
Scout Master Ward looks quickly through his stack of letters.
He stops and pulls out an air-mail envelope. He stares at it.
Captain Sharp says forcefully but highly agitated:
CAPTAIN SHARP
Mr. Billingsley, I've got an escaped
Khaki Scout. We're notifying you as a
matter of protocol. You say you can't
invite him back? You say he's an orphan?
Well, I don't understand how that works.
(TOTALLY CONFUSED)
What am I supposed to do with him?
MR. BILLINGSLEY
That's up to Social Services. They'll be
in touch with you. They'll look after
Sam. Good luck to you.
Mr. Billingsley hangs up the telephone. Becky pulls the cords
out of their sockets. Captain Sharp looks to Scout Master
Ward. Silence.
Becky opens a tin of home-made chocolate chip cookies.
Captain Sharp declines one. Scout Master Ward tries one. He
looks very impressed.
The front flaps are tied-open, and a mosquito net is drawn. A
hanging lantern flickers on a hook. A bugle plays a variation
of taps in the distance. Scout Master Ward sits on a cot
dressed in pajamas. He smokes a cigarette and drinks a glass
of brandy while he speaks tensely into a microphone:
SCOUT MASTER WARD
Scout Master's log. September second.
First day of search party for Sam
Shakusky. Morale is extremely low, in
part, I suppose, because Sam is,
unfortunately, the least popular scout in
the troop, by a significant margin. I'm
worried, and I'm confused. Please, let us
find him tomorrow. Please, don't let him
fall off a cliff or drown in the goddamn
lake or something. A terrible day at Camp
Ivanhoe. Let's hope tomorrow's better. In
fact, I'm going to say a prayer.
Scout Master Ward presses stop. He kneels down on the floor,
closes his eyes, presses his palms together, and whispers.
17.
A play is in progress. The set includes a long ark with a
sail built on a platform behind the altar. Two teenagers
crouched in the wings ripple a narrow, blue sheet across the
foot of the stage. (This is meant to be water.) The rest of
the room is dim, with tall candles flickering along the
center aisle. The beams are draped with garlands. A large
congregation fills every pew plus folding chairs against the
walls. More people sit and stand on the steps to the choir
loft at the back and in nooks and corners. The members of a
brass ensemble seated beside the organist wait for their next
cue, following their sheet music with instruments poised.
Khaki Scouts and scout masters occupy the rear section of the
church. A very young troop in a slightly different version of
the uniform fills a row near the exit. Sam sits on the aisle.
He looks bored.
A baritone built like a linebacker in robes and a fake beard
sings ominously on the stage. Cymbals crash. Sam stands up
and discreetly wanders toward the side door with his hands in
his pockets. A slight, forty-year-old man in the same uniform
watches him from the end of the pew, frowning.
CUT TO:
Sam quietly entering the lobby. The sound of the music
deadens as he gently shuts the door behind him. He turns
around and puts on a yellow scout cap with Junior Khaki
stitched on the bill. The room is jammed with children
dressed as animals, waiting nervously in a long line that
19.
winds all around the space. They whisper and shuffle. A large
woman stares through a small window into the church with her
hand on a doorknob. She is Mrs. Lynn. She snaps her fingers
suddenly without looking to the children. They fall silent.
Pause.
Mrs. Lynn swings open the center doors. Music fills the room
again. The first twenty of the children begin to sing. They
march out of the lobby, two by two. The woman closes the
doors behind them, and the next group takes their place to
wait.
Sam walks slowly among otters, monkeys, squirrels, and
skunks, examining their costumes, periodically touching
horns, tusks, and teeth. No one pays attention to him. He
drinks a sip from a water fountain. He picks up a mint from a
bowl and sucks on it. He slips out through a swinging door.
Sam moves down a dark corridor. Voices murmur. He pokes his
head around a corner. A rack of choir robes and cassocks
blocks his path. He slides two of them apart and looks
THROUGH AT:
Five eleven-year-old girls in black leotards sitting on a
bench in front of a mirror framed with light bulbs. They talk
quietly and fix their make-up. They all wear wings on their
arms and beaks on their heads. Suzy sits among them in black
feathers. Sam stares at her. He steps into the light
silently. Suzy sees him in the reflection. The other girls
turn around quickly, covering themselves.
Sam removes his cap and takes another step forward. His eyes
dart briefly among the other girls. He says to Suzy:
SAM
What kind of bird are you?
Suzy hesitates. She looks to the girl next to her, who says
in a bossy voice:
BOSSY GIRL
I'm a sparrow, she's a dove, and --
Sam does not look away from Suzy as he interrupts, pointing:
SAM
No, I said, "What kind of bird are you?"
The other girls all look to Suzy. Pause.
SUZY
I'm a raven.
20.
Suzy lifts her beak slightly higher on her forehead. The
other girls look annoyed but transfixed. The bossy girl
frowns.
BOSSY GIRL
Boy's aren't allowed in here.
Sam does not look away from Suzy as he answers quietly:
SAM
I'll be leaving soon.
Sam points down at Suzy's lap. One of her hands is wrapped in
a bandage.
SAM
What happened to your hand?
SUZY
(PAUSE)
I got hit in the mirror.
SAM
(TAKEN ABACK)
Really. How'd that happen?
SUZY
(SHRUGS)
I lost my temper at myself.
Sam is deeply intrigued by this. The other girls look
puzzled. Suzy presses her hair back off her face. She watches
Sam nervously.
SUZY
What's your name?
SAM
Sam. What's yours?
SUZY
I'm Suzy.
Sam nods with his eyes still glued to Suzy's. Suzy bites her
fingernails. The bossy girl rolls her eyes.
BOSSY GIRL
It's not polite to stare.
Sam holds up his hand for the bossy girl to stop talking.
Mrs. Lynn steps into the doorway.
MRS. LYNN
Birds! Ready?
21.
Mrs. Lynn does a double-take. She snaps at Sam:
MRS. LYNN
Who are you? Where'd you come from? Go
back to your seat.
Sam hesitates. He spits the mint into a trash can, ducks out
through the clothing rack, and is gone. A skinny girl dressed
as an owl watches Suzy while the other girls hurry to their
feet. She says quietly:
SKINNY GIRL
He likes you.
A vehicle crowded with scouts. Sam sits alone in the back
row. He stares into space, entranced.
CUT TO:
Suzy on-stage at the top of a pedestal with her arms in the
air, spreading her wings. She is surrounded by the entire
cast of singing animals. The music soars.
CUT TO:
Sam as he looks down at the piece of paper in his hand.
INSERT:
A sheet of pink stationary with an address in a girl's red
felt-tip cursive and the words:
Write to me.
CUT TO:
The present. Sam and Suzy face each other in the wide meadow.
Sam says carefully:
SAM
Were you followed?
22.
SUZY
(LOOKING AROUND)
I doubt it.
SAM
Good.
Sam frowns and squints. He points.
SAM
Did you bring a cat?
Suzy nods. Sam smiles. Suzy smiles. Sam takes a folded map
out of his pocket. He signals for Suzy to come closer.
SAM
Can you read a map?
SUZY
Uh-huh.
SAM
I do cartography.
Sam points to one of the patches on his sash. It has a
protractor embroidered on it. He unfolds the map.
SAM
I feel we should go halfway today and
halfway tomorrow, since you're a less
experienced hiker, and you're wearing
Sunday-school shoes.
SUZY
OK.
SAM
(pointing on the map)
Here's where we are right now. I'd like
to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred
(which means four o'clock). How does that
sound?
SUZY
Fine.
SAM
You want some beef jerky?
SUZY
OK.
Sam tears a strip of dried meat in two and gives half to
Suzy. She tries to chew on it. Sam nods:
23.
SAM
Let's go.
MONTAGE:
Sam and Suzy walk together down a hill, across a field, and
through a wooded path eating beef jerky. They both smile
continuously.
SAM
Are you thirsty?
SUZY
No.
SAM
Well, if your throat gets parched, stick
a pebble in your mouth and suck on it.
You can quench your thirst with the spit,
supposedly.
Sam shows Suzy some bits of green and yellow sticking out
from under his coonskin cap.
SAM
Sometimes I stick leaves under my hat. It
cools your head down.
SUZY
That's a good idea. It might help also if
you didn't wear fur.
SAM
(HESITATES)
True, but this adds camouflage.
Sam stands in a clearing and pulls a handful of dry grass. He
holds it in his fist.
SAM
Here's a trick. Throw grass in the air,
and you can see which direction the
wind's blowing.
Sam throws up the grass. It swirls and drifts vaguely. Suzy
squints.
SUZY
Which way?
SAM
Unknown. I guess it doesn't really
matter, as long as we cover our tracks.
24.
Sam and Suzy stop to investigate and discuss: a patch of
mushrooms, moss on a stump, ferns, poison ivy, and a low bush
with purple fruit. Sam looks skeptical.
SAM
These might be poisonous.
SUZY
(STUDYING THEM)
No, they're huckleberries, in fact. Try
one.
Suzy brushes off some dirt and eats a berry. Sam puts one
into his mouth and nods.
SAM
Not bad. Anyway, they're good for
survival.
Sam and Suzy look through Suzy's binoculars at a deer
drinking from a stream. Suzy whispers:
SUZY
He knows someone's watching him.
SAM
I agree. Why do you say that?
SUZY
(SQUINTING)
I don't know. I just think he can feel
us.
Sam and Suzy walk across a fallen tree over a stream. A snake
swims on the surface below them. Sam assists Suzy onto the
far bank.
SAM
You smell like perfume.
SUZY
It's my mother's.
Sam picks up two pebbles. He and Suzy both put them in their
mouths. They click against their teeth.
SAM
I brought water, too.
Sam and Suzy watch a small, green worm wriggling in the air,
swaying from a silk thread. They stare, wide-eyed. Suzy cups
her hand a few inches below it and moves it around in a
circle. Sam shrugs.
25.
SAM
Should we catch him?
SUZY
(HESITATES)
What for?
SAM
Trout bait. We need worms.
SUZY
(SHARPLY)
No.
Pause. The worm curls and uncurls itself gently. Sam nods.
SAM
You're right. We'll let him live. Maybe
I've got a licorice whip.
The dining room. There is a long, wide, empty table with
sixteen chairs around it. Tucked in the corner, Lionel,
Murray, and Rudy sit at a folding card table. They have
plates on place-mats and forks and knives. There is one extra
seat. Mrs. Bishop's voice booms, amplified, from the next
ROOM:
MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)
Suzy! Dinner! I'm not going to say it
again!
Pause. Mrs. Bishop charges into the room with a steaming
casserole. She wears an oven mitt on one hand and carries an
electric megaphone in the other. She sets the casserole on
the card table and looks out the window. Through the thicket
32.
of trees behind the house, a pair of headlights blinks. Mrs.
Bishop checks her watch. She says sharply:
MRS. BISHOP
Where's your sister?
LIONEL
I don't know, but she borrowed my record
player for ten days without asking.
MRS. BISHOP
(CONFUSED)
What does that mean?
Lionel holds up a small, folded-up piece of pink stationary.
Mrs. Bishop snaps it out of his hand and opens it.
INSERT:
A short note on pink stationary in a girl's red felt-tip
cursive. It reads:
Dear Lionel, I need to use your
record player. I will give it back in
ten days or less. Do not tell Mom.
(Or Dad.) I will replace the batteries
when I return. Signed, Suzy Bishop
Mrs. Bishop frowns. She bolts back out of the room. Her voice
BOOMS AGAIN:
MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)
Walt! Where the hell are you?
There is a loud thump upstairs. Mr. Bishop shouts from
OUTSIDE:
MR. BISHOP (O.S.)
Right here! Why are you cursing at me?
CUT TO:
Exterior. Mr. Bishop leans out of an upstairs window. Mrs.
Bishop appears in one below. She yells up through the
MEGAPHONE:
MRS. BISHOP
Does it concern you that your daughter's
just run away from home?
MR. BISHOP
(PAUSE)
That's a loaded question.
33.
Mrs. Bishop brandishes the note with her free hand.
MRS. BISHOP
Come down and read this.
A radio squawks in the woods behind the house. Mr. and Mrs.
Bishop turn quickly toward the sound. Mrs. Bishop looks
tense. Becky's garbled voice says over a tinny speaker:
BECKY (V.O.)
Scout Master Ward confirms they've had no
luck. They're going home for the --
There is a rustling and the sound of a car door opening --
then the radio cuts off. Mr. Bishop frowns. He shouts:
MR. BISHOP
Who's there?
Captain Sharp emerges slowly from the dark, tangled in a
bramble, hopping slowly on one foot as he unwinds a root from
around his ankle. He smiles awkwardly and says:
CAPTAIN SHARP
Good evening. Sorry to startle you. I was
JUST --
MR. BISHOP
(ANGRILY)
What are you doing here? Nobody called
the police.
CAPTAIN SHARP
I know, that's what I'm saying. The
search party's not over yet. In other
WORDS --
MRS. BISHOP
Suzy's missing, too! Go find her.
CAPTAIN SHARP
(HESITATES)
OK. Where'd she --
MR. BISHOP
Wait for me.
Mr. Bishop disappears into the house. Captain Sharp and Mrs.
Bishop exchange an uncertain look.
Captain Sharp pans a spot-light back and forth in the
darkness while he steers the car. The lamp has a short in it
34.
and flickers with each bump. Mr. Bishop rides in the
passenger seat. He stares ahead down the road and says to
HIMSELF:
MR. BISHOP
How can we help her? She's got so many
problems. It's getting worse.
Mr. Bishop looks strangely to Captain Sharp. He asks:
MR. BISHOP
Whose fault is it?
CAPTAIN SHARP
(HESITATES)
I don't know, but just for the record:
ninety-five percent of all runaways
return home within six hours. That
doesn't do you any good right now. It's
just a statistic -- but in all likelihood
Suzy's probably hiding in the closet at
her best friend's house playing Chinese
Checkers at this very moment, as we
speak.
MR. BISHOP
She doesn't have any friends.
CAPTAIN SHARP
(LONG PAUSE)
How's Laura?
MR. BISHOP
(IRRITATED)
How's Laura?
CAPTAIN SHARP
Mrs. Bishop, I mean.
MR. BISHOP
I don't understand.
CAPTAIN SHARP
Is she upset?
Mr. Bishop looks baffled and disgusted. He throws his hands
into the air. He looks away and shakes his head. Silence.
Captain Sharp wiggles some wires.
CAPTAIN SHARP
I got to get this spot-light fixed.
35.
Captain Sharp speeds bouncing down a winding dirt road. Lazy-
Eye, Deluca, and Gadge sit next to him crowded into the
passenger seat. Lazy-Eye yells into the hand-set of the
POLICE RADIO:
LAZY-EYE
She stabbed Redford in the back with
lefty scissors!
A voice responds over the speaker:
JED (V.O.)
Repeat that, please? Over.
Captain Sharp grabs the hand-set out of Lazy-Eye's hand. He
shouts into it:
CAPTAIN SHARP
Puncture wound. Lower lumbar. Make room
for a stretcher in the cockpit!
Redford is lying on his stomach on a towel in the rear of the
vehicle. Scout Master Ward kneels next to him pressing his
hand firmly into the middle of his back. There is significant
blood. Redford moans loudly. Scout Master Ward reassures him:
SCOUT MASTER WARD
You're going to be OK. Thank goodness,
she missed the artery. Bite on this.
Scout Master Ward puts a pencil in Redford's teeth. Redford
grimaces, crunching it. In the back seat, the rest of the
troop excitedly re-cap:
NICKLEBY
I tried to chop him, but he dodged my
tomahawk.
PANAGLE
Who else got hit?
46.
IZOD
Not me. I ran away when the girl went
berserk.
SKOTAK
He's got great marksmanship. He shot
Deluca in both arms.
Skotak points to the front seat. Deluca sits glumly in
silence. He has numerous small welts all over his arms. Gadge
SAYS SUDDENLY:
GADGE
Where's Snoopy?
A small room with two bunks, two portholes, and a pile of
ropes. Sam sits hunched over with his hands in his lap. He
stares at the envelope. Scout Master Ward sits down across
from him. He motions to the envelope and says quietly,
pausing between each sentence:
SCOUT MASTER WARD
I'm sorry about this. I didn't know your
situation. It's not on the register.
How'd you lose your parents? I shouldn't
ask that. Never mind. I wish we had time
for an inspection back there. On the
beach. I would've given you a
"commendable". That was one of the best-
pitched camp-sites I've ever seen.
Honestly.
Sam does not respond. Scout Master Ward asks in a wounded
VOICE:
SCOUT MASTER WARD
You don't want to be a Khaki Scout
anymore?
Sam shakes his head.
Becky sits at the switchboard with her head-phones on.
Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward sit behind her wearing
their own sets of head-phones. There is a click on the other
end of the line.
59.
OPERATOR (V.O.)
Hello, Becky.
BECKY
Judy, I have your person-to-person from
New Penzance.
OPERATOR (V.O.)
Go ahead, New Penzance.
CUT TO:
Split-screen. On one side of the frame, we see Captain Sharp,
Scout Master Ward, and Becky. On the other side, we see a
fifty-year-old woman in a blue and white uniform pants-suit
with a Salvation Army officer-style hat and a red ribbon tied
in a bow around her neck. She is Social Services. She sits at
a desk in a cinder block office. Guards and orderlies criss-
cross in a bullet-proof window to a long, grey corridor
behind her.
CAPTAIN SHARP
Hello? This is Captain Sharp.
Social Services flips open a file-folder and picks up a ball-
point pen. (She takes notes throughout the conversation.) She
says into her telephone:
SOCIAL SERVICES
Hello, Captain Sharp. This is Social
Services. I'm calling in reference to Sam
Shakusky, Ward of the State. I understand
he's in your custody.
CAPTAIN SHARP
That's correct.
SOCIAL SERVICES
What's his condition? Has he suffered any
injury or trauma of any kind?
CAPTAIN SHARP
He's OK.
SOCIAL SERVICES
Very good. How do I get to you?
CAPTAIN SHARP
The fastest way is by seaplane. Jed can
bring you in with the mail.
SOCIAL SERVICES
I'll come tomorrow morning, if that's
acceptable to you. Is someone able to
(MORE)
60.
SOCIAL SERVICES (cont'd)
provide reasonable care and nourishment
for the boy until that time?
CAPTAIN SHARP
Uh-huh.
SOCIAL SERVICES
Is that a yes?
CAPTAIN SHARP
Uh-huh.
SOCIAL SERVICES
Very good. I'll contact you again before
the end of the day.
Social Services starts to hang up the telephone. Captain
Sharp says abruptly:
CAPTAIN SHARP
Wait a second.
SOCIAL SERVICES
(HESITATES)
Yes?
CAPTAIN SHARP
Social Services?
SOCIAL SERVICES
(EVENLY)
Captain Sharp.
CAPTAIN SHARP
(ANXIOUS)
What's going to happen to him?
Pause. Social Services puts down her pen. She clasps her
hands together in front of her. She says finally:
SOCIAL SERVICES
Well, normally, we'd try to place him in
another foster home, but that option is
no longer available to us, in my opinion,
with his case history -- which means
he'll go to Juvenile Refuge.
Captain Sharp exchanges a look with Scout Master Ward. Scout
Master Ward interjects:
SCOUT MASTER WARD
What's that? An orphanage?
Social Services frowns. She asks calmly:
61.
SOCIAL SERVICES
Who's speaking?
SCOUT MASTER WARD
This is Scout Master Ward.
Social Services refers to a document in her file-folder. She
nods.
SOCIAL SERVICES
Right. An orphanage -- but the first step
is the admissions panel requires a
psychological evaluation to determine
whether or not the boy's a candidate for
institutional treatment or electroshock
therapy. Beyond that --
CAPTAIN SHARP
(INTERRUPTING)
Excuse me. Shock therapy? Why would that
be necessary? He's not violent.
Social Services picks up the document. She points to it.
SOCIAL SERVICES
The report describes an assault with
scissors.
CAPTAIN SHARP
(OBJECTING)
That was the girl! Who did that.
SOCIAL SERVICES
(PAUSE)
Well, maybe she needs help, too -- but
that's not our job. OK?
CAPTAIN SHARP
(LONG PAUSE)
OK.
Social Service hangs up the telephone. Becky pulls the cords
out of their sockets. Scout Master Ward looks to Captain
Sharp. Silence.
Becky opens a tin of home-made lemon bars. Captain Sharp
declines one. Scout Master Ward tries one. He looks
completely enchanted.
The living room. There is a wicker rocking chair, a vase
filled with wilted wildflowers, and a portrait of some
62.
Pilgrims hanging over a stone fireplace. Lionel, Murray, and
Rudy sit together on the floor playing Parchesi.
Mr. Bishop lurches into the doorway, shirtless. He carries an
open bottle of red wine with a glass in one hand and a long-
handled woodsman's axe in the other.
MR. BISHOP
I'll be out back.
Lionel, Murray, and Lionel look up from their game. Mr.
Bishop hesitates. He seems slightly disoriented.
MR. BISHOP
I'm going to find a tree to chop down.
Mr. Bishop exits. Pause. Lionel rolls a pair of dice.
Old linoleum floor. Dark curtainless window. One bare light
bulb. Suzy sits erect in the bathtub staring blankly into
space. Mrs. Bishop washes her with a soapy sponge. Suzy's
clothes and leather folder are in the corner with the kitten
scratching at them.
MRS. BISHOP
I do know what you're feeling, Suzy-bean.
I've had moments myself where I say: what
am I doing here? Who made this decision?
How could I allow myself to do something
so stupid --
(WITH FEELING)
-- and why is it still happening? We
women are more emotional. You have to
REMEMBER --
Suzy turns to Mrs. Bishop and interrupts:
SUZY
I hate you.
MRS. BISHOP
(HESITATES)
Don't say "hate".
SUZY
Why not? I mean it.
MRS. BISHOP
You think you mean it. In this moment.
You're trying to hurt me.
63.
SUZY
Exactly.
(PAUSE)
I know what you do with that sad, dumb
police man. You go to bed with him.
Mrs. Bishop looks stunned. She says quietly:
MRS. BISHOP
He's not dumb, but I guess he is kind of
sad. Anyway, we shouldn't discuss that.
It's not appropriate for me to even
acknowledge what I already just said.
Mrs. Bishop sees something sticking out of the leather
folder. She pulls it out and stares at it. It is the "Coping
with the Very Troubled Child" pamphlet. She looks to Suzy.
Suzy looks away. Mrs. Bishop sighs deeply and says, on the
verge of tears:
MRS. BISHOP
Poor Suzy. Why is everything so hard for
you?
Suzy starts to cry. She covers her face. Her voice breaks as
SHE SAYS:
SUZY
We're in love. We just want to be
together. What's wrong with that?
Mrs. Bishop puts her arms around Suzy. Suzy shakes, silently
sobbing. Mrs. Bishop pulls some twigs and stems out of Suzy's
hair. She studies the beetle earrings. She says wearily:
MRS. BISHOP
Oh, my God. How are we going to get these
fish-hooks out?
Captain Sharp cooks sausages on a skillet in a kitchenette.
He has a bottle of beer in his hand. Sam sits waiting at a
fold-out table with a glass of milk in front of him. He says
without looking up:
SAM
I admit we knew we'd get in trouble. That
part's true. We knew people would be
worried, and we still ran away, anyway --
but something also happened which we
didn't do on purpose. When we first met
each other. Something happened to us.
64.
Captain Sharp stirs the sausages in the pan. He nods. He says
SERIOUSLY:
CAPTAIN SHARP
I agree with you. That's eloquent. I
can't argue against anything you're
saying -- but I don't have to, because
you're twelve years old.
Captain Sharp brings the skillet to the table and serves
three links onto one plate and three onto another. He sits
down.
CAPTAIN SHARP
Look, let's face it, you're probably a
much more intelligent person than I am.
In fact, I guarantee it -- but even smart
kids sometimes stick their fingers in
electrical sockets, if you see what I
mean. It takes time to figure things out.
It's been proven by history: all mankind
makes mistakes. It's our job to try to
protect you from the dangerous ones. If
we can.
Captain Sharp pours an inch of beer into a glass and slides
it over to Sam.
CAPTAIN SHARP
You want a slug?
Sam nods. He and Captain Sharp both drink sips. Captain Sharp
asks gently and sincerely:
CAPTAIN SHARP
What's the rush? You've got your whole
life in front of yourself. Ahead of you,
I mean.
SAM
(SHRUGS)
Maybe so. Anyway, you're a bachelor.
CAPTAIN SHARP
(DEFENSIVE)
What does that have to do with it? So are
you.
SAM
(SADLY)
That's true. Did you love someone ever?
65.
CAPTAIN SHARP
(PAUSE)
Yes, I did.
SAM
What happened?
CAPTAIN SHARP
She didn't love me back.
SAM
Ah.
Sam considers this. Captain Sharp looks depressed. They start
eating their sausages. Captain Sharp says quietly:
CAPTAIN SHARP
I'm sorry for your loss. Anyway, that's
what people say.
SAM
Thanks.
CAPTAIN SHARP
What happened?
SAM
A drunk truck driver smashed into them.
CAPTAIN SHARP
(PAINED)
Good grief.
Silence. Captain Sharp refills both their beer glasses.
Scout Master Ward sits on his cot in his pajamas again with a
cigarette in his mouth. His tape recorder is recording. He
says into the microphone:
SCOUT MASTER WARD
Scout Master's Log. September fourth.
Scout Master Ward hesitates. He thinks for a minute. He takes
a deep breath. He closes his eyes. He opens them again. He
looks desperate. He looks up at the ceiling. He shakes his
head. He presses stop. He kneels on the floor with his palms
together and smokes.
There is a slight commotion outside. Scout Master Ward
SHOUTS:
66.
SCOUT MASTER WARD
Stow it, out there! I want to hear some
Z's!
The fort sixty feet above the camp. It is still under
construction. The entire troop (with the exceptions of
Redford and Sam) has gathered for a clandestine meeting. They
all wear pajamas. Skotak stands on a balcony with his back to
the group and his hands on a wooden railing.
GADGE
I heard he's going to reform school.
DELUCA
I heard they're going to take out a piece
of his brain and send him to an insane
asylum.
ROOSEVELT
I like his girl.
PANAGLE
She's too scruffy for me.
NICKLEBY
Supposedly, they got to third base.
LAZY-EYE
That's not true. He just felt her up.
ROOSEVELT
(DEEPLY INTRIGUED)
Over-shirt or under-shirt?
Skotak slams his fist on the railing. Everyone looks
startled. Skotak turns around to face the group. He says
ANGRILY:
SKOTAK
Damn us.
The railing collapses behind Skotak, ripping part of a wall
and a row of shingles off the structure as it falls away.
There is a moment of silence before it hits the ground with a
splintering thud. Skotak hesitates. He moves a half-step away
from the edge. He continues:
SKOTAK
This troop has been very shabby to Field
Mate Sam Shakusky. In fact, we've been a
bunch of mean jerks. Why's he so
unpopular? I admit, supposedly, he's
(MORE)
67.
SKOTAK (CONT'D)
emotionally disturbed -- but he's also a
disadvantaged orphan. How would you feel?
Skotak moves among the group, looking from face to face, as
HE ASKS:
SKOTAK
Nickleby? Deluca? Lazy-Eye?
(from the heart)
Gadge?
Skotak circles around the edge of the tree house. He says
WITH FEELING:
SKOTAK
He's a fellow Khaki Scout, and he needs
our help. Are we man enough to give that?
So part of his brain doesn't get removed
out of him.
Skotak stands still. He says mysteriously:
SKOTAK
They were prepared to die for each other
out there.
Silence. The other scouts begin to murmur to each other,
shaking their heads, shrugging, whispering, and gesturing.
Finally, Deluca looks up to Skotak.
DELUCA
What do you need?
SKOTAK
(EXCITED)
For starters? Three yards of chicken
wire, some ripped-up newspapers, and a
bucket of wheatpaste.
A burning match drops down into the fireplace near the foot
of a bunk where Sam lies sleeping. He has the sheet pulled up
to his chin, but his toes stick out. He opens one eye. Dust
descends and settles. Something scrapes and scratches. The
flame burns out.
Sam slides slowly off the mattress and creeps across the
floor. He crouches in front of the fireplace. He flicks on a
scout flashlight and sees:
The end of a hanging rope.
Sam leans quickly into the fireplace and looks straight up,
shining his flashlight. Skotak is looking down at him from
the top of the chimney. He puts his finger to his lips. Sam
WHISPERS SHARPLY:
SAM
Get out of my chimney.
SKOTAK
Listen to me. We're here for friendship.
We're going to get you off this island.
SAM
(LONG PAUSE)
No, thanks.
SKOTAK
Yes, thanks. This is an emergency rescue.
SAM
It's worthless to me. There's no point.
Not without Suzy.
Skotak gestures for Sam to wait. He disappears from view. A
moment later, Suzy's face appears at the top of the chimney,
smiling toothily. Sam looks ecstatic.
70.
SAM
How'd you get here?
SUZY
They snuck me down the laundry chute and
left a paper-mach dummy in my bed.
SAM
(IMPRESSED)
Diversion tactics. Good thinking.
CUT TO:
The next room. Captain Sharp sleeps in boxer shorts on the
floor of the kitchenette in the dark. He snores quietly.
The room is black. Mr. and Mrs. Bishop lie in separate single
beds side-by-side. They both stare at the ceiling. The
windows rattle, the walls creak, and trees sway outside.
Long pause. Mrs. Bishop whispers:
MRS. BISHOP
Did you file the motion for continuance?
Peabody vs. Henderson.
MR. BISHOP
It was sustained.
MRS. BISHOP
Good.
72.
MR. BISHOP
(PAUSE)
Did the judge consider your application
for leniency? Rogers vs. Yentob.
MRS. BISHOP
He granted it.
MR. BISHOP
Great.
Silence. Mrs. Bishop's voice breaks as she says quietly:
MRS. BISHOP
I'm sorry, Walt.
MR. BISHOP
It's not your fault. Which injuries are
you apologizing for? Specifically.
MRS. BISHOP
Specifically? Whichever ones still hurt.
MR. BISHOP
(WISTFULLY)
Half of those were self-inflicted.
Mrs. Bishop shakes her head and smiles with tears on her
face. A powerful blast of wind shakes the room. A night-light
blinks. Mr. Bishop has a lump in his throat as he says:
MR. BISHOP
I hope the roof flies off, and I get
sucked up into space. You'll be better
off without me.
MRS. BISHOP
(SADLY)
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
MR. BISHOP
(PAINED)
Why?
Mr. and Mrs. Bishop look across at each other in the dark.
Mrs. Bishop says desperately:
MRS. BISHOP
We're all they've got, Walt.
Mr. Bishop takes a deep breath. He says finally, with a
DAWNING REALIZATION:
73.
MR. BISHOP
It's not enough.
Flashlight and lantern flames flicker over the jagged walls.
Skotak is curled in a blanket on a high rock. Gadge is tucked
into a sleeping bag under a ledge. The troop nestle on rocks
and ledges in bedrolls and sleeping bags all around the deep
cavern.
Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe
while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him. She reads aloud
from a book called Annabelle's Midnight. There is an
illustration on the cover of a blonde girl climbing out a
window onto a trellis with fireflies circling around her.
SUZY
"-- but I'm not going," said Barnaby
Jack. "I'm running away tonight for good,
and this time I won't get caught."
Annabelle whispered: "I'm coming with
you." Her yellow hair, now brown at the
roots, caught up in the wind and danced.
Barnaby Jack took Annabelle's hand and
pressed something into it the size of a
jellybean. "Hide this in your socks, and
be ready at midnight."
Suzy looks to Sam to see if he is still awake. Sam looks to
the rest of the troop to see if they are still awake. They
all nod and signal for Suzy to continue. Suzy turns the page
and reads on:
SUZY
He leapt out the window and landed in the
fresh-fallen snow.
A small entourage of teenage scouts studies maps, charts, and
documents at folding tables. One of them sits at a telegraph
machine. He wears headphones and taps Morse code on a paddle
as he listens to a transmission. He looks puzzled. He swivels
his chair to a steno-machine and begins typing rapidly.
Cousin Ben stands at a collapsible altar. He wears a purple,
silk stole around his neck with crosses stitched into it. Sam
80.
and Suzy hold a Bible with their hands on it. Skotak and the
rest of troop listen solemnly as Cousin Ben reads from a
MANUAL:
COUSIN BEN
-- which we hereby consecrate on this
day, the fifth of September, 1965.
(LOOKING UP)
That's the end of the short-form. Do any
of the witnesses have objections or
remarks? Usually, they don't.
Skotak raises his hand. Cousin Ben reluctantly calls on him:
COUSIN BEN
Skotak.
SKOTAK
Can we loan them the nickels? I'm worried
about their future.
COUSIN BEN
(OFFENDED)
That's my fee.
Skotak and the rest of the troop look very concerned. They
murmur to each other:
NICKLEBY
What's going to happen to them?
GADGE
Nobody knows.
DELUCA
Let's take a vote.
SKOTAK
All in favor --
COUSIN BEN
(LOUDLY)
That's my fee.
Skotak and the rest of the troop look to Cousin Ben. Cousin
Ben glares at them. He sighs. He points to Skotak.
COUSIN BEN
You're just like your brothers. OK, give
them the tennis ball can.
Cousin Ben points to the tennis ball can on the floor next to
his feet. Skotak takes it and zips it into a side-pocket of
81.
Sam's back-pack. Cousin Ben hands Sam and Suzy a receipt on a
clipboard.
COUSIN BEN
Sign here -- and initial here and here.
Sam and Suzy sign and initial. Cousin Ben tears out a copy.
COUSIN BEN
Take the carbon. Leave the Bible. Let's
go.
Sam and Suzy turn and walk out of the chapel tent holding
hands. They do not smile. Cousin Ben, Skotak, and the rest of
the troop follow them with grave expressions on their faces.
Sam touches Suzy's hair. Suzy kisses Sam's hand. They walk as
a group through the camp.
OMIT
Mr. Bishop listens on the telephone with a strained look on
his face. Mrs. Bishop watches him intently.
MR. BISHOP
Oh, dear God.
Mr. Bishop grabs Mrs. Bishop by the wrist. He says grimly:
MR. BISHOP
Get the boys.
86.
Mrs. Bishop raises her megaphone to her mouth. She shouts:
MRS. BISHOP
Let's go! Right now!
A deHavilland Beaver in heavy rain and turbulence. Jed speaks
into his radio while piloting the aircraft. Social Services
sits beside him in the passenger's seat. She looks queasy but
determined.
JED
Tower control, this is Jed. Confirm co-
ordinates for new destination: alpha-two-
two-seven-one-fiver. Looking pretty soupy
up here. Wouldn't mind setting down
before the pot boils over.
(to Social Services)
Hang on, Social Services.
Jed presses the yoke forward, and the plane dips hard. Social
Services braces against the dash.
The commander's entourage is frantically packing up their
portable telephones, P.A. system, folding tables, collapsible
chairs, etc. One of them wraps a tarp around boxes labelled
Fireworks.
INSERT:
A transistor radio. The announcer says urgently:
WEATHER MAN (V.O.)
Once again: storm waters have just
breached the dam at Black Beacon
(MORE)
87.
WEATHER MAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
Reservoir. A flash flood alert is in
effect. Take immediate precautions.
Commander Pierce and Secretary McIntire listen to the report.
Secretary McIntire says gravely:
SECRETARY MCINTIRE
That's coming our way.
Captain Pierce nods, worried. The capture-the-flag scouts in
soaking jerseys gather, winded, outside the tent. One of the
team captains stands in the entrance breathing heavily.
Commander Pierce points to him:
COMMANDER PIERCE
You find them?
TEAM CAPTAIN
No, sir.
COMMANDER PIERCE
(to the entourage)
Prepare to mobilize to higher ground.
Secretary McIntire hands Commander Pierce an envelope with
red-and-white stripes on it. Commander Pierce rips it open.
HE READS:
COMMANDER PIERCE
St. Jack Church is the designated storm
shelter.
(to Secretary McIntire)
Notify all scouts to muster outside my
tent on the double.
INSERT:
The St. Jack's Church poster box. Another mimeographed page
is stapled to the bulletin board. The heading is now Summer
Pageant, 1965. It reads:
BENJAMIN BRITTEN'S
"NOYE'S FLUDDE"
Performed by the
Choristers of St. Jack Wood and New Penzance
8PM TONIGHT
PERFORMANCE CANCELLED
OMIT
The set for the ark stands on the platform behind the altar.
There are candles and garlands in place, but also stacks of
88.
cardboard boxes and gallons of distilled-water. Numerous
animal costumes hang from a rolling garment rack. An old nun
crosses the aisle carrying a large, metal coffee dispenser.
Two young priests cross in the opposite direction carrying
folding cots. Voices shout urgently off-screen:
VOICES (O.S.)
More sandbags! We need dry blankets! Wake
up the Deacon!
Sam, Suzy, Skotak, and the rest of the troop slowly poke
their heads in from the side door and creep up the stairs to
the choir loft.
The room has now been converted into a full-fledged refugee
center. Families from the town-ship huddle in pews with bags
and piles of their wet belongings. Priests and nuns
distribute towels and sandwiches to frightened children. Dogs
and cats prowl nervously. Sandbags are stacked in low walls
outside the doors and windows. The rain beats on the roof,
and lightning continues to flash through the stained glass.
A side door opens. Captain Sharp comes in from the storm with
Mr. and Mrs. Bishop. Lionel, Murray, Rudy, and the two old
fishermen follow closely behind them. They slam the door.
Captain Sharp looks around frantically.
CAPTAIN SHARP
Who's in charge here?
Another side door opens. Scout Master Ward jogs in with
Commander Pierce still over his shoulders and the entire
company behind him flooding into the room. Captain Sharp
yells to him:
CAPTAIN SHARP
Randy! What happened?
Scout Master Ward goes over to Captain Sharp and turns his
back to him, jogging in place.
SCOUT MASTER WARD
Take the commander off of me.
Captain Sharp helps Commander Pierce down off Scout Master
Ward's back and into a pew to rest. Secretary McIntire
assists them. Mr. Bishop strides up the aisle yelling to the
left and right:
MR. BISHOP
Suzy? Sam?
SCOUT MASTER WARD
(shaking his head)
They ran away again.
Mr. and Mrs. Bishop grimace, unbelievably frustrated. Scout
Master Ward addresses the scouts:
SCOUT MASTER WARD
We're going back out. I need volunteers.
Hands raise. Scout Master Ward passes out walkie-talkies as
he chooses his squad:
92.
SCOUT MASTER WARD
You, you, you, you --
Becky steps in front of Scout Master Ward with her hand
raised. Scout Master Ward hesitates.
SCOUT MASTER WARD
-- and you?
Becky takes a walkie-talkie. She looks at Scout Master Ward
with admiration and asks, concerned:
BECKY
Are you all right?
SCOUT MASTER WARD
(WARMLY)
Of course, I am. Come on.
Scout Master Ward leads Becky by the arm through the crowded
church as they begin to gather supplies: extra flashlights, a
flare gun, coils of rope.
Captain Sharp looks up to the choir loft. Eleven children
dressed in animal masks sit quietly in a row. Captain Sharp
does a double-take. One of the animals is an otter wearing
Sunday-school shoes and binoculars around its neck. Next to
her is the male of the species in a sash with numerous small,
embroidered patches on it.
The front doors open. There is lightning, thunder, wind, and
rain. Social Services enters. She takes off a wet cape with a
red lining and hands it to an acolyte in a robe. Jed presses
the doors shut behind them. Social Services asks immediately:
SOCIAL SERVICES
Where's the boy?
Captain Sharp hesitates. He says reluctantly:
CAPTAIN SHARP
We don't know yet.
SOCIAL SERVICES
That's not acceptable.
CAPTAIN SHARP
(pretending to be irritated)
What do you want me to say, lady?
(to no one in particular)
Somebody get Jed a cup of coffee.
The acolyte runs to the coffee dispenser with a cardboard
cup. Social Services charges over to Captain Sharp.
93.
SOCIAL SERVICES
You're Captain Sharp?
CAPTAIN SHARP
That's right.
SOCIAL SERVICES
I'm Social Services. I remanded the boy
to your personal custody. You're
responsible for his safety. I'm told he
was just struck by lightning.
Captain Sharp frowns. He looks to Scout Master Ward and says
SKEPTICALLY:
CAPTAIN SHARP
That's the first I heard of it.
SCOUT MASTER WARD
(UNFORTUNATELY)
It's true.
Captain Sharp tries to process this. Social Services now
moves in on Scout Master Ward. She says aggressively:
SOCIAL SERVICES
Scout Master Ward, I presume?
SCOUT MASTER WARD
Yes, ma'am.
SOCIAL SERVICES
(BITINGLY)
Your reputation precedes you.
Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward stand side-by-side in
front of Social Services. She berates them:
SOCIAL SERVICES
You two are the most appallingly
incompetent custodial guardians Social
Services has ever had the misfortune to
ENCOUNTER --
(SHOUTING)
-- in a twenty-seven year career!
Captain Sharp and Scout Master Ward look sheepish. Social
Services says bitterly:
SOCIAL SERVICES
What do you have to say for yourselves?
Captain Sharp hesitates. He says strangely:
94.
CAPTAIN SHARP
You can't do this. They'll eat him alive
in there.
SOCIAL SERVICES
(HESITATES)
Where?
CAPTAIN SHARP
(aside, to Scout Master Ward)
What's the name of the place again?
SCOUT MASTER WARD
(HESITATES)
Juvenile refuge?
CAPTAIN SHARP
(HORRIFIED)
Juvenile refuge. That sounds like jail.
Silence. In the background, the acolyte picks up Panagle's
walking stick weapon off the floor. He stares at it, puzzled.
Social Services says carefully:
SOCIAL SERVICES
Just find the boy -- and deliver him --
(motioning to herself)
-- to Social Services. Nothing else is in
your power.
MR. BISHOP
(SHARPLY)
I'm sorry.
Social Services, Captain Sharp, and Scout Master Ward turn to
Mr. and Mrs. Bishop. Mr. Bishop looks tense.
MR. BISHOP
Can we get back to the rescue now?
MRS. BISHOP
(URGENTLY)
Suzy's still out there.
SOCIAL SERVICES
(FROWNING)
Who are you?
SCOUT MASTER WARD
Walt and Laura Bishop. Their daughter's
the missing girl.
SOCIAL SERVICES
The parents of the stabber?
95.
MRS. BISHOP
I object to that description. She was
attacked.
Commander Pierce appears with an oxygen mask over his face.
He pulls it aside briefly and says to Secretary McIntire:
COMMANDER PIERCE
I want the details. Where's the scout she
knifed?
SECRETARY MCINTIRE
Right here.
Secretary McIntire snaps his fingers and gives a signal.
Redford appears.
REDFORD
Field Mate Redford, sir.
COMMANDER PIERCE
(through the oxygen mask)
What's his condition?
SECRETARY MCINTIRE
He may suffer some limited chronic kidney
insufficiency. Here's the report.
Secretary McIntire hands Commander Pierce a doctor's report.
Mrs. Bishop snatches it and throws it over her shoulder.
MRS. BISHOP
We don't have time for this!
SCOUT MASTER WARD
She's right!
SOCIAL SERVICES
Let's go!
Social Services turns and starts up the aisle. She stops
suddenly. Captain Sharp is standing in their path brandishing
Panagle's walking stick weapon.
CAPTAIN SHARP
Nobody's going anywhere.
Everyone stops. Captain Sharp locks eyes with Social
Services. He says in a steely voice:
CAPTAIN SHARP
He's not getting shock therapy.
96.
Social Services looks furious. Her jaw sets. She reaches
inside her jacket and withdraws a small pad labelled Citation
Book.
SOCIAL SERVICES
That's it! I'm citing you for gross
misconduct! You are hereby summoned to
appear before the board of --
Captain Sharp looks enraged. He grits his teeth. He reaches
into his back pocket and withdraws a similar pad labelled
Boating Violations.
CAPTAIN SHARP
I'm writing you up back! Be notified that
you stand accused of the mistreatment and
IMPROPER --
SOCIAL SERVICES
(SCREAMING)
What are you talking about?
CAPTAIN SHARP
(SCREAMING)
I won't let you do it!
REDFORD
(SCREAMING)
Look!
Everyone looks. Redford is standing on a pew with his arm
stretched out pointing up at the choir loft in amazement. The
troop is there, but Sam's and Suzy's seats are empty.
There is a flash, a bang, and all the lights in the room go
out at once. People gasp. Candles flicker alight on
candlesticks. A back-up generator kicks into gear, humming,
and the room fills with a new, different light.
Captain Sharp says to himself:
CAPTAIN SHARP
They're gone.
MR. BISHOP
(CONFUSED)
Who?
MRS. BISHOP
(UNCERTAIN)
Suzy?
97.
CAPTAIN SHARP
(YELLING)
Sam?
SCOUT MASTER WARD
(SHOUTING)
Gadge! Lazy-eye! Skotak!
SOCIAL SERVICES
(REALIZING)
They're here?
Captain Sharp strides down the aisle. He shouts up to Skotak:
CAPTAIN SHARP
Where'd they go? Answer me!
Skotak hesitates. He and the rest of the troop all look up to
a small, rickety, attic door. It is slightly ajar above a
long, narrow ladder behind the pipes of the organ.
Captain Sharp bolts up the steps. Everyone follows him,
running.
Scout Master Ward says into the microphone:
SCOUT MASTER WARD
Scout Master's log. October tenth.
Reconstruction continues increasingly
ahead of schedule, which I attribute to a
particularly robust esprit de corps among
the troop. The latrine, however,
continues to present --
Scout Master Ward notices Skotak and a young boy with glasses
standing in the doorway. He says, off-mic:
103.
SCOUT MASTER WARD
Is this the new recruit?
SKOTAK
Yes, sir.
SCOUT MASTER WARD
What's his rank?
SKOTAK
He doesn't have one.
SCOUT MASTER WARD
(ENTHUSIASTICALLY)
Pigeon Scout! Let's get you a patch.
Scout Master Ward presses stop on his tape recorder and leads
Skotak and the young boy out of the tent. The narrator
CONTINUES:
NARRATOR
The coastal areas of New Penzance were
battered and changed forever.
INSERT:
The narrator's nautical chart. The cove is no longer
identified.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet was erased from the
map.
The landing at the top of the staircase. The portable record
player sits on the braided rug with the turntable spinning. A
child's voice says over the speaker:
104.
RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)
So you see, the composer Benjamin Britten
has taken the whole orchestra apart. Now
he puts it back together again in a
fugue.
Lionel, Murray, and Rudy lie on the floor on their stomachs,
propped up with their chins on their fists. They listen.
Suzy sits in a small armchair reading a book called The
Return of Auntie Lorraine. There is an illustration on the
cover of a leathery, old woman and a girl with a pony-tail
looking together into a crystal ball. The kitten scratches at
Suzy's feet.
Sam sits on a stool painting a picture at the small easel. He
wears a miniature version of Captain Sharp's short-sleeved
uniform with a black necktie and a baseball cap.
Mrs. Bishop's amplified voice booms from the bottom of the
STAIRS:
MRS. BISHOP (O.S.)
Suzy? Lionel, Murray, Rudy! Dinner!
Sam starts. Lionel, Murray, and Rudy look up from the record
player. Suzy is impassive. Mr. Bishop's voice takes over the
MEGAPHONE:
MR. BISHOP (O.S.)
Don't make us ask twice!
Lionel, Murray, and Rudy jump to their feet and race down the
stairs. Sam dashes to the window. He opens it, climbs out,
and disappears. Suzy closes her book and rises to her feet.
Sam's head pokes back up from below. He and Suzy lock eyes.
Sam smiles. He whispers to Suzy urgently:
SAM
See you tomorrow.
Suzy smiles back. Sam ducks away. Suzy goes over to the
window and looks out with her binoculars.
CUT TO:
A binocular shot of Sam dropping to the ground and running
across the back lawn, into the trees. He comes out on the
dirt road where Captain Sharp waits, sitting on the hood of
his station wagon, smoking a cigarette. They both get into
the car and drive off.
105.
Suzy lowers the binoculars. She pauses in front of the easel
and looks at the picture. She walks quietly away down the
stairs. The kitten follows her. The record continues to play
on the empty landing.
The camera moves in toward Sam's painting on the easel. It is
a watercolor landscape of Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet. The tent is
pitched on the beach, and Sam's and Suzy's clothes hang on
