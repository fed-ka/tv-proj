11INT.  4400 CENTER - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

      CLOSE on the face of JORDAN COLLIER -- he is serene, focused. 
      He responds to questions from an unseen TELEVISION REPORTER.

                                  REPORTER (O.S.)
                    Mr. Collier, you've been doing quite
                    a bit of press since your...

      A beat as the reporter searches for the best way to describe
      Collier's reappearance.  Collier supplies it for him.

                                    COLLIER
                      Resurrection?

                                  REPORTER (O.S.)
                    I suppose some people are calling
                    it that.  And in every interview,
                    you've been making the same
                      statement, over and over again...

                                    COLLIER
                    The war for the future will be fought
                    in the past.

                                  REPORTER (O.S.)
                    Exactly.  And by past, do you
                      mean...now?  Today?

                                    COLLIER
                    Yes.  It's our shared burden.

                                  REPORTER (O.S.)
                    And this war?  It's one between
                    4400's and non-4400's...

                                    COLLIER
                    No, not at all.  This is a war
                    between good and evil.  And it's
                    already started. 

      [NOTE: Collier's V.O. will continue over the following MOS
      scenes.]

22INT.  BALDWIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

      A riveted KYLE watches Collier's interview on television. 


                                                                (CONTINUED)THE 4400   "Terrible Swift Sword"   (SHOOTING SCRIPT)   06/30/06     2.

                                    COLLIER
                    Good people, 4400's and non-4400's
                    alike, have already made incredible
                      sacrifices, and know they may be
                    Called on to do even more in the
                    time ahead.

      TOM leans in from the kitchen, calling Kyle to dinner.  Kyle
      reluctantly heads into...

33INT.  BALDWIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

      ...Tom, ALANA, and Kyle sit down at the dinner table.  We
      can see on Tom's face how much he's enjoying having his family
      back together.  As dinner begins, Kyle looks past his father,
      his attention still focused on Collier's interview as it
      continues on the television in the other room.

                                    COLLIER (V.O.)
                    They are among the first to know
                    the cost of this struggle.

44EXT.  MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

      DIANA and BEN are among the exiting AUDIENCE.  They hold
      hands, looking definitely like a couple in the blush of a
      new relationship.  They kiss, then reluctantly part, walking
      to their separate cars.  When you're secretly dating your
      sister's ex, discretion trumps sleepovers.

                                    COLLIER (V.O.)
                    Because for better or worse, all
                    our lives are different now. 
                      Profoundly different.  Because that's
                    what wars do. 

55EXT.  RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

        A rust-edged sign tells us we're entering NEWFIELD,
      WASHINGTON, "Home of Washington's largest PETRIFIED TREE
      STUMP."  We PULL BACK to REVEAL a run-down gas station, just
      as the lighted sign goes dark -- closing up for the night. 
      TESS and KEVIN emerge from the gas station office and lock
      the door.  She takes his arm as they walk down the rural
      road.  Still fugitives, they've made some sort of life here.   

                                    COLLIER (V.O.)
                    They change us all.  But the stakes
                    are nothing less than the fate of
                    mankind.

66INT.  4400 CENTER - RICHARD'S SUITE - NIGHT

      A concerned RICHARD finishes dialing his phone, holds it to
      his ear.

                                    COLLIER (V.O.)
                    I've seen the future, and it is a
                    bleak one. 

77INT.  HASPELCORP LAB - NIGHT

      CLOSE ON a cell phone, Isabelle's -- on silent but flashing
      as it rings.  We PAN off the cell phone to ISABELLE'S FACE --
      she seems to be sleeping peacefully. 

                                    COLLIER (V.O.)
                    The human race is old, sick, dying.

      Isabelle's eyes slip open as we PULL BACK to reveal she's
      lying on an exam table.  She's hooked up to monitors and IV
      tubes -- going through the elaborate process that extracts
      promicin from her body.  The blinking phone catches her eyes. 
      She looks at it for a beat, but doesn't answer.

                                    COLLIER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    What's left of civilization is
                      controlled by a brutal and powerful
                    elite that have shut themselves off
                    inside the world's last city. 

      DENNIS RYLAND looks on as COLE, a lab technician, unscrews a
      full vial of glowing green promicin from a machine, and
      replaces it with an empty one.  Cole carries the filled vial
      out of the lab --

                                    COLLIER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    While the rest of humankind struggles
                    to survive in the surrounding
                      wasteland.

7A7AINT.  HASPELCORP - PROMICIN STORAGE AREA - NIGHT

      The room is filled with rows and rows of promicin vials. 
      We've seen it before, in Episode 9, "The Ballad of Kevin and
      Tess."  But now, there are even more racks filled with glowing
      vials. 

                                      REPORTER (V.O.)
                    Sounds pretty hopeless.

                                      COLLIER (V.O.)
                    Doesn't it?

99INT.  NTAC - OPS - NIGHT

      The wall of video screens all show Jordan Collier. 

                                    COLLIER
                    But there's always hope.  And it
                    rests with us.  We can change the
                    future, but we have to start now. 
                    Today.

      We PAN OFF the wall to a nearby desk, where the lights of a
      multi-line phone flash -- it's ringing, but no one's
      answering.  WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL GARRITY slumped in his
      chair, unconscious, or perhaps sleeping. 

                                    COLLIER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                      Everything the world must have to
                    survive, to prosper -- food, energy,
                    the resources of the planet -- are
                    already being gathered up and
                      controlled by a powerful and isolated
                    few.

      As we move through OPS we see that every agent in the place
      is slumped over at their workstations -- but there's no sign
      of violence.  It looks like everyone just fell asleep.

1010INT.  NTAC - SUBLEVEL PRISON - NIGHT

      Behind bullet-proof glass, guards sleep peacefully at their
      desks as rows of security monitors go unwatched. 

                                    COLLIER (V.O.)
                    This must stop.  We must stop it.

1111INT.  NTAC - PRISON CELL - NIGHT

        A baby-faced YOUTH sits on his prison bunk.  A title
      identifies him as BOYD GELDER, the young NOVA solder last
      seen in Episode 3, "Being Tom Baldwin." 

                                    COLLIER (V.O.)
                    But our enemies are strong, and
                    they grow stronger by the day. 
                    They will go to any lengths to
                    maintain their dominance.  

      Boyd turns as his CELL DOOR suddenly swings open.  Puzzled,
      he steps out into... THE 4400   "Terrible Swift Sword"   (BLUE REVSIONS)   07/04/06     5.



1212INT.  NTAC - PRISON CORRIDOR - NIGHT

      Boyd looks down the hall -- every cell door is open.  Other
      PRISONERS step out, all looking tentative.  Boyd notices a
      GUARD slumped over in his chair at the end of the hall. 

                                    COLLIER (V.O.)
                    To force us to remain on our current
                    path.  A path that will lead us
                    only to disaster.  To the
                      catastrophic future that awaits us. 

      A smile crosses Boyd's face as he realizes someone is helping
      them all escape.  He races down the hall, headed for the
      exit... 

1313INT.  4400 CENTER - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

      CLOSE ON Collier's face -- calm, hypnotic, as he finishes
      his interview.

                                    COLLIER
                    We must band together to fight the
                    evil amongst us.  An evil that would
                    destroy us all.  We won't have
                    another chance.

      And as the weight of Collier's prophecy lands, the screen
      GOES BLACK.  We PRELAP the sound of urgent voices and activity --

1414INT.  NTAC - OPS - MORNING

      HANDHELD as Diana walks through OPS -- it's chaos.  NTAC
      MEDICS tend to a dozen dazed and woozy AGENTS.  Diana
      approaches Garrity, in mid-conversation with Tom and JARVIS.

                                    GARRITY
                    I'm telling you, I don't know what
                    happened.  One minute I'm going
                    over the night bulletins with
                      Havemeyer, next thing I know I wake
                    up with drool all over my shirt and
                      Havemeyer's snoring in my ear.

                                  JARVIS
                    So you're saying the entire night
                    shift just fell asleep? 

                                    GARRITY
                    Fell asleep, passed out, I don't
                    remember.

                    Hey can I get some aspirin?  My
                    head's screaming over here.

14CONTINUED:14

      Garrity gets up, looking for a little medical TLC -- Diana,
      Tom, and Jarvis head for Jarvis' office.

                    What the hell's going on?

                                  JARVIS
                    Good question.  I've got a whole
                    building full of agents who can't
                    remember a damn thing.

                                  TOM
                    And while they were napping, every
                    member of the NOVA group in NTAC
                    custody walked out the front door.

                                  JARVIS
                    Walked, ran, flew.  No way of knowing
                    since they erased the security tapes
                    on the way out.

                                  DIANA
                    But every 4400 downstairs gets
                      injections of the promicin inhibitor. 
                    None of them could've used their
                    abilities to escape.

                                  TOM
                    They must have had help.  Someone
                    on the outside.  A 4400.

                                  JARVIS
                    More than one.  Someone to knock
                    our people out, another to disable
                    the security system...

                                  DIANA
                    Are we talking about sympathizers? 
                    Or members we never caught?

                                  TOMS
                    Does it even matter?  Either way,
                    it looks like someone in the NOVA
                    group is putting the band back
                    together again.

      Off this disturbing possibility --

1515INT. NTAC - JARVIS' OFFICE - DAY

      CLOSE ON a quarantine photo of a scowling, middle-aged 4400,
      on a computer monitor. 

                                  JARVIS (O.S.)
                    Paul Newbold, has the ability to
                    raise or lower body temperature.

      We PULL BACK to REVEAL Jarvis, Tom, and Diana huddled around
      the monitor.  Jarvis hits a key, and new quarantine photo
      appears -- this one of a smiling woman in her mid-twenties.

                                  JARVIS (CONT'D)
                    Tina Richardson, she wipes memories. 
                    She can make you forget what you
                    had for breakfast or she can erase
                    your entire life.

      Another photo -- this one we've seen before -- Boyd Gelder
      glowers from the monitor.

                                  TOM
                    And then there's my old friend Boyd
                    Gelder, who can take over your entire
                    life.  The ultimate impersonator.

                                  DIANA
                    Any one of these people is capable
                    of wreaking serious havoc.

                                  JARVIS
                    They've done it before.  We have to
                    assume someone broke them out so
                    they could do it again.  The NOVA

      hurry over.  As Tom opens the car door --

      The REPORTERS shout questions as Tom gets out of his car.

                                  REPORTER
                    Agent Baldwin?  Why won't your son
                    make a statement?

                                  REPORTER #2
                    Did someone pay him to shoot Jordan

                                  REPORTER #3
                    Did he always know Collier was alive?

      Ignoring them, Tom hurries past and heads for the house...

1919INT.  BALDWIN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

        Mid-conversation.  Tom has just updated Alana and Kyle about
      their new living situation.  Neither seems pleased.

                                  KYLE
                    So how long are we going to be stuck
                    in here?  A few days, a couple of
                    months?

                                  TOM
                    Hopefully not too long.  We caught
                    Boyd Gelder once.  We'll track him
                    down again.  In the meantime, you
                    need to stay close to home.  Don't
                    go anywhere unless it's absolutely
                      necessary.

      This is clearly not what Kyle wants to hear.  Alana tries to
      see the bright side.

                    It shouldn't be too bad.  After
                    all, you could still be in prison. 
                    I could still be living on the run. 
                    Compared to that, staying close to
                    home sounds kind of nice.  We get
                    to spend some time together.  Before
                    you know it, you'll be headed back
                    to school. 

                                  TOM
                    She has a point, Kyle.

      But Kyle doesn't show much interest in the offer.

                    You want to wait a semester, that's
                    up to you.  But I figured going
                    back to college might help things
                    get back to normal.

                                  KYLE
                    Normal?  Have you looked outside?

2020INT.  HASPELCORP - RYLAND'S OFFICE - DAY

      Ryland stands looking out the window of his office, a
      condescending half-smile on his face.

                                  RYLAND
                    I warned Nina Jarvis.  I told her
                    that NTAC was unprepared to deal
                    with the threat posed by these
                    people. 

      Ryland turns to reveal Tom and Diana, standing on the other
      side of his desk.

                                  RYLAND (CONT'D)
                    But did she listen?  No.  And this
                    is the result.  NTAC is literally
                    asleep at its desk while some of
                    the most dangerous 4400's on file
                    just stroll out the door. 

                                  TOM
                    We're talking about the NOVA group,
                    Dennis.  Violent terrorists.  This
                    isn't about the 4400.

                                  RYLAND
                    I think you would agree, that
                      distinction has become meaningless. 
                    Every 4400 has developed an ability. 
                    Which means every 4400 is a potential
                    enemy. 

                                  DIANA
                    My daughter is in fifth grade.  She
                    isn't anybody's enemy.

                                  RYLAND
                    Children grow up, Agent Skouris. 

      Tom and Diana hold back their anger, determined not to engage
      with Ryland. 

                                  TOM
                    Dennis, we don't know what NOVA is
                    planning.  But they have targeted
                    you before.  NTAC's ready to offer
                    you any protection, any resources
                    you might need. 

                                  RYLAND
                    That's very generous.

                    already made two attempts on my
                    life while NTAC was protecting me.

                                  TOM
                    Two unsuccessful attempts.

                                  RYLAND
                    Try not to sound so disappointed. 

      Ryland presses an intercom button on his phone.

                                  RYLAND (CONT'D)
                    Could you come in for a moment,

                    This time, I've arranged for my own
                    security.

      Tom and Diana turns as the door opens -- Isabelle steps in.

                                  ISABELLE
                    Hello.

                                  RYLAND
                    We were just discussing this newest
                    threat posed by the NOVA group.

                                  ISABELLE
                    There's no threat.  Not to you,
                    anyway.
                          (to Tom and Diana)
                    Not while I'm around. 

      Isabelle moves to Ryland.  And as Tom and Diana react to

                    At least now we know where she's

                                    RICHARD
                    Jordan should've talked to us first. 
                    Before he made her leave.  It's
                    like he delivered her straight to
                    Ryland.

                                  SHAWN
                    I'm not so sure about that.  If
                    she's the source of Ryland's
                    promicin, then they were working
                    together long before she left here.

      As that lands on Richard --

                                    RICHARD
                    I doubt that would work.  When my

                          (and then)

                    All her life, I've been struggling,

                    something to nurture.  Maybe I was
                    wasting my time.  Maybe it was never

                    I didn't have time to do a food
                    shop.  I thought we could just order
                      a pizza...

      Stepping into the room, Diana finds APRIL lying on the couch. 
      An empty quart of ice cream sits on her stomach.  A spoon
      protrudes from the container.

                    I left him five messages.

                    I just want him to know I forgive
                    him.  I probably just pushed things
                    too fast.  It's my fault.

                    April, sitting here blaming yourself,
                    it's not helping.  You need to get

                                  APRIL
                    Do you think he met someone else?

      That's the last question Diana wants to answer --

                    Go, take a shower, change your

                    I can't take a shower.  What if he
                    calls?  Here, answer my cell, okay?

      April holds out her cell phone.  Diana doesn't want to do
      it, but she takes the phone.

                                  DIANA
                    Sure.

      April gets up and heads for the guest room.

                          (from the next room)
                    I'm really sorry I ate all your ice
                    cream.

2424INT.  DIANA'S APARTMENT - MAIA'S ROOM - NIGHT

      We are CLOSE ON a PLAYSTATION PSP, decorated with Bratz
      stickers.  Thumbs punch the controls.  We PULL BACK to REVEAL
      MAIA, focused and playing hard.

                                  DIANA (O.S.)
                    I thought we had a deal.

      ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Diana coming into the room.  She looks
      disapprovingly as she walks to the bed.  Maia doesn't look
      up, doesn't stop playing.

                                  DIANA (CONT'D)
                    No video games until after dinner.
                          (and then)
                    Maia...

                                  MAIA
                    I needed a break.

                                  DIANA
                    From what?

                                  MAIA
                    Aunt April. 

                                  DIANA
                    I'm sorry, sweetie. 

                                  MAIA
                    She hasn't stopped from the second
                    I got home from school.  She keeps
                    asking me if they're going to get
                    back together.  If I had any visions
                    about it.

      Just when Diana thought she couldn't feel worse -- she sits
      down on the bed.

                                  DIANA
                    Maia, you have to go easy on Aunt
                    April.  She's having a really rough
                    time.

                                  MAIA
                    But you and Ben.  You're supposed
                    to be together.  Maybe if you told
                    her about what I saw?

                                  DIANA
                    Somehow, I don't think that's going
                    to make it any better.

                                  MAIA
                    Well, she's going to know about you
                    guys sooner or later.  I mean you're
                    going to invite her to the wedding,
                    right?

      Off Diana -- not ready to deal with that possibility just
      yet. 

2525INT.  4400 CENTER - COLLIER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

      Collier sits behind his desk, admiring DEVON, who poses for
      him.  It's a bizarre image, [and, as we'll soon find out,
      it's meant to be.]

                                  DEVON
                    So what do you think?

                                    COLLIER
                    You look...remarkable.  I'm
                      impressed.

                                  SHAWN (O.S.)
                    Jordan?

      Collier and Devon turn to see Shawn and Richard, standing in
      the doorway.

                                    RICHARD
                    Are we interrupting something?

                    Not at all.  Come on in.
                          (off their faces)
                    Is everything all right?

                                  SHAWN
                    Not really.  We just talked to my
                    Uncle Tom.  He told us Isabelle and
                    Dennis Ryland are working together.

      Shawn and Richard wait for a reaction from Collier, but they
      get nothing.

                                    COLLIER
                    I see.

                                  SHAWN
                    Jordan, did you hear what I just
                    said?  Kicking Isabelle out of here,
                    it might not have been the right
                    move.

                                    COLLIER
                    As long as Isabelle was here she
                    was a threat.  Her alliance with
                    Dennis Ryland just makes it clear
                    to everyone where her loyalties
                    lie.  And clarity's a good thing,
                    don't you think?

                                    RICHARD
                    But we still have to make some
                      preparations around this place. 
                    Just to be safe.  It's not only
                    Isabelle and Ryland out there.  We
                    also have the NOVA group to worry
                    about.

                                    COLLIER
                    The NOVA group is nothing for us to
                    be concerned about.

      Shawn can barely contain his disbelief.

                                  SHAWN
                    How can you say that?  They tried
                    to kill me.

                                    COLLIER
                    The NOVA group is not our enemy.
                          (to Devon)
                    Isn't that right?

      Shawn and Richard turn to Devon -- but in her place stands
      BOYD GELDER.

                                  BOYD
                    Not anymore.

                                    COLLIER
                    Shawn, Richard.  I don't think you've
                    ever met Boyd Gelder.

      Maybe not, but they certainly know who he is.

                                  SHAWN
                    What the hell is one of the NOVA
                    doing here?

                                    COLLIER
                    He's a 4400, Shawn.  Where else
                    should he be?  Besides, I went to a
                    great deal of trouble to get him
                    and his friends out of NTAC.

      And off the Collier's casual but shocking admission --

      FADE IN.

2626INT. 4400 CENTER - COLLIER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

      Boyd is gone -- Shawn, Richard, and Collier clearly have a
      lot to talk about.  An agitated Shawn paces the room.  He
      can't believe what he just heard. 

                                  SHAWN
                    Jordan, this is crazy.  I put my
                    life on the line trying to protect
                    this place from the NOVA group. 
                    And now we're the ones who break
                    them out of NTAC?  What were you
                    thinking?

                                    COLLIER
                    We've got a war to fight here.  And
                    NOVA's a powerful weapon.  A weapon
                    that up until now has lacked proper
                    guidance.  Leadership.

                                  SHAWN
                    They're terrorists, Jordan.  They
                    kill people.  I don't think lack of
                    direction is their biggest problem.

                                    COLLIER
                    They did what needed to be done. 
                    They chose action over accommodation. 
                    Your failure to support that choice
                    was a mistake. 

                                  SHAWN
                    You're saying I screwed up by not
                    backing the NOVA group?

                                    COLLIER
                    I'm saying you should've been a
                    leader. 
                          (and then)
                    These people are willing to sacrifice
                      themselves for the greater good. 
                    Those are the kind of soldiers we
                    need in this fight.

      Shawn takes a beat, approaches Collier -- he fights back the
      anger and frustration he's feeling.  Collier's still his
      mentor, Shawn still believes in him.

                                  SHAWN
                    Jordan, listen to me, please.  The
                    things the NOVA group has done,
                    they're a big reason why people are
                    scared of us.  If we let them in
                    here,  then we become the NOVA group. 
                    And everything you've been preaching
                    since you've been back?  About unity. 
                    About cooperation between 4400's
                    and non-4400's.  It's never going
                    to happen.

      Collier considers Shawn for a beat, then turns his gaze
      towards Richard.

                                    COLLIER
                    Is that what you think, Richard?

      Shawn looks to Richard, expecting his support.  After a long
      moment --

                                    RICHARD
                    We're running a big risk here,
                    Jordan.

                                    COLLIER
                    We're playing for big stakes.

                                    RICHARD
                    If NTAC finds out we were involved
                    in the breakout, it'll be bad.
                          (and then)
                    You're sure you covered your tracks? 
                    They're someplace safe?

      Shawn stares at Richard in shocked confusion -- this isn't
      the reaction he was expecting from his friend. 

                                    COLLIER
                      Absolutely.  Along with the 4400's
                    who helped free them.  They won't
                    be found.

                                  SHAWN
                    That makes it all right?  We might
                    not get caught?  Richard, you're
                    not buying into this, are you?

                                    RICHARD
                    I'm being realistic.  The fact is,
                    we're more vulnerable than ever. 
                      Isabelle's with Ryland now.

2727EXT.  MILITARY BASE - DAY

      In the distance, through a heat shimmer, we see a squad of
      shirtless SOLDIERS running cross-country.  We hear:

                                  RYLAND (O.S.)
                    Another month?  That's unacceptable.

      We PULL BACK to REVEAL Ryland and Isabelle and Haspelcorp
      scientist DR. ELLSWORTH standing outside the base's medical
      center.  A perimeter fence, topped with barbed wire, stretches
      off in the distance.

                                  RYLAND (CONT'D)
                    The initial volunteers were showing
                    abilities within days.

                                  DR. ELLSWORTH
                    That's correct.  But as you recall,
                    there were problems.  Deaths.  Since
                    the Piersahl incident, we've scaled
                    back the pace of the promicin
                      injections.

                                  RYLAND
                    I never approved any such thing.  I
                    promised this country the protection
                    of enhanced soldiers.  And I will
                    not be made a liar by you.
                          (and then)
                    Increase the dosage.

                                  DR. ELLSWORTH
                    I'll have another shipment of
                    promicin sent over from Haspelcorp

                    You're a very powerful young woman,
                    Isabelle.  But you are still just
                    one person.  Think of them as back

                    All right.  If it makes you feel
                    more secure.  But by now, Collier

                      abilities?

      Kyle and Shawn embrace warmly, two old friends who haven't
      seen each other in a while.  They've both been through a lot
      in the intervening time.  But that only makes them happier
      to see one another.  As they separate...

                                  SHAWN
                    Look at you.  You look great.

                    You know what they say.  Nothing to
                    do in prison but lift weights.

      The mention of prison stops Shawn for an uncomfortable beat.

                                  SHAWN
                    Well you're out now.  I can't believe
                    you're standing here.  We have to
                    do something.  Celebrate.  To be
                    honest, I could use a little time
                    away from this place. 

                                  KYLE
                    Sounds good, but first I need a
                    favor.

                    Name it.

2929INT.  4400 CENTER - COLLIER'S OFFICE - DAY

      Kyle, feeling self-conscious, stands before Collier.

                                    COLLIER
                    It's good to see you Kyle.  I was
                    hoping we could talk.

      Kyle approaches Collier with something like reverence.  It's
      as if he can't quite believe the man standing before him is
      real.

                                  KYLE
                    It's really you, isn't it?  You're
                    alive.

      Kyle tentatively extends his hand and touches Collier on the
      shoulder.  Collier smiles.

                                    COLLIER
                    It took me a while to believe it
                    myself.

      Kyle removes his hand -- his eyes have begun to tear.

                                  KYLE
                    I'm sorry.  For what I did to you.

                                    COLLIER
                    There's nothing to be sorry about. 
                    My death -- had to happen.

                                  KYLE
                    I've seen you on TV.  You seem so
                    sure that what we went through means
                      something.  I wish I could understand
                    it the way you do.  To me, it all
                    seems like a waste.

                                    COLLIER
                    It's wasn't.  My death was part of
                    a bigger plan. 
                          (and then)
                    I know you've suffered for it, and
                    that wasn't fair.  But everything 
                    you've done, including the shooting,
                    is all part of that plan.  You have
                    no idea how important you are.

                                  KYLE
                    My dad wants me to go back to school. 
                    I was on my way to register for
                    classes.  But, I don't know, I didn't
                    make it.  I came to see you instead.

                                    COLLIER
                    I'm glad you did.
                          (and then)
                    You're always welcome here.

      Kyle smiles -- for the first time, he feels truly innocent
      of any crime.  It feels good.

3030INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

      Diana and Ben lie back in bed, having just made love.  Their
      breathing has hardly quieted.  Diana settles herself against
      Ben's chest.  He studies her face --

                                  BEN
                    Tell me we're going to spend the
                    whole night together.

      But Diana's romantic mood has quickly faded -- she has other
      things on her mind.

                                  DIANA
                    I think Maia should be there when I
                    tell her.  Then she can explain the
                    whole prediction thing. 

                                  BEN
                    So much for afterglow.
                          (and then)
                    Please tell me you weren't thinking
                    about April the whole time.

                                  DIANA
                    No.  I wasn't.  That kind of makes
                    me feel worse.

                                  BEN
                    You're right, we have to tell her.
                          (and then)
                    I'll do it.  She should hear it
                    from me.

                                  DIANA
                    I'd wish that was true.  But it
                    would be like I'm hiding behind
                    you.  Which I admit sounds good
                    right now.  But I'd only hate myself
                    even more.
                          (and then)
                    I just wish I knew what to say.

                                  BEN
                    Tell her the truth.  We didn't plan
                    this.  We didn't even want it.  But
                    it happened.  We fell in love.

      The words hangs out there for a moment --

                                  DIANA
                    Isn't it a little early to be using
                    that word?

                                  BEN
                    What would you call it?

      Diana puzzles over this for a beat, then realizes the terrible
      truth --

                                  DIANA
                    Oh God.  It's true.  Two weeks and
                    we're in love.

                                  BEN
                    Diana, that's a good thing.

                                  DIANA
                    I know it is.  Or at least it should
                    be.
                          (and then)
                    I'm in love and I can't even enjoy
                    it.  How pathetic is that?

                    When he first came to school, he

                    NOVA cell operating out of the

      Shawn stops and considers this for a long beat -- should he

                    They still might.  We don't know

                      I appreciate this, Shawn.  It really
                    helps to have someone here we can
                    work with.  I hope that doesn't

                    Michael Lawrence's ability is both

                    Because he's a sixteen year old
                    kid, and you just turned him into a
                    felon. 

                                    COLLIER
                    Shawn, we needed to neutralize a
                    building full of NTAC agents.  That
                    boy allowed us to accomplish that
                    goal, without hurting anyone.  I
                    thought I showed great restraint,
                    given the urgency of our needs.

                                  SHAWN
                    What needs, Jordan?  What's so
                    important that we need to get into
                    bed with the NOVA group?
                          (and then)
                    I ran this place while you were
                    gone.  I deserve to know what you're
                    planning.

      Collier stops, turns to Shawn.  Considers him for a beat --

                                    COLLIER
                    Fair enough. 
                          (and then)
                    We're going to destroy Ryland's
                    enhanced soldier program.

                                  SHAWN
                    Destroy, how?

                                    COLLIER
                    With NOVA's help, we're going to
                    attack the army base where the
                      experiment's being conducted.  We're
                    going to take out the lab, the
                    training facility...and when we
                    find the soldiers who are getting
                    promicin, we'll neutralize them.

      Shawn stares at Collier in disbelief -- Jordan's plan is
      more dangerous, more aggressive, than even he had feared.

                                  SHAWN
                    Jordan.  Attacking a military
                      installation?  Are you insane? 
                    Because that's how you sound.  I
                    don't care what you think you saw
                    while you were gone, but this is
                    the real world.  Do you know how
                    many people would die?  On both
                    sides.  We can't do this.

                                    COLLIER
                    We don't have a choice.  Once those
                    soldiers develop 4400 abilities, it
                    will be too late.

      And as Shawn reacts to Collier's cold determination --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

      And there sits the man himself -- Collier, seated across
      from an elderly gentleman.  A TITLE introduces him as LEWIS
      MESIROW, DISAPPEARED APRIL 19, 1955.  Mesirow is concentrating
      deeply, eyes closed, his head tilted back.

                                    MESIROW
                    There's a gas station.  It's on a
                    highway.  Next to it is a roadsign.

                                    COLLIER
                    Can you read it?

                                    MESIROW
                    I'm trying.  Something about...a
                    petrified tree stump.  The biggest
                    one in the state.
                          (he opens his eyes)
                    Afraid that's all of it.

                                    COLLIER
                    That should be enough to find them.

                                    MESIROW
                    Hope so.  That's the thing with
                    this remote viewing, I never quite
                    see everything.  But hell, at 76,
                    I'm lucky to be able to see anything.

                                    COLLIER
                    Thank you for sharing your gift,
                    Mr. Mesirow. 

3737EXT.  GAS STATION - DAY

      A car hood SLAMS.  Kevin Burkoff, wearing a mechanic's
      jumpsuit, wipes his greasy hands as he walks to the driver's
      side window.

                                  KEVIN
                    Let's see, gas plus the quart of
                    oil comes to fifty-three even.

      The DRIVER hands him the cash.

                                  KEVIN (CONT'D)
                    Hope you're going to take some time
                    and visit Newfield's claim to fame. 
                    There's not another stump like it
                    on the whole west coast.

                                  DRIVER
                    We're just passing through.  So I
                    go back the way I came to find the
                    highway?

      Kevin waves to the office.  Tess steps out, heads over.

                                  KEVIN
                    She can help you with that.
                          (to Tess)
                    He wants to get right back on the
                    highway.

                                  TESS
                    That's easy.  But first I really
                    think you should visit the Newfield
                    stump.  There's a very nice gift
                    shop there.  T-shirts, snow globes. 
                    The town would sure appreciate your
                    business.

      The Driver considers Tess' words for a beat -- her ability
      is working on him, but it's like he's coming up with the
      idea himself.

                                  DRIVER
                    Yeah.  Just follow the sign?

                                  TESS
                    That's right.  And there's a nice
                    diner along the way.  All the pies
                    are baked fresh.

                                  DRIVER
                    I'll check it out.  Thanks.

                                  KEVIN
                    You won't be disappointed.

      The driver waves, and pulls away. 

                                  KEVIN (CONT'D)
                    Those pies come in on a truck.

      He kisses her cheek.  A limousine pulls into the parking
      lot, probably the first time in the history of this gas
      station.  The back passenger door opens, and out steps Jordan
      Collier.  He approaches Kevin and Tess, who recognize him
        immediately.

                          (and then)
                    I'm betting this isn't a coincidence.

                    No.  It's not.  How's your research
                    coming along?

                    Mr. Collier, we've made a really
                    nice life for ourselves.  This is a
                    good place for us, and we like to
                    think we've made things a little
                    better by being here.  Please don't
                    ruin it.

                                    COLLIER
                    If it were up to me, you'd live
                    happily here for many years. 
                          (and then, to Kevin)
                    But right now, I need your
                      intellect...
                          (to Tess)
                    ...and your ability. 
                          (and then)
                    I'm afraid it's time for the two of
                    you to get back to work.

      Off Tess and Kevin, knowing that their little respite has
      come to an end.

4040INT.  BALDWIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

      Tom leans in the doorway.  Kyle packs up a box with some
      childhood keepsakes -- old books, trophies, posters. 

                                  TOM
                    Hey buddy.  Got a second?

                                  KYLE
                    Yeah, just getting rid of some old
                    stuff.

      Tom casually looks into the box, pulls out an old trophy. 
      Looks at Kyle as if to say, "You're getting rid of this?"

                                  KYLE (CONT'D)
                    Come on, Dad.  I was nine when I
                    got that.

                                  TOM
                    Yeah.  I remember the day.
                          (and then)
                    Listen, Kyle.  Once you go back to
                    school, I thought I'd float you
                    some cash.  So you can get your own
                    place.  That way you can have some
                    privacy, some independence.  You
                    can always come here to do your
                    laundry.

                                  KYLE
                    I saw Jordan Collier yesterday.

                                  TOM
                    You went to the Center?  Why?

                                  KYLE
                    I needed to see him.  We talked, he
                    helped me realize some things. 

                                  TOM
                    What things?

                                  KYLE
                    I'm not going back to college for
                    one.

      Kyle lifts his hand, stopping Tom --

                                  KYLE (CONT'D)
                    Dad, wait.  Hear me out.  My life,
                    my future, it's tied up with the
                    4400.

                                  TOM
                    That's not true. 

                                  KYLE
                    Yes it is.  That night on the beach,
                    when Shawn was taken, it should've
                    been me.  If he hadn't pushed me
                    out of that beam of light, I would've
                    been one of them. 

                                  TOM
                    But you're not.  Kyle, your life
                    can be whatever you want it to be. 
                    You just have to be willing to move
                    forward.

                                  KYLE
                    Ever since I woke up from that coma,
                    I thought I was moving forward. 
                    But Jordan helped me realize that
                    all I was doing was running away.

                                  TOM
                    He told you that?  He told you not
                    to go to college?

                                  KYLE
                    No, Dad.  He just listened.  I
                    figured it out on my own.

                                  TOM
                    So what do you do now?  Put on a
                    blue blazer and become one of his
                      disciples?  Give tours of the Center? 
                    Answer phones?

                                  KYLE
                    Maybe.  I'm going to do what you
                    do, Dad.  I'm going to help the
                    4400.  Any way I can. 

      Off Tom, not sure how to counter that particular argument.

                                    RICHARD
                    Maybe so.  But it seems to me we've

                      threatened by.  All Jordan's doing

                    Yeah, and we're going to lose.

                    I didn't think so.

      Richard walks away, leaving behind a defeated Shawn.  But

                    So you're saying Shawn made all

                                    COLLIER
                    I told you a story.  To see if you

4545EXT.  ARMY BASE - SECLUDED SPOT - DAY

      Tom and Diana are in mid-conversation with Ryland and

                                  RYLAND
                    So you're saying, in spite of
                    Collier's denials, this base may
                    still be the target of a NOVA attack?

                                  TOM
                    It's possible, yes.

                                  RYLAND
                    And you came all this way to warn
                    me?  I'm touched.

                                  TOM
                    Just doing my job, Dennis.  It was
                    nothing personal.

                                  DIANA
                    Anyway, Collier knows you're here,
                    which means this place is no longer
                    secure.  Your little experiment
                    needs a new home.

                                  ISABELLE
                    Why?  I say let them come.
                          (to Ryland)
                    If Collier wants a fight, we'll
                    give him one.

      Ryland smiles in approval.

                                  RYLAND
                    She's right.  Collier talks a good
                    game, all about unity.  How we all
                    have to work together to save the
                    future.  And people actually believe
                    he means it.  Pathetic.
                          (and then)
                    But an attack will finally expose
                    him and the 4400 for what they really
                    are.  The enemy.
                          (and then)
                    You see, Tom.  I was right all along. 
                    It comes down to survival.  Us
                    against them.

                                  TOM
                    You sure you want to be at ground
                    zero for this one, Dennis?

                          (and then)

                    How did it feel, turning your back
                    on me?

      ANGLE TO REVEAL Collier as he approaches Shawn.

                                  SHAWN
                    I was trying to save lives. 
                    Including yours.  Maybe if you had
                    told me everything, treated me with
                    a little respect, we could've worked
                    things out.  But you were too busy
                      manipulating me.  Like always. 
                          (and then)
                    You know Jordan, I ran this place
                    while you were gone.  And I did a
                    pretty good job of it.  But now
                    you're back.  And you and I?  It's
                    like nothing's changed.  You're
                    making all the decisions and I'm
                    playing catch-up.  Five steps behind. 

                                    COLLIER
                    Used to be ten.

      But if that's meant to be a compliment, it's not enough to
      appease Shawn.

                                    COLLIER (CONT'D)
                    Shawn.  I need you to trust me. 
                    Believe in me.

                                  SHAWN
                    You know what I think, Jordan? 
                    This whole messiah thing has gone
                    to your head.

                                    COLLIER
                    You're wrong.  I'm no messiah.  I'm
                    more like John Brown.

                    John Brown?  The guy who tried to
                    free the slaves?

                                    COLLIER
                    He surrounded himself with men who
                    believed as he did.  Who were willing
                    to do anything for their cause. 
                    That kind of devotion can change
                    the world.

                                  SHAWN
                    They killed John Brown.

                                    COLLIER
                    They killed me, too.

      Off Shawn -- how much faith does he still have in Jordan
      Collier?  

4747INT. HASPELCORP - LOBBY - DAY

      Shoes click on the marble floor -- quick, definite strides. 
      ANOTHER ANGLE reveals Ryland crossing the lobby, his face
      serious -- a man on a mission. 

4848INT.  HASPELCORP - LAB - DAY

      Lab techs study test samples, running them through the network
      of analyzers and other equipment.  Ryland enters, approaches
      COLE, the senior lab tech on duty.

                                  COLE
                    Mr. Ryland.  I was told we wouldn't
                    be seeing you for a while.

                                  RYLAND
                    We have a security situation.  NTAC
                      intelligence believes that Jordan
                    Collier is planning to move against
                    us.  I want to transfer all the
                    promicin out of Haspelcorp for
                      safekeeping.  I want every vial
                    packed up and ready for shipment as
                    soon as possible.

      Ryland's tone leaves no room for discussion. 

                                  COLE
                    Yes, sir...

      Fifteen minutes later.  Ryland walks beside Cole, who drives
      an electric pallet hauler loaded high with racks of promicin
      vials.  Ryland pushes open the double doors, into --

5050INT./EXT.  HASPELCORP - LOADING DOCK - DAY

      Ryland steps in, followed by Cole and the load of promicin. 
      TWO ARMED GUARDS sit at a desk, in front of a security
      monitor.  Ryland waves them over.

                                  RYLAND
                    Give us a hand with this.

      The guards leave their desk, head over to help.  ANGLE OVER
      the security monitors as the Guards direct Cole as he steers
      the heavy pallet hauler across the loading dock to the huge
      roll-up metal doors.  The Guards appear on the monitors as
      they step into the view of the security cameras -- Cole, the
      promicin --

      Looking across the room, we see Ryland join them -- BUT ON
      THE MONITOR, RYLAND IS BOYD GELDER.  He has been using his
      ability to impersonate Ryland since he walked into Haspelcorp. 
      One of the Guards turns a key in a switchbox, and the door
      rises to reveal...

      ...Richard, Kevin, and Tess.  They all stand on the loading
      dock just outside the door.  Two large trucks sit parked in
      the driveway behind them.

                                    RICHARD
                    Thanks.  We'll take it from here.

                    He wanted to divert our attention

                                  TOM
                    You had enough stored here to create
                    a whole army of enhanced soldiers.

                                  RYLAND
                    Before Collier's through, you're
                    going to wish you had that army to
                    protect you. 

                                  DIANA
                    I wonder what he's going to do with
                    all that promicin?

                                  RYLAND
                    Destroy it.  He wants to make sure
                    no one else develops abilities.  He
                    wants to keep us weak.  So we can't
                    fight back.

                                  RYLAND
                    Collier's a fanatic.  He's capable
                    of anything.  You'll see.

                    We're not going to destroy it.

      A moment of silent disbelief -- they all look to Collier.

                                  SHAWN (O.S.)
                    All right.  I'll ask the question.

      They turn see Shawn, having just entered the hangar.  Collier
      gives him a welcoming smile -- his prodigal son has returned.

                                  SHAWN (CONT'D)
                    What are we going to do with
                    seventeen thousand four hundred and
                      thirty-two units of promicin?

                                    COLLIER
                    We're going to give it away.

                                    RICHARD
                    To who?

      We push in on Collier's face --

                                    COLLIER
                    To everyone. 

                                                                      SMASH TO BLACK:

                                        END OF SHOW
