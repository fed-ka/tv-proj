11EXT. BAGHDAD VILLA - GARDENS/TERRACE/PARTY AREA - 
        EVENING 1, 2031

      1979. A summer s night in Baghdad; the grounds of a 
        large, opulent villa. Glimpse CHILDREN fleetingly as 
      they chase one another through bushes and disappear 
        leaving only the sound of their laughter.

      Find a LITTLE GIRL, creeping, hiding; when suddenly the 
        camera rushes up on her! The LITTLE GIRL is snatched 
      and lifted into the air by big, strong hands; she 
        squeals in delight. The OWNER of the big hands (SADDAM) 
        laughs and bites at her tummy making her laugh more. 
      The simple joy is interrupted by a man s voice.

                                        BARZAN
                      Saddam?

        SADDAM HUSSEIN (40) holds his daughter, HALA, and looks 
      to the man, BARZAN (28).

                                        BARZAN (CONT D)
                      Ready when you are.

        SADDAM nods.

                                        SADDAM
                              (to his DAUGHTER)
                      Baba has work to do; let s find Mama.

      HALA grabs hold of her father s neck and protests. 
        SADDAM (and HALA) and BARZAN move towards the villa.

      On to the terrace; it s a party; an important party; a 
        child s birthday party, yet the ADULTS are decked out 
      in Chanel, Dior and gaudy but expensive jewellery.

        GUESTS smile at SADDAM seeking approval. He finds his 
      wife, SAJIDA, and hands over HALA.

                                        SADDAM (CONT D)
                      I believe this child belongs to you.
                              (eye contact with SAJIDA)

                                        SAJIDA
                      What time will he be here?

                                        SADDAM
                      Soon.

        SADDAM and BARZAN move into the villa.

                                        SAJIDA (O.O.V)
                                (gathering the children)
                      Children. Children come to me, we are 
                      going to play a game.

22INT. BAGHDAD VILLA - CORRIDOR/SADDAM S STUDY - EVENING 
      1, 2032

        Marble floors and expensive furnishings. WAITERS flash 
      past carrying food and drinks to the terrace. We move 
        through the villa leaving the party behind.

        SADDAM and BARZAN move along a dimly lit but ornate 
        corridor, the party music fades...and is replaced by 
      the sound of an Ayatollah in full flow - an initially 
      faint but forceful VOICE of a determined old-man 
        speaking in Farsi:praising Allah, the revolution and 
      his people; denouncing the Shah, America and the 
        infidels of Iraq s Baath Party. 

                                        BARZAN
                                (easy; about the voice)
                      Khomeini has a big mouth.

        SADDAM smiles and put his hand on BARZAN S shoulder. At 
      the bottom of a corridor is a set of double doors - the 
      VOICE is emanating from behind these doors.

      The brothers move to the doors and enter...

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. BAGHDAD VILLA - SADDAM S STUDY - EVENING 1, 203333

        SADDAM enters and finds SEVERAL smartly suited MEN, 
        seated in armchairs around a long low-table. The MEN 
        occasionally sip from tumblers of whiskey and ice.

      The RECORDED VOICE of Ayatollah Khomeini fills the 
      room; the gathered men listen as Khomeini berates Iraq 
      and its leaders and urges the Shias of the south to 
        rise-up (like their brothers in Iran) and overthrow 
        Satan s government.

      See the studious faces of the gathered MEN: TARIQ AZIZ 
      (43), HAMDANI (42), ADNAN KHAIRRALLAH (38) and ALI 
        HASSAN AL MAJID (CHEMICAL ALI, (38)) as they listen to 
      the VOICE which threatens their country and their 
        power.

      The mood of the meeting is relaxed but serious. BARZAN 
        closes the door behind them and moves to turn off the 
      TV.

                                        SADDAM
                      Heard enough?

                                        CHEMICAL ALI
                      More than enough. He s a dog - bark, 
                      bark, bark, all day long; every day. BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 3

                                        SADDAM
                                (calm, easy; everyone 
                                listens)

                      We can offer a hand of friendship but 
                      he will bite it off. He wants his 
                      revolution to infect all of the Arab 
                      world.

                      Beginning with the Iraqi Shia.

                                        SADDAM 
                      Exactly... He will become more 
                      dangerous by the day... And if Al 
                      Bakr s treaty with Syria proceeds...he 
                      will scent Iraqi weakness.
                                (pause)
                      America hopes for a strong Iraq; the 
                      Arab world demands it, and the Iraqi 
                      people themselves deserve it.
                                (pause)
                      But time is running out...

      See the faces of the gathered MEN. SADDAM picks up a 
      glass of Shivas Regal, poured for him by BARZAN.

                                        SADDAM (CONT D)

      The OTHERS join the toast. See TARIQ AZIZ raise his 
      glass and join in the toast.

      INT. CAMP CROPPER - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY A, 120044

        A large cage in a windowless room. Inside, leaning 
        casually against the cage, is a clean-cut Defense 
        Intelligence Agency CASE OFFICER, (35). The CASE 
        OFFICER watches as the manacles are removed from a 
        PRISONER, then he dismisses the DETAIL with a nod.

      There is a deck of cards on the table, in front of the 
        PRISONER - now revealed to be an owlish TARIQ AZIZ, 67. 
      He is pale, shrunken, a grey little man. BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 4



      The CASE OFFICER picks up the deck of cards and turns 
      the first few cards over, flicking the faces out in 
      front of the TARIQ.

                                        TARIQ AZIZ 
                                (watches; then)
                      Do you consider the invasion of my 
                      country a game?

                                        CASE OFFICER
                      We are going to find each and every 
                      card; every face, and you are going to 
                      help us... starting with Saddam

      TARIQ looks down at the over-turned cards: see Saddam, 
      Ali Hassan Al Majid (Chemical Ali), Barzan, Watban, 
      Uday, Qusay and Tariq himself.

                                        TARIQ AZIZ 
                                (teases gently)
                      Then I must merit more than an eight.

        Pause, TARIQ considers the cards. He pulls Saddam to 
      the centre. Then Chemical Ali alongside.

                      He will be pleased that you consider 
                      him to be a King.

                      Barzan Ibrahim on the other hand, will 
                      think you mad; as will Watban Ibrahim. 
                      Surely Saddam s brothers are worth 
                      more the a five?

                      the Ibrahims, as you say, are his half-
                      brothers, his mother s sons... The Al 
                      Majids, are Saddam s cousins, the

                      They weren t loyal just because they 
                      were family; they were loyal because

        HAMDANI and SANAA (HAMDANI S wife) are overseeing a 
      game of musical chairs for the children. The GUESTS are 
        gathered around.

        SADDAM pours a tall glass of lemonade. SAJIDA

        RAGHAD passes HUSSEIN KAMEL, who gives her a broad 
        smile. RAGHAD blushes. SUBHA watches.

                      it is an important occasion!

      They are moving into the villa.


      INT. BAGHDAD VILLA - TERRACE/PARTY AREA - NIGHT1, 210577

      The party applaud the PRESIDENT, AL BAKR as he enters 
      the arena flanked by SADDAM, SAJIDA and further back 
      the BODYGUARDS.

                                        AL BAKR
                              (to the room)
                      Please everybody carry on. Where is 
                      the birthday-girl. I can t see her?

      HALA is standing proudly in the centre of the room.

                                        SAJIDA
                      She is here.

                                        AL BAKR
                      Where?

                                        HALA
                      Here.

                                        AL BAKR
                      Where? All I see is a grown-up 
                      Princess, where is little Hala.

                                        HALA
                                (beaming)
                      Amo Ahmed, it is me!

                                        AL BAKR
                      No.

                                        HALA
                                (laughing)
                      Yes.

      The room share the joke.

                                        AL BAKR
                      Then this gift must be yours Princess.

      He hands the gift to HALA.

                                        SADDAM 
                      You are very kind.

        SADDAM scoops her up in his arms.BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 8



                                        SADDAM (CONT D)
                      And you are very lucky. What do we say 
                      to the President?

                                        HALA
                      Thank you, Amo Ahmad.

        SAJIDA claps her hands and the lights are dimmed.

                                        AL BAKR
                              (mock shock, to HALA)
                      Ah, what s happening Princess? What is 
                      it?

        A chorus of Happy Birthday begins as an elaborate cake 
      is wheeled in. The cake moves past a sullen looking 
      boy, UDAY HUSSEIN, 15, (SADDAM S eldest son).

      AL BAKR and SADDAM, still with HALA in his arms, stand 
      side by side. The candles light their faces in an eerie 
      glow.

        A singing circle forms around the cake; UDAY remains 
        outside the circle. He has a cane in his hand which he 
      uses to lift the dress of a YOUNG GIRL - who turns her 
      head and instinctively brushes down her rising dress 
      with her hand. UDAY responds by slapping her hand with 
      the cane. The YOUNG GIRL doesn t cry out.

      The incident is witnessed by a the GIRL S MOTHER, who 
      looks at UDAY then looks away, distressed (continuing 
      with the Happy Birthday song). Once again, UDAY lifts 
      the dress of the GIRL, who this time does nothing. Her 
      eyes fill.

      The birthday song finishes.

                                        SAJIDA
                      Make a wish habibiti, and your dreams 
                      will come true.

      HALA screws up her eyes and then she and SADDAM 
        together blow out the candles. Everybody applauds. 

                                        SADDAM
                              (to AL BAKR, a hand on his 
                                arm)
                      Let s leave the women and children to 
                      their games. We have much to discuss.

                                        AL BAKR
                      You must save me a piece of cake.

                                        SAJIDA
                      Of course I will.BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 9



                                        AL BAKR
                                (patting his tummy)
                      Just a small piece.

      AL BAKR moves off with SADDAM, BODYGUARDS on either 
      side. SADDAM S inner circle, TARIQ, BARZAN, CHEMICAL 
      ALI, ADNAN KHAIRALLAH and HAMDANI follow close behind 
      them.

      They enter the room at the bottom of the corridor. The 
        double doors close and the BODYGUARDS wait outside.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. BAGHDAD VILLA - SADDAM S STUDY - NIGHT 1, 210888

      AL BAKR stands in the middle of the room. He takes a 
        silver cigarette case from his pocket; offers it to 
        SADDAM who refuses. He puts a cigarette in his mouth 
      and SADDAM lights it...AL BAKR draws deeply. 

                                        SADDAM
                      Please, sit down. There is something I 
                      have to say.

        BARZAN, ADNAN, CHEMICAL ALI, TARIQ and HAMDANI have 
         casually  positioned themselves around the room. 

      AL BAKR is a little wary; he chooses the seat behind 
        SADDAM S desk; he looks at the faces in the room. His 
        BODYGUARDS are positioned by the door.

                                        SADDAM (CONT D)
                                (calmly)
                      I am concerned about Khomeini...and 
                      the proposed union with Syria.
                              (a gesture from AL BAKR 
                                  encourages him to go on)
                      Khomeini continues to call on our 
                      people to join his revolution; because 
                      he knows we are weak.

                                        AL BAKR
                      Nonsense.

                                        SADDAM
                      Not at all, it s true...and an 
                      Alliance with Syria will make us 
                      weaker still.

                                        AL BAKR
                      Two Arab people coming together will 
                      make for a strong Alliance.BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 10



                                        SADDAM
                      Headed by a Syrian President; Asad of 
                      Syria will be first and you will be 
                      second.

                                        AL BAKR
                      With Saddam Hussein third? Is that 
                      your true objection?

                                        SADDAM
                      I have no objection. Why object to 
                      something that does not exist? And 
                      will never exist; I will not allow it.

                                        AL BAKR
                      You will not allow it Mister Deputy?
                                (pause)
                      I smell more than disquiet.

                                        SADDAM
                      Comrade Bakr, it s over.

                                        AL BAKR
                      Stop. Say no more!

                                personal; softly)
                        Saddam...Your time will come; set 
                      aside personal ambitions and accept 
                      this alliance for the good of the 
                      nation. It is what the Party wants.
                                (pause)
                      And we are a team you and me...look at 
                      what we ve accomplished; look at what 
                        you veaccomplished - Iraq has schools 
                      and hospitals and food for allof the

                      their bellies are full...because of

                                for a moment SADDAM has

                      Iraq can not be ruled from beyond its 
                      borders, nor by a President whose time 
                      has passed.

      AL BAKR looks to his two BODYGUARDS at the door but 
      they do not move.

      The party is over. Two friends sit and have a quiet 
      drink together - SADDAM and HAMDANI. In the near 
        distance, their wives gossip (SAJIDA and SANAA). The 
        GUESTS have left and children are in bed. They discuss 
      the main event of the evening. HAMDANI is just a little 
        drunk; giddy.

      They laugh; HAMDANI more than SADDAM...and it is in 
      this moment that SADDAM decides that HAMDANI will be 
      his example.

        SADDAM is alone. He is standing, staring through large 
        sliding glass door, out into a courtyard (or perhaps at 
      the reflection of a President).

        A second reflection appears - it is his mother, SUBHA. 

                                        SUBHA

      He turns to his MOTHER who has casually sat herself 
      down.

      CLOSE on AL BAKR. The Ba ath Party Revolutionary 
        Command Council (RCC) is seated round a long table. 
        Nervously AL BAKR starts to read out a prepared 
        statement. Those on the inside are impassive. The new 
      faces - including MUHIE MASHHADI, 50, Secretary General 
      of the Council - are in a state of shock.

                      For some time now my health has been 
                        deteriorating. I feel I can no longer 
                      shoulder the responsibilities of 
                        government...Conscience demands that I 
                      must step down.

      See MASHHADI frown, surprised.

                      And it is my view that the man best 
                      qualified to assume the leadership is 
                      my esteemed deputy, Comrade Saddam 
                      Hussein.

                      Mister President, this is absurd. Now 
                      is not the time to be stepping aside.

                      Comrade Mashhadi I have tried already

                      retiring, but he has made up his mind.

                        union...When we, the conspirators, 
                      realised that Bakr was to step down in 
                      favour of his deputy, the assumption 
                      of the presidency by Comrade Saddam 
                      Hussein forced us to put into action a 
                      plan to remove him. But as we did so, 
                      we revealed ourselves and our plans 
                      were uncovered.

        SADDAM shakes his head in sorrow as MASHHADI folds his 
      piece of paper and a suited bodyguard escorts him from 
      the stage. SADDAM resumes his position at the podium.

                                        SADDAM
                      Comrades, you can imagine how stunned 
                      I was to discover that I had been 
                      betrayed by my closest colleagues. 
                      After the first of these criminals 
                      were arrested, I asked them: "What 
                      political differences are there 
                      between you and me? Did you lack any 
                      power or money? If your opinion 
                      differed on anything, why didn t you 
                      submit it to the party? ... They had 
                      nothing to say to defend themselves.

                      The conspiracy spread wide...
                              (he produces a list; 
                                pause)
                      The people whose names are read out, 
                      should leave the hall.

        SADDAM passes the list to a SECURITY OFFICIAL and moves 
      back to his seat, appearing to be upset. The SECURITY 
        OFFICIAL nervously steps in front of the microphones.

        A sense of terror grips the room. The audience look 
        around in disbelief. 

      The first name is read out and BARZAN directs his 
        SECURITY MEN to the alleged CONSPIRATOR who they escort 
      from the room. As more names are read out SADDAM 
        watches scornfully continuing to smoke his cigar. One 
      of the victims starts to struggle as he is led away.

                      Out! Get out!

        SADDAM draws on his cigar.

                      God save Saddam from the conspirators!

        Applause and cheering break out in the room, and SADDAM 
      takes the applause - but even his inner circle are left 
        feeling vulnerable.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      EXT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING - YARD - DAY 4, 16452424

        A line of dishevelled PARTY MEMBERS are led blinking 
      into an enclosed but open-aired, dusty yard. All have 
      their hands tied behind their backs, their feet 
        shackled and their mouths gagged. MASHHADI is amongst 
      them.

      The line of wretches face a line of  saved  PARTY 
        MEMBERS. The two lines of men, ex-colleagues stare 
        across at each other.

        A HANDGUN is cocked at the ready. We see it is in the 
      hand of SADDAM.

        SADDAM then calmly passes THE HAND-GUN on to the 
        nearest SAVED PARTY MEMBER.BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 21



      Very reluctantly, the MEMBER steps up and with a 
        trembling hand, points the gun to the head of an ex-
        colleague; MASHHADI S head....the MEMBER is having 
        difficulty summoning up the courageto squeeze the 
        trigger. MASHHADI S breathing increases as he is 
        tortured with the feel of the gun at his head. SADDAM 
      is aware of the prolonged agony.

                                        SADDAM
                                (angrily)
                      FIRE!

      See the face of the PARTY MEMBER as he fires, a bloody 
      mist alights on his face and a BODY drops before him. 
      Hold on his silent horror.

      The PARTY MEMBER, in shock, the HANDGUN is passed to 
        another PARTY MEMBER. Then a hand is placed upon his 
        shoulder - he looks to the owner of the hand SADDAM.

                                        SADDAM (CONT D)
                                (softly)

                      live longer.

      More shots are fired; more bodies drop to the floor.  
      Find TARIQ standing apart, alone, removed from the 
      line.  Watching in horror.

        booming; music, prostitutes, dancing, alcohol.

        CHEMICAL ALI makes his way through the club, drink in

        SAJIDA is banging on a closed door. She is angry and 
        upset. Bang, bang, bang.

                                        SAJIDA
                              (at the closed door; 
                                  controlled anger)
                      He was your friend Saddam!...His wife 
                      was my friend! How am I supposed to 
                      face her now? What am I supposed to 
                      say to her?
                              (she bangs on the door)
                      Answer me!

      We find UDAY a distance away, watching from a hiding 
        place. SAJIDA keeps banging.

      Then click - the door is unlocked and it is opened. A 
      rough looking SADDAM looks at SAJIDA.

                                        SAJIDA (CONT D)
                      ...He was your friend!

        SADDAM S EYES are red, he looks tired... He reaches out 
      and touches SAJIDA S face, SHE AVOIDS HIS TOUCH.

                                        SADDAM 
                                (softly; firstly about the

                                (pause, still softly)
                      Yes, he was my friend... but only 
                      history and God can judge me.
                                (pause)
                      He could have been a threat Sajida; to

                      did what was necessary.

        Inside the car find SADDAM and SAJIDA.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      The motorcade pulls into a a residential street and 
      stops outside a villa. Inside the car:

                                        SAJIDA
                      I can t do this. I can t face her.

        A BODYGUARD opens the door of the car. SADDAM looks at 
        SAJIDA, shakes her head. SADDAM gets out of the car 
      alone and straightens himself and his suit. People stop 
      and stare at this unexpected sighting. Some edge 
        forward to kiss the hand of the PRESIDENT as he makes 
      his way to the door of the villa - which opens as he 
        reaches it. SADDAM enters the villa. SAJIDA is still 
        sitting in the car...she knows she has to follow 
        SADDAM.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      SANAA HAMDANI and the other WOMEN of her family are 
        MOURNING the death of her HUSBAND (ADNAN HAMDANI). 
        Dressed in black they sit in a circle, holding framed 
        photographs, and wail.

        Suddenly there is silence. SADDAM has entered the room. 
      The women hold their breath. SANAA is the last to 
        notice his presence. When she sees him she is convulsed 
      with horror and fear. She manages to remain steady and 
      still with the aid of the other WOMEN.

        SADDAM stays still and waits, shaking his head slowly, 
      as if in disbelief - how did this happen?BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 28



      SANAA then realises, as do we, that SADDAM is crying.

                                        SADDAM
                      I loved him like a brother. I want you 
                      to know, you will never need for 
                      anything as long as I live. I loved 
                      him...

      He holds his arms out to her, as though asking for her
      to comfort him. SANAA holds back for a moment, but then 
        realises that she has no option. She receives a nudge 
      in the back from a relative and she steps forward, 
        SADDAM embraces her.

                                        SADDAM (CONT D)
                      He and I spoke often, so very often, 
                      about how we would put the nation 
                      before our own needs...Did he ever 
                      talk like that to you?

                                        SANAA
                      ...Yes.

                                        SADDAM
                      So I know in my heart, that he would 
                      have understood. In my place, he would 
                      have done the same.

        SANAA S DAUGHTER (8), comes up and puts her arms around 
      her mother s waist, comfortingly, protectively, staring 
        dumbly up at SADDAM. He puts his hand on the little 
        GIRL S head.

                                        SANAA
                                (protecting her daughter)
                      What is good for Iraq, is good for me

        SAJIDA has entered the room and appreciatesthe 
        perversity of the scene she is witnessing.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      there is a referential  buzz  from the crowd - it is

      their voices and cheer and call his name. BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 29



        SADDAM acknowledges his people and moves slowly to his 
      car, the CROWD are kept a short distance away by 
        BODYGUARDS. SAJIDA is a little nervous. SADDAM 
        decides...

                      We will walk with the people for a 
                      while.

        SADDAM walks past the car, with SAJIDA, and the CROWD 
        follows - reaching out to him.

                                                                          CUT TO:

      more PEOPLE. SADDAM and SAJIDA.

      The calls of praise and support. EVERYBODY in the CROWD 
      wants SADDAM to look at THEM! SADDAM basks in the 
        warmth and begins to reach out to his people - pressing 
      the flesh in true Presidential style.

                                        SADDAM 
                      How are you? How are your family? Do 
                      you have enough food for the little

        ANOTHER WALKABOUT - the biggest yet. More of the same 
        pressing of flesh, but this time SAJIDA too joins the 
        spirit of the walkabout - she can t help but feel 
        flattered. She is also important, she is the wife of 
      the President! They move off along the street and the 
      crowd grows.

        SADDAM turns a street corner and it s almost bedlam; he 
      is in a less prosperous part of town; the CROWD 
        surrounding him has grown considerably; the BODYGUARDS 
      are working overtime to keep the ten-yards ahead of 
        SADDAM clear. He is smiling and waving at his people, 
      some of whom now carry portraits - he is loving being 
        loved! He is a PRESIDENT for the people.

      has a bag over his shoulder. He glances at the TV; he 
        finishes his Turkish coffee. He wipes his mouth, brow

        SADDAM rides in the back of his car, next to him is *

      Hold - then the motorcade is overtaking a truck - *
        carrying a load of roughly manufactured, empty, *
        coffins. Soldiers  coffins. *

        SADDAM leans, watches the truck as they ease past. We *
      see the DRIVER glance nervously towards the blacked-out *

        WATBAN and TARIQ.  Still angry, after the argument with 
        Sajida.

        HUSSEIN looks perplexed; SADDAM starts laughing with 
      ALI.

                      anything.

        SAMIRA passes, with a man later to be identified as her 
        HUSBAND. SADDAM sees her. She waits at the bar with her 
        HUSBAND. SADDAM watches her for a while, she glances 
      over, looks away, apparently shyly.

                      Yes, you said.

        SADDAM is engrossed with SAMIRA. Her HUSBAND has been 
        side-lined; is feeling humiliated and there s nothing 
      he can do but sit there! HUSSEIN watches for a few 
        moments then sits beside the HUSBAND and twists the 
        knife.

        SAMIRA S husband goes to move, or even try to talk to

      who are pressing forward and chanting. 

        SADDAM is shaking reaching beyond his screen of 
        REPUBLICAN GUARDS and shaking hands with his people - 
        mostly old men, women and children (the young men will 
      be fighting at the front-line!). SADDAM is loving it 
      and the crowd are folding in around him. 

        A WOMAN thrusts beyond the REPUBLICAN GUARDS and grabs 
        SADDAM s hand. A SOLDIER goes to pull her away but 
        SADDAM stops him.

                      No. No it s OK.

      She covers his hand with kisses, all of this filmed by 
      the news crew. SADDAM places his hand upon her head - 
      he looks around him and all he sees are 360 degrees of

        A SOLDIER slams the door shut and the crowd press in. A 
        satisfied SADDAM settles in the rear seat. A DRIVER in 
      the front. 

      The MOTORCADE car begins to move forward. Saddam leans 
      back, able to relax at last. SOLDIERS run alongside 
      until the car is clear of the Town Square and the 
        crowds.BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 55

      1536

        SADDAM s car is now travelling at speed, the third car 
      in a motorcade of four. 

        Silence - the CAR glides along the road - Palm groves 
      pass outside the windows - it s been a perfect day! 
      Then NOISE...

        Gunfire. The car brakes, slews and shunts into the car 
      in front. Machine-gunfire shatters the windows and the 
        DRIVER is killed. The car in turn is shunted. All hell 
        breaks loose. It s an ambush.


      EXT. ROAD FROM DUJAIL - DAY 14, 15377575

      The occupants of all cars in the motorcade come out 
        FIRING. Some are HIT. SADDAM scrambles out of his car 
      and crouches at the back of the car, next to a wheel. 
      All around him is gunfire. 

                                                                          CUT TO:

        Glimpse the image of a rancid, maggoty hare on a plate 
      in front of the barefoot BOY - he snaps it up and take 
        a bite!

                                                                    CUT BACK TO:

      The ATTACKERS, in the palm grove, can now be seen and 
      the gun fight ensues. The SOLDIERS begin expertly 
        picking them off. GRENADES are thrown into the PALM 
      GROVE and the ATTACKERS begin to take flight.

      The immediate threat is past...bodyguards arrive by 
        SADDAM. SADDAM notices that his hand is trembling and 
      it fuels his anger further.

                                        SOLDIER
                      Are you injured, Mr President?

      The SOLDIER dares to put a hand on SADDAM S arm to lead 
      him to the car - SADDAM angrily shrugs him off.

                                        SADDAM (CONT D)

        SADDAM has climbed onto the roof of a building, making 
        a point of showing himself. He is fired up on 
        adrenaline. But so are the CROWD, desperate to prove 
      their loyalty.

                      justice, we will have victory over 
                      these agents of Khomeini.....They will 
                      turn out to be a few, but the 39,000 
                      people of Dujail are loyal to the 
                      party and to Saddam!

      The CROWD begin to shout  With our soul, with our 
        blood, we will protect you, oh Saddam.  The crowd 
        cheers SADDAM; stern faced, he accepts the  adulation  
      but the joy and hysteria of earlier has gone. Hold on 
      the CROWD, desperate to prove their loyalty, desperate 
      to live.

                      Dujail belongs to the Shia; Khomeini

      An eerie silence. Begin in a bedroom, the wind blows a 
        muslin-veil that covers an open window. See an unmade 
      bed, blankets on the floor, drawers open and empty - a 
      hasty escape has been made. Move through the house and 
      find the personal items that have been left behind 
      (some unintentionally). Move through the living area 
      and the kitchen, food is still on the table, pots on 
      the stove, and then...the walls begin to crack and 
        collapse as a bulldozer moves in to flatten the house. 
        Noise.

        RAGHAD, 16 is getting ready for her wedding ceremony. 
      She is surrounded by women - her sisters RANA, 14 and 
      HALA, 11; a sister-in-law to be; some older women in 
        black. There is a festive atmosphere as they perfect 
      her make up and fuss with the dress.

                      soon as she is ready.

      RANA puts the veil on the floor to adjust the dress. 
      HALA snatches up the veil, puts it on her head and runs 
      out of the room and down a corridor - the veil flowing 
        behind her. RANA chases after her on to the mezzanine 
      of the ballroom.

                                                                          CUT TO:

        SAMIRA enters above, at the first floor level and 
        begins to descend the curved stair-way (escorted by 
      KAMEL HANNA). SAJIDA watches SAMIRA; ADNAN passes a

      See BARZAN is wired. It can t distinguish the tone of 
      the question and answers it straight.

                      ...It was necessary. My duty.

      ADNAN can see BARZAN is pre-occupied and possibly a 
        little drunk. Then above...

      The MAJIDS arrive, smiling on the Mezzanine; CHEMICAL 
      ALI, HUSSEIN KAMEL (the groom) and SADDAM KAMEL. 
        HUSSEIN is wearing an expensively cut cream suit, the 
        others are in dark lounge suits. SADDAM KAMEL is in 
        military uniform. BARZAN sees them, he moves off 
        towards the stair way. ADNAN follows, fearing a 
        confrontation.

        WATBAN, SAWABI and MOHAMMED watch...as BARZAN begins to 
        descend the stairs towards the AL-MAJIDS.

      They meet on the stairs - there is a moment where they 
      stop and eye-ball each other.

                      ...Barzan, you look wasted.

        BARZAN completely blanks the AL-MAJIDS and pushes past 
      them to the mezzanine level. ADNAN greets the AL-
        MAJIDS.

                      ....I have given you my soul....

                                        SADDAM 
                              (long pause)
                      You will attend the wedding, and then 
                      you will leave Iraq...because I love 
                      you.
                                (pause)
                      You ll have work to do elsewhere...
                                (pause)
                      I have guests waiting.

      Hold on BARZAN.

                                                                          CUT TO:


      INT. WEDDING PALACE - WASHROOM - DAY 16, 16168686

      Bang! BARZAN kicks the door of a cubicle as hard as he 
      can with the sole of his shoe - BANG - the door flies 
      back hits a wall and swings back towards BARZAN - he 
      kicks again - BANG! Again, BANG!

                                                                  INTERCUT WITH:


      FLASH - EXT. DUJAIL IMAGES- DAY 158787

        Houses crumble. 

        BARZAN KICKS THE DOOR.

        REFUGEES are now a line of PRISONERS, CHILDREN and 
        ADULTS, they are beaten and whipped with cable as they 
      run a gauntlet to their cell.

        BARZAN KICKS THE DOOR.

        Staring blankly out from the bars of a crowded cell is 
      the face of the WOMAN who kissed Saddam s hand in 
        Dujail. 

        BARZAN KICKS THE DOOR.BETWEEN TWO RIVERS - EPISODE ONE - YELLOW AMENDMENT (21/8/07) - PAGE 62



      The shadow of a four man gallows against the wall.  
      Four waiting shadows, suddenly drop through with an 
      awful thud.  Shadow feet kick against the wall.  And 
      then the BODIES drop as they are cut down.

        A SWEATING BARZAN HAS STOPPED KICKING. HOLD.

        Glimpse a pile of BODIES - a mass grave.

        BARZAN WIPES HIS FACE AND HANDS WITH A TOWEL AND AGAIN 
      LOOKS AT HIS SMART REFLECTION.... 

                                                                  INTERCUT WITH:


      INT. WEDDING PALACE - BALLROOM - DAY 16, 17008888

        RAGHAD and her procession emerge on to the mezzanine to 
      the gasps of the GUESTS below. HUSSEIN is sitting on 
      his throne; he beams at his bride-to-be as she descends 
      the stair-case. UDAY is less happy as he watches from a 
        corner of the room.

      TARIQ smiles and nods his approval. RAGHAD makes her 
      way to her throne besides HUSSEIN. Then, and only then 
      does SADDAM make his own grand entrance...

        SAJIDA looks from SADDAM to SAMIRA (KAMEL HANNA still 
      by her side); as SAMIRA watches only the PRESIDENT. The 
      smile momentarily falls from her face as she thinks she 
      spies a look between her husband and the beautiful 
        blonde. 

                                        SAJIDA
                              (to ADNAN)
                      Who s the blonde?

      In a glass elevator, SADDAM descends from the heavens 
      to the applause of the adoring family and GUESTS...
