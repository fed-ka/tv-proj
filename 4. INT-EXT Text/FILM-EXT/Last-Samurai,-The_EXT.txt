GAS-LIT STREET
NIGHT
Algren walks in the fog. Sputtering gas lamps give an unearthly glow.
ALGREN (V.O.)
"We are dead," they whisper, "and we are happy."
SHIP
DAY
Algren and Gant stand at the rail.
GANT
Hate boats. If the Lord bad wanted man to sail
he wouldn't have created infantry.
ALGREN
How many rimes you puke today?
GANT
I'm down to two.
Omura comes up next to them.
OMURA
I understand you are a scholar, Captain Algren.
(to Gant)
Have you read his book., Mr. Gant?
GANT
Can't say I have.
OMURA
An analysis of the triumph of weapons technology
over antiquated military tactics.
14.
ALGREN
(wr y)
A real page-turner. Sold twelve copies.
OMURA
Nonetheless, I was impressed. I enjoy reading
military history. I spent two years studying
English at Princeton University.
ALGREN
And where did you learn to speak Japanese?
Omura is perplexed by Algren's remark, then realizes he is being kidded. He
laughs heartily. Algren laughs with him. A connection is made.
OMURA
Yes, and in Japanese there are twenty-seven
words for "war." I will be impressed if you learn
only half of them. .
He walks away. Algren watches him go. His face darkens.
ALGREN
I got twenty-seven words too - Reb, Sioux,
Pawnee, Blackfoot, Jappo. Only one language
when it comes to war.
YOKOHAMA HARBOR
DAY
Like all Japan, Yokohama is at the cusp of a new era.
Ancient sampans and wooden schooners beside freighters and steamships.
YOKOHAMA  DOCK
DAY
After 23 days at sea, they are all glad to climb down the gangplank. The
Yokohama docks are a frenzy of languages and looks and smells and sounds.
Japanese competes with German and English and French and Russian.
Warehouses fl y the flags of a dozen countries.
One striking Japanese character dominates: the symbol for, Omura. It is seen
on buildings, warehouses, and the headbands of scores of laborers.
A series of palanquins, litters carried by bearers, await our voyagers.
As does SIMON GRAHAM, a dissipated Englishman who has lived in Japan
for many yean. Slender and pale, with an occasional consumptive cough, in
his 50's, he wears a white linen suit, a bit worse for wear.
OMURA
Captain Algren, this is Mr. Simon Graham. He
will be your translator.
15.
GRAHAM
Pleasure, Captain.
BAGLEY
You'll be quartered at the Embassy for now.
OMURA
The Emperor will summon you at his pleasure.
Graham ushers Algren and Gant into their own less-ornate version.
GRAHAM
If you please, Captain...
ALGREN
They're gonna carry us?
GRAHAM
You're guests of the Emperor. You cannot walk.
Algren notes the hoods covering the faces of the palanquin bearers.
ALGREN
Why the hoods?
GRAHAM
So you won't have to burden your eyes by looking
at slaves. Oh, excuse me, they're servants now.
(coughs, wipes a bit of blood)
This wa y, gentlemen...
INT /EXT
PALANQUIN - YOKOHAMA STREETS
DAY
Their bearers maneuver them through the bustling streets of Yokohama.
White face painted geishas walk alongside bearded Russians. Traditional
Japanese kimonos alongside European suits and hats, schizophrenic world
of ancient Japan versus modern commercialism.
GRAHAM
Twenty years ago Yokohama was a lovel y little
port. Then your Commodore Perry arrived and
changed all that.
ALGREN
All this in twenty years?
GRAHAM
Japan has...embraced... Western wa ys. Hired
lawyers from France, doctors from Germany,
naval architects from Britain, civil engineers,
railway designers, scientists, teachers. And, of
course, warriors from the United States.
16.
ALGREN
Buying the future.
GRAHAM
Or selling the past...
AMERICAN EMBASSY-. GARDEN
DAYS LATER
In the pristine grounds of the Embassy, a garden party is in progress.
Incongruous lilting Yankee tunes are heard from the Japanese band.
Algren and Gant, now in their dress uniforms wander through the party with Graham.
Liveried servants pall trays of canaps.
Elsewhere we see diplomats representing all the powers currently trying to devour
Japan: Russia; England; Germany; France; Spain; etc.
17.
GRAHAM
I remember when it was just America and the
Dutch. Now ever ybody' s getting into the game.
They pass two German diplomats. The Germans glance to Algren and Gant with suspicion, bow tersely.
Graham greets them in German.
GRAHAM
The Germans are particularly eager.
ALGREN
What do they want?
GRAHAM
Same thing your country wants. Most favored
nation status.
ALGREN
How long have you been in Japan?
GRAHAM
Oh, western time quickly loses its meaning here
... I first came as part of the British legation in 1857.
But I was soon relieved of m y position, as a result
of various...disagreements with the
Crown's attitude toward the locals.
Omura separates himself from his entourage and approaches.
OMURA
Gentlemen. I hope you are enjoying a taste of
home.
ALGREN
I've done with worse, believe me.
OMURA
America has much to offer us, though. Its'
industry and ingenuity are without peer.
(ingratiating)
I have spoken to the Emperor about you. He is
interested in the most modem theories of warfare.
ALGREN
I look forward to the opportunity of meeting
him someday.
OMURA
You will have that chance sooner than you think.
He has requested an audience.
Graham is open-mouthed at this turn of events.
18.
IMPERIAL PALACE
DAY
Algren and Bagley sit with Graham in an ornate carriage as they cross the
moat and enter the ancestral palace of the Shoguns.
IMPERIAL COURT -- THRONE ROOM
DAY
Algren and Gant are surprised to discover the living god is barely in his
twenties. The divine EMPEROR MEIJI is an intelligent and curious young man,
yet there is a tentativeness about him.
His throne is surrounded by ADVISORS, principal among them is Omura.
Nearby, the American AMBASSADOR SWANBECK a cagey diplomat
The throne room itself is sweeping, beautiful, and extremely restrained. Everywhere,
tasteful displays of the traditional flower of the monarchy: chrysanthemums.
The vibrant yellow bl ossoms haunt the chamber.
As the Emperor considers his guests, Omura whispers into his ear. Then:
OMURA
The Emperor bids you welcome. He wishes you
to know that he is most grateful for the assistance
your country offers ours, in order to rid ourselves
of the brutality of the provincial warlords - and
to accomplish the same national harmony which
you enjoy in your homeland.
The Emperor speaks in Japanese. The advisors are non-plussed, and Omura leans down
for a moment to confer with him, then smiles indulgently:
OMURA
The Emperor is most interested in your American
Indians, and wishes to know if you have seen
them firsthand.
Algren looks at Graham, who nods. He may speak.
19.
ALGREN
I have seen many of them, and have fought them,
too. They are very brave.
Graham translates. The Emperor nods and smiles.
EMPEROR
(accented English)
Thank... you... very ...much.
He stands. Everyone else hurries to follow suit. The audience is over.
PALACE GARDEN
DAY
A1gren, Graham, and Bagley walk through the palace grounds.
BAGLEY
That young pup runs this country?
GRAHAM
That "pup" runs the country no more than I do.
He was installed as a figurehead at age twelve
when the warlords realized Japan needed a central
government. But don't be fooled -- he may be a
powerless god, but to these people he's a god
nonetheless.
GENERAL YOSHITAKA appears. He is a seasoned soldier in his 40's. A
decent man. He stops before them, bows quickly.
GRAHAM
Gentlemen, may I present General Yoshitaka.
He will assist you in training the army.
ALGREN
General.
Algren offers his hand. General Yoshitaka does not take it. He bowl his head and
speaks a few words. Graham translates:
YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
He greets you with extreme courtesy and asks if
you are ready to meet the Imperial Army.
PARADE GROUND
DAY
About a thousand Japanese soldiers in baggy uniforms are milling around a large
parade ground. Each has an old single shot rifle. Algren, Gant, and Yoshitaka
look down on them from a reviewing stand.
GANT
Jesus....
20.
ALGREN
Ask the General what training they' ve had.
Graham speaks to General Yoshitaka, then translates his response.
YOSHITAKA/ GRAHAM
He sa ys... We have trained them not to shoot
their ...asses off.
Algren glances to General Yoshitaka, who looks back wr yl y.
ALGREN
Sergeant Gant, have the men stand to attention.
GANT
Imperial Army, Atten-tion!
Graham translates, rather mildly.
ALGREN
For God's sake, let's not keep it a secret who's in
charge here ... Mr. Gant.
GANT
(roars)
ALL RIGHT YOU SLANTY-EYED LITTLE
BASTARDS STAND UP STRAIGHT OR I
WILL SHIT-KICK EVERY ONE OF YOU
COCKSUCKERS!!
As the soldiers immediately stand to attention, we begin a montage of the training
of the first Imperial Army:
We see Gant drilling the men. Shouting at his translator. Trying to get them to march
in formation. Algren is nearby, watching.
ALGREN (V.O.)
August 4,1876. As I watch this new army train,
I cannot help but think of those who rode with
me in me 23rd cavalry.
Algren sits in his tent, writing in his journal. Outside, the Japanese are being taught
the basics of firing tactics.
ALGREN (V.O.)
For four years they had survived, never once
shrinking from the fire. And so, when given my
order to charge the advancing rebel infantry,
they never hesitated. ...And they all died.
We see Algren showing the Japanese how to fire in formation. The old single-shot
rifles they carry make reloading a painfully slow process.
21.
ALGREN (V .O.)
Now I am training another army. In another
civil war.
Algren and Gant spar with sabers - Algren's expertise far exceeds Gant's, a
fact which Gant accepts with good humor.
ALGREN (V.O.)
Is this why I was spared? Once again to lead
men to their death?
It is sunset Algren, Graham, and General Yoshitaka watch the training.
General Yoshitaka speaks.
YOSHlTAKA/ GRAHAM
... the problem is they're peasants. They have
never had this sort of responsibility or power.
Algren watches Gant march beside the Japanese. They are illuminated by the
majestic red sunset
ALGREN
(to Graham)
Ask him if they have a flag.
Graham translates. Genera1 Yoshitaka responds.
GRAHAM
No flag.
ALGREN
They need a flag.
TOKYO  STREET
EVENING
Tokyo is a city in chaos. Everything seems out of balance. Dystopic. A
collision of Eastern and Western. Algren and Gant watch as Graham prepares
to take a photograph of an old merchant in front of his store.
GRAHAM
... I've been doing this for years. Trying to capture
it before it's all gone. Afraid I'm losing the battle.
Algren silently watches the passers-by. Something draws his attention:
Across the street. a man is striding down the crowded sidewalk. His martial
bearings, two swords, traditional dress and unique top knot of hair instantly
identify him to us as a samurai.
.
We will meet him again later, he is UJIO. A terse, grim man in his 40's. His
proud gait and rigid, imperious manner intrigue Algren.
22.
Most of the people on the sidewalk instantly step out of the wa y, bowing in deference. But two young
Japanese in Western dress do not.
Ujio stands before them, waiting for them to move. They don't.
Tense words are exchanged. Ujio glares at them. Algren watches.
ALGREN
Mr. Graham...
GRAHAM
Ah... now this should be interesting... He's
waiting for them to show deference.
Across the street, Uji o barks out some harsh commands to the two
Japanese men. They laugh in response. Then one of the men raises a hand
and barks some clearly disrespectful words back--
Like lightning-- Ujio pulls out his long samurai sword - it flashes --
Cleanly beheading the disrespectful Japanese man --
The beheaded corpse begins to fall--
In one smooth motion, Ujio wipes his blade clean of the corpse as it falls
and sweeps it back into its scabbard. The other man immediately drops to
his belly, prostrating himself.
Without another glance, Ujio walks awa y. His face is completely impassive.
GANT
What the hell was that?
GRAHAM
That...is a samurai.
TOKYO  STREET
NIGHT
Later that night.
Algren and Gant, a little drunk by now, wander Tokyo's bustling red light
district. Like Amsterdam, the geishas sit in windows facing the street.
_PARADE GROUND
DAY
The training continues. We see Gant, now sporting a black eye. Algren
walks with General Yoshitaka and Graham. Graham translates:
YOSHITAKA/ GRAHAM
The General wishes to know if you bad a pleasant
evening?
Algren looks at Yoshitaka, who gives him. wry look..
ALGREN
It was... educational
(Yoshitaka nods)
Would the General mind telling me more about
our common enemy?
Yoshitaka looks at him. Has Algren deliberately used the word, "enemy,"
knowing that Yoshitaka, too, is a samurai? Algren gives nothing awa y.
YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
... Mori Katsumoto is an extremely charismatic leader.
To those who honor the old ways, he's a hero. His
force is estimated at about five hundred and growing
by the day. All samurai.
ALGREN
What kind of man is be?
Graham translates. General Yoshitaka considers his words.
27.
YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
Katsumoto has no fear. He has no pity. He is
kotsutai-- the soul of old Japan ... He is my
honored kinsman.
ALGREN
Kinsman?
YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
We grew up together in Yoshino. Marched
together and fought together. He is Kaishaku
the brother of my spirit.
Algren considers this as they observe rifle practice. Erratic but
improving. Algren notes Yoshitaka's reaction. The rifles seem to make
him unhappy.
ALGREN
Ask him what kind of guns Katsumoto has.
GRAHAM
The samurai don't use guns.
ALGREN
No, ask him what kind of firearms they have.
Graham obliges. Yoshitaka responds, with disdain:
YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
The samurai no longer dishonor themselves by
touching firearms.
Algren is surprised at this bit of information. A servant approaches, bows.
GRAHAM
Colonel Bagley requires you.
RUINED VILLAGE
DAY
A STEAM ENGINE lends plumes of smoke into the air as it waits. Algren,
Bagley, and General Yoshitaka ride along the railroad line.
The Imperial Army follows, with Sergeant Gant, on foot.
A traditional Japanese village is being torn aside to make room for the railroad
line. Houses are being leveled and black smoke drifts up. The displaced
villagers gather belongings. Omura guards herd them about rather bruta1ly.
29.
Railroad workers are laying a new spur, building a brick station. A1gren notes
the by now familiar Omura symbol on the new water tower and on the
headbands of the guards and workers.
ALGREN
What is that sign?
GRAHAM
It's the symbol for the Omura Zaibatsu.
ALGREN
Zaibatsu?
GRAHAM
Old family businesses that own ever ything worth
owning. The molt powerful is the Omura
Zaibatsu. That's your friend, Omura.
ALGREN
They own all of this?
GRAHAM
They do now.
SEVERED HEADS on pikes line the road, a warning to those who continue
to resist
ALGREN (V.O.)
October 24,1876. Today we entered Kansai
province. Here the local warlords have all been
convinced to accept the emperor's rule.
They pass a particularly wrenching sight. Villagers kneeling outside what
used to be a Shinto temple. The railroad tracks cut straight through it.
ALGREN (V.O.)
Our destination is Yoshino, home of the rebel
Katsumoto. Protected by high mountain passes,
it can be reached only during the summer
months, and even then with great difficulty.
The Army moves on. Ahead are towering mountains.
MOUNTAIN PASS
DAY
The Imperial Army winds its way up I steep mountain pass.
ALGREN (V.O.)
A long march. And then a battle. A new enemy,
but the same feeling I had in my guts at twenty-one,
in the cornfield at Antietam -- men will die
here, today, and will I be among them?
30.
MOUNTAIN PLAIN
MORNING
Fog. Obscuring everything.
Algren and Bagley, on horseback, wait with Graham. General Yoshitaka and
a few Japanese Commanders are mounted as well. The thousand strong
Japanese Army is on foot They stand, rifles ready.
,
ALGREN
(to Graham)
Ask him how they'll come at us.
Graham speaks to General Yoshitaka. Yoshitaka responds:
YOSHITAKA/ GRAHAM
They'll come straight on. They will push forward
and keep on attacking... And he adds that there
is no samurai word for "retreat."
Algren prepares himself.
They wait.
General Yoshitaka is suddenly alert. He speaks quietly to Graham.
YOSHITAKA/GRAHAM
He sa ys they're coming...
Algren gazes into the thick fog ahead, sees nothing. Bagley looks worried.
BAGLEY
Captain Algren, have you posted a rear guard to
protect our supply train?
ALGREN
Yes.
BAGLEY
Who is overseeing their deployment?
Algren is somewhat confused by the question.
ALGREN
No one.
BAGLEY
Mr. Graham, you will accompany me to the rear.
I want to be certain we are protected from any
surprise assault.
GRAHAM
Yes. Of course.
Before Algren can respond, Bagley has left the front lines with Graham in
31.
tow. Gant watches as they head out of harm's wa y.
.
GANT
Son of a bitch.
ALGREN
(almost to himself)
...I'm going to kill him.
GANT
Waste of good ammo.
Gant checks his two revol vers. The methodical clicking of the chambers as
he checks his rounds is the only sound.
.
Then absolute silence. A light SNOW begins to fall.
Algren continues to peer into the fog. Nothing.
Then a sound ... distant ... building through the fog...
The steady rumble of horses. Slowl y approaching. Closer and closer...
Algren notes some of the Japanese soldiers are literally shaking in fear.
Algren peers again into the fog. Nothing. But the sound is closer.
Then the sound abruptly stops.
Silence broken only by the murmured prayers of some of the soldiers.
ALGREN
Sergeant Gant, order the troops to assume
staggered firing positions.
GANT
Imperial Army, assume staggered firing positions.
His order is translated. The Japanese soldiers prepare to fire, one
row kneeling, the other standing behind them.
One of the Japanese soldiers faints from sheer tension.
Algren can see nothing through the dense fog. The tension is unbearable.
Then a form on horseback... ghostly... like lame sort of medieval
monster. An elaborate, horned helmet. Sweeping samurai armor.
All we can see it the eerie silhouette in the fog.
Like something from a nightmare.
And then another figure... and another ... as 500 mounted samurai warriors
slowl y move into position.
32.
The Japanese troops are terrified
GANT
(quickly)
Hold the line ... hold the line...
The order is translated.
A terrible, beautiful moment of absolute stasis.
Nothing moves.
The Japanese soldiers wait.
The ghostly silhouettes wait.
Silence.
Then -- as if a silent signal were given -- the samurai suddenly CHARGE,
emerging from the fog in a great wave--! The force of a tsunami.
The silence is shattered as the charging samurai roar out ancient war-
cries that chill the blood -- sweeping forward on their hones like
lightning -swords and spears flashing
ALGREN
FIRE!
The Japanese troops fire then quickly begin trying to reload their single shot
rifles -- others fumble at the ask and then break and run--
Panic and chaos--
ALGREN
Hold the line!
Too late-- the samurai are on them--
They attack with an intensity few have ever seen -- many of the Japanese
soldiers try to escape, turning and running in blind panic -- they are butchered--
run through by the ashigaru, cut inhalf by the naginata.
Those soldiers who laboriousl y try to reload their rifles are quickly
mowed down by ferocious clouds of samurai arrows, fired by mounted
Samurai.
ALGREN
Sound fall back! Sound fall back!
A bugler sounds the order. The Army begins to retreat.
But suddenly they are attacked from behind as well! Arrows shoot from the
fog and more mounted samurai appear.
33.
They are surrounded.
Algren, Gant, and the Japanese Offi cers call out orders but all discipline
soon breaks down -- it is every man for himself--
The battle swirls ever ywhere around us. Fleeing soldiers are run through by
lances, run down and trampled by horses.
Each samurai wears individual, vibrantly col ored armor. Various battle
flags sweep through the fog.
Gant uses his two cavalry revolvers -- firing constantly -- finally out of
ammo he drops from his horse in the cavalry st yle and pulls a Winchester
repeating rifle, crouching and quickly firing--
Algren uses his revol ver first -- firing as he turns on his horse -- when
the revol ver is empty he pulls his cavalry saber. He manages to parry
the lethal blows as the Samurai hurtle past --
But one Samurai, his armor all in black, comes at him on a collision course
and SLAMS INTO HIM, sending both horse and rider to the ground.
Algren scrambles to his feet, his saber nowhere to be found as another
rider heads toward him carrying a lance.
Algren manages to grab it and throw the rider to the ground, wrestling the
lance from his grip and running him through.
In the midst of the battle we notice a peculiar thing. One samurai is just sitting
on his horse. Watching Algren. This samurai wears a BLACK MASK.
The MASKED SAMUARI watches Algren fight.
Algren now wields the lance to battle the horsemen as they sweep past. He
spears one and then unseats another. When a third samurai cuts his lance in
half, Algren uses the remaining half as a club to take him down.
The Masked Samurai continues to watch Algren. Algren's tenacity is amazing.
He continues to fight with heroic passion, refusing to give an inch, long after
Those around him have fled.
Then a blaze of bright yellow  a samurai in yellow armor galloping past, firing
arrows steadily from horseback. His control and speed are astounding.
We will come to know him as YORITOMO, a handsome young samurai.
Yoritomo fires arrow upon arrow  the speed is breathtaking  Two arrows
slam into Gant, knocking him to the ground.
The battle, meanwhile, has become a rout. Those Imperial soldiers who fight
are easily cut down. Those who flee are run down like prey.
Left alone, Algren finds himself confronted by ashigaru  samurai foot
soldiers carrying pikes. He turns to discover his retreat cut off by other
34.
samurai wielding katana  the lethal long sword.
But rather than give any quarter, Algren launches an attack. He kills one
samurai before he is RUN THROUGH, at the shoulder, by a lance.
In agony, Algren SNAPS OFF the hilt of the lance, leaving its tip buried
deep in his chest, and fights on.
He manages to parry a blow  which SLICES into his side. The next blow
takes off a piece of his scalp. Blood fl ows down his faces and into his eyes.
Algren is now surrounded by ten samurai. A man's heroic stand against
certain death is of great interest to them. As they begin to close in, Algren
whirls the lance around, a tattered battle-flag with TIGER INSIGNIA still
dangling from the end.
The MASKED SAMURAI removes his mask. It is the JAPANESE MAN,
whose dream of the tiger we glimpsed at the beginning of the story. His
eyes wide in surprise, he watches his dream come to life--the blue tiger
holding the dogs at bay.
In SLOW MOTION Algren whirls the lance, as one samurai, wearing
BLOOD-RED ARMOR, advances. With a murderous smile, he draws his
katana.
Algren seems spent  he drops to one knee, swaying, on the brink of losing
consciousness.
.
But as the RED SAMURAI, lets out a battle cry and propels himself forward for the death blow - Algren
suddenly LEAPS UP and propels the jagged wooden end of the broken lance into the unprotected throat of his
attacker.
As the samurai falls, the rest of his comrades close in to cut Algren off.
A harsh COMMAND stops them in their tracks.
The Masked Samurai leaps from his horse. Everyone steps aside deferentially
so that be might pass by without being jostled.
.
He looks down at Algren, then removes his battle helmet.
And we meet _MORI KATSUMOTO, the leader of the samurai. He it an
imposing man of about Algren's years.
Sensing that he is about to be killed, Algren pulls himself t o his knees, and SWINGS his saber at Katsumoto.
With blinding speed, Katsumoto pulls his katana from its scabbard.
Algren's saber is SNAPPED CLEANLY IN TWO.
Katsumoto looks down at Algren.
Then Gant appears behind Katsumoto -- limping toward him, cocking his
rifle, urgently trying to save Algren--
Ujio, (the Samurai we saw earlier on the streets of Tokyo) leaps to
protect his Lord. His sword flashes--
35.
Gant is eviscerated. Algren watches in horror.
A dreadful beat as Gant stands, pathetically trying to hold his guts in. Then he
sinks to his knees.
Katsumoto turns, leaps back onto his horse and trots off.
Algren finally wrenches himself from under his horse. He crawls to Gant,
blood pouring from his own injured back and shoulder.
Gant is dead.
Algren looks up to see the battle is lost. The Japanese soldiers have fled.
Or are surrendering, injured or dead.
And he sees one other thing. General Yoshitaka is still on his horse,
head down. He has not pulled his sword. He has not been hurt.
Katsumoto rides to Yoshitaka. A few serious words are exchanged. Katsumoto bows his bead in respect, seems
to agree to something.
Both men climb from their horses. General Yoshitaka pulls out a small b1ade and hands it to Katsumoto, who
holds it out firmly.
General Yoshitaka quickly and calmly pulls himself on to the blade, plunging
it into his stomach, embracing Katsumoto.
It is seppuku -- the traditional form of samurai suicide.
Algren watches, stunned.
Then a terrible scream cuts through the battlefield.
Algren sees samurai calmly walking among the injured and captured Imperial
soldiers .. killing them one by one with a single stroke.
Algren looks over the slaughter.
And then passes out, bill wounds overcoming him.
Fade to...
MOUNTAIN PASS
DAY
Algren is unconscious, tied to a horse.
The mounted samurai move up a treacherous mountain pass, disappearing
into the soaring mountains of Yoshino.
VILLAGE
SUNSET
Katsumoto's village is the other Japan. The Japan we have not yet seen.
The gorgeous mountain scenery of Yoshino envelopes the village. Snow-
capped mountains soar in the distance. A valley below with rice fields.
36.
After the turmoil of Tokyo, this place seems a bucolic paradise. Traditional,
wooden Japanese architecture. Farming. The sense of harmony so markedly
absent from the cities.
Algren, barely conscious, hunches over his horse. He has lost a lot of blood.
Katsumoto leads his samurai into the village. As he passes, ever y person in
the village touches his or her forehead to the ground to show respect.
Most of these villagers have never seen a white face and gaze at Algren with
curiosity. And suspicion.
Katsumoto dismounts in a large square, the rest of his men follow suit. A samurai
helps Algren painfully slide from his horse.
Katsumoto moves to the steps of the largest house. His officers fall
into formation around him. Algren notes Ujio - the grim samurai who killed
Gant -- in jet black armor, glaring at him coldl y.
Ujio walks forward and SCREAMS at Algren in Japanese. Algren doesn't
move. This only makes Ujio more angry. He paces back and forth like a
caged panther spitting invective at Algren.
Algren doesn't move. He watches Uji o evenly. This takes incredible will.
His wounds are so bad that- he can barely stand.
SUDDENLY - Ujio draws his long sword -- it slashes through the air - the
blade singing -- and stops an inch away from Algren's face!
Algren doesn't move.
Ujio brings the cutting edge' into contact with Algren's check. Blood runs
where even this feather-light touch cuts Algren's skin. Algren doesn't move.
Ujio glares at him. Then sheathes his sword and walks away.
Katsumoto looks at Algren deepl y, gauging him. Then be speaks. In English.
Algren is surprised.
KATSUMOTO
You cannot escape. We are deep in the mountains
and winter is coming.
Katsumoto turns and walks into his house. Uji o follows him. Algren collapses.
Fade to black.
As Algren begins his time at the heart of the samurai world.
VILLAGE
NIGHT
Autumn leaves fall to the ground. In a tiny hut, the village swordsmith begins
work on a samurai blade.
VILLAGE
FOLLOWING
The screaming continues. Lamps are lit around the village...
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
NIGHT
Katsumoto stands outside the house, drawn by the commotion. Ujio stands
with him, shaking his bead.
UJIO
(subtitles)
My lord, why do you spare the barbarian? He is
shamed in defeat, be should kill himse1f.
KATSUMOTO
(subtitles)
The barbarian doesn't know hit shame.
UJIO
(subtitles)
Then I will kill him.
KATSUMOTO
(pats him; subtitles)
Ujio-San, he will still be shamed tomorrow or in
a month. For now there are things I wish to learn.
VILLAGE
DAY
A glimpse of village life -- fish are hung on lines to dry, children chase each
Other, clothes are washed in the river, and in the rice fields below, farmers
squat as they have for thousands of years. In his hut, the swordsmith
continues to hammer and fold the blade.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
MORNING
Algren watches from the window as the samurai train. It is like nothing else
in the world. Part sacred ritual, part martial preparation, samurai training
com bines athletic prowess and graceful artistry into one effortless whole.
Finally well enough to walk, Algren comes out onto the porch to watch the
spectacle. In front of him, is a Kendo (The Way of the Sword) master
practice with their long and short swords. They have incredible control.
NAKAO, a mountain of a man, is a Karate master. He stands unarmed,
four samurai facing him. They attack with wooden swords. He effortlessly
defeats them -- the agility of the huge man is shocking.
Kyudo ("The Way of the Bow") masters use their bows for target practice.
Yoritomo holds a bundle of arrows. In the distance, a line of plums.
Algren watches. Yoritomo just seems to stand there, his eyes hall-open.
And then -- in a stunning blaze of movement -- Yoritomo fires the arrows --
one after another, amazingly fast -- cleanly hitting each plum. The final arrow
splits the previous one as it buries itself in the tree.
A wooden sword leans against the porch.
Algren idly picks it up, feeling its balance. In a flash, Uji o has raced over and
grabbed it from him. Algren stands motionless as Ujio screams at him.
41.
The training stops, as everyone watches Uji o berate Algren.
Even as Ujio continues screaming. Algren simply shakes his head, turns
awa y, and walk back into the house.
VILLAGE
NIGHT
A first, light snowfall has covered the ground. A1gren walks out into the still
night. He turns a corner and confronts curious sight:
Ten warriors kneel, motionless in the snow, their eyes closed in concentration.
As Algren puzzles over this, he becomes aware that Katsumoto is now
standing next to him.
KATSUMOTO
They are training.
ALGREN
Training what?
KATSUMOTO
Their minds. It is called bushido...
42.
Algren looks at him. He has never heard the word.
KATSUMOTO
The wa y of the warrior. We study from when
we are young. Are my words correct?
Algren does not respond.
KATSUMOTO
I will practice my Eng1ish with you.
ALGREN
Why do you learn English?
KATSUMOTO
To know m y enemy.
ALGREN
If I am your enemy, why have you not killed
me?
Katsumoto doesn't answer.
ALGREN
Was General Yoshitaka your enemy?
KATSUMOTO
No, I honor his memory as my kinsman.
ALGREN
That why you helped him kill himself?
KATSUMOTO
If a samurai is defeated in battle, he must take
his own life to spare himse1f the shame of capture.
It is required that his kaishaku his trusted friend,
help him. I was honored to by his kaishaku.
ALGREN
Hell of an honor.
KATSUMOTO
It was his destiny. He knew it, he died at peace.
ALGREN
Who was the warrior in the red armor?
KATSUMOTO
My son-in-law. His name was Hiroshi.
ALGREN
And the woman who cares for me?
43.
KATSUMOTO
My daughter, Hiroshi's wife. Her name is Taka.
Algren is incredulous.
ALGREN
I killed her husband?
KATSUMOTO
It was an honorable death.
Katsumoto walks awa y.
VILLAGE -- BATHING TUB
DAY
Yoritomo leads Algren to a large, wooden bathing tub in I secluded part of
the village. A banked fire smolders beneath it.
Embarrassed, Yoritomo indicates to Algren that be needs to bathe. Algren
strips off his filthy uniform then lowers himself into the steaming water.
Yoritomo begins taking off hit own kimono. A1gren is taken aback. Used to
Western privacy, he is a bit disquieted about bathing with another man.
Yoritomo, unconcerned, climbs into the tub. He chats pleasantly as they
bathe, showing off his old battle wounds.
44.
Algren's discomfort turns to outright alarm when a toothless old grandmother
appears. .She happily strips and joins them in the tub!
Algren sinks a little lower into the water. The old grandmother smiles at
him with her toothless grin.
VILLAGE
DAY
Algren. feeling self-conscious in the clean kimono he's wearing for the first
time, walks back with Yoritomo. Kids start walking with them, pointing at
his Japanese garb, laughing as he stumbles in his wooden clogs. They pass
by Ujio training a group of samurai using wooden kendo swords.
Nearby, Higen and Toshiie are imitating the grown-ups, sparring with wooden
swords that are much too big for them. Yoritomo watches his nephews proudly,
murmuring details of their prowess to Algren, who has no idea what he's talking
about.
Higen charges his little brother, but goes careening past, right toward Algren,
who deftl y dodges out of the wa y. This causes gales of laughter from the
boys, one of whom takes Toshiie's sword and offers it to Algren.
Algren looks at the sword in his hand and unthinkingly twirls if with a f1ourish --
causing the boys to applaud. Yoritomo bows, and encourages A1gren in
Higen's direction. Algren shakes his head politely, but Higen is already on
the attack.
Algren dodges one thrust, then parries another, as the boys begin to cheer.
Suddenly, ever yone goes silent. Algren turns.
Ujio is standing behind him, arms folded.
Ujio barks a command in Japanese. He wants Algren to drop the sword.
It is obvious to Algren what it must mean, but he does nothing.
Ujio approaches Algren slowl y. Algren holds the wooden sword casually,
only his eyes betraying the tension of the moment.
Ujio's wooden sword FLASHES, quicker than the eye can follow. Algren's
sword is knocked from his hands, then, somehow in the same fluid
movement, Ujio brings the sword around and cracks Algren across the
chest hard enough to knock the breath from his body and lend him to his
kneels.
Satisfied with himself, Uji o starts to walk away, but the expressions of the
bystanders cause him to turn back: .
Algren is standing again, and again holding the sword.
With grim purpose, Uji o returns to Algren, who has assumed a ready pose.
Again Ujio's SWORD FLASHES. Algren manages to parry one blow, before
he is cracked across the face, and blood begins to flow free1y from his nose.
45.
Ujio knocks Algren's legs out from under him, and while Algren is sprawling
on the ground, Ujio kicks Algren's sword out of his hand, and starts away.
Again, Algren manages to stand up, and before Ujio can turn, charges him.
But Uji o doesn't need to turn. In a sliding move, he dodges and cracks Algren
in the side, then the legs, then the neck. Gasping for breath, at least one rib broken,
Algren writhes on the ground. Ujio digs the point of his sword into
Algren's hand until he releases his grip. Again Ujio kicks the sword away.
The ever-enlarging crowd gasps as Algren once again struggles to his feet.
This time without hesitation, Uji o runs back and rains blows upon Algren's
now defenseless body. First the wrist, then the back, then the stomach, then
finally the head.
Algren hits the ground, unconscious, his fingers still clutching the sword.
Ujio reaches down, pries it from his fingers, and breaks it across his knee.
VILLAGE
DAY
Katsumoto watches Ujio bark orders to the men he is training. A sudden
Movement of their eyes, causes Uji o to stop. He turns to find:
Algren standing at the end of the line, holding I wooden sword.
An almost imperceptible look passes bet ween Ujio and Katsumoto, but Ujio's
Resentment is over-ruled. Without a word, he continues.
Algren does his best to follow the exercise.
Katsumoto, the slightest hint of a smile on his face, walks away.
ALGREN (V.O.)
Each day I am confounded by their strange customs
and contradictions, savagery followed by
mildness.
We see the village swordsmith at work. He has been forging the same long samurai blade for months... Algren
watches him as he works.
53.
ALGREN (V.O.)
March 9. 1877. I have never known such a disciplined
people.
Algren trains with the other men. He attempts an attack, which is easily brushed aside by Nakao. Algren ends
up in the dirt again.
ALGREN (V.O.)
From the moment they wake, they devote themselves
to the perfection of whatever they pursue--
Algren walking with Katsumoto -- they are deep in conversation.
ALGREN (V.O.)
And yet the more time I spend here, the less I understand them.
VILLAGE
DAY
Two women are bowing repeatedly, chattering in smiling, earnest argument.
ALGREN (V.O.)
Everyone is polite, every nuance of behavior seems to
have a great meaning, and increasingly I am convinced
that the lower they bow, the leas they mean it.
YORITOMO'S
HOUSE
Algren, holding the wooden sword in 1870'5 baseball manner, is coaxing Higen to throw the ball at him. The
children laugh as Algren hits it onto the next porch.
Taka watches her sons impassively. It is dear how much they like Algren.
ALGREN (V.O.)
And I am sure they regard my wa ys to be as confounding
and unfathomable as I find theirs.
AN ICE CRYSTAL ON THE END OF A BRANCH
Starts to drip. SPRING bas begun.
BXT.
VILLAGE
DAY
Villagers laugh as they go about the business of life. A man throws a sack of rice to another. Two women hurry
awa y from a farmer who is teasing them.
Algren is once again among the training warriors. He and another man face off, each waiting for the other to
attack with his wooden sword.
54.
Algren moves first, but his opponent counters, and strikes him easily. They wheel around and engage again,
and again Algren is bested. Furious, he throws himself at his opponent, reverting to classic saber technique.
In a flurry of movement, his opponent manages to deflect the blows and also knock Algren to his knees.
Yoritomo approaches and bows.
YORITOMO
A1gren -San. Please forgive. Too many mind.
ALGREN
What?
YORITOMO
(pointing as he explains)
Mind sword, mind face, mind people watch, too many mind.
(on Algren's confused expression)
No mind.
ALGREN
No mind?
YORITOMO
Hai! No mind. You try.
Algren nods, uncertainly, and picks himself up. Again he faces the opponent, shaking off the tension and trying
to stay calm.
This time the opponent charges first, and Algren manages to parry one blow, before he is again bested.
Yoritomo bows happily and begins yammering in Japanese, clearly taking credit for Algren's progress.
Across the square, Katsumoto watches.
IMPERIAL PALACE GARDEN
DAY
The cherry blossoms have emerged, creating a scene of intense col or, beauty,
and serenity. The Emperor sits cross-legged next to a shrine. He is approached by Omura and two other
advisors.
.
OMURA
Your majest y, beg permission to approach.
(the Emperor nods)
Your humble servants are most anxious to know if his
Majest y has signed the order regarding the railroad progress.
EMPEROR
(after a long moment)
I am most impressed at the wa y the blossoms float
upon the air, as if held by unseen hands.
OMURA
Yes, they represent the highest form of gyoko.
About the order, your Majest y.
55.
EMPEROR
This railroad must go through Yoshino Province?
OMURA
It is absolutely necessar y your Highness.
EMPEROR
If you sa y so, I shall sign.
VILLAGE
DAY
Algren walks through the village, past the swordsmith who is now honing the blade, carefully sharpening it.
CHERRY TREE FOREST
DAY
Algren makes his way through a stunning cherry forest near the village. The pink and red blossoms are dazzling
and abundant. Other villagers can be seen gathering cherry bl ossoms.
It is a place of otherworldly beaut y.
It is all so beautiful that Algren just stops. Takes it in for a moment. He reaches out and touches a blossom.
KATSUMOTO (O.S.)
A perfect blossom is a rare thing...
Algren turns. Katsumoto is kneeling nearby, meditating.
KA TSUMOTO
You could spend your life looking for one.
And it would not be a wasted life.
ALGREN
Were you praying?
KATSUMOTO
Just sitting... I do not think I have the word.
Satori it means, maybe, awareness.
ALGREN
Of what?
KATSUMOTO
This moment alone, apart from all others ... You
know this?
(Algren shakes his head)
I am writing a poem about this time we hive spent.
I have only written one line on "His eyes were like my
own but seen through a deep and troubled ocean."
Can you suggest a second line?
ALGREN
I'm not much of a writer.
KA TSUMOTO
Is this why you spend so much time with your journal?
56.
.
ALGREN
How do you know that?
(no answer)
She told you.
Katsumoto appraises Algren.
ALGREN
Did you love her husband as your own son?
KA TSUMOTO
You have sent men to their deaths, just as I have.
ALGREN
The difference is, you feel nothing.
KA TSUMOTO
Before you were a soldier, you were a farmer.
ALGREN
What does that have to do with anything?
KA TSUMOTO
You lived on a farm. Or in a forest of trees.
ALGREN
How do you know?
KA TSUMOTO
The wa y you look at the cherry blossoms.
ALGREN
(reluctantly)
We lived in a place called Connecticut. My...brother
and I climbed the maple trees.
KA TSUMOTO
Were they beautiful?
ALGREN
Yes.
KATSUMOTO
And you were sad to see them die in the winter.
A beat. Something flickers in Algren's eyes.
KATSUMOTO
You were something before you were a soldier. You
were a boy who was sad to see the leaves fall and the
trees die.
Katsumoto looks at him deepl y.
57.
KA TSUMOTO
Like those trees, we are all dying. The future is
an illusion, our plans are an illusion, our fears an illusion.
We live life in every breath. Eat, drink, fuck. Now. Every cup
of tea. Every word we write... Every blossom we hold.
He smiles sadly.
KA TSUMOTO
Every life we take.
A beat. He stands, takes in the beautiful cherry orchard.
KATSUMOTO
Life in every breath. That is bushido. The wa y of the
samurai.
He goes. Algren stands for a moment deep in thought
VILLAGE
NIGHT
Yoritomo appears. He and Algren crawl out of the house just as the ground lurches
violently-
Part of the house contorts and caves in
Around the village, the wooden frame houses are swa ying and lurching they have some
torque, but not enough
Ujio directs the villagers as they battle a fire-
Taka appears, calling frantically for Toshiie.
Then an even larger seismic tremor suddenly TEARS THROUGH THE
VILLAGE
Houses are ripped apart -- the whole world shifting.
Though the smoke, Algren sees Toshiie cowering under an eave
58.
A heavy ceiling beam breaks loose, threatens to crush Toshiie
Algren dives forward, grabs Toshiie and pulls him out of the wa y... the front
of the house collapses, the beams smashing to the ground..
Taka and Higen race to Algren and Toshiie. The boy is safe.
Taka grabs the child and cradles him. Her look to Algren is fierce, protective,
almost feral -- as if he were the threat instead of the rescuer.
VILLAGE
DAY
Algren watches the villagers rebuild. Yoritomo and Higen strugg1e with a large
wooden framework.
ALGREN (V.O.)
I am str
uck by these people and their acceptance of Fate
in a1l it
s variations. At a time like this, they seem utterly
without
sentiment. Even the children have a gravity
beyond
their years.
Algren goes to them. Silently begins to help them.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
EVENING
Torches illuminate a small stage in the center of the village square. Several
samurai perform a ritualistic Noh drama. (A form which, by the wa y, the
samurai invented.) Others play flutes and large steel drums.
ALGREN (V.O.)
And yet I have never seen a people with more capacity
for the joy found in the simplest things of life.
59.
Katsumoto himself plays the lead role. An enthusiastic actor, he plays to the children in
the audience. They are delighted with his broad theatrics.
VILLAGE
DAY
Algren stands across from Ujio, ready again for the ken-jutso.
They stand frozen for a long time, hands on the hilts of their wooden swords.
Other samurai watch.
Algren and Ujio stare at each other.
But there is something different about Algren's expression. Not as much
fury and competition, more a sense of balance and alertness. He studies Ujio's eyes, his hands,
the folds of his kimono, the attitude of his body.
We watch A1gren closel y.
Gradually all SOUND drains away. We hear only Algren's steady breathing. He is
aware of everything. A bird in a tree. A woman grinding rice. A plum about to fall.
A gently swa ying battle flag,
Slow-motion as:
Algren attacks -- no fury, just control-- Ujio tries to deflect the blow, Algren
anticipates - he swings his sword elegantly - -Ujio blocks it -- Algren counters --
Algren presses forward, his sword slashing masterfully, forcing Ujio back
Ujio counters with complex moves as he retreats --Algren keeps moving
forward, calm -- finally Ujio's sword is swept aside in one clean
movement. Algren ends with the edge of his wooden sword It Ujio's throat.
The other samurai watch. Amazed.
Algren twirls his sword in a fancy cavalry "fl ourish." The pride he has alwa ys taken in his
swordsmanship has been restored. He bows to Uji o.
Ujio nods his head, slightly, in respect
The other samurai, led by the hearty Nakao, congratulate Algren.
DAY
Algren carries water from the river through a riot of spring wild-flowers. Something
makes him stop, and see the sunlit clouds in the deep blue sky, the colors around him, hear the
buzzing of the bees, feel the kill of the air.
A sudden flash of memory
His beautiful wife, in green field not unlike this one, laughing, tossing her hair, falling
back into the long grass.
Back to Algren
61.
The force of the memory causes him to link to the ground.
Another flash of memory, longer this time:
His wi fe leans over and kisses his mouth, and his cheek, and his forehead. He holds
her al tightly as be can.
Back to Algren
As tears begin to course down his face, and he sinks down into the flowers and the grass,
looking up into the impossibl y beautiful sky. He gives in to the sobs wracking his body.
VILLAGE
DAY
As Algren returns with the water, he sees Katsumoto approaching with Ujio and several warriors.
KATSUMOTO
The Emperor has requested my presence.
We leave tomorrow. You will be released in Tokyo.
He goes. Algren stands, not sure how to react.
KATDUMOTO'S VILLAGE
DAWN
Algren stands overlooking the village as the sun rises over the misty peaks.
ALGREN (V.O.)
These months have marked me, and I don't fully
know yet wh y.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
DAY
Algren prepares to mount up. Yoritomo says goodbye to his family.
ALGREN (V.O.)
I do know it is here that I have known my first
untroubled sleep in many years.
Taka comes to Algren, bows her head.
TAKA
(subtitles)
You are alwa ys welcome in our home.
ALGREN
Domo Arrigato.
He glances at the unfinished house.
62.
ALGREN
(subtitles)
...You will finish it soon.
TAKA
(subtitles)
If that is my destiny.
She bows her head again. Toshiie hands him a scroll: it is a picture of the
Family. Algren is included. Japanese characters list all their names.
Toshiie bows. Algren bows and tucks the scroll into his coat.
Algren and Yoritomo move out with Katsumoto, Ujio, Nakao and his bodyguard of several
dozen Samurai.
The villagers bow and honor the warrior as they pass.
MOUNTAINOUS LANDSCAPE
DAY
Algren trots alongside Katsumoto.
ALGREN
... The Emperor sends a message for you to return
to Tokyo, and you go?
KATSUMOTO
Yes.
ALGREN
Even though you're in rebellion against him.
KATSUMOTO
Against the Emperor? Never. I serve him. As
I have alwa ys done.
.
ALGREN
I don't understand.
KATSUMOTO
Our Emperor is young, and there are things I must
sa y to him.
ALGREN
But ever yone around him wants you dead.
KA TSUMOTO
And if the Emperor desires, I will take my own life at his
command.
He spurs his horse and rides on. A1gren watches him.
63.
MOUNTAIN VALLEY
SUNSET
They approach a large inn.
A boy working in the fields see Katsumoto approaching. He doesn't believe
it -- the Great Katsumoto. He drops his hoe and races awa y, calling out.
KATSUMOTO
We will stop here for the night.
MOUNTAIN VALLEY
SUNSET
Samurai guards have been posted around the perimeter.
AROUND THE INN
NIGHT
The samurai guards are alert, their senses heightened to almost superhuman proportions.
But there is another way. Another way of learning combat. A wa y without the
beaut y, the philosophy and the moral code.
They are almost imperceptible at first... their head-to-toe black clothes a perfect
camouflage... their silence and stealth are otherworldly.
66.
They were then known as Shinobi, masters of stealth and spying.
We know them as Ninjas.
They float across the ground ... creeping an inch ever y hour... complete
physica1 control. One black-gloved finger moves. Then the next...
They crawl and then wait
Poised on their fingertips and toes.
There is no sound as they strike.
The samurai guards are garroted in an instant. Other Ninjas catch the
samurai's weapons as they fall. No sound disturbs the peaceful night.
INN -- FRONT DOORWAY
NIGHT
Silence.
Two samurai guards are in position.
One of them glances up at the stars.
A Ninja throwing star instantly slices into his jugular-- blood sprays -- the other
guard turns  a series of Ninja slice into him...
INN--WALLS
NIGHT
Silence.
The Ninjas use mew claws to crawl up the walls like spiders.
INN  ROOF
NIGHT
Silence.
A samurai guard stands at the edge of the roof. A Ninja silently moves
toward him. Stops. Ten feet awa y.
He pulls out a shuriken -- a small needle-shaped projectile, dips it into a sack of
poison. Places it carefully into the palm of his hand. And with the flick of his
wrist--
The needle flies -- stabbing into the samurai -- he crumples.
Other Ninjas immediately pour over the edge of the roof -- catching the samurai before he falls...
INN
NIGHT
Outside of the inn, we slowl y pull away...
The sounds of the battle gradually fade...
Soon it is nothing more than a lovel y rustic inn nestled in the mountains.
TOKYO -- IMPERIAL PALACE
DAY
Algren, Katsumoto and the others are nearing the palace. Algren slows to a
stop -- his path is toward the city. Katsumoto stops, looks at him, then does
something absolutel y extraordinary.
He kneels and bows before Algren. Quickly touching his head to the dirt.
Then he rises, turns and walks toward the palace.
Algren stands, stunned.
PARADE GROUND
DAY
Algren walks onto the parade ground. The change he sees could not be more remarkable.
Thousands of new Japanese troops are drilling with new bolt-action Mausers. They
are precise, exact and frighteningly mechanistic, their uniforms new and crisp.
New German advisors are barking commands. Colonel Bagley sees him.
BAGLEY
Algren? My God, you never cease to astonish.
Bagley runs over, hand extended, but Algren turns to look at the troops.
ALGREN
They have new weapons.
BAGLEY
The Kaiser was only too happy to help. Along
with his friends at Mauser and Krupp. Thank God we
Americans still have a few teeth in our head.
And they come to the "teeth." Howitzer cannons. A row of them. Artillery
officers in US Army uniforms arc instructing Japanese offi cers.
BAGLEY
The ambassador and I have spent eight months
kissing Omura's ass so he'll sign the damn trade
pact with us. You spent all this time living with
those savages?
(A1gren looks at him)
He's going to want to talk to you...
ALGREN
I need a bath.
BAGLEY
And your back pay, I imagine.
Algren starts walking away.
72.
BAGLEY
They got their flag. ...See?
And we see it... snapping on I flagpole high above the parade ground.
It is immediately familiar. A red circle on a white field. The Rising Sun.
The Howitzers fire in sequence. Thundering blasts that shake the heavens.
EXT,
ROYAL TEMPLE
DAY
Omura stands above Emperor Meiji respectful but persistent.
The Emperor is kneeling, tending to his iris garden. It is one of the wonders of the Palace: a
sea of white, pink, blue, and purple blossoms.
Retainers and servants stand at a distance. One holds a standard with the Imperial seal: a yellow
chrysanthemum.
Omura sees Katsumoto making his way toward them. He talks a bit more quickly to the Emperor.
Katsumoto begins to prostrate himself before the Emperor, the usual sign of extreme
respect -- but the Emperor stops him:
EMPEROR
(subtitles)
No, Mori-san. We arc "civilized" now.
Katsumoto stops prostrating himself. The Emperor offers his hand.
KATSUMOTO
(subtitles)
I cannot touch the Sacred One.
EMPEROR
(subtitles)
You can.
It is a difficult moment for Katsumoto. He simply cannot do It.
OMURA
(subtitles)
Did you have a pleasant journey, Minister Katsumoto?
KATSUMOTO
(subtitles)
It was uneventful.
Omura appreciates Katsumoto's droll response. He assumes that Katsumoto is aware of
his part in the assassination attempt.
73.
EMPEROR
(subtitles)
If it is not a great imposition. I desire a moment alone with
Minister Katsumoto. Omura-San.
OMURA
(subtitles)
Enlightened One, perhaps I can be of service in a conversation
of state.
EMPEROR
(subtitles)
So kind of you, but I fear my old teacher wishes to upbraid
me in private for neglecting my studies.
Omura bows his head quickly and goes.
Silence. The Emperor gazes at Katsumoto. Then:
EMPEROR
(subtitles)
You rise against me, my teacher.
KATSUMOTO
(subtitles)
No, Highness, I rise against your enemies.
EMPEROR
(subtitles)
They are my teacher, my advisers, like you.
KATSUMOTO
(subtitles)
They advise in their own interest.
EMPEROR
(subtitles)
The world is changing, Mori -- you have not seen what
goes on beyond our borders, the inventions, the science.
I need men who can look outward, or soon we will be
left behind, and defenseless.
KATSUM OTO
(subtitles)
I am sworn to defend you even to my last breath.
EMPEROR
(subtit1es)
The samurai live in the past. You cannot defend against
a future you don't understand.
74.
KATSUMOTO
(subtitles)
If I am no use, then I will happily end my life,
EMPEROR
(subtitles)
No, Mori. It is my wish that you rejoin the Council of State.
I need your voice.
KATSUMOTO
(subtitles)
It is your voice that needs to be heard, Highness. You
are a living God, you can do what ever you
think is right.
The young emperor is silent a moment.
EMPEROR
(subtitles)
I am a living God only as long as I do what they
think is right.
KATSUMOTO
(subtitle)
Your Highness, may I beg forgiveness for saying
what a teacher must, that such a statement is pathetic
drivel not worthy of an ignorant stable boy, let alone
a young man I know to have some modest intelligence.
The emperor laughs warmly, almost happy to be scolded as he once was.
EMPEROR
(subtitles)
Is it possible a living God can be too afraid to make
his voice heard?
(Katsumoto's look is not unkind)
Tell me what to do, Mori-San?
KATSUMOTO
(subtitles)
You are emperor, my Lord, not me. You must find
the wisdom for all of us.
YOKOHAMA WHARF
DAY
A series of warehouses, beyond which we see warships in the harbor. A1gren walks
with Bagley and two other OFFICERS.
TOKYO STREETS
DAY
Algren fights the crowds with Colonel Bagley And Ambassador Swanbeck..
ALGREN (V.O.)
May 15, 1877. The city I return to is immeasurabl y
changed
New construction ever ywhere. Telegraph wires strung next to an ancient
temple. A modern European hotel is going up, dwarfing the traditional Japanese
buildings. Huge billboards advertising Western goods. A new invention, the rickshaw,
has replaced many of the palanquins.
ALGREN (V.O.)
As though Tokyo were determined to become
another New York or Chicago .- all in one
headlong rush.
Spider's web of telegraph cables spread from a tall new brick building.
It is like a New York office building stabbing into the heart of old
Japan.
The familiar Omura character is emblazoned on the side.
TOKYO  STREET
DAY
Graham walks with Algren.
GRAHAM
Leave? Wh y would you leave now? No white
man has ever been in your position. Do you
have any idea what it will mean to have Omura
as your friend? You want land, you want women,
you want boys?
Algren starts to walk faster, but Graham Stops him.
GRAHAM
Nathan. I wanted to leave, too. For three years.
You must believe me there is a majest y about
these people -- can you imagine what your own
country would be if it had half the drive and the
discipline and the belief and the bravery of these
ridiculous little people?
Then raised voices from across the street stop them.
They see Yoritomo surrounded by four Imperial Army soldiers. The soldiers
are rough and imperious, drunk with power. They carry gleaming rifle..
The soldiers bark orders. Yoritomo stands proudly, responding calmly.
ALGREN
Whit is this?
GRAHAM
My God, it's the edicts...
ALGREN
What edicts?
Algren arrives as the situation is clearly growing volatile - the soldiers are
pointing to Yoritomo's head, screaming
Algren steps toward the soldiers--
ALGREN
That's enough--
One of the soldiers SCREAMS at him -- raises his rifle -- all the soldiers raise their rifles 
Yoritomo reaches for his sword -- Algren tries to push through -
81.
ALGREN
(subtitles)
YORITOMO, WAIT!
One of the soldiers smacks Algren in the chin with a rifle butt. Algren reels,
and by the time he stands straight again, four others are pointing their
ba yonets at his face.
Graham takes hold of Algren's arm.
GRAHAM
Don't be stupid.
Algren makes eye contact with Yoritomo, who -- in deference to his friend --
puts his sword away.
The Japanese soldiers continue to scream at Yoritomo. They force him to his knees.
Rifles pressed to his head.
Yoritomo bows his bead, speaking quietly, as if praying.
Algren witches in horror all one of the soldiers removes his bayonet -- another grab.
Yoritomo's hair, jerks his head back and begins hacking off Yoritomo's traditional top-knot
of hair. Brutally. Blood.
Yoritomo remains kneeling, head down, blood flowing down his face.
The soldiers laugh and move off.
Algren kneels by Yoritomo. Yoritomo looks up at him. There are tears in
his eyes.
KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE
DUSK
Katsumoto's house on the outskirts of Tokyo is spacious and
harmonious. Utterly Japanese. Samurai guards in full regalia, stand
menacingly outside.
OUTSIDE KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE
NIGHT
Algren leaves Katsumoto's gate and sets off on foot.
TOKYO STREETS
NIGHT
As Algren walks, he becomes aware that he is being followed. Two dark figures
lurk some distance behind him. After a few moments, he whips around to face
them. They stand for a moment, then melt away into the shadows.
LIVING QUARTERS
AFTERNOON
A BEARER is loading the last of Algren's luggage on the back of a rickshaw.
Algren emerges from the building, sees the same two disreputable MEN
who followed him earlier lurking nearby.
He resists the temptation to confront them. Instead he climbs into the
rickshaw and it starts off.
But a moment later, Graham has jogged alongside, huffing and puffing.
GRAHAM
Thought I'd missed you. Were you going to leave
without even saying goodbye?
ALGREN
I have a fear of sentimental Englishmen.
GRAHAM
You sod.
(trying to keep up)
Christ, give us. . second here
Algren indicates for the bearer to stop. Graham tries to catch his breath.
GRAHAM
You're making a mistake, I promise you.
Katsumoto's under house arrest, Omura's made
his move -- he'll need you more than ever --
Graham stops, sees the look on Algren's face, realizes.
GRAHAM
Oh, my goodness. How silly of me.. All that
time you were with him, up in those mountains,
..................................
...I told you they were a remarkable people...
Algren doesn't answer, but isn't denying it either.
GRAHAM
Then you should get out. Because Omura will
become rather impatient with anyone who isn't on the team.
Graham notices Algren staring at his followers.
GRAHAM
Case in point.
ALGREN
Who are they?
GRAHAM
Ronin would be m y guess. Disgraced samurai
doing odd jobs for his Nibs.
87.
ALGREN
What do they want from me?
GRAHAM
To make sure you're on the side of God and
Country, or to make sure you get the hell out.
ALGREN
You've been a great help, Graham. I thank you.
GRAHAM
Look who's getting sentimental now.
A look bet ween them, then Algren nods for the bearer to continue.
HARBOR
SUNSET
Algren stands at the gangplank. Porters wait with his luggage. Algren looks
back into the crowd and sees the ronin. They glare back, no longer trying to
keep out of sight.
A BLAST from the steam whistle.
Algren looks from the ship, to the ronin, to the bustling, chaotic city behind
them. Finally, he looks out at the harbor and the ocean, beyond which
used to lie his home.
He turns to the bearer.
ALGREN
(subtitles)
Take back to quarters. I walk.
And Algren starts back into the city.
TOKYO STREETS
EVENING
Down a shadowy street, lit only by t orches. Slowl y we realize he is being
followed and that he knows it.
Up ahead, the street appears to dead-end.
The two Ronin step out from the shadows and face him, their hands on
their swords.
Behind him, Another dangerous looking Ronin joins the one who has been
following him.
They begin to close in.
Algren stands completely still. They grow closer.
Algren appears to close his eyes. And the sound of the approaching footsteps
fades as We HEAR ONLY the sound of his breathing.
88.
The Ronin draw their swords.
Algren gently opens his eyes. Ever ything has SLOWED DOWN: a sign in
the breeze, a piece of rubbish on the street, the flame of a nearby torch.
A BLUR OF MOTION.
Everything happens so fast it is hard to tell just what has taken place. In the
strobing shadows, all we really know is that Algren has leapt to the attack.
Within seconds, four bodies lie in the street
Algren holds bloody sword.
His face is cut and a sleeve of his jacket is ripped, but other than that he is
unharmed. Ujio has taught him welt
As he stands, catching his breath, we HOLD on his face in CLOSE-UP.
A sudden flash:
We see Algren grab one of the torches and smash it across the ronin's face.
It is the attack  replayed in real-time.
Rolling to avoid a death-blow, he grabs the fallen man's sword and eviscerates attacker #2.
The two remaining Ronin strike.
He parries the blow of attacker #3, whirls to slice the legs of attacker #4,
whirls again to cut off the hand of attacker #1, who has returned to the attack.
Meanwhile, attacker #3 serums and charges -- just lit attacker #4 is trying to stand.
Algren steps back as attacker #3 impales attacker #4. Algren steps forward and cuts off the head of attacker #3.
Even now, it has happened too fast to be truly appreciated.
BACK TO THE STREET
We move, closer-still on Algren's face.
A sudden flash:
And so we watch the attack again. in super-slow motion now, so we can fully
appreciate it's terrible beauty.
A torch smashes across a face.
A sword slices the sleeve of a coat.
Sparks fly as two swords meet.
89.
A severed hand falls in the dirt.
Blood sprays from a decapitated head.
A sword is wiped clean.
BACK TO THE STREET
In real time, Algren kneels to examine one of the dead Ronin. On his arm is
tattooed a familiar emblem:
The sign of the Omura Zaibatsu
OMURA CASTLE
NIGHT
Omura lives in a huge medieval castle on a promontory directly above Tokyo
Ba y. A testament to Japan's martial past.
CASTLE- MAIN GATES
NIGHT
The two rickshaws stop by the heavily-guarded main gates. Guards check the occupants. Motion
to other guards atop the gates.
The main gates slowl y swing open.
CASTLE - COURT YARD
NIGHT
The bearers lower the rickshaws. Algren and Bagley climb from one.
Ambassador Swanbeck climbs from the other.
CASTLE -- RECEPTION CHAMBE R
NIGHT
Omura waits in elegant evening clothes. A woman plays a harp. The interior
of Omura's castle is heavy, oppressive. Old Masters paintings dot the walls.
Leather-bound boob. Chippendale furniture.
OMURA
Gentlemen...
AMBASSADOR SWANBECK
Omura, you have a lovel y home. It must be very old.
OMURA
Nothing is "old" in Japan, ever ything is "ancient."
... But the views are pleasant. Sit down...
They move to chairs by the roaring fireplace as Omura turns to Algren,
noticing the cut on his face, but saying nothing.
OMURA
Do you know your Wagner, Captain? This is
the 'Leibestod' from Tristan and Isolde.
ALGREN
I'm surprised you enjoy it. Literally translated it
means `love/death. '
(looks at him)
.
A samurai concept, don't you think?
The two men take each other's measures. Servants appear with trays..
OMURA
Champagne? And cigars, of course.
91.
Servants light their cigars.
BAGLEY
(re: cigar)
A gift from President Grant?
OMURA
(smiles)
Queen Victoria.
ALGREN
Mr. Omura, may I use the necessit y?
OMURA
Certainly.
Omura summons a servant. The servant escorts Algren out.
OMURA
Now, Mr. Swanbeck, regarding our agreement, I noticed
a discrepancy in paragraph seven in reference to the
investment protocols for coal.
CASTLE COURTYARD
NIGHT
The guards look up, trying to determine where the cigar butt has come from.
But their curiosity lasts only a moment: ARROWS pierce their necks,
strangling any sound.
We REVERSE to discover that one of the rickshaw-bearers has fired the
arrows. As he peels back his hood, we SEE it is Yoritomo.
We realize the other bearers are Ujio, Nakao, and Simon Graham. They
hurry past the dead guards and up the stairs.
CASTLE - UPPER COURTYARD
FOLLOWING
Ten guards with rifles patrol the upper battlements.
Yoritomo and Uji o crouch and fire. Arrow a fter arrow a fter arrow, as
fast as a repeating rifle, the arrows streak through the night.
Completely silent.
It is a dazzling display. They time shots to sail over walls, shoot through
tiny windows, shoot out torches. Multiple arrows. Perfect aim.
In a matter of seconds all ten guards are dead.
They continue across the courtyard, up some steps --
SIEGE ROOM
NIGHT
Algren leads them into the highest room of the castle, the siege room. The
echoes Yoritomo's death rings in their ears.
.
Katsumoto glances at Ujio and Nakao. Without a word, they kneel on the
floor, open their kimonos and unsheathe their short-swords, preparing to
commit seppuku.
ALGREN
No. Wait...!
Katsumoto glares at him harshly, furious to have his concentration disturbed
at such a moment.
ALGREN
There's a wa y out. Look--!
Reluctantly, Katsumoto joins him at the window.
96.
ALGREN
This place is designed to keep people from getting
in, not from getting out. We can make it
KA TSUMOTO
This was your plan?
ALGREN
Do you have a better one?
Nakao and Ujio look at Katsumoto, awaiting his response. He turns to Algren.
ALGREN
I may die. But I'll die trying.
And without another word he LAUNCHES himself out the window, onto the sloping roof.
CASTLE ROOF TOPS
NIGHT
Like his cigar butt earlier in the sequence, he rolls, then falls, hits another
roof, rolls, slides, falls, hits again.
CASTLE ROQF TOPS
CONTINUOUS
Algren slides, bumps, rolls, falls, hits, then slides again. Until he finally plummets into the moat.
As his head rises above water, he lets out a scream of absolute joy.
HILLS
SUNSET
Algren, Katsumoto, and the others ride over rocky ground.
ALGREN (V.O.)
June 1, 1877. Yesterday, I passed the field where
Zebulon Gant was killed by the man with whom
I now ride.
In the distance a steam train chugs along. Inevitable. Progress.
FOREST  MOUNTAINS
DAY
They climb a steep trail. Beyond, the glaciers glow pink.
ALGREN (V.O.)
I am beset by ironies -- trained to fight rebels
now I am one. And yet 1 ask mysel f... can a man
be reborn?:
Algren, Katsumoto, and the others ride through a dense forest Katsumoto
reins his horse. The others follow suit. They wait
ALGREN (V.O.)
And if so, what would he make of it?
Mounted samurai emerge from the thick forest As it they were invisible.
98.
The leader leaps from his horse and bows, touching his head to the dirt.
All the other samurai follow suit.
CHERRY TREE FOREST--NEAR THE VILLAGE
EVENING
Katsumoto rides at the head of his samurai as they pass through the cherry
orchard. Then he reins his horse and falls in beside Algren.
KATSUMOTO
(his voice troubled)
I was prepared to die in Omura's castle. And
yet here I am. I cannot help but ask why were
you sent into my life. What is the lesson you
were meant to give me?
ALGREN
Maybe that neither of us is as smart as we
thought...
Katsumoto laugh. And then in a surprisingly deft imitation of Algren
KATSUMOTO
You...ain't whistlin' Dixie...
He spurs his horse and heads off. Algren shakes his head and follows.
VILLAGE
EVENING
The returning warriors are warmly welcomed by the villagers.
Algren rides directly to Yoritomo's house, dismounts.
Taka and Toshiie are waiting.
He goes to them. His expression tells them all they need to know.
VILLAGE
NIGHT
Higen stands, looking up at the stars.
ALGREN
Higen.
HIGEN
(subtitles)
My father taught me it is glorious to die in battle.
ALGREN
(subtitles)
That is what he believed.
HIGEN
(subtitles)
I would be afraid to die in battle.
ALGREN
(subtitles)
So would I.
100.
HIGEN
(subtitles)
But you have been in many battles.
ALGREN
(subtitles)
And I was always afraid.
Higen looks at him, tears welling in his eyes.
HIGEN
(subtitles)
I don't want you to go.
Algren has no answer. He can only gather the boy up in his arms and hold
him.
EXT VILLAGE DAY
Nakao is standing proudly, his massive arms folded across his chest. We
pull back: Graham is bunched behind his photographic equipment. A flash
of phosphorous and the moment is immortalized.
Meanwhile, Algren is working with Higen on the house.
Katsumoto silently watches Algren working with the boy.
KATSUMOTO
Algren-san.
Algren turns.
KATSUMOTO
They are corning.
EXT
MOUNTAINS
DAY
Algren and Katsumoto perch on a precipice, looking down into a valley.
It is a beautiful setting. Towering peaks and peaceful valleys. It is here that
the final act of the inevitable drama will play out.
Bel ow they see the Imperial Army, thousands strong, marching across the
valley toward them. Terrifying martial columns in strict formation.
ALGREN
I call it five thousand troops. They'll come in
waves of about a thousand, a few minutes between
each wave.
Katsumoto listens carefully to Algren's expertise.
101.
ALGREN
German formations have the infantry staggered
with on1y light flanking. They'll come straight on
with rifles and fixed bayonets. Mausers are only
accurate to about 150 yards. They'll look to
overthrow us.
Katsumoto takes this in.
VALLEY
DAY
Colonel Bagley, Omura, several German advisors and Japanese officers ride
at the head of the Imperial Army.
.
Bagley sees something, raises a hand. The troops halt.
Algren and Katsumoto ride up to them. Stop.
ALGREN
Colonel.
BAGLEY
Captain... (to Katsumoto)... Sir, the Imperial
Army of Japan demands your surrender. If you
and your fellows lay down your arms you will
not be harmed.
KATSUMOTO
That is not possible. As Omura knows.
Omura meets Katsumoto's look, nods. Bagley turns to Algren.
BAGLEY
Captain Algren, we will show no quarter. You
ride against us and you are the same as they are.
ALGREN
I take that as a compliment, Colonel.
(a deadly calm)
I'll look for you on the field.
Algren and Katsumoto wheel their horses and go.
MOUNTAIN RIDGE
DAY
Algren and Katsumoto ride.
ALGREN
They have the howitzers.
KATSUMOTO
How many?
ALGREN
About a dozen.
102.
Katsumoto considers this. Algren looks up into the mountains.
ALGREN
A man could get lost up there ... Build an army.
Hold out a very long time.
KATSUMOTO
Algren-san...Have you seen what happens to the
villages that stand In the way of the railroad?
Algren nods. He remembers.
KATSUMOTO
That is what will happen to my village if we do
not stand and fight.
(looks at him)
No. We serve the Emperor here.
ALGREN
By dying?
KATSUMOTO
Perhaps.
ALGREN
At least make it battle, not a suicide.
KATSUMOTO
And what would that accomplish?
Algren lifts his head, enjoying the feeling of the sun and wind on his face.
ALGREN
It might give you one more day ... One more
fine day like this.
Katsumoto stares at him for a long moment, then smiles and spurs his horse. Algren follows.
They ride together, side by aide, the wind billowing their cloaks -- We enjoy the
ride as they do, the trees strobing by, the sun slanting through the leaves.
VILLAGE
NIGHT
It is the eve of battle. And the samurai rejoice.
Katsumoto is on stage at the center of the village square, enthusiastically
performing a Noh drama. Algren sits with Toshiie and Taka in the audience,
enjoying Katsumoto's theatrics.
Other samurai can be seen around the village, eating, singing, and playing
instruments. Tonight is for celebrating life.
Elsewhere, a flash as Graham takes a photograph of some children.
103.
On the stage, Katsumoto spots Algren in the audience, points to him and
encourages him to join him. Algren resists. Toshiie prods him. Algren
surrenders and joins Katsumoto on the stage. The villagers are delighted.
Katsumoto embroils Algren in the performance. Algren does his best,
laughing at Katsumoto's antics.
It is the freest and happiest we have ever seen Algren. Time
SLOWS as we Savor his simple enjoyment
Toshiie is highly amused. Taka has a deeper response, she is moved as she
watches Algren give himself over to the part.
VILLAGE
LATER THAT NIGHT
A somber mood has descended. Algren sits and writes in his journal.
ALGREN (V.O.)
July 14, 1877. For so long now, I have managed
to convince myself that there was nothing worth
believing in.
A samurai plays a melancholy bamboo flute. The gentle sound floats through the village...
ALGREN (V.O.)
Certainly nothing worth dying for.
We see samurai preparing for the final battle. Some check
their armor... Others meditate...
ALGREN (V.O.)
Now I am not so sure.
Some make up their faces so they will look handsome when they greet death.
Some methodically polish their swords. Some sit with their families.
ALGREN (V.O.)
And so, for the first time in my life, I am truly
afraid. Not of dying. But of losing something
worth living for.
Ujio is performing a graceful, ritualistic sword-dance to the song of the flute.
Algren Joins Graham to watch him.
GRAHAM
What is it:? .
ALGREN
The kenbu,.. his dance of death.
Taka comes to them.
TAKA
(subtitles)
Algren-san, will you come with me?
104.
Algren leaves Graham and accompanies Taka toward the house.
They pass Higen and Toshiie, who sit with other children at the feet of the
massive Nakao, listening to a quiet story he tells,
KATSUMOTO'S HOUSE -- PORCH
LATER THAT NIGHT
The quiet evening continues.
Algren, now dressed in the kimono, finds Katsumoto carefully dropping little
leaves of incense into a small flame that simmers inside his battle helmet.
KATSUMOTO
So m y hair will have a pleasing scent when I
meet my ancestors ... (dry) ... You do not do this ?
Algren smiles, sits.
ALGREN
I studied war at a place called West Point. They
taught us about a battle called Thermopylae.
Three hundred brave warriors held off the king
of Persia's army of a million men. For two da ys
they made them pay so dearly that the king lost
all appetite for further invasion
(looks at him)
... I have some thoughts about the battle tomorrow.
KATSUMOTO
(bemused)
Do you really think we can defeat them?
105.
ALGREN
I sure as hell want to find out.
KATSUMOTO
You believe a man can change his destiny?
ALGREN
No ... But I think a man cannot know his destiny.
He can only do what he can, until his destiny is
revealed.
A si1ent beat.
Then Katsumoto picks up a long bundle wrapped in cloth. He unwraps it.
A beautilu1 long samurai sword.
He bows his head and offers it to Algren.
There are Japanese characters etched on the blade.
ALGREN
What does it say?
KATSUMOTO
"I belong to the warrior in whom the old ways
have joined the new."
Algren is moved beyond words. He bows.
As the CAMERA pulls away, Algren and Katsumoto squat side by side,
drawing in the dirt with a stick, planning the next day's battle strategy.
Across the square, Ujio continues his elegant dance of death, his graceful
form illuminated in silhouette by a fire.
YORITOMO'S HOUSE
DAY
Algren emerges from the house, wearing the breast-plate over his coat.
Taka is at his horse, tying a bag of food to the saddle. She turns and sees her
husband's armor on this man. And her breath stops.
Algren approaches her. They stand very cl ose.
TAKA
(subtitles)
Return.
106.
ALGREN
(subtitles)
If that is my destiny ... Anshinritsumai. [I
wish you peace.]
TAKA
Anshinritsumai.
He bows his head to her, she responds. The boys stand on the porch,
watching. He mounts his horse and trots off. They watch him go.
.
Algren joins the line of samurai leaving the village. It is the first time we have
seen them in their full battle armor since the battle in the fog.
Katsumoto in his black armor, Ujio in his jet black. And Algren in the blood-red
breast-plate. It is dazzling.
BATTLEFIELD
DAWN
We move along the line of waiting samurai. The faces are stoic. Prepared.
Their horses are corralled well behind them.
Algren stands with Katsumoto and Ujio. Graham is nearby. They peer into the
plain beyond.
They have chosen a strong defensive position. A steep mountain pass. Slopes on either
side create a funnel ahead of them. The Imperial Army will have to pass through the
funnel to reach them.
On a hill above them
Higen is revealed. He looks down first at the five hundred Samurai, then
sees, beyond, the overwhelming mass of the IMPERIAL ARMY.
Back on the battlefield
A distant thud followed by a high-pitched whine. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION
ahead of the Samurai. Artillery.
Algren finds Graham cowering at the base of a straw barricade.
ALGREN
Mr. Graham....
GRAHAM
Captain?
ALGREN
Would you please stay with the horses?
Graham would like to be brave enough to remain, but he is not a soldier.
GRAHAM
As you suggest.
107.
Graham starts to go --
ALGREN
Mr. Graham ... Take this.
From his coat, Algren takes his journal, hands it to Graham.
ALGREN
Maybe you can use it for your book.
GRAHAM
I will.
He heads back to the relative safet y of the horse corral.
Meanwhile, the samurai remain impassive as artillery is stepped in closer, the
range bracketed. Then artillery rounds begin to fall among them.
Samurai are blown to pieces as they bravel y stand and await
death. Katsumoto BARKS a command to Ujio.
Suddenly, the Samurai break ranks and trot into a new defense
alignment. The artillery rounds now fall ineffectually where once
they stood.
Bagley directs the artillery to be re-targeted, It is a laborious, clumsy
process. They fire again. Another command. The Samurai change
position again.
Bagley is furious. Their fluid tactics have rendered his field artillery useless.
Katsumoto and Algren share a look of grim satisfaction. They are leveling
the playing field.
Bugle calls are heard from the Imperial Army.
ALGREN
The call to advance.
The rattle of the snare drums. The sound of marching boots.
And then they appear. Thousands upon thousands of them. The Imperial
Army marching relentlessly forward in strict formation. The Rising Sun displayed.
Katsumoto gazes at the awe-inspiring sight. His 500 samurai face a staggering
5,000 soldiers.
KATSUMOTO
Tell me ... what happened to those three hundred
warriors at Thermopylae?
108.
ALGREN
(a grim smile)
Dead to the last man.
Katsumoto glances to him, smiles.
THE SAMURAI POSITION
CONTINUOUS
The First Division of the Imperial Army moves into the funnel, their numbers
reduced by the size of the access, and head toward the barricade.
Katsumoto and Algren watch as they move closer and closer. We
are expecting the samurai to open fire, but they do not. They just
wait.
Finally the Imperial soldiers are in rifle range. They stop to fi re a volley.
Bullets begin hitting among the samurai. Many fall.
Algren nods to Katsumoto, Katsumoto then calls out a command and the
samurai retreat.
They race back toward the rear of the funnel.
The Imperial Army soldiers climb awkwardly over the first barricade and
pursue--
The samurai, meanwhile, have taken cover behind a second barricade that
had been hidden from the Imperial soldiers' view. Now safel y behind
the second barricade, Katsumoto calls out a command and--
The samurai fire!
500 arrows explode -- almost instantly followed by 500 more --
Like an image from Agincourt, the clouds of arrows sweep across the sky --
Imperial Soldiers fall, the attack falters--
From behind the new barricades, archers fire FLAMING ARROWS, that
Hit the old barricade. It EXPLODES INTO FLAMES, trapping the Imperia1
Army bet ween the two barricades.
And from the second barricade, two large CA TAPULTS send balls of flaming
pitch into the already panicking soldiers.
OPPOSING HILL TOP
DAY
Colonel Bagley, Omura, several German advisers and Japanese Officers
watch through binoculars. Stunned. As the First Wave is routed.
HAGLEY
What the hell?
109.
OMURA
It seems Katsumoto will resist his destiny.
(snaps an order)
Send in the second wave. Two divisions.
BARRICADES
DAY
Algren and Katsumoto wait behind the second barricade. We note that this
barricade is the real thing.
Katsumoto removes a piece of shattered armor from his left forearm, a
bullet wound beneath. Algren looks over the barricade.
They see Imperial soldiers using semaphore flags to communicate with their commanders
on the opposing hilltop.
KATSUMOTO
How long?
ALGREN
They need to regroup and report our position. Then
they'll come hard.
Katsumoto considers the bodies of the dead Imperia1soldiers.
KA TSUMOTO
It is sad to see brave men die without faces... You cannot
tell one warrior from another.
ALGREN
They're not warriors. They're soldiers. It's a
modern army.
KATSUMOTO
Not my world anymore.
BATTLE FIELD
DAY
Bugles. The attack is reforming. Ranks now bolstered by reinforcements.
They come at a trot, through the narrow defile, skirting the first barricade,
continuing at a trot toward the second barricade.
2ND BARRICADE
DAY
Katsumoto pulls his long sword. Algren does the same.
Katsumoto calls out an order -- the archers fire another round.
The Imperial soldiers are being annihilated but still they come in great waves --
for ever y one who falls it seems there are ten to take his place.
They race forward, stepping over their fallen comrades, bayonets poised --
The Mauser rifles flash --
110.
Bullets explode around the samurai, many are hit.
The Imperial Army has been trained to keep firing on the run. The waiting
Samurai will be decimated, except --
From the hills on either side
Fully half of the Samurai force -- who have been kept hidden until this moment...
charge, screaming into the flank of the attacking Army. Even rifles cannot fire in
three directions at once.
Algren and Katsumoto lead the charge over the second barricade. Some are cut down,
but in moments swords engage ba yonets in brutal hand-to-band combat.
Algren And Katsumoto fight back to back, as if one person, slashing with their
swords, shattering bayonet, dealing death on all sides.
Ujio crouches, his back leg straight and planted, his front leg bent. Still using
his bow, firing off arrows with Stunning speed, refusing to budge--
On the opposing hillside
Bagley and Omura watch the battle through binoculars.
BAGLEY
A classic "V" ambush. Sonofabitcb is using
Welt Point tactics.
In the midst of the battle
A charging soldier thrust
s his bayonet into Katsumoto's arm - Katsumoto kills,
the soldier with his short
sword but is awkwardly tangled with his body, a second
soldier races toward him
for the kill - Algren spins and attacks killing the second
soldier - but a third races
toward Algren, bayonet f1ashing
He dodges -- but the bayonet slices into his side --
Algren kicks the soldier away -- tries to use his sword but the soldier springs
back ath1etically .. Ujio appears like a black spectral figure to deliver the
coup de grace.
All SOUND gradually fades and is replaced by the elegaic sound of a bamboo
flute... the images of combat become fragmented and impressionistic.
Bur no matter how bravel y the samurai fight, they are simply outnumbered...
Nakao is like a cornered bear, arcing his two swords wildly around him. He
is shot in the chest, and staggers a moment before continuing. Another
soldier shoots him in the arm at point blank range. Nakao', sword goes fl ying,
so the giant Samurai leaps forward and picks up the shooter bodily, twirling
him around like a wrestler, throwing him finally onto the upraised pike of a
fellow Imperial soldier. But now three more soldiers have levelled their
weapons, and a ruthless volley staggers him again. Shots rain on him as he
tries to continue fighting, but his strength leaves him. Finally, with one last
lunge, he manages to pull an Imperial soldier with him, crushing him as he falls.
111.
More and more fall as Algren, Katsumoto, and their comrades fight desperately...
The mournful flute is the appropriate accompaniment as Ujio is mortally
wounded. The grim award master is cut through with bullets. Still he fights.
An Imperial soldier holds up a rifle to protect himself, and Ujio's blade cuts
through the barrel. The soldier just has time to look at the gun in amazement
before a second sweep of Uji o's sword beheads him. But there are too many
to take the man's place, and finally fi ve men run Uji o through with bayonets,
and he is pinned against the barricade, still upright in death.
At last, what is left of this second wave of the Imperial Army, retreats.
PLAIN
ALMOST SUNSET
The plain before the barricade is littered with Imperial Army dead.
Algren and Katsumoto sit exhausted, leaning against the barricade. They are
both wounded.
Only about. hundred samurai are still alive.
Algren looks over the decimated warriors for a moment. Even those still
alive are in bad shape as they wait for the next wave of Imperial soldiers.
Katsumoto is looking at Ujio's body nearby.
KATSUMOTO
He was Kaishaku ... my trusted friend.
ALGREN
We won't be able to hold them back this time.
KATSUMOTO
This is not your battle. You do not have to die
here.
A long beat.
ALGREN
I died a long time ago.
KATSUMOTO
But now you live again.
ALGREN
Yes.
KATSUMOTO
It was not your time.
ALGREN
No. Maybe I survived just to live this one last day.
Algren looks at him.
112.
ALGREN
I'll stay.
He slowl y pulls himself up. He and Katsumoto gaze at the plain before them.
At the infantry troops massing on the opposing hilltop.
Algren looks at Katsumoto. He reaches into the pocket of his old uniform
and takes out the Medal of Honor he received, long ago, at Sutter's Hill.
He affixes it to his old cavalry tunic.
Katsumoto looks at Algren. They are both thinking the same thing.
Silent agreement.
PLAIN
SUNSET
The hundred mounted samurai are a beautiful sight.
They wait in formation in front of the barricade, the long plain through the
funnel to the opposing hilltop before them.
Katsumoto draws his long samurai sword.
Algren draws his.
And they slowl y begin to trot forward...
And then to canter...
BEHIND THE IMPERIAL ARMY
Colonel Bagley and Omura watch, transfixed. There is something
approaching admiration on Omura's face. On Bagley's, there is only malice.
BAGLEY
The gatling guns. Quickly.
PLAIN
SUNSET
Katsumoto points his sword and screams out his war cry. .
And they charge. It is suicidal
It is glorious.
It is the end of the samurai.
They charge forward, their war cries echoing in the canyon.
The Imperial troops fire rifles -- samurai fall .. but still they come: -- pounding
over the earth like something from an ancient dream
113.
Algren and Katsumoto charge side by side. Alive. Warriors.
BEHIND THE IMPERIAL ARMY
Bagley and Omura watch as the samurai fall, one by one.
WITH THE CHARGE
Fifteen or twenty of the samurai -- including Algren and Katsumoto--
somehow manage to fight their way through the lines.
They break into the open.
And continue riding straight toward the rear.
ALGREN AND KATSUMOTO
Are both wounded, yet still they charge. They have only one thought in
mind -- death to their enemies. They gallop forward toward Bagley and Omura.
BAGLEY
Looks around in abject terror. He screams out an order.
TWO WAGONS
Are moving into position. Their rear gates fall open ... revealing the GATILING GUNS.
ALGREN AND KATSUMOTO
Are near enough to see them. Yet they will not be deterred.
They charge on.
Up ahead.
THE GATLING GUNS
Are not yet ready to fire. Japanese soldiers slam ammo belts into the chambers.
ALGREN, KATSUMOTO AND THE REMAINING SAMURAI
Have almost reached their goal.
BAGLEY
Cowers in fear, looks around, but there is nowhere to hide.
THE SAMURAI CHARGE
Even while riding at I full gallop, they have fixed arrows into their long
114.
bows. They let loose a lethal volley.
BAGLEY
BAGLEY
Fire! Fire, dammit!!!!!
But before the guns can open up, he is IMPALED BY ARROW AFTER
ARROW, a human pincushion. The final arrow pierces his forehead.
Then...
The Gatling Guns finally fire. Ripping into the samurai-
Destroying them-
One after another is hit -- and still they come -- their voices raised in glorious cries of triumph-
Graham watches from a hilltop, tears in his eyes.
Katsumoto is hit, blood explodes .- his horse falls -- he spi1ls off--
Then Algren is hit -- he falls--
Algren drags himself to Katsumoto, bullets exploding ever ywhere 
Algren looks up to see...
The remaining samurai still charging-
And still the Gatling Guns tear through them--
And still they charge 
Until they are all down.
OPPOSING HILLTOP
SUNSET
A Japanese Officer shouts out an order -- the Gatling Guns stop.
Omura screams at him to continue firing!
The Japanese officer barks out response. Refusing.
Omura sees all the samurai are dead or dying.
But he also sees Algren kneeling by Katsumoto, dragging him awa y. He
screams at the Japanese officer to resume fire!
The Japanese officer refuses.
He just looks over the plain of dying samurai for a moment. Then he does
the most remarkable thing.
He slowl y kneels and touches his head to the dirt.
115.
Then a soldier near him does the same thing. Then another and another.
And then by the thousands.
They kneel and touch their heads to the dirt.
Honoring the last samurai.
PLAIN
SUNSET
A1gren drags the dying Katsumoto to a8 copse of cherry trees nearby...
CHERRY TREES
SUNSET
Both men are bleeding profusel y.
KATSUMOTO
Help me up...
ALGREN
Just -- stay there.
KATSUMOTO
Help me up.
Algren helps him to stand. Without Algren's support, he would fall.
KATSUMOTO
My sword...
ALGREN
No.
KA TSUMOTO
You have your honor again. Let me die with
mine ... Kaishaku.
Algren looks at him, deeply moved. Katsumoto manages to pull out his short sword.
KATSUMOTO
You must help me. Hold it firmly...
Algren supports Katsumoto as he holds the sword's point firmly to his stomach.
KA TSUMOTO
Are you ready?
ALGREN
No, Kaishaku.
116.
Katsumoto looks at him deepl y, warmly.
KATSUMOTO
We will ride together again.
Katsumoto embraces Algren firmly -- the sma1l sword impales him
Algren holds him tightly. Katsumoto is looking over Algren's shoulder as he dies.
Katsumoto sees something. A look of joy and absolute peace comes to his features.
KATSUMOTO
(whispers)
It is perfect... They are all perfect.
His eyes cl ose. He is dead.
Algren gently kneels with Katsumoto's body
He holds him for a moment and then turns to see what Katsumoto was looking at.
Cherry blossoms.
A display of perfect beauty.
We slowl y fade to...
VILLAGE
DAY
Spring. A few years later.
There are no samurai training in the square, but otherwise the village is
bustling with life. We HEAR Graham's voice:
GRAHAM (V.O.)
...And so the days of the samurai had ended.
VILLAGE
DAY
We see that Yoritomo's house has finally been completed.. Toshiie sits on the porch,
Instructing a group of younger children in calligraphy.
120.
GRAHAM (V.O.)
As for the American Captain, no one knows
what became of him. All that is left is his journal
which I have published, according to his last request.
Taka steps from the house and passes Toshiie, she carries a basket. We
move through the village with her...
GRAHAM (V.O.)
Some lay he died of his wounds, others that he
returned to his own country...
She passes an old man teaching the Noh drama to a group of teenagers.
She passes Higen, working on a new building. Apparently he has found a
good life as a carpenter. He seems content.
We go with Taka as she leaves the village...
CHERRY TREES
DAY
Taka moves through the cherry orchard.
GRAHAM (V.O.)
But I like to think he may have found at last
some small measure of the peace we all seek,
but few of us ever find.
Taka stops. Watching. We follow her gaze to discover:
Algren, sitting alone. Gazing peacefully sat the cherry bl ossoms.
Waiting for the perfect one. He turns to her, a smile of quiet joy spreads
across his face.
GRAHAM (V.O.)
Anshinritsumai. [I wish you peace.]
Fade out.
