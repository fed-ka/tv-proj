Heavy grey skies hang over a flooded field, the water two
feet deep. Cannons and carts, half-submerged and tilted,
their wheels trapped in the mud below the surface, are still
yoked to dead and dying horses and oxen.
A terrible battle is taking place; two infantry companies,
Negro Union soldiers and white Confederate soldiers, knee-
deep in the water, staggering because of the mud beneath,
fight each other hand-to-hand, with rifles, bayonets,
pistols, knives and fists. There's no discipline or strategy,
nothing depersonalized: it's mayhem and each side intensely
hates the other. Both have resolved to take no prisoners.
HAROLD GREEN (V.O.)
Some of us was in the Second Kansas
Colored. We fought the rebs at
Jenkins' Ferry last April, just
after they'd killed every Negro
soldier they captured at Poison
Springs.
ANACOSTIA RIVER - NIGHT
Rain and fog. Union Army companies are camped out across the
grounds. Preparations are being made for the impending
assault on the Confederate port of Wilmington, North
Carolina.
Two black soldiers stand before a bivouacked Negro unit:
HAROLD GREEN, an infantryman in his late thirties, and IRA
CLARK, a cavalryman in his early twenties. ABRAHAM LINCOLN
sits on a bench facing Harold and Ira; his stovepipe hat is
at his side.
HAROLD GREEN
So at Jenkins' Ferry, we decided
warn't taking no reb prisoners.
And we didn't leave a one of `em
alive. The ones of us that didn't
die that day, we joined up with the
116th U.S. Colored, sir. From Camp
Nelson Kentucky.
LINCOLN
What's your name, soldier?
HAROLD GREEN
Private Harold Green, sir.
2.
IRA CLARK
I'm Corporal Ira Clark, sir. Fifth
Massachusetts Cavalry. We're
waiting over there.
He nods in the direction of his cavalry.
IRA CLARK (CONT'D)
We're leaving our horses behind,
and shipping out with the 24th
Infantry for the assault next week
on Wilmington.
LINCOLN
(to Harold Green:)
How long've you been a soldier?
HAROLD GREEN
Two year, sir.
LINCOLN
Second Kansas Colored Infantry,
they fought bravely at Jenkins'
Ferry.
HAROLD GREEN IRA CLARK
That's right, sir. They killed a thousand rebel
soldiers, sir. They were very
brave.
(hesitating, then)
And making three dollars less
each month than white
soldiers.
Harold Green is a little startled at Clark's bluntness.
HAROLD GREEN
Us 2nd Kansas boys, whenever we
fight now we -
IRA CLARK
Another three dollars subtracted
from our pay for our uniforms.
HAROLD GREEN
That was true, yessir, but that
CHANGED -
IRA CLARK
Equal pay now. Still no
commissioned Negro officers.
LINCOLN
I am aware of it, Corporal Clark.
3.
IRA CLARK
Yes, sir, that's good you're aware,
sir. It's only that -
HAROLD GREEN
(to Lincoln, trying to
change the subject:)
You think the Wilmington attack is
gonna be -
IRA CLARK
Now that white people have
accustomed themselves to seeing
Negro men with guns, fighting on
their behalf, and now that they can
tolerate Negro soldiers getting the
same pay - in a few years perhaps
they can abide the idea of Negro
lieutenants and captains. In fifty
years, maybe a Negro colonel. In a
hundred years - the vote.
Green's offended at the way Clark is talking to Lincoln.
LINCOLN
What'll you do after the war,
Corporal Clark?
IRA CLARK
Work, sir. Perhaps you'll hire me.
LINCOLN
Perhaps I will.
IRA CLARK
But you should know, sir, that I
get sick at the smell of bootblack
and I can't cut hair.
Lincoln smiles.
LINCOLN
I've yet to find a man could cut
mine so it'd make any difference.
HAROLD GREEN
You got springy hair for a white
man.
Lincoln laughs.
4.
LINCOLN
Yes, I do. My last barber hanged
himself. And the one before that.
Left me his scissors in his will.
Green laughs.
TWO WHITE SOLDIERS have come up, two young kids, nervous and
excited.
FIRST WHITE SOLDIER LINCOLN
President Lincoln, sir? Evening, boys.
SECOND WHITE SOLDIER
Damn! Damn!
We, we saw you, um. We were at, at -
FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
We was at Gettysburg!
HAROLD GREEN SECOND WHITE SOLDIER
You boys fight at Gettysburg? DAMN I can't believe it's -
FIRST WHITE SOLDIER (CONT'D)
(to Green, with mild
CONTEMPT)
Naw, we didn't fight there.
We just signed up last month.
We saw him two years ago at the
cemetery dedication.
SECOND WHITE SOLDIER
Yeah, we heard you speak! We...
DAMN DAMN DAMN! Uh, hey, how tall
are you anyway?!
FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
Jeez, SHUT up!
LINCOLN
Could you hear what I said?
FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
No, sir, not much, it was-
SECOND WHITE SOLDIER
(he recites, fast and
MECHANICALLY:)
"Four score and seven years ago,
our fathers brought forth on this
continent a new nation, conceived
in liberty and dedicated to the
5.
proposition that all men are
created equal."
LINCOLN
That's good, thank you for -
FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
"Now we are engaged in a great
civil war, testing whether that
nation or any nation so conceived
and so dedicated can long endure.
We are, we are, we are met on a
great battlefield of that war."
LINCOLN
Thank you, that's -
SECOND WHITE SOLDIER
"We have come to dedicate a portion
of that field as a final resting
place for those who here gave their
lives that that nation might live.
It is..."
(He chokes up a little.)
FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
His uncles, they died on the second
day of fighting.
SECOND WHITE SOLDIER A VOICE (O.C.)
I know the last part. "It is, Company up! Move it out!
uh, it is rather -"
Soldiers all over the field rise up at the mustering of the
troops. Names of regiments, brigades, divisions are called:
all across the field, the men put out fires, put on
knapsacks.
LINCOLN
(to the two white
SOLDIERS:)
You fellas best find your company.
FIRST WHITE SOLDIER
(SALUTING LINCOLN:)
Thank you, sir. God bless you!
LINCOLN
God bless you.
The second white soldier salutes, and the two move out.
6.
Green salutes Lincoln as well and glances at Clark, who
remains, looking down. Green leaves. Clark looks up, salutes
Lincoln and, turning smartly, walks toward his unit.
Then he stops, turns back, faces Lincoln, who watches him. A
beat, and then, in a tone of admiration and cautious
admonishment, reminding Lincoln of his promise:
IRA CLARK
"That we here highly resolve that
these dead shall not have died in
VAIN -- "
Clark salutes Lincoln again, turns again and walks away.
Lincoln watches him go. As he walks into the fog, Clark
continues reciting in a powerful voice:
IRA CLARK (CONT'D)
" - That this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom --
and that government of the people,
by the people, for the people,
shall not perish from the earth."
Lincoln watches Clark until the fog's swallowed him up.
TITLE:
JANUARY, 1865
TWO MONTHS HAVE PASSED SINCE ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S RE-ELECTION
THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR IS NOW IN ITS FOURTH YEAR
A huge, dark, strange-looking steamship, part wood and part
iron, turreted like a giant ironclad monitor, is plowing
through the choppy black waters of an open sea.
Lincoln is alone, in darkness, on the deck, which has no
railing, open to the sea. The ship's tearing through rough
water, but there's little pitching, wind or spray. The deck
is dominated by the immense black gunnery turret.
LINCOLN (V.O.)
It's nighttime. The ship's moved
by some terrible power, at a
terrific speed.
Lincoln stares out towards a barely discernible horizon,
indicated by a weird, flickering, leaden glow, which appears
to recede faster than the fast-approaching ship.
7.
LINCOLN (V.O.)
Though it's imperceptible in the
darkness, I have an intuition that
we're headed towards a shore. No
one else seems to be aboard the
vessel. I'm alone.
A new flagpole is being dedicated. Lincoln, in a black
overcoat and his stovepipe hat, and Treasury Secretary
WILLIAM FESSENDEN, 59, stand by the pole. They face an
audience of officials, clerks, dignitaries, wives, soldiers.
A Marine band finishes a jaunty instrumental rendition of "We
Are Coming Father Abra'am."
12.
Two soldiers fasten a flag to the halyards. Lincoln moves
into place; as the crowd applauds, he takes a sheet of paper
from inside his hat and glances at it. Then he looks up.
LINCOLN
The part assigned to me is to raise
the flag, which, if there be no
fault in the machinery, I will do,
and when up, it will be for the
people to keep it up.
He puts the paper away. The audience waits, expecting more.
LINCOLN (CONT'D)
That's my speech.
He smiles at them. They applaud, some laughing. As Lincoln
turns the crank, hoisting the flag, a solo trumpet plays "We
Are Coming Father Abra'am" and the audience joins in. Among
them, Secretary of State WILLIAM SEWARD, 64, in a thick,
exquisite winter coat and hat, and Lincoln's dapper assistant
secretary, JOHN HAY, 27. Seward looks pleased.
AUDIENCE
"We are coming, Father Abra'am,
three hundred thousand more,
From Mississippi's winding stream
and from New England's shore..."
We leave our plows and workshops,
our wives and children dear,
With hearts too full for utterance,
With but a silent tear.
We're coming Father Abra'am..."
In a four-door carriage, top down, Seward sits opposite
Lincoln. Hay, next to Seward, organizes papers in a portfolio
on his lap.
SEWARD
Even if every Republican in the
House votes yes - far from
guaranteed, since when has our
party unanimously supported
anything? - but say all our fellow
Republicans vote for it. We'd still
be twenty votes short.
LINCOLN
Only twenty.
13.
SEWARD
Only twenty!
LINCOLN
We can find twenty votes.
SEWARD
Twenty House Democrats who'll vote
to abolish slavery! In my opinion -
LINCOLN
To which I always listen.
SEWARD
Or pretend to.
LINCOLN
With all three of my ears.
SEWARD
We'll win the war soon - It's
inevitable, isn't it?
LINCOLN
Ain't won yit.
SEWARD
You'll begin your second term with
semi-divine stature. Imagine the
possibilities peace will bring!
Why tarnish your invaluable luster
with a battle in the House? It's a
rats' nest in there, the same gang
of talentless hicks and hacks that
rejected the amendment ten months
back. We'll lose.
Lincoln smiles.
LINCOLN
I like our chances now.
A light snow's beginning to fall. A lacquered coach stands
outside the house, the Blair crest in gold on its doors.
Elizabeth Blair Lee, a blanket in her arms, comes out of the
house, talking to LEO, an elderly black servant, formerly a
slave belonging to the Blairs. They're followed by an elderly
black woman in a housekeeper's uniform.
ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
Leo, it's a hundred miles to
Richmond. Get him drunk so he can
sleep.
LEO
Yes'm.
Elizabeth goes to the carriage, where Preston awaits. She
passes the blanket through the carriage window and tucks it
around her father.
ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
Here, daddy.
23.
PRESTON BLAIR ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
Oh! Thank you. (fussing with the
BLANKET:)
Let's fix this up...
PRESTON BLAIR
Where's my hat?
ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE
Leo has your hat. All right?
As Leo climbs into the carriage, Elizabeth kisses her hand,
then slaps the kiss on her father's cheek.
ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE (CONT'D)
Go make peace.
JACOB GRAYLOR (D, PA) and Bilbo walk outside the Capitol.
Graylor looks over the prospectuses.
ROBERT LATHAM (V.O.)
We have one abstention so far -
RICHARD SCHELL (V.O.)
Jacob Graylor -
Graylor selects one and hands it to Bilbo.
RICHARD SCHELL (V.O.)
He'd like to be Federal Revenue
Assessor for the Fifth District of
Pennsylvania.
Schell stands at the door of a small, grubby row house. He
presents the folio, warped from its beer bath, to WILLIAM
HUTTON(D, IN), eyes red from crying, dressed in mourning
black.
Hutton slams the door in Schell's face. A funeral wreath that
adorns the door falls to the ground. A daguerreotype attached
to the wreath depicts a young officer, Hutton's brother
Frederick.
Representatives Merrick, Lanford, Benson, Stuart and Hanson,
the New York lame ducks, descend the stairs, discussing the
opening of the amendment debate, to which they've just been
listening.
Latham smoothly holds Hanson back from the group, extending a
hand, the still pristine portfolio under his arm. He smiles
as the other NY lame ducks proceed down the stairs, unaware,
then nods his head back up toward the Capitol steps, where
Bilbo and Schell wait. Latham opens the folio as he talks to
Hanson.
Bilbo walks with Clay Hawkins, who peruses the folio. Bilbo
has a small covered wicker basket slung over his shoulder.
Hawkins follows, happy and sick with fear.
CLAY HAWKINS
T-tax collector for the Western
Reserve. Th-th-that pays
handsomely.
W.N. BILBO
Don't just reach for the highest
branches. They sway in every
breeze. Assistant Port Inspector of
Marlston looks like the ticket to
me.
CLAY HAWKINS
Uh, boats, they, they make me sick.
Bilbo retrieves a snare; a small bird is trapped by the foot.
Bilbo stuffs the bird in the basket.
CLAY HAWKINS (CONT'D)
So just stand on the dock. Let the
Assistant Assistant Port
Inspector's stomach go weak.
Bilbo eyes Hawkins, who anxiously eyes the folio.
THREE UNION CAVALRY OFFICERS consult with THREE CONFEDERATE
CAVALRY OFFICERS, all mounted. The officers exchange
documents and salutes.
TITLE: NO MAN'S LAND
OUTSIDE PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA
JANUARY 11
The ranking Confederate trots to a buggy in which three
Confederate officials sit: Vice President ALEXANDER STEPHENS,
53, short; JOHN A. CAMPBELL, Assistant Secretary of War, 54;
and Senator R.M.T. HUNTER, 56. They're well-dressed for
winter, Stephens especially heavily bundled.
Stephens, Campbell and the indignant Hunter leave the buggy
and are escorted by Confederate officers to the waiting
company of Union cavalry and infantry.
A Union Army ambulance, a large American flag painted on one
side, driven by TWO BLACK SOLDIERS, stands near broken wagons
and a derelict cannon. ANOTHER BLACK SOLDIER stands at
attention by the ambulance's rear door.
The soldier, staring coldly at these men, gestures brusquely
to the ambulance. The Confederate peace commissioners
hesitate; Hunter stares in horror at the black soldiers. Then
Stephens pushes past Hunter. He nods to the soldier.
ALEXANDER STEPHENS
(with polite dignity:)
Much obliged.
He boards the ambulance. His fellow delegates follow in his
wake, Hunter glaring with defiant hatred at the soldiers
before climbing in.
Bilbo and Clay Hawkins are again in the woods. Bilbo, with
his basket, clutches a pair of noisy snared partridges.
CLAY HAWKINS
My neighbors hear that I voted yes
for nigger freedom and no to peace,
they will kill me.
W.N. BILBO
A deal's a deal and you men know
better than to piss your pants just
cause there's talk about peace
talks.
W.N. BILBO (CONT'D) CLAY HAWKINS
My neighbors in Nashville, Look, I'll find another job.
they found out I was loyal to
the Union, they came after me
with gelding knives!
Hawkins runs away from Bilbo. Bilbo chases him.
CLAY HAWKINS W.N. BILBO
(to himself, as he YOU DO RIGHT, CLAY HAWKINS!
runs:) AND MAKE YOURSELF SOME MONEY
Any other job. IN THE BARGAIN -
CLAY HAWKINS
(turning back to Bilbo:)
I want to do right! But I got no
courage!!!
Hawkins runs away, sobbing. Bilbo pursues.
W.N. BILBO
Wait!! You wanted, what was it, tax
man for the Western Reserve, hell
you can have the whole state of
Ohio if you -
Bilbo stops, winded.
W.N. BILBO (CONT'D)
Aw, crap.
Seward, smoking unhappily, strides toward his carriage, with
Schell, Latham and Bilbo in pursuit.
68.
SEWARD
Eleven votes?! Two days ago we had
twelve!! What happened?
RICHARD SCHELL ROBERT LATHAM
It's the goddamned rumors There are defections in the
regarding the Richmond ranks... Yes! The peace
delegation. offer!
SEWARD ROBERT LATHAM
Groundless. I told you that. And yet the rumors persist.
RICHARD SCHELL
They are ruining us.
RICHARD SCHELL
Among the few remaining
representatives who seem remotely
plausible there is a perceptible
increase in resistance.
Seward has reached the carriage, Bilbo alongside him. Before
the Secretary of State can climb on board, Bilbo shuts the
carriage door. Seward is outraged.
W.N. BILBO
Resistance, hell! Thingamabob
Hollister, Dem from Indiana? I
approached him, the sumbitch near
to murdered me!
Bilbo is talking to HAROLD HOLLISTER (D, IN), who pulls out a
derringer. Bilbo bolts, dropping the folder. He stops, runs
back, and bends to retrieve the folio as Hollister fires the
gun over Bilbo's head.
Seward, now inside the carriage, slams the door.
SEWARD
Perhaps you push too hard.
W.N. BILBO
I push nobody. Perhaps we need
reinforcements. If Jeff Davis wants
to cease hostilities, who do you
think'll give a genuine solid shit
to free slaves?
69.
SEWARD
Get back to it, and good day,
gentlemen.
Schell and Latham lean in to the carriage.
RICHARD SCHELL
We are at an impasse.
ROBERT LATHAM
Tell Lincoln to deny the rumors.
Publicly.
RICHARD SCHELL
Tell us what you expect of us.
SEWARD
I expect you to do your work! And
to have sufficient sense and taste
not to presume to instruct the
President. Or me.
Schell steps up on the running board, intent.
RICHARD SCHELL
Is there a Confederate offer or
not?
ULYSSES S. GRANT, 43, 5'7", beard, uniform worn and rumpled,
crosses the dock, followed by three aides.
They approach the gangway for the River Queen.
As a somber Grant disembarks with his aides from the River
QUEEN:
GRANT (V.O.)
"Office United States Military
Telegraph, War Dept. For Abraham
Lincoln, President of the United
States. January 20, 1865. I will
71.
state confidentially that I am
convinced, upon conversation with
these Commissioners, that their
intentions are good and their
desire sincere to restore peace and
union. I fear now their going back,
without any expression of
interest..."
Seward's voice takes over from Grant's.
GRANT (V.O.) (CONT'D) SEWARD (V.O.)
"...from anyone in authority, "...from anyone in authority,
Mr. Lincoln..." Mr. Lincoln..."
Lincoln and Robert are in the buggy driven by the old
soldier; a young bodyguard soldier sits beside the driver,
his rifle uselessly tucked under his legs. Lincoln is on one
side reading over a stack of documents. Robert's on the other
side of the buggy, staring sullenly at his feet.
The buggy stops outside an army hospital. Lincoln packs up
his papers.
ROBERT
I'm not going in.
LINCOLN
You said you wanted to help me.
ROBERT
This is - This is just a clumsy
attempt at discouragement. I've
been to army hospitals, I've seen
surgeries, I went and visited the
malaria barges with mama.
LINCOLN
She told me she didn't take you
inside.
ROBERT
I snuck in after - I've seen what
it's like. This changes nothing.
LINCOLN
At all rates, I'm happy to have
your company.
Stepping out of the buggy, he hands his folio to the
bodyguard and enters the army hospital.
Robert, brooding, waits in the buggy.
83.
Hearing a creaking, rumbling sound, Robert turns to see TWO
BLACK ORDERLIES in grey uniforms wrangling a large top-heavy
wheelbarrow, covered with filthy canvas. One orderly pushes
while the other keeps the barrow from tipping over.
Robert notices, in the barrow's wake, a trail of blood. He
gets out of the buggy and follows as the orderlies turn a
corner of the building.
Behind the building, where the ground is bare, pitted with
puddles of water, Robert watches as the orderlies reach the
edge of a shallow pit. One orderly pulls the canvas back,
revealing severed legs, arms, hands, rotten, burnt, shattered
by bullet or bomb.
Robert watches as they toss the remains into the pit.
Quicklime is shoveled atop the limbs.
Robert walks away, unsteady.
Around the corner, he fumbles through his pockets for rolling
paper and tobacco. He locates these and tries to focus on
rolling a cigarette, his hands shaking. He tries harder to
control his hands, his feelings, but he can't. He has a panic
attack, crying, hiccupy shallow breathing, face flushed.
Frustrated, he throws down the cigarette and tries to hold
back tears.
LINCOLN (O.C.)
What's the matter, Bob?
Robert looks up, mortified, to see Lincoln watching him with
concern. He wipes his eyes, his mouth.
ROBERT
I have to do this! And I will do it
and I don't need your permission to
enlist.
LINCOLN
That same speech has been made by
how many sons to how many fathers
since the war began? "I don't need
your damn permission, you miserable
old goat, I'm gonna enlist anyhow!"
And what wouldn't those numberless
fathers have given to be able to
say to their sons - as I now say to
mine - "I'm commander-in-chief, so
in point of fact, without my
permission, you ain't enlisting in
nothing, nowhere, young man."
84.
ROBERT
It's mama you're scared of, not me
getting killed.
Lincoln slaps Robert in the face. It shocks them both.
Lincoln tries to embrace Robert, but Robert shoulders past
him and walks back toward the front of he building. He turns.
ROBERT (CONT'D)
I have to do this! And I will! Or I
will feel ashamed of myself for the
rest of my life. Whether or not you
fought is what's gonna matter. And
not just to other people, but to
myself.
I won't be you, pa. I can't do
that. But I don't want to be
nothing.
He hurries away.
LINCOLN
We can't lose you.
The carriage has pulled up and Mary is entering the White
House. Lincoln helps Mrs. Keckley down from the carriage.
She hesitates before proceeding in. Then she faces Lincoln.
ELIZABETH KECKLEY
I know the vote is only four days
away; I know you're concerned.
Thank you for your concern over
this, and I want you to know:
They'll approve it. God will see
to it.
LINCOLN
I don't envy him his task. He may
wish He'd chosen an instrument for
His purpose more wieldy than the
House of Representatives.
ELIZABETH KECKLEY
Then you'll see to it.
88.
Lincoln looks at her, considering. Then:
LINCOLN
Are you afraid of what lies ahead?
For your people? If we succeed?
ELIZABETH KECKLEY
White people don't want us here.
LINCOLN
Many don't.
ELIZABETH KECKLEY
What about you?
LINCOLN
I...I don't know you, Mrs. Keckley.
Any of you. You're ...familiar to
me, as all people are.
Unaccommodated, poor, bare, forked
creatures such as we all are. You
have a right to expect what I
expect, and likely our expectations
are not incomprehensible to each
other. I assume I'll get used to
you. But what you are to the
nation, what'll become of you once
slavery's day is done, I don't
know.
ELIZABETH KECKLEY
What my people are to be, I can't
say. Negroes have been fighting and
dying for freedom since the first
of us was a slave. I never heard
any ask what freedom will bring.
Freedom's first. As for me: My son
died, fighting for the Union,
wearing the Union blue. For freedom
he died. I'm his mother. That's
what I am to the nation, Mr.
Lincoln. What else must I be?
Lincoln stands in front of William Hutton's row house,
talking to Hutton. The funeral wreath still hangs on the door
behind them, displaying the marks of time passing: faded,
weatherbeaten, dusty.
WILLIAM HUTTON
I can't make sense of it, what he
died for. Mr. Lincoln, I hate them
all, I do, all black people. I am a
prejudiced man.
The door opens slightly behind Hutton. His wife looks out.
Hutton exchanges a glance with her, and the door shuts again.
97.
LINCOLN
I'd change that in you if I could,
but that's not why I come. I might
be wrong, Mr. Hutton, but I
expect... Colored people will most
likely be free, and when that's so,
it's simple truth that your
brother's bravery, and his death,
helped make it so. Only you can
decide whether that's sense enough
for you, or not.
Hutton walks slowly back to his house.
LINCOLN (CONT'D)
My deepest sympathies to your
family.
Lincoln goes back to his buggy. Hutton pauses at his door to
watch Lincoln's buggy drive away.
Hay and Nicolay emerge. They see Bilbo running, far ahead.
Hay immediately sprints after him and trips. Nicolay
continues running.
Bilbo puffs his way across the portico, through the door, and
up the stairs. Hay gains on him. It's become a race!
In the second floor hallway, Bilbo gets winded, and Hay
dashes past him. Hay reaches the doors to Lincoln's office
and flings them open.
A field telegraph has been set up near the steps, at the
front of the enormous crowd that's assembled before the
Capitol. Poles are held up in the crowd by soldiers along
which the telegraph wire is stretched.
108.
A soldier stationed at the door of the Capitol relays the
vote to another soldier manning the cipher key:
SOLDIER
Webster Allen votes no.
The cipher operator instantly transmits.
Celebrating crowds move towards the Mall, singing, carrying
placards proclaiming the passage of the amendment.
Thaddeus Stevens is hobbling in the opposite direction,
making difficult headway against the crowd, pushed and
shoved, unrecognized; he shoves back, his ferocious scowl
utterly at odds with the prevailing festive mood.
He reaches a modest house, unlocks the door and steps inside.
VIRGINIA - LATE AFTERNOON
Sailors cheer Lincoln's arrival. Lincoln walks across the
gangway. Seward greets him amidst the cheers.
Like a vision of apocalypse, a city on the banks of a broad
river is being consumed in a hellish fire, as artillery
shells rend the dark sky asunder, raining down destruction.
The morning is grey, and a dense fog covers a vast field.
Lincoln, his stovepipe hat atop his head, is mounted on a
horse on a rise at one end of the field. Behind him, several
UNION OFFICERS are also mounted. It's chilly; the breath of
the men and the horses is visible.
TITLE: OUTSIDE PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA
APRIL 3
Lincoln flicks the reins of his horse, which starts down the
slope. The officers follow behind him. No one speaks.
119.
Lincoln rides slowly, his focus on the ground before him.
Debris is scattered all around him, along with the bodies of
fallen soldiers.
He looks up and across the battlefield; a terrible battle has
concluded a couple of hours ago.
Looking down, as he rides, he sees soldiers killed by
artillery fire, whose bodies lie twisted, burned, headless,
limbless, torn in two, blown out of their clothing or charred
too badly to tell. He sees soldiers killed by rifle and
bayonet, whose corpses are intact.
At the beginning of his ride, all the dead and wounded are in
Union blue, the casualties of Confederate cannon fire, felled
as the Union army, about six hours earlier, began its final,
successful drive to break through Confederate lines.
As Lincoln and his escorts move across the battlefield, grey
and blue uniformed corpses and badly wounded men intermingle.
He reaches the other side of the field, passing a Confederate
flag to enter the now-ruined town of Petersburg.
HEADQUARTERS, ON MARKET STREET, PETERSBURG - MORNING
Grant, smoking his cigar, his uniform dusty and rumpled, is
sitting on the small porch. He stares piercingly at Lincoln,
in a rocker next to him, watching his troops pass by as they
move in to secure the conquered town. Lincoln closes his
eyes.
He has grown older, the skin around his eyes is cobwebbed
with fine creases, and his hair's thinner, softer, suffused
with grey. His brow has grown smoother.
LINCOLN
Once he surrenders, send his boys
back to their homes, their farms,
their shops.
GRANT
Yes sir, as we discussed.
LINCOLN
Liberality all around. No
punishment. I don't want that. And
the leaders - Jeff and the rest of
`em - if they escape, leave the
country while my back's turned,
that wouldn't upset me none.
120.
When peace comes it mustn't just be
hangings.
GRANT
By outward appearance, you're ten
years older than you were a year
ago.
LINCOLN
Some weariness has bit at my bones.
(BEAT)
I never seen the like of it before.
What I seen today. Never seen the
like of it before.
GRANT
You always knew that, what this was
going to be. Intimate, and ugly.
You must've needed to see it close
when you decided to come down here.
LINCOLN
We've made it possible for one
another to do terrible things.
GRANT
And we've won the war. Now you have
to lead us out of it.
AFTERNOON
OFFICERS OF THE CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMY stand around in
the afternoon sun. Everyone's solemn, even stunned by what's
just happened. No one is speaking.
TITLE: APPOMATTOX COURTHOUSE, VIRGINIA
APRIL 9, 1865
ROBERT E. LEE comes down the steps of the McLean house, as a
CONFEDERATE OFFICER brings his horse to him. His face is
blank. Lee mounts his waiting horse.
Lee should leave, having just surrendered to Grant inside;
but he's immobile. Some of the officers of both sides look at
Lee, some can't bear it. Lee tries out various expressions:
pride, defiance, blankness.
Grant stomps onto the porch of the house, followed by his
staff. Among them is Robert Lincoln.
121.
Grant, lost in thought, stops, taken aback, realizing that
Lee's still there, astride his horse. Everyone looks at the
two men who look awkwardly at one another.
Then Grant removes his famous slouch hat. Everyone freezes
for a moment, and then one by one, the officers of the Union
Army remove their hats.
Lee is visibly moved by this gesture of respect. He raises
his hat, briefly, only an inch from his head. Then, pulling
slightly on his horse's reins, he rides away.
A beautiful spring afternoon. Lincoln and Mary are riding in
the buggy, driven by the old soldier.
MARY
You've an itch to travel?
LINCOLN
I'd like that. To the West by rail.
MARY
(shaking her head no:)
Overseas.
LINCOLN
The Holy Land.
MARY
(a laugh, then:)
Awfully pious for a man who takes
his wife out buggy-riding on Good
Friday.
LINCOLN
Jerusalem. Where David and Solomon
walked. I dream of walking in that
ancient city.
She seems sadder. They ride in silence.
MARY
All anyone will remember of me is I
was crazy and I ruined your
happiness.
LINCOLN
Anyone thinks that doesn't
understand, Molly.
She nods; then, tenderly:
122.
MARY
When they look at you, at what it
cost to live at the heart of this,
they'll wonder at it. They'll
wonder at you. They should. But
they should also look at the
wretched woman by your side, if
they want to understand what this
was truly like. For an ordinary
person. For anyone other than you.
Lincoln laughs, takes her hand. She leans against him.
LINCOLN
We must try to be happier. We
must. Both of us. We've been so
miserable for so long.
Lincoln, wearing spectacles, stands at a podium before the
Capitol Dome, still under scaffolding, under cloudy skies. He
reads from the two pages.
LINCOLN
Yet, if God wills that it continue
until all the wealth piled by the
bondman's two hundred and fifty
years of unrequited toil shall be
sunk, and until every drop of blood
drawn with the lash shall be paid
by another drawn with the sword, as
was said three thousand years ago,
so still it must be said "the
judgments of the Lord are true and
righteous altogether."
He glances at his audience: 40,000 people from all over the
country, wounded soldiers, civilians in black. And for the
first time, in the crowd, not at its edges, hundreds of
African Americans, civilians and soldiers.
126.
LINCOLN (CONT'D)
With malice toward none, with
charity for all, with firmness in
the right as God gives us to see
the right, let us strive on to
finish the work we are in, to bind
up the nation's wounds, to care for
him who shall have borne the
battle, and for his widow and his
orphan, to do all which may achieve
and cherish a just and a lasting
peace among ourselves and with all
nations.
FADE TO BLACK.
THE END
