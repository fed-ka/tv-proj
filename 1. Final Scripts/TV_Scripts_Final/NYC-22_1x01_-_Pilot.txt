      EXT. 22ND PCT.   7:00 AM

      (Covers Upper West Side north to South Harlem.) It s a bunker-
      like concrete fortress built in the Lindsay era; pure siege 
      mentality.

      INT. 22ND PCT.   SAME

    Day tour coming in; midnight shift leaving; victims on 
      benches, community advocates milling, last night s collars 
      sleeping in cells.

    We see them all enter; dazed, jazzed, scared a little; the 
    dry cleaning in their arms consisting of half a dozen never-
      worn patrol and dress uniforms.

      Kiterunner approaches the Desk Sergeant, ROY RYAN (42).

                                  KITERUNNER

                    What is?

      Ryan stares at him as if he s brain dead. Kiterunner moves 
    on.

                                  TONYA
                    How you doing sir, Tonya Perez

      KITERUNNER S POV - THE VETS

      Some, but not all, of the old timers are giving him a 
      thousand yard stare.

                                                                    FLASHBACK TO:

      Kiterunner (15) grabs the fighter s arm. The guy raises his 
      truncheon to bash his head in. 

      Kiterunner, a martial artist, breaks his arm. You can hear it 
      snap. The guy is moaning in the dirt.

      Kiterunner s family all stare at each other - oh shit...

    As Kenny jams his uniforms inside, the others lay theirs on 
    the bench in front, waiting their turn.

      CLOSE ON   A BOOT, kicking all the uniforms to the floor;

                    expect you to pitch in and keep 
                    things moving along.                                                                                    9.

                    weeks, and finally last night a 
                    GCG, Trevor Lemon, got shot in the 
                    leg, suspect in the wind, so we re 
                    expecting payback today, tonight

                    not limping? You confiscate it. You 
                    see anyone with a backpack they 
                    could have a gun in there, stop him 
                    and search that bag. Keep your eyes 
                    open, be careful and stay on your

      their posts.

    As our six rookies blink into the sunlight of their first 
      day...

      They turn and see their new FTObeckoning from the driver s 
      seat of an NYPD van.

    As YODA drives them to their posts:

      ROOKIE S POV   FROM INSIDE THE MOVING VAN

      Rolling view of the precinct starting with apartment houses 
    on the side streets, brownstones, retail shops, bars and 
      restaurants on the avenues   solid urban middle class - then 
    as they head further north, to more down-at the-heels 
      streets; mix of old Harlem tenements and brownstones starting 
    to be gentrified; a cappuccino joint cheek and jowl with a 
      bodega; a wine bar next to a funky barber shop; funeral home 
      next to a day spa.

      White House and Franchise exiting on a somewhat rundown 
      stretch; corner stores, old walk ups and a playground. Older 
      people stare at them from stoops, teenagers (GCG) from the 
      playground benches. Clueless, the two rookies stare back.

      EXT. VAN

    We see Tonya and Lazarus exit onto Footpost42. Tenements and 
      corner stores.

      A cappuccino shop and a yoga studio mark the newcomers. They

                    The whole thing out here, is we got 
                    maybe two dozen sets all hatin on 
                    each other. Right now we just want 
                    to stop these two from goin to war 
                    long enough for them to forget and 
                    get into it with somebody else. 
                    Then we do the same thing with 
                    those two. It s called the mobile 
                    scarecrow.

                                  UNIT MEMBER

                    Damn, that new blonde bitch is 
                    mine.

      This is said to White House s back. She stops in her tracks.

                                  WHITE HOUSE
                    Excuse me.

    She turns around and calmly walks back to the bench where 
      they re all eyeing her like candy.

      Franchise moves to back her up but Terry stops him. She s got 
    to deal on her own.                                                                                    16.


      White House gestures to the kid who called her out, as she 
      walks a little away from the others.

                    Ray Brightman. I used to read your 
                    stuff when I was a kid.

                                  LAZARUS
                    That there, is called a left-handed 
                      compliment.

                                  TONYA
                    Like no offense but how old are 
                    you?

                                  LAZARUS
                    Old enough I had to threaten sue to 
                    get into the academy. Call me 
                    Lazarus.

                                  TONYA
                    But you were a good reporter, what 
                    you quit for?

                                  LAZARUS
                    I didn t, I was fired. Budget cuts.

                    But a cop?

                                  LAZARUS
                    Why not? Besides after 14 years on 
                    the street half the time I had 
                    better informants than the 
                    detectives I was writing about.

                          (musing)
                    Lazarus. You wrote about my family 
                    once.

                                  LAZARUS
                    I did, no offence, but they were 
                    some serious thugs, sorry.

                                  TONYA
                    Sorry my ass. That s why I became a 
                    police. Butchie, you want to be a 
                    criminal? Angel, Rocky, you too?

    As the rookies watch, the detoured traffic is getting out of 
      hand, traffic agents overwhelmed.

      There s almost a fender bender between a Hummer and a yellow 
    cab as the two vehicles charge the same opening.

                                  HUMMER DRIVER (29)
                          (to Pakistani cab driver)
                    In America, there s a thing called 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    23.

                                  HUMMER DRIVER(29)(CONT'D)
                    alternate feed, you camel riding 
                    hump!

    The cab driver comes flying out, livid, and bearing a tire-
      iron.

                                  TAXI DRIVER (51)
                    I am here ten years, you asshole! 
                    How about I kick you fake Rambo
                    ass!

    The Hummer driver jumps out with a steering wheel lock.

                                  KENNY
                    Let s go.

                                  KITERUNNER
                          (in Urdu, to the cabbie)
                    Brother, I hope you re gonnause 
                    that to fix a flat.

    The cabbie is stunned to hear a cop speak to him in his 
      native tongue.

                                  KITERUNNER (CONT D)
                          (in Urdu)
                    You want to stay here another ten 
                    years? Or go back to Karachi?

      ANGLE   KENNY confronting the Hummer driver.

                                  KENNY
                    Back in the car, back in the car.
                          (into the driver s window)
                    Now, it s either drive time, or
                          (displaying plastic cuffs)
                    overtime, and I could use the money 
                    so why don t you haul ass.

      ANGLE   KITERUNNER leaning into taxi window.

                                  KITERUNNER
                    Let him [Hummer] go first, get some 
                    distance.

    The Pakistani driver, chilled out now, examines Kiterunner s 
      uniform then smiling, pats his badge.

                                  CABBIE
                    This I dig.

      Yoda driving White House and Franchise somewheres.                                                                                    24.


                                  YODA
                    There was a cop retired about 
                    twenty years ago died last winter 
                    always lived in the precinct. Back 
                    in the day when this whole area was 
                    like hell s hundred acres, every 
                    cop in the house moving to the 
                    suburbs, this guy raises a family 
                    here because he liked the people.

      Yoda pulls up to an old multi-family brownstone, right on the 
      dividing line of affluence and hardship.

                                  YODA (CONT D)
                    And his widow Ginny, she ll be here 
                    until they carry her out feet 
                    first. We always keep an eye on 
                    Ginny, help her out and today...

      INT. BROWNSTONE

      Rundown but respectable, the three of them climbing murky 
      stairs.

                                  YODA
                    Ginny sgot a bit of a problem.

      GINNY(74), diminutive, feisty, glasses and a housedress, is 
      waiting for them at the top of the stairs

                                  GINNY
                    JaysonToney. I heard you were 
                    coming to the two-two. Me and my 
                    husband saw every game you played 
                    from Bishop Jamesonto the pros.

                                  FRANCHISE
                    That s kind of you, thanks.

                                  GINNY
                    Can you fix a toilet?

                                                                      SMASHCUT TO:

      FRANCHISE - On his knees before the overrunning bowl, White 
      House and Ginnybackseat driving.

                    Whoa, wait, turn the shut off 
                    valve.

                                  FRANCHISE
                    The what?                                                                                    25.

                    Behind the toilet, down, right 
                    there, no, the other way, the other 
                    way.

                                  GINNY
                    You know what pissedme off about 
                    you? You could have been one of the 
                    great ones but you had to be a 
                      playa-jerk. No interest in defense, 
                    got so much as a runny nose you 
                    benched yourself, missed practices, 
                    out of shape, hitting every pimp 
                    and felon nightclub in the country, 
                    and jumping into the stands that 
                    time to go after some knucklehead 
                    heckler? What were you, twelve?

                                  WHITE HOUSE
                          (handing him a plunger)
                    Make sure you cover the outflow 
                    drain.

                                  FRANCHISE
                    You mean the hole, right?

                                  WHITE HOUSE
                    Do you want me to take over?

                                  FRANCHISE
                    I got it.

                                  GINNY
                    And then you show up that year 35 
                    pounds overweight and lose the 
                    point guard slot to Reggie Mayo? 
                    Reggie Mayo! You could ve eaten him 
                    for breakfast. In fact you looked 
                    like you did eat him for breakfast.

      Franchise, stressed, takes it out on the plunger, slamming it 
      into the water like harpooning a whale, and soaking himself.

    ON WHITE HOUSE   Wincing.

      INT. DOAAPT. - 1:30 PM

      Lazarus and Tonya in the living room, dying, opening all 
      windows, turning on the AC.

                                  TONYA
                          (heading out)
                    Screw this.                                                                                    26.

                    Where you going?

                                  TONYA
                    I m buying some incense from the 
                    botanicaon 83rd.

                                  TONYA
                    Screw him too. This is personal. 
                    Yoda.

                                  LAZARUS
                    I once wrote a piece on a bad 
                    police shooting involving his 
                    nephew up in the Bronx. You think 
                    that s why? Guy never even said 
                    anything to me.

      Tonya gives him a hard knowing look that s difficult to 
      decipher and leaves the apartment.

      INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Tonya cursing to herself as she waits for the elevator.

    ON TONYA   As the elevator door opens. What she sees, at 
      first shocks, then slow- burn angers her.

      REVERSE   ANNA FOSTER (31) standing there with a punch bruise 
    on her cheek.

                                  TONYA
                    Hey, you live here?

                                  ANNA
                          (hiding her bruise)
                    No. I mean yeah.

                                  TONYA
                    Take me to your apartment?

                                  ANNA
                    No.

                                  TONYA
                    I just want to see everything s OK.

                                  ANNA
                    Everything s OK.                                                                                    27.


                                  TONYA
                    I just want to talk. Which 
                    apartment?

      Tonya steers the woman down the hall, taking over.

                                  ANNA
                    Please...

                                  TONYA
                    Is he in there?

                                  ANNA
                    Please stay out...

                                  TONYA
                    It s either me or the entire 7th 
                    cavalry.

      Anna, against her will, unlocks the door to 

      INT. APARTMENT

      thatis nicely appointed but is in a state of chaos.

    Her husband, ERIC ROYCE (33) drunk, wild-eyed, appears, gawks 
    at Tonya.

                                  ERIC
                    Who are you?
                          (to Anna)
                    What did you do?

                                  TONYA
                    Sir, what happened to her face?

                                  ERIC
                    I don t believe this! You know it 
                    was an accident!

                                  ANNA
                    Eric, I m so sorry...

                                  TONYA
                    Sir, look at me.

    As she reaches for her radio, Eric walks out of the room.

                                  TONYA (CONT D)
                    Hey! You stay...

    And before she can finish her sentence, he s returned with a 
      shotgun.                                                                                    28.

                          (taking Tonya s gun and 
                          radio)
                    I gave her everything she ever 
                    wanted for ten years, get fired for 
                    doing the right thing, and now 
                    she s leavingme?

                                  TONYA
                    Eric, listen to me...

                                  ERIC
                          (pacing)
                    What do I do, what do I do, what do 
                    I do...

      Tonya furtively eyes her gun across the room.

                                  TONYA
                    For starters, how about you don t 
                    make it worse for yourself.

    She inches forward, her gun a little closer.

      INT. HOSTAGE APT. - 2:00 PM

      Tonya is seated on the floor, Anna standing against a wall, 
      Eric waving the shotgun from one to the other as he paces 
      like a liquored up loon.

                                  ERIC
                    Top pharmaceutical salesman in my 
                    division for seven years running, 
                    never made less than six figures in 
                    commission but I always plowed that 
                    back into deferred stock because 
                    this new cholesterol pill we were 
                    developing was going to blast 
                    Lipitorright off the market, just 
                    hang on for FDA approval. Shock of 
                    the century, FDA gives it thumbs 
                    down. Why?
                          (patting his own bald 
                          head)
                    It, caused, baldness. The stock 
                    went through the floor, and I had 
                    three and a half million in 
                    deferred commissions and bonuses 
                    drop to thirty thousand dollars 
                    overnight... Then I find out half 
                    my bosses and their pals sold off 
                    most of their stock only two months 
                    before the FDA made its 
                    announcement. Made out like 
                    bandits. I contact the SEC, SEC 
                    says two months is too long before 
                    the sell off to qualify for insider 
                    trading, sends me on my way. Three 
                    days later I get fired, no reason 
                    given. The SEC says if it s 
                      retaliation it didn t leak from us, 
                    maybe you should get a lawyer and 
                    what does shesay? What does my 
                    loving wifesay? I m leaving you...

    As White House improvises a plumbing snake, Franchise moves 
    to the living room hung with old family photos and police

    He casually looks out the window.

    But a moment later, someone in the shop is placing a potted 
      Aspidistra in the front window.

    He quickly scans the street looking in vain for that big

                    day, every day in the library, 
                    reading, preparing, filing, two 
                    years of banging my head against 
                    the wall and I can t even get in 
                    front of a judge, I can barely make 
                    my nut, I can barely feed my 
                    family, I can t even take care 
                    of...

                                  LAZARUS
                    Listen to me, Eric. You play this 
                    the right way, you put down the 
                    gun, your story comes out, the 
                    lawyers will line up for you just 
                    for the publicity and you ll get 
                    your day in court. But... if you 
                    play this wrong? That s a whole 
                       notherkind of story cycle.

                          (imitating Anna)
                    Oh Mary, I can t take it anymore, 
                    we re coming to Seattle you got to 
                    put us up.                                                                                    37.


                                  TONYA
                    Who s  us ?

                                  ANNA
                    It was supposed to be temporary, 
                    Eric, we need a break from each 
                    other.

                                  ERIC
                          (singing  Have Mercy )
                    Went to see the gypsy, here s what 
                    the gypsy said, she said Eric, your 
                    girl she s gonnaleave you, her 
                    bags are packed up under the bed, 
                    have mercy, have mercy baby...

                                  ANNA
                    Eric stop it, just stop!

      ANGLE   TONYA looks to the guns across the room, looks to 
      Lazarus, as Eric takes another slug.

                                  TONYA
                    Eric can I stand up? My back, I 
                    have a bad disc.

                                  ERIC
                          (tearing up as he rants)
                    You know where I work now? Gold s 
                    Discount Electronics. Can I 
                    interest you in a Blue-Ray of the 
                    new re-expanded Avatar? Or perhaps 
                    our new Gorilla cable? I mean,  cuz
                    you don t know what it s like to 
                    watch a football game on TV until 
                    you watch it with a Gold's Discount 
                      Electronics Gorilla cable.

      Tonya slowly rises, Lazarus, alarmed, has no choice but to 
      rise too. She gestures for him to step away from her, to 
      create two separate targets.

      Panicked, Eric s aim swivels between the three of them.

                                  TONYA
                    I told you I have a bad disc.

                                  LAZARUS
                    Eric, help us help you.

      Suddenly a look of epiphany comes over Eric s face; and he 
      actually smiles.                                                                                    38.


                                  ERIC
                    You want to help me?

      Startling them both, he kicks their guns back to them across 
    the floor.

                                  ERIC (CONT D)
                    Lock and load!

      They scoop up their guns and aim at his head, Eric with the 
      shotgun on his wife.

                                    TONYA/LAZARUS
                    Put it down! Put it down!

                                  ERIC
                    I kill her, you kill me, suicide by 
                    cop right?

      It s a 3-way stand-off.

      Suddenly, from a back bedroom a baby starts to wail.

                                  TONYA
                          (calmly)
                    You kill her, we kill you, who gets 
                    the baby?

      Eric quickly claps his hands to his ears to shut out the 
      wails.

      They have a split second to blow him away, but being rookies, 
      they hesitate to kill.

      Then Eric recovers, the  opportunity  lost, his shotgun back 
    on his wife.

                    care of the people I love and try 
                    to do the right thing. You know

                                  LAZARUS
                    Hey Eric, listen to me, look at me, 
                    I busted my ass for 14 years, go 
                    into work one day, my stuff is 
                    already in a box on my desk. I 
                    crawl into a bottle for an entire 
                    year after that and lose my wife 
                    and child. I was broke drunk and 
                      familyless. But I pulled myself 
                    together, and the world came back. 
                    It comes back, Eric.

                                  ERIC
                    Did your wife come back?

                          (hesitates, lies)
                    Yes.

      Eric can tell he s lying, is fixed on the haunt in Lazarus  
      eyes.

                                  ANNA
                    Eric, please, I ll stay with you, I

      EXT. POST 43   3:00 PM

      Kenny and Kiterunner.

      Despite Terry s warning to disperse for the day, at least 
      half of the 40 Wolves are back to hanging out in front of 
      their row of walk ups. To the naked eye they just look like a 
      bunch of high school aged (and younger) boys, playing cards, 
      talking quietly to each other or on their cell phones.

    But there s a slight air of being on their best behavior, 
      like they ve all got a secret.

      KENNY S POV   The young mouthy T-Rex.

    The only kid who looks hyper, like the secret is too much for 
      him.

                                  KITERUNNER
                    They were told to book. Let s run 
                    them off.

                                  KENNY
                          (eyes on T-Rex)
                    They re just there. I want to check 
                    them out a little.

                                  KITERUNNER
                    Man, how do you keep so calm?

                                  KENNY
                    My family s been wearing blue since 
                    before I was born. I know the 
                    drill.
                          (beat)
                    You think you re the only one who s 
                    got something to prove? My great-
                      grandfather locked up Willie 
                    Sutton, I got a great uncle who 
                    arrested Crazy JoeyGalloand my 
                    father was part of the team who 
                    arrested Son of Sam.

                                  KITERUNNER
                    I don t know any of those people; 
                    were they terrorists?

                                  KENNY
                    Funny.                                                                                    41.


                                  KITERUNNER
                    Then they re just criminals.

      KENNY S POV   He sees T-Rexhead off alone to the corner 
      store.

                                  KENNY
                          (following)
                    You want some coffee?

                                  KITERUNNER
                          (reaching for money)
                    Tea, no milk, two sugars.

                                  KENNY
                    I got it.

      INT. CORNER STORE   CONTINUOUS

      T-Rex, big-eyed, jumpy walks to the soda cases in the back of 
    the musty cramped store. In here he looks like the pre-
      pubescent child that he is.

                                  KENNY (O.S.)
                    How you doing.

    Kid flinches as Kenny makes himself a coffee.

                                  T-REX

                    are you so jumpy about? The drama s 
                    over for today right? Nobody 
                    getting busy?
                          (T-Rexclucks his tongue

      a stoop alone, away from the rest of the 40 Wolves, catching 
    his breath.

      freaking out T-Rexwithout acknowledging him.

                    want to call for...

      Abruptly, all 20 of the GCGs, suddenly brandishing weapons, 
    go charging as a group out of the playground.

    It looks like they re going to attack the rookies but they 
      veer at the last moment towards Footposts42 and 43, towards 
    the 40 Wolves.

                                  WHITE HOUSE (CONT D)
                    Goddamn!

      White House and Franchise have no choice but to run parallel 
    to the pack trying to head them off, but the GCGsaren t even 
      paying attention to them.

      EXT. FOOTPOST 43

      Kenny and Kiterunner turn to the sound of two beer bottles 
      smashing into each other, two more weapons.

    See a similar sudden massing of 40 Wolves, one kid (Paris) 
      charging out of a walkupwith a baseball bat, howling like a 
      banshee and before they can react, the Wolves are off running 
    at full speed towards Footposts42 and 41, towards the GCGs
      running full speed at them.

      Like White House and Franchise, all they can do is run 
      parallel, attempt to cut them off but the Wolves only have 
      eyes for the other gang.

      OVERHEAD   See the charging gangs racing towards each other 
      from Footpost41, from Footpost43, the cops trying to keep 
    up until they all COLLIDE at Footpost42.

      CLOSE ON - THE ACTION, din of battle, kids wailing on each 
      other, getting hit, cut...

    All four cops are now in the middle, back to back to back to 
      back.                                                                                    47.


      Wherever they can, they disarm, they tackle, they cuff, they 
      disperse. They trade blows.

      They are heroically standing their ground (it helps that the 
      gangs don t care about them).

      CLOSE ON   KITERUNNER   A whirlwind, a martial artist, 
      snatching weapons, side-sweeping kids to the ground and 
      cuffing them, disarming jagged bottles, slashing razors, 
      wresting away pipes and bats.

      CLOSE ON   WHITE HOUSE   Also a trained combatant (ex-MP) 
      mixing it up with a big teenager and holding her own, on the 
      verge of slamming him to the street and cuffing him when 
      FRANCHISE, assuming she s in over her head, wrestles the kid 
      away from her and subdues him on his own. White House is 
      PISSED.

      CLOSE ON   KENNY - Cuffing a kid, looks up and sees...

      LITTLE T-REX- Just standing there in the middle of 
      everything, immobile, big-eyed. And behind him, a big GCG is 
      wielding an iron pipe, taking it back for a full swing as if 
    to knock his head off his shoulders.

                                                                      SMASHCUT TO:

      KENNY,

      flinging himself at T-Rex, tackles him, taking the brunt of 
    the swing on his own shoulder but saving T-Rex slife.

    IN THE DISTANCE   Can be seen the 7th Cavalry, patrol and 
      anti-crime cars, misery lights flashing, sirens wailing AND 
      JUST LIKE THAT all combatants, en masse, GCGsand Wolves 
      almost pulling each other along like comrades, start to haul 
    ass out of there.

      Lazarus still has his gun aimed at Eric; Eric has his gun 
      trained on his wife. He s banging on the baby s bedroom door 
    but he can t afford to look away from Lazarus.

                    What are you doing! What s 
                    happening!

      Lazarus makes eye contact with a now hyperventilating Anna,

                    Somebody call an ambulance for the 
                    baby!

    At that, Eric freaks and shoulders his way into the baby s 
      room where Tonya has been waiting for him out of his sight 
      lines and elbows him in the face, then grabs the barrels of 
    the shotgun, raising them high while bullinghim backwards 
      into the living room.

      Anna, ignoring them both, goes charging into the baby s room.

    ON ERIC AND TONYA   wrestling for the shotgun.

    ON LAZARUS   leaping in from behind, getting Eric face down 
    on the floor, the shotgun skittering across the room.

    ON TONYA   cuffing him.

      LAZARUS POV  

                                  TONYA (CONT D)
                          (holding the shotgun)
                    It s not loaded.

                          (sobbing re: suicide by 
                          cop)
                    I m so sorry. I just wanted to end 
                    it.

    ON ANNA   crying with empathy.

      Lazarus and Tonya exchange glances; they re in the shitnow.

                                  LAZARUS
                          (on radio)
                    Post 41 to Central...

      EXT. FOOTPOST 42 - POST-BATTLE MOP-UP

    The four rookies are winded, bruised, a little bloody but 
      still standing.

      Most of the gangbangershave fled.

    But some are laying on the ground in cuffs being harvested by 
      Tony Howard s Gang Unit.

                                  TONY
                          (to the rookies, pissed)
                    This all here? You people are 
                    dumber than a bag of hammers.

    ON ROOKIES   WTF?

    But when they look at Yoda...

    ON YODA   He s even more pissedthan Tony.                                                                                    52.


      EXT. DOA SAPT. HOUSE   30 MINUTES LATER

      Eric, in cuffs is put into a radio car, the shotgun being 
      carried by a detective.

                                  LAZARUS
                     Trust you?   Cover you?  What the 
                    hell was that?

                                  TONYA
                          (in shock)
                    What did I do again?

      Anna comes out with the baby.

    As the radio car pulls out, Anna hails a taxi.

    ON ANNA - For a moment it looks like maybe she s leaving him 
      after all but...

                                  ANNA
                    Where s the precinct house?

                                  LAZARUS
                    Just follow them.

      Yoda in his van is glaring daggers at them too.

      A sedan pulls up, a rumpled young man with a forensics bag 
      steps out.

                                  YOUNG MAN
                    I m from the Coroner s Office.
                          (beat)
                    So where s the stiff?

      INT. PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM - 4:00 PM

    End of tour. Yoda has gathered all 6 rookies in a funky 
      windowless room.

                                  YODA

                    This was not a good start. You four 
                      [Franchise, Kiterunner, Kenny, 
                    White House], you're all standing 
                    there like Little Big Horn in the 
                    middle of a bangerwar. Were you 
                    sick that day in class when they 
                    taught you how to use your radio? 
                    BECAUSE NOT ONE OF YOU CALLED IT 
                    IN. NOT ONE OF YOU CALLED FOR 
                    BACKUP. And youtwo [White House, 
                      Franchise,] you go at each other 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    53.

                                  YODA (CONT'D)
                    like the Bickersons, got no focus 
                    out there except for each other. If 
                    you don't get it together, you re 
                    looking at transfers to separate 
                    boroughs. You[Kiterunner], you got 
                    way too big of a chip on your 
                    shoulder, unless you start cooling 
                    out, you're not gonnamake it on 
                    this job at all, and you[Lazarus], 
                    you let your partner just wander 
                    off, then you disobey a direct 
                    order by wandering off yourself? 
                    But you [Tonya], you are the 
                    greatest screw-up in this room, not 
                    only do you disobey a direct order, 
                    but you WALKED INTO A DOMESTIC ON 
                    YOUR OWN, ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS 
                    MISTAKES IN THE BOOK, you put your 
                    ownlife at risk, you put your 
                    partner'slife at risk, you put 
                    that woman'slife at risk.

                                  TONYA
                    Hey, I wasn't the one with the 
                    shotgun.

      Tonya talking back makes everyone flinch.

                                  YODA
                          (quietly)
                    I am one heartbeat away from 
                    telling you to clear out your 
                    locker.

      Tonya holds his stare, not backing down. You could hear a pin 
      drop.

                                  YODA (CONT D)
                          (rising to exit)
                    Not a good start at all.

                                  KENNY
                    Boss, can I just ask... How dthe 
                    other rookies do today?

                                  YODA
                          (after a beat)
                    Worse.

      INT. MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - 15 MINUTES LATER

    Our four male rookies are redressing into their civvies.                                                                                    54.


                                  LAZARUS
                    Anybody feel like throwing back a 
                    few? Celebrate Survivor: New York?

                                  KENNY
                    It's four in the afternoon.

                                  LAZARUS
                    So?

                                  KITERUNNER
                    I don't drink.

                                  FRANCHISE
                    Too early for me, man.

                                  LAZARUS
                    Really? Just a beer.

                                  KENNY
                    See you tomorrow, bro.

      Lazarus watches the three young men exit, feeling his age.

                                  LAZARUS
                    If anybody changes their mind, I'll 
                    be at Hanratty's.

      EXT. PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS

      Kenny, heading out after the tour, is accosted by Michelle, 
    the sister of T-Rex, the kid Kenny saved.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (offering her hand)
                    I'm Michelle Terry.

                                  KENNY
                        (a little flustered)
                    I know.
                          (beat)
                    Kenny McCormack.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (still holding his hand)
                    I wanted to meet you to say thank 
                    you for what you did.

                                  KENNY
                    What I did?

                                  MICHELLE
                    You saved my brother from God knows 
                    what kind of injury.                                                                                    55.


                                  KENNY
                    He s OK?

                                  MICHELLE
                    Yeah, are you?

                                  KENNY
                          (blushing)
                    Me? I ll live.

                                  MICHELLE
                    Good.
                          (beat)
                    Look, I need for you to know that 
                    T, he s a pretty good kid, but he s 
                    got to show heart out there, 
                    especially  cause he s a newcomer.

                                  KENNY
                    You got to keep an eye on him.

                                  MICHELLE
                    See, that s the thing. I can t 
                    mother him in front of the others, 
                    that would be like a disaster, and 
                    I can t lock him in the house, 
                    so... I was thinkin ... given
                    you re gonnabe out in Wolf 
                    territory for awhile maybe you 
                    could kindakeep an eye on him for 
                    me.
                          (beat)
                    He s just a child...
                          (beat)
                    and I would surely appreciate it.

      CLOSE ON, Michelle slowly sliding her fingers out of his 
      grasp.

                                  KENNY
                          (flustered)
                    They move us around a lot.
                          (beat)
                    But I ll see what I can do.

                                  MICHELLE
                          (leaving)
                    Alright then, thank you.

    ON KENNY - Watching her go... Gangbanger'ssister.                                                                                    56.


      EXT. PLAYGROUND - 4:30

      Franchise, in jeans, shooting hoops by himself in the 
      playground where he confronted Mo Bailey.

      White House, wanting to make things less tense between them, 
      steps onto the court.

    At first they don't know what to say to each other.

      Then they silently start to shoot around.

      Then just for the hell of it, White House drives on him, 
      Franchise easily blocking her shot.

    She tries again, and again, getting nowhere against this NBA
      level player, but she's into it; he's into it.

      They start to sweat, two spectacular looking young athletes, 
      it's getting physical, real physical.

    And then White House, as if hearing some internal alarm bell 
    go off, just stops, a little shaken, and walks off the court 
      without a word.

      Franchise, rattled, stares after her.

      EXT. BUS STOP - SAME

      Tonya, in civvies, waiting in a crowd.

      TONYA'S POV - YODA in his van, beckoning to her.

      INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

                          (breaking angry silence)
                    What the hell were you thinking?

                                  TONYA
                    You're going to start in on me all 
                    over again?

                                  YODA
                    Just answer me.

                                  TONYA
                    No. You answer this. Why'dyou 
                    stick me with that DOA. To keep me 
                    off the street?

                                  YODA
                    You're a rookie. That's what 
                    rookies do.                                                                                    57.


                                  TONYA
                    To keep me safe?

                                  YODA
                    Don't be ridiculous.

                                  TONYA
                    To keep me safe?

      Yoda pulls the van over on a deserted sidestreet.

                                  TONYA (CONT D)
                          (softly)
                    You can't do that, Larry.

      They fall into a clinch, madly kissing and ripping each 
      other's clothes off, wrestling their way into the back seats.

                                  TONYA (CONT D)
                    You can't do that...

                                  YODA
                    I'd die without you...

      Franchise, grim-faced, alone, ascending.

      Doors open on the eleventh floor.

      INT. LONG DINGY HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Franchise heading to apt 11G.

      A long beat, then the door opens. Mo Bailey stares at him.                                                                                    58.


      FRANCHISE'S POV - APT. INTERIOR. On the dining table; a dozen 
      Aspidistra plants. The poor but house-proud rooms are filled

    Mo winces.

      Crowded, sports on three TVs.

      Lazarus, writing in a notebook on the damp bar, has been 
      there for hours and he looks it. 

    He rises and heads through the loud room to the bathroom.

      INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Awful, super narrow, dingy.

      Lazarus enters. The stall is being used.

      Waiting, he stares at himself in the flecked mirror.

    The stall door opens up.

    And suddenly he's face to face with the Shannon Bar Stomper; 
    the guy is massive and undeniably himself from shaved head to 
      silver tipped boots.

      They stare at each other, reading each other's minds.

      Lazarus is off duty and high, without gun or radio. He is 
      scared.

    The Stomperknows Lazarus isn't going to do shit.

    The bathroom is so narrow that The Stomperbrushes Lazarus on 
    his way out the door.                                                                                    59.


      When they're chest to chest The Stomperlooks into Lazarus' 
      eyes and smiles.

    And then he's gone.

    ON LAZARUS - Punkedto the max.
