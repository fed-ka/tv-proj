  AERIAL VIEW looking out over the city, LIGHTS as far as the 
  eye can see, ELECTRICITY being consumed...



  AERIAL VIEW again.  Following the scalloped POWER LINES...


  One of the hundreds of SUBSTATIONS that dot Los Angeles.  
    Chain-link fence, surrounding a cramped pad of cables, 
    transformers, load switches and reducers.

  A lone maintenance engineer, RANDY SYLES, works amid the 
  humming equipment.  He s remarkably cool and focused, despite 
  the HIGH VOLTAGE sizzling all around...

  As he strains, pulling on a wrench to loosen a time-rusted 
  bolt, his CELL PHONE RINGS.  He grabs it, tucks it under his 
  chin, still working the wrench...

                              SYLES
                      (into cell phone)
                Hey...  It s gonna be late...  I 
                don t know how late; late.









                                                                          (CONTINUED)            NUMB3RS   #307/44   "Blackout"   BUFF Rev   10-02-06    3.

  As he continues to listen, the wrench suddenly slips, jumping 
  from his hands, contacting a cable.  A BLUE FLASH, a shower 
  of sparks.  Cursing himself, he retrieves the phone from the 
  ground.

                              SYLES
                It was nothing.  Dropped the phone, 
                that s all.  But I need to go.  
                Don t wait up.

  He tucks the phone away, goes back to work.  Suddenly, the 
  ROAR of a car engine.  Syles is lit in a WASH OF HEADLIGHTS.

  SYLES S P.O.V. - LOOKING OUT THROUGH THE FENCE --A5A5

  A CAR hurtles directly at the substation.  Syles scrambles to 
  get out of the way as --

  The car plows through the fence and into the equipment.  
  Thousands of volts are sent arcing.  A spectacular explosion, 
  white-hot sparks filling the air.  The 4th of July...

  The area goes dark, except for the glow of the crackling 
  flames...  A beat.  Then boom!  Another transformer explodes.

  OMITTED55


  FIREMEN drag equipment and extinguishers, clearing out of the 
  CRIME SCENE.  Little is left of the car, badly burned amid 
  the twisted metal of the substation.

  We find DON ARRIVING.  He crosses in front of the fire 
  truck s work lights, where he s greeted by DAVID.

                              DAVID
                Just got the all-clear from LAFD.  
                Power company s taken the station 
                off line.

  As they head into the wreckage, looking around --

                              DAVID
                If this is terrorism, it s pretty 
                low impact.  A few thousand 
                customers spend the night in the 
                dark?

                              DON
                Doesn t rule out a test run.  They 
                hit a single target tonight.  Next 
                attack could be wide scale...



                                                                          (CONTINUED)            NUMB3RS   #307/44   "Blackout"   BUFF Rev   10-02-06    5.

  They reach ground zero.  Blackened, except for a YELLOW TARP 
  left by firemen to mark the remains of Randy Syles.

                              DON
                One body...

                              DAVID
                  A worker, doing routine 
                  maintenance.

                              DON
                Where s the driver?

                              DAVID
                No sign of him.  Must ve got out 
                before the fire, ran off...

                              DON
                      (seeing something)
                Or maybe there was no driver...  
                Look at this.

  Don shines his flashlight inside.  The beam finds the gas 
  pedal, studded with small SHARDS OF WOOD.

                              DAVID
                What is that, wood splinters..?

  David leans in further, checks the driver s-side floor... and 
  removes a charred length of two-by-four...

                              DAVID
                Someone used a two-by-four to jam 
                the gas pedal.


    High-tension towers.  Scalloping POWER LINES.  The Valley 
  spread out forever below, a blanket of lights.  Several cars 
  sit parked off the pavement on a turnout -  LOVERS  LANE .  
  But one of the cars is a familiar FBI SEDAN...


  The Agents look out over the endless blanket of lights as 
  large squares SUDDENLY DROP INTO DARKNESS, one, another, then 
  another (visual fx), creating an uneven CHECKERBOARD of 
  lights and darks stretched out before them...

  Colby raises the binocs, checks the substation.  It s quiet.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS   #307/44   "Blackout"   BUFF Rev   10-02-06    19.

                Not here they didn t.

  The progression stops well-shy of darkening the whole city. 

                              DAVID
                It seems to be holding.  They 
                didn t crash everything.

                              COLBY
                Not this time anyway...

  As the Agents look out over Los Angeles, now a patchwork of 
  light and dark...

  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUMPER:


  The latest target, but no obvious signs of damage aside from 
  some charring.  David breaks off from an LAPD Uniform, joins 
  Colby who s coming out of the wreckage.

                              DAVID
                How d they do it?

                              COLBY
                Looks like they tossed a thick 
                piece of rebar across the 
                  transformer grid, caused a short.

                              DAVID
                And that would bring it all down?

                              LARRY (V.O.)
                  Absolutely...

  The Agents turn as Larry and Megan arrive behind them.

                              LARRY
                Rebar, metal, obviously highly 
                  conductive...  It provided a 
                pathway between the high and low 
                sides...  There was an instant load 
                surge, driving the transformers way 
                beyond their capacity, and boom.

                              MEGAN
                We were having dinner when the 
                lights in the restaurant went out.

  Colby throws David a look.  David looks to Megan.

                              DAVID
                Don s briefing the Mayor.  Sixty 
                thousand customers lost power this 
                time...

                              LARRY
                      (looking around)
                This isn t where Charlie and I 
                  predicted they d strike...

                              DAVID
                No.  We were staked out up on 
                  Mulholland.

                Question is who?  Our prime suspect 
                group doesn t make sense anymore...

                              MEGAN
                The striking workers...

                              COLBY
                This substation s owned by an 
                  independent company.  It s not tied 
                to Renault Energy or the labor 
                dispute in any way...

                              DAVID
                Which means terrorism moves back 
                into the number one slot.

  Beat.  Just then --

                              LAPD COP (O.S.)
                Hey, we ve got a body over here.


  ANGLE ON a macabre scene - a BODY (male, Latino, 30), outside 
  the fence, definitely dead, but eerily still propped up, 
  hands gripping a fence post.  Flashlight beams dance over him 
  as the Agents approach, David taking it in --

                              DAVID
                He s dead?

                              COLBY
                      (as the Cop s nod)
                Company had nobody on tonight.  
                He s not a worker.

                              MEGAN
                Then I d say we just found a new 
                suspect.

  Beat, taking in the scene.  As Colby checks the body.

                              DAVID
                Probably climbed the fence to throw 
                the rebar onto the grid, was still 
                holding on when it shorted out.

  Larry hangs back, scientifically intrigued, but wary...

                  Electricity, always looking for a 
                place to go...  It jumped to the 
                fence post as a ground, used 
                this... poor gentleman as well.

                              COLBY
                He s got no ID...  And no chance in 
                hell we re gonna be able to pull 
                prints; not with his hands fused to 
                the pole like that.

                              MEGAN
                Car keys, cell phone?

                              COLBY
                Nothing.

  David notes the Dead Perp s pockets, pulled inside out.  He 
  looks to the LAPD Cop.

                              DAVID
                Were his pockets turned out like 
                this when you found him?

                              COP
                Yeah.  I didn t touch anything.

                              LARRY
                      (cringes, repulsed)
                Someone went through his pockets?

                              COLBY
                Whoever he s working with cleaned 
                him out to keep us from ID ing him.

                              MEGAN
                Hold on.  On his neck...

  Megan moves close, shines her light on a TATTOO peeking out 
  of the Dead Perp s collar.  Tattoo reads -  4-B-27 .

                              MEGAN
                It s a prison tattoo.   4-B-27 .

                That s a cell block at Chino.  He s

                We fax his picture, maybe somebody

  David s FBI Sedan rolls to a stop.  David gets out.  Megan 
  and Colby too, Colby dragging the Punk from the back seat. 

                              COLBY
                Show us where.

  The Punk stops about twenty feet from a parked Lexus --

                              THE PUNK
                There.  In the car.

  David sits the Punk on the ground.  The Agents approach the 
  Lexus... and find the very dead body of Lyle Donahue.

                              MEGAN
                It s Donahue.

  Megan reaches in with a gloved hand, turns Donahue s head to 
  reveal a single bullet hole.  The Punk calls out to them.

                              THE PUNK
                I didn t do it.  He was that way 
                when I found him!

                              DAVID
                Single shot, behind the ear...
                      (nods re: the Punk)
                Little too professional for this 
                bozo, don t you think?

                              MEGAN
                Yeah.  Donahue was probably already 
                dead when he took the credit card.

  A beat.  Megan glances around the alley, back to David.

                              MEGAN
                You know this means we ve got more 
                players in the game than just our 
                  Salvadorian and Donahue...

  TWO SECOND GRAPHIC BUMPER:


  Don heads toward the FBI.  He spots Warner near the entrance 
  with two US Marshals...  As he nears, their conversation 
  breaks up.  Warner sees Don.  He shakes his head, teasing --

                              DON
                Downtown two days in a row.  Pretty 
                sure I only lost one pair of 
                  sunglasses.

                                WARNER
                Forget it, Eppes.  You already blew 
                your one chance with me.

                              DON
                What happened to that rain-check?

                                WARNER
                You remember our drug dealer friend 
                  operating out of the race track?

                              DON

                gonna be shacking up in a safe 
                house in San Diego while he spills 
                  everything to the US Attorney.

                How soon do you have to leave?

                It was an innocent question.

                                WARNER
                We re going to process him out 
                today, then I m gone...

  A beat passes.  There s still an attraction here.

                But I ll call you when I get back.

  Another beat.  Then she goes.  Off Don --


  Megan s outside, leaning on the rail, looking toward 
  downtown.  Larry approaches, finds her.

                              LARRY
                You look awfully contemplative; as 
                if pondering some great mystery of 
                the universe, perhaps?

                      (smiles, points to the 
                        skyline)
                Hardly.  I m pondering the Federal 
                  Detention Center.

                              LARRY
                Ah.  Charles told me you suspect a 
                possible prison break.

                              MEGAN
                Problem is, there are over two 
                thousand prisoners, and I can t 
                find a way to link Lyle Donahue to 
                any of them.  We don t know who he 
                was working for.

  A beat passes.  They both eye the skyline.  Then --

                              LARRY
                Megan, I m afraid I have to 
                question one of your basic 
                  assumptions...  How do you know 
                Donahue was working for someone 
                else?

                              MEGAN
                There has to be someone else.  How 
                else do you explain Donahue s 
                murder?

                              LARRY
                I m not questioning whether there s 
                someone else involved.  That s a 
                matter of near certainty.

                              MEGAN
                Okay, now you re just confusing me.

                              LARRY
                What I mean is... all along you ve 
                been doing a  bottom up  analysis.  
                You started with the unfortunate 
                gentleman who was electrocuted...

                              MEGAN
                  Alejandro Mu oz...

                              LARRY
                Yes.  Then worked your way up to 
                Donahue.  And now you re looking 
                for someone above Donahue...



                                                                          (CONTINUED)          NUMB3RS   #307/44   "Blackout"   BUFF Rev   10-02-06    45.

                              MEGAN
                That s standard procedure.  We re 
                looking for the bigger fish.

                              LARRY
                But how do you know you re fishing 
                in the right direction.
                      (then)
                In 1959, Richard Feynman gave a 
                famous lecture called  There s 
                Plenty of Room at the Bottom.   It 
                altered the thinking of a whole 
                  generation of scientists, turned 
                their focus around, challenging 
                them to think smaller and smaller, 
                instead of larger...
                      (then)
                You re working from Mu oz to 
                Donahue, to someone further up the 
                chain.  Perhaps you should be 
                working in the opposite direction.

                              MEGAN
                You re saying the plan to blow up 
                the substations could have 
                  originated on Mu oz s end...

                              LARRY
                It deserves consideration.

                              MEGAN
                      (realizing)
                It would explain why we can t find 
                  a connection between Donahue and 
                the Federal Detention Center - 
                there isn t one.  The connection is 
                Alejandro Mu oz. 

  Off Megan.


  A shiny TANKER TRUCK (K.V.P. FUEL SERVICES) idles at the 
  Security Gate.  The Gate Guard checks paperwork.  Two Other 
  Guards survey the truck s undercarriage with mirrors.  After 
  a beat and an  all clear,  the truck rolls through...

  CAMERA PANS AND FINDS --

  Liz Warner getting out of her car in the parking area.  As 
  she heads toward the PEDESTRIAN ENTRANCE --


  WE RETURN to the Tanker Truck as it rolls slowly down the 
  incline into the basement of the facility, finally coming to 
  a stop near the diesel generators...

  The DRIVER/GANG SOLDIER #4 opens the door, 30, Latino.  He s 
  greeted by Baker.  The Driver offers Baker a clipboard.  
  Baker takes it... revealing a SILENCED PISTOL.  Before Baker 
  can react, the Driver puts two silenced rounds into him... 
  then grabs the KEYS from Baker s lifeless body...

  ON TOP OF THE FUEL TRUCK --

  The hatch begins to spin, turned by UNSEEN HANDS.  After a 
  beat, the hatch opens...

  Three Salvadorian GANG SOLDIERS emerge, wearing bulletproof 
  vests, carrying automatic weapons...


  Warner presents her badge to the GUARD ON DUTY.

                              WARNER
                Liz Warner, FBI.  I m processing

                No weapons allowed inside the 
                prison, Agent Warner.  You re gonna 
                have to check yours here.

  Warner removes her gun and holster, hands them over.  As the 
  guard waves her into the prison.          NUMB3RS   #307/44   "Blackout"   BUFF Rev   10-02-06    51.




  REJOIN the Gang Soldiers.  The Driver removes coveralls, 
  suited up like the others - a team of four killers now.  One 
  of them approaches a large electrical box.  Armed with large 
  BOLT CUTTERS, he severs the feeder conduit.  Sparks fly...

  Then, using Baker s keys, the killers enter the prison...


  An FBI SUBURBAN comes through the gates.  Once inside, Don, 
  Megan, Colby and David pour out, casual tac gear.  Don s 
  trying to make a cell call.  Gives up.

                              DON
                Agent Warner s still not answering 
                her phone.

                              COLBY
                Probably no cell signal inside.

                              DAVID
                I m still not getting anything from 
                the prison switchboards...

  They look around, move toward the prison.  Megan spots the 
  Diesel Tanker down the slope in the loading bay.

  As Colby checks for a pulse.  Don joins them.

                              COLBY
                He s dead.

  David sees the hatch, propped open on top of the tanker.  
  With his asp, he RAPS on the tank.  Hollow, empty.

                Empty.  It s a Trojan Horse.  
                They re already inside the prison.

                SWAT s out on a call.  They ll be 
                twenty minutes, at least...

                              DON
                We ve got forty-five prison 
                officers in there on our side.

                Except their weapons are locked in 
                the armory.  Takes time to deploy

                We wait for SWAT, this ll all be 
                over.  We ve gotta make a move.

  A look around the group.  The others nod... 


  The action s over.  Mop up time.  FBI and Federal Corrections 
  vehicles fill the loading area.  Warner stands near the open 
  back doors of an AMBULANCE as Tabakian is loaded into one of 
  them.  Don comes up.

                              DON
                How s your witness?

                Bullet passed clean through.  
                  Paramedic doesn t think it hit any 
                vitals.  He ll live.

                You guys saved his ass, Eppes.  Not 
                to mention what you did for me back 
                there.

                              DON
                That s just the way it went down.

                              WARNER
                Yeah, but I owe you one.

                      (laughs)
                Yeah, it does...

  A beat between them.  Colby walks up, interrupting --

                              COLBY
                Don, I ve got the Warden waiting in 
                his office for you.

  Don looks to Warner.

  into the ambulance.  Off Don --
