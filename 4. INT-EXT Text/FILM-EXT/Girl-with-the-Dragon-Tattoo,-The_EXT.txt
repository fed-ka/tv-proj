A Christmas card vista is spoiled by a black line of
railroad tracks stitched onto the snowy landscape like a
scar pointing north to icy desolation. A phone rings -

Feeling a bit like he's fleeing the scene of a crime,
which in a way he is, Blomkvist steps outside opening his
umbrella. A couple of the reporters come out after him -
REPORTER 2
Will you appeal?
BLOMKVIST
I'll appeal to you, Viggo:
Find a
real story to cover.
He hurries off in the rain.
NEWSCASTER V/O
Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist
was found guilty today on 16 counts
of aggravated libel against financier
Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.

He comes out tamping the pack. Extracts a cigarette.
Tosses the pack in a sidewalk trash bin. Flicks at the
lighter but can't get it to fire in the wind and rain.
Hunches his body around it, coaxes it to life.
TV NEWSCASTER V/O
Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600
thousand SKE in damages and all court
costs, which could be significantly
more.
He takes a long drag that dizzies him. A wonderful
feeling. He regards the trash bin. Fishes around it,
finds the pack, puts it in his coat pocket.

A passenger train, barely visible in a severe snowstorm,
makes its way north. This is no Christmas card.
24A
25
Blomkivist disembarks to find Frode - who he can only
assume is Frode - beyond a veil of snow, waving to him
from outside a Mercedes. Unlike Blomkvist, he's dressed
for this God-awful weather in a fur-collared topcoat.
26
26
Frode's Mercedes comes across a long bridge linking the
old industrial town to a rocky island.
FRODE
First time in Hedestad?
BLOMKVIST
And last, I'm sure.
FRODE
It's lovely in the spring.
BLOMKVIST
You said it was lovely in winter.
FRODE
This is unseasonable.
BLOMKVIST
I'll be on the 4:30 train back to
Stockholm.
FRODE
Unless we get snowed in ... I'm
joking. You'll be home tonight, if
that's what you wish.
27
27
The car comes up a long, bare-tree-lined drive, leading
to a stately manor. As Frode and Blomkvist climb out, a
distant gunshot echoes, but neither Frode nor the old man
who appears at the front door of the manor pays it any
attention; just someone hunting.
VANGER
Welcome.
Come inside.
It's warm.

The children of the "thieves, misers, bullies and
incompetents" play on a beach. A shutter blinks freezing
a 12-year-old girl in foreground in black and white -
VANGER V/O
This is Harriet. The granddaughter
of my brother Richard.
32
34
The 4:30 train leaves the station without Blomkvist.
35
36
Three generations of Vangers dot the grounds.
VANGER V/O
My brothers - along with their
wives, children and grandchildren -
had gathered here for our loathsome
annual board meeting and dinner. It
was also the day the Yacht Club held
its Autumn parade.
37
37
And we see the parade, and, among the spectators lining
the town's main street, Harriet with other teenage girls.
21.
21.
VANGER V/O
Harriet and a couple of school
friends had gone into town to watch
it. She returned a little after two
o'clock.
38
39
A car and a fuel truck, both going too fast, collide on
the bridge. The truck rolls onto its side crushing the
car and spewing gasoline.
VANGER V/O
The accident had nothing to do with
Harriet - and everything.
40
41
People and vehicles converge on both sides of the bridge.
VANGER V/O
Police, an ambulance, fire brigade,
reporter, photographer and onlookers
quickly arrived from town, as those
of us on the island - the family -
hurried to the bridge from our side.
22.
22.
The truck driver has managed to climb out of his cab, but
the other motorist is trapped.
VANGER V/O
The driver of the car - a Mr.
Aronsson - was pinned and severely
injured. All we could do was try to
pry him out with our hands - since
metal tools could spark.
A local newspaper photographer and another man, snap
pictures as Vanger and others try without success to pry
the injured driver from his car. As the chaos ensues -
VANGER V/O
About twenty minutes after the crash,
Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna
herself saw her.
42
43
As the sun sets, Vanger and the others on the bridge make
progress extracting the driver from the car. A young man
coming from the town side takes off his jacket to help.
VANGER V/O
We finally got poor Aronsson out of
his car and off to the hospital, and
those of us on our side drifted back
to the house.
44
45A
The crews continue their work under lights.
VANGER
Firemen stayed on the bridge all
night pumping out the gasoline. And
no one swam across, or took a row
boat. All of them were still tied up
on this side Sunday. Believe me, we
checked.
45B
46
It's raining as an elegantly-dressed woman slows before
a luxurious apartment building. Salander approaches from
the other direction. Passing, she notes the four number
tones the woman keys in the code lock.
The door buzzes open and the woman disappears inside.
Salander doubles back and keys the same four number tones
in the Milton Security lock.
47
48
The rain here is icier and more punishing.
VANGER V/O
When the police investigation petered
out, I kept at it -

He zips the suitcase with the supplies in it closed and
gathers the rest.
ERIKA
We're in our worst crisis ever and
you're writing a memoir?
BLOMKVIST
You fired me; I need something to do.
ERIKA
You fired you; I need you here, not
the North Pole. You know what this
is going to look like.
BLOMKVIST
Like I've been gutted. Like I'm
running away. I am.
They cross through the building, he with his cases, she
with her coffee cup.
28.
28.
BLOMKVIST
Wennerstrom wants to see me waving
a white flag, not a red one. And the
more it looks like there's a problem
between you and me, the more it'll
satisfy him.
ERIKA
There is a problem between us. He
won't be satisfied until he shuts us
down, and you're leaving me to fight
him alone.
He kisses her but gets back no more than he would from a
statue - and steps outside.
BLOMKVIST
It's four hours by train.
It's not
the North Pole.
52
52
The depot thermometer reads 0. Blomkvist disembarks with
two suitcases. This time, Frode isn't there to meet him.
He struggles with his luggage through the snow to a taxi
stand.
53
54
The taxi deposits Blomkvist outside a cottage. From here
he can see Vanger's manor and couple other houses. The
taxi drives off and disappears into the snow.
55
56
He comes out into falling snow holding his cell phone
out in front of him like a dowser divining ground water.
Moves around trying to get a signal. Can't.
57
58
He walks along the street through wind-whipping snow,
cradling the grocery bag, cell out in front of him again.
Any of the locals could tell him he could do this forever
- there are no cell towers anywhere around here.
59
59
Grocery bag at his feet, he dials a call with fingers he
can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the
end of the bridge. It goes to Erika's voice mail.
BLOMKVIST
It's me. I'm here. It's fucking
cold and I'm on a pay phone. If you
tried to call, the reception sucks,
and if you tried to email, there's
none of that either, so - so - I'm
here - and - I can't even speak it's
so fucking cold.
He hangs up, open the same pack of cigarettes from
before. Eighteen in there. Struggles to get one lit in
the wind and snow, hurries off toward the bridge.
60
61
Salander appears and keys in the four lock tones.
62
63
The bell in the church tower clangs -
64
66
Vanger has ventured outside to show Blomkvist around
the estate. Smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold
grey skies, weather for which Blomkvist, unlike the old
man, is inadequately dressed.
VANGER
The island is owned by my family.
Your closest neighbor is my brother
Harald, another Nazi if you can
believe. Two in the family. He's
detestable to put it nicely, but
you'll probably never see him. He's
a recluse.
BLOMKVIST
He was there that day?
VANGER
Indeed he was.
Vanger's look to Blomkvist adds, `so consider him a
suspect.' He indicates another house on the grounds -
VANGER
That's his daughter Cecilia's house.
They don't speak.
BLOMKVIST
Does anyone speak to anyone on this
island?
VANGER
Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother
- who lives there -
(points)
- she speaks to Harald - which is one
of reasons I don't speak to her.
(points)
Cecilia's brother Birger lives there.
BLOMKVIST
Who doesn't he speak to?
VANGER
You, probably. Not that you'd want
him to. He can be as unpleasant as
Harald.
32.
32.
BLOMKVIST
I'm quickly losing track who's who.
VANGER
Oh, how you'll wish were it always
so. Soon you'll know us all only too
well - with my apologies.
(points)
Out there is my nephew Martin's
house; Harriet's brother.
It's a modern house - lots of glass - out on the point.
BLOMKVIST
Who speaks to him?
VANGER
I speak to him. He runs the company
now, as I think I told you.
They hear a distant rifle crack and echo.
It startles
Blomkvist a bit, but not Vanger.
VANGER
Someone shooting their dinner.
Gunner probably. The caretaker.
BLOMKVIST
I just met him.
VANGER
He was 19 when Harriet disappeared.
Old enough, Blomkvist gathers, to be considered a
suspect. Vanger points off -
VANGER
He lives over there.
Shivering in the cold, Blomkvist turns.
BLOMKVIST
And you live here.
VANGER
Sorry?
BLOMKVIST
Your house.
For a moment, Vanger isn't sure what Blomkvist means.
Then he is, and is pleased by it.
33.
33.
VANGER
Yes, you're right. The man who
hires the detective should always be
kept on the suspects list.

Gustaf Morell stands at the bow of a patrol boat slowly
motoring past the bridge where the fire brigade works to
pump the gasoline from the overturned truck.
INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Morell on site, Hedeby
Island, 11:42 p.m."

The police patrol boat and two Peterssons motor around
the island, spotlighting the shore and rocky cliffs.
71B

Search parties crisscross the island, wade through
ditches, check old barns, shine flashlights up chimneys.
Woodsmen with blood hounds comb through woods.
MORELL V/O
We searched for days ...
75
75
A train bisects the landscape.
Blomkvist looks out.
MORELL V/O
Eventually, much to his dismay - and
mine - I had to talk to Henrik about
calling it off -
76
76
As the search continues, Morell, looking like he hasn't
slept - which he hasn't - peers down a rocky cliff to the
water. Somehow he knows they're never going to find her.
MORELL V/O
The fact that I never found a body
didn't surprise me. You can't dig
up an entire island.
A77

78
An unexciting social welfare building.
79
80
Martin's house didn't look so far away, but the road
Blomkvist has to climb to reach it, and the fact he, like
all writers, is out of shape, taxes him. A car driven by
an attractive woman in her 30's pulls alongside him.
LIV
Mikael?
(he manages a nod)
We're going to the same place.
Hop in.
81
81
Martin, wearing an apron, opens the door to find both his
dinner guests on the porch.
41.
41.
LIV
I found him at death's door halfway
up the hill.
BLOMKVIST
I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.
MARTIN
No, it's a climb for anyone. I
should've warned you. Come on in.
Blomkvist puts a bottle of aquavit in Martin's hand.
82
84
Blomkvist sifts through a box containing some of
Harriet's personal belongings: school papers, textbooks,
a Bible, the address book, her wallet and ID ...
A knock on the door. He puts the box in a closet on top
of others, kicks it closed, opens the front door to find
a not unattractive woman in her 50's on his porch.
CECILIA
Hi. I thought I'd come over and say
hello. I'm Cecilia.
85
87
Salander against the store window, cell phone to her ear.
SECRETARY V/O
I'm sorry, he's booked all day.
SALANDER
It'll take five minutes.
It's
important.
SECRETARY V/O
Hold, please.
Salander waits. Watches people stare at her like they
always do. The secretary comes back on.
SECRETARY V/O
Seven o'clock.
88
93
He sprays Binaca in his mouth. Then, careful to look
both ways, crosses the street to an investment bank.
50.
50.
94

They sit together at a little table on the sidewalk.
ANITA
How is Henrik?
BLOMKVIST
Good.
Engaging. I like him.
She does, too.
51.

Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ
ANITA
I haven't seen him in over 30 years.
Or my sister. Or anyone else in my
family.
BLOMKVIST
Most of what I'm writing about
predates that, so your recollections
are valid.
ANITA
I wouldn't know where to start, if
that was a question.
BLOMKVIST
I can narrow it. I've gotten up to
the 1960s. To the event that altered
everything in Henrik's life.
ANITA
Harriet.
(he nods)
Everything I knew about that I told
to - whatever his name was - that
policeman - when it happened.
BLOMKVIST
Morell.
ANITA
My recollections then were a lot
better than they are now.
BLOMKVIST
I'm not speaking of the crime itself.
I'm trying to get a clearer sense of
what Harriet was like. Particularly,
toward the end.
ANITA
She was messed up. Like all us
Vanger kids. Crazy mother. Drunken
father. At least hers wasn't a Nazi
like mine.
BLOMKVIST
Was he abusive?
ANITA
Mine?
BLOMKVIST
Hers.
52.
52.
ANITA
I never saw it myself, but you could
tell something was going on. One day
she'd be withdrawn. The next she'd
be putting on makeup and wearing the
tightest sweater she had to school.
The next she'd be studying a Bible
like a nun - no Vanger was ever
religious - can you imagine?
Obviously, she was very unhappy.
BLOMKVIST
She never confided in you what about,
specifically?
ANITA
There was no specifically. It was
everything. It was being part of
that family. Henrik's the only
decent person in it.
BLOMKVIST
What do you think happened to her?
ANITA
Everyone knows what.
BLOMKVIST
But you have no ... thoughts about
why, or who.
ANITA
All I know is I always felt sorry
for her. Even more than for myself.
I got out of there when I was 18 and
never went back. She would have done
the same but didn't make it to 18.
96
96
Salander, on a park bench, debates with herself if she
wants to make the call on the cell in her hand. She
scrolls to "NB" and hits send. It connects.
SALANDER
Mr. Bjurman, please. It's Lisbeth
Salander.
(the call is put through)
... I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed
our appointment. I had a lot of work
... no, nothing to be concerned about
... I need another advance on my
allowance. Can I come to your office
tonight? ... I don't need a pen,
what's the address?
53.
53.
97
97
The taxi that first brought him here to the island,
crosses the bridge. Again, Blomkvist regards the Middle
Eastern driver, who regards him in the rearview mirror.
98
98
Outside the building's entrance with a backpack slung
over her shoulder, Salander presses an apartment button.
As she waits, she notes there's no security camera.
BJURMAN O/S
Yes?
SALANDER
It's me.
The door buzzes.
She pushes it open.
99
102
A lone figure hobbles through the empty streets.
103
105
Coming through trees with a bag of groceries, Blomkvist
sees a BMW parked outside his cottage.
106
106
Blomkvist taps on the car's fogged-up driver's window.
A hand inside wipes at it, revealing Erika. She lowers
it a crack.
ERIKA
Is it any warmer inside?
BLOMKVIST
No.
107
112
He's at his desk, the cat in his lap, reviewing the
album of photos taken on the day Harriet disappeared.
62.
62.
They're arranged chronologically, and Vanger has noted
the approximate time of day of each.
The first several were taken on the manor grounds, by
family members of each other. The next couple taken in
town of the parade. Then dozens taken on and around the
bridge of the dramatic accident. He hears the sound and
glances out to see a television news van driving toward
Vanger's manor -
113
113
A crew is set up in the yard by the water, interviewing
Henrik and Martin. Under his suit jacket Henrik wears a
cheerful yellow shirt. Birger unhappily looks on.
MARTIN
Millennium is an excellent magazine.
We also think it's undervalued right
now, which is good business for us.
REPORTER 3
Is any magazine really undervalued
today. How many will be around
tomorrow?
VANGER
There's another reason.
I don't like
bullies.
REPORTER 3
Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom?
VANGER
I'm referring to anyone who tries
to sue their enemies into submission.
If Mr. Wennerstrom would like to try
it again, he'll find himself fighting
a company that can afford to fight
back.
REPORTER 3
You're enjoying this.
VANGER
Already it's the most fun I've had in
years.
