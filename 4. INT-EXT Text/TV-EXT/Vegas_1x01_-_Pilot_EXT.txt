      The sun is a ball of fire in the Western sky. At the crest of 
      a hill, a lone man sits on his horse.

      RALPH LAMB. 32. Deep set eyes. A handsome loner. Quiet and 
      still. 4th generation Nevada rancher. This land is his home. 
      A place where he's at peace. But right now, he's on edge. He 
      gazes down the canyon, where we hear HOOTS and HOLLERS --

      THREE HUNDRED HEAD OF ANGUS driving across the mesa. Expertly 
      shepherded by Lamb's brothers. DIXON and FRANK. The Lambs and 
      their dogs guide the surging herd of beef toward a corral on 
      the horizon. It's sweaty, dusty work, each bull weighs at 
      least a ton and they are not all cooperative.

      Frank (28, middle-child diplomat, even-keeled) SPURS his 
      horse, EDGING a long horn back in line. But TWO OTHER BULLS 
      BOLT into the open.

                                    FRANK
                    Dix!

      Dixon (24, reckless) races his mare after the breakaway 
      bulls. The snorting bulls feel him closing in and suddenly 
      CUT right-- Dixon YANKS the reins hard to avoid colliding 
      with some other beef. His horse SKIDS to a stop. Dixon goes 
        AIRBORNE...

      ... and CRASHES hard on the dirt. As he gets up, one of their  
      dogs runs up to him. Dixon limps a bit as he stands and 
      watches the two stray bulls head into a canyon. Then his eyes 
      find --

      LAMB. On his horse. Barrelling down into the canyon at full 
      speed. The dog looks to Dixon.

                                    DIXON
                      I ain't stopping you.

      The dog turns and digs in, racing toward --

      THE CANYON, helping to box in the runaway bulls.

      ON LAMB: At a full gallop over rough terrain.

      ON THE BULLS: Nostrils flared, veins pulsing. Wild eyes. 

      Lamb closes in. His mare rising to the challenge. Lamb GRIPS 
      his rope. SWINGS it...                                                                                      2.


      ... and LASSOS the lead Bull, a longhorn. It THRASHES wildly, 
      but Lamb holds on, rodeo-style, leaping from the horse, 
      gloved hands CLUTCHING THE GREAT HORNS AND BRINGING THE BEAST 
      INTO SUBMISSION. The dog comes back with the second Bull and 
      we --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The Lambs are moving the herd the last quarter mile into 
      their corral. An ease settles in. We see a small Ranch house 
      and barn just beyond. From horseback, Frank surveys the herd.

                                    FRANK
                      When'rethe trucks coming?

                                    DIXON
                    Five thirty tomorrow. Six carriers 
                    out of Reno.

      Lamb pulls up on his mare, watching the Angus. He senses 
        something's wrong -- he notices the lead bulls' ears PRICK. 
      The other bulls get JITTERY. Dixon notices it too --

                                    FRANK
                    'The hell's going on?

      A LOW RUMBLE emanates from behind the mountains. Like a storm 
        approaching. It gets LOUDER. LAMB LOOKS to the sky, the SOUND 
      coming closer... Dixon looks to Lamb.

                                    DIXON
                    No, Dammit!

      The whole landscape SHAKES. A terrifying ROAR.

      THE HERD OF BULLS SPOOK AND BOLT loose, tearing off in all 
      directions back into the flatland as --

        A DC-6AIRLINER ROCKETS overhead, low, screaming, wheels 
      down, coming in for landing somewhere beyond the ridge.

      HOLD ON LAMB. He watches the herd scatter and DASH to 
      freedom. All the hard work gone. His expression DARKENS. He 
      SWINGS his horse around.

                                    FRANK
                    Ralph --

      And GALLOPS off in the direction of the landing jet plane.                                                                                      3.


                                    DIXON
                    Let him go. We're losing time. We 
                    gotta try to get them in before 
                      nightfall.


      A dusty desert airstrip. The welcoming BAND OOM-PAHSa tune. 
      Passengers -- men in suits and hats and women in heels, 
      jewels and furs -- stream out of the DC-6from Chicago.

      An immaculately dressed man steps out. JOHNNY SAVINO (35). 
      Unlike the rest of the awe-struck tourists, Savino moves like 
      he owns the place. A dangerous mix of confidence and menace. 
      Savino looks past the airport, to --

      The Las Vegas skyline, circa 1960.

      A city bursts out of the desert. A rapid expansion -- hotels 
      and casinos push out at all sides, the city transforming into 
      the gleaming, twinkling jewel we know today.

      RESUME SAVINO

      A man eyeing his destiny. A beat, then descends the stairs, 
      passing...

      A BAGGAGE HANDLER

      Unloading luggage. The Handler stares at the horizon --

      HIS POV

      A CLOUD OF DUST rises from the desert. Barely visible, a 
      single horseman galloping at full speed.


      An AIRPORT SECURITY Mechanic shifts his weight on the tarmac. 
      Hating his job right now. Sweat DRIPS down his face. And not 
      because it's hot --

      LAMB

      On horseback, approaches on the tarmac, sitting tall in his 
      saddle. His expression tight. The Mechanic steps out to stop 
      him.

                                    SECURITY MECHANIC
                      Ralph, I need to ask you --

      Lamb rides past him.  The hooves CLOMPon the runway...

      -- Past the silver DC-6...                                                                                      4.


      -- Past the PILOTS and STEWARDESSES, awed by the twelve feet 
      of man and horse passing them...

      -- Past the gaping TOURISTS who stare in amazement -- this is 
      the first time some of them have ever seen a cowboy.

      Lamb continues over to the baggage area, where...

      ... DON BLANCHFORD, the Terminal Manager (45, well-fed 
        bureaucrat) stands filling out time cards. Next to him, three 
      MECHANICS.

      Lamb dismounts and walks over to Blanchford.

                                    LAMB
                    You gave me your word.

                                    BLANCHFORD
                      I told you I'd do my best.

      Lamb gestures to the DC-6outside.

                                    LAMB
                    That plane just scattered my herd 
                      across eighteen hundred acres of 
                      Federal grazing.

                                    BLANCHFORD
                    And what am I supposed to do about 
                    that, Ralph?

                                    LAMB
                    You can pay me for the six tractor 
                      trailers I am gonnahave to turn 
                      around empty tomorrow.

                                    BLANCHFORD
                          (to his mechanics)
                      I don't know boys, instead of 
                      talking to us, sounds to me like he 
                      should be rounding up his heifers.

                                    LAMB
                      I can't round up two hundred ton of 
                    Angus with thirty minutes of 
                      daylight.

                                    BLANCHFORD
                    Well, I can't land three hundred 
                    ton of northbound DC-6 with gusts 
                    of thirty knots.

        Blanchard's mechanics laugh.                                                                                      5.


                                    LAMB
                    Sure you can.  You can bring them 
                    in from the East.  Right over the 
                      strip.

      Blanchard looks at Lamb. Smiles. 

                                    LAMB (CONT D)
                      I guess Frank was right.  The 
                      casinos got you on the dole, now.

                                    BLANCHFORD
                    Where this town is headed Ralph, 
                    you take the money or you get the 
                      shaft.  I ain't stupid.  I made my 
                      choice.  You should wise up and 
                    make yours before they make it for 
                    you.
                            (gathers his papers)
                    Eight million people gonna land 
                    here this year.  Wallets full of 
                    cash.  That's double last year's 
                      traffic.  And they all want steaks.  
                    You don t like it, move your ranch.

      Blanchford starts to walk away. Lamb doesn't move.

                                    LAMB
                      That s not going to happen.

                                    BLANCHFORD
                    Then get your nag out of here 
                      before I have you arrested for 
                      trespassing.

      Blanchford nods to a Mechanic who steps over, grabs Lamb.

                                    MECHANIC #1
                    You heard the man. Move.

      Lamb looks down at the man's hand on his arm. Slow to boil. 
      He looks back up. Stares at him. A scary look.

      The Mechanic hesitates.  Just as Lamb senses movement in the 
      corner of his eye.  He TURNS --

      Mechanic #2 s wrench FLYING at his face.  

      Lamb DUCKS.  He s never one to throw the first punch.  But 
      now that it s started...

      Lamb SLAMS his fist into Mechanic #1 s CHIN.  Lamb ELBOWS 
      Mechanic #2, folding him in half.  Mechanic #3 rushes and 
        BLINDSIDESLamb with a punch to the jaw.                                                                                        6.


      Lamb stands still -- the impact not fazing him.  Mechanic #3 
      is amazed.  The other Mechanics are still struggling to their 
      feet.  Lamb pauses and hits Mechanic #3 who falls in a heap.

      And FURTHER BACK:

      JOHNNY SAVINO  

      Watching, amused.  An appraiser of violence and men.   Two 
      CASINO EMPLOYEES stand waiting by a black car parked out on 
      the tarmac -- RICKY  BEANSY  COTA and VITO BORELLI.  Casino 
      muscle.  After a beat, Savino turns to the car.  Borelli 
      opens the door.  

                                    SAVINO
                    You see that?

                                    BORELLI
                    Yeah.  The cowboy can dish it out.

                                    SAVINO
                    Not that.  The guy didn t blink 
                    when he got hit. 

      Savino gets in, the doors close and the car pulls away, past 
      POLICE CARS streaming in...


      The setting sun glints off the domed rotunda of the just-
      opened Convention Center.  


      A few blocks off the Strip.  Where the service industry for 
      Vegas works.  Two cars are parked in the otherwise vacant 
      lot.                                                                                       8.


      Savino walks up to the warehouse, talking with ANTHONY  BIG 
      TUNA  CERVELLI, 52, who runs Vegas for Chicago.  A middle 
      manager gangster. 

                                    TUNA
                    You can keep the summer, but 
                      Christmas, that s heaven.  
                      Everybody back in Chicago s eating 
                    ice cubes and I m grilling sausage 
                    in the backyard. 
                          (for effect)
                    In my bathing suit.
                          (then)
                    How s your mother?

                                    SAVINO
                    She s good, thanks.  

                                    TUNA
                    Good. Good. Remember you only got 
                    one mother.

      Tuna leads Savino to the warehouse.  All business.

                                    TUNA (CONT D)
                    Mr. Al tell you about the Shangri 
                    La?

                                    SAVINO
                    He said you want me to start there.

                                    TUNA
                    Yeah.  Keep an eye on the place.  
                    Make sure we re getting a straight 
                      count.  Walk around. Say hello to 
                      people.  You know what to do.  Just 
                    keep those suitcases going home 
                    fat.

      Tuna stops at the door.  Holds Savino s gaze a beat. 

                                    TUNA (CONT D)
                    We brought you here because of what 
                    you did in Cuba.  Nobody knows 
                      casinos like you.  We re sitting on 
                    gold here -- you play this smart, 
                      there s no limit what you can do. 

      Tuna pushes open the door and they enter...                                                                                      9.



      A vast flatland dotted with military signs warning--

      DANGER. RESTRICTED AREA. BOMBING RANGE. NO TRESPASSING.

      A few police cars parked on the edge of the access road 
      beside some Military Police. A couple of Vegas deputies stand 
      around looking lost as Katherine leads D.A. Reynolds and 
      Mayor Bennett to a ravine.  

                                    KATHERINE
                      Name s Anna Meade.  She had been 
                      working last six months in 
                      accounting at the Shangri La. She 
                    left last night, never made it 
                    home. Car s still in the lot. Two 
                    hours ago, an Air Force driver 
                      spotted her body from the road. 
                      They re planning a blast next week, 
                    doing sweeps. 

      They arrive at the edge of the ravine.  

      At the bottom, a DEAD WOMAN, 25, lies sprawled. Face bruised.  
      Blood caked in her hair, skin raw from being dragged.  Her 
      arms and limbs at odd angles, tossed in the middle of the 
      desert like a rag doll.

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                      Where s her family?

                                    KATHERINE
                      Mother s flying in from Reno.

      The Mayor processes. Shit. Shit.  He faces Reynolds.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                      Katherine, take a squad car and get 
                    to the airport.  
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    11.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT(CONT'D)
                    Meet her the second she gets off 
                    the flight, hold her hand, don t 
                    let her out of earshot. Go. Now.

      Katherine looks to Reynolds, who nods. She exits.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                          (to Reynolds)
                    I m done waiting for Clyde to come 
                    up for air. You find a phone and 
                    call the Governor. You grovel, 
                      express our condolences and outrage 
                    and sorrow for his niece. You tell 
                    him we re on top of the 
                        investigation. You tell him we 
                    won t rest till we find Anna s 
                      killer. 

      Reynolds walks off. The Mayor stares down at the body. He 
      takes a moment, trying to figure out what to do... He looks 
      over, sees a lone Deputy standing a few feet away. Young, 
      green.

                                    MAYOR
                    You.  What s your name, Deputy?

                                    DEPUTY
                      Armstrong, sir.

      The Mayor pulls out a business card and starts to write on 
      the back of it.

                                    MAYOR
                    Okay, Armstrong. Call your dispatch 
                    and send a car to this man s ranch. 
                      I want him brought here. Name s 
                    Lamb. Ralph Lamb. Got it?

      He hands him the card.  The Deputy runs off.


      A POLICE CRUISER speeds down the Strip...

      From one end to the other, two miles of explosive energy.  
      NEON SIGNS sparkle with the latest entertainers: ELVIS, 
      SINATRA, DEAN MARTIN.HOTELSand CASINOSline the street: 
      The Sahara, the Sands, the Riviera.  A mass of humanity 
      spills out onto the sidewalks. 


      The cruiser approaches the crime scene. The Mayor stands on 
      the road.  Waiting for Lamb.  The Deputy  gets out, walks 
      over and OPENSthe door.  Lamb -- still cuffed -- STEPS out.  
      The Mayor moves over fast.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    Get him out of those!

      The Deputy uncuffs Lamb and the Mayor pulls him away.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                    For Chrissakes, Ralph.  Next time 
                    you have a problem with the planes, 
                    come to me.  

                                    LAMB
                    It didn t concern you.

                                    MAYOR
                    This does.

      He walks Lamb over to the edge of the ravine.  Lamb looks 
      down, sees Anna Meade s body.  

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                      Governor s niece.  Sheriff s MIA.  
                    The rest of them...
                          (looks out at deputies)
                      ...are useless. 

      Takes Lamb to the side.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT'D)
                      That s why I brought you here.  The 
                      Governor will be in my office first 
                    thing in the morning.
                          (beat)
                      I need to find this killer. 

                                    LAMB
                    I m a rancher.  Not a cop.                                                                                      13.


                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    You were one in Korea.  An M.P.  
                    And a damn good one.

      Lamb considers.  The Mayor sees his hesitation.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                      I don t expect you to work for 
                    free.  Name your price.

                                    LAMB
                      I don t want your money.  
                          (a beat, then)
                    You get those planes to stop flying 
                    over my cattle, that s a different 
                      story.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    Maybe I can talk to Blanchford.  

                                    LAMB
                    Take away the maybe.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    Done.

      Lamb turns, stares down at the body.  Processes.  There s 
      something about seeing a dead girl s body that stirs up a 
      deep memory.  Lamb keeps his eyes on the corpse, alone down 
      in the ravine.

                                    LAMB
                      What s her name?

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    Anna Meade.

      Lamb starts to walk away.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT (CONT D)
                          (a flash of worry)
                    Where are you going?

                                    LAMB
                    To get that body out of here before 
                    the coyotes come.

      The Mayor reacts, relieved.  Sees Lamb walk down into the 
      ravine. GO HIGH over the crime scene... and ENDTEASER.                                                                                    14.


                                            ACT ONE


        Businessmen and politicians crowd the steps.


      A working ranch: barns, a corral, and 5,000 acres of land. 
      Hands lead cattle in the coral, horses graze in the pasture.  
        A cottonwood tree gives shade to a simple ranch house. 


      Lamb takes the shotguns to his truck, a  54 Ford.  Frank 
      dodges a few stray chickens.

                                    FRANK
                    Who are we taking with us?

                                    LAMB
                    You, me, Dixon...

                                    FRANK
                      Dixon?

                                    LAMB
                    He can charm a bird off a tree.   
                    And the last time you left him 
                    alone we found the herd wandering 
                    on the I-41.  

                                    FRANK
                          (good point)
                      Dixon s in.

                                    LAMB
                      Where s Lon Simmons these days?

                                    FRANK
                    Fresh out of the pen.  Did eleven 
                      months for running bootleg smokes 
                    out of Utah.  

      Lamb puts the shotguns on the truck s rack.

                                    LAMB
                    We could use a good tracker.

      He closes the truck door.  As the engine TURNS over....                                                                                    18.



      They walk to the cans.  

                                    ACKERS
                      Instruction fee s twenty five bucks 
                    each week.  

                                  LON
                      Instruction fee?

                                    ACKERS
                    You don t like it I ll have you 
                      violated and sent back upstate.  
                    All clear, Red? 

      Ackers glares at Lon.  Daring him to lift a finger.  Lon 
      could throw him through a cinder block wall if he wanted to.  
      But he s a man without choices. 

                                    ACKERS (CONT D)
                    I ll be in the truck when you re 
                    done.

      Ackers climbs back in the cab.  We can hear him TURN UPthe 
      horse race on the radio.  

      Lon gazes down the block -- the alley is lined with 
        overflowing cans.  A shitjob.  He starts in, lifts a can and 
      dumps the stinking mess into the truck.  He puts his big 
      hands around another can --

                                    LAMB
                    Lon.

      Lon turns.  Sees the Lambs, leaning on their truck at the 
      mouth of the alley.  ON Lon, a grin growing...

                                                                      HARD CUT TO:                                                                                    19.



      Lamb speeds the truck down the golf course, past a few 
      confused GOLFERS.  He drives up to the back of the house as --

      DIXON scrambles out a back window, pulls on his boots as he 
      runs past a pool, hurdles a fence and JUMPS in the back of 
      the truck, hitting it in stride.  Lamb speeds ahead --

      The Business Man CHASES after Dixon, his bath-robed wife 
      running out behind.  He levies a SHOTGUN at the truck and 
      FIRES, the kick nearly dropping him in the pool.  

      As Lamb s truck ROCKETSdown the fairway, CUT TO:


      A quiet neighborhood of mid-century homes.


      Sun bakes the craggy landscape.  Lamb walks from the road 
      down to the bottom of the ravine, where Anna s body was 
      found.  Frank and Lon trail behind.  

      Rough, red-stained dirt stretches for miles.  Not a living 
      thing in sight.

                                    FRANK
                    Looks just like it did when we were 
                    kids.

                                  LON
                    No dead bodies then.

                                    LAMB
                    That we knew about.

      Lamb scrutinizesthe topography like a rancher.  Listening 
      all the time.  An internal processing.  

                                    LAMB (CONT D)
                      Whoever did it had to come at 
                      night.  Too exposed by day.  

                                  LON
                    He parked off the road.  Brush is 
                      broken along the path -- looks like 
                    he dragged the body from the car.   

      Something doesn t feel right to Lamb.  

                                    LAMB
                    Why here?  He could put the body 
                      anywhere for twenty miles.                                                                                    23.


                                    FRANK
                      Probably figured they were going to 
                    blow this place to pieces in a few 
                    weeks and nobody would find her. 

      Lamb s eyes set on a patch of thorny desert brush.  He WALKS 
      over, leans down.  The desert sand seems to have been 
      disturbed. Some brush has been broken off.    

      Lamb pulls back the brush, revealing a PILEof fresh sand.   
      Underneath it, the edges of a PLYWOOD BOARD.  

                                    LAMB
                    Give me a hand.

      He and Lon HAUL up the plywood, to reveal a makeshift grave.  
      The men looks down.  

                                  LON
                      That s where he wanted to put her.

                                    LAMB
                    So why didn t he?

      Lamb GAZES out into the open desert.  He WANDERSoff...

      Up on the road, Dixon DRIVESup in a POLICE CRUISER.  Lights 
      flashing.  Dixon scrambles with the controls, about every 
      BELL and WHISTLE goes off.  A beat then the siren goes 
      SILENT.  Dixon gets out.  Waves to them.

                                    FRANK
                      A natural.

      ANGLE ON LAMB

      Out in the desert flats.  He STOPS.  KNEELSdown.  TRACES his 
      hand along the red-sand soil, BRUSHINGaway the windblown 
      silt... 

      ... to reveal a single TIRE TRACK.  The tread IMPRINTEDin 
      the dirt.  He brushes off more silt... finds MORE TRACKS.

      Frank and Lon walk over.  Sees what Lamb has found.

                                    FRANK (CONT D)
                      Motorcycles.

                                    LAMB
                    Three different treads. 
                          (to Lon)
                    How long do you think they ve been 
                    out here?                                                                                     24.


                                  LON
                            (inspects the tracks)
                      Couple days at least.  

                                    FRANK
                    Hard to carry a dead body out on a 
                    bike. 

                                    LAMB
                    And the body was dragged down from 
                    the road.  But these tracks come 
                    from out in the desert.

      Lamb considers as Dixon huffs over. 

                                    DIXON
                      I tracked down Anna s boyfriend.  
                    He s been working out at the rodeo 
                      grounds last couple months.  He and 
                    Anna lived in an Airstream out 
                      there.    

                                    FRANK
                      Where s he now?

                                    DIXON
                    At work.  He heard about Anna.  
                    Boss said he s a mess.

      Off Lamb, PRELAP:

                                    CALE (O.S.)
                      A city full of derelicts and you re 
                      pointing at me?...


      In the ring, a rodeo rider is violently BUCKEDby a gelding. 


      Lamb and Frank exit.  Katherine O Connell approaches.   Lamb 
      nods to her.

                                    LAMB
                      Morning, Katherine. 

                                    KATHERINE
                      Ralph.  Frank.

                                    FRANK
                      I haven t seen you since you left 
                    for law school.  I thought we lost 
                    you for good.

                                    KATHERINE
                    You got me back.  New York firms 
                      aren t much for hiring women. 
                          (to Lamb)
                    Heard about your skirmish at the 
                      airport.  Reminds me of the old 
                    days.  Didn t you and my father 
                      square off once over some water 
                      rights?

      Franks cuts in --                                                                                    27.


                                    FRANK
                    You mean the water your daddy 
                      stole?

                                    KATHERINE
                      Funny, he remembers it differently.
                          (to Lamb)
                    As far as those planes go, I don t 
                    think that s a fight you re going 
                    to win.

                                    LAMB
                    Who says it s about winning?

                                    KATHERINE
                    If it s about what s right, that 
                    bus left this town a while ago.
                          (then, to Lamb)
                      I assume you talked to Anna Meade s 
                      boyfriend?

                                    LAMB
                    We did.  He s short an alibi.

                                    FRANK
                    And he was blind drunk Friday 
                      night.

                                    KATHERINE
                      A drunk boyfriend without an alibi.  
                      Nevada juries convict on less.

                                    LAMB
                    All that s missing is proof. 

      Lamb keeps walking to his truck. 

                                    KATHERINE
                    The D.A. will want to press 
                      charges.  What do you want me to 
                    tell him?

                                    LAMB
                    To wait until I find some proof.

                                    KATHERINE
                    Can I ask where?

                                    LAMB
                    The hotel where she worked.  He 
                      thinks she was seeing somebody 
                    else.                                                                                    28.


                                    KATHERINE
                    Don t they all.

      Lamb smiles, gets in his truck.  Katherine watches him as he 
      drives away.  CUT TO: 



      A 12-foot high NEON COWBOY waves from his side, strapped onto 
      a flatbed truck. The flatbed RUMBLES off.  The cowboy WIPES 
      frame, WAVES GOODBYE, revealing across the street - 

      Johnny Savino directs WORKERS as a new NEON SIGN is CRANED 
      into place.. elegant cursive letters read:  The Shangri La.   

      Across the street, Benny Cash watches in front of his casino, 
      the EL RANCHO.  Cowgirl waitresses and sawdust floors.  Lamb, 
      Frank, Dixon and Lon walk up to Benny.  Benny looks dismayed.

                                    BENNY
                    New operators muscling in, boys.  
                      Buying up every casino they can.  

                                    FRANK
                    What about you, Benny?

                                    BENNY
                      I don t wanna say they ll have to 
                    carry me out dead first, because 
                    these guys would do it. 

      He retreats to his casino.  Lamb turns to his brothers and 
      Lon.

                                    LAMB
                          (to Lon)
                      There s a biker bar off in Warm 
                      Springs.  See if anybody knows who 
                    was riding out in the desert Friday 
                      night.
                          (to Frank)
                    You and I will talk to Anna s co-
                      workers.  Dixon, play nice with 
                      security and see when they last saw 
                    Anna.

                                    DIXON
                    My talents are being under-
                      utilized.  

                                    LAMB
                    Go.                                                                                    29.


      Savino glances across the street and his eyes land on Lamb.  
      Off Savino --


      Dixon glances up to the sky -- another DC-6?  Frank looks --

      DOWN THE STREET

      Thirty leather clad HELLS ANGELS roll down the center of 
      Fremont.  WEAVE around frozen drivers.  REVVINGtheir 
      engines.  A whisky bottle FLIES through the air...

      ... andSHATTERS at Frank s feet.  The label: Cabin Still.  
      The Lead Biker JUMPS his bike over the sidewalk and into --


      ... outonto Fremont St.  It CRACKS open.  Silver dollars 
      SCATTER and ROLL.   Dixon looks to Frank.

                                    DIXON
                      Motorcycles.


      - A PHALANX of BIKERS ride side-by-side down the now-deserted 
      streets.  Like they own the town.  PULL BACK as they pass --


        White-jacketed doctors walk in the entrance.


      The bikers have encamped in an empty tire store parking lot.  
      Drinking, smoking, working on their bikes.                                                                                    37.



      The Clerk LOCKS the door as Lamb exits.  Lamb joins Frank and 
      Lon.  Across the street, the bikers. 

      An eerie calm has descended.  In the stores, Merchants peer 
      out doors.  Others PULL down shades.  Everyone terrified.  
      Lamb unwraps a stick of gum and puts it in his mouth.  

                                    LAMB
                    You talk to Dixon?

                                    FRANK
                    He s getting the boys together.

      The three men cross the street.   

      IN THE PARKING LOT

      All the bikers eye Lamb as he approaches the Lead Biker, 
      MONTY, looking up from wiping down his bike. 

                                    MONTY
                      Lookiehere... The Lone Ranger and 
                      Tonto.  What can I do for you boys?

                                    LAMB
                          (tosses bottle)
                    It s what we can do for you.

      Monty CATCHES it.  Checks out the label.  Cabin Still.  
      Approves.  He opens it and takes a pull.  A beat.

                                    MONTY
                    And what s that?  

                                    LAMB
                      Twenty miles out of town is Mt. 
                      Charleston.  
                                    (MORE)                                                                                    38.

                                  LAMB (CONT'D)
                      There s a campsite big enough for 
                    you and all your bikes.  No one 
                    will bother you up there.

                                    MONTY
                      Nobody s bothering us here.

                                    LAMB
                    For now, but the Mayor is calling 
                    in the National Guard and they re 
                    going to bother everybody.  

                                    MONTY
                    Why do you care?

                                    FRANK
                    We don t want soldiers shooting 
                      bikers on the street. It s bad for 
                      business.

      Monty gauges Lamb.  

                                    MONTY
                      What s your name?

                                    LAMB
                    Ralph Lamb.

                                    MONTY
                    If I see any law up there, you and 
                      I will talk again.

                                    LAMB
                    You know where to find me.

      Lamb, Frank and Lon walk away.  Off Monty --


      Stars dot the moonless sky.  The SOUND of Choppers 
        reverberates up the mountain road. 

      The bikers STREAM in.  Bottles CRASH against trees.   Signs 
      and benches are SMASHED.   They SPIN out on the grass and 
      gather in the center of the park.

      IN THE TREES

      Suddenly, horses BURST through the pines... the Lamb brothers 
      and a dozen cowboys from the ranch, FLYINGthrough the woods 
      on horseback.  Raw-boned, ranch tough men.  Armed with 
      shotguns.                                                                                      39.


      Lamb is the lead.  He rides into the opening, FIRES his 
      shotgun in the air.  The bikers freeze.  Sees cowboys on 
      horses coming from all directions, surrounding them.  Monty 
      looks up, in panic, GUNS his bike.  Tries to FLEE, speeds 
      right towards a horse --

      Lon FLIPS his shotgun, SWINGS it like a baseball bat.  
        CLOTHESLINES Monty --

      Monty is LAUNCHED off his bike, crumbles in a heap on the 
      grass.  The other bikers slowly LIFT their arms in 
        surrender...


      Lon, Frank and Lamb approach the makeshift grave.  The desert 
      is now carpeted with SMALL GREEN PLANTS, white FLOWERS 
      forming at the tips.  

                                  LON 
                      Sprouted up yesterday.  Cryptantha
                      flower.  My uncles used it for 
                      rashes.

                                    FRANK 
                    Good to know, come rash season.  
                    Can we go back now? 

      Lon ignores him.  Makes his point to Lamb. 

                                  LON
                    The flowers pop up like this, it 
                    means it rained a few days ago.  I 
                      confirmed with the Park Rangers 
                    that it rained the night before 
                    Anna was killed.

      Lon SHOVES his hand into the hole, comes up with a fistful of 
      still damp soil.

                                  LON (CONT D)
                    It s still wet.  Means the hole was 
                    dug the night it rained.                                                                                      41.


      Lamb reacts -- sees where Lon is going.

                                  LON (CONT D)
                    When the Angels were in Barstow.  
                    150 miles away.  

      Lamb considers.

                                    LAMB
                    Not their style anyway. 
                          (off Frank s look)
                    You dig a grave in advance so you 
                    don t have lug a dead body out here 
                    and then spend a couple hours 
                      digging.  It takes planning.  
                      That s not the way these bikers 
                    work.   

                                  LON
                    But the tracks match. They were out 
                    here at some point.   

                                    LAMB
                    Just not dumping Anna s body.

      A beat.  Lamb tries to make sense of it.

                                    LAMB (CONT D)
                      Somebody else brought her out here 
                    that night.  This wasn t a random 
                      killing,  Whoever did it, planned 
                    it. They wanted her dead.
                          (turns to Frank)
                    You ever get those files on the 
                      high-rollers?

                                    FRANK
                      I asked yesterday.  Nothing yet.

                                    LAMB
                    Maybe there s a reason. 

      He starts back up the hill.  Frank looks after him, confused.

                                    FRANK
                    Where are you going now?

                                    LAMB
                    To a party.


      Klieg lights.  The latest cars.  Crowds jam the entrance.                                                                                    42.



      A roadside BILLBOARD reads:  LAST CHANCE FOR GAS, 200 MILES.   
      Beyond the sign... endless dark desert.

        A jet-black sedan pulls up to the pumps.  The headlight beams 
      reveal the  CLOSED  sign hanging in the window.  The door 
      opens... and D.A. Reynolds gets out.  

      A figure emerges from the shadows... SHERIFF CLYDE OLSON (45)  
      Unshaven, sallow-eyed.  Desperate.   Reynolds takes him in.

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                      Clyde, are you okay?

                                    OLSON
                    Hell no, Rich.  I m in a jam.   You 
                    heard what they did to my sister?  
                            (confesses)
                    Those mob boys think I m a rat.   I 
                    need your help.  They ll kill me.

      Reynolds looks at Olson -- a broken man, on the verge of 
      losing it.   

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    Meet me at Hoover Dam, tomorrow 
                      afternoon.  I ll bring the Feds.  
                      They ve been dying to clamp down on 
                    these Chicago grease balls.

                                    OLSON
                    And no jail?

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    DOJ will re-locate you. 

      Reynolds moves back to the car

                    Get a jacket.  Buffalo gets chilly 
                    this time of year.   

      He gets in and drives away.  Off Olson, his eyes tracking the 
      tail lights, a ghost, we --

                                          ACT THREE


      Lapis blue water SHIMMERS.  Tanned, chubby men in bathing 
      suits smoke cigars and play blackjack at a floating card 
      table.  The Dealer is also in a swimsuit, but he s wearing a 
      black bow tie. He s handing out the cards.  Savino leads 
      Benny Cash through the pool area. 

                                    SAVINO
                    I m glad you re letting me show you 
                      around.   

                                    BENNY
                    My pleasure.

      Attendants OPENdoors as Savino and Benny walk in.  


      The monolith.  Immense concrete walls jut up from the river 
      basin.  A car pulls up and Clyde Olson exits.  

      Out on the rim, D.A. Reynolds peers down the 700 ft. drop to 
      the river below.  Olson walks up, looks around.  

                                    OLSON
                    Where are the Feds?                                                                                    55.

                      They ll be here.
                            (marvels)
                    Four billionkilowatt hours each 
                    year.   Enough to light up ten 
                      cities the size of Manhattan. 
                    This town is just going to keep 
                      growing.  There s no end in sight.

                                    OLSON
                    You can keep it.  The whole 
                      stinking place is rotten.  I m done 
                    here.  

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS
                    It seems so.

      Reynolds steps back and walks toward the entrance.  

                                    D.A. REYNOLDS (CONT D)
                      Goodbye, Clyde.

      Olson watches him, confused.  Then he sees Savino appear.

                                    OLSON
                    Who the hell are you?  

      He looks, sees Cota and Borelli approach from the opposite 
      end.   Olson backpedals and Savino grabs him.  As he drags 
      Olson to the rim of the dam --

      FIND Reynolds, getting in his car at the entrance.  Business 
      as usual.  He pulls away.  Revealing a SIGN --

      ON SIGN.  A tribute to the workers killed while building the 
      dam.  The text reads:  THEY DIED TO MAKE THE DESERT BLOOM .

      HOLD on the sign.  We hear the Sheriff s SCREAM as he 
      plummets off the edge, and  CUT TO --


      A neon sign fizzles.  A dead end flea bag.


      Mills TUMBLES out the back window.  LANDS hard on the ground, 
      starts to SCAMPER away.  A boot TRIPS him --                                                                                    56.


      Mills FALLS.  Rolls over -- a GUN in his hand.  The boot 
      STOMPS down on his wrist.  Mills YELPS in pain.  Looks up, 
        terrified...

      Lamb looms over him.  Off Mills, terrified --

                                    MILLS (O.S.)
                    I m not lying to you.  I didn t 
                    touch that girl...


      Lamb and Frank take Mills out of the motel room and to their 
      truck.  Dixon jumps in.  As they pull out...

      REVERSE ON POV

      Hidden from view, a man in a car -- red Pontiac convertible -- 
      watches from across the street.  Bob Perrin.  He sees the 
      Lambs drive off with Mills.  Perrin floors the pedal and 
      hauls out in the opposite direction.  Off this --


                                    END ACT THREE                                                                                    59.


                                            ACT FOUR


      A plane sits idle.  The engine panel open.  Mechanics tweak 
      the engine.  Perrin finishes loading the plane.  In a hurry, 
      trying not to sound nervous.

                                    PERRIN
                    How are we... doing?

                                    MECHANIC #1
                    Few minutes more.  

        PerrinGLANCES out at the road.  A CLOUD of DUST rises...  

      Lamb and his brothers approach the airport -- not on horses 
      this time.  In Lamb s truck, followed by the FLASHING LIGHTS 
      of the Deputies  cars.                                                                                    60.


      Perrin YANKS his bags out of the plane.  Takes off running... 
      towards his car.  Parked at the edge of the runway.

      Lamb s truck stops at the plane.  He steps out, rifle in 
      hand.  Looks up as --

        Perrinruns, fifty yards away.  Sees Lamb.  Stabs his hand in 
      his waistband and pulls out a gun.  FIRES --

      Bullets PLINK-PLINK into the plane, narrowly missing Lamb.  
      Lamb STEADIES.  Raises the rifle.  AIMS.  

      IN HIS SIGHTS

      Perrin.  Dead to rights.

      Lamb hesitates, then LOWERSthe barrel -- he can t shoot a 
      man in the back.  Frank speeds up in his truck.  

                                    FRANK
                    Get in.

      Lamb JUMPS on the running board...


        PerrinROCKETSthe Pontiac off the edge of the runway.  Miles 
      of desert ahead.  Frank s truck follows.  Eating up brush and 
      rock.  

        Perrincasts a nervous glance to the approaching truck.  
      Reaches back and FIRES --

      The truck s windshield SHATTERS.  Frank SWERVES then SPEEDS 
      ahead.  Lamb BALANCESon the running board as Frank ANGLES 
      the wheel and the truck flies closes in on Perrin.  

      Lamb RAISES the rifle.  AIMS.  FIRES.

        Perrin sfront tire EXPLODES.   SHARDS of rubber fly.  SPARKS 
      fly off the rim as it bounces off the rocks -- 

      Lamb SWINGS the rifle.  Resets his aim.  FIRES again.  

        Perrin sback tire EXPLODES.   Perrinloses control... and 
      the car FLIPS, taking out a fence, coming to rest a few yards 
      from a HERD OF CATTLE.  Frank pulls up.  Lamb jumps out.  
      Reaches down into the wreckage and DRAGS out Perrin.  As the 
      car SMOKESand FLAMES, we CUT TO:


      The unhappy BIKERS roll past the LEAVING LAS VEGAS sign.

      Leading the pack is Monty.  Shaved and scrubbed clean.  
      Clothes laundered and freshly pressed.  Like he could be 
      heading to church.  As the procession moves forward...


      Lamb steps out to the middle of the road.  RAISESthe shotgun 
      and FIRES a blast over the bikers  heads --

      Monty STARTLES at the BLAST.  His bike SWERVES.  The bikers 
      SCRAMBLEto avoid hitting each other.  It s chaos.

      Lamb watches the bikers recover and recede into the desert. 


      At least twenty cars trail the Lambs now, FLASHING lights, 
      BEEPING horns.  


      Mayor Bennett has assembled a handful of local PRESS.  
      Merchants stream out of businesses -- their terrified faces 
      replaced with wide smiles.  As Lamb s truck approaches, the 
      crowd surges towards the street.                                                                                    66.



      Lamb gets out.  Applause.  Flashbulbs POP.  The Mayor WRAPS 
      his arm around Lamb and POSESfor the photographers.  

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                          (sotto)
                    The Governor sends his thanks.
                          (then to press)
                    And make sure you write that Las 
                    Vegas is the safest town in 
                      America. 

      Off the Mayor, soaking it in and Lamb, the man of the moment, 
        uncomfortable in the spotlight.  His eyes drift across the 
      street --

      SAVINO.  Stands in front of the Shangri La, watching Lamb.  
      Their eyes meet.  A moment.  Two foes, acknowledging each 
      other.  Savino nods to Lamb, then walks inside.  Off Lamb, 
      sensing it s not the last time they ll cross paths --  


      The sun starts to dip behind the foothills.  Lamb pulls up in 
      his truck.  Ranch hands wrangle horses in the corral.  Cale 
      leans on the fence.  Lamb walks over.  Cale sees him.  

                                    CALE
                      I heard you caught the guy.  

      Cale s eyes moisten, turns back to watching the horses.

                                    LAMB
                    She wasn t cheating on you.  I 
                      thought you should know.

      A beat.  Cale tries to shake it off.  

                                    CALE
                    We didn t want much.  Just our own 
                      little piece of it.  

                                    LAMB
                      I would ve like to have met her.  
                      Sounded like the real deal.                                                                                    67.


      Cale nods.  She was.  After a beat...

                                    LAMB (CONT D)
                    If you need work, I m always 
                      looking for a good hand.   

                                    CALE
                    May be good to put some miles 
                      between me and this town.  

      Lamb nods.  Cale faces him.  The men shake hands.  A look of 
        understanding between them.  Lamb walks back to his truck. 

      A DC-6 airliner flies overhead.  Lamb stops, watches as it 
      approaches McCarren, the lights of the Vegas skyline 
      twinkling in the distance.  Both magical and ominous.

      As the plane descends, a car drives up to the barn.  
      Katherine gets out.  Somber.  Off her --


      Headlights ILLUMINATEthe choppy surface.  In the distance, 
      HOOVER DAM looms, the massive monolith lit by floodlights.  
      Lamb s truck pulls up.  Followed by Katherine s car.  They 
      get out and make their way down to the river.

      Mayor Bennett and D.A. Reynolds wait as Fish and Game workers 
      gaff an object floating in the reeds -- a body, lying face 
      down.

      The workers haul the sodden corpse onto the bank...

      SHERIFF CLYDE OLSON  

      Katherine and Reynolds stand in shock.  Lamb s eyes pan down 
      to his shirt.  Under Olson s jacket, a BADGE is pinned to his 
      shirt pocket.

      TIGHT ON the words, pressed into brass:  SHERIFF, CITY OF LAS 
      VEGAS. 

      BACK ON LAMB.  The Mayor slaps him on the back.

                                    MAYOR BENNETT
                    You got yourself a new job. 

      He walks back up the bank.  Off Lamb, his future unfolding, 
      we --
