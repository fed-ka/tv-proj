      QUICK CUTS:  ADAM, BLAKE and ANDERS are merrily decorating.  

      ANDERS places a FRAMED CHRISTMAS PHOTO of him and the guys on 
      the mantle.

                                  BLAKE
                          (re: photo)
                    Hung by the chimney with care, fine 
                    sir.


      Ders and ADAM are putting the final touches on a CHRISTMAS 
      TREE with BEER-CAN ORNAMENTS as BLAKE teeters on a chair 
      placing a BEER BONG FUNNEL on top like an angel.

                                  ANDERS
                          (singing)
                    Do you see what I see?  

                                  ADAM
                          (singing wrong)
                    I sure do.  A star dancing in the 
                    night. 


      The guys, drinking EGGNOG from a GIANT KEG, squeeze FROSTING 
      onto CHRISTMAS COOKIES (one is a Santa on fire).

                                  ADAM
                    Okay, guys, time to bundle up.  
                    We ve got some cheer to spread.

                                                                            CUT TO:                      Workaholics 106 - Network Draft - 4/2/10             2.



      ALICE is at her desk on the PHONE.  The guys, still bundled 
      up in Christmas garb, give a slight knock on the open door 
      and come in.

                                  ALICE
                          (into phone)
                    I ve gotta go, someone just took 
                    three shits in my office.
                          (hangs up, to guys)
                    What... are you wearing?

                                  ANDERS
                    Alice, since we are your top 
                    earners and we ve been here over a 
                    year with no time off or any 
                      vacation...

                                  ADAM
                    Which we don t even mind because we 
                    love working for such a multi-
                    talented professional...
                          (flirting)
                    ... confident lady of the world 
                    such as yourself.

                                  BLAKE
                    But we were wondering if we could 
                    get a couple of days off to 
                    celebrate Half Christmas.  A 
                    tradition in the Holmson-DeMamp-
                    Henderson household.

                                  ADAM
                    It started in July four years ago 
                    when Blake here went out to buy a 
                    keg, but returned with a keg full 
                    of eggnog.  It s become a super 
                    deeply religious tradition.

                                  BLAKE
                    The eggnog was on sale.  Probably 
                    because it d been there since 
                      Christmas.

                    We drank that sweet nectar of gods, 
                    we sang, and Adam ended up naked in 
                    the neighbor s truck.

                                  ADAM 
                    And so it was that Half Christmas 
                    was born.

                                  ANDERS
                    What do you say?  It s just two 
                    days. 

                                  ALICE
                    Get the fuck out of my office.


      The guys are gathered at their cubicle licking their wounds 
      after Alice s steam roll job.

                                  ADAM
                    She pretty much just  talk to the 
                    hand -ed us.

                                  ANDERS
                    You realize you rarely make any 
                    sense. 

                                  ADAM
                    Your hair doesn t make sense. 

                                  BLAKE
                    Guys!  We can t let her negativity 
                    tear us apart.  It doesn t matter 
                    where we are... the spirit of Half 
                    Christmas lives in all of us.

                                  ADAM
                    Blake s right.  We should totally--  
                    wait, was there a plan in what you 
                    just said?  Or were you just like 
                    saying something super profound?

                                  ANDERS
                    I think he s saying if we can t 
                    stay home for Half Christmas, we 
                    should celebrate it here.

                                  BLAKE
                          (covering)
                    Exactly.

                                  ANDERS
                    Right.  Except if I fall asleep, 
                    and somebody dyes my balls purple, 
                    you will see the Norwegian side of 
                    me.

      Adam and Blake look terrified.

                                  BLAKE
                    Ders, trillax your mind.  Let s 
                    just go get decorations so we can 
                    turn this boring cubicle into a 
                    magical Half Christmas winter 
                      wonderland.

                                  ADAM
                    Time to stomp this yard.


      The guys put the finishing touches on their Half Christmas 
      cubicle decorations.  Their CHAIRS are WRAPPED in wrapping 
      paper, some of it looks a bit Christmas-y, some of it says 
       Happy Retirement.   POPCORN STRINGS and BLINKING LIGHTS run 
      along the cubicle walls.  They are trimming what looks to be 
      the sawed off BOTTOM HALF of a CHRISTMAS TREE.  Alice enters, 
      visibly annoyed.

                                  ALICE
                    Down.  Now.  All of it.  It s 
                      distracting the entire office.

                                  ADAM
                    How so?

      A TOY TRAIN WHISTLES past on a track running atop the cubicle 
      walls.  It circles the entire office.  JILLIAN pops over the 
      cubicle wall wearing a TRAIN CONDUCTOR S HAT.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Next stop--
                          (notices Alice)
                    Work Town.

      Jillian takes off the hat and exits awkwardly.

                                  ALICE
                    And put that tree back.  It was 
                    obviously pulled from the shrubs 
                    outside the building.

                                  BLAKE
                    It most certainly was not.  In 
                    fact, it s not even real.  We 
                    bought it at--

      A BIRD flies out of the tree and through the office.  

                                  ALICE
                    I m going to take a growler.  This 
                    shit better disappear before mine 
                    goes swirling down the bowl.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                      Workaholics 106 - Network Draft - 4/2/10             9.

      Alice turns to leave.

                                  BLAKE
                    Why are you being a Scrooge McDuck?  
                    The least you could do--

                                  ALICE
                    Shut your mouth, Sideshow Bob. 

      Alice throws their tree in the trash. 

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    P.S.  There s no such thing as Half 
                      Christmas.

      Alice exits.  The guys are taken aback.  Adam is furious.

                                  ADAM
                          (calling after)

      Ders is alone in the cubicle when Alice approaches with TWO 
      NEW CUBE-MATES.  DEAN, mid-thirties.  JERRY, late sixties.

                    Hey loner, I found you a couple of 
                    new work buddies.  I need you to 
                    get them up to speed.  I m putting

                    Uh... yeah.  But what about Blake

                    What about them?  As far as I m 
                    concerned they quit.  

      As Dean and Jerry set up shop in Blake and Adam s CHAIRS,  
      Anders looks out the window at the guys having fun, toasting 
      eggnog, etc. 

      Off Anders, conflicted.

      FADE IN:

      We turn the page of our LARGE CHRISTMAS-Y STORYBOOK...


      Jerry is very methodically hanging PICTURES of his 
      grandchildren up in the cubicle which is already filled with 
      his FAMILY PICTURES.  Dean has put up a SERENITY PRAYER.

                    My lifeline used to be meth.

                    Oh, my oldest son is a Methodist 
                    minister.  Now his son plays in the

                    That s great, Jerry.  But if we

                    The softball league he s in is run 
                    by Lutherans.  If that doesn t beat

                    Do we get breaks at all?  I really 
                    would like to call my sponsor, this

                    calling me  Ann-ders  and I m sick 
                    of it.  It s ON-ders.  What dontcha 
                    get?

      Anders storms off repeating his name.

                                  ANDERS (CONT D O.S.) (CONT D)
                    There s an ON at the beginning.  A 
                    hard ON!


      Jerry points to one of his dozens of framed family pictures.

                                  JERRY
                    And this is my granddaughter, 
                    Margaret.  She s a champion archer.

                                  ANDERS
                    Splendid. 

      Jerry points to Ders  framed Half Christmas picture.

                                  JERRY
                    Is that your family?

                                  ANDERS
                    Somethin  like that. 

      Ders is gazing longingly at the picture (should he take a 
      quick look outside and see the fun going on?) when Alice 
      stops by Ders  cubicle. 

                                  ALICE
                    Holmson.

      It takes Ders a second to snap to attention.

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    I need you on a special assignment 
                    and I need you mobile.  Take this.

      She hands him a WIRELESS EXECUTIVE HEADSET.  SPARKLE!  He 
      puts it on, loving it.

                    Glad I can count on you to stick 
                    with the team.  You re a regular, I 
                    don t know... Derek Jeter or some 
                    sports shit.

      Ders looks back to the Half Christmas photo on his desk.  
      He s torn for a moment, then catches HIS OWN REFLECTION in 
      the photo and sees how cool he looks in the headset.  He puts 
      the frame on his desk, face down.

                    You know, some people say luck is

      Ders is interrupted by some noise down the hall...


      Adam and Blake are standing on a table in the middle of the 
      office   la Norma Rae, rallying a crowd of co-workers.

                                  ADAM
                    We re not gonna take it anymore!

                    SUCK OUR DICKS!  SUCK OUR DICKS!  

      The crowd starts joining in.  Ders and Alice make their way 
      through to the front of the crowd.

      Anders reluctantly goes to get Adam off the table.  An 
      awkward struggle ensues.

                    Don t touch me! / Come down here!

      Adam ends up over Anders  shoulders, in a fireman s carry.  
      He starts carrying him outside.

      We turn the page of our LARGE CHRISTMAS-Y STORYBOOK...


      Ders is overworked.  He s trying to send a fax for Alice, but 
      her phone is RINGING.  He picks up.

                                  ANDERS
                    Hello, Alice Murphy.  Please hold.
                          (to Alice)
                    It s corporate on line 1.

                                  ALICE (O.S.)
                      Wonderful.  Why don t you stay on 
                    the call and see how them big dicks 
                    swang.

                                  ANDERS
                          (kissing ass)
                    Ha.  Swang.  
                          (into phone)
                    I m connecting you now.


      Alice is on the phone with corporate, INTERCUT with reactions 
      from Ders (at Jillian s desk) listening.

                                  ALICE
                          (into phone)
                    Hey, Wayne.  Yes, this stupid 
                    strike is under control...  No, I m 
                    positive this isn t about the  do 
                    not call  list.  Because they don t 
                    even know about it...  I ll handle 
                    it.  Okay.  Tell Rachel I said 
                    thanks for the cookies.
                          (she hangs up)
                    They tasted like ass.


      Alice approaches Ders, leaning over, confidential-style. 

                                  ALICE
                    Hey, buddy.  Let s keep that  do 
                    not call  list stuff on the hushity-
                    hush, right?

                    I guess so.  I mean, it really 
                    makes it harder for sales if we re 
                    calling people that already said 
                    don t call.  Not to mention it s 
                    totally illegal.

                                  ALICE
                    Yeeeah.  Listen, you want to run 
                    with the big dogs?  Sometimes 
                    you ve got to wear a muzzle.

      She pantomimes putting a muzzle on Ders  face and tying it 
      behind his head.

                                  ALICE (CONT D)
                    Got it?

                                  ANDERS
                          (playing along)
                    Mmm hmm.


      Blake and Adam are eating cereal at the breakfast table.  
      Ders enters.

                                  ADAM
                    Morning, scab.

      Ders tries to pour himself a bowl of TRIX, but Adam snags the 
      carton out of his hand.

                                  BLAKE
                    Sorry, Ders.  Trix are for kids... 
                    and union workers.

                                  ADAM
                    Yeah.  Maybe you should stop and 
                    get some food at  Traitor Joe s. 

      Anders stares daggers.  Blake and Adam hi-five.


      Adam and Blake sit in the back seat while Ders drives.

                                  ADAM
                    Hey scab driver and low down dirty 
                    dogg, can you drop us off right 
                    here, please?

      Ders stops the car and lets the guys out, into:                     Workaholics 106 - Network Draft - 4/2/10             24.



      Alice comes out to talk to Anders before he can even sit 
      down.  He s trying to wipe the kegnog off of his outfit.

                                  ALICE
                    Here, I want you to give your 
                    friends their last paychecks.   
                    Show them what team you re playing 
                    for.  Oh, and tell them thanks for 
                    giving it thirty percent every day.

      Anders swallows and sucks it up.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                    Workaholics 106 - Network Draft - 4/2/10             25.

                    You re being groomed, And-ers.

      Ders is frozen -- no she didn t! -- stung by the betrayal of 
      her mispronouncing his name.  Ders exits.


      On one side of the table: Alice and Ders.  On the other, Adam 
      and Blake, with a semicircle of their co-strikers behind 
      them. 

                                  ALICE
                    Okay.  Tell me what the hell this 
                    is all about.  You have a  list of 
                    demands? 

      Adam reads from a list.

                                  ADAM
                    Six paid personal days off per

                    The party is pretty much the reason

                    That s a good list.  Some good 
                    ideas in there.  What I think you 
                    guys should do at this point, is 
                    chop your dicks off, and then park 
                    them up your own buttholes.

                                  ADAM
                          (to Blake, whispering)
                    Okay.  We use that as a starting 
                    point, and negotiate from there.

                                  ALICE
                    And-ers, get these jag-holes off 
                    our company property.

      Anders doesn t react. 

                                  BLAKE
                    Oh, I m pretty sure that s not 
                    going to happen.

      He pulls out PAPERS from the ENVELOPE that Ders gave him, and 
      slides them across the table to her.

                    That s... nonsense.  That doesn t 
                    mean anything.

                                  BLAKE
                    You want to try to explain why all 
                    of your employees were calling 
                    numbers on the  do not call  list? 

                                  ALICE
                    Look, I was just following orders 
                    to protect my job.  Recycling the 
                    leads was all corporate.

                                  ADAM
                    Oh really.  Well who s going to 
                    protect our jobs?

      Adam and Anders discretely exchange low-fives.  That was 
      dope!

                                  ALICE
                    Okay, okay.  I ll give you all your 
                    jobs back.  And I ll give you two 
                    paid personal days per year.

                                  CO-WORKER 2
                    Well that s not good enough!

                                  ALICE
                    Fine.  I can t give you milkshake 
                    water fountains, because that s not 
                    a real thing.  But you can have the 
                    rest of the day for your stupid 
                    Half Christmas Party.

                    health insurance?  My daughter has

      Adam runs up to Alice to shake her hand.

                                  ADAM
                          (to Lupus Lady)

                    You got yourself a deal.
