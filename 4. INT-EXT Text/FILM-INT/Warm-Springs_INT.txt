The same MAN is illuminated by the light of a single candle.
He is dancing, holding on tightly to a WOMAN.
2.
Though the light is dim it is clear that he is clean shaven,
with his hair neatly trimmed.
Their connection is powerful and alive. They stop dancing,
overwhelmed with mutual desire.
He holds the WOMAN's face in his hands and KISSES it all
over, moving into a realm of feeling that is foreign to him.
He kisses her passionately on the mouth.
MAN
Oh, my dear...
His fingers run softly over the outside of her breasts. She
begins to undo the back of her dress and slips it down around
her ankles. Wearing only her tight corset she brings his
hands to the laces and together they undo it.
WOMAN
(whispering softly)
It's all right, darling. It's all
right.

OSCAR, a manservant, is carrying both a silver tray and a
pair of pants over his extended arm.
A VOICE (O.S.)
Oscar! Where the devil are you?
Deftly, Oscar opens the door to a spacious bedroom.
OSCAR
My apologies, Mr. Roosevelt.
6
6
There with his bare legs, muscular and lean, sporting black
socks held up with garters is FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, 39.
He projects a natural elegance and the confidence of a man
who can have anything he wants.
Right now... he wants his pants.
FRANKLIN
I've been standing here for five minutes.
Oscar offers the tray to Franklin which bear cuff links and a
Tiffany watch which Franklin grabs.
3.
OSCAR
Did you sleep well, sir?
FRANKLIN
Don't remember. That's good, isn't it?
OSCAR
Yes, sir.
Franklin takes his pants from Oscar and steps into them,
pulling the suspenders up and over his shoulders.

Striding into the dining room, Franklin lifts a silver lid
off a breakfast plate. He dismisses it and instead pours
himself a cup of coffee from a silver pot on the sideboard.
He overhears a voice from the nearby sitting room.
WOMAN (O.S.)
I could not be more delighted to have
received your most charming letter.
It has been far too long since we last
corresponded. However, it is with
great reluctance I must decline your
kind speaking invitation...
8

ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, 34, is dictating a letter. Her enormous
eyes, liquid and blue, reveal a woman of extraordinary
intelligence and depth.
ELEANOR
Unfortunately, I would be of little
assistance to the Junior Assistance
League. Particularly if my purpose
were to appear as an alumna who is
gifted at public speaking.
She is dictating to LUCY MERCER, 27, deeply feminine with a
head of soft dark hair and an accommodating nature. She is
Eleanor's social secretary and closest friend.
She is also the WOMAN dancing with Franklin the night before.
LUCY
And what do you really want me to say?
ELEANOR
Thank you and if you ask again I
shall scream?
4.
They share a laugh -- which is not shared by the homely
rumpled mess of a man draped over a sofa in the corner.
LOUIS
Why don't you ask your husband for
some pointers? He's a pretty gifted
public speaker, don't you think?
LOUIS HOWE, 48, is a wizened man of limited stature and
unlimited soul. Franklin's political advisor extraordinaire --
part consiglieri and part priest. He is the mastermind behind
what he believes will be the greatest political career of the
twentieth century.
He gets up and leans in closely to Eleanor. A cigarette dangles
off his lip and the smoke rises up and curls in her face.
LOUIS
You should get out once in a while.
Accepting that invitation would be
good for Franklin's career.
ELEANOR
Mr. Howe, wouldn't you be more
comfortable waiting for my husband
outside?
LOUIS
In the street, Mrs. Roosevelt?
ELEANOR
If you like.
Eleanor smiles oh-so politely at Louis, as Franklin enters
from the dining room.
FRANKLIN
I see it's not even eight a.m.
and already the gloves are off.
(kissing Eleanor on the
cheek)
Good morning, Babs. Hello, Miss
Mercer.
L
UCY
Good morning, sir.
Quickly, she lowers her eyes to her work.
LOUIS
(annoyed)
You're late. Honestly, why do you
enjoy keeping people waiting?
5.
FRANKLIN
Because they always seem more
grateful to see me when I arrive.
He leans in and kisses Eleanor on the cheek.
FRANKLIN
Have a lovely day, Babs.
ELEANOR
Should I expect you for dinner?
FRANKLIN
I have the Navy reception this
evening. I'll be home quite late.
Unless you've changed your mind
about coming?
Louis looks up from his paper at Lucy who is writing
furiously.
ELEANOR
Do you wish me to come?
FRANKLIN
Well... whatever you'd like.
ELEANOR
(a beat)
Thank you, no.
FRANKLIN
Very well then.
(tipping his hat)
Good day, Miss Mercer.
Lucy nods and Franklin exits. Then Louis tips his hat to the
ladies and follows him out.
10
10
A large grandfather clock reads 3:00.
The sound of a key in the front door turns and Franklin
quietly enters. His hair is a mess and his clothing is
slightly askew.
As he comes through the hall two eyes shine in the darkness.
They belong to Eleanor sitting rigidly on a settee, listening
to the sound of Franklin's footsteps going up the stairs.
11
11
Franklin goes into his bedroom. Eleanor quietly comes up the
stairs and stops for a brief moment by Franklin's door, then
goes off to her bedroom closing the door behind her.
12
12
Franklin lays sleeping in his bed as Eleanor enters quietly
so as not to wake him.
Carefully she picks up a set of keys on the dresser then
turns and notices a packet of letters sitting on top of an
open duffle bag.
Tentatively she reaches for them. She brings the packet, tied
with a piece of ribbon, up to her nose. She is shocked by
their familiar scent.
With trembling hands she unties the ribbon. Tears flood down
her cheeks as she reads.
Franklin opens his eyes.
CUT TO:
14
14
SARA ROOSEVELT, 65, sits at the head of the table. She is one
for whom the expression "Grande Dame" was coined.
8.
Franklin is at the opposite end of the table, looking pale.
Louis, as always, is by his side.
Eleanor, like a prisoner who has accepted her fate, sits
across from them, calm and composed.
ELEANOR
I have offered Franklin his freedom.
FRANKLIN
And I have accepted.
SARA
(to Eleanor)
His freedom is not yours to offer!
FRANKLIN
I am in love with Miss Mercer, Mama.
LOUIS
Lord save us from fools in love.
SARA
Falling in love is out of the
question. Why do you think men have
mistresses? Duty. Duty to their
families and their careers.
Eleanor rises from the table.
SARA
Where do you think you're going?
ELEANOR
It's obvious that my input in this
matter is of little importance.
She begins to exit the room, but Franklin is up like a shot.
FRANKLIN
Babs!
SARA
Come back here! Both of you!
15
15
Franklin chases Eleanor. Midway up the stairs, she turns.
E
LEANOR
I don't know whether to hate you
or thank you.
9.
FRANKLIN
For what?
ELEANOR
For forcing me to face my life
honestly for the first time.
FRANKLIN
I didn't mean to hurt you, Babs.
ELEANOR
You never do. You live your life
skimming the surface... never aware
of the attachments beneath.
(finding her anger)
It must be a luxury.
She goes up the stairs without looking back.
16
16
Franklin slowly walks back into the room.
SARA
Divorce will finish your career in
politics. How do you intend to
support yourself?
FRANKLIN
My trust fund.
SARA
Divorce Eleanor and there is no
trust fund.
Franklin turns away. He looks out the large picture window
and attempts to light a cigarette, but his hands shake.
LOUIS
We've come so far, boss. State
Assembly, Assistant Secretary of
the Navy -- all pages right out of
Cousin Teddy's play book. We're on
the road to the White House. Don't
do this.
Franklin sees his son, ELLIOT, 10, playing separately from
the rest of his siblings. Elliot looks up at his father as
Franklin bares his best politician's smile at him.
A ROAR begins to fill his ears. It becomes clearer that it is
the sound of a CROWD CHEERING.
10.
CROWD NOISE (O.S.)
Rose-velt! Rose-velt! Rose-velt!
17
17
CONVENTIONEERS shout out Franklin's name holding up PLACARDS
emblazoned with:
"COX/ROOSEVELT IN '20!"
Franklin BOLTS, running vigorously down the center aisle of
the hall lit by the circle of a spotlight. The CROWD goes
wild over this unconventional entrance.
W
hen he reaches the edge of the stage he LEAPS onto it. This
final act of daring pushes the crowd into frenzy.
CLOSE UP - FRANKLIN
18
18
Smiling for no one. For everyone.
FRANKLIN
(breathless)
I humbly accept your nomination for
Vice-President!
The CROWD roars back in reaction to his less-than-humble stance.
FRANKLIN
They say the best way to get
rid of
a man is to have him run for
Vice-
President.
(he holds for the laugh)
You might well have asked my
cousin
Teddy if that's how they got
rid
of him!
Franklin stands on the stage, the music rising, the crowd
cheering. Slowly, the sound of the convention fades to
something far more delicate...
DISSOLVE TO:
19
19
A harp playing in an elegant tea room. The hushed tones of
polite conversation wafts through the air.
Franklin sits with his cousin, ALICE ROOSEVELT, 36, daughter
of Teddy. Brilliant and acerbic, she would have had a career
in politics had she been born a man.
11.
ALICE
Of course you lost. A Roosevelt on
the democratic ticket? Our ancestors
are turning in their graves.
FRANKLIN
Cousin Alice, if Teddy were alive
he'd be a democrat -- and you know it.
ALICE
Rubbish. But I do know one thing:
You're exactly like him. My father
was born wanting only one thing: to
be President.
FRANKLIN
And what's wrong with that?
They both share a laugh.
ALICE
Do you know what they're saying
about you?
Franklin's smile fades.
FRANKLIN
No, but I'm sure you'll tell me.
ALICE
They say F.D.R. stands for
"featherduster." That you're a
lightweight. A dilettante with no
substance; no point of view.
FRANKLIN
Is that what you think?
ALICE
You lead with your vanity. You
talk when you should listen.
Unless these are the qualities of
a democrat?
F
RANKLIN
The democratic party is the party
of the people. I am a man of the
people.
ALICE
Darling, you're a Roosevelt. What
do you know about people?
12.
She leans in conspiratorially.
ALICE
Of course, I can think of one person
you did manage to find the time to
invest in. A Miss Mercer, I believe?
FRANKLIN
Alice, stop.
ALICE
Don't misunderstand me, Franklin.
Being married to Eleanor I think
you deserved some fun. But you made
the right decision. Especially
since Miss Mercer has gone on with
her life.
FRANKLIN
What are you talking about?
ALICE
Edward Rutherford is a wonderful
catch for a girl like her.
FRANKLIN
(stunned)
She's married?
ALICE
Last week. A small event, of course.
FRANKLIN
When I last heard she was governess
to his children.
ALICE
(with a smile)
And then love bloomed. As a "man of
the people," I wouldn't be too hard
on her, Franklin. We can't all have
trust funds you know.
23
23
Franklin lays on a chaise being examined by a DOCTOR, who
leans over him holding out his hand.
DOCTOR
Can you take my hand?
Franklin tries, but can't. Almost his entire body is
paralyzed. He can only breathe and blink.
The Doctor glances at Eleanor, Louis and Sara indicating they
should follow him out.
26

CLOSE-UP - WALLPAPER
A pink background covered in small white flowers with red
centers and green leaves. There is a seam in the paper. A
tiny white spot where glue has soaked through.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Franklin in bed.
This is all he stares at -- hour after hour after hour.
His lips are dry.
A glass of water sits tantalizingly on the night stand. He
reaches for it but it's a few inches out of his reach.
Slowly, he begins to rock his torso back and forth.
27
27
Sara, Eleanor and Louis are in heated conversation.
SARA
Now that politics are out of the
question he can stay here at home
with me.
ELEANOR
But what kind of life is that?
OUIS
I've rented him an office downtown.
He can still practice law.
S
ARA
Why would you want to do that?
LOUIS
Because he needs it.
ELEANOR
He can pursue a career, Mama.
SARA
A man as proud and vital as
Franklin... you're inviting him to
be hurt.
(MORE)
19.
And you, Mr. RA(cont'd)
SA Howe, engaged in the
fantasy of a political future for
my son... is there nothing you
won't do to keep your job?
Sara leaves as Eleanor goes after her.
ELEANOR
Mama! That's not fair!
28
28
Franklin, still rocking his torso, has now gained some
momentum, managing to have moved just a few inches.
29
29
Sara busies herself arranging flowers.
SARA
What kind of life is it to be
pitied and stared at?
ELEANOR
What kind of life is it to be
hidden away? I know you believe
that what you are suggesting for
Franklin is best. But I think you
are making it harder for him.
SARA
I think I know what's best for
Franklin. I am his mother!
ELEANOR
And I am his wife.
Sara stares at Eleanor in disbelief. Eleanor stares back --
unflinching.
30
30
Franklin reaches his arm towards the glass only to fall from
the bed to the floor with a thud. Frustrated beyond words,
Franklin lunges at his wheelchair and shoves it across the
floor letting out an anguished cry.
In agony, from both the pain and the humiliation, he stares
up and fixes his gaze on the ornate ceiling overhead.
Then, closing his eyes, a POUNDING in his head starts to get
louder and louder --
CUT TO:
20.
31
31
Franklin, on his back, his face and body drenched with sweat,
is asleep in his bunk in the boat. He awakens to the sound of
the POUNDING. Voices are calling him accompanied by FISTS
smashing at the door. He opens his eyes and is disoriented.
He tries to sit up -- momentarily forgetting that he can't.
H
e lifts the sheet and visibly WINCES in disgust at the sight
of his crippled legs. BONES covered by FLESH with barely an
ounce of muscle.
Finally the door BURSTS open.
Two young crewman, EUGENE and
STANLEY enter.
EUGENE
Mr. Roosevelt, we got a storm
comin'!
He lifts Franklin over his shoulder. Stanley grabs clothes and
pulls a set of long iron leg braces from a hook off the wall.
Eugene grabs a bucket and holds Franklin up to urinate.
FRANKLIN
(while peeing)
Leave me here. Let the ocean
swallow me up. Burial at sea.
Perfect for a navy man.
Stripped to his underwear Franklin is laid across the bunk.
Eugene kneels and puts on Franklin's socks and shoes. Then he
and Stanley slide on his braces and pants.
Their hands zipper, clasp, buckle and tie. Each hand works in
synchronicity with the other.
Clumsily they lift Franklin up, struggling under his weight.
33
33
Kerosene lamps light the diner which is filled with people,
mostly fishermen, seeking refuge from the coming storm.
Franklin, soaked-to-the-skin and wrapped in a blanket, is
being pushed through the door by Eugene in a wheelchair.
The restaurant collectively pauses to take them.
21.
Franklin is slowly wheeled across the restaurant. He shrinks
from the stares of the patrons.
A LITTLE GIRL eating with her parents gets excited when she
sees Franklin's braces and points. Franklin gives her a hard
look and she is hurt.
What he can't see is that under the table she wears a set of
braces like his.
Franklin is wheeled up to his table and EUGENE and STANLEY sit
down with him.
Louis enters resembling a drowned rat. He rips off his hat
and raincoat and puts down his suitcase.
FRANKLIN
(genuinely surprised)
Louis?
LOUIS
I never miss Florida in the rainy
season.
FRANKLIN
No letter? No wire?
LOUIS
Why? Would you have answered it?
FRANKLIN
What the hell are you doing here?
LOUIS
Good to see you too. Nice whiskers.
You look like Chester Arthur.
FRANKLIN
Stanley, this is Mr. Howe. He gets
sea-sick at the mere sight of a
boat so he's probably happy that
it's being Ldestroyed right now.
OUIS
Boys, I need to talk to Mr. Roosevelt
alone. Find your own breakfast. Here's
a five spot. Make it a feast.
They look at the money and take their leave.
FRANKLIN
You're always so generous with my
money.
22.
LOUIS
You mean your mother's, don't you?
The Waitress puts down two cups of coffee. Franklin pulls out
a flask and pours some into his cup. He then lights a
cigarette and begins smoking, but doesn't offer one to Louis.
Without asking, Louis helps himself.
FRANKLIN
So Mama financed this fool's
errand, has she? Well, it's a waste
of a trip.
LOUIS
It was Eleanor's idea.
Franklin's face is immobile.
WAITRESS
What can I get you?
LOUIS
I'd like some ham and eggs, sunny
side up, please?
(to Franklin)
What's your fancy, boss?
FRANKLIN
Nothing. I fancy nothing.
LOUIS
He'll have the same.
The Waitress grabs their menus and scurries away. Louis opens
his briefcase and hands Franklin a stack of mail. Franklin
glances it, but doesn't open any.
LOUIS
There are a few from your children.
FRANKLIN
I can still read.
Franklin flips through the mail and finds a letter that
interests him, opening it.
LOUIS
Your wife wants you to come home.
(choosing his words)
She's concerned. I'm concerned.
This life on a boat... where is it
getting you?
(
F
23.
FRANKLIN
Getting me? For one thing, no one
gets to see me and I don't get to
see them.
LOUIS
Don't say that. Everyone's waiting
for you to come home. The kids...
they're aching to see you.
RANKLIN
(reading)
Really?
Louis looks sadly at his friend.
LOUIS
What's that?
FRANKLIN
skimming the letter)
From George Foster Peabody. He owns
a resort in rural Georgia for
investment purposes. Hot springs or
something. He claims that only
recently a crippled boy swam in the
waters and can walk again.
LOUIS
Oh, for Chrissake...
FRANKLIN
(reading)
"
The high magnesium content of
these natural springs will hold
anyone up. Although it is not a
resort for infirm types I am
extending you my personal
invitation to come visit in the off-
season."
(putting the letter aside)
I'm only welcome in the "off-
season."
Eugene and Stanley approach the table.
EUGENE
Mr. Roosevelt, we got bad news.
FRANKLIN
What?
F
F
24.
STANLEY
It's the boat... it got banged up
real bad tied to the dock.
RANKLIN
How bad?
STANLEY
I don't think you can stay there
anymore.
ranklin absorbs this.
EUGENE
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise,
Mr. Roosevelt. I don't know about
you, but I'm homesick.
FRANKLIN
And I'm sick of home.
(to Louis)
Where's the letter from Peabody?
LOUIS
You can't be serious?
He hands Franklin the letter who rereads it.
FRANKLIN
Why not miracle waters? I've drunk
the oil of monkey glands, been
zapped with electricity and hung
upside down in harnesses. After all
that, this sounds downright
peaceful.
LOUIS
I can't quite picture you in the
back woods of Georgia.
FRANKLIN
Where do you picture me, Louis?
LOUIS
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
FRANKLIN
President, Louis? I can't visit the
bathroom without a team of
associates to help pull my pants
down.
E

25.
LOUIS
Give it a little time.
RANKLIN
There's a reason they say a man
runs for office.

I'm going to Georgia.

Franklin and Eleanor sit next to one another. Franklin is now
shaved and cleaned up considerably.
However, the tension between them is palpable. Eleanor knits
furiously while talking. Franklin looks out the window at
African-American FIELD HANDS hard at work in the red clay
hills of Georgia.
ELEANOR
James has been doing so much better
now that Elliot has joined him at
Groton. They've put their
differences behind them and have
become a real team.
Franklin observes two YOUNG BOYS, African-American, running
alongside the slow-moving train.
ELEANOR
Two peas in a pod. Last week they
were both in the infirmary with the
F
same cold.
ranklin eyes a wagon pulled by a mule. The driver, a FARMER,
takes off his hat and wipes his brow in the hot sun.
LEANOR
Meanwhile, any suggestion I make to
Anna for her future -- she
dismisses me. I am going to have to
enlist your support in this,
Franklin. She listens to you.
She looks over at Franklin and sees that he is staring out the
window, deep in thought -- not having heard a word she's said.
26.
41
41
Sheets cover the furniture, cobwebs span the beams and dust
particles fill the air.
As Tom maneuvers the wheelchair through the front door,
Franklin notices a broken window.
FRANKLIN
(caustic)
Well ventilated, at least.
Roy enters with a suitcase.
ROY
Where do you want this, Mr.
Roosevelt?
FRANKLIN
The bedroom, Roy, thank you.
He looks after Roy as he exits.
FRANKLIN
Tom, this young man appears quite
competent. Would you ask him if
he'd like to stay on as my valet?
TOM
(politely)
Why don't you ask him yourself?
He tips his hat and goes outside.
43
43
Eleanor stands in the middle of the tiny living room stunned
by the squalor. She speaks to Franklin who is changing in the
other room.
T
31.
ELEANOR
This is madness.
FRANKLIN (O.S.)
No doubt.
ELEANOR
Tell me again, Franklin, why are we
here?
Franklin is wheeled out by Roy, now changed into a bathing
suit.
FRANKLIN
For the waters. Are you coming?
47

Eleanor tosses and turns on a roll away bed.
48
48
Franklin lies in bed staring up at the ceiling.
49
49
A handful of guests are spread out in a huge dining room.
Franklin and Eleanor sit together. He is eating heartily, but
Eleanor merely moves her food around.
ELEANOR
This is simply revolting.
FRANKLIN
It's not very good, but it is
mysterious.
(holding out his plate)
What in the world do you think
they've poured over this chicken?
Or is it possum?
Eleanor sizes Franklin up. She knows this is a preamble.
H
33.
ELEANOR
You want to stay.
FRANKLIN
Yes.
ELEANOR
New York has the best doctors and
hospitals in the country.
F
RANKLIN
I need something new.
ELEANOR
This isn't about getting better is
it? You don't want to come home.
You don't want to live with us.
FRANKLIN
I refuse to be a burden to anyone.
ELEANOR
You're not a burden, you're my
husband.
e reaches out and takes her hand in his.
FRANKLIN
I want to offer you the freedom you
once so generously offered me.
(she pulls it away)
All you've ever known is duty. To
me and to a political career that
unless I can walk no longer exists.
You've been exemplary. Now I'm
telling you you're free to go.
ELEANOR
(her voice rising)
No.
(a beat)
I don't want freedom. I want a
marriage. I want a life with you.
Franklin won't let himself believe it.
FRANKLIN
I can't imagine what you think that
life is going to be.
This takes the wind out of Eleanor.
34.
ELEANOR
Oh Franklin... it's not up to me to
imagine, it's up to you.
Eleanor folds her napkin and gets up from the table.
Eleanor is pouring tea for Louis, who is seated.
ELEANOR
Thank you for stopping by, Mr. Howe.
LOUIS
I thought you might want to see a
friendly face.
(off the silence)
So how's our boy doing?
ELEANOR
Well, he's enjoying the waters very
much. He...
(suddenly overwhelmed)
I think we've lost him.
Her pent-up tears burst in a free-flow. Louis leads her to a
nearby settee and hands her his handkerchief.
E
LEANOR
Please excuse me, Mr. Howe.
LOUIS
Don't you think it's time you
called me Louis?
ELEANOR
Louis.
E
35.
LOUIS
Maybe we've been going about this
all wrong. He's down there to be
alone so let's give him what he
wants. We change our focus.
LEANOR
To what?
Louis smiles, knowingly.
LOUIS
To you.
54
54
Franklin's bed is already empty.
Louis and Eleanor approach a set of double doors.
ELEANOR
We are facing imminent disaster.
LOUIS
I take full responsibility if you
hyperventilate or faint.
They enter the room.

At a lectern, behind which a banner reads "LEAGUE OF WOMEN
VOTERS," the CHAIRWOMAN sees them and waves them forward.
CHAIRWOMAN
Ah, here she is now. Ladies, Mrs.
Franklin Roosevelt.
A small crowd of about two dozen women offer up polite, but
scant applause for Eleanor.
ELEANOR
Good afternoon. I am so pleased to
be invited here today.

cards)
Too often....
A PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture which throws Eleanor off.
40.
ELEANOR
Too often...
She stops. The pause is deadly. Louis looks ready to jump out
a window. Eleanor continues, her voice still pitched too high.
ELEANOR
Too often the great decisions are
originated and given form in bodies
made up wholly of men...
Slowly, she begins to find her voice.
ELEANOR
So that whatever political value
women have to offer is shunted
aside... without expression.
T
his is a mistake.
She looks up from her cards and stares at the audience...
and for the first time speaks spontaneously.
ELEANOR
I think this might be the reason I
am having such a difficult time
giving voice to my own thoughts
here today.
The immediacy of her self-effacing comment charms the room.
ELEANOR
I'm reminded of what someone once
said about looking at an elephant.
That it is impossible to ever see
an entire elephant from one place --
you must walk around it. If our
elected leaders are to be truly
effective then they must be willing
to go out of their way to look
beyond what is right in front of
them. To see the entire elephant.
And for that... they need our help.
The ladies applaud her, much to her relief. Louis beams.
LATER
At a reception following the speech, Eleanor and the
Chairwoman are drinking tea.
F
41.
CHAIRWOMAN
That was so moving, Mrs. Roosevelt.
The Child Welfare Amendment could
use someone with your passion. You
must consider being our

Eleanor looks to Louis who nods.
ELEANOR
Oh. It would be an honor.
CHAIRWOMAN
Wonderful.

Franklin is laid out on the bed as Roy slides the braces off
his legs. Roy unlaces his shoes and slips them off his feet.
e is about to put them under the bed when Franklin motions
for Roy to hand them to him.
Still flat on his back, Franklin luxuriates in the rich
leather cobbled by hand. He examines their smooth, immaculate
soles... worn but never walked in.

A newspaper clipping of Eleanor in her speech to the League

We hear the sound of an Underwood typewriter clacking away

Very good. Do you want this out
today?
F
RANKLIN
Tomorrow will be fine.
MISSY
Alright.
FRANKLIN
Thank you, Missy, and c.c. that to
Louis.
Missy rises with a stack of envelopes and heads out.
Roy enters with a plate of pancakes in front of Franklin.
ROY
Hungry, Mr. Roosevelt?
FRANKLIN
Not really.
ROY
Who do you write to every morning?
FRANKLIN
Different people I knew in
politics. Just in case they ever
want me back.
ROY
So you'll be ready when you get
your legs workin' again?
FRANKLIN
Exactly.
45.
There is a knock at the screen door. An earnest young man,
BENJAMIN PRENDERGAST, 18, is peering in. He has a newspaper.
PRENDERGAST
Excuse me, are you Mr. Roosevelt?
FRANKLIN
Yes. Who are you?
Roy opens the door to Prendergast, who enters.
PRENDERGAST
My name is Benjamin Prendergast.
I've come to see if you could speak
at this year's graduation ceremony
at the schoolhouse. You being so
famous and all.
Prendergast unfolds the newspaper. There is a picture of
Franklin under the heading "FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SWIMS HIS WAY
TO HEALTH!"
FRANKLIN
I'll be damned.
PRENDERGAST
Would you be available?
FRANKLIN
(looking up)
When? Next spring?
PRENDERGAST
Next week. We only have a four
month school year.
FRANKLIN
How is that possible?
PRENDERGAST
Tax dollars only cover that much.
FRANKLIN
Are you graduating?
PRENDERGAST
No, sir. I'm the principal.
FRANKLIN
I see.
But Franklin doesn't see.
46.

A bookshelf with four books.
A few FARMERS and their WIVES sit with large groups of filthy
children. They look at Franklin askance.
Prendergast stands proudly beside three GRADUATES-TO-BE.
Tom stands in the back observing.
Franklin, in his wheelchair, sits uncomfortably before the
gathering. He notices a FATHER staring at his legs.
PRENDERGAST
Now that we're all here let me
introduce to you to our guest
speaker today, Mr. Franklin
Roosevelt.
FRANKLIN
Good afternoon.
A fly begins buzzing around his head. He laughs derisively,
almost to himself.
FRANKLIN
At Groton, where I graduated from
high school, our beloved Headmaster
encouraged his students to enter
public life...
He looks up and catches the glazed eyes of an undernourished
child which unsettles him.
FRANKLIN
I chose to attend Harvard for my
undergraduate work and then
Columbia for my law degree.
H
e takes in their uncomprehending expressions.
FRANKLIN
I followed my Headmaster's advice
and sought a career in public life.
But circumstances beyond my control
have made that... very difficult...
R
6
47.
He stares at his tiny audience, all of whom know something
about circumstances beyond their control.
FRANKLIN
I've given many speeches in my
life... I don't know why I'm having
such a hard time making this one...
Horrified and unable to speak, Franklin seems temporarily
lost, but the tiny audience doesn't seem to notice. They just
see Franklin.
5
65
FRANKLIN
My God did you see how they were
looking at me?
TOM
They welcomed your company, Franklin.
FRANKLIN
Don't patronize me.
Tom is losing his patience.
TOM
Don't patronize them. These people
go to bed night after night with
half-empty stomachs -- your legs
are the least of their worries.
They continue to drive in silence.

The WHISTLE is coming from a MODEL TRAIN as it zooms around a
track set up on a table in the Roosevelt living room. Elliot,
now 15, is mesmerized.
Sara sits at a piano between FRANKLIN, JR., 9, and JOHN, 7.
They are finishing a rousing rendition of "Angels We Have
Heard on High" as an enormous Christmas tree gets decorated.
JAMES, 18, is at the top of a ladder while his sister, ANNA,
19, decorates from the lowest rung.
Eleanor holds up a tiny porcelain ornament to Anna.
ELEANOR
Grandmother Delano brought this
from China.
Franklin, working from his wheelchair is filling out the
lower branches of the tree, his lap filled with ornaments.
E
LLIOT
Have you ever been to China,
Father?
FRANKLIN
No, Elliot. Just your grandmama.
SARA
I adored China. It smelled of
ginger cookies.
L
49.
FRANKLIN, JR.
et's go in the backyard and dig
our way there!
SARA
That sounds like an adventure.
Anna looks over at her father, sadly and Franklin catches her
eye. She quickly looks away.
From behind his back, John, pulls out the Christmas star and
places it on his father's knee.
JOHN
Put it on top.
Silence descends over the room. No one dares to breathe.
ELEANOR
Give it to James. He's the tallest.
JOHN
No.
ANNA
John, give it to him!
JOHN
Papa always does it.
FRANKLIN
I can do it.
Franklin tosses the star in an attempt to reach the top. It
almost catches, but it falls to the floor.
Quickly, aiding to avoid his father's embarrassment, James
climbs back up and puts the star on top. Sara sensing the
awkwardness of the moment begins to play and sing an overly
cheery rendition of "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing."

Roy is spotting Franklin as he pulls himself along a set of
parallel bars. Eleanor observes as Franklin uses his arms to
drag his legs behind him.
ELEANOR
It was an extraordinary turnout
this afternoon. Louis says there
were over two hundred people in the
audience.
50.
FRANKLIN
That's marvelous, Babs.
Eleanor is flushed with pride. Franklin, catching her look,
slips slightly on the bars as Roy grabs hold of him.
ROY
I've got you, sir.
Franklin then takes note that Eleanor's expression has turned
to one of pure heartbreak.
FRANKLIN
You wonder why I want to go back to
Georgia... it's to avoid people who
look at me the way you just did.
ELEANOR
You truly believe the waters...
(with difficulty)
... that they are helping?
FRANKLIN
Don't talk to me as if I were a
child. Choosing your words so
carefully...
ELEANOR
How am I supposed to talk to you?
FRANKLIN
Like I was! Talk to me like I was!
Roy turns Franklin around on the bars and they begin walking
away from Eleanor.
ELEANOR
I don't know how anymore.

Amongst crates and luggage is FRED BOTTS, a young man of
fifteen lying on the floor, unconscious. A wheelchair is next
to him, turned over on its side.
FRANKLIN
Mother of God.
Tom leaps up and into the car as does Roy leaving Franklin
below. Tom takes his wrist.
TOM
His pulse is slow.

Fred lays in Franklin's bed while Franklin sits by the
bedside. Roy lays a cold compress on Fred's forehead.
F
ranklin is using his watch to take Fred's pulse.
Roy pulls back the sheet to give Fred air revealing his
withered legs. Alabaster skin stretched over bones.
Franklin looks away.

Franklin sits at a card table with his check book in front of
him. Tom stands before him, shifting uncomfortably.
FRANKLIN
How many can pay?
TOM
Fewer than half.
Franklin opens the check book and begins writing.
FRANKLIN
I want these people in the
cottages, not in the inn. It's
safer.
TOM
Well, it's the way it has to be.
58.
FRANKLIN
What do you mean?
TOM
I've already had some complaints.
(awkwardly)
This is the start of the season,
Franklin. I've got regulars who
have come for years. Healthy folks
over all... They're threatening to
check out, afraid they might catch
polio.
FRANKLIN
Such ignorance! Don't they know
that after the fever breaks we are
no longer contagious?
TOM
I'm going to have to ask that you
not use the pool during regular
hours. I'll put time aside for you
late in the day... and it won't be
possible for you to eat in the
dining room either. But I promise
I'll find someplace suitable.
FRANKLIN
They don't want us to eat in their
presence?
TOM
Of course for you I can make other
accommodations.
FRANKLIN
(a beat)
That won't be necessary.
Franklin goes back to writing out the check. Tom stands
waiting, the sound of the pen scratching seemingly
interminable. Their mutual discomfort is obvious.
Franklin rips the check from the ledger and holds it for Tom.
TOM
Thank you.
FRANKLIN
We still need a doctor here.
TOM
For Fred?
59.
FRANKLIN
(pointedly)
For everyone.
Eleanor sits in a chair reading Franklin's letter.
FRANKLIN (V.O.)
I am taking on responsibilities
which none of my schooling in the
spheres of higher learning or
politics could have prepared me
for... I have seen the casualties
of war. But I have never seen this,
a suffering so insidious, so
silent, that it rattles my soul."
80

Franklin is tucking Fred in for the night.
FRED
When can I swim?
FRANKLIN
Soon. When you're a little stronger.
FRED
When I'm asleep, in my dreams, I
can still walk.
FRANKLIN
Me too.
(a beat)
How long has it been... since you
walked?
FRED
Nine years. I'd just learned to
ride a bike. After I got sick my
mom was sure that the bike had
caused it.
60.
FRANKLIN
Did she sell it?
FRED
No. She took it out back and shot it.
Franklin howls with laughter, joined by Fred.

Tom oversees the dinner service of paying guests -- none of
whom have disabilities.
83
83
Segregated in a back room, all the polio guests are gathered
for dinner seated around a couple of sawhorses with old doors
thrown across them serving as makeshift dining tables.
Roy carries DAISY in and places her in the chair next to
Franklin.
RANKLIN
Do you have a reservation?
She begins to giggle. It's infectious and soon everyone has a
smile on their face, overriding the awkwardness of the
situation.
FRANKLIN
Whether in here or our there, I
guarantee you the food will taste
the same... terrible.
DAISY
Shouldn't we pray first?
FRANKLIN
By all means. Would you do us the
honor?
Franklin bows his head for grace.
DAISY
Bless the food on our table. Keep
us healthy, strong and able. Amen.
ALL
Amen.

Eleanor is being introduced by Louis to members of the New
York State Assembly -- all men -- eager to shake her hand.
ELEANOR (V.O.)
"Louis's latest flash of brilliance
is to take me 'mainstream.' He said
that you would know what he means
by this."

Franklin lies across a makeshift examining table. Helena's
examination is in progress.
She is completely absorbed -- all business -- pouring over
his muscles inch by inch. She kneads, bends and stretches
them with a laser-like focus, finally picking up Franklin's
leg and rotating it out and around.
HELENA
Push against my hand.
Franklin, with difficulty, tries to do so.
FRANKLIN
Give me the good news first.
HELENA
Your gluteus maximus is better than
I hoped. It will serve you well.
FRANKLIN
Must be all that sitting.
HELENA
I'm serious. Your right leg has
some movement along the thigh.
That's good because we can use it
to help extend your hip, flex your
knee and rotate your tibia.
FRANKLIN
I'm supposed to walk on one side?
HELENA
The water may help build some
strength I'm not able to see yet.
But to do that you would need to
swim in the water much of the day.
Not the limited hours you have now.

Why should this place cater to a
few able-bodied folk when it could
be opened year round with polios?

Franklin sits in his chair at a desk.

FRANKLIN
You'll never guess why I'm calling.

A free wheeling game of poker. Heavy with cigarette and cigar
smoke, Franklin, Tom, Fred, Jake and Pat are playing.
PAT
Polio's always going to be a losing
financial proposition, but it doesn't
mean you shouldn't buy the place.
FRANKLIN
I am buying it. Make no mistake
about that.
PAT
Good for you, Doc.
FRED
If you don't mind my asking, how
will people pay for the services
you are going to offer here? Most
people with polio have a hard enough
time making ends meet as it is.
OM
(gently)
The boy makes a good point, Franklin.
FRANKLIN
Not everything in this world has to
be about profits.

TOM
I'll see your twenty-five and raise
you twenty-five.
J
AKE
C'mon will ya! The night's still
young.
TOM
It's twenty-five cents not twenty-
five dollars.
PAT
Don't mind him, Tom. He's a cheap
bastard.
Fred and Pat fold immediately as does Franklin.
FRANKLIN
Too rich for my blood.
JAKE
(to Tom)
Fine! Here's your twenty-five! You
better have something.
They eyeball each other. Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.
TOM
Take it. I was bluffing.
Gleefully, Jake slaps his hands together and rakes in the pot.
AT
(handing Franklin a fresh
deck)
Your deal, Doc.

Very well. Gentlemen, the game is
Five Card Stud, sevens are wild.
Everyone groans.

Sevens are wild and you can all go

Sara paces wildly, waving a letter at Eleanor and Louis.
SARA
He wants to use his entire trust
fund to buy that... leper colony!
ELEANOR
Franklin has invited Louis and me
to see the work he's been doing.
SARA
(derisively)
Work! Playing in a pool all day
long? Squandering his birthright on
a group of fawning strangers? I
consider this your fault, Eleanor!
ELEANOR
I beg your pardon, Mama?
73.
SARA
You have indulged him and this is
the result.
ELEANOR
(challenging her)
Indulged him? I have indulged him?
Sara looks away.
ELEANOR
He's a grown man who makes his own
decisions.
SARA
But he does not need to buy it.
ELEANOR
If it's of any comfort to you, I
agree.
LOUIS
I'm against it as well. It will
consume too much of his time and
energy.
SARA
Then it is settled. We tell him no.
ELEANOR
No, it is not settled. We must hear
him out. Louis and I must see for
ourselves the work that he has been
doing then we will all discuss this
further.
(a beat)
A
nd tell him no.
They all look at each other for a moment. For once they agree.
SARA
Perhaps I have underestimated you.
ELEANOR
Perhaps you have. But that has been
my fault, not yours.
104

Surrounded by peeling wallpaper and threadbare furniture
E
Eleanor and Louis exchange glances.
LEANOR
What exactly are you proposing,
Franklin?
FRANKLIN
That this will be the first polio
rehabilitation and treatment center
in the world. My personal trust
almost covers the price of the Inn
and the surrounding land. There
will be a modest tuition charged to
the patients which should hold us
over while I seek out investors.
LOUIS
Franklin, you're risking everything
you have...
ELEANOR
And there are other costs to
consider.
FRANKLIN
Mama will see that the children are
provided for.
ELEANOR
I'm not speaking of money.
78.
FRANKLIN
I have found something here which
makes waking up in the morning
remotely bearable and the two of
you stand there...
ELEANOR
Franklin, I need for you to be
practical and realistic.
FRANKLIN
(furious)
Practical? I am trapped inside a
body that no longer moves of my own
volition. I am trying to be
practical. Now either you're with
me or against me. In or out!
ELEANOR
I don't care for ultimatums
disguised as debate.
Eleanor starts to leave.
FRANKLIN
Where are you going? Eleanor! Get
back here.
ELEANOR
I will see you gentlemen tonight.
She leaves.
LOUIS
You can't talk to her like that.
FRANKLIN
Oh really? Are you an expert on
this now? How should I speak to my
wife, Louis?
LOUIS
With the respect she deserves.
(a beat)
Look, I don't deny the work you're
doing here could be important --
FRANKLIN
Could be?
79.
LOUIS
The issue is whether you want to
run a rehabilitation center or
whether you want to run for office
again.
FRANKLIN
When I can walk, I'll run.

The camera pans various tables revealing legs in braces,
legs in wheelchairs, shapely legs, flaccid legs, children's
legs... some reveal illicit romances, betrayed by secret
hand holding and hands on thighs.
Jake and a new physical therapist, MARY BETH, are
particularly cozy.
FRANKLIN (O.S.)
This is a very special night we're
celebrating. At last we are together
eating in this dining room!
The hands come up and out from under the table, applauding.

Now please join me in welcoming
Miss Jackie Mills, a new arrival
along with her father, Samuel, all
the way from Oakland, California.

Let us also take this opportunity to
welcome our two able-bodied guests,
Mr. Louis Howe and my better half,
Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt.
ON ELEANOR AND LOUIS
Waving politely from their seats.
FRANKLIN
Now for the musical portion of our
program...
JAKE
Wait a minute! I can't let this
opportunity pass without saying out
loud what a lot of us feel in our
hearts right now.
(a beat)
You're a man among men, Franklin.
A WOMAN'S VOICE
And women!
DAISY
And children!
JAKE
(laughing)
It's a real democracy at Warm
Springs -- everybody gets heard!
(to Franklin)
You listening?
Eleanor, seated next to Franklin, watches as Franklin, in a
rare moment of emotional nakedness, is at a loss for words.
JAKE
All right then, if I may do the
honors of presenting to you the
lovely Miss Eloise Hutchison of
Cottage C.
Eloise wheels herself out. In a sweet, but untrained voice,
she begins the introduction to her song:
81.
ELOISE
(singing)
"Think of what you're losing by
constantly refusing to dance with me.
Y
Aou'd be the idol of France with me.
nd yet you stand there
And shake your foolish head dramatically,
W
hile I sit here so ecstatically.
You just look and say emphatically:
Not this season!
There's a reason!"
Some members of the audience begin to smile, knowing what's
coming. Various STAFF step out from the kitchen to watch.
Eloise is joined by three others -- all of them in wheelchairs.
ELOISE & CHORUS
(singing)
"I won't dance! Don't ask me!
I won't dance! Don't ask me;
I won't dance, monsieur, with you."
Simple, but clever choreography utilizing the wheelchairs,
has the audience cheering.
ELOISE & CHORUS
"My heart won't let my feet do
C
things they should do."
HORUS
"You know what? You're lovely."
ELOISE
"And so what? I'm lovely."
CHORUS
"But oh! What you do to me!
I'm like an ocean wave that's
bumped on the shore;
I feel so absolutely stumped on the
floor!"
This is too much for the crowd, including Franklin, Eleanor
and Louis. They laugh and cry in equal measure at the sight
of Eloise and her Chorus.
The song finished, Franklin quiets down the crowd.
82.
FRANKLIN
Before we say good night,
I understand our Royal-Taskmaster-
in-Residence, Miss Mahoney, insists
on having the last word.
Helena rises from her seat.
HELENA
I don't think words describe
adequately what Daisy and I would
like to show all of you.
(calling out)
Are you ready, Daisy?
Daisy's mother, Cecile, carries Daisy to the center of the
room where Helena meets them. Helena bends down and removes
Daisy's braces.
The room is hushed.
Daisy then begins to WALK tentatively towards her mother.
ON FRANKLIN
Overwhelmed by what is taking place. He looks around and
takes in the sight of so many different faces...
Some are beaming, some are fighting back tears, some look
away... the sight of it almost too painful... a reminder of
their own private battles.
ON DAISY
Only a step or two away from her mother she FALLS the short
distance and lands in her mother's outstretched arms.
WILD CHEERS go up in the room while Daisy's face glows with
pride. She connects with Franklin, who matches her smile with
his own -- genuine and beatific.

Roy lifts Franklin out of the wheelchair and on to the bed.
Eleanor enters holding a lit candle.
Roy is about to begin Franklin's bedtime routine, but Eleanor
gently reaches out and touches him on the arm.
ELEANOR
Let me.
83.
Roy looks to Franklin, who nods it's all right, and exits.
Eleanor closes the door and puts the candle on the bureau.
A
fter a beat, Franklin begins to unbuckle his pants. He then
lies back on the bed.
ELEANOR
What is your most pressing concern?
Eleanor kneels before him and tugs the pants down, slowly, so
as not to catch on the braces.
Eleanor folds the pants and carefully places them over the
back of a chair.
FRANKLIN
Getting a doctor to live on the
premises full-time. Someone who,
at the very least, could monitor
our progress. Make us legitimate.
She begins to take off Franklin's braces -- a series of
intricate buckles.
Eleanor slides the braces off his legs. His legs, though now
deeply tanned are withered and spindly. He is still wearing
his shoes.
ELEANOR
And that costs more money.
FRANKLIN
Yes.
Eleanor puts the heavy braces against the wall and kneels
once again to untie his shoelaces.
FRANKLIN
But the real problem is no one is
interested. The annual Orthopedics
Convention is being held in Atlanta
this weekend and I offered to
speak.
(his anger surfacing)
They turned me down flat.
Eleanor takes Franklin's pajama bottoms off the bed and with
tender care pulls them up his legs.
84.
ELEANOR
A few weeks ago, the conditions at
a garment factory on West 27th
Street were brought to my
attention. The owners claimed
everything was satisfactory, but
would never let anyone in to
conduct a proper inspection.
She reaches for Franklin's hands and pulls him up to a seated
position. They are now face to face.
ELEANOR
It took awhile, but we finally got in.
FRANKLIN
We?
He searches her face for clues as to the woman she's become.
He starts to unbutton his shirt and put on his pajama top.
Eleanor sits in a chair across from him.
ELEANOR
I showed up with someone from the
Labor Board and we refused to leave
until they let us in.
FRANKLIN
What are you suggesting?
ELEANOR
At the risk of my good standing
with the Junior Assistance League,
I suggest we crash the party.
She stands and walks over to Franklin and runs her hand
through his hair.
E
LEANOR
Good night, Franklin.
She goes to the door and opens it letting in a shaft of light
against the candle-lit room.
FRANKLIN
Good night, Babs.
She blows the candle out and closes the door.

The stage is lit with a skeleton hanging on a stand and large
projections on a screen of spinal discs while a DOCTOR, in a
dull litany, intones a prepared speech.
DOCTOR
A clinical situation where the
radicular or nerve root is
compressed by the prolapsed disc is
referred to as a radiculopathy.
Double doors fly open with a BANG as all heads turn to see
Franklin and Eleanor.
ELEANOR
So sorry we're late!
FRANKLIN
Good afternoon!
Eleanor talks quickly while wheeling Franklin down the aisle.
ELEANOR
(introducing herself)
Eleanor Roosevelt, niece of the
late President Theodore Roosevelt
and this is my husband, Franklin,
former Assistant Secretary of the Navy.
FRANKLIN
(sotto to Eleanor)
Are you sure this worked on 27th
Street?
LEANOR
(under her breath)
It seemed to at the time.
86.
They reach the befuddled Doctor on stage whose name tag
reads, "Dr. Bissell."
ELEANOR
Thank you, Dr. Bissell for agreeing
to let us share the stage with you
today. It was so generous of you.
Dr. Bissell smiles limply, saving face. The audience vaguely
applauds. Franklin and Eleanor are now center stage.
ELEANOR
My husband, as many of you may have
read, is a victim of polio.
However, victim is only a
definition, not a state of mind.
Franklin?
He looks at her completely amazed. Eleanor gives him an
F
encouraging nod to take over.
RANKLIN
We all know that poor circulation
is a chronic problem for limbs
damaged by polio... I've never been
able to swim more than a few
minutes without becoming too cold.
But there's a place, gentlemen...
a miraculous place not three hours
from here where the water is filled
with natural minerals at a
temperature of almost 90 degrees.
That place, gentlemen, is called
Warm Springs.
CLOSE-UP
One DOCTOR in particular, 60's, leans forward in his chair,
listening with great interest.
FRANKLIN
Patients can stay in these waters
for up to an hour. This is
essential in allowing them the time
to work on strengthening their
muscles.
ELEANOR
We have come to the shared
conclusion that research for the
cause and the cure for infantile
paralysis is paramount.
(MORE)
87.
However, until NOR(cont'd)
ELEA that day arrives
more emphasis has be placed on
rehabilitation. We personally
invite you to Warm Springs to come
and take a look. Thank you.
ON THE AUDIENCE
These "men of science" are mesmerized by Eleanor's style,
both warm and immediate. She has disarmed them with her lack
of pretension.
ON FRANKLIN and ELEANOR
Their two separate journeys intersecting -- lightning in a
bottle.
111

There is a receiving line in place to get a last word or an
autograph with Franklin and Eleanor. DR. WILLIS,
bespectacled, speaks with them.
DR. WILLIS
I saw you speak at the Legion Hall
in Cleveland last Spring.
ELEANOR
For the League of Women Voters?
DR. WILLIS
You created quite a stir. Not sure
you'll be asked back.
Franklin is ready to intervene but Eleanor puts her hand on
E
his shoulder stopping him.
LEANOR
(all smiles)
Well, I believe you must say what
you feel in your heart -- what you
feel is right, for you'll be
criticized anyway. Damned if you do
-- damned if you don't.
DR. HEBERT, military in bearing -- the doctor who listened so
intensely -- steps up in line and shakes hands with Eleanor
and then Franklin.
DR. HEBERT
Dr. Peter Hebert. I've been doing
my own studies in this area.
(MORE)
88.
DR. HEBERT(cont'd)
If it is possible I'd like to come
and make an evaluation for the
Journal of Orthopedic Medicine.
Franklin looks to Eleanor, elated.
FRANKLIN
The sooner the better.
114

A beaming Eleanor sits down next to Louis. He too is looking
very pleased. Eleanor takes notice.
ELEANOR
Why do I get the feeling we're not
smiling about the same thing?
The train begins pulling out.
They both look out at Franklin. Locals are coming up to his
car surrounding him -- he is a magnet.
LOUIS
He's ready.

Louis is seated in the front row of the balcony of the State
Assembly, his feet up on the railing, eating pistachio nuts.
Also seated are two politicos, JAMES HASTINGS and STEPHEN
TELLER.
HASTINGS
You can't kiss babies from a
wheelchair. It'll scare their
mothers half to death.
TELLER
Al Smith's got a lock on the
presidential nomination.
LOUIS
Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't
you think even after all these
years that old Al's still a little
rough around the edges?
They laugh knowing this is a huge understatement.
LOUIS
Franklin can help soften his image.
HASTINGS
How?
LOUIS
Let him put Smith's name in
nomination.
Teller and Hastings are none to sure.
TELLER
Well, he is a helluva speech maker.
HASTINGS
Yeah, but is your man up to it?
LOUIS
It's in the bag, guys. Count on it.
Bluffing is one of Louis's strong suits and it looks like
they're buying it.
Just then, Louis notices a familiar face down on the floor.

Hey, Stansbury, give my best to the

A line stretches outside with patients waiting to be seen.
Among them is Franklin, chatting with everyone else,
expecting and receiving no priority attention.

Dr. Hebert is examining Daisy. Helena is by his side, filling
him in on her case history.

Helena, dressed in a robe, walks the halls of the Inn.
Something is amiss.

Franklin is on the phone. Roy stands by his side.
FRANKLIN
Hello, Souders. How are you?...
Couldn't be better. I was wondering
if you'd found a buyer for my naval
prints?
(clearly not)
I see. Well, they're in marvelous
condition... All right, Souders. Oh
one more thing... I have some
beautiful pieces of my
Grandfather's -- T'ang Dynasty...
Really?... An auction in the Fall?
That sounds promising. I'll be in
touch.
Franklin hangs up and sits deep in thought. He rubs his
perspiring forehead with the back of his hand. He looks down
at his hand and sees that it is shaking.

Helena entering the cottage.
HELENA
It's not as bad as you think.
Franklin slams the door behind her and wheels over to the
table. He throws back a drink -- clearly not his first.
FRANKLIN
Read it. Out loud. Page twenty-nine.
HELENA
I already...
FRANKLIN
(angrily)
Read it!
HELENA
"Of the twenty three patients examined
only one, a forty-four year old male,
showed little visible signs of
improvement..." This is one doctor's
opinion, Franklin.

FRANKLIN
Keep reading.
HELENA
"There is marked falling away of
the muscle masses on either side of
the spine in the lower lumbar
region. His lower extremities
present a most depressing picture."
She brings the pages down, but Franklin gestures her to
continue.
HELENA
"I feel after studying him that the
psychological factor in his
management is paramount. He has
such courage and ambition. Yet at
the same time he is such an
extraordinarily sensitive emotional
mechanism...
It is difficult for her to continue.
FRANKLIN
Please.
HELENA
... that it will take all the skill
which we can muster to lead him
successfully to a recognition of
his severe physical limitations
without crushing him."
FRANKLIN
Patronizing son-of-a-bitch! I
wanted to walk again.
HELENA
And you still might. This report
legitimizes we've worked so hard
for. We can raise funs now. It
could change everything!
FRANKLIN
It won't change anything for me.
HELENA
Franklin, I won't play this game. I
won't feel sorry for you.
e reaches for the bottle, but Helena grabs on to it,
stopping him.
95.
HELENA
I met a boy today, ten years old.
He's paralyzed from the waist down.
Why don't you go regale him with
vivid tales about your trips to
Europe and playing football at
school. Tell him how you courted
your wife and fathered children.
Tell him of a life he can only
dream of.

I can't help you out of a hole if I
climb in with you. Then we're both
stuck.
Fred, wearing a bow tie and an oversized jacket, is proudly
polishing off a desktop sign that reads: "FRED BOTTS:
DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS."
Helena is behind him reading a file.
LIONEL
(entering)
Here's another one he's refusin'.
He throws a telegram onto an already large stack.
HELENA
Why don't you read it?
LIONEL
Don't like telegrams. All them
STOPS and stuff.
HELENA
Make you dizzy, Lionel.
LIONEL
A little bit.
Fred eyes the telegram, then impulsively grabs it, ripping it
open.
FRED
"Would be honored if you place my
name in nomination for President.
STOP. The party needs you. STOP.
Yours sincerely, Al Smith."
LIONEL
Who's he?

HELENA

handing it to Lionel)
Why don't you slide it under
his door?
LIONEL
All right. Probably slide it
right back.
Lionel leaves. Fred and Helena are silent for a moment.
FRED
He won't go. He doesn't want to be
seen walking on crutches or being
wheeled to the podium.
HELENA
The millions listening on radio
won't be able to see that.
FRED
But all the people at the
convention will.
Helena nods, "That's right."

Responding to a knock at the door, Roy gets up from sitting
on the couch with Franklin, sullen and inattentive.
H
e opens the door to Louis who walks right in.
ROY
Good afternoon, Mr. Howe.
LOUIS
Hello, Roy.
Roy takes his hat and coat and exits to the bedroom.
LOUIS
I can't believe you've made me come
all the way back to this hell hole!
FRANKLIN
I've done no such thing.

LOUIS
I'm here to take you to Houston.
You started your speech yet?
FRANKLIN
I'm not going.
He stares at Franklin, drinking. Shaking his head, he goes
over to the sidebar and pours one for himself.
LOUIS
You know what this is, don't you?
It's a golden opportunity. A
springboard for you to run for
Governor.
ranklin is silent. Frustrated, Louis takes a seat in
Franklin's empty wheelchair.
LOUIS
Ever hear of a Civil War General
named Francis Nicholls?
FRANKLIN
No.
LOUIS
Well, I never heard of him either.
But this was one brave son-of-a-
bitch. Fought for the Confederacy
and lost his left arm in one battle
and his left foot in another. Then
after the war he ran and won the
Governorship of Louisiana -- twice!
FRANKLIN
He was a war hero.
LOUIS
(with emphasis)
Twice.
(a beat)
Look, I've worked like a dog to
keep your name in play, grovelling
at the feet of the powers-that-be
in back rooms.
FRANKLIN
As much for you as for me.

LOUIS
I'll be damned if I'm going to let
you pass up a chance like this.
It's time -- and you're ready.

ELEANOR
Roy, so good to see you.
ROY
Very good to see you, Mrs.
Roosevelt.
She approaches a surprised Franklin. Leaning in, she runs a
hand across his stubbly beard. He looks up at her.
ELEANOR
You're a mess.
FRANKLIN
The report. I'll never...
She sits by his side and Franklin begins to cry. His sobs
grow louder connecting to the despair deep inside him. It
unleashes an avalanche of grief.
ELEANOR
Oh my darling...
FRANKLIN
I'm useless, Eleanor. I feel so
useless.
ELEANOR
That's not true. No one can make
you feel inferior without your
consent.
Finally, his sobs subside.

ELEANOR
You have done a brilliant thing
here -- a magnificent thing.
Eleanor picks up the E
doctor's report and puts it in the fire.
LEANOR
Let's get you in the water.
Eleanor is packing Franklin's suitcase while Franklin,
sitting up in bed dressed in pajamas, works on his speech.
FRANKLIN
(reading aloud)
And so America must find...
(
reconsidering)
No, America needs a pathfinder...
Louis, pacing in shirtsleeves, nods approvingly.
LOUIS
That's good.
FRANKLIN
To emblaze the trail along a high
road that will avoid... avoid the
bottomless morass...
Discouraged, Franklin pushes aside the pages.
104.
LOUIS
What is it? What's wrong?
FRANKLIN
What if I fall... trying to get to
the podium.
LOUIS
If you fall, you show them how to
get up.
FRANKLIN
No, if I fall in front of thousands
of people I lose everything but
their pity.
(a beat)
They'll be writing my obituary
before I get up off the floor.
LOUIS
Elliot won't let you fall, he'll be
there. All the arrangements have
been made, boss. It'll be fine.
FRANKLIN
Who are we fooling? This will never
work. They'll never let me back
into politics. They'll never see
past my legs.
ELEANOR
My darling, they'll never see past
your legs unless you do.

Dark and deserted Roy is carrying Franklin down a flight of
stairs. Louis is hastily checking over his shoulder. If
possible, Eleanor appears even more nervous than Louis.
FRANKLIN
You're being superstitious, Louis.
There aren't any reporters here.
Suddenly out of the darkness a FLASHBULB POPS revealing a
dozen or more REPORTERS staring incomprehensibly at the sight
of a six foot, 200 lb. man being carried like a baby in the
arms of a black man.
No one does or says a thing. The PHOTOGRAPHER who had the
wherewithal to snap the one picture raises his camera to take
another.
But DAN REED, a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune and
a gentle giant at over six foot-four, reaches out and places
a massive hand over the lens.
Slowly, but firmly, he pulls the camera down.
REED
(
quietly)
No.
107.
Louis and Eleanor stand stock still, tense, watching the
scene unfold
Roy is sweating; his arms growing weak. Elliot brings the
chair around and Roy gently lowers Franklin into it.
It's a measure of Reed's standing with this group that his
authority is unquestioned.
But the Photographer raises his camera again. Only now Reed
isn't as kind. He grabs the camera from him and opens the
back, pulling out the film and exposing it.
PHOTOGRAPHER
Hey!
REED
(tipping his hat)
Good to see you, Mr. Roosevelt.
FRANKLIN
Thank you.

The enormous arena is empty but for some maintenance WORKERS
and JANITORS. Louis enters and makes his way to the stage.
He approaches dead center and stands behind the podium looking
out. GRIPPING the podium hard he ROCKS it back and forth.
Taking no chances, he pulls a hammer out from the rear of his
waistband and a bunch of nails from his coat pocket.
Looking around to see if anyone is paying any attention to
him he quickly ducks down behind the podium.
The sound of HAMMERING fills the hall as Louis, on his knees,
NAILS the podium to the floor.

Twenty thousand CONVENTIONEERS are roasting in the hall. It
is Houston in the summer and it's broiling hot. A sea of hand-
held red, white and blue fans are being waved all at once --
most bearing the words "SMITH FOR PRESIDENT."
Near the stage is a long table where the new breed of RADIO
REPORTERS are seated, each in front of a primitive looking
microphone.

Hovering in a group off to the side are Dan Reed and the
REPORTERS from the previous night.

Franklin is standing ramrod straight holding onto Elliot's
arm. He looks handsome in a navy pin-striped suit. As
everyone else is sweating no one notices that Franklin is
perspiring more than F
most.
RANKLIN
Where is she seated?
Louis, a human train wreck himself, reaches over to mop
Franklin's brow with a handkerchief.
LOUIS
In a box stage left. Give me your
hand.
Franklin takes his hand off his cane. It's soaking wet. Louis
wipes it, gently.
FRANKLIN
Louis, what the hell am I doing?
LOUIS
Putting your big toe in the water.
Just then, a VOICE booms out from the loudspeakers:
LOUDSPEAKER (V.O.)
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like
to introduce to you a man who as
Assistant Secretary of the Navy
served our country with distinction.
member of an illustrious family
of long-standing political
commitment to our great nation...
Ladies and gentlemen: Franklin
Delano Roosevelt!
Franklin turns to Elliot and they both take deep breaths.
FRANKLIN
(to Elliot)
Let's go.
The curtains part and they begin moving forward.
109.
137
A BLINDING SPOTLIGHT picks up Franklin and Elliot. The
SPOTLIGHT follows them as they make their way to the podium.
Franklin is hitching each leg forward, slowly. The tip of his
cane hits the floor with pinpoint accuracy for balance and
support.
He leans heavily on Elliot's arm. The walk appears effortless.
He chats with Elliot the whole way, still managing to flash
the CONVENTIONEERS his million dollar smile. But the walk is
slow and the ovation is beginning to fade.

Franklin and Elliot are still ten steps away from the podium.
Sensing the crowd noise weakening, he whispers to Elliot.
FRANKLIN
Laugh as if I'm making a joke.
Elliot throws back his head and laughs. The crowd, wanting to
be in on it, rise as one in a sustained CHEER!
But a puddle of sweat caused by the dripping perspiration
from Franklin's hands is causing the tip of his cane to slip.
Elliot, ever aware, grips him tighter, averting disaster and
finally they reach the podium.
Franklin grabs one side of the podium while Elliot, with a
sleight of hand Houdini would admire, LOCKS his father's
braces, whisks the cane away, pulls his father's speech from
his breast pocket and lays it smoothly on the podium.
THE VIEW FROM BEHIND displays how Franklin's legs are spread
wide for stability as he clutches the podium. He holds on
tightly, as if the wood might snap from his grip.
FROM OUT FRONT the crowd sees only a powerful man standing
tall amidst the flashbulbs POPPING.

Franklin has made it. He is home.

All the denizens of Warm Springs are crowded around the radio.
RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Here on the stage is Franklin
Roosevelt... a figure tall and
proud even in suffering; a face of
classic profile; a frame nervous
and yet self-controlled. A man
softened, cleansed and illumined
with pain.

GOVERNOR AL SMITH, 51, is seated by a radio, surrounded by
CRONIES. An overblown Irishman with gold capped teeth and
heavy New York accent. He chomps on a lit cigar that never
leaves the side of his mouth.
CRONY #1
Hell of an ovation, Al. Couldn't
have asked for anything more.
Smith sits silently puffing on his cigar.
CRONY #2
You may have to be careful though.
Looks like you're raising up a rival.
SMITH

Mark my words. He'll be dead in a year.

Eleanor applauds Franklin as a REPORTER leans in.

Yes, I do. I certainly do.
