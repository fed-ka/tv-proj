NUMBER 55
DAY
KIRSTY arrives at the head of the drive.
The two
men are drinking beers.
The bed has not been moved.
She wanders down the drive towards the house.
26
DOORSTEP
DAY
2ND MAN
(seeing Kirsty)
It's my lucky day.
KIRSTY
Hi.
2ND MAN
Want to buy a bed?
KIRSTY
Not much.
She moves past them, attempting to insinuate herself
between the bed and the door-jamb.
They watch,
enjoying her efforts.
27
TUBE STATION
NIGHT
The station is deserted, but for KIRSTY and STEVE,
who are sitting, waiting for the last train.
KIRSTY
You know I do know the way home.
STEVE
It's late.
KIRSTY
Not that late.
STEVE
Please.
I want to see you
home.
All right?
KIRSTY
(lightly)
All right.
(smiles)
No.
That's nice.
STEVE
If there's a train.
KIRSTY
What do we do if there isn't?
STEVE
We walk.
61
A PEDESTRIAN TUNNEL, NEAR WATERLOO
NIGHT
KIRSTY and STEVE are walking.
STEVE
Why don't you stay at Larry's
house?
There's plenty of room.
KIRSTY
Yeah, there's room.
And
there's Julia.
STEVE
I see.
KIRSTY
She's so damn ... English.
STEVE
Meaning what?
KIRSTY
Oh, I don't know.
Up-tight.
Frigid.
STEVE stops walking.
STEVE
I beg your pardon?
KIRSTY
(lightly)
There ya go.
(imitates his tone)
I beg your pardon?
STEVE
We're not all frigid.
KIRSTY has turned to look at him.
Both of them are
aware where the banter is leading; smiles play on
their faces as they speak.
KIRSTY
Oh no?
STEVE
Oh no.
KIRSTY
It's not what I heard.
STEVE
(moves closer to
her)
Well you've just been talking
to the wrong people.
He kisses her, with considerable feeling.
62
NUMBER 55
DAY
The door opens.
JULIA steps out of the house, and
starts towards the street.
As she does so,
she glances round.
65
WINDOW OF TORTURE ROOM

We approach the window, knowing that FRANK watches
behind it.
66
NUMBER 55
DAY
JULIA heads off down the street.
67
DOORSTEP
DAY
JULIA opens the front door.
She is still very nervous,
fumbling with the keys.
PRUDHOE stands a pace behind her.
71
LODOVICO STREET - DAY
A wind blows, carrying autumn leaves before it.
And
on the wind, the distant pealing of bells.
112
DOORSTEP OF NUMBER 55
DAY
JULIA is at the door, turning the key in the lock.
Beside her, a third sacrificial lamb, balding and
excitable.
His name is SYKES.
JULIA opens the door.
113
LODOVICO STREET
DAY
At the corner of the street now:
KIRSTY.
She watches,
puzzled.
114
DOORSTEP OF NUMBER 55
DAY
A long shot of the house, from KIRSTY'S P.O.V.
The
man on the step seems to having second thoughts.
JULIA speaks with him.
We can hear none of this
exchange, but JULIA manages to coax him inside.
She
closes the door behind them.
115
LODOVICO STREET
DAY
KIRSTY stands, bewildered by what she's seen.

118

back from the doorstep and looks up at the house.
122
HOUSE
DAY
KIRSTY makes her way around the back of the house.
124
NUMBER 55
DAY
As she stumbles away down the path, she sees the box
at her feet, in a litter of broken glass.
She picks
it up, and continues to run.
139
LODOVICO STREET
DAY
A series of shots from KIRSTY'S P.O.V., as she staggers
along the street.
The sound-track whines; the image
threatens to be eclipsed by darkness.
People stare
at her as she runs.
A child points.
Finally, the CAMERA slows.
She stands still.
A voice, off camera:
VOICE (O.S.)
Are you all right?
The CAMERA swings giddily around in the direction of
the speaker.
A WOMAN comes into view.
WOMAN
Do you need any help?
As she speaks, the picture fades to white.
140
KIRSTY'S DREAM
(PART TWO)
The whiteness continues to fill the screen.
Distant,
incoherent voices are heard, and the thump of blood
in the inner ear.
Then darkness seeps into the whiteness, patterns like
Rorschach inkblots: ambiguous, yet interpretable as
sexual or horrific imagery.
With the darkness,
soaking over the scene like blood through the sheet
in her first dream, fragments of FRANK's previous
dialogue.
FRANK
Come to Daddy.
KIRSTY
This isn't happening.
FRANK
Some things have to be endured ...
The darkness is filling the screen
... take it from me ...
Now, total darkness.
... Come to Daddy ...
And suddenly, she wakes.
141
NUMBER 55
NIGHT
The front door closes.
LARRY
(inside)
Julia?
145
NUMBER 55
NIGHT
Lights burn in the house, upstairs and down.
152
STREET
NIGHT
As his car drives past, KIRSTY turns a corner.
He does
not see her.
KIRSTY hurries along the street.
The
wind is chilly.
Sometimes she hears a bell in it.
155
LODOVICO STREET
NIGHT
STEVE drives up to the house.
The lights are still
burning.
He gets out of the car, and hurries down the
path.
156
DOORSTEP
NIGHT
He knocks on the door.
There's no reply.
157
DOORSTEP
NIGHT
STEVE starts round the back of the house.
159
LODOVICO STREET
NIGHT
KIRSTY turns the corner of the street, and starts down
it.
The wind is strong now.
It is full of sibilant
whispers, hurrying her along.
161
DOORSTEP
NIGHT
KIRSTY reaches the doorstep.
As she does so the whispers
die away completely.
She beats on the door.
No reply.
She beats again, more urgently.
KIRSTY
Please!
Dad!
It's me!
It's Kirsty!
163
DOORSTEP
NIGHT
KIRSTY still beats on the door.
KIRSTY
Please, answer me!
Please -
The door is suddenly opened.
JULIA is standing there.
JULIA
Kirsty?
It's very late.
KIRSTY
Where's Daddy?
JULIA
What's the problem?
KIRSTY
(stepping inside)
I have to see my father.
JULIA
Of course.
There's no need to
shout.
165
DOORSTEP
NIGHT
The door slams behind them, of its own accord.
KIRSTY turns the sealed box over in her hand.
There is a slit in it which has not quite closed.
Light
suddenly pours from it, up into KIRSTY's face.
Her
features are momentarily distorted, as if sucked towards
the box.
From within:
shrieks, bells, music.
Between the screams, FRANK's voice.
FRANK
Come to Daddy!
She slams the panel shut.
The distortions cease. So
does the din.
KIRSTY
(quietly)
Not tonight.
A smile crosses her face, and she leaves the doorstep,
making her way towards the street.
STEVE gazes at her,
then follows.
Their figures are erased by the darkness.
Somewhere, a bell rings as ...
