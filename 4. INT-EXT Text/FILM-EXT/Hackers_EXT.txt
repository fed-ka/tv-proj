DAY.
Slow motion. Armed troops in black uniforms pour out of
unmarked vans and swarm across a lawn in a middle class
residential neighborhood. Yuppie neighbours look on in
shock, confused. Two of the troops carry a battering ram
to the front door of a white two-storey house. A leashed
Rottweiler snarls and barks. In position, their comrades
point M-16s into first-floor windows, ready to be
ambushed. Pan into a window in the kitchen. An
attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast.
Now, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the
front door. The woman, startled, drops her spatula.
We enjoy several views of New York, the morning sun
shining between skyscrapers, neon signs that stay lit day
and night. Dade emerges from the ground-floor apartment
on rollerblades and skates down the street to school.
Dade enters, and lets the door slam behind him. Across the
roof, a dozen or so geeky looking kids are looking over
the edge, apparently trying to get someone's attention.
One of them notices Dade.
GEEK
Hey! Hold the door!
He's too late. The geeks look pretty angry. There is no pool.
Dade
(realizing he's been had)
No pool.
Dade tries the door but it's locked. He hammers it with
his palm, furious. Above, thunder roars and it begins
raining.
It's after school, kids are heading home, Dade too. The
latino kid notices Dade and catches up with him.
KID
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby,
eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
DADE
Homicidal?
KID
What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!
The name rings no bells with Dade.
PHREAK
The Phantom Phreak? The king of Nynex? I
know you play the game.
Another kid, younger and a little geeky looking, runs up
to Dade and The Phantom Phreak.
JOEY
Phreakphreakphreakphreakphreak,
dudedudedudedudedudedude... I gotta...
PHREAK
(slaps Joey)
Joey, Joey...
JOEY
What? whatwhatwhat?
PHREAK
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap
the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to
save you from yourself but you gotta stop
letting your mama dress you, man!
(To Dade):
Check it...
Phreak starts to hand Dade a flyer.
JOEY
(interrupting)
I need a handle, man. I don't have an
identity until I have a handle.
PHREAK
You know, you're right about that.
(to Dade)
Check it, Friday.
Phreak hands Dade a flyer for Cyberdelia.
JOEY
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster,
huh?
PHREAK
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
Phreak walks away.
JOEY
Ultra Laser.
(desperate)
Doctor Doom!
Dade rolls in on rollerblades.
Street vendors hawk
computer parts and bootleg software. A bootleg music
vendor catches Dade's attention.
CEREAL
Check this out, each and every one of you.
Compilation tape, of my own making. I call
this the "Greatest Zooks Album". Featuring
artists like, well I got some Hendrix on
there, some Joplin, Mama Cass, Belushi... all
great artists that asphyxiated on their own
vomit!
The small crowd around him finally gets the joke.
CEREAL
Can't get this in stores, man, I made it!
Dade wheels into Cyberdelia, which just happens to be
equipped with a ramp down to its main floor for the
benefit of skaters. The place pounds with loud, bassy
techno music and coloured light. Video monitors with
psychedelic patterns complete the atmopshere. There is a
video game with a huge screen.
Phreak is at a pay phone.
OPERATOR
(on phone)
Please deposit five dollars for the first
minute.
Phreak holds a small box up to the receiver, presses a
button, and the box emits a series of tones.
OPERATOR
Thank you.
PHREAK
Nonono, thank YOU!
Dade checks out the scene. Kate is playing the big video
game. Dade skates up to her. She loses her last man.
She's got the high score, in fact her name dominates the
top-10 list.
DADE
That's a nice score for a girl.
KATE
(irritated by Dade's presence)
Think you can do better?
DADE
I'll give it a shot.
Kate yields the controls to Dade, who begins playing.
Kate's boyfriend looks on from a mezzanine several feet
above.
CURTIS
Is this kid bothering you, Kate?
DADE
Sorry, can I get some room here?
CURTIS
Yeah.
(to Kate)
Why don't you come up here?
Kate obliges and joins Curtis.
Dade continues playing.
He plays brilliantly. The game is a flashy 3-D high-speed
chase game with lots of surprises. Dade loses, but his
high score is about to come up.
CURTIS
He's good!
Dade's score comes up. He's in the #1 position. Phreak
is amazed.
DADE
(to Kate)
Well, it looks like I'm on top.
Kate, defeated, leaves. Curtis follows.
PHREAK
Congratulations. No one's ever beat her
before. You just made an enemy for life.
(to someone else)
Boy meets world. Let's go?
Kate and Curtis are sucking face, oblivious to the busy
world around them. Dade and Phreak watch, more than a
little disgusted.
DADE
Who's that?
PHREAK
Curtis.
DADE
And what's he do?
PHREAK
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks
slick all day.
Kate and Curtis start to take off on Curtis' motorcycle.
Kate and Dade make eye contact briefly. The motorcycle
speeds off into the night.
A police-type vehicle pulls up. It's Agent Richard Gill
of the Secret Service.
He stops a young agent for an
update.
GILL
How's it going, Ray?
AGENT RAY
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted
hard drive.
GILL
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years
protecting the president so I could finish my
career feeling like an idiot.
AGENT RAY
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so
we don't think he had time to erase his
computer files.
GILL
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up
here, and take him in for interrogation.
AGENT RAY
Alright sir.
They split up.
A reporter and her sound man run up to
Gill.
REPORTER
Agent Gill, can you spare a moment of your
time?
GILL
Why of course, Jennifer.
While Jennifer conducts the interview, agents lead Joey
into an unmarked car. His mother is behind him, still
hysterical.
JOEY'S MOM
Joey!
JOEY
Mom...
JENNIFER
Just how dangerous are hackers?
GILL
Well, hackers penetrate and ravage delicate
public and privately owned computer systems,
infecting them with viruses...
JOEY'S MOM
Joey!
GILL
...and stealing sensitive materials for their
own ends. These people, they're terrorists...
JOEY'S MOM
Joey!
Joey's apartment building is an L-shaped skyscraper about
30 storeys high, unimpressive by New York City standards.
Two Secret Service agents are staking Joey out in a car
outside.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT BOB
Unit 3 outside suspect Joey Pardella's
apartment. Nothing to report. Suspect still
grounded... by his mother.
His radio crackles.
AGENT BOB
Listen to this bullshit.
(he reads)
"This is our world now. The world of the
electron and the switch, the beauty of the
baud. We exist without nationality, skin
color, or religious bias. You wage wars,
murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us
believe it's for our own good, yet we're the
criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is
that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is
my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You
may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
AGENT RAY
Now that's cool.
AGENT BOB
Cool?
AGENT RAY
Yeah, cool.
AGENT BOB
You think it's cool?
AGENT RAY
(not caring for where Bob is going
with this)
It's cool!
AGENT BOB
It's not cool. It's commie bullshit!
At a public phone, Kate hacks into Concourse Bank, looks
up Richard Gill, and has his credit card maxed out.
"Destroy Card" is the final instruction. The other
hackers look on.
Dade hacks into an electronic personal ads system and
changes an ad.
KATE
Alright, he's in the personal ads.
(reading Dade's ad)
"Disappointed white male, crossdresser, looking
for discreet friend to bring dreams to
reality. Leather, lace, and water sports.
Transvestites welcome."
It's Kate's turn. Kate is hacking into the Department of
Motor Vehicles. She adds 113 traffic violations and DUI
offender status to Gill's record.
Gill is being arrested quite forcefully by a NYC police
grunt.
He is thrown onto the hood of his car and
handcuffed.
GILL
Hey! Hey, ow! Do you know who I am? Do you
know who I am?
Dade's turn. He hacks into the Secret Service's personnel
file, and changes Gill's status to "Deceased."
Joey is nervously waiting on a park bench. Phreak arrives.
Agents Ray and Bob still have Joey staked out.
PHREAK
Yo, what's up?
JOEY
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute,
listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file
from...
PHREAK
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it,
Joey, come on.
JOEY
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
PHREAK
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data.
Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
JOEY
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're
asking me about it, alright? Will you take a
look for me?
Joey hands Phreak the disc. Agent Bob is taking pictures,
and Phreak notices.
PHREAK
Oh shit, Joey, you've got a tail.
Joey sees, and runs for it.
JOEY
Shit!
The agents split up, one runs after Joey, the other after
Phreak.
Shortly after, Dade is outside on a payphone.
PLAGUE
Talk to me.
DADE
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's
on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it
out. She's not the one who planted the virus.
You leave her alone.
PLAGUE
Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent,
she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
Dade hangs up and waits for some time.
A limousine drives
by, with a skateboarder tailing. Plague grabs the disc,
jumps in the limo and speeds away. Dade tries to chase
but gives up quickly.
Dade and Kate cut through a chain link fence and jump into
a dumpster at Ellingson. Kate lands on Dade.
DADE
You know, if I didn't live by a strict code of
honor, I might take advantage of this
situation.
Erotically, as it were.
Kate fishes around in her pants, never breaking eye
contact with Dade. She pulls out a flashlight. They
start trashing. They get up to leave and are spotted by a
security guard.
GUARD
Alright, hold it right there!
Kate pulls out a flare gun and fires it at the security
guard.
He ducks.
DADE
Shit!!
KATE
It's my subway defense system.
Nikon is staring down a manhole, Cereal is fishing through
an adjacent phone company truck.
NIKON
He's way down there.
Cereal emerges with a beltload of equipment and a hard hat.
But he forgot the most important thing.
CEREAL
Ta-da!
NIKON
Yo, brain dead, the manual!
Cereal goes back to the truck and gets a thick manual. The
phone company technician comes up from the manhole.
PHONE COMPANY TECH
Hey!
CEREAL AND NIKON
(in unison, pointing down the street)
TRUCK!!!
The phone company tech jumps back in the hole, Cereal and
Nikon take off.
As the virus speaks, a supertanker sails on a choppy sea.
Nikon is playing chess against two Hassidic Jews.
Cereal's beeper goes off. It displays the message:
GRAND CENTRAL
HACK THE PLANET
CEREAL
Yo. I'm blowing up. It's Kate, Grand
Central. Let's hit it!
Nikon checkmates his opponent and the two leave.
Dade, Cereal, Nikon, and Kate skate through the streets.
Dade's program to freeze all the traffic lights on green,
runs on schedule at 9:00:00 precisely. Picture New York City in
morning rush hour, and every traffic light is green. Instant
gridlock ensues. The four skate through the traffic easily, while
the Secret Service, now pursuing them, is stuck. Gill punches a
parked car in frustration. Its alarm goes off.
The Secret Service and NYPD are stuck.
They turn around
and head for Grand Central Station.
Outside, he notices Cereal, who wasn't present to be
arrested. He yells to the crowd, but really is
addressing Cereal.
DADE
They're TRASHING our rights, man! They're
TRASHING the flow of data! They're TRASHING!
TRASHING! TRASHING! HACK THE PLANET! HACK
THE PLANET!
GILL
Shut up and get in the car!
CEREAL
(understanding the hidden message)
HACK THE PLANET! HACK THE PLANET!
Dade and Kate are on their date. Dade is smartly,
somewhat androgynously dressed. Kate is heavily made up,
and yes, she is wearing a dress.
DADE
You look good in a dress.
KATE
You would have looked better.
DADE
Wanna go for a swim?
Dade and Kate swimming, fully clothed, in a pool on a
roof.
KATE
I can't believe they decided you won.
DADE
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only
way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty
good. You're elite.
KATE
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in
the beginning, you would have saved yourself
a whole lot of trouble.
They look out at the skyline. Suddenly, the lights in
three buildings change. They spell out:
C
B
R
A
U
A
N
R
S
D
N
H
Kate laughs, honestly impressed.
DADE
Beat that!
Kate continues laughing.
DADE
You know, I've been having these really
weird..
KATE
(finishing his sentence)
Dreams?
They kiss passionately.
