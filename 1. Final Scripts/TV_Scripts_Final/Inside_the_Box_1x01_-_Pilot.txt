1INT. NNC WASHINGTON BUREAU HALLWAY -- DAY1

      The hallways of NNC Washington Bureau are bustling.  Reporters
      and producers and PAs are trying to keep up with a busy news
      day. The walls are lined with photos of NNC correspondents
      meeting the powerful, or covering important events of the
      last 25 years.  Tianamen, Clinton, 9/11, etc.  

      Walking swiftly down the hall is CATHERINE POWELL (30's). 
      She's the teacher's pet who grew up to be a knockout.  She's
      fast talking, whip smart, and wound a little too tight for
      her own good. She exudes confidence, often at the expense of
      warmth.  She is both beloved and feared in this place. As
      always, she's got her coffee in one hand and her Blackberry
      in the other.  A PRODUCER pulls alongside.

                                      PRODUCER 
                      Catherine, we've got no one to cover
                    the presser at State today. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    We'll talk about it in the huddle. 

      ANOTHER PRODUCER pulls up. 

                                      OTHER PRODUCER
                    New York wants to know if we'll have
                    anything today on Justice Fanning's
                      resignation.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Which is why we have a huddle, so
                    that we can tell New York what we
                    have for the day.  Today we're doing
                    it by the book.  Letter perfect. 
                    Flawless.  Got it?

                                      OTHER PRODCUER
                    But I need-

                                      CATHERINE
                    Your needs are for you and your
                    therapist to discuss.  The huddle is
                    in five so until then don't bother
                    me.  And tell Jake-

                                    JAKE
                    -Tell Jake what?               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            2.

      JAKE FISHER (30's) appears.  He is her antithesis and her
      right hand.  Relaxed and easygoing.  Beyond Jake's good looks,
      he's got that something that women seem to fall for hard.  A
      twinkle in his eye, a great sense of humor, an easy laugh...
      charisma.  They have a long history, and some palpable
      chemistry. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Hey.  I'm counting on you to make
                    sure Kyle gets his stand-up done early. 
                    I made it through the inauguration
                    without a hitch.  I've just got to
                    keep it flawless a few more days.  No
                    hiccups, ok?

                                    JAKE
                    Wait, are you finally getting Fred's
                    job?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Stop.  I'm not jinxing this.  Just
                    get me Kyle's piece before the
                    afternoon call.

                                    JAKE
                    I don't think we'll have it by then. 
                    He rewrites a lot. 

      As Catherine pulls farther ahead Jake can't help glance down
      at her legs.  She's got great legs.  As he glances up they
      have arrived at "the Pit."

2INT. THE PIT -- CONTINUOUS2

      The Pit, as it is lovingly known, is the nerve center of the
      operation.  It's visual eye candy with glass walled offices
      circling a large cluster of desks.  It's always bustling and
      pulsing with energy.  At any time there are at least half a
      dozen DAs (Desk Assistants) and PAs (Production Assistants). 
      Producers crossing, talking on the phone, writing, watching
      tape, and drinking a lot of coffee.  There are 20 TVs on. 
      Clocks read the time in London, Mecca, Hong Kong, etc.  When
      Catherine enters this room, everyone sits up straighter. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    It's a two minute spot on the
                      President's first day in office.  If
                    he has to rewrite that, it's going to
                    be a very long four years.

                                    JAKE
                    It's Kyle's first day up there.  Cut
                    the guy some slack.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            3.

                                      CATHERINE
                    If Kyle wanted slack he should have
                    been a weather girl.  He beat out a
                    lot of great reporters to get to the
                    White House.  Now he's got to deliver.

3EXT. WASHINGTON STREET -- DAY3

      KYLE CHISOLM is running.  Down 16th Street, his breath puffing
      small clouds into the winter air as he goes.  A tall, handsome
      black man (30s)in a nice suit running toward the White House. 
      Wingtips leaping slush puddles.  Gracefully dodging traffic. 
      In spite of the hurry, he can't help checking out his
      reflection as he passes a store window.  Involuntary vanity. 
      Checks his watch.  Damn.  Late the first day.  Phone rings.

                                    KYLE
                    Hello?  (Pause)  I know.  I'm almost
                    there.  (Pause)  As fast as I can.

4INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM -- DAY4

      This room is smaller, dirtier, and rougher than most people
      would ever imagine when they see it on TV.  For the new crop
      of White House correspondents it's everyone's first day on
      the job.  Most have spent years killing themselves to get
      here, but a few jaded old-timers have been here for years.

      The room quiets as newly minted press secretary LAUREN THOMAS
      (30s) enters.  She tries not to smile partly because she
      doesn't like the way it looks on TV, but also because it
      reminds her of those teen years in beauty pageants.

                                      LAUREN
                    Hello everyone and welcome.  Good to
                    see you all found your way here today. 
                    I'm happy to see so many friendly
                    faces in the audience.

      Lauren surveys the room and does a double take when she sees
      that the seat with "Kyle Chisolm, NNC" taped to it is empty.  

5INT. WHITE HOUSE SECURITY -- DAY5

      Kyle arrives at the White House press entrance. He's through
      the gate as quick as they'll allow.  Credentials in order. 
      Keys, wallet, bag, shoes, Blackberry out on the x-ray belt. 
      Coat off.  Checking the watch.  Shit. Collect yourself.

6INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM -- DAY6

      Kyle, looking calm, makes his way from the back of the room
      while Lauren talks from the podium.  Kyle and Lauren lock
      eyes for a minute and she can't suppress a grin and a little
      blush.  Kyle has a thousand watt smile.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            4.

                                      LAUREN 
                    I hope you all are ready for a lot of
                    hard work.  The President made a lot
                    of promises on the campaign trail,
                    and for once in Washington, we plan
                    on keeping them.

      While Lauren continues to talk, Kyle finally gets to his seat. 
      He draws quite a few stares.  The reporter sitting next to
      him leans over to him and talks to him in a low voice.

                                      REPORTER
                    Maybe it's just the new podium but I
                    swear she gets hotter every day.

                                    KYLE
                    Yeah, I hear podiums are this year's
                    hottest accessory.

                                      LAUREN
                    The president's schedule today-

                                      OTHER REPORTER
                          (shouting)
                    Lauren, has the President spoken to
                    Justice Fanning about-

                                      LAUREN
                    Before any of you start showing off,
                    let me say that no matter how many
                    drinks you bought me on the campaign,
                    this is my room not yours.  Shouting
                    questions while I'm speaking is
                      considered rude.  As for Justice
                    Fanning, the man has been on the
                    Supreme Court for nearly three decades
                    and his career choices are not the
                    concern of this White House as
                      stipulated in a document called the
                    United States Constitution.
                          (staring them down)
                    This afternoon the President will
                    welcome leaders from the Congress...

7INT. NNC CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY7

      Cut to a TV monitor showing Lauren at the podium.  Pull back
      to reveal a wall of monitors in the NNC Conference room.
      Catherine is wrapping up the daily meeting - the huddle. 
      There are twenty five people with their coffee cups, note
      pads, and Blackberrys.  

                                      CATHERINE
                    Terry, please keep in close touch
                    with the Supreme Court today on 
                                      (MORE)              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            5.

                                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    Fanning.  Jeffrey will be keeping an
                    eye on the confirmation hearings-  

      Just then Catherine's eye notices the monitor showing Lauren's
      press conference.

                                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    Hey, turn that up, I want to hear if
                    Vanna White House actually answers
                    any questions now that she's got the
                    fancy podium.

      Someone turns up the volume but only a snippet of Lauren is
      heard before the picture goes dead. 

                                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    Someone find out why we lost our line
                    to the White House. 

      A PA jumps up and exits. 

                                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    That's all the official business-

      A producer interrupts in mock press conference style.

                                      PRODUCER
                      Catherine, is it true that NNC is
                    finally going to make an honest woman
                    out of you, and promote you to
                      Washington Bureau Chief?

                                      CATHERINE
                          (in mock press secretary
                            voice)
                    You know I cannot comment on internal
                    personnel issues, except to say...
                    stay tuned to this station for further
                    news.  But seriously,  New York was
                    very pleased with the inauguration
                    coverage, so you all should feel good. 
                    As a reward, and since the inauguration
                    wrecked our chance to enjoy the ritual
                      humiliation of Jake Fisher on his
                    birthday, I wanted to bring you a
                    special gift.

      Catherine slaps a tape into a deck nearby, and the one big TV
      in the room springs to life.  The image is a recording of a
      terrible local TV broadcast.  Standing with a microphone in
      front of prize livestock at some county fair is vintage 1996
      Jake.  A lot of hair gel, a loud tie, a goofy TV grin.

                                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    Ladies and gentlemen...  Jacob Fisher!              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            6.

      The room goes nuts.  Jake is very red. 

8INT. NNC HALLWAY -- DAY8

      Catherine coming out of the meeting with Jake.

                                    JAKE
                    Where the hell did you find that?

                                      CATHERINE
                    I am actually a journalist you know.

                                    JAKE
                    I thought you were just here to make
                    my life miserable. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    I called your mother. 

                                    JAKE
                    Exactly my point.  So is Fred-

      Catherine puts up a hand to silence him. Jake exits.  Enter
      SAMANTHA HATHAWAY (40's) a blonde knockout who used to be the
      next Diane Sawyer.  She and Catherine are clearly friends.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Hello?  Sam?  We had a meeting.  Just
                    because you didn't get the White House,
                    doesn't mean you don't still have a
                    job to do.

                                    SAM
                    You know I hate meetings.  Besides I
                    lived out of a suitcase for a year
                    covering that campaign, I've earned
                    some unexplained absences?
                          (quieter)
                    Are you really getting Fred's job?

                                      CATHERINE
                    I've been hearing that rumor so long
                    I can't even feign a decent denial. 

                                    SAM
                    I have a good feeling about it this
                    time.  Besides you look great.  Perfect
                    day to get promoted.  Men can't get
                    all the good jobs, right?

                    I'd let them have the jobs if they
                    actually did them.               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            7.

                    But then we might have time to have
                    personal lives, which would be oh so
                      complicated. 

      As Sam exits another producer falls in beside Catherine.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Why today?  Someone's going to have
                    to go over there and get Kyle's tape. 
                    JAKE!!!

9INT. THE PIT -- DAY9

      Catherine crosses towards Jake's office ignoring SEAN, ANGELA,
      PRIYA, and MOLLY (20s) who are all news peons.  Sean is
      watching one of the TVs showing cable news.

                                    SEAN
                    Can you believe this? They're still 
                    pushing that Roopika Kumar story!? 

                                      CABLE TV ANCHOR
                    Do you believe sir, that Roopika
                    Kumar's disappearance may have a
                    cultural dimension because her parents
                    are from India?

                                    TV GUEST
                    I think that is something to consider
                    as the investigation slows down...

                                      PRIYA 
                    Is that a joke?  Not like we have any
                    real news happening - like a new
                    President for instance. 

                                      MOLLY
                    That poor girl's been gone for months. 
                    No leads, no suspects but they're
                    gonna milk another week out of it. 

                                      ANGELA
                    Thank god we don't work in cable.

      Jake and Catherine come out of his office.  Catherine exits.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            8.

                                    JAKE 
                    I need a PA with a car who knows their
                    way to the White House!

      Molly quickly jumps up and comes over before the other PA's
      have even blinked.  She's barely out of college.  A little
      too pretty for the news business, and dressed entirely too
      nicely for her job.  She still thinks everything about this
      job is amazing, and it shows.  If she weren't nervous she'd
      think Jake was cute.

                                      MOLLY
                    I can go.

                                    JAKE
                    Great uh...
                          (searching for a name)

                                      MOLLY
                    Sorry, Molly.

                                    JAKE
                    Molly, right.  I need... wait.  Dressed
                    like that?

                                      MOLLY
                          (a little embarrassed)
                    Oh, sorry, a little overdressed today.

                                    JAKE
                    Lunch with dad? Job interview?  Date?

                                      MOLLY
                    It's nothing.
                          (Jake's silent, not
                            buying it)
                    Just a dinner.

                                    JAKE
                    Lucky guy.  OK, I need you to drive
                    over to the White House.  Go to the
                    16th Street gate and call our desk. 
                    They'll bring you a tape.  I want it
                    in my hand in 30 minutes.  If you
                    decide to speed, don't get stopped.

                                      MOLLY
                    Got it.

      Molly takes off, excited.  As she goes, Jake checks out her
      backside, in spite of himself.

10INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING ROOM -- DAY10

      Kyle stands in front of the camera, trying to look relaxed. 
      It's not working.                ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            9.

      He's got the podium and White House seal behind him.  He's
      done a few takes, but he looks stiff. 

                                    KYLE
                    Let me just do that one more time.  I
                    feel like I'm sounding too chipper. 
                    And I have no idea what I'm supposed
                    to do with my hands.  I liked it better
                    when I could hold a microphone.

                                      CAMERAMAN
                    That was the best yet.  I think we've
                    got it.  We're cutting this close.

                                    KYLE
                    Just one more.

11EXT. WASHINGTON STREET -- DAY11

      Molly stands at the White House gate.  It's cold and she's
      got bare legs and un-sensible shoes.  She's trying to make
      small talk with the guards who couldn't be less interested.

                                      MOLLY
                    Cold huh?
                          (no reply)
                    Pretty cool guarding the White House.

      Molly realizes how goofy she seems.  A producer from NNC comes
      out of the gate and hands her the tape.

12INT. MOLLY'S CAR ON WASHINGTON STREET -- DAY12

      Molly in her Corolla, with the tape peeking out of her purse
      on the passenger seat.  She's talking on the phone, all giddy
      little girl excitement.

                                      MOLLY
                    Yeah, Mom they sent me to the White
                    House.  (Beat)  No I didn't see the
                      President.  (Beat)  No, I didn't even
                    get to go inside.  (Beat)  No, I didn't
                    meet Kyle Chisolm.  (Beat)  Yes, I
                    have a date tonight.  (Getting
                      irritated)  I gotta go mom-

      Molly pulls away from a red light and WHAM!  A BIKE MESSENGER
      slams into the side of Molly's car and flies across the hood. 
      She freezes for a second, then jumps out.  CRACK!  Her cell
      phone shatters on the pavement.  In awkward heels she runs to
      the messenger, and stands over him horrified.  The messenger
      is surprisingly unhurt but Molly is totally freaked. 

                                      MOLLY  (CONT'D)
                    Are you ok?  Oh my God I'm so sorry! 
                    I just didn't see you.  Are you hurt?              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            10.

                                      MESSENGER
                    You better watch yourself princess!

                                      MOLLY
                    Sorry.  Oh, I know.  Gosh I feel so
                    bad.  I'm not from here.  We don't
                    have messengers...

      Molly notices the messenger looking at her car.  She looks
      and sees that her passenger door is open.  She realizes someone
      else is running away, and he's holding her purse.

                                      MOLLY  (CONT'D)
                    Oh my god!  Wait!  STOP!  SOMEONE
                    STOP THAT GUY!!!  The tape!  Please...

13INT. NNC HALLWAY -- DAY13

      Catherine is walking and runs into FRED O'BRIEN, the Washington
      Bureau Chief and her boss.  He hasn't smiled in a decade, but
      everyone - especially Catherine - adores him.  

                                      CATHERINE
                    I was just coming to see you.  The
                    hard line is down again.  We sent
                    someone to get Kyle's tape from the
                    White House so we don't have to buy
                    any extra satellite time. 

                                    FRED
                    Good.  They're really hammering us on
                    the budget.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Don't worry.  We're being frugal. 

                                    FRED
                    Hey, will you come by my office after
                    the show tonight.  I need to talk to
                    you about something. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    No problem.

      As Catherine walks away she has a huge grin on her face. 

14INT. CONTROL ROOM -- DAY14

      Catherine comes into the control room, where Jake and a couple
      of others are working.  She's ebullient.  Jake is nervously
      hanging up the phone and checking his Blackberry. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Where is my tape Fisher?              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            11.

                                    JAKE
                    It'll be here.

      Jake dials the White House.  Catherine dials too.

                                    JAKE  (CONT'D)
                    Hey, it's Jake.  The tape's MIA so- 
                          (pause)
                    I don't know what happened.  Just cue
                    the backup and hold tight.

      Long pause as Jake turns white.  He whispers into the phone.

                                    JAKE  (CONT'D)
                    What do you mean there is no backup?? 
                    (PAUSE)  Well I wasn't in that big a
                    hurry.  (PAUSE)  Are you kidding me??? 
                    That's the stupidest thing I've ever
                    heard. 
                          (whispering but irate)
                    I know Kyle can't go live!!  I'll
                    call you back.

      Jake hangs up the phone.  Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  He tries to
      hide his panic.  Deep breath.

                                    JAKE  (CONT'D)
                    There's no backup.  They didn't make
                    a copy.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Excuse me?

                                    JAKE
                    They were in a hurry.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Who??

                                    JAKE
                    It doesn't matter.

                                      CATHERINE
                    It's going to matter to someone in
                    the morning when I fire them.
                          (shifting gears)
                    Can Kyle go live?

                                    JAKE
                    Kyle's really doesn't like to-

                                      CATHERINE
                    Well if he wants to go on air he'd
                    better be ready to go live.  He can
                    do it as a two way with Paul in the
                    studio.  I'll call New York.

                    Where the hell are you Molly?

15EXT. NNC BUILDING -- EVENING15

      Molly sits in her car parked outside the NNC Washington Bureau,
      sobbing quietly.  Too afraid to get out of the car.  She's
      half rehearsing her speech to Jake in her head, half trying
      to imagine her future after she gets fired.

16INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS WORK SPACE - EVENING16

      Kyle has his feet on the desk, telling a funny but self-serving
      story to another reporter.  His cell phone rings.

                                    KYLE
                    Hey buddy.

      His face drops.  He takes his feet down.  Stands up.  Winces. 
      He's silent but he doubles over like he's been punched.

                                    KYLE  (CONT'D)
                      I understand.  OK.  I'll be ready.

      Kyle checks the clock, grabs his tie and jacket and runs.

17INT. CONTROL ROOM -- EVENING17

      Jake, Catherine, Sam, and others are in the control room. In
      the doorway appears Molly.  She looks like a wreck.  Face
      red.  Jake shoots her a look and a nod to Catherine.  Molly
      understands and walks away without saying anything.  On one
      monitor they can see Kyle standing in his spot ready to go
      live.  He's doing a sound check with New York.

                                    KYLE
                    Yes, New York I hear you loud and
                    clear.  (Nodding)  Yes it's been a
                    little rough, but nothing we can't
                    handle.  (Pause)  Twenty seconds?              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            13.

      Kyle is adjusting his pocket square, straightening his tie. 
      On the TV monitors:

                                    PAUL COLLINS (ANCHOR IN NY)
                    We go now to Kyle Chisolm at the White
                    House for a review of the day's
                    historic events.

                                    KYLE
                    Thank You Paul.  Given all the
                      excitement around the President's
                    first day in office, things went off
                    without a hitch here...

      As Kyle talks, Jake starts to sit forward.  He is now watching
      like a hawk.  His eyes are zeroing in on a little quiver in
      Kyle's lip.  Jake bolts forward, grabbing Catherine's arm.

                                    JAKE
                    Kill the feed!

                                      CATHERINE
                    What?

                                    JAKE
                    Kill it!  Now!

                                      CATHERINE
                    What??  They're live.

      Just then Kyle doubles over, his head disappearing from view. 
      Catherine jumps to try and hit some button but not before
      everyone watching hears the sound of the new White House
      correspondent throwing up.  Kyle's image cuts to black.

                                    PAUL COLLINS
                    We seem to have lost our satellite
                    feed from the White House...

      Shocked looks in the control room.  Catherine is totally
      stunned.  Sam is hiding a smile.  Jake is laughing.

18INT. FRED'S OFFICE -- NIGHT18

      Catherine comes into the office of Fred's office.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Hey boss, I'm as upset about...

      Catherine notices KENNETH DONNEGAN (late 40's). Very English
      and nattily dressed.  When he talks he always sound positive,
      even when he's saying something negative.  He exudes
      confidence, but not arrogance.  You love him or hate him, but
      it's hard to be indifferent.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            14.

                                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you
                    had a guest.

                                    FRED
                    Don't worry.  Come on in.  There is
                    someone I want you to meet.  Catherine
                    Powell, this is Kenneth Donnegan.

                                      CATHERINE
                          (suspicious but polite)
                      A pleasure.  Of course your reputation
                    from the BBC precedes you. 

                                      KENNETH
                    Well only some of it is true.  Fred
                    here tells me you are the key to this
                    whole operation. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    I just make the trains run on time.
                          (to Fred)
                    Can I talk to you for a minute?

19INT. NNC HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS19

      When they're alone in the hall, Fred starts to look serious. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Want to tell me what he's doing here?

                                    FRED
                    Listen.  I didn't want it to happen
                    like this.  I told them it should be
                    you.  Sadly they think I'm just an
                    old drunk with an eye for great legs.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Thank you.

                                    FRED
                    For saying that about your legs?

                                      CATHERINE
                    No.

                                    FRED
                          (hating to say it)
                    Kenneth is taking over for me.

                                      CATHERINE
                          (stunned)
                    That guy??!!                ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            15.

                                    FRED
                    New York is in a panic.  Between the
                    economy and the ratings slump... 
                    They want someone who can bring some
                    sizzle.  You're old school like me. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    How can they do this? Did they even
                    consider me?  You know that guy turned
                    Newsnight into Inside Edition?

                                    FRED
                    Look, everyone knows you're the real
                    deal.  Couple days and you'll have
                    him wrapped around your finger, just
                    like you did me.  

                                      CATHERINE
                    I don't want him wrapped anywhere.  

      Catherine exits, leaving Fred looking very distressed.

20INT. CATHERINE'S OFFICE -- NIGHT20

      It's later and the newsroom is empty. Jake enters to find
      Catherine is watching and re-watching the clip of Kyle doubling
      over followed by the sound of throwing up.  She looks a bit
      of a mess.  Both her phone and her cell phone are ringing,
      and she's ignoring them. 

                                    JAKE
                    What's going on?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Did you fire that PA yet?

                                    JAKE
                    We should give her another chance. 
                    She's got something. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    What kind of something?

                                    JAKE
                    You know what I mean.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Hardly ever. 

                                    JAKE
                    Fine, but what's going on?  I know
                    that look of yours.               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            16.

                                      CATHERINE
                    My White House correspondent gets
                    stage fright like a third grader, our
                    bureau is a laughing stock, and I
                    can't kill myself right this minute
                    because my obituary would include the
                    word vomit.

                                    JAKE
                    I know all that. 

      Catherine doesn't answer right away.

                    From the BBC?  But... How can they do
                    that to you?  You've killed yourself
                    for this. 

                                      CATHERINE
                      Apparently New York wants new blood. 
                    Pompous English tabloidy blood.

                                    JAKE
                    That's ridiculous!  I mean, you run
                    this place.  Everybody knows that. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    I just can't believe it.  I mean, I
                    know I'm not good at everything.  I
                    pay my taxes late.  I can't do the
                    Times crossword puzzle.  But this
                    job.  I'm really good at this job. 
                    Great even.  It's just not fair.

                    But I haven't had a real boss in years. 
                    Not sure what I'll do if...

      Just as Catherine's getting choked up her cell phone rings.

                                    KYLE
                    I've done thousands of stand-ups. 
                    Just something happens when I have to
                    go live.  And from the White House! 
                    It just got to me.  I can't believe I
                    puked on national television.

                    tomorrow.  You know it's on YouTube
                    already.  

22INT. KYLE'S APARTMENT BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS22

      Kyle enters. Lying on the bed is Lauren, looking at a stack
      of papers.  Her hair is down, she's beaming, almost girlish. 
      Not a trace of that hardness she puts on behind the podium.

                                      LAUREN
                    Bush Senior puked on the Japanese
                    Prime Minister and he survived.

                    A black man cannot stumble like that
                    in America and survive.

      obsessively organized.                ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            18.

      Lauren is getting off the bed, finding her shoes and putting
      her papers in a briefcase.

                    Maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing
                    if we both got other assignments.  We
                    might actually have a life together
                    instead of all this sneaking around
                    and secrecy.

                                    KYLE
                    That would hurt us both.  I know how
                    hard you've worked for this job. 
                    Both of us.  We're not giving up
                    because of my weak stomach.

                                      LAUREN
                    We'd land on our feet.

      She's trying to be romantic and he doesn't notice.

                                    KYLE
                    Maybe.  But for now, I've got to try
                    and save the job I've wanted since I
                    was ten.  What am I going to do?

                          (professional voice)
                    Look, you've got some spotlight.  Use
                    it.  Everyone on the planet has had
                    jitters.  It doesn't hurt you unless
                    you're embarrassed.  Do some quick
                    hits on talk radio, or get on TV. 
                    Laugh about it in public.  Be
                      sympathetic and funny.  Get out in
                    front of it and you control it.  This
                    is public relations 101.    

                                    KYLE
                    You are so hot when you talk shop.

      She gives him a perfunctory kiss and starts to leave.  Kyle
      grabs her for a real kiss.  It's pretty hot.

                                    KYLE  (CONT'D)
                    Don't go out the front.

                                      LAUREN
                    Thanks, I've got the secret affair
                    drill down.

      Catherine and Jake are sitting in adjoining booths.  Jake's
      back is to Catherine, but he's turned around to talk to her.               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            19.

                    I have to get New York's attention
                    before I make my play.  Remind them

                    raising hell they actually listen.

                    No way I can answer to Monty Python. 
                    I always loved investigations.  I
                    could put together my own unit with a
                    direct report to New York.  Wait,
                    he's here.

      Jake turns away and pretends to be by himself. Coming over to
      Catherine is RICK WARDEN.  Late-50's, overweight, balding. 
      It's the middle of winter but he always seems a little sweaty.

                                      WARDEN

                    about Fanning's replacement?

                                      WARDEN
                          (considering)
                    After this we're even. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Fine. 

                                      WARDEN
                    The President wants to put Charlie
                    Ewing on the Supreme Court. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Ewing?  Ewing's a Republican.  How
                    soon is this going down?

                                      WARDEN
                    Fanning already told the President
                    privately that he's leaving.  Should
                    happen by the end of next week.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Why Ewing?

                                      WARDEN
                    The President campaigned on reaching
                    across the aisle.

                                      WARDEN (CONT'D)
                    Ending partisan bickering.  He wants
                    to do something bold to show that he
                    was serious.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Will Ewing make it through the Senate?

                                      WARDEN
                    Probably.  But anything is possible. 
                    We've got some people working on it. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Working for it or against it?
                          (he doesn't answer)
                    Pretty thin.  Anything worth digging
                    for in this?

      Warden smiles but doesn't respond.  Stands up.  Warden holds
      her in a long stare.  Leans forward and takes a pen from his
      pocket.  Scribbles something on a napkin.  A woman's name.

                                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    Mistress?

                                      WARDEN
                    You're the reporter. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Does the White House want this out or
                    are you going rogue?

      Warden very obviously decides not to answer this question as
      he leaves. Catherine is floored.  Staring at the name on the
      napkin.  "Tanya Simon."  When Warden is gone, Jake is back. 
      He and Catherine share a look of shocked excitement.

                                    JAKE
                    How the hell did you get the Deputy
                    Chief of Staff as a source?!

                                      CATHERINE
                      Nevermind.  We've got work to do.

                                    JAKE
                    I feel kind of dirty.  But wow!   

                                      CATHERINE
                    If I can break this...

                                    JAKE
                    I know.  

      Off Katherine and Jake's adrenaline rush.

                                    END OF ACT ONE              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            21.

24INT. FRED'S OFFICE -- DAY24

      Catherine and Jake enter.  Fred is on the couch with a drink
      in his hand, sharing a good old boy laugh with Kenneth. 
      Catherine is surprised to see Kenneth there.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Oh, sorry.  We'll come back.

                                    FRED
                    Don't be stupid.  Sit.

                                      KENNETH
                    You're just the person we were talking
                    about.  I'm going to be counting on
                    you to keep me from making a complete
                    farce of this.

                                      CATHERINE
                    I'm not sure counting on me is a good
                    idea for you.

      Neither Catherine or Jake sit. Jake looks at his feet.  Fred
      takes a drink.  There is an uncomfortable silence.

                                    FRED
                    She'll come around.  She just doesn't
                    like people very much.

                                      CATHERINE
                    She's standing right here.  And she
                    doesn't think condescension is going
                    to make this any better. 
                          (shifting gears)
                    I've got an inside track on Justice
                    Fanning's replacement.  A very solid
                    source says Charlie Ewing is going to
                    get the nod. 

                                      KENNETH
                    Who is your source?  And uh, I'm sure
                    I should know but, who is Ewing?

      Catherine shoots Fred a look to say "can you believe this?!"

                                      CATHERINE
                    Charles Ewing was a two term Republican
                    governor of Virginia.  Retired a few
                    years ago.  With the court this closely
                    divided, nominating a Republican has
                    huge implications.

                                      KENNETH
                    And the source?              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            22.

                                      CATHERINE
                      Confidential.  But Jake can vouch. 
                    He was there. 

      Jake starts to speak, but realizes no one cares what he says. 
      Kenneth and Catherine stare each other down.  It's tense.

                                      KENNETH
                    Look, I need you here, not out chasing
                    beltway gossip.  I don't want my
                    assistant bureau chief playing cub
                    reporter. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Gossip??  The Supreme Court!?   

                                      KENNETH
                    Well, regardless this isn't a story
                    we want to run single sourced.  So if
                    you can find a second source and still
                    keep the... uh, trains on time, we'll
                    run with it.  

      Catherine is fuming but silent as she exits.

25INT. JAKE'S OFFICE -- MORNING25

      Jake enters to find Molly perched stiffly in the chair, as if
      she is afraid to put any weight on it.  She looks as if she's
      going to speak, but can't find the words. 

                                    JAKE
                    We're not going to fire you.  But why
                    didn't you call me right away?

                                      MOLLY
                    I'm so sorry.  My phone broke....
                            (stammering, upset)
                    ...And I guess maybe I was just too
                    scared. 

                                    JAKE
                    Next time, find a phone.  Rip it out
                    of the hands of the nearest pedestrian
                    if you have to.  I don't care what's
                    happened to you.  Call, text, e-mail,
                    write me a note in blood and send it
                    by carrier pigeon... but don't ever
                    leave me hanging like that.  Ok?

                                      MOLLY
                    Ok.  Thank you.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            23.

                                    JAKE
                    And listen - be careful with Catherine
                    for a bit.  She's got her eye on you,
                    and not in a good way.  So keep your
                    head down.

26INT. NNC CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY26

      The room is very full.  Sam, Kyle, and Jake are there. 
      Catherine enters, followed seconds later by Fred, and Kenneth. 
      She takes a seat at the head of the table.  Fred stands behind
      her, hands on her shoulders - Kenneth hangs behind a bit. 

                                    FRED
                    Morning everyone.

      The room goes from quiet to silent.

                                    FRED  (CONT'D)
                    Thanks for taking time away from
                    telling your best vomit jokes to join
                    me this morning.  Those of you who
                    are decent reporters and care at all
                    about your pathetic careers, probably
                    already know that I've got one foot
                    out of here.  I wish I could give you
                    a reason good enough for you all to
                    believe, but I'm pretty sure that's
                    hopeless.  Instead I'm going to follow
                    the long honored Washington tradition
                    and tell you that I intend to spend
                    more time with my family.  If you are
                      considering a parting gift to me,
                    please recall my personal motto: single
                    malt.

      Everyone laughs.  A few people "boo" the news.

                                    FRED (CONT'D)
                    With that said, I'd like to introduce
                    you to Kenneth Donnegan, whom many of
                    you know by reputation from his work
                    at the BBC.  Starting more or less
                      immediately he will be your new bureau
                    chief.  Kenneth brings with him an
                      incredibly distinguished resume.  I
                    have told him in no uncertain terms
                    what a remarkable staff he inherits,
                    so please don't make a liar out of
                    me.

      Catherine holds her smile on as hard as possible, but no one
      is buying it.  Everyone glances from her to Kenneth, to Fred. 
      Shocked looks.  Quite a few people are trying to secretly
      type an e-mail into their Blackberries.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            24.

                                      KENNETH
                    Hello everyone.  I'm very pleased to
                    be here.  You all know this of course
                    but it is a new day for the TV News
                    business, and right now, not a very
                    good one.  We're going to have to
                    make some changes if we are going to
                    survive.  I know folks around here
                    think that your mission is fighting
                    for truth, justice, and the American
                    way.  But without better ratings, you
                    may win that battle and lose the war. 
                    We have to do better.  We will do
                    better. 

      He's a great speaker, and really has people rapt.  Except 
      Catherine.  She stands up and heads for the door - saying
      nothing and making no eye contact with anyone.

27INT. NNC WOMEN'S BATHROOM -- DAY27

      Catherine enters stone faced and ashen.  She quickly enters a
      stall.  From outside the stall we hear her sobbing.  Molly
      enters the bathroom, oblivious, and heads to the sink to brush
      her teeth.  She hears the crying, quieter now because Catherine
      has heard someone enter.  Molly knows she's supposed to ignore
      it, but she can't.

                                      MOLLY
                    Are you ok?  (Silence)  Excuse me,
                    sorry to intrude, but are you ok?  

                                      CATHERINE
                    Please don't tell me you're a
                      journalist asking questions like that. 
                    Do I sound OK?

                                      MOLLY
                    Sorry.  Do you need anything?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Privacy.  And your name.

                                      MOLLY
                    Uh, it's (long pause while she
                    considers doing something terribly
                    wrong)  Lisa.  Sorry.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Go away Lisa.

      Molly leaves.

28INT. FRED'S OFFICE -- DAY28

      Sam and Kenneth are talking, with Fred looking on.               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            25.

                                      KENNETH
                      Personally, I thought they should've
                    put you at the White House.  No one
                    else has got your special blend of
                    polite and ferocious.  I told New
                    York as much when they hired me.  But
                    they're in love with Kyle. 

                                    SAM
                            (diplomatic, but not
                          at all sincere)
                    Kyle did good work on the campaign.

                                      KENNETH
                    And unfortunately for you, his
                    candidate won.  But don't worry.  I
                    have big plans for you. 

                                    SAM
                    I'm listening.

                                      KENNETH
                    The Kumar story.  The girl's
                      disappearance has been a big ratings
                    grabber for cable.  I think it's the
                    kind of thing we should do more of.

                    Teenage girls go missing all the time. 
                    Hardly news is it?  Roopika Kumar has
                    been gone for five, maybe six months,
                    and call me cynical, but the kid's
                    resting comfortably in missing girl
                    heaven with Chandra Levy and Natalee
                    Holloway.  I've got nothing against a
                    little tabloid filler here and there
                    but that story is ice cold.  You think
                    New York's going to run that?

                                      KENNETH
                    I do. Show me what you've got.
                          (closing it down)
                    Surprise me.

29INT. NNC HALLWAY -- DAY29

      Catherine runs into Sam.  Catherine looks furious.

                                    SAM
                    What are you going to do?               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            26.

                                      CATHERINE
                    I'm going to try and get an independent
                    unit together.  I'm working on
                      something. 

                                    SAM
                    That's the spirit.  You hear anything
                    about that missing Kumar Girl?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Don't tell me he's got you chasing
                      ambulances now.

                                    SAM
                    Yeah, and you know how I love a touchy
                    feely sob story.  Chisolm is going to
                    be up at the White House getting on
                    air every bloody day, and they've got
                    me doing a story that made the cover
                    of People Magazine five months ago. 
                    Maybe I should go back overseas. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    That's not going to get you on.  We
                    barely even run foreign news anymore.  

                                    SAM
                    I figured at least when they gave
                    Kyle the White House, you'd assign me
                    good stuff and I'd get on air once in
                    a while.  

                                      CATHERINE
                    I promise when I go postal I'll give
                    you the exclusive.  
                          (noticing her coat)
                    Where are you going?

                                    SAM
                    I'm going to see a man about a horse.

      Molly is at her computer when Angela leans against her desk.

                    So how'd you survive that Kyle thing? 
                    We all figured the news nun would
                    have your head for sure.

                      Catherine?  She's so scary.  But,
                    well, I think Jake is a little more

                    Careful with him.

                                      MOLLY
                    Jake?  Oh, I don't think... I mean,
                    he has a girlfriend right? 

                                      PRIYA
                      Supposedly.  He's been breaking up

                                      ANGELA
                    Anyway, he likes to sample the new

                                      MOLLY
                    He really sleeps around??

                                      PRIYA
                    I don't think he sleeps with them. 
                    He's got his own Bill Clinton rules.

                    Just be careful.  Show me a man in
                    the news business who isn't on the
                    prowl, and I'll show you a bad case

      Angela's phone rings and she steps away to answer.

                    For what it's worth, he's a great
                    kisser.

31INT. WASHINGTON OFFICE -- DAY31

      In the pleasant wood panelled office of a DC bureaucrat, Sam
      is buttoning her blouse, and keeping one eye on the TV showing
      cable news.  A HANDSOME MAN across the room is fixing his tie
      and clipping on a badge that says Agent Tompkins, FBI. 

                                    SAM
                    Have you heard anything about the
                    Roopika Kumar investigation?  That
                    girl who disappeared a while back?

                    You sure?  Cause I'm pretty good at

                                      TOMPKINS
                    I'm well aware. In this case, the FBI

32INT. THE PIT -- DAY32

      Molly and Angela are watching a girl in a cubicle across the
      room pack up her things.  She's red faced - been crying. 

                                      MOLLY
                    Where is she going?

                    Wait, her name is Lisa??

                                      ANGELA
                    Yeah.  Lisa Soller. So harsh.  That
                    graveyard shift is brutal.

                                      MOLLY
                    What happened?

33EXT. NNC BUILDING -- DAY 33

      Jake and Kyle walk back from getting coffee. Side by side on
      a busy street.  Crowded sidewalk, traffic humming.  They check
      their Blackberries, and sip coffees, and talk.

                                    KYLE
                    So? How bad was it?

                                    JAKE
                          (laughing)
                    What, Vomitgate?  It was bad.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            29.

                                    KYLE
                    You think they're gonna pull me?

                                    JAKE
                    No way.  You're a star.  You'd have
                    to throw up ON the President for them
                    to pull you.  

                                    KYLE
                    I don't know what to do.  You think I
                    should run with it?  Maybe try to get
                    on Jon Stewart?  You know, laugh along
                    with them about it? 

                                    JAKE
                    Can you keep your dinner down?

      Kyle's phone rings.  He answers.

                                    KYLE 
                    Hey beautiful.

      Jake's phone rings.  He answers.  Now the two are walking
      side by side, on their phones, often talking over each other.

                                    JAKE
                    Hi.  Look, I'm sorry.

                                    KYLE
                    I know.  You know I didn't mean that.

                                    JAKE
                    That's not what I meant.  I just don't
                    have time to...

                                    KYLE
                    I don't think I can today.  I have to
                    do a story for tonight.

                                    JAKE
                    It's just been crazy with the
                      inauguration and stuff.  Things are
                    going to calm down.  I promise...

                                    KYLE
                    Ok, ok.  All you have to say is that
                    it's important.  What time?

                                    JAKE
                    I know it's tonight.  It's in my
                    calendar.  Don't worry.

                    You too.  Bye.

      Both hang up.  Eye each other.  

                                    JAKE  (CONT'D)
                    You still doing that?

                                    KYLE
                    Yeah.  You?

                                    JAKE
                    Yeah.

                                    KYLE
                    I thought you were going to end that.

                                    JAKE
                    I was... I am.
                          (pause)
                    I think if you can get on Jon Stewart,
                    that's the right move.

      They stop in front of NNC and run into Catherine.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Aren't you supposed to be covering
                    the White House not the pretty boy
                    gossip hour?  Can I have a word alone
                    with Mrs. Chisolm?

      Kyle exits with a slight chuckle that almost masks how much
      she gets under his skin. 

                                      CATHERINE  (CONT'D)
                    If you breathe a word of this to the
                    Fresh Prince...

                                    JAKE
                    Don't worry.  Why didn't you hook
                    Donnegan with Ewing's mystery lady? 
                    He would've gone nuts for it.

                    Once we give him that, it's out of
                    our hands.  I don't trust him. 

                                    JAKE
                    And what about the mystery lady?

                    Tanya Simon?  Lives in Arlington. 
                    Looks like Ewing has been funneling

                    How much?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Enough.  I left her a couple messages,
                    but I have a feeling I'm going to
                    have to pay her a visit.  I'm going
                    out there tonight.  Want to come?  

                                    JAKE
                    I've got plans I really can't change.

                                      CATHERINE
                    C'mon.  You're going to break up with
                    her anyway.  

      She gives Jake a look that has just enough flirt in it that
      he can't resist.

34INT. TAXI -- NIGHT34

      Kyle is riding in the back of a taxi, working his Blackberry.

                                    KYLE

                    Yeah, on the far corner there.  We're
                    just picking someone up.

      The taxi pulls up to the corner and Lauren, head covered in a
      scarf and wearing dark glasses gets in.  She's very serious.

                    I need to know your intentions.

                    I want to know what you think is
                    supposed to happen now.

                    Did someone find out about us?

      She is silent.  Eyes tearing up.  Still won't look at him.

                    Sorry sir but we need to stop in Dupont
                    Circle first. 

      Kyle sits back.  At last he turns to look at her.  Tears are
      streaming down her face.  He's shocked and confused.

35EXT. SUBURBAN STREET -- NIGHT35

      Catherine and Jake are sitting in her car drinking coffee. 
      Her car is a mess.  They're sharing a bag of pretzels, and
      pretending they aren't feeling some lurking sexual tension. 

                                    JAKE
                    This was more fun when we smoked.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Yeah, turns out that's bad for you.
                    Hey, we should get Hannah Montana to
                    stake out Ewing's house too.  Just in
                    case.

                                    JAKE
                    Who?

                                      CATHERINE
                      Whats-her-name who lost Kyle's tape.
                    Your little pet. 

                                    JAKE
                    Molly.  Sure.  Anything much on this
                    Tanya woman?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Thirty five maybe.  Single mom. She's
                    a public defender.  I thought maybe
                    she met Ewing in court when he was a
                      prosecutor, but the dates don't match
                    up.  Doesn't make sense. 

                                    JAKE
                    Why not?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Just doesn't feel like the kind of
                    woman who would work as a public
                    defender would take hush money from
                    the governor. 

                                    JAKE
                    I think a single parent who lives on
                    40 thousand a year takes whatever
                    comes their way. 
                          (pause)
                    So, am I allowed to ask how you're
                    feeling about things?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Lousy.  Fine.  You know what my mother
                    said when I told her?               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            34.

                                    JAKE
                    She said you've been wearing the wrong
                    lipstick? 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Close.  She said, "Well you can always
                    waitress sweetheart."

                                    JAKE
                    Well, in her world that's reassuring. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    It's exactly what she said when I
                    quit law school.  I just hate when
                    things confirm my mother's delusion
                    that I'm like her. 

                                    JAKE
                    Your mom is hot. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    You are so vile.  And my mom is not
                    hot, she's just easy.  Men seem not
                    to be able to tell the difference.   

      Headlights cross over their faces. 

                                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                      -Someone's home. 
                          (heavy sigh - bracing)
                    I hate this part. 

      Catherine and Jake get out of her car and walk over toward a
      woman (30's) and her 10 year-old daughter getting out of their
      car in front of a very modest suburban ranch house.  The woman
      (Tanya) is a little exotic and very pretty. 

                                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    Excuse me, Ms. Simon?  Hi, it's
                    Catherine Powell from NNC, I left you
                    a few messages.

      The woman makes a beeline for her front door, pulling her
      daughter with her.  She looks scared, confused. 

                                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    Look, I know you don't want to talk
                    to me, but there are going to be more
                    after me.  I can help you.

      The woman and daughter go inside and slam the door.  

36INT. SAM'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON36

      Sam is working the phones.  She has a huge old Rolodex on her
      desk with thousands of numbers.                ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            35.

      Priya is running a beta deck and scanning through footage of
      the story - police searching, crying family, candlelight vigil,
      etc. 

                                    SAM
                    That's the third dead end in three
                    tries.  This story is so over.

      She thinks for a minute, and then has a little smirk.  She
      flips her Rolodex to a new number.

                                    SAM (CONT'D)
                    Hello Sir.  Sam Hathaway.  Sorry to
                    bother you on your cell, but I'm
                    working a lead on the disappearance
                    of the Kumar girl.  
                          (pause)
                    I know girls disappear every day...
                          (pause)
                    Well I've heard that the Indian
                      ambassador is going to drive out and
                    meet with the parents.

      Sam holds one hand over the phone, and whispers to Priya.

                                    SAM (CONT'D)
                    I need the number for the press office
                    of the Indian Embassy. 
                          (back into the phone)
                    Oh, you haven't... Would you?  I'd so
                      appreciate it.

      Sam hangs up.  Priya is writing on a post-it.

                                      PRIYA
                    Where did you learn that about the
                    Indian ambassador?

                                    SAM
                    I didn't.  But if you can't break
                    news, you can always try and make
                    news.  It shouldn't be that hard to
                    get the Indian ambassador to feel a
                    little pressure. 

      Priya smiles, but actually looks a little nervous about this
      kind of "reporting."  Sam dials another number.

                                    SAM (CONT'D)
                    Hello, this is Sam Hathaway at NNC. 
                    I've just spoken with Ambassador
                    Robert's office at the UN.  Is it
                    true that Ambassador Singh is planning
                    to visit Roopika Kumar's parents?

                    I need the South Asia desk at State.

37INT. CATHERINE'S OFFICE -- DAY37

      Catherine and Jake look over papers.  Catherine is staring at
      a portrait of Ewing.  He's classic politician handsome. 
      Studying his face, his eyes.  Especially the eyes. 

                                    JAKE
                    So there is nothing on Tanya Simon in
                    Nexis?  How is it possible that she
                    hasn't appeared in any newspaper
                    anywhere?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Believe it or not, most of the world
                    is anonymous. 

                                    JAKE
                    Holy wide load, Batman!!

                                      CATHERINE
                    What??!!

                                    JAKE
                    Have you seen Mrs. Ewing?  No wonder
                    the Governor was sleeping around. 
                    She's a beast. 

      They examine a photo of Ewing with his wife. She's not quite
      obese, but certainly heavy, and not attractive.  

                                      CATHERINE
                    The whole thing screams infidelity,
                    but I can't figure out how Ewing got
                    away with it for so long.  

                                    JAKE
                    Tanya went to Georgetown Law?  Don't
                    you still know some people there?

                    Yeah, my old professor. I'm not sure
                    I can call him on this.

                    Bad beginning.  Never got started. 
                    We gotta see if we can get some help
                    on this.  We still need a second source
                    for Ewing's appointment even if I can
                    pin down the Tanya story.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            37.

                    getting nominated to Fanning's seat
                    on the court?  Maybe see if the FBI
                    has done a background check?

                    Ewing's a Republican.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Yeah, but I've got a good source.  I
                    still really need a second.

                                    SAM
                    Kyle get anything from the White House

                    I'm keeping it close right now.

                                    SAM
                    I can look into this for you.  But if
                    it gets legs, I want in. 

                                      CATHERINE

                    governor practically from birth.

                    No.  He's been home about two hours. 
                    Hey, did Catherine really push Lisa

                                    JAKE
                    Yeah, why?

                                      MOLLY
                    I think that was supposed to be me.

                                    JAKE 
                    I'm still trying to figure that out. 
                    On the good days I feel lucky they
                    pay me to just find out stuff and
                    help explain it back on TV.  The bad
                    days, I think there has to be more to
                    life than filling up the time between
                      pharmaceutical commercials. 

                                      MOLLY
                    So why do you do it?

                                    JAKE
                    When it's good, it's the most fun
                    I've ever had.  And believe me, I've
                    had plenty of fun. 

      Molly blushes at the innuendo from Jake. A car pulls past,
      both of them slump down in their seats.  They peek up as the
      car stops in front of Ewing's house.  Two men get out and go
      to the door. Ewing lets them in.

                    It looked like that guy Harper, the
                    lawyer guy.  Don't know the other.

                    Cool.

                                    JAKE
                          (dialing the phone)
                    Yeah, really cool.

40INT. UPSCALE BAR -- NIGHT40

      Catherine is at the bar with SIMON (45).  Tall, handsome,
      mild mannered, and clearly taken with Catherine.  She's put
      on lipstick to meet him, but looks uncomfortable. 

                                      SIMON
                    How's my favorite law school flunkie?

                                      CATHERINE
                    I didn't flunk.  Actually got an A in
                    your class.  What'd you find out?

                                      SIMON
                    You know, you say you love this job
                    but you always seem miserable.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            40.

                                      CATHERINE
                    I can't have this conversation now.
                          (impatient)
                    Look you know I hate asking you for
                    favors, but this one is important.
                    Did you find anything out for me?

      Simon pulls out a folder, but doesn't hand it to her. 

                                      SIMON
                    I could get fired for this. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    But you won't.

      Catherine snatches the folder.  Opens it and starts reading. 

                                      SIMON
                    Decent grades.  Nothing special. 
                    Always leaned toward the public
                    interest stuff.

                      Commonwealth Fellowship, what's that? 

                                      SIMON
                    All her tuition was paid by the
                      Commonwealth Foundation - Virginia
                      foundation that gives law school
                      scholarships.  Been around for a long
                    time.  Coal money.

      Catherine's phone rings.  Caller ID says Jake. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Hey.... They're at Ewing's house now? 
                    How long have they been there?  This
                    could be it.  

      She already has her coat, not hanging up the phone.  Gives
      Simon a peck on the cheek.

                                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    You're the best.

      She takes the folder and heads for the door.  Simon watches
      her go, a little pissed but slightly charmed by the kiss. 

41INT. SAM'S OFFICE -- NIGHT41

      Sam and Priya are still in Sam's office.  It's night now.
      Priya is still watching tape.  Sam's on the phone.

                                    SAM
                    Hey, it's Sam.  Call me back.               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            41.

                                      PRIYA
                    Who's that?

                                    SAM
                    Different story.  Trying to second
                    source something for Catherine. 

                                      PRIYA
                    You know in all these press conferences
                    and everything, the mom never talks. 
                    Always the dad.  Maybe we could get
                    an interview with her.

                                    SAM
                    She's never been interviewed?

                                      PRIYA
                    Doesn't speak English. 

                                    SAM
                    That's going to be a problem.  Guess
                    there is no chance that you...

                                      PRIYA
                    I'm from Bethesda.  My Hindi is limited
                    to "please" and "thank you." Too bad
                    my mom doesn't work here.

                          (lighting up)
                    Why can't she?

42INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT42

      Lauren and Kyle at a table for two.  Kyle looks miserable and
      keeps looking around the room.

                    Fine, but let's make it quick.  This
                    scares the hell out of me.

                    You know how fast my career would be
                    over if anybody knew about us. That's

                    I can take it.

                                    KYLE
                    You're just being emotional about
                    this.  When you've had some time to
                    think about this you'll see things
                    more clearly.  Besides, I'm up to my
                    eyeballs right now trying to deal
                    with all this other-

                                      LAUREN
                    If I'm being emotional it's because
                    I'm carrying the child of the man I
                    love, and he doesn't want to even be
                    seen with me.

      Lauren's Blackberry starts vibrating.  

                                    KYLE
                    You don't even know for sure-

                    -Six pregnancy tests say otherwise.

      Lauren finally picks up her Blackberry and looks.

                                      LAUREN  (CONT'D)
                    I've gotta go.

                                    KYLE
                    What's happening?

                                      LAUREN
                    Nothing.

                                    KYLE
                    Nothing? Or you can't tell me?

                    Someone at your network is poking a

43INT. JAKE'S OFFICE -- DAY43

      Catherine is hanging up the phone.

                                      CATHERINE
                    No one is giving up anything on Ewing. 

                                    JAKE
                    We've got a great source,  plus two
                      eyewitnesses of Warden and Harper at
                    Ewing's for two hours last night.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Sketchy.  You know Donnegan's still
                    going to want a real second source.

                                    JAKE
                    Why won't you just tell Donnegan about
                    Ewing's mystery woman?  New York will
                    notice that for sure.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Too risky to give it to him now. 
                          (off Jake confused)
                    Richard Jewell?  Wen Ho Lee?  Steven
                    Hatfill?  This is exactly how it
                    happens - people's lives ruined by
                    the rush to judgment because some
                      brown-noser like Donnegan wants to
                    play the news game but only really
                    cares about the headlines.

                                    JAKE
                    Well, we still don't have official
                    word on Fanning retiring so there is
                    time to get Tanya to talk.  I just
                    don't know how you crack that. 

      Kyle sticks his head in.

                                    KYLE
                    Hey.

                                    JAKE
                    Hey buddy.

                                    KYLE
                    You know, if you guys are going after
                    a White House story, I might be able
                    to help you. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    What makes you think we're working a
                    White House story?               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            44.

                                    KYLE
                    I have sources.  And last I checked
                    we all play for the same team. 

      Catherine looks back at her notes, and Jake gives Kyle a look
      that says "later."  Kyle leaves.

                                      CATHERINE
                    I can't believe you told Kyle!

                                    JAKE
                    You think I told Kyle??!!!

                                      CATHERINE
                    You can't be everyone's friend all
                    the time Jake.  And do I have to remind
                    you I'm your boss?

                                    JAKE
                    Hello, paranoid?  Don't you trust
                    anyone?  No wonder you can't keep a
                    boyfriend for more than one night.

                                      CATHERINE
                    At least I'm not so afraid of
                      disappointing people that I hang on
                    to the same pathetic girlfriend while
                    I'm sleeping with half the bureau.

                                    JAKE
                    Excuse me for actually caring about
                    other people's feelings.  Do you even
                    notice I've been running around the
                    last 72 hours trying to help?

                                      CATHERINE
                    You're just trying to help yourself. 
                    Forget it, I'll get Tanya to talk by
                    myself. 

44INT. HALLWAY -- DAY44

      Kyle on the phone.  Walking and frantic.

                                    KYLE
                    Lauren?  I don't know what they've
                    got, but I think it's big.  Maybe the
                    Fanning resignation.  Can't you tell
                    me anything?  (Pause)  They already
                    think I'm a problem or they would
                    tell me.  (Pause)  This has nothing
                    to do with that.  Can we please talk
                    about one thing at a time?  (Pause)
                    Hello?  Hello?              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            45.

      Kyle realizes she's hung up on him.  He walks by Priya and
      Sam who are talking outside Sam's office. 

                                      PRIYA
                    Are you kidding?  My mom is so into
                    it.  She thinks she's in the CIA.

                                    SAM
                    But she still can't get Mrs. Kumar on
                    the phone?

                                      PRIYA
                    No.  But don't worry, my mom is
                      relentless.  This is every Indian
                    mother's fantasy - being asked to pry
                    into other people's business.  

                                    SAM
                    Well, keep me posted. 

                                      PRIYA
                    What about the ambassador angle?

                                    SAM
                    I'm working another story right now. 
                    One that might actually get my face
                    on television.  Even with the weepy
                    mother, this story is a long shot. 

      As Sam exits, Priya's face can't hide a little revulsion. 

45EXT. SUBURBAN STREET -- NIGHT45

      Sam approaches a nice looking house.  It's clear she is
      nervous, maybe even a little scared.  She takes a deep breath,
      steadies herself, and rings the bell.  The door opens and we
      see the FBI guy from her mid-day romp.  He looks shocked.

                                    MAN
                    What the hell are you doing here?

                    Good evening Special Agent Tompkins. 
                    I was hoping I could ask you a couple
                      questions.

                    having dinner right now!

                                    SAM
                    Relax, it's business.  I need to know
                    if you've got anything on Governor
                    Ewing taking Justice Fanning's seat
                    on the Supreme Court.               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            46.

                    What?!  How the hell is that even an
                    FBI story?!

                                    SAM
                    Last I looked your office does the
                      background checks.

                                      TOMPKINS
                    This is bullsh... Can't you just call
                    my cell in the morning?

                                    SAM
                    For once you're going to give me what
                    I need.  And I'm so much more
                      persuasive in person.

                                      TOMPKINS
                    You've got no shame Hathaway.

46INT. TANYA'S HOUSE -- NIGHT46

      Catherine rings the doorbell.  Tanya opens the door with the
      chain still on, sees Catherine, and starts to close it. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Wait!  Ms. Simon.  Please!  I'm trying
                    to give you a chance to explain. 

                                      TANYA
                    I don't have to explain myself.

                                      CATHERINE
                    No.  No you don't.  But you should. 
                    I know about the money Ewing has paid
                    you.  I know his foundation sent you
                    to law school.

                                      TANYA
                    It's not what you think.

                                      CATHERINE
                      I understand.
                          (guessing)
                    I know he's not your boyfriend. 

                                      TANYA
                    Of course he isn't!

      Catherine stands there for few moments, locking eyes with her
      through the crack in the door.  Suddenly she has a flash of
        recognition.  Deep breath before letting loose her hunch.

                                      CATHERINE
                    He's your father.               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            47.

      Tanya closes the door, but then Catherine hears the chain
      slide back.  Slowly, the door opens. Catherine steps inside. 

47INT. WATERING HOLE -- NIGHT47

      Kyle and Jake are drinking at a bar with a handful of other
        journalists.  Ties loose.  Kyle is already a little drunk. 
      The TV finishes playing Kyle's appearance on the Daily Show.

                                    JON STEWART
                    Kyle Chisolm everyone!  The Vominator! 

      In the bar a little cheer goes up for Kyle, who looks pleased.

                                    JAKE
                    So have you figured out what to do?

                    I'm going to beg my best friend to
                    tell me what the hell is going on.

                                    JAKE
                    I mean about... you know, the baby.

                    She's gonna have a... you know.
                    She's going to take care of it.  So
                    you won't tell me what the story is?

                                    JAKE
                    She already thinks I told you.

                                    KYLE
                    Exactly.  It doesn't matter now.  

                                    JAKE

      Kyle stares straight ahead, feeling very alone. 

48INT. TANYA'S HOUSE -- NIGHT48

      Catherine is sitting at a kitchen table with a notebook out. 
      Tanya is coming down the hall with a cardboard box of papers.

                                      TANYA
                    I didn't go looking for him until my
                    mother died when I was 20. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    How did you know he was your father?

      Tanya hands Catherine a piece of paper from the box. 

                                      TANYA
                    Found that birth certificate... his
                    name was right on it.  He hadn't known
                    about me but he didn't try and deny
                    it.  He was pretty freaked.  He was
                    only 22 when my mom got pregnant. 
                    But I didn't want anything, you know. 
                    Just to meet him.  He was very nice
                    about it - just wanted to keep it
                    quiet, which was fine with me.  I
                    think he was already planning to run
                    for governor.  

                                      CATHERINE
                    And law school?              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            49.

                                      TANYA
                    I told him I wanted to go to law
                    school, and he was excited.  He loves
                    the law.  Said if I could get into
                      Georgetown he could pay my tuition. 
                    It was all fine until I got pregnant. 
                    I was going to drop out, but he was
                    insistent that I finish.  So he started
                    sending me money, even before Karen
                    was born... and it just continued
                    like that.  I never thought of it as
                    my money.  It was for her.

      Tanya starts to cry a little.  Catherine looks really
      uncomfortable but puts her hand on Tanya's shoulder.

                                      TANYA (CONT'D)
                    I'm not dirty laundry.  I'm just a
                    private person. 

49INT. CATHERINE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT49

      Catherine opens the door for Jake.  She's frantic.  

                                      CATHERINE
                    Thanks for coming.  I know it's late.

                    Sure, nothing I like more than an
                    angry booty call.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Stop being mad, I need your help.

                                    JAKE
                    As soon as you apologize.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Fine.  Come in. 

                                    JAKE
                    "Fine" is not an apology. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    I'm sorry. 

      Jake enters.  Catherine has stacks of papers and post-its and
      photos and clippings out on her table.  She's clearly spent
      hours with them.  She picks up the birth certificate and hands
      it to Jake.  He reads, and looks up in shock.

                                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    Yep.  He's her father. He paid for
                    her to go to law school. The money he
                    gave her was for her daughter.               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            50.

                                    JAKE
                    This is huge! Will she go on camera? 

      Catherine takes a breath before she says what she's clearly
      been struggling with.

                                      CATHERINE
                    I don't think we should run it.

                                    JAKE
                    WHAT???!!

                                      CATHERINE
                    There is nothing illegal here.  He
                    didn't break the law.  The payments
                    were from his own pocket - totally
                    legal.  She filed the taxes.  Why
                    should this keep him off the court?   

                                    JAKE
                    What about law school?

                                      CATHERINE
                    The foundation gives law school
                      scholarships - and he sits on the
                    board with discretion to choose
                    students.  It's a private foundation.
                    There's no wrongdoing!

                                    JAKE
                    So what!?  It's still a great story. 
                      Infidelity matters.

                                      CATHERINE
                    He wasn't even married then!  I've
                    been through this a hundred times.  I
                    can't find any evidence of him lying
                    about it.  It's his own money and his
                    own daughter.

                                    JAKE
                    Then report the story and let people
                    decide.  Honesty and integrity count.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Ewing's or mine?  If we report it, we
                    are saying it matters. I promised
                    myself when I got into this business
                    that I wasn't going to become
                      mercenary.  Aren't we supposed to
                    decide that first? If we do this, you
                    know how it will play.  They'll kill
                    him with it.  This is the Supreme
                    Court we're talking about!              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            51.

                                    JAKE
                    Don't let this get all personal.

                                      CATHERINE
                    What is that supposed to mean?

                                    JAKE
                    Daughter of a single mom? Hung up on
                    a missing father?  This doesn't ring
                    a bell to you? 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Do you actually want to insult me
                    both personally and professionally
                    right now?  

                                    JAKE
                    I'm just saying.  I know you and this
                    one is close to home.

      Catherine doesn't respond.  She is obviously holding in a lot
      of emotion.  Finally Jake breaks the silence.

                                    JAKE (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.  But, you don't owe these people
                    anything.  You need this story, and
                    look where playing the straight and
                    narrow has gotten you: listening to
                    the chipper Englishman tell you how
                    to do your job. New York HAS to pay
                    attention if you bring this in.

      Catherine's doorbell rings.  It's Sam. 

                                    SAM
                    I got it. 
                          (seeing Jake)
                    Wait, what's going on? 

                                    JAKE
                    Nothing.  Just, ah...

                                      CATHERINE
                    It's ok. I told her about Tanya. 
                          (to Sam)
                    She's Ewing's daughter.  But it all
                    looks totally above board. 

                                    JAKE
                    Catherine thinks we should leave it
                    alone.  God knows why. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Were you listening to me?! 
                          (to Sam)
                    Wait, you got what?               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            52.

                                    SAM
                    A second source on the Ewing
                      nomination.  My guy at Justice spilled
                    the whole thing. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Yes!  We can break it tomorrow!

                                    JAKE
                    What about Tanya?

                                      CATHERINE
                    I don't need it now.  I can break the
                      nomination story, and leave Tanya out
                    of it.  It's still a decent scoop. 

                                    JAKE
                          (to Sam)
                    Will you talk to her?

                                    SAM
                    What do you want?  She's a good girl.
                    Why did Warden give you this anyway? 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Warden's a partisan warrior.  Probably
                    hates the idea of another Republican
                    on the court.  I'm sure he was hoping
                    we would torpedo Ewing with this. 
                    All the more reason why we shouldn't.

                                    JAKE
                    Forget Warden!  This is about you. 
                    There is a big difference between
                    breaking a nomination story and
                    exposing Governor Ewing's illegitimate
                    child.  You want to show New York the
                    goods?  It's Tanya.  Are you sure
                    this is what you want to do?

      Off Catherine's inner turmoil.

50INT. THE PIT -- MORNING50

      The room is buzzing, everything hopping.  Phones ringing,
      everyone in a hurry.  Kenneth is reading some pages.  Catherine
      and Sam hurry up to him with Jake trailing.

                                      CATHERINE
                    We got it.

                                    SAM 
                    A source of mine at Justice says that
                    the FBI has done a full background
                    check on Ewing to prepare for his
                      nomination.

      Kenneth is staring at a TV, ignoring them.

                                      KENNETH
                    Nice work ladies but it's too late. 
                    The White House scheduled a morning
                    presser for Monday to officially
                    announce Ewing.

                                      CATHERINE
                    What??!!

                                      KENNETH
                    Just happened.  They're doing the
                      backgrounder now.

      On the TV, we see Lauren in the White House briefing room. 

                                      LAUREN
                    The President and Governor Ewing will
                    join Justice Fanning in the Rose Garden
                    at 9am Monday.  Each will give a brief
                    statement and answer questions.  I'm
                    not going to address anything of
                    substance this morning...

51INT. THE PIT -- DAY51

      Catherine is in charge now, and is visibly frustrated as they
      work to get a Ewing story done for the evening news.  Sam is
      hovering.  Kenneth is gone.

                                      CATHERINE
                          (to everyone)
                    No, not Kyle.  Sam will do the story
                    from the court.  Does anybody have
                    Ewing's whereabouts?  Do we have
                    someone at his house?              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            54.

                                      PRODUCER
                    Yes. No sign of him.  And his office
                    won't return calls.

                                    SEAN
                          (running in)
                    He's not at the White House or EOB. 
                    Every reporter in town is looking.

                                      CATHERINE
                    So much for being ahead of the pack.
                    Where is he hiding?  At least let's
                    get a smile, a wave, and a "no
                    comment."  Can we manage that?  
                          (really irritated)
                    We're not doing a story in which we
                    announce that the White House announced
                    that they are going to make an
                      announcement.  We're journalists not
                      stenographers.

      In another part of the room, Jake looks on, while making calls. 
      Molly approaches.  Sam is just close enough to hear.

                                      MOLLY
                    Jake?

                                    JAKE
                    Yeah kid.

                                      MOLLY
                    I think I know where he might be.  I
                    found this in my reading.

      Molly hands Jake a page.  Jake reads and then jumps up.  Sam
      sees this and comes over.

                                    JAKE
                    Molly needs a crew ASAP!
                          (to Molly)
                    If you're not back here with tape by
                    five, we can't use it.  Keep it
                    friendly.  We don't want to make this
                    guy our enemy.

                                    SAM
                          (Just finished reading)
                    I'm coming.  We'll be back in time.

                                      MOLLY
                          (scared of Sam)
                    Oh, that's ok. I can manage it.

                                    SAM
                    I wasn't asking.  Let's go.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            55.

52EXT. WOODS ALONG THE POTOMAC -- DAY52

      Sam, Molly and the van cruise along a dirt road running along
      the Potomac.  She's scanning the river bank.

                                      MOLLY
                    There! Over there, the Explorer!

      She points to a black Explorer peeking through the trees. 
      Molly is positively beaming.

                                    SAM
                          (sultry)
                    Hello, Governor. 

53INT. CONTROL ROOM -- DAY53

      Catherine works the control room as the clock ticks closer to
      air.  Jake comes barreling in.

                                    JAKE
                    Molly got him!

                                      CATHERINE
                    Who got him?!

                                    JAKE
                    Mol- Hannah Montana. She found him!  

                                      CATHERINE
                          (into a microphone)
                    Hold the Ewing piece!  We've got new
                    tape coming.
                          (to Jake)
                    What'd he say?

                                    JAKE
                    Nothing special.  Honored.  Excited
                    about the challenges.  Blah, blah.  

                                      CATHERINE
                    I want to see it the second they're
                    here.  And tell her not to stop unless
                    the President himself runs into her
                    car.  How the hell'd she find him?

                                    JAKE
                      Apparently he let Angler's Magazine
                    profile his favorite fishing spot. 
                    He told them it's his best escape
                    when Washington gets to be too much.

                    I told you she was smart.
                          (privately to her)
                    Are you still sure you don't want to
                    go with Tanya's story.  We could kill
                    with this thing.  It'd be huge.

                    You're going to be miserable if you're
                    stuck here answering to Donnegan.

      Out on Catherine's indecision.

54INT. THE PIT -- EVENING54

      All eyes are fixed on the TVs showing the broadcast.

                    ...always been proud to serve in any

      Everyone but Catherine is celebratory.  She knows she just
      lost her best shot by keeping Tanya's secret.  Kenneth enters.

                                      KENNETH
                    I just want to say thanks to you all
                    for a nice bit of work today.  We
                    were the only broadcast - cable or
                    network to get a comment from Charlie
                    Ewing so a special nod to Sam for
                    making us all look sharp.  A good
                    feeling, that I hope we'll share a
                    lot more of.  I'm buying at The Hole
                    in 30 minutes.

      A cheer goes up.  Molly is smiling but looks a bit dejected.
      Catherine looks deflated as she heads to her office.

55INT. CATHERINE'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS55

      Catherine's phone rings as she enters.  On speaker phone:

                                      CATHERINE
                    Hello?              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            57.

                                    RICK WARDEN  (O.S.)
                    It's Warden.  Downstairs in five.

56INT. WARDEN'S CAR -- EVENING56

      Catherine climbs into the passenger seat of Warden's Cadillac.  

                                      WARDEN
                    What the hell was that?

                                      CATHERINE
                    I'm sorry?

                                      WARDEN
                    I gave you the girl so you could use
                    it.  It's a two way street you know.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Well I'm sorry I couldn't do your
                    dirty work.  We're still working that
                    story, but it's complicated.  You
                    didn't exactly give us much time. 

                                      WARDEN
                    Well you would have had more if you
                    hadn't tried to trade it back.

                                      CATHERINE
                    What does that mean?

                                      WARDEN
                    Someone in your bureau tipped off our
                    press office that you had Ewing
                    confirmed and were after his daughter. 
                    So they rushed the announcement.  I
                    couldn't slow it down.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Who the hell was it??

                                      WARDEN
                    If you can't even keep track of your
                    own office...

      Catherine starts to go.

                                      WARDEN (CONT'D)
                    Where are you going?

                                      CATHERINE
                    I'm getting to the bottom of this. 

                                    END OF ACT FIVE              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            58.

                                        ACT SIX

57INT. NNC CONFERENCE ROOM -- EVENING57

      Jake, Kyle, and Catherine sit in silence.  The tension is
      brutal.  Everyone furious at everyone.  Kenneth enters.

                                      KENNETH
                    I didn't realize I was going to have
                    to play headmaster to all of you
                    children, but apparently-

                                      CATHERINE
                    This isn't a joke. 

                                      KENNETH
                    On the contrary, you've made it quite
                    serious.

                                      CATHERINE
                    I didn't make it anything.  We had a
                    direct leak from this bureau to the
                    White House.  Not only did someone
                    tell them we had confirmation on Ewing,
                    but that we were after his daughter
                    too!  That was privileged information,
                    and that leak totally killed our chance
                    to break the story.  I think Kyle's-

                                      KENNETH
                    -Kyle was not the source of the leak
                    to the White House.

                                      CATHERINE
                    How can you possibly know that?

                                      KENNETH
                    Because I was.

      Stunned silence.

                                      KENNETH  (CONT'D)
                    And when our correspondent lands the
                    first exclusive Presidential interview,
                    it will be clear why.

                                      CATHERINE
                    You have no right.

                                      KENNETH
                    I have every right.  And your
                      righteousness does not serve you well,
                    Ms. Powell.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            59.

                                    KYLE
                    I want to lodge a formal complaint. 
                    My contract stipulates-

                                      KENNETH
                    You, Mr. Chisolm, are in no position
                    to complain about anything.  You've
                      embarrassed yourself beyond what any
                    serious journalist should accept. 
                    Lucky for you I'm not that serious.

      As Kyle starts to interrupt Kenneth silences him with a look.

                                      KENNETH (CONT'D)
                    Go back to work, Kyle.  Prove you are
                    worthy of a very important job.  And
                    try to keep your lunch off the briefing
                    room floor.

                                    KYLE
                    Yes, sir.

      Kyle and Jake leave.  Catherine stands her ground a minute.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Who told you about Ewing's daughter?

                                      KENNETH
                    I'm afraid my sources, like yours,
                    are confidential.  What's far more
                    important is why it wasn't you who
                    told me.  

                                      CATHERINE
                    I was working the story.  I like to
                    keep things close.  For good reason.

                                      KENNETH
                    Well, I like to know what's going on
                    in my bureau.  Whatever you've done
                    in the past, from now on you WILL
                    tell me when you're working a story,
                    or I will find someone who understands
                    how this works.

58INT. SAM'S OFFICE -- NIGHT58

      Catherine enters looking very serious.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Promise me it wasn't you.

                                    SAM
                    What are we talking about?              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            60.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Someone told Donnegan about Tanya. 
                    You, me, and Jake were the only ones
                    who knew.

                                    SAM
                    Don't forget Rick Warden and whoever
                    else he told.  And Ewing.  And Tanya. 
                          (sensing the anger)
                    No, of course it wasn't me honey. 
                    I'm on your side. 

                                      CATHERINE
                    Thanks Sam.  Good job today.  

                                    SAM
                    You going to be ok?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Yeah.  I'm going to go talk to Jake.

                                    SAM
                    You know, one of these days you're
                    going to have to tell him how you
                    really feel.

      Catherine is stopped cold by this, but before she can speak
      Priya comes running in, she's on the phone.  Priya mouths the
      words "my mom."  Priya puts her hand over the phone.

                                      PRIYA
                    Hold on mom.
                          (to Sam)
                    She got Mrs. Kumar.  We're in.

                                    SAM
                    Let's go.

                                      PRIYA
                    Now?

                                    SAM
                    We're reporters.  It's always now. 

                                      PRIYA
                    Mom, we're picking you up in five.

59INT. KENNETH'S OFFICE -- EVENING59

      Sam enters, she's got her coat on, on her way out.

                                    SAM
                    Hey it looks like we got Roopika
                    Kumar's mother to sit down with us. 
                    Might make a nice piece.               ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            61.

                                      KENNETH
                    Twice in one day you've got my
                      attention.  That's pretty impressive.

                                    SAM
                    Just a little hard work paying off.

                                      KENNETH
                    Well, I'm impressed. 

                                    SAM
                    That was the idea.

                                      KENNETH
                    Thanks for the tip off on this business
                    with Ewing's daughter.  I think that's
                    going to work out nicely. 

                                    SAM
                    Well.  I'm a team player.

                                      KENNETH
                    I'm just glad you play for me now.

      Sam can't help a big smile.  Something about this guy.  Kenneth
      gives her a mischievous smile that isn't a hundred percent
      professional. 

60INT. JAKE'S OFFICE -- EVENING60

      The newsroom is empty.  Jake and Catherine are alone. 

                                      CATHERINE 
                    Tell me I did the right thing.

                                    JAKE
                    I think I would have run it.  But I'm
                    not you... and I'm not exactly known
                    for my judgment.  Who do you think
                    leaked it to Donnegan?

                                      CATHERINE
                    Who knows.  Clearly Warden wanted it
                    out.  He'll give it to someone else. 

                                    JAKE
                    But maybe finding Tanya first gave
                    Ewing time - tipped him off that this
                    was coming.  Let him prepare.

                                      CATHERINE
                    I wish sometimes I was that person. 
                    The one who does whatever it takes. 
                    The one who doesn't care.  Who doesn't
                    angst about some fantasy of journalism.

                                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    Some throwback.  Sometimes I want... 
                    I want to be Sam.

                                    JAKE
                    I like you better.

                                      CATHERINE
                    It sucks.

                                    JAKE
                    Yeah.  Let's get out of here.

                                      CATHERINE
                    You go.  I've got to hatch some
                    brilliant new plan.

      Jake leaves.  Catherine sits.  Starts to cry, stops herself.

                                      CATHERINE (CONT'D)
                    Damn you Holly Hunter.

61INT. KYLE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT61

      Kyle watches TV in his underwear, drinking a beer.  Lauren
      enters, stands behind him for a few seconds, gathering strength
      for this.

                                      LAUREN
                    Nice work finding Ewing.

                                    KYLE
                    Yeah, wasn't me.  Five days as White
                    House correspondent and they won't
                    even let me cover the White House.

      Kyle turns off the TV.  She's all warmth and kindness.  Steps
      close to him and puts her hand on his arm.

                                      LAUREN
                    You ok?

                                    KYLE
                    I guess.  Listen, I've been thinking. 
                    I want you to know that I love you...
                    but I don't think we can do this.

                                      LAUREN
                    Which this?  This relationship or
                    this baby?

                                    KYLE
                    You're not really considering having
                    this child?  That's insane.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            63.

                                      LAUREN
                    It's not what I had planned, but some
                    plans are meant to be changed.

                                    KYLE
                    But, but... your administration is
                    totally pro-choice! 

                                      LAUREN
                    This is not a political decision.

                                    KYLE
                    This is your real life you're talking
                    about.  Your career!  My career!

                                      LAUREN
                      I understand the situation.  Forget
                    the politics.  I'm 34 years old, and
                    very much in love.  I have the means
                    to support a child.  And I know what
                      I believe.  It's simple really.

      Tears run down her face.  Kyle struggles to contain himself.

                                    KYLE
                    You think giving birth to a child out
                    of wedlock is simple?  I don't know
                    what world you're living in.

                                      LAUREN
                    I'm living in a world in which the
                    hard right trumps the easy wrong.

                                    KYLE
                    This isn't some civics lesson!  You're
                    going to destroy your career, and
                    mine!  I can't let you do this!

      Lauren heads for the door.  She stops, turns to face him.

                                      LAUREN
                    I'll do what I have to do, and you do
                    what you have to do.  I know you're
                    scared, but you'll be ok.

                                    KYLE
                    Please don't do this.  You have no
                    idea what it takes for a black man to
                    get where I've gotten.  Don't take it
                    away from me.

      At this Lauren turns cold.  Her face hardens.              ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            64.

                                      LAUREN
                    No one puts a silver spoon in the
                    mouths of little white girls from
                    South Jersey.  You're a big boy.  Act
                    like it.

      She's gone.  Kyle looks ready to explode.  He whips his beer
      at the closed door shattering glass across the room.

      Suddenly, we cut to an exterior view of Kyle's apartment lit
      up in the black night.  A pull out reveals a TELEPHOTO LENS
      perched on the roof of the building across the street.  A man
      dressed in black is packing his photo gear into a bag.

62INT. SUBURBAN HOME -- NIGHT62

      Priya and Sam, and PRIYA'S MOM are at the door of a modest
      suburban home.

                                      PRIYA
                    You ready mom?
                          (off mom's nod)
                    I don't know why I'm so nervous.

                                    SAM
                    It's a strange job - waltzing into
                    the worst moment in someone's life. 
                          (with a resigned look)
                    She's just a regular person. And
                    probably a very sad one.  

      Sam rings the doorbell.  A small middle aged Indian woman in
      a modest sari opens the door for them. 

                                    MRS. KUMAR
                    Shubh sandhya.  Priya?

                                      PRIYA
                    Yes, Mrs. Kumar.  Thank you for letting
                    us come.

                                      PRIYA'S MOTHER
                    Shubh sandhya shrimati Kumar.

                                    SAM
                    We're so sorry...

      Before Sam has time to continue Mrs. Kumar turns and heads
      inside.  Sam and Priya and Priya's mom follow. 

63INT. ROOPIKA KUMAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT63

      The four enter the room of a typical 16 year-old girl.  There
      are posters of Zac Efron and Taylor Swift.  The bedspread is
      pink.  Both Priya and Sam are caught off guard by the
        childishness in the room.  A softball trophy.                ROBBINS   INSIDE THE BOX   PILOT    1/21/09            65.

      A picture of best friends. That girl on TV just became real.

      Mrs. Kumar and Priya's mom are speaking softly in Hindi. 
      Mrs. Kumar starts to cry a little and Priya's mother puts her
      arm around Mrs. Kumar leads her out.  Priya follows, leaving
      Sam alone in Roopika's bedroom. 

      Sam picks up a picture of the innocent faced Roopika.  Standing
      alone here, overwhelmed by the enormity of her day, and the
      cost of who and what she has become, Sam starts to cry.

64EXT. THE WATERING HOLE -- NIGHT64

      Catherine walking home alone, passing the Watering Hole.  She
      stops outside, thinking.  She sees Molly, Jake and others in
      a bar drinking.  Jake leans into Molly in a way that makes
      the attraction clear.  Catherine knows that look in Jake, and
      now she can't leave.  She makes for the door.

65INT. THE WATERING HOLE -- NIGHT65

      Catherine enters the bar, where she is warmly greeted.  After
      all, these are her people.  Catherine crosses over to Jake
      and Molly.  She sits down right between them.  Jake sits up
      straighter now that she's crashed his party.

                                    JAKE
                      Chardonnay?

      Catherine nods and Jake goes to get the bartender's attention.

                                      CATHERINE
                    Cheers kid.  Nice job today.  Don't
                    worry about Sam stealing your thunder. 
                    Good hard work is its own reward.  

                                      MOLLY
                    Thanks.

                                      CATHERINE
                    And don't lose any sleep over Lisa,
                    she was headed for the overnight before
                    your little bathroom blunder.

                                      MOLLY
                    Oh.  Ok.

                                      CATHERINE
                    How do you feel about working the
                    Ewing confirmation hearings?

      Molly smiles. Through the bar window, the camera sees them
      all inside wrapped in a warm glow.  Laughing.
