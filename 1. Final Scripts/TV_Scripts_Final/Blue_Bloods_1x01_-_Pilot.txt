                                          TEASER

      FADE IN:

      Faint strains of MUSIC as, on a bright Autumn morning in New 
      York City, we visit four generations of THE REAGAN FAMILY 
      getting ready for what is clearly a special day.  

      In BAY RIDGE, BROOKLYN, in a fine old house, in a bedroom 
      fixed in time five years ago when the woman of the house 
      died, widower MICHAEL REAGAN, a vibrant 50-something, buttons 
      his crisp white shirt as he heads into the hall, stopping a 
      few doors down to find his father, PATRICK REAGAN, late 70 s, 
      also in shirtsleeves, buffing his dress shoes.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Boat leaves in ten minutes, Dad.

                                    PATRICK
                    I ve never been late in my life.

      Michael heads back to his room, while...

      Notes of MUSIC are heard again as, in an apartment elsewhere 
      in Bay Ridge, ERIN REAGAN-BOYLE, 35, in tailored suit and 
      heels, is gathering case folders off her unmade bed when 
      daughter NICKY, a precocious 14, enters, skirt way too short. 

                                  NICKY
                    I can t find my Ipod.

                                  ERIN
                    Kitchen.  And the skirt?

      Meaning: no way.  Nicky goes as Erin slips case folders into   
      her briefcase and we see the official seal they bear: OFFICE 
      OF THE NEW YORK CITY DISTRICT ATTORNEY.  

      Darkness, then light as a door is opened and we find 
      ourselves in a closet in STATEN ISLAND into which steps BRIAN 
      REAGAN, 37, a burdened man in a rumpled suit.  He opens a 
      small safe and CAMERA MOVES IN on its contents: a watch, a 
      few medals and finally a lapel pin in the shape of a knight, 
      enameled in dark blue.  Brian reaches in and pulls out a 
      police service revolver, is slipping it into the holster 
      beneath his jacket when his wife LINDA comes to the bedroom 
      door with SEAN, 6, and JACK, 9, in tow. 

                                  LINDA
                    Brian?  Honey?  You know the 
                      Verranzano at this hour...                                                                                      2.


                                  BRIAN
                    So let s roll.

      As Brian puts a smile on his face and heads out after them...

      We return to Michael Reagan, now in the jacket of the dress 
      uniform of the NYPD, checking himself in the mirror: a 
      handsome man with an offhand confidence and a chest full of 
      medals.  He straightens his tie, adjusts his cuffs, is about 
      to leave when the array of photos on the bureau stops him.

      Our gaze moves with his to a family portrait with everyone 
      we ve met and a few we haven t: a younger Erin (she was a 
      serious girl then and she s a serious girl now); one with 
      Brian, Linda and the kids, and another of Michael with his 
      arm around his beautiful wife, Mary Margaret.  Michael s hand 
      comes briefly to rest atop the photo, then moves to one of a 
        good-looking young man in an NYPD uniform, his middle son 
      Joe, who died in the line of duty at 32, a year ago.  Michael  
      spends a moment with the photo, then sets it down and picks 
      up the next, this one bringing a smile to his face and we 
      hear the MUSIC again, the tune becoming familiar, as...   

      C.U. PHOTO: JAMIE REAGAN, Michael s youngest son in cap and 
      gown graduating from Harvard.  Now the photo comes magically 
      to life, the face ages to 27 and the mortar morphs into the 
      cap of a New York City police officer checking his gig-line 
      in the mirror of a chic PARK SLOPE bedroom.  Now we see as 
      well a beautiful young woman in a sexy bustier and panties, 
      hands behind her back, step into view behind Jamie s 
      reflection, his fiancee SYDNEY EVERSOLE, 26.  

                                  SYDNEY
                     scuse me, officer, aren t you 
                      forgetting something?

      He looks at her quizzically.  She smiles and brings out a 
      pair of handcuffs.  They smile at each other in the mirror 
      and CAMERA MOVES IN on Jamie as he goes serious and adjusts 
      his cap and now the MUSIC kicks in for real and we realize 
      that all along it s been the opening bars of  New York, New 
      York,  which we now hear Frank Sinatra begin to sing...

                                  SONG
                     Start spreading the news/I m 
                    leaving today./I want to be a part 
                    of it/New York, New York...

      Now other SOUNDS rise, MARCHING FEET and deafening CHEERS and 
      APPLAUSE as Jamie s reflection morphs into one MARCHING 
      FORWARD into...                                                                                        3.


      ...MADISON SQUARE GARDEN.  And we see that he is one of a 
      thousand and one new police recruits, a sea of blue, surging 
      onto the floor from gates beneath the stands, an awesome show 
      of power and youthful optimism both...  

                                  SONG (CONT D)
                     I want to wake up/In a city that 
                    never sleeps/And be king of the 
                    hill/Top of the heap...

      ...as they enter and fill the aisles and file into row after 
      row of seats on the Garden floor, friends and family in the 
      stands go nuts, CHEERING and APPLAUDING, hundreds of cameras 
      FLASHING like fireflies, the crowd s ROAR all but drowning 
      out the music the cadets march to, whose sentiment gives 
      voice to the feeling in their hearts and the swagger in their 
      step until they stop at attention at their seats... 

                                  SONG (CONT D)
                     If I can make it there/I ll make 
                    it anywhere/It s up to you/New 
                    York, New York! 

      SONG ENDS and at a signal, the cadets SIT in unison.  The 
      vast room quiets, all settle and the new policemen lift their 
      faces to listen to an orator on the echoing loudspeakers.

                                  ORATOR (V.O.)
                    It is with profound praise and 
                    gratitude that we welcome you new 
                    recruits here today...

      PAN ACROSS the rapt faces, resting on Jamie, proudest of all.

                                  ORATOR (V.O.)
                    ...proud that you have answered the 
                    call to service and today join the 
                    ranks of New York s finest. 

      ON THE DAIS, we see that the orator is in fact Michael 
      Reagan, Chief of Police, on the Jumbotron above him in lights 
      the NYPD shield and its motto,  Fidelis ad Mortem,  faithful 
      unto death.  Ranged on the stage behind Michael are city 
      officials and brass, among them Patrick Reagan in dress 
      uniform, like his son Michael, decorated to the max.

                                    MICHAEL REAGAN
                    You have earned the distinction of 
                    being the best trained and best 
                    prepared police officers in the 
                    world, ready to serve and protect 
                    the most vibrant city in the 
                    world...                                                                                      4.


      INTERCUT AS NEEDED - A BRONX STREET 

      Where Catholic school lets out and TERESA CAMPOS, 9, in her 
      plaid uniform, knee sox and little backpack, peels from her 
      friends and heads home past the corner bodega, the panaderia, 
      the KFC in her modest, working class neighborhood. 

                                  MICHAEL REAGAN  (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ...in one of the most demanding 
                    policing environments anyplace, 
                    anywhere.  To whom every day brings 
                    the responsibility of keeping all 
                    New Yorkers safe from crime and the 
                    threat of terrorism.  And though 
                    the city is on the very cutting 
                    edge of technology, nothing 
                    replaces your eyes and ears on the 
                    street...

      Teresa continues down the sidewalk, but we lose sight of her 
      when she goes behind a parked WHITE VAN.  She does not 
      reappear on the other side.

                                  MICHAEL REAGAN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ...and we remain safe because of 
                    the hard work and dedication of the 
                    men and women of the New York City 
                    Police Department.  Congratulations 
                    to your families, your friends...

      CAMERA WHIPS AROUND to the curb side of the van in time to 
    see 

      C.U.: A gloved hand over the girl s mouth, her frightened 
      eyes as she struggles mightily and the van door pulls shut.  

                                  MICHAEL REAGAN (V.O.) (CONT D)
                    ...and congratulations to you, our 
                    new New York City police officers!    

    As the van careens away, we HEAR the academy graduation s 
      LOUD ROAR of CHEERS and APPLAUSE, and now SEE, SUPERIMPOSED, 
    in SLO MO, a blizzard of white gloves as they re tossed into 
    the air by the cadets and float like fat snowflakes slowly 
      down.

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

                           END OF TEASER                                                                                      5.


                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONCOURSE - DAY

      Michael ushers Patrick, on his cane, through throngs of 
      people pressing towards the bright doorways leading outside. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    You okay in all this, Pop?

                                    PATRICK
                    I m not an invalid, I had a hip 
                      replacement. 

      As they move forward, many people nod and make way, some 
      snapping a little salute, saying,  Chief  to one or the other 
      of the two Reagan men, Patrick drawing an older crowd.  
      Patrick raises his chin to one such man --

                                    PATRICK (CONT D)
                    How you doing, Billy?  Sorry to 
                    hear about Louise.

      They push through the doors to --

      EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

      Euphoria outside where crisp morning has become golden 
      afternoon.  Newly-minted police officers are surrounded, 
      backs are slapped, hugs and kisses abound. 

                                    PATRICK
                    How the hell are we gonna find 
                    anybody in this mess?

      Erin steps out of the crowd and waves to Michael.

                                  ERIN
                    Dad!  Over here!  

      By Erin s side, Patrick spies Nicky, plugged into her iPod, 
      impervious. 

                                    PATRICK
                    She leave the rest of that dress at 
                    home?

                                  ERIN
                    And this is an improvement.                                                                                      6.


      They now reach Brian, Linda and the boys gathered there on 
      the sidewalk with Jamie and Sydney, now dressed in a tasteful 
      business suit.  Michael rests his hand on Jamie s shoulder.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m so proud of you, Jamie.  

                                  JAMIE
                    Thanks, Dad.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Good thing Mom s dead, it d kill 
                    her, you quitting the law and 
                    becoming a cop. 

                                  LINDA
                    Brian!

                                  BRIAN
                    Well, it s true, the golden boy was 
                    supposed to be on a fast track all 
                    the way to Washington.  Now look at 
                    him, a boot in a suit.

                                  JAMIE
                    Don t bust my chops, Brian.

                                  ERIN
                    Anyway, we still have a lawyer in 
                    the family.  Me?  

                                  BRIAN
                    And we re proud of you, Sis.  
                    Really.

      Erin gives him a playful shove.

                                  LINDA
                    We d have another one if these two 
                    would set a date.

      Meaning Jamie and Sydney, who doesn t skip a beat.  

                                  SYDNEY
                    And spoil all the fun?

                                  JAMIE
                    We ve got enough going on right now 
                    with me changing careers.

      Under which, a crusty OLD RETIRED COP comes up.                                                                                      7.


                                  OLD RETIRED COP
                    Nice speech, Mikey.  But here s the 
                    guy who could raise the rafters.  
                    Isn t that right, Pat?

      He claps Patrick on the back.

                                    PATRICK
                    Callahan, you old fart.  

                                  JACK
                    Mom, did he say  fart? 

                                  OLD RETIRED COP
                    You ll be a fine chief, Mikey, like 
                    your old man here.  Just don t let 
                    them play politics with you like 
                    they did with him.  And that bum 
                    they replaced him with.  It was a 
                    damn shame, Pat.  Everybody thinks 
                    so.

      Callahan moves off.

                                    PATRICK
                    He was a horse s ass then and he s 
                    a horse s ass now.

      Everyone laughs except Linda, who doesn t like the blue 
      language.  Under which, MARIA ROMANO, a pretty new recruit in 
      uniform, comes up to Jamie.

                                  MARIA
                    Hey, Reagan, we made it!  
                          (to Michael)
                      Congratulations, Chief Reagan. 

                                  JAMIE
                    Dad, this is Officer Romano.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    I know who she is.  First woman 
                    recruit to win the sharpshooter 
                    medal.  Well done.  

                                  MARIA
                    Thank you, sir.  Just wanted to say 
                    hello. -- You must be Sydney, 
                    right?

                                  SYDNEY
                      Congratulations.                                                                                      8.


                                  MARIA
                    Thanks.

      Sydney now on the alert: who is this anyway?  Maria smiles at 
      her, sizing her up, giving nothing.  Then, to Jamie --

                                  MARIA (CONT D)
                    See you around, Reagan. 

      Maria goes.  Jamie feels caught somehow.

                                  JAMIE
                    She won the sharpshooter medal.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Your father said.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Well, the gang s all here, we 
                    should be getting over to O Dells.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Sorry but second-year associates 
                    don t get lunch.  I m lucky they 
                    let me out for this.  It was 
                    amazing.

                                  JAMIE
                    I ll get you a cab.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Subway s quicker.  Stay with your 
                    family.  Bye everybody.   

      She gives Jamie a smooch and goes. 

                                  ERIN
                    She seems to be handling this 
                    pretty well, you being a cop.

      Under which, Brian s cell rings and he moves off to answer.

                                  LINDA
                    Can t be easy after watching you 
                    bury your brother.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Joe died doing what he loved to do, 
                    Linda.  Being a policeman.   

      Quiet settles on the family as always at the mention of Joe.  
      And the spectre of cop-death.  Now SONNY MALEVSKI, 37, comes 
      up, Brioni suit, Rolex watch.                                                                                      9.


                                  SONNY
                    Jeez, kid, in those blues, you look 
                    just like your brother Joe.

                                  JAMIE
                    Thanks, we were just talking about 
                    him.

                                  SONNY
                    Awful.  I m Sonny Malevsky.  Joe 
                    was up in the 77th with us.

      Brian returns, shutting his phone, not happy to see Sonny.

                                  BRIAN
                    Sonny, what are you doing here?

                                  SONNY
                    Hello to you too.

                                  JAMIE
                    Your nephew was in my class, right?

                                  SONNY
                    Anyway, I was just leaving. -- Be 
                    careful out there, kid.

      Sonny moves off.

                                    PATRICK
                    Quite the peacock, your friend.

                                  BRIAN
                    Friend?  I wouldn t say that.
                          (to Jamie)
                    Anyway, sorry, bro, but I ll have 
                    to buy you that beer later.  We ve 
                    got a missing kid.  

                                    MICHAEL
                      Missing... where?

                                  BRIAN
                    The Bronx.  My partner s around 
                    here somewhere. 
                          (to Linda)
                    Sorry.  I ll call you later.

      An unmarked Crown Vic pulls up, DEMARCUS KING, an African 
      American ex-jock, mid-30 s, at the wheel.  He leans over and 
      waves to everyone as Brian heads to the car.  Michael and 
      Patrick look after, maybe a little wistful, remembering their 
      days on the front lines.                                                                                       10.


                                  JACK
                    Grandpa, can I ride up front with 
                    the driver? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    You bet.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CROWN VIC - SAME TIME 

      As Brian gets in and settles...

                                  BRIAN
                    Little girl, I don t like the sound 
                    of it.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Glass half empty much?  She could 
                    turn up at a friend s house.

                                  BRIAN
                    Then why d they call us?

      Demarcus pulls out into traffic and they take off.

      EXT. BRONX STREET - DAY

      The bodega, the panaderia, the KFC.  An already active crime 
      scene where the little girl went missing: police cars, CID 
      with gloves and crime kits, cops with notebooks, interviewing   
      onlookers, some of whom record the scene on cell phones and 
      digital devices.  MR. and MRS. CAMPOS, parents of the missing 
      child, Hispanic, 30 s, huddle together on a stoop, a female 
      officer with them.  Brian and Demarcus pull up and head in as 
      a uniformed supervisor LIEUTENANT MANNATO comes to meet them. 

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Smile for the cameras, Brian.

                                  BRIAN
                          (through a clenched smile, 
                          to Mannato)
                    So what have we got?

      As they walk into the scene, Mannato fills them in.                                                                                      11.


                                  LT. MANNATO
                      Nine-year-old girl, Teresa Campos, 
                    didn t come home from school -- St. 
                    Agnes up the block -- and the 
                    mother there got worried and went 
                    looking for her and the bodega 
                    owner told her he saw a couple 
                    young boys grab a pink backpack 
                    from the gutter here and run off 
                    with it.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    The backpack hers?

                                  BRIAN
                          (off Lt s nod)
                    We find the kids?

                                  LT. MANNATO
                    Not yet.

                                  BRIAN
                    Anybody see anything else?

      They arrive at an officer in latex gloves with a life-like 
      baby doll in diapers that he s collected for evidence.

                                  LT. MANNATO
                    This doll was found near where the 
                    backpack was.  One of those ones 
                    you press it and it talks.

      He nods to the officer, who squeezes the doll. 

                                    MECHANICAL DOLL
                    Change me!  I m wet! 

      The eerie doll voice briefly unsettles them.

                                  LT. MANNATO
                    Anyway, the mother said she d never 
                    seen it before. 

                                  BRIAN
                    Book it, put prints and serology on 
                    it.  Get an Amber Alert out right 
                    away and a canine unit here asap. 
                    Clear all the apartment dumpsters, 
                    mailboxes in the area, also the 
                    drains and sewers.  Just don t let 
                    them see what you re doing.  

      Meaning the parents.  Brian and Demarcus head for them.                                                                                    12.


                                  DEMARCUS
                    Know that feeling you had?  I m 
                    getting it too.

      They reach the parents on the stoop.  Brian nods to the 
      officer with them, who moves away.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Mr. and Mrs. Campos, I m Detective 
                    Reagan and this is Detective King.  
                    We understand your daughter didn t 
                    come home from school and we need 
                    to ask you a few questions.  

                                  MR. CAMPOS
                    She always comes home.  She comes 
                    home every day.  She knows her 
                    mother worries.

                                  MRS. CAMPOS
                          (through tears)
                    She s a good girl!

                                  DEMARCUS
                    I m sure she is.  I know how 
                    difficult this must be for you.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Any chance she might have run away?  
                    You had a fight?  Or maybe an ex-
                    husband may have taken her...?  

                                  MRS. CAMPOS
                    Pablo is her father!  There was no 
                    fight!  Where is she?  You have to 
                    find her!

                                  DEMARCUS
                    The more you tell us, the more we 
                    can help.  Do you have any family 
                    in the area?    

      Under which, Lt. Mannato has come up to Brian.

                                  LT. MANNATO
                      Detective?  I talk to you?  

      Demarcus stays behind as we move off with Brian and Mannato.

                                  LT. MANNATO (CONT D)
                    Woman there saw a white van pull 
                    away from the curb here really 
                    crazy.                                                                                      13.


                                  BRIAN
                    White van in New York City?  That 
                    narrows it down.

                                  LT. MANNATO
                    Yeah, I know.  She didn t get the 
                    plates either, but she said it had 
                    a cracked back window.

                                  BRIAN
                    Put an APB on the van, maybe we ll 
                    get lucky.  Because this isn t a 
                    simple custodial dispute and it 
                    sure ain t for ransom.   

      Brian returns to Demarcus and Teresa s parents, shakes his 
      head when Demarcus looks at him to see if he got a lead.  

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Reagan, we ve got another problem.   
                    The girl is diabetic.  She needs 
                    insulin every 24 hours.  And if she 
                    doesn t get it... 

      All know what he means.  Mrs. Campos grabs Brian s arm.

                                  MRS. CAMPOS
                    My baby!  Please, please help 
                    us!!!!!

      On this tableau...

      INT. POLICE PLAZA HQ - CHIEF S OFFICE - THURSDAY NIGHT

      On the wall a bank of security monitors surveil the city: 
      Times Square, West Side Highway....  Tie loosened, Michael s 
      at his desk dialing his phone as an Aide comes in to retrieve 
      files from the out-box at Michael s nod.

                          (on phone)
                    So what s going on?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. PRECINCT SQUAD ROOM - SAME TIME 

      Place is buzzing with cops and hookers, drunks, petty crooks, 
      but the main buzz is the cackle of the police radio and 
      phones ringing off the hook on the missing girl s tip line, 
      manned by a special task force headed up by Brian and 
      Demarcus, both of them now on their phones.                                                                                    14.


                                  BRIAN
                    I won t be watching the Knicks game 
                    tonight.

      INTERCUT 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Long as you know you ve got all the 
                    resources you need.  

                                  BRIAN
                       ppreciate it, Chief.  I ll keep 
                    you posted.

      Brian and Demarcus each hang up their phones.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    What s up?

                                  BRIAN
                    I think that was a motivational 
                    call from my old man. 
                          (of Demarcus s phone call)
                    That anything?

                                  DEMARCUS
                    A white van with a little girl in 
                    Astoria, but it was just an Asian 
                    family.  And I got more bad news.  
                    The little girl s sketchy uncle has 
                    an airtight alibi.  The dude s 
                    locked up on Rikers Island for 
                    petty larceny. 

      Brian goes to a pin-board where Teresa s picture is posted 
      along with two columns, one  suspects cleared,  and one 
         possibles.   He moves a  possible  to  cleared.   

                                  BRIAN
                    And I had such high hopes for him.

      A PROFESSOR comes in, tweeds, bookbag.  

                                  PROFESSOR
                    Excuse me!  My name is Professor 
                    Robert Jordan!  I know where the 
                    missing little girl is!
                          (all eyes on him now)
                    She s been transferred to Earth s 
                    sister planet in the Andromeda 
                    Galaxy as of 22 hundred hours 
                    according to my last communique!

      Laughter as a COP comes to usher him out.                                                                                    15.


                                  COP
                    We ll launch a rocket to check that 
                    out, sir.

      More laughter, but the mood quickly sinks.

                                  BRIAN
                    I keep thinking about that little 
                    girl.  How terrified she must be.   

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Looks like it could be a long 
                    night. 

                                  BRIAN
                    Better let the wife know I ll be 
                    bedding down here...

      On Brian as he picks up his phone ...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. IRAQ DESERT - CHECKPOINT OUTSIDE BAGHDAD - DAY

      Oppressive HEAT and GLARE.  U.S. soldiers in desert fatigues 
      guard a gate, a long line of cars shimmering into the 
      distance as soldiers check under cars examine papers.

      Suddenly, a car down the line pulls out and speeds towards 
      the checkpoint.  A few soldiers signal the car to halt.  It 
      stops for a moment.  Then starts towards them again.

      Warning shots are fired into the air.  But the car continues 
      forward.  We see now that one of the soldiers is Brian, a 
      captain.  Caught now in a horrible moment of split-second 
      decision, Brian lifts his M-15 and fires repeatedly at the 
      car which now KAROOMS into a ditch.  Dust rises and starts to 
      settle as soldiers run up.

      Inside is a family, an IRAQI MOTHER and Father crying, both 
        miraculously alive.  But the mother cradles a bloody, 
      lifeless Boy, 4, clutching a teddy bear.

                                  IRAQI MOTHER
                    My boy was sick!  We were trying to 
                    get to the hospital!

      On Brian s anguish...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    16.


      INT. DETECTIVE S BREAK ROOM - PRE-DAWN - FRIDAY MORNING

      Asleep on the couch, Brian s eyes slam open.  He sits up and 
      tries to shake his recurrent nightmare.  It takes a moment 
      for him to know where he is.  Then a thought dawns.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. PRECINCT SQUAD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Brian hurries in.  Clock says three, a skeleton crew here 
      now.  And Demarcus, shirtsleeves rolled up, take-out detritus 
      on his (and Brian s) desk, finishing a phone call.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    We do appreciate the call, Ma am.
                          (hanging up, to Brian)
                    Another nothing.  You sleep?

                                  BRIAN
                    We need the doll.

      Brian heads for the evidence lockers.  Demarcus catches up.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Why?  The lab didn t get anything 
                    off it.  No prints, no DNA.

                                  BRIAN
                    Well, that s just it.  If it 
                    belonged to some other little girl, 
                    why not?  Why was it so clean?

                                  DEMARCUS
                          (seeing it)
                    Because the creep used it as bait 
                    to lure the girl in.

      Brian opens the evidence locker.

                                  BRIAN
                    Must be a label or stamp on here.  
                    We see who makes it and where they 
                    sell it, maybe this talking doll 
                    can tell us something.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. PRECINCT SQUAD ROOM - LATER

      Brian and Demarcus at Brian s desk with the doll, Brian on 
      the phone, on hold.                                                                                    17.


                                  BRIAN
                    Had to be made in China, right?  
                    They re looking for someone who 
                    speaks English.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    What is it, tomorrow there?  Or 
                      yesterday?

                                  BRIAN
                          (into phone)
                    Yeah, Detective Reagan, New York 
                    Police.  Your Dolly Change Me doll, 
                    I need you to tell me where it s 
                    sold in the Eastern United States.
                          (then, stopped cold)
                    What?  Are you sure?
                          (then)
                    Ma am, I need to know the names and 
                    addresses of anyone who had access 
                    to one of these dolls.  No, I don t 
                    have time for you to call me back.  
                    Put me on hold, I ll wait.
                          (then, to Demarcus)
                    We just hit pay-dirt.  The doll s a 
                      prototype, it s not even for sale 
                    yet.  The haystack just got 
                    smaller.

      On Brian and Demarcus, with new hope...

                                                                          FADE OUT:

      INT. UNMARKED CROWN-VIC - MOVING - EARLY FRIDAY MORNING  

      Through East Village alphabet streets.  Demarcus at the 
      wheel, Brian on his cell as they pull up to a dingy tenement.

                                  BRIAN
                    Okay, thanks --
                          (closes cell)
                    -- for nothing.  They found the 
                    U.N. delegate that had one of the 
                    three sample dolls, but she s been 
                    in Shanghai for the past week.         

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Looks like doll number two s a real 
                    urban pioneer.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Rats in Staten Island live better

      EXT. EAST VILLAGE - CONTINUOUS 

      Brian and Demarcus go to the basement door and position 
      themselves on either side, hands inside their jackets on 
      their guns.  Demarcus knocks.  Then, from within --

                                  MAN S VOICE
                    Who is it?

                    New York City Police.  Please open 
                    the door, sir.  

      The door opens a crack to reveal SPENCER FRYE, a sallow 30, 
      in flannel pajama bottoms.

                                  BRIAN
                    Spencer Frye? 

                                    SPENCER FRYE
                    Yeah...?

                                  BRIAN
                    Step aside please.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    19.


      INT. BASEMENT TENEMENT - CONTINUOUS

      Brian and Demarcus enter the dank little place, bed unmade, 
      dishes piled in the sink.  As their eyes adjust and Demarcus 
      moves off to search --

                                  BRIAN
                    This is all the rooms?

                                    SPENCER FRYE
                    What are you doing?  You can t just 
                    barge in here.

      Under which, we and the detectives take in the weird scene, 
      every surface holding dolls of all description.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Man.

                                  BRIAN
                    Okay, where is it?

                                    SPENCER FRYE
                    What?

                                  BRIAN
                    The sample doll.  We know you got 
                    one.

                                    SPENCER FRYE
                    What doll?

                                  BRIAN
                    Don t get cute.  

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Reagan!

      Brian turns to see Demarcus holding up a doll in diapers.

                                  DEMARCUS (CONT D)
                    The doll.

                                    SPENCER FRYE
                    You can t take that!  I m not done 
                    with it yet!

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Be my guest.

      Demarcus tosses Frye the doll.                                                                                    20.


                                  BRIAN
                    Aren t you a little old to be 
                    playing with dolls?

                    I m a reviewer for Doll World 
                    Magazine.

      Frye examines the doll for damage as, shaking his head, Brian 
      heads out with Demarcus.

                                    SPENCER FRYE (CONT D)
                    Y know, you re not supposed to bust 
                    into people s places without a 
                    warrant!  I m gonna sue!

                                  BRIAN
                    Then get in line.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Doll number three?  The sales rep?

                    They found a Florida driver s 
                    license so at least now we have a 
                    picture of the guy and prints.

                    Florida?  Nothing up here but his

                    And we re running out of time.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Okay, a brief statement before I 
                    take questions.  I want to thank 
                    the media for keeping Teresa s face 
                    before the public.  Our task force 
                    has followed up on over 500 tips 
                    and I want to I assure you that the 
                    police department will not rest 
                    until we find this little girl.

                                  UNIVISION REPORTER
                    Chief Reagan, what do you say to  
                    blog allegations there s a third 
                    fewer police than on the Allie 
                      Dintenfass Amber Alert on the Upper 
                    East Side last summer?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Miguel, you re a professional 
                    reporter and you wanna give 
                    credence to any amateur blogger 
                    with a laptop and an axe to grind?  

                                  PADMA LAHARI
                    Then what s your response to polls 
                    that show a boroughs-wide lack of 
                    faith in police by the Latino 
                    community and a slow and steady 
                    rise in crime there?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Since I ve been on the job, those 
                    stats are down across the board.

                                  PADMA LAHARI
                    Then you re saying that the mayor s 
                    budgetary cutbacks aren t affecting 
                    the department s ability to keep 
                    all citizens of this city safe?

                                    MICHAEL
                    All due respect, Miss Lahari, none 
                    of us is worried about cost today.    
                      A 9-year-old girl is missing, the 
                    clock is ticking and it s all about 
                    the recovery of Teresa.  Just make 
                    sure you media people do your part 
                    and keep her face in front of the 
                    public before you run off chasing 
                    Tiger Woods  latest girlfriend.

      On Padma, glaring at Michael...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    22.


      INT. POLICE PLAZA - ENTRY CONCOURSE - A SHORT TIME LATER

      Chief Reagan comes in to see Mayor FRANK RUSSO, a balls-out 
      70, waiting with a couple lackeys.  

                                  MAYOR
                    Caught the news conference.  Nice 
                    job.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Thanks, Mayor.  

                                  MAYOR 
                    You know, Mike, we gotta find this 
                    kid.  Alive.

                                    MICHAEL
                    We re doing everything we can.

                                  MAYOR
                    That better be good enough.  I hear 
                    your boy is lead detective.

                                    MICHAEL
                    If you mean Detective First Grade 
                    Brian Reagan, that s right.

                                  MAYOR
                    Think that s wise, Mike?  Could be 
                    exposing yourself to all kinds of 
                    scrutiny if it goes south.  You re 
                    popular with the public but I don t 
                    have to tell you you don t have a 
                    lot of friends in high places to 
                    back you up.

                                    MICHAEL
                      Truthfully, I don t spend a lot of 
                    time worrying about that.

                                  MAYOR
                    Well, maybe you should. 
                          (goes to leave, stops)
                    And another thing, that bit just 
                    now on TV about since you ve been 
                    chief and the crime stats 
                      decreasing?  There s no future in 
                    that kind of grandstanding.  Just 
                    ask your old man.

      The Mayor goes.  Michael looks coldly after.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    23.


      INT. PRECINCT SQUAD ROOM - DAY 

      The room is its daytime beehive of activity.  Demarcus works 
      his computer.  Brian hangs up the phone, discouraged.  

                                  BRIAN
                    There is no van in Ronald Banse s 
                    name, so if this is our guy he 
                    either stole it or bought it from a 
                    private party and didn t bother to 
                    register it.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Well, I just hit pay-dirt.  The 
                    house in Tampa is deeded in the 
                    wife s maiden name, Roberta Abele.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Yeah and...?

                                  DEMARCUS
                    She s a model citizen with a New 
                    York drivers license and an address 
                    in Lindenhurst, Long Island.

      They grab their jackets and fly out of there.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. PATROL CAR - MOVING - DAY

      SGT. ANTHONY RENZULLI, 40 s, drives, Jamie Reagan, shot-gun.  
      They ride in silence, Renzulli glancing at Jamie from time to 
      time, gauging him.  Then --    

                                  SGT RENZULLI
                    Y know, I was also your brother 
                    Joe s training officer when he was 
                    a new boot.

                                  JAMIE
                    No, I didn t know that.  No 
                    kidding?

      Renzulli hangs a right.

                                  SGT RENZULLI
                    Good guy, your brother.

                                  JAMIE
                    Yeah, he was.

      Another silence.                                                                                    24.


                                  SGT RENZULLI
                    I hear you went to Harvard.

                                  JAMIE
                    Law school.

                                  SGT RENZULLI
                    That right?  So what are you doing 
                    on the beat?  Seeing how the real 
                    people live?  Writing a book?

                                  JAMIE
                    It s in the blood I suppose.

                                  SGT RENZULLI
                    You know, Harvard, that s something 
                    we re gonna have to find out.

      Jamie looks out the window at the passing street. 

                                  SGT RENZULLI (CONT D)
                    Terrible thing about your brother.  
                    He was a great cop.

                                  JAMIE
                    It s gonna be hard to live up to.

                                  SGT RENZULLI
                    You got that right.   cause, you 
                    know, just  cause your old man s 
                    the chief I m not going to cut you 
                    any slack.  You re going to have to 
                    earn it just like everybody else.  

      In fact, Jamie s realizing it will be harder because he s a 
      Reagan.

                                  SGT RENZULLI (CONT D)
                    Now, your brother Brian, on the 
                    other hand...

                                  JAMIE
                    Brian s Brian.

                                  SGT RENZULLI
                    Harvard, I get the last word, okay? 

      A beat, then the radio cackles to life with a call 
      indecipherable to all but them.

                                  SGT RENZULLI (CONT D)
                    That s us.                                                                                    25.


      Sgt. Renzulli floors it and they take a corner really hard.  
      On Jamie, bracing himself --

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. BANSE/ABELE HOUSE - LINDENHURST - DAY

      Working-class.  Prefab houses, trim lawns, not a human in 
      sight.  Demarcus and Brian park, head for a corner house.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    I m not seeing a white van.

      They pass by the garage, Demarcus looks in.  Looks back to 
      Brian and shakes his head, signals he ll cover the back of 
      the house from there.  Brian nods, proceeds to the door, hand 
      inside his jacket on his gun.  From a position beside the 
      door, he reaches out and rings the bell.  

                                    WOMAN S VOICE 
                    Who is it?

                                  BRIAN
                    New York Police.

      The door opens a crack.  ROBERTA BANSE peers out, late-40 s, 
      a nervous woman in a housecoat and crucifix.

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    Can I help you?

      Brian shows his badge.

                                  BRIAN
                    We re looking for Ronald Banse.  
                    He s a sale rep for Happy Valley 
                    Toys?

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    Yes, but he s not here.

                                  BRIAN
                    Where is he then?

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    I don t know.

                                  BRIAN
                    You re his wife, aren t you?

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    We re separated and I m divorcing 
                    the bastard and I haven t seen him 
                    in months.  What is this about?                                                                                    26.


      Demarcus comes up, intercedes more gently.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Excuse me, Ma am, would you mind if 
                    we came in and took a look around?  
                    It s just procedure.  

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    Has he done something wrong?  What 
                    do you want him for?

      They brush by her and go inside.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. BANSE/ABELE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Brian heads to other rooms.  Demarcus stays with Mrs. Banse.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    He s a person of interest in a case 
                    we re investigating.    

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    Ronnie?

                                  DEMARCUS
                    When s the last time you spoke to 
                    him, Ma am?  Do you have any idea 
                    where we could find him?

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    I sent him a box of his winter 
                    clothes a couple weeks ago.

      Brian comes back.

                                  BRIAN
                    House is clear.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Can you tell us where you sent the 
                    clothes?

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    The Lincoln Inn in Yonkers, but I 
                    don t know if he s still there. 

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Thank you very much.

      And Brian and Demarcus are gone.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    27.


      EXT./INT. - CROWN VIC - MOVING - DAY

      Moving fast, Brian and Demarcus pass a no-man s land of gas 
      stations and light industry.  

                                  BRIAN
                    So what have we got?  A couple 
                    hours?

                                  DEMARCUS
                    If that.  Teresa s type one 
                    diabetes.  Insulin shock.  My aunt 
                    died of it.

                                  BRIAN
                    Up there on the right.

      EXT. LINCOLN INN - YONKERS - CONTINUOUS

      Flashing  vacancy,  half the neon gone.  The likeness of Abe 
      too has seen better days.  Demarcus and Brian whip into the 
      lot, are out of their car, scoping the scene. 

                                  DEMARCUS
                    No white van.

                                  BRIAN
                    Blue van.

      They trot up to it.  Brian takes his key and scrapes the 
      paint: fresh, white beneath.  Demarcus tries the doors, 
      locked, on his way to check the back window.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Lousy paint job.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    And the window s new.

                                  BRIAN
                    Not for long.

      Brian takes the butt of his gun and smashes the window, glass 
      confetti flying.  Demarcus watches for anyone running as 
      Brian reaches in, unlocks the door and throws it open.

      But no Teresa.  Instead, a clean and empty hollow -- except 
      for a few pink and white striped shopping bags.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Dammit.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    What s this?                                                                                    28.


      He means the shopping bags.  They exchange a look, then go 
      ahead and rip into the bags.  Inside a box tied with ribbon, 
      Demarcus finds a frilly little white dress.  

                                  DEMARCUS (CONT D)
                      A communion dress?  

      Brian opens a small box.

                                  BRIAN
                    Votive candles.
                          (then)
                    The good news is, he hasn t lit  em 
                    yet.

      They look to the motel, shut the van s door and head to the 
      motel office.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

      EXT. LINCOLN INN - YONKERS - MOMENTS LATER

      A wide shot as we see the Motel Manager with Brian and 
      Demarcus.  He s pointing to a unit on the second level.  
      Brian and Demarcus make for it.

      They run up the stairs and position themselves at either side 
      of the door, hands on their holstered weapons.  Brian knocks.  
      After a tense beat.

                                  MAN (O.S.)
                    Who is it?

                                  BRIAN
                    Police!  Open up!

      The door opens and there stands RONALD BANSE, 50, nothing 
      special, thinning hair, thick glasses.  He smiles pleasantly.

                                  RONALD BANSE
                    Yes?

                                  BRIAN
                    Where s the girl?

                                  RONALD BANSE
                    I don t know what you re talking 
                    about. 

                                  BRIAN
                    Then you don t mind if we come in.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    29.


      INT. LINCOLN INN - MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Brian and Demarcus come in to see a room in some disarray, 
      drawers open and clothes hurriedly tossed into suitcases on 
      the bed.  Brian stays with Banse as Demarcus searches.  

                                  RONALD BANSE
                    I d like to see your warrant.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    He s packing his bags.

                                  BRIAN
                    You going someplace?  Where s the 
                    girl?

                                  RONALD BANSE
                    What girl?

                                  BRIAN
                    You made a big mistake, buddy.  
                    When you snatched the girl you left 
                    one of your samples in the gutter. 
                    A doll.

                                  RONALD BANSE
                    A doll was stolen out of my van if 
                    that s what you mean.  I was giving 
                    it to my niece for her first 
                      communion.

                                  BRIAN
                    That why you had it painted and 
                    fixed the window?

                                  RONALD BANSE
                    I don t have to talk to you.  I 
                    know my rights.

                                  BRIAN
                    You don t know jack.  

      Brian grabs Banse, roughly spins him and cuffs him.

                                  RONALD BANSE
                    What are you doing?  Are you 
                    arresting me?

                                  DEMARCUS
                    You have the right to remain 
                    silent.  Anything you say may be 
                    held against you --                                                                                    30.


                                  RONALD BANSE
                    Fine, let s go downtown, my lawyer 
                    will get me out.
                          (then, with a smirk)
                    Then maybe I will go visit my 
                    little niece.

      That does it for Brian.  To Demarcus --

                                  BRIAN
                    D, get out of here and call it in.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    C mon, let s take him downtown. 

                                  BRIAN
                    We don t have time for that. 

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Buddy --

                                  BRIAN
                    Just get out of here, man!  Call it 
                    in! 

      Demarcus reluctantly goes.  Banse gets desperate.

                                  BANSE
                    Let me go!

                                  BRIAN
                    You re gonna tell me where that 
                    little girl is, scumbag!  

      Brian all but lifts him off the ground by his cuffed wrists 
      as he spirits him towards the bathroom. 

                                  BANSE
                    Ow!

                                  BRIAN
                    Oh, are they on too tight? 

      Banse struggles hard now as Brian throws him into the

      BATHROOM

      Banse scrambles to get a purchase with his leather soles on 
      the tiles as Brian s on him and grabs him.  

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Where is she?                                                                                      31.


                                  BANSE
                    Go to hell.

                                  BRIAN
                    Me?

      Brian grabs him by the hair and shoves his head in the toilet 
      and holds it down as he flushes it until Banse begins to 
      sputter and choke.  Brian yanks his head back.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    You had enough?  Where is she?

                                  BANSE
                          (gasping for air)
                    I don t know!

      Banse s screams are silenced as Brian again pushes his head 
      deep into the bowl.  This time he keeps Banse under water 
      until Banse starts to twitch, drowning.  It looks like he s 
      about to die when Brian pulls his head up.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Last chance.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CROWN VIC - MOVING 

      Siren wailing, Demarcus driving like a maniac, Brian bracing 
      himself against turns.  Banse is in back, messed up, hair 
      dripping, thrown around like a rag doll in the speeding car.  

                                  BANSE
                    Oh my God, I am heartly sorry for 
                    having offended Thee --

                                  BRIAN
                    Shut up.
                          (to Demarcus)
                    This storage locker we re going to,   
                    the name he said he rented it 
                    under?  Monsignor Nicholas.  Saint 
                    Nicholas, patron saint of children.   

      It sickens Brian and Demarcus.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. REMOTE STORAGE FACILITY - FRIDAY  

      The Crown Vic screeches up.  As Demarcus and Brian get out 
      and sprint to one of the storage containers, we HEAR SIRENS 
      nearing.  Demarcus unlocks a container, Brian runs into --                                                                                      32.


      THE CONTAINER

      In the dark he can make out the little girl in the corner, 
      bound and gagged, a shadow to us. 

                                  BRIAN
                    It s okay, Teresa.  You re safe 
                    now.

      OUTSIDE 

      Police cruiser, cops.  Also an ambulance with EMT s and a 
      physician.  Brian emerges with Teresa in his arms, her gag  
      pulled down, her arms around his neck.

                                  TERESA
                    Where s my mama?

                                  BRIAN
                    You re gonna see her real soon.    
                    These are doctors, they re going to 
                    take you to the hospital and your 
                    mama and papa will be there.   
                          (handing her to doctor)
                    She needs insulin immediately.

      Doctor knows, nods, and they take her to the ambulance.  
      Brian and Demarcus watch her go.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    We won one.

                                  BRIAN
                    She was the easy part.  

      He means Banse, whom they hear yelling as they move towards 
      the car.

                                  BANSE
                    Police brutality!  Torture! 

      On Brian, knowing he s in a world of trouble...

                                                                            FADE OUT

      JUDGE INEZ ORELLANA, Hispanic, 45, opens her door to Ron 
      Banse s Asian Public Defender, RICK LEE, 30, and Assistant

                    C mon in, take a seat.

      They sit, she faces them at her desk and opens a folder. 

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA (CONT D)
                    So, Mr. Lee, you have emergency

                                  P.D. LEE
                    Your honor, we have here a most 
                      outrageous instance of violation of 
                      a citizen s civil rights --

                    stuffed her into a dark storage 
                    locker and was preparing to do God 
                    knows what to her, Your Honor.

                    Your Honor --

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA
                          (staying him)
                    Mr. Lee.
                          (to Erin)
                    Let s hear Mr. Lee s motions, shall

                          (then)
                    But try to keep the hyperboles

                                  P.D. LEE
                    I have three motions, Your Honor.

                    To wit, the officers broke into a 
                    locked van and seized material 
                    without a warrant.

                                  ERIN
                    There were exigent circumstances to 
                    the van entry, Your Honor.  The 
                    officers had every reason to 
                    believe that the little girl was 
                    inside.

                                  P.D. LEE
                    I m talking about the packages of 
                    clothing, Your Honor.

                                  ERIN
                    The officers state the packages 
                    spilled their contents during the 
                    forced entry and search, Your 
                    Honor.

                                  P.D. LEE
                    Your Honor, they were secured with 
                    ribbon, so that s impossible.

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA
                    Go on.

                                  P.D. LEE
                    The second motion is a Huntley, 
                    that any statements my client may 
                    have made or any physical evidence 
                    were obtained by use of excessive 
                    force and are therefore 
                      inadmissable. 

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA
                    That s a serious allegation.

                                  P.D. LEE
                    I have photographs, Your Honor, 
                    taken at the time of arrest 

      He hands the Judge a sheaf of photos.  She looks through.

                                  ERIN
                    The officer contends that the 
                    accused was resisting arrest, Your 
                    Honor.

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA
                    That how his hair got wet?                                                                                    35.


                                  P.D. LEE
                    Your Honor, since all of the 
                    State s evidence is clearly 
                      inadmissible, our final motion is 
                    that the case be dismissed and Mr. 
                    Banse be immediately released from 
                    custody. 

                                  ERIN
                    No, Your Honor!  We have a Class A 
                    felon in custody!  We can t just 
                    cut him loose!     

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA
                    With no admissible evidence, we 
                    have no basis to hold him.

                                  ERIN
                    The State pleads for more time, 
                    Your Honor.  

                                  P.D. LEE
                    Your Honor --

      The judge holds her hand up to still them, to weigh things.  

                                  JUDGE ORELLANA 
                    We don t want this individual on 
                    the street.  But at the same time, 
                    an officer took the law into his 
                    own hands, which we cannot abide. 
                    This seems to be one of those rare 
                    instances where I actually get to 
                    be a judge.  
                          (then)
                    Well... we are looking at the 
                    weekend.  I m going to schedule a 
                    hearing on this case for Monday 
                      afternoon.  If the State can t 
                    marshal some legitimate evidence to 
                    indict by then, I ll have no choice 
                    but to let the accused go.

                                  ERIN
                    Thank you, Your Honor. 

      The Judge shuts the folder.  Erin and P.D. Lee get up and go. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Brian paces, clicking a pen.  Erin comes out of the elevator.                                                                                    36.


                                  BRIAN
                    What happened?

                                  ERIN
                    What happened?  It s a disaster, 
                    that s what.

      She keeps walking.  He keeps up.

                                  BRIAN
                    Stop with the dramatics.

      She stops and faces him.

                                  ERIN
                    What did you think you were doing?

                                  BRIAN
                    What was I doing?  Saving a little 
                    girl s life.

                                  ERIN
                    So this scumbag can go prey on some 
                    other little girl?  He s probably 
                    going to walk  cause you pissed all 
                    over evidence.

                                  BRIAN
                    We ve got the van in custody.  
                    SID s all over it for DNA and 
                    fibers. 

                                  ERIN
                    You better hope they find 
                      something.  Or you find something. 
                    And you have til Monday.

                                  BRIAN
                    Monday?

                                  ERIN
                    Because that s when they re going 
                    to let him go.  Because you crossed 
                    the line.

                                  BRIAN
                    Get off my case.

                                  ERIN
                    Just make my case, how s that?

      She storms off.  

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    37.


      INT. DETECTIVE S BREAK ROOM - SATURDAY AFTERNOON

      Brian sits at the table, dejected.  Looks up to see Michael 
      at the door, Demarcus with him.  Michael is dressed casually 
      in sports jacket and slacks.

                                  BRIAN
                    You heard already?

                                    MICHAEL
                    I came by to see how you were 
                    doing.  Demarcus just told me.  Not 
                    the best news.

      They come in.  Demarcus pours himself a coffee.

                                  BRIAN
                    SID said the van was vacuumed and 
                    scoured with bleach.  Not a fiber, 
                    not a hair.

                                    MICHAEL
                    The guy really knew how to cover 
                    his tracks.

                                  BRIAN
                    I really screwed up, didn t I?

      Michael sits.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Internal Affairs is going to have 
                    to get into it.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Just so you know, Demarcus had 
                    nothing to do with it.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Brian --

                                  BRIAN
                    I told him to go call it in. 

      Michael puts his hand up to silence his son.

                                    MICHAEL
                    This whole thing will go down a lot 
                    easier if you nail this guy.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Every lead on this case is a dead 
                    end.                                                                                    38.


                                    MICHAEL
                    So... maybe you can get him on 
                    something else.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    The N-Dex didn t have him for so 
                    much as a parking ticket.

                                  BRIAN
                    No, he means maybe it s not his 
                    first time with this type of crime.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    The guy had a ritual.

                                  BRIAN
                    The dress.  The candles.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    So we look for unsolved cases with 
                    the same M.O.

                                    MICHAEL
                    It s worth a shot.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    We can start with his last known in 
                    Tampa.  See if he rented any 
                    storage containers.

                                  BRIAN
                    Him or the monsignor.   cause you 
                    don t wake up one day at fifty and 
                    be a pervert.

                                    MICHAEL
                    That s a welcome relief.

      Michael gets to his feet.   

                                  BRIAN
                    Thanks for the hand.  I mean it.

                                    MICHAEL
                    When was the last time you had a 
                    decent night s sleep?  You look 
                    like hell.

                                  BRIAN
                    You look good though.  Nice jacket.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Going out to dinner.  Some of the 
                    guys.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    39.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                          (from the doorway)
                    Good luck you two.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Thank you, sir.

      Michael goes.  Brian downs his coffee.

                                  BRIAN
                    Let s do it.

      He and Demarcus head to the squad room.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. DRESSLER S WILLIAMSBURG - SATURDAY NIGHT

      A hip dinner spot across from Peter Luger s under the bridge, 
      full of the latest crop of young lovelies, including Sydney 
      and Jamie with law school friends WHITNEY and JARED.  Was 
      Jamie s crowd but maybe not anymore. 

                                  JARED
                    Whitney, tell  em where you ve 
                    been.  She s been in Manitoba 
                    working on a takeover of a Canadian 
                    shale oil outfit.

                                    WHITNEY
                    Yeah, but don t buy any stock yet, 
                    we re facing an incredible 
                      environmental furor.

                                  JARED
                    Which they re pretty confident they 
                    can grease their way out of.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Oh, that s green. 

      Everyone laughs.  Jamie manages a smile.

                                    WHITNEY
                    Jamie s the one with the exciting 
                    new gig, though, right? 

                                  JARED
                    Yeah, how was life on the mean 
                    streets today, Jaimer?

                                  SYDNEY
                    Believe me, it s not dinner 
                      conversation.                                                                                    40.


                                  JAMIE
                    My first call to a stinker. 

                                    WHITNEY
                    What s that?

                                  JARED
                    Probably what it sounds like,  
                    somebody dead, right?  For a long 
                    time?

                                  SYDNEY
                    Jamie. 

                                  JAMIE
                    They asked, Sydney. -- Almost two 
                    weeks.

                                  SYDNEY
                          (a recitation)
                    He died on the toilet, okay?  
                    Morbidly obese at six hundred and 
                    fifty pounds.  Rigor mortis had set 
                    in so the coroner had to break his 
                    legs to remove him from the 
                    bathroom.

      A pall settles.  Then --

                                  SYDNEY (CONT D)
                    I need a cigarette.  I know, I m 
                      quitting...

      She takes her purse and goes out.  Then Jamie gets up.

                                  JAMIE
                    Excuse me, guys.

      He goes.  Whitney and Jared raise their eyebrows at each 
      other, sip wine.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. DRESSLER S - NIGHT

      Sydney has an unlit cigarette, a lighter.  Jamie comes out.

                                  JAMIE
                    I m sorry.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Why d you do that?                                                                                      41.


                                  JAMIE
                    I don t know.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Am I being tested?  Is that it?  
                    Because you know I m having trouble 
                    with this whole thing. 

                                  JAMIE
                    It s just, that s my reality now.

                                  SYDNEY
                    My mother calls it your little bait 
                    and switch.  I fall in love with a 
                    Harvard lawyer and he turns out to 
                    be a cop on a beat.

      She crushes the cig in her hand, throws it in the receptacle.

                                  JAMIE
                    I know your folks aren t happy 
                    about it and I m sorry they re 
                    giving you a bad time.  But I can t 
                    be a lawyer just because it s more 
                      comfortable for them.  Or you.  
                    This is something I have to do.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Because Joe got killed?

                                  JAMIE
                    You know that s a big part of it.  
                    But truthfully?  I think I always 
                    wanted to be a cop.  Harvard Law 
                    was my family s idea, my mother s 
                    really.

                                  SYDNEY
                    You could be a great lawyer.

                                  JAMIE
                    And I d be miserable.  And I d make 
                    you miserable.  Trust me.  Just 
                    give it some time.  I promise I ll  
                    keep the war stories to a minimum, 
                    okay?

      The air warms between them.  

                                  SYDNEY
                    I ll try harder too.  I know it s 
                    important work.  My folks will come 
                    around.                                                                                    42.


                                  JAMIE
                    We re going to be okay.

      They kiss deeply.  Gaze at each other.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Mm.

                                  JAMIE
                    Not exactly make-up sex, but it s a 
                    start.

                                  SYDNEY
                    We better get back in.

      They head inside, but Jamie sees something down the street 
      that stops him.

                                  JAMIE
                    I ll be right there. 

      Sydney gives a quizzical look, but goes inside.  Jamie 
      watches a man help a woman into an SUV.  It s Jamie s father, 
      Michael, and the woman is the newscaster, Padma Lahari.  From 
      their body language, it s clear there s a lot between them.  
      Surprised, Jamie smiles to himself, then goes inside.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. DETECTIVE S SQUAD ROOM - VERY LATE NIGHT

      Demarcus and Brian on their computers.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Most of these kidnaps are 
                      custodial.

                                  BRIAN
                    Well, here s something.  Cold case 
                    in Tampa, little Catholic girl 
                    around Teresa s age went missing.  
                    Body never found.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    When Banse was living there?

                                  BRIAN
                    What a coincidence.  You keep 
                    looking for unsolveds and I ll call 
                    Tampa for the police records, news 
                    coverage, gotta be something there 
                    to link him to the crime...                                                                                    43.


      He picks up his phone.  It s going to be another long night.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. BAY RIDGE - TREE-LINED STREET - SUNDAY

      Solid, middle-class Brooklyn.  Nice big, old-fashioned brick 
      houses with porches, more than a few American flags.  CHURCH 
      BELLS peel, a few people stroll in their Sunday best.

      INT. REAGAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SUNDAY 

      A lived-in mix of nice, comfortable furniture from Patrick 
      and his wife s tenure (baby grand, antimacassar on an easy 
      chair, crucifix, Jack and Bobby on the wall) before they 
      moved to the Sun Belt and Michael and his family took over 
      and added their own touches -- kids  sports trophies going 
      back decades, flat screen TV.

      Home from eleven o clock mass, Nicky lounges, texting,  
      Michael and Patrick relax with the Sunday Times, Patrick with 
      the crossword puzzle. 

                                    PATRICK
                     Kind of shell.   T-A blank blank.   

                                    MICHAEL
                    You drive yourself nuts with those 
                    things, Dad.

                                  NICKY
                    Taco shell.  T-A-C-O.

                                    PATRICK
                    It fits.
                          (then)
                    What s a taco shell?

      With a stack of plates, Erin looks in from the dining room.

                                  ERIN
                    Nick, I could use a little help in 
                    here?

                                  NICKY
                    Two minutes.

      Nicky texts some more.  Patrick looks over his glasses at 
      her.  She feels it, goes and takes the plates from Erin.

                                  ERIN
                    Thank you.                                                                                    44.


      Nicky helps set the table as FRAN McCAREY, 62, Michael s old-
      maid sister-in-law, comes out of the kitchen with a basket of 
      bread, an apron over her Sunday best.

                                  FRAN
                    Where is everybody?!  And then they 
                    complain if the roast is 
                      overcooked!

      The front door opens and Brian s boys blast in, followed by 
      Linda with a casserole.  

                                  LINDA
                    Y know guys, Staten Island is not 
                    on the other side of the world.  It 
                    wouldn t kill you to come to mass 
                    at Holy Trinity one Sunday. 

      As Linda heads to the kitchen, Sean jumps on Michael.

                                  SEAN
                    Grandpa, how much money do you 
                    have?  Can I see it?

                                    MICHAEL
                    After we eat.

                                    PATRICK
                    Jack, show me your right hand.

      Patrick holds his hand up, the nine-year-old punches it.  
      Fran comes out of kitchen with bowl of mashed potatoes.  

                                  FRAN
                    Well, I don t care, at six twenty 
                    nine a pound for roast beef, we re 
                    sitting down.   

      The front door opens and Jamie comes in with a bouquet of 
      grocery flowers.  Michael perks up as always to see him.

                                  JAMIE
                    Hey all.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Thank goodness, Fran was on the 
                      precipice.   

                                  JAMIE
                    What would Sunday dinner be without  
                    Aunt Franny s tears?

      Jamie hands Fran the flowers, puts an arm around Patrick who 
      is heading to the table.                                                                                    45.


                                  JAMIE (CONT D)
                    Hi, Grandpa.

                                    PATRICK
                    Hey, boot. 

      They all gather into the

      DINING ROOM

                                  JAMIE
                    Where s Brian?

                                  LINDA
                    He said he d try and make it. 

                                  ERIN
                    So you all know, right?  I d like 
                    to strangle him.

                                    MICHAEL
                    No strangling on Sunday, okay, 
                    Sunshine?  

      All sit, Michael at the head of the table, which Patrick 
      ceded when he and his wife moved to the Sun Belt. 

                                    PATRICK
                    Brian did what he had to do.

                                  ERIN
                    Of course you d take his side. 

                                    PATRICK
                    I say what I think.

                                  ERIN
                    And look where it got you.

      Patrick s face shuts.  Fran bustles in with the roast.

                                  FRAN
                    He tried to sell me a tired old 
                    piece in the case but I set him 
                    right.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m sure you did, Franny, now sit.  
                    -- Jamie?

      Fran puts the roast before Michael for him to carve and sits 
      as all bow their heads for grace.                                                                                    46.


                                  JAMIE
                    Bless us Oh Lord for these gifts 
                    which we are about to receive from 
                    your bountiful hands through Christ 
                    Our Lord.  Amen.

      Under which, Brian has come in and now sits, crossing himself 
      as they all cross themselves and say Amen.  

                                  BRIAN
                    Real food.

                                  SEAN
                    I don t want any beans.

                                  LINDA
                    Yes you do.

      Everyone helps themselves as bowls of food are passed and 
      Michael carves the roast.  Patrick has been stewing.

                                    PATRICK
                    I ll tell you where it got me.  I 
                    got a clean conscience and I sleep 
                    at night.

                                  BRIAN
                    Where what got you?

                                  NICKY
                    Mom s mad at him because he took 
                    your side.

                                  ERIN
                    Nicky, please, just stay out of it.

                                  BRIAN
                    So she s been riding around on her 
                    high horse, huh?

                                  ERIN
                    Don t make this about me.  I m not 
                    the one that slapped somebody 
                    around and stuck their head in a 
                    toilet.

                                  BRIAN
                    What do you know about it?

                                  JACK
                    Dad stuck somebody s head in the 
                    toilet?                                                                                    47.

                    Ssh.  Eat.

                                  ERIN
                    I know you re supposed to enforce 
                    the law, not make it up as you go 
                    along.

                                  BRIAN
                    You got no idea what goes on.  You 
                    only know what you know.

                                    PATRICK
                    Back in the day you just showed  em 
                    your nightstick.

                                  ERIN
                    The laws are there for a reason!  

                                    PATRICK
                    Yeah, to protect the criminals! 

                                  ERIN
                    No, to protect society from a 
                    police state!

                                  BRIAN
                    Blah blah.

                                  ERIN
                    What a jerk.

                                  BRIAN
                    Screw you!

                                  ERIN
                    No, screw you.

      Michael raps on the table and everyone quiets.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Hey, hey.  This is Sunday dinner, 
                    not a free-for-all.  Let s keep it 
                    civil. 

                                  ERIN
                    Dad, you resort to the use of force 
                    and torture, you corrupt the moral 
                    fiber of the culture.

                                  BRIAN
                    The who?  The what?

      Michael puts a hand up to stay Brian.                                                                                    48.


                                    MICHAEL
                    Nobody s in favor of torture.  The 
                    issue is the use of enhanced 
                      interrogation, is it ever 
                      justified?  

                                  ERIN
                    I say no.  And so does John McCain. 

                                    MICHAEL 
                    Okay then, you ve got a ticking 
                    bomb.  That guy over there planted 
                    it.  Lives are at stake.  Is that 
                    jerk s rights worth more than those 
                    innocent victims? 

                                    PATRICK
                    Of course not.  See? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    What do you think, Jamie?  You ve 
                    got a law degree. 

                                  JAMIE
                    And a gun now too.  And that s a 
                    lot of power.  You don t govern it, 
                    Erin s right, it s a slippery slope 
                    to where we find ourselves in a 
                    fascist state.

                                  BRIAN
                    Yeah?  You wait, little brother, 
                    until you chase somebody into a 
                    dark alley and maybe that shiny 
                    thing is a cell phone and maybe 
                    it s not.

                                    PATRICK
                    Every cop s nightmare.

      Brian s Blackberry buzzes, he looks at his text and gets up. 

                                  JAMIE
                    It s true.  I can say whatever I 
                    want, but really I don t know what 
                    I would have done in his position.

                                  BRIAN
                          (pocketing his phone)
                    I gotta go.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Something up?                                                                                    49.


                                  BRIAN
                    We ll find out.

                                  LINDA
                    You want a sandwich?  You barely 
                    touched your food. 

                                  BRIAN
                    I ll be fine.  Just -- Erin,
                    Lemme just ask you a question.  
                    What would you have wanted me to do 
                    if it was Nicky and you only had 24 
                    hours to save her life?

                                  NICKY
                    Me?

                                  BRIAN
                    Be honest.  Somebody snatches her 
                    off the street and I got hold of 
                    them and they wouldn t talk?  Give 
                    me a break.     

      And Brian goes.

                                    PATRICK
                    Nicky?  You wouldn t have to worry.  
                    They d throw her back in ten 
                    minutes.  

                                  NICKY
                    That s not funny.

      Hurt, Nicky bolts, runs upstairs.  Erin gets up to go after.

                                  ERIN
                    Thanks, Grandpa. 

      Silence as Michael surveys the shambles of family dinner, 
      plates half-eaten, chairs pushed back, napkins thrown down.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    More meat anyone?  I ve got a nice 
                    end piece here.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. REAGAN KITCHEN - A SHORT TIME LATER

      Sleeves rolled up, Michael makes a brandy sauce at the stove.  
      Jamie cuts pieces of a big flat yellow cake and plates them.  
      Michael pours brandy into both a saucepan and a glass.                                                                                    50.


                                    MICHAEL
                    One for the sauce, one for me after 
                    that fracas.  Jamie?

                                  JAMIE
                    Don t mind if I do.

      Jamie pours himself a nip.  Erin comes down the back stairs.

                                  ERIN
                    That kid.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I ll tell Dad he s got to put a 
                    governor on the motor.  Teenage 
                    girls are sensitive creatures, if I 
                    remember correctly.

                                  JAMIE
                    He can be a real button-pusher 
                      sometimes.

                                  ERIN
                    It s not him she s angry with, it s 
                    me.   I was so mean to Brian.   
                    Which translated means mean to her 
                    father.  She thinks I drove him 
                    away.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I m not a big fan of divorce, but 
                    not even your mother would have 
                    blamed you for kicking him to the 
                    curb, Erin. 

                                  ERIN
                    I ve got twenty-five cases on my 
                    desk, a teenage daughter I m at war 
                    with and a brother who thinks I m a 
                    schmuck.  Doesn t he know I d shoot 
                    this guy myself?  

      Michael puts an arm around Erin.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Tough week, huh?

                                  ERIN
                    Sometimes I wish I could go 
                    upstairs to my old room and crawl 
                    under the covers like I d never 
                    left.  

      Jamie pours the rest of the brandy, hands Erin the glass.                                                                                     51.


                                  JAMIE
                    Here.  It s either you or Aunt 
                    Franny and she s already half in 
                    the bag.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Ssh.  Kids.

      Aunt Fran comes in with dirty dishes.   

                                  AUNT FRAN
                    Look at you, Michael, making 
                    dessert.  How lucky was my sister. 

      Erin rolls her eyes and takes a pot of coffee into the dining 
      room.  Fran follows with cups. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    So how s the beat, buddy?

                                  JAMIE
                    I had my first stinker.  Guy had 
                    been dead fourteen days.

                                    MICHAEL
                    You want to put a dab of VapoRub 
                    under your nose before you attend a 
                    scene like that.  It blocks the 
                    smell.

      Jamie pours cream into a bowl, starts to whisk it.  Then --

                                  JAMIE
                    Dad, at graduation, that guy 
                    Malevsky, what s the deal with him 
                    and Brian? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    They were partners but they had a 
                    falling out, maybe five years ago.  
                    Brian didn t say much about it.  
                    Speaking of graduation, that was a 
                    cute girl wishing you well.

                                  JAMIE
                    Who?  Maria Romano? 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Good friend?

                                  JAMIE
                    Friend.  What about you, Dad?  Any 
                     good friends  in your life?                                                                                    52.


                                    MICHAEL
                    Not a day goes by I don t think 
                    about your mother and what she s 
                    missing, seeing you kids grow up, 
                    the grandchildren.

      Jamie lets it slide...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. DETECTIVE S SQUAD ROOM - LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON

      Sunday vibe.  Demarcus just hanging up the phone, every 
      surrounding surface filled with boxes of files, tapes, 
      printouts, when Brian comes in and sees the boxes.

                                  BRIAN
                    The ship is in, huh?

                                  DEMARCUS
                    And this is only Tampa.  I just got 
                    off the phone with Baltimore P.D.  
                    Banse was a security guard at a 
                    trucking company same time another 
                    parochial school girl was abducted.  
                    But this one they found.  Wrapped 
                    in purple cloth and tossed in a 
                    rest-stop dumpster.  Also unsolved.  
                    That stuff s already on the way.

                                  BRIAN
                    Purple s what they cover the cross 
                    with on Good Friday.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Dig in, bro.

                                  BRIAN
                    Let s nail this bastard.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:



      INT. DETECTIVE S SQUAD ROOM - EARLY MONDAY MORNING  

      Night shift leaving, day-shift trickling in.  It s been 
      another long seige for Brian and Demarcus, poring through 
      files and records from yet more boxes that have arrived and 
      now fill every surface, other detectives helping.  Brian s 
      going through newspaper clippings; Demarcus, police reports. 

                                  DEMARCUS
                    The little girl in the dumpster in 
                    Baltimore had stigmata-like pierces 
                    on the palms of her hands.

                    I don t think they were miracles.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    But the crime scene was again 
                      immaculate.  Guy s a regular Mr. 
                    Clean.

      A fellow DETECTIVE comes over and drops a file into a box.

                                  DETECTIVE
                    Nothing new here, gentlemen.

      Without looking up, Brian hands him another file.  Brian 
      looks at the clock.

                                  BRIAN
                    Soon as they open up, we can start 
                    making calls to the storage 
                    companies in both states.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    I m seeing double.

      Demarcus rubs his eyes.  Brian picks up a newspaper clipping.

                                  BRIAN
                    This is the kid in Florida.  Can 
                    you imagine the parents?  No body, 
                    never any closure.  Beautiful 
                    little girl.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    What?

                                  BRIAN
                    The crucifix.  The necklace.

      RESUME SCENE

                    Whoa.

                                  BRIAN
                    Yeah.

      Now both men are on their feet and grabbing their jackets.  
      They re headed out when their D3, LIEUTENANT GREENBERG, 50,  
      is just coming into work.

                                    LIEUTENANT GREENBERG
                    You coming` or going?

                                  BRIAN
                    We just caught a break on the Banse 
                    case.

                                    LIEUTENANT GREENBERG
                    Good, but you re still going to 
                    have to go downtown.  Not even 
                    Daddy s gonna be able to deflect 
                    the heat off your ass this time.

                    For now.

      Brian and Demarcus go.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. RON BANSE S HOUSE - LINDENHURST - DAY

      Demarcus and Brian are at the door with Mrs. Banse.  Her hand 
      is over her crucifix.

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    My necklace?                                                                                    55.


                                  BRIAN
                    It belonged to a little girl in 
                    Florida who was one of his victims.

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    It can t be.  Ronnie wasn t much of 
                      a husband, but he wasn t a monster. 

                                  BRIAN
                    We don t even know yet how many 
                    other children he took.

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    Dear Jesus.

                                  DEMARCUS
                    Mrs. Banse, I m afraid we need to 
                    take a closer look at the necklace.  
                    The girl s parents said her name, 
                    Kathy, was engraved on the back.

                                  MRS. BANSE
                    My husband said that was because 
                    it s an antique.

                                  BRIAN
                    We need the necklace as evidence.  
                    Remove it please.

      She can t get it off her neck fast enough.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Now we see Brian standing by, arms folded across his chest.  
      And we see now, too, that Erin has the necklace.

                                  ERIN (CONT D)
                    Hi, Jay, this is Erin Boyle in the  
                    Manhattan D.A. s office.  We want 
                    to arrange to extradite Ronald 
                    Banse to Florida for murder with 
                    special circumstances.  

      Brian smiles.                                                                                    56.


                                  ERIN (CONT D)
                    We have the necklace Katherine 
                    MacDonald was wearing when she 
                      disappeared in 2005, and Tampa 
                    police have located what in all 
                      probability are her remains in a 
                    storage container in Orlando,  
                      registered in Banse s alias.
                          (she listens, then)
                      Appreciate it.  Thank you.

      She hangs up.

                                  BRIAN
                    Beautiful it s Florida.  They re 
                    not shy about exercising capital 
                      punishment down there.

                                  ERIN
                    Yeah, it s a happy outcome.  This 
                    time.

                                  BRIAN
                    Just gimme one, will you? 

                                  ERIN
                    You don t get it, do you?

                                  BRIAN
                    Say hi to the ACLU for me. 

      Brian heads for the door.

                    Brian.  You want to talk about

                                  BRIAN
                    Probably.  Thanks.

      A warm moment between them and Brian goes.

      INT. SYDNEY S PARK SLOPE BEDROOM - ALMOST DAWN - TUESDAY

      Sydney s naked in bed.  Jamie, up and dressed in casual 
      civilian clothes, comes and kisses her.  She stirs.                                                                                    57.

                    Is it tomorrow already?  Come back 
                    to bed.

                                  JAMIE
                    Can t keep the Chief waiting.

                                  SYDNEY
                    It s still dark out.  You Reagans 
                    are crazy.

      She nestles down into the pillow.  He goes.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      EXT. PROSPECT PARK - PRE-DAWN

      Deserted except for the occasional dog-walker and miscreant.  
      We find Jamie headed to the subway.  He and we become aware 
      that a car is following him.  He speeds up, so does the car.  
      Finally, the unmarked Crown Vic pulls up to the curb beside 
      him, its passenger-side window powering down. 

                                    A VOICE
                    Reagan!

      This stops Jamie.  He sees now that the man in the car is 
      holding up a badge.  We ll learn he s FEDERAL AGENT ANDERSON.

                                  AGENT ANDERSON
                    Jamison Reagan?  

      Jamie approaches warily.  Checks out the I.D.

                                  JAMIE
                    What s going on?

                                  AGENT ANDERSON
                    Get in.

      Anderson nods towards the back seat.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. GREEN CAR - CONTINUOUS

      When Jamie s settled --

                                  AGENT ANDERSON
                    I m Special Agent Anderson and this 
                    is Agent Cisco.  We want to talk to 
                    you about going to work for us.                                                                                    58.


                                  JAMIE
                    I already have a job.

                                  AGENT ANDERSON
                    We need somebody inside to 
                      infiltrate an element in the police 
                      department. 

      Agent Cisco shifts in his seat to face Jamie.  He holds up a 
      lapel pin in the shape of a blue knight.

                                  AGENT CISCO
                    Ever seen one of these?

                                  JAMIE
                    What is that?

                                  AGENT CISCO
                    It s what they give a cop when he s 
                    initiated into a group called the 
                    Blue Knights.

                                  JAMIE
                    The Blue Knights?  I thought that 
                    was a fairy tale.  My grandfather 
                    used to tell me stories about them 
                    when I was a kid, this secret 
                    society in the New York Police 
                      Department.  

                                  AGENT ANDERSON
                    They were real.  They took care of 
                    their own and they cleaned up 
                    Dodge.

                                  AGENT CISCO 
                    Until about five years ago when 
                    some of them went rogue, and these 
                    guys aren t wearing the white hats.  
                    They started with planting evidence 
                    to put away the bad guys, but it 
                    rapidly escalated into extortion, 
                    stealing drug evidence and cash, 
                    murder for hire....  Real bad 
                    actors.

                                  JAMIE
                    Does my father know about this?

      They just look at him.

                                  JAMIE (CONT D)
                    You re investigating the department 
                    and you haven t told my father?                                                                                    59.


                                  AGENT CISCO
                    We don t know how wide it spreads 
                    or how high it goes.

                                  JAMIE
                    I m out of here. 

      Jamie moves to get out.  The agent stays him with a hand. 

                                  AGENT ANDERSON
                    Wait a minute.  Something you 
                    should hear. 

      He holds up a small digital recorder.  It stops Jamie.  The 
      agent presses a button and we HEAR a man s voice.

                                  RECORDED VOICE
                    It s me.  I think I m in.  I ll let 
                    you know when I get a location so I 
                    can wire up.

      Jamie is stunned.  The agent hits replay.  

                                  RECORDED VOICE (CONT D)
                    It s me.  I think I m in.  I ll let 
                    you know when I get a location --   

      Anderson shuts off the recorder.  Jamie is pole-axed.

                                  JAMIE
                    That s my brother Joe.

                                  AGENT ANDERSON
                    This was his last message to us the 
                    day before he was killed.

      It s sinking in to Jamie.

                                  JAMIE
                    He was working with you?

                                  AGENT CISCO
                    Your brother wasn t killed in a 
                    bust gone bad.  They made him and 
                    then they killed him.  We thought 
                    you might want to finish what he 
                    started. 

      On Jamie, absorbing the ton of bricks just dropped on him...

                                  JAMIE
                    Sorry, train was stalled. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    It s okay, the coffee s still hot.

                                  JAMIE
                    Any luck?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Damn fish must still be sleeping.  
                    Maybe they re changing shifts.

      Jamie smiles wanly, pouring coffee, grabbing his fishing rod.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Still a beautiful spot, isn t it?

                                  JAMIE
                    We ve caught a lot of fish here.

                                    JAMIE/MICHAEL
                          (in unison, an old joke)
                    Just not today.

      They laugh, Jamie heavy-hearted.  Now Michael clears his 
      throat.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Y know, you were asking me the 
                    other day if I was seeing anybody 
                    and I was not forthcoming.

                                  JAMIE
                    Oh.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Because there is somebody.  She s 
                    an Indian girl.  From India, I 
                    mean.  Lovely person, very smart.  
                    She s a TV reporter.

                                  JAMIE
                    That s great.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    What a relief.  I hate keeping 
                    secrets.                                                                                    61.


                                  JAMIE
                    Yeah...

      Jamie s mood is not lost on Michael.

                                    MICHAEL
                    What s going on, Jamie?  You 
                    seem... I don t know, not yourself 
                    today.  Everything okay?  You re 
                    not having second thoughts about 
                    coming on the job...?

                                  JAMIE
                    No, I m fine.
                          (to deflect)
                    That T.O. of mine s a piece of 
                    work.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Renzulli, right?

                                  JAMIE
                    What, you keeping tabs on me?

                                    MICHAEL
                    I got a vested interest.

      On Jamie, the weight on him, and the cost in not being able 
      to tell his father everything.  Knowing too that his life has 
      taken an abrupt turn...

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
