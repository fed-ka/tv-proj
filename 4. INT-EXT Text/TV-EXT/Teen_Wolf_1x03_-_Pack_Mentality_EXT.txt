      The school grounds lie dark and deserted. Under the 
      moonlight, two long SHADOWS approach, stretching across the 
      pavement toward a SCHOOL BUS. Scott and Allison appear, hand *
      in hand.

                                    ALLISON
                    Where are you taking me?

                                  SCOTT
                    Somewhere we can be alone.

                                    ALLISON
                    We are alone.

                                  SCOTT
                    Somewhere we can be more alone.

      Giving her a playful smile, he pries the door of the bus open 
      and holds it for her. Slowly, she steps inside.


      Stiles slams his Jeep door shut, slinging his school bag over 
      his shoulder.

                                  STILES
                    And then what? You killed her?

      Scott follows him from his Jeep toward the school.

                    I don t know. I woke up. I was

                    No, of course not.

                    Yeah, that s totally it.

                    It s going to be okay. Personally, 
                    I think you re handling this pretty

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF


      A BEACON HILLS DEPUTY SHERIFF CRUISER pulls up to the end of *
      the driveway, engine turning off. In the backseat a GERMAN 
      SHEPHERD pants, tongue lolling out of its mouth.

      THE DEPUTY gets out while speaking into his radio.*

                                    DEPUTY*
                    Looks pretty deserted. Does he want 
                    me to take a look inside?

                                  DISPATCH (V.O.)
                    Unit Sixteen, it s county property. 
                    Order is to make sure it s vacant.

                                    DEPUTY*
                    I don t think anybody s home.

                                  DISPATCH (V.O.)
                    For the love of God, Sixteen, go 
                    inside and see if anyone s there.

                                    DEPUTY*
                          (begrudgingly)
                    Copy that.

      The Deputy holds a nervous stare on the dilapidated house. He *
      glances around, noticing how utterly alone he is. Gathering 
      his nerve, he starts toward the house. Then he abruptly 
      stops.

      His eyes flit left and right as if he heard something. 
      Unlatching the clip on his gun, he starts off again.

      INSIDE THE CRUISER - the German Shepherd puts its nose to the 
      cracked window. It cocks its head toward--

      THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE - where Derek stands. His eyes begin 
      to fill with a BLUE GLOW, like florescent liquid pouring into 
      his irises.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/1020.

      As the Deputy cautiously approaches the house, a BARK makes *
      him flinch. He throws an irritated glance back at his German 
      Shepherd and waves a hand at it.

      BUT INSIDE THE CRUISER - the dog starts WHINING, pacing in 
      the rear seat. It lets loose a flurry of BARKING.*

                                  DEPUTY (CONT D)*
                    Hey, what is it, boy?*

      The barking turns panicky, the dog desperately trying to get 
      out of the car.

                                  DEPUTY (CONT D)*
                    What the hell...

      The dog s WHINES turn to YIPS, STRANGLED CRIES. 

                                  DEPUTY (CONT D)*
                    Okay, I m coming, I m coming!

      Now just as panicked, the Deputy jumps in, realizing the best *
      thing to do is just get out of there. Which he does. The 
      Cruiser tears off, KICKING UP DIRT down the road.

      THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE - Derek allows himself a 
      subtle but satisfied smile. Until he notices someone standing 
      amid the settling dust...

      Scott. He doesn t move to approach, however. Instead, he just 
      speaks...

                                  SCOTT
                    I know you can hear me.

      Derek s ears twitch as he picks up Scott s voice.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    I need your help.

      FADE IN:


      Scott rounds the bottom of the driveway and crosses to Stiles 
      waiting in his Jeep. He gets in the passenger side.

                                  STILES
                    So what did he teach you? How to 
                    roll over? Beg? Give him your paw?

      But Scott doesn t react, not even cracking a smile.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Did he tell you how to remember?

                    But what if I remember that I 
                    actually did attack him? And what 
                    if he dies?

                    What if I go to sleep some night 
                    and it s you I end up going after? 
                    How are you going to feel if I kill 
                    you, Stiles?

                    I d prefer not to feel anything. I

      Stiles starts the Jeep, pulling out.


      Stiles s Jeep pulls up to the chain link fence surrounding *
      the high school parking lot. Scott gets out of the passenger *
      side, approaching the fence, his eyes focused on--*

      THE SCHOOL BUS parked on the far side of the lot, YELLOW *
      POLICE TAPE draped around it.*

      Stiles watches Scott climb the fence and leap down to the 
      pavement on the other side.


      Approaching the bus--and whatever memories it might hold 
      inside--Scott pauses to look at the damaged door. He holds 
      still, drawing in a breath and closing his eyes--


      Scott snaps his eyes open. It s working. He reaches the front 
      door of the bus, steels himself and steps in.


      --and hits the ground running. Behind him, A SECURITY GUARD *
      comes charging out of the school with a flashlight.*

      Scott races for the fence as the FLASHLIGHT BEAM catches him. *
      The chain link comes up fast. But instead of climbing, he *
      launches himself off the pavement and flips head over heels *
      right over the fence.

      Derek gets out of his Dodge under the dimly lit overhang. As 
      he puts the pump in the tank of his car--

      A DARK SUV eases up as if to stop at the opposite tank. But 
      then instead stops right in front of Derek s car.

      ANOTHER SUV pulls in right behind him. Two dark vehicles now 
      blocking him in. Derek looks to the doors of the SUV s. TWO

      THE NUMBERS on the gas pump tick up and up. 

      Noting the two men behind him and Argent ahead with almost 
      casual interest, Derek doesn t say a word. Just waits.

      He does notice one of the Hunters behind him, holding a 
      SHOTGUN tightly to his leg.

      CLUNK. The gas pump stops. Moving slowly yet deliberately, 
      Derek puts the pump back and twists the cap back on his tank.

                    And you don t have much of that 
                    these days, do you?

      Argent pulls the squeegee back one last time.

                    There we go. You can actually look *

                    that makes everything so much 
                    clearer?

      Argent sets the squeegee back, noticing Derek s hands have 
      curled into fists. Exactly what he wanted. But Derek slowly 
      relaxes his hands, unwilling to be provoked.

                                  SCOTT
                    I think I could totally handle more 
                    of just you and me.

                                    ALLISON
                    Great.

      And she kisses him quickly on the lips.

                                  SCOTT
                    Allison?

      She turns back and he pulls her into a real kiss. Hands 
      around her waist, bringing her close.

                                    ALLISON
                    And I think I could handle more of 
                    that.

      He lets her go and crosses to his bike which leans against 
      the rear of the Argent garage. Allison waves to him as he 
      mounts the bike and starts off. Neither of them see--

      Argent watching from THE LIVING ROOM WINDOW.

      The Hale house looms ominously, tattooed with ragged shadows 
      of the overgrown trees around it.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 103" GREEN DRAFT10/18/1047.



      --into the yard, hurtling into the shadows, through trees, 
      across branches and deadfalls--

                                  DEREK (V.O.)
                    You re the one he wants.

      In the darkness, two malevolent RED EYES blink open.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
