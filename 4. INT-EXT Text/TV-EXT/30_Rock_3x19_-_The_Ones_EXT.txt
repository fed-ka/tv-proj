      FADE IN:



      Liz enters, apprehensive.  Jack is at his bar, drink in hand.  
      He is clearly upset.

                                  LIZ
                    Hey.  Do you have a second?*

                                  JACK
                    It s over, Lemon.  It s over before 
                    it ever started.  Drink with me.*

      Liz can t help but feel a little relieved.*

                                  LIZ
                    I m sorry.  But I am glad it didn t *
                    have to come from me.*

                                  JACK
                    What are you talking about?

                                  LIZ
                          (uh-oh)
                    What are you talking about?

                    anyone posted on it were penises.

      Jack shakes his head, refreshes his drink. *

                                  JACK (CONT D)*
                    So what did you want to talk to me --*

                                  LIZ
                          (high pitched, nervous)*
                    Hey, Jack!*
                          (then, shaking it off)*
                    Right.  Okay.  I ve been trying to *
                    think of how not to tell you this --*

      Elisa is in the doorway.  She runs to Jack.  30 ROCK 319: "The Ones"                     10.

                                  ELISA
                    I m back!  Let s get married!*

      They embrace.  Liz is at a loss.  Jack breaks the kiss and *
      crosses to the phone.*

                                  JACK
                    I ll get us a table at Plunder to *
                    celebrate in style.  And carbo-load *
                    for the reunion sex. *

      Elisa, all smiles, turns to Liz, her arms open for a hug.*

                                  ELISA*
                    Lemon!  Isn t this wonderful?*

      The two women hug, smiling hard.  In the hug they whisper *
      intensely as Jack makes his call in the background.*

                                  ELISA (CONT D)*
                    Don t say anything about what I *
                    told you.  About my secret.*

                                  LIZ
                    I won t.  Because you have to --*

      Elisa pulls Liz s hair.  Hard.  Liz yelps in pain.*

        Yaaaah!*(covering, happy)*
                                                    Yaaaay!**

      Jack looks up from the phone and smiles at the  celebration .*

      Liz enters for the morning, exhausted from her long night, *
      and runs into a happy-looking Jenna crossing by the page 
      desk.  Kenneth is there. 

                                  LIZ
                    You look happy.  Did you settle *
                    that lawsuit over your exercise *
                    tape?*

                                  JENNA*
                    Even better.  I had an amazing date 
                    last night.  And it s all thanks to 
                    Kenneth.

                                    KENNETH
                    Oh, it was nothing.  Sure, I was 
                    legally dead for five minutes but I 
                    did it for true love.

                                  JENNA
                    Actually, it turns out Roger has 
                    sole custody of his five-year-old 
                    son, so --
                          (thumbs down)
                    -- ptttb.

      Jenna crosses away.  Liz turns to Kenneth.

                                  LIZ
                    Wait, you were dead?*

                                    KENNETH
                    Oh, I m fine.  But I think I *
                    brought something back with me.

      Liz nods,  Fair enough,  and crosses away.  A beat.  A shadow 
      crosses past Kenneth as if someone or something has passed 
      through him.  He shivers.  Around the corner, Liz runs into *
      Tracy about to enter his dressing room.  He s wearing *
      sunglasses and no shirt.*  30 ROCK 319: "The Ones"                     33.

                    Did you even go home last night? *
                    And where s your shirt?*

                                  TRACY*
                     No  and  at large .  I may have *
                    had a little too much to drink last *
                    night but you ll be proud of me, *
                    Liz Lemon Cool J.   Cause I went *
                    out and got that tattoo Angie *
                    wanted me to get.  *

      Liz smiles,  Good for you.   As Tracy walks away, she notices *
      that he has a large tattoo of Tangiers the lion on his back.*
