      Gloria cuts through the bar.  Some of the MEN are less subtle 
      about checking her out than others.

    One guy doesn t look at all.  He stands at the bar, drinking 
      a ginger ale.  We only see him from the back.  He wears a 
      Stetson, old cowboy boots.

      Gloria slows, scans the restaurant, sees who she s looking 
    for and heads for a table.

    At the table are TOMMY BUCKS, 35, a slick-haired goon from 
      Italy; HARRY ARNO, 55, balding and nervous, and JOYCE, 35, a 
      former exotic dancer who s wondering how the hell her life 
      brought her to be sitting at this table.

      Tommy Bucks lights up when he sees Gloria approach.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Gloria!  What a surprise!

                                  GLORIA
                    I was just coming in to use the 
                    john and I saw you.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Sit.  Join us.  

      ANGLE ON THE TABLE

      From the bar.  We see Gloria unsling the beach bag from over 
    her shoulder and sit down, putting the bag under the table.  
      PULL BACK to reveal we re looking at them in the mirror 
      behind the bar.

      CLOSE ON THE GUY IN THE STETSON

      Watching Tommy Bucks and the others in the mirror.  This is 
      RAYLAN GIVENS, 40s.Raylan pushes back from the bar, walks 
      into the restaurant.  Harry sees him first.                                                                                    2.



                                  HARRY
                    Raylan.  You re late.  I already 
                    checked him out.  He s clean.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You look in his socks?  He took an 
                    ankle gun off me in Italy, though I 
                    doubt he s wearing it.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Not my style.

                                  HARRY
                    Look, Raylan, Tommy and I been 
                    talking, and he s cool with me now.  
                    He knows it was all a mistake.  

                                  RAYLAN
                          (to Tommy Bucks)
                    The airport s a good forty-five 
                    from here, but you ll make it if 
                    you leave in the next ten minutes.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    I thought I had until two-fifteen.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Yeah, well, now you got ten minutes.

                                  HARRY
                    You know what you re talking about?  
                    If you do, let me in on it.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    What it means, your friend gave me 
                      twenty-four hours to get out of the 
                    country, do you believe that?

      Harry and Joyce look at Raylan -- is that true?  

                                  RAYLAN
                          (to Gloria)
                    Honey, you re through here, aren t you?

      Gloria doesn t move right away.  Raylan pulls her chair back.  
      Gloria looks at Tommy Bucks.  He gives a nod.  Gloria gets 
    up, walks off.  

                                  JOYCE
                    I think Gloria forgot her beach bag.                                                                                    3.



                                  RAYLAN
                    She ll get it later.  Harry, why 
                    don t you take Joyce to the bar for 
                    a drink.  

                                  HARRY
                    Raylan, I m telling you, me and 
                    Tommy, we re good.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Go on.

      Joyce and Harry look at each other, shrug, get up and walk 
      off.  Raylan takes a seat across the table from Tommy Bucks, 
    the table set with glasses and silverware.  A WAITER comes up 
    to Tommy Bucks.

                                  WAITER
                    Would you like another iced tea?

      Tommy Bucks shakes his head.  The waiter looks to Raylan. 

                                  WAITER (CONT D)
                    Anything for you, sir?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Give me about three minutes and 
                    come back.

    The waiter walks off.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    You don t look at your watch.  How 
                    do you know it s three minutes?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I m estimating.  Now it s two 
                    minutes.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    You don t know that!

      Raylan shrugs.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS (CONT D)
                    You don t have the permission, what 
                    you re doing, the authority.

                                  RAYLAN
                    An officer of the law tells an 
                      undesirable like yourself to get 
                    out of town.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    4.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT'D)
                    It s done all the time.  If you 
                    don t choose to leave, then we play 
                    by your rules.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    I don t haverules.

                                  RAYLAN
                    That s what I mean.  You have one 
                    minute.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    You just got done saying two 
                    minutes!

                                  RAYLAN
                    Time flies, huh?  Make up your mind.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    I couldashot you in Italy.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Maybe you should ve.  I was unarmed 
                    then.  Just like the man you 
                    killed.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    He was a good friend of yours?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Didn t know him that well.  Thirty 
                    seconds.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Now I munarmed.  You gonnashoot 
                    me?

                                  RAYLAN
                    You re not unarmed.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Harry told you.  I don t have a 
                    gun.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Then what s in the beach bag your 
                    friend left you?

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Okay, okay.  Fine.  You want me to 
                    leave Harry alone?  You got it.  I 
                    don t care.  He s nothing to me.                                                                                    5.



                                  RAYLAN
                    He s nothing much to me either.  
                    Twenty seconds.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Then why you doing this?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Ten seconds.

      Tommy Bucks looks at Raylan, really stares at him.  Nods.

                                  TOMMY BUCKS
                    Okay.  You re going to get what you 
                    want.

      Under the table, Tommy s hand comes out of the beach bag with 
      a pistol.

      Joyce and Harry, watching from the bar.  They see a glint of 
      metal in Tommy Bucks  hand.

                                  HARRY
                    HE S GOT A GUN!

      Raylan goes for his Beretta, fast.

      Tommy Bucks clears the table with his gun barrel and is about 
    to fire, but...

      Raylan fires first, through two water glasses, into Tommy 
      Bucks  chest.

      Tommy is startled.  He tries again to fire.

      Raylan shoots him again, jolting him, causing Tommy Bucks to 
      fire into the table, sending more glass and china flying.  
      Raylan shoots Tommy again and waits, the butt of his gun 
      resting on the table.

      Tommy Bucks looks at him, staring, before his shoulders go 
      slack and he lowers his head to the table.

      Raylan lays his gun on the table, stands.  

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                  END OF TEASER                                                                                    6.



                                  ACT ONE

      I/E. RAYLAN S CAR/HIGHWAY - DUSK

      Raylan drives a Cadillacon the highway.  A sign ahead 
      indicates the next exit is for Ocala.  Raylan takes the exit.

      Super:  One week later


      Raylan is sitting across from his boss, DAN GRANT, 50.  

                                  DAN
                    Look, you wear what you wear, and 
                    you are what you are, and I put up 
                    with it  cause you get the job 
                    done.   Ceptnow I m to understand 
                    you ve become a target for all the 
                    mental wizards out there who wanna 
                    prove themselves.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I don t know if you can generalize 
                    from the word of two carjackers--

                                  DAN
                    You think they re the only ones 
                    talking this shit?  It s all 
                    through the FDC.Apparently 
                    there s a long line of idiots who 
                    want a crack at you.  As much as I 
                    would like to frame this as my 
                    concern for your safety, it also 
                    wouldn t look real good if one of 
                    my deputies is gunned down in a 
                    shootoutwith some yahoo who wants 
                    to prove he s the quicker draw.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What makes you think I d lose?

    Dan gives him a look.                                                                                    11.



                                  RAYLAN (CONT D)
                    You want me to take some time off?

                                  DAN
                    No.  I want you to take a temporary 
                      reassignment.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Where?

                                  DAN
                    That s up to you.  There are five 
                    districts nationwide low on 
                    manpower, could use you.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Is Eastern Kentucky on that list?

                                  DAN
                    It is.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I ll go there.

                                  DAN
                    You don t want to think about it?

                                  RAYLAN
                    That s where I grew up.  And I know the 
                    marshal, Art Mullen.  He and I taught 
                    firearms at Glynco.

                                  DAN
                    You still got family in Kentucky?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Ex-wife in Lexington.  I believe my 
                    father s still down in Harlan.

                                  DAN
                    You believe?

                                  RAYLAN
                          (shrugs, then:)
                    There s another reason I d like to 
                    go.  I was checking out the 
                    national suspects list and I saw a 
                    name in Eastern Kentucky I 
                      recognized: Boyd Crowder.  
                          (offDan s look)
                    He was a guy I knew growing up.  
                    Back when we were 19, we dug coal 
                    together.                                                                                      12.




        19-YEAR-OLDRAYLAN and 19-YEAR-OLDBOYD are jack-hammering at 
      a pillar of coal in a worked-out mine with a four foot seam.

                                  RAYLAN (V.O.)
                    We started out robbing mines.  
                    That s where you go into a worked-
                    out mine and chop into the pillars 
                    of coal holding up the roof.  We 
                    did it because we were young and 
                    could move fast.  

      Young Boyd thinks he hears something, shuts off his 
      jackhammer, taps Young Raylan and makes a slashing motion 
      across his throat.  Young Raylan shuts down his jackhammer as 
      well.  They hear a groaning, cracking sound.  Chunks of rock 
      start crumbling down from the ceiling.

                                  RAYLAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     Cause if you chop out too much of 
                    the pillar, the roof starts coming 
                    down and you have to run like hell.  

      Young Raylan and Young Boyd drop their jackhammers and run as 
      fast as they can, hunched over in the four-foot seam of the 
      mine.  They run to the exit shaft, the long line of lights 
      behind them winking out one by one as the ceiling comes down.

      Young Raylan and Young Boyd get into the elevator, shut the 
      gate and hit the emergency UP button as a cloud of coal dust 
      floods into the shaft.

    As the elevator starts shooting up, Young Raylan and Young 
      Boyd are clearly terrified and exhilarated.

      CLOSE ON YOUNG BOYD, eyes afire, teeth flashing white against 
    his coal-blacked face, laughing his ass off.

                                  RAYLAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Anyway, yesterday I saw Boyd s name 
                    on the list, and what I want to know 
                    is: how did the kid I knew when I was 
                    19 come to be a white supremacist 
                    moron suspected in a string of 
                    bombings and bank robberies?

                                                                    MATCH CUT TO:

      I/E. CHEVY BLAZER/DOWNTOWN CINCINNATI - NIGHT

      CLOSE ON BOYD CROWDER, now a man in his 40s.He s in the 
      passenger seat, looking out at something.                                                                                    13.



                                  JARED (O.C.)
                    Well, Boyd, whaddyathink?

                                  BOYD
                    Well, Jared, I think it sucks.

      REVEAL JARED, 20s, an eager, disappointed skinhead.

                                  JARED
                    What?  Why?

      They are looking at a building under construction.  A sign on 
    the hoarding around the site says the new building will be an 
      annex to the Federal courthouse.

                                  BOYD
                    No offense, son, but you d need a 
                    box full of Emulexto bring that 
                    down.  All s we got is an RPG.  
                    Most it s gonna do is rip up some 
                    sheetrock and knock over a few 
                    sawhorses.  But don t worry.  We ll 
                    just go to Plan B.

                                  JARED
                    Plan B?

                                  BOYD
                    There s always a Plan B.

      I/E. CHEVY BLAZER/CINCINNATI BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

      Jared drives, with Boyd beside him.  They roll through a 
      predominantly black neighborhood.  Some BLACK TEENAGERS on a 
      corner eyeball them as they pass.

                                  BOYD
                    Used to be, a couplacrackers in an 
                    SUVwould set the jungle on edge.  
                    But they all confident now they got 
                    one of their own in the White House.  
                    These surely are the end times.

      Boyd looks ahead, sees what he s looking for.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    There it is.  Go past slow.

      Jared drives past a rickety old wood church.  The handpainted
      sign out front reads: Temple of the Cool and Beautiful JC.                                                                                    14.



                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Turn left that next street and 
                    stop.  I believe I can take  er
                    from there.

                                  JARED
                          (panic rising)
                    You gonnablow up that church?

      Boyd climbs into the back.  He unfolds a tarp in the way-
      back, revealing an AK-47and a Chinese grenade launcher.

                                  JARED (CONT D)
                    Boyd, there s people on the street.

      Sure enough, there s a TALL BLACK MAN, 30s, wearing a dashiki 
    and a pillbox hat, on the sidewalk in front of the church, 
      talking to FOUR YOUNG BLACK MEN.

                                  JARED (CONT D)
                    They re gonnasee us, ID my car!

                                  BOYD
                    You worried about your car, huh? 

      Boyd pulls the pin, flips the safety.  

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Get ready.

      Boyd gets out of the Blazer.  He hefts the launcher to his 
      shoulder, flips the sight up and takes aim.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    FIRE IN THE HOLE!

    The people in front of the church turn at the sound of Boyd s 
      voice.  They see him and the grenade launcher, not quite sure 
      what to make of it.

      Boyd pulls the trigger.  The projectile rifles through the 
    air and smashes through a window of the church.

    The people start running.  Just in time.

    The Temple of the Cool and Beautiful JC blows up.


      A decrepit place.  It hasn t served as a church in twenty 
      years.  The walls are covered in swastika flags and other 
      white power signs.

      DEVIL, 30s, is on his cell.  He s wiry, tough, smarter than 
    all of them, save Boyd.  In the b.g.are DEWEY and the PORK 
      BROTHERS, all in their 20s, playing a video game.  Dewey 
      (spiked hair and necklace of gatorteeth) thinks he s a good 
      deal smarter than he really is.  The Pork Brothers are under 
    no illusions about their intelligence -- they are muscle and 
    are happy to have found a place in this world.

                                  DEVIL
                          (into cell)
                    How dit go?

                                  BOYD
                    The primary was a waste of time.  
                    Took care of the secondary just fine.

                                  DEVIL
                    Where are you?

                                  BOYD
                    At the airport.  I m coming into 
                      London-Corbin on the late shuttle.

                                  DEVIL
                    Got a call from Oklahoma.  Jared 
                    checks out.

                                  BOYD
                    Oh?

      Boyd s looking at dead Jared in the Blazer.

                                  DEVIL
                    How dhe do?

                                  BOYD
                    Yeah, I had to let Jared go.

                                  DEVIL
                          (beat)
                    Oh.
                          (beat)
                    Was it you didn t trust him or you 
                    just didn t like him much?                                                                                    18.



                                  BOYD
                          (thinks)
                    I guess both.


      Raylan enters baggage claim, slows, smiles when he sees...

    ART MULLEN, 50s, waiting for him.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    Hello, Art.

                    Raylan.

      They shake hands.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Thought I was driving down.

                    There s been a development.  
                    Thought if I came and got you we

                    while they come down.

                    at Glynco.Same suit, same boots.

                                  RAYLAN
                    The boots refairly new.                                                                                    19.



                                  ART
                    Don t tell me that hat is.

                                  RAYLAN
                    No, it s old.


      Raylan and Art are at a table, drinking coffee.

                                  ART
                    Tell me what you remember of Boyd 
                    Crowder.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Well, we dug coal side by side for 
                    EastoverMining, near Brookside. 
                    Boyd was senior to me, became a 
                      powderman.He d crawl down a hole 
                    with his case of Emulexfive-twenty 
                    and come out stringing wire.  He d 
                    call out  Fire in the hole!  to
                    clear the shaft. 

                                  ART
                    Fire in the hole, huh?

                                  RAYLAN
                    She d blow and we d go back in to 
                    dig out the pieces.  We weren t 
                    what you d call buddies, but you 
                    work a deep mine with a man you 
                    look out for each other.
                          (beat)
                    When we struck Eastover, Duke Power 
                    brought in scabs and gun thugs.

                    wrecking bar.  He was put in jail 
                    twice.  Then he shot one of the 
                    scabs, almost killed him.  He took 
                    off and that s the last I saw of 
                    him.  I heard he joined the army, 
                    went to Kuwait for Desert Storm.  
                    Came out and what happened, he went

                    There s someone outside.

      Gary stands, immediately going into realtor mode.  WINONA, 
      40s, enters, also in realtor mode.  They look out at the car.

      Winona gets an odd expression as she looks at the car and

                    Honey, if he wanted to shoot you he 
                    wouldadone it a long time ago.  
                    Not that he ever would.  I don t 
                    think Raylan Givens ever acted out 
                    of anger in his life.

      I/E. CAR/HIGHWAY - DAY

      Raylan drives past a sign welcoming him to Harlan County.

      I/E. CAR/MAIN STREET, HARLAN - DAY

      Raylan drives down Main Street.  He passes Mack s Super 
      Market.  We HOLD ON the parking lot of Mack s as Raylan 
      drives by.

      Dewey -- Boyd s man with the spiked hair and gator-teeth
      necklace -- is pushing a loaded shopping cart waytoo fast.  
    The cart slams into the back of a rusted-out Cadillac.Dewey 
      whips open the trunk, tosses the bags of groceries inside.

    He dashes to the driver s door, jumps in, not bothering to 
      shut the trunk.  He stomps on the gas, screams back in 
      reverse, sends the shopping cart flying.  He throws the Caddy 
      into drive and peels out onto Main Street, handles of the 
      plastic shopping bags flapping out the back.                                                                                    27.




      Raylan is with Art and his SOG (Rachel, Frank and Tim).

                                  RAYLAN
                    He was a star running back in high 
                    school.  Boyd was always saying 
                    Bowman had the goods to go pro.  I 
                    was never that sure.

                                  ART
                    You remember the girl he married, Ava?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I knew an Ava, lived down the street.  
                    She s married to Bowman?

                                  FRANK
                    Was.  She ended the union yesterday 
                    with a thirty-ought-six, plugged 
                    him through the heart.

                                  RACHEL
                    Said she got tired of him getting 
                    drunk and beating her up.  

                                  TIM
                    She was arraigned this morning.  
                    Released on her own recognizance.  

                                  ART
                    Seems the prosecutor is aware of 
                    what a known a-hole Bowman was and 
                    would rather plea it out than go to 
                    trial.  I was thinking she might be 
                    a way for us to find Boyd.                                                                                     29.



                                  RAYLAN
                    You speak to her?

                                  RACHEL
                    I did.  I told her Boyd s probably 
                    gonnacome looking for her.  She 
                    said it s none of our business.  I 
                    told her it is if he shoots her.

                                  FRANK
                    And what did you tell her first?

                                  RACHEL
                    I told her the only problem with 
                    what she did is she waited too 
                    long.  First time he laid a hand on 
                    her, she should ve cut off his man-
                    beans with a tiling knife.

                                  FRANK
                    Man-beans.  Lovely.

                          (to Raylan)
                    You want to talk to Ava?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I wouldn t mind.

      I/E. CAR/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

      Raylan drives along a two-lane blacktop, comes to a t-
      intersection.There s a shuttered, out-of-season fruit stand 
      across the road.  On top of the fruit stand, a weathered 
      billboard proclaims: JESUS SAVES!  Raylan turns left.

      I/E. CAR/NARROW COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

      Raylan drives along a narrow, twisting one-lane dirt road 
      that winds through the trees.  Raylan is deep in thought as 
    he drives.  Thinking.  Remembering.  In his mind he hears the 
      crunch of a football tackle and the roar of a crowd.


      Raylan walks up to the open front door, peers inside.  He s 
      about to knock when a woman comes out of the back.  AVA, 40s, 
    in a soiled t-shirtover a housedress, her hair a mess.  It 
      only takes her a second to realize who she s looking at.

                                  AVA
                    Oh my God -- Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (stepping inside)
                    You remember me, huh?

                                  AVA
                    I never forgot you.

    Ava steps up to hug him.  Raylan quite naturally takes her in 
    his arms.  And then she kisses him.  On the lips.  And Raylan 
      doesn t stop her.  He hangs with the kiss until Ava finally 
      pulls back.

                                  AVA (CONT D)
                    I had a crush on you from the time 
                    I was twelve years old.  I knew you 
                    liked me, but you didn t want to 
                    show it.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You were too young.

                                  AVA
                    I was sixteen when you left.  I heard 
                    you got married.  Are you still?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Turned out to be a mistake.

                                  AVA
                    You want to talk about mistakes...  
                    I told Bowman I wanted a divorce?  
                    He goes,  You file, you ll never be 
                    seen again.   Said I d disappear 
                    from the face of the earth.                                                                                    31.



      A look passes between them.  Ava aims to change the mood.

                                  AVA (CONT'D)
                    Coffee?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I d love some.

      Raylan follows Ava into the kitchen, watches her make coffee.

                                  AVA
                    I married him a year out of high 
                    school because he was cute, he was 
                    sure of himself and he told me he d 
                    never work in a goddamncoal mine.  
                    He d wear the blue and white of the 
                    University of Kentucky then get 
                    drafted by a pro team, he wouldn t 
                    mind the Cowboys.  But colleges 
                    either wouldn t take his grades or 
                    didn t think he was good enough.  
                    He blamed me for it.  Said it was 
                    all my fault.  My fault he had to 
                    dig coal.  My fault he hit me.
                          (beat)
                    I ran off to Corbin and got a job 
                    at the Holiday Inn waiting tables.  
                    He wooed me back, saying he missed 
                    me.  Wasn t long before it was all 
                    my fault again.  My fault I 
                    miscarried after he beat me with 
                    his belt.  My fault he didn t have 
                    a son to take hunting with him and 
                    his creepy brother.
                          (beat)
                    Last time he hit me it was because 
                    I called his brother creepy.  He 
                    kept after me with his belt till I 
                    fell and hit my head on the stove. 
                          (beat)
                    I got up from that floor knowing he 
                    would never hit me again.
                          (beat)
                    The next night, he came in, I had 
                    his favorite supper on the table -- 
                    ham and yams, cream-style corn and 
                    leftover okra fixed with tomatoes.   
                    I waited until he was shoveling food 
                    into his face, then got his deer 
                    rifle from the kitchen closet and 
                    went in and did what I had to do.

      Raylan looks at the table where Bowman met his end.                                                                                    32.



                                  RAYLAN
                    Did you load the rifle before 
                    firing it?

                                  AVA
                    Is that my old friend Raylan asking 
                    or is that the lawman?
                          (beforehe can answer)
                    Bowman always kept it loaded.  I ve 
                    still got a knot where I fell and 
                    hit my head on the stove.  You want 
                    to feel it?

    Ava puts her fingers into her hair, probing for the bump.  
    She stops.

                                  AVA (CONT D)
                    Dear Lord my hair s a mess.  

    She hurries to the bedroom.

                                  AVA (CONT D)
                    You close your eyes, I don t want 
                    you to see me like this.

    Ava disappears into the bedroom, shuts the door.  Raylan 
      pours himself a cup of coffee.  Ava calls out.

                                  AVA (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    I was always proud of you, what you 
                    done with your life.  Some folks 
                    thought it odd, but it always made 
                    perfect sense to me.

                                  RAYLAN
                    How so?

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    Your house was crazy, but you 
                    always walked the line.  Raylan 
                    Givens had his rules -- like not 
                    making time for a pretty 
                      cheerleader who had a crush on him.
                          (beat)
                    I heard your father isn t doing well.  
                    You been to see him?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Not yet.

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    What would you do if you dropped by 
                    and he was up to something?                                                                                    33.



                                  RAYLAN
                    Depends on what he was up to I suppose.

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    By the way, I was right.

                                  RAYLAN
                    About what?

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    About having a crush on you.  
                    You re a good kisser.

                                  RAYLAN
                    And I was thinking we have to stop 
                    doing that.

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    Why?

                                  RAYLAN
                    This isn t a social call, Ava.  I 
                    came to Harlan on business.  

                                  AVA (O.S.)
                    You tell me all about your business 
                    when I get out of the shower.

      Raylan hears the shower start.  A beat, then the front door 
      bangs open and in walks Dewey.  He looks Raylan up and down.

                                  DEWEY
                    Who in the hell are you, the 
                      undertaker?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I might be undertaking a situation.  
                    Let s see what you got on your chest.

      Raylan just walks up to Dewey and parts his shirt to reveal 
    the HEILHITLERtattoo and the gator-teethnecklace.

                                  RAYLAN (CONT'D)
                    You buy that necklace or poach the 
                    gatorand yank her teeth out?

                                  DEWEY
                    Who areyou?

      Raylan flips open his case to show his star.                                                                                    34.

                          (flipscase closed)
                    You mind telling me who you are?

                                  DEWEY
                    I m Dewey.  Dewey Crowe.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What are you doing here, Mr. Crowe?

                                  DEWEY
                    I come to take Ava some place.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Lemme tell you something.  You 
                    don t walk in a person s house 
                     less you re invited.  What you 
                    better do, go on outside and knock 
                    on the door.  If Ava wants to see 
                    you I ll let you in.  She doesn t, 
                    you can be on your way.

      Raylan watches Dewey, curious to see how he ll take it.

                                  DEWEY
                    All right.  I m gonnago out.
                          (beat)
                    Then I m coming back in.

      Dewey turns and heads out the door.

      I/E. AVA S HOUSE - DAY

      Raylan walks over and stands in the doorway.  He watches 
      Dewey hurry to his old Caddy and open the trunk.  Raylan 
      takes off his suit coat and hooks it on the doorknob.


      Ava s in a tank top and shorts, a towel wrapped around her 
    wet hair, pouring Jim Beam into a couple of tumblers.

                                  AVA
                    You want something with yours?  I ve 
                    got Diet Coke, RC, Dr. Pepper...

                                  RAYLAN
                    Just ice, if you have some.

    Ava nods, gets an ice tray from the freezer.

                                  AVA
                    I ever forget to fill the trays 
                      Bowman dstart slapping me.  What s 
                    wrong with you?  Don t you know how 
                    to keep house? 

    Ava puts ice in the tumblers, carries them over to the table 
      where she shot Bowman to death.  She and Raylan sit.  

                                  RAYLAN
                    You haven t seen Boyd, have you?  I 
                    mean since?

                                  AVA
                    No, but he ll be after me, I know.  
                    He s beenafter me.  I assume 
                    that s the reason he sent Dewey.  
                    Why?  You looking for him?

                                  RAYLAN
                    We are.  But we have to catch him 
                    in the act.  Robbing a bank, 
                    blowing up a church... making an 
                    attempt on your life.

                                  AVA
                    Mine?

                                  RAYLAN
                    You said yourself he ll be coming 
                    after you.

                                  AVA
                    Raylan, Boyd don t want to shoot me, 
                    he wants to... go to bed with me.  
                    You want me to help you catch him?                                                                                    38.



                                  RAYLAN
                    Do you know where he is?

                                  AVA
                    Sure I do.  He s in church.
                            (offRaylan s look)
                    He bought an old rundown chapel up 
                    on SukeyRidge.


      Devil is at the window.

                                  DEVIL
                    Who do you know drives a Town Car?

                                  BOYD
                    Why don t we find out.

                                  DEVIL
                    Ain t anyone I ve seen before.

      Boyd goes to the window, looks out, sees a man in a Stetson
      approaching.  Boyd breaks into a wide smile.

                                  BOYD
                    It s my old buddy, Raylan Givens.


      Pastor Israel Fandi is sitting in the dark, looking through 
    the half-glass of a door into the brightly lit hallway.

      Boyd is one of SIX MEN standing against the wall of the 
      hallway, staring straight ahead.

    In the office, Art, Raylan and the SOG are looking at Fandi.  
      Finally, Fandi shakes his head -- sorry.


      Raylan is in with Art.

                                  ART
                    It s become something personal?

                                  RAYLAN
                    That s what it looks like, since Boyd 
                    and I go back, but I think the only 
                    personal part is him not making a 
                    play when I went to see him.

                                  ART
                    What dhe say exactly?  He scoming 
                    for you or we recoming?

                                  RAYLAN
                    He said hewas.

                                  ART
                    But we don t know if he wants to 
                    shoot you or blow you up, do we?

      Raylan shakes his head.

                                  ART (CONT D)
                    Or, Boyd might jump the gun, do it 
                    ahead of time, when you aren t 
                    looking.  I was you I d check under 
                    the car before you turn the key.

      Raylan gives him a look.

                                  ART (CONT D)
                    We re like big game hunters.  Only 
                    you re the bait, like a goat 
                    tethered to a post.  All we have to 
                    do is keep you in sight.
                          (grins)
                    I knew bringing you here was a good 
                    idea.

      Raylan just looks at him.

      I/E. BOYD S PICKUP/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

      Boyd is driving with Devil and Dewey beside him.                                                                                    48.



                                  DEVIL
                    I thought you were giving him 
                      twenty-four hours.

                                  BOYD
                    What that means is the next time 
                    you see the fella, not the next day 
                    to the hour.  Hell, he could be dug 
                    in waiting for you.  
                          (beat)
                    You know Raylan will have his own 
                    people.  We just have to separate 
                    him from his pack of suits and get 
                    him off by hisself.

                                  DEVIL
                    You wanna blow up a car like when 
                    we re going at a bank?

                                  BOYD
                    What I want is for you fellasto 
                    locate Raylan at the courthouse and 
                    follow him.  I m gonnaget the Pork 
                    Brothers to watch the motel.


      Raylan comes out of the SOG offices.  He s surprised to see 
    Ava coming down the hall in dress-up clothes and pearls.

                                  RAYLAN
                    What brings you here?

                                  AVA
                    My lawyer s talking to the 
                      prosecutor.  Come on with me while 
                    I smoke.


    Ava wears a pretty dress.  Music is playing, the chicken is 
      frying, the biscuits are baking, the gravy is bubbling and 
      she s opening a bottle of wine.  

      There s a knock at the door and Ava smiles.

                                  AVA
                    Come on in, Marshal!  I m just 
                    opening the wine.  It s probably 
                    not as good as you re used to, but 
                    you d be surprised...

    She trails off when she sees Boyd standing in her living 
      room.

                                  BOYD
                    Hello there, Ava.  You expecting 
                    someone?

    And on Ava s expression--

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    52.



                                  ACT FIVE


    Ava looks at Boyd, decides there s no future in lying.

                                  AVA
                    I invited Raylan for a homecooked
                    supper but I don t know if he ll 
                    make it or not.

                                  BOYD
                    Why don t you call him and remind 
                    him?  He s at the Mount-Aire.  
                    Here s the number.

      Boyd hands Ava a slip of paper.

                                  AVA
                    You talked to him?

                                  BOYD
                    Honey, me and Raylan are old 
                    buddies.  I thought you knew that.

    Ava hesitates, knowing something s off.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Go on, give him a call.  But don t 
                    say I m here.

                                  AVA
                    Why not?

                                  BOYD
                    I m not staying, so why mention it.  
                    I can see you want to flirt with 
                    him some.

                                  AVA
                    We was neighbors, that s all.

                                  BOYD
                    I know, and you want to talk about old 
                    times and so on.  Go on, call him.


      Raylan answers the ringing phone.

                                  RAYLAN
                          (into phone)
                    Hello?                                                                                    53.



                                  AVA (V.O.)
                          (overphone)
                    Can you smell the chicken frying?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I sure can hear it.

                                  AVA (V.O.)
                    It ll be done by the time you get here.

      Raylan thinks for a moment, brow furrowed.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I m on my way.


      Raylan is in with Art, Rachel, Frank and Tim.

                                  ART
                    Let s say he is there.  You don t 
                    see it as Boyd using her?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I would except she asked me this 
                    afternoon at the courthouse.

                                  ART
                    She could ve been setting you up then.
                          (beat)
                    I think we ll tag along.

                                  RAYLAN
                    I could give you directions, but it s 
                    a lot of  turn left at the falling 
                    down barn.   You best just follow.

    Art nods.


    Ava steps back and Raylan enters.  He sees Boyd, sitting at 
    the table laid out with a platter of fried chicken, bowls of 
      mashed potatoes, peas and carrots, a plate of biscuits and a 
      gravy boat.  Boyd is pointing an Army Colt .45 at Raylan.

                                  BOYD
                    No shotguns allowed.  Toss it outside.

      Raylan does.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Ava, why don t you go to your 
                    bedroom, watch TV or something.
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    59.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                          (shehesitates)
                    Go on.

    Ava looks at Raylan.  He gives her a small nod and she goes.

      Boyd motions to Raylan with the .45.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    Come on.  Have a seat.  Help 
                    yourself.  The gravy ain t bad.  
                    Not as good as your mama s, but it 
                    never is, huh?

      Raylan sits at the other end of the table.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    When you shot that Eye-talianguy,  
                    was there food on the table?

                                  RAYLAN
                    No, but it was set, glasses and dishes.

                                  BOYD
                    Have something.

      Raylan picks up a drumstick with his left hand.

                                  BOYD (CONT D)
                    You had your gun -- what was it?

                                  RAYLAN
                    That time?  A Berettanine.

                                  BOYD
                    Where was your gun -- where mine is?

                                  RAYLAN
                    It was holstered.

                                  BOYD
                    Bullshit.

                                  RAYLAN
                    It was holstered.

                                  BOYD
                    Where was his?

                                  RAYLAN
                    In a beach bag, between his knees.

                                  BOYD
                    What dhe have in the bag -- what 
                    kind of piece?                                                                                    60.



                                  RAYLAN
                    I don t recall.

                                  BOYD
                    How dyou know when to pull?

                                  RAYLAN
                    He went first.

                                  BOYD
                    You gave him twenty-four hours -- 
                    the time was up when you shot him?

                                  RAYLAN
                    Pretty close.

                                  BOYD
                    How much time you think you got 
                    left now?

                                  RAYLAN
                    I thought till noon tomorrow.

                                  BOYD
                    I m saying it s right now,  less 
                    you want to eat first.

                                  RAYLAN
                    You can call it off, I don t mind.

                                  BOYD
                    If you re gonnakeep after me, 
                    might as well get  erdone.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Your forty-five s on the table but I 
                    have to pull.  Is that how we do it?

                                  BOYD
                    Well, shit yeah, it s my call.  
                    What reyou packing?

                                  RAYLAN
                    You ll pay to find that out.

                                  BOYD
                    Ice water in your veins, huh?
                          (beat)
                    You want a shot of Jim Beam to go 
                    with it?
                            (callingover shoulder)
                    Ava!  Could you get us...?                                                                                    61.



    He trails off when he senses motion.  Ava is approaching, but 
    not from the bedroom.  She s coming from the living room, 
      shotgun leveled at Boyd.

                                  AVA
                    You want to know what Bowman said 
                    when he looked up and saw me with 
                    his deer rifle?

                                  BOYD
                    Honey, you only shoot people when 
                    they re having their supper?

    He looks to Raylan for appreciation of his quip, gets nothing.

                                  AVA
                    He had his mouth full of sweet 
                    potato and he said,  The hell you 
                    doing with that? 

                                  BOYD
                    Honey, put it down, would you, please?

      Boyd picks up a paper napkin, begins wiping his hands.  
      Raylan tucks a napkin corner into his collar, smooths it with 
    his right hand.

                                  AVA
                    And you know what I said?  I said, 
                     I m gonnashoot you, dummy. 

    Ava jerks the shotgun to her cheek and aims.

      Boyd grabs his Colt and points it at Ava.

    In one fluid motion, Raylan pulls his .45 and shoots Boyd 
      dead center, punching him back out of his chair, just as Ava 
      fires the shotgun, missing, a 12-gaugepattern ripping into 
    the bare wall.

      Raylan gets up, gun still in his hand, pulls away the napkin 
    and walks over to Boyd.  

                                  AVA (CONT D)
                    Is he dead?

      Boyd s pistol is out of his hand.  He s trying to say 
      something.  Raylan drops to one knee, listens. 

                                  BOYD
                    You killed me.                                                                                    62.



                                  RAYLAN
                    I m sorry.  But you called it.

    Ava watches Raylan with Boyd.  Raylan stands.

                                  AVA
                    He dead?

                                  RAYLAN
                    He is now.

                                  AVA
                          (beat)
                    Why dyou say you were sorry?

                                  RAYLAN
                          (beat)
                    Boyd and I dug coal together.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                  END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                    63.



                                  TAG


      Gary and Winona are in bed, lights out, asleep.  Gary wakes, 
      gets out of bed, moves sleepily toward the bathroom.

                                  WINONA
                    Toilet s broken.  

      Gary keeps going.

                                  WINONA (CONT D)
                    And do not even THINK of pissingin 
                    the tub.  Or the sink.

      Gary changes course and heads out into the hall.


      Gary comes out into the hall, feels a breeze.

                                  GARY
                    You leave the deck door open?

                                  WINONA
                    No, I did not leave the deck door 
                    open.

                                  GARY
                    Someone did and it sure as hell 
                    wasn t me.

      Gary moves off down the hall and into the kitchen.  He stops 
      when he sees...

      A FIGURE sitting at his kitchen table, drinking a beer, the 
      deck door open behind him.  

                                  GARY (CONT D)
                    What the--?

    The man at the table turns on the light.  It s Raylan.

                                  RAYLAN
                    Hello, Gary.

      Poor Gary almost shitshimself.                                                                                    64.
