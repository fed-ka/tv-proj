                                          TEASER

      FADE IN:

      We HEAR her breathing first. It s panicked and rushed.

      UNKNOWN POV as we run through the thick brush of an urban 
      PARK, ducking and weaving. It s twilight; the long shadows 
      make it hard to see. It could almost be a dream.

      Snap. We look back. There s a flash of black moving through 
      the trees. Someone is chasing us.

      We jump a railing and land on a steep paved path, startling a 
      few PEDESTRIANS. We turn right but there s another HOODED 
      FIGURE at the bottom of the stairs. We turn the other way and 
      start sprinting up the hill.

      At the top there s a building - COIT TOWER - and we duck into 
        a vestibule. Finally, we PULL BACK to reveal that the 
      panicked runner is our heroine...

      CHLOE KING, just 16, and she truly looks like she s running 
      for her life. This is most definitely not a dream.

      She catches a glimpse of a hooded-figure racing past. He 
      didn t see her. Chloe immediately doubles back and heads into 
      the building.


      INT. COIT TOWER - CONTINUOUS

      Chloe sprints up the winding stairs.


      EXT. COIT TOWER/ROOF - CONTINUOUS

      Chloe has a BIRD S EYE view of the park two hundred feet 
      below. The two hooded-figures jog past, obviously still 
      looking for our girl. One of them glances up and Chloe 
      immediately pulls back in, holding her breath.

      They didn t see her and start to move away. For the moment 
      she s safe. Chloe lets out a SIGH of relief. She turns away 
      from the railing but stops short because...

          A terrifying-looking MAN with three scars down the side of 
      his face is standing directly in front of her. 

                                  MAN
                    Good-bye, Chloe.

      She doesn t even have time to scream before he violently 
      shoves her backwards.    "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               2.              


      SLOW MOTION as Chloe flips back over the railing, desperately 
      grasping at nothing. The man is already gone. She catches a 
      glimpse of the ground below as...

      BACK TO REAL TIME. Chloe plummets toward the ground.


      EXT. COIT TOWER - CONTINUOUS

      SMACK! Chloe slams against the pavement. A WOMAN SCREAMS. 
      Several PEOPLE rush to her side.

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)
                    She s dead.

      CONTINUALLY TIGHTEN ON CHLOE s lifeless face as BLOOD starts 
      to ooze out from under her head.

                                        ACT ONE


      EXT. SAN FRANCISCO SKYLINE - DAWN

      The morning sun illuminates the spectacular skyline. WRITTEN 
      ACROSS the screen is... 

                                      TWO DAYS EARLIER


      EXT. DOWNTOWN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAWN

      Warm light hits the colorful row houses that line this San 
      Francisco street. Sun glints off of one WINDOW in particular.


      INT. CHLOE S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Chloe, our until now pleasantly average, rule-following 
      teenager, stretches luxuriously in the rectangle of sun lying 
      across her bed. She wakes up slowly, eyes still closed, a 
      half-smile on her face. Life is good.


      INT. CHLOE S HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      MEREDITH KING, Chloe s mom, attractive, harried, professional 
      and remarkably young at heart hurries past, buttoning her 
      blouse. She only breaks stride to BANG on Chloe s door. 

                                  MEREDITH
                    Chloe! Get up! I swear to God I am 
                    not driving you to school today.


      INT. CHLOE S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      But no response from Chloe as she pulls up first one leg and 
      then the other, clearly in no rush.

      Suddenly, Chloe s phone BUZZES and she reads the text. 
      Instantly, she flips out of bed and is on the move.


      INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

      Meredith is at the counter, reading the paper, when she 
      glances at the clock. She takes a calming breath and--

                                  MEREDITH
                    Chloe King! If you re not down here 
                    in five-    "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               4.              


      But Chloe is already charging down the stairs putting her 
      hair back in a clip.

                                  CHLOE
                    Calm down, crazy lady. You re gonna 
                    pop something you might need.

      She grabs her mother s toast as she heads for the door.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Chloe.

                                  CHLOE
                    Sorry. No time. I have a super mean 
                    mom who won t drive me to school.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Chloe!

                                  CHLOE
                    What?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Sit.

      Chloe plunks down at the counter and bites off a hunk of 
      toast. Meredith sips her coffee. Finally.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    So--?

                                  CHLOE
                          (resigned)
                    Fine. I got a B on my English test. 
                    It turns out that isolation is not 
                    a central theme of Grapes of Wrath. 
                    That slutty girl who everyone 
                    thought was going to get pregnant - 
                    she s pregnant. And, no, at no 
                    point did any even remotely cute 
                    boy look my way and say I want some 
                    of that. So - uh, pretty much all 
                    is right with the world.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Was that so hard?
                          (off Chloe s look)
                    Go.

      Chloe bolts, but she only get two steps before...

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Chloe.    "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               5.              


      Chloe lets out the biggest SIGH.  Now what?

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Your backpack.

                                  CHLOE
                          (kissing her good-bye)
                    See? This is why they put you in 
                    charge. Text me.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I love you, too.

                                  CHLOE
                    Implied!

      The front door BANGS closed. Meredith just smiles. 


      EXT. CHLOE S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

      Chloe runs down the front steps and hops into the passenger 
      side of an old, beater VW BUG.


      INT./EXT. - AMY S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Chloe s best friend AMY, 16, is behind the wheel. Amy, hidden 
      inside a poofy, fake-fur coat, is a vintage queen leaning 
      toward Goth, but a certain amount of innate wholesomeness 
      always manages to creep through.

                                  CHLOE
                    Go! I promised my mom I wouldn t 
                    drive with you anymore.

      Amy tries to peel out but stalls the car instead.

                                  AMY
                    You can t yell at me like that and 
                    expect me to perform. You know how 
                    I am with pressure.

                                  CHLOE
                    Sorry.

      They drive off, still lurching a little along the way.

                                  AMY
                    And that last ticket was so not my 
                    fault.    "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               6.              


      INT. AMY S CAR - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

      Amy, never taking her eyes off the road, hands Chloe a latte.

                                  AMY
                    Don t spill.
                          (beat)
                    Okay, so here s the plan. After 
                    school I have band, but as soon as 
                    we re done murdering  Poker Face , 
                    I ll pick up Paul, he s ditching 
                    Chinese again, and we ll meet you 
                    at the park.

                                  CHLOE
                          (smiling)
                    I was afraid we weren t going to do 
                    anything.

                                  AMY
                    Please. This is how we always kick-
                    off birthday week.

                                  CHLOE
                    Yup. This is what we always do.

                                  AMY
                          (off light)
                    Aah. Yellow. Go. Stop. No...

      Finally, she slams on the breaks. They screech to a stop 
      halfway into the crosswalk. Amy shoots the annoyed 
      pedestrians a what s-your-problem look. After a beat.

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    Don t you wanna go?

                                  CHLOE
                    No. I do. It s... I don t know.

                                  AMY
                    Are you okay?

                                  CHLOE
                    Yeah. I just woke up feeling kinda 
                    weird.  It ll be fun.

      A car behind them HONKS and they start up again.


      EXT. AMY S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      As the car pulls away, we catch a REFLECTION in the glass of 
      Chloe s window. It s of a MAN in a long, BLACK, LEATHER coat.     "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               7.              


      We don t see his face. But Chloe does - he seems to be 
      watching them. She quickly turns away.


      EXT. MARINA GREEN - DUSK

      CLOSE ON a SLICE of PIZZA with a bunch of candles in it. 
      REVEAL it s being held by PAUL, 16, Chloe s other best 
      friend. Paul is tall, Asian-American, and just beginning the 
      move from Geekville to Handsometown.

                                  PAUL
                    Hurry. Make a wish! My hand s on 
                    fire.

      Chloe takes a big breath and blows out the candles.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    And now it s covered in spit. This 
                    one is definitely yours.
                          (beat)
                    What d you wish for?

                                  AMY
                    You can t tell. She can t tell.

                                  CHLOE
                    It wasn t even really... I just 
                    wished for things to be different.

                                  AMY
                    What things?

                                  CHLOE
                      Everything.

                                  AMY
                    You mean you want more than two 
                    friends.

                                  CHLOE
                    Amy. Not about you. 

      Chloe stands up on one of the wood POSTS that hold up the 
      heavy chain that separates the grass from the bike path. She 
      has a perfect view of the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Would kinda like to be kissed once 
                    in my life.

                                  PAUL
                    Hey! You ve been kissed.    "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               8.              


                                  CHLOE
                    We were seven.

                                  AMY
                    And clearly so traumatized by the 
                      experience it s taken her almost 
                    ten years to want to do it again.

                                  PAUL
                    And right back to  hey .

                                  CHLOE
                    I just feel like I want to take a 
                    risk. Do something... special. Be 
                    noticed. Maybe I m just tired of 
                    being the good girl.

                                  PAUL
                    Uh, how are you doing that?

      REVEAL that Chloe is balancing in the center of the CHAIN 
      strung between the posts.

                                  CHLOE
                    I don t know. It s easy. 

      She balances on one foot for a moment, showing off and hops 
      down. Paul immediately tries to duplicate the feat.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    It sounds so lame when I say it out 
                    loud, but I wanna do something 
                      dangerous. Different. Just not be 
                    me for a little while. It s hard to 
                    explain.

      After a beat.

                                  AMY
                    So do you wanna go back to my house 
                    and watch a movie?

                                  CHLOE
                    Were you not just listening to me?

                                  AMY
                    Yeah, but that s what we always do.

      OOF! Suddenly, Paul flips off the chain and lands on his back 
      between them. Ouch.

                                  PAUL
                    You re a liar. That is so not easy.

                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                    Hey, lets go to my house and play 
                    World of Warcraft. You can totally 
                    pick the realm.

      Chloe just starts to smile, mischievously.

                                  CHLOE
                    Thanks. But I ve got a better idea.


      EXT. THE BANK - MOMENTS LATER

      The three of them are standing across the street from THE 
      BANK, a pulsing club that the young and beautiful are lined 
      up to get into. Amy doesn t look too sure.

                                  PAUL
                    So much better.

                                  CHLOE
                    Come on.

      They cross the street, dodging traffic, but the entrance is 
      blocked by a couple of BIG GUYS checking IDs.

                                  AMY
                    There s is no way they re letting 
                    any of us in there.

      Chloe looks down the alley that runs along the side of the 
      building. Nothing. But suddenly...

      A FRAT BOY and his GIRLFRIEND tumble out of the fire exit 
      just before Frat Boy vomits over the railing. Nice. Chloe 
      sees her chance and slips in behind them. Chloe holds the 
      door. Let s go! Now or never.

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    No. Chloe. We can t--

      Paul hesitates for only a second before following after her. 

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    Wait for me.

      And she hustles up the steps.


      INT. THE BANK - MOMENTS LATER

      They make their way through the crowded, throbbing space and 
      find room at the end of the bar. Amy is super uncomfortable, 
      but Paul can barely contain his smile. He nods and WINKS at 
      two MODELS - they immediately move away.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               10.              


                                  CHLOE
                    Don t do that. Be cool.

      Just then a good-looking, young guy, XAVIER, slides up next 
      to Chloe and checks her out. She shoots her friends a look. 
      See? This is how it s done.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Hi.

                                  XAVIER
                    Hey.
                          (beat)
                    Don t take this the wrong way, but 
                    you look kinda young.

                                  CHLOE
                    I m over eighteen.

                                  XAVIER
                    Good to know. But you have to be 
                    over twenty-one.

                                  CHLOE
                          (not cool)
                    Please don t tell anyone.

                                  XAVIER
                    It s okay. I m using my brother s 
                    ID.

      Chloe smiles, relieved, then...

                                  CHLOE
                    Dance with me!

      She doesn t really give him a chance to respond as she pulls 
      him onto the dance floor.

      DANCE FLOOR - LATER

      Chloe and Xavier are burning up the place - actually, Xavier 
      is just doing his best to keep up. Chloe is sexy and free and 
      loving every minute of it.  Who is this girl?


      EXT. THE BANK - LATER

      Chloe and Xavier come out of the club, hot and sweaty.

                                  XAVIER
                    Okay, you, my young friend, are 
                    wild.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               11.              


                                  CHLOE
                          (pleased)
                    No one s ever said that about me 
                    before.

                                  XAVIER
                    I find that hard to believe.
                          (beat)
                    You know, my brother s place is 
                    just a couple of blocks...

                                  CHLOE
                    I m not that wild. Yet.
                          (beat)
                    I really, truly, have got to go.
                          (looking around)
                    I still can t believe that Amy and 
                    Paul ditched me.

                                  XAVIER
                    Will you maybe at least call me?

      Chloe hands him her phone and he puts in his info.

                                  CHLOE
                          (off screen)
                     Xavier . I like the name.

                                  XAVIER
                    Lets hope you like the face that 
                    goes with it.

      She snaps a picture of him.

                                  CHLOE
                    I think I do. See ya.

      She starts to go but stops and glances back. Then... 

      Chloe walks up to Xavier and KISSES him. Hard. When she lets 
      go he s not quite sure what hit him and touches his lips.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    See? I knew I d been missing out.

                                  XAVIER
                    Wow. Uh, are you sure I can t at 
                    least give you a ride? It s pretty 
                    cold out.

                                  CHLOE
                    I like it. Makes me feel alive.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               12.              


      And this time she really does go, running off across the 
      street for home.

      REVEAL that our FIGURE in the long, black, leather coat is 
      watching her from the alley. We only see him from behind.

                                        ACT TWO


      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/HALLWAY - DAY

      Chloe is next to her locker, anxiously scanning the CROWDED 
      hallway when she spots a poofy fur coat make a hasty U-turn.

                                  CHLOE
                    Amy!

      Amy doesn t slow down. Chloe catches up and cuts her off. Amy 
      side-steps and keeps on walking as Chloe follows.

                                  AMY
                          (super uncomfortable)
                    Oh, hey, Chloe. 

                                  CHLOE
                    I can t believe that you just left 
                    me there. But you re forgiven - I 
                    ended up having like the greatest 
                    night of my entire life.

      Amy stops.

                                  AMY
                    Why? Because we left?

                                  CHLOE
                    No. Because of him.

      She shows Amy the picture of Xavier on her phone.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    His name s Xavier. And he kissed 
                    me. We kissed each other. Yesterday 
                    I said I wanted it to happen and it 
                    did. Actually, I made it happen 
                    which is kind of even cooler.

                                  AMY
                    Ohmigod, Chloe, I can t believe--
                          (then, looking off)
                    Look perky.  From Russia With Love  
                    at ten o clock.

      Chloe glances back and sees ALEK PETROV, 17, tall and 
      impossibly good-looking, coming down the hall with his POSSE, 
      bouncing a BASKETBALL off of the walls. BAM. BAM.

                                  CHLOE
                    That is your crazy obsession, not 
                    mine.

                          (back to her story)
                    I still can t believe I actually 
                    did it. You would have been so 
                    proud of me. I just walked straight 
                    up to him--

      BAM. Alek s basketball hits the wall above Chloe s head.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    I don t even know if I m ever going 
                    to talk to him again, but--

      BAM. It hits the locker next to her. Chloe s had it. BAM--

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Hey, Jockoff.

      Chloe grabs the ball--

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Do you mind? People are trying to 
                    have a conversation. Go play  Look 
                    At Me  somewhere else.

      -- and rifles it down the hall where it bounces off a wall 
      and SWOOSHES straight into a TRASH CAN. Everyone turns to 
      look at her.

                                  AMY
                    You did not just do that.

      Chloe looks as shocked as everyone else.

                                  CHLOE
                    I think I did. Let s go.

      She grabs her friends arm and they self-consciously hurry 
      off. Alek watches Chloe disappear up the stairs. We re not 
      quite sure what his look is about.


      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CLASSROOM - LATER

      Chloe is sitting near the back. She s TAPPING her pencil as 
      she stares out the window, clearly her mind is elsewhere.

      Her cellphone vibrates. It simply says  157 . But before 
      Chloe can even react--

                                    TEACHER
                    Miss King? The answer, please.

                                  CHLOE
                    Ah, 157.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               15.              


      The TEACHER, slightly annoyed, turns back to the board as 
      Chloe scans the room. Alek looks back at her from the front 
      row and holds up his cellphone.


      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/HALLWAY - LATER

      Chloe is at her locker when Alek comes up - his bad-boy smile 
      and charming ACCENT make him a hard guy not to like.

                                  ALEK
                    You re welcome.

                                  CHLOE
                    Thanks. I owe you.

                                  ALEK
                    I look forward to collecting.

      He steps into her personal space. Chloe instinctively backs 
      up, but the locker is behind her.

                                  CHLOE
                    Um, you haven t spoken to me in two 
                    years.  Let s go back to that.

                                  ALEK
                    You smell very good.

                                  CHLOE
                    Okay, crazy non sequitur man, it s 
                    called bathing. Try it.

                                  ALEK
                          (amused)
                    Why do you give me such a hard 
                    time, Chloe King?

                                  CHLOE
                    Believe me, if I knew it was going 
                    to have this kind of affect, I 
                    never would have touched your ball.
                          (quickly)
                    Don t say it.

                                  ALEK
                    Something tells me we re going to 
                    be very good friends.

      He starts to lean in. Holy crap - is he really going to kiss 
      her? Chloe seems frozen when suddenly--

                                    JASMINE (O.S.)
                    Alek!  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               16.              


        A beautiful, but not very happy girl, JASMINE, 16, calls out 
      from the end of the hall. She and Alek exchange a look. After 
      a beat, Alek turns back to Chloe and shrugs.

                                  CHLOE
                    Well, uh, nice chattin . Lets try 
                    and never do that again.

      Chloe walks off as Alek and Jasmine exchange another look.


      EXT. PATEENA - DAY

      A hip vintage clothing store on a bustling street.

                                  CHLOE (O.S.)
                    When did we get these in?


      INT. PATEENA - CONTINUOUS

      Chloe is looking in a mirror while she holds up a fairly sexy 
      black top. Her slightly bitchy, co-worker LANA, 19, looks up 
      from the magazine she s reading behind the register.

                                  LANA
                      Yesterday, when somebody decided to 
                    take off early and left me to do 
                    all the restocking.

                                  CHLOE
                    Which is why it still hasn t been 
                    done.
                          (re: top)
                    I m going to put this on hold.

                                  LANA
                    For you?
                          (off Chloe s look)
                    I m just sayin  that s not exactly 
                    the kind of top that likes to sit 
                    home by itself on Saturday night.

      Chloe looks in the mirror again. Maybe it isn t her. After a 
      beat...

                                  CHLOE
                    Oh, turn it up. I love that song.

      LANA looks down at her ipod with its earbuds attached, lying 
      on the counter. There seems to be no sound coming out.

                    You can hear that?  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               17.              


                                  CHLOE
                    Sure. Can t you?

      Lana looks at her suspiciously, but the JINGLE of the front 
      door changes the subject. A handsome guy in a motorcycle 
      jacket has come in and is going through the racks. Chloe and 
      Lana exchange looks - Chloe, gives her a  watch this  and 
      heads across the store.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Hi.

      The guy turns around. He s BRIAN, 18, a tall, sweet, good-
      looking guy with kind eyes. Chloe wasn t totally prepared for 
      how cute he was going to be.

                                  BRIAN
                    Hi.

      Suddenly MUSIC comes on a little too loud, then Lana quickly 
      turns it down.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    I love that song.

                                  CHLOE
                    I just said that--

      But she knocks over a coat rack. CRASH. Oops. Once again so 
      much for being smooth. He quickly helps her pick it up. 
      Finally, she takes a deep breath and...

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Can I help you with something?

                                  BRIAN
                    Just an opinion.

      He puts on a funky, knit cap that has little cat ears on it.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Ironic or just lame?

                                  CHLOE
                    Little bit of both? But it works 
                    with the jacket. You a cat person?

                                  BRIAN
                    Nah - I ve just got cold ears. I ll 
                    take it.

      He follows Chloe to the counter. Chloe smiles at Brian again. 
      She likes this guy.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               18.              


                                  CHLOE
                    So, you in college?

      But when he doesn t answer right away...

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    I m just asking because we get a 
                    lot of people from the university. 
                    We ran this ad - and you never 
                    really know if it s working or not

                          (to Chloe, sotto)
                    Stop talking.

                          (then, re: hat)
                    I kinda packed in a hurry. 

                                  CHLOE
                    I m Chloe.

                    in case there s anything else you

                                  BRIAN
                    Then maybe I ll see you around.
                          (beat)
                    Sometime between three and six.

      One more furtive look and Brian heads out.

                                  LANA
                    I don t know what you did with 
                    Chloe, but when you see her - tell 
                    her she needs to tag the sale rack.

      Chloe looks in the mirror again. She takes the top and puts 
      it behind the counter. She kind of likes this new her.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               19.              


      EXT. STREET - DAY

      Chloe is walking down the street, furiously texting.

                                  CHLOE
                          (sotto, while texting)
                    No. You have to meet me!

      She steps off the curb without looking and--

                                  BIKE MESSENGER
                    Watch out!

      A BIKE MESSENGER swerves to avoid hitting her. He skids to a 
      stop and looks back.

      But Chloe s not there. She s crouched on the roof of the car 
      next to where they should have hit.

                                  BIKE MESSENGER (CONT D)
                    How did you-- ?

      But Chloe has no idea. She s not sure how she got there 
      either, but a SMILE starts to creep across her face.


      EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET/ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

      Chloe is now sprinting down the steep, crowded street faster 
      than she could ever imagine possible as she ducks giddily 
      between people and obstacles. 

      At the last second she swerves and darts down an alley, 
      careening off the alley wall, five feet in the air.

      She races forward, jumping over trash cans, just clearing a 
      car as it pulls out in front of her. It s almost as if she s 
      flying.

      Ahead is a FIRE ESCAPE LADDER hanging down from a second 
      story. She picks up speed, leaps off of a dumpster and...

      ... just misses the ladder. She sails past and lands in a 
      pile of boxes. CRASH. There are limits. But still, it was 
      pretty cool.


      INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

      Amy, chopsticks stopped in mid-air, is staring across the 
      table at Chloe who is shoveling it in.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               20.              


                                  AMY
                    Wait. What? So suddenly you have 
                    like these super powers?

                                  CHLOE
                    Jumping over a dumpster doesn t 
                    really qualify as a super power. 
                    But it s kinda weird, right? It s 
                    like this burst of energy and I 
                    knew I could do it. Oh - and I can 
                    hear things.

                                  AMY
                    Like little men in your head 
                    things?

                    No.
                          (listening, then)
                    Ew, I think they just spit in that 
                    guys food.

      She turns around and a WAITER is setting food in front of a 
      very UNPLEASANT CUSTOMER. Several cooks are watching from the 
      kitchen, whispering. Amy pushes her food away.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    It s like my non-wish birthday wish 
                    came true. It s hard to explain. I 
                    just feel so different.

                                  AMY
                    What did you have for breakfast?

                                  CHLOE
                    Spinach. This isn t a fortified 
                    breakfast cereal thing.

                                  AMY
                    Hormonal?

                                  CHLOE
                    Yeah, no, that s a whole different 
                    kind of crazy.

                                  AMY
                    Obviously there has to be some kind 
                    of explanation. You know, other 
                    than... you re a freak.

                                  CHLOE

                                  AMY
                    I told him not to come.

                                  CHLOE
                    Why?

      After a beat.

                                  AMY
                    Paul and I made out!

                                  CHLOE
                    What?! When?

                                  AMY
                    Last night. At first it was just

                    now kind of thing, but then... not 
                    so much.

                                  CHLOE
                    You and Paul?

                                  AMY
                    I know. But don t worry, you re so 
                    not going to be a third wheel.

                                  CHLOE
                    Wait. You just kissed and now 
                    you re a couple? I ve talked to you 
                    everyday, all day, since we were 
                    like two and never once have you 
                    said that you had a thing for Paul. 

                                  AMY
                    I kind of didn t know until it 
                    happened. Are you jealous?

                                  CHLOE
                    Of you and Paul? Uh, no.

                                  AMY
                    You don t have to be mean.

                    I m not being mean. I m being

                    Was he any good?

                                  AMY
                      Surprisingly yes. At first it was a 
                    little awkward but then when we 
                    kinda got into it--

                                  CHLOE
                    Okay, no. I can accept it, I just 
                    can t hear about it.
                          (looking off)
                    Holy crap. There s Alek s 
                      girlfriend.

      Jasmine is coming in the front door.

                     Cause he kinda tried to kiss me.

                    Chloe! Did you let him?

                                  CHLOE

      EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT/STREET - SHORT TIME LATER

      UNKNOWN WATCHER POV as the girls come out of the restaurant 
      and head up the street. They re definitely being followed.

                                  AMY
                    Okay, we need to make a plan. First- 
                    wait a day and call Bank Boy.

                                  CHLOE
                    I don t know. That was just kind of 
                      a drive-by flirting.

                                  AMY
                    Two days ago your options were zero 
                    and no one. He stays on the list. 
                    And then there s Alek.

                                  CHLOE
                    His Slavic hotness? Let it go. It s 
                    never happening.

                                  AMY
                    Before you rush to judgement, you 
                    should see him with his shirt off.
                          (off Chloe s look)
                    Fine. Then that just leaves Kitty 
                    Hat.

                                  CHLOE
                    Now he s a definite yes.

      Suddenly, Chloe grabs Amy s arm and stops. She looks back.  
      No one is there.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Sorry. I thought I heard something.

                                  AMY
                    This isn t going to become a thing,

                          (beat)
                    So what do you think if the four of 
                    us went out on a double date 
                    sometime? Would it be weird?

      They stop next to Amy s car.

                    First of all, I don t know if I ll 
                    ever see him again. And second -
                    yeah, it d be weird. But I still 
                    want to go. I really am happy for 
                    you and Paul.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               24.              


                                  AMY
                    Thanks. Me too.
                          (getting into her car)
                    And Chloe - try not to wrestle too 
                    many bad guys on your way home.

      Back to our UNKNOWN WATCHER S POV as Chloe waves and walks 
      away. She turns back one more time - but still, no one is 
      there.  She shrugs and runs off across the street.


      EXT. DESERTED STREET  - MOMENTS LATER

      SMACK! Chloe lands in the middle of a sidewalk. She decides 
      which way to go for a moment, turns around and--

                                  BUM (O.S.)
                    Hey. Spare a buck?

      A fairly scary-looking BUM is right in front of her.

                                  CHLOE
                          (startled)
                    What? No. Sorry. 

                                  BUM
                    Then maybe something else.

      And he grabs her by the wrist before she can get away.

                                  CHLOE
                    HELP! Let go of me...

      They struggle and Chloe swings at him with her free hand. 
      AAAAH! The bum SCREAMS and lets go, stumbling backwards, 
      grabbing at his face.

                                  BUM
                    You bitch! What d you do to me?!

      He pulls his hand away and his face is shredded and bleeding. 
      He has four claw marks across his cheek. He immediately 
      stumbles back, trying to get away.

      Chloe looks down at her hand. She has CLAWS.


                                  END OF ACT TWO  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               25.              


                                      ACT THREE


      EXT. DESERTED STREET - CONTINUOUS

      Chloe stands staring down at her claws. CRASH. The bum she 
      just sliced and diced stumbles back over some trash cans.

                                  BUM
                    Stay away from me.

      You don t have to tell Chloe twice.  She takes off running.


      EXT. CHLOE S HOUSE - MOMENT LATER

      Chloe comes to a stop in front of her house, slightly out of 
      breath, and looks at her hands. They re perfectly normal.

      But then she flexes them and the claws reappear. SHLOOSH. 
      Holy crap. There s blood on the tips. They quickly retract. 
      Chloe hurries up the front steps.


      INT. CHLOE S HOUSE/KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

      Meredith is aggressively searching through the kitchen 
      drawers as Chloe comes in and heads straight for the sink, 
      and washes her hands.  

                                  CHLOE
                    Hey.

                                  MEREDITH
                          (still searching)
                    It s about time. You have really 
                    got to call if you re not coming 
                    straight home after work. 
                          (then)
                    Are you okay?

                                  CHLOE
                    Yeah, some crazy, old homeless guy 
                    tried to grab me.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Honey, are you hurt? Should we call 
                    the police?

                                  CHLOE
                    No! No - it s so not a big deal. 
                    I m fine.
                          (off her look)
                    Really. Life in the big city.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               26.              


      Meredith isn t completely convinced as she goes back to 
      searching the drawers.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    What are you looking for?

                                  MEREDITH
                    The exacto knife. My Wine-Of-The 
                    Month club box just came and trust 
                    me - not a moment too soon.

      Chloe looks at the large, sealed cardboard box on the counter 
      and then at her hands.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    I swear I just used it. Well, a 
                    month ago anyway.

                                  CHLOE
                    Done.

      Meredith turns. The box is open.

                                  MEREDITH
                    How did you...?

      Chloe just kind of shrugs as her mom pulls out the wine.

                                  CHLOE
                    I ll be up in my--

                                  MEREDITH
                    Sit.

      Chloe reluctantly sits.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    But in honor of your birthday, lets 
                    skip the talk and just have cake.

      Meredith sets a CAKE on the counter between them.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Happy birthday.

                                  CHLOE
                    No singing.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I m not the singer. That was your 
                    dad s--
                          (catching herself)
                    No singing.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               27.              


                                  CHLOE
                    Mom, it s okay. He left over ten 
                    years ago. I m good.

      Meredith cuts the cake and hands her daughter a piece.

                                  MEREDITH
                    So, in a not-snooping-not-judging 
                    way, I noticed you came in a little 
                    late last night. Did you and your 
                    posse--

                                  CHLOE
                    Don t say  posse .

                                  MEREDITH
                    ...rat pack, do anything special?

                                  CHLOE
                    Actually, yeah, we did. We went 
                      dancing... and I met a boy.
                          (quickly)
                    Do not squeal, cry or hug me!

      Meredith sits back down.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    And I met another one this 
                    afternoon at work. He was... nice.

      Chloe goes back to her cake.

                                  MEREDITH
                    That s it? That s all you re going 
                    to give me.

                                  CHLOE
                    That s kind of everything.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I m sensing more to this story. And 
                    you don t seem very excited.

                                  CHLOE
                    I am. I just... I ve got a lot of 
                    stuff going on.

                                  MEREDITH
                    What do you have going on?

      Chloe looks down at her hands again. After a beat...

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Chloe?  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               28.              


                                  CHLOE
                    Do you know anything about my birth 
                    parents?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Jesus Christ, Chloe. You re not 
                    going to cut me a break are you?

                                  CHLOE
                    Relax. This isn t a door slammy, 
                        you re-not-my-real-mother moment. 
                    I m just curious. I swear.

      After a beat, Meredith pours some more wine.

                                  MEREDITH
                    You already know everything I know, 
                    which is pretty much nothing.

                                  CHLOE
                    But no papers? No records?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Things were chaotic. The Soviet 
                    Union had just fallen. The Ukraine 
                    was a new country.  Your dad was 
                    working over there when he saw you 
                    in an orphanage and fell in love.

                                  CHLOE
                    I know all this.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I thought he was going to bring me 
                    home some of those stupid nesting 
                    dolls - I got a two month old baby 
                    instead. God, I wanted those dolls.

                                  CHLOE
                    But how did he get me out of the 
                    country? It doesn t make sense.
                          (off her mother s look)
                    What?

                                  MEREDITH
                      I think... some money might have 
                    changed hands.

                                  CHLOE
                    He stole me?

                                  MEREDITH
                    No. He didn t have a choice. That s 
                    just how it was done.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               29.              


                                  CHLOE
                    But didn t dad--

                                  MEREDITH
                          (sharp)
                    No. Your father wasn t big on 
                      explaining himself. Even then.
                          (softening)
                    I m sorry. I wish I knew the 
                    answers, too.

                                  CHLOE
                          (sincere)
                    Thanks for the cake.

      She kisses her mom and heads up the stairs. Meredith looks 
      after her concerned. Or is there something she s not telling?


      INT. CHLOE S ROOM - NIGHT

      Chloe is at her mirror. She checks out her eyes.  Her ears. 
      Nothing else has changed. What the hell is going on? She 
      doesn t even know what she is anymore.


      INT. PATEENA - DAY

      Chloe is absentmindedly staring out the window, while Amy 
      paws through a rack. Lana is behind the counter.

                                  AMY
                    What do you think? Paul loves 
                    vintage rock T s, but his mom 
                    refuses to let--

                                  CHLOE
                    Amy. Known him my whole life. Not 
                    new information.

      Amy looks at her friend for a moment.

                                  AMY
                    Okay, what is the matter with you? 
                    Did you take a header into a trash 
                    bin or are you just coming off of 
                    your crazy amp d-up birthday high?
                          (beat)
                    And do not tell me you can fly 
                    because if you do, I swear I ll 
                    have you committed.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               30.              


                                  CHLOE
                    No. Don t worry. I can t fly. That 
                    would... just be weird.

                                  AMY
                    Did you even call Bank Boy like we 
                    planned?

                                  CHLOE
                    You planned.

                                  AMY
                          (off Lana)
                    Don t give me that look. She s 
                    helping me. I m going to buy 
                      something.

      Lana looks doubtful and heads to the back. After a beat...

                                  CHLOE
                    I just can t figure out what is 
                    going on with me. Nothing makes any 
                    sense. Yesterday I was so--
                          (then)
                    What are you doing?!

                                  AMY
                          (dialing Chloe s phone)
                    Calling Bank Boy.

                                  CHLOE
                    Stop!

                                  AMY
                    Aah. It s ringing. Here.

      Chloe reluctantly takes it and glares at her  friend. 

                                  CHLOE
                    Message.
                          (beat)
                    Hi. This is Chloe. We, uh, met at 
                    the Bank the other night. Call me.
                          (hanging up, to Amy)
                    Never do that again.


      INT. XAVIER S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

      CLOSE ON a CELLPHONE. Its red message light is FLASHING. 
        Inexplicably it s on the floor.

      PULL BACK to reveal that Xavier is half-naked, lying next to 
      it. Eyes wide open. Lips blue. He s DEAD.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               31.              


      EXT. PATEENA - LATER

      SLAM! Chloe, with Amy s help, yanks the metal grate closed in 
      front of the store windows and starts on the padlock as Brian 
      comes up behind them

                                  BRIAN
                    You re closing early? Now how am I 
                    going to indulge my quirky headwear 
                    fetish?

                                  CHLOE
                          (sotto, to Amy)
                    Kitty Hat.
                          (to Brian)
                    Sorry. I should have warned you 
                    this happens... a lot.

                                  BRIAN
                    Just know I d planned on doing 
                    about fifteen minutes of humorous 
                    small talk before I was going to 
                    ask you this but - you wanna have a 
                    cup of coffee with me?

                                  CHLOE
                    I can t. Amy and I--

                                  AMY
                    Are parting ways because we have no 
                    plans together whatsoever. Bye.

      Amy quickly hustles off to her car. After a beat...

                                  BRIAN
                    I ll take that as a  yes .


      EXT. STREET/PARK - DAY

      Chloe and Brian, coffees in hand, walk along the edge of Coit 
      Tower Park, deep in conversation.

                                  CHLOE
                    He left when I was really young, so 
                    I barely even remember him. But 
                    four years ago I found this old 
                    email address my mom had hidden and 
                    I sent him a couple of messages. 

                                  BRIAN
                    Did he answer?  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               32.              


                                  CHLOE
                    No. I doubt it s even active. 
                    Actually, I don t even know if he s 
                    alive. But it s okay - my mom and I 
                    make a pretty good team. Do not 
                    tell her I said that.
                          (beat)
                    How about you? You get along with 
                    your parents?

                                  BRIAN
                    No mom - just a dad, and our 
                      relationship is  evolving.  My mom 
                    died five years ago and we ve both 
                    been a little lost ever since.

                                  CHLOE
                    Well, here s to being found.

      They tap cups. There s a chance they might kiss, but... 
      Suddenly, a large DOG starts BARKING and lunges for Chloe. 
      It s only stopped by the tight hold its OWNER has on its 
      leash. Chloe jumps back and instinctively grabs Brian s arm.

                                  BRIAN
                    Ouch!

      The claws. She immediately hides her hands in her jacket.

                                  BRIAN (CONT D)
                    Damn. You ve got some nails.
                          (to dog owner)
                    Dude, do something about your dog.

                                  DOG OWNER
                    She s never like this.

      The owner finally pulls the dog away. Chloe is freaked.

                                  BRIAN
                    That was kinda random.

                                  CHLOE
                    Yeah. Hey - I should probably go. 
                    My mom has this thing about me 
                    coming home. Thanks for the coffee.

                                  BRIAN
                    Chloe, wait. Can we do this again?

                                  CHLOE
                    I d really like that. Bye.

      And she s gone.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               33.              


      EXT. COIT TOWER PARK - CONTINUOUS

      Chloe, lost in thought, walks along the path but catches a 
      glimpse of a man in a long, black leather coat standing in 
      the trees. She stops and looks back. He s gone.

      Now fully alert, she hurries on but notices through the trees 
        a HOODED-FIGURE keeping pace with her on the path above that 
      she s about to intersect. She changes directions and heads 
      down a different path. And then she hears...

                                  MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    She s heading up. Cut her off.

      Chloe immediately jumps the railing and disappears.

      CHLOE s POV as she runs through the thick brush, ducking and 
      weaving. It s twilight; the long shadows make it hard to see. 

      Snap. She looks back. There s a flash of black moving through 
      the trees. She s being chased.

      She jumps another railing and lands on a steep path, 
      startling a few PEDESTRIANS. She turns right but there s 
      another HOODED FIGURE at the bottom of the stairs. She turns 
      the other way and starts sprinting up the hill.

      At the top is COIT TOWER. She ducks into a vestibule.

      She catches a glimpse of a hooded figure racing past. Chloe 
      immediately doubles back and heads into the building.


      INT. COIT TOWER - CONTINUOUS

      Chloe sprints up the winding stairs.


      EXT. COIT TOWER/ROOF - CONTINUOUS

      She has a BIRD S EYE view of the park two hundred feet below. 
      The two hooded-figures jog past, obviously still looking for 
      our girl. One of them glances up and Chloe immediately pulls 
      back in, holding her breath.

      They didn t see her and start to move away. For the moment 
      she s safe. Chloe lets out a SIGH of relief. She turns away 
      from the railing but stops short because...

      The terrifying-looking MAN with three scars down the side of 
      his face is standing directly in front of her. 

                                  MAN
                    Good-bye, Chloe.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               34.              


      She doesn t even have time to scream before he violently 
      shoves her backwards.

      Chloe flips back over the railing, desperately grasping at 
      nothing. The man is already gone. She catches a glimpse of 
      the ground below as she plummets downward.


      EXT. COIT TOWER - CONTINUOUS

      SMACK! Chloe slams against the pavement. A WOMAN SCREAMS. 

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)
                    She s dead.

      CONTINUALLY TIGHTEN ON CHLOE s lifeless face as BLOOD starts 
      to ooze out from under her head.

      Suddenly... Chloe s EYES POP OPEN.


      INT./EXT. COIT TOWER - CONTINUOUS

      Our scarred assassin is flying down the stairs. Under his 
      coat he has a knife ready to unsheathe.

      He bangs out the front doors, but stops dead in his tracks. 
      There s a pool of blood on the ground, but Chloe s not there.


      EXT. COIT TOWER PARK - SAME TIME

      Chloe is running as fast as she can down the path away from 
      the tower. She looks back to make sure she s not being 
      followed and...

      BAM! She s tackled by one of the hooded-figures. They tumble 
      across the ground.

      Chloe has her CLAWS out at the assailant s throat.

                                  MALE VOICE
                    Chloe, no!

      The second assailant pulls off his hood.  It s Alek.

                                  ALEK
                    We re here to help.

      She looks up and realizes that the person on top of her is 
      Jasmine. And they both have claws, too.

                                        ACT FOUR


      EXT. STREET/ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

      Jasmine and Alek each have Chloe by an arm and are hustling 
      her along, constantly looking over their shoulders to make 
      sure that they re not being followed.

                                    JASMINE
                    We were only supposed to be 
                    watching you.  You know, just to 
                    make sure that Alek was right.

                                  ALEK
                    I was right. I told them you d 
                    started to transform.

                                    JASMINE
                    But then we saw one of the Order s 
                      assassin s lurking around and knew 
                    we had to do something.

                                  ALEK
                    In here.

      He pulls them into an alley.  Alek deftly LEAPS ten feet up 
      onto a fire escape and scans the street behind them.

                                  ALEK (CONT D)
                    I think we re good. We re not being 
                    followed.

                                  CHLOE
                    Would one of you please tell me 
                    what is going on?

      He drops back down to the ground.

                                  ALEK
                    We should keep moving.

      And they start down the alley and out onto another street.

                                    JASMINE
                    Chloe, I m so sorry. There are 
                    usually people who talk you through 
                    this. This isn t how it s normally 
                    done.

      She stops.

                                  CHLOE
                    What s done?!  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               36.              


                                    JASMINE
                    Contact. Your transformation was so 
                    fast--

                                  ALEK
                    You were born in the Ukraine, no?

                                  CHLOE
                    Yes. But how did you...?

                                  ALEK
                          (re: store front)
                    This looks good. Come on.

      He pulls her into a busy coffee house.


      INT. COFFEE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      They re in a booth at the back.  Jasmine hands Chloe a cup of 
      tea. Alek is sitting so he can watch the entrance.

                                    JASMINE
                    I know you must have a million 
                      questions.

                                  CHLOE
                    Kinda just one. What the hell are 
                    you?

                                  ALEK
                    You mean, what the hell are we? We 
                    are Mai.

                                  CHLOE
                    Mai?

                                    JASMINE
                      Descendants of an ancient and 
                    sacred race - not completely human, 
                    not completely god.

      There is a small AMULET of the Egyptian cat-goddess BASTET, 
      around Jasmine s neck.

                                  ALEK
                    We were warriors. Now we are forced 
                    to live in the shadows.

                                    JASMINE
                    He s being slightly dramatic - we 
                    lead pretty normal lives.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               37.              


                                  CHLOE
                    There are more of you? Us?

                                    JASMINE
                    Maybe a couple thousand in San 
                      Francisco. But there are other Mai 
                    prides around the world.

                                  CHLOE
                    This makes no sense.

                                  ALEK
                    You know what we say is true. Mai 
                    blood must run thick for you to 
                    transform so quickly.

                                    JASMINE
                    We didn t even know for sure you 
                    were one of us until yesterday.

      After a beat...

                                  CHLOE
                    Are there going to be more... 
                    changes?

                                  ALEK
                    No. Just a tail.

      Jasmine hits Alek.

                                    JASMINE
                    Ignore him. I know it s difficult 
                    to accept - but this is who you 
                    are.

      Chloe is trying to process. But after a beat...

                                  ALEK
                          (playful)
                    Do you regret being so mean to me 
                    now?

                                  CHLOE
                    Uh, no.

                                  ALEK
                    So who was that guy in the park? Is 
                    he your boyfriend.

                                  CHLOE
                    So not your business.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               38.              


                                    JASMINE
                    For a second I thought you were 
                    going to kiss him - I swear I 
                    almost had a heart attack.

      Chloe has no idea what they re talking about.

                                  ALEK
                    Mai and humans do not mix well.

                                    JASMINE
                    I guess you d call it a curse. We 
                    can t be...

                                  ALEK
                    Intimate.

                                    JASMINE
                    Thank you.  Even something as small 
                    as a kiss--

                    What happens if we kiss?

                                  ALEK
                    Depends on the kiss. Paralysis. 
                    Death. Sometimes paralysis and 
                    death. But don t worry - not for 
                    the Mai, just the human.

                                    JASMINE
                    Alek. I swear--
                          (to Chloe)
                    Don t let him frighten you. You 
                    didn t kiss that guy. He s fine. We 
                    were watching.

      Chloe takes out her phone and opens it.

                                  CHLOE
                    It s not him I m worried about.


      EXT. XAVIER S APARTMENT/STREET - SHORT TIME LATER

      Police cars and lights. A body is lifted into the back of the 
      CORONER S TRUCK.

      Across the street, on the other side of the barricade, Chloe 
      is watching with Jasmine and Alek. Chloe has her hand over 
      her mouth - this can t really be happening.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               39.              


                                    JASMINE
                    It s not your fault. You had no way 
                    of knowing.

                                  ALEK
                          (sincere)
                    I m sorry.

      Chloe just turns and walks way, quickly. Tears are starting 
      to stream down her cheeks.

                                    JASMINE
                          (grabbing her arm)
                    Chloe, wait!

                                  CHLOE
                    Don t touch me!

                                    JASMINE
                    Please.  Just let us take you home.

                                  CHLOE
                    I can get home on my own.

                                  ALEK
                    She means our home. You will be 
                    safe.

                                  CHLOE
                    Don t you get it. I don t want 
                    anything to do with you.

                                    JASMINE
                    I don t think you have a choice.
                          (beat)
                    At least until we figure out why 
                    the Order was after you.

                                  ALEK
                    Or how they knew about you. They 
                    normally don t do this.

                                  CHLOE
                    The Order?

                                    JASMINE
                    Humans as a species aren t really 
                    crazy about different - the Order 
                    are the ones dedicated to its 
                      extinction.

                                  ALEK
                    They ve been hunting us for 
                      centuries.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               40.              


                                  ALEK (CONT D)
                    Trust me. You will not be happy if 
                    that guy in the park catches you.

                                  CHLOE
                    Uh, yeah. Too late. I guess you 
                    missed the part where he tossed me 
                    off the top of Coit Tower.

      A look passes between Alek and Jasmine.

                                    JASMINE
                    Just now? What happened?

                                  CHLOE
                    What do you think happened? It felt 
                    like I broke every bone in my body.

                                  ALEK
                    But you are still here.

                                  CHLOE
                    Sorry to disappoint.

      Another looks passes between the cousins.

                                    JASMINE
                     Only the Uniter has nine lives to 
                    live. 

                                  ALEK
                    That would explain the sudden 
                      transformation.

                                    JASMINE
                     And nine lives to endure.  Chloe, 
                    I... We re not supposed to save 
                    you. You re supposed to save us.

                                  CHLOE
                    Not happening.

                                  ALEK
                    You have to come. Please. The Order 
                    knows. They will not stop. Many 
                    people are going to die.

                                  CHLOE
                    No. I m not going with you. This 
                    has nothing to do with me. 

      She pushes Alek away, and he goes flying. CRASH.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               41.              


                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Leave me alone.

      Chloe takes off running.


      EXT. WHITLEY S OFFICE/STREET - NIGHT

      WHITLEY REZZA, 40 s, greying but handsome, the epitome of 
      wealth and power, walks out of the building and heads 
      straight for his waiting TOWNCAR.


      INT. TOWNCAR - CONTINUOUS

      Whitley gets in  the backseat and the door is closed. REVEAL 
      that our scar-faced ASSASSIN is sitting next to him. His name 
      is THE ROGUE. Whitley doesn t seem surprised.

                                  THE ROGUE
                    You re late.

                                    WHITLEY
                    I ve been working.

                                  THE ROGUE
                    I found the girl. She s who we ve 
                    been waiting for.
                          (beat)
                    What would you like me to do now?

                                    WHITLEY
                    What do you think I d like you to 
                    do?  Kill her as many times as you 
                    have to.


      INT. CHLOE S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Meredith is watching TV when Chloe bangs through and charges 
      straight up the stairs.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Chloe, I thought we agreed--

      SLAM! Okay, then.


      INT. CHLOE S HOUSE/BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      The shower is running behind her. Chloe takes off her shirt 
      and looks at her back in the mirror.  It s completely covered 
      in black and purple BRUISES.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               42.              


                                  MEREDITH (O.S.)
                          (at the door)
                    Chloe? What s going on? Are you 
                    alright?


      BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

      Chloe is in the shower, the water runs off of her head.


      INT. CHLOE S BEDROOM - LATER

      Chloe, dressed but hair still wet, is sitting on her bed, 
      knees pulled in tight, lost in thought. 

      Suddenly, she hears a LOUD RUMBLING and something charging 
      towards her door. What the hell--

                                  AMY
                    Chloe!

      Amy bursts into her room. She looks like she s been crying.

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    You re home. I called you like a 
                    hundred bajillion times.

                                  CHLOE
                    It s okay. I m fine.  Really.

                                  AMY
                    Why wouldn t you be fine? Paul and 
                    I just broke up.

                                  CHLOE
                    Amy, I m sorry, but I just can t 
                    right now. 

                                  AMY
                    He was supposed to meet me at the 
                    Galaxy but didn t show. I bet his 
                    mom--

                                  CHLOE
                    Amy! No. I just can t deal with you 
                    right now.

                                  AMY
                    And what the hell do you have going 
                    on that s so important?

                                  CHLOE
                    How about this?!  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               43.              


      And Chloe pulls up her t-shirt, but she can see in the mirror 
      that nothing is there. The bruises are gone.

                                  AMY
                    Yeah, I get it.  You re a skinny 
                    bitch. What does that have to do 
                    with anything?

      After a beat...

                                  CHLOE
                          (completely sincere)
                    I think I died tonight.

                                  AMY
                    Oh, Chloe. Are you okay?

      She immediately puts her arm around her friend. But just then 
      Chloe s phone BUZZES.

                                  CHLOE
                    It s Paul. Should I answer?

      Amy nods.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                          (on phone)
                    Hey, Paul.

      But Paul doesn t sound so good.

                                  PAUL (O.S.)
                    Chloe? I ve got somebody here who 
                    wants to talk to you.

                                  CHLOE
                    Paul?


      INT. LOFT - NIGHT

      The Rogue takes the phone away from Paul s ear.

                                  THE ROGUE 
                    Hello, Chloe. I believe you and I 
                    have some unfinished business.  

      REVEAL that Paul is strung up behind him in the corner of an 
      abandoned loft.

      EXT. LOFT - NIGHT

      Amy jerks to a stop in front of this semi-abandoned looking 
      four-story building.


      INT. AMY S CAR - CONTINUOUS

      Chloe zips up her leather jacket.

                                  CHLOE
                    You should probably keep the motor 
                    running.

                                  AMY
                    Chloe--

                                  CHLOE
                    It ll be okay. I m just really 
                    sorry for getting you mixed up in 
                    all this, but I ll make it right.

      Amy leans across and locks Chloe s door.

                                  AMY
                    There is no way I m letting you out 
                    of this car without you telling me 
                    what s going on.

                                  CHLOE
                    Remember when you warned me about 
                    bad guys?  I should have listened.
                          (beat)
                    If Paul and I aren t out of there 
                    in two minutes, call the police.

                                  AMY
                    You can t go in there alone. I 
                    don t mean I want to go with you - 
                    but you can t go in there alone.

                                  CHLOE
                    Trust me.  I ll be fine.

      And for the first time, Chloe flashes her CLAWS. SHLOOSH.

                                  AMY
                    Aaa--

      Amy stifles a YELP, covering her mouth with both hands.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               45.              


                                  CHLOE
                    Wish me luck.

      All Amy can do is nod.  Chloe gets out and runs toward the 
      building. Two seconds later - Amy s car dies.


      INT. LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

      Paul is tied up, arms over his head, in a corner of this 
      large, unfinished loft space obviously undergoing renovation. 
      The Rogue is nowhere to be seen.

                                  PAUL
                    Uh, hello? I don t suppose you d 
                    consider tying my hands behind my 
                    back instead - I don t really have 
                    the upper body strength for this.

      CLANK. The ELEVATOR DOOR opens and Chloe steps out. She can t 
      see anyone.

                                  CHLOE
                    Paul?

                                  PAUL
                          (calling out)
                    Chloe. Get out of here. It s a 
                    trap.

                                  CHLOE
                    Yeah, kinda figured that part out 
                    on my own.

      She starts to cautiously move across the room towards Paul.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Hey, Creepy-creep. You know who you 
                    are. I m just going to take my 
                    friend and go and I swear you ll

                    what s up with you and the Mai, but 
                    it really has nothing to do with me 
                    so--

      But Chloe hears the faintest SOUND behind her and quickly 
      steps back.

      WHOOSH! A ten-point NINJA STAR whizzes past and is imbedded 
      in the wall behind her. That was close.

      But another one SLICES her in the leg and she goes down.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               46.              


                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Aaah.

      The Rogue steps into view and pulls out a gleaming curved 
      knife. It s both ancient and deadly.

                                  THE ROGUE
                    I know you don t think this has 
                    anything to do with you, but you re 
                    wrong. It has everything to do with 
                    you.

                                  CHLOE
                    Who the hell are you?

                                  THE ROGUE
                    Your executioner. I ll try to be 
                    quick but with eight lives still to 
                    go - this could take a while.

      He advances towards. Chloe pulls herself up. She now looks 
      more pissed than frightened.

                                  CHLOE
                    News flash. Dying sucks. And I m so 
                    not doing that again.

      Suddenly, she LEAPS up at him - claws out. He wasn t 
      expecting this. He goes down and she tumbles over him.

      They re both instantly back up. He advances on Chloe, 
      swinging his knife as she tries to retreat, ducking under the 
        scaffolding.

      He lunges and Chloe rolls out of the way just in time, 
      slashing him in the leg.

                                  CHLOE (CONT D)
                    Now we re even. Oh, wait, I still 
                    need to throw you off of a 
                    building.

      But completely enraged, he launches another attack. Chloe 
      barely steps out of the way in time.

      Paul sees Chloe with her claws for the first time.

                                  PAUL
                    Chloe?
                          (beat)
                    That is so cool.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               47.              


      INT. AMY S CAR - SAME TIME

      Amy is anxiously sitting in her car, cell phone at the ready, 
      staring at her watch.

                                  AMY
                    One minute thirty-eight seconds. 
                    One minute thirty-nine---

      THUD. SMACK. A man lands on the hood of her car. There s 
      another at her window.  Amy SCREAMS!

                                  ALEK
                    Where is she?

      It s Alek and Jasmine.

                                    JASMINE
                    Amy, please. There s no time. 
                    Where s Chloe?

                                  AMY
                    In there.  Fourth floor.

      And they re both instantly gone, running for the building.

                                  AMY (CONT D)
                    Alek and Jasmine? Wait. Don t leave 
                    me here!

      And she s out of the car hustling behind them.


      INT. LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

      CRASH! Another piece of scaffolding goes down. Chloe is still 
      holding him off.

      He thrusts. Chloe defends. She slashes but he catches her 
      wrist and she gets an elbow to the chest. She lets out a GASP 
      of pain as he flips her back on to the floor.

      Before she can get up, he s on her. Kneeling over her chest. 
      Both her arms pinned. Her claws useless. Chloe struggles.

                                  THE ROGUE
                    To kill the so-called Uniter will 
                    be the greatest accomplishment of 
                    my life.

                                  CHLOE
                    You ve got the wrong girl.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               48.              


                                  THE ROGUE
                    Perhaps you re right. So lets see 
                    how many times I can kill you 
                    before you stop coming back to 
                    life.

      He raises his knife and is about to plunge it into her heart 
      when...

      Alek leaps in and tackles the Rogue. CRASH.

      Chloe is immediately on her feet. Jasmine is there.

                                    JASMINE
                    Chloe, go.  We ll get your friend.

      But Alek comes flying back and lands at Chloe s feet. It s 
      pretty clear that neither he nor his cousin are a match for 
      the Rogue.

                                  CHLOE
                    Get Paul. I ll deal with this guy.

                                    JASMINE
                    No. You ve got to get--

                                  CHLOE
                    Now.

      Jasmine and Alek scramble as the Rogue launches another 
      attack.  Chloe grabs a steel bar to try and defend herself. 
      SLAM. SCRAP. He flies back - Chloe looks like she s finally 
      about to clobber him when--

                                  AMY (O.S.)
                    CHLOE!

      She s at the elevator. That s all the Rogue needs as he grabs 
      the pole and flips Chloe away. OOF. She slams into a pile of 
      boxes.

                                  CHLOE
                    Not now, Amy.

      Amy spots Paul who s just been untied.

                                  AMY
                    Paul.

      And rushes over to him, just as a NINJA STAR imbeds itself 
      into wood just inches from Paul s head.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               49.              


      She kisses him. But when she lets go, she looks back at the 
      battle that Alek and Jasmine have re-entered. Even with three 
      against one, the Rogue still seems to be winning.

      Paul grabs a piece of metal pipe and heads into the fray. 
      Chloe gets in a kick to the chest. The Rogue falls back 
      towards Paul.

                                  PAUL
                    Don t worry, Chloe. I got him.

      Paul hits him across the shoulders with the pipe. But it just 
      seems to infuriate him even further. With one swift move he 
      grabs Paul and throws him up against the wall. 

      ANGLE ON Amy who is now really mad. She picks up one of the 
      industrial lights.

      ANGLE BACK on Chloe and The Rogue. The Rogue sends Jasmine 
      crashing into some scaffolding. For the moment, it s just him 
      and Chloe. 

      And Chloe looks like she might finally be getting the better 
      of him but as he stumbles, he grabs a board and it smacks 
      Chloe full on.

      Chloe flies back and CRASHES out one of the arched WINDOWS.


      EXT. LOFT - CONTINUOUS

      Glass flying - Chloe lands feet first a floor below on the 
      fire escape.

                                  CHLOE
                          (re: landing)
                    Thank God that part is true.

      She looks up at the Rogue who is looking down on her.


      INT. LOFT - CONTINUOUS

      Rogue is at the edge of the broken window.

                                  AMY
                    Stay away from my friend.

      He turns back just as Amy SLAMS him in the face with the 
      light. It sparks and explodes and he tumbles backwards out 
      the window.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               50.              


      EXT. LOFT - CONTINUOUS

      The Rogue falls back barely catching onto a fire escape 
      railing before slamming onto a landing several floors below. 
      He looks up at Chloe. 

                                  CHLOE
                    Still not even.

      He knows when it s time to retreat and continues to head down 
      the fire escape. Chloe takes up the chase. Alek and Jasmine 
      leap out of the window behind her.


      EXT. LOFT/STREET - MOMENTS LATER

      Chloe runs out into the street but it s deserted. Alek and 
      Jasmine catch up. He seems to have vanished.

      But as she turns away, we see him step out of the shadows and 
      hurl a knife straight at CHLOE.

      The knife tumbles through the air. But just as it s about to 
      hit...

                                    JASMINE
                    Chloe.

      Jasmine pushes her out of the way. The knife hits her in the 
      shoulder blade. 

                                  ALEK
                    Jasmine!

      Chloe looks up and the Rogue is already gone.

                                    JASMINE
                    I was supposed to watch you.

      And she passes out in Alek s arms just as Amy and Paul come 
      running up.

                                  AMY
                    Ohmigod, I ll call 911.

                                  ALEK
                    No! I ll take her home. We can heal 
                    her. I hope.
                          (to Chloe)
                    But the rest of us only have this 
                    one life.

                                  CHLOE
                    I m sorry.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               51.              


                                  ALEK
                    You can t run away.

                                  CHLOE
                    I know.

      And Alek lifts his cousin in his arms and hurries away, 
      leaving Chloe standing alone in the street with Amy and Paul.


      INT. BRIAN S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Brian comes in the front door of this very impressive house 
      and starts up the stairs, but stops when he sees a light on 
      in the front room.

                                  BRIAN
                    Hey, Dad. I didn t think you d 
                    still be up.

                    Yeah, actually it was a very good 
                    day.  Night.

      MUSIC UP:


      INT. JASMINE S ROOM - NIGHT

      Jasmine is bandaged up and sleeping. Alek watches from the

      Amy and Paul are parked in Amy s car under a streetlight, 
      making out.

      INT. CHLOE S HOUSE/ UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

      Meredith stops at Chloe s door. She decides not to knock.  "NINE LIVES"                  8-26-10 DRAFT               52.              


      INT. MEREDITH S ROOM - NIGHT

      Meredith is on the floor in front of her closet. She reaches 
      all the way to the back and pulls out a dusty, old SHOE BOX. 
      After a beat, she opens it. Inside are documents and letters. 
      All of them are written in RUSSIAN.


      INT. BRIAN S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Brian dials his cell and heads up the stairs. No answer. 
      Finally, he hangs up.


      INT. CHLOE S ROOM

      CLOSE ON Chloe s cell and it s  MISSED CALL  message. PULL 
      BACK TO REVEAL that Chloe is staring at her laptop screen.

      On it is a message.  It simply says,  TRUST NO ONE. Dad. 


      EXT. CHLOE S HOUSE - SAME TIME

      PULL UP and away from the house REVEALING the SKYLINE and a 
      LONE HOODED-FIGURE crouching on a neighboring roof watching

                                                                          FADE OUT.
