Establishing shot of a renovated apartment building built in the nineteen twenties. A moving truck
pulls into a gated side garage.
Steven walks from his apartment to the customized van. On the side of the white van it says, "The
Cable Company - Get Wired Today."
STEVEN
How's it going?
CABLE GUY
Howdy partner. Climb aboard.
Steven gets in.
Birds eye P.O.V., shot follows the Cable Guy's van as it drives through the city.
CABLE GUY
It all started in Lansford,
Pennsylvania where Panther Valley
Television, with the assistance of Jerrod
Electronics, created the first cable
television system.
The van drives up into the hills, finally revealing a huge satellite dish on top of a small mountain,
overlooking the entire city.
CABLE GUY
I went to Lansford once. It's the Cable
Guy's Mecca. It was very emotional.
Steven and the Cable Guy get out of the van, and walk down a trail.
CABLE GUY
I come here to think sometimes. To clear
my head.
They turn a corner and the satellite dish is right in front of them. It is enormous. Next to it is a
one-hundred and fifty foot antenna. Next to that is a small fenced-in shack where the satellite's
controls are located.
CABLE GUY
There she is. Right now she's sending
entertainment and information to millions
of satisfied citizens.
STEVEN
That's pretty impressive.
CABLE GUY
See, I knew the moment I met you that
you would appreciate this.
The Cable Guy runs to the dish. A few seconds later he appears inside of it.
CABLE GUY
(with wonder)
The future is now. Soon every American
home will integrate their television,
phone, and computer. You'll be able to
visit the Louvre on one channel, and
watch female mud wrestling on
another. You can do your shopping at
home, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend
in Vietnam. There's no end to the
possibilities.
(waves to Steven)
Come on up! What are you waiting for?!
The van pulls up in front of Steven's apartment building.
CABLE GUY
You know what? Women are suckers for
"Sleepless in Seattle." It's on HBO this
month. That's your bait right there.
STEVEN
Robin loves that movie.
CABLE GUY
They all do. Next time you talk to her
tell her you're cooking yourself dinner,
and watching it by yourself. Sound like
you're happier than a pig in shit.
She'll come running. Betcha. Then just
play it cool.
STEVEN
Maybe I will.
Steven gets out of the car.
STEVEN
Thanks a lot. I'm embarrassed to say
this, but I don't know your name. What
is it?
CABLE GUY
(touched)
You really want to know my name? You do?
Really? It's Ernie Douglas. But my
friends call me Chip.
STEVEN
I'll see ya' Chip.
Before he can exit the van, the Cable Guy is staring him in the eyes.
CABLE GUY
Let's just remember right now. You know
some people walk through their entire
lives and never find a true friend.
(long pause)
I guess we're the lucky ones.
(End Revised - Pink)
STEVEN'S P.O.V. - The Cable Guy is in slow motion. He blinks once.
STEVEN
Uh
good-bye.
CABLE GUY
Later buddy. I'll catch ya' on the
flip side.
Steven exits the van feeling a little uncomfortable.
Steven and Robin are talking. Robin does not look happy to see him.
STEVEN
I don't listen to you. I pretend to
understand but I'm really just saying
what I think you want to hear. So from
now on I'm going to try my best to listen
more because I do love you and am
interested in learning about every detail
about the complicated splendor that is
you.
Robin looks at him, somewhat shocked.
ROBIN
Oh.
STEVEN
I want us to get back together, but I can
see why taking this time might be good
for us. So, I'm not mad.
After a long beat, Robin smiles.
ROBIN
Sometimes time apart is healthy.
STEVEN
You're right. Well, that's what I came
here to say. Look, I've got to get back
to the office.
He starts getting up.
ROBIN
So, are you doing anything tomorrow?
STEVEN
I'm just going to cook myself dinner and
watch a movie. "Sleepless in Seattle" is
on cable.
ROBIN
Really?
STEVEN
If you're around you should drop by and
check out the new apartment.
ROBIN
Okay, maybe I will.
He exits the room. As he does we see a television broadcasting the Sweet case.
ON MTV - Sam Sweet sits behind the defendant's table. TABITHA SOREN is giving the news
update.
TABITHA SOREN
Today in the Sam Sweet case the
prosecution played the 911 call that Sam
Sweet made the night he murdered his
brother. Keep in mind, he confessed one
month later.
The courtroom listens to a 911 phone call. The transcription is seen on the screen.
SAM SWEET V ON THE TAPE
(crying and babbling)
Hello, please send help. My twin brother
has been shot.
911 OPERATOR
Slow down sir. What happened?
SAM SWEET
Oh my god, they shot him with a shot gun
four times. I mean I think it was a
shotgun. Who would do such a thing?! I
think it was an Asian gang or something.
They were speaking some other language.
Sam leans over and whispers something in his lawyer's ear.
TABITHA SOREN
Hmm. Who indeed? Coming up next, a rare
interview with Michael Jackson's zoo-
keeper.
Steven runs in with a small bag of groceries. He is dressed for a date. He pulls out a bottle of
wine. He opens the oven, and checks on dinner. It is almost ready. Then he checks his message
machine as he prepares the meal. He begins chopping an onion.
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
MESSAGE VOICE
You have eleven messages.
STEVEN'S MOTHER
(ON THE MACHINE)
Steven, it's mom. Give me a call. I'm
still your mother.
STEVEN'S FATHER
(ON THE MACHINE)
I'm getting on. Steven call your mother.
CABLE GUY
(ON THE MACHINE)
Hey Steven. Just checking in. Give me a
ring. I'm at 555-4329.
(beep)
What's up Steven? I'm at a pay phone. If
you're there pick up. Pick up. Pick up.
Okay, I'll be home later. I'll talk to
you then.
Steven stops chopping.
CABLE GUY
(ON THE MACHINE)
(beep)
Okay I'm home now. Give me a buzz when
you get in. I'll be here pretty much all
night. Bye.
(beep tone)
Hey Steven. Quick question, give me a
call when you get a chance.
(beep tone)
I was just taking a whiz, thought you
might have called. Okay later.
(beep tone)
Sorry, I had call waiting, didn't get to
it, thought it might have been you. All
right, bye.
Steven is beginning to get a little wigged out by this. He fast forwards through a sampling of the
rest of the calls.
CABLE GUY
(fast forwards)
We're having ourselves quite a little
game of phone tag here. You're it!
(fast forwards)
I was just blow drying my hair and I
thought I heard the phone ringing.
(fast forwards)
you're a tough man to reach.
(fast forwards)
I guess you're too busy to call your
friends.
(Revision Ends - Blue)
Steven fast forwards the machine. All he hears is sighing. Then 
CABLE GUY
(ON THE MACHINE)
(long beat - then quiet and distant)
Shit.
The doorbell rings. Steven takes a deep breath then opens the door. It is Robin. She is dressed
casually, but looks beautiful.
STEVEN
Hey, good to see you.
There is an awkward moment where Steven intentionally doesn't kiss her hello.
STEVEN
Come on in. What do you think of the
place?
She looks at the odd placement of furniture.
ROBIN
You made some interesting choices laying
out the room.
STEVEN
(embarrassed)
That's actually where the movers put the
furniture. I'm gonna change it, very
soon.
ROBIN
No, I like it.
The Cable Guy and Steven walk across a parking lot. Steven has his eyes closed.
CABLE GUY
Sorry about yesterday. I was in kind of
a weird mood. How'd things go with you?
Keep 'em closed.
STEVEN
Pretty well. We'll see. Look, about the
other night. I didn't appreciate you --
CABLE GUY
Don't peek. I want this to be a
surprise.
STEVEN
I really don't need to be surprised.
Where are we going?
CABLE GUY
Only the best restaurant in town.
They walk around a corner.
CABLE GUY
Okay, here we are. Open sesame.
Steven opens his eyes.
The camera moves behind then and reveals an enormous faux castle with a big sign on it which
says "MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT."
STEVEN
Medieval Times?
CABLE GUY
I know what you're thinking. Don't
worry, I'm buying.
Steven dials the phone. On his computer screen a graphic reads "HELLO STEVEN - HAVE A
WONDERFUL DAY."
STEVEN
(into the phone)
Robin, it's Steven again. I'm still
trying to reach you. Okay, I'm at work.
Call me.
He hangs up. He is getting frustrated. The door opens. Hal Daniels sticks his head in, but does not
enter.
MR. DANIELS
How's it going?
STEVEN
Good.
MR. DANIELS
(long beat)
Good good?
STEVEN
Great.
MR. DANIELS
Good. Keep it up.
He leaves. The phone rings.
SECRETARY
(through the intercom)
Robin on line two.
Steven lights up. He takes a deep breath, then answers the phone.
STEVEN
Hey, I had the best time the other night.
When am I going to get you on my couch
again?
Steven walks into the living room looking a little disheveled. The Cable Guy is cooking him
breakfast.
CABLE GUY
Good morning sleepy head. I hope you
don't mind, I crashed on the couch.
Bacon and eggs coming up.
STEVEN
Where did Heather go?
CABLE GUY
I heard her slip out early this morning.
STEVEN
What a night. That was just what I
needed.
(Revision Ends - Blue)
CABLE GUY
You look like a new man.
STEVEN
I feel like a new man. I was getting so
used to being rejected. I really liked
her.
CABLE GUY
Hey, it was my treat.
STEVEN
(taken aback)
What do you mean it was "your treat?"
CABLE GUY
You know, I bought this time, you buy
next time.
STEVEN
(getting concerned)
Buy what?
CABLE GUY
You know, the women.
STEVEN
You mean Heather is a prostitute?
CABLE GUY
Of course she is. Do you think a woman
like that would hang out with us if we
weren't paying? Don't tell me you didn't
know.
STEVEN
I can't believe this.
He sits in a chair, and leans over in pain.
CABLE GUY
She's clean I assure you. I tried her out
last week to make sure she was top
quality, and I'm as healthy as a horse. Not
a drip. She's the best, ask any of my
friends.
Steven cringes.
STEVE
You've got to be kidding? Please tell me
she's a friend of yours. You're just
playing with my mind again, right?
CABLE GUY
I wish I had friends like that.
STEVEN
Get out of my house!
CABLE GUY
Don't be ashamed of yourself. I know she
was a working girl, but she kind of liked
you. You might have been able to
get a freebie.
STEVEN
Out, now! I don't ever want to see you
again.
(to himself)
Robin is never going to forgive me.
CABLE GUY
I'll tell you how to handle that. Don't
tell her. You want to get her back, I'll
help you get her back.
STEVEN
I don't want your help. I want you to
leave.
(gestures to the TV)
And take that stuff out of here.
CABLE GUY
(calmly)
Whatever. I can take a hint. I'll see
ya'.
The Cable Guy exits.
42	OMITTED
P.O.V. Shot - Robin and a date enter the restaurant.
We move to reveal the Cable Guy driving up in his van. He watches them from across the street. A
moment later he heads inside.
The Cable Guy walks over to a FEMALE NEIGHBOR.
CABLE GUY
Excuse me, apartment 202 is Robin Harris?
FEMALE NEIGHBOR
(points)
It's right upstairs.
There is a LOUD KNOCK. Robin walks to the door and opens it without undoing the chain.
ROBIN
Who is it?
The Cable Guy sticks his face as far into the crack of the door as possible.
CABLE GUY
It's the Cable Guy.
ROBIN
There's no problem with my cable.
CABLE GUY
I've got an upgrade order for one Robin
Harris. The Rainbow package, that's every
pay channel available.
ROBIN
I didn't order this.
CABLE GUY
Apparently you've got a secret admirer.
She unlocks the chain, and the Cable Guy quickly steps inside.
ROBIN
Was it a man named Steven?
CABLE GUY
I can't tell you.
ROBIN
Come on.
CABLE GUY
No, I promised Steven I wouldn't say.
He gave it away on purpose. They both laugh.
CABLE GUY
Whoops, I slipped. Well you didn't hear
it from me.
The Cable Guy smiles, proud of himself.
Establishing shot of the building. We hear Steven's cellular phone ring.
It is raining. Rick pulls up, and drops Steven off.
STEVEN
Can't you get someone else
to go?
(Revision Ends - Blue)
RICK
Maybe I'll take MY cable guy.
Steven gets out of the car. Rick drives off. Steven walks up the steps to his apartment. The Cable
Guy appears from behind a corner.
CABLE GUY
Pretty smooth work. I set 'em up, you
knock 'em down.
STEVEN
What?
CABLE GUY
Robin. I got her back for you. I juiced
her up.
STEVEN
How do you know we're back together?
CABLE GUY
Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac.
STEVEN
I don't want you messing around with my
life. You've caused enough trouble as it
is.
CABLE GUY
I know. I felt bad about the other night,
so I wanted to make it up to you. So
what are you doing? Do you want to catch
a bite?
Steve looks the Cable Guy in the eye.
STEVEN
(sincerely yet curt)
Look, I appreciate you helping me out
with Robin. But you have to understand,
I'm going to have to work extra hard to
not screw this relationship up again.
You're a great guy, but I just don't have
any room in my life for a new friend. Do
you understand?
CABLE GUY
I appreciate your honesty. You're a real
straight shooter.
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
STEVEN
So, you're okay?
CABLE GUY
Hey, I'm a big boy. It's no big deal.
Whatever.
STEVEN
All right
well, take care.
CABLE GUY
Have a good one.
The Cable Guy walks away. Steven stands there feeling a little guilty about what he just did.
MUSIC UP.
The Cable Guy and Robin are speaking on the phone. As the conversation continues we slowly
pull back and reveal that the Cable Guy is standing on the top of a telephone pole, dressed as a
phone company employee. He speaks into a repairman's phone which is illegally hooked into the
telephone pole.
CABLE GUY
Hey, it's Chip Douglas.
ROBIN
Chip Douglas?
CABLE GUY
Your cable guy.
(Revision Ends - Blue)
ROBIN
(surprised to hear from him)
Oh, hi. What's up?
CABLE GUY
I feel kind of weird calling you. It's
just
I'm worried about Steven.
ROBIN
What is it?
CABLE GUY
Something isn't right. He hasn't been
himself lately. Have you noticed
anything?
ROBIN
No, things are actually going really
well.
CABLE GUY
Good.
ROBIN
Should I be worried?
CABLE GUY
Nope. I'm probably just being a nervous
nellie. Let's just keep our eyes open.
ROBIN
(nervous)
I will. Good-bye.
She hangs up, then dials Steven's number.
ROBIN
Steven Bartowsky please.
Steven is walked to a police car, and put inside.
We slowly reveal a man across the street at an auto shop. He is looking under the hood of his car.
Apparently it has broken down. The man turns and we see that it is the Cable Guy covertly
watching Steven's humiliation. As the policeman pushes Steven into the car he looks at the Cable
guy and touches his nose. The Cable Guy touches his nose.
The Cable Guy is sitting at a table wearing a Walkman. People look at him funny as he speaks out
loud to his lisp tape.
(Revision 11/13/95 - Blue)
CABLE GUY
(over-pronouncing)
Sea shells. Sea shells. Salmon. Salmon.
Silverware. Silverware. Suspicious.
Suspicious. Sensational. Sensational.
Robin is brought over to the table by a hostess. The Cable Guy takes off his Walkman, and stands
up to be polite. He sits down in perfect synch with her.
ROBIN
Hello.
CABLE GUY
Hello. I'm sorry we have to meet under
these circumstances.
ROBIN
Me too. Believe me.
CABLE GUY
I know we don't know each other very
well, but we do have one thing in common,
our concern for Steven.
ROBIN
Well, you were right. Something's
happening with him and he won't even
acknowledge it.
CABLE GUY
If he refuses to admit he has a problem,
we may have to let him hit bottom. He's
gonna need some tough love.
ROBIN
(tentatively)
You know his lawyer said that nobody
named Ernie Douglas works for the Cable
Company.
CABLE GUY
(chuckles)
Did he do a name search? 'Cause I work
under a pseudonym so the customers won't
harass me at home. Kind of like a
stripper. My real name is Larry, Larry
Tate.
ROBIN
And he's saying he received all the
stereo equipment from you.
CABLE GUY
(I know, and I'm not mad. He's been
cornered, so he's telling some wives
tales. He doesn't mean to hurt me.
ROBIN
I just feel like I triggered this with
him. It's not that I don't want to get
married, it's just I felt like he wanted
to get married just to get married. I
don't deal well with pressure.
CABLE GUY
Hey, welcome to the human race. We're
not perfect. We all think we have to
look like a 'Baywatch' babe and be as
witty as 'Seinfeld.' Give yourself a
break.
ROBIN
God I could go for turkey and mashed
potatoes now.
CABLE GUY
Comfort food. Bring it on.
ROBIN
Exactly.
She laughs.
CABLE GUY
You've got a great laugh. Can I make a
small request? I'd like to hear it a little
more often.
She blushes.
ON THE TV - Hard Copy's BARRY NOLAN, sits behind his desk giving a news update.
BARRY NOLAN
The Sam Sweet trial has been thrown into
chaos as a result of a videotape made a
month after the killing. In this "Hard
Copy" exclusive an apparently intoxicated
Sam Sweet puts on a macabre show for his
friends at a party. The judge has not
decided whether this tape is admissible
as evidence.
We see a videotape of Sam Sweet at a party. The date and time are seen in the corner. Sam stands
next to the corner of a wall which is completely covered with a mirror. Sam gestures with a beer
bottle as he looks at his reflection in the mirror.
SAM SWEET
(to camera)
Hey everyone. Look it's me and
(gestures to his reflection)
my brother Stan.
(waves at reflection)
Hi Stan. It's so nice to see you. How
are you feeling?
(to camera)
Look, he's alive.
Sam punches the mirror, shattering it.
SAM SWEET
(angry)
Now he's dead.
Realizing he's revealed too much, he forces a smile.
SAM SWEET
What? I'm just goofing around.
We pull back and reveal a group of police officers watching this on television.
We pan over to Steven's father EARL paying bail.
STEVEN
I'm sorry dad.
EARL
I don't want to hear it. Do you know the
pain you out your mother through? You're
lucky she didn't die of a heart attack.
STEVEN
I didn't do anything.
EARL
Just like you said you didn't steal that
'X-Men' comic book when you were eight.
Then I found it in your underwear drawer.
STEVEN
Will you ever stop mentioning that?
EARL
This cost me a lot of money. You jump
bail, and I swear I'll hire a bounty
hunter to hunt you down.
Steven and Robin are walking up the stairs to the front door. They are dressed up for his parents'
anniversary party.
(Revision Ends - Blue)
ROBIN
Are you sure you're okay?
STEVEN
I'm fine.
ROBIN
You're not fine. When you say you're
fine, I know you're not fine.
STEVEN
I just want to get this over with so I
can go home and get some rest.
ROBIN
I wanted you to know I invited your
friend. He was concerned about you.
STEVEN
Great. I feel. Bad. I've been kind of
blowing Rick off lately.
He rings the doorbell.
ROBIN
Not Rick.
The door opens. Standing there, dressed to kill, is the Cable Guy.
CABLE GUY
You can only come in if you came to rage.
Steven is shocked. Robin walks in. When Steven walks in, the Cable Guy stops him.
CABLE GUY
(to Robin)
Is this guy cool?
(to Steven)
I'm just joshing. Come on in.
They walk inside.
Robin is venting her anger at Steven as they walk to the car.
ROBIN
I just think you were completely out of
line. I don't know what's happening to
you these days.
Steven gets fed up.
STEVEN
Robin, this guy is a sociopath. He
leaves messages on my machine night and
day. He shows up wherever I go. He
won't leave me alone.
ROBIN
Sounds familiar.
STEVEN
You know he was the one who beat up your
date at that restaurant. That's right.
And he gave you the free cable. It wasn't
me.
ROBIN
But you took the credit for it?
STEVEN
That's what he wanted. He was
manipulating me. It feels so good to be
honest about this. We're finally
communicating. I've been wanting to tell
you for so long, but he's been
blackmailing me.
ROBIN
Blackmailing you? How?
STEVEN
With a photograph.
ROBIN
Of what?
STEVEN
Me with a... prostitute.
ROBIN
What?!
STEVEN
He set it up. He invited this woman to
my party and didn't tell me she was a
prostitute. I'm so glad we can talk
about this.
ROBIN
When did you have a party?
STEVEN
When we weren't communicating. I invited
you. You were out on a date.
ROBIN
And you were with a prostitute.
STEVEN
She seduced me. That's what they do.
They're professionals. And I didn't even
know she was a prostitute.
ROBIN
So that makes it better?
STEVEN
That's not the point. The point is this
guy has been setting me up. He's
responsible.
ROBIN
He didn't have sex with a whore. You
did.
STEVEN
Robin you don't --
ROBIN
I don't want to hear it. Breaking up was
the best thing we ever did. You have
some serious problems, and it's not my
responsibility to help you. I am only
responsible for my own happiness.
STEVEN
Where did that come from?
ROBIN
It was Jerry Springer's "final thought."
She exits.
Steven's secretary Joan is watching a news report about the Sam Sweet trial on a mini television.
On the TV - a Female Prosecutor gestures with a shotgun as she questions a policeman.
Joan changes channels. The image changes to LARRY KING interviewing ALAN
DERSHOWITZ regarding "the abuse excuse."
BACK TO SCENE
Steven walks over to Joan.
STEVEN
(to his secretary)
Did anyone notice I'm late?
JOAN
What are you talking about, you've been
here for an hour.
STEVEN
Thank you.
Steven walks to his office.
It is raining lightly outside. Steven is in his car. He pulls away quickly.
Steven's car screeches to a stop. He runs up to Robin's door and starts knocking. Her FEMALE
NEIGHBOOR opens her door.
STEVEN
Be home! Be home!
FEMALE NEIGHBOOR
Go away! I remember you. You're her
obsessive boyfriend. She said you might
come here. I'm calling the police.
She closers her door. He runs off.
Rick drives up, then walks into the building.
Steven's car pulls up. He gets out, and runs toward the hospital.
Steven runs out of the hospital. The two policemen run after him, about twenty feet behind.
Steven jumps in his car, and takes off. The police follow in their car.
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
Steven's car turns a corner, and flies down a busy boulevard. A second later the police cars follow
with sirens blaring.
The Cable Guy and Robin are at the dish. He gives her the same tour he gave Steven earlier in the
film.
CABLE GUY
...it all started in Lansford,
Pennsylvania where Panther Valley
Television, with the assistance of Jerrod
Electronics, created the first cable
television system.
The chase continues.
The Cable Guy and Robin are now standing on the edge of the dish.
CABLE GUY
The future is now. Soon every American
home will integrate their television,
phone, and computer. You'll be able to
visit the Louvre on one channel, and
watch female mud wrestling on another.
You can do your shopping at home, or play
a game of Mortal Kombat with a friend in
Vietnam.
The chase continues.
Steven slams on the gas, until he is driving one-hundred miles-per-hour. He weaves in and out of
traffic, running stop lights, and avoiding obstacles. The police cars disappear behind him. On a
dime, Steven turns left onto a residential street and shuts off his lights. A moment later all of the
police cars pass by. Steven pulls out and heads the other way.
ROBIN
This is really fascinating, but I really
think we ought to go now.
CABLE GUY
I knew you'd appreciate it. I took
Steven here once, and he didn't give a
rats ass about my interests.
ROBIN
I'm worried about Steven.
CABLE GUY
Maybe Steven should be worried about you.
(beat)
So, where was I?
118	OMITTED (NOW PART OF SCENE 109AB)
119	OMITTED
120	OMITTED
121	OMITTED
Steven drives his car up the muddy dirt road. It gets stuck in the mud. He gets out of the car, and
begins walking to the satellite dish which is surrounded by a chain link fence. He hears the sounds
of horse hooves coming closer, and closer. The
he sees a headless man on a horse ride straight
toward the fence. The horse has the coat of arms from Medieval Times. When he reaches it he
smashes off the chain with a sword, then rides through. The horse rears back on its hind legs.
The horse runs full speed directly at Steven. At the last possible moment the horse jumps over
Steven. When the horse stops, the Cable Guy pops his head through the top of his coat.
CABLE GUY
(chuckles)
Ichabod Crane! The Disney Channel showed
it all last month.
The Cable Guy rides toward him again.
CABLE GUY
(like the Vegas announcer)
Let's get ready to ruuuuuummmmbbble!!!!
(Revision Ends - Blue)
This time when he gets near Steven, he leaps off the horse, onto him. They both slam into a puddle
of mud. The Cable Guy punches him in the stomach, and then the face.
STEVEN
Where's Robin?!
CABLE GUY
This isn't about Robin, this is about you
and me.
Steven charges directly at the Cable Guy.
STEVEN
Where's Robin?!!!
Steven tackles him to the ground, and begins hitting him. They are both covered in mud like
warriors from the rain forest. Steven grabs a large rock and holds it over his head.
STEVEN
Tell me!
CABLE GUY
(nonchalantly)
I'm sorry, I didn't catch the question?
Steven brings down the rock. At the last moment the Cable Guy moves his head. The rock slams
into the ground.
CABLE GUY
Steven you've changed.
(beat - then impressed)
I like it.
The Cable Guy convulses his body, pushing Steven off him.
They wrestle on the ground. The Cable Guy gets on top of Steven, then pulls a power drill out of
his belt and turns it on.
CABLE GUY
I think it's time to make you cable ready.
He slowly brings the drill down to Steven. Steven blindly reaches behind him. He grasps a large
branch and bats the Cable Guy off him.
The Cable Guy grabs a large tree brance and runs towards Steven. They begin fighting in a fashion
which mirrors their Medieval Times swordfight.
CABLE GUY
Last time we fought I let you win! Best
two out of three!
MUSIC UP: Ominous version of the 'Star Trek' battle music.
CABLE GUY
(crazed)
You treat me like the TV! You use me, but
you can't live without me!
The Cable Guy smashes Steven in the knee with his branch.
CABLE GUY
You can't shut me off with your remote
control!!!! I'm not like Robin and Rick
and Mommy and Daddy and brother and
sister and cousin --
Steven smashes him in the head with the branch.
STEVEN
I got the point.
The Cable Guy goes down. He appears to be unconscious.
ROBIN
(in the distance)
Steven.
He looks to the dish, but cannot see her.
Steven climbs over the edge into the dish. Below him he sees that the bottom of the dish is filled
with several feet of rain water.
Three wires go from the points on the edge of the dish, and meet at a point at the center of the
satellite, thirty feet above the floor of the dish. ROBIN is hanging by her bound hands from the
center of where those wires meet.
Steven climbs down towrd the bottom of the dish.
ROBIN
Help me Steven!
In the background we see the blurry image of the Cable Guy climbing through an entry hatch at
the top of the dish. Robin's eyes fill with terror.
ROBIN
Steven! Look out!
CABLE GUY
(mimics her)
Yeah Steven. Look out!
The Cable Guy leaps out of the hatch like a jack-in-the-box. He slides down the dish, knocking
Steven down. The two tumble down the slope of the dish, and tumble all the way down into the
water.
CABLE GUY
(sweetly, like a girl)
I've missed you.
The Cable Guy immediately punches Steven, sending him back into the water. The Cable Guy
dives on top of him. A moment later the Cable Guy pulls Steven up, then grabs his collar and
speaks right into his face.
CABLE GUY
(dramatically)
"Dry land is not a myth, I've seen it."
Kevin Costner from Waterworld. I don't
know what the fuss was about, the movie
ruled, I saw it six times.
He pulls Steven under the water, and tries to hold him there. He pulls him up after a few moments.
CABLE GUY
Isn't it weird that we'vve wound up in
this position?
He pushes him under the water again. After a moment he pulls him back up. Steven gasps for air.
CABLE GUY
Who would have thunk it?
Enraged, Steven punches him in the mouth with such tremendous force that it appears to have
knocked his jaw out of alignment.
CABLE GUY
(without any lisp)
You're gonna have to do better than that
Steven.
(realizing his lisp is gone)
Steven. Hey, my lisp is gone.
Steven hits him again, this time on the other side of the face.
CABLE GUY
(lisping again)
You stupid son of a bitch.
The Cable Guy falls unconscious.
ROBIN
Steven!
Steven runs to her.
He runs to the side of the dish. He realizes he must climb up to release her. He climbs onto the
WIRE and begins tightrope walking toward her. He walks very slowly, almost losing his balance
several times.
STEVEN
Hang on.
CLOSE ON: The opposite wire. The Cable Guy's muddy hands slam onto it. He pulls himself up.
CABLE GUY
(laughs maniacally)
I know what your saying. Who does this
guy think he is, Jason?
STEVEN
Stay away from her!
Suddenly, the Cable Guy does a front flip, and lands perfectly on the wire.
CABLE GUY
I saw that in Trapeze, starring Tony
Curtis. He was just on "Life-styles of
the Rich and Famous." He still looks
terrific.
Steven is about ten feet from the dangling Robin, but the reverberation from the Cable Guy's
landing makes Steven lose his balance. He falls over, but catches ont the wire. He is left hanging
there.
The Cable Guy sees this, and begins to run incredibly fast toward Robin.
CABLE GUY
And the race is on.
He does a cartwheel on the strut, hops on one leg, then takes off toward her, running at full speed.
Steven, left with no other option, simply bounces up and down on the wire. Robin sees this and
joins him.
The Cable Guy begins to lose his balance.
CABLE GUY
(knows he's about to fall)
This is such an anti-climactic way to end
this.
The Cable Guy loses his balance and falls to the water below. The Cable Guy has surely met his
demise.
Steven and Robin are sitting in the dish, a few feet from where the water begins. They are
exhausted from their ordeal. They hold each other close.
ROBIN
I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I love
you.
STEVEN
I love you too. You're right. We
shouldn't get married. I've got a lot of
problems to work out which have
absolutely nothing to do with you.
ROBIN
We'll work them out together.
They kiss. Suddenly the Cable Guy pops up from underwater. He looks frightening. Then he starts
coughing uncontrollably. He looks like a small boy who has swallowed too much water.
CABLE GUY
(between coughs)
What just happened? Where am I?
(remembers)
Oh yeah, I was trying to kill you.
He leaps at Steven, and puts him in a head-lock. He squeezes until Steven passes out. The he lays
him on the ground.
CABLE GUY
(to Robin)
It's a sleeper hold. Hulk Hogan used it
on Sly Stallone in "Rocky Three." He
should wake up in thirty seconds, so
let's get going.
He holds her around the neck, and puts a staple gun to her head, then walks her out of the dish.
Steven slowly wakes up. He looks and sees the Cable Guy and Robin beginning to climb up the
rdio antenna. He quickly gets up to follow them.
The Cable Guy and Robin climb the antenna. Steven follows them up from a distance.
The Cable Guy and Robin reach a platform at the top of the antenna. The Cable Guy holds Robin
with one hand, and holds a staple gun to her temple with the other hand. Steven climbs onto the
platform.
STEVEN
Easy.
He walks with Robin to the edge of the platform. There is a one-hundred foot drop to the dish
below. A police helicopter hovers in the air around them.
CABLE GUY
It didn't have to be this way Steven. I'm
just trying to show you the kind of
things that can happen when you mistreat
people.
STEVEN
Don't do anything stupid.
CABLE GUY
You know this is just like that secen in
that Clint Eastwood movie "Dirty Harry" --
STEVEN
(snaps)
No! This is not like anything! This is
not a movie! We're real people! You're
hurting us! This is reality!
The Cable Guy's eyes turn sad. This hits the Cable Guy like a sucker punch. Dazed, he lets go of
Robin. She runs to Steven's arms.
From below we hear the sound of sirens. A pack of police cars pull up and surround the antenna.
The Cable Guy's expression changes. He begins to look like a scared little boy.
CABLE GUY
If this is reality...
(he climbs onto the guard railing)
...I am outta here.
The Cable Guy slowly falls backward off the antenna.
STEVEN
Nooo!
Steven lunges for the Cable Guy, grabbing his forearm, then grabbing the antenna with the other
hand.
STEVEN
You're not going anywhere.
The Cable Guy hangs high above the satellite dish. Steven tries to pull the Cable Guy back onto
the platform, but the Cable Guy does not want to be saved.
STEVEN
Don't do this. You just need help. We all
get lonely.
CABLE GUY
Yeah, but I get really lonely.
(beat)
I mean, look at me.
STEVEN
You're gonna be fine. Just come on up.
CABLE GUY
(a long beat)
Steven, I think I sat too close to the
television. Mommy was right.
Steven can't hold onto his forearm any longer. The Cable Guy's arm slips and Steven grabs onto
his hand at the last possible second.
CABLE GUY
It's too late for me, but there's a lot
of little Cable Boys out there who still
have a chance. Say good-bye to the baby-
sitter.
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
The Cable Guy stops holding onto Steven's hand. He begins falling toward the dish below.
LONG WIDE SHOT of the entire antenna.
The Cable Guy falls backward toward the satellite.
The Cable Guy sails through the air. As he falls he looks almost peaceful. Totally comfortable with
what he is doing.
CLOSE ON - The Cable Guy plummeting toward the dish, about to hit.
Steven and Robin gasp.
From below we see the Cable Guy's silhouette motionless on the struts of the satellite dish.
A wide panorama of the city. All of the color televisions which can be seen through the many
windows of apartments and houses turn to white noise.
The Cable Guy appears dead. The needle of the antenna sticks through his mid-section. A red light
blinks at the tip of the needle. Then, the Cable Guy's eyes open.
CABLE GUY
Damn, that hurt like a mother. What the
hell was I thinking?
(looks at the needle)
Oh man, that stings.
Steven and Robin look relieved.
CABLE GUY
A little help here!
132	OMITTED
133	OMITTED
The Cable Guy is being taken away on a stretcher toward an emergency helicopter. Steven and
Robin are covered in police blankets. Steven calls to a paramedic.
STEVEN
Is he going to be all right?
PARAMEDIC
I don't know. It's in God's hands.
The paramedics put the Cable Guy on the helicopter. The helicopter flies away.
P.O.V. SHOT - From the helicopter looking down on Steven and Robin holding each other,
getting smaller and smaller until they disappear.
The helicopter flies away.
