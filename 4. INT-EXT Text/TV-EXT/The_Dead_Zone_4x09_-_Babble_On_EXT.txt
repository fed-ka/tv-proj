          A full moon illuminates the facade, casting ominous
          shadows.  A television flickers in a first level window...



          Johnny stumbles into the bright sunlight of day, gasping
          for air... his visibility limited by the thick dust cloud
            obscuring the landscape.  He spots what appears to be a
          lifeless BODY face down a few yards way, covered in ashen
          soot; a virtual ghost.  Johnny reacts.  He spins to another
          BODY to his left... then one to his right, as a large
          ashen HAND grabs his shoulder from behind.  He SPINS around
          only to be confronted by a MAN'S FACE.  It's a horrifying
          sight, only the man's eyes are visible through a mask of
          fine gray powder.  He grabs Johnny by both shoulders as
          if trying to make him understand his problem.  Then he
          slowly OPENS HIS MOUTH -- producing the mechanical WHINE
          OF AN ELECTRIC CIRCULAR SAW...



          A small stand-alone brick building.



          White, lifeless FORMS are all around, as Johnny drifts
          through the clouded Vision...  Suddenly he sees them,
          those OBJECTS, only now he can tell what they really are... 
          a CLARINET, twisted and covered in dust, then a TROMBONE,
          an ACCORDION and a BANJO... his attention drifts...
          startled by the image of a SMALL BODY face down.  He
          reaches and TURNS the body over as we SEE it's the LITTLE
          GIRL from Jenning's office.  WHOOSH!

          Johnny tosses the doll on the floor and catches his breath.

          FADE IN:


          Jenson locks up his office.  Heading to his car, he backs
          up and drives past a...


          PARKED SUV

          As Johnny sits up in the front seat, then OPENS HIS DOOR...



            Emergency lights dance across the facade; police cruisers
          parked nearby.  We FIND Walt taking Jenson's statement...

                        I do.

          He shows him the gun permit.  Walt casts a concerned look
          across at Johnny, who sits in the back of his patrol car.

                        John isn't crazy.  If he broke
                        into your office... he must've
                        had a damn good reason.  Which

          Johnny and Walt are flanked by her adult son, MARK (40).

                        find out exactly what happened to
                        him and I thought maybe she'd be

                        It's gotten worse the last few

            disoriented, but still with eyes of compassion and love. 
          She slowly turns her head.  Regarding Johnny with odd

          him for someone else...

          catches Walt's eagle eye -- 

          A large GAS COMPANY TRUCK pulls up to the building, a
          burly CONSTRUCTION CREW hard at work around a tangle of
          flexible piping descending an open manhole.

                        came in contact with.  He thought
                        he was losing his mind.

          Johnny scans the crowd, reading faces...

                        She must be inside.

                                        WALT
                        Who?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Allison Potter.  She designed the
                          building. 
                                (off Walt's lost look)
                        It was her doll I found buried
                        under the floor.

          Walt is speechless.  He eyes Johnny with renewed concern.


          NEW ANGLE - THE MANHOLE

            a grease-smudged WORKER emerges from it's depth, addressing
          the Chief...

                                        WORKER
                        We got a big problem.  We're losing
                          pressure in the main feeder line...

          Johnny reacts.  Crossing to the gas trunk, slipping past
          the caution tape.

                                        CHIEF
                        Hey, you can't touch that
                          equipment...

                                        WALT
                        It's alright, let him go.

          Johnny kneels, running his hand over a section of pipe. 
          Nothing at first, and then a sudden WHOOSH! 



          The building breaking apart... steel work GROANING,
          stressed beyond its limits.  People scream and scatter as
          sections of the building break loose... a section of a
          concrete pillar crumbles, kicking up a voluminous cloud
          of white soot and debris.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "BABBLE ON" - ACT FOUR - 3/18/05 - PINK    53.

          Johnny's vision realized in horrifying reality; extreme
          chaos, death, and destruction... WHOOSH!  


  7878RESUME ON JOHNNY - REALITY

          Snapping out of the tragic vision, his hand on the pipe.

          Johnny reacts, bolting for the front of the building...

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's a gas leak.  It's gonna
                        blow... get everybody out!

                                        WALT
                        Where are you going?

                                        JOHNNY
                        To find Ally!

          Walt watches Johnny disappear around the corner...

                                        WALT
                        You heard the man... clear the
                        area!  Let's go!

          The deputies react... the evacuation underway...



            Emergency SIRENS in the b.g.  The crowd watches from a
          safe distance.  Walt watches helplessly, burning inside.


          THE BUILDING

          bucks, concrete pillars imploding.  It sways severely,
          then gives... the building falls...


          NEW ANGLE - ON WALT

          horrified.

                                        CHIEF
                        Did your friend make it out?

                                        WALT
                        I don't know.

          ANGLE ON THE BUILDING

          a smoking, twisted mess.  A giant white cloud of dust and
          debris slowly whiting out the world...

                                                                        FADE TO WHITE.
