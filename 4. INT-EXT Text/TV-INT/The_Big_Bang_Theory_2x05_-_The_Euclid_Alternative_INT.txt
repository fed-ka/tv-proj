                Sheldon, I was up all night using the 

                new free electron laser for my X-ray

                its questionable premise long before now.

                no sense.  (SHOWING IT TO OCTAVIA)  

                "How many car lengths should you leave

                                        SCENE M

      (Leonard, Sheldon, Wolowitz, Koothrappali, Extras)

      SHELDON ENTERS FROM HIS OFFICE.  HE'S WEARING HIS BATHROBE, 
      SLIPPERS, A SHOWER CAP AND CARRYING A TOWEL AND A DOPP KIT.  
      AS HE PASSES BY LEONARD, WOLOWITZ AND KOOTHRAPPALI:

                                    SHELDON

                Good morning, gentlemen.

      THEY AD-LIB GOOD MORNINGS AS SHELDON PASSES.

                                  KOOTHRAPPALI

                  (WATCHING HIM GO)  Is there some new 

                kind of casual Friday I don't know 

                about?

                                    LEONARD

                No, he lives here now.

                                  WOLOWITZ

                Really?  Why?

                                    LEONARD

                Well, since he won't take the bus and 

                he's too evolved to drive, he decided 

                it was easier just to sleep in his 

                office and shower in the radiation lab 

                until I'm finished with my experiment.The Big Bang Theory #205"The Catalina Alternative"39.

                (TO LEONARD)  But you finished your 

                  experiment a week ago.

                                    LEONARD

                  (SMILING)  Yep.

      FADE IN:

      (Sheldon, Maria, Lourdes)

      IT'S DARK.  MARIA AND LOURDES, TWO CLEANING WOMEN, ENTER 
      PUSHING THEIR CLEANING CART.  MARIA DISCOVERS A PLATE WITH 
      TOAST CRUSTS AT ONE OF THE TABLES.

                                  MARIA

                (SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)  Oh my god, 

                it happened again.

                                    LOURDES

                (SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)  It must be 

                rats.

                                  MARIA

                (SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)  Rats don't 

                make toast and cut off the crusts.

      THERE'S A CRASH O.S.  THEY LOOK UP.  SHELDON IS CROUCHED OVER 
      BY A VENDING MACHINE RETRIEVING A SODA.  HE'S WEARING A 
      HOODED ROBE AND IS LIT ONLY BY THE VENDING MACHINE DISPLAY.  

                                    LOURDES/MARIA

                (SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)   Oh my! /
