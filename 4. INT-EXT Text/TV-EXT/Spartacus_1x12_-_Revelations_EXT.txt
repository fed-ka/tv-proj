  FOLLOW A SWORD eclipsing the blazing sun as it ARCS down and 
  buries itself into the shoulder of a SECUTOR GLADIATOR. 
  BLOOD SPRAYS as the man GRUNTS in pain, eyes wide in terror 
  as he looks at

  CRIXUS,

  a man possessed. Crixus PULLS his sword from the Secutor's 
  shoulder and viciously attacks. BLOOD SPLATTERS like a 
  Pollock painting as the crowd CHANTS "Crixus! Crixus!"

  THE SECUTOR STUMBLES BACKWARDS

  as Crixus presses. This is a fucking bloodbath. The momentum 
  continues to build as CAMERA SLOWLY SINKS below the arena (a 
  la Ep. 101), taking us to --



  Crixus stands above the fallen Secutor as the crowd CHEERS 
  for death. Crixus KICKS the Secutor's visor open.

  SECUTOR'S POV

  as Crixus peers down at him from above.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.
  CONTINUED:

                                        CRIXUS
                        The gods bless you today. You die 
                      at the hands of Crixus, true 
                        Champion of Capua!

  Crixus rears back and SLAMS his blade into the man's face. 
  Blood ERUPTS as Crixus releases the handle, the sword 
  QUIVERING back and forth from out of the helmet. CAMERA 
  CIRCLES CRIXUS as he takes in his adoring public. His eyes 
  finally land on

  THE PULVINUS

  where NAEVIA beams at his victory. She stands behind 
  LUCRETIA, who sits with DOMITIA and NUMERIUS. Lucretia 
  smiles at Crixus, thinking he is looking at her.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Crixus honors the memory of your 
                        husband.

  Batiatus sweeps in.

                                        BATIATUS
                      As do we all. Let us put these dark 
                        times behind us, and with Solonius' 
                        blood amend our grief.

  OFF BATIATUS, eyes twinkling at the thought...



  Batiatus steps forward to address the crowd.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Good Citizens of Capua! I stand 
                        before you, the sting of tears yet 
                        hot upon my cheeks, to redress a 
                        most vile crime against our city 
                        and our hearts. The murder of 
                        Magistrate Titus Calavius!

  The crowd HISSES and SHOUTS in outrage.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        His life stolen for lust of profit 
                        and advancement. His warmth and 
                        guidance torn from our hands, and 
                        those of loving wife and noble son!

  Lucretia takes Domitia's hand in sympathy, who dabs at her 
  tears. Numerius bites his own back in favor of cold, 
  vengeful fury.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Yet today we shall witness justice! 
                        The base criminal that has so 
                        wounded us shall be executed ad 
                        gladium!

  The crowd ROARS their approval.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

                        people!

  ARENA

  SOLONIUS is shoved out into the arena, sword in hand. He 
  stands disoriented as the crowd BOOS and pelts him with 
  garbage. THE PULVINUS

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        And who shall balance the scales?! 
                        Who shall restore honor to our 
                        city?! There is but one man! The 
                        Slayer of Theokoles! The Bringer of 
                        Rain! Spartacus, Champion of Capua!

  ARENA

  The crowd goes insane as Spartacus comes out of the chute 
  and squares off across from Solonius. Solonius swallows his 
  fear, drawing himself up.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        You survived your execution, 
                        Thracian. Upon these very sands. 
                        Perhaps good Solonius shall fare as 
                        well.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I would not expect it.

  He turns to lock eyes with Batiatus in the Pulvinus.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Begin!

  Solonius bellows as he suddenly attacks -- and proves that 
  he is not without considerable skill with a sword. The crowd 
  ROARS. Spartacus defends but does not strike back.

  PULVINUS

  Numerius seethes.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Why does Spartacus not strike in 
                        return?

                                        BATIATUS
                      He but extends the moment, to the 
                        favor of the crowd. The villain's 
                        blood will flow soon enough.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

  Batiatus places a reassuring hand on the boy's shoulder.

                                to Lucretia)(
                        Your husband has been a gift from 
                        the gods. Numerius would be lost 
                        without his support.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      He gains great comfort in the act.

                                          DOMITIA
                        The comfort is ours.

  She musters a smile at the sight of Batiatus and Numerius 
  together.

                                          DOMITIA(cont'd)
                      He will make a fine father, when 
                        the day comes.

  Lucretia forces a pained smile. She shifts her attention to 
  the arena, changing the subject.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Ah. Spartacus draws blood.

  ARENA

  Solonius reels back, a gash across his cheek. Spartacus eyes 
  him with appreciation.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You are not absent skill.

                                        SOLONIUS
                                  winded)(
                        Nor desire to live.

  Solonius attacks again. The crowd roars as Spartacus engages 
  him, trading blows.

  PULVINUS

  Batiatus laughs, clasping Numerius on the shoulder.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You see? Solonius comes to his end.

  ILITHYIA enters.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        And who would not wish it?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    7.
  CONTINUED:

  The streets of Rome are wet with tears of your loss.

  Numerius nods his thanks. Batiatus shoots Lucretia a look. 
  Lucretia whispers to Ilithyia as she sits.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      We have not received word from you, 
                        Ilithyia. I feared you had gone 
                        astray.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I could never abandon such a good 
                        friend. Could I?

  Ilithyia produces a measured smile.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Did you speak to your husband? 
                        About patronage for the House of 
                        Batiatus?

                                        ILITHYIA
                      At length. He comes to Capua a day 
                        hence, to discuss the matter 
                        personally.

  Lucretia beams at the news. The CROWD ROARS, pulling her 
  attention to --

  THE ARENA

  Spartacus drives Solonius back with vicious precision. The 
  crowd ROARS as Spartacus inflicts one wound after another, 
  slicing Solonius to pieces in a spray of blood.

  SOLONIUS FALLS TO HIS KNEES,

  his sword tumbling from his hand. The crowd CHEERS. Solonius 
  gazes into the stands with a sense of wonder.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        The roar of the crowd. There is no 
                        sound more glorious.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        The last you shall hear.

  Solonius looks up as Spartacus looms over him.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        You take the wrong life. Your 
                        master Batiatus. He is the villain.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    8.

                        And shall join you presently.

  TIGHT ON SOLONIUS as it dawns on him that Spartacus plans to 
  kill Batiatus. A smile forms just as Spartacus SLAMS HIS 
  SWORD THOUGH SOLONIUS' NECK. The crowd ROARS as he yanks it 
  out and Solonius' body collapses in a spray of blood. 
  Spartacus looks to

  THE PULVINUS

  where Batiatus nods to Spartacus with a satisfied smile. OFF 
  SPARTACUS, as a smile of his own forms, one tinged with 
  thoughts of vengeance...



  Spartacus angrily strikes a palus. A focused rage. SLOW PUSH 
  IN ON SPARTACUS, as each CRACK brings a FLASH of

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

  SURA

  in the moment before her death (from episode 106 - ALREADY 
  SHOT). Barely clinging to life. Spartacus slams the palus as 
  he FLASHES on Sura reaching up and touching his cheek with 
  her blood stained hand. The memory is shattered by --

  CRIXUS

  slamming the palus with his sword from the opposite side.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Your wooden man gives almost as 
                        much fight as Solonius.

                        With each victory, I draw closer to 
                        facing you again in the arena. And 
                        reclaiming stolen glory.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        There is no glory. Only blood, 
                        spilled for the pleasure of the 
                        Romans.

                                        CRIXUS
                        And how they will roar, when I 
                        spill yours across the sand.

  HECTOR appears at the edge of the square, face still marred 
  by his run-in with Spartacus (in episode 110).

                                        HECTOR
                        Spartacus! You are summoned.

  Spartacus looks to Crixus. Not planning to return.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I fear you will never have the 
                        chance.

  Spartacus drops his sword and follows Hector out of the 
  square. OFF CRIXUS, pondering the meaning of that...



  The hot sun beats down on Crixus as he spars. His body 
  glistening. Form flawless. CAMERA TILTS UP TO --

  THE BALCONY

  Aurelia pours wine. Lucretia sips it, her gaze focused on 
  Crixus. Eyes dancing with desire. Naevia shares her gaze, 
  her own eyes threatening tears.

  Lucretia pauses in her command, noticing Naevia's condition.

                        Your eyes. They threaten tears.

                        Apologies, Domina.

  Lucretia feels a twinge of guilt. Wants to comfort Naevia. 
  Tries to find the right words, but is unable to.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        None required.

                                  whispered)
                        Have Crixus brought to my chambers.

  Naevia nods and moves out. Lucretia watches in worry as she 
  goes, then rises. Her softness fades as she addresses 
  Aurelia.

                                          LUCRETIA(cont'd)
                        Clear this mess.

  Aurelia sets to it as Lucretia exits.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Spartacus watches Aurelia as he trains, his heart heavy with 
  guilt. MOVE OFF Spartacus to find Doctore with Agron and 
  Duro.

                                          DOCTORE

  Doctore walks away. Duro laughs.

                        Finally. Opportunity to remove 
                        myself from your fucking shadow.

  He joins HAMILCAR with a grin. Agron's mind races. He spots 
  Spartacus, an idea forming as he crosses to him.

                        Spartacus. I would make request.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Ask another, if you seek it 
                        granted.

  Spartacus motions for him to spar. Agron complies.

                                        AGRON
                      It is not for me, but for my 
                        brother. Batiatus orders us parted. 
                        Duro greets the news with laugh and 
                        fucking smile. Yet I fear he shall 
                        not survive the arena on his own.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You are not alone in the thought.

                                        AGRON
                        Batiatus shows you much favor. A 
                        word from your lips could see the 
                        decision undone.

  Spartacus darkens at the mention of Batiatus.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Batiatus favors no one but himself.

  Spartacus attacks, WIPING US TO --                                                                                    26.



  PEDESTRIANS make way as CLAUDIUS GLABER appears on 
  horseback, followed by TEN OF HIS MEN and a STANDARD BEARER. 
  Citizens gawk at the impressive sight.

  BATIATUS

  hustles up, winded, with Ashur and ATTENDING SLAVES in tow.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Legatus Glaber! Your arrival honors 
                        the fair city of Capua!

  Glaber barely acknowledges him.

                                        GLABER
                      An honor I expected matched by 
                        greeting at the gates.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Apologies. I had thought --

                                        GLABER
                                  curt)(
                        Let us move past it. My ears burn 
                        with reports of lawlessness since 
                        last I paid visit.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The Magistrate's murder was quite 
                          unfortunate...

                                        GLABER
                      As was that of Ovidius and his 
                        family. And now the cousin of 
                        Senator Crassus goes missing.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Let us retire to my villa, where we 
                        may discuss this and other matters 
                      at length.

                                        GLABER
                        I prefer to speak with someone in 
                        authority. Good Mercato awaits.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Shall I accompany you?

                                        GLABER
                        That will not be necessary. Await 
                      me at your villa.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

                                        BATIATUS
                        When may I expect you?

                                        GLABER
                        When I arrive.

  Glaber spurs his horse forward, the rest of his men 
  following. OFF BATIATUS, seething over the snub as he 
  watches them ride away, WIPING US TO...



  CLOSE ON A CHAIN, as it tightens around a wrist. PULL BACK 
  to find Iovis and Vesper shackling Crixus between two 
  paluses, facing the balcony. Doctore stands nearby with his 
  whip. Spartacus and the rest of the Gladiators watch, bound 
  in chains.

  BALCONY

  Batiatus addresses the men. Ashur stands beside him, holding 
  a large sack. Lucretia is also present, along with Mira, 
  Aurelia, and a few Attending Slaves.

                                        BATIATUS
                      No man is above retribution for 
                        offenses committed against the 
                        House of Batiatus. No gladiator. No 
                        champion.

  Spartacus tears his eyes from Crixus to look at Batiatus. 
  Batiatus reaches into Ashur's sack and pulls out HECTOR'S 
  SEVERED HEAD.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Not even the men that guard you, 
                        should they be guilty of deceit or 
                          incompetence.

  Batiatus tosses the head into the Training Square. Spartacus 
  eyes the BURN MARKS creasing Hector's dead face.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        The fault lies in my own breast, 
                        with a heart grown too large. This 
                        cannot stand. Legatus Claudius 
                        Glaber is now our honored Patron. 
                        And he has opened my eyes to the 
                        error of my generosity. One that 
                        demands correction.

  Batiatus nods down to Doctore.

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Doctore returns the nod. He pauses to whisper to Crixus, 
  regret filling his eyes.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.
  CONTINUED:

                                          DOCTORE
                        Embrace the pain. It is the only 
                        way.

  Doctore moves away, uncoiling his whip. Crixus locks eyes 
  with Lucretia. Her heart lodges in her chest.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Begin.

  Doctore rears back. The whip CRACKS, cutting into flesh. 
  Crixus winces in pain. CRACK. CRACK. CRACK. Agron looks on, 
  his face carved from stone. Duro averts his eyes. Spartacus 
  turns his to find Aurelia, worry creasing his face. Aurelia 
  avoids his look. But Mira can't help but notice it.

  BALCONY

  Ashur allows himself a veiled grin, his revenge now 
  complete. Tears fill Lucretia's eyes as she watches Crixus 
  suffer.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                                (still looking down 
                                  below)
                        I expect your meetings with Crixus 
                      to end.

  Lucretia is unable to hide her shock. Her fear.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Quintus --

                                        BATIATUS
                      Do not fucking speak. That you 
                        would think me a fool is insult 
                        enough. I have always known. And 
                        turned eye away only because it 
                        made you happy, and caused me no 
                        thought. Those days have ended.

  He looks at her for the first time.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Set your attentions to our child. 
                        And do not see them stray.
                                to Doctore)(
                        Enough!

  Batiatus strides back into the villa. Lucretia takes one 
  last longing look at Crixus, then moves to follow.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    46.
  CONTINUED:

  TRAINING SQUARE

  Glaber's men round up the Gladiators and march them into the 
  barracks. Crixus remains tied to the palus. Head bowed. His 
  breaths deep and ragged. Spartacus takes him in with pity as 
  he passes. Even an enemy doesn't deserve this. Crixus 
  ignores him, his eyes drawn to

  NAEVIA

  being escorted to the gate in chains. Her long hair has been 
  hacked off. Face bruised and bloodied. She sees Crixus and 
  breaks away, rushing to him. The Guard catches up, grabbing 
  her. Doctore looms.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Grant them a moment.
                                (off Guard's 
                                  hesitation)
                      He was our Champion once. Allow him 
                        such respect.

  The Guard hesitates, releases her and returns to the gate. 
  She rushes to Crixus, desperately kissing him. Knowing this 
  is their last moment together.

                                        CRIXUS
                      My actions have destroyed us.

                                        NAEVIA
                      We yet live.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Where do they take you?

                                        NAEVIA
                        I do not know.

  Crixus registers that, tears cutting through the sweat and 
  grime.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Keep me close to your heart.

  He kisses her for the last time, whispering to her.

                                          CRIXUS(cont'd)
                        I shall win my freedom. And not 
                        rest until my arms hold you again.

  Naevia tenses at the mention of freedom. Doctore steps up, 
  taking her arm.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    47.

                      It is time.

  Doctore gently escorts her to the gate. She tears her eyes 
  from Crixus to whisper to Doctore.

                                        NAEVIA
                      He speaks of freedom, as Barca did.

                                          DOCTORE
                        You have my word, that I shall aid 
                        him in the seeking of it.

                                        NAEVIA
                        No. You must not let him broach the 
                        subject. Barca was not freed. 
                        Batiatus took his life.

  The Guards step in to take her, cutting off further 
    conversation. OFF DOCTORE, reeling from the revelation...
