    XCU - A MAN S EYE as it snaps open (deja vu).  CUT WIDE to 
    see it belongs to

    LOCKE, lying by the side of the smoking fuselage.  We quickly 
    realize this is right after the crash.  A FLASHBACK.  And 
    we re experiencing it from his point-of-view.  Dazed, he 
    props himself up on his elbows and glances around, taking 
    stock of the other terrified survivors, including the  *
    screaming SHANNON, etc., until suddenly he notices...

    HIS POV - His feet.  One of his shoes is missing.

    Locke stares dumbly at his socked foot for a moment, then...

  He slowly wiggles his big toe.  Then, all the toes.

  He barely has time to process his parts are working before he 
    spots something.  CUT WIDE--

    OVER HIS SHOE, lying nearby on its side -- its CLEAN, 
    PRISTINE, UNSCUFFED SOLE facing camera.

    Oblivious to the panicked people running past him, Locke 
    retrieves the shoe, then sits up.*

    Amid the din, we may notice a new sound - A DOG BARKING.  It 
    starts faint, at first, then grows progressively louder as 
    Locke slowly bends his knee, bringing his foot into his lap.

  As he proceeds to put his shoe back on, we PUSH IN, the 
    BARKING becoming louder, more frantic...

    ...and LOCKE looks up...


    CLOSE ON LOCKE, sitting on the beach -- lost in his own 
    thoughts -- SNAPPED OUT by the sound of VINCENT barking.  He 
    looks over at... 

    WALT, holding VINCENT back as the dog strains at his leash.  
  A groggy MICHAEL sits next to him.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  2.



                                MICHAEL
                  Walt, ya gotta keep that dog quiet.

                                WALT
                I dunno what s the matter with him.
                        (pulling on leash)
                  C mon, Vincent--  Cut it out...

    Michael offers an apologetic look to Shannon and Boone, a few 
    feet away.

                                MICHAEL
                  Sorry...

    SHANNON tsk with annoyance.  BOONE nods, understandingly.

  We get QUICK POPS of some of the other regulars, stirring 
    awake to the commotion: SAYED, CLAIRE, HURLEY, JIN and SUN, 
    etc.  That s when we find... 

    JACK, already up.  And staring at something.  KATE appears 
    from behind and sidles up next to him.

                                KATE
                  What is it?

    She follows his gaze to see he s looking at

    THE FUSELAGE.  From inside we hear NOISES - banging around, 
    dull thuds.

                                CLAIRE
                  Somebody s in there.

                                SAYID
                  Everybody in there s dead.

                                JACK
                        (under his breath)
                  Sawyer.

                                SAWYER (O.S.)
                  Standing right behind you, jackass.

    Jack looks back over his shoulder to, indeed, find SAWYER.  
    Then, turning back, and with a deep breath, Jack takes out 
    his itty-bitty PENLIGHT.  He moves off toward the opening of 
    the ruined fuselage.

                                KATE
                  Jack...?






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  3.



  ON SAWYER - he throws a smirking glance to Kate, as he whips 
    out his MEGA-WATT FLASHLIGHT.  Kate rolls her eyes, then 
    follows Jack.  Sawyer follows her.

    Much schmuck-baiting as Jack nears the opening of the 
    wreckage, and Locke folds into the group from the other side.  
    The others in the camp hang back.

    REVERSE ANGLE - the four arrive at the opening and peer in.  
    The banging and noises are louder now.  And we see something 
  in the foreground... something NOT HUMAN moving inside.

  ON SAWYER - Waiting for Jack to make a move.  Then, out of 
    patience...

                                SAWYER
                  How  bout I shed a little light on--

    Sawyer switches his lamp on and attempts to bring it up, as a 
    SHARP GRUNT is heard from inside the fuselage, and Jack 
    blocks his arm.

    PUSH IN to the darkness inside the cabin as we can just make 
    out...

    CLOSE-UP - SOMETHING S HEAD turning to look at them.  
    Moonlight glinting of its feral, furious eyes as it snorts...

    CLOSE ON JACK - Staring back at it... Without turning, he 
    says to the others in a quiet, but urgent whisper:

                                JACK
                  Run.


                                END OF TEASER


















                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  4.


                                    ACT ONE


    Continuous.  The others barely have time to act on Jack s 
    suggestion when Sawyer shines the flashlight inside.

                                JACK
                  No!

    From inside... SHRIEKS!

    THREE SMALLISH SQUEALING BEASTS come barreling out of the 
    fuselage, fanning out in different directions.  Kate SCREAMS 
  as they run, and the camp is thrown into chaos.

    Random shouts of:  Look out!,   What s happening?!,   Get 
    away!,  etc., as some flee, some cower, others bring up make-
    shift weapons to defend themselves as the creatures charge 
    past them - including HURLEY, who wields a diving FLIPPER.

                                HURLEY
                  Aww crud, now what?

  ON JIN, brandishing a piece of driftwood as he commands SUN:

                                JIN
                      (in Korean)
                  Stay down.

    She obeys, staying crouched behind him.

  In the melee, one of the fleeing CASTAWAYS run right into 
    CHARLIE, knocking him down onto a jagged piece of wreckage.

                                CHARLIE
                  Hey-- Oww!

  On the ground, Charlie looks at the gash across his forearm, 
    then glances up and reacts as A BEASTIE closes in on him...

  ON CHARLIE - Terror rising.  At the very last second, he s 
    YANKED to his feet, flinching, as a BLUR OF FUR flashes by.  
  He glances back to discover it was

    JACK who pulled him out of the animal s path.  They both turn 
    just in time to see the RUSTLING OF BRUSH as the beasts 
    disappear into the jungle.

  ON SAYID, shouting to the others.

                                SAYID
                  It s alright!  They re gone!





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  5.



  ON BOONE, who d been shielding a wigged out Shannon.

                                BOONE
                  You okay?

                                SHANNON
                  Yeah.  Way to go, Ace.

  ON CHARLIE and JACK...

                                CHARLIE
                  What the bloody hell was it?

  ON LOCKE, nearby, staring off, stoically, in the direction of 
    the departing animals.

                                LOCKE
                  Boars.

                                                              UPCUT TO CU ON:


    The sun peeks out over the empty ocean.  Another day.


  ON A PILE of METAL PIECES, STRIPPINGS, WIRES and AIRPHONES 
    WITH CORDS.  Nearby lies the TRANSCEIVER from the cockpit.  
  As a HAND reaches in and picks up a wire, TILT UP to find

    SAYID, carefully wrapping the wire around a cylindrical piece 
  of piping attached to a curved piece of metal.

                                KATE (O.S.)
                  Guess I m not the only one who *
                  didn t sleep last night.*

  He glances up at her, then goes back to work.

                                SAYID
                  There are better uses for my time 
                  than collecting firewood.

                                KATE*
                        (gets his meaning)*
                  You don t agree with Jack.*

    Sayid doesn t answer her, just goes about his business.

                                KATE (CONT D)
                  What re you making?

                                SAYID
                  Too soon to talk about.  Not sure 
                if it ll even work.






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  8.



                                KATE*
                  You re trying to pick up the *
                  signal, aren t you?  The one we  *
                  heard on the transceiver.*

    Bingo.  Reluctantly, Sayid nods.*

                                SAYID*
                If the French woman s transmissions 
                  have truly been playing on a loop 
                  for sixteen years, then there must  *
                be a power source on this island.  
                A significant one.

                                KATE*
                  You can find it?*

                                SAYID*
                    Hypothetically... yes.*
                        (beat)*
                  I m making an antenna, of sorts.  *
                  With a few of these mounted at *
                  different points on the island, I 
                  may be able to use the transceiver 
                to triangulate the signal.  Find 
                  out where it s coming from.

                                KATE
                  What can I do to help?

                                SAYID
                  This is only a prototype.  Testing  *
                it now may be premature...*

                                KATE
                  Then it s a good thing I test well. *

    Sayid eyes her for a moment.  Smiles.  A moment.  Then -- *

                                SAYID
                  Appears you re as anxious to get 
                  off this island as I am.

    Boy, don t we know it.  Off Kate...*


  ON MICHAEL, collecting wood near the edge of the jungle.  
    Walt sits nearby, petting Vincent, who s tied to a tree.  He 
    suddenly catches sight of

    HIS POV - LOCKE, sitting in the sand, unlocking a SUITCASE,  *
    and lifting the lid toward camera, masking what s inside.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST   "Walkabout"         (BLUE)         7/20/04     9.



  ON WALT, he gets up and starts to walk off.  Michael sees him 
    out of the corner of his eyes.

                                MICHAEL
                  Where you going, man?

                                WALT
                        (busted)
                  Nowhere.

    MICHAEL looks over at LOCKE, now rummaging through the 
    suitcase.

                                WALT (CONT D)
                I just thought... I wanted to go 
                  see what Mr. Locke s doing.

                                MICHAEL
                  How  bout you help your dad with *
                  the wood, okay?
                        (beat)
                  I m sure Mr. Locke doesn t want a 
                  kid hanging around him all day, 
                  anyway.

    Walt is obviously not keen on that option, but he grudgingly 
    begins to pick up sticks --

                                WALT
                At least he talks to me.

    That STINGS -- but it s kinda true, too.

                                MICHAEL
                  Okay.  Let s talk then.  What you 
                  wanna talk about?

                                WALT
                  Forget it.

  As Walt sulks, Michael casts another wary eye at Locke, 
    before picking up a final piece of wood and crossing back to 
    the fuselage, where we find...

    JACK, a bandana around his neck, supervising as various 
    others bring over wood and brush.  He takes Michael s 
    delivery and passes it along to a chain of two other MEN 
    inside the cabin, also wearing something across their faces.  
  He casts a wary eye over at







                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  10.



    HIS POV - A SMALL GATHERING of four or five CASTAWAYS 
    talking, occasionally peering over.  Among them is Claire, 
    who looks at Jack, then peels away and crosses to him. *

                                CLAIRE
                  Excuse me.  Doctor...?

                                JACK*
                  Jack.  Claire, right?*
                      (re: her belly)*
                  How s the...?*

                                CLAIRE*
                  Good.  He s good.*
                        (beat)*
                I think maybe you should see this.*

    She hands Jack some folded, partially SINGED papers.  As he  *
    unfolds them...*

                                CLAIRE (CONT D)*
                  Somebody found it.
                        (pointing to the fuselage)
                In there.  They re collecting *
                  belongings.

    JACK S POV - The pages contain hand written notes accompanied 
  by COLOR PHOTOS OF A HAPPY, YOUNG COUPLE, lovely bridal gown, 
  a luxurious beach resort, floral arrangements, etc.*

                                CLAIRE (CONT D)*
                  They re weeding plans.*
                        (pointing, reading)
                   Steve and Kristen s.   They were *
                on the plane.  Sitting a couple of *
                  rows behind me.  I remember *
                   cause...*
                      (a little overcome)*
                  They looked... so happy.*

    Jack quickly returns the pages to her, awkward under the  *
    weight of her raw emotion --*

                                JACK
                  I-- I don t understand, Claire, 
                  what am I supposed to do with--

                                CLAIRE
                I thought... Well, some of us were  *
                  wondering if maybe we should do 
                  some kind of... thing.  Like a *
                  memorial service or something.  You 
                  could lead it...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  11.



                                JACK
                  Uh, no, I don t think...*

                                CLAIRE
                  It s just a few words.  Or maybe we *
                  could just read off names.  From 
                  the passports or driver s licenses--

    Jack s had ENOUGH --*

                                JACK*
                  Look -- It s not my thing. *

    Claire instantly backs off.  Clear to her (and us) she s  *
    pushing a button that best ain t pushed -- *

                                CLAIRE*
                  Oh.  Okay.  Then... maybe I could *
                do it.*

                                JACK*
                  Yeah.  Sounds fine.  Whatever 
                  everybody wants.

    And with that, Jack walks off.  As Claire watches him go... *


  ON BOONE, collecting wood... He looks up as

    JIN, crosses by, his arms also laden with wood.  They notice 
    each other.  After a moment, Boone offers:

                                BOONE
                  Hi.

    Jin returns the greeting with a friendly nod and moves off.  
    Boone crosses to a piece of driftwood high on the beach, then  *
    suddenly sees

    ROSE, sitting far down the beach, near the surf, by herself. *

    REVERSE - CLOSE ON ROSE, just sitting, staring out at the  *
    sea, gently caressing the gold band she wears on a string 
    around her neck.  We can make out BOONE in the deep  *
    background.*


  ON SHANNON, doing a crossword puzzle in the back of an 
    airline magazine, as others continue to toil around her.  We 
    see BOONE dump off his wood by the fuselage and cross to her:





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  12.



                                BOONE
                  That woman s still sitting out *
                  there.*

                                SHANNON*
                        (barely listening)
                Uh huh.

                                BOONE*
                  Her husband was on the plane.  In *
                  the back.*

                                SHANNON*
                  Great.*

                                BOONE *
                  Are you even listening to me?*

                                SHANNON*
                  What s a four-letter word for  I *
                  don t care?  *

                                BOONE*
                  She hasn t moved from that spot *
                  since yesterday, Shannon.*
                        (beat)
                  Somebody should go talk to her.

                                SHANNON
                I nominate you.*
                        (weary sigh)*
                  Taking care of the whole freakin  *
                  world, one person at a time.

                      BOONESHANNON
    Not the whole world.  Just my 
                     sister--*-- Who was doing just fine  *
                                                until you came along.**

                                BOONE*
                  Yeah!  You had it all together.   *
                  That s why I had to fly seven *
                  thousand miles to rescue your ass.*
                        (then)
                  Face it, Shannon.  You d be lost *
                  without me.

                                SHANNON*
                  Correction.  I am lost with you.







                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"         (PINK)         7/22/04     13.



                                BOONE
                  Yeah, well, at least you know you 
                  won t starve with me to take care 
                of you.

                    SHANNONBOONE
    I m not gonna starve...
                                              -- Yeah?  What re you gonna 
                                              eat?

                                SHANNON
                        (shrugs)
                  Ocean s full of fish.

                                BOONE
                  Hate to break it to you, but the 
                  ocean s not gonna take your gold  *
                  card.*

    And now Shannon finally puts down her magazine.  It s ON --

                                SHANNON
                  You don t think I can catch a fish?

    Boone s look at her says it all.  Nope.  Before she can 
    respond, their attention s drawn to...

    ANGLE ON SAWYER and HURLEY, yelling on top of one another.  
    Hurley keeps reaching for the backpack in Sawyer s hands.  
    Sawyer shoves him away.  As they quarrel, ten or fifteen 
    castaways converge on them.

                    HURLEYSAWYER
  -- hand  em over -- There s -- How  bout  no  -- 
    other people here, or don t Well, maybe if one of us 
    you give a crap -- didn t eat more than his fair 
    That s bull and you know it -- share, wouldn t be a shortage 
    Dude, what s your Problem?!  -- Hey, I m peachy, pork-pie.  
    Not happy unless you re You re the one--
    screwing over--

    Boone enters the fray, trying to calm the situation.

                                BOONE
                  Okay, guys, knock it off.  C mon --

                                SAWYER
                  Stay outta this, Metro--

                                JACK (O.S.)
                  What s going on?






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"         (BLUE)         7/20/04     14.



    Sawyer, Hurley and Boone look over to see JACK, KATE and 
    SAYID pushing past some of the onlookers.

                                HURLEY
                        (indicating Sawyer)
                  Jethro here s hoarding the last 
                  bags of peanuts.

                                SAWYER
                  It s my own stash.
                        (nodding to fuselage)
                  Found  em in there.

                                JACK
                      (to Hurley)
                  What about the rest of the food?

                                HURLEY
                      (to Hurley)
                  There is no rest of the food, dude.  
                  It s gone.  We kinda... ate it all.

    The castaways start to murmur:  No food?   And PANIC begins 
  to seep in.  People are really starting to get scared.  The 
    KNOWERS doing their best to maintain order --

                      JACKSAYID
    Okay, everybody calm down...
                                              -- We can find food.  There 
                                              are plenty of things on this 
                                                island to sustain us.

  ON SAWYER, who casually leans against a row of detached  *
    airplane seats.*

                                SAWYER
                Oh yeah?  And exactly how are we 
                  gonna get this... sustenance?

    THWACK!  A good-sized knife suddenly imbeds itself in the  *
    empty seat next to Sawyer.  He flinches back, startled. *

  ON JACK, KATE and the others as they turn toward the 
    direction from which the knife had come to see *

    LOCKE.

                                LOCKE
                We hunt.

    Stop.  Let it sink in.  The pure AUTHORITY of this man.  
    After a moment, Kate steps toward him...





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"         (BLUE)         7/20/04     14A.



                                KATE
                  How d you get that knife on the 
                  plane?














































                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"         (BLUE)         7/20/04     15.



    Locke eyes her a moment... then shrugs.

                                LOCKE 
                I checked it.

    Jack PULLS the knife out of the seat.  For a second we think  *
  he might keep it... but instead, he offers it to Locke, hilt 
    out.  Sizing up this guy for the first time --

                                JACK
                  Either you ve got good aim...
                        (looks to Sawyer)
                Or bad aim, Mr...?

                                MICHAEL
                  Locke.  His name s Locke.

                                JACK
                  Okay.  So what is it we re hunting, 
                  Mr. Locke?

    SLOW PUSH IN ON LOCKE as he speaks...

                                LOCKE
                We know there are wild boar on the 
                  island.  Razorbacks by the look of 
                  them.  The ones who came into camp 
                  last night were piglets...  A 
                  hundred, hundred and fifty pounds 
                  each.  That means there s a mother 
                  nearby.  A two-hundred and fifty 
                  pound rat with scimitar-like tusks 
                  and a surly disposition, who d love 
                  nothing more than to eviscerate 
                  anything that comes near her...

  ON JACK, eyeing Locke as he continues...

                                LOCKE (CONT D)
                  ... Boars  usual mode of attack are 
                to circle around their prey, charge 
                  from behind.  So I figure it ll 
                  take at least three of us to flank 
                  one of the piglets, distract it 
                  just long enough for me to pin 
                  it... and slit its throat.

    Everyone stares at him, stunned for a moment.  Then Sawyer 
    turns to Jack --

                                SAWYER
                  And you gave him his knife back.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  16.



                                JACK*
                If you ve got a better idea... *

                                SAWYER*
                  Better than three of y all *
                  wandering into the magic forest to *
                  bag us a hunk  o ham armed with one  *
                  l il bitty knife?  Hell no!  That s  *
                  the best idea I ever heard!*

    With the barest of smirks, Locke takes a step toward his 
    black bag lying nearby and deftly KICKS open the lid.

    REVEAL, strapped to the lid, HALF A DOZEN LARGE HUNTING 
    KNIVES, of various shapes and sizes, along with other hunting 
    accountrements: fishing line; snake-bite kit; etc.

    The others REACT.  Fuck.*

    CLOSE ON HURLEY:

                                HURLEY
                  Who is this guy?*


    CLOSE ON A KNIFE, glinting in the sunlight.  Widen to see 
    Kate holding it, looking it over, before she slides it into 
    her belt and continues gearing up she hears:

                                JACK (O.S.)
                So you re hunting boars now, huh?*

    She turns and sees Jack.  Hint of a smile.  This will always  *
  be their dynamic -- concern baked under the fluffy crust of a  *
    CHEMISTRY neither can deny.  As they WALK AND TALK -- *

                                KATE
                  Who says this is my first time boar- *
                  hunting.*

                                JACK*
                Uh huh.  Tell me something -- How *
                  come anytime there s a hike into *
                  the Heart of Darkness, you sign up?   *
                  You know what s in there.*

                                KATE*
                  Actually, I don t.*

    And we can see that Kate is kinda scared... VULNERABLE, even. *

                                KATE (CONT D)*
                  But at least I ve got some  *
                  experience, right?*

    Jack smiles.  She can handle herself.  So he turns his  *
    attention across the beach towards --*

    LOCKE, filling his VEST with stuff from his suitcase... *

                                JACK*
                  What s your feel on our new friend? *

                                KATE
                  Seems to know what he s doing.

                                JACK*
                  Call me paranoid, but anyone who *
                  packs a suitcase full of knives...*

                                KATE*
                        (smiles)*
                If I didn t know better, I d say  *
                  you were worried about me, Jack. *





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"        (YELLOW)         8/2/04     19.



                                JACK
                If I didn t know better, I d say 
                  you ve got a problem staying in one 
                  place very long, Kate.
                        (beat)
                So you wanna tell me why you re 
                  really going?

    Kate stops.  She s busted.  Eager to break this awkward 
    moment,  Kate makes sure they re far enough away from the 
    others -- Opens up her pack, revealing SAYID S ANTENNA.

                                KATE
                  Sayid gave me this so he can 
                  triangulate the distress signal we 
                  heard -- Find the source.

                                JACK
                        (realizing)
                  This isn t about boars.

    She smiles as she refastens her bag and hoists it, does her 
    best to cover her nervousness with bravado --

                                KATE
                  What can I say?  I m a vegetarian.

    She moves off.  Jack watching her go.


    WALT s pleading with Michael who shoves things into a pack.

                                WALT
                  But why can t I come?

                                MICHAEL
                  Because I said so --

  At that moment, Michael notices SUN crossing by, holding 
    plants she s apparently dug up.  He attempts to communicate 
    with her pantomimicaly as he introduces himself --*

                                MICHAEL (CONT D)
                  Uh, hi.  I m, uh, Michael.  Mi-*
                  chael.  My name.*

                                SUN*
                        (gesturing to herself)*
                  Sun.*







                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"        (YELLOW)         8/2/04     19A.



                                MICHAEL*
                   Sun.   Sun... That s-- that s *
                  nice.  Uh, listen, Sun... I m... *
                  I... am going off... off... away... 
                to hunt... And I was wondering... 
                if you... you could keep an eye on 
                my boy... Walt... Y know... Watch 
                  him for me... Until I get back...

    Sun looks somewhat apprehensive at first, then, after a 
    moment s thought, she nods and speaks in Korean:

                I will gladly look after your son.

                                MICHAEL
                  Sorry... I don t understand 
                  Japanese, but -- You re cool with *
                  this, right?

                                SUN
                        (smiling shyly)
                  Yes.  And I m Korean.

                                WALT
                I don t need a baby-sitter...

                                MICHAEL
                  C mon, man.  Vincent needs you *
                  here, okay?*

  As Walt sulks, Michael adds:

                                MICHAEL (CONT D)
                  And cheer up.  This ll give me a 
                  chance to get to know your friend 
                  Mr. Locke a little better.

    With that, he heads off to join Kate and Locke, as they move 
    off into the jungle.

                                SUN
                  Try not to worry about your father.  
                He will be all right.

                                WALT*
                  Yeah, whatever.


  ON CHARLIE as he sits down in a quiet secluded spot, looks 
    around to see the coast is clear, then takes out his bag of 
    dope.  Clearly about to take a hit, then...

    REVERSE ANGLE - BEHIND HIM as a pair of shapely legs come 
    into frame.  Feeling someone s presence, Charlie turns his 
    head and peers up at

    SHANNON, the sun backlighting her, haloing her head.

                                SHANNON
                  Hi.

                                CHARLIE
                  Uh, hello.  Shannon, right? *




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  21.



                                SHANNON
                  Yeah.*
                      (her best smile)*
                  You doing anything right now?*

                                CHARLIE
                  Oh, um...
                        (shoving the bag into his 
                        pocket)
                  N-no, not really.  At the, uh... *

  He gets to his feet.

                                CHARLIE (CONT D)
                  What are you doing now?

                                SHANNON
                I was just gonna take a walk.  
                  Wanna come?

                                CHARLIE
                  Er.  Yeah.  Sure.

    They head off down the beach.  Charlie glowing from the 
    attention.  After a beat...

                                SHANNON
                  Can I ask you something?

                                CHARLIE
                        (grinning)
                I was wondering when you were gonna 
                  get  round to it.  Yes.  I m the 
                  bass player from Drive Sha--

                                SHANNON
                Do you know anything about fishing?

                                CHARLIE
                  What--?

    Charlie halts, caught off-guard.  Then, off her expectant 
    look, he clearly lies, sputtering out:

                                CHARLIE (CONT D)
                  Fishing?  Oh, yeah... My granddad 
                  used to take me, taught me  *
                  everything he knows... knew -- He s *

                  I m, like, a... fishing fiend.*

                  England s an island after all, *
                  in it?*

    OFF SHANNON s pleased look...


    ANGLE ON A WHEELCHAIR laden with wood, being pulled by a  *
    CASTAWAY and delivered to --*

    JACK, a bandana across his mouth and nose, feeding wood and 
    dried brush into the fuselage.  As the Castaway moves off,  *
    leaving the wheelchair, Boone approaches.*

                                BOONE
                  Doc?  Got a sec?*

                                JACK
                  Just call me Jack...  What s up?

    Boone points down the beach.  Jack looks.

    HIS POV - Rose, still sitting out there.

                                BOONE
                  Woman s been sitting by herself.  I  *
                  don t think she s had any food or *
                  water.  Guess she s having trouble *
                  dealing...  Y know, about her *
                  husband.  Think maybe you could go  *
                  and talk to her or something?*

                                JACK
                  Why me?  I m not a psychiatrist.  *
                  Maybe you should...*

                                BOONE
                I just figured you might want to  *
                   cause, well...*
                        (beat)*
                  You re the one who saved her life.*

  As Jack looks off in Rose s direction, considering... *


    CLOSE ON a tree trunk, the bark rubbed off.  A hand reaches 
    into frame, feeling the scarred grooves in the trunk.

    WIDEN to find Locke, in expert tracker mode, squatting next 
  to the tree.  He reaches down, brings up some loose soil.  
    Kate and Michael in the background.  Kate steps toward Locke.

                                KATE
                  Find something?





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  23.



  He gives her a cursory glance, then tosses the dirt, stands. *

                                LOCKE
                  Ground here s been rooted up.  
                  That s how boars get the majority 
                of their food.  Digging.  
                  Afterwards, they generally wallow 
                in the dirt, rub up against trees --
                        (pointing out tree scars)
                  --Scoring them with their tusks.

                                MICHAEL
                  O-kay.  So what s all that mean?*

                                LOCKE
                  Means we re close.

  He starts to move off, as Kate falls into step with him. *

                                KATE
                  Mr. Locke, how is it you--
                        (smiles; then)*
                  Sorry... You have a first name?*

                                LOCKE*
                  It s John.*

                                KATE
                  John Locke.  Like the philosopher.*

    Locke eyes her, appreciatively.  That grin --*

                                LOCKE
                  Like the philosopher.*

                                KATE
                        (searching her memory)
                   Good and evil, reward and 
                  punishment, are the only motives to 
                a rational creature... 

    She sees Locke and Michael just looking at her, suddenly  *
    becomes self-conscious.

                                KATE (CONT D)
                  Minored in college.

                                MICHAEL
                  Great.  And I got an art degree.
                        (looking around, ironic)
                  Who says higher education doesn t 
                  prepare you for the real world?





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  24.



                                KATE
                  And where d you learn all this  *
                  stuff, John?  Tracking, hunting...*

    Locke continues to look at her before answering...

                                LOCKE
                  Well, let s just say I ve had time 
                to minor in a few things myself.

    LOCKE continues on, moving past frame as we stay with Kate  *
    and Michael.  They follow several steps behind.

                                MICHAEL
                        (sardonic, re: Locke)
                  Huh.  International Man of Mystery.

  As they pass frame...


  ON ROSE, still sitting stoically, staring out as an airline 
    blanket is suddenly draped over her shoulders.  She doesn t 
    respond or look up as Jack sits down next to her.  He holds 
    out a half empty bottle of water:

                                JACK
                  Hi.  Rose, right?  Remember me?  
                  Seat 23A?

    Getting no response from her, he adds, wryly:

                                JACK (CONT D)
                  I m the guy that told you not to 
                  worry about the turbulence.

    Rose doesn t even look at him.

                                JACK (CONT D)
                  Everybody s getting kinda worried 
                  about you.  If you want to be *
                  alone, that s fine, but you need to 
                  take care of yourself.  You really 
                  should drink.
                      (no response, he sighs)
                  Okay... We don t have to talk.  
                  Let s just sit.  For a while.

    And they do.  In silence.


  ON KATE and MICHAEL - MOVING -- She glances at him, then... *




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  25.



                                KATE
                  Your son -- How s he handling all 
                  this?

                                MICHAEL
                  Hell of a lot better than I am.

                                KATE
                  You must be proud.  He s a brave *
                  kid.*

                                MICHAEL*
                  Yeah.  Can t take credit for that --  *
                I wasn t part of his life,  til his 
                  mother passed away.  Two weeks ago.

                                KATE
                  Oh, I m sorry -- I didn t--

                                MICHAEL
                  That s okay.  They were living in 
                  Sydney the past couple of years.  I  *
                  flew out last week.  To, y know...  *
                  get him.*
                        (beat, he looks at her)
                  What were you doing in Australia?

  ON KATE.  Uh oh.  Thankfully --*

                                LOCKE (O.S.)
                  Shhhhh...

    They halt and look to find themselves in a FIELD OF TALL  *
    GRASS.  Kate and Michael FREEZE as Locke signals --  It s *
    right there.   And sure enough, we see --*

    FLASHES of dark fur as what must be a BOAR moves through the  *
    tall grass.  GRUNTS.  SNORTS.  And shit -- it s CLOSE. *

    LOCKE turns toward Michael and Kate and tries to signal them,  *
    silently, to flank the boar...*

    KATE starts to move up, close to Locke, but MICHAEL, eager to 
    challenge Locke s authority, is resistant to comply.

                                MICHAEL
                        (whispering)
                  Quit giving us the steal sign.  
                  Damn pig doesn t even know we re--

  A LOUD SNORT as --*






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"         (BLUE)         7/20/04     26.



    SOMETHING EXPLODES FROM THE TALL GRASS.  IT S BIG.  FLASH OF 
    FUR AND TUSK AS IT CHARGES

    Locke grabs onto Kate, pulling her out of the way of the 
    charging BOAR.  The animal sideswipes LOCKE hard, sending him  *
    spinning to the ground... And continues to charge at *

    MICHAEL -- IT HITS HIM HARD IN THE LEG AND HE GRUNTS IN PAIN  *
  as he goes down --*

    Kate picks herself up a few feet away -- the GRUNTING AND  *
    SNORTING still all around them -- and makes her way to help  *
    Michael.*

    CLOSE ON LOCKE, down on the ground, dazed -- we re in his  *
    head space again (dream-like, SLO-MO), much like we saw him 
  in the teaser.  He props himself up and sees

    HIS POV - Kate reaches Michael, obviously HURT.  As we 
    continue to hear the angry SNARLS of the boar.

    BACK TO LOCKE as he turns his attention to...

    HIS FEET.  Just like in the teaser.  He hasn t lost a shoe, 
    but he doesn t appear to be wiggling his toes, either.

    CLOSE ON LOCKE, continuing to stare at his legs, the sounds 
    around him fading, as we hear:

                                WARREN (PRE-LAP)
                  Move...


  ON LOCKE, still frozen on the ground.  Just looking at his 
    legs.  Lost in his own head while --

    FIFTEEN FEET AWAY, Kate is with Michael.  As she bends down 
  to look at his injury...

                                MICHAEL
                  How bad is it?

    CLOSE ON MICHAEL S LEG WOUND - a deep GASH across his thigh.  
    Kate sucks in a breath, as freaked as we are.

                                KATE
                Uh -- it s... bad.

    Kate stands, looking around through the grass -- Finally 
    spots LOCKE on the ground.  Moves towards him, concerned --

                  John...?
                        (moving to him)
                  You all right?

                                LOCKE
                        (waving her off)
                  Fine.  I m fine, Helen.

  He starts to move his legs and slowly rises to his feet.

              LOCKE (CONT D)KATE
    Just-- Just got the wind -- Helen...?
    knocked out of me -- What?
                                              -- You called me Helen.

    Locke glances at her, distracted.

                                LOCKE (CONT D)
                  Did I?*
                        (changing subject)
                  Which way did the boar go?

                                KATE*
                  Michael s hurt.  We ve got to get *
                  him back to...*

                                LOCKE
                  Yeah, of course.  You take him back  *
                to camp.  I ll get the boar.

                                KATE
                  What -- What are you talking about?

                                LOCKE
                  I m fine.  I can do it.*

    Before she can make a move to stop him, he takes off into the 
    brush.  Kate follows a few steps, calling after him...

                                KATE
                  John -- You can t!  LOCKE!!!

    She stops.  He s gone.  She shares a look with Michael. *

  ON LOCKE, moving through the jungle, a man possessed... *

                                LOCKE

                                    ACT THREE


    CLOSE ON THE REEF BED - we see a fish, swimming among the 
    coral.  It s lovely, tranquil, then --

  A POINTED STICK clumsily stabs into the water, once, twice...

    WIDEN to find Hurley and Charlie standing on the reef, their 
    pants rolled up to their knees.  It s Hurley stabbing the 
    water with the spear as Charlie watches.

                                CHARLIE
                Ya get it?

                                HURLEY
                  Dude -- Quit asking me that.  No!

                                CHARLIE
                  Sorry.
                        (then)
                  You said you knew how to catch 
                  fish.

                                HURLEY
                  Yeah. -- Off the Santa Monica Pier 
                  with my old man and a fishing pole 
                  and bait.  Never had to poke one 
                  with a sharp stick before.

                                CHARLIE
                  Well, anyway... Really appreciate 
                  your help.

                                HURLEY
                  Hey, anything that keeps me far 
                  away from that fuselage...
                        (stabs at the water again)
                  And that freakin  redneck jerk.

    And again, he stabs at the water.  Then, frustrated, he 
    starts beating the water with the stick.

                                HURLEY (CONT D)
                  Ah, dammit -- crap -- Son of a -- *

                                CHARLIE
                Er -- Maybe I can give it a go.

    Hurley stops pounding, hands him the stick.

                                HURLEY
                  Knock yourself out.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  32.



    Charlie readies himself, scans the water, his spear poised.

                                HURLEY (CONT D)
                        (spotting a fish)
                  Okay, here comes one.  Remember to 
                  put your weight into it...  He s 
                  heading your way... Easy... Wait 
                  for it...  Wait... NOW!

    Charlie stabs hard, slips on the slick reef and falls 
    headfirst into the water.  He flails a moment before 
    awkwardly righting himself in the shallow inlet.

              HURLEY (CONT D)CHARLIE
    Aw, dude -- You were supposed You told me to put my weight 
  to try to pin it against--into it--

    Suddenly, in the midst of their bickering, they pause, 
    feeling a presence, and look back at the beach to see

    JIN -- just standing and staring at them.

    Charlie, still standing in the water, and Hurley share an 
    embarrassed look.  After this awkward beat --

    Jin crosses out onto the reef, squats and stares down into 
    the water.

                                HURLEY (CONT D)
                  Uh, hey, careful, man.  You re 
                  gonna scare away all the --

    SPLASH!  Jin s hand juts into the water and he comes up with 
  a good sized fish.  He turns, hands it to Charlie, nods and 
    crosses away.

    OVER HURLEY and CHARLIE as they look at each other, then turn 
    and watch Jin leaving.


    CLOSE ON HANDS, bending and breaking off metal trimming from 
    wreckage.

    WIDEN to see it s SAYID.  MOVE WITH HIM as he gathers his new 
    metal pieces and crosses by the Fuselage, people still 
    filling it with brush, then... CLAIRE, sorting through a 
    growing pile of wallets, passports, fanny-packs, etc.  She 
    notices him.

                                CLAIRE
                  Um... Is your name Sayid?





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  33.



                                SAYID
                  Yes.

    She holds up a singed envelope.

                                CLAIRE
                  This has your name on it.

  ON SAYID, almost disbelieving, as he takes it from her...

                                SAYID
                  I... I thought I d lost this.

    Claire smiles and goes back to her sorting.

    CLOSE ON SAYID as he pulls out a batch of photographs.

    HIS POV - They re almost exclusively photos of a WOMAN -- 
    some are taken of her from behind, in others her face is  *
    OBSCURED BY A VEIL.*

    SAYID, clearly elated to have these back.  He continues on...


  ON JACK and ROSE, still sitting.  Rose looking intently at 
    the ring in her hand.  After a beat, he looks at her.

                                JACK
                  You a religious woman, Rose?
                      (no answer)
                I didn t get much religion growing 
                  up.  Just wasn t an issue in my 
                  family.
                        (beat)
                  Kinda wishing it had been, y know.  
                  After you ve been in a plane 
                  crash... Helps to believe in... 
                  Something.

    After a long beat...*

                                ROSE
                  His fingers swell.

    Jack sits up.  Surprised she s finally said something... *

                                JACK*
                  Sorry?*

                                ROSE
                  Bernard.  My husband.  His hands 
                  swell up when we fly...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"         (GREEN)         8/2/04     34.



                                JACK
                        (nodding)
                  The altitude --

                                ROSE
                He started having me hold onto his 
                  wedding ring whenever we took a 
                  plane trip.  Always wore it around 
                my neck for safe keeping.  Just 
                  until we landed, you see...

    Jack nods, sympathetically.  Rose finally looks at him.

                                ROSE (CONT D)
                  Y know, Doctor, you don t need to *
                  keep your promise.

                                JACK
                  Promise?

                                ROSE
                  The one you made to me on the 
                  plane.  To keep me company until my 
                  husband got back from the restroom.
                      (she smiles)
                  I m letting you off the hook.

                                JACK
                  Sorry.  You re not getting rid of 
                me that easily.*

    Rose goes back to staring at the ocean.

                                JACK (CONT D)
                  Rose... You shouldn t be out here 
                  alone.  You re suffering from a 
                  post-traumatic shock...

                                ROSE
                  Aren t we all?

    Jack sees the humor in that and laughs.

                                JACK
                  Yeah.  I guess we are.

    The two share the chuckle as she looks at him again --

                                ROSE
                  You ve got a nice way about you.  A  *
                  good soul.  Patient.  Caring... I 
                  suppose that s why you became a 
                  doctor.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST     "Walkabout"       (GOLDENROD)      8/4/04    35.



                                JACK
                        (smile fading)
                  Thanks, but I was just kind of born 
                  into it...
                        (pensively)
                  Family business.

    Before she can say anything further, he jumps in with:

                                JACK (CONT D)
                Do you have a family, Rose?  Kids, I 
                  mean... You and Bernard?

                                ROSE
                  Mm-hm.  Three.  All boys.

                                JACK
                  Three.  That s great.  And I m sure 
                  it s important for you to get back 
                to them.  They need their mom.

                                ROSE
                I appreciate the thought, Doctor.  
                  But my boys are all grown.  Kids 
                  get to a certain age, you need them 
                  more than they need you.

    Something about that seems to hit home with Jack.  Almost to 
    himself:

                                JACK
                I don t know about that.

  ON KATE and MICHAEL as they reach a small clearing.  Kate 
    suddenly stops, looking up at a nearby tree.

                                KATE
                  Wait a minute...

                                MICHAEL
                  That the guy with the gimpy leg 
                  should be deciding when we rest.

    She drops her bag and takes off her over-shirt.

                                MICHAEL (CONT D)
                  What re you doing?

                                KATE
                  Trying to boost the transceiver 
                  signal.  I m gonna climb this tree 
                  and attach an antenna.

    Michael looks up at...

    HIS POV - A very tall tree.

                                MICHAEL
                  You re gonna climb that?

                                KATE
                  Climbed a lot worse.

    She throws the bag over her shoulder, gets a grip on the tree 
    and starts up.  We follow her all the way up, using whatever  *
    outcroppings from the trunk that she can for her footing.

  As she reaches the top, she takes the antenna out of the bag 
    and attempts to attach it with a bungee cord when she hears:  *
    THAT UNGODLY SOUND and ghostly moan.*

  ON MICHAEL, hearing it, too.*

                                MICHAEL*
                  Aw, hell.*

    BACK TO KATE as she sees:  TREES, bending violently --  *
    Something very large making its way across frame.*









                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"         (GREEN)         8/2/04     40.



    PUSH IN ON KATE as she realizes - IT S BACK.  The HUGE, 
    RAVENOUS THING... She suddenly loses her grip on the  *
    antenna...

    GROUND LEVEL - As the antenna hits, it smashes to pieces, 
    right before Michael.*

                                MICHAEL (CONT D) *
                  Hey!!*

  ON KATE, reaching the ground.*

                                MICHAEL (CONT D) *
                  You hear that?*

                                KATE*
                  It s on the move.*

                                MICHAEL*
                  What -- Toward us?*

                                KATE*
                  No.  It s going that way.   *
                  Toward...*

    She hesitates, realizing something.*

                                MICHAEL*
                  What s wrong?*

    She looks at him.*

                                KATE*
                I think it s heading for Locke.*


    TRACKING CLOSE ON LOCKE, as he catches sight of

    THE BOAR - or rather a MASS OF BROWN FUR quickly disappearing  *
    into a patch of dense brush.*

    LOCKE moves in, slowly, producing and bringing up the large 
    hunting knife in his hand.  Then he suddenly halts as he  *
    hears, from the brush:*

    THE BOAR SHRIEKING IN AGONY, its cries suddenly swallowed up  *
  by the INHUMAN GRINDING NOISE of our jungle monster. *

  ON LOCKE - as it gets quiet again.  His mind reels with  *
    options before he becomes aware of something moving toward  *
    him.  He braces himself and slowly looks up as*

    THING POV - High up, coming through the trees, finding Locke 
    staring up at it.  We hear that undefinable NOISE...

  ON LOCKE, as a large shadow falls over him.  He stands his 
    ground, frozen with... Awe?  As he looks into the face of the 
    behemoth...

  ON CLAIRE - sitting on a blanket, organizing the various 
    licenses, passports, pictures, and other documents when

    Five other wallets are suddenly tossed onto the pile.  She 
    looks up at --

                                SAWYER
                  These were, uh...  Found these the 
                  other day.  When I was...

                                CLAIRE
                  Thanks.

                                SAWYER
                        (moving off)
                  Yeah.

  He crosses past*

    SUN as she extracts a vicious fluid from the roots of a plant  *
    into a plastic bowl.*

    Walt sits nearby with Vincent, watching her.  Curious,  *
    despite himself.*

                                WALT*
                  What... What is that?*
                        (pointing at the fluid) *
                  That!*

    Sun smiles at him, then rubs some of the fluid across her  *
    bared teeth.*

                                WALT (CONT D)*
                  Ohh.  I get it.  Like toothpaste,  *
                  right?*

    Sun nods.  Then, teaching him the word in Korean, she sounds  *
  it out slowly.*

                                SUN*
                  Toothpaste.*

                                WALT*
                        (repeating, in Korean)*
                  Toothpaste.*






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"        (YELLOW)         8/2/04     41A.



                                SUN*
                  Smart boy.*

  As she gives Walt a wink, they suddenly hear somebody shout  *
     They re back!,  and see some of the CASTAWAYS rushing toward *

    KATE and MICHAEL emerging from the jungle; Michael leaning on 
    her.

    ANGLE ON WALT, seeing his father.*

                                WALT
                  Dad!

  He runs to him.  She watches him go.

  ON KATE, handing Michael over to Hurley.

                                KATE
                  Watch his leg.

                                HURLEY
                        (unsure about asking)
                  So, like, what happened out there?

    Before she can answer, Walt arrives to greet Michael --

                                WALT
                  Dad!
                        (eyeing the blood)
                  Your leg s all messed up.  Does it 
                  hurt?






















                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  42.



  ON MICHAEL - Pleased with his son s attention and concern, he  *
    looks past Walt and shares a look with SUN who watches, 
    smiling gently.  He thanks her with a nod.

                                MICHAEL
                  S okay, man.  Not as bad as it *
                  looks.

    Kate turns to cross away, only to find Sawyer s there to 
    greet her, with his usual smirk.

                                SAWYER
                  The mighty huntress returns. -- 
                  What s for dinner, honey?

                                KATE
                  Not now.

    She crosses off.  He watches her go, a little chagrined. *

  ON MICHAEL and WALT.

                                WALT
                  Wow...  So, like a boar fight --

                                MICHAEL
                  Wasn t so much a fight.  Pretty 
                  much just me getting gored.*

    Walt suddenly thinks of something and looks around:

                                WALT
                  Um... Where s Mr. Locke?

    Off Michael, unsure how to break the news...


  ON JACK and ROSE still sitting there in the sand, staring 
    out...

    THEIR POV - The sun dipping down past the horizon.

  ON JACK, speaking without looking at her.

                                JACK
                  Rose... After the sun goes down... 
                  We re burning the fuselage...

    She looks at him and turns to her.







                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  43.



                                JACK (CONT D)
                  It s... It s just something we have 
                to do.  There s gonna be a memorial *
                  service back at the camp.  For 
                  those who... who didn t make it.  A 
                  way for everyone to say good-bye.

    After a moment...

                                ROSE
                  I d like to be there for that.

    Jack s eyes widen.  She s READY.*

                                JACK
                  Okay.

  He gets up and helps Rose to her feet.

                                JACK (CONT D)
                  Maybe... if you d like to say 
                  something... Y know, about your 
                  husband... To say goodbye to him, 
                  I m sure--

                                ROSE
                        (squinting at him)
                  What?

                                JACK
                  I m just saying... If you want to 
                  say goodbye to Bernard--

    She smiles almost pityingly at Jack.

                                ROSE
                  Doctor -- My husband s not dead.

    TRACK BACK with her as she turns and starts walking toward 
    camp, leaving a stunned Jack behind.  Then he follows her...

                                JACK
                He was in the tail section, Rose.   *
                It broke off in mid-flight.  I m *
                  sorry, but... Everyone in the rear 
                of the plane s gone.

                                ROSE*
                  They re probably thinking the same 
                  thing about us.

  ON JACK, chewing on that, when he suddenly glances at 
    something and freezes...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  44.



    HIS POV - an OLDER MAN standing on the edge of the jungle, 
    near a cluster of trees, a good distance away.  To us, he 
    could easily appear to be one of the CASTAWAYS.  To Jack, 
    there s something else.  He can t make out the man s face, 
    but he wears an impeccably clean, dark blue suit... And WHITE 
    TENNIS SHOES.

    JACK reacts, startled, but before he can say or do anything, 
    he s distracted by:

                                ROSE (O.S.) (CONT D)
                  Doctor...?

    Jack looks at her.

                                ROSE (CONT D)
                  Are you coming?

    ...Then back to the Older Man.  WHO S NOW GONE.  Did he cross 
    behind the trees?

    OFF JACK, unnerved...


    BOONE emerges from a gathering of some agitated people, 
    verging on panic.  He approaches Shannon...

                                BOONE
                  Looks like the hunt didn t go well.  
                  That bald guy never came back--*

                    SHANNON*BOONE*
    Wait -- So they didn t bring *
    back any food at all?*-- Did you hear what I said?!   *
                                                Somebody may have died out  *
                                                there--*

                                SHANNON
                  We re all gonna be dead if somebody  *
                  doesn t--

                                CHARLIE (O.S.)
                  Here we are, luv...

    She turns to see Charlie, holding the fish Jin caught for 
    him.

                                CHARLIE (CONT D)
                As promised, you and me ll be 
                  dining on fresh catch of the day.  
                  Hope you don t mind alfresco.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  45.



                                SHANNON
                        (pleased)
                My fish!

    She grabs it from him.  Then, disgusted, hands it off to 
    Boone, as Charlie waxes on...

                                CHARLIE
                  Yeah.  Nothin  to it, was there?  
                  Like I said... I m a fishing fiend.  
                  This one gave me a hell of a 
                  tussle.  But I stuck with it... 
                  Y know, tired him out--

                                BOONE
                        (glaring at Shannon)
                I don t believe you --*

                                SHANNON
                  Awww, what s the matter?  Can t *
                  stand me fending for myself?

                                BOONE
                      (to Charlie)
                  Listen, hey, I m sorry about this--

                                CHARLIE
                        (uncomfortable)
                  Uh, no worries, mate.  We were--  I 
                  mean, I was just--

                    SHANNON*BOONE*
      (to Boone)*
    What are you apologizing to  For you -- Using this poor *-- *
    him for?*guy, just like you use *
  -- Oh, whatever.*everybody else -- *

                                BOONE 
                  And, somehow, in your twisted 
                  little brain, you think this proves 
                to me you can take care of 
                  yourself.

    Shannon tosses a look at Charlie then back to Boone.

                                SHANNON
                        (with a smirk)
                  Told you I could catch a fish, *
                  didn t I?

    Pow!  ON CHARLIE, humiliated, realizing he s been played, as 
  we hear them continue to argue.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  46.



                                BOONE (O.S.)
                  That s low, Shannon.  Even for you. *

                                SHANNON (O.S.)
                  Oh, go find a baby bird you can 
                  rescue or something...


    CLOSE ON the shattered remnants of the antenna as Kate passes 
    them into Sayid s cupped hands.

                                KATE*
                  I m sorry.*
                      (a bad joke and she knows *
                        it)*
                I should ve gotten the warrantee.*

                                SAYID*
                I suppose I ll just try again.*
                        (frustration building)*
                Of course, I have no welding iron,  *
                no rivets, scorched wiring... and *
                of course, I must continue to lie *
                to anyone who asks me what I m *
                  actually doing...*

                                KATE
                  Sayid --

  He looks at her and softens.

                                SAYID
                  Sorry.*
                        (forces a smile)*
                  I m cranky when I m hungry. *

                                KATE
                        (smiles back; then)*
                  We ll try it again.*

                                SAYID
                  We ll try it again.*

    They share a look, not unwarm.  And smile.  Then, with some 
    seriousness...

                                KATE
                  Really think it ll work?

                                SAYID
                        (determined)
                I will make it work.*




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  47.



                                JACK (O.S.)
                  Kate --

    She turns as Jack approaches them.

                                KATE
                  Hey --

                                SAYID
                  Excuse me...

    Sayid nods to Jack as he moves off.  Jack s attention goes to  *
    the SCRAPES on Kate s cheek --*

                                JACK*
                  You okay?*

  He touches the scratch gently, examining her injuries.   *
    Purely professional.  And yet...*

                                KATE*
                Is this where you say  I told you *
                  so? *

                                JACK
                  I m not big on rubbing it in.*

    Kate smiles.  They re CLOSE.  But then, a sober moment -- *

                                KATE*
                  Locke s gone.  That... thing... in  *
                  there.  I think it got him.

    Jack absorbs that for a moment.  Shakes his head.  Kate  *
    notices the CASTAWAYS beginning to gather near the fuselage -- *

                                KATE (CONT D)*
                  What s going on?*

                                JACK
                  The fuselage is ready to go.
                        (beat)
                  Some of the others decided to... I 
                  guess some words are gonna be 
                  said... over the fire... Names 
                  read, I think...

                                KATE*
                  That s good.  A little closure.

                                JACK
                        (distracted)
                  Yeah.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  48.



                                KATE
                I don t think they re ready to know *
                  what we --*

    She pauses, suddenly realizing Jack is looking past her at 
    something.

    HIS POV - The OLDER MAN in the white shoes, mostly obscured 
  by the foliage.  Kate sees Jack s expression:

                                KATE (CONT D)
                  What?

    But Jack is already moving past her, toward*

    The OLDER MAN who moves off deeper into the jungle.

    Jack s rushing to the edge of the jungle, Kate right behind 
    him.

                                KATE (CONT D)
                  Jack --

    He s about to dive in when...

  A LARGE FORM emerges from the brush.  Jack and Kate come to a 
    sudden halt and look upon...

    LOCKE, his brow and arms slightly bloodied, his arms slung 
    over a long stick across his shoulders, not unlike a 
    scarecrow.

                                JACK
                  Locke -- ?

    Locke suddenly heaves the stick off of him and we see a DEAD 
    BOAR, hog-tied to it.  The carcass hits the ground before 
    them.

    CLOSE ON LOCKE - His face flush with the kill, his chest 
    heaving...

                                                                CUT TO BLACK: *

                                    ACT FIVE


    CRANE SHOT - We see smoke and fiery embers rising up against 
    the night sky, then TILT DOWN onto

    THE BURNING FUSELAGE, and the CROWD of SURVIVORS standing 
    before it, some bowing their heads in prayer, others quietly  *
    crying -- all the while hearing Claire s voice:*

                                CLAIRE
                  Judith Martha Walker... Denton, 
                  Texas...  Guess she was gonna catch 
                a connecting flight...*
                        (studying the license)
                  Uh, well, she wore corrective 
                  lenses.  And... she was an organ 
                  donor...

    CUT IN ON CLAIRE, sniffling her way through these impromptu 
    eulogies - (occasionally popping in on others as they 
    listen.)  HURLEY stands next to her, holding various I.D.s, 
    documents and other items.  BOONE is also near, holding up a  *
    TORCH, giving her the light to read.  [NOTE: We may also see  *
  an iPod propped up on some luggage, along with two external  *
    speakers, as we hear an appropriate SONG playing.]*

                                CLAIRE (CONT D)
                Or would ve been...*

    She hands off the license to Hurley, who hands her the 
    wedding plans she found earlier.  She reacts...

                                CLAIRE (CONT D)
                  Oh... yeah.  Steve and Kristen.  I 
                  don t know their last names, but... 
                  They were in love... And they were 
                  going to be married--
                      (her voice breaks)
                At least... At least wherever they 
                  are now... they have each other... 
                  They re not alone...

    ARC around a tree as CLAIRE S faltering voice continues in 
    the background, to find

    CHARLIE, taking a hit from his bag of dope.  He closes his 
    eyes, letting the numbness wash over him, and shoves the bag 
    back into his pocket.  (There ain t much left.)*

  WE GO WITH HIM as he steps out from his hiding place and 
    rejoins the crowd, winding up next to KATE, near the back.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"         (PINK)         7/22/04     50.



    PANNING ACROSS the gathered, we see LOCKE, next to WALT and 
    MICHAEL, then SAYID, SHANNON, SAWYER, SUN and JIN, and, 
    finally, ROSE, her eyes closed, appearing almost serene.

                                CLAIRE (CONT D)
                  ...Manuel Raphael Ortiz... Los 
                  Angeles... He turned thirty-two... 
                  wow, just last week... And, well, 
                  looks like Diego didn t travel much 
                --  At least as far as we can tell 
                  from his passport...
                      (off piece of paper)
                  ... But, oh, he must ve had 
                  children...  A video store receipt  *
                in his wallet lists overdue 
                  charges... Willy Wonka and... The 
                  Little Princess...

  ON KATE, standing by CHARLIE.  She scans the assembled.

                                KATE
                        (whispering, to Charlie)
                  Have you seen Jack?

    Charlie looks around, but can only shrug.  Off Kate s 
    concerned look, as we hear Claire:

                                CLAIRE (O.S.)
                  So... I guess...
                        (becoming emotional)
                I expect they re missing their 
                  daddy right now...


  We see the fiery fuselage and congregated survivors way off 
  in the distance, then BOOM DOWN to find

    JACK, sitting alone, staring out over the ocean, far down the 
    beach where Rose had sat.  Lost in troubled thoughts.


  As we hear Claire reading on, we find

    MICHAEL - He glances over at Locke, who doesn t look back.  
    After a beat, they speak in whispers...

                                MICHAEL
                  Nice work.

                                LOCKE
                  What?




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  51.



                                MICHAEL
                  The boar.  Nice work.  Y know... 
                  Killing it.
                        (beat)
                  Just thought I should say 
                  something.

    Locke looks at him a moment, then nods, accepting Michael s 
    compliment, and returns to looking at the funeral pyre.  
    Another beat, then...

                                MICHAEL (CONT D)
                  So, that... Thing... The monster, 
                  whatever... She said it was heading 
                  right toward you...

    Locke now turns and looks directly into Michael s eyes.

                                MICHAEL (CONT D)
                  Did you see it?  I mean, did you 
                  get any kind of look at it?

  A moment passes before Locke shakes his head.

                                LOCKE
                  No.

    Michael stares back at Locke for a beat.  Then nods and turns 
    back to the service.  As does Locke.

    PUSH IN ON Locke s face - flames flickering in his eyes...


    LOCKE S TOES - Wiggling beneath their sock.

    ANGLE ON LOCKE staring dumbly at them, then, as before, he 
    retrieves his pristine shoe (understanding its clean because 
    HE S NEVER WALKED ON IT) -- and puts it on.






                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Walkabout"     (PRODUCTION DRAFT)     7/15/04  54.



    Once he does, he looks up to the sky, almost serenely... As 
  if an understanding s been reached.

    Locke braces himself on a large, nearby, piece of wreckage, 
    and carefully pulls himself up to his feet.  He takes stock 
  of his legs, gently rubbing them -- They appear steady, and 
  he wills them to take... one... two... three... tentative 
    steps.  Then a couple more confident ones.

    CLOSE ON LOCKE - Turning back to the scene of carnage -- His 
    face flush with this  miracle  as he puts his hand on his 
    hips and watches --

    CUT IN TO COVERAGE FROM THE PILOT - Shannon screaming, Jin 
    calling out, Michael looking for Walt, etc., and we HEAR 
    Jack s voice, yelling over the whine of the jet engine...

                                JACK (O.S.)
                -- get over here -- gimme a hand --

  ON LOCKE, glancing over at

    JACK, who turns and sees him:

                                JACK (CONT D)
                  You!  C mon... Come over here!  
                  Gimme a hand! --

    TIGHT CLOSE-UP ON LOCKE, looking over at Jack.*

                                                                FLASH CUT TO:


  ON LOCKE - His eyes drift over to something past the crowd. *

    HIS POV - THE WHEELCHAIR, a short distance from the burning  *
    fuselage, resting idle and empty.*

    CLOSE ON LOCKE, as a small smile curls the corner of his  *
    lips.


                                  END OF SHOW
