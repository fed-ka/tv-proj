                                URSULA
                  What - what is it, Tom?

                                TOM
                  Bad news. Very bad news.

                I know you re not from around here. 
                  You must have the guide book upside 
                  down. We re human, not cattle. 

                                                                          nt.

                I am Ursula, of the Magical Line of 
                  Crowe, and I will smite thee with 
                  Magic. 

                                                                          King -

  And the Nekross King licks his lips. And laughs.

    Furious, Ursula swings the cane towards Varg!

  FX SHOT: The Magic slows before it hits Varg and is gently 
    absorbed.

                  Earth Magic tastes good!

                                URSULA
                  No!

  And she turns on Lexi.

                                TOM
                  Gran! No! That s your third spell!

  FX SHOT: Ursula fires at Lexi.

  FX SHOT: Again the Magic slows and is gently absorbed by 
  Lexi.

                                LEXI
                  Again, wizard! Feed me again!

                                TOM
                  They re feeding on it! They re 
                  feeding on Magic!

                                URSULA
                  Then we re powerless. Magic is all 
                  we ve got. We re defenceless!

  Tom comforts her. Despite his own misgivings.

                                TOM
                  It s all right, Gran. You re with 
                  me. I ll look after you.

                                NEKROSS KING
                  Your Magic is strong, old woman. 
                  And it makes us stronger.

                  We have travelled the cosmos for

                  Feeding on wizards?

                  Every star in the sky where there 
                  was once Magic, now burns dimmer. 

                                NEKROSS KING
                We have fed on it all. 

                                URSULA
                  You mean there s no Magic left? Not 
                  anywhere in the universe?

                                NEKROSS KING
                  Only on Earth. And now we shall 
                  feast on that.

                                TOM
                  No. Feast on this!

  Tom does a drop-kick with his ball - straight at the King. 

                                TOM (CONT D)
                  Run, Gran!

  The ball hits the King- he bellows indignantly as the Nekross 
    rush to his aid.  

                                LEXI

    Alarms blare and lights flash as Tom and Ursula make their 
    escape.

    almost completely hidden, the crescent of distant Earth.

  Tom pulls the lever that Lexi used. 

  The PRAC transporter LIGHT BEAM activates.

                  This is all a bit too much for me.

  And steps between the Nekross and her grandson, letting go of 
  his hand just as Tom steps into the light beam.

  Lexi pushes her into a cell. Frightened, Ursula sees them go. 
  A movement in the darkness in the cell opposite startles her.

                                URSULA (CONT D)
                  Who s there?

    ROBERT emerges from the shadows. 

                                 ROBERT
                  Blessed be the Source.

                                URSULA
                  Blessed be the Source. You re a 
                  wizard, too?

                                ROBERT
                  For now. Until they drain every 
                  drop of Magic out of me. And half 
                my life with it. 

    Robert can barely control his emotion.

                                ROBERT (CONT D)
                  Look what they did to my son.

  And ROBERT is joined by his son, now OLD MARK. 

                                URSULA
                  Your  son ? I don t understand.

  Old Mark (and he looks much, much older than Ursula) regards 
  her with rheumy eyes, his face pinched and wrinkled.

                                OLD MARK
                  I m only twelve.

    Robert puts an arm around his son. 

                                ROBERT
                  Help us.

    Ursula is heartbroken.

                                URSULA
                I - I - can t. I m sorry. I m so 
                  sorry. There s nothing I can do.

    INT. CLARKE HOUSE. LOBBY - DAY 299

  TOM comes through the door in a hurry, BENNY behind him.

                                TOM
                  You don t tell anyone. Understand? 
                  Not about the aliens. Not about the 
                  Magic.

                                BENNY
                  What would aliens with the 
                  technology to travel light years 
                  want with magic? 

                                TOM
                  They feed on it.

    Benny absorbs for a second.

                                BENNY
                  Yeah. That makes sense.

                                TOM
                It does?

                                BENNY
                  Whatever you call  Magic , it s an 
                  energy. Organisms live on energy, 
                  whether they get it from food, like 
                  us, or the sun, like plants. You 
                  see - science. It s clever. 

                                TOM
                  Yeah, and so is Magic.

  Tom takes out the Ring of Healing.

                                TOM (CONT D)
                  Some wizard lost this when the 
                  Nekross took him. It s enchanted 
                  with his Magic. So there s a 
                  connection, like an invisible cord.

                                BENNY
                Or a phone line! If he s on the 
                  Nekross ship, you can use it to 
                  trace him - and your Gran. 

                                TOM
                  And to get me back on their ship.

                                BENNY
                So you know how to do that?

                                TOM
                  No. But I can find out. In there.

  He nods towards the toilet door. Benny checks - it s a loo.

                                BENNY
                  The toilet?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)

  Tom smiles and closes the toilet door. Enjoying the moment. 
  Tom knocks on the door twice.

                                TOM
                  Chamber of Crowe open to me, reveal 
                  yourself on the knock of three.

  Tom raps on the door again. The door and opens by itself -

  A long passageway of ancient stone leads off, cobwebs 
    everywhere, lit by ancient flaming torches.

                                BENNY
                  Narnia. Tim Burton style.

  And somewhere in there - the cry of the lizard-bird.

                                BENNY (CONT D)
                  What was that?

                                TOM
                No idea. And by the way, I m not 
                  supposed to do this.

  And they step into the passageway.

                                                                          CUT TO:


  INT. CHAMBER. PASSAGEWAY - DAY 21010

  TOM moves cautiously along the passageway, BENNY behind him. 
  Tom is taking it all in with almost as much wonder as Benny.

                                BENNY
                So where are we then, apart from 
                  some sort of parallel dimension? 

                                TOM
                  It s not a parallel dimension, it s 
                a Threshold of Enchantment.

                                BENNY
                  Look, we walked into the loo, only 
                I don t see any toilet brush. So 
                  this is a parallel dimension. 

                                TOM
                  It s Magic. Does your toilet vanish 
                  when you knock on the door and say 
                an enchantment?

                                BENNY
                  Look, once people thought fire was 
                  magic and the moon was magic. 
                  Whatever you  wizards  do will have 
                a scientific explanation.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                TOM
                  Yeah. And once you  scientists  
                  thought the world was flat and the 
                  sun revolved around the Earth. Got 
                  those wrong big time, didn t you? 
                  Well maybe Magic is going to be 
                  another big surprise.

  Benny takes that like a slap. 

                                BENNY
                So where are we going, anyway?

                                TOM
                  Gran s Chamber of Mysteries. It s 
                  been in her family centuries. It s 
                an enchanted place that follows the 
                  oldest member of the blood line. 
                  There are spells there that go back 
                to the dawn of time.

    Behind them - the lizard bird cries again, louder, as the 
  boys turn a corner and -

                                                                          CUT TO:


  INT. THE CHAMBER OF MYSTERIES - CONTINUOUS - DAY 21111

  - TOM and BENNY enter the Chamber.

  The lizard-bird cry fades behind them. And the two boys take 
  in the Chamber with wonder.

                                BENNY
                Oh boy!

  A wonderful place. Darkly mysterious, lit with dozens of fat, 
    eternally burning candles and ancient oil lamps, the place 
    twinkles like Christmas Eve. Wonderful, yet strange.

  They take it in with wonder. It s a cave. And yet, over the 
    centuries it s become almost homely. Undisciplined, chaotic, 
  like a junkyard of Magic. It has shelves of untidily stacked 
    ancient books, a huge table littered with alchemic apparatus, 
  there are crystal balls, an elaborately decorated skull, 
    charms and talismans and amulets...

  The boys look around them -

                                TOM
                I always wanted to see this place, 
                  but I never thought it would be 
                  this... awesome.

                  Got to admit, it s pretty cool. So 
                  how come you ve never been here?

                                TOM
                  Dad says I m not responsible. Well, 
                  I m responsible for leaving my Gran 
                on that spaceship. So here I am. 

  As Tom finds a photograph of his mum. 

                                BENNY
                  Who s that?

                                TOM
                My mum. She died.

                                BENNY
                  Sorry.

                                TOM
                  Yeah. Sometimes Magic isn t all 
                  it s cracked up to be.

  He puts the photograph aside and discovers a huge volume on 
  the table - esoteric symbols; heavy iron clasps.

                                BENNY
                  Let me guess - a book of spells.

                                TOM
                  It s the Wisdom of Crowe. If 
                  there s a way to link the ring and 
                  the wizard that enchanted it, the 
                  spell will be in here.

  Tom hesitates -

                                BENNY
                So what s the problem?

                                TOM
                I told you, I m not supposed to be 
                  here. I m a wizard, but I m not 
                  trained. 

                                BENNY
                  It s just a book. Open it.

  And Tom opens the book.

  The pages flutter. The candles and oil lamps flicker. And 
    suddenly the place is plunged into an eerie twilight, lit 
  only by the cave s natural phosphorescence.

                                BENNY (CONT D)
                  Anyone got a match?

                                                                          (CONTINUED)

                                MOON
                  I ll be thinking I have. Somewhere. 

  And the chamber is ablaze with light again - every candle and 
  oil lamp lights up, like someone flicked a switch.

    Sitting on a corner of the table - a HOBGOBLIN - RANDAL MOON. 
  Odd. But friendly-looking.

  PRAC EFFECT: The tip of one finger burns like a match.

                                BENNY

                  Guardian of the Chamber.

  He blows out the burning finger.

  Tom glances at Benny. Tries not to look quite so freaked. 

                                TOM
                  Pleased to meet you, Randal Moon.

  He covers his face with his hands. The boys exchange a look.

  Moon lunges at Benny. SNARLING.

  Tom leaps forward.

  INT. NEKROSS SHIP. DETENTION CELL - DAY 21212

                  Helen. But I m not her. I never

  TOM is searching shelves carved into the cavern full of pots 
  and jars of weird magical things. As MOON guides urgently...

                                MOON
                  Phoenix Ash. Third jar along.

  Tom grabs the jar -

                                TOM
                  Are you sure this spell will work? 
                  It ll get us on the alien ship?

  Moon turns to BENNY - feeding a cauldron with broken twigs.

                                MOON
                  Steady with the wisher-wood, young 
                  imp. I ll be wanting to open a

                  Will it work? By the jaws of a 
                  Jabbermaul, of course it will work. 

  Tom gives Moon the Phoenix Ash pot and he unscrews...

                                BENNY
                        (quiet, to Tom)
                  What exactly is he?

                                TOM
                A goblin. I think.

  Moon indicates his big pointed ears.

                                MOON
                  These won t be for decoration. I ll 
                be a hobgoblin. Hob! Hob! Hob! Not 
                  like a goblin. They ll be ugly. And 
                  bad, not like Randal Moon. By the 
                  fangs of Bashtarr the Bold, he ll 
                be saving the Mistress Crowe! 

  Tom looks at Benny, unsure of Moon.

                                TOM
                I hope so.

                  Hello! Tom? Have you been calling 
                  me?

  He sees the toilet door - and the passageway beyond.

                        (something is wrong)

    Michael steels himself. And goes into the passageway.

  PRAC smoke curls around Tom and Benny.

                                BENNY
                  So, this is a matter transporter?

                                BENNY
                  Something that transports matter.

                  It s not a matter transporter, it s 
                a Passing Charm.

                                BENNY
                No it s a matter transporter.

                                TOM
                  All right, so if you re so clever 
                  can you build a matter transporter?

                                BENNY
                  No. Science isn t that advanced.

                                TOM
                So this is Magic. It s a Passing 
                  Charm.

                                MOON
                  Ssshhh! The charm will be working.

                  This better not be a one-way trip.

                  You! What have you done now? Where 
                  has my son gone?

    Moon s eyes are huge with fright - he grabs an egg-like stone 
  from the table and holds it like he s going to hurl it.

                                MOON
                  Please! No, Michael of the

                I thought being a wizard was so 
                  cool. Like, a laugh. I could score 
                an impossible goal or, if I forgot 
                to do my homework, I could get it 
                  finished with a click of my 
                  fingers. My Dad tried to tell me it 
                  was more than that. That I needed 
                to take it seriously. But I never 
                  listened. And now look at us.

                                BENNY
                  Yeah. Back here, and I m stuck with 
                  you. Again.

  Tom looks at Benny. Manages half a smile.

                  And Magic and aliens - it s all

                  Looks like we both learned 
                  something today.

  And it s a moment of bonding.

  VARG, LEXI and the GUARDS reach the door to the arrival

                                VARG
                  Wizards! I have no taste for your 
                  Magic now!

                I will burn you to cinders!

    Michael holds Tom and Ursula. The situation is hopeless.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                  They re going to get in.

                                ROBERT
                  We re trapped.

  OLD MARK hugs ROBERT tightly. 

                                OLD MARK
                  Dad, I m frightened.

                                BENNY
                  There must be something we can do.

                                TOM
                  Not without Magic. I m sorry, 
                  Benny. But I told you not to come.

  The Nekross are cutting through the door. 

    Michael s eyes are stinging with tears.

                                MICHAEL
                  You came back for your Gran. Your 
                  mum would ve been proud of you, 
                  Tom. And so am I.

    Ursula kisses Tom s cheek, looks him in the eye.

                                URSULA
                  There was one last warrior wizard 
                of the Crowe bloodline, after all.  

                                TOM
                It wasn t enough. I m sorry. 

  And a tiny sliver of sunlight falls across Benny s face. 

  And he looks. Realization on his face. New hope.

                                BENNY
                  Look!

                                TOM
                  It s no good, Benny. There s 
                  nothing we can do.

  But there s more sunlight spreading across Benny s face.

                                BENNY
                  Shut up, and look - the Sun!

  And as one, they all turn and look at the window.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)

                  Kids. Where do they learn all this

    Smiling sadly, he puts his arm around his ancient son. The 
    others watch, touched. As Tom digs out the Ring of Healing.

                                TOM
                  Maybe this will help.
