      Fiona, in the mirror of the one cramped bathroom. T-shirt, 
      underwear, no make-up. She runs a quick brush through her 
      hair, stares at herself in the mirror, not great, but it s 
      gonna have to do. Shoves her way out into the narrow hall --

      BANGS on a door covered with Machine Head and Seether 
      posters, shoves it open to REVEAL her three sleeping brothers 
      packed into a room the size of a large closet --

                                  FIONA
                    7:15 monkeys!

      Doesn t wait for a response, but the boys are stirring. On to 
      the next door, this one covered in Zac Efron and Jonas 
      Brothers. BANGS again, pushes it open to REVEAL --

      Debbie, already up and dressed, pulling Liam from the crib 
      that butts up against Debbie s small bed and neat, tidy desk. 

                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                    7:15!

      On to the next door, doesn t bother to knock, it s her room, 
      the smallest yet, barely big enough for her bed. No closet, 
      only an overflowing, makeshift clothes rack. Wiggles into 
      jeans, digs around on the floor for boots as we -- 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Fiona puts king-size Costco boxes of Kix and Corn Flakes on 
      the table, a stack of bowls, a fistful of spoons. Moves to 
      the fridge for the milk as she checks the calendar on the 
      door -- it s covered in notes and reminders of what needs 
      doing, chores, school events, bills. Her finger finds today 
      and a scrawled  Electric  emphatically underlined.

                                  FIONA
                    Shit...

      Puts the milk carton on the table as Lip wanders in, half-
      asleep. Pulls a small box out of a cupboard, grabs a bill off 
      the fridge and tosses it in the box along with some money. 

      Deftly retrieves the nearly empty milk carton from Lip before 
      he can pour it on his cereal, drops the box in front of him.

                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                      Electric...

      She heads for the sink fills the plastic milk carton with 
      water from the tap as Ian wanders in, takes his seat next to 
      Lip. Lip drops cash into the box, passes it on to Ian.

                                  LIP
                      Electric...

      Carl appears sleepily as Fiona plops the now nearly full 
      carton of watered-down milk back onto the table. Lip takes it 
      without missing a beat, pours it on his cereal, hands the 
      milk to Ian, as Ian hands the box to Carl.

      Carl stares at the box as Debbie arrives, Liam on her hip. 
      Debbie straps Liam into a beat-up highchair and heads for the 
      coffee on the counter, pouring herself a big mug. Carl hands 
      Debbie the box without having put anything in.

                                  CARL
                      Electric...

      Debbie studies the bill, checks the money in the box, pulls a 
      few carefully folded dollars from her small purse. Fiona 
      moves to Carl, a quick perusal of his Foo Fighters T-shirt --  

                                  FIONA
                    No.

      She snaps her fingers at him, motions for the shirt.

                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                    You ve got a Happy Meal on the 
                    front of that shirt.

      Food stains. Carl pulls it off reluctantly as Ian pulls a 
      slip of paper from his pocket.

                                  IAN
                    Field trip, I need Dad s signature.

      Debbie takes it. The boys are shoving cereal into their 
      mouths as if it s their last meal. Fiona turns Carl s dirty T-
      shirt inside out.

                                  FIONA
                    Arms up...

      Slips the now inside-out T-shirt back onto Carl as Debbie 
      pushes the permission slip back to Ian, signed. Lip notices 
      the signature as it passes, is impressed. 

                                  LIP
                    That s really getting good...

                                  DEBBIE
                    I need something for show and tell.

                    I ve got some spunky boxer shorts 
                    in my room.

      Fiona WHACKS Ian on the back of the head, throws a load into 
      the washer, tosses in detergent, then inexplicably jams a 
      chair under the washer door handle and starts the machine.

                                  FIONA
                    How much are we short?

      She means the box. Debbie s already figured it out.

                    A real job, not just dipping into 
                    the collection plate at St. Tim s.

      Fiona gathers up the cereal, milk. It s almost time to go.

      The boys stand, head for the sink with their bowls, pulling

                    I m working after school.

      Fiona looks to Carl, he stares back blankly. That isn t going 
      to work. A frustrated Debbie s the last one standing. 

                                  DEBBIE
                    Show and tell?

      Fiona thinks, then reaches across, pulls Liam from the 
      highchair, STICKS him in Debbie s arms.

      Fiona walks briskly along the concourse of the White Sox s 
      home field passing legions of fans filing in, makes her way 
      to an All Star Stand - beer, nachos, and of course, hot dogs. 
      Swings under the counter, smiles at one of the women already 
      working as she grabs an apron and Sox cap from the rack.

      Fiona steps up to the counter, smiles at a customer. A middle-

      We start on Lip s white tube socks, shoes in a plastic A&P 
      bag hanging on the back of his chair next to his backpack. 
      He s seated at a small dining room table drawing a diagram. 
      KAREN sits opposite. Sheila in the attached kitchen. Karen 
      whispers to Lip.

      The whole room is invested with clown-motif objects - 
      tablemats, clocks, ornaments - clowns everywhere. Karen 
      studies Lip as he confidently completes a mnemonic diagram.

                    she's crying 'cuz she's lost one 
                    ear and she can't find it.

      It's a tiny 'm' with a big 'V' in it's own box to denote 
      'squared'. He's clever. She looks grateful.

                    Just something I like to fool

      He starts another diagram. He loves this, the science but 
      showing-off for her too. She s smitten, physics excites her.

      A beat. Considers it for a moment, then:

                                  LIP
                    Okay.

      She vanishes under the table cloth again. He fidgets in fits 
      of bliss, keeping an eye on her mom's whereabouts.

      SHEILA IN THE KITCHEN, obliviously, ritually following 
        instructions from Rachel Ray on the counter-top TV.

      Lip stifles squeaks and grunts as he heads towards orgasm.

                                  FIONA
                    You re like chimps, you three!

                                  VERONICA
                    Fiona!  

      Veronica appears in the doorway. She looks great, short 
      skirt, boots, low-cut blouse -- way too small, of course.

                                  VERONICA (CONT'D)
                    We need to go if we're gonna get a 
                    ride to the club.

                                  FIONA
                    Five minutes.

      Lip deftly retrieves his spunky undies, only seconds before 
      Fiona turns back to reclaim the laundry sack. Veronica spies 
      the price tag still hanging off the back of Fiona s dress. 
      Goes to yank it off.

                                  FIONA (CONT D)
                    No...This has to go back tomorrow.

      Veronica tears it off anyway.

                                  VERONICA
                    I have a tag gun, we can put it 
                    back on later.
                          (a tag gun?)
                    From when I worked at TJMaxx.

                                  FIONA
                          (to Lip)
                    Hot dogs downstairs. Nachos too.

      And they re gone. Lip sags with relief. Scouts the room for a 
      hiding place for the undies - then shoves the shorts behind 
      the dresser. But dislodges something that drops to the floor. 
      He curses, fishes under the dresser to retrieve -- a study 
      folder, decorated with an (obviously) teenage male's collage 
      of Fergie's butt, Keira Knightly, pouting, etc. Somebody's 
      secret porn stash? One of his brothers' secret cache of...

      Lip's face freezes as he unveils the contents -- naked 
      cowboys kissing?! Each OTHER?! Then cops! Sailors! -- plus 
      every other staple fantasy of your gay porn stash. He barely 
      has time to cope with the horror of it all, before...

      Footsteps coming upstairs.  Lip panics, conceals the study 
      folder behind his back. Then - PING! -- in bolts his brother, 
      Ian - a year younger, less 'worldy' than Lip... or so Lip had 
      always thought... until he's suddenly watching Ian hurriedly 
      strip out of school clothes, (shirt, shoes), into sneakers 
      and a ratty, favorite T-shirt.

                                  IAN
                    Hey...

                                  LIP
                    Hey...

      As Ian stretches his arms through the sleeves, Lip, across 
      the room, is suddenly framing the guy against the huge 
      posters over Ian's bed - a horny Fergie poster and a Marine 
      recruiting poster, three incredibly handsome Marines in dress 
      blues with shiny phallic sabers, rigidly at attention.


      Lip's shock.  His brother's GAY?!!!

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Fiona, revelling in the heat and chaos, having a fantastic 
      time dancing with her friends.

      STEVE, a young guy (23), standing on the balcony above, 
      looking down at her. He's conspicuous in these surroundings 
      because he's alone. All around him, groups of friends are 
      making the most of it. He's just a silent observer. Not 
      lonely, not unhappy. Just one of those guys who can look 
      happy in his own company.

      His eyes focus on a GIRL dancing next to Fiona. Red hair, big 
      tits, obvious. Then watches Fiona herself, who doesn't see 
      him. Her eyes are anywhere but on Steve. She's actually 
      eyeballing a cruising SUITOR, who's dancing closer and closer 
      to her. The Suitor approaches, is now dancing with her.

      ANGLE - Steve smiling nevertheless. Then something goes 
      wrong. We hear an almighty YELL. Fiona's yell  --

                                  FIONA
                    Hey!

      Steve sees Fiona hit the deck, on her ass. Her 'suitor' is 
      actually a thief who does this often - swoons a girl with his 
      dancing eyes, then takes off with her purse. Which is where 
      we see the last of the guy - bolting towards a fire exit, 
      where an associate waits to jam the door open for him.

                                  FIONA (CONT'D)
                    My purse! Bastard has my purse!!

      Steve reacts like a true film hero. Spectacular dive across 
      the dance floor, skids on his belly, misses the thief by an 
      inch and ploughs into a table of drinks. This stuns onlookers 
      for all the wrong reasons - how CRAPPY was that!?


      Ian and Lip tucked in adjacent beds for the night. Lip is 
      quietly struggling with a task he's dreading to complete. But 
      he knows Ian's not quite asleep yet, so --

                                  LIP
                    I got a hummer today.

      Ian spools back that statement, hinges up on one arm, smiles 
      with amusement at this bullshit.

                                  IAN
                    What's the law on sex with pets?

                                  LIP
                    From Karen Jackson.

                                  IAN
                    No way!

                                  LIP
                    She got a C in Physics.  Needs a B.

      Lip slips out of bed and swaggers to the dresser by the 
      window to get away from the sleeping Carl in the bed closest 
      to the door. Carl's growling sinusitis and the soundproof 
      earplugs he wears as a routine, have protected him from 
      dozens of conversations this revealing. It's Carl's choice - 
      eavesdropping on the real world is a hobby he tends to avoid. 

      Ian joins Lip at the window, starts rolling a joint, studying 
      Lip to gauge the truth.

                                  IAN
                    You wouldn't have waited this long 
                    to tell me.

                                  LIP 
                    Five hours?

                                  IAN
                    You re full of shit.

      Lip shrugs a 'couldn't care less'. Strategic pause.

                                  LIP
                    You ever had a knob-job?

                                  IAN
                          (can't help a chuckle)
                    Once or twice...

                                  LIP
                    Didn't hear you rushing to tell me.

      Ian shoots a tantalizing grin.  His secret.

                                  LIP (CONT'D)
                    If we tell each other everything...

      Only now does Ian realize he's been expertly ambushed by this 
      conversation.  Lip stares hard.

                                  LIP (CONT'D)
                    'less you got it sucked by a guy?
                          (malevolent smile)
                    ...for instance?

      Ian is suddenly over-exposed. Lip reaches behind the dresser 
      for the porn, throws it to Ian. They hold a stare, until Ian 
      shrinks back to his bed, tucks the porn pointlessly under his 
      mattress. Tries crying quietly, but squeaks muffled distress.

      Lip pans the room back to their third male sibling, Carl, to 
      make sure he s still sound asleep in his bed.

      Lip envies Carl's ignorance. UNTIL... raucous noise from 
      downstairs, voice, cackling, music --


      Music pumping out at indecent volume from the stereo. Fiona 
      comes from the kitchen with a bowl of hot water.


                                  FIONA
                    No kidding, Steve. You're dead if 
                    he ever lays eyes on you. And I 
                      mean...DEAD.

      Veronica handles a sterile trauma kit used in ERs - swabs, 
      tweezers, saline, removes bits of glass from Steve's scalp.

                                  VERONICA
                    I nearly peed myself when you hit 
                    him... well I did a little.

      She and Fiona laugh hysterically at this indiscretion. Steve 
      adjusts as Gallagher kids start appearing from upstairs - 
      Debbie, then Lip, then Carl. All here to investigate the din.

                                  STEVE
                    How many of you live here?!

                                  VERONICA
                    Not me, I'm one-down. But the old 
                    guy next door died in March, which 
                    I guess technically makes us next 
                    door neighbors.

                                  CARL
                          (droll)
                    Died March, found August.

      Steve grimaces at the image, which somehow leads him to --

                                  STEVE

                                  LIP
                    She worked in housekeeping at Cook 
                    County. Bedpans and shit sheets.

                                  VERONICA
                    Fine! But I was offered a place in 
                    the Nursing School.

                                  FIONA
                    Fine, but it never happened.
                          (to Steve)
                    They fired her for selling medical 
                    supplies on eBay.

                                  VERONICA
                    Will you shut up! We don't even 
                    know him.
                          (to Steve)
                    Sit still.

                                  STEVE
                    I will. If you quit sticking your 
                    tits in my back.

      Veronica jabs him with tweezers. Steve does a cartoon yelp, 
      making the kids laugh. Steve turns to Carl.

                                  STEVE (CONT'D)
                    Steve, by the way.

                                  CARL
                    Carl.

                    Lip.

      Debbie's too shy.

                    Debbie.

      Ian slides into the room, pointedly avoiding Lip's gaze.


                                  FIONA
                    Plus Ian.

      Ian nods, subdued.

                                  STEVE
                    Hey Debbie, why do they call him 
                    Lip?

      Debbie doesn t respond, so Lip does.

                                  LIP
                    A) You smell like a drunk. B) 
                    You're not as funny as you think 
                    you are, and C) you decked a

                    which is probably why - D) I've

                                  STEVE

                    His real name's Phillip.

      A GUST OF COLD AIR as Kev (Veronica's husband) arrives from

                    his Pops still breathin'!

                                  STEVE
                    His own father?

                                  KEV
                          (cackling)
                    Five YEARS, over an '87 Chrysler 
                    with two-hundred thousand miles on 
                    the dash! Fuckin' CHRYSLER! 
 
                          (cackles again)
                    Re - SPECT!

      Steve's blood pressure is sliding at his prospects as Fiona 
      claps efficiently toward the kids.

                                  FIONA
                    Okay, come on guys, time for bed! 
                    Up the wooden hill.


      Veronica starts collecting her medical supplies as the 
      Gallagher kids peel off for the stairs.

                                                                            CUT TO:






























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































                                                                                    21.




      Steve alone, checking handwritten messages on scraps of paper 
      stuck to the fridge door: 'Lip, DENTIST Monday!' 'Debbie, 
      bring your jacket home from school'. Plus stuff like:'Who's 
      eating all the Frosted Flakes?' 'Not me!' 'Yes you are Ian'  
      'Fuck off, Debbie' 'Quit swearing!' 'She started it!' etc. 

      On the table are several carry-out trays of still wrapped hot 
      dogs from the ballpark and a few mostly eaten piles of 
      congealing nachos. Fiona arrives from upstairs.

                                  STEVE
                    All quiet up the 'wooden hill?'

                                  FIONA
                    As quiet as it ever gets.

      She's more self-conscious now it's just the two of them. 
      Starts cleaning up the hot dog mess, which looks incongruous 
      in her nightclub outfit. Steve watches her.

                                  STEVE
                    Straight answer -- if I hadn't 
                    busted my skull for you, would you 
                    have looked at me twice?

                                  FIONA
                    Who's saying I looked twice?

      He shrugs this off with a grin. She looks back.

                                  STEVE
                    You did then!

      He catches her passing him. Goes in for a kiss. She lets him. 
      His hands roam under her blouse. She likes it.  

                                  FIONA
                          (off the window)
                    We can't.

      He reaches for the lightswitch, turns it off. She chuckles at 
      his decisiveness, so Steve knows he's not way off-base here.

                                  STEVE
                    Ninety percent of the world's 
                    problems are caused by tiny words 
                    that come in pairs.

      Opens his belt. Starts undoing his jeans. One button.

                                  STEVE (CONT'D)
                    We're healthy and happy but when 
                    anybody asks, we say 'not bad'.

      Two buttons.

                                  STEVE (CONT'D)
                    When I saw you dancing the first 
                    time - about a month back at the 
                    Hard Rock - I was desperate to buy 
                    you a drink. Normally, I'm shy, so 
                    I told myself 'I can't'.


      Three buttons.

                                  STEVE (CONT'D)
                    'She wouldn't', 'We won't'. Then 
                    tonight, you're there again. All 
                    the indications being that I'm 
                    getting a second chance to make a 
                    good impression. 
                          (the last button)
                    Say 'stop', I'll stop.

      Moves slowly in. She glances back to check they can't be seen 
      from the window. Then returns the kiss. Gently, gently... 
      then ferociously. He s amused, whispers --

                                  STEVE (CONT'D)
                    Slower.

      She tries.

                                  STEVE (CONT'D)
                    Slower.

      She calms down.  They kiss more tenderly as we HARD CUT TO:


      Steve and Fiona in half-removed clothing, screwing on the 
      kitchen floor like famished wildlife. She's steering the show 
      - unwittingly slamming his head against the kitchen cupboards 
      as she lurches to orgasm. Steve see-saws between the pleasure 
      of the sex and the pain of head injury as he also nears...

                                  FIONA
                    Almost. Almost. Almo...

      LOUD KNOCK on the kitchen door. They freeze.

                                  FIONA (CONT'D)
                    Shit!

      Another KNOCK, louder.  They scramble for clothes. She bolts 
      out of the kitchen, leaving Steve to untangle his jeans.

                                  STEVE
                    Fuck! 
 

      Steve kicks socks, underwear and debris into a corner. Flicks 
      the lights on before opening the door to a young neighborhood 
      Chicago cop, TONY. Tony instantly spots Steve's bare feet.

                                  TONY
                          (curt)
                    Is Fiona in?

                                  STEVE
                      She's...upstairs. I'll...get her.


      Steve bombs up the stairs as Fiona appears from a bedroom, 
      looking vaguely decent.

                                  STEVE
                    Cops. Looking for you.


      She's more embarrassed than disturbed by this. Brushes past 
      him to the stairs.

                                  FIONA
                    Stay here.

      Steve flounders for a sec or two.  Then spots young Liam 
      emerging from a bedroom.  Debbie behind him in pursuit.

                                  DEBBIE
                    Liam! Back to bed or I m showing 
                    you The Hills Have Eyes again.

      Liam yells fearfully, obeys. Steve stares at the disappearing 
      kid, tries deciphering the voices from downstairs.


      Tony and his partner COP struggle to heave the dead weight of 
      a paralytic middle-aged drunk (Frank, unconscious) through 
      the Gallagher s door as Steve comes back down the stairs.

      Fiona s holding the door wide as the cops dump Frank in the 
      middle of floor. They efficiently turn him into recovery 
      position as they must have done a hundred times before.

                                  TONY
                      I wouldn't put him anywhere near a 
                    carpet til his pants dry a bit.

                                  FIONA
                    Thanks, Tony.  

                                  TONY
                    See ya, Fiona.

      Tony throws one final, wary, glance to Steve and off he goes, 
      as if from a casual event. Fiona turns to see Steve's shock.

                                  STEVE
                    Who the fuck s THAT? 
 

      By now, Fiona's way beyond apology - not to a stranger.

                                  FIONA
                    My dad.


      Fiona s stuffing Steve's blood-stained shirt into a plastic 
      grocery bag. Steve comes in, pulling his shoes and socks on.

                                  STEVE
                    You leave him there all night?

                                  FIONA

                    He's never there when I get up.

                                  STEVE
                    Right.
                          (pause, of upstairs)
                    So who's the little guy? 'Liam'?

      Inference being - is he hers? She resents the question.

                                  FIONA
                    Liam's my brother.

      She hands him the bag. He takes the cue to leave.


      Fiona climbs the metal stairs of a clean but inexpensive, two-
      story motel, Liam on her hip. Finds a maid s cart parked 
      outside an open door, KNOCKS. 

                                  FIONA
                    Rita?

      A Hispanic woman appears from the bathroom, yellow Playtex 
      gloves, toilet brush in hand, thirty, harried.

                                  RITA
                    Anne s school called, she s sick.

      She s peeling off the gloves, handing the brush to Fiona. 

                                  RITA (CONT D)
                      Everything up to 204 s clean. I 
                    should be back in a couple hours. 

                                  FIONA
                    Raul won t care?

                                  RITA
                    Smoked his lunch again. He won t 
                    even know.

      Rita grabs her jacket off the maid s cart, pulls it on.

                                  RITA (CONT D)
                    Thanks for this. I m making tamales 
                    tonight, I ll drop off a dozen. 
                          (already out the door)
                    Oh, and take all the toilet paper 
                    and soap you need.

      And she s gone. Fiona looks into the room, sighs, plops Liam 
      down on the bed. Turns on the TV for him to watch. As she 
      pulls on the yellow gloves and starts for the bathroom, we --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      A neighborhood joint, small kitchen in the back, a pool 
      table, lots of local sports memorabilia on the walls. A small 
      crowd is gathered around a battered arcade game (X-Men? 
      Terminator?), a man focused on the controls. Every so often, 
      a YELL goes up and the excitement builds. A regular, TOMMY, 
      saunters over to the bar where Kev, for his sins, is the 
      regular barman.

                                  TOMMY
                    Worried?

                    Level 9.

                                  KEV
                    He won t get past the beast master.

      Another rowdy YELL goes up. Kev sneaks an anxious look.

                                  TOMMY
                    How long s your record held?

                                  KEV
                    Four and a half years.

                                  TOMMY
                    Well, that s something...

      Another yell, it s clear the guy s getting close.

                                  TOMMY (CONT D)
                    I could sneak out back, flip the 
                    breaker, say it s a power outage.

                                  KEV
                          (considers it, then)
                    Nah...

      A huge GROAN from the crowd, the guy throws his hands up in 
      frustration and defeat. The crowd begins to disperse.

                                  TOMMY
                    The beast master?

                                  KEV
                          (grins)
                    Yep.

      Frank enters, heads for the bar, in a magnanimous mood.

                                  FRANK
                    Schlitz and a Makers. And...
                          (yells across the bar)
                    Billy, having one?  Have one!

      Whoever 'Billy' is, the guy ignores him. No reason. Just out 
      of Frank's league. Kev isn t too happy to see Frank.

                                  KEV
                    Go away, Frank.

      Frank pulls out an envelope, and with a flourish, the check 
      that s inside.

                                  FRANK
                    A pen, barkeep. Disability day!

      Kevin smirks, finds a pen by the register, hands it to Frank.

                                  KEV
                    The disability people haven t 
                    caught up to you yet? I thought 
                    they had a guy following you around 
                    with a camera?

                                  FRANK
                    They can follow me around all they 
                    want, but they ll have to catch me 
                    actually doing something.

      He hands the check over to Kevin. Frank notices how full the 
      joint is.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)
                    What s with the crowd?

                                  KEV
                    Layoff at the carburetor plant.

                                  FRANK
                    That s the problem with working. 
                    Too much instability. Stress.

      Kev returns from the register, hands Frank a few dollars.

                                  FRANK (CONT D)

                          (loudly)
                    Hey, a round for my friends from 
                    the UAW!

      A few heads turn, what?

                    Really?

                                  FRANK
                          (scoffing)
                    Nah...

      As Frank downs his shot and starts on his Schlitz we --

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Fiona reads an ancient, crumpled US Weekly, killing time as 
      she keeps her foot wedged against the washer door.  Washing 
      machine churns away happily, until... KNOCK at the back door.  
      As she abandons the washer, it grinds instantly to a stop.


      She opens the back door, surprised to see Steve.

                                  STEVE
                    Hiya!

      She returns to the washer, jams her foot against the door, to 
      jump start the machine. Steve saunters in. 

                                  STEVE (CONT'D)
                    Wondering what your schedule's like 
                    Friday?

                                  FIONA
                    I've got a party.

                                  STEVE
                    Want a chaperone?

      Steve clocks the small pyramid of toilet paper rolls and pile 
      of tiny bars of wrapped motel soap on the kitchen table.

                                  FIONA
                    You're not eligible.

                                  STEVE
                    Right. Pre-nup chick thing?

      No reply. She just stares at him cynically.

                                  FIONA
                    Steve, you're not that desperate.

                                  STEVE
                          (thrown)
                    Wanting to see you again's 
                      desperate?

                                  FIONA
                    Feeling like you have to. That's 
                      desperate. You could get laid 
                    anywhere.

                                  STEVE
                          (scoffs)
                    So I'm only here for a fuck? 
 

                                  FIONA
                    Never crossed your mind?

      She coldly dismisses him by moving to the freezer, removing 
      ingredients for a family meal.

                                  STEVE
                    This is all a bit Hans Christian 
                    Anderson. Just when you think you 
                    collared your dream girl... her 
                      incontinent, alcoholic father 
                    appears, wrecks everything... And 
                    she's blaming you!

                                  FIONA
                    Dream girl? Please, we had drunken 
                    sex on my kitchen floor.

                                  STEVE
                    Stop pretending you don't even know 
                    me. You weren't that drunk.
                          (which gets her attention)
                    If the only reason last night 
                    happened was because it happened, 
                    so what?  At least something did.  
                    It did for me.

      Pause. They hold a look. She's genuinely thrown by his choice 
      of words. Or guts to use them. He's off her radar for the 
      kind of guys she's used to dealing with. Lip barges in from 
      the living room, dumping a lunch plate in the sink.

                                  STEVE (CONT'D)
                    Hey, it's Phillip!

                                  LIP
                    Hey, it's dead man walking! Jimmy 
                    Clifton called looking for you.

                                  STEVE
                    No school?

                                  LIP
                    Couple teeth pulled this morning.

                                  STEVE
                    Wisdom teeth?

                                  LIP
                    Sugar rot.

                                  STEVE

                    Little known fact: make sure you 
                    don't just chew your food on one 
                    side. It can buckle your jaw, which 
                    can buckle your hips and affect 
                    your posture.

                                  LIP
                    That a fact?

                                  STEVE
                    Skeletal fact.

      Fiona moves back to her stork position against the washing 
      machine. It hums back into action. Steve clocks this small 
      mechanical blip.

                                  FIONA
                            (sideglance)
                    Lip.

      Mimes  fuck off . Lip respects her privacy. As he exits --

                                  LIP
                          (to Steve)
                    Talk out of your ass with that much 
                      conviction, you end up needing a 
                    much bigger toothbrush. Anal fact.

      Exits grinning. Steve registers the variable intellects of 
      this neighborhood.

                                  FIONA
                    Listen, thanks for trying to get my 
                    purse back, and... stuff. But -

                                  STEVE
                    'Stuff'?

                                  FIONA
                    I'm not looking. Not right now.

                    Okay if I leave my number for when 
                    you might be?

      She shrugs indifferently. Steve finds a pen, scrap of paper.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Karen's mom Sheila widening the door for Lip and Ian.

                                  LIP
                    Mrs. Jackson!

                                  SHEILA
                    Oh Karen's thrilled with you! Got 
                    an A on her Physics mid-term.
                          (yells upstairs)
                    Karen! It's your little helper!
                          (to the boys)
                    I'm out of grocery bags. Why don t 
                    you leave your shoes out here where 
                    they can breathe.

      Ian bemused.   Lip's already inured by the crazy Mrs. J.



      Looking to kitchen where Sheila sits on a bar stool, peeling 
      potatoes, lost in The Food Network on her counter top TV. To 
      Sheila, the hosts are like lifelong buddies.

      CAMERA pans round to the table in the living room. Lip 
      diligently doing Karen's homework.

      Ian reads from the table of elements with increasing 
      difficulty and, of course, Karen is nowhere to be seen.

                                  IAN
                          Erbium...Cerium...Praseodymium..

                                  SHEILA
                          (still watching the TV)
                    You kids want some Hot Pockets?

                                  LIP
                    Ah...no thank you, we re good...

      Ian reacts to his dick being mauled beneath the table by the 
      industrious Karen.

      At which point, Eddie Jackson, patriarch, arrives from 
      upstairs in his CTA uniform. Lip and Ian surprised. They 
      hadn't counted on a second parent, two parents are rare 
      around heren.

                                  EDDIE
                    Right. I'm off to work.
                          (nods to the boys)
                    How's it goin' fellas? Where's 
                    Karen?

      Ian has a little freaked-out convulsion.

                                  LIP
                    Her room, I think. Google Earth - 
                    for a GPS reference for the house 
                    Isaac Newton was born in.

      Eddie's pleased that Karen's showing an interest these days.  
      He proceeds to kitchen, where we can see him and Sheila thru' 
      the hatch.  Sheila is merrily preparing his lunchpail.

                                  SHEILA
                    Guess what I've made for you!

                                  EDDIE
                          (irritated, so wilfully 
                            inaccurate)
                    Cornish game hen and Asian pear?

                                  SHEILA
                    No!

                                  EDDIE
                    Wild salmon with honey glazed baby 
                    carrots?

                                  SHEILA
                          (thrill mounting)
                    Nope! Kiss and I'll tell.

      She awaits physical contact - little kiss, that's all.  
      Please. But no. Miserable Eddie snatches up the lunch pail.

                                  EDDIE
                    I'll find out what I've got when I 
                    open the damn box, alright?

      He doesn't kiss, won't kiss. Sheila sags with disappointment. 
      His forensic lack of affection baffles her.


                                  EDDIE (CONT'D)
                          (yells upstairs)
                    Karen! I'm late, honey so - see you 
                    in the morning!

      Then, as he turns to leave for work, his lunch pail clips a 
      vegetable strainer on the counter.  A peeled potato drops 
      into the living room.  The potato rolls dangerously close to 
      the dining table where Lip and Ian are sitting.

      The predictability of what happens next, registers with 
      abject panic on Lip's face and shatters his smile.

      Eddie goes to pick up the potato... Sees his daughter s shoes 
      sticking out from under the table on Ian's side.

                                  EDDIE (CONT'D)
                          (amused)
                    What's she hiding for?
                          (then puzzled)
                    What ya' hiding for?

      He then clocks the terror on both boys' faces and the sordid 
      reality dawns on him. He screams with outrage.

                                  EDDIE (CONT'D)
                    Oh, sweet Jesus! 

      Karen's face appears from under the tablecloth, and Ian doing 
      up his zipper, confirms the very worst.

                                  EDDIE (CONT'D)
                    No?!

      And, in a mighty, single sweep, Eddie yanks the table back.

      Ian scrambles to avoid the assault. Lip darts the other way. 
      Karen bolts for the safety of her mom as Eddie lunges 
      manically for either intruder. He'll kill 'em.

      Lip just avoids being caught. Ian darts behind Eddie and into 
      the kitchen, slamming out the back door. Lip darts into the 
      hall, stumbles over a bicycle, bolts upstairs.

      ANGLE - EDDIE trying to decide who to go after.

                                  SHEILA
                    What's set him off now?

      Karen scurries behind Sheila. Eddie takes off after Lip.

                                  SHEILA (CONT'D)
                    It's just a study group, honey!


      After all the mayhem, there's suddenly an eerie silence. 
      Followed by a loud THUMP from upstairs.

                                  KAREN
                    He's caught Lip!


      Lip s writhing in agony on his bed. Ian watches Fiona conduct 
      standard triage on the ankle. Fiona s incredulous:

                                  FIONA
                    An old lady on the train?

                    The door was closing on her walker, 
                    Lip barely got his foot in the door 
                    in time to stop it --

      She rattles Lip s toes. Lip YELPS in pain.

      Ian dives out. Veronica rolls her sleeves up, moving towards 
      Lip like an expert. Until there s --

      A LOUD KNOCK AT THE FRONT DOOR.

      Lip bounces up scurries to hide under the bed.

                                  LIP
                    I'm not here! I'm not HERE!!

      Ian scrambles back into the room from the stairs.

                                  IAN
                    You've never heard of us, Fiona!

      Fiona suddenly rails against being lied to about all this.

                                  FIONA
                    What. Have. You. DONE?! WHAT HAVE 
                    YOU DONE?

      No time to wait for reply. Another LOUD KNOCK. Fiona has to 
      venture downstairs.


      Carl skulking at safe distance behind Fiona, who approaches 
      the front door with trepidation. Finally opens it to...

      A smiling DELIVERY MAN with a huge 'Sears' logo ed carton.

      Ian with accumulated handsful of medical supplies. He dives 
      into the bedroom, seeking Veronica's smokes and lighter on 
      top of the big flatscreen.

      But - Kev's in bed asleep. Kev stirs and kicks the duvet off, 
      crotch exhibited.

      Ian spots this reflected in the TV screen. He knows looking 
      is forbidden. Knows he shouldn t, shouldn t... So, finally he 
      grabs the smokes and makes to exit... when --

                                  KEV
                    Where you goin  with those?

                                  IAN
                    Veronica wants 'em.

      We think for a second that Ian's been caught looking. But no.

                                  KEV
                    Throw me one.

      Ian has to hand Kev a smoke and light it for him, and resist 
      the compulsion to stare at a grown-guy's dick as Kev lets his 
      legs spread nonachalantly across the leopard sheets. Kev 
      takes a big drag and then melts back into his sleepy nest. 
      Ian bolts without explanation.

      C/U Kev for a second longer and then his 5pm radio-alarm 
      clicks on, Kev sleepily whacks the 'snooze' button.  Does a 
        half-hearted sing-a-long to whichever Karen Carpenter song he 
      just silenced.

      Veronica arrives from upstairs with her hallmark medical bag, 
      chaperoning Lip to the ground floor, both perplexed by the 
      Sears guy installing a brand-spanking washing machine.

      The Sears guy looks unduly pressurized by the expanding 
      audience - Ian, Fiona, Carl, Debbie, Liam, now Lip and 
      Veronica, like this is a rare event. Which it is.

                                  VERONICA
                          (to Fiona)

                    That's what I said!

      Fiona, equally baffled, reaches into the basin where she's 
      put a bouquet of flowers.


                                  FIONA
                    These were inside the washer.

      She shows Veronica the message tag. 'XOXO STEVE'

                            (flabbergasted)

                    I know!

      But the sheer thrill of romantic novelty on Fiona's face says 
      the strategy has worked.

      Eddie is leaving the family - for good. Aggressively boxing-
      up every clown motif object in the house - clocks, ornaments, 
      paintings, etc., they belong to him, not mad Sheila. Sheila 
      is beside herself with the distress of desertion.

      Karen's hovering in the kitchen door, upset.

                    Eddie, whatever it is, I'll try. 
                    I ll try... really TRY.

      But he continues packing without forgiveness.

                    Mom, don't beg him! If he can do

      Ian works at the corner store. Right now he s re-stocking the 
        refrigerator case in the back with cheap beer. KASH (owner) 
      is at the register, generally despising his lifestyle. A 
      gigantic American flag hangs behind the counter.

      Kash's wife, LINDA, (white by way of Wisconsin) blasts into 
      frame, wearing a Muslim head-scarf and floor length skirt.

                          (exiting)
                    She s your mother, get her to take 
                    her Thorazin!

      They climb into the Toyota flatbed truck at the curb outside. 
      Kash sighs in relief in the aftermath. Sees Ian chuckling at 
      Kash s expense. Kash holds a stare.  

                                  KASH
                    Least my family registers as human 
                    protein on a DNA test. 

      Not offensive. Ian laughs. Just banter between the two of 
      them as Ian resumes his beer-stacking task.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      ANGLE - FIONA on the payphone, clutching that scrap of paper 
      with Steve's name on it.


                                  FIONA
                    How much did you pay for it?

      We INTERCUT with Steve on his cellphone, in some kind of 
      grimy auto shop, sparks from a grinder fly in the background.

                                  STEVE
                    I'm not telling you that. It's a 
                    gift. So you'd remember the phone 
                    number. Which obviously worked.

                                  FIONA
                    Your washer-dry's in the backyard.  
                    We don't need it, I don't want it. 
                    So you need to come get it before 
                    it starts rusting.

      Pause.

                                  STEVE
                    Is it?

      Pause.

                                  FIONA
                    No.

                                  STEVE
                    Did the guy connect it?

                                  FIONA
                          (reluctantly)
                    Yes.

                                  STEVE
                    It's working okay?

                                  FIONA
                    Not my favorite color...

                                  STEVE
                          (more to the point)
                    So you've tried it?

      She's put herself on the spot. Pause. Hangs up. Off Steve, 
      closing his cellphone, smiling.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Dead of night. Fiona heads for the kitchen. Peers into the 
      refrigerator. A chicken that s all bone, what s left of 
      Rita s tamales. A case of beer and big bottle of Vodka next 
      to Liam s sippy cup and boxes of juice. Grabs the sippy cup.

      Spots Ian sitting in the dark with a box of tissues. Has he 
      been crying? Joins him in the shadows, sensing trouble.

                                  FIONA
                    Just tell me you haven't gone and 
                    gotten some girl pregnant.

                                  IAN
                    No worries!

      He glances across the floor to where Frank's unconscious, 
      flat on his back, mouth open. Ian is (and has been) trying to 
      flick small balls of tissue into Frank's gaping mouth.

                                  IAN (CONT'D)
                          (beat)
                    He hates me.

      She studies Ian, decides to throw him a line.

                                  FIONA
                    You look more like mom than any of 
                    the rest of us.

      Which suddenly makes sense to Ian. Too late, and nowhere near 
      justifying the shit he gets for this.

                                  FIONA (CONT'D)

                    You probably scare him.

                                  IAN
                    Yeah?
                          (perverse smile)
                    He ain't seen nothin yet.

                                  FIONA
                    Did he give you money for the field 
                    trip?

                                  IAN
                          (truculent)
                    I'll pay my own way.

                                  FIONA
                    No you won't.

      Fiona crawls over to horizontal Frank, raises one of his legs 
      until coins rolls out of his pocket. It s an essential form 
      of mugging she's perfected over years. Frank remains 
      oblivious. Ian takes the cash, amused by her talents.

                                  IAN
                    You must be sick of having to think 
                    for everybody.

                                  FIONA
                    Least I can. Proves I'm wanted.

                                  IAN
                          (shrugs it off)
                    If all you want is being needed, 
                      congratulations, Fiona...

      He finally gets a ball of Kleenex into Frank's gaping mouth.

                                  IAN (CONT'D)
                    ...you got yourself a job for life 
                    with this joker.

      Ian quietly heads back to bed, leaving Fiona to dwell on that 
      prospect, Frank still unconscious across the room.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      C/U STEVE, but framed against what appear to be 'clouds'. Guy 
      with big things on his mind. His cellphone goes off to pull 
      him back from his reverie.


      Fiona back at the bar's payphone, almost exactly positioned 
      as she was the last time she rang Steve. Different clothes.  
      But this is more or less how she postures for outgoing calls, 
      because she always makes them from here.

                                  FIONA
                    If that wasn't a pile of bull... 
                    What was I wearing?

                                  STEVE
                    Huh?

      This is way out of the blue for him.

                                  FIONA
                    The first time you saw me?
                          (beat)
                    If that wasn't a lie?

      NOTE: ONCE WE START INTERCUTTING WITH STEVE IN THE CARWASH, 
      IT'LL BECOME OBVIOUS THAT THE 'CLOUDS' ARE DETERGENT FOAM ON 
      HIS WINDSHIELD. BUT HOPEFULLY NO LESS MAGICAL AN EFFECT FOR 
      THIS CONVERSATION.


                                  STEVE
                    Pink shirt, black trousers, thin 
                    shoes... straps... sandals! With 
                    your hair pinned high. Dangly 'O'-
                    shaped earrings that made me smile.

      BRIEF FLASHBACK to Fiona dancing in the nighclub that night, 
      exactly as he's describing her.

      When we flit back to Fiona, FADE OUT SOUND on the bustle from 
      the bar. Her ears now tuned to Steve's voice. Probably the 
      nicest, most special thing anyone's ever said to her --

                                  STEVE (CONT'D)
                    A big watch - too big, so it slid 
                    up your arm, looked great. You were 
                    dancing next to a red-haired girl 
                    in a green dress.

                                  FIONA
                    Jenna. It was Jenna's birthday. So 
                    you're watching her, who's a lot 
                    better looking than me...

                                  STEVE
                    Think so? Really?

                                  FIONA
                    So how come you're not stalking 
                    Jenna?

                                  STEVE
                    Because you... you think like that, 
                    and Jenna doesn't. She dances for 
                    an audience and you dance like 
                    there's nobody else in the room.

      As if someone just crashed through the doors of the bar, a 
        non-naturalistic breeze wafts her hair. She's soaking up the 
      flattery.

                                  STEVE (CONT'D)
                    Your life's not simple Fiona. And 
                    you can't stop it from showing. 
                    'Cuz you're no fake, you're not 
                    vain. You're not lost, so you don't 
                    need finding. This whole fucking 
                    city belongs to the Jennas of this 
                    world, but I'm sick of them. I 
                    swear, Fiona, you're nothing like 
                    anyone I ever met. You make me want 
                    to enjoy my life.
                          (makes himself smile at 
                            this realization)
                    You still there? Hello? Fiona?


      By now, they're clearing dessert. Fiona and Steve's faces 
      inches apart across their table. Her scepticism about men is 
      already commencing its 'self-fulfilling-prophecy' pattern.

                                  STEVE
                    What have I ever done... to 
                    anybody, nevermind you... to look 
                      'unreliable'... Unreliable?

      She nods.  That's her word.

                                  FIONA
                    People like you are way-too-used to 
                    getting your own way.

                                  STEVE
                    'People like me' being people 
                    like... what?

      She shrugs, tries putting a finger on it.

                                  STEVE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, wait. Yes-No. All you have to 
                    do is, agree or disagree:
                          (mimics the 'ping' of a 
                            quiz show bell)
                    'He thinks the sun shines out of 
                    his own ass.'

      She laughs.

                                  STEVE (CONT'D)
                    Agree, or d...

                                  FIONA
                    Agree.

                                  STEVE
                     He's overly-generous and that bugs 
                    me. 

                                  FIONA
                    Agree.

                                  STEVE
                    'Cuz I'm not... 
 

                                  FIONA
                    Actually, very agree.

                    'Cuz I'm not used to being

      Beat. Fine.

                                  FIONA
                    Agree.

                                  STEVE

                    to Steve, have always let me down?'


      She's frowning, resents his smart-ass phrasing.

                                  STEVE (CONT'D)
                    'So, deciding the guy's over-
                    educated, with more money than 
                    sense... is somehow more socially 
                      acceptable than asking, for 
                    instance, why the men I always meet

      Bang on the nerve.

                    And you prefer a guy who's been 
                    around the block a few times?

                                  FIONA
                    What if I did?

                                  STEVE
                    Say, D-Block of a maximum security 
                    prison?  With a name you'd know 
                    from the news?

                                  FIONA
                          (truculent smirk)
                    If they knew how to have fun, sure!

      He melts into his chair hopelessly.

                                  STEVE
                    Fiona. I can't help my upbringing.

                                  FIONA
                    So how come it's me again, having 
                    to apologize for MINE?

                                  STEVE
                    Who's ASKING you too?

      His volume turns heads in the restaurant. She absentmindedly 
      perches back onto her seat. The destructive power of her 
        'self-fulfilling-prophecy' ritual suddenly dawns on her.

                                  WAITRESS
                    We finished here, guys?

      Steve looks up to a WAITRESS hovering.

                                  STEVE
                          (of Fiona)
                    We're working on it.

      Waitress begins to clear plates.

                                  STEVE (CONT'D)
                    You wanna wait outside while I pay 
                    the bill?

                                  FIONA
                    Sure.

      She collects her purse, leaves. Steve manipulates the 
      waitress's wrist to check the time. A very intimate thing to 
      do to someone he doesn't know but she doesn't flinch.

                                  STEVE
                    He s on break?

                                  WAITRESS
                    Any second now.

      He winks, pulls a fat envelope out of his pocket, slips it to 
      her. She smiles. Do they know each other?


      Steve waits by the bathrooms, watches as an older man in a 
      green parking valet s waistcoat walks past him, disappears 
      into the men s room. Steve turns to the coat check window, 
      where the waitress quickly hands him a green valet jacket. 

      As he pulls it on -- 


      A contrite Lip s been transformed into a handyman, ankle 
      wrapped by Veronica.

      He's helpfully replacing the broken front window with a sheet 
      of plyboard. He's currently sawing the plywood to the 
      window's dimensions.  Karen steadies the wood.

      REVEAL Sheila on the couch, mortified that they're wearing 
      outdoor footwear, inside the house.

                                  KAREN
                          (radar on red alert)
                    Mom, we have to wear shoes. There s 
                    bits of glass all over the floor.

      Sheila nods rare concession.

      Lip finally slots the ply sheet up to window aperture. Only 
      now do we see that he's pilfered from the derelict house 
                                                  'Grandad's dead. There is 
      adjacent to the Gallaghers'... 
      nothing else to steal from this house. So please FUCK OFF!

                                  KAREN (CONT'D)
                    Maybe Lip could do with a drink?

      Sheila bounces to her feet, glad of a task.

                                  SHEILA
                    Sorry, yeah... Sorry, Lip, I m a... 
                    bit off today, aren t I, Karen?  
                    So! Vodka, some tonic... plenty of 
                    tequila but I'm out of lime, gin 
                      definitely...

                                  KAREN
                    Just a couple of Cokes, mom.

                                  SHEILA
                    ...and a few beers.

                                  LIP
                    Beer's great, Sheila, thanks.

      Sheila disappears into the kitchen. Sotto to Karen:

                                  LIP (CONT'D)
                    What if your dad comes back and 
                    sees me here?

                                  KAREN
                    He won't.

                                  LIP
                    That's my fault?

                                  KAREN
                    He's been looking for an excuse for 
                    months.

      Lip lifts the plywoood up to the window, struggling with his 
      bad ankle.  Karen helpfully assists, handing him nails etc.

                                  LIP
                    Thanks.
                          (he builds awkwardly to 
                            asking)
                    What kind of impression did you get 
                    of my brother?

                                  KAREN
                    Ian?  Seems nice.

                                  LIP
                    But... did he get hard?

                                  KAREN
                    Huh?

                                  LIP
                    Did you MAKE him... hard?

      Karen has to think back.


                                  KAREN
                    Ever try to play pool with a rope?

      Lip wilts.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Frank stands at the end of the kitchen like he just had a 
      stroke. Gawking.

      ANGLE - on the new washing machine.  Alien presence.


      Frank on the sofa. Still catatonic. Cigarette going. TV is on 
      but his head's at right-angles. To the vase of flowers.  No, 
      not a vase  - they've stuck the bouquet in the fish bowl.  
      One solitary goldfish in a shrunken homestead.

                                  FRANK
                    Now you know what I feel like!

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Looking into the empty shop to the counter. Sounds of sex.    
      Back door slams. Sex stops abruptly.

      Lip comes in from the back with the hammer and saw. No signs 
      of life. Odd. He walks around to check.

      Ian and Kash emerge from the stockroom with a sweat on, 
      carting boxes.

                                  KASH
                          (bossy)
                    You stack the sodas, I'll do the 
                    snacks...
                          (then feigns shock at the 
                            sight of)
                    Jeez! Lip! Christ!

                                  LIP
                    Sorry, I just...
                          (of the tools)
                    Thanks for the tools, Kash.

                                  KASH
                    Anytime, long as I get 'em back.

      But something's wrong. Lip knows something's wrong. Ian and 
      Kash go through the pantomime of counting stock.


      Then it strikes Lip like a thunderbolt.

                                  LIP
                    You must be joking!

      Ian looks up, like a social X-ray.

                                  LIP (CONT'D)
                    You're fucking him?! HIM?!

      Kash shrivels. How could Lip know? How?

      Lip glances to their feet. They're each wearing odd sneakers, 
      one of each other's.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Lip on his bed, seething. Ian bounds upstairs and bounces in. 
      Sits on his bed. Nervous. Lip looks at Ian s new sneakers.

                                  LIP
                    He bought them for you. Didn't he?

      Ian reluctantly nods.

                                  LIP (CONT'D)
                    He's married. With kids! What else 
                    does he buy you, Ian?

                                  IAN
                    Stuff. Now and again.

                                  LIP
                    And you're happy with that?
                          (off Ian's shrug)
                    What's that make you?
                          (another shrug)
                    Fucking kept boy, at best.

      Ian flies for Lip's throat. They've fought before but this 
      intensity from Ian is unprecedented.

                                  IAN
                    Listen to me, stupid! You think you 
                    know everything, and you don t know 
                    shit. Ask me what I've bought him.  
                    Ask me!

      Lip's going blue. They're both tugging at each other's 
      throats and clothes.

                                  IAN (CONT'D)
                    CDs, dozens of CDs, stuff he's 
                    never heard of, stuff I think he'll 
                    like, because I want him to like 
                    stuff that I like. Plus - two Sox 
                    tickets for his birthday. Limited-
                    edition team posters for Christmas.  
                    So what's that make you, Lip?  Eh?  
                    Makes you WRONG, you smart asshole!
                          (and with a final dig)
                    Go back there now. Promise Kash 
                    you'll keep your mouth shut. Cuz 
 
                    he's shitting himself. And he's 
                    done nothing... understand? 
                      Absolutely nothing to be sorry for.

      A chastised Lip gets to his feet, nurses his throat and and 
      indignantly straightens his clothing.  Long pause as he 
      absorbs that this is a fully consenting relationship.


                                  LIP
                          (a newspaper headline)
                    Fake Muslim cheats on white 
                      fundamentalist wife with gutless 
                    gayboy.
                          (even more tragic)
                    Says more about White Sox fans than 
                    it does the rest of us.

      Lip dodges a lunge from Ian, heads out.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Shop lights out, only light comes from the stockroom.  
      Through a half open door, we see Kash, Ian and Lip - 
      questions and answers. Kash is devastated, crying, 
      confessing. Ian is volubly explaining to Lip that Kash is as 
      stuck with the bigotry of being round here, but worse. Much 
      worse. As Lip digests this --

      Fiona leads Steve into the kitchen, starts to kiss him.

                                  FIONA
                    Sounds like they're all in bed.

      With which, Frank swooshes in from the living room, in a 
      fairly flowery mood.

                                  FRANK
                    Gotcha!
                          (grins, then cryptically)
                    Who's been eating my porridge?

      Fiona skillfully scans Frank's mood.  Senses instinctively 
      that tonight he's harmless.

                                  FIONA
                    Hiya dad. This's Steve.

                                  STEVE
                    We've met before, but you weren't 
                      exactly...

      Fiona silences Steve with a nudge, Frank goes to shake hands.

                                  FRANK
                    How much do you weigh?

                                  STEVE
                    I don t know.

                                  FRANK
                          (Steve's jacket)
                    That'd fit me.

                                  FIONA
                    Ignore him.
                          (to Frank)
                    Move! 
 

      She nudges him out of the way to reach the fridge.

                                  STEVE
                    Listen, I should leave you to get 
                    to bed.
                          (to Fiona)
                    Thanks.  That was really nice.

                                  FIONA
                    You too.

      And really means that.

      She's walking him to the door. Despite Frank, they go in for 
      a kiss but Frank comes charging over, slams the kitchen door, 
      locking them in and hanging on to the key. Skips to the 
      washing machine, pats it like a dog,


                                  FRANK
                    I want to know who paid for this?

      Then into the living room waving the key.

                                  STEVE
                    What the hell's he on?

                                  FIONA
                          (shrugs hopelessly)
                    He'll think he bought X. But the 
                    only dealer he gets credit from is 
                      a schizophrenic.

      They dare a giggle.


      The B-52 s, Love Shack, thumping away on the stereo. It s 
        half-an-hour later and Frank's coming down, smoothing out. 
      Steve now has his jacket off, Frank's topping their glasses 
      off. It's developed the verve of an after-hours party. You'd 
      never guess there were kids in the house.

                                  FRANK
                    Not a case of whether I agree.  
                    It's a fact. If I was a single 
                    parent, we'd be on...

      Fiona walks in with a packet of rolling papers.

                                  STEVE
                    Aren't you a single parent?

                                  FIONA
                          (heard it all before)
                    'yeah, but if I had a pair of 
                    tits...'

                                  FRANK
                          (oblivious)
                    Yeah, but if I had tits, Steve, 
                    they'd double the money. With a 
                    guy, they don't wanna fucking know.

                            (encouraging him)
                    I get it, Frank, so it's...
                          (gestures yak yak yak)
                    'Prove you're looking for work?'

                                  FIONA
                    He s on disability.

                                  STEVE
                    Yeah? For what?

                                  FRANK
                    A tragedy really, I gave my life to 
                    that company.

                                  FIONA
                    You worked there a week.

                                  STEVE
                    What happened?

                                  FRANK
                    Dangerous workplace, doing my job, 
                      unsuspecting, when out of nowhere, 
                    I m smashed in the ribs by a flying 
                    chicken. I was lucky, it almost 
                    missed me. And what do I get for my 
                    pain and suffering? Followed around 
                    by a video camera. Where s the 
                    trust, Steve? The sacred covenant 
                    between employer and employee.
                          (a beat)
                    Gone, Steve. It s gone.

      Steve's nodding, even though he can't find a link. Fiona's 
      smiling, water off a duck's back, reaches into Steve's pocket 
      for a lump of dope, rolling papers. Steve eggs Frank on.

                                  STEVE
                    Not, 'How's a guy supposed to work, 
                    hurt, with kids this age?'

                                  FRANK
                    Correct! Hello?!
                          (seeing the dope)
                      Excellent!
                          (to Steve)
                    Cuz her mom, God rest her soul...

                     cuz 
 
                    bitch.


      Fiona whacks him, hard, and means it.

                                  FIONA
                    Cut it out!

      It has no impact. Frank amused, holds Fiona at bay.

                                  FRANK
                    Four month old baby... 14 year old 
                    girl just had her appendix out, 11 
                    year old Lip, 10 year old Ian.

      And all the while, Fiona's punching his arm.

                                  FRANK (CONT'D)
                    ..seven year old and a five year 
                    old. Oh, and a Dodge Astro van. 
                    Calypso blue. What's the thing we 
                    needed most? One word? One thing?

                                  STEVE
                      Sterilization?

      Fiona laughs, concentrates on rolling the joint.

                                  FRANK
                      Continuity. Contin-uity. One 
                    Tuesday, we're out of bread. So I 
                    send her down to the corner. She 
                    grabs the van keys.
                          (throws his hands up)
                    Not seen it since. And we haven't a 
                    fucking clue where she is. 
 
                          (to Fiona)
                    Have we?  So, what...
                          (of the song)
                    Oh, I love this...

      Turns the music UP, Aerosmith, relishing the chorus. Steve 
      turns to find Fiona studying him, like all this is still part 
      of a test.

                                  FRANK (CONT'D)
                    I mean, what could I do, Steve?

                                  FIONA
                    Disappear for three weeks?

                                  FRANK
                          (ignoring her)
                    I had a breakdown.

                                  FIONA
                    You moved in with Tommy and went on 
                    a bender.

                                  FRANK
                    Fuck off! Nervous - BREAKDOWN.

      LOUD BANGING on front window. Steve spins, alarmed.

                                  FIONA
                          (unruffled)
                    Dad. Key.

      Frank chucks the key to Steve, who deducts that he should get 
      the door, then.


      Steve lets in an angry Kev, in only a T-shirt and boxers.

                                  KEV
                    Know what time it is?!

                                  STEVE
                    Sorry, Kev, it's Frank, he's...

      Kev bounces past him into the living room carrying a CD case. 
      Steve goes to shut the door but it gets pushed open by 
      Veronica -dressing gown, bare feet. She's carrying a bottle 
      of vodka. Grabs a few glasses from one of the cupboards and 
      follows Kev into the living room.

                                  KEV
                          (aggressive to Frank)
                    What've I told you?

      Kev turns the music OFF. Steve returns, expecting trouble.

                                  FRANK
                    Here we go. Neighbors of Satan!

      Kev proceeds to pull the Aerosmith CD from the player and 
      toss it across the room, replacing it with one of his own.

                                  KEV
                    The day you pay rent like the rest 
                    of us Frank, you can play whatever 
                    shit you want.

      Fergie. Kev's music. Turned up loud. Frank loves being abused 
      by Kev. It flatters him. The evening becomes a messy 
      impromptu party, with Veronica circulating the vodka.     
      BOOM BOOM BOOM. Off Steve, smiling at the madness --


      Fiona and Steve rigidly next to each other in bed. Music 
      still thumping from downstairs.

                                  STEVE
                    He made me follow you up.

                                  FIONA
                    Well he's right. You can't drive 
                    now, but...

      Fiona raises her duvet to release a muffled snoring sound.

                                  FIONA (CONT'D)
                    Liam's in here somewhere.

                                  STEVE
                    Don't the kids wake up?

                                  FIONA
                    Would you?

      He laughs. He takes her hand, plays with her fingers, wraps 
      his fingers around hers. She lets her eyes shut. She s safe.



      Carl reluctantly drags his school clothes on. Lip comes up 
      from downstairs.

                                  LIP
                    Seen Ian?

                                  CARL
                    Gone when I woke up.

      Lip puzzled, goes to the window. His POV: Smoke rising from 
      the Astrovan window.

      BACK ON Lip, checking that Carl's distracted before reaching 
      under Ian's mattress for that porn file.

      Ian s struggling with his own thoughts when there s a RAP on 
      the window. Lip climbs in. Ian throws him a hard look.  Lip 
      slaps an open gay porn mag down between them.

                                  LIP
                    How can that be good for you?

      Ian won't dignify it with a response. Lip turns a page.

                                  LIP (CONT'D)
                    Or that?

      Ian aggressively snatches the mag.

                                  IAN
                    Know what's not funny? You. Ever.

      Lip takes seconds on Ian's cigarette.

                                  LIP
                    Anybody before Kash?

                                  IAN
                    One.

                                  LIP
                    Who?

                                  IAN
                    I'm not telling you.

                    Name a single time I've let you 
                    down.

      Ian's reaction. Lip hasn't, ever.

                                  IAN
                    Kid at school.
                          (then, second thoughts)
                    Well it's no big deal any more.  
                    He's long gone. Roger Spikey.

                                  LIP
                    The original beef meister? Donkey 
                    dick? Or did he start that rumor?

                                  IAN
                          (twitch of the eyebrows)
                    Not a rumor.

                                  LIP
                    Hey that looked a bit gay.
                          (does the eyebrows)
                    Wanna watch yourself with that.
                          (more intrigued about)
                    And actually? Up the ass?

      Ian refuses to get drawn.

                                  LIP (CONT'D)
                    Do you get used to that? Can you?  
                    Whole point of the digestive 
                    system's one-way traffic.
                          (drags hard on cigarette)

                    Just is.

      Ian smiles ironically, then a laugh erupts.

                                  LIP (CONT'D)
                    What?
                          (lets the smoke go)
                    What!?

                                  IAN
                          (mimics)
                    'Just is!' Like we're only given a 
                    pair of fuckin  lungs to smoke! 
  

      They both laugh too loud, then quiet, and finally, smile.


      Fiona makes her way down the stairs in her robe, following 
      the sound of the usual tribal breakfast chaos. Steps into the 
      kitchen, surprised to see all the kids carrying food to the 
      table - eggs, toast, juice.

                                  FIONA
                    What s all this?

      Steve at the stove, frying up a skillet full of bacon.

                                  STEVE
                    Debbie's the only person I know 
                    wakes up earlier than I do. I told 
                    her I never eat breakfast but she 
                    said it's her favorite meal. And 
                    since it's her birthday, I thought 
                    we should...

      The others all swing a look to Debbie.

                                  FIONA
                    No, it's not!

                                  DEBBIE
                          (bare-faced lie)
                    I never said it was. I said I 
                    wished it was!

                                  STEVE
                    Ah, right! She 'wished it was!'.  
                    Sorry, Debs, totally misheard that.  
                      Perforated eardrum on the right.

      Fiona s loving all this, but --

                                  FIONA
                    You've got 15 minutes before 
                    school, tops. Ian, Lip, your turn 
                    to do the dishes soon as you re 
                    done. Debbie, Carl, you need to 
                    take the trash out.

      So, fine then. The most hectic part of Fiona's day's been 
      rendered manageable by Steve's apparently effortless 
      contribution. Steve goes to sit down to eat, but his chair's 
      obstructed.


      ANGLE - Frank flat out on the floor from the night before.   
      People walking round him all morning, like a carpet tumor.

      Steve without making a fuss, delicately crosses Frank's legs 
      to make him look like a sunbather. As Steve finally tucks in 
      his own chair and starts to eat, the family happily digging 
      into the breakfast feast, talking, yelling, laughing as we --

                                                                          FADE OUT.


                                        THE END
