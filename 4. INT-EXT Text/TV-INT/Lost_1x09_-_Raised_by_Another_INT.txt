      CLAIRE BOLTS UPRIGHT INTO FRAME.  And we re EXTREMELY CLOSE 
      on her.  She s confused.  Disoriented.  Couldn t have heard --

      The BABY CRIES again.  Distant, but not too distant.

      And instinctively Claire s hand falls to her belly... and her 
      face REGISTERS this before we MOVE DOWN to find --

      Her belly is perfectly FLAT.  She s not pregnant.  And she s 
      trying to make sense of how this is possible as we REALIZE --

      Claire is in one of the small caves/cubbies inside the 
      valley.  The CRY again.  Coming from outside the caves.

      And whatever the fuck is going on, Claire is DRAWN TOWARDS 
      that sound so --

      We FOLLOW HER as she leaves the caves and enters --


      SUPER TIGHT ON CLAIRE AS -- SHE SCREAMS!

      And we PULL BACK to find her STANDING in the middle of the 
      valley.  Alone.  Waning FIRELIGHT.

      And now STIRRING.  People waking up to the sound of the 
      SCREAMS.  And it s --

      CHARLIE who reaches her first -- Claire STILL screaming --

                                  CHARLIE
                    Claire?  Claire!?!

      No idea what the fuck is going on, Charlie grabs her by the 
      shoulders -- And she WAKES up -- EYES WIDE -- AS SCARED AS 
      SHE S EVER BEEN -- instinctively LASHING OUT at Charlie --

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Claire -- Stop!  It s me -- It s 
                    Charlie -- It s okay!

      In the far background, SUN, JIN, HURLEY and MICHAEL arrive  *
      from other areas of the caves.  They ve heard the screams.   *
      As they meet up, fast, overlapping --*

                        SUNMICHAEL
        (in Korean)I think it s Claire.
      What s going on?

                      HURLEYJIN
      Is she okay?(in Korean)
                                                  Is it the baby?

      Meanwhile, Charlie is still trying to rouse Claire -- *

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)*
                    Claire.  Listen to me --*

      And finally Claire zeroes in on Charlie.  Blinks.  Confused. *

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)*
                    It s okay.
                          (consoling)
                    You were dreaming -- 
                      sleepwalking...

      And that s when Charlie s eyes drop.  Sees something. *

                                  CHARLIE (CONT D)*
                    Claire --
                          (beat)
                    What happened...?

      And we can feel it before we see it.  Claire looks down at 
      her hands -- in fact all the way up to her wrists --

      They re covered in blood.

                                        ACT ONE


      We find Claire with JACK over in his INFIRMARY AREA.  He s 
      putting on his bedside manner as he examines her HANDS.  
      She s still shaken up, but putting on her best game face.

                                  JACK
                    Must ve been a hell of a nightmare.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (forced smile)
                    Who says it was a nightmare?

      Jack rips off a PIECE OF BANDAGE, delicately wraps Claire s 
      hand in it as we see FOUR DEEP CUTS embedded in her palm.

                                  JACK
                    I d say when someone makes fist so 
                    tight they dig their fingernails a *
                    quarter inch into their palms, 
                    they re not dreaming about pony 
                    rides.
                          (her eyes drop)
                    Y ever sleepwalk before?

                                  CLAIRE
                    No.  I mean I don t think so-- I 
                    mean how would I know?

                                  JACK
                    It d get back to you.  I had a 
                      girlfriend once, told me I talked 
                    in my sleep.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What d you say?

                                  JACK
                    Don t know.  Whatever it was, she 
                    didn t like it.

      Claire cracks a GRIN as Jack BANDAGES her other hand --

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    How was your OBgyn -- in Sydney?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Good.  She s good.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   6.

                                  JACK
                    She was okay with letting you fly 
                    in your third trimester?

      There s something here.  Something Claire doesn t wanna TELL.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I had a checkup the week before... 
                    she said it would be okay.

                                  JACK
                      Ultrasound cool?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yeah.  Very healthy.

                                  JACK
                    How ve you been feeling?

                                  CLAIRE
                    My back hurts.  Probably from 
                    sleeping on the ground.  I get 
                    dizzy when I stand up too fast.  
                    And I have to pee all the time.

                                  JACK
                          (smiles)
                    Eating enough?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Boar N  Bananas, yeah.

                                  JACK
                          (finishes bandaging)
                    How many weeks in are you?
                          (off her uncertainty)
                    ... what was the date you found out 
                    you were pregnant?

      We re ON CLAIRE as she can t help but recall:


    A small, typically messy Sydney loft of a 21 year-old guy.  
      Canvases and paints.  CDs and clothes and posters and food 
      and it s comfy, but definitely a young person s first place.  
      There have been lots of parties here -- but this moment is 
      not one of them: the guy who lives here, THOMAS, is freaking 
      out -- as is CLAIRE -- both of them walking across the small 
      place, from the open bathroom door, towards the window, for 
      light -- she s holding a PREGNANCY TEST WAND: 




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST   "Raised by Another"       (YELLOW)      9/23/04      7.
      (CONT'D):55


                        THOMASCLAIRE
      -- is it pink?-- I don t know yet!
      -- Did you pee on it?-- Yes!  Gimme a second--
      -- maybe you didn t use it 
      right ---- I can pee on a wand, 
      -- what color is it?Thomas--
          (checking his watch)-- how long has it been?
      -- sixty-six seconds...

      They re at the drapeless window now, both closely studying 
      the wand, waiting for the result.  CLOSE ON THEM (maybe 
      HANDHELD CAMERA?) in this tense-as-hell moment.  We love her -
    - and we like him, too -- for caring so much.  He s such a 
      guy, but he s got a heart.  HOLD ON THEM for a long beat.

                        THOMASCLAIRE
      -- oh God---- shh.

      Suddenly Claire holds up the INSTRUCTIONS, re-reads them, as 
      Thomas holds the wand, checking it again:

                        THOMASCLAIRE
      -- okay, it s definitely two-- 
      two lines---- two pink lines?

                                  THOMAS
                    Pink?  No-- these are, like, red... *

                                  CLAIRE
                          (eyes on the wand)
                    ... they re pink.*

                                  THOMAS
                    -- these?  That s...

    A beat... shit.  She stares off... tears coming to her eyes.  
      But Thomas doesn t want to give up -- his mind racing:

                THOMAS (CONT D)CLAIRE
      Okay, first of all, these 
      tests are not always -- Thomas...
      accurate.

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    No, come on: my uncle thought he 
                    had testicular cancer -- remember 
                    that?!

                                  CLAIRE
                    He did!  He s dead!




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   8.
      (CONT'D): (2)55


                                  THOMAS
                    No, it was a-- a-- wrong, a bad  *
                      diagnosis!  This thing doesn t mean 
                    for sure that you re pregnant -- we 
                    should go get another one--

                                  CLAIRE
                    I m six weeks late.  Six weeks.  
                    That never happens.
                          (beat, then, simply)
                    I m pregnant.
                          (tears)
                    ... so, um...

      -- but she s so afraid -- there s really nothing to say -- 
      and she s staring off, her mind racing, tears streaming down 
      her face.  What the hell is she gonna do?  Thomas is freaking 
      too -- but he s too good a guy.  So he takes her, holds her.

                                  THOMAS
                    Okay.  Okay, so this is gonna be 
                    okay.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (not at all believing it)
                    ... I know...

      Then we re ON THOMAS as a thought comes to him.  He looks  *
      into Claire s eyes.  Considers this before he says it.  Then: *

                                  THOMAS
                    Claire...
                          (then)
                    ... if we wanted... we could do  *
                    this.*

      And staring into his eyes, she starts to understand what he 
      means.  And this moment goes from being horrifying to 
      being... only a little less horrifying:

                                  CLAIRE
                    Stop it.

                                  THOMAS
                    No, I m not kidding.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Can you imagine that?
                          (then)
                    My mom would disown me--




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com        LOST   "Raised by Another"         (BLUE)         9/22/04   9.
      (CONT'D): (3)55


                                  THOMAS
                    She basically has already.

    A beat.  Then: she can t even consider it.

                                  CLAIRE
                    With what, my five dollar an hour 
                    job at the Fish N  Fry?

                                  THOMAS
                    You re not the only one with a job.  *
                    I mean... I ve got my art.*

                                  CLAIRE*
                          (doesn t wanna go there)*
                    You re sweet.  But this isn t what 
                    we want.

                                  THOMAS
                    Maybe it is.  I mean this could 
                    be... I dunno, the best thing ever.

      She s still, obviously, shocked at the whole situation.  But 
      this idea -- of keeping the baby -- bends her mind.  She s 
      never considered something like this before.  But she likes 
      him.  Christ, maybe this could work.

                                  CLAIRE
                    ... you d... really wanna...?

                                  THOMAS
                    Claire.  I love you.

      And she cries a little more now as he kisses her -- a 
      convincing kiss -- and we CUT TO:


      Quite a crowded place, save for the BARKING DOG, coming from 
    a nearby apartment.  Piles of books.  Dark and musty.  You 
      can see the dust in the air.  A cat may occasionally jump up 
      on the stacks of newspapers and mail, then back down again.

      In the middle of it all, Claire sits across a table from 
      RICHARD MALKIN.  Australian (60 s).  Doesn t look sharp at 
      all, wears a dark blazer and tie.  There s something oddly 
      legit about how he does his thing.  No evident humor from 
      Malkin.  Not a bad guy, but a touch odd.  Takes this 
      seriously.  Rachel is in the b.g.

                                  MALKIN
                    I need your hands.  For this.

      And Claire offers them, palms up.  He looks at her palms.  
      Closes his eyes for a long beat.  Leans his head back a 
      touch.  Claire finally, subtly, turns to Rachel, who 
      indicates for her to turn back to Malkin.  She does.

                                  MALKIN (CONT D)
                    ... oh...
                          (then)
                    ... when did you, uh...?  Find out?

      TIGHT ON CLAIRE as she stares.  Already, this is weird.

                                  CLAIRE
                    ... what.

      There s a beat -- we re TIGHT ON MALKIN as he listens, eyes 
      closed, to whatever voices talk to him.  Despite the 
      surroundings, this is an increasingly eerie moment...

                                  MALKIN
                    ... you know, about the baby.

      And holy fuck does Claire just go still.  Claire is freaked.   *
      Christ, she almost wants to cry.  She turns to Rachel --  *
      shoots her a look -- did you tell him?  Rachel shakes her  *
      head, no -- she didn t.  She s just a freaked as Claire is.   *
      Claire turns back to Malkin.*

                                  CLAIRE
                    ... uh... two days ago.

      Malkin listens, searches, on some kind of journey, sitting  *
      there, he seems to encounter something that disturbs him -- 
      creates a huge question -- something that makes him open his 
      eyes and check Claire s palms.

      Claire watches him closely -- what the hell is he doing? *

                        RACHELCLAIRE
      She hasn t told her mom yet -- 
      we re afraid she--Shhhh!

      TIGHT ON MALKIN as he studies her hands -- and apparently 
      sees something -- something that concerns him deeply --

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)*
                    What.  What, should I not tell her?

      Suddenly Claire wants to know what he thinks.  But Malkin, 
      holding her wrists, staring at her hands, does the best he 
      can to hide the utter terror that begins to creep up on him -- 
      he only wants to run the hell away -- but he doesn t want to 
      show his fear.  He lets go of her -- saying:

                                  MALKIN
                    I m not, uh...*
                          (then, agitated)*
                    I m overdue for a break --*

      Claire and Rachel are confounded as Malkin goes to his pocket  *
      -- counts out and hands back the money --

                        RACHELCLAIRE
      What?  A break?  We have an -- hold on-- were you 
      appointment --thinking something?

                                  MALKIN (CONT D)*
                          (standing)*
                    I m not doing this reading.

                                  CLAIRE
                    But you were gonna say something--

      But Malkin ushers them to the door.  As he opens it and  *
      motions for them to leave --*

                                    MALKIN*
                    Go.  Now.*

      After a beat, Rachel snorts her displeasure, laughs. *

                                    RACHEL*
                    What a freak.*

      And Rachel heads out -- but we HOLD ON CLAIRE, who looks off,  *
        surprisingly troubled by what she saw in Malkin s face.

      NIGHT has fallen again.  The pure STILLNESS of the valley 
      suggests we are in the WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING.

      THE CAMERA DRIFTING THROUGH IT ALL.  Something OMINOUS about 
      this.  Quiet.  Still.  And CREEPY.  And finally, we REST ON -- *


      CLAIRE.  Sleeps on her side, hand on her belly.  ON HER BABY. *

      And the CAMERA gets EXTREMELY CLOSE until Claire s face FILLS 
      THE FRAME.  And we just SIT here as --

      We begin to hear SOUNDS.  Unsettling noises.  METAL AGAINST 
      METAL -- not unlike a SWORD BEING UNSHEATHED.  Huh?

      Claire s EYES suddenly POP open -- Instantly aware that  *
      someone or SOMETHING is HERE with her -- looks down to see -- *

      SOMEONE IS STANDING OVER HER.

      The SHADOW moves quickly -- COVERS HER MOUTH with his (its?) 
      free hand!

      Maybe a man.  And Claire is fucking petrified with fear, 
      because it s not just that he s here, it s what he s doing...

      And this is highly STYLIZED -- TWENTY QUICK CUTS -- ONE 
      SECOND EACH -- CONFUSING -- DISTURBING -- BIZARRE --

      HERE is what we catch quick GLIMPSES OF: Claire s SHIRT is  *
      pulled up -- BARE STOMACH EXPOSED -- SHE STRUGGLES -- A WEIRD 
      METALLIC DEVICE pressed up against her belly -- AN OVERSIZED 
      HYPODERMIC NEEDLE DESIGNED BY H.R. GIGER -- CLAIRE S FEET 
      KICK AT THE AIR, BUT SHE S HELD DOWN -- A PLUNGER EXTENDS 
      FROM THE SIDE OF THE DEVICE -- SOMETHING PUNCTURES INTO HER 
      SKIN? -- All of this underscored by RAPID BREATHING --

      AND THE CUTS ABRUPTLY END because in the midst of this pure, 
      unadulterated TERROR, the scariest thing about it is the 
      CRACKLY WHISPER which comes from this unseen SHADOW --

                                  SHADOW
                    Shhhhhhhhhhhhh.

      And off THE HORROR in Claire s WIDE EYES --


                                  END OF ACT ONE

                    SOMEBODY HELP!!!!!!!!

      And this is not just a scream, it s a SCREAM TO THE TENTH 
      POWER -- Jack is instantly ALERT -- JUMPS UP -- RUNS --

      OTHERS awake now -- Some of them instinctively moving towards 
      the SHOUTS --

      But we STAY with Jack because this is PURE CHAOS -- HANDHELD 
      AND INSANE -- as he reaches --

      CLAIRE

      Literally HYSTERICAL.  Charlie already at her side, turns to 
      Jack as he RUSHES UP --

                                    CHARLIE
                    Someone attacked her!

      And this dialogue is all OVERLAPPING -- ON SPEED --

                                  CLAIRE
                    -- I don t know... I didn t... he

                    What s going on?

                      CHARLIEJACK
      We should fan out -- search 
      the area around the caves...-- Wait... hold on --

                                    CHARLIE
                    -- He can t have gotten far.
                          (to some others)
                    Hurley -- You two -- come on!

      Charlie and the others RUSH OFF through one of the cave 
      FINGERS as Jack puts his arm around Claire -- She s totally 
      PANICKED -- HYPERVENTILATING -- Jack in nurture mode --

                                  JACK
                    C mon, let s sit down.  Okay?
                          (to Ethan)
                    Can you get her some water, man?

                                  ETHAN
                    Sure.  Yes -- of course.

      Ethan heads off.  Claire left just with Jack and Michael -- 
      CAMERA settling down... but not completely --

                                  JACK
                    Okay -- you re safe, Claire.  Try 
                    to calm down -- We re here...

                                    MICHAEL
                    Did you get a look at him at all?

                      CLAIREJACK
      It was dark -- I didn t see --
                                                  -- Where did this happen?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Here -- I was sleeping and woke up 
                    and he was...
                          (petrified)
                    ... he was trying to hurt my baby.

      Unseen to Claire, Jack and Michael exchange a LOOK.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                          (all over the place)

      Claire pulls up her shirt -- but her belly is completely 
      UNMARKED.  When she talks again, it s softer:

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    He was trying to hurt my baby.

      And for the first time, we see DOUBT on Jack s face.


    A little later.  Charlie drapes a BLANKET over Claire s 
      shoulder.  She s still WIRED.  SCARED.

                                    CHARLIE
                    You all right?

      She doesn t say anything -- just offers a small nod.

                                    CHARLIE (CONT D)
                    Don t worry... You want to shut 
                    your eyes, I ll be here all night.  
                    No one s gonna get near you.
                          (beat; intensely sincere)
                    I won t leave you, Claire.  
                    Promise.

      And on that sentiment, we move in TIGHT on Claire s 
      UNBLINKING EYES as --


      JOHN MAYER PLAYS on the stereo.  Claire stands on a chair, 
      putting up drapes.  The sun pours in behind her, putting her 
      figure in silhouette -- and her figure has changed since we 
      last saw her in FLASHBACK; SHE S FOUR MONTHS PREGNANT NOW.  A 
      cute little belly.

      She turns as Thomas enters, carrying a backpack he slings  *
      down.  Gotta love Claire s smile.  Sweet and heartbreaking. *



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"       (YELLOW)      9/23/04      21.

      Thomas, moving to the kitchen, glances at the drapes.  He  *
      seems a little distracted --

                                  THOMAS
                    -- wow, we have drapes now.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (climbing down)
                    I know, I sort of feel grown up all 
                    of a sudden.  Do you like them?

                                  THOMAS
                    -- yeah, they re good.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (going through the bags)
                    I don t know why drapes represent 
                    age for me, it just... feels like 
                    something my mum would do--

      Thomas pops a beer, heads to the pantry.  Wants a snack. *

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    Sasha called-- they re going out 
                    tonight, wanted to know if we 
                    wanted to come...

      And Thomas is motionless now, staring into the pantry --

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    What?  I didn t eat all the chips, 
                    there s another bag --

                                  THOMAS
                    Claire...
                          (empty)
                    ... I can t do this.

                    D you have a bad day?  You re pale.

      She s being so loving... but the truth is, Thomas just isn t 
      here.  He turns to her.  And from his face, she just gets it.

                                  THOMAS
                    ... this isn t working.

      She stares for a long beat.  Thunderstruck.  Mortified -- *

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)*
                    -- you knew that.*

                                    CLAIRE*
                    -- I what?*

      And he s walked past her, to the window, where she just hung 
      the drapes.  He looks out.  Guilty as hell, but fronting with 
      all the pride of a young man.  Claire turns toward him -- she 
      barely moves, her whole being in shock.  Her face wracked.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)*
                    Just... so I don t over-react...

      some--

      trap you?!  Are you out of -- it s over!
      your m--

      me!-- I m outta here--

      -- he s walked past her, grabbed his keys -- now he leaves, 
      SLAMMING the door behind him.  Claire stands there, just in 
      trauma.  She cries now -- and the FINAL SHOT is WIDE, 
      Claire s belly once again silhouetted by the window light.


      CLOSE ON -- CLAIRE, writing in her journal.  Eyes bloodshot.  
      She s shaky.  Anxious.  Seen much better days.

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    Claire?

      She jumps!  Startled by his arrival.  Looks up, DESPERATE --

                                  CLAIRE
                    D you find him?

                                  JACK
                    No--

                                  CLAIRE
                    -- what if he comes back?



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"       (YELLOW)      9/23/04      28.

      Jack sits down next to her.  He s very COMPASSIONATE here --

                                  JACK
                    Claire... this situation we re in -- 
                    The crash.  That no one s come for *
                    us -- And this place...
                          (beat)
                    It can mess with your head a *
                    little.  Maybe make you see things *
                    that aren t there.  And I know it *
                    feels real...

                                  CLAIRE
                          (confused)
                    I don t...?

                                  JACK
                    Your baby s coming.  Soon.  And I *
                    can t imagine how scary that must *
                    be... but the more upset you get, *
                    the more dangerous it is for you... *
                    and the baby.*
                          (then)*
                    I want you to take these.*

      Jack holds out his hand.  TWO PILLS in his palm.*

                                  CLAIRE*
                    What is it?*

                                  JACK*
                    A sedative.  It s very mild.  *
                    Commonly used in situations like *
                    yours. *
                          (off her look)*
                    It won t hurt the baby.  I promise.*

      It takes Claire a moment to put together the implications of  *
      this.

                                  CLAIRE*
                    You... don t believe me.

      [THE REST OF SCENE 20 MISSING]
























      TIGHT ON CLAIRE as she strides out of the caves and towards 
      the JUNGLE PATH.  CLOSING IN ON HER, feeling her 
        frustration.... HER ANXIETY.  HER FEAR.  And when we can t 
      possibly get ANY CLOSER --


      Claire sits at the table, counts out two hundred Australian 
      dollars.  She is not accustomed to carrying this kind of 
      cash.  She hands Malkin the money.  He takes it.  Counts it.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (nervous smile)
                    If you re a psychic, why do you 
                    have to count the money?

                                  MALKIN
                    That s not how it works.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I was just -- I was joking.

      Malkin pockets the money.  She knows the drill, so she 
      extends her hands, palms up.  Waits.  Then withdraws them:

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    -- are you not-- ready yet?  For--?

                                  MALKIN
                    Yes.

      And she extends them again.  He takes her hands.  Holds them.

                                  CLAIRE
                    ... so... how does it work?

                                  MALKIN
                    ... I don t know.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"       (YELLOW)      9/23/04      31.
      (CONT'D):2323


      Then he closes his eyes, as he did before.  Head tilts back  *
      just a touch.  Claire watching him hopefully.  Then:

                                  MALKIN (CONT D)*
                    When did he leave you?

      And that s all it takes; tears come to her eyes.  She doesn t 
      sob, she s just saddened, and tries to keep it together.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Last week.
                          (then)
                    Was that... why you didn t want to 
                    do my reading?  Last time?

      Malkin opens his eyes -- looks at her now.

                                  MALKIN
                    Oh, no.
                          (then, back to her hands)
                    I saw something.  A sort of... 
                    blurry thing.

                                  CLAIRE
                    And... blurry s bad?

                                  MALKIN
                    ... blurry s bad...

      She waits.  And with his eyes closed again, we PUSH IN SLOWLY 
      ON MALKIN as he  sees.   And Claire can tell it s bad... and 
      Malkin almost says, under his breath,  Oh no... 

                                  MALKIN (CONT D)*
                    You want to know what to do.  About 
                    your baby.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yes.  Please.

      And we re getting CLOSER -- all SOUND FADING AWAY -- and it s 
      getting WORSE -- it s like he s sensing something TERRIBLE in 
      those palms.  The more he sees, the more HE wants to cry.  
      Finally, he looks at her.  His eyes red and worried.  A beat.

                                  MALKIN
                    ... I can tell you.*
                          (she waits)
                    ... this is... important.

                                  CLAIRE
                    ... okay...

                                  MALKIN
                          (how does he say this...?)
                    It s... crucial.  That you.  You, 
                    yourself, raise this child.

                        CLAIREMALKIN
          (staring, unsure)
      I m... you mean with Thomas?  -- The father of this child 
      Is he going to c--?will play no part in its 
                                                  life.  Or yours.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Then what do you mean  you, 
                    yourself must raise... *

                                  MALKIN
                    This child... parented by anyone *
                    else -- anyone other than you...
                          (beat, this is tough)
                    Danger surrounds this baby. *

                                  CLAIRE
                          (this is preposterous)*
                    ...  Danger ?

                                  MALKIN
                    Your nature... your spirit -- your 
                      goodness... must be an influence in 
                    the development of this child.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I-- look, if Thomas and I don t-- 
                    you know, get back together, which 
                    I don t even want... I m putting *
                    this baby up for adoption.
                          (then)
                    I just wanted to know -- What would  *
                    give the baby the happiest life.

                                  MALKIN
                    This is no happy life.  Not for 
                    this child.  Not without you.

      Now Claire is offended.  She doesn t like this at all.



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST   "Raised by Another"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)   9/21/04   33.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Listen, I don t think that--

                                  MALKIN
                    It can t be another.  YOU MUSTN T 
                    ALLOW ANOTHER TO RAISE YOUR BABY.

      Claire just looks at him for a moment.  Something authentic --  *
      genuine about what he s saying... but she doesn t want to *
      hear it.  She gets up --*

                                  CLAIRE
                    Got it.  Fantastic.  Thanks so much *
                    for taking my two hundred --*

      Malkin JUMPS UP, pulls out the MONEY and gives it back to  *
      her.  Now this has become important to him --

                                  MALKIN
                    Take it-- Ms. Littleton, I m 
                    begging you just to consider--

                                  CLAIRE

                                  MALKIN
                    Ms. Littleton, please!

      And she heads out -- they re both moving for the door -- 
      Malkin now passionate, imploring:

                                  MALKIN (CONT D)
                    I promise you -- the baby needs  *

      But she s gone now, through the front door, into the rain -- 
      and just as this spring-loaded screen door SLAMS SHUT --

      TIGHT ON CLAIRE, asleep on her back.  Her stomach now at a 
      whopping EIGHT MONTHS pregnant.  SLOWLY PUSHING IN on her as 
      the PHONE RINGS, waking her -- she reaches over -- it is (as 
      is everything) harder with that belly -- she answers it:

                                  CLAIRE
                    -- Hello?

                                  MALKIN (V.O.)
                    Ms. Littleton.  It s Richard 
                    Malkin.

      Claire s reaction indicates that he has, on a number of 
      occasions, contacted her.  She sighs, incredulous, exhausted:

                                  CLAIRE

      She stops -- this is what she needs.  But how weird is this?!

      She hangs up.  Lies there.  She won t be asleep for hours.


      Claire, at eight months with-child, sits alone on one side of 
    a conference table.  EARL SLAVITT, an attorney, and his 
      clients, ARLENE and JOSEPH STEWART, sit across from her.

                                    SLAVITT
                    Arlene and Joseph will bring you to *
                      Melbourne.  They ll pay your living 
                    and medical expenses.

                                  ARLENE
                    We found you an apartment.  It s a 
                    nice place -- it has a balcony.

      Slavitt slides the substantial contract over to her.

                                  SLAVITT
                    As discussed, once the baby is born 
                    and handed over to the Stewarts you 
                    will have no right to see the child 
                    again.

                                  ARLENE*

      Slavitt shoots Arlene a look -- shut up and let me finish.*

                    Sorry.*

                          (to Claire)*
                    You will have no right to 
                      correspond with the child and it 
                    will be entirely up to Arlene and 
                    Joseph to decide whether to tell 
                    the child anything about you.  
                      Understood?

      Claire listens, considers.  Then, staying strong:

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yes.

                                    SLAVITT
                    Upon your discharge from the 
                    hospital, you will be given an 
                      additional payment of twenty 
                    thousand dollars.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I just... just want you to take 
                    good care of the baby.

                                  ARLENE
                    Of course we will.

      Slavitt slides documents and PEN across the table to Claire.

                                    SLAVITT
                    I ll need you to sign and date

      Claire lifts up the pen, but hesitates.  Is she changing her 
      mind?  Has Malkin gotten to her?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Do you know  Catch a Falling Star?   
                    It s a song, like a lullaby?*

                                  ARLENE
                    Catch a falling star, put it in 
                    your pocket--?

                                  CLAIRE
                    My father used to sing that to me.  
                    Could you sing it for the baby?  
                    Every once in a while?

                                  ARLENE
                    Of course.

      And now, things are getting emotional.  Claire opens the 
      documents.  Finds the signature line.  Puts pen to paper.  
      Signs, BUT THERE S NO INK.  So Slavitt offers another pen -- 
      she takes it -- tries to sign.  BUT AGAIN, NO INK.  This is 
      fuckin  weird.  Arlene hands her a pen of her own.  Claire 
      takes it -- scribbles on a POST-IT.  The pen works.  And she 
      brings the pen to the page.  Is about to sign.  Everyone s 
      watching her -- waiting -- sensing that she s unable to do 
      this... finally, she stands:

                                  CLAIRE
                    I ve... I m sorry-- I m-- leaving--

      -- but Claire is up and heading out and --


      Claire stands in the middle of the over-crowded apartment 
      with Malkin.  He s handed her a small manila envelope.  She 
      pulls out six-thousand Australian dollars.  Can t believe 
      this.  Is suspicious and uneasy about it.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You ve spent the last three months *
                    telling me I need to raise the baby 
                    myself.  Now you re giving me money

                                  MALKIN
                    I ve found a couple in Los Angeles *
                    who are very eager to adopt.  The *
                    baby will be safe in their care.  
                    I ve foreseen...

                          (starting to lose it)
                    What am I even doing here?  I can t 
                    believe I m listening to --

      And Malkin shakes his head.  Empathizing.  REAL.

                                  MALKIN
                    I know it sounds ridiculous, 
                    Claire.  All of this...  psychic  
                    business.  And I appreciate that 
                    you must think I m a madman --
                          (totally genuine)
                    But this is what must happen.

      Her reaction: she doesn t believe a word.

                                  CLAIRE
                    So you re giving me six-thousand 
                    dollars to give my baby to a pair 
                    of strangers in Los Angeles.

                                  MALKIN
                      Twelve-thousand.  The other six 
                    when you get to Los Angeles.  And 
                    they re not strangers -- They re 
                    good people.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (considers; then)
                    How do you know I won t just take 
                    the six and run?

                                  MALKIN
                    Because I know your soul.  I know 
                    your honesty.  That if you promise 
                    me you ll go... you will.
