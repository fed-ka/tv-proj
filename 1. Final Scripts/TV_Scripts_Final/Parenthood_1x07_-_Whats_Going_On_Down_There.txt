      FADE IN:

      INT. YOGA STUDIO - DAY (DI)11

      An earthy Bay Area yoga studio.  Painted with bright 
        colors and funky kid-friendly designs.  CROSBY and JABBAR 
        are the lone father/son team in a sea of YOGA MOMS and 
        their KIDS enjoying an afternoon of frolic and delight at 
         Mommy and Me Yoga .  The entire class is on all fours.  

                                        YOGA INSTRUCTOR
                      Now breathe in, finding a spot in front 
                      of you to focus on.

        Crosby s eyes focus on AN ASS.  A good one.  Clad in 
        spandex.  We ll come to find this ass belongs to a hot 
      yoga mom named VALERIE.

                                        YOGA INSTRUCTOR (CONT D)
                      Inhale arching up like a cat.  Exhale 
                      extending out like a cow.

        Valerie cycles through Cat and Cow Pose jutting her ass 
      up and down right in Crosby s face.  Crosby turns to 
        Jabbar who is also doing Cat and Cow.    

                                        CROSBY
                      You were right, Jabbar.  Yoga is fun.  

                                        JABBAR
                      Shhh.  You re not supposed to talk.

                                        YOGA INSTRUCTOR
                      Hips up into downward facing dog.

        Crosby, confused, remains on all fours.  Valerie pops up 
          effortlessly.  From this angle she looks at Crosby 
        through spread legs.  Their eyes meet.  Is she 
          intentionally staring at him?  

                                        JABBAR
                      Dad, you re doing it wrong.

        The class cycles through a Vinyasa.  When they return to 
      down dog...

                                        VALERIE
                      How old s your son?

                                        JABBAR
                                (shushing him)
                      Daaaad.

                      And he takes his yoga very seriously.  

        Valerie s son, MILO, speaks up.

                                        MILO
                      I m five too.

                                        VALERIE
                      Jabbar, I think this is what the yogis 
                      would call fate.  Would you boys like to 
                      come over for a playdate?

        Crosby nods subtly at Jabbar.  Come on.  Say yes.

                                        JABBAR
                      Okay.  

        Valerie gives Crosby a playful wink and the Instructor s 
        voice takes over...

                      Breathe out... Deep relaxing sigh... 

      As Crosby lets out a long relaxing sigh...

                                                                              PRELAP:

                      You have to breathe, Adam.


        INT/EXT. ADAM AND KRISTINA S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY22

        A disaster area.  Old sports equipment and file boxes 
        insure no car will ever park here.  ADAM has lined up the 
      four Braverman family bikes which are all in various 
        stages of disrepair.  KRISTINA, rifling through a 
        Goodwill box of old clothes, watches over his shoulder as 
      he struggles to pull the chain back on Max s bike.    

                                        ADAM
                      Almost there.  Almost there.
                                (losing it)
                      Dammit!

        Kristina moves aside Adam s old surfboard and uncovers 
        the GOODWILL BOX.  She digs out a pair of her old HEELS.

                                        KRISTINA (CONT D)
                                (calling into the house)

                                        ADAM
                      Have you looked at our family calendar 
                      lately?  Between Max s new schedule, my 
                      work, Haddie s school commitments and of 
                      course... 
                              (with disdain)
                       Steve time .  That only leaves three 
                      hours a week where the entire family is 
                      free.  

                                        KRISTINA
                      But does it have to be spent on bikes?

        HADDIE appears in the doorway.

                                        HADDIE
                      What s up?

        Kristina holds up the shoes.  Adam continues struggling 
      with the chain throughout the following.  

                                        KRISTINA
                      What about these for tomorrow?  They were 
                      in the Goodwill.

                                        HADDIE
                      You re not serious.  Mom, Aunt Julia 
                      works in a real office.  

                                        KRISTINA
                      I wore these real places.

                                        ADAM 
                      What is she talking about?

                                        KRISTINA
                      She s spending a day at work with your 
                      sister.  

                                        HADDIE
                      It s career week.  I get to take Monday 
                      off to shadow someone in a career of my 
                      choosing.

                                        ADAM

                              (to Kristina)
                      Am I obligated to answer that?

        Suddenly the chain snaps into place.  

                                        ADAM 
                      I got it!  I got it!  Did you see that?  

                                        KRISTINA
                      Yeah, honey.  It was awesome.  

                                        HADDIE
                      Oh God.  This is one of those Braverman 
                      family fun things, isn t it?

                                        ADAM
                      Yes.  It is.  Prepare for an epic 
                      afternoon of fun and togetherness.    

                                        HADDIE
                      I m seeing a movie at five with Steve.  
                      Mom already gave me permission.  

      Adam shoots a look to Kristina who just shrugs.

                                        KRISTINA

                      That still leaves us fifty-two minutes

                      Maybe we should do this another time.

                      we re really making strides on his

                      Okay.  Can we start reading then?

      This is a victory and Adam knows it.  It kills him, but 
      he looks to Gaby and motions for her to continue their 
        lesson.

                      allowed to say no.  

        Sarah takes her watch off and hands it to Amber.

        sighs and goes back to her closet.

                      Which is ridiculously cute.  But I really 
                      want to hold your hand.  And it makes it 
                      kinda hard to make a stealth move.  So I

                      Because it would be a total waste if you

      INT. ROOSEVELT HIGH SCHOOL - MR. CYR S CLASSROOM - DAY88

      It s lunchtime and Amber is perched Indian style atop a 
        student desk.  Mr. Cyr sits atop his own desk holding up 
        a VOCAB CARD -- OBSTREPEROUS.  Even though they re 
        studying, the vibe is light and teasing.  

                                        AMBER
                      Crap.  Wait.  I totally know this one.

                                        MR. CYR
                      Come on, Amber.  SATs are in five days.

                      everyday speech like you said.  
                      Seriously.  Call my mom for proof.  

        Mr. Cyr looks away.  Quickly changes the subject. 

                                        MR. CYR 
                      Do you have your iPod with you?

        Amber isn t sure where this is going.

                                        AMBER
                      No...  MP3 players aren t allowed on 
                      school grounds.

                      Come on.  I know you re packing.

      He holds out his hand.  Amber reluctantly pulls her iPod 
        out of her backpack.  

                                        AMBER
                      So just because I forget on one word you 
                      rob me of my ability to block out 
                        distractions. 

                                        MR. CYR
                      You re not being punished.  In fact I ve 
                      been pretty blown away with how hard 
                      you re working.  So I got you a present.  

        Mr. Cyr plugs Amber s iPod into his MAC.  She walks 
        behind him and puts her hand on his chair to see.  The 
        closeness registers on her face.  Oblivious to her raging 
      teen hormones, Mr. Cyr downloads a playlist simply titled 
        For Amber.PARENTHOOD   -   01007/107   -   REVISED 2ND BLUE   -   2/26/10       12

                      should help.

        Mr. Cyr hands back the iPod.  Their hands overlap for 
      just a second before she takes it.

        ANGLE ON THE BAR

        Where Gaby is dancing with a gaggle of girlfriends.  
        She s carefree.  And loud.  Everything she s not at work.  
        She holds up her shot and throws it back like a pro.  The 
        girls squeal and call for another round.  

      Adam watches with confusion.  And intrigue.  And 
        jealousy.

                      And a virgin pina colada for you, sir.

      Adam turns to see the Waitress standing there with a 
        froufrou drink teeming with whipped cream and a parasol.  
      As Adam wonders when this became his life...

                      Oh God.  How many margaritas did you 
                      have?

                      Oh yeah.  And if two margaritas can do 
                      this to a man, I can only imagine what 
                      ten tequila shots looks like.

        Crosby lets JASMINE in.  Crosby is holding a sleeping 
        Jabbar in his arms, Jabbar s little hands draped over 
        Crosby s shoulders -- the adorable quotient is high, and 
        Jasmine is touched as hell.

                                        JASMINE
                      Looks like you boys had a big day.

        Crosby tries to place Jabbar into Jasmine s arms.  
        There s some tangling, some rejiggering, and a whole lot 
      of touching.  Crosby and Jasmine s arms are now 
        completely intertwined.

                      Wait.  His hair is caught on my watch.  

      Some more maneuvering.  Jasmine starts to laugh which has 
        the unintended but adorable affect of shaking the still 
        sleeping Jabbar.

                      Stop laughing.  You re shaking him.

        But Crosby can t help it and joins in.  Crosby looks up 
        and meets Jasmine s eyes.  Suddenly the laughter stops 
        and the moment becomes loaded.  Could a kiss be coming?  
        But Jabbar s hair comes loose.  He stirs and puts his 
        little arms around Jasmine s neck.  

                                        JASMINE

                      Oh my god.  These are the minutes from

                      introducing an ordinance to reduce the 
                      number or roadside billboards.

      back to work standing before her in a pirate costume.  
        She somehow manages a big cheery smile.

      INT. MR. CYR S APARTMENT - NIGHT (N4)3232

        The apartment of a bibliophile.  Small but cozy and 
        filled with books.  Sarah and Mr. Cyr are walking in 
        through the front door.

                      What about wanting to spend more time 
                      with your girl?

        She looks at him.  There s something vulnerable in her 
        eyes.  Which make him see her a little like a daughter, 
        which he hates.

                      You re not just some lawyer, Julia.  You 
                      are going places.  Let s back burner the 
                      pro bono work.  Plenty of time for that 
                      down the road.  

      As in never.  As Julia takes this in, Jack (the assistant 
      from earlier) walks in with two lattes.  As he hands the 
        latte to Julia:

                      Extra foamy.

        Julia sips from her latte, the excitement about her 
        promising future tempered by the fact that she is sort of 
        working for the wrong side.

      INT. ZEEK AND CAMILLE S HOUSE - AMBER S ROOM - AFTERNOON3838

        Amber looks up from her book to see an intense Sarah 
        looming in the doorway.

        Sarah sits at the edge of the bed.  Tries to find the 
        words but it s taking a little longer.

                      Sarah, I really like you.

                                        SARAH
                      I know.  It sucks.

        Sarah musters everything and leaves.  Makes the mistake 
      of looking back.  Damn, he s cute.  OFF Sarah, heart 
        breaking...

      INT. ZEEK AND CAMILLE S - DOWNSTAIRS - MORNING (D6)4141

      It s early.  Ungodly early.  The morning stillness is 
        punctuated by a sharp WHIRRING SOUND.

      We find Sarah sharpening a stack of Number 2 Pencils.  
        Amber, still groggy, comes down the stairs emerges.

                                        AMBER
                                (seeing Sarah)
                      What are you doing up so early?

                                        SARAH
                      I know you have your SAT this morning.  I 
                      made coffee.  And I know you always say 
                      you hate breakfast but I thought maybe 
                      you would consider eating a protein bar.  

        Sarah hands over a travel coffee mug and a protein bar.  

                                        AMBER
                      I m not hungry.

        Sarah gives her the pencils.  

                                        SARAH
                      Here.  So you ll have plenty of backups.

                                        AMBER
                      I ve got it under control, Mom.  

        Amber leaves without taking any of Sarah s offerings.  

                                        SARAH
                      Amber!

        Amber turns around.  There s so much Sarah wants to say.  
        But she can t seem to muster any of it. 

                                        SARAH (CONT D)
                      Good luck.

        And Amber s gone.

      EXT. BERKELEY - PUBLIC COURTYARD - DAY4343

      Adam and Haddie ride their bikes and stop at a really 
      nice public courtyard in front of a behemoth modern 
        business building.  They come to a stop.  There s a beat, 
        then, very simply:

                                        ADAM
                      I want you to know that your mother is 
                      amazing.

        Haddie feels a bit trapped.

                                        HADDIE
                      Is this about the remark about her 
                      spaghetti?  I can t believe how sensitive 
                      you guys are.  Look, I know she s an 
                      amazing mom, okay?  I m trying to be 
                      fifteen here, and not like express that 
                      on a daily basis.

                                        ADAM
                      She s more than an amazing mom.  
                      See this place?  The play area, the 
                      benches, the trees, the landscaping.

                                        HADDIE
                      Uh-huh...?

                                        ADAM
                      The company that built this building 
                      wanted to use every inch of this land for 
                      offices.  Your mother got in there and 
                      fought them.  She got them to put up two 
                      hundred thousand dollars to make this.  
                      Without your mom, this wouldn t be here. 

        Haddie takes it in -- kids play on a play structure, 
        people sit on benches talking, hanging together. 

                                        HADDIE
                      Wow. That s so Erin Brokovich.

                                        ADAM
                      So now you know what your mom did.

        Haddie looks around, taking it in.  Adam looks at Haddie.  
        His beautiful, smart, lovely daughter.  Takes her in.  
      Then simply--

                                        ADAM (CONT D)
                      Thank you.

                                        ADAM
                      For coming out here with me.  I know 
                      there are other things you d rather be 
                      doing with your Saturday.

        Sensing this is a moment for her Dad...

                                        HADDIE
                      No, there aren t.  

      Adam is touched.  Bittersweet.  He knows that she s aware 
      of his vulnerability, that he s on borrowed time with his 
        daughter.  On cue, Haddie s phone RINGS with a hip hop 
      ring tone that Adam knows all too well.  

                                        ADAM

                      He was going to call if he got done with 
                      basketball practice early.  So we could 
                      hang out.  But it s cool.  I ll tell him 
                      I m busy.

      Adam breathes in the air for a beat, then...

                                        ADAM
                      Get out of here.

        Out of said shit car, DAMIEN emerges.  Amber throws her 
      arms around him, finally letting it all out.  She s 
        fighting tears.

                      Things here suck.

                                        DAMIEN
                      Hey.  It s okay.  I m here now.

      He smooths her hair back and holds her close.  


      INT. ADAM AND KRISTINA S HOUSE - DAY4747

        Kristina folds laundry when a Peet's Coffee latte appears 
      in front of her as if by magic.  She turns around to find 
        Haddie with STEVE, holding their own Peet's Coffee.

                                        KRISTINA
                                (reading label)
                      A decaf sugar-free vanilla latte.  Wow.  
                      What did I do to deserve this?

                                        HADDIE
                      We stopped off at Peet's Coffee and I 
                      thought you might want your usual.  No 
                      big deal.  

        But to Kristina, it s a huge deal.  She takes a sip.

                                        STEVE
                      Did you know the sugar-free syrups are 
                      actually worse for you than the regular 
                      ones?

                                        KRISTINA
                      No, Steve.  I didn t.  But thanks for 
                      letting me know.  

                                        HADDIE

                      Later, Kristina.

                                (calling after them)
                      Leave the door open!  And what happened 
                      to your dad?

                                        HADDIE
                      I dunno.  We split up hours ago.  

        Haddie and Steve continue upstairs.  Now curious, 
        Kristina tries calling Adam s cell phone.  It rings.  And 
        rings.  And rings.  The ringing takes us to...  


      EXT. BEACH - DAY4848

        Adam s phone rings from where it s been dropped on the 
        shore alone with his car keys and a towel.

        OUT IN THE WATER 

      Adam sits perched across his old surfboard.  Looking out 
      at the horizon, waiting for the perfect wave.   

      As we WIDEN to take it all in, we can hear the ringing 
        phone that Adam can t.

                                        PHONE (V.O.)
                      Ten new messages.

                                        KRISTINA (V.O.)
                      It s me.  Just wondering where you are.  
                      Haddie s back.  And she brought me a 
                      latte.  It put me in the best mood.  Is 
                      that sad that a latte made my day?  Love 
                      you so much.  Bye.  
                                (then, remembering)
                      Oh.  And can you remember to change the 
                      lightbulb in the bathroom when you get 
                      home.

                      Adam.  Major life crisis.  Where are you?

                                        SARAH (V.O.)
                      It s Sarah.  I m freaking out.  Have you 
                      seen Amber?  

                                        JULIA (V.O.)
                      Adam, Julia.  Do you think I m shallow?  
                      This shallow person?  Because I m not.

                      I m not shallow.  But what am I supposed 
                      to do, give up my badass career to take 
                      on pro bono cases?  You can t have it 
                      all, right?  No one can have it all.  By 
                      the way, where the hell are you?  I ve 
                      called like five times.  This is 
                        unacceptable.

                                        CROSBY (V.O.)
                      Dude, I m serious this time.  Pick up.  
                      Pick up?  Why am I talking like it s 1993 
                      and you ve got an answering machine.  
                      Whatever.  Just call me.    

        And eventually the sound fades.  Until all we hear are 
        the waves and the seagulls.  

                                                                            FADE OUT.
