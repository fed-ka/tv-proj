In darkness, chemicals wash over a copper plate. Strange
silvery patterns evolve in the half-light.

A door opens and a figure in black, hurries past, clutching
a number of prepared photographic plates in their light
proof cases.
TECHNICIAN
Not long now. I shall be with you
immediately...
ANNIE DARWIN, wearing in a checkered dress, aged about 9
years old, sits looking straight at camera.
She has short hair and a pretty oval face
On her lap there is a posy of artificial flowers, in the
background an improbable vista of jagged mountain.
PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)
Ready now. Very still please.
ANNIE
Will this hurt, papa?
DARWIN
No. It is only a beam of light.
ANNIE
How can light make a picture.
DARWIN
Well they prepare a copper plate
with chemicals on it. The
chemicals are sort of energized
by the light reflecting off your
face.
Then silver sticks onto the plate
according to where the light is
brightest.
ANNIE
Betty was worried it would hurt.
....What a little duck she is.
DARWIN
So as I was saying, Captain
Fitzroy went ashore to interview
the Fuegans....

7
Below decks: a slapstick struggle with soap and scrubbing
brushes - much biting kicking and howling - as sailors
scrub the children clean.
SAILORS
Ow! Shite! Hold still ye maggot!
DARWIN
The captain had them washed and
got their hair cut, then dressed
them in proper clothes, and
taught them proper table manners.
8
DAY
8
The children, cleaned and dressed,
seem happy enough in
their new situation.
They sit at the captain's table clumsily sawing with a
knife and chasing Brussel sprouts around a plate with their
cutlery.
A sprout shoots off the table

Jemmy Buttons, looking very smart in velvet suit with
silver buttons gives proper bow and shakes the Royal hand.
Fuegia Basket curtsies.
Queen Victoria remains out of shot but her attendants hand
out presents off a purple silk cushion: A Bible for Fuegia
and a telescope for Jemmy
12
13
Annie suspects there is a joke coming and cant help her
mouth from twitching the corners.
DARWIN
(laughing)
Correct! A complete and total
failure!

14
15
Darwin still laughing, dabs his eyes
ANNIE
(laughing)
Yaaah!
The photographer disappears behind black curtains.
TECHNICIAN
Very still now. No more talking
please
Annie composes her face in an expression of angelic
seriousness.
A glass dome above her head glows snapdragon blue
Close on Darwin watching his daughter, his eyes still damp
with tears of laughter.
Electricity hums. The strange blue light glows brighter,
brighter... Brighter.
The image of his daughter imprints on Darwin's memory. Just
so. Forever.
16
16
Servants are laying a table for dinner
Gas lamps and the coal fire struggle to illuminate the
lofty room.
7
Mrs Davies the Welsh cook, bangs the dinner gong and shouts
across the darkening garden outside.
MR DAVIES (O.S.)
Children! Franky! Horace! Dinner!
Darwins attractive wife Emma adjusts the lamps and the boys
run in, Franky aged 10 Lenny aged 8 Horace aged 6.
LENNY
Mama mama.
EMMA
Yes. What is it
LENNY
Horace says he's six feet tall.
EMMA
Have you all washed your hands.
HORACE
He said I have to be or I can't
join the army.
EMMA
First things first. An officer
must always tuck his shirt in.
Their elder sisters Betty and Etty take their places at
table
BETTY
The boys made a camp with a camp-
fire
LENNY
Oh! Sneak!
EMMA
Where's the campfire.
BETTY
In the summer house but Brodie
put it out.
Parslow enters with the turreen
EMMA
Thank-you Parslow. Where is Mr
Darwin?
PARSLOW
He was killing pigeons Ma'am
EMMA
Will everybody sit down please.
8
As they are pulling in their chairs, Darwin enters, drying
his hands on his trousers.
He's aged ten years since we last saw him and has lost his
former air of gaiety.
He sits, with a distracted nod to the family.
PARSLOW
Soup du jour, sir
The children smile at Parslow's air of earnest formality
but the atmosphere even among the younger kids is sombre
and subdued.
DARWIN
Thank you Parslow
He butters some bread and starts eating. Emma clears her
throat.
DARWIN.
Oh.
The children bow their heads. The bread stick in darwins
mouth. Emma says grace.
EMMA
Lord God who watches over all
that we do. Bless this family and
the food we eat. In Jesus name.
Amen.
Everyone repeats the "Amen" except Darwin.
EMMA
I hear Mr Hooker is coming
tomorrow.
The children prick up their ears at this. They like Hooker
DARWIN
He won't stay long.
EMMA
Did he say what it was about?
DARWIN
I think this is not the time to
discuss it.
EMMA
Maybe the time to discuss it was
before you invited him.
DARWIN
He sent a telegram. I'm sorry if
it inconveniences you.
9
Emma purses her lips and turns her attention back to the
children
EMMA
Eat your soup now.
Darwin takes a couple of spoonfuls, pauses, as a wave of
nausea sweeps over him, then pushes away the dish.
DARWIN
(To Parslow)
Tell Mr Davies it was delicious,
but my stomach is not quite right
yet.
(To Emma)
Excuse me.
He gets up and leaves. As soon as he has gone, the children
natural talkativeness reasserts itself.
CHILDREN
Can we take Mr Hooker to the
Chalk pits. Why can't he stay.
Can we pick blackberries?
EMMA
I think he is just here to work
17
THE PAST. NIGHT
18
Darwin aged 40 - bright-eyed and inquisitive leans over to
examine something, offering it his finger tip while making
little tut tut tut noises.
In the cot is a one-month old baby.
DARWIN
Annie. Annie. Annie.
The piano music continuing over, as her fist closes round
the end of his finger, then tries to pull it towards her
mouth.
He pulls it away from her and she frowns.
He offers it again and the tug of war becomes a game.
Baby Annie laughs.
Darwin writes something in his notebook. Then tucks his
pencil behind his ear and tries out various facial
expressions - scowling, smiling - to gauge the baby's
response.
11
Emma turns on the piano-stool.
EMMA
(affectionately)
What are you doing?
DARWIN
Just playing.
She comes over and, leaning against him, reads from his
notebook.
EMMA
"Six weeks: Gurgles. Holds tight
to my finger. Tries to suck.
Smiles at my smile"
The baby lets out a long yodel of pleasure
DARWIN
I should add that she is musical.
EMMA
I hope you do not plan to treat
all our children as little
animacules to be included in your
experiments.
DARWIN
Do you mean there will be more.
EMMA
I assumed that's what you wanted.
Of course, if the idea doesn't
appeal then...
DARWIN
Appeal? Dearest cousin. I am
making plans for an army!
He takes Emma in his arms. She gives a little squeak -
caught off balance then laughing as he waltzes her around
the room, singing.
19
22
The figure in silhouette of young Darwin inspects a flask
of sea water, glowing in the darkness.
He takes a few drops on a watch glass and places them on
the illuminated stage of his microscope.
Under the microscope, against a black background, millions
of tiny swimming animals.
23
25
Darwin wakes in sudden terror.
Dawn light illuminates the wallpaper in front of him - a
William Morris design of interweaving vines.
Emma, is asleep in her night-cap at his side.
Darwin lies for a while in the semi darkness, until his
hand, fluttering on the coverlet, becomes still at last.
26
26
Light and noise.
Crash of gleaming copperware, clattering of water in the
pipes as the servants prepare Sunday breakfast
The cook, Mrs Davies looks out through a steamed up window
to see the angular figure of Charles Darwin, bent almost
double inspecting a tiny segment of lawn.
Brodie joins Mrs Davies at the window.
MRS DAVIES
What is he doing now, exactly?
BRODIE
Cutting the grass with nail
scissors.
MRS DAVIES
Such a shame he never had a
proper job. At least your Mr
Thackeray had his books to write.
18
27
27
Children thunder up and down the stairs between Brodie who
is doing a final check on grooming and Emma who is
marshalling them in the hall.
28
28
EMMA
Chop chop Georgie. Socks! And you
have not buttoned your trousers.
Baby Lenny starts crying and she goes to comfort him
29
29
Brodie is arranging hair and tying ribbons for Annie (9)
Etty (6) and Betty (3)
ANNIE
Did you never think of getting
married Miss Brodie.
BRODIE
Once. But he went to Australia
and I missed my chance.
Willy passes the door, his hair in need of brushing.
BRODIE
Master William. Hairbrush.
William comes in. Brodie brushes the back of his hair.
WILLY
Ow. Ow!
BRODIE
Well what do you expect. It is a
birds nest.
WILLY
Papa says God doesn't care if we
are neat.
BRODIE
(brushing)
Your father is a very wize man
but has a small understanding of
religion. No-one can read what
goes down in Gods great book of
accounts. ....Fingernails.
Willy presents them for checking.
19
BRODIE
You can go.
30
30
The children come racing and swinging and clattering down
the stairs.
Emma, holding the baby in one arm, steers a tricycle out of
the way, clearing a path to the door
EMMA
Mrs Davies, Will you ask Jenny to
wear a bonnet. I would not like
people to think her fast.
George aged 5 tugs at her skirt
WILLY
Can I bring my mouse for a
blessing?
EMMA
What mouse?
George (5) pulls it out from his pocket. Its dead, muddy
and bloody
GEORGE
Elsie caught it in the barn. We
need to pray for his soul
EMMA
Mice don't have souls. Leave it
on the window sill. Everyone come
now or we shall be late.
31
34
In darkness, a furious struggle, squawking and frantically
beating wings.
Darwin seizes on a dove and backs out of the dovecote, the
silhouette of his upper torso taking shape in the square
hole in the floor.
He climbs down the ladder, passes the captive bird down to
Parslow, then climbs back up and pushes him upper body into
the dovecot again, in search of the next victim.
35
37
Emma is by the kitchen window, rearranging tea things on a
tray.
The sky outside is dark and lowering.
Through the window she can see Darwin heading off down the
sand walk - head bowed, walking stick in hand - deep in
conversation with Huxley.
She drops a tea-cup which smashes on the stone floor.
MRS DAVIES
I'll do that ma'am. Please. Let
me do it.
38
40
The coach pulls away.
Looking back though the rear window Hooker sees Emma with
the boys clustered around her skirts.
HUXLEY
What did she say to you?
HOOKER
That it was killing him.
HUXLEY
A mighty slow death considering
the time he's spent. We'll be
dead and buried ourselves if he
prevaricates much longer.
Huxley takes off his spectacles and polishes them,
embarrassed by Huxley's directness, inspecting his own
conscience in the bevelled glass.
41
41
In the darkened study, with his specimens and books all
around him, Darwin kneels by the box.
Steeling himself, he unlocks the padlock and opens the lid
and takes out the papers and notebooks which are stored
there.
The bulk of it is a single manuscript, accumulated over
many years, divided into 14 chapters with pages of notes
interleaved.
The Chapters are headed. Variation under domestication,
variation under nature, Struggle for Existence, Natural
Selection....
A noise behind him almost makes him jump out of his skin.
Its Annie, ten years old in her checked dress, as she will
always be in his imagination.
28
ANNIE
Why are you scared?
DARWIN
Like you said. You're in it.
ANNIE
Its only a book, silly.
He sits there regarding the open box, paralysed by
indecision. Annie tenderly smooths his hair, rearranging
his collar.
DARWIN
What are you doing, Annie?
ANNIE
I'm making you beautiful.
DARWIN
I have to work.
Though the soft touch of her little hands is almost too
real for him to bear and he closes his eyes
ANNIE
Breath in, papa. Breathe out. Now
Tell me a story.
DARWIN
I have no time....
ANNIE
About Jenny. Please?
The sound of a wave breaking. Wind stirs Darwin's hair
He opens his eyes and he is ....
42
45
The cage is lowered by a crane. Jenny looks out from her
swaying prison at spinning grey skies and brick warehouses.
46
46
Now she sits disconsolately in a corner of her permanent
enclosure.
She has been dressed, ridiculously and poignantly in a
smock and a bonnet.
A group of onlookers are trying to get a reaction out of
her. Eventually they give up and move on.
DARWIN
In London she had many admirers -
of whom your father was but one.
Darwin moves forwards from the shadows, where he has been
observing and taking notes.
As the other humans move away be attempts to start a
conversation with Jenny in her own language, much in the
way he communicated with baby Annie.
31
DARWIN
Hoo hoo hoo hoo.
Jenny regards him sceptically then looks away.
DARWIN.
HOO!!
She startles and looks at him aggressively.
DARWIN
Hm?
He reaches in his pocket. This gets her interest. She comes
closer, expecting food.
Darwin takers out a sprig of verbena - a strongly scented
herb.
He holds in front of his nose and inhales, making contented
expressions of pleasure.
Jenny watches.
Darwin holds the verbena towards Jenny.
Cautiously she extends a hand through the bars.
Their fingers touch in space, like God Giving life to Adam.
For Darwin its a breakthrough - a moment of connection.
Jenny eats the verbena and spits it out, shrieking angrily.
CHARLES
Wait, sorry, wait - I've got
something else here for you
He reaches in his pocket. She cocks her head, alert.
With the air of a conjurer, he pulls out:
A child's hand mirror, flashing as it catches the sun
through the skylights.
CHARLES
(pleasurable surprise)
Ahhhh!!
He shows Jenny her own reflection and, then hands the
mirror through the bars.
Jenny takes the mirror, bites it, discovers it is inedible,
and smashes it on the ground.
Charles makes a sad, whining sound
CHARLES
Hew Hew Hew...
32
JENNY
(pouting)
Hmph.
Meaning: "OK then, I'm sorry."
It's such a complex human reaction - grudging contrition -
that Charles laughs aloud with pleasure.
Jenny laughs.
Charles takes out a mouth organ and plays a snatch of
Chopin.
Jenny covers her ears and chatters. "Not listening not
listening!"
Charles, insulted, stops playing.
Jenny laughs waves a hand as if to say: "Play, if it amuses
you. I'm must kidding."
47
48
It opens wider to reveal Emma's elegant profile, framed
against the gaslight of the hallway.
33
Her POV: the black box is unlocked and open, its contents
strewn around the floor at darwins feet.
Darwin is sitting on the floor of the study holding in his
had a magazine, published by the Society for the useful
Distribution of Knowledge, with a picture of Jenny on the
cover
EMMA
Are you coming to bed?
DARWIN
Presently.
He doesn't move. She comes in
EMMA
What did Huxley want?
DARWIN
He thinks I should write it and
be done with it. He feels it is a
question of moral courage ...or
the lack of it.
EMMA
You did not tell him about your
health.
DARWIN
His theory is that I am making
myself ill by holding back. That
I should lance the boil. Plunge
in and hang the consequences.
EMMA
Thank the Lord he is not a
surgeon.
Darwin takes a breath and plunges in himself:
DARWIN
I've concluded he is right. Bite
the gag. Speed is everything. It
will all be over in a matter of
months.
Emma is horrified.
EMMA
It is not mere months that
concern me Charles. Nor even
years or decades...
Its said quietly but with genuine anguish. To Emma it is
as though her life partner has announced he's contemplating
suicide.
34
EMMA
Do you really care
so little for
your immortal soul
- for the
knowledge that you
and I may
never be together,
in all of
eternity.
DARWIN
(softly)
You know that what concerns you
concerns me also. What do think
has held me in limbo all these
years.
Emma has. They both know it. She turns abruptly from the
door and hurries away.
49
49
Emma has been crying. She lies in bed pretending to sleep.
Darwin gets into bed behind her. He wants desperately to
reach out a hand to touch her, to comfort her, but he
cannot do it for fear of weakening his own fragile resolve.
DARWIN
Dearest Emma. You know This is
not a decision made lightly....
50
50
In the dawn light, Darwin is writing a letter to his wife.
DARWIN (V.O.)
.... It has been a very slow and
gradual process, like the raising
of continents.
51
53
The church is packed for the Sunday Morning service
The Darwin family stand in the front row.
Emma, the servants and the rest of the family are singing
lustily: Parslow - a somewhat pompous operatic tenor,
Brodie and Innes both loudly Scottish (Innes out of tune),
Annie by Darwins side, trilling along in a tuneful little
descant.
She notices her father is not singing and offers him her
hymn book with the words.
Darwin smiles and returns it. Its not that he doesn't know
the lyrics, its just that he can't bring himself to say
them.
DARWIN FAMILY
All things bright and beautiful
all creatures great and small.
All things wize and wonderful the
Lord God made them all.
The organ, played by Mrs Innes,
wheezes to a pause. Innes
himself mounts the pulpit.
INNES
Let us pray.
Everyone bows their heads in prayer.
INNES (CONT'D)
Lord God we know the world is
governed by Thy plan.
Darwin is immediately not listening.
36
He looks along the row of his children, standing dutifully
in a line between Charles and Emma.
George, aged 5, is studying the woodlice which are nesting
between the pages of his hymnal
INNES (O.S)
Extending even to the merest
creatures thou hast made, such
that even a sparrow falls not to
the ground without thy will.
Darwin, stands watching the play of light from the stained
glass window on his shoes. Then raises his head
INNES
Teach us that all misfortune.
All sickness and death, all the
trials and miseries of which we
daily complain are intended for
our good, being not the vagaries
of an uncaring universe but the
corrections of a wize and
affectionate parent
Innes looks up sternly and sees the Darwin's head raised
among the sea of down-turned heads.
Their eyes meet briefly in a sort of challenge, and in that
moment, Darwin somehow knows with absolutely certainty that
religious faith has left him.
With a whispered word to the beadle standing next to him to
take the collection Darwin slips out from the pew and heads
off up the aisle.
DARWIN
Excuse me
He's intending to be quiet and subtle but the creaking
boards under his feet loudly announce his departure.
Innes raises his voice above the fusillade.
INNES
Turn with me now to the book of
Job, Chapter Two verse twelve
The congregation, not daring to raise their heads, watch
Darwin's sturdy walking shoes departing down the aisle.
54
56
Darwin is ten years younger, pacing in the same, measured
way through summer woodland.
There's a noise behind him and he turns, finger to his lips
for silence.
Annie turns away from him and passes the sign down the line
of children: Etty, George, Betty and Franky, in decreasing
order of height.
ANNIE
Shh
FRANKY
(to ANNIE)
What are we looking at?
38
The question comes back up the line
DARWIN
A weasel.
The children bunch up to gaze on a strange and wonderful
sight.
In a little sun-dappled clearing a weasel is turning loop
the loops in a strange spiralling dance for the benefit
of...
...a young rabbit, which sits utterly hypnotized by the
performance.
At first its strange and amusing, then the dance becomes
more sinister. The weasel advancing by tiny increments as
it tumbles in the air, finally
ANNIE
NO!
The weasel seizes the bunny rabbit by the back of the neck
and shakes it savagely.
The rabbit shrieks and spasms.
Annie is beside herself, drumming the ground with her feet
in a fever of fear and pity.
The rabbit is still in its dearth throes, its neck broken,
its back legs still jerking
ANNIE
No! No! Stop it. Daddy. Stop it.
Make it stop.
The rabbit is already dead.
DARWIN
Annie, Annie, Annie.
He sinks to his knees, heedless of the mud on his Sunday
best worsted, embracing her.
The others are shocked and amazed by the rabbits death, but
none of them distressed as Annie. They are country children
and death is an everyday event
GEORGE
The chickens do that too when
cookie kills them
ANNIE
(tearful furious)
Chickens are different!
(To her father)
(MORE)
39
ANNIE (cont'd)
Why didn't you do something. You
should have stopped it!
DARWIN
The weasel has to eat. Its the
way of the world. Annie
ANNIE
Its not fair. Its not fair.
DARWIN
No, its not fair at all.
Patting her and stroking her as the little sobs subside.
The weasel is dragging the dead rabbit back to its lair.
DARWIN
....but still it is
extraordinary, do you not think,
that a weasel should learn to
dance the polka.
Despite herself the concept amuses Annie. Chest still
heaving with sobs - she dries her eyes and smiles at him
through her tears.
57
57
Piano music - Chopin - plays softly over as Charles and
Emma do the rounds of their large brood of children,
turning out lamps and kissing sleeping heads, taking a doll
from one sleeping child's embrace, a sword from another.
Shooing a cat and her kittens from the bedroom.
EMMA
Good-night Lenny.
DARWIN
Good-night Frankie
EMMA
Good-night Betty.
Darwin watches his wife, a sensuous figure, stooped over
the sleeping child, a lock of hair falling forwards as she
kisses her.
DARWIN
Good-night George
EMMA
Good-night Etty.
DARWIN
Good-night Willy
40
DARWIN AND EMMA
Good-night Annie
She's sound asleep. Finally Charles and Emma are alone
together in the blissfully silent house.
Emma smiles
EMMA
Dear Charles
DARWIN
Dearest Emma
He takes her hand and leads her to their bedroom.
58
60
The black box lies open with all its secrets strewn around
the office.
Stacks of paper - a stack for every chapter - are held down
with paperweights - a fossil, a skull, a specimen bottle.
Darwin squares a stack of blank paper between his hands,
then reaches for his pen.
61
61
Annie reaches for her pen.
43
Reverend Innes is giving the children their writing
lessons, according to "Mulhauser's technique"
INNES
First positions.
The children assume the position as if in some militaristic
drill.
INNES
Second positions.
Grips are adjusted, pens are dipped.
INNES
Assume the distance.
The children lean back fractionally, so their elbows are
just back from the edge of the desk.
INNES
.....and begin.
The Children start to copy the sentence which Innes has
written on the blackboard.
Annie reads the sentence and hesitates: "And on the seventh
day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested"
62
INT DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY.
62
Darwin massages his cramped hand then takes a blank sheet
of notepaper.
DARWIN
Dearest Hooker. I am one week
into the great project and I feel
at last that it is real. Its
title is "On the Origin of
Species." As I write theses words
why does it feel as though I am
confessing to a murder...
A paper stirs in the breeze and he pins it with the nearest
object to hand - Annie's trilobite.
His eye rests on it a moment
CUT TO
63
63
The corrugated gray surface, greatly magnified.
The Darwin of ten years ago is examining the trilobite with
a watchmakers eyeglass.
44
There is a small mirror above his desk, angled so as to
give him a view of the path leading round from the front of
the house.
Innes appears briefly in it, preceded by Annie, who is
trotting to keep pace with him and crying.
Darwin, intent on his work, notices neither of them
From downstairs he hears the door knocker then Brodie's
voice, then Emma's overlapping with half-heard fragments of
Innes's Scottish brogue.
INNES (O.S.)
I thought you needed to know why
I had to chastised her.
Darwin remains immersed, examining each detail of the
trilobite, comparing it with other specimens in books and
in boxes.
INNES (O.S.)
....It is not fair to the other
nor to Annie herself that her
head be filled with these ideas....
EMMA
Are you listening, Annie?
Annie sobs louder, incoherent in her grief.
Darwin finally focusses on the sounds, recognizes her
distress and gets up to investigate.
64
EXT .UPPER HALLWAY. DAY.
64
He reaches the top of the stairs. Annie is directly below
him, slumped, still sobbing at the foot of the stairs.
Emma has ushered Innes to the porch out of sight.
INNES (O.S)
I shall bid you good day then
The front
door closes. Darwin comes downstairs
DARWIN
What happened?
ANNIE
Nothing.
DARWIN
Its not nothing. (To Annie) Why
are your knees bleeding?
45
EMMA
Mr Innes had to have words with
her. It is sorted now.
DARWIN
Words are very well. I am asking
what happened to her knees.
ANNIE
Mr Innes sent me to the corner
and made me kneel on rock-salt.
DARWIN
What!
ANNIE
(in a rush)
I said there were dinosaurs and
he said there wasn't dinosaurs
but there were because you saw
them.
EMMA
(interrupting)
Annie. Let me talk to your
father. He told her to kneel til
she repented...
DARWIN
Repented what?
EMMA
The bleeding is due to her own
stubborn-ness. It is finished
now.
DARWIN
It is by no means finished. Where
is my coat. Its intolerable
EMMA
Charles. Please.
Charles ignores her, Forcing his arm into the sleeve of his
coat.
EMMA
Mr Innes is a dear friend and
neighbor. I beg you at least
appraise yourself the facts. She
contradicted him repeatedly. The
fault was Annie's Mr Innes was
quite within his rights.
46
DARWIN
(his arm is stuck)
In his rights to torture our
children for expressing the plain
truth.
Brodie appears and Darwin ushers Annie towards her
DARWIN
EMMA
...Please take her to
It is not the truth as he
kitchen.
sees it
DARWIN
Well damn how he sees it. Damn
the pair of them and all their
works
EMMA
Charles listen to yourself.
Listen
Blocking his path as he heads for the door. Her palm flat
on his lapel, soothing, reasoning with him
DARWIN
Emma please. I will not have
Innes tell me what I can and
cannot tell my children.
EMMA
It is what I have told them every
night at bedtime. It is the
instruction my aunt and your
brother and most of our family
live by. It is what all of the
village believe ...or try to.
Charles. Must our children be
revolutionaries at nine years of
age. Write to him with your
concerns - our concerns - about
the manner of the punishment but
please do not set yourself
against him. Think of my feelings
on this. I beg you.
Finally his outrage has spent itself, neutralized by her
gentle persistence and the deep affection he holds for her.
DARWIN
You're right of course.... I'm
sorry.
He embraces her.
Emma is reassured, she cannot see the conflict written all
over Darwins face.
47
65
65
The conflicted expression has hardened, the furrows in
Darwin's brow etched deeper, as he dips his pen and begins
the second chapter.
From the floor below we can hear Emma practising a piece of
music on the piano - Chopin's revolutionary etude: a
rippling, brooding arpeggio running up and down the
keyboard, redolent of an angry sea.
Darwin's pen scratches doggedly over the paper.
66
66
In the bedroom, in his nightgown, Darwin scrubs the ink
stains off his fingers with a pumice stone.
Emma passes behind him, preparing for bed. He glances at
her in the mirror
DARWIN
You're still angry with me.
EMMA
No. Why?
DARWIN
I can always tell by your
playing.
EMMA
Not angry. I'm sad.
67
67
Darwin sits at his desk, writing and editing, his hand
clamped on the pen.
A voice speaks from nowhere
ANNIE
Talk to her.
DARWIN
(still writing)
And say what? She does not want
to hear it.
ANNIE
Then write to her.
DARWIN
(irritably)
That is what I am doing Annie, I
am writing all of it.
48
68
70
Darwin dips his pen, scores out some text from his previous
draft and writes again.
The music continues from downstairs, louder and more
insistent than before.
71
LOUNGE ROOM. THE PRESENT. DAY
71
Emmas hands race back and forwards along the piano
keyboard.
72
INT DARWIN'S STUDY. THE PRESENT
72
Darwin's pen scratches across the pages, making a noise
like fingernails on a blackboard.
The music from downstairs seeming to drive into his skull
49
He speaks aloud the words he is writing, in an effort to
drown out the piano music.
DARWIN (THOUGHT VOICE)
... In time small variations become
extreme...
Strange detailed drawings of barnacles are strewn across
his desk, seeming to change and transmute before his eyes.
DARWIN (V.O.)
...Organs change their very
function, the oviduct becomes a
cement gland.
He stops. His hand is shaking too much to write.
ANNIE
What's an oviduct?
DARWIN
Nothing that need concern you.
ANNIE
(sulkily)
I know what it is anyway.
Darwin gets up abruptly from his desk.
73
73
DARWIN
Pull!
Darwin stands naked, clutching to two hand rails for
support as a great tub of freezing water tilts and pours
its contents on top of him.
Darwin yells
74
EXT DOVECOTE
74
Birds rush out from the dovecote
75
75
Darwin dips his pen and writes
DARWIN
....What was once a free-
swimming creature now finds
itself glued by its head to a
rock, flailing for food with its
legs...,
50
The Revolutionary etude is continuous now - real or
imagined.
76
UNDER THE SEA
76
Surf crashes.
Underwater, among the swirling seaweed, fragile sea
creatures being torn this way and that by the raging surf
77
77
Annie screams and kicks her legs, overwhelmed by water in
some dark place.
Pull back to reveal:
78
78
A vision of hell:
The water is fire.
The barnacles are people.
The people are Annie, Emma and Darwin.
79
79
Darwin wakes in a panic and sits up in bed. He raises his
right arm and looks down at his inky writing hand
fluttering in the moonlight, like an organ with a will all
of its own
Emma is a sleep. There's a crucifix on the wall above her
bed. On the bedside table there's a bible.
EMMA
" ...About the midst of this
valley I perceived the mouth of
hell to be; and it stood also
hard by the wayside. Now, thought
Christian, what shall I do?
80
80
The children are gathered around Emma who is reading a bed-
time story to them by lamplight.
Emma is in the centre of a circle of little attentive
faces.
51
She's aware of Darwin, standing in the darkened corridor
beyond the door, drawn to the cosy little group but unable
to join it.
She lets him be. Continues reading
EMMA
And ever and anon the flame and
smoke would come out in such
abundance with sparks and hideous
noises, that he was forced to put
up his sword, and betake himself
to another weapon, called "All
Prayer"..."
81
81
The older girls Etty and Betty finish their prayers and
jump into bed in their night-gowns
Emma comes in to take away their lamp.
ETTY
Is Daddy not coming to kiss us
good-night
EMMA
He is still a little bit ill from
working ...maybe tomorrow.
BETTY
That's what you said last night.
Emma turns out the light. In the darkness Etty says.
ETTY
I think when Annie died he
stopped loving us.
Emma returns to her bedside
EMMA
Oh come now, Etty. You know
that's not true. He is just a
little bit ill - and a little bit
busy.
82
82
In the bowels of Down House the house, we find Darwin
wrapped in wet towels sweating in front of the wood-burning
stove.
As he gazes into the leaping flames, Annie appears at his
shoulder.
52
ANNIE
Is there really such a place as
hell.
DARWIN
No of course not. How can there
be?
If he is supposed to be loving
and forgiving - what on earth is
the sense punishing all these
millions of souls.
ANNIE
But just suppose if there was.
And all this was punishment.
DARWIN
All what?
No reply.
DARWIN
I don't know what you mean. All
what?
83
INT THE WATER TOWER. DAY
83
Darwin stands, legs apart in the water tower bracing
himself like a colossus against the full force of the
deluge.
DARWIN
Pull!
84
EXT THE WATER TOWER. DAY
84
The gardener, splitting logs, watches Darwin stagger from
the tower with a rug wrapped around him, and make his way
back to the house.
85
85
Darwin lowers himself into bed, inky and tousled. He seems
prematurely aged, crippled by the gruelling process of
writing the book.
As he lies there, unable to sleep lines of written text
seems to appear behind his closed eyes, or in the tangled
vines of the wallpaper.
Emma speaks from the other side of the bed.
EMMA
Talk to Mr Innes. Please. You are
clearly not well
53
DARWIN
He is what? A physician now
EMMA
You know what I mean. I think he
can help you.
Charles remains stubbornly silent, his hand fluttering over
the coverlet.
EMMA
I am taking the children to Maer
for a while, to visit their
cousins.
(Beat)
I worry for you, Charles. Please
talk to him
86
INT DARWIN'S STUDY. DAY
86
Fire flares in the grate as Darwin compares the skeletons
of various pigeons.
He starts a new Chapter: "changes under domestication"
87
87
Pigeons mate and coo in the dusty twilight.
88
89
Darwin Looks out of the study window, searching for
inspiration.
He sees Emma and the children getting into a coach with
their baggage.
90
90
Darwin sits at his desk.
He has written the chapter heading and nothing else.
Parslow knocks and looks in
PARSLOW
Will you be eating sir.
54
DARWIN
No thank you.
Parslow leaves. Darwin addresses the empty room.
DARWIN
Annie? .....Annie.
She will not come.
91
92
The George and Dragon on a Saturday night. The air loud
with laughter and thick with pipe smoke.
Clodhoppers crowd the snug, many of them roaring drunk,
with their florid complexions, stained and broken teeth.
Darwin trying, to slip in discreetly is spied by a group of
locals who hail him and gather around him, wedging him into
a corner with their overloud loud talk and laughter.
THATCHER
Mr Darwin! Mr Darwin! I was
explaining to Mr Goodman here
your interest in breeding. Mr
Darwin is our foremost scholar in
the village.
DARWIN
No. No I am but one of many.
There is Squire Lubbock, and the
reverend Innes
The Thatcher waves them away as lesser talents.
THATCHER
....he is also a noted explorer,
the author of many books..
DARWIN
...which no-one has read.
55
THATCHER
...a fellow of the Royal society
and a prodigious expert on
clams...oysters?
DARWIN
Barnacles.
THATCHER
Mr Goodman, now, is the foremost
pigeon fancier in all the
southern counties. Kent champion
two years running. I swear he can
give you any beak or plumage in
four generations. Head and tail
in five.
DARWIN
How do you do it?
GOOODMAN
By breeding cousin with cousin. I
find it the fastest way to alter
the strain - provided you do not
weaken it in other ways.
Darwin takes a slug of whiskey
93
THE PRESENT. NIGHT
93
He is drinking in his office.
The clock strikes twelve. The page in front of him remains
stubbornly blank
Darwin is rising from his desk when he sees something move.
In one of the bottles on his desk, a fleshy marine specimen
seems to have come to life.
It writhes blindly in its bottle of formalin, making a
sound like a baby crying.
Darwin, recoiling in horror, pushes himself back from his
desk. The castors on his chair trundle back from his desk.
Behind him he hears a tapping and turns to see that all the
birds in his big glass display case of Galapagos finches
have started to beat against the inside the crowded glass
case. They flutter, frenzied, tapping with their beaks on
the inside of the glass, which shatters as...
One by one the bottled specimens explode, discharging their
contents onto the floor.
A lamp falls over. The room is filled with birds the floor
awash with formalin and broken glass.
56
The Study seems to tilt like the cabin of a ship in a storm
and.
94
94
Darwin wakes from the nightmare asleep at his desk, the
whiskey bottle a quarter empty, ink on his hands and his
shirt cuffs
He gets up and puts on his shoes.
95
95
The scullery maid, lighting the fire, looks round and sees
Darwin.
He walks past her without a word and heads out into the
garden.
96
97
In the grey light he takes in the corpses of doves from the
dovecote.
Some have been skinned, their pelts curing on frames, their
carcasses steeping in a buckets chemicals which remove the
flesh from the bones.
Previously he regarded this place as a sort of laboratory.
Now it seems a place of horror.
The door opens behind him. Its Parslow.
DARWIN
Get rid of them.
PARSLOW
Which ones sir?
DARWIN
All of them. All of it.
98
98
Darwin reaches into the dovecote and starts grabbing
pigeons at random, dragging them out and flinging them into
the air.
57
DARWIN
Go. Go!
99
100
The local doctor Henry Holland takes out various
concoctions from his medical bag and arranges them on the
dresser.
We are in the past. Annie is in bed with a fever.
Emma is pregnant.
DOCTOR
Calomel then, twice daily.
DARWIN
I will not give it to her.
EMMA
DOCTOR
Charles....
Mrs Darwin, it is nothing but
chloride of mercury. I have
prescribed it often in
children as young as two.
58
DARWIN
Not to any of mine I hope. On the
Beagle I dropped some on a
microscope slide and all my
animacules died of it.
DOCTOR
Well animacules are not persons.
Presumably they would die if you
dose them with Madeira wine.
DARWIN
On Madeira they thrived most
excellently, as did Captain
Fitzroy, while it lasted.
Annie enjoys the joke and gives Darwin a weak smile. The
doctor regards her balefully
DOCTOR
Or if she would submit to be
bled.
ANNIE
Please no.
DARWIN
I will write to Dr Gully again.
DOCTOR
(sceptical)
The hydro-therapist?
DARWIN
I have always found his
treatments most effective.
DOCTOR
...no matter that they defy all
sense of logic.
He is packing up his bottles and his lancets
DARWIN
Logic is not everything.
Emma shoots him a look. Til now scientific logic has been
his guiding principle.
DOCTOR
Then I shall bid you good day.
DARWIN
Parslow will bring your carriage.
I will be down presently
The doctor leaves the room. Emma is in a terrible quandary
59
DARWIN
I should take her to Malvern.
EMMA
I think it is better she is here.
DARWIN
Gully can care for her properly
there. She can be treated daily,
as I was.
EMMA
Charles no. She is better with
us. With her family. Please do
not take her away from me.
101
101
Parslow enters to find his master staring vacantly into
space.
The page in front of him is still blank.
The study is in chaos. It seems as though the contents of
the black box have multiplied and spread out to colonize
every corner of the room.
PARSLOW
Post for you sir.
He leaves it by Darwins elbow and backs out.
After a while Darwin seems to rouse himself.
He picks up the largest envelope, postmarked Malaysia, and
slits it with a letter knife.
The sender is a Mr Wallace. There's a covering letter and a
twenty page attachment Darwin reads, and lets out a sudden
loud bellow of laughter.
DARWIN
Ha!!
102
103
There are some faint stains on the plasterwork of the
bedroom ceiling. Like lichen on a rock. Like an archipelago
of islands.
Darwin lies, pale and weak, looking upwards from a sea of
white blankets.
The door opens and he turns his head. Its Emma.
EMMA
You have a visitor.
DARWIN
No. No. I will not be bled or
lectured to.
She gives him a pinched look, then Hooker pushes in behind
her.
63
HOOKER
It is me. Thank God you are still
with us. Word came from London
you had suffered an apoplectic
stroke.
DARWIN
No. Simply the great relief of
liberation. Did you read the
Wallace abstract.
Hooker bats the idea away
HOOKER
It is a letter. You have a book
DARWIN
...barely half of it
HOOKER
You have a book. What is not
already on the page is most
certainly inside your head and I
intend to extract it, if it kills
us both.
DARWIN
You have been talking to Huxley.
HOOKER
No. Had I done so he would have
hastened here himself armed with
every instrument of torture known
to her majesty's navy.
(Then)
Charles I have read the first
Chapters. It is brilliant. You
must continue.
DARWIN
I cannot. Seriously Joseph, I am
completely blocked. All my old
symptoms have returned with a
vengeance. The sweats the shakes
the abdominal pains. The whole
endeavour was cursed from the
outset.
Hooker takes darwins hand, presses it to stop it from
trembling
HOOKER
Charles. It was you who opened my
eyes to the wonders of science.
So let me open yours. You have an
illness. You have had it as long
as I have known you.
(MORE)
64
HOOKER (cont'd)
It is clearly made worse in times
of overwork but the nature of the
work is irrelevant. This is not
visited on you by God or the
devil. This is a set of physical
symptoms. Go to Malvern and get
treated.
DARWIN
Not Malvern
HOOKER
Why not. What is there to be
scared of there. He has worked
for you in the past it will work
again. Then come back and finish
the book. Your enemies are
already toasting their good
fortune but they shall not
prevail.
DARWIN
What are you talking about. I
have no enemies.
HOOKER
They are legion, believe me, and
they are implacable. We are all
of us fighting a battle against
fear and superstition but we can
win this battle. We must win it.
You can win it for all of us. Go
to malvern, then come back and
finish it.
104
104
Upstairs, Servants are packing for a journey.
The vigorous Darwin of the past moves swiftly from room to
room, gathering his things. Hat and gloves, books,
spectacles, papers.
Emma, eight months pregnant, tries to keep up with him
EMMA
Charles, please reconsider
CHARLES
Emma it is weeks now, months. She
is getting worse, not better.
EMMA
Then I am coming with you.
65
DARWIN
You cannot come. How can you
possibly come in your condition.
EMMA
It is not so far.
DARWIN
It is two days by coach and
train. Who will look after the
others.
EMMA
I do not care for the others. I
care for Annie!
Etty, coming apon then unexpectedly, hears this and is
instantly heartbroken.
EMMA is devastated by the slip but is presently too
overwrought to retract it.
DARWIN
Leave us please, Etty.
Parslow has gathered up Annie from her room and is carrying
her downstairs, pale and sickly-looking, with Brodie
fussing behind.
BRODIE
Make sure she is tucked in. Watch
her shawl
ANNIE
I don't need to go.
At the bottom of the stairs, Darwin takes Annie from
Parslow's arms
DARWIN
The coach is outside. I will
carry her from here.
EMMA
Annie...
ANNIE
Mama...
She clasps Emma's hand. Darwin keeps heading for the door.
Emma holds fast to Annies hand and follows behind
DARWIN
You will see Mamma when you are
better. Say goodbye now.
66
Parslow holds the door open. The coach is at the Gate. Emma
stops on the threshold, unable to let go her daughters hand
and suddenly deeply convinced that she is making a mistake
here.
EMMA
Wait. I am coming with you
DARWIN
Please, Emma
EMMA
Wait there.
She hurries back inside. Darwin makes a decision and heads
for the coach.
105
106
Emma looks out of the upstairs window, realizes they plan
to leave without her and hurries downstairs again.
107
107
Charles bundles Annie inside.
DARWIN
(to the coachman)
Go. Go.
EMMA
(calls)
Wait!
DARWIN
Go now!
ANNIE
Mama!!
67
The coach sets off. Emma runs to the gate calling
desperately.
EMMA
Charles. Please God. No. Annie!
108
108
Charles, feeble and debilitated, levers himself into the
coach with Parslow assisting and slumps back in the leather
upholstery.
Servants gather at the gate. Some of them tearful, not
expecting him to return
109
110
The sickly Darwin of the present sits hunched and nauseous,
with Parslow sitting beside him with his suitcase on his
lap.
Every jolt of the train sends a spasm of pain through
Darwin's guts.
The people sitting opposite - a woman, a child, and a man -
regard Darwin in silence. Whatever he suffers from its not
good and they are worried about getting infected with it
They plunge into a tunnel. The carriage fills with smoke.
Parslow gets up and tries to close the window but it won't
budge. A burning ember flies inside and lands on Darwin's
leg.
Darwin is too weak to lift a finger. Parslow slaps the
ember and extinguishes it.
111
113
Dr Gully is the chief physician at Malvern spa. His marble-
tiled consulting rooms resound with the sound of rumbling
pipes and dripping water.
Darwin reclines on a leather couch, watching the watery
play of light on the ceiling.
A door opens and Dr Gully comes in, accompanied by two
assistants.
Gully is a small dapper man wearing an apron over his shirt
and tie. His trousers are tucked into calf-length
Wellington boots.
He greets Darwin cheerfully, effusively.
MR GULLY
Mr Darwin, old friend. Mr Darwin.
It has been too long I fear. Tut
tut tut tut tut. What have we now
what have we now?
He clasps Darwin's hand, feeling his pulse at the wrist,
then commands him to open his mouth
69
GULLY
tongue...
Darwin shows him.
MR GULLY
Ugh. Shirt up. Let me feel your
liver.
Darwin untucks his shirt. Gully prods at Darwin's belly.
Darwin winces.
DR GULLY
Pulse hectic, togue furred, liver
tender and enlarged.
Darwin's ink stained fingers speak volumes.
DR GULLY
No doubt you have been exercising
your brain every hour that God
gave you.
DARWIN
I was persuaded to write book.
DR GULLY
Madness there are far too many of
those already. Are you Sleeping?
DARWIN
Poorly.
DR GULLY
I suppose never taking the 50C
dilution of Chelidonium.
DARWIN
(shakes his head)
I had the gardener build a water
tower. It no longer has any
effect.
GULLY
Of course not. Your gardener is
not a hydrotherapist. What on
earth possessed you ?
DARWIN
I feared I was dying.
DR GULLY
Oh come come come. We shall not
have that talk here.
Half turning to his assistant, who is staking notes.
70
GULLY
A smart spinal scrub. Cold douche
daily at 7.00. Wrapping in towels
and sweating by the lamp.
Then, to Darwin:
DR GULLY
No red meat, no reading, no
mental agitation of any kind. We
shall soon have you right old
friend, we shall have you right.
114
114
Music over:
Darwin sits in a deep metal bath while one of Gully's
assistants scrubs his spine with a loofah.
115
115
Darwin stands in a shaft of light, grabbing onto the hand
rails as the icy flood continues to crash down on his
shoulders, splintering and fracturing in the shaft of
light.
116
116
Two assistants bind him tight in damp linen sheets, til he
is immobilised like a cocoon, with his legs together and
his hands by his side.
They pick him up and lie him down, quite rigid beside
another pod like creature, similarly swaddled, with a red
face and a beard.
BEARDED STRANGER
Mr Darwin is it?
Darwin nods, unable to turn his head, or make any gesture
with his hands.
The stranger continues to talk to him nonetheless.
BEARDED STRANGE
William Carter of Southampton. I
read your Beagle account many
years ago. Former naval man
myself. What brings you here?
Myself, a Bilious fever with
blood per rectum, but I have
every faith in Gully. The man is
a miracle worker.
71
117
117
Darwin sits with a blanket draped over his shoulders, under
the merciless glare of a heat lamp.
Sweat pours off him and forms puddles at his feet.
118
120
The room is large and hot, crowded with pot plants, and
bric- a-brac. Various fringed lamp-shades, a dancing Shiva,
a framed picture of Lourdes, and some illustrations from
the Tarot. None of this inspires Darwin with confidence.
ST JOHN
Just leave your coat on the
table. Sit down here. Show me
your palm.
The husky voice and the plunging decollete troubles Darwin,
who hesitates.
DARWIN
Sorry. I'm confused. What is it
you do exactly.
MRS ST JOHN
I envision what's inside your
belly, dear. That's what you
wanted, isn't it.
DARWIN
Envision how? When Gully
described you I fancied some
scientific instrument....
MRS ST JOHN
Depends what you class an
instrument. In more resistant
cases I might use a pendulum...
74
He frowns. She smiles.
MRS ST JOHN
Its ten shillings for a reading
by the way. In advance.
DARWIN
Well. I have a ten shilling note
here in my wallet.
He doesn't take it out.
DARWIN
If you can tell me the numbers on
it we can begin.
Mr St John' face hardens.
MRS ST JOHN
(coldly)
I'm a professional lady Mr
Darwin. I don't do party tricks.
DARWIN
I am a professional man. And I
asking for no more than I ask of
all my colleagues - a
demonstration of competence.
MRS ST JOHN
It is you who are here to be
tested, Sir, not me.
DARWIN
Then I am sorry to have wasted
your time.
He puts his jacket back on and heads for the door.
121
121
Mrs St John follows him. As he reaches for the doorhandle,
and opens it, she says:
MRS ST JOHN
She's with you, you know that.
Darwin turns.
MRS ST JOHN
Your little girl. I saw her from
the window standing at the top of
the steps.
DARWIN
How dare you.
75
MRS ST JOHN
Pardon?
DARWIN
...prey on people's grief like
this.
MRS ST JOHN
I have done no such thing.
DARWIN
(furious)
Do you take me for an idiot?
Clearly Gully has appraised you
of my history.
MRS ST JOHN
I beg to inform you he did no
such thing!
DARWIN
It is chicanery of the very
lowest order and I despise it
utterly!
MRS ST JOHN
Get out.
122
126
Darwin, climbs the stairs to the Landing.
78
127
127
The younger Darwin flees up the stairs.
128
128
The older Darwin, reaches the top of the stairs and walks
along the corridor to the right.
129
129
The younger Darwin, races along the corridor.
130
130
The older Darwin, hesitates, chest pounding, outside the
door of number 14, then unlocks it as...
131
131
The younger Darwin bursts into room 14 and takes in the
scene.
The room is full if light. A maid is bundling soiled
sheets. Brodie is there with a harrassed-looking Dr Gully.
They turn as he enters.
Annie lies on the bed between them, her breathing fast and
shallow. She manages a weak smile.
DARWIN
Is she any better? Does she want
for anything?
Gully stands up from the bed. His expression tells us hope
is fading. Annie's pale sunken cheeks and caked lips
confirm it.
Darwin kneels by her bedside, clasps her little hand is his
own.
DARWIN
Darling Annie. I am here now.
Annie lets out a reedy whine of appreciation and strokes
his lapel "making him beautiful"
Brodie cannot bear it and bursts into tears.
132
132
Annie sleeps.
79
Darwin sits up, writing to Emma, crying as he writes.
DARWIN (V.O.)
Dearest Emma. I think it best for
you to know how every hour
passes. It's a relief for me to
tell you. Whilst writing to you I
can cry tranquilly.
133
133
A local surgeon lays out various instruments, including a
glass syringe with a long needle.
Annie struggles and whimpers. Brodie comforts her
DARWIN (V.O.)
Mr Coates the Surgeon came today
to draw off Annie's water. This
did not hurt her, but she
struggled with surprising
strength against being uncovered.
BRODIE
There there. It will all soon be
over.
134
135
The relatives of the sick, stand or sit among the pews,
arriving, praying, departing
Darwin kneels awkwardly in front of the altar, clasps his
hands together and prays:
DARWIN
Save her. I will believe
whatever. Forever. Please save
her
He looks up at the image of Christ on the cross, hoping
against all reason, for some sense of epiphany.
It's not working. He feels nothing embarrassment at the
cheapness of the gesture.
136
INT GUEST HOUSE. ROOM 14.
THE PAST .NIGHT
136
Darwin sits alone with Annie who is babbling incoherently.
He can't make out anything she says
80
DARWIN (V.O.)
Our dear child has taken a turn
for the worse. She talked a great
deal but we could seldom make out
anything. Much of what she says
we cannot make out from the
roughness of her poor mouth.
137
137
Dr Gully leaves, the surgeon arrives. The maids squeeze
between the two medical men, bundling sheets
DARWIN (V.O.)
Today she vomited rather much
again. Dr Coates has been to draw
off more water.
Brodie and the maid roll Annie on her side and cut off the
tail of her shirt, then roll her on her back again, with a
pillow between her two bony knees.
DARWIN
Is that good, my lovely
ANNIE
(suddenly lucid)
Beautifully good. I am making
custards.
DARWIN (V.O.)
Gully thinks her in imminent
danger.
138
138
Heavily pregnant Emma sits in the drawing room, crying and
reading Darwin's latest letter.
DARWIN (V.O.)
We sponged her with water and
vinegar, made her sweet with
chloride of lime....I fear we
must prepare ourselves for the
worst
139
139
It is midnight Darwin, exhausted, keeps a lonely Vigil by
Annie's bedside. Each breath seems like it will be her
last.
Suddenly she speaks: faintly but audibly:
81
ANNIE
The rabbit.
DARWIN
What?
ANNIE
The rabbit taught him the polka.
DARWIN
I don't understand my love.
ANNIE
Tell me about Jenny.
Darwin bends low to hear her more clearly.
DARWIN
What about her.
ANNIE
When she died
DARWIN
I don't want to talk about death
my love.
ANNIE
But tell me. I like it.
DARWIN
Well. What the keeper told me
was. When she was very sick with
pneumonia, lying very still, he
tried to feed her but she shook
her head, looking at him as
though to say: "Its nice of you
but really you shouldn't bother".
And as he bent down to take the
spoon away she brought her arms
around his neck and kissed him.
And then she was dead.
Annie smiles, puts her hands around her fathers neck and
dies.
140
140
Darwin sits, his face wet with tears, reading, through
blurred vision, a letter from Emma.
EMMA (V.O.)
I was in the garden looking at
our poor darling's little flower
bed when John Griffiths drove up
with your letter.
82
141
141
Emma goes to bed, utterly drained.
EMMA (V.O.)
When I went to bed I felt as if
it had all happened long ago.
When the blow comes it wipes out
all that preceded it.
142
142
She opens the curtains on a bright day. The other children
are playing in the garden
EMMA (V.O.)
My feeling of longing for our
lost treasure makes me feel
painfully indifferent to the
other children, but I shall get
right before long.
143
143
Darwin sits in the train, Heading home from malvern.
He is looking across the carriage at his younger self, re-
reading the letter and weeping uncontrollably.
144
EXT DOWN HOUSE. LOUNGE. THE PRESENT. NIGHT
144
Torrential rain crashes down on the house, the garden, the
ancient trees and the outbuildings, flooding the path and
the lane beyond the gate.
Darwin pays the coachman and hurries inside
145
145
Emma is playing a beautiful slow Nocturne.
The rain outside drown out all other side.
She doesn't notice the figure of Darwin until he appears,
like a ghost, reflected in the polished wood of the piano.
She turns with a start and sees him, still in his dripping
coat, hair plastered over his brow
DARWIN
Sorry. I startled you.
83
EMMA
Take your coat off by the fire
there. What time is it?
Darwin stays where he is, dripping on the carpet
DARWIN
We need to talk. I need to talk
to you.
EMMA
Of course, but dry your hair. I
shall call for a towel.
As she moves to the bell-pull he grabs her wrist
DARWIN
I went back to Worcester Road. I
saw Annie.
EMMA
Charles. No.
DARWIN
Let me tell you.
EMMA
I don't want to hear it. This
must stop.
DARWIN
You don't understand.
EMMA
I do! Do you think me deaf and
blind. You have lived with her
and spoken with her every day
since she died.
Parslow comes in with firewood then sees Emma yelling at
darwin and hurriedly retreats, spilling logs in the
hallway.
EMMA
She is more real to you than I
am. She's dead Charles.
DARWIN
I know that.
EMMA
Then what is wrong with you that
even our poor daughter cannot be
left in her grave but you
would....
84
DARWIN
I know she is dead. I know it. It
is you who will not accept the
fact, preferring to think of her
in heaven.
This again! The unspoken argument which has been brewing
for a decade, never before expressed so bluntly. Emma heads
for the door
EMMA
Get away from me!
She heads into the hallway, he follows her ranting
DARWIN
Snowy white wings and dancing
with the angels. Is that your
idea of honesty.
Servants scramble out of sight and out of earshot
EMMA
Why did you come back. I will not
hear this!
Emma picks up her skirts and hurries up the stairs. Darwin
pursues her.
On the landing, Betty and Horace, wide eyed and terrified
are bundled into the nursery by Brodie as Charles thunders
up the stair.
DARWIN
You have to Emma, everything
these was between us is gone.
The boat is wrecked and sunk now.
We have to hold to something
else.
EMMA
To what. Your ghosts? Your
theories? What Charles.
CHARLES
To the truth of what we know it.
She slams the bedroom door on him and bolts it.
DARWIN
Open this door Emma. The truth,
how wonderful and extraordinary
our daughter was....
EMMA
(through the door)
I know that. I do not need you to
say it. Of course I know.
85
Charles throws his shoulder to the door and bursts through
it. Emma screams
CHARLES
But free of the fantasy, free of
the rest, the silly vain hope
that we will be reunited in
heaven and the nagging unspoken
belief that I killed her!
In the lower hallway all the servants hear this
In the nursery, Brodie, aghast, covers the childrens ears
In the bedroom, Emma has nowhere left to run
EMMA
I have never said that
CHARLES
Say it now. Say it. And all the
rest that follows. That I should
have kept Annie warm that day on
the beach. I should not have
taken her to Malvern. I should
have let you come.
Tears spring to her eyes and to his. The fury has gone from
both of them, leaving sadness and pity
EMMA
I should have insisted.
CHARLES
No. It was me. I took her from
you It was my fault.
EMMA
I could have followed. I was her
mother what was I thinking of.
CHARLES
We thought she would live. You
were not to know.
He moves to her, she startles, then lets him enfold her in
his damp coat
EMMA
I did. I did know. I knew when
you left that I would never see
her again. I hated you for taking
her.
CHARLES
I hated myself. I knew that none
of them could save her.
(MORE)
86
CHARLES (cont'd)
All I could do was watch
hopelessly and weep for her -
then flee the place in terror,
not even waiting to see our poor
dear daughter buried. She was our
treasure and I failed her. We
both did. We should never have
married each other.
EMMA
What are you saying?
CHARLES
The unspeakable . I am saying
that you and I, in making our
perfect child, endowed her with
the very weakness which killed
her. Emma. That is what I
couldn't write. That is what
forestalled me all these years.
It wasn't you I was angry with,
it wasn't Innes and it wasn't
God. I was angry with my theory.
It was the truth I was angry
with. It is the truth.
Weeping, she shakes her head in furious denial. He kisses
her hair, her eyes, her tear-streaked cheeks...
146
INT/ EXT BEDROOM, THE PRESENT. NIGHT
146
Rain continues to batter the house outside
Inside Darwin and Emma make love, with a kind of wild
desperation, their clothes strewn all over the floor,
clinging to each other like castaways in a storm.
147
INT OFFICE. THE PRESENT. DAY
147
Darwin enters his office. The chaos that existed here
previously has been tidied away into files and boxes.
Darwin opens the black box, takes out the files, places
them on his desk, then sits down and begins to write
148
148
Darwin sits at his desk. Writing. He is possessed of a new
sense of calm and purpose, the pen gliding fluently across
the page.
87
Night turns to day and then to night again. Darwin
completes the Chapter headed "variation under
domestication" and begins on a fresh sheet of paper.
149
150
Still Darwin writes
ANNIE
Tell me a story.
DARWIN
I'm busy Annie.
ANNIE
(petulantly)
I'll go away again, then you'll
be sorry.
DARWIN
All right, come here, come here.
She comes and sits on his lap.
DARWIN
Once there was a man
Who, while travelling in South
America, came apon a beautiful
and dangerous idea.
151
151
Darwin is in the south American jungle, trying to coax down
from the trees, some small squeaking creature - a tousled
looking abandoned chick.
DARWIN
Here, here. Come on, come on then
The creature draws closer, eyes like gimlets in the dark
foliage.
DARWIN
...I wont hurt you.
He reaches into the dark recesses of the forest. Darwin
grabs it and stuffs it, squawking into his collecting bag.
88
152
152
Darwin comes in, empties the bag into a black box with
perforations and closes the lid
DARWIN
He knew his wife wouldn't care
for this creature so when he came
home he locked it in a box, where
it couldn't run around and do any
damage.
153
153
Darwin works at his desk. There's a plaintive cooing sound
coming from the box next to his feet.
DARWIN
But every so often he'd open the
lid and feed it, just because he
couldn't bear to let it die.
Finally he opens the lid and offers the creature a biscuit.
It has grown a bit larger and made itself a nest. It takes
the biscuit and peeps gratefully.
154
154
Darwin goes to the box and opens it. There's nothing there
but an empty nest and some broken eggshells.
DARWIN
One day he opened the box and
discovered it wasn't in there at
all. It had escaped with all its
babies, who were nesting all over
the house making a terrible mess.
155
155
The Darwin's, their children and their servants run around
the house finding birds everywhere.
There is bird-shit on the curtains and the antimacassars,
birds nesting in the sewing basket, the bread bin and the
dress-up box.
Every time you open a cupboard, angry birds fly out and
flap angrily around the room.
Mayhem. The house is in uproar.
89
DARWIN
But finally they caught them all,
and bundled them in a blanket and
he asked his wife to dispose of
them as she saw fit.
156
156
Annie listens entranced. Darwin pauses
ANNIE
And what did she do?
DARWIN
I don't know but I fancy she took
them out in the garden and set
them free.
157
158
Darwin sits in his study window, watching a great flock of
birds wheeling in the sky outside, the whole flock forming
an ever-changing shape from the movement of its tiny
component parts.
159
INT DARWIN'S STUDY. NIGHT
159
Darwin puts down his pen, waking, as if from a dream.
The manuscript is finished.
The music of Chopin filters up from downstairs.
160
160
Emma is playing by candle-light. Darwin places the
manuscript on top of the piano.
She stops abruptly. The last chord resonates in the musky
air.
90
DARWIN
Done. I have finally got it out
of the air and into these pages.
Will you read it and decide what
must be done with it. I confess I
no longer know and I am very
tired.
She takes his hand and squeezes it.
161
161
Darwin undresses.
162
DINING ROOM
162
Emma sits at the table and begins to read.
163
163
Darwin gets out of the bath and towels himself dry.
164
164
Emma lights a candle from the one before and continues to
read.
165
165
Charles lowers himself into the bed, sleep washes over him
like a wave.
166
166
Still Emma reads.
DARWIN (V.O.)
Thus, from the war of nature,
from famine and death, the most
exalted objects we can conceive
directly follow. There is a
grandeur in this view of life
...in which endless forms most
beautiful and wonderful have been
and are being evolved.
Outside the sky is growing lighter.
167
167
Charles wakes.
91
He opens the curtains on a clear autumn day. The house is
unusually quiet.
168
168
The grandfather clock on the landing strikes mid-day.
Darwin goes downstairs.
169
169
He enters the drawing room. There is no sign of Emma nor of
his manuscript.
He goes to the window and sees her at the bottom of the
garden standing over a bonfire, burning something.
