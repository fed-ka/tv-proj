   (SHAWN, PERRY)

  A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT IN DOWNTOWN PITTSBURGH WITH A BIG 
    SCREEN TV AND AIR HOCKEY TABLE IN THE CORNER.  SHAWN GORDON, 
    A SMART, IRONIC, AFFABLE GUY IN HIS EARLY 30 S ENTERS.

                                SHAWN

              (CASUAL) Hi, sweet meat, I m home.

  AFTER A BEAT, PERRY MARTIN, EARLY 30 S, APPEARS.  PERRY IS  
    HANDSOME IN A RUGGED WAY AND STILL LOOKS LIKE HE COULD BE THE 
  STAR GOALIE AND CLEAN-UP HITTER HE WAS BACK IN COLLEGE.   

                                PERRY

              (BY ROTE) Hey, cheese balls. 

  THE TWO IMMEDIATELY SHUFFLE OVER TO A TABLE TILTED TO FACE 
  ESPN PLAYING 24/7.  PERRY HAS PIPING HOT FOOD WAITING.  THEY 
  EACH GRAB SECTIONS FROM THE NEWSPAPER, THEN START TO DIG IN.  
  THEY EAT IN SILENCE FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN PERRY LOOKS UP.

                                PERRY (CONT D)

              Okay, here s one. You sell your first 

              novel, it s number one on the NY Times 

              best seller list, you get to finally 

              quit your telemarketing job, but if 

              you do, your mother falls down a 

              flight of stairs. She doesn t break a 

              hip or anything, but she s in agony 

              for about twenty minutes. 

  SHAWN STOPS EATING HIS ROLL AND STARES AT PERRY IN AWE.                                                                                  2.



                                SHAWN

              That s...the best moral dilemma you ve  

              given me at dinner in five years.  

                                PERRY

              (PROUD) Yeah, it felt good. Well?

                                SHAWN

              I don t know, man, that s a tough one. 

              I mean, me and my mother go way back. 

              Twenty minutes, huh? But she s fine 

              after that, right? 

                                PERRY

              Totally fine. Except for the scars. 

                                SHAWN

              Scars? Are they visible?

                                PERRY

              Depends on the light.

                                SHAWN

              Whoo. Let me get back to you, okay?

  PERRY NODS.  LIKE AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE, THEY GO BACK TO  
    EATING IN SILENCE, EACH OF THEM READING THE PAPER.  SHAWN 
  PUMPS HIS FIST AS HE SCANS THE TV LISTINGS.

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              The Godfather is on tonight!

  PERRY LOOKS AT THE BACK OF THE PAGE SHAWN S READING, ALL THE 
  COLOR SUDDENLY DRAINING FROM HIS FACE. 

                                PERRY

              Oh my god...                                                                                  3.



                                SHAWN 

              I know! It ll only be the four 

              thousandth time we ve seen it. I even 

              have Enzo the Baker s lines memorized. 

              (A LA ENZO)  You should see the cake I 

              baked...the bride, the groom-- 

  PERRY GETS UP AND GRABS THE PAPER FROM SHAWN.  AS HE DOES, WE 
  SEE A PHOTO OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AND OVER THAT, THE HEADLINE: 
     PITTSBURGH FLAUTIST RETURNS TO PERFORM AT GLOBAL WARMING 
    EVENT.   SHAWN LOOKS AT THE PAPER, THEN AT PERRY.

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              She didn t call you?

                                PERRY

              No...(GRITTING TEETH) I gave her the 

              best thirteen months of my life. 

                                SHAWN 

              Dude, I thought you were over this.  

              It s been like a year.

                                PERRY

              Eight months, ten days, and two hours. 

              Did you just call me  dude?  

                                SHAWN

              Sorry. (BEAT) Look, I don t get it. 

              You can get any woman you want in the 

              greater Pennsylvania area.

                                PERRY 

              I know, but Tina was my soulmate. We 

              were going to have six kids.                                                                                  4.



                                SHAWN

              You don t want kids. They re loud and 

              mean and you d have stretch marks.

  PERRY WALKS ONTO THE BALCONY.  SHAWN FOLLOWS HIM.  HE SEES 
    PERRY S DOWN, SO HE TRIES TO CHEER HIM UP.  

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              Come on, Perry...there s no such thing 

              as soulmates. That s something 

              invented by Hallmark and those awful 

              Kate Hudson movies where violins play 

              whenever she sees that mongaloid 

              Matthew McConaughey. 

  PERRY LOOKS UP SUDDENLY AND SMILES.

                                PERRY

              Hey! Come with me to that global 

              warming thing tonight. 

                                SHAWN

              (LOOKS AT HIM) The Godfather is on, 

              you pansy...idiot...ass. 

                                PERRY

              C mon, man, you re great with words! 

              You can be my Cyrano. Make sure I 

              don t say anything too dopey or needy 

              around her. Pleaaase, Shawn.

                                SHAWN

              (BEAT) You know, you re sounding a 

              little needy right now.                                                                                  5.



  PERRY STARTS TO PACE.

                                PERRY

              Last time I saw her things were pretty 

              intense. There was a lot of crying and 

              she got emotional too. Look, she never 

              technically broke up with me, she just 

              said she needed to make it as a 

              musician first and now she has and...I 

              just need closure, okay?  

                                SHAWN

              Okay, okay. But you owe me big time.

                                PERRY

              Owe you? I pay most of the rent!

                                SHAWN 

              (FEELING BAD) Hey, I ll pay you back 

              every cent when I stop making minimum 

              wage and sell my books and make... 

              maximum wage and-- 

                                PERRY

              I was kidding! 

                                SHAWN

              That was a joke? Man, thank god you re 

              eye candy.

  PERRY SMILES, THEN TAKES A LONG, DEEP BREATH, AND HEADS OUT 
  THE DOOR WITH SHAWN.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                                                                                            6.



                                ACT ONE

                           SCENE B

   (SHAWN, PERRY, REBECCA, TINA)

  SHAWN AND PERRY HAVE JUST ENTERED AN INFORMAL CHARITY 
    EVENT/PARTY WITH BANNERS FOR GLOBAL WARMING.  PERRY SCANS 
    NERVOUSLY AROUND THE ROOM FOR HIS EX FOR A FEW SECONDS.  

                                SHAWN

              Okay, we gave it our best shot, let s 

              go home.

    SUDDENLY, PERRY HEARS A FLUTE AND TURNS VERY SLOWLY AROUND.  
  HE LOOKS UP AT A SMALL STAGE IN FRONT OF THE ROOM AND GAZES 
  AT TINA, THE WOMAN WE SAW EARLIER IN THE PHOTO. 

                                PERRY

              She s the most beautiful creature on 

              God s green earth. I want to make love 

              to her outside and spoon with her in 

              the morning dew.

                                SHAWN

              Yeah...we re gonna need you to sound a 

              smidge less like you have a vagina 

              when you walk over.

  PERRY NODS, EMBARRASSED.  SHAWN LOOKS AT HIM.

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              My god, look at you, you re shaking.

                                PERRY

              Slap me.

                                SHAWN

              What?                                                                                  7.



                                PERRY

              Seriously, do it. 

  SHAWN LOOKS AT HIM TENTATIVELY, THEN SLAPS PERRY HARD.  A 
    BEAUTIFUL, CLASSY-LOOKING WOMAN IN HER EARLY 30 S LOOKS OVER 
  FROM ABOUT 20 FEET AWAY AND LAUGHS. THIS IS REBECCA ULRICH.

                                PERRY (CONT D)

              Ow! You mother--  

  PERRY CURLS UP HIS FIST TO SLUG SHAWN, THEN LOOKS UP. 

                                PERRY (CONT D)

              Oh lord, oh crap, oh jesus, she s 

              walking off the stage. What do I do, 

              what do I say? Slap me harder, you 

              wavy-haired bitch!

                                SHAWN

              What? Listen to me. Just walk over 

              super casually and say  Hey, Tina, 

              it s nice to see you again. Looks like 

              you finally got your dream and I 

              couldn t be happier for you. Things 

              have been going great for me too with 

              my financial planning company and 

              perfect teeth--just kidding--and hey, 

              if you d like to catch up and grab a 

              coffee or something, that would be 

              kind of cool.  

                                PERRY

              (NODS) Can you please write that down? 

  SHAWN PUSHES PERRY IN HER DIRECTION.                                                                                    8.



  PERRY WALKS SLOWLY ACROSS THE ROOM, NERVOUS AS HELL. 
    SUDDENLY, REBECCA ULRICH, THE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WHO LAUGHED 
  WHEN SHAWN SLAPPED PERRY, WALKS OVER TO SHAWN.

                                REBECCA 

              (SMILES) You were kind of hard on your 

              friend there.

  SHAWN LOOKS AT HER, A BIT TAKEN ABACK.  

                                SHAWN

              Huh? Oh, you saw the slap? Well, you 

              know, he likes it rough. (OFF HER 

              LOOK) Not that we re gay.

                                REBECCA

              God, of course, I mean, why would I 

              assume you re gay just because you 

              like rough sex with your male friend?

                                SHAWN

              Cool. Cause some people think hopping 

              in the sack with another guy and 

              cupping his bottom makes you gay.

                                REBECCA

              What time do their minds open?

  SHAWN LAUGHS.  SHE LAUGHS TOO.  THE TWO OF THEM STARE AT EACH 
  OTHER FOR A BEAT.  AS THEY DO, WE SUDDENLY HEAR A VIOLIN PLAY 
  IN THE BACKGROUND.  SHAWN LOOKS UP, A BIT THROWN, THEN TURNS 
    AROUND AND NOTICES THAT A VIOLINIST IS NOW ON STAGE.  HE 
  LOOKS BACK AT REBECCA.  

                                SHAWN

              So...what brings you to this fun gala?                                                                                  9.



                                REBECCA 

              I don t know. Figured there would be a 

              lot of rich guys here. Thought I could 

              turn a few tricks.

    REBECCA S SO PRETTY AND REFINED, NOT MANY GUYS GET HER DARK 
  HUMOR RIGHT AWAY.  BUT CLEARLY SHAWN DOES.

                                SHAWN

              (SMILES) Oh, so you re a prostitute? 

                                REBECCA

              A notch below. Lawyer.

                                SHAWN

              Seriously? 

                                REBECCA

              You sound surprised.

                                SHAWN

              No, no, it s just...you don t sound 

              that bright.

    REBECCA LAUGHS HARD.  SHAWN SMILES.  THERE S A BRIEF SILENCE.  

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              How did you get roped into coming to 

              this thing? (SNORTS) Global warming. 

                                REBECCA

              Why, you in favor of it?                                                                                10.



                                SHAWN

              No, I m just saying, if you gave Al 

              Gore or anyone truth serum, you d find 

              out no one really gives a rat s ass 

              about global warming.  

                                REBECCA

              You don t care how we leave the world 

              behind for our children?

                                SHAWN

              No, not really. 

                                REBECCA

                That s...wow, you re very enlightened.

                                SHAWN

              Look, if the world ever does burn to a 

              crisp, it ll be in like three hundred 

              years and there s a good chance I ll 

              be dead. And I don t have to worry 

              about how I ll leave the world because 

              I don t have any kids. (FAUX MACHO) At 

              least none that I m aware of. 

                                REBECCA

              Yeah, me either. I mean, I d probably 

              know if I had kids, right? But just 

              because we re too cool and fancy to 

              have children, it doesn t mean we 

              shouldn t care about stuff like 

              greenhouse gas emissions and--                                                                                 11.



    SHAWN S EYES IMMEDIATELY GLAZE OVER AND WE CUT TO THE OTHER 
  SIDE OF THE ROOM WHERE PERRY IS NOW A MERE FOOT AWAY FROM 
  TINA.  THE LAST OF THE PEOPLE CONGRATULATING TINA ON HER SET 
  HAVE VANISHED AND PERRY NO LONGER HAS ANY EXCUSE.  HE TAKES A 
  DEEP BREATH, WALKS OVER AND TAPS TINA ON THE BACK.

                                PERRY

              (TOO QUICKLY)  Hey, Tina, it s nice to 

              see you again. Looks like you finally 

              got your dream and-- 

  TINA TURNS AROUND AND LOOKS AT PERRY.

                                TINA

              Oh my god, Perry! How are you?

                                PERRY

              Not bad, not bad, things have been 

              going great with my financial company

                                TINA

              I d like you to meet my fiancee Len. 

  PERRY TRIES HIS HARDEST NOT TO LOOK LIKE HE WAS JUST SUCKER 
    PUNCHED IN THE GUT BY A THOUSAND GORILLAS.  HE FORCES HIMSELF 
  TO SOUND MORE CASUAL THAN HE S EVER SOUNDED IN HIS LIFE.

                                PERRY

              Hey, Len. How s it hanging? Listen, 

              I d love to chat, but I m kind of in a 

              rush and...boy, it was just so nice 

              seeing you again, Tina. Bye!

  PERRY TURNS ON HIS HEELS AND WALKS CASUALLY AWAY, PICKING HIS 
    STRIDE UP DRAMATICALLY AFTER A FEW STEPS.  WE CUT BACK TO 
  SHAWN AND REBECCA ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM.                                                                                  12.



                                REBECCA

              Oh, by the way, I never asked what you 

              do for a living?

  SHAWN JUST STARES AT HER.

                                REBECCA (CONT D)

              Okay, maybe I was a bit too cryptic. 

              (PLAYFUL, LIKE SHE S TALKING TO A KID) 

              I m a lawyer and you re a...

                                SHAWN

              I m a tel--(QUICKLY) I work in market 

              research. It s very lucrative, make 

              great moolah, I don t want to brag.

                                REBECCA 

              Ah, brag away. You have no idea how 

              refreshing it is to talk to a guy who  

              actually has a good job or even his 

              own Discover card.

                                SHAWN

                (UNCOMFORTABLE) Yeah, there are a lot 

              of losers out there.

                                REBECCA

              Tell me about it.

                                SHAWN

              (ABRUPTLY) I have a Lexus.

                                REBECCA 

              Oh. (BEAT) I drive a hybrid.                                                                                13.



  SHAWN PUTS HIS HANDS ON HIS CHEEKS AS IF TO SAY:  WHAT A 
    SHOCKER.  SHE SMILES.  SHAWN SMILES BACK.  THEN SUDDENLY, 
  PERRY WALKS OVER TO SHAWN.

                                PERRY

              I m feeling nauseous, let s go home.

    REBECCA LOOKS UP, A LITTLE THROWN, AFTER HEARING PERRY SAY: 
     LET S GO HOME.   SHAWN WINCES, THEN PULLS HER ASIDE. 

                                SHAWN

              I know what you re thinking and I m 

              not gay. True, I live with that 

              ruggedly nauseous gentleman and look, 

              I know you re probably wondering why a 

              very successful marketing executive 

              over thirty has to shack up with a 

              guy, but the truth is...

  SHAWN LOOKS UP, TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING.  PERRY, STILL 
    CRUSHED BY SEEING HIS EX AND HER FIANCEE, GRABS TWO MARTINI 
    GLASSES OFF A SERVER S TRAY.  SHAWN TURNS BACK TO REBECCA.

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              The truth is, Perry s an alcoholic, 

              and he can t live alone right now. 

    REBECCA LOOKS AT PERRY.  PERRY SPILLS ONE OF HIS OVERFLOWING 
    MARTINI GLASSES ALL OVER HIS SHIRT, THEN DRINKS QUICKLY FROM 
  BOTH GLASSES AT THE SAME TIME TO AVOID ANY MORE SPILLING.  
  SHAWN LOOKS DOWN AND SHAKES HIS HEAD  SADLY.   

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              Listen, I...better drive him home, but 

              is it okay if I get your number? I 

              promise I won t make any crank calls.

    REBECCA THINKS FOR A BEAT, THEN HANDS HIM HER CARD.                                                                                  14.



                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              (LOOKS DOWN) Business card? What, I 

              can t get your home number?

                                REBECCA

              I just met you. You could be a rapist 

              or a Jehovah's witness.

                                SHAWN

              Oh my god, thank you. No woman has 

              ever seen me as threatening enough to 

              be a rapist or a door to door cleric!

                                REBECCA

              Well, glad I could boost your ego.

  SHAWN LAUGHS.  REBECCA SMILES.  AS SHAWN EXITS WITH PERRY, 
  SHAWN AND REBECCA BOTH SNEAK ONE MORE LOOK AT EACH OTHER AT 
  THE EXACT SAME TIME, THEN QUICKLY, CLUMSILY LOOK AWAY.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                15.

                                    SCENE C

   (SHAWN, PERRY)

  SHAWN AND PERRY ARE SITTING ON THE COUCH, WATCHING TV.  AFTER 
  ABOUT FIVE SECONDS, SHAWN LOOKS UP.

                                SHAWN

              Yeah. I d let my mother fall down a 

              flight of stairs.

                                PERRY

              What?

                                SHAWN 

              I told you I d get back to you. 

                                PERRY

              You re...a monster.

                                SHAWN

              What? My mother s a quick healer. And 

              suddenly, I kind of wish I was a 

              success right now. That Rebecca was so 

              pretty and funny and cool--

                                PERRY

              Hey, I just lost my soulmate! If you 

              fell in love tonight, that s very, 

              very selfish. (HIS VOICE BREAKING JUST 

              A LITTLE) And a tad cruel.  

                                SHAWN

              I didn t fall in love! God...

  SHAWN AND PERRY GO BACK TO WATCHING TV.  AFTER A FEW SECONDS, 
  SHAWN LOOKS UP AGAIN.                                                                                16.



                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              Besides, even if I did, I don t have a 

              chance with her. She s a big time 

              lawyer and I...phone people during 

              dinner. I was embarrassed, so I made 

              up a couple of little white lies.

                                PERRY 

              (SURPRISED) You lied to a woman?

                                SHAWN

              Not lied. Teeny exaggerations. (BEAT) 

              I said I was rich and you were a lush.  

  PERRY GLARES AT HIM.

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              Look, I needed to justify why I was    

              living with a roommate!  

                                PERRY

              Why didn t you just say I was the   

              broke, struggling artist and you were 

              the one paying most of the rent?

  SHAWN LOOKS AT HIM FOR A VERY LONG BEAT.

                                SHAWN

              Hindsight is 20/20, isn t it?

  SHAWN LOOKS DOWN, EMBARRASSED, AND FEELING A LITTLE GUILTY 
  AND WE...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                17.

    REBECCA IS SITTING IN HER LIVING ROOM, A FARAWAY LOOK IN HER 
  EYES.  

    SUDDENLY, JUSTIN, A HANDSOME, JOCK-ISH 14-YEAR-OLD BOY, AND 
    SCOUT, A CUTE, CEREBRAL 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL ENTER.

                                JUSTIN 

              Mom, Dad s on the phone.  

                                SCOUT

              His new (SHUDDERS) wife too. 

                                REBECCA

              I m not home.

                                JUSTIN

              We just said you are.

                                REBECCA 

              (MORE TO HERSELF) Tell him your Mom is 

              a big fat liar.

  THEY LOOK AT HER, TAKEN ABACK, AS REBECCA LOOKS DOWN, THE 
  SAME GUILTY, EMBARRASSED LOOK ON HER FACE SHAWN HAD IN THE 
  SCENE BEFORE.

                                                                          FADE OUT

  SHAWN IS SITTING IN A CUBICLE IN THE SMALLISH BACK ROOM OF A 
    LARGER MARKETING OFFICE.  HE S ON THE PHONE, A VACANT LOOK IN 
  HIS EYES.

                                SHAWN

              Hello, sir, this is...Lionel calling 

              from Market Facts. (MONOTONE) Would 

              you like to answer a short forty-five 

              minute survey about toothpaste? (BEAT) 

              Sorry, sir. Please don t yell at me. 

              There s no way I could have possibly 

              known you have cancer.

  SHAWN HANGS UP, NON PLUSSED, THEN LOOKS AROUND AND TAKES OUT 
    REBECCA S BUSINESS CARD FROM HIS WALLET.  HE LOOKS AT IT,  
  TAKES A DEEP BREATH, THEN DIALS.

                                                                            CUT TO:

   (REBECCA)

  IN SHARP CONTRAST TO SHAWN S HUMBLE SURROUNDINGS, REBECCA IS 
    SITTING BEHIND AN EXPENSIVE DESK IN HER OWN LARGE, PRIVATE 
    OFFICE.  HER PHONE RINGS.  SHE PICKS IT UP. (NOTE: THROUGHOUT 
  THE FOLLOWING, WE INTERCUT BETWEEN SHAWN AND REBECCA)

                                REBECCA

                                SHAWN

                (INEXPLICABLY USING A DEEPER VOICE) 

              Yes, is Miss Ulrich there?                                                                                19.



                                REBECCA

              This is she.

                                SHAWN

              You answer your own phone? That s a 

              little pathetic.

                                REBECCA

              My assistant is in--who is this?

                                SHAWN

              Um, I met you the other night. (BEAT) 

              The criminally adorable man you

              It looks like rain today. How about 

              our local sports teams? Okay, I m done 

              with the small talk. Do you want to 

              have dinner Saturday night?    

                                REBECCA

              Saturday...

                                SHAWN

              It s the day after Friday on the Judao-

              Christian calendar.

                                REBECCA

              Let me check my social...thingie.

    REBECCA REACHES DOWN AND RUSTLES THROUGH A STACK OF PAPERS, 
    PRETENDING IT S A SOCIAL CALENDAR.                                                                                20.



  SHAWN SQUIRMS A LITTLE AS HE WAITS FOR HER ANSWER.

                                SHAWN

              Please don t make me ask Henderson, 

              Falvey, or Levine.

    REBECCA SMILES AT THIS.    

                                REBECCA

              Okay, I just finished rustling through 

              a stack of old phone bills and it 

              looks like I m free. 

  SHAWN LAUGHS.  SPLIT SCREEN: WE SEE THE TWO OF THEM SMILE EAR 
  TO EAR, THEN AFTER A BEAT...

  SHAWN COVERS HIS PHONE AS ANOTHER TELEMARKETER TALKS LOUDLY, 
  AND REBECCA TURNS A PHOTO OF HER KIDS AROUND SO THEY RE NOT 
    FACING THE PHONE.

    HOLDING A PINT OF HAAGEN DAAZ AND A HEINEKEN.  

                                SHAWN

              You look better today. Um, don t you 

              think it s time you forgot about Tina

              My...mother s. I felt bad about 

              willing her down the stairs, so I 

              thought I d wear the clothes she

              I know, it s so retarded. I really 

              thought I was over her...then I had to 

              see that stupid, stupid article. I  

              just wanted freakin  closure and now I 

              feel even worse.

              terrorist.

              Tina, the locks of hair you took from

   (REBECCA, SHAWN)

    REBECCA AND SHAWN ARE IN A CORNER BOOTH OF A NICE ITALIAN 
    RESTAURANT.  THEIR FOOD IS IN FRONT OF THEM AND THEY RE IN 
      MID-CONVERSATION, EACH OF THEM CLEARLY HAVING A GOOD TIME. 

                                REBECCA

              (SMILING) You really think if you were 

              on the Steelers, you d get over thirty 

              sacks a year.

                                SHAWN

              Absotively. I may not be huge, but I m 

              sneaky. 

                                REBECCA

              (BEAT) If I could sing or dance, I 

              think I could be a Rockette.

  SHAWN LAUGHS.  THERE S A BRIEF SILENCE.

                                SHAWN 

              By the way, I wanted to thank you.   

              That was very considerate, you waiting 

              in front of your house when I picked 

              you up.

    REBECCA LOOKS AWAY.

                                REBECCA 

              I was raised right. (QUICKLY CHANGING 

              THE SUBJECT) I liked your car. 

                                SHAWN

              Yeah, she s a sweet ride...                                                                                 26.



                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              (QUICKLY CHANGING THE SUBJECT TOO) So, 

              how was work? Sue anybody, file any 

              motions, do any...writs?

                                REBECCA

              Boy, you really know all the legal 

              terminology, don t you?

                                SHAWN

              I once nailed Judge Judy.

                                REBECCA

              (LAUGHS HARD) I see...how was she?

                                SHAWN 

              Ah, she just lay there.

                                REBECCA

              Bitch. (TO HERSELF, SURPRISED) God. 

              I m actually having fun tonight.  

                                SHAWN

              You do realize I can hear you, right?

                                REBECCA

              No, no, it s just, I hate first dates. 

              They re so awkward and...this one 

              isn t.

                                SHAWN

              (SMILES AT HER) Yeah. And to think, I 

              almost didn t go to that global 

              warming thing because I didn t want to 

              miss  The Godfather.                                                                                 27.



                                REBECCA

              What s that?

  SHAWN LOOKS AT HER:  UH OH.   

                                SHAWN

              You...you ve never heard of  The 

              Godfather? 

    REBECCA SHRUGS.  THEN, AFTER A LONG BEAT:

                                REBECCA

               Leave the gun, take the cannoli. 

                                SHAWN

              (HOLDING HIS CHEST) Oh god, please 

              don t do that to me again.

    REBECCA LAUGHS.  SHAWN SMILES AT HER FOR A BIT.

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              You know something? You...really 

              cheered me up tonight, Rebecca. I had  

              a phenomenally crappy day at work and--

                                REBECCA

              I m sorry. Is anything wrong?

                                SHAWN 

              You mean, other than the fact it was   

              an insanely tedious, mind numbing day 

              (CATCHING HIMSELF) but who cares cause 

              my job is so lucrative.

                                REBECCA

              Hey, all jobs have peaks and valleys, 

              even the good ones.                                                                                28.



                                SHAWN

              (LOOKS AWAY, GUILTY) Yeah...

                                REBECCA

              We don t have to talk about work. 

              (BEAT) How s Perry?

                                SHAWN 

              Huh? He s good.

                                REBECCA

              Really? No relapses or anything? Cause 

              I ve read a bit about alcoholics and--

  SHAWN WINCES, FEELING EVEN MORE GUILTY NOW.

                                SHAWN

              No, no, he s a trooper. Don t get me 

              wrong, it s one day at a time. I mean, 

              last week, he took his pants off in 

              front of a busboy and...

  SHAWN LOOKS DOWN.  HE SIGHS, THEN LOOKS BACK AT HER.

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              Look, there s something I should 

              probably tell you about Perry.

  SHAWN CONTINUES TO LOOK AT HER, NOT HAVING THE GUTS TO COME 
  CLEAN JUST YET.

                                REBECCA

              You mean, like tonight?

                                SHAWN

              (NODS) Possibly within the hour. 

    REBECCA SMILES.                                                                                  29.



                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              See, um, things have really been nice 

              tonight, almost perfect, except for 

              one thing. (LOOKS DOWN) I...kind of 

              wish I was a better, more honorable 

              person right about now.  

    REBECCA LOOKS AT HIM, A LITTLE BLOWN AWAY.

                                REBECCA

              That...might be the most profound 

              thing anyone s ever said to me on a 

              first date.

                                SHAWN

              Sorry.

                                REBECCA

              No, god, I think it s great. I mean, 

              the truth is, I ve been feeling 

              exactly the same way the last few days 

              and (ABRUPTLY) do you want to come 

              home with me right now? 

  SHAWN LOOKS AT HER IN ABSOLUTE SHOCK AND WE...

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                30.

   (SHAWN, REBECCA)

    REBECCA IS WALKING A STILL DAZED-LOOKING SHAWN INTO HER 
    HOUSE.  SHE TAKES HIM BY THE HAND AND LEADS HIM TOWARDS THE  
    LIVING ROOM.  

                                SHAWN

              Nice place--

                                REBECCA

              Thanks. 

  SHE YANKS HIM QUICKLY DOWN ON THE COUCH.  SHE CLOSES HER 
  EYES, THEN TAKES A DEEP BREATH.

                                REBECCA (CONT D)

              Okay, let me say this quickly, or I 

              won t say it at all. I haven t been 

              honest with you. Maybe it s because 

              I ve lost faith in mankind or menkind, 

              or maybe I just lost faith in myself. 

              I lied to you when I said I don t have 

              kids. I have two kids who are having 

              dinner at my sister s right now. 

              Scout s twelve and Justin s fourteen--

              I had them young! I don t know when I 

              was planning to tell you. Maybe next 

              Christmas. Or if we had a second date. 

              But I don t know, somehow...tonight 

              just kind of felt like the right time 

              to tell you.                                                                                31.



  SHAWN SMILES AT HER, THEN HE LOOKS DOWN FOR A LONG BEAT.  HE 
  TAKES A DEEP BREATH, THEN LEANS A LITTLE CLOSER.

                                SHAWN

              There s something I need to tell you 

              too. I lied to you about Perry.     

              I m the alcoholic, not him.

    REBECCA LOOKS AT HIM, TAKEN ABACK.

                                REBECCA

              Wha...t?

                                SHAWN

              Um, maybe not a full-out 100% alkie, 

              but I have a LOT of demons and you re 

              great, you truly are incredible and 

              you deserve so much better than me. 

  SHAWN IS NOW BACKING QUICKLY TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR.  

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              (SINCERE) I had a fantastic time 

              tonight, I really did, and I, I wish 

              you and...your family good luck.

  SHAWN NODS GOODBYE, FUMBLES WITH HER DOOR AND EXITS.  REBECCA 
    STARES AT THE DOOR FOR A BEAT, INCREDULOUS, THEN SHAKES HER 
  HEAD IN DISGUST.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR, SHAWN SHAKES 
  HIS HEAD TOO, MORE SURPRISED THAN HER BY WHAT JUST CAME OUT 
  OF HIS MOUTH.

  PERRY STARTS TO WALK TOWARDS THE AIR HOCKEY TABLE IN THE 
    LIVING ROOM.  SHAWN CALLS OUT TO HIM AFTER A FEW STEPS.

                                SHAWN 

              I lied to you the other night. I 

              didn t go to my mother s, I had a date 

              with Rebecca.

                                SHAWN

              It s okay, you and your misery are 

              still going to have company because I 

              screwed up.    

  PERRY LOOKS AT SHAWN, CONCERNED, DESPITE HIMSELF.  

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              I was having an amazing time...then I 

              practically knocked over her Williams-

              Sonoma lamp running out the door after 

              I found out she had kids.

              (SMILES) Kids, that s cute.

                                SHAWN

              They re not cute. They re twelve and 

              fourteen! 

                                PERRY 

              Look, you always said you didn t want  

              a relationship till you made it as a 

              writer, so what s the big deal? 

                                SHAWN

              I know, I had it all planned. No  

              girlfriends until I had my own place, 

              a decent car, and a bank account that 

              didn t make tellers giggle.

              cool into my life before I was ready? 

              And give her kids too! I don t like to

              Oh, so she has kids. They re just 

              little humans.

              Thanks for the explanation. Look,

              cop feels...and have iPods.

      (RECEPTIONIST, SHAWN, REBECCA, LISA)

  SHAWN WALKS INTO THE LARGE RECEPTION AREA OF REBECCA S LAW 
    OFFICE.  THERE S A PETITE, SWEET-LOOKING WOMAN IN HER MID 
  20 S SITTING BEHIND THE RECEPTION DESK.  

                                  RECEPTIONIST

              May I help you?

                                SHAWN

              I m here to see Rebecca Ulrich.

                                  RECEPTIONIST

              Do you have an appointment?

                                SHAWN

              No, not technically, but I m a friend 

              of hers. Shawn Gordon.

  THE SWEET-LOOKING RECEPTIONIST LOOKS AT HIM, THEN SCREAMS IN 
    A VOICE WAY TOO LOUD FOR HER BODY.

                                  RECEPTIONIST

              GET OUT!

  SHAWN AND THE OTHERS IN THE RECEPTION AREA LOOK UP, STARTLED.

                                  RECEPTIONIST (CONT D)

              YOU RE STILL HERE. GET OUT!!

  A FEW LAWYERS WALK OUT OF THEIR OFFICES NOW, TRYING TO SEE 
  WHAT THE COMMOTION S ABOUT.  THE LAST LAWYER TO SHUFFLE OUT 
  OF HER OFFICE IS REBECCA.  SHAWN WALKS QUICKLY TOWARDS HER.

                                SHAWN

              Rebecca, I m so sorry to barge in on 

              you like this, but you wouldn t take 

              my calls and I needed to talk to--                                                                                37.



  THE PETITE RECEPTIONIST JUMPS ONTO SHAWN S BACK, TRYING TO 
    PREVENT HIM FROM WALKING OVER TO REBECCA.

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              What the...

  SHAWN LOOKS UP, AMAZED, THEN TRIES HARD TO FLING THE 
    RECEPTIONIST OFF HIS BACK BUT HER GRIP IS TOO STRONG.

                                REBECCA

              Lisa, get off him! Are you insane?

  THE RECEPTIONIST LOOKS UP, EMBARRASSED, THEN SLOWLY GETS OFF 
    SHAWN S BACK.  SHAWN IS BREATHING A LITTLE HEAVY NOW. 

                                REBECCA (CONT D)

              I m sorry. My sister can be a teeny 

              bit overprotective.

  SHAWN LOOKS UP, SURPRISED, AS WE REVEAL THIS IS LISA ULRICH, 
    REBECCA S YOUNGER SISTER.  SHAWN TURNS BACK TO LISA.

                                SHAWN

              Hello. Nice to meet you.

                                LISA

              I hope you die in less than a month.

  SHAWN GULPS.  REBECCA LOOKS AT HIM, THEN CLOSES HER EYES.

                                REBECCA 

              You have forty seconds.

  SHE GESTURES SHAWN DOWN THE HALL TOWARDS HER OFFICE.

                                                                          RESET TO:

   (REBECCA, SHAWN)

    REBECCA IS SITTING BEHIND HER DESK WITH HER ARMS FOLDED.  
  SHAWN IS PACING, TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER THE RIGHT WORDS IN 
  HIS TINY TIME ALLOTMENT.  REBECCA LOOKS DOWN AT HER WATCH.                                                                                38.

              Twenty-nine seconds...

                                SHAWN

              Stop doing that! Okay, let me say this 

              quickly, or I won t say it at all. I 

              lied to you when I said I m an 

              alcoholic and I lied when I said my 

              roommate s an alcoholic. Oh, and funny 

              story, I lied to you before that too. 

              I don t have a lucrative job or a new 

              Lexus. I m a telemarketer, actually a 

              telephone interviewer, which puts my 

              income somewhere between a Denny s 

              waiter and a homeless guy. I ve been 

              trying to make it as a writer since 

              Clinton was in power and even though 

              I ve come close, damn close, I haven t 

              sold my first book yet and I have no 

              idea when I will. But the worst thing 

              I did all week was walk out on you. It 

              was despicable, jerky, and un-

              American. I meant it when I said you 

              were great. You re funny and beautiful  

              and you can quote Clemenza in  The 

              Godfather.  You were the first woman 

              I ve wanted to impress since...

              and way sorrier I ran out your door.  

                                REBECCA

              My god, I thought I was verbose.

  SHAWN LOOKS AT HER AND SMILES.  

                                REBECCA (CONT D)

              I appreciate you coming here like 

              this. Most guys wouldn t. And I guess 

              we both lied to each other. But I ve 

              been burnt before and I ve been doing 

              just fine by myself and I m still not 

              sure why I agreed to go out in the 

              first place. Between my job and my 

              kids, I have more than I can handle. 

                                SHAWN

              Look...I really like hanging out with 

              you and I d love to meet Jenny and

              gave them nicknames. 

    REBECCA SMILES AT THIS.

              Can t we just grab another dinner?                                                                                 40.

    REBECCA OPENS HER DOOR, THEN POINTS TO A BACK EXIT DOWN THE

                                SHAWN 

              Look, Perry, I m sorry. I really am.

              It s just...I went to Rebecca s office 

              to apologize and she agreed to see me, 

              but it had to be tonight and-- 

                                PERRY 

              She went out with you again?                                                                                46.



                                SHAWN

              Yeah, on a quasi date.

    DESPITE HIS OWN RECENT HEARTACHE, PERRY CAN T HELP SMILING.

                                PERRY 

              Good for you, man.

                                SHAWN

              You re not pissed anymore? Wow, I 

              forgot how much easier it is to 

              apologize to a man.

                                PERRY 

              So...what, you have a girlfriend now?

                                SHAWN

              Yeah. Sorta. Not at all. I m going to 

              have to climb Mt. Everest to get 

              someone like Rebecca and I have 

              trouble climbing a rope.

                                PERRY 

              So the worst that ll happen is you ll 

              break both your legs.

                                SHAWN

              I meant mine as a metaphor, I hope you 

              did. (GULPS) It s been eons since I ve 

              even dated and now I have to win over 

              a lawyer and the Children of the Corn.  

                                PERRY

              You ll do fine. Maybe. 

  SHAWN LOOKS AT HIM, NOT VERY REASSURED.                                                                                  47.



                                PERRY (CONT D)

              So, when do I get to meet your little 

              friend?

                                SHAWN

              Soon. 

                                PERRY

              Great...

  SHAWN NOTICES THAT PERRY STILL LOOKS A LITTLE BLUE.

                                SHAWN 

              Hey, maybe we can double or something. 

              (BEAT) She has a sister. 

                                PERRY

              Yeah? Is she nice?

                                SHAWN

              So sweet.

                                PERRY

              I think I need a little more time. 

                                SHAWN

              No you don t... 

  SHAWN LOOKS AT HIM, THEN CLAPS HIS HANDS.

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              Let s lay the flautist bitch to rest. 

                                PERRY

              Nah, it s stupid.

                                SHAWN

              No, it isn t. Yeah, maybe a little.

              But it ll be fun.                                                                                 48.



                                PERRY

              Okay! (LEAPS IMMEDIATELY OUT OF HIS 

              CHAIR) Let me get my photos, poems, 

              and hair.

  PERRY COMES BACK A FEW SECONDS LATER WITH AN ABSURDLY HIGH 
  STACK OF TINA ARTIFACTS.  

                                SHAWN

              Holy sh...let me help you with that.

  SHAWN GRABS HALF THE STACK AND THEY WALK ONTO THEIR BALCONY. 
  THEY TOSS THE FIRST BATCH OF POEMS AND PHOTOS ONTO THEIR  
    BARBECUE AND SHAWN POURS LIGHTER FLUID ONTO IT.

                                SHAWN (CONT D)

              We are gathered here today to say 

              goodbye to a self absorbed, 

              insensitive she-devil who was too   

              damn stupid to see that Perry is the 

              nicest, coolest guy in the world...a     

              guy so generous (LOOKS DOWN) he s let 

              his friend stay with him for years.

  PERRY LOOKS AT HIM AND SMILES.  SHAWN SMILES BACK.  IT S A 
    GENUINELY POIGNANT MOMENT, MADE EVEN MORE SO BY THE POETIC 
  BLAZE OF RED LIGHT EMANATING FROM THE FIRE. A REAL MOMENT 
    THAT S A TAD TOO MUCH FOR TWO STRAIGHT MEN.  SO THEY DO THE 
  MORE COMFORTABLE THING OF JOKING THEIR WAY OUT OF IT.  PERRY  
  PUTS HIS MOUTH A FEW INCHES AWAY FROM SHAWN S.  SHAWN PUTS 
  HIS MOUTH A TINY BIT CLOSER.  PERRY LOOKS AT HIM.

                                PERRY

              (SMILING) Game on?

                                SHAWN

              Game on, asswipe!

  PERRY PUTS HIS HAND ON SHAWN S LEG NOW, ABOUT FOUR INCHES 
  ABOVE HIS KNEE.                                                                                  49.


  SHAWN CLOSES HIS EYES, THEN PUTS HIS HAND ABOUT TWO INCHES 
    HIGHER.  PERRY TAKES A DEEP BREATH, THEN PUTS HIS HAND AS 
  CLOSE TO SHAWN S GROIN AS A STRAIGHT MAN IS CAPABLE OF.  
  SHAWN PUTS A HAND UP TO SIGNAL  GAME OVER.   PERRY RAISES HIS 
  ARMS, VICTORIOUS.

                                PERRY 

              I win!

                                SHAWN

              There are no winners in  gay chicken. 

  PERRY CRACKS UP, SHAWN SMILES AT HIM AND WE...

                                                                          FADE OUT
