    WE SMASH RIGHT BACK IN ON -- MICHAEL.

    In the flesh and looking like death warmed over.  He lies 
      unconscious on the JUNGLE FLOOR as a concerned KATE 
      illuminates his battered and scraggly face with a TORCH --

                                  KATE
                    Michael.  Michael.

    No response -- his eyes stay closed, his condition worsening 
    by the second.  Kate looks to JACK.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    What s wrong with him?

    But Jack s attention is on the TREELINE.  His mind s been 
      racing since the moment Michael appeared, FULLY AMPED.  He 
      SCANS for signs of movement.  Reaches for his GUN -- not 
      about to be satisfied until he gets what he came here for -- 
      QUALITY FACE TIME WITH THE OTHERS.

      Kate s totally focused on Michael --

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Jack!

    But Jack s still looking out at the jungle --

                                  JACK
                    Maybe they let him go...

                                  KATE
                    Let him go? -- he s alone...

                                  JACK
                    We don t know that.

                                  KATE
                    I know he s sick -- and I know he s 
                    been gone two weeks -- stop looking 
                    for (fucking) them!!

      Jack turns, looks at her.  Kate s still pissed, but she s 
      focused on Michael s UNCONSCIOUS FORM as --



                                                                                CONTINUED)
                                                                        www.pressexecute.com(                                                                                        2.

      CONTINUED:11


                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    They didn t just push him out of 
                    the jungle, Jack --

    And as much as Jack d like to get down to business with the 
      Others right now, as much as he hates being turned around 
      again?  HE KNOWS KATE S RIGHT.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    -- He s alone!

      Jack holsters his gun, walks back over to them.

      Kate scuffles aside as Jack leans over Michael, checks his 
      pulse -- his BREATH.  A beat, then --

                                  JACK
                    C mon, let s go.

    And YEAH -- we did detect a hint of DEFEAT in Jack s voice 
      there.  But he s already throwing Michael over his shoulder 
    in a fireman s carry and WALKING OFF.

    And OFF KATE as after a beat, she FOLLOWS --


    A ROOFTOP GARAGE full of LAPD CARS with an impressive view of 
      the LA skyline.

      An LAPD SQUAD CAR pulls up.  Ana Lucia gets out, heads for 
      the station entrance.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    You look tired.

      That s when she sees her CAPTAIN, TERESA CORTEZ, waiting for 
      her.  And Captain Cortez?  She also happens to be Ana Lucia s 
      MOTHER.  Ana is instantly awkward, but cracks a wise-ass 
      smile to cover --

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    Yeah, thanks.

      Cortez doesn t smile.  Just studies her daughter --

                                  ANA LUCIA (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  CORTEZ
                    Where were you last night?

      Ana Lucia makes a calculated effort not to make eye contact --

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    Home.

                                  CORTEZ
                    All night?

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    Yeah.  I made myself some dinner, 
                    watched TV.  Exciting.

                                  CORTEZ
                    What d you watch?

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    Some reality show.

                      CORTEZANA LUCIA
      Which -- ?
                                                  -- A stupid one.

      ON CORTEZ.  She s had enough.




                                                                              CONTINUED)

      CONTINUED:44


                                  CORTEZ
                    Look at me, Ana.

      And Ana Lucia DOES look at her.  A long beat as Cortez 
      studies her.  Not like a mother... but like a COP.  Then --

                                  CORTEZ (CONT D)
                    Let s go for a drive.

      That wasn t a request.  It was an ORDER.  And OFF ANA LUCIA --


      WE RE WIDE ON JACK carrying Michael up a STEEP INCLINE.  Kate 
      can be seen close behind.

      TIGHTER ON JACK.  INTENSITY IN HIS EYES AS SWEAT POURS down 
      his FACE as he struggles.  Kate clocks his effort --

                                  KATE
                    How  bout a break, Jack?

                                  JACK
                    We ll rest at the top.




                                                                              CONTINUED)

      CONTINUED:77


    A COUPLE SILENT BEATS as Jack takes the last PAINFUL STEPS to 
      the top of the hill.  FINALLY, they reach the top.  Jack puts 
      Michael down gently, tries to catch his own breath as he puts 
    a hand on Michael s forehead --

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    No fever.

                                  KATE
                    What do you think happened to him?

                                  JACK
                    I don t...  He s been on his own 
                    for two weeks -- he s exhausted, 
                      dehydrated...

      And then?  Michael MUMBLES something.  Jack leans in --

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Michael?  It s Jack, man -- can you 
                    hear me?  Michael?

      Michael s lips move a little -- Jack STRAINS to listen -- and 
      then Michael s OUT again.  Jack blinks, pulls away...

                                  KATE
                    What d he say?  Did you -- ?

                                  JACK
                          (beat; then)
                    He said  Walt. 

    A MOMENT as that plays.  Kate just STARES at Jack --

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    What?

      Kate clocks Jack s EXHAUSTION.  Remembers the moment they 
      shared before Michael stumbled out -- the closeness of it.

                                  KATE
                    You okay?

                                  JACK
                    Gimme a sec to catch my breath.

      Kate steps up -- takes one of Michael s limp arms and drapes 
      it over her shoulder.  Manages to bring him to a SITTING 
      POSITION.  Jack looks at her, understands the gesture -- 
      she s going to help him.




                                                                              CONTINUED)

                    You don t have to do everything 
                    alone, Jack.

      He considers it, then takes Michael s other arm.  Together, 
      they lift him to his feet.  Jack gives Kate a quick glance, 
      grateful for her help.  AND OFF THE TWO OF THEM, working 
      together to bring Michael home --


      LIBBY and HURLEY are practicing their new EXERCISE REGIME -- 
      PACING DOWN TO THE SHORELINE AND BACK, all the while playing 
    a new game called  I miss  --

                                  LIBBY
                    I miss my bathtub.

                                  HURLEY
                    I miss my hog.

                                  LIBBY
                    You had a motorcycle?

                                  HURLEY
                    No, I had a potbellied pig.  His 
                    name was Chester...

      Libby just LAUGHS.  Then --

                                  LIBBY
                    I miss music.  The perfect song -- 
                    y know, that matches your mood.

                                  HURLEY
                    Dude, there s a whole record 
                      collection in the hatch.  Let s go.

                                  LIBBY
                    There s also a prisoner down there.  
                    Kind ve a mood... killer, y know?

                                  HURLEY
                    Uhm, yeah... good point.

      But something s caught Libby s eye down the beach.

                                  LIBBY
                    Hurley -- will you excuse me for a 
                    minute?

      And lest we be curious as to what it is she just saw...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                        12.




      Ana Lucia s WOUND, as REFLECTED in a SHARP of MIRROR --

                                  LIBBY (O.S.)
                    What happened?

      WIDEN TO REVEAL Ana Lucia s got a needle and thread and is 
      about to sew up her own fucking head using a propped up 
      COMPACT MIRROR.

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    Cut myself shaving.

                                  LIBBY
                    Stop that.  Let me.

      Ana Lucia looks up -- HARDCORE.  Part of her WANTS to go 
      through the suffering of stitching herself, but after a beat, 
      she hands the needle to Libby.

    A beat as Libby sits across from her, studies the GASH.  Ana 
      can feel her eyes on her, waiting for an explanation...

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    Guy in the hatch tried to kill me.

                                  LIBBY
                    You okay?

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    Yeah.  I m fine.

      Libby clocks her -- she s not fine, she s fucking ANGRY.

                                  LIBBY
                    Ana?

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    What?

                                  LIBBY
                    Don t do anything stupid.

      Ana says nothing -- but their eyes meet, hold a beat.  Libby 
      shakes her head... then LEANS IN --

                                  LIBBY (CONT D)
                    Okay.  This is gonna hurt.

      And OFF ANA, GRITTING HER TEETH before the needle PUNCHES IN.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                        13.




      ON ANA LUCIA staring up at something... and then -- WHACK, 
      WHACK -- we see a MANGO PULL INTO FRAME and DROP INTO A TRAP.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL SAWYER having rigged up a device to KNOCK the 
      FRUIT from the TREE.  He suddenly realizes HE S NOT ALONE.  
      Sawyer looks over and sees Ana Lucia packing the mangos in 
      his canvas bag.  He looks suspicious that she s helping, 
      walks over --

                                  SAWYER
                    I got it.

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    Didn t figure you for the fruit-
                    picking type.

                                  SAWYER

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    Can t a person make conversation?

                                  SAWYER
                    A person can.  You can t.  You 
                    ain t ever talked to me except to 
                    say  shut-up  or  five minutes,  
                    and now you wanna be my best 
                    friend?  Whatt ya want, Small-fry?

      Sawyer hits the ground, takes his sack from her.  Ana Lucia 
      smiles, busted --

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    I need a gun.

                                  SAWYER
                    Course you do.
                          (shakes his head)
                    If I d known everyone was gonna 
                    come askin  every damn day, I never 
                    would ve stole  em in the first 
                    place.  This island needs to repeal 
                    the damned Second Amendment.

      Ana Lucia just looks at him.  He GRINS --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    That s the one about guns.

                                  ANA LUCIA
                          (fuck you)
                    Funny.

      Ana Lucia keeps her expression even but Sawyer clocks... 
      something.  Whatever she wants it for, it ain t GOOD.

                                  SAWYER
                    Hey, here s an idea:  Why not go to 
                    your buddy, Jack?  He s got himself 
                    a gun.
                          (snaps his fingers)
                    Oh, right -- he s still traipsing 
                    through the jungle with Kate.

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    If you ve got a problem  cause he s 
                    making time with your girlfriend, 
                    don t take it out on me, man.

      Sawyer looks at her, his eyes cold -- he can throw out wise 
      ass remarks all day, but Ana just hit him where he LIVES.  
      And she doesn t let up.  Takes a step forward.  Eye to EYE.

                                  ANA LUCIA (CONT D)
                    So how about you just give me a 
                    gun.

                                  SAWYER
                    Here s another idea -- scram.

      Ana blinks.  A beat.  But Sawyer s OVER IT now --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    You heard me.  Not git.

      She eyes him like she just might bite his fucking nose off.  
      But after a beat, she breaks away.  Turns around.  And walks 
      off.  AND OFF SAWYER, watching her go --


      ON SAYID, digging a hole.  A VOICE calls out to him --

                                  HURLEY (O.S.)
                    Dude, nice hole.

      Sayid looks up and see Hurley approaching.

                                  SAYID
                    What is it, Hurley?

                                  HURLEY
                    Hey, man... you remember that radio 
                    we made?  I thought maybe I could, 
                    like, get it to play some music, 
                    y know... for Libby.

      Ah.  There it is.  Sayid nods, sympathetic --

                                  SAYID
                    It worked only once and then just 
                    for a minute.  I ve tried numerous 
                    times since and gotten only static.

                                  HURLEY
                    I know, but here s the thing... 
                    even that d be good.   Cause then 
                    Libby ll be all like,  It s the 
                    thought that counts.   Then I score 
                    major points.  Especially when she 
                    sees me holding it over my head.

      Sayid looks at Hurley -- confused.




                                                                              CONTINUED)

      CONTINUED:1616


                                  SAYID
                    And why would you hold a static 
                      generating radio over your head?

                                  HURLEY
                    They didn t have  Say Anything  in 
                    Baghdad?
                          (off his blank look)
                    It s awesome.  This dude like gets 
                    a boom-box, and holds it over his 
                    head outside the chick s window, 
                    and he plays some Peter Gabriel 
                    song.  And bam.  The girl s like, 
                    his.  I mean, after her father goes 
                    to jail.  But then he gets her.  
                    And he s a kickboxer --

                                  SAYID
                    I think I get the idea.

                                  HURLEY
                    You should check it out sometime.  
                    I mean, if we ever, y know, get off 
                    the island.

      Sayid shakes his head.  Charmed by the site of young love.

                                  SAYID
                    If you want to do something nice 
                    for Libby, there s a beautiful 
                    beach maybe three kilometers from 
                    here.  Pack a picnic basket and 
                    take her there.

                                  HURLEY
                    You think that d work?

      Sayid nods.  Yes, he does.  Hurley s starting to dig this 
      plan.  Then Sayid resumes digging, his smile fading as --

                                  SAYID
                    I took Shannon there once.

      Oh yeah.  Shannon.  Remember her?  Hurley does.  Suddenly 
      feels for Sayid.  But Sayid quickly lets him off the hook --

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    Would you like directions?

      As Hurley NODS back...





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                        25.




      ON SAWYER as he walks through the jungle.  He stops.  Looks 
      around.  Produces a papaya from his pack and takes a bite.  
      Chews.  Then, he starts moving again.

    A BEAT.  Then he SUDDENLY STOPS.  There it is -- that 
      RUSTLING behind him.  And then it stops.  Yup, there s 
      somebody out there.  He turns --

                                  SAWYER
                    Come out, come out, whoever you 
                    are.

      Nothing.  Not a sound.  And now, Sawyer draws his GUN --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    I know you re there -- don t make 
                    me come in after you.

    A beat, then -- Ana Lucia emerges from the brush.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Well, well, well -- look what we 
                    got here.  Was Little Red Riding 
                    Hood gonna follow the Big Bad Wolf 
                    to his stash o  guns?

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    Why not gimme that one right there.

      Sawyer puts the gun back in his waistband --

                                  SAWYER
                    I ain t gonna gimmyou nothin .

      But Ana Lucia isn t taking no for an answer, starts moving 
      towards him --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    You and me been over this, Lucy --

      -- She keeps right on going, getting right in his face --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Hey! --

      And WHAM!  Ana Lucia fucking PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE!  Sawyer 
      stumbles backward -- goes down like a sack of wheat!

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    What the -- ?



                                                                              CONTINUED)
                                                                        www.pressexecute.com(                                                                                        26.

      CONTINUED:1717


      Ana Lucia jumps on top of him, tries to hold him down --

      And while Sawyer doesn t exactly hate being this close to her 
      he ain t letting this little chickie get the best of him.  He 
      wastes no time in using his superior strength to flip her 
      over.  BOOM.  Her BACK SLAMS AGAINST the jungle floor.  Now 
      HE S ON TOP and pinning her down.  He leans in close.  She 
      feels his breath on her face --

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    What cha gonna do now, Muchacha?

      They re sweaty, nose to nose.  Heat and anger burning from 
      their eyes, their bodies pressed tightly together.  And just 
      as we wonder what she s going to do, Ana Lucia suddenly jerks 
      her head up and meets Sawyer s lips with her own.

      Holy shit.  Her mouth is hungry; she s more biting and 
      grabbing at him than kissing him.  And even in his surprise, 
      Sawyer wastes no time in opening his mouth to her and giving 
      it right back.

      She reaches for his head and SMASHES IT between her hands in 
    a VICE GRIP.  Her hands slide down his scalp, PULLING HIS 
      HAIR BACK as she ROLLS ON TOP OF HIM.

      ONCE THERE, she puts one hand on his neck while pulling his 
      hair back with the other.  All the while KISSING HIM.  And 
      quickly he s had enough, FLIPS HER OVER AGAIN and HOLDS HER 
      HANDS DOWN OVER HER HEAD.

      HE RUNS HIS HAND down her TORSO and then, in ONE DEFT MOVE, 
      HE PULLS HER SHIRT OFF.  She squirms beneath him, IN ONLY HER 
      BRA.  Now it s her turn -- SHE FLIPS HIM OVER, GRABS HIS 
      BELT, YANKS IT OFF and FLINGS IT out of the way.

      They KISS, angry, HARD, and it s impossible to tell really 
      whether they want to FIGHT OR FUCK.  He looks at her, 
      wondering how far this is going to go.  And Ana s response is 
      to unbutton SAWYER S PANTS...

      WE PAN OFF TO THE BELT, LAYING ON THE GROUND, PARTIALLY 
      COVERED BY ANA LUCIA S SHIRT.

      AND AS SAWYER S GUN FALLS ON TOP OF THE PILE...

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK.

                                                                        www.pressexecute.com                                                                                        27.


                                      ACT THREE


      TIGHT ON A PAIR OF JEANS, laying on the jungle floor as a 
      HAND reaches into FRAME and grabs them.

      WIDEN TO REVEAL shirtless Sawyer.  Getting dressed in all his 
      post-coital glory.  HE STEALS A GLANCE AT --

      Ana Lucia s BACK as she throws on her familiar black tank 
      top.  She turns around, catches him looking at her --

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    What?

      Jesus.  This is AWKWARD.  And now Ana Lucia simply takes off.  
      Not a word or a look to Sawyer who can t believe his usual 
      role of loving  em and leaving  em is being reversed.  This 
      is the PERFECT SCENARIO -- she s fucking leaving.

                                  SAWYER
                    Don t you want my phone number?

      Ana Lucia turns around, her eyes smoldering --

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    If you tell anyone about this, I ll 
                    kill you.

                                  SAWYER
                    Guess that takes cuddlin  off the 
                    table.

      And we PUSH IN TIGHT on Ana Lucia s FACE as she goes, not 
      even a hint of a smile --


      RAIN POURS DOWN AS A LONE CAR cruises ghost-like down the 
      street in a working class neighborhood of modest homes.


      She s out of the car and rushing for the house as --

      Christian tries to PUSH IN PAST Lindsey, but she HOLDS HER 
      GROUND, GRABS HIM -- PUSHING -- SCREAMING --

                      LINDSEYSHEPHARD
      GET -- GET OUT OF MY HOUSE --
                                                  -- This is MY house!  I pay 
                                                  your mortgage!  Let me --

      Christian GRABS Lindsey, TRIES TO MOVE HER.  SHE SCREAMS --



                                                                              CONTINUED)

      CONTINUED:2222


      Ana Lucia rolls up and pops Christian with a forearm to the 
      side of the head -- STOPS HIM -- grabs him in AN ARM BAR.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    OW!!  What (the fuck) are you 
                    doing?!  Let go of me!

      Lindsey clearly has no idea who this WOMAN is who has come to 
      her aid, but she doesn t really care.  SHOUTS at Shephard --

                                    LINDSEY
                    DON T EVER COME BACK HERE!

      Ana Lucia s got control of him.  This is cop 101.  She uses 
      her arm bar leverage to turn Christian around --

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    It s okay.  We re leaving...

                                    LINDSEY
                    You get him away from me!  He s 
                    poison.  He s poison!

      That sentiment LANDS on Ana Lucia as she marches Christian 
      across the LAWN, both of them getting DRENCHED in the rain --

                                  SHEPHARD
                    Let me GO.  I was just having a 
                      conversation --

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    Your conversation s (fucking) over.

                                  SHEPHARD
                    You work for me!

      She TORQUES his arm harder, gets him to the car --

                                  ANA LUCIA
                    Shut up.

      She opens the CAR DOOR and shoves him inside.  Gives one last 
      look back to the house --

      And as Ana Lucia locks eyes with Lindsey, a MOMENT.  And as 
      Lindsey shakes her head, a sense of PITY from this complete 
      stranger...  Pity that Ana is now saddled with the same man 
      she clearly fucking HATES...

      CLOSE ON A STICK OF DHARMA INITIATIVE SALAMI.  WIDEN TO 
      REVEAL Hurley, tossing it into his backpack.

      He s at the COMMUNAL PANTRY, going through the shelves of

                                  LIBBY (O.S.)
                    Hey there, how s it going?

      Hurley freezes, deer in headlights.  Turns around with a 
      guilty look to see -- Libby.

                                  HURLEY
                    Uh... it s not what it looks like.

      Libby eyes the bag of goodies.  Looks back at Hurley --

                                  LIBBY
                    And what does it look like?

                                  HURLEY
                    It looks like... stuff... that 
                    it s... not?
                          (beat)
                    Man, I m so busted.

                                  LIBBY
                    Hurley, I m not here to tell you 
                    how to act around food.

                                  HURLEY
                    No, I m not busted for that, I m 
                    busted for... something... else.

      Fuck.  He didn t want to have to ruin what he was planning 
      but, now he has no choice --

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    I was packing for a picnic.  And I 
                    was kinda hoping... you d go with 
                    me... as, like, an... us thing.  
                    But it was a... uh... surprise.

                                  LIBBY
                    Really?

      Hurley blushes, nods sheepishly.

                    That s so sweet.

                                  HURLEY
                    So do you, like, wanna go?

                                  LIBBY
                    Where to?

                                  HURLEY
                    Can that part still be a surprise?

      Libby grins at him.  Genuinely excited.  And she NODS.  And 
      OFF HURLEY S DELIGHTED SMILE --


      Getting DARK now.  Hurley holds back a tree branch to let 
      Libby through to a small clearing --

                                  HURLEY
                    Watch your head -- almost there...

      Libby ducks and makes her way under.  Stops to look around --

                                  LIBBY
                    You ever watch  The Flintstones ?

                                  HURLEY
                    Sure -- I used to watch it all the 
                    time in the hospital...

      OOPS.  Hurley stammers, the worst job of covering ever --

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    When I... broke my, uh... hip.

      And for obvious reasons, Libby lets him off the hook.  Smiles 
      as they walk on --

                                  LIBBY
                    Well, did you ever notice how Fred 
                    would run by the same thing over 
                    and over again?
                          (points)
                    Third time past that tree.

                                  HURLEY
                    That s a... different tree.

                                  LIBBY
                    It s okay if you re lost --

                                  HURLEY
                    -- I m not lost, dude.  Trust me -- 
                    we re about to walk right out onto 
                    the beach and...!

      Sure enough, they emerge onto SAND.  Hurley turns, HUGE GRIN.

                                  HURLEY (CONT D)
                    Surprise!

      Libby looks around, shakes her head.

                    Hurley, this is our beach.
                          (points to the shallows)
                    There s Jin.

      And sure enough, JIN is there cleaning a FISH.  He sees them 
      and offers a friendly wave.  HURLEY S FACE FALLS --

                                  LIBBY (CONT D)
                          (smiles; optimistically)
                    Hey -- why not have a picnic right 
                    here?  Here, give me the blankets.

                                  HURLEY
                    Blankets?

                                  LIBBY
                    You don t have blankets.
                          (okay; then...)
                    How about drinks?

      Hurley turns red.  Forgot that, too.  Libby smiles 
        reassuringly --

                                  LIBBY (CONT D)
                    Tell you what -- I ll handle the 
                    blankets and you track down Rose 
                    and Bernard.  I saw them pull some 
                    wine from the pallet.

      Hurley even MORE red now.  This sounds like a DATE.

                                  HURLEY
                    Oh.  Wine.  Uh... groovy.
                          (smiles goofily)
                    Hey, maybe if I get drunk enough 
                    I ll be able to remember where I 
                    know you from.

      UH-FUCKING-OH.  ON LIBBY, her smile fades ever so slightly 
      because WE know where he knows her from.

      But then?  She SMILES.  And it s GENUINE.  The sense that 
      maybe it s time to come clean.  Hell -- she LIKES him.

                                  LIBBY
                    Yeah.  Okay.

      Libby turns to go, but before she gets too far --

                    Hey, Libby!
                          (she turns)
                    If you, uh -- wanted to call me 
                    Hugo, that d be cool.

                                  LIBBY
                    You got it, Hugo.

    A big SMILE as she turns back and heads off, we linger on 
      HURLEY.  Smiling WIDER than he s ever smiled before --


      ON A MANUSCRIPT.  WE READ THE TITLE,  BAD TWIN.   WIDENING to 
      find it in the hands of Sawyer in front of his CAMPFIRE.  
      Totally ENGROSSED --

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    Sawyer.

      Sawyer barely looks up as Kate, Jack and Locke (on crutches) 
      approach his tent.  Just turns the page --

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Put the book down.

                                  SAWYER
                    It ain t a book, it s a manuscript, 
                    and I m gonna be the first and only 
                    guy to find out who-done-it.
                          (turns another page)
                    I think I might ve figured it out, 
                    so just cool your damn jets and 
                    take a walk around the coconut 
                    trees.  Only got ten pages to go.

                                  JACK
                    You wanna figure it out?

      But Jack s jets ain t gonna cool, so he GRABS THE MANUSCRIPT, 
      RIPS OUT the last several PAGES and THROWS THEM IN THE FIRE.

                                  SAWYER
                    HEY!

      He leaps up, GRABS a stick -- KNOCKS the flaming pages out of 
      the fire -- STOMPS THEM OUT.  Takes a knee to find that the 
      pages are half ASH.

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    What the hell d you do that for?

                                  JACK
                    Time to give us the guns back.

                                  SAWYER
                    You to, Brutus?

                                  KATE
                    Just... take us there, Sawyer.  
                    Okay?  Stop playing around --

                                  SAWYER
                          (to Jack)
                    What?  You brought her along for 
                    the sympathy vote?  Well she ain t 
                    in my head, Doc, so go screw.

      Ow.  ON KATE, uncomfortable that Sawyer has crossed into this 
      territory.  Jack deals with it another way -- pulls out HIS 
      fucking gun, sticks it in Sawyer s face --

                                  JACK
                    Take us to the guns.  Right now.

      Now Sawyer has a moment of realization.  He doesn t have his 
      fucking gun!  He forgot about it.  He involuntarily reaches 
      anyway for the back of his waistband, like you d check for 
      your missing wallet.  Nothing!  Double fuck.

                                  SAWYER
                    That bitch.  She stole my damn gun.
                          (off Jack s look)
                    Ana Lucia.

                                  JACK
                    How d she do that?

      Sawyer s not about to tell Jack that --

                                  SAWYER
                      Sonofabitch!

                                  JACK
                    What does she need a gun for?

      Locke knows why:  to get fucking revenge.  He realizes he 
      might have seriously fucked up.

                                  LOCKE
                    Jack.  I need to tell you 
                      something.


    A static frame.  WIDE.  Beautiful.  Pastoral.  It s a 
      beautiful night.  A warm breeze riffles the PALMS.

      Hurley sits on the sand.  The picnic basket.  A bottle of 
      WINE next to him.

      Just holding this frame.  Holding on Hurley.  Waiting.

      And although our heart is already aching for him, let s allow 
      the guy one final moment of PEACE...

      Before it all goes to fucking shit.

                                                                  SMASH TO BLACK:
