      A brown Mercedes Benz parked at the entrance to a three story 
      building. Two military jeeps park on either side of it. It s 
      a convoy. SIX ARMED GUARDS stand by the vehicles.                                                                      11-27-12     3.


      Across the street TWO MEN are busy painting a 50 foot 
      portrait of President Hassan Al-Fahed on the entire side of a 
      building. They ve completed his strong featured face, his 
      wise narrow eyes, his mustache -- his hair is JET BLACK. 

      SUPER: ASIMA, 1979.



      Hassan, the boys and the bodyguards exit toward the brown 
      Mercedes Benz parked out front, a pair of military jeeps 
      parked on either side of it. A column of ARMED SOLDIERS stand 
      by the vehicles, keeping the gathering crowd at a distance. 

      Hassan waves and smiles at the curious crowd gathered. Jamal 
      imitates his father and waves as well. The crowd cheers. 
      Bassam seems a little ill at ease with the attention. He 
      tries the tiniest wave, not even lifting his arm above his 
      waist; walks on. 

      A 35-year-old SHIITE with a beard and no mustache jumps out 
      of the crowd, runs towards Hassan -- the guards yell --

                                  GUARDS
                    STOP! STOP HIM! 

      -- but he raises his hand which we now see, is attached to a 
      WIRE. The bodyguards scramble for their weapons --


                GUARDS (CONT D)*SHIITE
      STOP HIM!*Death to the tyrant! 

      He presses the button -- EXPLOSION. Blinding light. Falling 
      clouds of debris -- blood in the air -- dust. Then SILENCE. 
      Then: CRIES OF AGONY: and we gradually FADE IN ON --

      SHATTERED GLASS AND DEBRIS everywhere. Body parts. Mayhem. 
      All of it slightly slow, as if happening in a dream...  

      Bassam lies on the ground. HIS NEW GLASSES: a few feet away.  
      He drags himself towards them. The ringing in his ear muffles 
      the screams. AN OFFICIAL CAR in his POV FLAMES AND EXPLODES. 

      With pained effort, he reaches for the glasses; puts them on; 
      and the scene now resolves into full volume and speed. 

      Bassam s POV: the wounded lay on the ground, CRYING for help. 
      People shouting and running. Fire. He turns and looks at - 

      BASSAM S POV

      Hassan is wrapped around Jamal, shielding him from attack. He 
      then looks down at his hand, it s covered in blood; there s a 
      deep, painful cut -- MUSCLE visible through the torn skin. 
      OFF BASSAM: LOOKING DOWN AT HIS INJURED HAND. SMASH TO --                                                                    11-27-12     6.



      Barry waves from the door, smiles to the Mom and Kid as they 
      leave. We see now that this office is in a strip mall between 
      a Kinko s and a Subway.  



      Establishing.



      Establishing.

                                  EMMA (O.S.)
                    Listen to this... 



      Barry, Molly, Sammy and Emma rush with their LUGGAGE. 

                                  SAMMY
                    I told you not to take the 436, 
                    Dad! You re SO special needs!

                                  MOLLY
                    Don t talk to your father that way, 
                    Sammy. The construction on the 528 
                    would have been just as bad --                                                                  11-27-12     16.


                                  SAMMY
                    Can we just run?

      Sammy leads the family s mad dash into the terminal. 



      A CURIOUS CROWD OF TRADITIONALLY DRESSED MEN AND WOMEN watch 
      as Jamal exits the building, looks at the crowd and waves. 
      They don t wave back. They stare with fearful, hateful eyes 
      as he gets into his FERRARI SUV, so obviously out of place in 
      this rotten neighborhood. 

      IN THE BACK OF THE CROWD

      HAMID, 28, the woman s husband, eyes Jamal, his anger visible 
      through his tears. Beside him stands Fauzi holding a SMALL 
      BOX with one hand, his other hand on Hamid s elbow, at once 
      offering comfort and urging restraint as they wait for Jamal 
      and his goons to drive off before rushing into the building.  



        A procession of state and military vehicles. Dignitaries wait 
      in line on a red carpet. Flags all around. The airplane door 
      opens. Sammy is the first one out, a backwards Bruins 
      baseball cap on his head. Emma deplanes after him, holding 
      her bag and a copy of The New Yorker magazine. Molly is next 
      to join her kids at the bottom of the stairs. Finally, Barry 
      appears at the top of the stairs and looks out at his native 
      country, squinting in the sun. He walks down the stairs and 
      joins his family. RAMZI, now 65, Hassan s advisor and closest 
      confidant, walks over and embraces him. 

                                  RAMZI
                    Salam Aleikum.                                                                   11-27-12     22.


                                  BARRY
                          (a tad uncomfortably)
                    Aleikum Ha Salam.

                                  RAMZI
                    It s good to see you, Bassam. How 
                    was your flight?

                                  BARRY
                    It was fine. I specifically asked --

                                  RAMZI
                            (apologetically)
                    I know, but your father disagreed. 
                    You are an Al-Fahed, after all --
                    there are security considerations.

      Right then a SCREECHING SOUND. They all look up and see 
      Jamal s Ferrari speeding towards them. It s followed by the 
      Goons  car. Both cars screech to a halt. 

      Jamal jumps out, followed by his wife, LEILA AL FAHED, 38, 
      STUNNING. Leila s thick black hair framing a strong featured 
      face with deep EMERALD EYES: the girl from the flashback. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Little brother! 

      He rushes over and hugs Barry with almost aggressive force. 

                                  BARRY
                    Jamal... 

      Jamal pulls away and looks at Barry and smiles.

                                  JAMAL
                    You look good. A bit pale, though, 
                    huh? No sun in America? 

      Jamal laughs, turn to - 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    Molly... Beautiful as ever. 

      He grabs her and lifts her off the ground. She laughs. Sammy 
      clocks Jamal s joie de vivre with admiration. Leila and Barry 
      exchange a freighted look. There s history there. 

                                  LEILA
                    Hello, Bassam. 

      Molly reaches out to Leila and initiates an embrace.                                                                  11-27-12     23.


                                  MOLLY
                    Leila, congratulations on the 
                    wedding. You must be so proud.

                                  LEILA
                    We are very proud and happy, yes.

                                  BARRY
                          (to Leila, proud)
                    You remember Sammy and Emma. 

                                  LEILA
                          (big smile)
                    I do! You guys are so big! 

      She shakes their hands. Barry watches her do this, weighing 
      in his mind a past he never lived. Then he turns to Ramzi.

                                  BARRY
                    So -- to the hotel? 

                                  RAMZI
                    Yes. But first, the palace.   

                                  JAMAL
                    My brother just said -- 

                                  RAMZI
                    Your father asked to see him right 
                    away, the moment he arrived. 

                                  JAMAL
                          (forces a smile)
                    Oh. Well. In that case... 

      Jamal BARKS an order in Arabic. The GOONS grab the luggage. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                          (an uneasy laugh)
                    ...we ll go to the palace. Perfect.

      Jamal smiles tightly at Barry with a searching uneasy energy.



        A beautiful, oriental palace on the outskirts of the city. 
      Surrounded by gorgeous gardens and lakes, the palace itself 
      is a sprawling complex adorned with domes, arches, mosaics. 

      HASSAN, now 71 and frail but still fierce, stands at the edge 
      of the garden overlooking the city, clutching a cane. His 
      wise, old eyes look out at his country. He hears VOICES --

                                  RAMZI (O.C.)
                    Mr. President, look who s here.

      -- and his face lights up. He turns to see Barry --

                                  HASSAN
                    Bassam!                                                                  11-27-12     25.


      -- Ramzi and Jamal approach. Barry walks over to his father. 
      Jamal watches with veiled jealous paranoia as they embrace.

                                  BARRY
                    Hello, father. You look well.  

                                  HASSAN
                    It s been so long. Too long. 

                                  BARRY
                    Between my business and the kids  
                      schedules, it s hard to manage --

                                  HASSAN
                    Is that what you ve been telling 
                    yourself? That you don t visit me 
                    because you re too busy? 

      As Barry takes that hit, a UNIFORMED GENERAL in his 50 s 
      walks over. Hassan bristles -- 

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                    Are you blind, Ziad? Do you see I m 
                    in the middle of someting? 

                                  ZIAD
                    I m sorry to interrupt, Mr. 
                      President, but we ve just received 
                    new intelligence. From Ma an. It s 
                      time-sensitive. 

      Ziad restrains himself, awkward to reveal any more in front 
      of Barry. Hassan nods, realizes this requires his attention. 
      He looks at Barry who --

                                  BARRY
                    Go. I ll make sure the kids and 
                    Molly are settling in and we ll -- 

                                  HASSAN
                    No. Come. You should see this. 

                                  JAMAL
                    They re tired from the trip.

      Hassan doesn t look at Jamal; he just stays trained on Barry.

                                  HASSAN
                    No. I need both my sons with me 
                    now. Both of them. Come.  

      Hassan turns and goes without waiting for an answer, leaving 
      Jamal to give Barry a tight smile and they walk off together.                                                                   11-27-12     26.


                                  JAMAL
                          (not meaning it)
                    It s good you re here.

                                  BARRY
                          (not meaning it)
                    It s good to be here.



      Barry walks out of the palace, STILL SHAKEN, out to the 
      extravagant round pool overlooking the dusty, busy city. 

      Sammy stands under AN ORNATE FAKE WATERFALL in a BATHING 
      SUIT. OTHER WHITE KIDS, younger, play in the pool near him. 

                                  SAMMY
                    Why did you ever leave this place?
                          (after a dunk)
                    It s paradise!

      Barry goes to Molly, who sits with her legs in the water, 
      sipping iced tea beside another white woman -- DANA, 35, 
      blond, English. Emma sits on a chaise lounge behind her, 
      reading a book, sitting beside her chubby COUSIN RANYA, 13. 

                                  BARRY
                    We should go check in.

                                  SAMMY
                    Dad, we just got here! 

                                  MOLLY
                          (having fun)
                    We can stay a little bit, can t we? 
                          (re: Dana)
                    This is Dana, she s a cultural  
                    attache at the American Embassy.
                          (checking with Dana)
                    ...right?

                                  DANA
                    I mostly plan parties, but my 
                    husband and I are big supporters of 
                    your father.                                                                  11-27-12     31.


                                  BARRY
                    Nice to meet you.
                          (to Sammy)
                    Out of the pool! 

                                  MOLLY
                    Barry --

                                  BARRY
                          (to Dana)
                    SAMMY! LET S GO! NOW!

      OFF MOLLY: smiling a wifely smile at Dana. It s all good.  



      Barry, his face somewhat obscured by a HOODIE sweatshirt, 
      climbs into a cab. As the cab pulls onto the mostly empty 
      streets of the commercial district, the first ribbon of light 
      is visible on the horizon. Dawn is breaking.



      The taxi has pulled up before a mosque. Barry gets out. Pays 
      the driver. The taxi pulls away. ON BARRY: looking up at the 
      mosque with apprehension. Struck by the stark beauty of the 
      minaret reaching toward the morning sky...



      Fauzi and Barry step out to a small backyard. 

                                  FAUZI
                    What the hell are you doing here?

                                  BARRY
                    You ve been ignoring my calls.                                                                   11-27-12     41.


                                  FAUZI
                    So you walk into a mosque filled 
                    with people who hate your family?
                          (after a beat)
                    You crazy? You want to get killed? 

                                  BARRY
                      I wouldn t mind some tea.  

      Despite himself, Fauzi smiles, shakes his head. 

                                  FAUZI
                    Come.



      2,000 GUESTS mill in the tree-lined grounds of the palace to 
      The Royal Philharmonic playing traditional Muslim music. 

      Hassan stands at the head of the receiving line, talking 
      amiably with Dana and her husband, whom we ll meet in a few 
      moments, a vaguely debonair bureaucrat, JOHN TUCKER.                                                                  11-27-12     44.


      There are MANY WHITE AMERICANS AND EUROPEANS present, all of 
      them tied to various oil-related or military-industrial work.

      IN ANOTHER AREA, Jamal, Leila, and Ahmed joke around with the 
      Crown Prince of Morocco and Spain s Queen Sofia.  

      AT A TABLE, Emma sits between Molly and Barry. Molly is 
      wearing the sleeveless black dress she tried on earlier. 
      Barry notices the henna patterns on Emma s hand.

                                  BARRY
                    Pretty.

                                  EMMA
                    Yeah. I love my little temporary 
                    cattle brand. Moo.

      A WOMAN walks over to Molly and hands her A DARK SHAWL. 

                                  MOLLY
                          (smiles)
                    What s this? 

      The Woman points across the way to Hiam. Hiam smiles at Molly 
      and animates covering the shoulders with the shawl. 

                                  MOLLY (CONT D)
                    Of course. 
                          (to the Woman)
                    Shukran. 

      She dons it. The Woman goes. Molly turns to look at Barry. 

                                  BARRY
                          (with a smile)
                    Toldja.


      ON THE DANCE FLOOR

      Sammy, with a few of his cousins, is learning a traditional 
      dance when he spots the DARK YOUNG MAN sitting by himself. 

      Sammy separates himself from the group and walks over. 

                                  SAMMY
                    Anyone sitting here? 

      The man is about to answer but Sammy already sits down.

                                  SAMMY (CONT D)
                    I m Sammy. Bassam s --                                                                  11-27-12     45.


                                  YOUNG MAN
                    I know who you are.
                          (points at himself)
                    Abdul.

      Sammy looks out at the festivities, then back to Abdul.

                                  SAMMY
                    What s your connection..?

                                  ABDUL
                    My father is your grandfather s 
                    head of security. My grandfather 
                    was the head of security to your 
                      great-grandfather and my great-
                      grandfather was head of security to 
                    your great-great --

                                  SAMMY
                    I get it. I was just making sure 
                    we re not related. 

                                  ABDUL
                    We re not. But we are -- involved.

                                  SAMMY
                          (flirtatious)
                    Go on.

                                  ABDUL
                    I ve been assigned to keep you out 
                    of trouble. My father had a feeling 
                    that if you were allowed to wander 
                    freely, you might end up dead.

      BEAT. It settles on Sammy that he might be identified by the 
      powers that be as gay. But he opts for bravado and moves on; 
      after all, Abdul is adorable and the night is young.

                                  SAMMY
                          (making light of it)
                    Well. Now I feel very safe.



      LATER

      The BRIDE enters, covered in white, with FOUR BRIDESMAIDS, 
      also in white. The women yell, the men clap and whistle. 

      GUN SHOTS! The guards and the guests shoot pistols into the 
      air, aiming up and pulling the trigger. A SENSE OF CHAOS.                                                                  11-27-12     46.


      LATER STILL, ON THE DANCE FLOOR

      Rows of men, hugging each other s shoulders, dance the 
      traditional Debka dance. It s loud, celebratory, festive. 

      Barry hugs Ramzi who hugs Hassan who hugs Jamal etc... Ramzi 
      switches positions with Barry. Now, Hassan is hugging both 
      his sons on either side of him. He seems happy. 

      The dancing speeds up... Leg up, leg down, left.. Right.. And 
      turn and again... Laughter. Noise. Left. Right. 

      Random GUNSHOTS. Women YELL from the sides. 

      The bride is in midair, on someone s shoulders. SCREAMS of 
      joy. Faster dancing. It s a claustrophobic scene. Jamal lifts 
      Ahmed up on his shoulders. The musicians POUND the darbuka 
      (goblet) drums faster and faster. 

      ON BARRY, CLOSE, as he dances in the midst of the dizzy mess. 
      Pale. Sweaty. Out of breath. As MORE GUNSHOTS GO OFF --



      The boys are alone in the car, looking out the window at 
      ABSOLUTE CHAOS. As we PUSH IN ON THEM, we see FIRE REFLECTED 
      IN THE WINDOW, and their frozen blank expressions hint at the 
      horror they are witnessing. The noise is unbearable: SCREAMS. 

      BARRY S POV

      FIRE. Women and children running from the carnage. The 
      Shabiha chase people up and down the streets. Some are gunned 
      down from behind; some children are slashed with machetes.   

      A DOZEN MEN, some of them as young as 10 and as old as 70 are 
      lined up against a wall across from the Mercedes. Frightened, 
      crying, some with their pants showing fresh urine stains, too 
      scared to move. MILITARY MEN have guns trained on them. 

      A YOUNG BOY runs, ROCK IN HAND, hysterically toward Bassam in 
      the car window. GUNSHOT. Blood squirts from his eye onto the 
      window as he falls right in front of Bassam s little face.  

      Hassan walks into frame, PISTOL IN HAND. He stands between 
      the car and the frightened men. He raises his hand towards 
      Jamal. His fingers curl backwards. He s waving him to join 
      him. Bassam looks at Jamal. We hear: A TELEPHONE RING.                                                                   11-27-12     47.



      Barry, with Emma standing beside him looking bored, takes the 
      ringing phone out of his pocket, holds up a finger -- be 
      right back! -- and slips away to a - 

      QUIETER SPOT, overlooking the city, and covers one ear. 

                                  BARRY
                    Hello? 

                                  BANKER (O.S.)
                    Mr. Al-Fahed? Barry? 

                                  BARRY
                    Yes, this is he...?

                                  BANKER (O.S.)
                    Barry, it s Fred. From First 
                    National. Is this a good time? 

      BACK WHERE EMMA S STANDING  

      She sees Sammy and Abdul enter the main house. She s WORRIED. 

      BACK ON BARRY, PHONE TO ONE EAR, COVERING THE OTHER 

      Barry looks over at his father, Hassan, dancing now with a 6 
      year old grandchild, amidst cheering family members.

                                  BANKER (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    ...hello? Is this a good time?

                                  BARRY
                    Oh hi! Yes. It s a great time.

      Barry takes a few more steps away from the dancers.

                                  BANKER (O.S.)
                    Well... The good news is the 
                    committee approved your loan.

                                  BARRY
                    All of it? The $80,000? 

                                  BANKER (O.S.)
                    Yes. That wife of yours put the 
                    fear of God in me. I wasn t about 
                    to let her down. But before we can 
                    release the funds, I need you to 
                    come in and sign some paperwork. 

      Barry sees Emma head off after Sammy, but he doesn t know 
      where she s going. She distracts him from the call.                                                                  11-27-12     48.


                                  BANKER (O.S.) (CONT D)
                    ...Barry?

                                  BARRY 
                      Anything... yes, of course!  

      OFF BARRY, watching Emma head toward the main house.



      Barry is finishing his phone conversation.  

                                  BARRY
                    Yes! Yes, look, I really appreciate 
                    this, Fred, and I will personally 
                    invite you and your wife to the 
                    opening of the new store! 

      Barry notices JOHN TUCKER, Dana s husband, approaching.  

                                  BARRY (CONT D)
                    Yes, new glasses for all the kids!  
                          (after a beat)
                    I will! Bye!

      He hangs up and pockets the phone as the man arrives.

                                  JOHN TUCKER
                    Mr. Al-Fahed?

                                  BARRY
                    Yes...?

                                  JOHN TUCKER
                    John Tucker. American Embassy. I 
                    think you met my wife, Dana...

                                  BARRY
                    Oh, yeah. At the pool. Yeah.

      They shake hands and gaze out at the opulence.

                                  JOHN TUCKER
                    The stability of our relationship 
                    with your father over the years -- 
                    it s been a great relief during 
                    these turbulent times. Huge. 

                                  BARRY
                          (with some awareness)
                    I can imagine.

                                  JOHN TUCKER
                    I mean, we all want democracy. But 
                    there s a time for everything. And 
                    when it comes to making the 
                      transition, some people are better 
                    at managing it than others. 

      Tucker subtly pulls a CARD from his jacket pocket.                                                                  11-27-12     51.


                                  JOHN TUCKER (CONT D)
                    When you get back to the states, 
                    give me a call. We should talk.

                                  BARRY
                    About what...?

                                  JOHN TUCKER
                    Whatever. Your family. The future.

      Barry takes the card and he and Tucker exchange a look. As 
      Tucker clears, Molly walks up, looking VERY DISTRAUGHT.

                                  BARRY
                    What? What s the matter?

                                  MOLLY
                    Your father.

      ON THE DANCE FLOOR

      Barry pushes through the thick crowd and sees --

      Hassan lies on the floor. His eyes open. Foam coming out of 
      his mouth, convulsing. A DOZEN BODYGUARDS surround him. Ramzi 
      kneels next to him, BARKING orders. The bodyguards lift 
      Hassan and rush him away to a car near by. 

      Everyone runs around Barry, but he s completely frozen. He 
      raises his gaze. Jamal is standing across from him. They 
      stare at each other for a long beat.  



      Barry walks to a TAXI DRIVER, smoking outside his taxi. He 
      drops the bags at his feet.                                                                   11-27-12     58.


                                  BARRY
                          (to the driver)
                    The trunk. There are four of us.

      The driver opens the trunk and helps with the luggage. THREE 
      ARMED BODYGUARDS (one of whom is ABDUL) hurry over as Molly 
      and the kids give their bags to the taxi driver.

                                  BODYGUARD
                    Sir, if you need to go somewhere, 
                    we can take you, this is our job --

                                  BARRY
                    We re fine. Thank you very much for 
                    all your help. Thank you.
                          (to his family)
                    Get in.

      They do. He gets in the front seat and slams the front door. 
      The BODYGUARDS are outside Barry s window. One of them is 
      talking on his cell phone, obviously about Barry leaving.   

                                  BARRY (CONT D)
                          (to driver)
                    Airport, please. 

      THROUGH THE CLOSED WINDOW, Sammy and Abdul trade looks -- 
      neither one is happy about this, but only Sammy shows it.

                                  BARRY (O.C.) (CONT D) 
                    AIRPORT! NOW! GO!

      The driver nods; pulls out. OFF BARRY: DESPERATE TO ESCAPE. 



      Jamal s Ferrari comes to a screeching halt in front of the 
      dilapidated two-story building.  



      The taxi stops in front of the airport. Barry is the first 
      one out, he opens the backseat door. While Molly, Sammy and 
      Emma get out, Barry unloads luggage from the trunk.                                                                   11-27-12     60.



      The road is dark and curvy on the rocky sea cliffs. Jamal 
      drives badly while drinking from a bottle of whiskey. 

      Fatma is by his side, afraid. She holds on to the side of the 
      car, as he takes another turn way, way too fast. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Why are you looking at me?                                                                   11-27-12     61.


                                  FATMA
                    I wasn t looking! I m sorry! 

      He slaps her and then wipes tears from his face. 

                                  JAMAL
                      Everyone s always looking at me.

      Fatma slowly pulls the syringe from her night gown. She holds 
      it, like a knife in her right palm.  

      Jamal unbuckles his belt. Fatma watches him. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    If you re good --

      He pulls his pants down. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    -- once I m president, you can do 
                    this every day.

      He takes his eyes off the road for a second and crosses to 
      the opposite lane. A turn is coming, the side of the cliff 
      hiding on-coming traffic. 

      He takes the turn, in the wrong lane.  And - 

      FUCK! A truck is RIGHT THERE. HUGE. Heading straight for 
      them. LOUD HONK. Fatma yells. Both vehicles hit the breaks. 

      The car misses the truck by a hair but flies off the road to 
      the shoulder, dangerously close to the edge of the cliff. 
      Jamal turns the wheel, hits the brakes... they glide forward, 
      spinning... Fatma s thrust to the left, then to the right. 

      Her hand bumps on the side of the car and ... 

      The syringe flies from her hand. Swiftly making its way to 
      the roaring waters below. The car settles in a cloud of dust. 



      LAUGHTER. A SICK TWISTED LAUGH. Jamal looks at Fatma. He 
      suddenly SCREAMS. Adrenalin washing over his body. 

                                  JAMAL
                    What?! 

      He grabs her face. She looks at him, defiant. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    STOP FUCKING LOOKING AT ME!  

      With one hand, he pulls down his underwear, and with the 
      other he grabs her by the back of the head and shoves her 
      face into his crotch. He looks down, moves her head a few 
      times: she gags and then settles her mouth onto him. 

                                  JAMAL (CONT D)
                    Yeah. That s it.

      He rolls the car back on to the street and away. 



      The car is rocketing down the narrow road. 

                                  JAMAL
                    Yeah. Yeah. Don t stop! Don t you 
                    fucking stop, you little bitch! 

      AND THEN HE SCREAMS IN PAIN -- AND LOOKS DOWN --

      JAMAL S POV                                                                  11-27-12     63.


      As Fatma looks up at him, her face covered in BLOOD, and we 
      hear her spit what must be his cock on the floor of the car.

      ON THE NARROW ROAD

      The car spins out of control, doing full 360 s down the road. 



      The car is spinning out of control. Jamal YELLS. Fatma leans 
      back, and wipes the blood from her mouth with her hand. 

      The car spins to the shoulder, breaks the barrier and flies 
      off the cliff straight into mid air.... And drops to...  

      CRASH! -- it lands on its roof on the rocks below. STILLNESS. 



      PANNING SLOWLY, FIND Jamal hanging upside down in the car, 
      his head bloodied. Fatma s lifeless body hangs behind him. 

      CLOSER: he opens his eyes. His hands clutch at his crotch.  
      HE S ALIVE. He looks over at Fatma --

      JAMAL S POV

      Her open mouth is wet with blood. And there, near her head, 
      on the roof of the car, is laying -- HIS SEVERED PENIS. 

      OFF JAMAL: as he lets loose A STRANGLED SHRIEK OF PAIN.



      We re back in the same moment from the last flashback. The 
      noise is almost unbearable... SCREAMS. FIRE everywhere. Women 
      and children running from the carnage. The men are lined up 
      against a wall, right across from Hassan s Mercedes. 

      A boy runs hysterically towards the car. GUNSHOT. His blood 
      squirts on the window.  

      Hassan walks into frame, PISTOL IN HAND. He stands between 
      the car and the frightened men. He raises his hand towards 
      Jamal. His fingers curl backwards. Bassam looks at Jamal. 

      The door opens and Jamal steps outside. Bassam waits in the 
      car, obedient, scared. He watches as Hassan stoops down and 
      talks to Jamal. Fire all around. GUNSHOTS. Screams of agony.                                                                   11-27-12     66.


                                  HASSAN
                          (yelling over the din)
                    The assassination was planned in 
                    this town. By these people. 
                      Understand...? 

      Jamal nods. Bassam watches.

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                    The hardest thing about being a 
                    leader is that sometimes you have to 
                    do difficult things to your own 
                    people to save them from themselves. 

      Hassan beckons with one hand and a SOLDIER drags one of the 
      men from the wall over to Hassan and Jamal and pushes him 
      down to his knees in front of them. Bassam watches all this.

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                          (to Jamal)
                    It s like cancer. Sometimes you 
                    have to cut off a limb in order to 
                    save the body. 

                                  MAN
                    Please... It s not us. Please. 

      Hassan hands the gun to Jamal.  

                                  HASSAN
                    You do it.   

      Jamal takes the gun from his father. He takes a step forward. 
      Bassam, through his crooked glasses, watches from the car.   

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                    Aim. 

      Jamal raises the gun at the MAN, who s now crying.

                                  MAN
                    Please. I have a family. I have a 
                    son. Like you. Please, don t! 

                                  HASSAN
                    Shoot him.  

      Bassam looks at Jamal and sees: a puddle of piss is forming 
      around his right shoe. Jamal takes a deep breath. His hand 
      shakes. 

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                    Do it. For your country. For your 
                    people. For your father.                                                                   11-27-12     67.


      Jamal shakes. His small finger on the trigger. Then -- 

      The gun falls to the ground. Jamal, in tears, turns and runs 
      back to the car, crawls in past Bassam and hides, CRYING.

      Hassan cusses in Arabic and walks around to the other side of 
      the car and opens the door. Ramzi gets out and rushes to the 
      other side of the car to manage the mayhem while Hassan 
      struggles with Jamal in the backseat.

                                  HASSAN (CONT D)
                    Get out there!

                                  JAMAL
                    No!

                                  HASSAN
                    Yes, get out and do as you re told!

      Bassam huddles on his side of the backseat as Hassan 
      struggles with Jamal, who s kicking and screaming --

                                  JAMAL
                    NO! NO! LEAVE ME ALONE!

      Bassam turns and looks where the SOLDIER is still holding the 
      MAN on his knees there in the middle of the chaos.

      IN THE BACKSEAT

      Hassan and Jamal are struggling as they hear FIVE GUNSHOTS --

      BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!

      -- and they stop fighting and look up to see --

      HASSAN S POV

      Bassam, holding the smoking gun in two hands, his whole body 
      trembling and the MAN lays dead at his feet, his face blown 
      apart by bullets. 

      Ramzi stands nearby, observing with an almost clinical 
      interest what young Bassam has done. Watching as he turns 
      toward his father, looking at Hassan for approval -- which he 
      finally gets. 

                                  RAMZI (O.S.) (PRELAP)
                    Bassam... 

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:                                                                  11-27-12     68.
