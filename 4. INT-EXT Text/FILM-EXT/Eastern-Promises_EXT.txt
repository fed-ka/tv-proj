It's 5.30pm in late December and rain is pouring. The
scant Christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain.
A young Turk (EKREM) runs through the rain with a Turkish
newspaper held over his head. He ducks into a traditional
barber's shop called Ozim's.

We dissolve to a Christmas decoration flashing on and off
in the rain, high on a lamp post in Kilburn High Road. We
pan down the lamp post to the High Road where revelers are
hurrying through the rain. We see a young girl (TATIANA)
hurrying across the street, wrapped in a dressing gown
with a man's overcoat thrown over the top of it. Her hair
is soaked as she approaches an all night chemist's shop.
She is barefoot.

Anna leaves the labor ward, putting on her crash helmet.
She emerges out into the crisp, sunny morning. Aziz hurries
to catch her up and hands her a wrapped gift.
AZIZ
Merry Christmas, Anna.
ANNA
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
He grins.
AZIZ
And you have to open it in front
of me.
Aziz smiles as Anna unwraps a pair of leather motorcycling
gloves. She looks up at him, expressionless.
AZIZ (CONT'D)
At least pretend.
Anna considers the gloves.
ANNA

In the whole entire history of my

Anna rides her big vintage URAL motorcycle through deserted
morning streets. As she rides, we hear Tatiana in V.O.
TATIANA (V.O.)
I am so excited this morning.
Yesterday a friend came back to

about the places on the map that I
look at... Paris, Amsterdam, London.
He's been there for real...

Driving music as we see Anna riding her motorbike through
deserted morning streets again. We should begin to sense
that this is a kind of release for her. We hear Tatiana
in V.O.
TATIANA (V.O.)
When I was little, London was like
a place in the Bible. I wasn't
even sure if it was real. My friend
has told me there is a place in
London where they pay girls to

Anna arrives outside the `Trans-Siberian' restaurant. It
has a Russian-themed frontage in blue and gold, expensively
and recently finished.
TATIANA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He said if I sang in this restaurant
I would make more money in a week
than my father made in a year.
As Anna pulls up we hear a dog begin to bark.

The side door opens to reveal a hard-looking, handsome
Russian man (NIKOLAI), who stops to groom his hair back
from his face and put on a pair of sunglasses as he emerges
into daylight. He steps into a small courtyard, where a
fierce Doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of
a chain.
Nikolai is followed by KIRILL, who is a little younger,
slim and pretty but hard-looking too. Kirill is dressed in
a crumpled T-shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy
night. Nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but Kirill
yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few Russian
curses. Nikolai unbolts the gate to the street.
KIRILL
So you pick up Ozim and his bitch
of a wife and you bring them back
here.
He glances back at the restaurant and speaks softly.
KIRILL (CONT'D)
Then I'll think of an excuse and
we can get away.
NIKOLAI
I'll think of an excuse. Your
excuses are like fucking fairy
tales.
Kirill grins and Nikolai flicks the fob of his car keys.
The lights on an expensive black Mercedes glow in response.
Kirill notices Anna locking up her bike at the front of
the restaurant.

NIKOLAI

Maybe somebody sent your dad a

KIRILL

You're so... fucking unbelievably
disrespectful.
Kirill sees that Nikolai is studying Anna and his grin
fades. We sense jealousy.
KIRILL (CONT'D)
Hey, you've got work to do.
Go...
Kirill grabs Nikolai's face to distract him, gives him a
playful slap, but there is somehow more to it than
playfulness. Nikolai gets into his car.
Kirill glares at Anna as she approaches the front of the
restaurant.

As Nikolai drives away, Anna rings the doorbell beside the
front door. There is no reply. She is about to ring again
when the door opens. We see SEMYON, a Russian man in his
late sixties. He is wiping his hands on a tea towel,
dressed in a spotlessly white apron. He has the sparkling
piercing eyes of a falcon.
SEMYON
We are closed.
ANNA

She fumbles in her bag.

Anna produces her hospital ID and shows it to Semyon.

Nikolai's black Mercedes pulls up outside the restaurant
and parks a few inches from Anna's motorbike. The rear
windows are sun shaded so we only see Nikolai in the
driver's seat.
He gets out of the car and opens the rear
door of the car for an elegantly dressed Turkish lady in
her fifties. Nikolai goes to the other rear door. The
portly figure of Ozim the barber emerges. As Ozim gets out
he gives Nikolai a fifty-pound note.

Anna emerges into the daylight. As she does she sees that
four expensive-looking cars have already parked and various
ostentatiously dressed Russian and Turkish couples with
their children are emerging from their cars. The women are
all wearing furs, even the little girls. The men wear
leather or dark suits. They greet each other exuberantly
as they emerge from their cars. Anna suddenly feels
slightly uneasy. As she approaches her motorbike she sees
Nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car, smoking,
still wearing shades. His bumper is almost touching Anna's
bike.
NIKOLAI
(in Russian)
Nice bike.
ANNA
What?
NIKOLAI
Nice bike.
ANNA
Thank you.
NIKOLAI
A Ural. You don't see them anymore.
ANNA
It was my dad's.
NIKOLAI
How much do you want for it?
Anna has already taken a dislike to this man. He is
arrogant and looks potentially violent. His shades, suit
and tattoos say it all.
ANNA

KIRILL
Aren't you going to weight him

Nikolai drops the body into the water with a splash.

doorway. As she turns Kirill stumbles forwards and collapses
in front of her. Nikolai looks up at Anna, his face
splashed with rain.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
What? You never seen anybody pissed
before?
Semyon looks down at the drunken Kirill and slams the door
of the restaurant. Nikolai sighs, then turns to Kirill
and starts to go through his pockets.

Come on, Kirill. Where are your

Anna walks around the two of them, watching the undignified
struggle as Nikolai finds Kirill's keys. Nikolai smiles

NIKOLAI
I'm a camera. The pictures stay
in my head.
Anna sees pain in his eyes.
She peers at the address.
ANNA
Why did you bring me this?
NIKOLAI
I don't know. I was passing.
After a long moment Anna turns away.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
Oh, and... your uncle.
Nikolai smiles.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
Is it true he was in the KGB?
ANNA
I don't know.
NIKOLAI
Well, he's a brave old man.
That's
for sure.
A pause.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
Does he live with you?
Anna is about to answer but stops herself. Nikolai peers
at her and finally shrugs then turns to walk away. He
gestures at the bike.
NIKOLAI (CONT'D)
I fixed it.
It should be OK now.
Anna watches him walk away into the street.

Crowds of football supporters are streaming away from the
football stadium, where the floodlights are still casting
their glow. There are Arsenal and Chelsea supporters on
opposite sides of the street and there is some mildly
vicious yelling between the two groups. Police are visibly
keeping order.

Among the crowd we see Ekrem. He seems slightly drunk on
top of his normal craziness. He has an Arsenal scarf around
his neck and is looking for trouble, jeering at the Chelsea
supporters across the street.
EKREM
Hey! Hey Kabuka Chelsea! Fuck
you!! Yeah you! Aliverisme!!
Fucker!
A policeman steps up to Ekrem and gives him a shove and he
stumbles a little. As he gets to his feet we notice TWO
CHECHEN MEN who are trailing Ekrem, ducking their heads
away from the line of policemen.
55
55
Ekrem is now isolated from the crowds, swigging from a can
of lager. He is chanting `Arsenal, Arsenal' to himself as
he walks. He stops to take a piss on someone's grave.
In the background the two Chechens are coming closer. As
Ekrem zips his flies, the Chechens are upon him. One of
them grabs his Arsenal scarf and begins to strangle him.
Ekrem chokes for a while and the Chechen loosens the knot.
The second Chechen pulls out an open razor. Ekrem struggles
to escape...
CHECHEN
For my brother...
The Chechen cuts Ekrem's throat then drops him onto the
grave stone.

Semyon emerges into the wine crates and beer bottles in
the yard at the back of the restaurant where the Doberman
is straining at the leash, snarling and barking. An already
anxious Ozim is cowering in the shadows, held at bay by
the dog.
The moment Semyon steps out the dog stops barking. Ozim
relaxes a little and steps forward. Semyon pets the dog.
SEMYON
So what did they say?
Semyon takes a swig of vodka.
Ozim looks severely nervous.
OZIM
They were going to kill me.
Those
Chechens are savages.
Ozim is reliving the ordeal.
OZIM (CONT'D)
I pointed out that I am a Muslim
too and it is a sin for a Muslim
to kill a Muslim.
SEMYON
(irritated)
What did they say about my son?
OZIM
They said they would spare me only
if I delivered Kirill to them.
SEMYON
You are being very honest.
OZIM
I fear you more than I fear them.
Semyon suddenly breaks the neck of the bottle and holds
the jagged edge to Ozim's throat. The dog snarls at
Semyon's feet.

After a moment...
SEMYON
Do they know where to find Kirill?
OZIM
They are like wolves.
SEMYON
Do they know what he looks like?
Ozim shakes his head.
OZIM
No. They have just arrived from
the mountains.
SEMYON
Then tell them you will deliver
Kirill to them.
Ozim is stunned.
He stares at Semyon as if he were insane.
SEMYON (CONT'D)
Tell them to give you two days.

A large public housing estate is being swept by rain.
Christmas lights glow in the windows of the dilapidated
tower blocks. Stepan is walking against the wind, carrying
a bag of shopping. He holds onto his Russian hat to stop
it blowing away. Kids splash in the puddles.
Stepan arrives at the front garden of his small, ground-
floor council flat. As he fumbles for his keys in the cold
we see that Nikolai is watching him from the driver's seat
of his Mercedes. Once Stepan has disappeared into his
flat, Nikolai gets out of the car and approaches Stepan's
flat.

Anna drives her motorbike through North London streets.
Rain is falling.

Anna is standing in the falling rain, staring over at the
trans-Siberian restaurant. The restaurant is busy, with
the noise of revelers swelling every time the door is
opened.
Anna seems to be exiled from where she should really be -
Inside a restaurant like this, with its danger and vibrancy.
Suddenly she is illuminated by headlights. She turns and
sees that Nikolai is pulling up in his Mercedes. Kirill is
in the passenger seat. Nikolai gets out of the car and
stops when he sees Anna. Anna is like a fox caught in
headlights.
NIKOLAI
What are you doing here?

Kirill studies the gaze between Nikolai and Anna and senses
the connection.
KIRILL
If you're passing, you pass. You
keep going, bitch. Nikolai, come
on...
Kirill grabs Nikolai's arm, and after peering at Anna for
a moment, he turns to go with Kirill. Anna gathers her
courage.
ANNA
Family is important to you people
isn't it?
KIRILL
(laughing)
'You people'?
(in Russian)
What the hell is she talking about?
Music swells from the restaurant.
ANNA
Tell Semyon the baby I delivered
on Christmas Eve is his daughter.
Kirill and Nikolai stop. A swell of laughter from the
restaurant. Anna is about to continue but Nikolai steps
forward and places two fingers on Anna's lips to stop her
from saying anymore. Anna tears his hands from her mouth.
At the same time Kirill yells in Russian.
KIRILL
(in Russian)
What did she say?!
Anna is terrified but angry too.
She yells.
ANNA
When he raped her she was a virgin.
Then they gave her pills. Semyon

She was a child!
Kirill slaps Anna hard.
Nikolai grabs Kirill and pulls
him away.
KIRILL
You don't use my father's name!
You don't say that filth about
him...
He goes for Anna again, and this time Nikolai shoves Kirill
to the wet ground. He looks up at Nikolai and slowly gets
to his feet. He wipes his hands then stares into Nikolai's
eyes.
KIRILL (CONT'D)
Don't even look at her any more.
Headlights from a passing car sweep the scene....
KIRILL (CONT'D)
That's an order.
Nikolai peers at Anna for a moment.
Anna's voice is defiant
but cracking with fear.
ANNA
Tell him what I said.
Nikolai has taken what Anna said on board.
He speaks
softly...

There is nothing to tell.

You want to come in?! Maybe we

Anna stares back. Nikolai peers at her for a moment before
grabbing Kirill and pulling him away towards the restaurant.

Sweet Russian choral music covers the next four scenes.
The street outside the restaurant is now flooding with
rain. A Daimler and a Bentley are already parked. A large
SUV pulls up and a hard-looking Russian man in his sixties
(VALERY) is ushered from the car by bodyguards in suits
and shades.
He is greeted by a darker-looking man in his fifties (THE
GYPSY) who has a fur coat around his shoulders. Semyon is
waiting on the doorstep, dressed in a fine dark suit.

A wizened old Russian man (THE TATTOOIST) arrives at the
kitchen door, carrying a battered leather case. The kitchen
door is opened as he arrives and Semyon greets him.

We are in St. Pancras, North London.
More rain. Ozim is waiting nervously, blowing into his
hands against the cold. The Turkish bath building is a
Victorian red-brick edifice.
Nikolai pulls up in his Mercedes.

It's cold and the wind is blowing. We see rooftops behind
them. Yuri is lighting Nikolai's cigarette. Nikolai is
wearing Yuri's overcoat loosely over his hospital gown.
Yuri lights his own cigarette and they smoke in silence
for a moment.
NIKOLAI
You got my message?
Yuri chuckles.
YURI
Using a dead body to file a progress
report must be against FSB
regulations.
NIKOLAI
It's called improvisation.
YURI
You've been improvising quite a
lot lately. And taking risks.
He glances at the cuts on Nikolai's hands...
YURI (CONT'D)
(in Russian)
Maybe too many.
Nikolai suddenly glares at Yuri.
NIKOLAI

You didn't come here to give me
flowers...
Yuri shakes his head and prepares to deliver bad news.
Nikolai turns as if to go back inside. Yuri grabs Nikolai's

...and in light of other violent

Russian desk at Scotland Yard have
made an official request to the
Russian embassy that your undercover

Nikolai doesn't react for a moment.
YURI (CONT'D)
(in Russian)
You have gone beyond what was
agreed.
With his cigarette dangling from his mouth Nikolai begins
to unbutton his overcoat..
YURI (CONT'D)
In my opinion you should see this
as good news. You've been in the
zone far too long...
Nikolai turns and slowly pulls open the overcoat and the
thin hospital gown beneath it.
He reveals the eight-pointed star tattoos on his chest and
Yuri reacts with absolute astonishment.
YURI (CONT'D)
My God...
NIKOLAI
If they terminate the operation
now, they will be wasting this...
A pause. Yuri looks shocked and slightly horrified.
Nikolai too suddenly seems almost ashamed that he has got
this far. After a long silence Nikolai mumbles.

Yuri laughs.

What drugs are they giving you?
Maybe it's the anesthetic speaking.

Nikolai lights another cigarette from the stub of the one

The main entrance of the hospital is busy with visitors
and staff. There is a `Happy New Year' banner across the
entrance. In amongst the bustle of visitors we spy a young

his hand.
We then see that it is Kirill, entering the hospital.

Kirill is at the wheel of Nikolai's Mercedes. He swigs
from his bottle of vodka, which is now more than half empty.
He fires the engine and reverses. A car passing by has to
slam on its brakes. Kirill yells.
KIRILL
Hey, you stupid fucker!!
A horn blows. The passing car accelerates angrily by. Then
we hear a baby crying. Kirill looks into the half darkness
of the back seat and we see Kirill's black sports bag,
partially zipped up. Christine is crying inside it, her
little grasping hand protruding past the zipper. Kirill
speaks softly.

stops crying. He peers at her, wiping away tears.

Kirill sobs then Christine cries...

KIRILL
You stay where you are.

She's cold, Kirill.
Kirill suddenly screams as another barrage of fireworks
explodes. Nikolai doesn't move. Kirill is dangerously
close to the edge of the dock. Maybe he'll throw himself
in too.
NIKOLAI
Kirill, a vor doesn't kill little

he edges him away from the dockside. The three of them are
locked in a long embrace.
