FOREST - SUNSET
12
SARAH races through the thick forest. Her bare, bloody feet
and legs stomping over the hard dirt, branches, shrubs,
anything in her way. Not too far behind...
THE CONCEALED FIGURE... (the majority of him still hidden)
follows her. WEAPON IN HAND.
4.
SARAH... pushes through some thick brush, but... trips,
falls. She SCREAMS IN PAIN, grabs her foot, notices... A
LARGE GASH ACROSS THE BOTTOM. Sarah turns, hears...
THE CONCEALED FIGURE.. approaches in the distance.
SARAH... wills herself up, limp/runs away.
13
FOREST - CLEARING/CLIFF - SUNSET
13
Sarah exits the thick woods to discover, to her horror... SHE
STANDS AT THE EDGE OF A CLIFF, takes a peek over the side...
SARAH'S POV - JAGGED ROCKS and a small STREAM at the bottom,
200 feet below. A WATERFALL flows steadily nearby.
Before Sarah can fully digest the situation...
THE CONCEALED FIGURE exits the forest, SPINS THE WEAPON in
his hand. Anticipating its use.
Sarah FREEZES in her spot. Breaths get shorter, heavier.
Her eyes dart in every direction. What to do?
The Concealed Figure TAKES ONE STEP FORWARD and... SARAH
JUMPS OFF THE CLIFF. Rather that fate than the other.
The Concealed Figure walks up to the edge, looks over...
AT THE BOTTOM... Sarah's dead body lays twisted and bloody
among the rocks. The waterfall crashes next to her. BLOOD
mixes with the water turning it a deep RED.

PASSAT (MOVING) - DAY

MIKE WARREN, late 20s, with a devilish grin and looks to
kill, sits at the wheel. Even a flashy pair of sunglasses
can't mask the twinkle in his eye.
SHERYL JAMES, late 20s, rides shotgun. This beauty's got it
all: toned bod, sharp mind and a heart-stopping smile.
An opened bag of chips sit in her lap. A couple of Diet
Cokes in the cup-holders. She cradles a cellphone MP3
player.

MIKE
Come on, hit me.
SHERYL
(Flipping through tunes)
Chill...I gotta find -- alright.
MIKE
You got one?
Sheryl hits the "Play" button.
MIKE
"Warning Shots", Thievery Corporation.
Mike grins.
Sheryl rolls her eyes.
MIKE
Come on.
Next one.
Sheryl scrolls again, hits play.
MIKE
"Bullets" by the Editors.
Sheryl frowns.
Mike grins and shoots her a wink.
SHERYL
You loaded these songs. You don't
need to be so impressed with yourself.
MIKE
I know I don't have to be.
SHERYL
I haven't even heard of half these
bands.
MIKE
It's called good music. You should
try to familiarize yourself with it,
instead of listening to the crap you
do.
SHERYL
I listen to crap?
MIKE
Hurts me to be the one to tell you.
SHERYL
I'm sure it does.
6.
MIKE
You gotta be more like me, baby.
Think new, fresh, cutting edge. I'm
looking for the next Beatles, U2 or
Radiohead.
Sheryl scans through the MP3 player, spots one and smiles.
SHERYL
So, where does this band fall into
that group?
The music starts. BOY'S DON'T CRY, "I WANT TO BE A COWBOY"
blares.
SHERYL
Fresh, new or cutting edge?
Mike immediately begins to backtrack.
MIKE
How'd that get on there?
SHERYL
You loaded the songs.
You tell me?
MIKE
Must be a mistake.
SHERYL
Says here you've listened to it 86
times.
Busted.
SHERYL
Is this true? Have you always wanted
to be a cowboy?
Sheryl spies more...
SHERYL
You also got "Men Without Hats"
greatest hits? I didn't know they
qualified for a greatest hits album.
Can you break me off a little "Safety
Dance"?
Mike reaches for the MP3 player.
MIKE
Okay, give me that.
The Passat speeds past a "West Virginia" state sign.

Sheryl checks her bag as well. She clips a blue hikers' towel
to her waist. Mike checks his cell phone. No service.
MIKE
You getting anything?
Sheryl checks her phone and shakes her head "no."
MIKE
I'll lock them in the car.
SHERYL
I'll take mine.
MIKE
Why?
SHERYL
Just to annoy you.
MIKE

In an emergency, I'd rather have a

not have a phone that may work up

Huh? Mike shakes his head, puts his phone in the glove
compartment.
Sheryl tucks her phone and the flier into a side pocket of
her backpack. Zips it shut.
ANGLE ON - Mike's keys and his Boston Red Sox key chain.
Mike locks the door.
MIKE
Okay, we all set?
SHERYL
(Excited)
Yup.
MIKE
Let's do this.
Mike pulls on his backpack, starts walking. Sheryl doesn't
move. She eyes their tent still resting on the car's roof.
SHERYL
Hey, Einstein. What do you think,
leave the tent or maybe take it with
us?
Mike swallows his pride and retreats to the car.
MIKE
I was just seeing if you were paying
attention.
Mike comes back to the car for the tent.
Sheryl shakes her

MIKE (cont'd)
rehash so-called glory days if you

a super-model.
SHERYL
So what were you?
MIKE
Me?
I was a stoner.
SHERYL
So what does that mean?
MIKE
How the hell am I supposed to
remember? I was high all the time.
Sheryl swallows some water, checks her compass.
Sweat rolls down Mike's forehead, stinging his eyes. Sheryl
doesn't have that problem. She's wearing a red bandana.
MIKE
Where'd you get that bandana?
SHERYL
It's cute, right? I stopped by that
Army-Navy store on Grover yesterday.
Keeps the sweat out of your eyes.
MIKE
And when you were buying it, you
didn't think that maybe...
SHERYL
Oh...well...it was the last one...
MIKE
The last one?
SHERYL
Yeah...
MIKE
The entire Army-Navy store... sold out?
SHERYL
Completely. There was some sort of
run on bandanas at the last minute.
Sheryl stifles a CHUCKLE. Mike shakes his head, then... she
pulls out a GRAY BANDANA, hands it to him.

Sheryl turns, as she does... Mike pinches her behind, she
playfully SHRIEKS, hustles away from him, but he pursues her,
as they both CRACK UP, they spill off the trail...
OFF THE PATH... Mike and Sheryl continue their horseplay,
when... SHERYL LOOKS DOWN, SCREAMS!
A BLOODY, MUTILATED FOX LAYS INSIDE A RUSTED BEAR TRAP. The
Steel jaws of the trap have sliced the body in two. The kill
looks fresh.
MIKE
Fucking nasty.
SHERYL
What is it?
MIKE
Looks like it's a, or was, a fox.
Come on.
Mike and Sheryl head back to the path.

BASE TRAIL #2 - DAY

Mike and Sheryl reach a small clearing. There are a number of
signs pointing toward different trails. (Donner Trail, Willow
Creek Bridge, Timber Falls, etc.)
Sheryl grabs the map and some water. Mike swigs some water,
munches on trail mix, takes a peek in the guidebook.
SHERYL
What do you think?
"Cannibal" Trail
or the other one?
MIKE
Guidebook says a couple of these other
trails lead to some pretty sweet
views.
SHERYL
We're not Lewis and/or Clark. We're
gonna stick to one of the ones the
Ranger said.
14.
IDA (OS)
You folks need some help?
IDA FOSTER, 40s, approaches, wheeling some supplies in a
handmade wagon. She is worn, haggard, but has a friendly,
smile. She wears a flannel shirt, old jeans and dirty boots.
MIKE
We're just going over our options
here.
IDA
Well, take it from me, any way you
choose, you can't go wrong.
SHERYL
The Ranger at base suggested Donner
Trail or...
IDA
...Willow Creek Bridge. I think Sam
only knows those two trails. Well.
Between those, I'd pick Donner Trail.
Willow Creek will shoot you to the
top, but there's not as much to see.
Donner weaves through Peddler's Point,
it's a better hike and prettier all
around view.
SHERYL
(To Mike)
What do you think?
Then, she notices a ring on Sheryl's finger.
IDA
That's a pretty ring.
SHERYL
Thank you.
IDA
Not your traditional wedding ring, but
it's all the same in the Lord's eyes.
How long have you two been wed?
Sheryl and Mike trade looks.
SHERYL
Oh... we're not married.
Not yet
anyway.
Mike shoots her a look: "not yet?"
15.
SHERYL
It's a ring my father gave me for
graduation.
IDA
(embarrassed)
Oh, I'm sorry. You just looked like
you was married is'all. Both so
beautiful.
(Beat)
I'm just an old fashioned silly-bird.
I need to mind my own business.
SHERYL
No, it's fine.
MIKE
(changing topics)
Which one of those trails got the best
clearings?
IDA
Clearings? Neither will give you much
in the way of clearings. But, there's
another path, this one here.
(Points to the map)
Timber Falls. Its got some beautiful
vistas and one of the prettiest falls
you'll ever see.
MIKE
Sounds perfect.
(To Sheryl)
Yeah?
IDA
Well, I'll leave you to it. Last
thing you need is me fussing'round
you, taking you from your private
time.
SHERYL
MIKE
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks for the tip.
Ida walks off, but stops only a few feet away.
IDA
I'm just gonna say it and go, but if
you two were to marry... I bet the
Lord would bless you with a happy,
healthy and handsome child. Good luck
and God bless you both.
16.
Sheryl and Mike don't know how to respond.
Ida leaves.
Once
out of earshot...
SHERYL
I suddenly feel the need for
confession.
MIKE
(Still lingering on...)
Not yet? Love taking your shots,
don't ya?
Sheryl shoots him a stern, but playfully sexy, look.
SHERYL
When I see an opening.
MIKE
(Checks map)
That path she was talking about winds
through these falls. What do you
think?
SHERYL
I think... if you get eaten by a bear
and there isn't a Ranger around, I'm
not carrying what's left of you down
this mountain.
MIKE
And they say romance is dead.
(Smiling wide)
Timber Falls it is.
They throw on their backpacks and head on their way.
MIKE
Who's Lewis and/or Clark?
SHERYL
You really were stoned through high
school.
As Mike and Sheryl trek up the path...
ANGLE ON - The directional sign, "Timber Falls"
23
TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #1 - DAY
23
Looking back down on the thin path. FIND - Sheryl and Mike
continuing their trek. (SPLINTER UNIT)
Mike maneuvers around a massive tree. He freezes. Gestures
for Sheryl to be quiet and mouths the words, "Don't Move."
17.
Sheryl stops, startled.
Mike motions towards...
A MOUNTAIN STAG, with magnificent antlers, chews on a plant
in the distance.
Sheryl quietly slides out her digital camera.
Snaps a photo
of the animal.
The Stag stops chewing and looks at them.
After a long beat,
the Stag skips away through the trees.
Sheryl watches the animal disappear, smiles.
Mike removes his backpack and crosses to Sheryl. He helps
remove her backpack and kisses her. She kisses him back.
ANGLE ON - Sheryl's heart-shaped locket through her shirt.
MIKE
You're going to lose that out here.
SHERYL
It's fine. I never take it off. Not
since you gave it to me. Betcha don't
remember...
MIKE
...February 27, 2006.
Sheryl stares incredulously, romantically at Mike.
Speechless.
MIKE
I remember every moment with you.
SHERYL
I've got you so whipped.
They kiss. Sheryl climbs onto Mike's lap. He leans back,
better positioning, places his hand down, when...
MIKE
OUCH!
FUCK!
Mike brings his hand back up.
BLOOD trickles out of a SMALL
CUT across his palm.
SHERYL
What?
MIKE
My hand... Something stuck it.
18.
Sheryl quickly examines the cut. Mike quickly becomes
flustered, woozy. He turns away from the wound.
SHERYL
It's okay. It's not too deep.
Let me
get the first aid kit.
Sheryl rummages through her bag. Mike, in more psychological
discomfort than physical, looks away wincing.
Sheryl returns, wipes the blood away best she can.
She
applies some peroxide...
MIKE
Fuck.
That stung.
SHERYL
Gotta clean the wound, baby.
24
OBSCURED POV - THROUGH TREES--

From a distance... A SICKLE BLADE enters frame, pulls a
branch aside. Sheryl attends to Mike's wound.
The POV narrows... solely on SHERYL.
25
TIMBER FALLS, TRAIL #1--
25
Mike looks at Sheryl, a twinge of embarrassment in his eyes.
MIKE
You know me and blood... we don't do
so well.
SHERYL
I know.
(She finishes)
All done.
OFF SCREEN: CRUNCH of something stepping on a thicket.
Sheryl glances toward the sound.
Mike admires the dressing
of the wound.
MIKE
Not bad, Nightingale.
Not bad at all.
SHERYL
Did you hear something?
Mike follows her eye-line.
There's a softer CRUNCH.
MIKE
It's probably the deer.
19.
SHERYL
The deer went in the other direction.
Mike's demeanor suddenly becomes cold, creepy.
MIKE
Maybe it's someone, or something,
stalking us.
SHERYL
Quit it.
MIKE
Something inhuman watching our every
move.
SHERYL
I said, knock it off.
MIKE
Something coming for you, Sheryl.
Sheryl straps on her backpack.
SHERYL
Just when I think there's hope for
you.
MIKE
What?
SHERYL
You're an asshole.
Sheryl walks away.
MIKE
This is a joke. You're not really mad,
are you? Sheryl...?
She turns the corner and is out of sight.
MIKE
I'm sorry!
(Under his breath)
Unbelievable.
Mike's in disbelief.
He grabs his backpack, heads after her.
MIKE
Sheryl!
He turns the corner, looks up, but doesn't see her.
The path
winds like a snake.

MIKE
Sheryl, wait up!
Mike moves up the winding path.
He stops, eyes searching.
Something's wrong.
The path opens up. Mike can now see a hundred yards ahead,
but... No sign of Sheryl.
MIKE
(Calls out)
Sheryl?! This isn't funny.
Silence.
Two birds SCREAM and fly from their perch overhead. Mike eyes
the birds, then takes off.
Mike's heart-rate increases. He moves quickly up the path, a
steep incline. He brushes past a bush and stops. Lying just
off the path... SHERYL'S BLUE HIKER'S TOWEL. He picks it up.
MIKE
Sheryl?!
No reply.
His heart now POUNDING.
Mike moving faster. Up ahead, he stops again, finds...
SHERYL'S RED BANDANA.
MIKE
Sheryl!
Silence.
Mike picks up the bandana. He's flying.
He cuts through
some tiny evergreens, off the path...
26
JUST OFF THE TRAIL, TIMBER FALLS #1 - DAY
26
Mike freezes when he sees... Sheryl's backpack lies against
a tree. A few feet farther along, her cut-off jean shorts.
Next to them... her shirt. But no Sheryl, until...
SHERYL (OS)
Good old Hansel. Following the trail
of bread crumbs.
Mike turns to see Sheryl lying against a rock, wearing just
her bra and panties. She smiles at him coyly. Mike exhales
deeply. Relieved, but fuming.
MIKE
You bitch.
SHOOTING SCRIPT
OCTOBER 17, 2006
21.
SHERYL
Doesn't feel good to be teased, does
it?
Okay, he had that coming.
MIKE
Truce?
SHERYL
Truce.
He takes her in.
She's quite a sight. He sits down next to
her. They kiss.
Then... Mike breaks the embrace.
MIKE
Don't disappear on me again.
Sheryl mouths the words, "I promise."
Crosses her heart.
He leans in, they kiss again.
Soft and sweet at first.
Then
it deepens.
Sheryl rubs his chest and removes his shirt. They kiss
again. Harder this time. Their hands all over one another.
Mike slides his hand under Sheryl's panties, between her
legs. She moans softly. Sheryl unhooks her bra and is about
to remove it, when:
DARRYL (O.S.)
Hey, Brody, Lonnie. Check this out.
DARRYL, 30, a skinny local with a twisted smile and LONNIE,
20's, a slob, emerge from the forest. They are followed by...
BRODY, 35, scruffy and unshaven, their ringleader. Brody
clutches a shotgun in one hand and a weathered sack in the
other.
DARRYL
Looks like we got ourselves a little
party.
Brody and Darryl ogle Sheryl. She tucks herself behind Mike,
who shifts quickly into protective mode. She snaps her bra
back closed.
MIKE
We were just moving our way up the
mountain.
22.
LONNIE
You were moving your way'round more
than just that.
Sheryl eyes her discarded clothes.
Darryl spots them too.
He grabs the shorts, SNIFFS them.
DARRYL
(Referring to the smell)
Like a peach.
Mike tries to seem relaxed and friendly.
BRODY
You folks best be careful about what
you do up here... Never know who's
watching.
MIKE
Appreciate the advice...I think we
learned our lesson.
Brody nods as he looks them up and down.
LONNIE
You city folk, ain't ya? Up from
Charleston roughing it, seeing how the
"other" half lives?
MIKE
No, we're from Virginia, just up for a
weekend trip. And, uh... you folks
live up here?
Brody glances at Darryl and Lonnie, then back at Mike.
BRODY
It's easy to spot the city folk. It's
like they're trying to be friendly,
when really they don't want to be.
MIKE
I think you just startled us is all.
Sheryl looks over at...
...Lonnie sticks his tongue between his fingers, rapidly
flails it about.
Uncomfortable silence.
23.
MIKE
We'll just be on our way.
(Re: Sheryl's shorts)
May I have those?
A bold move from Mike.
DARRYL
Finders keepers.
Long beat.
Tension high.
BRODY
Darryl.
Brody concedes, gestures to Darryl to give the shorts back.
Darryl reluctantly obliges.
Mike passes them to Sheryl who slides them on. Darryl and
Lonnie soak in every inch of Sheryl as she does.
Mike takes Sheryl's hand. They make a move, but... Brody
stops them with the barrel of his shotgun.
BRODY
Where you runnin' off to?
LONNIE
Yeah, we just getting acquainted and
shit.
Mike glances down at the barrel that runs across his chest.
He can no longer hide his fear.
MIKE
We just want to get a little further
along before the sun sets.
Darryl eyes the sky.
The sun beams down through the trees.
DARRYL
Plenty of time'fore that.
MIKE
Look. We don't want any trouble.
We
just want to be on our way...
BRODY
And why do you suppose we mean to make
trouble?
Mike looks down at the gun.
Brody smiles a yellow smile.

BRODY
You folks enjoy the spirits?
MIKE
Excuse me?
The what?
DARRYL
Spirits.
LONNIE
Booze!
MIKE
Sure.
Yeah.
Brody hands Darryl the shotgun and drops his sack. Brody
pulls a mason jar with clear liquid out of the sack.
BRODY
Why don't you try a taste of this?
Brody unscrews the cap and offers the jar to Mike. Mike eyes
Sheryl. Clearly she doesn't think it's a good idea.
Mike accepts the jar, hesitates, then takes a sip. He
squirms, winces, but forces it down. Mike turns red and
coughs. Brody and Darryl are loving it.
DARRYL
Betcha never tasted nuthin'like that?
Darryl would win that bet.
BRODY
Fifty bucks.
Mike has no idea what he's talking about.
BRODY
I'll sell you the jar for fifty bucks.
DARRYL
(Ogles Sheryl)
Or maybe we could do us a little
trade.
MIKE
Let me get my wallet.
Mike opens a zipper on his backpack, rummages around.
ANGLE ON - INSIDE THE BAG... the .38 Revolver.
25.
Mike thinks about grabbing it.
Sheryl shocked to see the
gun. She tenses up.
ANGLE ON - Brody.
The shotgun.
Mike thinks, then...
SHERYL
Fifty bucks sounds like a bargain.
(To Mike)
Pay the man.
Mike reaches past the gun and grabs his wallet. He counts
out the cash, hands it to Brody. Brody smiles, hands the jar
to Mike.
BRODY
Pleasure doing business with ya.
Take
care now.
Brody nods at Mike and Sheryl, walks off down the trail.
Darryl grins at Sheryl, follows Brody.
LONNIE
Should you tire of your present
company... just holla and I'll come
running with bells on darling.
He smiles a creepy wide smile.
He turns and catches up to
the others.
Once they are out of sight... Mike takes a moment to gather
himself. Sheryl grabs her shirt still on the ground, puts it
on.
MIKE
Are you okay?
SHERYL
You brought a gun?
No response.
Sheryl picks up her towel and bandana.
SHERYL
Why did you bring a gun?
MIKE
Same reason you brought your
cellphone. Better to have it and not
need it. To protect us.
SHERYL
Lotta good it just did.
26.
Sheryl turns from Mike, walks back to the path.
MIKE
(Then, call out)
You want to go back?
(No response)
Sheryl? I'm sorry.
SHERYL
We should have stuck to one of the
patrolled paths.
Sheryl charges ahead, back to the path.
MIKE
(Under his breath)
Fuck.
Mike gets up, grabs his bag and follows Sheryl.

The sun begins to set, basking the mountain range in a

WATERFALL - TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #2 - DAY
28
Mike and Sheryl move right along.
Still not speaking.
The path forks at a BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL. Mike stops, faces
the falls, turns to see... Sheryl behind him, catching up.
As she does, she slips...
MIKE
You alright?
SHERYL
(balances herself)
Yeah.
She's about to walk past him, but he reaches for Sheryl's
hand and holds it.
MIKE
I'm sorry.
SHERYL
Do you know how many times I've had
someone die on me? How many children?
I stopped keeping count.
MIKE
I thought... I wasn't thinking.
What
do you want me to do?
27.
SHERYL
Get rid of the gun.
MIKE
What... now? Out here?
She holds firm.
MIKE
I can't just leave it here in the
woods, some kid could find it.
SHERYL
Then get rid of the bullets now and
when we get home, you get rid of the
gun.
Mike thinks about it.
His instincts SCREAMING not to do
this, then...
SHERYL
Please.
Mike relents. He removes his backpack, ZIPS it open.
He
pulls out the gun, opens it, spills the bullets out.
Mike WITH A DEEP BREATH, TOSSES THE BULLETS into the woods.
SHERYL
Was that all of them?
MIKE
Yes.
Mike steps back to Sheryl, they hug.
SHERYL
Thank you.
CRACK! A strange sound, like wood snapping, startles Sheryl.
Mike turns as well. Their eyes WIDEN.
CRACK! The FIGURE emerges from the clearing, practically
landing on top of them. It's...
CLYDE, a Park Ranger, mid-50's, friendly. He's got a weed
cutter in his hands, wears a PAIR OF WORK GLOVES. He's just
as surprised to see them.
Sheryl and Mike breath a sigh and offer him a smile.
CLYDE
Oh. Didn't mean to startle you folks.
Just clearing some of the brush off

the path. We had some heavy rains
this past week, knocked some trees and
branches down. One of the new
recruits was supposed to do yesterday,
but... if you want something done
right, you gotta do it yourself.
MIKE
It's fine. We were led to believe
this trail wasn't regularly patrolled.
CLYDE
It's not, but... It's one of my
favorite spots, so I often find an
excuse to swing by.
SHERYL
It's gorgeous.
CLYDE
Yup. There are a couple more falls in
the park, but none quite so...
inviting as this one. Now don't take
my word for it, you can see for
yourself... How long's your stay?
SHERYL
Just til Sunday.
CLYDE
Yeah, no. The other falls are clear on
the other side. It would take you a
couple nights just to get there.
SHERYL
Maybe next time.
MIKE
This is a quickie trip. Just getting
out of the city for a couple days.
CLYDE
The city, huh. Which? If it's
Charleston, I wouldn't blame ya.
Whole place smells like feet. I gotta
haul myself all the way down to the
hospital there for my yearly because
the darn HMO's rules and regulations
won't let me visit the local Doc. Not
my cup of tea at all, but if you like
it there, then...
SHERYL
No, we're not from Charleston.

MIKE
But apparently we look like we are.
SHERYL
We live in Alexandria.
It's just

CLYDE
Oh. I've been there, few years back.
Now that city I like. Lotta beautiful
churches if I recall correctly. Which
congregation do y'all belong to?
MIKE
Um... Not sure. Sheryl keeps track of
all that for us. Sheryl?
Sheryl gives Mike the "you're an asshole" look.
Then...
SHERYL
Uh... We're between congregations at
the moment.
Awkward.
CLYDE
Well... I should get back to work.
Sun'll be down soon and that path
ain't gettin'clear on its own.
Clyde walks off, until...
SHERYL
Excuse me... Sir?
Sheryl doesn't know his name.
Clyde stops, turns back.
CLYDE
The name's Clyde.
SHERYL
Clyde, would you recommend a nice spot
nearby to make camp for the night?
CLYDE
Be happy too... Let's see... Oh, I
got it. "Five Corners" will be
perfect. It's just a bit up the ways
here, near the Lake. It's five large
rocks which sit in a clearing with a
view of the whole park. The rocks
retain the heat from the day, so if
you set up camp between them you won't
be so cold.
30.
SHERYL
Sounds perfect.
MIKE
Thanks.
CLYDE
Just doing my job. You have fun and
be careful. Good evening.
Clyde tips his cap and disappears.

FIVE CORNERS - DAY
29
Mike and Sheryl hike up a steep slope.
As they step through
the woods, they look upon...
FIVE LARGE ROCKS, arranged in an awkward semi-circle.
They walk into the circle, take off their backpacks.
SHERYL
This is incredible.
Mike opens the tent pouch, starts removing the many parts.
SHERYL
Ranger said there's a lake near by.
MIKE
What?
SHERYL
The lake.
I'd kill to rinse off.
Sheryl makes a move...
MIKE
Whoa. Wait a sec. It'll be dark soon.
SHERYL
Where's your sense of adventure?
She takes off.
MIKE
Sher. Seriously.
Let's wait `til
morning.
30
OBSCURED POV--
30
On SHERYL as she stops.
Looks out towards the water.
31.
CLOSE ON - THE CONCEALED FIGURE'S EYES. Two different
colors, with his left being void of almost all color. Also
notice SCARRING around the left eye, there's no eyebrow and
his skin is pale and splotchy.
The Concealed Figure holds all his attention on...
31
FIVE CORNERS--
31
Sheryl realizes he's right and walks back over to Mike.
SHERYL
Fine.
Mike stares at the many assorted parts of the tent, the sheet
of instructions laid out. He holds one of the poles, which
consists of separate links connected by a string. He has no
idea where to begin.
SHERYL
Do you know what you are doing?
MIKE
I think its pretty obvious that I
don't.
Sheryl laughs.
32
TREES, OUTSKIRTS OF FIVE CORNERS - CONTINUOUS
32
The Concealed Figure retreats into the forest.
DISSOLVE TO:
33
FIVE CORNERS - NIGHT
33
STARS FILL THE SKY. Crickets chirp, but aside from that,
peace and quiet reign.
A fire CRACKLES. A tent for two has been pitched. Dirty
pots, pans litter the area. Dinner's over and done.
Mike and Sheryl cuddle by the fire.
A sleeping bag wrapped
around them.
MIKE
That was... the worst dinner ever.
SHERYL
(Beat)
You cooked.
32.
MIKE
Yeah, I'm aware.
(Beat)
You know what would make this evening
perfect? Moonshine. I got a whole
jar of it. There's a sentence I never
thought I'd say. "I have a jar of
moonshine." Matter of fact, I've got
enough to share with our entire
congregation...
SHERYL
... in Charleston.
MIKE
Our home city, of course. But I
should start with you... Would you
like some moonshine?
Sheryl smiles, shakes her head playfully.
MIKE
Then what would you like?
SHERYL
I'd like to fuck you.
MIKE
Not very Christian of you.
SHERYL
I'm more Old Testament.
MIKE
What's that mean?
SHERYL
Not sure. But I think it's the
nastier of the two books.
Sheryl pulls Mike into her, they kiss. Strong and deep.
Sheryl abruptly breaks the kiss, enough foreplay. She stands
up, pulls Mike into the tent with her.
34
TENT - FIVE CORNERS - NIGHT
35
Inside the tent, Mike and Sheryl continue.
Their campfire
still burns. Suddenly...
A SHADOW creeps into frame.
Then a BOOT.
Someone's outside
their tent.
36
TENT - NIGHT
36 A
The last FLAMES on the fire slowly BURN OUT.
36 B
TENT - FIVE CORNERS - NIGHT
37
Mike, now fully dressed, pours a bucket of water over the
campfire. In the background, bags hang from a tree (just as
Ranger Sam asked them to do.)
35.
A smoldering mist of smoke is all that's left of the fire.
Mike drops the bucket, heads for the tent, when... He
suddenly stops, notices...
FIVE CORNERS - SUNRISE
38
The sun peeks over the horizon and through the clouds.
A
BIRD crows.
39
TENT - FIVE CORNERS - DAY
40
Sheryl, now dressed, towel in hand, bandana wrapped around
her hair, vomits behind some trees.
After, she takes a couple deep breaths, swishes some water in
her mouth. A beat later, she heads off.
41
LAKE - DAY
41
Sheryl stands on the lake's shore, checks a couple times over
both shoulders. Then, she takes her sweats and bandana off.
Lay them on top of her towel.
Sheryl, wearing only her locket, carefully steps into the
water... it's cold. But nevertheless her desire to feel
clean outweighs the temperature discomfort.
On her own little count to three... She dunks her head below
the water. As she drops out of sight, REVEAL--
ON LAND, IN THE DISTANCE... THE CONCEALED FIGURE STANDS ON
THE SHORE, WATCHES HER.
IN THE WATER... Sheryl POPS up, turns towards land and... THE
CONCEALED FIGURE is gone.
Sheryl comes back to land.
She grabs her towel, dries her
hair and pats herself dry.
She pulls on her sweatpants,
36.
starts to tie her bandana around her head, and turns straight
into... THE CONCEALED FIGURE.
CLOSE ON - THE STEEL SICKLE/ AXE
SHERYL SCREAMS.
The sound resonates over...
42
TENT - FIVE CORNERS - DAY
43
Mike, now dressed, stands behind a tree, takes a piss.
He
shudders slightly. It's cold.
Mike finishes his business, grabs his water bottle and takes
a long drink. He peels off the bandage from his hand. It
looks fine today.
He looks around, but no sign of Sheryl.
44
LAKE - DAY
44
Mike walks up to the water, looks in both directions.
Nothing. A pang of concern registers.
He kneels down, cups some water and splashes it over his
face, hair. As he opens his eyes, he notices something.
In the wash of the waves, sparkling in the sunlight. It's
Sheryl's locket. The chain broken. He picks it up...
MIKE
(Calls out)
Sheryl!
Mike looks around. He's completely alone.
The blood drains
from his face. Mike pockets the necklace.
He starts into the water... did she drown?
Just as he gets
knee deep...
OFF SCREEN: A SCREAM CRIES OUT!
Mike stops, turns back looking at the forest.
MIKE
Sheryl!
He hustles out of the water, heading for the woods.
37.
45
WOODS NEAR STREAM - DAY
45
Mike hustles through the thick patch of trees and hits the
steep little slope. He flies up the slope but loses traction
and slips, BANGING his knee.
MIKE
Fuck!
(Top of his lungs)
Sheryl!
Mike pushes himself up, continues on.
46
WOODS NEAR STREAM #2 - DAY
46
Mike's really moving now. He scoots through the first patch
of trees and hustles down a slope.
47
CLEARING, TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY
47
Mike emerges from the woods, drops into a clearing.
Looking
around wildly...
POV OF MIKE - Has he been here before? It all looks the
same? Not even sure which direction he just came from.
MIKE
Sheryl!
Still nothing.
Mike swallows.
What to do now?
SMASH CUT TO:
48
WOODS #1 - OFF TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY
48
TIGHT ON MIKE as he races through the trees.
HIS LEGS
trample over rocks, dirt, shrubs. Then...
Mike TRIPS, falls down HARD. He lifts his forearm to reveal
BLOOD, SCRAPES and a LONG SHARP SPLINTER sticking out.
The sight of it almost makes Mike puke right then and there.
Mike grabs hold of the splinter, turns his head... takes
about a thousand short quick breaths and... PULLS THE
SPLINTER OUT! BLOOD SQUIRTS ACROSS HIS FACE.
He removes the GRAY BANDANA from his back pocket, wraps it
around his wound.
Mike lays back, stares up into the sky.
Tries to catch his
breath, calm down. Then...
Faint sound of LAUGHTER.
38.
Mike sits up.
Again, faint sound of LAUGHTER.
Mike stands, takes a couple of steps toward the sound. MORE
LAUGHTER. Mike's got the scent, takes off in its direction.
49
WOODS #2, OFF TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY
49
Mike follows the VOICES through a thick patch of trees.
He
stops at the top and looks down.
POV OF MIKE - Walking along the main path, obscured by the
trees, is Darryl and Lonnie. They drink, LAUGH about
something. Lonnie carries some fishing poles.
Mike's about fifteen feet above them.
He narrows his focus
in on...
MIKE'S POV - Darryl twirling something in his hand.
It's
Sheryl's blue hikers' towel.
Mike turns red with fury.
He looks back down...
MIKE'S POV - Darryl, a SHOTGUN slung around his shoulder.
Mike looks around and spots a large pointed stick lying near
a tree, parallel to him.
50
TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #4 - DAY
50
Darryl and Lonnie continue along, until...
OFF SCREEN: A LOUD CRACK.
Darryl stops, turns.
Lonnie looks at Daryl.
LONNIE
What is it? Hear something?
Darryl holds his look into the woods, then...
DARRYL
Nah.
It's nothing.
Suddenly, Mike LEAPS from behind a tree, WHACKS the surprised
Darryl across the face with the stick. Darryl drops like a
sack of potatoes.
Mike locks eyes with a terrified Lonnie.
MIKE
Where is she!?
Lonnie pauses, frozen.
He then takes off, disappearing
through the trees.
39.
Darryl lies on the ground, MOANING. He pushes himself up to
his knees. BLOOD POURS from a fresh gash across his head.
Mike grabs Darryl's shotgun, aims at Darryl.
DARRYL
Whoa... take it easy.
MIKE
Where is she?
DARRYL
Who?
What the fuck you talking about?
MIKE
What did you do to her?
DARRYL
I didn't fuckin' do nothing.
MIKE
WHERE IS SHE?!
DARRYL
I don't know!
Mike CRACKS Darryl across THE JAW with the barrel.
MIKE
You have Sheryl's towel...What the
fuck did you do to her?!
Darryl's a mess, his nose busted. He gags on blood and
teeth. Mike stares at the bloody desight that is Darryl.
Even Mike has to turn away for a moment for this. Then...
DARRYL
Foun' towel.
MIKE
What?
DARRYL
I foun' the towel.
MIKE
You found it? That's you're fucking
story, you inbred fuck?!
(Points gun at Darryl's head)
Stop fucking lying or I will kill you!
40.
DARRYL
Don' kill me...Please...I foun' it...
Up...Up the paf back `dere...just a
bit ago... fuckin'swear!
Mike's finger itches the trigger. He's turning red.
Breathing hard, heavy. Then... Mike relents. Lowers the
weapon, turns his back to Darryl, stares into the woods.
The tension fades for the moment.
But only a moment.
DARRYL
Didn't think you had dat in you, city
boy.
(Looks at his shirt; the blood)
Shit... I just got dis shirt.
Darryl, while Mike is distracted, seizes his opportunity,
reaches behind...
ANGLE ON - Darryl slides a POCKET KNIFE from his back pocket.
DARRYL
Damn shame you lost dat fine piece
o'ass. Something dat sweet don't
come'round every day. Even for pretty
folk like you.
MIKE
Shut the fuck up.
ANGLE ON - Still concealed from Mike, Darryl opens the pocket
knife, the BLADE fully extended.
DARRYL
You best hope you find her'fore I do.
`cause I will enjoy tearing her ass
apart.
(Mike turns, faces Darryl)
And when I'm done there, I will cut
her eyeballs out and skull fuck her.
(Mike simmers to a boil)
Any luck, Brody's already beat me to
it.
MIKE
Sonofabitch!
Mike takes a step towards Darryl, when... Darryl LUNGES OUT
AT MIKE, POCKET KNIFE IN HAND.
Darryl misses with his initial swipe, but it's enough to
knock Mike down, the shotgun falls to the side.
41.
Darryl pins Mike to the ground, tries to dagger the knife
into him, but Mike grabs his wrist. They struggle. Darryl
PUSHES down, the knife INCHES CLOSER TO MIKE'S CHEST,
until...
Mike HEAD-BUTTS Darryl, sending the skinny Hick off him.
Darryl rolls away in pain.
Mike scrambles, crawls for... the shotgun.
He grabs it.
Darryl regroups, turns around, but is met with...
WHACK! MIKE bashes Darryl's face with the butt.
This knocks
Darryl completely out.
Mike stands over Darryl.
A beat.
Then...
MIKE
SHERYL!

MOUNTAINS - DAY (2ND UNIT)
51
The morning fog has dissipated as streaks of sunlight pierce
the cloudy skies.
52
FIVE CORNERS - DAY
52
Mike arrives back at their campsite, shotgun in tow.
He
freezes, completely floored.
Everything is gone. The tent, the backpacks, the mess kits,
everything. Even the fire pit.
Mike looks around, turning, looking...completely helpless.
He SNAPS open the shotgun - he's got two shells.
He closes
it, heads back into the woods.
53
OMIT

54
WOODS #3, TIMBER FALLS TRAILS - DAY
54
Mike moves deeper into the woods.
He's a mix of paranoia and
determination.
Mike pauses, catching his breath, when... A FEW BLOOD DROPS
OF BLOOD LAND ON HIS FACE. Mike wipes his face, looks at the
blood. What the fuck?
A couple more DROPS hit him.
Mike LOOKS UP...
A MANGLED, MUTILATED DEER HANGS IN THE TREES, secured by
coarse thick ropes.
42.
Mike takes a terrified step backwards, unaware...
A FEW FEET
BEHIND HIM LAYS A RUSTED, STEEL BEAR TRAP.
Mike, still mesmerized by the blood and the deer, continues
backing up... getting closer to the bear trap... closer...
his foot HOVERS OVER THE CENTER OF THE TRAP...
SNAP! CRUNCH!
MIKE STEPS IN THE TRAP, THE JAWS CHOMP DOWN
ON HIS LEG!
Mike SCREAMS IN AGONY! He drops to the ground, stares at his
leg, now a bloody mess of flesh and steel.
MIKE
HELP!?!?!
Mike writhes in pain on the ground.
His eyes watering.
The
pain UNBEARABLE. Then...
MIKE'S POV - Someone or thing appears, stepping from the
forest. They come closer. THE SUN BLASTS DIRECTLY BEHIND
The FIGURE keeping their identity hidden.
Mike's eyelids flutter, can't determine who/what it is. The
pain overwhelms him. He doesn't care any longer. Then...
Ida bends down next to Mike.
IDA
Michael, can you hear me?
Michael...
Her words fade out.
He promptly PASSES OUT.
CUT TO BLACK.
ON BLACK: A SHRIEKING WHISTLE SOUNDS.
FADE IN:
55
TENT - FIVE CORNERS - LAST NIGHT
56
Inside the tent, Mike and Sheryl make love.
Their campfire
still burns. Suddenly...
A SHADOW creeps into frame.
Then a BOOT.
REVEAL: IDA STANDS OUTSIDE THE TENT.
BACK TO:
57
IDA'S CABIN - DAY
67
Sheryl BURSTS through the front door, running for the woods.
Deacon exits the cabin, spots Sheryl.
Runs after her.
68
WOODS #4 - TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY
68
SHERYL runs as fast as she can. Breaking branches in her
way, leaping rocks. Anything to get away from...
DEACON follows. This is his terrain, turf.
He moves quickly
and efficiently through the brush.
56.
SHERYL looks back, and as she does... trips over some tree
roots. She falls FACE FIRST INTO A GIANT PUDDLE. She pushes
herself out of the puddle. She's soaked, but doesn't stop.
She resumes running.
DEACON... closing the gap.
SHERYL, confused, scared and lost, looks around wildly.
Has
no idea where she's going. Then suddenly she hears
something. She looks down a slight hill...
SHERYL'S POV - A RANGER TRUCK drives along a gravel road.
SHERYL
Thank you God...
(At the top of her lungs)
HELP!
Sheryl darts down the hill, and falls out onto...
69
I/E
RANGER TRUCK/ GRAVEL MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY
69
The RANGER TRUCK SLAMS on the brakes, inches from running
over Sheryl. She SLAMS her arms down on the hood.
Clyde, startled beyond belief, looks out at Sheryl. He gets
out of the car, goes to her. She HUGS Clyde tightly, starts
crying. He looks at her... the blood, cuts, etc.
CLYDE
Oh my stars, what happened to you?
SHERYL
(Out of breath)
You have to help me. I was kidnapped.
My boyfriend came... And this man's
chasing me. He's chasing me right
now.
CLYDE
Calm down. I can't make heads or
tails of what you're saying.
SHERYL
He's coming. He's right behind me.
Clyde looks up into the woods from where Sheryl came, but...
all's peaceful at the moment. No Deacon.
CLYDE
Look, miss, there's no one there.
SHERYL
Oh my God, Mike.
57.
ANGLE FROM DOWN THE PATH - Clyde, his back to us, consoles
Sheryl. Deacon steps into frame. Sickle/Axe in hand. He
starts toward Clyde and Sheryl.
CLYDE
It's going to be fine, Miss. I
promise you. Everything's going to be
fine.
Sheryl pries her face from Clyde's chest.
SHERYL'S POV - Deacon's five feet behind Clyde and closing.
SHERYL SCREAMS.
CLYDE HOLDS ONTO SHERYL.
Off her look, Clyde turns... DEACON AND CLYDE STAND FACE TO
FACE. The moment's frozen. For too long.
Something's not right.
CLYDE
Deacon, what's going on?
How the heck
did she escape?
Sheryl looks at Clyde, in shock.
Deacon lowers his head,
ashamed.
CLYDE
Want something done, gotta do it
yourself.
Clyde removes a black, wooden club from his belt... Sheryl
turns, about to run, when... CLYDE CRACKS HER ACROSS THE
BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE CLUB.
CUT TO BLACK.

SWAMP - DAY
93
The SUN burns overhead.
Clyde stands on the banks of a algae covered swamp.
He
stares out, nervously watching.
Brody, in his beat-up Pick-up truck, pulls to a stop.
Exits
the truck, approaches Clyde.
BRODY
Clyde!
CLYDE
G'morning, Brody.
BRODY
I stopped by your place the other day.
CLYDE
Ida mentioned.
BRODY
So have you seen or heard anything
about that man hiker?
CLYDE
(Beat)
In fact I have. I saw him and his
lady leave.
BRODY
When was this?
74.
CLYDE
Yesterday.
Just before dusk.
BRODY
Bullshit.
CLYDE
Believe what you want.
Clyde looks out at the swamp, then back to Brody, who never
stopped staring at Clyde.
BRODY
I saw their car last night in the
parking lot at base. So they didn't
leave, "Just before dusk."
CLYDE
Well, I was down at base this
morning... car's gone now.
BRODY
Something don't feel right here,
Clyde. Between you and Ida...
CLYDE
I don't have time for this...
He starts to walk away, but Brody grabs his wrist tightly.
CLYDE
Take your hand off me, Brody.
BRODY
What do you know about that hiker you
ain't telling me?
Brody waits a beat, then lets him go.
CLYDE
I told you, Brody...
I saw them
leave. Let it go.
Brody watches Clyde head off. He's even more paranoid now
than before. What Brody doesn't notice...
ANGLE ON THE SWAMP... Just below the water, sinking, the
outline of the back of the Passat.

Brody washes out some mason jars. His shotgun rests against
a nearby tree. Lonnie smokes pot from his handmade pipe.
A walkie-talkie CRACKLES.
Evelyn approaches.
BRODY
Shit.
Get rid of the dope.
Brody hides the jars in his satchel.
Lonnie quickly tucks
his pipe away, fans the smoke away.
EVELYN
Morning, gentlemen.
(She eyes her watch)
Pardon me... Afternoon.
LONNIE
Evelyn, damn, hurts looking at you.
When you gonna give it up to me?
EVELYN
Now with a line like that, it's a
shocker I haven't already.
LONNIE
You stone cold tease.
EVELYN
Was wondering if either of you had
seen any hikers pass by in the last
day or so?
Lonnie's about to respond, but Brody cuts him off...
BRODY
What's this about?
Evelyn hands them a flier.
ON THE FLIER - Photos of Mike and Sheryl, name, info, etc.
Brody's eyes light up.
BRODY
These two are missing?
EVELYN
It would seem so.
Why, have you seen
them?
Brody hesitates and then shakes his head "no".
81.
BRODY
You talk to Clyde about this?
EVELYN
All the Rangers are on the lookout.
Family's even offering up a reward.
BRODY
(Beat)
How much?
EVELYN
Pardon?
BRODY
How much they offering?
EVELYN
Don't exactly know.
I'm guessing it's
a fair amount.
BRODY
Well, me and Lonnie will keep a
lookout for you too. Anything we can
do to help.
Evelyn begins walking off.
LONNIE
You change you mind, I'll ride you
raw.
Evelyn ignores Lonnie, moves on her way.
LONNIE
It'd be the best fifteen seconds of
your life, darling!
Brody watches her go.
As she disappears, he grabs his gun.

No. You promised. You promised, this

Ida flips open a silver lighter, SPARKS up a flame. She

A FIRE ROARS TO LIFE.
CLYDE

A giant pile of dirt. The dead body of Brody sits inside the
makeshift grave. Ida pushes Lonnie's carcass in next.
Clyde watches Ida, concern in his eyes.
CLYDE
Ida...
you know what we have to do?
IDA
(Already anticipating)
No. I can give her an abortion. Get
rid of the bastard child, make them
conceive one in wedlock. And then we
are right as rain.
CLYDE
Abortion?
No. That we won't do.
IDA
It'll work. Ain't no sin to abort a
demon.
CLYDE
Ida, writings on the wall here.
Michael's right. With a reward on the
table, do you think Brody and Lonnie
will be the only two coming? Gonna
have lots people looking for these
two.
(Beat)
We're gonna have to make it so no one
can ever find them.
IDA
No.
Ida and Clyde.
A sadness covers their faces, especially Ida.
CLYDE
We'll find another couple, Ida.
IDA
No. You promised me, Clyde, this time
was the one.
CLYDE
It's too dangerous. We'll find
another couple. A better one.
IDA

It's not fair.

Clyde nods.
They hug.
A CRACKLE OF LIGHTNING followed by a ROLL OF THUNDER.

SHERYL (O.S.)
Hey!
Deacon turns, looks up...
ON THE PORCH ROOF...
Sheryl, a fresh tear in her dress, holds the SILVER LIGHTER
in one hand, the moonshine jar in the other. The Moonshine
jar has a torn length of her dress sticking out, a homemade
Molotov Cocktail. She glares down at Deacon, lights the
cocktail...
SHERYL
Burn in hell you sonofabitch!
She drops it...
THE COCKTAIL HITS. THE FLAMES CONSUME DEACON, SPREAD QUICKLY
OVER HIS ENTIRE BODY.
Deacon flails wildly, trying to put out the flames, stumbles
forward, runs off towards the forest. He trips and falls
just as he enters.
SHERYL... the rain pouring down, stares at...
ANGLE ON - DEACON'S BURNING CORPSE lays in the thick brush.

IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT
151
The RAIN has STOPPED. A couple of RANGERS along with a
PARAMEDIC UNIT surround the scene.
SHERYL... sits, completely still, a PARAMEDIC works on her
cuts and hand. She watches as...
THE OTHER PARAMEDICS load a gurney into the back of the
Ambulance. A sheet covers the body. Mike's body. Once
inside, the Ambulance's doors close.
Sheryl watches the Ambulance pull away. She places her hand
on her stomach. It's just the two of them now.
EVELYN... steps from the midst of the activity, up to Sheryl.
She leads her away from the ambulance, towards the Ranger
truck.
EVELYN
Called your folks. There gunna meet
us at the hospital. Be a while since
they're coming in from D.C.
The words go straight through Sheryl.
No reaction.
101.
EVELYN
Sorry, but I just have to ask... You
told the Sheriff there was someone in
on this whole thing with Clyde and
Ida. Big fella, scars all over him?
(No response)
Mame?
Sheryl's eyes meet Evelyn's. She nods about to continue on,
until she notices Evelyn's demeanor.
SHERYL
Why?
What is it?
EVELYN
(Changing topics)
You've had an exhausting night, why
don't you...
SHERYL
(Hard, cold)
What is it?
EVELYN
We didn't find anybody like that in
the yard or the house.
SHERYL
(Concern growing)
No. It's not possible.
She turns, looks around, but spies nothing...
EVELYN
Calm down.
It's gunna be alright...
SHERYL
Fuck you it's gonna be alright.
Sheryl turns to the woods, holds her look.
As if she
knows...

WOODS NEAR THE CABIN - NIGHT
152
In the distance... past the trees, deep into the woods.
COME TO A REST OVER THE SHOULDER OF DEACON. Very much alive.
He stares at the cabin for a beat, then CROSSES out of frame.
CUT TO BLACK.
FADE OUT.
