    BALTAR sits in a chair, gazing out at the water and the 
    morning light from the serene comfort of his living room, a 
  cup of coffee on the side table next to him, CLASSICAL MUSIC 
    playing softly in the b.g.  We might notice that the sky is 
    just a little brighter than it should be, the colors in the 
    house a little more vibrant.  In fact, all of his 
    surroundings seem a little too sharp, too crisp to the eye.  

    NUMBER SIX lounges on a chaise nearby, watching him.

                                NUMBER SIX
                  God has a plan for you, Gaius.  He 
                  has a plan for everything and 
                  everyone.

    Baltar never takes his eyes off the view.

                                LEE (PRELAP)
                  All Vipers -- hold position.  


  Lee sits in his cockpit, looking tense and worn.  

                                LEE
                  Twenty seconds to mark.

    He s watching a DIGITAL CLOCK counting down the seconds:  
    19... 18... 17...


  Six watches Baltar.  Once again, we re struck by the visual 
    keys of Baltar s House -- something about this environment is 
  not quite right, not quite real.

                  me?


    ADAMA is staring at a CLOCK hanging on a bulkhead.  The 
    SECOND HAND is sweeping up toward the hour.  TIGH, GAETA, 
    DUALLA at their stations.  Everyone watching clocks (digital 
    & analog) or their watches.  The mood is tense.  Dualla 
    operates her console by rote, her face a mask of exhaustion.

                  Maybe this time...

    Adama never takes his eyes from the clock:  10...9...8...  


    Baltar now standing at the window, calmly sipping his tea.

                  I believe in the beauty of a well

                  problems solved through rational 
                  means.  Not some large invisible

                  flights of birds and the lives of 
                  men.  A rational universe.

    LAURA sitting in what has now been transformed into a crude 
    Oval Office.  BILLY is on the phone and various AIDES are in 
    their seats.  Like on Galactica, everyone here is exhausted, 
    stressed, and watching a digital clock counting down the 
    seconds:  7... 6... 5...

  She tries to put on a confident smile for them.


  Six sidles up to Baltar, slips an arm around his waist, 
    nuzzles his neck.

                                NUMBER SIX
                  I love you.  That s not rational.

    Baltar has Six on the chaise and begins to make love to her.  
  She pulls back, looks at him with regret.

    Baltar is sitting in a chair at the rear of the cabin.

                                PILOT (P.A.)
                  I m afraid the Cylons have appeared 
                  again.  However, our FTL drive is 
                  now working and we will Jump 
                  momentarily.

    Baltar rubs his face with his hands.  Unlike the way he 
    looked in his house, here Baltar looks like hell; a man right 
  on the edge of his ability to take the stress and pressure 
  and fatigue.

    Number Six leans into frame.  We begin to realize that she is 
  the one constant in his mind -- a phantom that slides easily 
    back and forth between the calm sedate world of the house he 
    used to live in and the chaotic world of life in the rag-tag 
    fleet.


  The dradis console shows enemy blips and ALARMS are going off 
    around the ship.  There s just the slightest pause of 
    resignation as everyone realizes that it s happened again.  
    Tigh s exhaustion and disappointment is palpable -- Adama is 
    just as tired as everyone else, but his mind is already 
    moving on and he goes to Tigh with an encouraging tone:

                                ADAMA
                      (to Tigh)
                  Not this time -- but maybe the 
                  next.  I ve got an idea for the 
                  next cycle...

  The CIC becomes a beehive of activity once again.  PILOT 
    CHATTER coming in, officers and enlisted scurrying about.  
    Tigh watches his crew perform their tasks -- his temper is 
    short, not tolerant of mistakes in this situation.  He 
    quickly spots an error on one of the consoles, taps the 
    display over the shoulder of the unfortunate Lieutenant.

                                TIGH
                  Watch the ammo hoists for the main

  -- and Baltar is sitting in his chair, letting out that same 
    long sigh.  The transition between the reality of Colonial 
  One and the hyper-real environment of the house is abrupt, 
  but Baltar is unfazed.  He s calm here, at ease with himself

    FADE IN:


    PILOTS are scurrying in and out of the washroom, some 
    throwing water on their faces, others making a quick dash in 
  and out of the toilet stalls -- everyone looking frayed and 
    burnt out.

    Kara Thrace has her head completely under a faucet, drowning 
  her hair and face in the water, her flight suit peeled down 
  to her waist.  Lee Adama steps in through the hatch, still in 
  his flight suit.

  The pilots pick up the pace, start zipping flight suits and 
    stumbling out the door.  Lee takes a spot at a sink near 
  Kara, pulls a toothbrush from a zippered pocket, wets it, 
    begins to savagely brush his teeth -- more rote than hygiene.  
  Kara roughly towels off, pulls up her flight suit.

    Adama is in the head, SHAVING and talking to Tigh, who s 
    scribbling notes on a piece of paper and scarfing down a few 
    bites of Adama s untouched food in between sentences.

    Adama CUTS himself with the razor -- BLOOD trickles down his 
    throat for a moment.

                                TIGH
                  Right...?

    Adama looks on the blood on his neck for a moment, sleep 
    deprivation and fatigue causing him to lose focus for a 
    moment.

                                ADAMA
                  Then Jump two more times... fourth 
                  Jump, everyone rendezvous back at a

    Adama grabs his jacket and comes out of the head, sees Tigh 
    eating his food.

    Adama heads for the door, Tigh right with him.   They EXIT to 
  the Corridor.

    CLOSE ON WRISTWATCH

    Ticking away.  REVEAL:


  The watch is on the wrist of Dualla and she s standing in a 
    LONG LINE of Deck Hands who are waiting outside the tiny OFF-
    SHIP COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE.  The Corridor itself is filled 
  with BOXES, mislaid items, stray pieces of paper -- no one s 
  had a chance or energy to police the spaces in days.

    SOCINUS and a couple of deckhands man the Comm Office, now 
    crammed with sheets of paper, photos and lists.  The deck 
  hands are working the phones inside the office, while the 
  Petty Officer mans the door.  

  The man ahead of Dualla leaves and now she s at the head of 
  the line.  She hands Socinus a piece of paper with names and 
    descriptions scrawled in neat lines.  He quickly goes over 
  the list.

                                SOCINUS

    Dualla brings out a STACK of SNAPSHOTS -- faces of her family 
  and friends.

                  We can t transmit photos yet, so 
                  you can either leave them with us 
                  or put em on the Board.  

    Dualla eyes the stacks and piles of photos and lists filling 
  the office and decides to keep them.

                  there.

    Kara reacts to that last line --  Be careful out there?   The 
    pilots gather up their plotting boards and head for the 
    hatch.  As they pass out the door, each of them TOUCHES a 
    PHOTO taped to the wall --

    CLOSE ON PHOTO

    Which shows a COLONIAL SOLDIER with his back to the camera, 
    standing on a ROOFTOP, looking out over a CITY.  Dark clouds 
  of SMOKE rise up from the city.  A Colonial FLAG ripples in 
  the breeze above his head.

    Each pilot s hand comes into frame and touches the image, as 
    they go out the door and to war.


    A long, impromptu memorial board now covers the walls of a 
    section of Corridor.  It s plastered with PHOTOS, 
    descriptions of loved ones, small drawings, tributes, etc.  
    Galactica CREWMEMBERS are gathered here putting up photos, 
    touching the faces of missing loved ones, praying, or just 
    staring at the faces. 

    It s the sheer number of the faces that hits Dualla in the 
    chest.  It takes her a beat before she gathers herself and 
    moves to find a spot to put her photos among the many...

    Sharon doesn t react to the idea of the Cylons looking human.

  her attitude toward Crashdown.

    Crashdown EXITS the cabin.  Sharon keeps working as Tyrol 
    leans over her shoulder, pretends to be interested in 
    something on the control panel.

    Sharon struggles to focus on her job.


    Laura is at her desk, which has become the center of gravity 
  in the makeshift Oval Office.  Billy goes to her with a stack 
  of message slips and a PACKAGE.  Several other AIDES are also 
  in the cabin and there s a continuous flow of PEOPLE in and 
  out -- this is a busy workspace.

    Laura takes it, reacts in disappointment.

                  wounds, a few missing during the 
                  last attack.

    Laura goes to a small piece of BOARD that s been roughly 
    mounted on one bulkhead.   The board has a number on it:  
    50,298.  She rubs off the last few digits and corrects it 
    with a GREASE PENCIL to 49,978.  She looks at the number for 
    a long beat, then tries to refocus on something else.

    PHOTO we saw in the Pilots  Ready Room earlier.  Below the 
    photo is a small inscription:   Lest We Forget  

    Laura stares at the photo of the anonymous soldier, the smoke 
  and the flag as silence falls in the cabin.

                  Comm traffic -- two from the 
                  President.

    They ve arrived outside Adama s quarters.  He glances at his 
    watch.

                                ADAMA

  Adama turns down one Corridor and Tigh and Dualla head down 
    another Corridor.

                                DUALLA
                  I believe this was your turn, sir.

    Kara is doing a preflight walk-around of her Viper, looking 
  up under the undercarriage, checking inside the turbines, 
    etc. while Lee looks on.  They re both mentally and

    front of them.

    Kara turns on Lee.

                                KARA
                  Why are we arguing about this?

                                LEE

                  idiot pilots is acting like a child 
                  and refusing to get her shot.  So 
                  she either says  Yes, sir  and 
                  obeys the order or you smack her in

                  ass down to Sickbay and get the 
                  frakking pills.

  Lee just stares at her for a minute, then he feels a slight 
    grin form on his face.

    Adama is asleep in his rack -- then the sound-powered PHONE 
    WHISTLES.  He picks it up by long-honed instinct.

    There s a few beats of electronic clicking, and Adama nearly

                  Yes, Madame President.

    A PHONE has been jerry-rigged near one of the windows, and 
    Laura is on the phone, while Billy and several others look 
  on.

    Laura s eyes go to the grease pencil number on the bulkhead:  
    49,317.  The soldier PHOTO is also now hanging on the 
    bulkhead directly above that number.

                  mandates increasing our numbers.  
                  That takes priority over anyone s

    Laura is stung by his tone and the statement itself, but she 
    bites back a tart response.

                                LAURA 
                  Okay.  Next crisis?

                                BILLY
                  Want to go over your list of calls?

                                LAURA
                  Yes.  But first -- why isn t that 
                  Doctor on board yet?

                                BILLY
                  Doctor Amarak?  Oh... 
                        (checks paperwork)
                  He was on the Olympic carrier.  '33' Fully Collated - 6/22/04    30.




    Baltar sits up in his chair, puzzled and disturbed.  Number 
  Six walks by him.

                                NUMBER SIX
                  God is watching over you, Gauis.  

    Baltar is thrown, rattled by the strange coincidence.  

                                BALTAR
                  The universe is a vast and complex 
                  system.  Coincidental and 
                  serendipitous events are bound to 
                  occur, indeed they are to be 
                  expected.

                                NUMBER SIX
                  Doctor Amarak posed a threat to 
                  you.  Now he s gone.  Logic says 
                  there s a connection.

                                BALTAR
                  A connection, maybe.  But not God.  
                  There is no God or gods -- singular 
                  or plural.  No invisible men or 
                  women taking a personal interest in 
                  the fortunes of Gaius Baltar.  

                                NUMBER SIX
                  Be careful.  That which God gives, 
                  he can also take away.

    Baltar reaches out a hand, grabs the hem of her outfit.

                                BALTAR
                  We have another half hour -- shall 
                  we?

                                NUMBER SIX
                  Not this time, Gaius.  This time s 
                  going to be different.

                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:  '33' Fully Collated - 6/22/04    31.




    Tyrol and his deck hands are watching the clock.


    Laura, her aides, Billy and Baltar waiting in the b.g.


    Everyone watching the clock as the second hand sweeps toward 
  the hour mark:  5... 4... 

                                TIGH
                  Maybe this time...

    3... 2... 1....zero.

  And nothing happens.

    A long, quiet beat passes.  People exchange looks.

                                ADAMA
                  Dradis?

                                GAETA

    Adama watches the clock as the hand keeps sweeping around.

                        (sotto)

    Later.  The clock now shows that 45 minutes have passed.  
    Adama is pacing, thinking.

    Moments later, Laura is on the phone with Adama.

                                LAURA
                  Why this time -- something you did?

                                                                        INTERCUT:


    Adama on the phone with Laura.

                                ADAMA
                  No.  We ve been working on a new 
                  plan, but didn t have time to 
                  implement it yet.

                                LAURA
                  We lost a ship last Jump -- the 
                  Olympic Carrier.  Could that have 
                  something to do with it?

                                ADAMA
                  Possibly...

    A long beat on both ends of the phone as each of them tries 
  to think straight, but fatigue is making them feel like 
    they re both wading through rivers of mud.

                                LAURA 
                  You there?

                                ADAMA
                  Yeah, I m here.

                                LAURA
                  I can t believe this is really 
                  over.  

                                ADAMA
                  No.  Can t let our guard down yet.

                                LAURA
                  So what do we do?  I ve got people 
                  on the verge of collapse over here.

    Adama glances around the strained, exhausted faces in CIC.

                  We ll go to Condition Two.  

  He catches Tigh s eye as he says it, and Tigh nods agreement.

                                ADAMA (cont d)
                  Each ship keeps the first watch on 
                  alert.  Other watches go below, get 
                  some rest.  Two hours later, second 
                  watch relieves first watch and so 
                  on.  Every ship has to be prepared 
                  to Jump immediately if the Cylons 
                  do show up -- but we take advantage 
                  of the time and let people get some 
                  rest.

                                LAURA
                  Okay.  And how long do we stay at 
                  Condition Two?

                                ADAMA
                  Until I m satisfied they re not 
                  coming.

    Beat.

                                ADAMA (cont d)
                  It s a military decision.

                                LAURA
                  I know.  You re right.  It is and I 
                  defer to your judgement.  And 
                  please thank your people for me.  
                  Let them know how much I appreciate 
                  everything they re doing.

    Adama is caught a little off-stride.

                                ADAMA
                  I will.  And thank you... Madame

    That s it, then Lee looks out at the fighters and Raptors of 
  his squadron, knows there are weary pilots in all of them.

                  job.  Besides, gotta make the Old 
                  Man look good.

                                ADAMA
                  I always look good.  Seriously -- 
                  One thing to push a crew, another 
                  to break them.   

    Suddenly there s an ALARM from the dradis console.

                  Dradis contact.  One ship.  Bearing 
                  398 carom 120... getting a 
                  recognition signal... it s the

    Relief floods through CIC -- except Adama isn t relieved.  He 
    stares at the blip on the dradis console for a long beat.

    Everyone scrambles as the ship goes to Action Stations.

                  I want all Vipers manned and ready,

                                    ACT FOUR

    FADE IN:


    Baltar is pacing, agitated.  No refuge from the pressure for 
  him even in this refuge in his mind. 

                                BALTAR
                  How can this be?  If they were left 
                  behind, why didn t the Cylons 
                  destroy them?  And why are they 
                  showing up now?

                                NUMBER SIX
                  It s God s punishment for your lack 
                of faith.

                                BALTAR
                  A more logical and useful 
                  explanation please.

                                NUMBER SIX
                  All right.  The Olympic Carrier has 
                  been infiltrated by Cylon agents.  
                  They ve been tracking the ship all 
                  along.

    Baltar reacts in surprise, but it makes sense.

                                BALTAR
                  Then that means...

                                NUMBER SIX
                  Logically, in order for you to 
                  survive, the Olympic Carrier should 
                  be destroyed.

                  Raptor 478, this is Olympic 
                  Carrier.  We have you in visual 
                  contact.  


  The ship is at Condition One -- every post manned and ready.  
    Everyone is listening to the distant wireless transmissions.

                  Roger that, Olympic Carrier.  Can

    Everyone listening to the wireless transmissions on the 
    speaker phone.

                                SHARON (WIRELESS)
                  Olympic Carrier/Boomer.  I ve been 
                  directed to ask how you escaped 
                  from the Cylons. 

                                MAN S VOICE (WIRELESS)
                  You got me.  They were closing in 
                on us when the rest of you were 
                  Jumping -- I thought we were goners 
                -- then they just... broke off.  
                  Left us alone.  Someone must ve 
                  been watching out for us. 

                                SHARON (WIRELESS)
                  Roger that.

                                MAN S VOICE (WIRELESS) 
                  One other thing, Boomer.  I ve got 
                  a Doctor Amarak on board who claims 
                he has an urgent matter to discuss 
                  with the President.  He s been 
                  driving me crazy...

    Baltar s blood pressure goes through the roof, he quickly 
    moves to Laura even as the radio conversation continues:

                    BALTARSHARON (WIRELESS)
        (urgent)Olympic Carrier, can you be 
    Madame President... we have more specific?  
  to cut off all communication 
    with that ship.

                                LAURA
                  What?  Why?

                    BALTARMAN S VOICE (WIRELESS)
  The Cylons let them survive.  I m afraid I can t.  He says 
    Don t you see?  They ve been he knows something about a 
    tracking that ship all along.  traitor in our midst and he s 
    There s probably a Cylon unwilling to share any more 
    agent among them right now.than that.

                                BALTAR
                        (quick, urgent)
                  Madame President --  I strongly 
                  recommend cutting off all wireless 
                  contact immediately.  They might 
                  attempt to use a broadcast signal 
                  to insert another virus into our 
                  computer systems.

    Laura looks at him -- and there s a difficult moment here 
    where Laura has to decide whether or not to trust Baltar.  
  She gauges his reaction and correctly reads his desperation 
  and concern -- but doesn t realize the motivation for his 
    genuine worry is actually self-preservation.

                                LAURA
                  Commander Adama, are you on the 
                  line?

                  as dead.

    Laura still hesitates -- Baltar can barely breathe.

                                BALTAR
                  I... repent.

    Laura takes a beat, makes her choice.

                                LAURA
                  Do it.

  She hangs up the phone and Adama hangs up on his end.  We 
    register the weight of the decision on their faces...

                                                                          CUT TO:


    Kara looks over at the transport, hesitates.

                                KARA
                  It s a civilian ship...


  Lee looks at those faces in the transport window, oblivious 
  to their fate.... he makes the decision

                                LEE
                  Cylons ll be here any second.  If

    Viper.

  She lines up the Transport.


    Sharon watches the tragedy unfolding before her.


    Everyone watching the Vipers approaching the Transport ship 
  on the dradis display.


  Lee can see the defenseless ship looming larger in his 
    gunsight.  Lee bears down and does what must be done.

                                LEE
                  Mark.

    Baltar is looking out the window -- the LIGHT from the o.c. 
    explosion dying down on his face.


  Lee is still stunned.

                                SHARON (WIRELESS)
                  Cylons are getting close, Apollo.

                  Roger that.  Let s go home.  '33' Fully Collated - 6/22/04    51.




    Laura sitting at her desk, staring at the board:  47,972.  
    Billy is sitting across from her with a stack of messages.  
  He waits a long beat, then:

                                BILLY
                  Madame President...?

  It takes Laura a moment to break away from her thoughts.

                                LAURA
                  I m sorry.  What were you saying?

                                BILLY
                  Nothing that can t wait.

    Laura nods absently, looks back at the number.

                                BILLY (cont d)
                  Two days.  No Cylons.  At least, 
                  you know it was the right choice...

                                LAURA
                  Yes.  The right choice.   
                        (beat)
                  I d like some time alone, please.

                                BILLY
                  Yes, Madame President.

    Stay with Laura as Billy heads for the door. There s a long 
    beat before she realizes that Billy hasn t left -- he s 
    standing on the threshold of the doorway, a message slip in 
  his hand.

                                LAURA
                  What is it?

                                BILLY
                  The headcount...?

                                LAURA
                  Subtract how many?

                                BILLY
                  You can add one.  Baby was born on 
                  the Rising Star.  A, uh... boy.

    Billy EXITS.  Laura then reaches out, wipes off the last 
    digit -- changes it to a 3.  It s a small thing, but somehow 
  it matters.  


    Baltar in bed with Six.  He rolls off of her.

                                BALTAR
                  That... was just what I needed.

                                NUMBER SIX
                  Sex is a celebration of God s love.

                                BALTAR
                  Yes.  Yes, I can see that now.

  She smiles at him and gives him a kiss.  He rolls back on the 
    pillows -- and from the look on his face, we can see he s no 
    more serious about his latest pledge of spiritual fealty than 
    anything else.


  The Ready Room is empty except for Lee, who is updating the 
    pilot status board with a grease pencil when Adama ENTERS.

                                LEE
                  Sir.

                                ADAMA
                  Captain.

    Adama stands next to him, looks over the board.  Lee is 
    clearly troubled, has trouble making eye contact.

                                ADAMA (cont d)
                  It had to be done.

                                LEE
                  Greater good.  Survival of the 
                  race.  Yeah.  I know.  I ll have a 
                  full report for you this afternoon.

  Lee keeps working, and Adama doesn t know how to reach out to 
  his son in this moment.  

                                ADAMA
                  I gave the order, son.  It s my

                                LEE
                  I pulled the trigger.  That s mine.

  Lee goes back to work and finally Adama EXITS.
