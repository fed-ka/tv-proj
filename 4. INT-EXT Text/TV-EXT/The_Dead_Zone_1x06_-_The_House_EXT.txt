          and foliage.  These are ERIC, 9, JIM, 7 and most
            particularly LINDSAY, 10, a girl who never has, never
          will play with dolls.  Eric has a pair of binoculars...
          whispers excitedly...

                        Let me see...

          A brief struggle for binoculars...

                                        JIM
                        No, it's my turn...

                                        LINDSAY
                        It's your turn when I say it's
                        your turn.

                                        JIM
                                (above a whisper)
                        Not fair.

                                        LINDSAY
                        Shut up, they'll hear you.

          She puts the glasses to her eyes...


          P.O.V. (BINOCULAR MATTE)

          Johnny is in work clothes, restoring a vintage Jeep in
          his driveway; Bruce's car is parked behind it.  We can't
          hear what they're saying but BRUCE is handing Johnny a
          tool...

                                        LINDSAY (O.S.)
                        He... he looks so... weird.

          Jim grabs the binoculars... looks through them... repeating
          as little kids do --

                                        JIM
                        He looks so weird.


          RESUME P.O.V. (BINOCULAR MATTE) - JOHNNY AND BRUCE

          All whispers:

                                        ERIC (O.S.)
                        Is it true about the cane, you
                        think?

                                        LINDSAY (O.S.)
                        What about the cane?

                                        ERIC (O.S.)
                        That he uses it to kill rats in 
                        his basement?

                                        LINDSAY (O.S.)
                        Why would anyone use a cane to
                        kill rats, stupid?

                                        ERIC (O.S.)
                        Because it's fun?

          Suddenly Johnny looks directly over at them...

                                        JIM (O.S.)
                        He's looking over here!


33NEW ANGLE - FAVORING JOHNNY AND BRUCE'S POV - OF THE KIDS
          DUCKING FOR COVER

          Johnny and Bruce pretending not to look.

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah, it's them again, all right.

                                        JOHNNY
                        When did I turn into Boo Radley,
                        huh?

          He shakes his head...

                        Maybe you should talk to some of
                        their parents.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The parents are more afraid of me
                        than the kids are.  People walk
                        their dogs on the other side of
                        the street.

                                        BRUCE
                        Good news for your lawn, man. 
                        It's all how you look at it.

          Johnny tries to start the jeep... it cranks but doesn't
          turn...

                                        BRUCE
                        Why don't you just buy a new one?

                                        JOHNNY
                        This one's the perfect fit for
                        me.  Out of commission for a few
                        years, needs to be rebuilt from
                        the inside out but still a classic.

          He cranks it up again... in the background the mailman
          arrives and Bruce takes the mail... the car still won't
          start...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to the car)
                        We'll get there, Nellie Belle.

                                        BRUCE
                        Good luck.  Got to get to the
                          hospital.

          Bruce hands Johnny his mail as he gets into his car, starts
          the engine on the first try...

                                        BRUCE
                                (re: the engine)
                        Modern technology.

          And drives off while Johnny walks to the mailbox and gets
          his mail as he waves good-bye.

                        How do you know?

          She lowers the glasses, Eric takes them.

                                        LINDSAY
                        Because he's psychic, stupid.

                                        JIM
                        What's 'psychic' anyway?

          Eric looks through the glasses --

          They scramble out of the bushes and run for their lives. 
          Moving to Johnny's face watching them go... smiles, but
          it's a defensive smile that speaks to his isolation...





          Little Johnny playing soccer in a junior league.  Moving
          to find Sarah and Johnny watching... Johnny's mind still

                        don't think she approves of me

                        And give her the satisfaction?

          As we push into Johnny's face...



          Ominous in this context now.  Finding Johnny who has
          returned home, standing in front, considering it.

          the house...

                        He's going inside.  Let's go.

          They crawl out from their cover... move toward the Smith
          house...



          Johnny coming out moving as fast as he can with his cane...
          moving straight to the kids' hiding place...

          They push their way out of the bushes... but Lindsay trips
          on a root and falls and it's long enough for Johnny to
          grab her... as he does --

                        What's so funny?

          They're both out of breath and tired of the struggle... 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just that I remember saying the
                        same thing to old Mr. Fordyce
                        down the street after I painted
                        his cat.  I was a little younger
                        than you.

                                  (surprised)
                        You lived in this neighborhood?

                          I wasn't always a zombie.  I was
                          actually a kid once.  If I let go
                        of you, you gonna run?

                        Because it's hard to hold you and
                        this cane and walk at the same
                        time...

                        I told you, no.

                        Our legs would get all entangled...
                        see?

          Johnny illustrates how walking with the cane and holding
          her would be almost comical... he lets go...

                        I know a trick question when I
                        hear one.

                        You get old and mean and busting
                        kids is one of the few pleasures
                        left in life, you know?

          Lindsay studies him, shakes her head, gives up.

                        It's the grey house over there.

          And they begin to walk toward a house across the street,
          just a little up the block ...

          JOHNNY

          reacts, grim, moves toward his house... reacts as he sees --

          sitting on his porch, waiting for him... her eyes are dry
          now but she's been crying recently... he moves to her...

                        Tell me if my brother's alive.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Lindsay, I'm sure as soon as they
                        have any news, they'll...

                                        LINDSAY
                        He may be hurt somewhere... you
                        might be able to help rescue him...

          A beat.  Johnny really has no alternative...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It doesn't always work.

                        Please.

          Johnny looks at her... and reaches out to take her arm...
          on his touch, ramp to his face as a vision begins...


  3232VISION - JOHNNY IN A NAVY AIRCRAFT COCKPIT

          There are two crewmen and Johnny is sitting behind the co-
          pilot.  The desert horizon of Afghanistan is visible in
          the windows, twisting and turning... there are explosions
          on all sides... the ride is lurching...  The pilot,
            Lindsay's brother, with the name, "Davis" on the uniform...
          is desperately doing everything he knows how to do to

          Lindsay looks at him curiously...

                        What did you see?

          Johnny takes a beat to collect himself.

                          Nothing.  I'm sorry.

                                        LINDSAY
                          Nothing.

          She looks at him, disappointed and angry.

          looking out from Vera's window earlier.  As...

                        What was I supposed to do?  I

                        I'm tired of The Johnny Trick. 
                        I'm tired of seeing more than I
                        ever wanted to see.  I've got to

                        There used to be a guy a few
                        streets over when I was a kid...
                        used to sit on the curb and yell
                        at people going by... I was scared
                        to death of him... like people
                        are scared of me now... for the
                        longest time, I swear I thought
                        he was Charles Manson... he had
                        long hair and those crazy eyes,
                        you know... and he'd just sit
                        there and yell... about government
                          conspiracies and Vietnam and

                        I can understand why people don't
                        want me in the neighborhood.

          Bruce looks at him...

                        Hey, there are neighborhoods where
                        they don't want me, you know?

          Johnny reacts, looks at Bruce who is very, very serious.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's easy to start thinking that
                        they're right.  The way they look
                        at you.  But you're not crazy,
                        John.  You're different.  You are
                        who you are.  And you don't
                          apologize for being who you are.

          Johnny smiles at his friend, appreciating him.

                        And by the way, I'm really into
                        this psychic network idea...

          Johnny smiles... then reacts as he hears music from inside
          the house... a cha cha... Bruce doesn't hear the music
          but notices the look on Johnny's face...

          out to open the door... Purdy gets out... looking a little
            uncomfortable...



          On the front step.  Purdy is leaving.  Johnny is
          preoccupied with the revelations of the preceding scene.

                        Forget it.  It doesn't matter.

          She lets out a deep breath... a tear runs down her cheek...
          She doesn't know what else to say...

                                        LINDSAY
                                (nods, a beat)
                        Well, I better get back.  My mom
                        is... she's really upset...

          She swallows hard and the tears come and Johnny moves to
          comfort her... puts his arms around her and as he touches
          her...

6262A THIRD FLASH - SAME SHOT OF MRS. DAVIS IN THE WINDOW -
          CLOSE



          Johnny has moved to the street, mind working, Lindsay not
            understanding what's happening... he looks at the Davis
          house... the woman is at the window at the second floor...

                                        LINDSAY
                        What is it?


          JOHNNY

          feels a chill run up his back...



          As Dana, Lindsay and Johnny watch the Davises pull out of
          the driveway...

                                        LINDSAY
                        Is she going to be all right?

          Johnny puts a hand on her shoulder... whatever he sees we
          don't get to share... but his face tells us he's pleased.

                                        JOHNNY
                        After awhile.  Yeah.  You're all
                        going to be all right.  

          He grins at Lindsay who takes comfort from his words.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Dana)
                        Well, I guess you got a story
                        after all.

                                        DANA
                        Story.  What story.  I didn't see
                          a thing.  

          Johnny reacts with new appreciation for her... and as
          they walk inside the Davis house, we pull back and up and --

                                        DANA
                        Mind if I keep you guys company?
                        I play a mean game of Mario
                          Brothers...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        END OF ACT FOUR

                                              THE END
