               Establishing.


               As the children race out of the building, the snow on the 
               ground melts away -- it's the last day of school and the 
               first day of summer in South Park.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               A huge mound of snow melts and out emerges KEVIN, the same 
               little boy we saw earlier on the poster. Kevin's MOTHER and 
               FATHER run up to him.

                                     KEVIN'S MOTHER
                         Oh golly Kevin, honey.

                                     KEVIN'S FATHER
                         Good to see you again, son.

               All three hug.

               A MAN steps out of his house and breathes in the warm summer 
               air and then...

                                     THE MAN
                         Looks like winter's right around the 
                         corner. Better get some fire wood 
                         ready!

               The man pulls out a chainsaw and cuts down a tree.


               All the trees in the forest start dropping.


               The boys continue on, as school children run and play and 
               squeal with delight. Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny walk past 
               Pip.

                                     PIP
                         Oh, happy Summer, gentlemen!

                                     STAN
                         Shut up, Pip.

                                     PIP
                         Right-o. Uh, enjoy some of the summer 
                         for me, would you?

                                     KYLE
                         What do you mean?

                                     PIP
                         Well, I have to spend my summer in 
                         summer school, because I can't be 
                         left alone. You see, my parents are 
                         dead.

               The boys just stand there, blinking, with nothing to say. 
               Finally, Cartman speaks up.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Your parents are dead? God damn you 
                         suck, Pip!

               The boys walk off laughing.


               The boys walk down the street, passing a sign for 'Stu's 
               fireworks'.

                                     STAN
                         Oh yeah, dude! It's summer, that 
                         means we gotta buy fireworks!

                                     KYLE
                         I saved up enough money to buy m-
                         80's this year.

                                     STAN
                         I saw in this movie once where this 
                         guy stuck a firecracker up a cat's 
                         butt.

                                     KYLE
                         Cool! Maybe we can do that to 
                         Cartman's cat.

                                     CARTMAN
                         AY! IF YOU SO MUCH AS TOUCH KITTY'S 
                         ASS I'LL PUT FIRECRACKERS IN YOUR 
                         NUTSACK AND BLOW YOUR BALLS ALL OVER 
                         YOUR PANTS!!

                                     STAN
                         Jesus, Cartman...

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, I'm just sayin' na, don't mess 
                         with kitty, na.


               Circa 1991. The boys are playing with firecrackers. They 
               look exactly the same, except they are tiny one-year olds.

               Suddenly, a firecracker explodes and kills little baby Kenny.

                                     BABY STAN
                         Goo, goo goo! killed Kenny!!

                                     BABY KYLE
                              (shaking his fists)
                         Ooo bastards!

                                                          DISSOLVE BACK TO:


               Kyle, Cartman, Stan and Kenny are standing at the busstop. 
               There is no snow around them.

               They just stand there, blinking.

                                     STAN
                         Man, it's hot out here.

                                     CARTMAN
                         What do you guys wanna do? We have 
                         the whole summer to play!

                                     KYLE
                         Dude, what are we supposed to do? We 
                         always just played with fireworks.

                                     STAN
                         I know! Let's go sledding!

                                     KYLE
                         Yeah!


               Stan, Kyle, and Kenny are sitting on a sled at the top of a 
               grassy hill. Cartman stands behind them.

                                     STAN
                         Come on, Cartman, get on.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Stan?

                                     KYLE
                         Let's go, dude. We're ready.

                                     STAN
                         What the hell are you waiting for, 
                         Cartman?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Guys? Don't you notice anything wrong 
                         with this picture?

                                     KYLE
                         Yea, your fat ass isn't on the sled!

               Cartman reluctantly gets on the back of the sled.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Whatever.

               The sled slides down the grassy hill about an inch and then 
               stops.

               The boys blink.

                                     STAN
                         What the hell is going on?

               Just then Jimbo and Ned drive up in Jimbo's hummer.

                                     JIMBO
                         Hey there, boys!

                                     STAN
                         Hi, Uncle Jimbo.

                                     JIMBO
                         How come you're not out blowing things 
                         up? It's summer?

                                     KYLE
                         Didn't you hear? That outlawed 
                         fireworks cuz a little boy blew off 
                         his hands.

                                     JIMBO
                         WHAT?!

                                     STAN
                         Yeah, they're not even having them 
                         at the lake this year.

                                     JIMBO
                         Oh my God! Well, don't worry boys, 
                         Uncle Jimbo is on the case!

               Jimbo speeds away.


               Jimbo and Ned are in the van heading South.

                                     JIMBO
                         Buckle your seatbelt, Ned.

                                     NED
                         Where are we going?

                                     JIMBO
                         Mexico, my amigo.

                                     NED
                         Why are we going to Mexico?

                                     JIMBO
                         To buy fireworks. Just cuz some kid 
                         blew off his hands, doesn't mean the 
                         rest of us have to suffer, now does 
                         it?

                                     NED
                         Are fireworks legal in Mexico?

                                     JIMBO
                         Hell, everything's legal in Mexico. 
                         It's the American way.


               The boys are building a "snowman" out of rocks, sticks and 
               dirt.

                                     KYLE
                              (singing)
                         Dusty the dirtball...

                                     STAN
                         Why does everything have to suck so 
                         bad in summer?

               Mr. Garrison walks up. He looks like total shit. He is 
               unshaven and shaking.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey look, it's Mr. Garrison.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Hello children. How is your summer 
                         going.

                                     STAN
                         Summer sucks ass, Mr. Garrison.

                                     KYLE
                         Hey, have you found Mr. Hat yet?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Oh, oh, that old thing? Why, I almost 
                         forgot he was gone. I don't need Mr. 
                         Hat.

                                     STAN
                         That's good.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Mr. Hat is just a puppet.

                                     KYLE
                         Yup.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Mr. Hat isn't real.

                                     STAN
                         Right.

               Mr. Garrison just stands there and blinks for a long time.

               Finally, he just walks away.

               The boys go back to their snowman.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Hey you guys, my mom signed me up 
                         for swimming lessons at the community 
                         pool. You wanna come?

               Stan, Kyle and Kenny crack up laughing.

                                     STAN
                         Swimming lessons? Dude, that is the 
                         lamest thing I've ever heard.

                         Everyone knows that the first graders 
                         pee in the community pool.

                         in first grader pee.

                                     CARTMAN
                         AY! I am not swimming around in pee!

                         lessons, I could be in the Olympics 
                         someday.

                         bad situation! I don't need to hear

               Cartman storms off.

                         There, how does that look?

                                     KYLE
                         Like a big hunk of dirt with a carrot 
                         sticking out of it.

                                     STAN
                         Ah, crap!


               A few children play and frolic in the pool.

               Cartman is standing outside the pool in his swimming trunks, 
               but still wearing his little blue hat.

               Cartman walks up slowly to the edge of the pool and sticks a 
               toe in.

                                     CARTMAN
                         AGH!

               He runs further away.

               The LIFEGUARD, dressed in a red swimsuit, blows her whistle.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         Okay kids, everyone in the pool!

               A few more kids jump in. Cartman is left alone at the other 
               end.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         Come on, Eric we're gonna start now!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Nuh-uh.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         Just jump in.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I don't wanna.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         It's not going to hurt you, hon, 
                         just do it.

               Cartman takes a deep breath, then jumps into the water.

                                     CARTMAN
                         BLAH! UGH!!

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         There you go! Now just let the first 
                         graders swim by you, and then head 
                         towards us.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Huh? First Graders???

               Just then, three little FIRST GRADERS merrily swim by. They 
               pause in front of Cartman, and some of the water turns yellow.

                                     CARTMAN
                         HEY!! AW!!!! WEAK!! WEAK!!

               The first graders swim on by.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Oh, you sons a bitches!!

                                          ACT II


               South Park residents are hanging balloons, setting up food 
               tents and building bleachers for the big event.

                                     MAYOR
                              (checking her watch)
                         Where the hell is our firework?! We 
                         only have 24 hours!

                                     AIDE
                         I'm sure it will be here any second.

                                     MAYOR
                         Shut up!

                                     AIDE
                         Copy that.

               Meanwhile, the boys are all on a small stage with the rest 
               of their classmates. They are all with musical instruments.

               The music teacher steps up with a little baton.

                                     MR. ROMERO
                         Okay, children, I'm sure we're a 
                         little rusty -- Where is Eric Cartman?

                                     STAN
                         He's taking swimming lessons.

                                     MR. ROMERO
                         Oh dear, how are we supposed to sound 
                         good without our French Horn section? 
                         Well, let's try some scales first -- 
                         C scale first. And --

               Mr. Romero conducts his arms, and the kids start playing the 
               most God awful mix of noises you've ever heard.

               Finally, they stop.

                                     MR. ROMERO
                         Okay, that was pretty good. Let's 
                         play Mozart's symphony number 5...

               Mr. Romero lowers his hands. The kids play the same God awful 
               sound.

                                     MAYOR
                         Oh, we're doomed. Our fourth of July 
                         celebration is going to have no 
                         fireworks and a bunch of tone deaf 
                         little shits playing -- wait a minute --

               Just then, a distant chopping sound is heard. The Mayor looks 
               up.

                                     MAYOR
                         It's the snake!


               Three Comanche helicopters fly over South Park. It's got the 
               gigantic snake attached to it.

               South Park residents hoot and holler as they watch the 
               helicopter fly overhead.


               Officer Barbrady stands in front of the townspeople who are 
               watching the helicopter.

                                     OFFICE BARBRADY
                         Let's move along, people. If you've 
                         seen one giant snake thingy firework, 
                         you've seen them all.

                                     MAYOR
                         CALL EVERYBODY!! THE SHOW'S BACK 
                         ON!! COME ON, WE'VE ONLY GOT ONE DAY

               Jimbo and Ned walk into the crappy little Mexican store.

                                     JIMBO

               The Owner hands them a large box with whatever the Spanish 
               word for DANGER is printed on it.

               Jimbo opens the box.

                                     JIMBO
                         Would you look at that, Ned? That's 
                         a Tijuana bottle rocket! These babies 
                         have enough power to blast a fiery 
                         hole right through the ozone.

                         Claus on Christmas Morning!

               Cartman is standing in the shallow end of the pool, looking 
               at all the other kids and the lifeguard at the deep end of 
               the pool.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         Eric, you have to get in the deep 
                         end sooner or later.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Later's fine.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         Just do your side stroke.

                                     CARTMAN
                         I only know how to do it doggie style.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         That's doggie-PADDLE, Eric. Now come 
                         over here!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Can I do it doggie style?

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         Okay.

               Cartman starts to waddle towards the deep end.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         That's it! That's it! You can do it!

                                     CARTMAN
                         Sweet...

               But again, just then, the first graders come giggling and 
               swimming by.

               They swim by and turn the water around Eric yellow again.

                                     CARTMAN
                         AW! DAMMIT!! AAGHAGH NOT AGAIN!!

               Cartman scrambles around back to the shallow end.

                                     LIFEGUARD
                         Come on, Eric!

                                     CARTMAN
                         NO WAY!! THOSE SONS OF BITCHES!... 
                         I'M GOING HOME


               People are partying and celebrating.

               A newscaster is standing among the partying people. His name, 
               CREAMY GOODNESS, is printed at the bottom of the screen.

                                     CREAMY GOODNESS
                         Thanks, Tom. It looks like the 
                         firework ban won't be putting a damper 
                         on one town's festivities tonight...

               Creamy walks through scores of people who are having fun and 
               mugging for the camera.

                                     CREAMY GOODNESS
                         I'm here at Stark's Pond in South 
                         Park, where the crowd of residents 
                         and scores of tourists anxiously 
                         await the lighting of the largest 
                         snake in human history.

               Chet pulls out a package of traditional snakes.

                                     CREAMY GOODNESS
                         Now as most of you will probably 
                         remember, snakes are these little 
                         round discs that you light, and they 
                         spew out a little 'snake' of black 
                         ash. Well, the South Park's snake is 
                         over half a mile in diameter and 
                         twenty stories high...

               The camera cuts to the massive disc, as final preparations 
               are being made to it.

                                     CREAMY GOODNESS
                         I'm told that this event won't begin 
                         until the sun goes down and night is 
                         upon us.

               The sun quickly goes down. It's now dark.

                                     CREAMY GOODNESS
                         Alrighty then, looks like we're ready.


               The boys are assembled with the band. They're all wearing 
               tuxedos.

                                     STAN
                         How are your swimming lessons going, 
                         Cartman?

                                     CARTMAN
                         Fine...

                                     KYLE
                         I heard you won't even get in the 
                         deep end.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Well, you heard WRONG, hippie!!

               ANGLE ON THE MAYOR:

               She stands before the townspeople.

                                     MAYOR
                         Ladies and gentlemen. Good citizens 
                         of Colorado. It is my pleasure to be 
                         the first person to wish you all a 
                         Happy Fourth of July. Let's start 
                         with our school band playing the 
                         Stars and Stripes!!

                                     MR. ROMERO
                              (nervous)
                         This is it... And a one and a two 
                         and a --

               The kids all start playing The Stars and Stripes. It is barely 
               recognizable.

               The large crowd holds their hands over their ears.

               Mr. Romero continues to conduct as if he's in front of the 
               Boston Symphony Orchestra.

               The Mayor is terrified.

                                     MAYOR
                         What the fuck is that?

                                     MAYOR'S ASSISTANT
                         I think it's the Stars and Stripes.

                                     MAYOR
                         Oh hell. LIGHT THE SNAKE!!

               The crowd goes wild.

               Four men with big torches light the snake as the crowd cheers.

               ANGLE ON THE BOYS:

               They try to get a glimpse of the snake and play at the same 
               time.

               ANGLE ON THE SNAKE:

               As it continues burning, a pillar of hard black ash emerges 
               from the top, and starts to grow!

                                     TOWNSFOLK
                         Ooh!

               The column of ash grows up towards the sky.

                                     TOWNSFOLK
                         Ahh!


               Jimbo's hummer drives down the highway towards some lights.


               The tourists are in still in awe, basking in the brilliant 
               glow of the continually growing snake. It is reaching epic 
               size.

               The kids are now in the second movement of the Stars and 
               Stripes. Romero still conducts happily, and Cartman turns 
               pages of sheet music as if he's reading it.

               The Mayor stands next to Charlie with a huge smile on her 
               face.

                                     MAYOR
                         My God, it's beautiful. It never 
                         fails to amaze me how I manage to 
                         overcome adversity!

               The Mayor watches as the huge column of hardened, black ash 
               continues to belch forth from the black disc.

               After QUITE A WHILE, the Mayor finally starts to lose her 
               smile.

                                     MAYOR
                         Say, uh, Charlie, when does that 
                         thing die out?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Die out?

                                     MAYOR
                         Yes, you know, expire, end.

               Charlie looks at her for a long time.

               A REALLY LONG TIME. He just sits there, staring at her, 
               thinking.

               Finally, the Mayor gets impatient.

                                     MAYOR
                         Hello? I'm asking you when it stops.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Uh... I'm not sure, I never made one 
                         this big.

               The snake is growing and growing to monstrous proportions.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I guess we didn't quite think this 
                         through, did we...

                                     MAYOR
                         WHAT?!

               The boys continue to play, but their eyes are fixed on the 
               their growing snake.

                                     KYLE
                         Dude, that thing is huge!!

                         Yeah, they need to shut it off.

                                     CARTMAN
                         HEY! YOU GUYS ARE SCREWING UP THE 
                         SONG!!

               Now all the tourists and residents start to look concerned. 
               As the snake spirals up to the sky, and finally collapses 
               under its weight!

               Everybody runs screaming as the huge pillar of ash heads for 
               the ground.

                                     TOWNSFOLK
                              (screaming)
                         Somebody stop it! It's out of control!

                                     THE BOYS
                         Aaaaah!!

               Stan, Kyle and Cartman dive out of the way. Kenny isn't as 
               quick.

                                     KYLE
                         Kenny! Watch out!

               Right in the nick of time, however, Kenny jumps out of the 
               way and ducks under the bleachers. Everyone is relieved.

               But the bleachers collapse and kill him.

                                     STAN
                         Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!

                                     KYLE
                              (shaking his fists at 
                              the bleachers)
                         You bastards!

               The boys immediately go back to playing.

               ANGLE ON THE ROGUE SNAKE:

               The growing snake continues to grow and spew.

                                     MAYOR

                         snake lasts three minutes...

               Charlie quickly scribbles down some numbers.

                                     MAYOR
                         SO WHEN DOES IT RUN OUT?!

                         Oh hell.

               As black ash falls all around, and people everywhere run 
               screaming, Kyle starts playing 'Nearer My God To Thee' on 
               his violin. The other kids all join in a la The Titanic.

                                     EVERYBODY
                         AAAAAGHGHGH!!!

                                         ACT III


               The huge, massive snake slithers its way through Downtown, 
               knocking over each building slowly, as it goes


               The Snake continues to grow. The lake area is all but 
               abandoned but for the reporter Creamy Goodness.

                                     CREAMY GOODNESS
                         Well, we're coming up on nine hours 
                         and the giant snake of South Park 
                         shows no signs of stopping. Residents 
                         have tried everything from firehoses 
                         to yelling at it, to make the snake 
                         stop, but nothing seems to work.


               The boys walk down the blackened, destroyed streets as the 
               huge snake bulldozes another building.

                                     STAN
                         Man, this sucks.

               A few people run screaming by them.

                         What should we do, dude? That big 
                         snake keeps growing! It's gonna 
                         demolish the whole state soon!

                         We should do what we always do; ask 
                         Chef for help.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Where is Chef?


               Chef is lying on a nice lounger, surrounded by beautiful, 
               busty women, drinking a Mai Tai One is massaging his 
               shoulders.

                                     CHEF
                              (singing)
                         Baby, you know you're the girl for 
                         me. And all that I want to be is. 
                         You and me, and her simultaneous. 
                         You and me and you and you 
                         simultaneous loving, baby! 2 or 3 
                         simultaneous Ooh that's right...

               One woman pours Chef a drink. Another takes his towel and 
               replaces it with a new.

               Just then the phone rings.

               Chef picks the phone up and puts it to his ear, and the women 
               continue doing what they were doing.

                                     CHEF
                         Hello? ... What? ...Oh, hello, 
                         children.

               Chef smiles at the ladies.

                                     CHEF
                         It's a what?... A giant snake?... 
                         Killing everybody?... Growing bigger?!

               Chef looks again at the ladies.

                                     CHEF
                         Children, you know I rarely say this 
                         but... Well, futch ya.

               And he hangs up the phone.

                                     CHEF
                              (sack to singing)

               Stan is on a pay phone He hangs it up.

                         Wow.

                         How is that gonna help?


               A title tell us we are In UTAH.

               Several white clothed white people are dipping a young man 
               in a large pool of water.

                                     MORMON #1
                         Yea! Let the spirit of Heavenly Father 
                         be blessed upon you.

                                     MORMON #2
                         From this day on, all will be well!

               The newly baptized Mormon smiles broadly.

                                     BAPTIZED MORMON
                         I already feel like things are getting 
                         better.

               Just then, the large black snake oozes itself through the 
               congregation. They all scream and die like the worthless 
               mother fuckers they are.


               ANOTHER TITLE SAYS 'NEW YORK'

               With slow JAZZ MUSIC playing, we establish at a skyscraper.


               A title card tells us we are in 'Texas'. There is a single 
               building, which reads 'Texas Prison'.


               A title card now says 'Green Bay Wisconsin'. We ZOOM IN on a 
               green & yellow building that says 'Sports Spa'.


                                     CARTMAN
                         Okay, no first graders around. I can 
                         swim to the deep end... I can do 
                         it... I can do it... I can, I'm gonna 
                         make it...


               From space, we can actually see the giant snake, in it's 
               branching out state taking over the U.S.


               The boys are sitting by the giant disc watching it continue 
               to grow with bored expressions.

               One SOLITARY GUY stands next to them, holding a sign that 
               says 'This is it! repent your sins! The end is upon us!'

               The guy with the sign looks just as bored as the boys do.

                         soon.

               Jimbo's big ass hummer screeches to a halt in front of the 
               boys.

                         There's nothing to do.

               Jimbo looks at the twisting, burning snake.

                                     JIMBO
                         Well... I don't think those are 
                         problems that some TIJUANA BOTTLE 
                         ROCKETS CAN'T SOLVE!!!

               Jimbo holds out the box.

                         HOORAY!!!!

               Jimbo and Ned hand out the large bottle rockets to the boys.

                         Careful with those, now, those are 
                         dangerous.

               Everybody holds a Tijuana Bottle Rocket. Jimbo takes out a 
               lighter and lights the ends.

                                     JIMBO
                         Point 'em away from your eyes, now.

                         Wow! These are HUGE!

               As the fuses burn, Jimbo walks over to Ned and puts one arm 
               around him.

                                     JIMBO
                         Aw, look at them Ned. Look how much 
                         happiness a little firepower can 
                         bring to a child...

               Suddenly, the bottle rockets all FLY OUT!! Into the SKY!!

               BLAM!!!! The rockets explode on the snake, blasting it into 
               flakes of ash.

               The ash falls all around the base of the snake and puts out 
               the fire!!

                                     STAN
                         HEY, LOOK! WE BLEW UP THE SNAKE!!

               Suddenly, a small crowd of townspeople gather around.

                                     TOWNSPERSON
                         All the ash from the snake is putting 
                         the flame out!

                                     JIMBO
                         Well, how do you like that? Bottle 
                         rockets SAVED the Fourth of July!

                         The snake's been destroyed. The pool's 
                         open.

               A hand reaches in and yanks off the sign. The first graders 
               all jump into the empty pool and it turns yellow with their 
               pee.

                                     CARTMAN
                         Huh?... Oh no... you sons of bitches! 
                         Ahh sons of bitches.


               The black ash continues to fall all around. Everything is 
               slowly turning black.

                                     TOWNSPERSON
                         LOOK! THEY PUT OUT THE SNAKE!!

               The townspeople all cheer.

                                     MAYOR
                         Uh... Yes! Apparently my plan to 
                         blow up the snake worked perfectly!

                                     KYLE
                         Hey look!

               Kyle points to the flakes of blackened ash that falls from 
               the sky.

                                     KYLE
                         It's snowing!!!

                                     JIMBO
                         Well, it's snowing black ash, but 
                         what the hell!

               All the children in the area cheer.

               Within seconds it becomes a festive, wintery scene. As 
               Christmas music plays, the kids all play in the black "snow" 
               having snowball fights, building snowmen and making snow 
               angles.

                         WINTER'S BACK!!

               Just then Mr. Garrison appears. He has a new, strange puppet 
               attached to his hand. It's just a stick with a shirt on it.

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Wow! It's a black blizzard!

                                     KYLE
                         Mr. Garrison... where's Mr. Hat?

                                     MR. GARRISON
                         Oh, I'm through with Mr. Hat. He's a 
                         two timing whore. From now on 
                         children, you're all going to be 
                         learning from Mr. TWIG!

               Mr. Garrison holds up a twig with a purple shirt on that has 
               a pink triangle on in.

                                     MR. GARRISON (AS MR. TWIG)
                         That's right children, I'll see you 
                         in the fall!!

                              (sarcastically)
                         I can hardly wait.

                                         EPILOGUE


               Chef's car pulls up from over the hill. Chef gets out of his 
               car and looks around. He can't believe what he's seeing.

               From Chef's POV, we see the all black town of South Park. 
               Kids are still playing in the black ash as if it was snow.

               Chef looks over and sees the boys building a black snow man. 
               They are absolutely black themselves. In fact, their faces 
               look like they're in black-face.

                                     CHEF
                         Hey children, everybody.. I'm back, 
                         I'm back from Aruba. What the...

                                     STAN
                         Hey Chef!

                                     CARTMAN
                         How's it going?

               Chef looks to his left and sees a group of townspeople, also 
               all in blackface, cleaning up the streets.

                                     TOWNSPERSON
                         Howdy Chef! How was your summer 
                         vacation?

               Chef's jaw is dropped wide open.

                                     CHEF
                         Okay, everybody get in a line so I 
                         can WHOOP ALL YOUR ASSES!

                                         THE END
