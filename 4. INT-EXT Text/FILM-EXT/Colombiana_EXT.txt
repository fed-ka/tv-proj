At a table, with bottle of liquor and two glasses, Don
Luis sits opposite...
FABIO
Why not?
Cat's father. Off to the side, Don Luis's right hand man,
MARCO, stands like any right hand, unobtrusive.
DON LUIS
Because I love you Fabio. Like a
brother.
FABIO
And I love you Don Luis. Like a
brother.
He turns to Marco.
DON LUIS
Can you believe this guy Marco?
We started when we were little...how
old were we Fabio?
FABIO
Ten.
DON LUIS
Ten year old bastards stealing
apples from the carts in the market.
After all we've been through.
And now we're on top, he wants to
leave...
FABIO
Luis, I'm going to be honest with
you. You remember I had that
operation?
3.
DON LUIS
That was last year.
FABIO
Since then, I'm not a hundred
percent. And you can't do this
thing if you're not a hundred
percent. I'm tired.
DON LUIS
So you'll take a rest.
FABIO
You know how many times we should
have been dead?
DON LUIS
I don't even want to count.
FABIO
Neither do I. But you gotta think.
How lucky we are to still be alive.
DON LUIS
Yeah. That's right. We're alive.
And what about the future of this
thing we built?
FABIO
It's yours. It's not my thing any
more.
DON LUIS
I'm not going to talk you out of
it, am I cabron?
FABIO
I'll always be there for you Luis.
Just pick up the phone, I'm there.
DON LUIS
I'm gonna hold you to that. You
bastard.
(EMOTIONAL)
I'm going to miss you.
FABIO
And I'm going to miss you.
DON LUIS
OK. Enough of this sentimental
bullshit. Next we'll be crying
like two old women. Come on! One
last drink, huh?
He pours the liquor into the glasses.
DON LUIS
To the future.
4.
They tap glasses.
FABIO
Bueno.
They shoot the liquor down. Fabio rises.
DON LUIS
So. Business is all clear?
FABIO
All clear.
He hands Don Luis a computer disc.
FABIO
It's all here.
DON LUIS
No other copies?
FABIO
You even have to ask?
DON LUIS
Hey.
He shrugs. Opens his arms. The two men embrace. Close
as brothers.
FABIO
Adios Marco. Make sure he doesn't
get in too much trouble.
MARCO
Adios Don Fabio. I'll do my best.
And with that, Fabio exits the garden. Don Luis watches
him, sad to see his friend go. Sighs deeply, pours himself
a whiskey, downs it, turns to Marco.
DON LUIS
Kill this motherfucker.
Fabio's car comes to a screeching halt. Fabio exits to
three other gunmen, nervous, on edge. The gunmen from the
car take defensive positions. Fabio runs up the stairs.
As Fabio's men keep a sharp lookout, two SUV's come rolling
down the street. Their fingers work the triggers of their
weapons. The two SUV's roll up. The blacked out windows
roll down.
MAN
(polite. smiling)
Hola. We want to see Don Fabio.
BODYGUARD
He's not home.
MAN
You mind if we wait?
BODYGUARD
Your time.
The man in the SUV is on the phone.
MAN
They said he's not home yet.
He listens.
MAN
OK. OK.
He hangs up. Puts his phone back in his pocket. Walks up
to Fabio's men.
MAN
Change of plans.
He pulls out his gun, shoots them point blank.
Cat leaps from one rooftop to another, shinnies down a
drain pipe onto another roof.
14.
ANGLE ON THE GUNMEN
Jumping down from the window of Cat's home, start to sprint
across the roof in hot pursuit.
ON CAT
She drops down to another roof, this one filled with a
vegetable patch, where an old man is gardening.
Marco exits Cat's house, wrapping his bloody hand tightly
with a piece of his shirt.
MARCO
Go! Go!
He orders four more gunmen who have just zoomed up on
motorcycles. The souped up rice rockets take off in four
different directions.
ON CAT
As she comes off the last rooftop, down into a small alley.
She sprints across to a small door. She kicks at the door,
which gives way and enters...
AN OPEN COURTYARD
Where a half dozen women are doing laundry by an open tap.
They look up to the sight of this little girl in the blood
splattered school uniform, do not say a word. And neither
does Cat. She just runs through to a small gate on the
far side of the courtyard, opens it, and disappears. One
of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the
gate, hiding it.
ON THE GUNMEN
They crash through the vegetable garden. The old man deftly
kicks a rake leaning against the wall. It falls in between
the rows of tomato vines.
When the gunmen sprint through, the first one trips over
the rake, goes crashing through the vines, which causes
the two men behind him to also trip and fall. The fourth
man hurdles his fallen cohorts, bounds over the roof.
And the fifth man, looks at the old man. Knows what he
has done. Shoots him dead before jumping off the roof.
ON CAT
She races down a steep hill in the crowded favela streets.
ON THE GUNMEN
15.
They enter the laundry yard. The women don't even look
up. The gunmen look around, just see laundry hanging from
the fence, do not see the hidden door. Race back out.
ON CAT
She runs down a steep alley, filled with people sitting
outside their homes, chatting, playing dominoes.
At the end of the alley, two motorcycles appear. The riders
see Cat, as she sees them. They turn their bikes into the
alley...
VRROOOM!
And bear down on Cat.
Cat sprints back up the hill. She goes to escape into one
of the open doors, but she finds that one after another
the doors have closed shut, the people fled inside.
The bikes eat up the hill. Cat's legs are no match for
them. It seems she will be caught any second. She ducks
down a street where laundry is hung on a concealed metal
pipe running the length of the alley. As Cat ducks through
the sheets the gunmen gun their bikes right towards her,
tear through the sheets...
AND THE CONCEALED METAL PIPE CATCHES THEM ACROSS THEIR
THROATS.
ON CAT
She looks back, to the dead gunmen, disappears over the
hill.
AND JUST AS SHE DOES...
Marco, in an open top jeep, with three of his gunmen ON
BOARD, comes rolling up the road. He sees Cat.
MARCO
There!
The jeep screeches around. Cat dashes down an alley.
ON CAT
As she runs up the alley with it's open sewers running on
either side.
ON MARCO
The alley is too narrow for the jeep. The men spill out,
spring up the alley.
MARCO
Alive!
16.
ON CAT
She runs up the alley, then ducks down another one. She
comes to a ladder that leads up a fence, begins to climb.
ON THE GUNMEN
Running up the alley, turning into the next one. Where
they see the ladder. One of the gunmen pulls out his cell
phone.
ON MARCO
In the jeep, scouting as it rolls along.
ON CAT
She is running for all she is worth, out of breath, scared.
ANGLE ON
More thugs on bikes, on foot, in cars. They are everywhere.
ON CAT
She is leaning against a wall on a rooftop, gulping air,
when she hears the roar of engines. Looks over the side
of the building to see dozens of gunmen flooding the area.
ON GUNMEN
Climbing the ladder.
ON CAT
Hearing them coming.
ON GUNMEN
Surrounding a building. Throwing grappling hooks onto the
roof ledge.
ON CAT
Seeing the grappling hooks claw onto the roof edge.
ON GUNMEN
Cresting the roof from the ladder.
ON GUNMEN
Rappelling up the side of the building on the grappling
ropes.
ON GUNMEN
Flooding onto the roof from both sides. Coming to the
spot where Cat was only moments before. To find no Cat.
17.
One of the gunmen takes out his cell. Dials.
ON MARCO
On the phone.
MARCO
North! Go North! We're cutting
off the southern streets!
Marco slams his phone shut. Heads for his car.
ON GUNMEN
GUNMAN
North!
The gunmen clear the roof. As the last one leaves, he
takes one last suspicious sweep of the roof, cannot figure
where this wisp of a girl went to. His eyes briefly focus
on the chimney...
GUNMAN
Let's go.
He clambers over the side of the roof.
THE CAMERA STAYS FOCUSED ON THE CHIMNEY.
Cat comes over the top of a hill, the soot of the chimney,
mingled with the blood of her parents, staining her dress.
The doors and windows all along the street are shuttered
tight. Her eyes search the curb as she makes her way down
the street. When she hears the sound of a vehicle. She
looks up to a jeep turning the corner.
REVERSE ON MARCO
In the windshield of the jeep, staring at her.
MARCO
We got her! Close the net!
ON CAT
She sees Marco. She pauses for a moment, and then does
something that stuns even Marco. She starts to run right
towards the jeep!
ON MARCO
18.
A bit stunned.
MARCO
What is she doing?
ON CAT
She keeps sprinting toward the jeep. Another jeep appears
over the hill behind her. Starts to come at her.
ON MARCO
As his jeep speeds right for her.
ON CAT
As she runs, her eyes go to the right, and it becomes
apparent she knows exactly what she is doing. She has a
plan. And she executes it. Suddenly, she leaps for the
curb and...
A SEWER GRATE.
ON MARCO
Sees Cat dive to the curb.
MARCO
No!
ON CAT
As she wriggles her skinny little body down the grate,
with barely enough room to squeeze in. But in she does
squeeze.
ON MARCO
In total disbelief, watching her disappear down the narrow
slit in the curb.
Both jeeps pull up. The men jump out. Marco flattens to
the street, peers into the grate, sees Cat staring up at
him.
Marco takes his gun out. Jams it in the grate...
BAMBAMBAMBAMBAM!!!!
Empties his clip into the dark. When he runs out of ammo,
he peers down again.
Cat is gone. The gunmen run to the next sewer grate fire
into that one. Marco looks down, no Cat.
MARCO
Get down there!
The gunmen rip the grate out, jump down the hole.
19.
Cars and trucks rumble along a busy thoroughfare.
CLOSE ON A SEWER GRATE CUT INTO THE SIDE OF THE CURB
A hand emerges. And then, Cat pulls herself out, into the
street.
PULL BACK TO CAT RISING
She stands at the edge of the busy thoroughfare, and looks
around. She is in the heart of the city. Where tall office
buildings, compete with graceful, classical mansions. In
the distance, she sees the hillsides, covered with the
twinkling lights of the favelas, two miles, and a world
away.
Two Marines stand guard. Looking straight ahead.
VOICE
Excuse me...
20.
The Marine looks down to Cat. Bedraggled, covered in soot
and blood and shit. Holding out the card her father gave
her.
CLOSE ON THE FACE OF A MIDDLE AGED AMERICAN
PULL BACK TO
The car passes a gate with a sign: MISS PORTERS SCHOOL FOR
GIRLS.
VOICE
It's been our mission statement
since we first opened our doors in
nineteen twenty three...
The sun comes up over the horizon, casts it's first rays
through the windows of...
As seedy as any bus terminal. People bustling, people
hustling. A veritable cauldron of humanity bubbling with
the good, the bad, the ugly. The predators and the prey.
Cat exits into this stew of life, looks around, checks
things out. As she is checked out in turn by some pretty
sleazy types.
Cat ignores the eyes following her, walks up to a dwarf
hawking newspapers. Hands him her slip of paper. He points
her in a direction.
MONTAGE
Cat walks across the neighborhoods of Chicago.
Sees the signs in Polish change into signs in Italian, in
Spanish, Chinese, Ethiopian.
She hands her paper to an Ethiopian cabbie. He points her
onward.
She walks past bars where black gangbangers watch her pass.
She hands one her paper, he points her on.
She walks past massive churches, synagogues, mosques.
She walks past the stately houses of the Gold Coast, along
the deserted stretches of the glam shops on Michigan Avenue,
over the bridges...
Until she comes to...
The denizens of this world look every bit as dangerous as
they are. Gangbangers, con artists, trouble waiting to
happen at every turn.
ANGLE ON CAT
Cat, walking down the block as the eyes of everyone she
passes follow her. She stops on a street corner. Seems
lost. Opposite her a group of men, hanging outside a bar
see her. The leader of the group calls her over.
MAN
Hey kid. You know what time it
is?
Cat shakes her head.
28.
MAN
It's late, and this is not the
kind of place a kid should be
hanging out. What are you doing
here?
Cat hands him her paper. He looks at her, suspicious.
MAN
Who are you?
CAT
Cataleya.
The man takes a moment...
MAN
Wait here.
He disappears up a small alley into the darkness beyond.
Cat, not knowing what to do, sits down on the curb, watches
street life. She sees...
Hookers soliciting men in passing cars.
Cops sitting in a patrol car, bored, blase.
Men playing craps against a wall.
Some very discreet dope deals, more sleight of hand than
anything else.
CLOSE ON A FIST COLLIDING WITH A FACE
A very bloodied face. Once, twice, three times.
PULL BACK TO
Cat is sitting watching the street, when a pair of legs
appear in front of her. Cat looks up to the man who
disappeared.
MAN
Come with me.
He turns abruptly, heads back up the alley.
Cat follows the man through a darkened alley. At intervals,
on either side, dangerous looking men, armed to the teeth,
stand in the shadows. The man opens a door, beckons Cat
to enter.
The sun peeks over the horizon, spreading the fog infused
light coming off Lake Michigan across the sleeping city as
it ascends in the sky.
CLOSE ON
One beam of sunlight slips through the narrow crack between
a window and the shade covering it.
CLOSE ON
The ray of sunlight washes across Cat's sleeping face.
She wakes slowly. Her eyes open after a long sleep. For
a moment she does not remember where she is.
PULL BACK TO
Emilio walks Cat down the street. He is carrying a kids
book bag.
33.
EMILIO
The good news is your father bought
you your life with what he gave
you. The bad news is Don Luis was
playing both sides, and has
disappeared. You tore down
everything he spent years building
up with that little chip. It is
something he will not forget.
There is a law in this thing of
ours. If someone does you, the
revenge goes all the way down the
line. Women, children,
Grandmothers, dogs, cats. No
exceptions.
CAT
Are you trying to scare me?
EMILIO
I am trying to educate you.
CLOSE ON MONEY BEING COUNTED
PULL BACK TO
As Emilio walks along, with Cataleya, reading the list of
supplies.
EMILIO
We'll get all this stuff, then go
over to this little place I know
down on Maxwell street for some of
these hot dogs the Polish people
make here.
He turns left at the cross street...
EMILIO
You like hot dogs?
He looks down, sees no Cat. Looks back to see Cat walking
in the opposite direction.
EMILIO
Hey!
Cat keeps going.
EMILIO
Hey!
He hurries, catches up with her.
EMILIO
Where you going?
CAT
I've already been to school. I
told you what I want to be. You
don't want to help me, fine. I'll
do it myself.
She walks off. Emilio grabs her.
EMILIO
Chica. Any idiot can be a killer.
Look!
Emilio draws a .357 magnum pistol from his shoulder holster,
and empties the entire clip into the front of a car coming
down the street. The car careens off the road, smashes a
fire hydrant, crashes through a plate glass window of a
shop across the street. The water from the hydrant shoot
twenty feet in the air. Emilio holsters his gun.
EMILIO
You want me to teach you to be a
killer? No problema. I'll teach
you. But you'll be dead in five
years.
(MORE)
35.
EMILIO (CONT'D)
If you want to be a killer, and
survive, you have to be a smart
one. You have to know things
besides how to pull a trigger.
You have to know how the world
works. How people think. You got
to learn to be psychological.
That I cannot teach you, unless
you learn the basics at school.
Got it?
Cat glares at him.
EMILIO
Now what's it going to be?
He holds out the gun in one hand, and the schoolbag in the
other. Cat hesitates for a moment. Takes the schoolbag
from Emilio. Then takes his hand, and they walk off
together as police sirens announce the arrival of cruisers,
and people pour out of the school and the surrounding
stores. As they put distance between the chaos and
themselves.
CAT
But I still want to be a killer.
EMILIO
(SIGHING)
Cabron!
FADE TO BLACK
12 YEARS LATER
A sleepy California town on the way to nowhere.
PAN DOWN TO
A police cruiser sits on a quiet street, right off a wider
avenue. Main street. There is no traffic either way.
The nose of the cop car juts out just off the street.
Three black SUV's, with blacked out windows, come rolling
up to the station. The doors open and a dozen U.S. MARSHALS
jump out. Vigilant, forming a cordon around one of the
vehicles, out of which comes a hand cuffed, kevlar wearing
hard as nails MAFIA type. GENNARO RIZZO.
The Marshal's surround him, guns bristling, on the look
out for any danger, and hustle him towards the doors of
the police station.
BAMBAMBAMBAM!!!!
Two patrols of two Marshal's each hear the shots.
Cat comes climbing out of a ventilation duct onto the roof.
She looks out over the side of the building. Marshal's
stationed outside are running into the building.
Cat takes off running.
Cat is running as fast as she can.
Cat reaches another air vent, so about to pry it off when
she hears...
46.
Cat hears the door begin to open. She bangs her high heels
together. And two blades come out of the front. She sees
the door knob turning. She runs for the roof's edge.
AND VAULTS OVER THE SIDE!
The cops pour onto the roof, looking around, guns drawn.
ANGLE ON CAT ON THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING
Clinging to the wall like a gekko. The dun colored wall
blending with her dun colored suit. How is she doing this?
CLOSE ON CAT'S SHOES
The blades fitted into the seam between the bricks. Her
fingertips clinging to the small lip on the bottom of the
roof's edge.
ABOVE HER
The cops look around the roof.
ON CAT
She holds there listening to the noise above. Hears noise
below, looks down to see...
Cops searching the alley below.
ON CAT
Hanging to the edge of the building. Listening, watching.
The cops, finding nothing, head back out the door. A moment
later...
CLOSE ON THE ROOF LEDGE
Cat's hand reaches up.
ON CAT
47.
When one hand has a firm grasp on the roof ledge, she lets
go with the other hand and grasps the ledge, extracts the
blades from the brick seams, and swings herself up on the
roof. As her shoes dislodge, some mortar comes loose and
falls below.
ON THE COPS BELOW
The crumbling mortar falls on the head of one cop, he looks
down, sees the crumbly gravel, looks up, sees nothing.
Cat lands on the roof, lays still.
ON THE COP BELOW
He examines the gravel, looks up again. And then moves
on.
Cat pries the vent cover off, slips in.
An ambulance pulls up, along with the Marshal contingent
in their SUV's. The Marshal's spill out of the SUV's as a
gurney with a corpse is wheeled into the morgue.
The door of a small jet opens and MARCUS ROSS, 48, a keen
eyed, no nonsense all business FBI agent, followed by a
team of similarly focused men and women, exits down the
stairs to...
MARSHAL
Agent Ross?
ROSS
Where is he?
MARSHAL
At the hospital.
ROSS
Let's go.
Reporters are gathered, trying to gain access. The police
are keeping them out.
Ross exits the SUV to the crowd of reporters.
REPORTERS
Is it Rizzo? Was it an
assassination? Are there any clues?
Is it true a Marshal did it?
ROSS
No comment.
Ross sees cops coming and going from the station. He turns
to the Marshal with him.
ROSS
You didn't lock it down?
MARSHAL
It was after the fact. I didn't
think...
Ross cannot believe what he is hearing.
ROSS
Do it. Now. No one in or out.
ANGLE ON CAT
Exiting the station. Ross and his team sweep past her.
MARSHAL
OK! That's it. No one in or out!
Lock down!
Cat just keeps walking, right past Ross, who heads into
the station as the cops try to keep the reporters at bay.
ANGLE ON CAT
Walking away from the pandemonium she is leaving behind.
As it recedes over her shoulder, she picks at her fingers
where the fingerprinting ink has stained them. Her prints
come off! She drops the fake prints down a sewer and keeps
walking.
A Lincoln town car comes down the leafy, quiet street of
well kept homes. Stops at a gate guarded by two men, who
wave him through.
The car ends up in front of a very impressive house, which
sits at the end of a long driveway. Toward the era of the
walled property, a garage, and a guest house. MR. RICHARD,
in a suit and tie, looking like a proper mid level
government official, or a lawyer, exits, newspaper in hand.
As he approaches the front door, Richard looks over to see
two more guards, off to the side. He nods to them, knows
them. They nod back.
Richard approaches the front door, knocks. While he is
waiting, he looks down at the paper.
The door opens.
MARCO
Mr. Richard...
Richard looks up to a fifteen year older Marco.
MARCO
Been a long time.
RICHARD
Yes it has Marco. How's the hand?
Marco holds up his scarred hand.
MARCO
Only hurts when it's humid.
RICHARD
Should've let us relocate you to
Arizona instead of New Orleans.
MARCO
The Boss likes it humid.
RICHARD
There it is then.
MARCO
He's waiting for you.
Richard enters. The door closes.
Richard walks to his car, observed by...
The total full on crush of people that a major metropolitan
bus terminal holds. She sees a surveillance camera tucked
in a corner. She pulls the brim of her hat low over her
eyes, takes off into the crowd.
Cat comes to a non descript high rise. She enters.
An elevator train rumbles by above.
PAN DOWN TO
A car parking. And DANNY DELANEY, preoccupied, a pleasant,
easy going, good looker at 28, closes the door, and walks
to the entrance of his low slung apartment building. He
enters.
Emilio walks down the stairs, carrying a shopping bag.
TRACK WITH HIM ALONG THE STREET. Until he comes to a
Laundromat.
A ramshackle warehouse, it's windows streaked opaque with
years of dust and grime, surrounded by a fence, and a weedy
garden which is home to dozens of the most unique wind
chimes of all sizes and shapes, made from scrap metal.
And two of the biggest, most ferocious dogs on Earth, laying
on their sides, asleep.
The dog's ears perk up; hearing something we don't, a low
growl begins to rumble deep in their throats. The gate to
the garden begins to open, and like a shot the dogs are
up, hurling themselves toward the opening gate, eyes
flashing, barking loud enough to scare the dead back to
life, fangs bared, ready to kill.
And then they stop cold when they see who it is coming
into their domain.
REVERSE ON CAT
Holding two very full shopping bags.
CAT
Hi guys.
And the dogs jump all over her, licking her.
CAT
Hey! Hey!
She pets them, plays with them.
CAT
OK. OK. Now sit.
65.
The dogs obey her in a heartbeat, sitting expectantly.
Not making a sound.
CAT
Now let's see what good boys you
can be.
She reaches into one of the shopping bags, pulls out two
roasts!
CAT
Top cut sirloin.
Which she puts down on the ground. The dog's eyes go to
the chunks of meat.
CAT
Nice, huh?
The dogs can barely contain themselves.
CAT
Red, juicy, delicious.
The dogs whimper in anticipation.
CAT
Stay.
She picks up the shopping bags, and heads for the ramshackle
warehouse. The dogs moan, but do not move, their eyes
going from the meat to Cat.
Cat reaches the door. Turns. Sees the dogs looking at
her.
CAT
Good boys.
(BEAT)
Eat.
The dogs pounce. Each one grabs a roast and tears into
the meat with ferocious, pent up glee. Cat smiles at the
sight, enters the warehouse.
From the air, surrounded by the bluest of waters. Bestowed
with the greenest of verdant foliage. Surrounded by
exquisite beaches.
A spray of water fills the screen. Comes from...
THREE OF THE HOTTEST NYMPHETTES IN THE SMALLEST BIKINIS
SPLASHING AROUND A SWIMMING POOL HAVING THE BEST TIME
SPLASHING WATER AT WILLIAM WOOGARD, AS HE CHASES AFTER
THEM...
WILLIAM
GRRRAAAHHHH!!!!
PULL BACK TO
An exquisite villa surrounded by a high wall. As the girls
clamber out of the pool, ignoring the four armed body guards
patrolling poolside, they are met by three maids holding
robes for them to slip into.
WILLIAM
(SMILING)
Hey! I pay to see more, not less.
The robes disappear.
WILLIAM
That's better.
GIRL
Willie you are such a perv.
WILLIAM
I know. Anyone hungry?
GIRL
Always!
As William slips into a robe held open for him, he grabs
the asses of two of the girls...
WILLIAM
Lunch is served.
Giggling, the girls scamper toward the villa, where a
sumptuous table is set on the veranda, attended by more
servants. William is handed a drink, as he sips it, watches
their perfect, barely covered butts, his eyes pools of
desire, the servant holds out an envelope.
SERVANT
For you sir.
69.
Perplexed, William takes his eyes off the girls and regards
the envelope. No return address, no stamps. He opens it,
and his perplexed look goes to one of concern.
CLOSE ON THE NOTE
It says. SOMEONE IS LOOKING FOR YOU. BE CAREFUL. A
FRIEND.
WILLIAM
Where did this come from?
SERVANT
It was in the post box this morning.
William cannot fathom what this is all about. But he does
not like it.
Over hot dance hall music, the sun sets magnificently into
the shimmering sea...
A van rolls up to the main gate, half a dozen security men
exit.
HEAD SECURITY
There are already guys in the garden
and guys out back. I want you
three upstairs, two on the roof.
You three downstairs. Follow me.
As they all enter the villa, the CAMERA lingers on the
van. A figure dressed in black rolls out from under the
carriage as it pulls away and disappears into the bushes.
QUICK TIME CUTS
Two guards stand outside the bedroom door. Two guards are
on the stairs. Three guards in the salon. Three more in
the garden outside.
A plane lands.
Marco and his thugs enter a small social club/bar.
Danny opens the door to his building.
The city wakes.
CLOSE ON DANNY
Waking. Turning over, expecting to find no one there.
Surprise this time. Because there is someone there,
sleeping peacefully, her face, half covered by her hair,
bathed in the soft light of dawn...
82.
Cat.
Danny smiles, so pleased.
Cat comes running in.
Danny is sitting with his friend RYAN.
DANNY
Great body, killer smile.
(BEAT)
And I think about her all day long.
RYAN
Dude, you're in love.
DANNY
You're so smart.
RYAN
Seriously. This comes from the
heart. OK?
(BEAT)
You're nuts.
(BEAT)
The girl comes over, strips down,
rocks your world, gets dressed,
asks for nothing. Leaves. The
only thing she doesn't do is bring
the pizza and beer. You are living
my dream. And you want to go and
fuck it up with love?
DANNY
I knew you were the perfect guy to
talk about this with.
RYAN
Hey come on. It's me. Since first
grade. You and me?
He crosses his fingers.
DANNY
Ryan, I'm twenty eight. I met
someone who I want to be with.
All the time. I have nothing. A
stuffed animal.
(BEAT)
And a picture.
RYAN
You have a picture?
DANNY
In my phone.
86.
RYAN
Give it up!
Danny takes out his iPhone.
DANNY
It's not even a whole picture. I
took it while she was asleep.
Shows Ryan the picture he took of Cat.
CLOSE ON THE PICTURE OF CAT
Asleep in his bed, with the morning light on her face,
half hidden by her position and her hair.
RYAN
Whoa...total babe-age! When do I
meet the future Mrs. Delaney?
DANNY
Haven't you been listening to me?
I don't even know how to get in
touch with her.
RYAN
Dude. That is such a no brainer.
As everyone is exiting...
88.
MAMA
Cara. You will come home for lunch.
CAT
No Mama. One thing at a time.
She kisses them and walks off.
AGENT 1
Nothing here.
A normal day. Kids playing ball. Trashmen picking up
trash.
ANGLE ON THE REAR OF EMILIO'S HOUSE
Cat enters the house.
Cat is on a pay phone.
CAT
I'd like to speak to the agent in
charge of the TAG killings.
Cat hangs up the phone.
The building is emptying out. In the lobby, Ross passes a
floor cleaner and a lone security guard.
Ross enters his building.
A non descript building.
The truck heads off down the road, disappearing into the
night.
FADE TO
SMITH, a courtly old architect, opens his door and enters
his building.
The house sits prominent in the middle of a quiet
neighborhood.
The fourth thug runs for all he is worth, bleeding from
his forehead, panicked.
ANGLE ON CAT
Calmly exiting the garage, she removes a set of throwing
knives from a belt around her waist, taking a long minute
to gauge the distance. When he has almost reached the
safety of the house...
ON THE THUG RUNNING
ON CAT FLINGING THE KNIVES
TRACK WITH THE KNIVES AND THEN...
ON THE THUG
He drops like dead lead, the two knives embedded in his
back.
ANGLE ON MARCO WITH DON LUIS
Inside the house, seeing Cat through a window.
ANGLE ON CAT
Looking back at him. Pointing a finger at him. Before
she disappears in to the drifting mists.
ANGLE ON
MARCO
Don Luis! You hide here.
He opens a secret door in the wall, revealing a small space.
Barely big enough for a man.
MARCO
Wait for my call. Either she is
dead, or we have her far enough
away so you can make it to the
garage. Take the van. The armor
is so thick nothing short of an
atomic bomb can penetrate it.
DON LUIS
Marco. Thank you.
108.
MARCO
(TOUCHED)
That's the first time you ever
said that.
DON LUIS
Said what?
MARCO
Thank you.
DON LUIS
Don't get used to it.
Don Luis shuts the door. Off the door slamming...
Another door opens, but this one is...
On the side of the mansion, and leads into the foundation.
Cat crawls in and pulls the door shut.
The thugs set up two big ass 50 caliber machine guns at
the two openings in the foundation.
MARCO
Kill her!
The thugs manning the guns let loose, blasting away. Smoke
and flashes from the muzzles mingle with the fog.
The thugs fire until their ammo is spent. As the sound
dies away, silence reigns.
Marco's phone rings.
MARCO
(WHISPERS)
Checking.
He motions for one of his men to look into the dark hope.
Hesitant the man peeks around the side. Nothing happens.
MARCO
(WHISPERS)
I think we got her.
110.
Marco urges his man to look deeper, expose himself more,
to look in the hole. Marco watches as the man does so,
very cautiously. Still no movement. He moves full body
into the opening to peer in.
BANG! BANG! BANG!
Is blown back by three fast shots.
MARCO
(INTO PHONE)
Stay where you are!
And then he starts screaming into the hole, careful to
stand just off to the side.
MARCO
You know what bitch? I loved
killing your father. He was a
coward! And you know what else?
I screwed your mother behind your
father's back! We all did! She
couldn't get enough of it! The
whore! I killed her! I killed
him! You want to avenge them?
The whore and the coward? That's
what you come from! Come out!
I'm here! Come get the bullet
with your name on it, Bitch!
Silence. And then, a whistle from above. Marco looks up
to see Cat, standing on a second floor balcony with two
pistols.
MARCO
Kill her!
Marco starts to fire, his men raise their guns. Too late.
In the blink of an eye, with bullets flying wildly all
around her, Cat blows five of the seven thugs surrounding
Marco away. Marco and the remaining two thugs run toward
the guest house. Out of the range of her guns.
111.
Gripped by fear, Don Luis runs for all he is worth across
the fog shrouded garden until he reaches the garage. He
yanks open the door, runs inside.
The van comes roaring out of the garage, tearing up the
gardens, jumping on the driveway and speeding off to the
main road.
Cat comes running from the opposite direction, two guns
blazing.
Cat reaches the end of the driveway, fires her last shots,
runs out of bullets. Stands watching the van head off
down the road.
Cat stands in the road, watching the van. She takes out
Marco's cellphone.
CLOSE ON THE SCREEN
Cat scrolls the phone book. She highlights VAN. Presses
SEND.
Cat hears the growl over the phone. A small smile breaks
across her face. And then se speaks into the phone one
last time. One word.
CAT
EAT!
Over the sounds of the dogs tearing Don Luis to pieces and
his horrible screams, the van shakes as if it were caught
in an earthquake.
Cat's shoulders sag, relax. Her face is peaceful as it
has never been before. She looks at Marco's phone.
Thinking.
ROSS V.O.
I want you to think hard...
Ross is drawing coffee.
AGENT 1
Ross. We're picking something up
off that kid's phone.
Ross drops the coffee, hurries back to the office.
Cat, in jeans, t-shirt, a baseball cap with her pony tail
sticking out the back, exits a phone booth, She boards a
waiting bus. The doors close. The bus drives off down an
endless road.
117.
