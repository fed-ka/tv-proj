        A FISTstrikes out toward us. And a man s nose SPLINTERS
      beneath it.

      The atavistic roar of a crowd greets us as two BARE-KNUCKLE 
      FIGHTERS in a makeshift ring withdraw and circle each other.

      One of them - BENNETDRAKE (early 40s), grins for his 
      opponent. Tight on his fist as he inspects it. Withdraws a 
      fragment of bone that s lodged in the fleshy webbing. Tosses 
      it back to his OPPONENT --

                                    DRAKE
                      Yours, shitspade.

      And he launches another left right combination. Enough for 
      his OPPONENT to seek time out. He deliberately drops to a 
      knee. 

      Check DRAKE out - a huge bear of a man. A couple of TATTOOS
      on his bicep:Sergeants stripes; and a snake coiled about it, 
      eating its own tail.

      Boos ring out. SECONDS move in to their men, soap and water 
      them. An UMPIRE jumps in. Moves to the centre of the ring and 
      with a piece of chalk draws a yard length s square. A number 
      3 beside it.

      THE CROWD - booming out a count. Thirty downwards. Take them 
      all in. A seething, bawling maelstrom. All creeds, all 
      classes. Stevedores and traders; a few blacks; Lascars, 
      Chinamen, Micks. And the Upper Crust too, easily spotted in 
      their evening dress. All as one in their blood lust --

                                    CROWD
                      ...27, 26, 25....

      Find HOBBS now. Pushing through, his eyes desperately 
      scanning them all, and finding who he seeks now. This man, 
      stood the opposite side of the warehouse --

      Flinty, piercing eyes, handsomely moustached. This is REID 
      (late 30s), and he s not counting. He s lent against a 
      pillar, conferring and drinking with another man - JOSEPH 
      SMEATON (40s), wily, weasel eyes. Both have a dolled-up TART 
      draped around them.

      SMEATON - watching the boxer DRAKE. Waiting for the count - 
      and despite his heaviness - he dances nimbly from foot to 
      foot. 

                                    SMEATON
                          (above the clamour)
                    He s tasty alright.

                                    SMEATON (cont'd)
                          (beat)
                    Where d youfind him?

                                    REID
                      I looked. Wasn t hard. 

      REID - pulling his TART closer, a hand beneath her bustle --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                      Fighters; whores... flesh is what 
                    you seek, there s no shortage in 
                    these parts.

      SMEATON grins for that. Likes REID S style, as --

                                    CROWD
                    ... 4, 3, 2, 1 ...

      And another almighty roar as the two fighters move to the 
      edge of that chalk square and are joined again. DRAKE - easy, 
      dancing about his quarry, more wounding jabs lashing out.

                                    SMEATON
                          (of DRAKE)
                    He s no shame, then? Does as he s 
                    bid?

                                    REID
                      Money s right, he ll give you his 
                      sister and his mother too.

      Which is the right answer. SMEATON smiles - until he finds 
      himself jostled, his drink spilt. He reacts, quick to 
      violence, an ugly shiv in his hand, held now in the face of 
      HOBBS. 

      HOBBS - it was a gambit, but he wasn t expecting this. He 
      holds his hand up --

                                    SMEATON
                      Streak of piss - I ve gutted 
                      younger for less.

      REID - his expression inscrutable, his eyes meeting HOBBS . 
      And he acts --

                                    REID
                          (to SMEATON)
                    Let me.

      A rabbit punch to HOBBS  throat. The lad gags, collapses to 
      his knees. SMEATON - his regard for this man growing ever 
      more. Watches as REID catches HOBBS, drags him to the wall, 
      pins him to it.

      REID - in the boy s face - an inscrutable look.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/126.


                                    REID (CONT D)
                            (vicious; whispered)
                    This had better be good.

      HOBBS - a desperate nod, managing to get the words out --

                                    HOBBS
                      They ve found a tart. Up on 
                      Folgate. 
                          (a beat)
                    She s been ripped, Inspector.

      REID - his eyes, the shock of this, the worst possible news. 


      A bed, the softest of furnishings, thick, luxurious drapes, 
      low lights. The perfect scene for the carnal delights taking 
      place within.

      A tangle of quilt and sheets and limbs, and a young woman s 
      face. Flushed porcelain cheeks, green eyes, thick red hair. 
      This is ROSE. Perhaps 23, she is raised on her elbows, 
      looking down, a look of delighted disbelief on her face --

                                    ROSE
                      Captain Jackson. This is all topsy-
                      turvy, I m sure.

      Smiling back at her - a man. Moustached, a wasted elegance 
      and infectious charm. CAPTAIN HOMER JACKSON (late 30s), the 
      American in question. About his neck - a chain. On the chain: 
      rabbits paw, Indian feather, and a fat, gold, four-cornered 
      and rubiedfraternity ring  --

                                    JACKSON
                    Rose. Darling. There s no rules 
                    here. Haven t I told you that?

      And he slings the chain behind him and throws her skirts up 
      over her giggling face. 


      Another woman - sliding a peephole shut. She steps away from 
      it and turns toward us, irked by what she s seen. She is 
      handsome, blonde, early 30s, well dressed. This is LONG 
      SUSAN, and this is her brothel. It s nice, though. Draped, 
      brocaded; beautiful YOUNG WOMEN shown off by gentle lighting. 
      A world away from the broken tenements we saw in the opening 
      sequence.

      She stalks away down the corridor. Stops now to the sound of 
        a disturbance below. From a balcony, she sees: REID - pushing 
      through the entrance. Which does little to improve her mood --

                                    LONG SUSAN
                    Sweet Jesus.


      REID - looking up as LONG SUSAN stalks down the stairway 
      toward him --

                                    LONG SUSAN
                    You cannot simply intrude here any 
                    time of your choosing...                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1212.


                                    REID
                          (across her)
                    That this house thrives - and that 
                    your girls aren t walking the 
                      streets this night - is at my whim 
                    and indulgence, Madam. Don t forget 
                    that.
                          (then)
                    Where is he?

      SUSAN - she resents the truth of that. Finds a shrug --

                                    LONG SUSAN
                    Why should I care? It s not as if 
                    he ever pays...


      ROSE - her bottom lip held between her teeth, transported. 
      Disturbed now by this sudden banging on the door --

                                    ROSE
                            (shouts)
                      What!? He s taken me for the night!

                                    REID (O.S.)
                      Jackson!

      JACKSON - his face emerging, his eyes closing --

                                    JACKSON
                            (shouting)
                    Reid? I m occupied. I ll come see 
                    you in the morning.

                                    REID (O.S.)
                    Can t wait. I need a surgeon.

      JACKSON - off the bed in his britches, covers a crestfallen 
      ROSE with a quilt, thrusts his pendant back inside his shirt. 
      And opens the door to reveal REID. A direct look between the 
      two of them --

                                    JACKSON
                    You have your own.

                                    REID
                      They re drunks and incompetents. I 
                    want you.

                                    JACKSON
                    Five minutes.

      And he moves to shut the door. Can t. Because REID S foot is 
      in the way --

                                    REID
                    Now.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1213.



      Night shift. A barely contained anarchy. COPPERS, their 
      COLLARS, DRUNKS, the HOMELESS. And JACKSON, a leather satchel 
      over his shoulder, following REID though --

      On they go, heads down, REID leading the way past an imposing 
      DOCK at which the booking Sergeant, ARTHERTON - huge black 
      ledger in front of him, sits surveying the chaos.


      Reid unlocks a gate, shows JACKSON through a humming Outer 
      Office - desks and more COPS and DETECTIVES talking, 
      drinking, interviewing SUSPECTS, in the shadow of a wall-to-
      wall CASE BOARD. A blackboard divided in columns, wheeled 
      step ladders beneath. At the far left in bold chalk capitals, 
      the word RIPPER, the various KILLINGS detailed below.

      Jackson - wide-eyed for this. But Reid isn t waiting for him. 
      Pushes on through. 


      A large cork-board. A map of the precinct. Red spots mark the  
        whereabouts of these 5 crimes --

        Photographs: a number of them. Several original police 
        photographs of these five dead women.

      And Jackson - watching Reid as he unpins a handful of these. 
      Marches away with them.


      First an open quadrangle of holding cells and drunk tanks, 
      groaning with arrested and restless humanity, then a long 
      corridor of several isolation cells. 

      On the last door on the left, REID raps three times and the 
      door opens to reveal DRAKE. JACKSON and REID step through. 
      Shut the door behind them.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1214.



      Reid - turning this wall into a makeshift gallery of these 
      previous SCENE OF CRIME PHOTOGRAPHS. Turning to the dead and 
      disfigured woman laid out on an oak table. 

      JACKSON - looking at Reid. The gravity of what might be laid 
      out before them --

                                    JACKSON
                    Is it him?

      Reid - a long beat, his grim fear, but --

                                    REID
                      That s what you re here to find 
                    out.

                                    JACKSON
                    And your sudden passion for the 
                      furtive?

                                    REID
                      I must be sure before that hell 
                    rises again.

      JACKSON - a nod. Understands the grave severity of this. 
      Takes his coat off, opens his satchel, removes a battered 
      wooden box. The box - glimpse the faded engraving on its lid: 
      UNITED STATES ARMY. And inside - the tools of an autopsy kit.

                                    JACKSON
                    Get her naked, Sergeant Drake.

      DRAKE - not sure he likes Jackson s tone, but REID nods to 
      him and he moves to the body.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                          (sharp)
                      Gently. Are those hands or 
                      meathooks?
                          (beat)
                      Really. It s no wonder to me at all 
                      you re a bachelor.

      DRAKE - a special kind of hatred for this man.


      The body - naked, its wounds washed. JACKSON and REID in 
      their shirtsleeves, poring over it. The slash across the 
      throat. Jackson looks to Reid. Every fact an escalator to 
      their worst of fears --

                                    JACKSON
                    The hemorrhage is from the 
                      severance of the left carotid.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1215.


                                    REID
                    The stroke left to right.

                                    DRAKE
                    Like the others.

      The carvings in her face --

                                    JACKSON
                      Stars, aren t they? And this - her 
                      eyelids slit apart...

                                    REID
                          (as the grave)
                      Catherine Eddowesand Mary Jane 
                    Kelly had the same.

                                    DRAKE
                    And the writing on the wall? Like 
                        GoulstonStreet the night we found 
                    Miss Eddowes apron. The same words 
                    as was in that letter...

      JACKSON - moving down the rest of her body. Her thighs. 
      Pushing them gently apart. Finds some kind of SMUDGING on 
      white flesh. Moves back to his satchel, produces a petri 
      dish.

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    What is it?

                                    JACKSON
                    Some kind of gelatin.

                                    REID
                    What kind?

      JACKSON gives him a look for that. 

                                    JACKSON
                    From a meat pie.
                          (then)
                    How am I to know yet?
                          (beat)
                    Don t you have evidence to collect?

      REID - a nod. Goes for his coat.

                                    REID
                          (to JACKSON)
                    Do what you do.
                          (to DRAKE)
                      I know it s tempting, but try not 
                    to kill him.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1216.



      REID - on the move back through the chaos of reception. 
      Heading for the doors, as --

                                    ARTHERTON
                    Mr. Reid, sir.

      REID - turning. Seeing the wiry, bespectacled form of his 
      Desk Sergeant. Going to him.

                                    ARTHERTON (CONT D)
                    I m hearing strange rumours.

                                    REID
                    Oh yes.

                                    ARTHERTON
                    Mmm. That there s an unregistered 
                      female on the premises.

      REID - casting a look about him. Various WHORESlaughing in a 
      corner.

                                    REID
                      Always an abundance of those, 
                      Sergeant.

      ARTHERTON - a thin smile --

                                    ARTHERTON
                    I m not here to judge you, sir. 
                    Just to remind you of our 
                      obligations under the law.

                                    REID
                    And I thank you for that, 
                      Artherton. Always.


      Barely anything to suggest this is home. A camp-bed; two-ring 
      stove. A filthy sink in which the man might occasionally wash 
      his face.

      What life is lived here is devoted to work. Shelves and 
      chemicals and lenses and apparatuses.                         Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1217.


      And Creighton - bent over his fixing solution, images 
      appearing on photographic paper. 

      Reid - watching. He picks up a dry plate. Touches his fingers 
      to the edges. Rubs the GELATIN SOLUTION that emerges from it 
      between his fingers. Puts the plate back, wipes his hand on 
      his trouser leg.

      CREIGHTON - handing a couple of images to REID. The DEAD 
      WOMAN S face, that message on the wall, the cobblestones. 

      REID grabs for a magnifying glass, studies one in particular. 
      The way dirt and dust and leaves have been divided and pushed 
      apart --

                                    REID
                    This one - which side of the 
                      courtyard?

                                    CREIGHTON
                            (checks)
                      North.

                                    REID
                    He brought her in through the 
                      alleyway.

      CREIGHTON - it makes no bones to him. He presses on. Moves 
      steadily through a rack of photographic plates. Hands a few 
      more similar prints to REID. Stops after a while.

      REID points to a few more plates --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    And those.

                                    CREIGHTON
                        I over-exposed them.

      REID - his eyes, studying the man --

                                    REID
                    Worth our while to check, 
                      however...

      A curt nod from CREIGHTON. He takes the plates to the 
      solution, immerses them. Silence for a long beat as he washes 
      the plates. And feels REID very close behind him now --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    Do you think me some bone-headed 
                      flatfoot?

      He takes CREIGHTON S arm. Pushes him aside.

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    They need to come out.
                          (a beat)
                                    (MORE)                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1218.

                                  REID (CONT D) 
                      Professional man like yourself. I 
                    would have thought you d know 
                      better.

      REID - taking over, fixing the image himself now. CREIGHTON - 
      watching, his calm evaporating as REID watches the image take 
      shape. Grabbing for another of the earlier prints. Two images 
      of the corpse in the alleyway. Key differences between the 
      two photographs, though. One has that graffiti on the wall; 
      the other does not. 

      REID - a cocktail of fury at the deception and hope at what 
      that might mean. Thrusts a photograph at CREIGHTON -- 

                                    REID (CONT D)
                      Where s the message? The writing on 
                    the wall, Creighton... Down On 
                      Whores.
                          (that steel)
                    Was it you painted it up there?

      CREIGHTON - a direct look for REID --

                                    CREIGHTON
                    You know who it was.

                                    REID
                    Best.

                                    CREIGHTON
                            (confirms it)
                      I just record what I see.

      Reid - one last look for him and he s gone.

          OMITTED1/22-23A1/22-23A


      FRED BEST - a vivid red waistcoat today. Ever jaunty, pushing 
      through the humming life of these newspaper offices. Heads 
      into an office - the words  Chief Reporter  carved into it, 
      kicks the door shut behind him and - before he knows what s 
      happened - feels his jacket pulled down, used to pinion his 
      arms by his side --

                                    REID (O.S.)
                    How do you think they felt, those 
                      girls, the moment they knew that 
                    was it - that breathing this air 
                    was up?

      BEST - being slowly turned about to face the walls of his 
      office. Framed copies of his front-page by-lines on the 
      various Ripper murders and The Star s own muck-raking 
      inquiries as to the perpetrator.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1219.


                                    REID (CONT D)
                    The later ones. They would have 
                    known what that lunatic intended 
                    for their bodies. Do you have a 
                    pity for them?

      He turns BEST - thrusts him toward a framed edition. The 
      drawing of a hunted looking man. The print screaming: John 
      Pizer. Is this the WhitechapelKiller?

                                    REID (CONT D)
                      A pity for the many men whose lives 
                    you have ruined with accusations?

                                    BEST
                          (a protest)
                      I have never accused. I have asked 
                      questions. Speculated!

      Another headline on the wall. The Star reporting that the 
      killer has written to the police, a copy of the latter where 
      he signs himself Jack The Ripper - that name, the vast bold 
      letters of the legend.

                                    REID
                          (off this)
                      Speculate. Well I speculate. About 
                    you, Best. About the hand that 
                      penned that letter. A letter I 
                    never credited as bonafide.
                          (beat)
                    And now this. 

      REID - taking CREIGHTON s prints of the crime scene. Showing 
      them to BEST. Then pushing the man hard into the wall; that 
      framed edition crashing to the floor by his feet. 

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    What else did you alter?

      BEST - sprung. Doesn t deny it. Eyes Reid directly. Smiles --

                                    BEST
                      Nothing. Didn t have to, did I? 
                    Just underlined what s plain to a 
                    man who s as intimate with the 
                      Ripper s doings as myself.

      REID - a look of contempt for this.

                                    BEST (CONT D)
                          (off this; sly)
                      Myself and Chief Inspector 
                      Abberline.

      Which gets just the urgent reaction BEST was hoping for --                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1220.


                                    REID
                      You ve spoke with Fred Abberline?

      BEST - straightening his waistcoat; knows the balance of 
      power here has been re-calibrated --

                                    BEST
                    Your boss as was. I have. And he 
                    finds himself in agreement with me. 
                    Our friend is back.

      REID - his cold eyes on BEST, he collects the print of the 
      writing on the wall,  DOWN ON WHORES , advances on the man. 
      BEST - a coward at heart, he is entirely intimidated --

                                    REID
                      Nothing s for certain. And I won t 
                    have people hiding in their homes 
                    again  til I get certain.
                          (beat)
                    I see this in print, I ll be back 
                    here for some ripping of my own.

      REID strides from the office, past all the assembled HACKS
      and ASSISTANTS wondering at the disturbance.

      BEST - coming after him, shouting across the office --

                                    BEST
                    Who d youthink you are, Reid? Come 
                    here to rattle me when you forget 
                    what I know of you...
                          (beat)
                    Do not fear good citizens, do not 
                      shake. For - sleepless, tireless - 
                      Detectives Reid and Abberline hunt 
                    our Jack down dockside and rookery. 
                    Two finer police the world has not 
                    yet made so be of good heart, this 
                      maniac will be brought to ground 
                    and hard.

      Reid - his face. Stopping. Hooded eyes turn back to Best.

                                    BEST
                    Only he wasn t, was he? The man and 
                    his works abide.
                          (beat)
                      Friday. Unless you have something 
                      provesit s another knifeman, this 
                    story turns over on Friday.

      REID - meeting the man s eye. Holding it. Then he s out the 
      door. And BEST - turning back to the newsroom --

                                    BEST (CONT D)
                    What are you lot gawking at!?                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1221.



      REID - deeply preoccupied, pushing in hard and head down as --

                                    ARTHERTON (O.S.)
                      Inspector...

      REID barely looks at the bespectacled Desk Sergeant.

                                    REID
                      I know, Artherton. It s taken care 
                    of.

                                    ARTHERTON
                    It s not that, sir...

                                    REID
                            (turning on him)
                    Then what?

      ARTHERTON - clear discomfort, eyebrows raised toward --

      The stooped and haggard form of CHIEF INSPECTOR FREDERICK 
      ABBERLINE (50s). He is not all that much older than REID, but 
      he wears his years, the stresses of his professional life, 
      with a weary and belligerent gloom.

                                    ARTHERTON
                    Our past come to say how-do.

      Reid - squaring his shoulders. Moving to the man --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    Chief Inspector Abberline of the 
                       Yard. What merits such a visit.

                                    ABBERLINE
                      Enough dancing, Detective. If 
                      there s a diced up girl in this 
                    shop, she s mine.


      Reid and Abberline - advancing through the inner tributaries 
      of the station. UNIFORMED MEN stand aside as they go. Watch 
      the deference observed for Abberline, as --

                                    ABBERLINE
                            (greeting them)
                      Watts. Cartwright.
                          (and)
                    My greetings to Margaret. And your 
                    boys, Ted.

      Reid - that fury. Makes a mental note to have both men drawn 
      across coals. Pushes on.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1222.



      DRAKE and JACKSON - looking up as the door is thrown open to 
      reveal REID and ABBERLINE -- 

                                    ABBERLINE
                    Out.

      DRAKE and JACKSON - their eyes flick to REID, who nods for 
      them to leave. ABBERLINE - a particularly filthy look for 
      JACKSON as they go. Turns his attention to the slab. This 
      naked, dead woman. Scar now running sternum to pubis.

                                    ABBERLINE (CONT D)
                    How could you do this?

                                    REID
                          (calm)
                    You have complaints, you direct 
                    them to Commissioner Monro. H 
                      Division is my shop now.

                                    ABBERLINE
                          (sudden violence)
                    And this is my case!


      DRAKE and JACKSON - waiting outside; looks exchanged at the 
      sudden outburst.


                                    REID
                          (still calm)
                      I know how it looks, Fred. 

      He shows him the photograph with the writing - DOWN ON WHORES
      - on the wall --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    But the graffito is Best s 
                      contrivance, and we...

                                    ABBERLINE
                          (across him; won t have 
                            it)
                    Look at her! Her eyes. The stars on 
                    her face. Her guts.

                                    REID
                    Her abdomen was opened fresh, right 
                    here, as part of the autopsy 
                      conducted by Homer Jackson.

      Another bark of outrage from ABBERLINE --                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1223.


                                    ABBERLINE
                    That Yankee clap-doctor!

                                    REID
                          (rising in defence)
                    The man was a US Army surgeon and a 
                      Pinkerton.


                                    ABBERLINE (CONT D)
                          (bitter now)
                    ... andyou place his word above 
                    mine.

      But Reid won t be shamed, shows him the body --

                                    REID
                      I think you d have her Ripper above 
                    all else. Another bite, another 
                      chance at him.

                                    ABBERLINE
                    And you would not?

                                    REID
                      I would have my innards served to 
                    me cold if I thought it would show 
                    him to us but, Fred - what if this 
                    girl has been dressed as Jack for 
                    our eyes and, in our fervour, we 
                    fill the streets with uniform 
                      hunting him and miss the truth of 
                    it? 

      Abberline - digesting this. Eyeing Reid --

                                    REID
                    Let me bring my mercenary back in 
                    and have him speak.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1224.



      ABBERLINE stands - stiff, disapproving. But he s listening --

                                    JACKSON
                    Fact he didn t open her up that 
                      strikes as strange. Their guts - 
                      that s always what he wanted the 
                    most. Open them up; see their 
                      viscera in his hands...

                                    ABBERLINE
                            (counters)
                    Then he got caught short; as he was 
                    with Elizabeth Stride. Herthroat 
                    was cut, the rest of her untouched.

      Reid - those photographs in his hands - the body; the 
      alleyway with and without the painted words --

                                    REID
                    But if he was disturbed with this 
                    one, he went back to her. Or hid 
                      beside her. But whichever, he 
                      waited some few hours before 
                      bringing her here. So long in fact 
                    that all blood had ceased to spill 
                    from her. See - the cuts about her 
                    face, the gash in the throat but no 
                    blood on the cobbles she was 
                      dragged across...

                                    JACKSON
                      I doubt there d have been much 
                    where they cut her either.

                                    ABBERLINE
                          (a bitter scoff)
                    When the woman s throat was cut!?

                                    JACKSON
                    The throat is a - post-mortem 
                      injury.

      Drake - following hard, trying to make sense of it --

                                    DRAKE
                    Then what did for her?

                                    JACKSON
                      Asphyxia. Her hyoid bone is broken. 

      Reid - a smile, a hope emerging --

                                    REID
                    She was strangled. And all else 
                    took place after.
                          (beat)
                                    (MORE)                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1225.

                                  REID (cont'd)
                    These stars and slits in her face - 
                    with Kelly and Eddowes, they were a 
                      postscript, an indulgence. 
                          (to Abberline)
                    This girl - they re top billing.

      ABBERLINE - the logic may be wearing him down, but this is 
      the obsession of his life and he s not going to give it up as 
      easy as all that. He has a long look for REID, then --

                                    ABBERLINE
                    This is theory. Not proof. 
                          (then)
                    Get proof. If you cannot, I ll pull 
                    rank and claim her.

      And with a curt nod for REID, he ignores the other two and 
      heads for the door.

      REID - watching him go. A sadness certainly. But the bit is 
      between his teeth now. He spins back to Jackson --

                                    REID
                    What else?

      Jackson - points out the photographs, the blank wall, the 
      writing Down On Whores--

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                      Whatever your friend Best s 
                      connivery, she had been serviced. 
                      Recently. And vigorously.

                                    DRAKE
                    So - she wasa tart?

                                    JACKSON
                      I reckon not. I make her no younger 
                    than twenty-eight, and her skin, 
                      nailbeds... the essential health of 
                    her - apparatus. By that age... 
                    even the more costly are - worn 
                      through. 

                                    REID
                    So, if she wasn t a professional...

                                    JACKSON
                    My guess - the lady taught fiddle.

      A scoffing hoot of disbelief from DRAKE. But JACKSON ignores 
      him, focusses on REID, who s intent, interested --

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    And she lived to the north. The new 
                      suburbs.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1226.


                                    DRAKE
                    Has the Pinkertonbeen conferring 
                    with spirits!?

                                    REID
                      Enough Sergeant.
                          (to JACKSON)
                    Go on.

      JACKSON - grateful for this, continues --

                                    JACKSON
                      Beneath her chin. See the moon-like 
                      impression in the clavicle. Her 
                      fingers. The skin toughened and 
                      puckered by strings.
                          (beat)
                    And her hair - there are heavy 
                      deposits in it. Soot.

                                    REID
                          (a smile)
                    From the underground railway.

      Jackson - shucking his coat on. Ready to go. Allows himself 
      this little moment of victory --

                                    JACKSON
                    Which arrives - Drake - from which 
                      direction?

      DRAKE - a bulldog who s swallowed a wasp.


      Jackson - on his way out the door as Reid barks his 
        instructions --

                                    REID
                      Finchley, Highgate, Crouch End - 
                      missing persons reports. There 
                    won t be too many lady violinists.

                                    DRAKE
                    Just a warning, sir. It may take 
                    some time.

      A sharp look from REID --

                                    DRAKE (CONT D)
                    The Type Printing Telegraphs that 
                    you ordered...

                                    REID
                    What of them? They re faster.

                                    DRAKE
                    So it s said, sir..                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1226A.


      Jackson - stopping at something. Turning back in and --

                                    JACKSON
                    Reid.

      Reid stops. Looks to him --

                                    JACKSON
                    You have a type-printer?

      Reid - a long look for him. Then jerks his head to follow.

        OMITTED1/33-341/33-34                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1227.



      The frankly terrified face of Constable Hobbs, his neck rigid 
      in a bright, white brace, sat at the only desk in this white, 
      pristine, silent space. A world away from the rest of the 
      station.

      On the desk and in front of Hobbs - a shiny, new Telegraph. 
      Entirely untouched.

                                    REID
                      Hobbs. You were instructed, were 
                    you not?

                                    HOBBS
                    Yes, Inspector.

                                    REID
                    Well?

                                    HOBBS
                    It s a bit of a handful, sir.

                                    REID
                          (a frustration)
                    It s the future!

      DRAKE - gentle, stepping in --

                                    DRAKE
                    The lad might come to terms with it 
                      sooner, sir, if you weren t stood 
                    so close.

      REID - acknowledging this. Steps back. To JACKSON who s 
      greatly entertained by all this --

                                    JACKSON
                    That, Reid, is the human barrier to 
                      progress.

      Reid - not so amused. But catches sight of something. The 
      sleeves of his coat. Dark ruby stains: dry blood.

                                    REID
                    I m home to change. 
                          (to Drake)
                    And you ll be needing rest too.

      Then - to JACKSON, a new thought --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                      Captain Jackson. The tonic you took 
                    from her thighs. Have you wondered 
                    if it might not be some kind of 
                      silver solution?                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1227A.


      Jackson - a smile, his own curiosity suddenly fired by the 
      question --

                                    JACKSON
                    From a peeper s dry plate?

      Reid - a nod confirms it.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1228.



      The source of those sounds: a man and a woman who have barely 
      bothered to undress. REID and a WOMANwe ve not met before. 
      She is younger than him, very pretty. His wife, EMILY.

      REID - his hands pressed down on her shoulders. Their eyes 
      fixed on the other. You wouldn t call it love-making. But it 
      is intense and it is consensual. Much passes between them.


      REID - exhausted, sat now on the edge of the bed --

                                    REID
                    I m home for a coat and shirt.

      EMILY - emerging from a bathroom. Gives him a look for that --

                                    EMILY
                    Not simply that.

                                    REID
                    No.

                                    EMILY
                          (matter of fact)
                    And now you go back.

                                    REID
                    It can t be helped.

      EMILY - a nod. Moves to a linen cupboard, opens it. Selects 
      from a pile of freshly pressed shirts. Hands one to him.

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    Thank you.

      REID - only now removing the one he s still wearing --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    I ll try to get word to you, if I m 
                    to be gone [all night]...

                                    EMILY
                          (across him)
                      There s no need, Edmund.

                                    REID
                      I don t want you to worry.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1229.


      And he throws the old shirt into a laundry basket, turns back 
      to her in his vest. 

      For us - the shocking and pitiful sight of his left shoulder. 
      TERRIBLE BURNS. Mottled scars stretch from his upper arm to 
      just beneath his neck. Emily, however, is unmoved --

                                    EMILY
                    And what is it you imagine I worry 
                      about?

      If there s an answer to that question Reid is not prepared to 
      offer it. Finds a weak smile for her. Turns from the room.


      REID - climbing another set of stairs, pushing into this 
      attic room. His bolt-hole. A day bed that is much slept in. A 
      lovingly constructed hot-air balloon swings from the ceiling. 
      Books and bookshelves everywhere. Contemporary science and 
        mathematics mainly. Posters advertising lectures at the Royal 
      Society - among them see a recent one: Edward Muybridge s - 
      Studies in Animal Locomotion. The images of a horse captured 
      in motion repeatedly; as if in flight.

      He moves to a mirrored cabinet. From within a bottle of some 
      kind of oil is produced. A portion poured into his right 
      hand, which - stood in front of his reflection - he proceeds 
      to massage the oil into the shoulder joint. A movement that 
      is practised and thorough.

      Then he s moving to some kind of (clearly self-constructed) 
      piece of MACHINERY that he has bolted to a wall.

      Reaches for a leather sling. Fits it about left elbow. 
        Drawstrings are tightened. A metal chain makes its way 
      through castors that are fitted to the wall and connected to 
      a rotor. REID turns this with his right hand and the chain 
      grasps. Ratchets his left arm up and away from his body.

      REID S eyes - dead ahead. His right hand - turning the rotor. 
      His left shoulder and arm - slowly extended to a normal - if 
      extreme - range of motion for most but for REID...

      He sweats. Resists the intense pain. Cannot. And screams.


      EMILY REID - combing mussed hair. Dressing herself after her 
      exertions. Her reflection in a glass as she stands - head to 
      foot in black now. Her mourning weeds. 

      Taking herself in as another scream rips through her home.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1230.



      A truly vacant space. The smallest of worker s cottages. A 
      kitchen, a bedroom, a small washing chamber. On the sideboard 
      - a solitary cup and plate washed and upturned.

      DRAKE - washed, in front of a mirror. The bruises and cuts 
      about his hands. Hands that turn to his uniform. A clothes-
      brush swept across it; brass buttons polished on his tunic; 
      black boots polished.

      These tasks somehow completed, he turns to a small table. On 
      it - a book. Check the title - Etiquette For The Modern 
      Gentleman. How Manners MakethThe Man.

      It s some kind of Victorian self-help manual. But DRAKE 
      clearly takes it very seriously. The book is well-thumbed, 
      sections underlined and ticked off.

      Then - from a pocket he s placing a couple of crowns inside a 
      small brass tin. Placing the tin back inside a bare cupboard.


      Small. A bed. A basin. An examining table and a sooty 
      overhead light. On the wall - a few entirely spurious and 
      florid medical qualifications. Various solutions in jars.

      And Jackson on his knees, pulling storage crates out from 
        underneath. Inside: various phials, all labelled - Dr. 
      Jackson s Topical Remedy. Not what he s looking for. Pushes 
      it aside. Reaches for another crate. Examines its contents --

                    Got you.


      The Type Printing Telegraph - clattering away. A strip of 
      paper sprouting from it. Hands ripping it off. Moving to the

      TIGHT ON: a few dog-eared photographs of women posed in their 
      underwear. And Jackson - starting - as Long Susan barges in.

                                    LONG SUSAN
                    What did he want?

                                    JACKSON
                      Weren t you taught to knock?

                                    LONG SUSAN
                    The day you pay rent, I ll knock. 
                    What did Reid want?
                          (then)
                    Is that maniac on the strut again?

                                    JACKSON
                    Who? Reid?

      Susan shoots him contempt for the lame joke.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1233.


                                    JACKSON
                          (off this)
                    Relax darlin . You need to start 
                      frisking men for knives again - 
                    I ll let you know.

      And he hands her the photographs --

                                    JACKSON
                    Now. Any of your girls get their 
                      picture taken?

      SUSAN - checking them --

                                    LONG SUSAN
                    Who s asking? 

                                    JACKSON
                            (shrugs; who does she 
                            think?)
                    Reid.

      Susan - her frustration at this --

                                    LONG SUSAN
                      Jackson - that man could ruin us.

                                    JACKSON
                    He wants my help. What am I to do? 

                                    LONG SUSAN
                    Tell him sorry, you re indisposed?

                                    JACKSON
                    Fine. But he ll ask himself why. 
                    And Reid - he asks himself a 
                      question, he s liable to look for 
                    the answer. He goes looking for an 
                      answer, he won t rest  til he gets 
                    one. You and me - we don t want 
                    that.

                                    LONG SUSAN
                          (hard)
                    Then stop lavishing your care and 
                      attention on him.

      JACKSON - undeterred, taking her elbow, pulling her hard 
      toward him --

                                    JACKSON
                      Coming here was your idea. You said 
                    it was the kind of lawless 
                      shitswarmwe could hide ourselves 
                    in and you were right. But darling - 
                    it s our kind of shitswarmand, in 
                    case you hadn t noticed, we re not 
                      hiding anymore. We live here.

                          (beat)
                    That man wants to make a friend of 
                    me, he s welcome.  Cause if he 
                    ain t a friend he s an enemy; and 
                    an enemy like that we do not need. 
                    So please - which of your girls has 
                      a leaning to smut?

      SUSAN - a long look for him, weighing this up. Then she heads 
      for the door, opens it and shouts --

                                    LONG SUSAN
                      Myrtle! Get Rose up here.


      Tight on a photograph, printed on a postcard. A set of them 
      and of significantly better quality than the previous. Hands 
      and thumb flick through the cards, creating a moving image of 
      sorts. Of ROSE - slowly undressing and disporting herself.

      JACKSON - looking up from the pictures. Looking at ROSE. 
      Who s brazen. Just looks at him right back. Cheeks him --

                                    ROSE
                    You can keep  em if you like.

                                    JACKSON
                      I may.
                          (beat)
                      Where dyou get these done, Rose?

      ROSE - looking to LONG SUSAN; who nods her approval.


      REID and DRAKE help THWAITES into a chair. Sit next to him as *
      the man drinks water, recovers. *

                                    REID*
                    Mr. Thwaites. Those men - did they  *
                    put you up there?

        A traumatised nod from THWAITES --*

                                    DRAKE*
                      Boarded a coach with some toff. *
                      Trimmed whiskers. Black Moustache.*

      THWAITES, unsure now. *                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1235.


                                    REID*
                    Doyou know him? The man Sergeant *
                    Drake describes?

      THWAITES - entirely at a loss. Puts his head in his hands. 
      Looks back up at the police now. His voice is weak --

                                    THWAITES
                    Were you here to talk about Maude? 
                    My wife?

      REID - on his feet, moving past a violin and music stand with 
      sheet music open on it. Takes from beside it a framed photo, 
      a very pretty woman in her late 20s--

                                    REID
                    Sir - you should prepare yourself.


      A Roman chariot. Upon it - A WARRIOR, helmet, spear in her 
      hand. Naked. A PHOTOGRAPHER takes her photograph.

                                    ROSE (O.S.)
                      Boadiccea. Queen of the Britons.

      ROSE - leading JACKSON through this large, light warehouse 
      space. The whole place hived off into perhaps ten different 
      units. One of which encloses the WARRIOR. 

      And next door - another YOUNG WOMAN. She s sprawled in a 
      chair with a three pronged hat, two pistols, her skirts 
      raised for another PHOTOGRAPHER.

                                    ROSE (CONT D)
                        Highway-Woman.

      JACKSON nods appreciatively. Casts around - sees more girls 
      and photographers in different units taking similar shots. 
      Everywhere - dry plates, gelatin solutions, flash guns.

      Along the way - a PORNOGRAPHER operating a new printing 
      press. Hundreds of those postcards being turned out from. He 
      sees JACKSON. Stops. Suspicious, until --

                                    ROSE (CONT D)
                      S alrightPerce. He s with me.
                          (cheek for JACKSON)
                      Thinking of joining up, aren t you?

      JACKSON gives her a smile for that. Turns back to the 
        PORNOGRAPHER. Offers him a cigarette. Lights them both up.

                                    JACKSON
                      Business good?                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1236.

                    Never better. These halftone 
                      copiers have changed the world for

                                    JACKSON
                      Imagine that, Rose - total 
                      strangers - from the North, 
                      feasting their eyes on you...

                                    ROSE
                    Sarah Bernhardtand I shall be one 
                    of a piece.

                                    JACKSON
                       Already are, Rose.

      Which she likes. Threads her arm through his as they walk on.


      REID and THWAITES - stopped outside this closed door.

                                    REID
                      Whatever the outcome here, it may 
                    be safer for you to remain with us 
                      a while, Mr. Thwaites.
                          (beat)
                    Until we find those men.

      THWAITES - an anguished nod. Then REID raps on the door. The 
      locks turn from within as DRAKE opens up from inside.


      THWAITES - his head turning toward the cadaver, her modesty 
      protected by a sheet. The ashen confirmation of what he 
      already suspected --

                                    THWAITES
                    Oh Maude.


      A pub - thick with smoke and talk and off-duty COPPERS. A 
      very masculine energy about the place, it s yards from HQ and 
      where our men come to DRINK. 

      Follow a BUSBOY. Two enormous CHOPS on tin-plates. A tin-pot 
      of beer, 2 glasses, unceremoniously dumped now in front of 
      REID and DRAKE. They set in --

                                    REID
                    We have her name. 

                                    DRAKE
                    We know how she was killed. 

                                    REID
                    And nothing else.

      Then - a disturbance. An alteration in the currents of the 
      room. The place quieting. Reid and Drake - looking up to see 
      many men and their suspicious eyes on --

      Jackson - perfectly unworried about this. Moving toward Reid 
      and Drake.

                                    DRAKE
                          (going back to his chop)
                    What does he want?

      Jackson - above them. Tossing on to the table his little 
      collection of porn cards. Rose disports herself in front of 
      them. Drake almost chokes on his lunch.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)(cont d)
                    Your lead, Inspector. Your notion 
                    about the dry plates...

                                    DRAKE
                      Disgusting.

                                    JACKSON
                      Disgustingly remunerative.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1237A.


      And he pulls up a chair. Sits.

                                    JACKSON
                      There s this too.

      And on to the table goes that over-exposed image. The bodies 
      together, the hand grasping flesh.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1238.


                                    JACKSON
                    It s more evolved...

      Reid - taking it in, and --


      The briefest of glimpses. Maude Thwaites and an unseen man - 
        FLASH-PHOTOGRAPHED in the grip of passion.


                                    REID
                    Was Maude Thwaites caught up with 
                    this?

      Drake - turning the image in his hands. Trying to figure out 
      just what it is he s looking at. And then he sees it. He goes 
      puce. Slams the image down on the table.

                                    JACKSON
                    Would fit.
                          (beat)
                    No streetwalker; but so recently 
                    and energetically squired...

      Reid - picking up those cards. Eyeing Jackson --

                                    REID
                    I am in your debt.

      Jackson - leaning back. Considering both men --

                                    JACKSON
                    You let me know which scratch Drake 
                    takes his fall in tonight - I ll 
                      consider it paid.

      Reid - the ghost of a smile at that.


      Beneath Reid s Ripper-wall sits CHRISTIAN THWAITES - his 
      recent tragedy and the attempt on his life heavy upon him. 
      But he looks at us now with an expression of entirely 
      startled offence --

                                    THWAITES
                      You ve no right to ask me this 
                      thing.

      REID - his stony features; DRAKE stood with him.

                                    REID
                      I fear we have every right, sir.
                          (beat)
                                    (MORE)                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1238A.

                                  REID (cont'd)
                    Your wife s body bears the signs of 
                      recent intimacy and I need to know 
                    if that intimacy was shared with 
                      yourself.

                                    THWAITES
                    Of course it was.

      But he can t meet REID S eye. Looks away.

                                    REID
                          (after a moment; gentle)
                    Mr. Thwaites - why do you think 
                    those men chose to string you up 
                    the way they did?                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1239.


                                    THWAITES
                    I ve told you - I have no idea who 
                    they were.

                                    REID
                    No. I mean - there was trouble 
                    taken to make it appear self-
                      slaughter. As if guilt or shame had 
                      driven you to it. In any event - 
                    they wanted your silence. But just 
                    what is it that they feared you 
                    might speak of? What shame Mr. 
                      Thwaites?

      REID - setting the pornographic cards of ROSE down in front 
      of THWAITES; that over-exposed image too --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    This shame? 

      THWAITES - a collapse taking place from within, a crumbling --

                                    REID
                    How far and how openly did your 
                    wife share her intimacy?

      Reid waits. Studies the man s pallor; everything broken 
      within. Still he waits. Until --

                                    THWAITES
                      Everything she did, she did for us. 
                    For me - so that my pride might not 
                    be ruined.
                          (he looks down)
                    When I found her - she lived near 
                    here. In Whitechapel. She played 
                    for the children of the orphanage 
                    on Criterion Street. From where I 
                    hoped to deliver her. My church 
                    group - we raise supplies for a 
                      number of poor schools in the 
                      borough. I loved her immediately. I 
                    took candied oranges for the 
                      orphans and left with a wife.
                          (beat)
                    My wife was not a prostitute, 
                      Inspector.

                                    DRAKE
                    No one has accused her of that, Mr. 
                      Thwaites.

                                    THWAITES
                          (across him; eyes on REID)
                      Before I married her, however... 
                    she confessed to a certain - 
                      practicality.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1240.


                                    REID
                    But then, as you say, you delivered 
                      her...

                                    THWAITES
                      I did. I promised her comfort and 
                      dignity; pupils to be taken in her 
                    own home. 

                                    DRAKE
                    And she deceived you.

      THWAITES - the most rueful of smiles --

                                    THWAITES
                    No Sergeant - the deception was 
                    mine.
                          (beat)
                    My employment was not as secure as 
                      I thought. I had no grounds to 
                      promise her those things.
                            (another beat)
                    Her home, even her violin - I 
                      mortgaged it all.

      REID - beginning to understand now --

                                    REID
                    So she returned here.
                          (beat)
                      Fortunate for you that she was so 
                      practical.

      THWAITES - he can t even bring himself to look at REID.

                                    DRAKE
                    Where did she go?

                                    THWAITES
                      I don t know.

                                    DRAKE
                    Who did she go to?

                                    THWAITES
                      I don t know.

                                    REID
                    Mr. Thwaites - Sergeant Drake 
                      fights London Prize Ring tonight. 
                    It s unwise to rile him.

      THWAITES just laughs at that --                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1241.


                                    THWAITES
                    Do you think you can hurt me? Here, 
                    now - when my most profound wish is 
                    that those men had succeeded in 
                    their task.
                          (beat)
                    Can t you see, Inspector, that I am 
                    the last person who would ever know 
                    about the things she did because as 
                    far as I was concerned it wasn t 
                      happening at all.

        OMITTED1/59-601/59-60


      REID and DRAKE - on the walk through Leman Street s humming 
      corridors. 

                                    DRAKE
                          (mid flow)
                      ...the shame is too much; he 
                      follows her. Kills her. 

                                    REID
                    He d need lodgings. Somewhere to do 
                    the work on her. 

      Reid - looking up at the Case Board. New upon it: MAUDE 
      THWAITES / MURDER; arrow and question mark leading to the 
      Ripper column.

      Reid takes a cloth. Rubs that arrow out. Turns back in to the 
      room. Finds Drake there --

                                    REID
                    Well, Sergeant. Fit and able?

                                    DRAKE
                    Yes sir.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1242.



      That seething, clamorousmass of men - once more baying on 
      their two men in the ring. DRAKE and a shorter, squatter BULL 
      of a man.

      DRAKE S reach and superior skill have opened up a fierce cut 
      above BULL S left eye. A gash that DRAKE is intent on working 
      on - his jab flying out, connecting. Blood spraying from the 
      wound into the laps of the SAILORS sat adjacent to the ring. 
      They scream their approval.

      BULL - a judicious time out. He drops to one knee. DRAKE 
      withdraws.

      In the crowd, find: JACKSON - sat on his own, smoking a 
      cheroot, enjoying himself; CONSTABLE HOBBS - lent against a 
      pillar, another PLAINCLOTHES by his side. He nods for another 
      two PLAINCLOTHES sat up in the bleachers, looking down - 
      perhaps four rows beneath them - to REID and JOSEPH SMEATON, 
      sat together, exchanging glances, readying themselves as --

      In the ring - the UMPIRE draws that chalk square, writes a 
      number 5 next to it --

                                    UMPIRE
                            (bellowing it out)
                    Five!

      DRAKE - preparing himself, dances from foot to foot, glances 
      out to the crowd, meets REID S eye. And turns back to his 
      opponent to see --

      The BULL S SECOND - helping his man into a new pair of shoes. 
      Sharp, evil RUNNER S SPIKES on the sole.

      The crowd - seeing this, word spreading. The audible rush of 
        excitement. REID - can t help himself; gets to his feet. But 
      SMEATON S got him. Pulls him back down --

                                    SMEATON
                    Prize Ring conditions still provide 
                    for  em.
                          (a laugh)
                      Besides - he don t have to deal 
                    with it too long now, does he?

      REID - having to sit. Hating it.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1243.


      DRAKE - in the ring, dancing as the BULL comes at him. He 
      jabs, dances away again, as his opponent kicks out at him.

      The clamourof the crowd: a particular knot of WELL-TO-DO 
      GENTS gathered in a shadowy recess. Champagne, a fog of cigar 
      smoke, clearing now to reveal a man we know --

      DONALDSON, the man Drake saw in the carriage. Drinking, 
      smoking, his dark eyes are intent on the action. Where --

      The BULL takes a swipe with his spikes. Opens up a cut on 
      DRAKE S thigh. DRAKE - the pain. And a fury. He ducks into 
      the BULL - unleashes savagery. Sends the man reeling.

      SMEATON - casting a worried look at REID, shouts --

                                    SMEATON (CONT D)
                      Thought you said he could be 
                      trusted!

      But REID S ignoring him. Focussed intently on the ring. Where 
      DRAKE is dancing away once more from the BULL S feet.  
      Spinning, his eye moving out to the crowd, where it alights 
      now on DONALDSON.

      For his part, DONALDSON has made no connection with the 
      fighter and the policeman who tore a door from his coach. He 
      drinks from the neck of a bottle of champagne.

      DRAKE - can t believe who he might have just seen. Scans the 
      crowds to find him again. Does so. DONALDSON - finding the 
      fighter staring at him, beginning to make the connection.

      The BULL - witnessing his opponent s distraction, his dropped 
      guard. He steps in with an UPPERCUT.

      DRAKE - his eyes still on DONALDSON as he feels his world 
      collapse and fold and BLACK OUT.


      Screams of triumph and despair. SMEATON - delighted and on 
      his feet. He claps REID on the back and moves away, giddy 
      with greed and pleasure. REID - watching him, moving to a 
      bank of PUNTERS. Some delighted - like Jackson here, 
      pocketing cash, others - many more - entirely aggrieved.

      Watch SMEATON - in his element, stood on a bleacher, taking 
      vast amounts of money in. 

      REID - watching the money very carefully. SMEATON S takings 
      go into one pocket, whilst THE PAY-OUT IS TAKEN FROM ANOTHER.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      DRAKE - his face, desperately trying to reassemble his 
      senses.                         Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1244.


      The world spinning around him, he claws at the ground. Tries 
      to raise himself upright, to focus on that area of crowd, to 
      find Donaldson again, but the world just swims.

                                                                            BACK TO:

      REID - signalling now to HOBBS and the other PLAINCLOTHES and 
      stepping forward, his men forming a phalanx behind him. 
      Moving for SMEATON.

      The PUNTERS - seeing this body of men, their intent. They 
      move aside. Reveal SMEATON, who turns, sees Reid. These men 
      behind him. And the penny drops. The betrayal of it -- 

                                    SMEATON (CONT D)
                      You....!? You re blue!?

      REID - a nod for HOBBS, who reveals his warrant card.

                                    REID
                      Joseph Smeaton. I m arresting you 
                    for the organization of, and 
                      illicit profiteering from 
                      proscribed fights.
                          (to HOBBS)
                    Put the irons on him.

      And the PUNTERS scatter now. Word spreading like fire through 
      the crowds. The WELL-TO-DO the sharpest to scramble.

      Jackson - stood in the melee. Pushing against it. Eyes on 
      Drake. Making for him.

                                                                            BACK TO:

      DRAKE - his breathing shallow. Craning himself to see as the 
      crowds shout and scatter. The flash of Donaldson s face. 
      Dragging himself to his knees. Trying to shout. No words 
      forming. And appalled to find his head suddenly taken and 
      held in Jackson s hands -- 

                                    JACKSON
                      Drake. Hold still. I have you.

                                                                            BACK TO:

      Reid - oblivious, facing Smeaton s fury and indignation --

                                    SMEATON
                      Buckle me?! They ll be leaving 
                    their earnings with another body 
                      tomorrow. You need to put the iron 
                    on every man-jack in East London!

      But then --

                                    JACKSON (O.S.)
                    Reid! Here!                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1245.


      Reid spinning. Sees Drake - struggling in Jackson s lap. 
      Moves fast to them. His concern --

                                    REID
                    What? Is he...

                                    JACKSON
                    He s fine. Glass-jaw. But he s 
                    fine.

      But Drake is clasping at Reid, trying to find words --

                                    DRAKE
                    Sir! The toff. The whiskers. At Mr. 
                      Thwaites ...

      And he manages somehow to reach; point --

                                    DRAKE
                      There!

      Reid - electrified. Turning. Sees Donaldson disappear through 
      a doorway. Takes to his heels.


      Reid - all fury, pacing hard back to where Smeaton still 
      struggles in these Plainclothes  arms.

                                    REID
                    Hold him.
                          (beat)
                    The men that come here. The ones 
                    with canes and toppers and money to 
                    spend I m sure... Dark hair. 
                      Trimmed whiskers. Moustache.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1245A.


      But Smeaton just laughs bitterly at him --

                                    SMEATON
                    Men like that here? A hundred of 
                    them every week.
                                    (MORE)                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1246.

                                    SMEATON (cont'd)
                          (beat)
                      Louse. Lurker. Magsman. Even if I 
                    could tell  em apart - I d cut my 
                      tongue out before I blew on  em to 
                    you.

      And he spits a lump of sputum on to REID S face. 

      HOBBS and another of the PLAINCLOTHES - laying into SMEATON 
      with their clubs; blows to face and stomach.

      REID stops them. Coolly reaches into SMEATON S pocket. For 
      the money he was paying out. Looks at it --

                                    REID
                      Counterfeit currency. I shall send 
                    you down for snide too, Joe.

      And he uses the money to wipe the spit away. Grabs SMEATON S 
      face, pushes his mouth apart and shoves the money inside it. 


      REID - still holding that arm, walks with DRAKE. The sweat of 
      the fight still on him, the bruising around his face --

                                    REID
                    If he has anything to tell us about 
                    this man, we re taking it this 
                    time.

      Their injuries, their grim purpose, striding toward us. 
      Opening a cell door now, to find --

      CHRISTIAN THWAITES - slumped. His shirt removed and tied 
      through the bars of his cell. The other end of it about his 
      neck. Quite dead.

                                    REID (CONT D)(cont d)
                    Oh no, no... Get Jackson!


      A knock at the door. DRAKE slings it open to reveal ARTHERTON 
      - the desk sergeant --

                                    ARTHERTON
                    Mr. Thwaites  particulars, sir.

      A nod from REID. He gestures at the desk. Where ARTHERTON 
      deposits a buff envelope.

                                    JACKSON
                    May I?

      REID nods. JACKSON produces the usual belongings, wallet, 
      watch, keys. Goes through the wallet. Produces a photograph.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1247.


                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Sweet girl.

      And he throws a keepsake image of MAUDE THWAITES, all demure 
      lace halterneck, on to the desk. REID - picking it up --

                                    REID
                    With dark secrets.

                                    JACKSON
                    We ve all got secrets. Even Drake 
                    here.

      DRAKE - eyeing JACKSON from above his patched-up nose.

                                    REID
                    I d be gentle with Sergeant Drake, 
                    if I were you. I think he s of a 
                    mind to murder someone and tonight 
                      I have no strength to stop him...

      But he tails off. On his feet, moving to the Ripper board, on 
      which he has pinned the various crime scene photographs and 
      porn shots. He removes a crime scene photograph; moves along, 
      stops in front of the over-exposed shot from the pornography 
      studio. Removes that too. Places them alongside the image of 
      Maude.

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    What do you see?

                                    DRAKE
                    Death and corruption.

                                    REID
                    Look closer.

      And he takes a pencil. Draws a small circle in the top left-
      hand corner of each image.

                                    REID (CONT D)
                      There s a blemish. A scratch on the 
                    lens most likely.

                                    JACKSON
                    The same place on each photograph.

                                    DRAKE
                    The same camera.

                                    REID
                    Cecil Creighton s camera.

1/671/67I/E. CREIGHTON BASEMENT - NIGHT 

      The padlock on that steel door. A sledgehammer busting it 
      open. Tossed aside.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1248.


      Reid, Drake, Jackson - lanterns in hand, pushing into the 
      basement. Utter silence. A sense of abandonment.

      And then the three men are SEARCHING the place. Drake - that 
      camp-bed turned over; meagre personal belongings rifled 
      through.

      Reid - turning draws and records out. Jackson the same. A 
      trunk. Clearing the junk from it. Checking its dimensions, 
      and --

                                    JACKSON
                    False bottom.

      So he stamps through it. Pulls the remains away. Reaches in. 
      And turns to the other two with his hands full of a treasure 
      trove of Victorian pornography.

      Flicking through it. His face recoils at it. Harder, much 
      more upsetting than the images he was exposed to with ROSE; 
      even harder that what that over-exposed image hinted at. 

                                    JACKSON
                    Drake - you may want to avert your 
                    eyes. This is strong meat.

      REID - finding more in there. Similarly aghast at what he 
      sees --

                                    REID
                    Got her.

      MAUDE THWAITES - many images of her in many different poses.

                                    JACKSON
                    Not much seems beyond our Maude, 
                    does it?

      And DRAKE - visibly upset by all this --

                                    DRAKE
                      That s him.

      An extraordinary image this: Against a painted backdrop of 
      pyramids and camels, DONALDSON - made up like some kind of 
      Pharoah-  forces  Maude, herself in Egyptian headdress, a 
      leash about her neck, into subjugation. 

      REID - putting the images aside. Moving to something else. 
      Something he doesn t recognise - strips of film, hung from a 
      clothes wire --

                                    REID
                      What s this?

      JACKSON - moving to him --                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1249.


                                    JACKSON
                    It s roll-film, isn t it? For that 
                    new box-camera...

                                    REID
                    No - it s wider than that. Built 
                    for broader spools. A much bigger 
                      device.

                                    DRAKE
                    Like these?

      DRAKE - found a box of self-made wooden spools.

                                    REID
                    Yes like those.

      JACKSON - studying the film. Innocent images these - a bird 
      in a cage, but --

                                    JACKSON
                    Look at this. All exactly the same.

                                    REID
                    Show me.

      JACKSON does so. But as they confer - a sharp noise. They 
      turn for the entrance. See a figure silhouetted there --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                      Creighton.

      But then the phosphorous glow of a CIGARETTE LIGHTER. A flame 
      connecting to something else - one of those rolls of film, it 
      FLARES ALIVE as --

      CREIGHTON - illuminated, looks at an aghast REID and --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    No.

      CREIGHTON tosses what is now a strip of fire directly into a 
      box at REID S feet. More film. HUNGRY FOR THE FLAMES. A 
      sudden conflagration.


      The fire - spreading eagerly. REID - bounding past it. 
      Hurling himself at the basement door. But there s no give 
        whatsoever. He turns back, sees --

      DRAKE - moving to a cistern. And throwing water to douse the 
      flames.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1250.


      But the three of them stunned to see the flames unaffected. 
      Spreading. Smoke everywhere now --

                                    DRAKE
                    What kind of fire will not be 
                      doused!?

                                    REID
                    The nitrates. They re flammable.

      DRAKE - realising the horror of their predicament now --

                                    DRAKE
                    Then everything dies here. All 
                      evidence.

                                    JACKSON
                    All the men who know of it.

      Fire - terrifying, rampant. Gelatin plates pop and crackle as 
      they re swallowed. REID, DRAKE and JACKSON forced further 
      back from it, choking on the NOXIOUS FUMES.

      REID - casting about him, looking for something, anything to 
      get them out of this. Scans the shelves of chemicals and 
      compounds that line the basement walls. An idea forming, he 
      shouts to DRAKE now --

                                    REID
                    Give me your arm!

      DRAKE - confused, doing as he s bid. REID - ripping at each 
      sleeve of his jacket, removing two squares of material.

                                    JACKSON
                            (beginning to get it)
                    Oh Reid.

                                    REID
                    The door. Clear out the space 
                      between its hinges. The same 
                      directly opposite.

                                    DRAKE
                    The steel is five inches thick, Mr. 
                    Reid. It ll never give.

                                    REID
                    Do it, Sergeant.

      DRAKE needs no further encouragement. Grabs a metal spatula. 
      Goes to work on the doorway.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1251.


      REID - moving down the shelves of chemicals. Reaches down two 
        containers. From one he pours a granular substance carefully 
      into the folds of the material of DRAKE S jacket.

                                    JACKSON
                      Phosphorous. Flash powder.

      REID - twisting the material into two balls. Finds tongs and 
      carefully dunks the balls into the gelatinous liquid that s 
      inside the other container --

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                          (to REID)
                    Is that nitrocellulose?

      A curt nod from REID. JACKSON - can t quite believe it --

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                          (to DRAKE)
                    The crazy bastard s making 
                      guncotton!

      REID - pushing DRAKE aside now. Reaches and inserts the 
      sticky wads of material and chemicals into the cracks. Steps 
      down. Grabs for that strip of film, for the images of Maude 
      Thwaites and Donaldson, stuffs them into his pockets and --

                                    REID
                    Back! Matches!

      DRAKE - handing him a box of matches. The flames - all about 
      them now.

                                    JACKSON
                      Choose your end, Drake. Burnt 
                      alive, or blown to smithereens!

      REID - the box of matches clasped in one hand, a match in 
      another, pressed against the sandpaper strip. He flicks at 
      the match. The lit match flies through the air...

      And extinguishes against the steel door.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                      You re shanking it. Aim right.

      Flames licking at their turn-ups now.

                                    DRAKE
                    Just take your time, Mr. Reid, sir.

                                    REID
                    Thank you Sergeant.

      And he flicks again. The match - flying, aflame, turning head 
      over tail through the air. Colliding with the guncotton and --                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1252.



      The blindfolded GIRLS - settling into the plush interior of 
      the coach.

                                    DONALDSON
                    Good evening, my ladies.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1253.


      DONALDSON - already sat in the carriage.

                                    DONALDSON (CONT D)
                      Turkish Delight.

      He takes the girls  hands, leads them to this wooden sweet 
      box. Rose luxuriates in the softness of the seats. The almond 
      sweetness and sugar on her lips. And sensing something --

                                    ROSE
                    There someone else in here, sir?

      DONALDSON - lighting a cigarette. And in the glow of the 
      match, find sitting opposite him - CECIL CREIGHTON.

                                    DONALDSON
                    No one you need worry about.


      Abberline sees all the MEN gathered, REID stood out front --

                                    REID
                    All your snitches - every tart, 
                      landlord, bully or thief. He ll be 
                      refined, wealthy, ruthless.

      DRAKE and HOBBS - passing the print of DONALDSON to the MEN. 
      They look, pass it on --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    We only have these pictures. And we 
                    have no name...

      Those prints - passed hand to hand. And Abberline - stepping 
      forward. Taking them in his hands. His face - sudden 
        recognition; a dismay in him, but --

                                    ABBERLINE
                    His name is Sir Arthur Donaldson.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1256.


      REID - his eyes flying across the room to meet those of his 
      old boss.


      JACKSON - his hands dressed for burns, an urgency about him 
      as he makes his way into the brothel. Finds --

                                    JACKSON
                      Where s Rose, Susan?

      SUSAN - taking in his hands; entirely cool with him --

                                    LONG SUSAN
                    I m afraid Rose isn t with us 
                      today, Mr. Jackson. Will one of our 
                    other girls serve?                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1257.



      Although you d never know it was morning. The velvet luxury 
      of this darkened townhouse. Shutters drawn, lights still on. 
      The remnants of a scene of utter debauch. Champagne, 
      Absinthe, Opium. Bedrooms - their doors open. Various 
      GENTLEMEN and various TARTS. States of absolute exhaustion.

      Find ROSE - the torn and stained state of her dress testament 
      to what the night held for her. Moving amongst it. Looking 
      for the exit. Finds a front door locked. No keys in evidence 
      either. Rose kicks at it. It doesn t budge. Shakes at set of 
      shutters. No traction there either.

      ROSE - climbing through bodies, finds a poker by a fireplace. 
      Moves to a shuttered window, uses the poker to - smash the 
      bars that hold the shutters in place. 

      Light floods into the room. Men and women stir. Rose - 
      throwing a window open, but --

                                    DONALDSON (O.S.)
                    Oh no, my beauty.

      A brutal backhand to her face. Rose - spins. Makes to strike 
      with the poker. But Donaldson has her by the wrist. Twists --

                                    DONALDSON
                      You re with me.

                                    ROSE
                    No. Tristan or Bertrand or whatever 
                    your name is - I m going home.

                                    DONALDSON
                    I ve paid for you and you re mine.

      And he strikes for her. Hard. Drags her away.

1/821/82I/E. TOWNHOUSE - DAY 

      REID, DRAKE, their MEN - gathered outside the close-shuttered 
      exterior of this upmarket townhouse. Silence. Until REID 
      blows his whistle. And a ram crunches through the oak door.

      Inside - UNIFORMS pour in, REID and DRAKE with them. But REID 
      is stopping now, his face falling.

      The house is deserted. Drapes over furniture. REID puts his 
      finger through a thick film of dust on a window sill.


      JACKSON - his frustration with SUSAN S attitude --

                                    JACKSON
                    She needs to hear what I have to 
                    say - she s to stop with the smut.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1258.


                                    LONG SUSAN
                    What - you squire her one day and 
                    daddy her the next?

      JACKSON - a slap for her. Hard. Silences her.

                                    JACKSON
                      What s the trouble here, Susan?

      And he grabs her arm. Pulls her close --

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)(cont d)
                    We were married for three weeks, 
                    three years ago - and now you get 
                      jealous?

                                    LONG SUSAN
                      Jealous? I would sooner shrivel and 
                    die alone than let you near me 
                      again.

                                    JACKSON
                    Then get the girl.

                                    LONG SUSAN
                    She s not here. She was ordered out 
                    and is yet to be returned. 

      An anger here that s little to do with JACKSON. She reaches 
      for a stack of cash on her desk --

                                    LONG SUSAN (CONT D)
                      They re late. And what s worse - 
                      they ve paid me in snide.

                                    JACKSON
                            (suddenly alert)
                    Who did?

                                    LONG SUSAN
                      I don t know. A coachman. Took 
                    three of them away in this great 
                      charabanc.

      JACKSON - grabbing at the COUNTERFEIT MONEY --

                                    JACKSON
                    Get your hat. You re going to see 
                    Reid.

                                    LONG SUSAN
                    I m doing no such thing.

      She reads his look.

                                    LONG SUSAN
                    You touch me, I ll kill you.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1259.



      CECIL CREIGHTON - the door to this large wooden cabinet now 
      open to reveal a protrusion that is both camera and 
      projector. 

      Donaldson - Rose by the hair; fresh bruising all about her. 
      Dragging her into a chair and on to his lap.

                                    DONALDSON
                      Creighton. Lift the curtain.

      Creighton - his discomfort. Does as he s bid. Sets the 
      machine going.

      Rose - nothing in her life has prepared her for this. 
        Astonishment at these images that move. And sheer dread at 
      the content of the images --

      THE FILM: MAUDE THWAITES - that leash about her neck, a slave 
      girl offering herself to DONALDSON, the Pharoah. 


      REID and DRAKE - pushing back in with their men --

                                    REID
                    His friends. Any relatives. 
                          (beat)
                      Hobbs! The Telegraph. Scotland Yard  
                    must have their names and 
                      addresses.

      But then --

                                    JACKSON (O.S.)
                    Reid!

      REID spins to his name. Sees JACKSON - scratches and bruises 
      fresh on his face, his hand still on the collar of a very 
      pinched LONG SUSAN, deeply unnerved by being surrounded by 
      all these police. He pushes her toward them --

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Show and tell, Susan.

      SUSAN - handing REID a few counterfeit notes. And this is 
      hard for her --

                                    LONG SUSAN
                    Three of my girls. Collected last 
                      night. Not yet returned. Black 
                      coach, two black horses. 
                          (beat)
                    They paid in that.

      REID - studying the bill, handing it to DRAKE; many things 
      dawning on them --                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1260.


                                    REID
                    Come with me.


      JOSEPH SMEATON - his heels scuffing on the smooth floor as 
      he s dragged by DRAKE down this corridor and flung into a 
      cell.

      DRAKE - slamming him on to a chair. Taking irons and bolting 
      him to it.

                                    REID
                          (to DRAKE)
                    Do it.

      Reid - slamming the door to the cell and, before SMEATON 
      knows what s happened, DRAKE has hit him with a blow so 
      powerful that man and chair are lifted from the floor and 
      cast into the opposite wall.

      REID - grabbing at SMEATON S filthy shirtfront, drags him 
      upright. Hands him the counterfeit note --

                                    REID (CONT D)
                    One of yours, I believe.

      SMEATON - squirming, but finds his contempt for REID --

                                    SMEATON
                      They re all over the city.

                                    REID
                    Only they re not.
                          (beat)
                    You don t have to tell me who they 
                    are. Just where I find them.

                                    SMEATON
                    What makes you think I know?

                                    REID
                      Sincerely? Not a great deal. I d 
                    call it instinct.

                                    SMEATON
                    Then you can take your instinct and 
                    put in -
                          (DRAKE)
                    This animal s fundament.

      Reid - a look for Drake. A nod to him. And he turns for the 
      door.


      ROSE - her eyes wide. Her disgust. Feels DONALDSON tense as, 
      on the screen --                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1261.


      THE FILM: MAUDE THWAITES - her neck CRACKINGat this moment 
      of ecstacy. She slumps - quite dead - at DONALDSON S feet.

      DONALDSON - his rampant excitement, turning to CREIGHTON --

                                    DONALDSON
                    Shall we make another?

                                    CREIGHTON
                          (terse; frightened)
                      I need light.

                                    DONALDSON
                      Imagine - a little thing like that 
                    stood between us and our 
                      enrichment! Light you shall have.

      And he grabs ROSE by the hair again hand, drags her from the 
      armchair, moves to a set of doors and throws them open. 
      Sunlight floods the room.

      CREIGHTON - squinting out on to a totally secluded ornamental 
      garden. Huge walls rising up and encircling it. THE WALLS 
      PAINTED AND DECORATED AS THE BACKDROP FOR THOSE SCENES OF 
        PHAROANICEGYPT.

      Rose - her utter terror. And she goes for him. Kicking and 
      biting and scratching for her life. But Donaldson is way too 
      strong for her. Two more heavy blows send her flying out into 
      the daylight.


      Reid - upright outside this closed cell door. Terrible sounds 
      of Smeaton s beating and agony emerge from within. 

                                    SMEATON (O.S.)
                    He lives in Mayfair!

                                    DRAKE (O.S.)
                    We know that. He does no longer.

      More blows. More screams. Reid s face is steel --

                                    SMEATON (O.S.)
                      There s another place. I only went 
                    there once. They wanted 
                      amphetamine. From Germany. There s 
                      a Kraut at the docks I know...

                                    DRAKE (O.S.)
                      Where!

      And then Drake is in the doorway. His shirtsleeves rolled up, 
      a fleck of blood on his shirt front; more on his knuckles.

                                    REID
                    Well?                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1262.


                                    DRAKE
                    Under our noses, sir.

        OMITTED1/891/89


      DRAKE, REID, JACKSON - cautious now in the shuttered gloom of 
      the place. Opening a door. Inside, their eyes adjusting, 
      picking out the tangle of limbs and naked bodies.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1263.


      The glare of steel now. A MAN- barely clothed, emerging from 
      the dark - a regimental sword raised high and brought down 
      upon JACKSON.

      JACKSON - bringing his arm up to shoot. Too late, though - 
      the gun fires into the ceiling. The sword cuts through the 
      flesh of JACKSON S shoulder.

      Blood. And screams. DRAKE S fist - buried into the face of 
      the ASSAILANT, who goes down. A stamp from REID S boot 
      finishes him.

      DRAKE - taking up the man s sword. Chaos now. Women s 
      screams. Our three heroes pushing against the tide of people 
      screaming from the house.

      Kicking doors open. Seeing light flooding into this empty 
      room. Their eyes adapting as they careen through, seeing --

          OMITTED1/93A1/93A


      LONG SUSAN throws the doors of the brothel open for --

      DRAKE. ROSE carried effortlessly in his arms. Behind him - 
      JACKSON, his arm bound, and the two other girls.

                                    LONG SUSAN
                    This way.

      DRAKE - sweeping up the staircase. Looks down - sees ROSE S 
      beautiful green eyes gazing up at him, her rescuer. He smiles 
      for her. Pushes into this room and lays her on the quilted 
      bed. Stays with her a moment, as --

                                    ROSE
                      I thought - at last, the Ripper 
                    gone - I thought it was safe again.

                                    DRAKE
                    Sssh. It is now.

                                    ROSE
                    Your name..?

                                    DRAKE
                      Bennet. BennetDrake.
                          (a beat)
                    It is my great pleasure to make 
                    your acquaintance, Miss Rose.

      And in that moment DRAKE binds himself to Rose. He is hers 
      forever.

      LONG SUSAN stopping JACKSON in the doorway --

                                    LONG SUSAN
                    You see to her. If she is hurt, you 
                    make her well again.

      And JACKSON approaches the bed.

                                    JACKSON
                    Thank you, Drake. I ll tend to her 
                    now.

      DRAKE - a regret. A nod. He backs, blushing from the room.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1264A.



      Back in this boozer. REID - sat at a table. In his hands - 
      that film. The caged bird. He folds it carefully. Places it 
      inside an envelope. Places envelope inside his coat.                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1265.


      And looks up now to see two men stood in the entrance to the 
      pub - ABBERLINE and BEST. The crowds of COPPERS - they part 
        respectfully for ABBERLINE, look with a certain hatred at a 
      clearly intimidated BEST. Watch as the two men join REID.

      All eyes on this triumvirate as, after a moment, REID pushes 
      a buff brown file across the table to BEST --

                                    REID
                    The facts. 

      BEST - his confusion. Taking the file, opening it. His eyes 
      going wide at the photographs within. ABBERLINE can t believe 
      what REID has just done --

                                    ABBERLINE
                    Have you lost your mind?

                                    BEST
                          (to REID)
                    Why?

                                    REID
                      Because it is the truth. And I 
                    would have the world know it.
                          (then)
                    She was never Ripper, that girl. 
                    But we three... you..
                          (BEST)
                      forprofit. 
                            (ABBERLINE)
                    You and I for guilt, I suspect.
                    We wanted it so.
                          (beat)
                    So now I ask us to undertake this: 
                    that we take a little joy in his 
                      continued absence. And that we then 
                    cease to look for him in every act 
                    of evil that crosses our path. 
                          (beat)
                    There is an abundance of that 
                      hereabout and I would have 
                      obsession blinker us to the wider 
                    world no longer. Am I understood? 

      BEST - clasping his file to his chest, he nods. 

                                    REID
                    Then get out.

      BEST - doing just that. Scurrying away through the ranks of 
      men. Abberline - a long moment --

                                    ABBERLINE
                      Edmund - this last year, that... 
                      lunatic. It will ever bind me to 
                    you. But you ask too much.
                          (beat)
                                    (MORE)                        Episode One - YELLOW AMENDS - 10/04/1266.

                                    ABBERLINE (cont'd)
                    He lives still; he breathes this 
                    air still. These streets demand 
                    your vigilance.

                                    REID
                    No. We did everything in our power. 
                    Used every instrument allowed to us 
                    and many that weren t. All that is 
                      demanded now is - he is gone. And 
                    stays gone. 

      And REID gets to his feet. Looks down on his old comrade --

                                    REID
                    He will own my life no more.

      And he s turned and gone. Past all those COPPERS. They nod 
      for him, clear and full respect in their eyes.

      ABBERLINE - just a sad man in a corner, as --
