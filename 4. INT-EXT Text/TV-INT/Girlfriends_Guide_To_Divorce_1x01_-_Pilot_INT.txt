      Jake walks quietly through the sleeping home, down a hallway 
      lined with artful photographs of JAKE WITH HIS ADORABLE 
      CHILDREN, his BEAUTIFUL WIFE...  

      That same wife has a number of framed BOOK COVERS, press 
      clips and photos that identify her as the author of the very 
      successful  Girlfriend s Guide  series.

      Their many dogs, mutts, eagerly follow him.  He ignores them.



      The door eases open.  Jake slips in silently.  Peels off his 
      super skinny jeans and expensive t-shirt.  Everything except 
      his boxers.  Climbs under the covers.                                                                                      2.


      His wife, VICKI McCARTHY, 30 s, rolls over.  Awake.  The same 
      beautiful woman from the smiling pictures, only thinner and 
      exhausted.  

      Vicki hasn t slept well in months, but mostly manages to 
      maintain her blunt humor and common sense.  

      They lie there.  Not speaking.  Looking up at the ceiling, 
      tense.  Then: 

                                  VICKI
                    You smell like sex.

                                  JAKE
                    Screw you.

      ACT ONE



      Vicki and Jake.  Still in bed.  Staring at the ceiling.  Each  
      quietly seething. 

      The door flies open and their son, CHARLIE, 7, bounds onto 
      the bed.  Crawls under the covers, cuddles up.

      Vicki and Jake are suddenly all smiles.  Playful.  Too happy 
      for this early.  Vicki tickles Charlie, a spacey sweetheart.

                                  VICKI
                    Morning, Bun Bun!

                                    CHARLIE
                    Dad, I m Special Person this week!

                                  JAKE
                    You re special every week if you 
                    ask me, kid-- 

      LILLY, their 13-year-old, enters and flops face down on the 
      bed.  She s already dressed -- in cute jeans, a t-shirt and 
      Converse kicks.  It s a studied  I don t give a fuck  look. 

      She s tall and so beautiful it hurts.  A type-A girl, she s 
      all about excelling.  Surpassing expectations.  She can come 
      off hard, but she s totally fragile underneath.

      Jake reaches for Lilly:

                                  JAKE (CONT D)
                    Hey, Lil.  Come here, Sunshine.

                                  LILLY
                          (not moving)
                    My life is suck.

      Vicki gets up, as does Jake.  He pads into the bathroom.  He 
      and Vicki don t look at each other.  They are acting their 
      parts, but in different universes.  

      We hear Jake pee.  Vicki, irritated, says:

                                  VICKI
                    Door closed, please--                                                                                      4.


                                    CHARLIE
                    Nobody needs to see that before 
                    coffee, dad!

      Vicki laughs as she pulls on some clothes.  Sleek, tasteful.  
      She knows Lilly has an agenda.  Gets back to it:

                                  VICKI
                    Why is your life suck, Lilly?

                                  LILLY
                      Volleyball finals are all weekend.  
                    I m missing Jade s birthday party. 

      Vicki picks Charlie up.  He s almost too big. 

      She staggers into the hall.  Lilly follows.  Jake trails 
      behind, dressing.



      Vicki moves into the open kitchen, which has stunning views 
      of the hills.  The decor is perfect.  Dwell meets Nancy 
      Meyers as hipster.  

      Vicki, a marvel of efficiency, makes breakfast, organizes 
      snacks...  Jake s sits at the counter, not helping.  He eats 
      off kid s plates with his hands, just to drive Vicki crazy.

      Vicki and Jake avoid eye contact.  Vicki s forced cheer masks 
      small barbs at Jake, who s slipped into quiet despair.  

      But she s also performing for him.  Showing him what a good 
      mom she is.  How  normal  and  happy  family life is.

                                  LILLY
                    It s a sleepover at the London.  
                    Her moms got the Penthouse suite.  
                    Can t you drive me?

                                  VICKI
                    From Anaheim?  And drive you back 
                    in the morning?  That seems crazy.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Daddy, is it weird to like the 
                    smell of your farts?  I mean, 
                    yours, not other people s.

                                  JAKE
                          (while texting)
                    No.                                                                                      5.


                                    CHARLIE
                    Daddy, will you help me with my 
                    Special Person board? 

                                  VICKI
                    I got it, Bun Bun.  I bought the 
                    art supplies yesterday.

                                  JAKE
                          (to Lilly)
                    Wasn t Jade texting all that mean 
                    crap about you?

                                  LILLY
                    She was going through some stuff.  
                    She just found out she s adopted.

                                  VICKI
                    Jade just found out?  Her moms are 
                    lesbians.  Did she not understand 
                    the biology?

      Ding!  Vicki gets a text.  From Jake.  It reads: What s crazy 
      is this bullshit act you re putting on.

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                            (caught/distracted)
                    Honey...  I don t care who s vagina 
                    she came from.  Jade s a bitch.

                                  LILLY
                    So I can t go?  The party is at 
                    Hotel.

                                  VICKI
                          (texting back)
                    You aren t making your case here, 
                    Lil--

                                  LILLY
                    Why?!  Is room service a  bad 
                      influence ?  Dad!

      Jake looks at his text.  It reads: At least I don t have 
      AstroGlide smeared on my chin. Jake, alarmed, swipes at his 
      chin.  There s nothing there.  He glares at Vicki:

                                  JAKE
                    Up to your mom.  She who must be 
                    obeyed.

                                  LILLY
                    Well?                                                                                      6.


                                  VICKI
                    Let me think about it, Lil.  Get 
                    your stuff.  We re leaving in five.

      With that, Lilly moves off in a huff.  Charlie takes his 
      plate under the table, eats there with the dogs. 

      Jake and Vicki are left fuming.  Silent.  They each look down 
      at their phones -- avoiding each other.



      Vicki, Lilly and Charlie race outside to Vicki s car, a tiny 
      Fiat.  Charlie is holding a waffle.  Lilly has her i-pod on.

                                  VICKI
                    Charlie!  Backpack!  

      Vicki doubles back.  Jake s standing right next to Charlie s 
      backpack but doesn t seem to notice.  Vicki shoots him a 
      scathing look -- grabs the backpack, races to the car. 

      Jake waves goodbye to the kids from the doorway.  

                                  JAKE
                    Love you!

      The kids wave as Vicki speeds off.

      Jake deflates as the car disappears.  Looks sad and lost.  A 
      beat.  He closes and locks the door.  Leaves.



      Vicki s friend LYLA, a busty middle-aged Persian, impeccably  
      dressed, answers.  She s caking on eyeliner as she drives.  

      Lyla s a legendary entertainment lawyer.  A SHARK.  But also 
      fiercely maternal and involved with people she loves.  

                                  VICKI
                    Did you tell anyone at school about 
                    me and Jake?

                                  LYLA
                    Of course not.  I m a lawyer.                                                                                    10.


                                  VICKI
                    Not my lawyer.

      Vicki tosses the nearly full cigarette pack in a trash can.

                                  LYLA
                    Not yet.  Let me know when you re 
                    ready to ditch your moron.

      Vicki gets in her car.  Switches to Bluetooth as she drives.

                                  VICKI
                    People know, I can tell.  Eric 
                    Frank eye-banged me on my way into 
                    Charlie s class.  He smells blood.  

                                  LYLA
                    I can t believe Marjorie Davis had 
                    sex with him.

                                  VICKI
                    She and her her husband were taking 
                      a  break , remember?  His dick is 
                    like a divorce-seeking missile.

                                  LYLA
                          (while parking)
                    Did you see Dan at drop off?  Did 
                    he look hung over?

                                  VICKI
                    We were late.

                                  LYLA
                    He was out until 3 in the morning.  
                    Left the kids with a babysitter.

                                  VICKI
                    Lyla.
                          (off her silence)
                    You said you were stopping that.

      Vicki parks.  Gets out.



      Now Vicki walks through the colorful maze that is the 
      original Farmer s Market on Fairfax, still on her phone.  

      Quaint original food stalls now mix with more upscale 
      options.                                                                                     11.


                                  LYLA
                    I still have money on my retainer.  

                                  VICKI
                    But having him followed--

                                  LYLA
                    He leaves the boys on his night!  
                    Can t he do his perverted shit 
                    during the day?  He s got no job!

                                  VICKI
                    Lyla.  All this anger...  You need 
                    to let go.  Cry.  Be sad--

      Now we see that Vicki and Lyla are walking toward each other, 
      still talking on their phone.  As they meet, they hang up and 
      keep talking, not missing a beat.

                                  LYLA
                    You know what s sad?  What a 
                      spectacular piece of shit he is.  I 
                    give him 50 grand a month and now 
                    he s after my pension!?  If I prove 
                    him unfit then I get the kids and 
                    he can t live off the child support-

      They move into a line in front of SHORT CAKE, a retro-cool 
      bakery and coffee joint.  Baristas in vests and scarves.  
      Very fucking serious about their coffee.

                                  VICKI
                    He s entitled to half, Lyla.  If he 
                    were a woman--

                                  LYLA
                    Screw that.  If he were a woman I d 
                      understand why he s got no balls.
                          (then/re: Baristas)
                    Holy Christ.  This place.  They all 
                    look like escapees from a touring 
                      production of Oliver.



      Phoebe stands by the sink, her BACK TO US.  Her top is lifted 
      to expose her breasts to Vicki.  Lyla and Kate are there too, 
      and Kate s got the giggles.

                                  PHOEBE
                    Touch.  Go on.  

                        KATEVICKI
      Oh my God, you guys--Really?  
                                                      (she does)
                                                  Wow...  

      A woman enters, sees Vicki holding Phoebe s boobs.  The woman 
      laughs.  Ducks into a stall.  Lyla explains:

                                  LYLA
                    She s showing off her work.

                                  BOOB WOMAN (O.C.)
                    Don t let me stop you.  

                                  PHOEBE
                    Doctor Frankel.  Perfect, right?

                                  BOOB WOMAN (O.C.)
                    Frankel?  No way!

      The toilet flushes and the woman comes out, turns to them and 
      LIFTS HER TOP.  The ladies react, laughing.  

                                  KATE
                    I can t.  Stop!

                                  VICKI
                    Look, four matching boobs.
                          (admitting)
                    They re gorgeous. 

      The boob woman covers up and heads out.  Smiles to Vicki:                                                                                    22.


                                  BOOB WOMAN
                    Do it.  I love them so much I wish 
                    I could have more.  A few here, a 
                    few there...

                                  VICKI
                    Maybe I will.  Thank you.

      And she s gone.  Vicki, Phoebe and Lyla laugh again but Kate 
      is just looking at Vicki a little blankly.  Finally manages:

                                  KATE
                    Can I have a word with you, 
                    outside?

      Vicki makes a face at the others as Kate moves out.

                                  VICKI
                    Okay.  

      Vicki moves outside.  A beat.  Then:

                                  PHOEBE
                    She s so uptight. 

                                  LYLA
                    Like Kate Spade made a person.



      Later.  Vicki, stylishly put together for a work lunch, sits 
      under an olive tree in the dining area of the SOHO house.  

      Hollywood A-listers enjoy panoramic views of the hills and 
      beyond, while munching on hummus and quinoa.                                                                                      24.


      This is the world of cut-throat players pretending to be 
       California casual. 

      Across from Vicki sits her legendary BOOK EDITOR, CAT.  Cat 
      is pretty damn old, 70 s?  But feisty.  

      Cat has spread out some publicity headshots and book tour ads  
      for Vicki s approval.  Vicki examines them.  She looks too 
      polished in the photos, unlike herself.  

      Vicki s drinking wine, a bit loose.

                                  VICKI
                    I look like a cyborg.

                                  CAT
                    I know.  Isn t it great?  
                          (off Vicki s look)
                    Too much.  This is just for the 
                    book tour stuff.  

                                  VICKI
                    Oh, fine.  Go with Blade Runner.  

                                  CAT
                    We re getting media requests for 
                    the whole family together.  Dr. 
                    Phil--

                                  VICKI
                    No way.  

                                  CAT
                    Dr. Oz?  Any Oprah Doctor?  

                                  VICKI
                    I don t want the kids on TV--

                                  CAT
                    Why not?  You write about them.  
                    Your readers feel like they know 
                    all of you, like they watched the 
                    kids grow up--  

                                  VICKI
                    In their imaginations.  Have you 
                    looked at my daughter lately?  All 
                    lithe and blonde and...  How long 
                    before Cruise s guy asks her to be 
                    Tom s next child bride?  

                                  CAT
                    Just Jake then.  It s not only you 
                    we re selling.  It s the family.                                                                                    25.


                                  VICKI
                          (evasive)
                    I don t know.  He s super busy.

                                  CAT
                    Doing what?

                                  VICKI
                    He s prepping this indie he s going 
                    to direct.

                                  CAT
                          (gathering her stuff)
                    So is our waiter.  Tell him he s 
                    coming.  No excuses.
                          (off her silence)
                      Everything okay?

                                  VICKI
                    Sure.  I ll talk to him.

                                  CAT
                    Good.  I have to dash.  You and 
                    Jake.  The Grove.  This Thursday.  
                    I ll have press there.  Just give a 
                    few interviews, pose for a few 
                    happy snaps.  Easy peasy.

                                  VICKI
                          (weakly)
                    Easy peasy.

      OFF Vicki, looking a little panicked as she downs her wine.



                                        END ACT TWO                                                                                    26.


      ACT THREE



      Lyla s on her couch, meticulously grooming her stout, 
      CHAMPION BULLDOG, POPPY.  Poppy is spoiled, sporting a PINK 
      COLLAR studded with Swarovski crystals.   

      Lyla s taste in decor is decidedly over-the-top.  Lots of 
      gold and mirrored surfaces.  Her phone rings.  It s Vicki.

      INTERCUT WITH:



      Vicki, now in sweat pants, roots around in the refrigerator, 
      on her phone.  We can hear the theme to  Adventure Time  on a 
      TV in another room.  Charlie sings loudly along.  

                                  VICKI
                            (quietly/anxious)
                    Cat says Jake needs to be at the 
                    book signing.  

                                  LYLA
                    He does.  You need to keep up your 
                    fake  together  thing long enough 
                    to sell books.  The break-up is 
                    going to hurt the brand.

                                  VICKI
                    Jake doesn t care about the 
                     brand .  Besides, I basically 
                    called him a child molester.  As if 
                    he didn t hate me enough--

                                  LYLA
                    So?  His brilliant career doesn t 
                    pay the rent.  Let him squirm. 
                          (then)
                    These guys.  God.  Dan s about to 
                    drop off and he wants to  talk .  
                    If he asks for more money--

      Lyla s DOORBELL RINGS.  She checks her face.  Then unbuttons 
      her blouse to expose her spectacular cleavage.                                                                                      27.


                                  LYLA (CONT D)
                    Here we go.

                                  VICKI
                    Call me after.



      A two story entry with a massive chandelier.  Gold Tiger 
      statue, a giant glass sculpture of a palm tree.

      A maid opens the door to DAN and MARK, 8, and ERIC, 10.  Lyla 
      is right behind her.  She s all over the boys, loves them 
      something crazy.  Oppressively at times.  

      Dan, newly trim and handsome, is nervous.  Wanting to breach 
      Lyla s wall.  Mark is wiry, a ball of energy.  Eric, in a 
      Minecraft T-Shirt, is pudgy and sensitive.

                                  LYLA
                    Hello my honeys!  Miboosamet!

      Big hugs.  She holds on tight a beat too long.

                                  ERIC
                    Ouch--

                                  LYLA
                    Sorry, sorry.  If you look in your 
                    rooms, you ll find surprises!

      The boys grin, race off.

                                  DAN
                    Don t do that.  They don t need 
                    presents just for coming home.  

      Lyla just stares at him.  Chilly.

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    Can we sit?



      Lyla and Dan are fucking under the sheets.  She s on stop, 
      going to town.  He s moaning, mind blown. 

                                  DAN
                      Slow...slow it...

      But she can t stop.  She climaxes.  Then he does too.  She 
      collapses on him.   

      They breath heavily.  Then she grabs a half empty bottle of 
      scotch off the night stand.  Drinks.  Hands him the bottle.  
      He drinks.  Then he grins:  

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    You are so competitive.

      She laughs.



      Lyla, in a bathrobe, and Dan, dressed now, sneak into the 
      entry.  The house is dark.  She quietly lets him out.  
      They re both tipsy, a little giddy.                                                                                    30.


                                  LYLA
                    This stays between us.  We were 
                    entitled to one for the road. 

                                  DAN
                    Right.  Good.

      He heads to his car.  Laughs to himself.  She whispers:

                                  LYLA
                    No more chicken nuggets for Eric!

                                  DAN
                    Right.  Talk to you tomorrow.

      He gets into his minivan.  Drives off.  Lyla watches him.



      Lyla picks up the phone.  Suddenly sober.   Dials.  

                                  LYLA
                    I want to report a drunk driver.  



      Lyla washes up, rubs on a variety of expensive looking creams 
      and lotions.  She stops.  Unable to contain herself.

      She grabs her phone, TEXTS VICKI.  It reads --  NAILED HIM .

      She looks at herself in the mirror.  

      Then she BURSTS INTO TEARS.  Lyla s little secret?  She 
      didn t want this divorce.  Hates sharing her kids.  Misses 
      Dan.  But she ll be damned if she ll admit it to anyone.

                                                                          FADE TO:                                                                                    31.



      Vicki lies in bed, Jake sitting heavily on his side.  They re 
      both awake.  She looks at him.   He s in THE SAME CLOTHES as 
      the day before.  Unshaven.  Looks like hell.

                                  VICKI
                    Hey.  Charlie s  Special Person  
                    today, remember?  And I was 
                    wondering if we could talk later--

                                  JAKE
                    Where do you get off with those 
                    texts, Vicki?  We re on a break--

                                  VICKI
                          (with difficulty)
                    I know.  I m...sorry.  I was--

      The kids burst in.  Jake and Vicki are all smiles.



      Later.  Vicki and Jake wait in the hall.  Vicki holds the art 
      project -- a big sheet of colored poster board.  We can t see 
      exactly what s on it.  

      Vicki finally breaks the silence, awkward:

                                  VICKI
                    Hey.  I need, not a favor exactly -- 
                    that signing at the Grove?  We need 
                    to present a united front.

                                  JAKE
                    What does that mean?

                                  VICKI
                    You have to come.  This book won t 
                    sell if we seem -- we can t be in 
                    trouble.                                                                                      32.


                                  JAKE
                    Then it won t sell.  It s bad 
                    enough that the kids have to live 
                    with everyone reading books full of 
                    their adorable shits and bed-
                    wetting--

                                  VICKI
                          (hot)
                    Those  shits  put you through film 
                    school--

                                  JAKE
                          (over her/cutting)
                    Why don t you write about lying?  
                    Turns out it s what you re best at. 

      Vicki s about to reply but the door to Charlie s classroom 
      opens and a pretty young teacher steps out.  Smiles:

                                    TEACHER
                    Charlie s ready for you.



        Kindergarten is filled with art and fantastic play areas.  
      The kids sit on a rug while Vicki and Jake stiffly hold up 
      the poster board, which has a big picture of CHARLIE on it.

      It s also full of PHOTOS from Charlie s life.  Like Vicki and 
      Jake exhausted and blissed over tiny newborn Charlie -- and 
      cheering him at T-ball...  A collection of happy times.

                                    CHARLIE
                    See?  My mommy writes books about 
                    us and she was on TV one time.  And 
                    this is me and mommy and daddy, on 
                    Splash Mountain!  Best. Day. Ever.  

      ON PHOTO

      Vicki, Jake and Charlie on the ride, laughing.

      ON VICKI AND JAKE

      Who smile as best they can.  But they re both dying inside.  
      Hurting.



      Vicki and Jake exit the classroom, head in OPPOSITE 
      DIRECTIONS without a word to each other.                                                                                    33.



      A dark bar with a speakeasy vibe.  Vicki, Lyla, Phoebe and 
      Kate enter, dolled up for a night out.  Even Kate looks sexy, 
      if more conservative.  She s texting on her phone.  

                                  KATE
                    Mark says hi.  He wants a picture.  
                    Come on girls, get together.

      The women ignore her.  Vicki s a little irritated.

                                  VICKI
                    Can you just -- please put your 
                    husband away for one night, please?

                                  LYLA
                    I want to dance.  You bitches 
                    better dance. 

                                  VICKI
                    Jesus.  What s gotten into you? 

                                  LYLA
                    You realize Dan can t drive for 
                    three months?  Do you know how that 
                    would look in family court?
                          (then)
                    I just wish the kids had been in 
                    the car.

      Vicki takes this in, appalled.  Kate cuts her a look.  See?

                                  LYLA (CONT D)
                    What?  I have to do something.  The 
                    boys hate his place.  Eric s  
                      stress-eating again.  You know what 
                    he spent his birthday money on?
                          (before she can answer)
                    Half-off Easter candy. I found a 
                    giant bag of Peeps under his bed. 

      Phoebe gives the handsome manager, GABE, a hug and kiss.  
      He s attractive in a real way.  Warmth and substance.

                                  PHOEBE
                    Gabe, you better show my girls a 
                    good time.                                                                                    35.


                                  GABE
                    Ralf s already here.  He told me 
                    the same thing.    

      Gabe takes them to a bookcase.  He knocks on it.  It SWINGS 
      OPEN.  He leads them down a secret staircase.  Vicki s 
      amused:

                                  VICKI
                    Come on.  Hipster Disneyland.

      Gabe laughs at this.  He and Vicki exchange smiles.  

      They react, enter the main room of a large Cuban-style bar.  
      It s stunning with dim lights, red booths.  Lots of beautiful 
      people talking and laughing.  Music plays.  It s exciting.

      Phoebe moves to her ex-husband, a handsome older German man -- 
      RALF.  He s in his fifties but uber fit and fashionable.  
      Phoebe kisses him affectionately.  

                                  RALF
                    Hi baby.

      Ralf s hand grazes Phoebe s ass as he stands and greets Lyla 
      and Vicki.  Lyla notices, raises an eyebrow at Vicki.  What 
      the hell?

                      PHOEBERALF
      This place is gorgeous, (to Vicki)
      right?You have to try the Tostones 
                                                  with mojito sauce.  

                                  VICKI
                    I think I ll just have a quick 
                    drink.

                                  RALF
                    Screw that.  I designed this place 
                    for the long drink.  

      Vicki laughs.  Ralf moves Vicki and Kate to the bar, Lyla and 
      Phoebe trail behind.  Ralf shouts to the bartender:

                                  RALF (CONT D)
                    Tap the Admiral, four times.  

      Now Ralf leans into Vicki, grabs her around the waist.

                                  RALF (CONT D)
                    13 year-old rum.  Delicious.  
                          (growls)
                    Just like you.  You d better dance 
                    with me later.                                                                                      36.


      Vicki, surprised, manages a  maybe  smile.



      LATER.  Vicki, Lyla and Kate are dancing on a small dance 
      floor.  Vicki s tipsy, but a pleasant drunk.  Very earnest.  
      Kate looks uncomfortable with the whole scene.

                                  VICKI
                    We should go out more!

      A nice-looking GUY tries to move in on Vicki and dance with 
      her.  She pointedly ignores him.  She shoots an amused look 
      at Lyla and Kate.  Lyla nods, like  go for it!   

      Instead, Vicki moves off the dance floor.  Kate follows 
      Vicki, leaving Lyla to dance with the guy.  Kate and Vicki 
      settle at the bar.  Kate takes in the scene, shakes her head.

                                  KATE
                    We should go.  You want to look 
                    fresh for your book signing.

                                  VICKI
                    Not yet.  I m -- I need this, you 
                    know?  There has to be an upside to 
                    half custody.

                                  KATE
                    That s not funny, Em.  

      Vicki, emboldened by rum, gets real:

                                  VICKI
                    I know you don t approve.  Of any 
                    of this.  

                                  KATE
                    I guess I just don t understand.  
                    These people, of course they think 
                    you should get divorced.  They did.  
                          (then)
                    But we practically lived at each 
                    other s houses.  And you guys had 
                      problems...  But it s not like 
                    anybody was an alcoholic or hitting 
                      anybody...

                                  VICKI
                          (stung)
                    What?                                                                                    37.


                                  KATE
                    I mean, if you two can t make it, 
                    who can?  
                          (almost to herself)
                    You don t leave.  That s what we 
                    all signed on for.  

                                  VICKI
                    I m trying.  You have--

                                  KATE
                    Hanging out with Phoebe and Lyla?   
                    Come on.  They re your Sherpas out.

      Vicki clumsily stands from the table, reeling at Kate s 
      judgement.  

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    Vicki--

                                  VICKI
                    Sorry I didn t get hit.  I realize 
                    that s hard for you.  

                                  KATE
                    No, that s not what I--

                                  VICKI
                    Go home, Kate.  Maybe we can hang 
                    out when I m married again.

      Vicki walks away.  Kate looks stricken.  Grabs her bag and 
      takes off, upset.



      Later.  Vicki sits alone in a dark corner booth, lost in self 
      doubt and too many cocktails.  Phoebe slides in next to her, 
      hugs her.  Affectionate.  Vicki smiles.

                                  PHOEBE
                    I m so glad we re friends now, 
                    Lady.

                                  VICKI
                    Me too.

                                  PHOEBE
                    You okay?

                                  VICKI
                    In my head.  Kate said some stuff.                                                                                    38.


                                  PHOEBE
                    Kate.  Is a bitch.  She seriously 
                    needs to work on her energy.

      The manager, GABE, swaps their old drinks for fresh ones.  
      Smiles at Vicki.  She smiles back, raises her glass.

                                  VICKI
                    You, sir, are made of rainbows.  
                    You bring great joy to many.

                                  GABE
                    Yes I do.

                                  VICKI
                          (re: her drink)
                     Tapping The Admiral.   Why s it 
                    called that?  Is it like -- dirty?  
                    Like  tap that Admiral s ass! 

                                  GABE
                    Not quite -- supposedly Admiral 
                    Nelson died at sea and was shipped 
                    back to England embalmed in rum.  
                    The crew got thirsty.  So...  

                                  VICKI
                      Delicious.  I thought I detected a 
                    note of something corpse-y.

      He laughs and moves away.  Phoebe scoots even closer to 
      Vicki, puts a hand on her knee.  Very touchy.  Phoebe 
      hesitates.  Then decides -- what the fuck:

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    So, what s really going on with you 
                    and Ralf?  You two seem awfully 
                    friendly.

                                  PHOEBE
                    Don t judge...

                                  VICKI
                    No judge.

                                  PHOEBE
                    He gets off on paying me now.  

                                  VICKI
                          (clueless)
                    Child support?                                                                                     39.


                                  PHOEBE
                    He has to pay that.  And alimony.  
                    This is for...services rendered. 

      Vicki takes this in.  Delightfully scandalized.

                                  VICKI
                    No!  Really?

                                  PHOEBE
                    I get these calls.  Sometimes in 
                    the middle of the day.  He s dying 
                    for it.  And I just drive the price 
                    up and up and up... 
                          (grins)
                    And he goes up and up and up.

                                  VICKI
                    Like a new pair of Louboutins?  Or?

                                  PHOEBE
                    Like a new BMW.  7.
                          (casual)
                    Now that it s illicit again, he s 
                    obsessed.  I don t know, maybe it s 
                    a German thing.

                                  VICKI
                    Oh my God.  I called you a whore...

                                  PHOEBE
                    Please.  I was a model, Lady.  I ve 
                    been selling my ass since I was 14. 

      Vicki s not sure what to make of that.  Before she can ask:

                                  PHEOBE
                    And even though I got a nice 
                      settlement from Ralf--
                          (off Vicki s look)
                    -- a very nice settlement -- it 
                    doesn t hurt to put more away.  I m 
                    thinking about starting a business.  
                    Lyla and you are inspiring.  You re 
                    both very Beyonce , Independent 
                    Women, you know?

                                  VICKI
                    Really?  What kind of business?

                                  PHEOBE
                    I m not sure.  I m meditating on 
                    it.  Something that helps people.                                                                                    40.


      Then Phoebe changes the subject.  Purrs:

                                  PHOEBE
                    But I came over to talk about you, 
                    not me.  What s up?  I ve seen at 
                    least five cute guys try to get in 
                    your pants.  No go.

                                  VICKI
                    It s just too strange.  I can t.

                                  PHOEBE
                    Listen.  God gives us--  After the 
                    man leaves, women give off a scent.  
                    It s animal.  Men go crazy.
                          (off Vicki s look)
                    And you need to be touched.  Vicki.

                                  VICKI
                    I know.  I do...

      Vicki drinks, watches Lyla dance.  People pairing off.  

      Phoebe leans all the way into Vicki, and her silky top falls 
      open.  No bra.  Her perfect fake boobs are right under 
      Vicki s nose.

                                  PHOEBE
                    If you don t do something soon -- 
                    I ll have to take matters into my 
                    own hands.

                                  VICKI
                    Okay--  What?

      Phoebe gently turns Vicki s face to hers.  And KISSES HER.  
      Full on.  Vicki is shocked, but her body responds and she 
      allows it.  Finally Vicki pulls away.  Breathing hard, spun.  

                                  PHOEBE
                    I ll do you good, Lady.  You help 
                    me.  I help you.  That s what 
                    friends are for.

      Phoebe smiles, moves off.  Vicki gets up, shaky.  Sees that 
      GABE is watching her.  Maybe saw the whole thing. 

        Embarrassed, Vicki grabs her coat and bolts for the exit. 



                                      END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    41.


      ACT FIVE



      Gabe follows Vicki as she runs up the stairs.  

                                  GABE
                    Hey! 

      She keeps running.  

                                  GABE (CONT D)
                    You left your keys!

      Vicki stops.  Turns.  Grateful.  Takes the keys.

                                  VICKI
                    Sorry.  Thank you.  

                                  GABE
                    You okay?  

                                  VICKI
                    Fine.  I m just--
                          (then/why not?)
                    Weird night.  And I got kissed.

                                  GABE
                    I saw.  Is that how you roll?

                                  VICKI
                    Who knows?  Maybe.  I haven t 
                     rolled  in so long.  But Phoebe?  
                    That just seems...messy.   

      Vicki sits on the stairs.  Gabe sits with her.  Smiles.  

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    You re not married.

                                  GABE
                    No.

                                  VICKI
                    When you are, this invisible wall 
                    goes up.  And on one side are 
                    ballet classes and Legos and 
                    stomach flus and farting and date 
                    nights and dinner parties...  And 
                    on the other side there s bars and 
                    cigarette burns and sexting and 
                    snorting and bisexuals.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    42.

                                  VICKI (CONT'D)
                    And when you re on the farting 
                    side, you kind of stop believing in 
                    the other side.  

                                  GABE
                    But -- here it is.  

                                  VICKI
                    Exactly!  You people have been here 
                    all along!

                                  GABE
                    Sad but true.

      They smile at each other.  A really nice connection.    

                                  VICKI
                            (deflecting)
                    I do this.  I talk to bartenders.  
                    Not that you re not nice...  I just 
                    go in for cliches.  

                                  GABE
                    I m the manager.  But I ll take it.  
                    I like talking to you.

      Vicki looks at him.  She s turned-on, confused.  

                                  VICKI
                    Can I...try something?

                                  GABE
                    Please.

      Vicki leans forward on the stairs.  KISSES GABE.  He moves 
      into it.  Liking it.  It gets immediately hot.  Vicki gasps.  
      Stops.  Then kisses him again.  Then stops, moves to go:  

                                  VICKI
                      That s...how I roll.  Thank you.

                                  GABE
                    Not so fast.

      He takes her hand, pulls her back down.  



      Gabe lets Vicki into his boxy apartment.  It has a balcony 
      that looks over an alley.  Black Ikea type furniture.

      Gabe s ROOMMATE watches TV on the couch, on his computer.                                                                                    43.


                                  GABE
                    Hey Man.  This is Vicki.

                                  ROOMMATE
                    Hi.

      Vicki is starting to rethink this whole thing.  Her PHONE 
      RINGS.  She silences it.  Then:

                                  VICKI
                    Hi.



      Gabe leads Vicki in, turns on a soft light.  His room is full 
      of books.  Has some interesting art.  A nice bed.  

      Vicki stands awkwardly, taking it all in.  He sits on the 
      bed, holds his arms out to her.

                                  VICKI
                    What are we reading?

                                  GABE
                    Come here.

                                  VICKI
                    I...  Just, give me a minute.
                          (then)
                      I ve...it s been a while.  And 
                    you d be my first younger man.

                                  GABE
                    Not that much.  28.
                          (then)
                    I ve never been with a women who s 
                    had children before.  So that s...

                                  VICKI
                    Well, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 
                    being a virgin and 10 being... 
                    throwing a hotdog down a hallway. 
                    I d say I m a 5.  

                                  GABE
                    Good to know.

      Gabe stands.  

                                  GABE (CONT D)
                    I m going to undress you now.
                          (off her look)
                    The sex will be easier.                                                                                    44.


      He takes off her top, leaves her lacy bra on.  He touches her 
      gently.  Looking her over.

                                  VICKI
                    You re a looker, aren t you.

                                  GABE
                    Thank you.

                                  VICKI
                    I mean, eye-looker.  You look at 
                    women with your eyes.

                                  GABE
                    As opposed to what, my elbows?
                          (as he undoes her skirt)
                    I m looking at you.  You re 
                      beautiful.

                                  VICKI
                    I had a--

      Her phone rings AGAIN.  Vicki stops.  

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  Sorry...

      Vicki checks it.  It s LILLY.  He waits.  Eyes on her.  She 
      answers with a helpless look to him, almost whispers:

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    Honey, it s 2 in the morning!  
                          (a beat/embarrassed)
                    Well I m sorry you can t sleep.  
                    No, I haven t decided about Jade s 
                    party.  Oh.  Did you ask Stella s 
                    mom?  I ll call her tomorrow.
                          (then)
                    Okay.  Now sleep.  Love you.

      Vicki hangs up, losing heart.  

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    Teenage drama.  Look, maybe I 
                    should just--

                                  GABE
                    No way.  I am here to give you the 
                    younger man experience.

      He slowly lowers her skirt.  She has a c-section scar, which 
      he traces lightly.                                                                                      45.


                                  GABE (CONT D)
                    Great scar.

      She s in just her bra and undies.  Feeling very raw.

                                  VICKI
                    I think -- I m kind of... natural 
                    for guys now.  Down there.

                                  GABE
                    Oh, God.  That s...  I like that.

                                  VICKI
                    You do?

                                  GABE
                    A bush.  Yeah.

      He s getting really turned on.  He kisses her deeply.  She 
      warms to it, pushes into him.  It s on.

                                  VICKI
                    I m really hairy.

      He picks her up and throws her on the bed.



      Now Vicki and Gabe are having sex (tastefully shown,  natch).  
      She s practically delirious.  They are having a blast.

                                  GABE
                    For your information, you re a 2, 
                    maybe a 1...

                                  VICKI
                    It feels SO GOOD.

                                  GABE
                    Um hum...  The balls.

                                  VICKI
                    What?  

                                  GABE
                    Balls.  Touch them.

                                  VICKI
                    Oh.  Sorry.

      She reaches down.  He moans.  They move together, building 
        intensity...  It s working for both of them.                                                                                      46.


                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    Ummm.  Yeah...  Oh, Jake--

      She stops.  Frozen.  Horrified.

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    I am so, so--

                                  GABE
                    Forget it.  I m fine.

                                  VICKI
                    Habit.  I--

                                  GABE
                          (laughs)
                    Do you mind?  I m busy here.

      He keeps at it.  Vicki tries to get back into the mood.  Gabe 
      is oblivious and they continue.



      Much later.  They lie together, spent and smiling lazily.  
      Eyes closed.  A long silence.  Then:

                                  VICKI
                      Incredible.

                                  GABE
                    Yeah it was.

                                  VICKI
                    I mean, it s been so long you could 
                    have just put it in and not moved 
                    at all and my mind would have been 
                    blown.  Don t get a big head.  

                                  GABE
                          (laughs/then)
                    We did go more than once.

                                  VICKI
                    You re 28.  You probably had seven 
                    orgasms already today.

                                  GABE
                    I like this.  I like the way you 
                    bust my balls.    

                                  VICKI
                    I more just grabbed them and held 
                    on for dear life.                                                                                    47.


                                  GABE
                    You did good.  You were great.
                          (a beat/then)
                    You think you can?  Stay married?

      Vicki considers.  Then:

                                  VICKI
                    He found these e-mails.  Between me 
                    and somebody else.  This man.  

                                  GABE
                    Were you in love?

                                  VICKI
                    It was...intense, never physical.  
                    This guy had a way with words.   
                          (then)
                    It s easy to get carried away when 
                    nobody s arguing about who gets to 
                    sleep in...who s life is harder.

                                  GABE
                    You dazzled that guy.

                                  VICKI
                      I wouldn t go that far.

      Gabe closes his eyes again.  Falling asleep.  But smiling.

                                  GABE
                    I would.

      Vicki s eyes stay wide open.  She s pained, remembering:

                                  VICKI
                    It was stupid.  I think maybe I 
                    wanted to get caught.  Anything but 
                    go on the way we were...  

      Gabe just says, half awake:

                                  GABE
                    I want to cook for you.  Can you 
                    hang out tomorrow?



      Vicki moves quickly for the door.  Gabe, naked, follows her.

                                  GABE
                    Stay.  You had a lot to drink.                                                                                    48.


                                  VICKI
                    I m fine.  

                                  GABE
                    How do I get in touch with you?

      Vicki stops.  Searches.  Then opens the door.

                                  VICKI
                    Let s just...let it happen.  

                                  GABE
                    What does that mean?

                                  VICKI
                          (to roommate)
                    Bye.

      We see now that the roommate is still on the couch.  He nods.  
      Vicki looks at Gabe, melts a little.

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    Thank you.

      But then she bolts.  Gabe is spun.  What just happened?



      Vicki, parked, sits behind the wheel, reeling.  She laughs, 
      shakes her head.  She just did that.  She pulls out her 
      phone.  There s a text from Lyla--

      It reads:   So????? 

      Vicki impulsively dials Lyla.  After a few rings, she 
      answers.

      INNERCUT WITH LYLA:

      Still mostly asleep,  She s in bed with POPPY, her bulldog.  
      Poppy s splayed on the bed, head on a pillow, like a very 
      furry person. 

                                  LYLA 
                    You okay?

                                  VICKI
                    Good news.  My vagina is not dead 
                    after all.  It was just in a coma.

                                  LYLA 
                    Ummmm.  Congratulations.                                                                                    49.


                                  VICKI
                    I said Jake s name.  Twice.  It s 
                    like, a third of my sex vocabulary, 
                    right next to  God  and  Baby.    
                          (emotional)
                    Can t just shake it off, huh?  All 
                    those years.

                                  LYLA 
                    Nope.  Sweetie?  It s 5am.

                                  VICKI
                    It is?  Oh -- shit.  

      She looks at the dash clock.  Then pulls out -- speeds off.



      Vicki rushes in.  Their NANNY, ANA, is putting on her shoes.  
      Vicki looks frazzled, hung over.  Total  walk of shame. 

                                  VICKI
                    Ana.  I am so, so sorry-- 

                                  ROSA
                    Mr. Jake, he just came in.

                                  VICKI
                    No.  He did?  

                                  ROSA
                    I told him you said you d let me go 
                    at midnight.  After midnight is 
                    double.  



      Vicki sheepishly enters the bedroom.  Jake is sitting on the 
      side of the bed.  He looks at her.  Upset.  He s no dummy.

                                  VICKI
                    Hi.

      She sits.  Back to him.  Starts to undress, says with a 
      forced light tome:

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    So -- weird time...  But about the 
                    book signing today--                                                                                    50.


                                  JAKE
                          (hard)
                    Was it him?

                                  VICKI
                    Who?
                          (gets it)
                    Oh God, him?  No.  I told you -- it 
                    wasn t like that.

      Jake stands, agitated.  

                                  JAKE
                    I can t do this any more.

                                  VICKI
                    I know.  But the shrink says--

                                  JAKE
                    Screw the shrink.  There s no way 
                    is this good for any of us!

                                  VICKI
                    Shhh--

                                  JAKE
                    Sneaking in, having sex with other 
                    people.  You did, you screwed 
                    somebody, right?  

                                  VICKI
                    Jesus.  You want to get into this?  
                    Really?!  Who are you going to bang 
                    now that Gossip Girl is off the 
                    air, Jake?

                                  JAKE
                    After we were separated.  You were 
                    the one who--

                                  VICKI
                    I never touched him!

                                  JAKE
                    It was worse.  You felt for him, 
                    you confided in him--

                                  VICKI
                    Because he listened!  He didn t 
                    feign interest while he surfed the 
                    net.  He didn t take a dump in the 
                    middle of me pouring my heart out--                                                                                    51.


                                  JAKE
                    That happened once.  Jesus--

                                  VICKI
                    You checked out.  I asked you, I 
                    begged you, talk to me, make love 
                    to me--

                                  JAKE
                    I was tired!

                                  VICKI
                    For five years!?

      Jake stops.  Then, impulsive, he starts unbuttoning his 
      shirt. 

                                  JAKE
                    You want me to make love to you.  
                    Let s go.

                                  VICKI
                    Jake--

                                  JAKE
                    No.  I m serious.  We ve talked and 
                    talked and talked.  It s getting us 
                    nowhere.  Let s just do it.

                                  VICKI
                            (balks/then)
                    Is this a man thing, like, somebody 
                    else pissed on me so now--

                                  JAKE
                    Shut up.

      He grabs her.  Kisses her.  She s spun, trying to go with it. 

                                  VICKI
                    Jake--

                                  JAKE
                    Take off your dress.

      She starts to fumble with her zipper.  But he pushes her down 
      on the bed before she can get very far.  There s an urgency, 
      a desperation as he grabs at her.

      His hand goes up her dress.  She moans, arches.  But it s 
      forced.                                                                                    52.


      He kisses her again.  She turns her head, moaning.  Her eyes 
      are closed, and she winces as he fondles her breast.  She is 
      tolerating this.  Trying...  

      Jake feels it -- getting angry, he goes for another kiss.  
      Deep.  Probing.  Vicki finally breaks, pushes away from him.

                                  VICKI
                    I can t.  I can t--

                                  JAKE
                    Jesus Christ--

                                  VICKI
                    I m sorry.  I m so sorry.  

                                  JAKE
                    You look like your skin is 
                    crawling.  Is that how it is now?

                                  VICKI
                    I -- It s not your fault.

                                  JAKE
                    Your skin is crawling?!

                                  VICKI
                    I m sorry.  Let s make an 
                      appointment.  With the shrink--

                                  JAKE
                    We can t talk without doctors now?  
                    No!

                                  VICKI
                    I -- I don t want to say anything 
                    we can t take back--

                                  JAKE
                          (pained)
                    Why not?  Are you fighting for us 
                    because it s what you want?  Or 
                    because you can t admit we failed.

                                  VICKI
                    That s not fair--

                                  JAKE
                    You sell answers!  You re the 
                    answer lady.  And you sold us as 
                    this great family.  Who s going to 
                    want your advice now?                                                                                    53.


                                  VICKI
                          (genuine)
                    I don t sell -- I write about what 
                    I love.  I loved us.  I did.  

                                  JAKE
                    Oh, screw you and your past tense.  
                    We re done.  It s over.  

                                  VICKI
                    And then what?  Two houses, kids 
                    shuttling back and forth, lawyers 
                    and -- I don t want that life--

                                  JAKE
                    Too bad.  You made your bed--

                                  VICKI
                    Don t put this on me.  I m here!

                                  JAKE
                    With your skin crawling--

                                  VICKI
                    And yours isn t?  You couldn t get 
                    out fast enough once you had an 
                    excuse.  Is this what you wanted 
                    all along?  The stupid car and the 
                    stupid jeans -- or is all the new 
                    pussy, making you crazy?

                                  JAKE
                    No, you know what it is?  It s the 
                    old pussy!

      She SLAPS HIM.  Hard.

                                    CHARLIE (O.S.)
                    No mama!  

      Charlie runs in, wraps his arms around Vicki s legs.  Lilly 
      is in the door too.  Freaking out.  Vicki and Jake react.

                        VICKILILLY
      Honey--I knew it!  You guys are 
                                                    getting a divorce!

                                  VICKI
                    We are not getting a--

                                  JAKE
                    Vicki.  Yes, we are.  I m sick of 
                    lying to them!                                                                                    54.


                      CHARLIEVICKI
      You are?!Go back to your rooms, please-

                                    CHARLIE
                    What s a divorce?

                                  LILLY
                    Mom!  I m not an idiot!  Dad 
                    doesn t even live here!

                                  VICKI
                          (stunned)
                    Lilly...  Why didn t you say 
                    anything?

                                  LILLY
                          (scathing)
                    I don t know, mom, I thought maybe 
                    that was your job.  And what are 
                    you wearing?  Is that my top?!  Oh 
                    my God!  

      Lilly bolts.  Vicki tries to go after her but Charlie is on 
      stuck to her leg like a leech.  She lurches out of the room.



                                  VICKI
                    Lilly, stop!  Please, let s--

      Lilly SLAMS the door closed, then SCREAMS with rage and 
        frustration.  Charlie looks up at Vicki.  Sees straight up 
      her skirt from where he clings.  Says to her:

                                    CHARLIE
                    I can see your penis.

      Vicki leans her head against the wall.  Devastated, fighting 
      tears.  Manages:

                                  VICKI
                    It s not a penis, honey.

      Charlie leaps up and pulls his pajama pants down.  Starts 
      running around, kind of hysterical and shouting:

                                    CHARLIE
                    Penis!  Penis!  Penis!  Penis!--

      Jake comes out.  Stands at the doorway.  Wrecked.  

      They just look at each other.                                                                                      55.


      OFF Charlie s frantic yelling -- and the sound of Lilly 
      breaking things in her room.  Glass shattering...



                                      END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                    56.


      ACT SIX



      Vicki stays in the car this time.  Sunglasses cover her red 
      eyes.  She s dressed in stuff she found on the floor.

      She reaches for Lilly as a carpool dad opens the door for the 
      kids.  Lilly jerks away.  Bails.

      Charlie lets Vicki kiss him.  

                                    CHARLIE
                    Mama -- next year when I m Special 
                    Person, will you and daddy both 
                    come?  Or do I have to do it twice?

                                  VICKI
                          (ouch)
                    Just once, honey.  Daddy and I will 
                    still do lots with you, I promise.   

      Charlie nods, just gets out of the car.

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    I love you--

      But he s gone.  Vicki takes a deep breath.  Sees a FATHER AND 
      MOTHER walking their kid into school, laughing and talking.  
      The kid is skipping along, carefree.   

      Vicki closes her eyes, shutting them out -- too painful.

      A KNOCK on the passenger window makes her jump.  It s the 
      HANDSOME DAD, PAUL, she passed in the hall a while back.  Not 
      the douche bag.  The guy you barely noticed.

      Vicki rolls down the window.  

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    I can t talk.

                                  PAUL
                    Are you okay?

      Vicki looks at him.  Almost laughs.                                                                                    57.


                                  VICKI
                    Besides being an emotional 
                      adulteress, a horrible parent and a 
                    fraud?  I m fabulous.

                                  PAUL
                    Yeah.  Me too.

      They look at each other.  The longing is palpable.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    Let me e-mail you at least?  I miss 
                    you.

                                  VICKI
                          (shakes her head  no )
                    I m late.

      He nods.  She rolls up the window.  He just stands there, 
      watching as she drives off.



      Phoebe sits, legs crossed, meditating as a handsome stylist 
      gives her a blow out.  Her eyes suddenly open:

                                  PHEOBE
                            (inspired/to stylist)
                    Do you want your own blow dry bar?



      Lyla s corner office is impressive.  Outside her glass walls 
      we see a buzzing law office.  Lyla s on the phone:                                                                                    58.


                                  LYLA
                    I tried, Buvajon, but you can t put 
                      a 10-year-old on a diet, it gives 
                    them a complex.  Mama...  Mama..  I 
                    have to go.  I m hanging up.  Now.  
                          (switches lines)
                    Phoebe?  Have you heard from Vicki?  
                    She s not picking up her phone.  I 
                    know.  Okay.  Yes.  Barnes and 
                    Noble.  I can pick you up--

      Lyla stops as her PANICKED ASSISTANT runs to her door.

                                  ASSISTANT
                    I m so sorry.  I tried to stop..it.

      CLOSE ON

      Black thigh-high boots.  A riding crop.  Fishnets.

      REVEAL

      MISTRESS JOSIE JAX, 6 2  in spiked heels, dark-haired, 
      pierced -- striding down the hall in a latex mini-dress.  

      She walks right into Lyla s office, drops some papers on the 
      desk.  Then she raises a fish-netted leg and plants her shiny 
      boot right in front of Lyla s face:

                                  MISTRESS JOSIE
                    My former butt-boy Dan retained me 
                    to tell you -- he s suing you for 
                    half your pension and full custody.  
                    And that you re paying for my hour 
                    today.
                          (gets in her face)
                    Lick the boot, bitch.

      Lyla s co-workers GAPE as Mistress Josie goes, turning and 
      giving Lyla a parting view of her perfect ass.  

      OFF LYLA -- stunned.



      An ugly women s bathroom.  Vicki stands at the mirror, 
      dressed elegantly, trying to fix her hair and make-up.  But 
      her hands are shaking.  She s on the verge of a panic attack.

                                  VICKI
                    This isn t happening.                                                                                    59.


      She leans on the sink.  Tears coming again, even while she 
      presses her fingers against her eyes to keep them in.

      She grabs her phone.  Texts something.



      Lyla, looking a bit shell shocked, and Phoebe are riding the 
      escalator up to the second floor of the large bookstore.  
      Lyla gets the text.  Says:

                                  LYLA
                    Bathroom.

      The women get off the escalator and dash for the bathroom.



      Lyla and Phoebe rush in, see Vicki dabbing paper towels under 
      her eyes.  Vicki s in a spiral, a 24 hour cry.

                                  VICKI
                    My make-up...  I have to go sell 
                    books.

                                  PHOEBE
                    Oh, Lady...

      Phoebe gathers her into a hug.  Vicki pulls away a bit.

                                  VICKI
                    The kids know.  Lilly knew.  Jake 
                    wants to file.  And I had dirty 
                    naked sex with some guy and then--

                                  PHOEBE
                    Gabe!  Well done!

                                  VICKI
                    I said his name.  I closed my eyes 
                    and it was Jake.  Like, this ghost 
                    was yelling  touch my balls! 

                                  LYLA
                    They were your first balls in a 
                    while.  Go easy on yourself--

                                  VICKI
                    And then this kid was all let s 
                     hang  and  cook .                                                                                      60.


                                  LYLA
                    What a freak.

                                  VICKI
                    What am I going to do?  We can t 
                    afford two houses, two everything.  
                    We barely make it now as it is. 
                          (then)
                    I can t breathe.  

                                  LYLA
                          (digs in her purse)
                    Ativan.  Dilaudid.  Klonopin...  
                    And Valium.  

      Lyla takes a pill and swallows it dry as Phoebe decides:

                                  PHOEBE
                    Klonopin.  
                          (to Vicki)
                    Just half.  Let it dissolve in your 
                    mouth.  It ll work fast.

                                  VICKI
                    What will it do?

                                  PHOEBE
                    Put your problems on a cotton candy 
                    cloud.

      Vicki nods.  Takes it.  Lyla rubs her back.  They look up as 
      somebody comes in.  Busted.  It s KATE, looking sheepish.

                                  LYLA
                          (not unkind)
                    Hey.  Can we have a moment?

                                  KATE
                    Vicki?  What happened?

      Vicki just shakes her head, can t talk.  Kate shows Vicki 
      that she s holding a brand new copy of Vicki S LATEST BOOK, 
      although we don t see the title.  Kate says a little lamely:

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    I -- came to get this signed.  

      Vicki nods, starts to cry all over again.  Both Lyla and 
      Phoebe immediately apply paper towels under Vicki s eyes.  
      Kate moves to Vicki and they hug tightly.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    I m such an idiot.  
                          (then)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    61.

                                  KATE (CONT D)
                    The more you told me what was going 
                    on, that you guys were on the rocks-

                                  VICKI
                    You and Mark are solid.  You won t 
                    catch it, I promise.

                                  KATE
                    No -- Vicki.  Sometimes when the 
                    kids are being awful, shitty little 
                    people...  And then Mark is never 
                    home, and when he is he acts like 
                    he s doing me a favor.  And you re 
                    free and you ve got these new 
                    friends with new boobs, which they 
                    don t need permission for...  What 
                    scares me is feeling like maybe I 
                    want to catch it. 

      Before the women can react, CAT enters.  Sees the gaggle of 
      women surrounding Vicki.

                                  CAT
                    Quite a picture.  You ready?

                                  LYLA
                    She needs one more minute.

                                  CAT
                    One.  It s a full house.  Where s 
                    Jake?

                                  VICKI
                    Oh.  He s not coming.  Sorry.

      Cat shoots her a look.  Then:

                                  CAT
                    I do care about what s going on 
                    with you two.  But not right now.  
                    Get him on board, babe.

      She ducks back out.  Vicki looks at Kate, panicked.

                                  VICKI
                    Oh my God--

                                  KATE
                    Don t worry about me.  Go.

                                  VICKI
                    How can I?  I m a liar.                                                                                     62.


                                  KATE
                    Then go out there and be honest.  
                    That s why people love you.

                                  LYLA
                    And then the book tanks.  This is 
                    business, not group therapy.  Lie.  
                    Lie your ass off.

      PUSH IN ON VICKI as she nods, dries her eyes.  But she still 
      looks like a deer in the headlights.

                                  ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                    ...such a treat to have her here!  
                    Please welcome the author of 
                      Girlfriend s Guide to Pregnancy and 
                    The Girlfriend s Guide to Toddlers! 
                    Vicki McCarthy.

      We hear applause as we PULL OUT and see:



      Vicki s face, SMILING BIG NOW.  

      It s her picture on a poster announcing her new book:   The 
      Girlfriends Guide to Getting Your Groove Back: How to Love 
      Your Husband and Family Without Losing Your Mind 

        A good-sized group of women and a few men sit in folding 
      chairs clustered around a small podium, where Vicki stands. 

      There are also a few photographers and journalists scattered 
      around.

      Vicki S POV

      Everything looks a little tilty and odd.  

      ON VICKI

      Blinking.  Something s not right.  But the show must go on.  
      She looks at Lyla, Phoebe and Kate.  Very sincere:

                                  VICKI
                    First of all...  I d like to say...  
                    Thank you.  To my incredible 
                    friends.  New and old.  

      Vicki s slurring a bit.  Lyla, Phoebe and Kate react.

                                  KATE
                    What s happening?                                                                                    63.


                                  PHOEBE
                    You re sure you gave her the 
                      Klonopin--

                                  VICKI
                    And we re actually...  Phoebe 
                    showed us her boobs so -- we re 
                    close.  
                          (audience laughs/then)
                    Okay.  I have to...  Get it 
                    together here.

      She looks at her book on display.  Considers.  Then:

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    I think, maybe, my book can help 
                    you.  Get your groove on...  
                          (then)
                    And, you know, I believed it all 
                    when I wrote it.  But now I just 
                    think, what a pile of horseshit, 
                    you know?  It should have been 
                    called  Not in Love Anymore?  You 
                    Can Stay Married! 

      Lyla and the others react.

                                  LYLA
                    Uh oh.  Maybe it was oxy.  

                                  VICKI
                    I mean, seriously, this chapter: 
                     This is Your Life, so Get Used to 
                    it.   It was a joke, I know.  But 
                    screw that.  You deserve more than 
                    that.  I deserve more than that.  
                          (then/pained)
                    I just -- women can be funny.  We 
                    love so intensely.  We want so 
                    much.  But when our heart shuts 
                    down...  Boom.  You can t open it 
                    again with a blow torch.  I mean, 
                    this book can work for you if you 
                    still feel something...  
                          (then)
                    Honestly.  I wasn t trying to sell 
                    you a lie, I was trying to sell 
                    myself one.  I mean -- there were 
                    times when I d watch him sleeping, 
                    and I d think  if he d just die, it 
                    would be so much easier.   You 
                    know?

      REVERSE ON THE AUDIENCE                                                                                    64.


      Silence.

      They re just staring, stunned.  All these nice women in their 
      cardigans and JCREW capri pants.  

      Lyla, Phoebe and Kate are also in various states of shock and 
      awe.  

      Vicki notices one older woman with her CAMERA IN VIDEO MODE.  
      She recorded the whole thing.  The woman lowers the camera, 
      her face a mask of betrayal.  

      A long awful moment.

      Vicki realizes, too late, she just said that all out loud.  
      She pastes on a self-mocking smiles.  Says, too sunny:  

                                  VICKI (CONT D)
                    So.  Anybody want their book 
                    signed?

      Nothing.  Vicki nods.  

      Then she simply WALKS off the stage, gets on an ESCALATOR 
      that leads down two flights to the bottom of the huge atrium 
      style building.  

      Kate, Vicki, Phoebe move to the railing that looks over the 
      escalator and the floors below.  They re followed by a bunch 
      of women from the reading.

      CLOSE ON VICKI

      She looks calm, head held high.  A burden lifted.  Then, 
      SMACK!  Something falls right at:

      VICKI S FEET

      It s HER BOOK, splayed on the floor like a suicidal jumper.  
      A beat.  Then she steps OVER it and LEAVES THE STORE.

      LYLA, KATE AND PHOEBE react to the dramatic exit.  Then:

                                  LYLA
                    She should have lied.
