Large rushes through throngs of people on their lunch break.
He manages to avoid eye contact with all of them as he tries
to find an address while checking a piece of paper.
He boards an outdoor escalator and starts climbing thL-
stairs.

After a moment he looks to his right through a window into a
gym where a man on a Stairmaster is walking alongside him.
Large registers something: he isn't going anywhere.
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal he's been walking up on the
down side. He stands still and lets it bring him all the way
down, where he moves to the "Up" one and rises towards the
next level. His expression never changes.
Large pulls his car into a parking spot, throws "The Club" on
his steering wheel and heads towards the back door of the
restaurant. But something catches his eye on the side of his
car.
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL: a gasoline pump nozzle
sitting in his gas tank with a foot of tattered hose ripped
off at the end. He stares at it, trying to remember the last
time he bought gas. He looks both ways and covertly pulls the
nozzle from his tank.
He walks towards the back door of the restaurant and throws
the nozzle in an open dumpater.
A large group of people are gathered around a steel coffin.
Atop the coffin site a framed picture of a tired looking
woman in a wheelchair. This is SARAH LARGEMAN.
We find SYLVIA LARGEMAN, the source of the music. CLOSE ON
HER FACE as the assorted palette of colored make-up on her
cheeks swirls together with tears until it collects on the
tip of her chin and drips like a leaky faucet onto:
HER LYRICS SHEET as a rainbow of tears splatter the words
"ONCE and "TWICE".
The song finishes and the rabbi begins a series of Hebrew
prayers. Large squints through the mourners to see his father
GIDEON LARGEMAN shovel a handful of dirt onto the casket.
Behind him stands CYNTHIA DILLARD, 25, a beautiful young
Black woman.
HIS FOCUS RACKS TO REVEAL two young men seated on a rusty
tractor smoking cigarettes about thirty yards behind the
ceremony.
WE JUMP CUT TO after the ceremony as Large weaves through the
crowd and approaches the two men. We see now they are HA-RKs
26, good looking in a dirty way. And DAVE, 26. They are quite
filthy, but each sports expensive jewelry and black
yarmulkes.
They look up as Large approaches.
MARX
HOLY SHITS
LARGE
T'sup.

DAVE
Holy shit!
MARK
Largeman, what the hell are you

LARGE
(EMBARRASSED)
Oh... uh that's my mom.

Well... welcome home-

You're like still acting and shit,

LARGE
Yeah.
DAVE
In LA right?
LARGE
Yeah.
MARK
That's cool. I hear that place is
pretty tucked up, man. I got a
cousin who's a writer out there. He
says that place is mad crazy. Coke
everywhere, parties, horny-ass
bitches...
DAVE
Who?
MARK
What?
9
DAVE
Which cousin?
MARK
Terry.
DAVE
Terry's in LA? I thought he was
gettin' his GED down in Newark.
MARK
No bitch, he's in LA now. He's a
writer. He's writin' a movie about
snowboarders or some shit, X don't
know. I should introduce you to him
Largeman, maybe you guys could do
something together.
LARGE
Great.
DAVE
So what are you doin' tonight, man?
LARGE
Nothing... no plans. I'm just here
for a couple days... nothing.
DAVE
You should come out with us, we're
gonna head over to the Gleason's
house. He's having some huge
fuckin' party tonight or something.
MARK
Supposedly.
DAVE
Supposedly.
LARGE
Really?
MARK
Yeah, he lives up on the hill.
We're probably gonna head over
there right after we bury your mom.
DAVE
Well I gotta shower.
MARK
Same.
LARGE
Okay, well... You know I'll have to
see with all this... this.
MARK
All right. Well, welcome back.
10
DAVE
Peace.
Large heads back to his car. The crowd has dispersed.
Large flies through the suburban sprawl without a helmet. THE
MUSIC BLASTS.
The wind throws his hair back as Large whips through the back
roads. He's going really fast. He closes his eyes, flying by
a COP CAR doing eighty before he opens them again. LIGHTS
FLASH behind him as he pulls over.
LARGE
Fuck.
The cop car stops behind him and blares him with the search
light.
COP
Hands on your head, please!
LARGE
What?
16
COP
I said PUT YOUR MOTRERFUCKING HANDS
ON YOUR FUCKING HEAD PLEASE!21
Large does it. All we can see is a silhouette of a figure
standing amidst the blaring lights and swirling blue and red
colors.
COP (CONT'D)
Eighty-two in a twenty-five. Are
you gonna tell me your late or just
tired?
LARGE
I didn't...
COP
Shut the fuck up.
(BEAT)
You could have killed some little
kid or a baby deer.
He saunters closer.
COP (CONT'D)
You do have a license don't you.
Large takes it. out and passes it behind him, squinting. When
the COP gets it, he steps finally into the 1 ght. He's a
skinny kid, maybe 23, with a baby face!
COP (CONT'D)
Largeman?
Large squints?
LARGE
Kenny?
KENNY
Holy shit: How you doin' man?
LARGE
Great!
KENNY
Your mom just died.
LARGE
I know.
KFNW
I mean that's why you're home.
LARGE
Yeah... yup.
(BEAT)
You're a cop, Kenny?!
17
KENNY
I know, I know.
LARGE
Why, Kenny?
KENNY
I don't know; I couldn't think of
anything better to do. And it's
really cool though, man. People
really listen to you. They have to.
And check this shit out.
He pulls his gun out of his holster to show Large.
KENNY (CONT'D)
(POINTING)
That's the safety. Plus the
benefits; if I get shot I'm rich.
LARGE
Yeah but, I mean... Kenny, the last
time I saw you, you were blowing
coke lines off the top of a urinal.
KENNY
I had to grow up now, man, I wasn't
makin' shit at the fish market. No
one knew who I was. I couldn't get
laid. This is a much better
situation for me. Speakin' of
which, how did I do?
LARGE
What do you mean?
KENNY
I mean you know... how did I do?
LARGE
You mean like... as a... cop?
KENNY
Yeah.
LARGE
I don't know. I mean I thought, you
were a dick... so I guess that's
good.
KENNY
Ah fuck, man. I hear you're like
some huge movie star; you played
some big football player or
something. I didn't nee it.
LARGE
Yeah.
IS
KENNY
Fuckin' DeNiro and shit.
LARGE
What?
KENNY
fie ' s awe some .
LARGE
Yeah.
KENNY
Deer Hunter. We should talk, man; I
have some good ideas for movies,
and you could like play me and
shit. "Stories From the Force-"
LARGE
Yeah, definitely.
They stand there; nodding.
KENNY
So what are you doin' tonight?
LARGE
That depends, are you arresting me?
Kenny laughs.
KENNY
Shut the fuck upf Course not.
(BEAT)
But you got to put your helmet on,
man; leading cause of death on the
highway for males in our age
bracket.
LARGE
Okay.
KENNY
Wanna see my kid.
He shows Large a picture in his wallet.
LARGE
You got a kid, too? Wow.
KENNY
Everybody's got kids now, man;
they're great. It's like your own
"Mini-Me"; way better than my cats,
LARGE
(RE2 PICTURE)
Cute. Gold teeth?
19
KENNY
Wellthiswas Halloween. He was
"OL'DirtyBastard." Yeah, already
likesraplike his dad. So what
d'yousayyou were doin' tonight?
LARGE
I think I'm gonna meet Mark and
Dave over at some party.
KENNY
The Gleasons?
LARGE
Yeah, I think.
KENNY
can you believe that kids havin' a
party at that house? His brother
hung himself like two weeks ago in
his bedroom.
LARGE
Really?
KENNY
Cut him down myself. Seth. Did you
know him?
LARGE
I don't think so.
KENNY
He tried like three times. Finally
got what he wanted.
(BEAT)
Anyway... So okay, you get going,
I'll see you over there in a bit.
LARGE
Oh, you get off soon?
KENNY
No. But we'll be by to bust it up
by two. if it's crowded we might
get to wear riot gear.
LARGE
Oh, that would be great... to see
that. So I guess I'll see you then.
KENNY
Great seeing you, man.
LARGE
Yeah. You too.
Benny gets in his car and pulls up alongside Large. He picks
up the CB and the PA CRACKLES on:
20
KENNY
(OVER PA)
Pull over, the vehicle!
Kenny nods his head up and down to Large like "Isn't this
cool?" Large waves goodbye. Kenny floors the cop car and
BLARES the SIREN with LIGHTS FLASHING as be SCREECHES away.
CUT TO:
Large drives out of the parking lot. There, seated at the bus
stop is Sam bobbing her head to music- She wears a backpack
and holds an odd looking helmet in her hand.
He pulls up alongside her.
LARGE
Why were you really there?
SAM
Charging. I'm a robot.
LARGE
Do you lie a lot?
SAN
What do you consider a lot?
LARGE
Enough for people to call you a
liar.
SAM
People call me lots of things.
LARGE
Is one of them "liar"?
SAM
I could say "no", but how will you
know I'm not lying.
LARGE
Because I`ll choose to trust YOU.
SAM
You can do that?
99
LARGE
I can try.
SAM
Who's bike is this?
LARGE
It was my grandfather's. It was the
only thing he left to anyone in my
family and he left it to me. And I
like it.
SAM
This is the point where you ask me
if I'd like a ride home?
LARGE
It is?
SAM
Yup.
LARGE
Would you like a ride home?
SAM
Fine, but I ' m not getting in that
sidecar,
LARGE
Why not?
SAM
Sidecars are for bitches. Anyone
who gets in that thing is
automatically your bitch. Thus, I
will ride on the back.
She climbs on the back behind him.
LARGE
(re: the helmet)
What are you like... a hanglider?
They drive off.
EXT NJ STREET/MOVING---DAY
SAM
I thought my boyfriend was gonna
pick me up on his bike, so I
brought it... But then he couldn't
so...
LARGE
So what, it's like one of those
tandem things?
45
SAM
No, its a Ninja. Way faster than
this thing.
LARGE
But what kind of helmet is that?
SAM
You can use it on a motorcycle.
Anyway, how's your head?
LARGE
I should live through the day.
SAM
Cool. Make a right here.
They stop at a light.
LARGE
Are you doing anything right now?
SAM
Can you elaborate on "doing
anything"?
LARGE
Well, I just had this idea. I
promised this guy I'd stop by his
house that's right up here, but I
don't really wanna stay very long.
So I was just thinking if you came
with me I could say I have to take
you home when I'm ready to go.
SAM
Wow. well that's pretty damn random
of ya, Andrew.
LARGE
I know.
SAM
'Nice to meet you. May I use you?'
That's the Hollywood in ya I guess.
LARGE
No, it's not like that, c'mon.
It'll be fun. I promise.
(BEAT)
I'll tell you what. We'll have like
a signal. When you pull on your ear
that's the code and then I'll say,,
"Well I've got to get her home
now." And then we'll go.
She mulls it over.
0
4
SAM
Can we have code names too?
LARGE
If you'd like.
SAM
okay. But don't try and like
kidnap me or anything, because my
step-uncle's a bounty hunter and I
could have you tracked and killed.
LARGE
Liar.
The light changes and they drive off.
The poorly maintained backyard of a mansion: pools,
fountains. Jesse stands shirtless and unshaven holding an
enormous bow and arrow aimed at the sky. The end of the arrow
is on fire. A joint hangs from his lips. Sam and Large look
terrified.
JESSE
'Kay ready?
He unleashes the arrow into the air and the three of them
scramble around in terror trying to avoid wherever it will
land. It plunges into the earth three feet from Sam's foot.
Frozen, she yanks on her ear; hard.
CUT TO:
Sam and Large stand on the front porch of her working class
house.
LARGE
I'll be fine. Am I the first boy
you've ever brought home?
SAM
(YES)
No. But I lied about my boyfriend
driving a t.inja.
LARGE
He doesn't drive a bike?
SAM
No, I don't have a boyfriend.
(BEAT)
He might drive a bike; wherever he
is.
47
LARGE
Well we're off to a great start.
SAM
okay so sometimes I lie. I'm weird,
man. About random stuff too; and I
don't even know why I do it. It's
like a tick. I swear, sometimes I
hear myself say something and then
I think: "Wow, that's not even
remotely true.
LARGE
So how am I supposed to know what's
real?
SAM
Well, I always feel bad and admit
them when they're lies.
(BEAT)
Can you trust that?
LARGE
Open the door.
TNT. SAM'S HOUSE: FOYER -- CONTINUOUS
She pushes the front door open and immediately three enormous
Doberman Pinchers BARK and CLIMB all over Large.
SAM
Down, Kevin! Mom! Kick their balls!
Kick their balls! Anthrax, heel!
Mom!
Sam tries slapping them on their backs.
OLIVIA, Sam's mother, comes rushing in clutching a hamster
with a bloody nose.
OLIVIA
Everybody downl Who wants to eat?
Do you want to eat? Well then get
the fuck off him! Kevin! Steven!
GET OFF[
She smacks their asses and they eventually retreat to the
other room.
OLIVIA (CONT' D)
I'm so sorry, we just don't have
the time to train' em. Who has time
to train'em? When they were
puppies it was cute, but now it's
like having a herd of Clydesdales.
It's just too much.
(MORE)
48
Kevin's the baby, he really just
follows the others but last week
Anthrax and Steven killed a dove
and left him on the front porch. Or
maybe it was a pigeon, he was grey.
'Member that, Samantha?
SAM
Mom, this is .Andrew...
OLIVIA
Welcome, welcome. The place is a
wreck, I'm so sorry. You look very
familiar.
SAM
He's the retarded quarterback.
OLIVIA
Shut up ! Oh my God ! You are the
retarded quarterback. You were so
good on that show. Now I'm really
ashamed. Look at this place. And
I'm wearing sweat pants.
(to Sam, through her
teeth, while nodding at
LARGE)
is he really retarded?
LARGE
No.
OLIVIA
Oh, tell me, what's that Alan
Thicke like? I've heard he's a
cocky son of a bitch.
LARGE
No, he's a really nice guy.
OLIVIA
Oh. Well, welcome, welcome.
Samantha I told you to take the
wheel out of the hamster cage.
She holds up a dead hamster.
SAKI
I forgot, Mom.
OLIVIA
Well you forgot and now Jelly's
dead. Luckily I got peanut Butter
out in time.
(TO LARGE)
We have to get the only hamster on
planet Earth that can't figure out
a stupid hamster wheel. Now the
rest of 'am can't even get a good
sweat going.
(MORE)

49
There's a shoe box on the kitchen
counter. You can do the honors. I
have to run to work.
She sighs and absentmindedly pate her forehead with the
hamster.
OLIVIA (CONT'D)
It was so nice to meet you...
Andrew right?
LARGE
Yes.
OLIVIA
Samantha put the clothes in the
dryer and bury Jelly.
She kisses Sam on the cheek and then she's gone.
They stand there a moment to catch their breath. Then they
both start laughing.
SAM
Come on in.
They walk into the LIVING ROOM.
Rusty leaves fall on a backyard swallowed mostly by an empty
above-ground swimming pool. Sam carries the shoe box as they
walk around behind the pool to reveal
A SMALL GATED PET CEMETERY
About a dozen large rocks serve as tombstones for different
pets.
LARGE
Wow.
SAM
Yeah.
LARGE
I mean this is...
SAM
I know.
They stand in silence.
SAM (CONT'D)
It's not that we're bad pet owners
or anything, it's just that we've
had so many of them over the years.
(BEAT)
Besides some of these are fish.
(BEAT)
Not to say fish deserve less than
other animals, but moat people just
flush them, and we just don't
believe in that. I mean the idea of
flushing something that had life in
it... it just makes me sad, you
know?
(MORE)
56
You gotta honor something a little
more than that, like
"Congratulations, man, you had
life. Here's your trophy; a little
spot in the ground to hang out in."
(BEAT)
Anyway, I'm gonna put Jelly right
here next to "Goliath", the
Rotweiler Titembay backed over
during his driving exam.
She kneels down and begins to dig with a small shovel left
nearby. Large sits down next to her and watches her dig. A
brisk wind makes him hug his knees in for warmth.
SAM (CONT'D)
What are you thinking about?
LARGE
Now?
SAM
Yes.
LARGE
Right now?
SAM
No. A second ago before I asked.
LARGE
Uh... Right now I was thinking... I
was thinking that I've been going
to a lot of these things lately.
SAM
What, dates?
LARGE
No, not dates. This isn't a date.
Is this a date? Funerals.
SAM
Oh. Who else died?
LARGE
(EMBARRASSED)
Uh... that's why I'm home actually.
(BEAT)
Yeah, I uh... I haven't even really
told you that yet, but uh... yeah
my Mom just died.
Sam stops digging and stares at him.
LARGE (CONT'D)
God, it's weird to say that out
loud: 'My Mom died". And uh... eo
that's why I'm home... now.
57
SAM
(SHOCKED)
I'm so sorry. Oh, God I'm so sorry.
(BEAT)
And here I am putting you through
another one. I mean not that
Jelly's even comes close to your
Mom's. .. Although we loved, Jelly--
But still... I'm so sorry. I didn't
know.
LARGE
No, it's okay. It's okay actually.
I'm all right with it. Anyway I
think it's what she wanted so..,
SAM
How did she die?
Large thinks about that.
SAM (CONT ' D)
I'm sorry, I'm so nosey. Forget I
asked, I'm sorry. I just need to
shut--up sometimes.
LARGE
No, its okay. She uh... she
drowned actually.
Sam's jaw drops.
LARGE (CONT'D)
My Mom was a paraplegic; she had
uh... she was in a wheelchair. She
was uh... taking a bath and then I
guess she slipped or something.
That's what they say. I don't know.
But needless to say, she drowned.
And so... that's how she died.
Sam is speechless. Tears well in her eyes.
SAM
When?
LARGE
This was uh... Hmm... Sunday.
SAM
Oh my God.
Tears roll down her face.
LARGE
(with a laugh)
Why are you crying?
58
SAM
I don't know, I'm sorry, I'm not
usually like this. It's just so
sad. It's so tragic. Isn't it? It
is. It's like real life tragedy or
something.
LARGE
Look, let's change the subject,
okay? Let's really bring the focus
back to Jelly. I mean what could be
ruder than talking about someone
else who died while you're in the
act of burying a close friend.
Sam places the box in the hole she's dug.
SAM
What should we do?
LARGE
Well IIve only been to one of these
things,
(re: the other graves)
you appear to be the expert.
SAM
We usually say something.
LARGE
okay, well I'll go first. I didn't
really know you, Jelly. But from
what I hear, you were a good pet.
Had a little trouble with the
wheel...
SAM
its not funny. Jelly you were a
great pet.
Tears roll down her face.
SAM (CONT'O)
I'm so, so sorry I forgot to take
the wheel out of the cage. I'm so
sorry about that.
(BEAT)
Goodbye. I hope that you liked me.
Tears stream down her face as she shovels dirt onto the tiny
shoe box. THE PATTER of the SOIL HITTING the BOX is the only
sound we hear as:
THE CAMERA CRANES UP above them to a bird's-eye perspective
settling on a final frame that looks down on the whole
backyard: the above ground pool, the pet cemetery and in the
bottom right corner, Sam burying as Large watches.
59
A giant rusted yellow tractor sits parked by an open grave-
Large and Jesse lean against opposite tombstones facing each
other.
Mark stands in the open grave STEALING VALUABLES FROM AN OPEN
COFFIN. A small PILE OF JEWELRY sits beside the grave.
MARK
How could you leave all that
Lithium? I was totally gonna hit
you up for some.
FB
JESSE
This fuckin' guy. I'm glad you're
back, man, because this town is so
messed up. Everyone's got there
drug of choice like in "Brave New
World". Did you ever read that
book? Who wrote that? Aldous
something. Aldous-
LARGE
I don't know.
Jesse continues talking, but his voice distorts into WARBLED
NONSENSE AS
SLOW MOTION: LARGE STARES in shock as Mark drops a WEDDING
RING into the PILE OF JEWELRY he's stealing off the corpse.
MARK LOOKS UP AT LARGE STARING AT HIM AND HIS LOOT. THEY HOLD
EYE CONTACT FOR AN UNCOMFORTABLE MOMENT. Large breaks it and
looks away.
REGULAR MOTION:
JESSE (O.S.)
.and people are just like that
here, man. Huxtable3 Aldous
Huxtable. That's it.
A palatial swimming pool in the backyard of Jesse's mans ion.
The Manhattan skyline twinkles far in the distance.
Large, Sam, Mark, Dave, Jesse and a couple of high school
girls from the bar stand in their underwear on the edge of
the pool.
MARK
One, two, three!
Everyone jumps into the pool SCREAMING except for Large. He
stands there staring at the water.
SAM
Hey! what are you doing?
74
DAVE
Largeman, get the fuck in the pool.
GIRL
oh, it's so warm!
SAM
Can you swim?
LARGE
'Course I can swim.
JUMP CUT TO. Large in the shallow-end doing the most pathetic
doggy paddle you've ever seen. Everyone stares in disbelief.
JESSE
Dude maybe you should stay on the
steps; I don't know CPR.
MARK
You look like a drunken beaver.
They all laugh- Sam swims over to him sitting on the steps.
She smiles at him.
LARGE
(in a whisper)
I never learned how to swim.
SAM
Fooled me. I thought you just had a
cramp.
(BEAT)
Or two.
He smiles.
SAM (CONT'D)
(in a whisper)
I can't whistle if it makes you
feel any better.
LARGE
There's a handful of normal kid
things I kinda missed.
SAM
There's a handful of normal kid
things I kinda wish I'd missed.
She floats on her back beside him.
SAM (CONT'D)
So how long are you gonna stay
here?
LARGE
Probably till my fingers get
wrinkly.
75
SAM
(with a laugh)
No, I mean in Jersey.
LARGE
Oh. I think I'll probably head home
the day after tomorrow. well, LA.
That's not my home.
Rer smile fades.
LARGE (CONT'D)
You know that point in your life
when you realize that the home you
grew up in isn't really your home
anymore? And all of a sudden, even
though you have a place where you
put your Shit, the idea of "home',
is gone.
SAM
I still feel at home in my house.
LARGE
You'll gee when you move out. It
just kind of happens one day and
it's gone. And you feel like you
can never get it back. it's like
you feel homesick for a place that
doesn't even exist. But maybe it's
like this rite of passage, you
know? And you won't ever have that
feeling again until you create a
A new idea of "home" for yourself,
for the family you start, for your
kids. It's like this cycle.
(BEAT)
Maybe that's all a family really
is; a group of people who miss the
same imaginary place.
They hold eye contact. The SPLASH of a CANNONBALL swings
their gaze to the others horsing around in the deep end. Sam
leans her head over and rests it on his shoulder.
SAM
Maybe.
GREAT MUSIC PLAYS.
They drive the motorcycle through the Jersey suburbs; Sate on
the back and Mark in the sidecar wearing a lacrosse helmet
and ski goggles.
LARGE'S POV: A mother and her stroller. A huge group of Black
teenagers coming home from school. An old crossing guard. An
ambulance. Two powerwalkere.
OMIT
They walk past stacks of lumber.
MARK
A major loop-hole in the Handi-
World return policy permits returns
without receipts on items below
forty dollars.
LARGE
So how often do you go?
MARK
I hit every employee once, then
wait for them to. hire. new ones.
Luckily, no one works at Handi-
World for very long. Except Karl
Benson.
LARGE
You know, Mark, it's my last day in
town. I have money. I can give you
some.
MARK
I don't need your money, I'm making
my own right now.
LARGE
Or fuck, take Jesse's - the guys a
millionaire.
91
Mark stops and looks at Large in the eyes.
MARK
i don't take anybody's money,
Andrew. I make my own. Favors are
bad news. And the only thing worse
than a favor, is a favor involving
money.
The motorcycle pulls up behind two ambulances being cleaned
with hoses. Large sees Cynthia changing the sheets on a
stretcher. They climb off.
MARK
This will only take a second.
(TO CYNTHIA)
Is Aaron here?
CYNTHIA
LARGE
CYNTHIA
LARGE
This is Sam.
SAM
Hi.
CYNTHIA
Hey.
LARGE `
(re: the stretcher)
Did he live?
CYNTHIA
She... had an eight pound boy.
SAM
You delivered him?
CYNTHIA
Yeah.
SAM
Wow.
CYNTHIA
Yeah.
(TO LARGE)
What are you doing here?
92
LARGE
Mark's picking up something.
CYNTHIA
He's as friendly as always.
The three stand in awkward silence.
CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
Help me with this.
He stands at the other end of the stretcher as she gu des him
through making it.
CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
Grab that one... over... once
more... good. That side... crease
the corner. . .under.. .good. Same
thing on this one... Voila.
LARGE
So were you there?
CYNTHIA
Where?
LARGE
Were you on the call to my uh... to

CYNTHIA
No.

CYNTHIA
Do you wish I was?
LARGE

She loved you_
Mark exits carrying a large gym bag.
MARK
Got it, let's go.
SAM
Nice to meet you.
CYNTHIA
You too.
Sam leaves them alone.
LARGE
I should go.
93
CYNTHIA
(SOFTLY)
Youknow, Andrew, the hour will
comeone day when you atop avoiding
allthe people that love you.And
whenit does I sure hope youcome
findme... 'cause I'd love toknow
whoyou are.
He backs away.
LARGE
You know me enough to know I'd
travel for your funeral right? I
was kidding yesterday; where ever
it was... you know I'd be there
right?
CYNTHIA
Yes.
He backs away and mounts his bike. Cynthia turns to the
stretcher and quickly uses her thumb to swipe a tear,welling
in her eye.
They pull up on the motorcycle.
MARK (V . O . )
Down in Newark, right?
DIEGO (V.0.)
Yeah, its at the bottom of
Hillside and Rivington.
(MORE)
97
You can't really see it from the
street, but it's there. Park your
car at the gate and hop the fence.
They do.
DIEGO (V.O.) (CONT'D)
At the bottom of the quarry there's
this Junkyard run by this guy named
Albert. lie's the one that tracked
down the piece you're looking for.
I'll call him right now and tell
him to expect you.
LARGE
Okay, stop. What the fuck are we
doing?
MARX
Just be patient.
LARGE
Dude, we've been patient all day,
but it's my last day in town and
you haven't told me what the fuck
we're doing. I mean if you told me
we were going on a six hour
scavenger hunt for blow I would
have passed.
MARK
Blow? Please. If I was gonna give
you coke we'd have gone to the high
school football practice and we'd a
been reeling five hours ago.
LARGE
Well I think we've corrupted this
innocent girl enough for one
afternoon.
SAM
I'm not innocent.
LARGE
(getting worked up)
Yes, you are. And that's what I
like about you. And I don't want
this fucking guy taking you to the
bottom of a quarry in a sketchy-ass
neighborhood to find some Pitbull's
raping each other or... crack
whore's huffing turpentine or
whatever it is that you have us
DOINGS
MARK
Wow. That's the most worked up I've
ever seen you.
98
SAM
He was protecting me.
LARGE
So.
SAM
He likes me.
LARGE
Don't be cute.
SAM
You're my knight in shining armor.
LARGE
Don't talk about knights in front
of Mark. It's a sore subject.
MARK
I'm gonna kill that motherfucker.
LARGE
Pun intended?
Beat as Mark gets it. He comes after him.
MARK
You're dead.
They play wrestle as Sam watches.
The three of them reach the top of a small hill to reveal...
AN ENORMOUS ABANDONED QUARRY
Colossal old cranes and construction trucks loom in the
distance like ancient dinosaurs frozen in rust and graffiti.
The center of the quarry goes so deep they can't see the
bottom. They stand on the edge. Rain clouds rapidly drift
overhead. This glace is surreal.
SAM
Wow.
LARGE
I never even knew this was here.
MARK
I've heard about it. They were
supposed to build a mall here I
think.
SAM
Yeah I remember reading about it in
the paper.
(MORE)

99
They were digging one day and they
broke through into this like
natural phenomenon. It's like an
underground Grand Canyon or
something. So now they're in some
huge legal battle over whether they
can build here or not.
LARGE
Can you imagine the guy who's job
it is to fight for the right to
build his mall on some like
geological phenomenon?
MARK
They love their mall's here man.
Okay let's just find this guy and
get outta here.
LARGE
You're not gonna tell us what we're
getting?
MARK
It's a surprise, you'll see.
Mark walks on ahead of them down a path that winds down
alongside the abyss.
Further down the path. Sam looks to Large. He uses an old mop
handle he's found as a walking stick.
As they continue along the path it begins to get continually
cluttered with rusty junk. An old bedframe, a porcelain tub,
remnants of a "Jungle-Gym", dirty broken toys.
Further along down the path amidst the junk they see a THIRTY
FOOT DILAPIDATED SOUSE BOAT perched on cement blocks that
sits right on the edge of the cliff. It's windows glow warm
and welcoming.
Mark stands in front of the boat. This isn't what he
expected. Rain begins to fall.
MARK
I guess this is it.
LARGE
So... knock. Knock and barter for
"Dessert Storm Trading Cards".
MARY
Please don't tease me about my
hobbies. I don't tease you about
being an asshole.
They stand in the pouring rain staring at the boat. Mark
steps up and pounds his fist on the wooden hull.
100
After a moment, ALBERT, a very gentle looking man in his mid-
thirties with a newborn baby asleep on his shoulder appears
on the deck. He smiles warmly-
ALBERT
(in a whisper)
Mark?
MARK
Yeah. Are you Albert?
ALBERT
(with a smile)
Yes. Come on in out of the rain.
Sam and Large look at each other, then follow Mark up an A-
frame ladder that sits next to the hull.
105
THE GREAT MUSIC CONTINUES
SLOW MOTION: Mark, Sam and Large in black garbage bag rain
parkas head up the incline away from the trailer at half
speed.
Large leads them to an old yellow crane that's rusty arm
hangs out over the 'edge. He climbs up onto it's base.
REGULAR MOTION; Large SCREAMS as loud as he can, with
everything he has, like he's emptying himself into the abyss.
Sam and Mark look up at him and climb up alongside Large to
join hint.
The three of them, in their black parkas, with their hair
drenched against their heads, SCREAM as loud as they can,
with everything they have in the POURING RAIN.
FREEZE FRAME: The three of them smiling. A release. A perfect
moment.
UNFREEZE: Sam locks eyes on Large. He stares back at her.
They kiss. He wraps his hands around the back of her head and
they kiss, in the pouring rain, on the edge of something.
CUT TO:
The rain has stopped as Large's motorcycle pulls up in front
of Mark's house. mark gets out of the sidecar.
LARGE
So I don't know if I'm gonna see
you.
MARK
I know. Don't you wanna know what's
in the bag?
LARGE
To be honest, I don't even care
anymore.
Mark pulls out the bag. It practically falls apart it's 80
wet from the rain. He pulls out an ANTIQUE NECKLACE with a
square pendant on it. He puts it in Large's wet hand.
MARK
I'd be lying to ya if I told ya
this was my plan all along.
(BEAT)
But I got it back. That's got to be
worth something, right?
LARGE
This whole day was about this?
106
MARK
(NODDING)
And anyway you didn't want it down
there with her. It's better for you
to have it.
Large shakes his head; he's shocked. Mark backs away, still
wearing his garbage bag parka.
MARK (CONT'D)
Hey, if you ever need a Kato, you
know where to find me.
Large sits back down on the bike into Sam's wet arms. He
stares at the pendant in his hand.
SAM
What is it?
LARGE
It's my Mom's favorite necklace.
FADE TO BLACK:
