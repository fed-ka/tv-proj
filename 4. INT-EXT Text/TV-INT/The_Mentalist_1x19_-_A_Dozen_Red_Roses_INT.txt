      On her COMPUTER SCREEN, Freddie's MUGSHOT pops up.  At one 
      time a looker, with his chiseled jaw and full head of hair, 
      but years of hard living have turned him weathered and grey.  

                                  VAN PELT (CONT D)
                    Wait a minute.  I know this guy.  
                    He's on that beer commercial.  

                                  LISBON
                    What?

                    This Ross guy.  He must be an  *
                    actor, too.  You know that beer 
                      commercial where the guy's in a 
                    toga --

                                  LISBON
                    -- and we're all supposed to be 
                    surprised when it gets caught in 
                    the elevator.

                                  VAN PELT
                    That's him.  Weird huh?

                                  LISBON
                    Yeah.  Should've stuck with his day 
                    job.  You have an address?


      High ceilings, white, cozy, shabby chic slash relaxed beach 
      vibe.  Suitcases still packed, by the front door.  

      Lisbon sits with Hanson's wife, FELICIA SCOTT (40's) and 
      their daughter, SYDNEY HANSON (16).  

      Jane wanders around the room, handling several FRAMED FAMILY 
      PHOTOS.  

      Many of these photos are of Felix with his daughter, Sydney.

      These two women could not be more different.  Sydney, pretty, 
      but a goth/bohemian saddy, hides behind her straggly hair and 
      baggy clothes, while Felicia is a beauty who glows with great 
      purpose and will.  But what they do share is how shocked and 
      heartbroken they are over the tragic news.  Their eyes are 
      red from crying...

                                  LISBON
                    We're sorry for your loss.

                                    FELICIA
                    We've been married nearly eight 
                    years now.  

                                  LISBON
                    Where were you last night?

                                    FELICIA 
                    Palm Springs.  Felix insisted I 
                    take a spa weekend before filming 
                    started.  

                                  JANE
                    And you?

                                  SYDNEY
                    At home.

                                  LISBON
                    Was there anyone in your husband's 
                    life who posed a threat to him?  
                    Someone he didn't feel safe around?

                                    FELICIA
                    No.  There were drug gangs that 
                    used to make threats, but not 
                    anymore.  Not for ages. 

                                  LISBON
                    We found --

                    What is my type? *

      Jane affects sizing her up. *

                    Athletic bad boys with a hidden  *

                    No, that was a bull's-eye.  So what  *
                    did you like about Felix? *

                                  FELICIA *
                    His voice, his self assurance. *
                    Why are these questions relevant? *

                                  JANE *
                    Oh, no reason.  Just curious.
                    We found a bag of marijuana and 
                    various prescription drugs in your 
                    husband's car.

      Felicia turns to Jane, stunned to hear this.

                                    FELICIA
                    What?  That's absurd.

                                  JANE
                    Why?

                                    FELICIA
                    My husband didn't use drugs. 
                    Period.  Someone must have planted 
                    them. 

      Felicia studiously avoids looking to Sydney, so Lisbon and 
      Jane look to her.

                                  SYDNEY
                    I'm straight edge.  Have been for 
                    years.

                                  LISBON
                    Do you know anyone by the name of 
                    Freddie Ross? *

                                    FELICIA
                    No.  Who is that?

      A BEEPING SOUND interrupts them.  Everyone checks their cell 
      phone. 

                                  SYDNEY
                    It's mine.

      Sydney reaches for her purse.  Rummages through...  

      A PHOTO falls out of an address book.  Jane picks it up off 
      the floor.  

      It's a picture of Sydney and a very handsome TEENAGED BOY.  
      Jane stares at it.  Takes note.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)          THE MENTALIST     "A Dozen Red Roses"     BLUE 2/18/09     14.

      But Sydney SWIPES it from his hand, shoves it back in her 
      purse, hiding it from Felicia, who remains oblivious.

      Sydney gives him a pleading look.  Jane lets her off the hook 
      and doesn't ask about the photo.  Sydney finds her cell, 
      reads the text.

                                  SYDNEY (CONT D)
                    Gabriel's assistant.  He wants us 
                    to report to set for rehearsals.

      Felicia sighs, not happy about this.

                                    FELICIA
                    Tell him we'll be there on time.

                                  LISBON
                    I'm sure they'll understand if you 
                    didn't work today.  

                                    FELICIA
                    I would love to back out of the 
                    whole project. With Felix gone, 
                    there's no point.  But the 
                    insurance company is holding me to 
                    my contract.  They won't even cover 
                    any delays.  I don't want to end up 
                    in court.

                                  JANE
                          (to Sydney)
                    Are you working on the film also?

      Sydney gets awkward.  Shrugs her shoulders.  Avoids eye 
      contact.

                                  SYDNEY
                    Kind of.

                                    FELICIA
                    We gave her a small speaking role. 
                    As one of my daughters.  Isn't that 
                    cute?

                                  JANE
                    You want to be an actor?

                    I know it's hard now, but 
                      eventually you might be glad you 
                    were a part of something so 
                    important to your father.

                                  SYDNEY

                    He thought Gabriel had screwed up 
                    the script.  He wanted to back out 
                    of the film.

                    He wasn't happy with the script, 
                    but that's why he met with Gabriel 
                    last night.  To talk it through. 
                    He wasn't backing out.  He might 
                    have threatened to back out, to get 
                    the changes he wanted.  That's how 
                    it works.

                    They say.  Who's they?  Screw they.   *
                    I took some time out to recharge.   *
                    I've been exploring other aspects  *

      Gabriel takes the hit with a grimacing smile, and fesses up. *

                                  GABRIEL *
                    It's been tough.  I've come close  *
                    to taking a TV gig, God help us.   *
                    So yes, I'm anxious for this movie  *
                    to work.  I need it to work. *

                    Hanson's death was awfully  *
                      convenient for you then. *

                                  GABRIEL *
                    Yes it was.  Yes it was.  When you  *
                    told me he was dead, my heart leapt  *
                    for joy.  And then I felt terrible.  *

                                  JANE *
                    And then, you felt pretty good.  *

      Gabriel takes Jane's hand. *

                                    GABRIEL *
                    Listen, I'm an artist.  I'm  *
                    arrogant and self involved and  *
                    dishonest and vain and childish. *
                    But I'm not stupid.  I don't think  *
                    I'm above the law.   *

                      protecting yourself?  That's self 
                    defense.  Justifiable homicide.

      Lisbon and Jane are at the house with Felicia.  Jane peruses

                    Brandon's not a bad kid or 
                    anything, but he's way too old and 
                    way too wild for Sydney.  She uh, 
                    she stole some items from the house 
                    to give to him.  Silly girl.

                    other things.

                                    FELICIA
                    Yes.  It was just some old army 
                    thing Felix liked to keep around.

                    It must be a coincidence.  She and 
                    Brandon would never... No.

                    much, I couldn't put her through 
                    anymore.  Felix found the drugs a 
                    few days ago.  It broke his heart.  
                    Because she had promised she'd 
                    stopped.  He kept hold of the drugs 
                    while we debated what to do.  
                    Whether to have Brandon arrested.

      BRANDON FULTON -- for it is he -- comes through an exterior 
      side door, and creeps through the darkened house.  He's 
      dressed in hip bad-boy clothes and has an air of attractive 
      menace about him.  He has A FORTY-FIVE AUTOMATIC in his hand. 

      From the shadows, BLAAAM!  A stab of flame as a gun is fired

      Sydney enters, terrified.  Felicia is hyperventilating so she 
      can't talk.

                    What happened?  

      She sees Brandon, screams, and kneels beside him sobbing  *

                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Lisbon and Jane speak with a fearful and expectant Felicia as 
      she's measured for a costume...

                                  LISBON
                    No guarantees, but as of now, 
                    there's going to be no charges 
                    pressed against you for shooting 
                    Brandon.  

                                    FELICIA
                    Oh thank goodness.  But is he going 
                    to be alright?

                                  LISBON
                    He'll be fine.

                                    FELICIA
                    That's a relief anyway.  I mean, 
                    I feel terrible, but what was he 
                    thinking, sneaking into our house 
                    with a gun?  What does he say he 
                    was doing?  

                                  LISBON
                    He's still recovering from surgery.  
                    We'll talk with him as soon as we 
                    can.  

                                  JANE
                    The gun he was carrying is the gun 
                    that was used to kill your husband.  
                    It's the gun that Sydney stole from 
                    you.

      Felicia takes a dramatic beat.

                                    FELICIA
                    Oh my God.  But that means...    

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  Sydney may be an accessory to 
                    murder. 


      Brandon lies in bed, bandaged, on a drip, awake but groggy.  
      A UNIFORM COP guards the door.  Cho and Rigsby stand by the 
      bed.

                    Why were you there last night, 
                    Brandon?  What were you planning on 
                    doing?

                                    BRANDON 
                          (weak, but feisty)
                    Before you Nazis shot me?  
                    I was visiting my girlfriend.

                                  RIGSBY
                    We didn't shoot you.

                                    BRANDON
                    Tell that to the judge.  I am suing 
                    your ass big time. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Yeah okay, that's a plan.  But 
                    here's your problem, Brandon.  
                    The gun you were carrying last 
                    night was the same gun that was 
                    used to kill Felix Hanson. 
                    The gun that Sydney stole for you.  
                    That puts both of you in a world of 
                    trouble.

                                    BRANDON 
                    I have nothing to say about that.

                    Did Sydney know?

                                  CHO
                    Did she know that you were going to 
                    use the gun to kill her father?

                                    BRANDON
                    I didn't.

                                  CHO
                    Did she ask you to do it?

                    I didn't kill him.

                                  CHO
                    Brandon, we know you did kill him.

                                  CHO
                    That would be a good reason to kill

                    he had to die, to protect her?

      Brandon starts to speak, but realizes they have been drawing 
      him out, and goes tight-lipped.

                    issues, he said.  Like hell. 
                    He didn't want me out there, being 
                      successful, having other men look 
                    at me and want me. It made him feel 
                    insecure.  I gave up my life to be 
                    with him.  This is my life!  And he 
                    wouldn't let me have it back.

      Felicia throws the script at him and then starts on household 
      objects, so he retreats out the front door.

                    He was suffocating me.  I was 
                      imprisoned by his ego.  It was a 
                    form of abuse.

      Brandon enters.  He just stopped by to see if Sydney was 
      around, but she's not.  He's about to go, but Felicia smiles 
      like a cat and beckons him to come sit with her.  Dazzled, 
      Brandon does what he's told.

                    Brandon came along at a weak 
                    moment.  He, he forced himself on 
                    me, and I let him.  It went from 
                    there.  It just made sense.

      Brandon is mesmerized by this famous sex symbol purring at 
      him.  She puts a hand on his leg, leans forward and whispers 
      in his ear.


      Felicia is now in plain clothes, her hair pulled back, a 
      prisoner, talking to Jane.

                    He did love that daughter of his.  
                    I must give him that.  If only he 
                    could have accepted me for who I 
                    am.  If only he had respected my 
                    needs.  This would never have 
                    happened.

                    Would you do me a favor, Patrick?

                                  JANE
                    I might.

                                    FELICIA
                    Tell Sydney that I'm sorry.  I see 
                    now on reflection that I wasn't as 
                    good a stepmother to her as I might 
                    have been.  And I'm sorry for that.  
                    Though I did try.  I hope and pray 
                    she doesn't become bitter.  I hope 
                    she finds happiness in her life...

                    Because happiness is hard to find.  
                    Once you find it, you better hang 
                    on tight.  Or you might lose it. 

                                  JANE
                    True.

      Looking blindly through the one-way glass, Jane seems to look 
      directly to camera... Lisbon and Sydney leave the room.
