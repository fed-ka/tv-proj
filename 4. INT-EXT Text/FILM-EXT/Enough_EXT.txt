FLASHES:
Wedding photos. Mitch has lots of (surprisingly upper crust)
family, Slim has a few friends. The more photos FLASH, the
more pronounced (and sad), the contrast. FLY RIGHT INTO:
Bacchanalian DANCING. French Champagne has flowed; shoes and
inhibitions were abandoned hours ago. THE CAMERA weaves
through the DANCERS to find:
Slim and Mitch, dancing close, never quite touching, every move
intense, physical, like subtle public sex. Their eyes are
locked; she runs her veil down his body, his hand lightly
touches her ass; they slow down and stand, lips a millimeter
apart but not quite kissing, the sexual tension building...
We see how crazy they are about each other, how completely
physically involved - and how much fun they have.
Watching them is Phil, with Mitch's parents, MRS. TYLER (58,
confident, at ease with her power and family money, and
likeable despite monstrous flaws) and MR. TYLER (someone Mrs.
Tyler married in a moment of cupidity).
MRS. TYLER
Mitch was kind of.. .evasive. Is her
father dead too?
PHIL
Dead to her. He left when she was
two.
MRS. TYLER
Oh. Well, I'm happy to pay for the
WEDDING -
MR. TYLER
Yes, we're very happy -
MRS, TYLER
(ignoring Mr. T.)
It's a way to build bridges... Not
that you can... (repair all the
damage) When there's such a vast
body of water...
11
PHIL
You don't get along with your son?
She gives him a look. She's both offended by, and appreciative
of, his bluntness. Looks out at Mitch:
MRS. TYLER
He's like my father. Which means, I
guess, that he'll do very well.
PHIL
He's done well to get Miss Slim.
MRS. TYLER
Yes, he has, hasn't he? He's married
down, but he's gotten value.
As Phil reacts, he notices his wife, SALIMA, has joined him.
With her are two kids (5 and 2).
Salima's looking out at the floor: not at Slim, but at Ginny
and her dance partner. We see a thought cross her mind. She
bends down and whispers conspiratorially to the kids.
They whoop their response, run out to Ginny (who looks quite
uncomfortable in her Maid-of-Honor dress).
FIVE YEAR OLD SON
Mom! Mom! Mom! Can we spend the
night at Phil and Salima's house?
Ginny looks over, winks at Salima, and kisses her kids:
GINNY
Don't eat at their ice cream, huh?
They squeal with pleasure and run off.
Ginny turns back, resumes dancing with JOE (24, handsome in a
casual way, a good guy):
GINNY
So this was during college or after?
JOE
During.
GINNY
What was wrong with you?
(off his puzzled look)
I mean-why'd you and Slim break
up?
12
JOE
Oh. Well. I'm terrible in bed.
(lets this hang for a moment
for shock value, then:)
Plus, I don't know: we just sort
of.. . evolved into being friends.
GINNY
Evolution? You were going the
wrong direction, bud.
JOE
That's kinda what .1 thought, but I
guess I was so totally pathetic -
GINNY
Why am I not believing this?
(INTRIGUED)
Can I take you home right now?
JOE
If you've got a sense of humor.
GINNY
My kids are out for the night, and...
JOE
Another thing: I live in Chicago;
women always want the possibility of
LONG-TERM -
GINNY
I didn't propose, huh?
I just want to have...
(looks at him...)
a brief and completely unsatisfying
sexual encounter.
JOE
Hey. I'm your guy.
She pulls him into a kiss, and...well: he's not a bad kisser...
We glide from them to Slim and Mitch, hardly moving. Suddenly:
tender and insecure and almost comic, she looks at him...
SLIM
You sure,you love me?
MITCH
Uh-huh...
13
SLIM
For ever and ever?
He stops dancing. Senses the real issue beneath her questions:
MITCH
You're safe with me, Slim. You're
safe, and it's okay to be happy.
We deserve it.
They kiss. Others stop to watch: how cute. Phil comes over,
waits. When they break:
PHIL
I'm sorry, I gotta get up five
o'clock to buy green beans.
He slips an envelope into Mitch's hand:
PHIL
In my country, it's tradition to
give money to groom. You don't
need it, but...
Slim shakes her head, touched, as:
MITCH
That's very sweet -
SLIM
(HUGGING PHIL)
Thanks for giving me away, okay?
You're the best substitute Dad a girl
could possibly have.
PHIL
No substitute. I am real thing.
She kisses him, and he goes. They look after him.
MITCH
He really loves you.
She nods, not quite picking up how odd his statement is: of
course he loves her; she nicked him to give her away.
Mitch turns her toward him and slips his hands inside the top
of her dress (so the back of his hands touch her breasts; is
this going too far?). He pulls her to him, whispers:
MITCH
You gonna give me babies?
14
SLIM
Oh yeah.
MITCH
How soon?
SLIM
How soon can we get out of here?
He hoists her into his arms and carries her off the floor.
Applause from the GUESTS. It's a grand romantic gesture. You
have to wonder if Mitch is just a little too good to be true...
CUT TO:
CONQUERING HERO
Slim (4 months pregnant) stands'on the walkway leading up to a
large, simple,' beautiful house. Mitch is knocking at the door.
The man who answers the door is 62, white-haired, vigorous.
Looks like he walked out of a Viagra ad.
HOME OWNER
Hello?
MITCH
Hi. We've been driving around,
and my wife has completely fallen
in love with your house.
HOME OWNER
It's great, isn't it?
MITCH
We want to buy it.
The Home Owner's jaw drops as Mitch gestures toward his bulging
WIFE:
MITCH (CONT.)
My wife wants it for our family.
HOME OWNER
(polite but firm)
Well...we're not selling.
MITCH
Sure you are.
15
Mitch hands him a slip of paper. Totally amiable:
MITCH
That's the price. Don't worry, it's
well over-market.
HOME OWNER
(stunned, a little scared)
You... You're out of your mind.
MITCH
I know. That's just it. So before
you say no again, think how miserable
one determined crazy person can make
you. Miserable today, miserable
tomorrow, miserable for every single
day until the day you sell.
We glimpse the Home Owner's will just starting to crumble...
MITCH (CONT.)
Your kids are grown, you'll be
happier in a smaller place.
MOVE OFF the Owner's face... SLOW PAN TO the window of the house
.the SENSE that time is passing... and when we reach the
window, we see SLIM inside. MOVE THROUGH the window...
Remains of a picnic. Slim's playing with their daughter,
GRACIE, now 4. Says something and Gracie laughs. Slim laughs.
IS
Keeps laughing, which really gets Gracie going. Mitch looks
on, tries to join in, but it's forced-and besides that:
they're not even looking at him, not inviting his laughter;
it's all between the mother and child.
So he stops trying. Just watches them. And before his eyes,
they become - for an instant - strangers. As this reaction,
and the subtle hostility it engenders, flicker across his face,
Slim looks up at him -
For one long moment they both seem to acknowledge the gulf
between them...
Then Gracie says something. Slim turns back toward her, the
"girls" are laughing again...and Mitch is not.
CUT TO:
FOUR JAGUARs lined up. At a respectful distance sit an old
Toyota (the maid's car) and a pick-up (the gardener's truck).
Slim parks near the truck.
Her hand moves to the door handle, but she can't bring herself
to open it. She sits... paralyzed, a failure.
In this prolonged pause, Mrs. Tyler bursts out of the house -
MRS. TYLER
You're late, you're late, I was
worried you wouldn't comet
(looks, realizes)
No Gracie?
Slim shakes her head.
Mrs. Tyler is clearly disappointed, but quickly covers it up:
MRS. TYLER
Well then, you and I will have a
girls' luncheon and gossip about
simply everybody!
She's about to hurtle into the gossip when Slim turns her head
and Mrs. Tyler sees (and we see for the first time) the result
of Mitch's brutality: a nasty bruise on Slim's cheek.
Mrs. Tyler's face falls as she realizes what this means.
Underneath it all, she's a warm person; she hugs Slim:
MRS. TYLER
Oh baby. Oh baby, I'm so sorry...
28
HOLD a moment; like a mother-daughter tableau... Her tone
stays sympathetic, not at all accusatory:
MRS. TYLER (CONT.)
What did you do? What'd you
say to him?
Slim freezes. On her sad, shocked reaction -
CUT TO:
THREE 4-YEAR-OLD GIRLS running toward a car, squealing.
They're all blond and adorable, and it takes a moment for us to
realize none of them is Gracie.
Slim sits in her car in the pick-up line. The Four Girls get
in the Volvo station wagon in front of her.
The Volvo pulls out, and Slim moves to the front of the line.
The very hip PRE-SCHOOL DIRECTOR smiles at Slim:
PRESCHOOL DIRECTOR
Your husband got her.
SLIM
What??
PRESCHOOL DIRECTOR (CONT.)
Gracie was totally psyched. I told
him he should do it more often.
Slim nods with feigned casualness and pulls away. Slight smile
frozen on her face.
CUT TO:
She pulls in. No other car there.
30
Ginny, Phil, and Teddy are clustered under a tree, staring at
the house. Waiting. Their VAN is parked down the road.
We expect the front door to open any instant.
It doesn't.
They wait. Casually. Not knowing where Slim was.
But we know. Did something go wrong? Slim was right at the
door.
In a casual way, her rescuers start to wonder.
TEDDY
Maybe she didn't hear the signal.
GINNY
She heard it.
PHIL
No. Teddy's right. She could still
be asleep -
GINNY
She's not asleep, okay? She's coming
out any second.
Phil nods.
They wait.
She does not come out.
Ginny shakes her head, looks at her watch.
34
GINNY
Do it again.
Teddy nods. Cups his hands, coos like a dove...
They wait again.
Beat.
The three rescuers still wait.
Frozen.
Phil shakes his head. We see a baseball bat in his hands.
PHIL
We better go in.
GINNY
It'd be crazy to wake him. If
anything's wrong, she'll flick
the lights. .Right?
Phil nods skeptically, and Ginny herself doesn't seem so sure.
They look at the house-and wait. . .and wait... We want to
scream: "GO IN! GO! SAVE HER!"
Suddenly something. Subtle. Was that A SOUND from inside???
They go on alert. . .step forward... listen more closely...
But hear nothing unusual.
35
Phil. looks at Ginny, shrugs -
Ginny shrugs back -
FLASH OF LIGHT, then darkness. The signal.
They run toward the house -
SCREAM. Slim. Intense horrible spit of sound, replaced by an
even more horrible silence. Deadly silence. CLOSE ON GINNY as
they run: as if we've lost Slim and Ginny's.our new
protagonist. As we near the house, we realize: it's not
silence. There are sounds from inside: almost inaudible THUDS.
Sound of a beating. On Ginny's horrified reaction -
Baseball bat. Phil smashes a window.
They climb through the hole into the house -
Open air market: shops, stalls; yuppie heaven. Slim carries
Gracie on her shoulders. They're with Jog (her old boyfriend,
from the wedding). Horsing around, having a good time, Gracie
eating a pastry. They stop and look out at Lake Michigan.
SLIM
Wow ... whattaya think, Toots?
GRACIE
It's a big ocean!
JOE
Well. It's only a lake, but we
like it.
GRACIE
(nods, stares out...
Can we stay here a while?
CUT TO:
They step out. The restaurant is at the end of a long pier.
Ginny turns skeptically to the overweight Phil -
GINNY
Can you run?
PHIL
Like Michael Jackson!
As they sprint, sort of, toward the boardwalk:
GINNY
It's Michael Johnson, Phil.
PHIL
I know. But I run like Michael
Jackson.
And he kind of does: arms flailing, not quite connected to his
body. Just as when we're enjoying this comic sight -
EXPLOSION behind them -
They're thrown TOWARD CAMERA -
Debris flying everywhere -
They lie on the. ground. Not moving. Are they dead or just
stunned? Slowly they raise their heads. Blink.
Look back at the restaurant:
Starting to go up in flames.
47
Slim walking a crowded street, carrying Gracie; TransAmerica
Pyramid in the b.g. SAN FRANCISCO. Slim goes down an alley
behind a converted warehouse, enters a basement garage.
Slim stands behind Jupiter's building. In the shadows. Still
carrying Gracie. It's only after we hear Gracie -
GRACIE
Don't cry, Mom. Please don't cry.
- that we realize Slim is crying.
GRACIE (CONT.)
You have mtg.
Beat.
CUT TO:
Slim and Gracie climb off the train and are immediately
shepherded away by TWO SWARTHY MEN in Hawaiian shirts -
SLIM
Wait. Wait. What're you...?
Who're you...?
GRACIE
(WORRIED)
Mommy?
One of the Swarthy Men speaks to Slim, but in the flurry, we
can't hear it. She looks relieved, turns to Gracie -
- but before Slim can speak, their bags are thrown in the trunk
of a car and they're pushed into the back seat -
The car speeds off, whips into a left-hand turn -
50
Now the car makes a right-hand turn, and a TRUCK pulls out,
blocking traffic so no one can follow them -
J
Gracie plays as Slim talks to Ginny and Phil. The car's parked
below. Phil gestures toward the Driver, who'e standing guard.
PHIL
.so secret we don't even know who
this man is or where he takes you.
Slim nods.
SLIM
You're not afraid to help me?
PHIL
In my country people bleed their
enemies to death out of their
genitals. A fire? This is for
roasting lamb.
GINNY
No letters, Slim, but you can call
US -
PHIL
Must be very short.
51
Slim nods. Phil ceremonially hands her a thin envelope. She
looks inside... and clearly finds money -
SLIM
No. Phil, wait a minute, I -
PHIL
I have insurance from fire -
SLIM
I know, but -
PHIL
(VERY FIRMLY)
I will not discus, okay?
We are family!
She nods. Gratefully. Ginny takes her hand. Beat.
SLIM
What about the police? The fire.
Do they -
PHIL
Mr. Mitch - of course - he has
beautiful alibi.
Slim nods again. Looks at Ginny...who's been working up to:
GINNY
You know, I keep having a bad idea.
The first time he hit you, we saw
your bruises. Second time, he beat
you unconscious. The next time?
Well. If you should fight back,
defend yourself, and he dies? Who'd
convict you? Who'd prosecute?
PHIL
This is American law??l
GINNY
I called my cousin, he's some shit-
for-brains lawyer over in Tarzana,
he says it's 2-1 she'd walk: self-
defense, justifiable homicide.
SLIM
2? That's good on a race-horse,
Gin, but for Gracie?, to lose both
parents? Besides, this is me, i
couldn't kill anybodyl
52
GINNY
We're talking about Mitch here.
SLIM
Even so. I'm not that kind of
person, okay?
Ginny nods reluctantly. She's not sure the subject is closed.
CUT TO:
NEW LEAF
FLASHES (LIKE THE CREDIT SEQUENCE)
MICROFICHE, NEWSPAPER DEATH NOTICE, "Erin Shleeter, 6 weeks."
SLIM at COUNTY RECORDER'S DESK:
SLIM
Yes, I lost my birth certificate -
BIRTH CERTIFICATE for Erin Shleeter in Slim's hand -
SOCIAL SECURITY CARD, in her hand -
DRIVER'S LICENSE, with Slim's photo: her hair's a different
color and she wears glasses. The name is Erin Shleeter,.
DRESS SHOP: new clothes, new outfits, new look, new Slim -
FLASHES:
Arab Men carrying in a couch as "Erin" watches.
"Erin" hanging sheets over the windows: makeshift curtains.
"Erin" fixing Gracie's room. Small bed. Two new Teddy Bears.
"ERIN"
What do you think, you like this
place?
GRACIE
(SUSPICIOUSLY)
Why, are we moving again?
"ERIN"
No, we just - (got here)
GRACIE
Good. 'Cause I am sick and
tired to death of movingi
"ERIN"
Me too. So here's the deal. Try to
remember,. while we're here, to call
me Mom or Erin, but not Slim, okay?
55
GRACIE
I never call you Slim.
"ERIN"
I know, but...
GRACIE
I don't think you are that slim.
"ERIN"
Thanks a lot.
GRACIE
Do I get a new name too?
"ERIN"
I guess. If you want one...
Gracie stares at her blankly.
GRACIE
I have a crood idea .
CUT TO:
"Erin" approaches BETTY, Director of the Pre-School:
"ERIN"
Excuse me, Betty? Hi, I'm Erin
Shleeter, I called you -
BETTY
Oh, hi -
"ERIN"
This is my daughter.
BETTY
(TO GRACIE)
Look at you!, you're so...(cute)
What's your name?
GRACIE
Queen Elizabeth.
Betty blinks. "Erin" shrugs: that's my daughter!
CUT TO:
56
"Erin" and "Queen E." leaving work, bickering:
57
"ERIN"
I don't know, I can cook something.
"QUEEN ELIZABETH"
Or we can go to McDonalds.
"ERIN"
We can't afford to eat out every
night. I can cook, Tootster.
"Queen E." rolls her eyes as:
BRAD
Hi.
(off her blank look)
I'm Brad Zall, I just rented a car
from you guys.
"Erin" stares at him. An insane moment of sustained paranoia.
Who is this guy,. really? What does he want?
Finally she realizes a normal response is required. Kind of a
TRICK QUESTION:
"ERIN"
Is the vehicle all right?
BRAD
Yeah, it's fine. I was just thinking
that if you're not doing anything,
maybe I could buy you - and the kid
of course -
"ERIN"
Who are you?! Who sent you?! You
want a date?! You are totally out of
your mind if you think I'm gonna have
even this conversation we're having
right now! I'm not, okay?! We are
not talking! Get it?!
BRAD
Yeah, I get it.
And good luck with your psychotherapy.
He walks away. She stares after him. Again "Queen E." is
looking at her mother in astonishment.
SUP
58
"ERIN"
(STILL AGGRESSIVE)
What? You're thinking I over-
reacted? Huh? Just a little?
CUT TO:
"Erin" is on the phone, "Queen E." at her side.
"ERIN"
Mrs. Tyler? It's Slim.
59
MRS. TYLER'S VOICE
Oh thank God. Listen. Mitch is
planning some legal action, you're
depriving him of his rights as a
father, some nonsense like that:
you better have Gracie call him.
"ERIN"
Oh that's good news -
MRS. TYLER'S VOICE
I thought you'd want to know -
"ERIN"
I do, thanks, I appreciate it.
Listen: we have to keep it short
again or he might trace it, so I
better put her on -
(hands phone to:)
"QUEEN ELIZABETH"
Hi Grandma! I have a new name!
(as "Erin" frowns...)
Yeah! You wanna hear it?
"Erin" pushes down the lever, ending the call, mutters:
"ERIN"
Sorry, your Majesty. Remember:
names're secret.
"Queen E." nods. Puts on her mournful look...
"ERIN"
That is the most pitiful expression
I've ever seen.
CLOSE ON "QUEEN ELIZABETH"
She listens, cradling the phone. "Erin" watches her daughter's
face light up:
"QUEEN ELIZABETH"
Hi Daddy! We're having a great
vacation!
(PAUSE)
I don't know. At a phone booth
somewheres.
"Erin" shakes her head, takes the receiver away:
60
"ERIN"
No questions, okay?, or it ends now.
(hands phone back to
"Queen E.":)
Just tell him you love him and say
goodbye, okay?
"Queen E." nods, puts the receiver to her ear. Even "Erin" can
hear Mitch yelling... "Queen E."'s face changes. Mitch keeps
shouting angrily.
"QUEEN ELIZABETH"
Goodbye Daddy.
She did not say "I love you." She hands "Erin" the receiver.
"Erin" hangs it up.
"QUEEN ELIZABETH"
I am really really sad.
"Erin" nods, angry at herself:
"ERIN"
Sorry, kid. My mistake.
CUT TO:
"Queen E." is hitting stones with a baseball bat as "Erin"
talks on the phone:
64
"ERIN"
Rent a car, make sure you're not
followed, drive to the Taos airport.
JOE'S VOICE
Another plane??
"ERIN"
In Taos, go to Starbucks. Not the
main one or the one by Hagen-Dazs.
The one near the book store.
"Erin" and "Queen E." are pointing out sights, passing an OLD
FASHIONED DINER:
"ERIN"
And there's the diner where I do
not work.
JOE
Where do you work?
"Erin" gives him a look: she's not telling. She resumes the
tour, points to an old crumbling "movie palace:"'
"ERIN"
There's the one-plex.
(pointing again at a
NOT-TOO-FANCY PLACE)
The an restaurant where you'd take
me if we were dating...
(for "Queen E.19
which we are not.
66
Very fast, like an old routine; we see how they play together:
JOE
No way.
"ERIN"
Not at all.
JOE
Just friends, right Gracie?
"QUEEN ELIZABETH"
Queen Elizabeth.
JOE
Right. Sorry, your highness.
"QUEEN ELIZABETH"
No problem.
"Erin" pulls up in front of their house, gestures: here it is.
Baseball diamond. Joe pitching underhand to "Queen E." He's
using plastic balls the size of soccer balls, so it's easy for
her to hit every one.
"Erin" is running, retrieving the hits.
FREEZE FRAME as she's caught in a photograph.
The image unfreezes and is followed quickly by a series of
frozen frames, photographs of her, some wide, some tight.
REVERSE IMAGE.
The park. Mostly empty. No one taking their picture. A stand
of green bushes. HOLD on the bushes for a moment -
"Queen E." is curled on a blanket taking a nap as "Erin" and
Joe finish the picnic.
JOE
You seem like you're doing great.
"ERIN"
Yeah.
JOE
How long can you stand it?
(off her look)
I mean: not to talk to your friends
or family or have anything to do with
your real life?
68
"ERIN"
(quiet, strong)
Gracie is safe.
JOE
Yeah, but what, now Mitch started
some kind of custody battle?, what
DOES -
ROBBIE
Are you Denise?
SHOCK. There he is, standing right over them, in bad clothes
and a baseball cap, dark glasses. Completely unrecognizable.
"ERIN"
Pardon me?
ROBBIE
You're Denise, right? Used to work
at the Pack 'N' Ship?
"ERIN"
I'm not Denise.
ROBBIE
Oh. Sorry, I... You look-but
you're right, your voice... (isn't)
You're not from New Zealand, are you?
"ERIN"
Never been there.
ROBBIE
Boy. Sorry to bother you folks.
He backs away, embarrassed. Joe stares after him warily...
JOE
What now? We call Pack 'N' Ship,
see if Denise ever - (worked there)
"ERIN"
Because of some homeless guy? Joe:
it could be the Pack'N'Ship in
Trenton, New Jersey.
(over his protest)
One thing I learned: I can't jump
every time someone says boo.
I can't do that to her.
69
Joe looks at "Queen E." and nods.
CUT TO:
Looks peaceful. But why do we need this establishing shot?
Its very existence in the narrative is menacing.
From an odd distance across the street, we watch "Erin"
dropping off "Queen E." Extend the mundane details of this
transaction... THREE DAYS LATER
We look. past a tree, through the windows...as "Erin" comes
warily out to the counter, looks over the customers...
We watch from across the street as "Erin" hurries to her
Taurus, gets in and drives away.
"Erin" in line for Pick-up. Betty the Pre-school Director
comes up to "Erin" and says casually:
BETTY
Erin. I'm glad you're here.
We can't find Queen Elizabeth -
"ERIN"
You can't find her??!
BETTY
So many kids're staying for
these after-school things -
She turns, distracted, as ANOTHER TEACHER calls -
73
n "Erin" blinks... looks around frantically... OTHER KIDS in gym or
dance gear, but no "Queen E."...and the knowledge of what's
happened is hitting her...her eyes're dilating, breathing
becoming frantic. Betty turns back as "Erin" mutters:
"ERIN"
I should've! ... I should've known!,
he did it before!
She rams the car in gear, rockets out of the pick-up line -
Almost hits a TEACHER and 4 YEAR OLD KID -
Slams the breaks, calls:
"ERIN"
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I... I...
Freaked out, frantic, she pulls to the side of the road, yanks
up her brake, grabs her cell phone. Auto-dial #2.
T.T.'S VOICE
Double "A" Rent
"ERIN"
Did Queen Elizabeth call?!
T.T.'S VOICE
No, of course - (not)
"ERIN"
Anyone else?!
T.T.'S VOICE
Nobody called, Erin; are you - (okay?)
"Erin" presses STOP, then Auto-dial #1, waits, looks around.
Betty staring at her like she's crazy, walking toward her car -
"ERIN'S" VOICE
Hi. Leave a message.
"ERIN"
Gracie, are you there?! Is anyone
there?! Please? Pick up!
No one picks up. Silence.
She beats the wheel in frustration... lowers her head.
For one long second, she seems completely beaten...
74
A KNOCK on her window -
She looks up, sees Betty.
Betty's talking, but it's as if "Erin" has gone crazy. For a
moment there's no sound, and then the sound is there but
unintelligible, and finally the words and sounds come together:
BETTY
.what I've been trying to tell
you...
"Erin" nodding now, beginning to grasp the words...
BETTY (CONT.)
At the end of dance class, the teacher
lets them go hide, and for a minute no
one could find her -
"Erin" looks past Betty, sees "Queen E." in her tutu and leaps
out of her car -
"ERIN"
Thank you, thank you, I... I'm
sorry. I'll explain later, I...
She rushes forward, wraps "Queen E." in a big, not quite
appropriate hug. "Queen E." looks at her as if to say, "This
is nice, Mom, but will you please tell me what gives?"
CUT TO:
From a distance, we watch "Erin" and "Queen E." trudge toward
their Taurus. The end of the day; they're tired.
CUT TO:
"Erin" bursts out the back door, whirls, pulls a rope -
- Causing a slab of 2-by-4 to slide over the door: primitive
locking device -
She sprints for her Taurus. Still in her pajamas, still
carrying "Queen E." -
Her car has a number pad on the driver's door. She punches
numbers, opens the door, puts "Queen E." in -
78
Pulls a key from under the mat -
Fires the car up, rockets away -
Down the block, so far back we're not even sure it means
anything, a CHEVY SUBURBAN pulls away from the curb...
Parked in back, near dumpsters. "Erin" jumps out of the
Taurus, runs around to the trunk, pulls out a small suitcase.
MOMENTS LATER.
"Erin" and "Queen E." pulling clothes from the suitcase,
getting dressed. A FRANTIC BLUR of pajamas and underwear and
suitcase and the last thing we expect to see:
KNOCK at the window. Robbie. "Erin" whirls, looks. For an
instant TIME SLOWS as she stares at him...
FLASHBACK TO THE DINER, HIS FACE: she recognizes him -
And realizes: he's with Mitch. Which means: Mitch was phony
from the moment she met him -
Robbie reaches for her door handle -
She rams the accelerator, leaving Robbie behind -
The car rockets forward, toward the dumpsters -
She spins the wheel; the car swerves, kisses off the dumpster -
Robbie running for his car, and now we see the Chevy Suburban,
hidden behind some nearby bushes -
The Taurus pogos over the concrete/grass divider, rockets
across the next parking lot...
Robbie jumping into his Suburban -
"Erin" half in, half out of her clothing, trying to drive,
trying to see, sticking out her arm to keep "Queen E." (not in
her seatbelt) from flying through the windshield.
"ERIN"
Seatbelti Seatbelti Put on your -

"QUEEN ELIZABETH"
(trying to put it on)
Then slow down so I -
"ERIN"
I can't slow'-
"QUEEN ELIZABETH"
Who was that guy?!
"ERIN"
(looks in rear-view)
I don't know, some...
(sees Robbie chasing them)
Oh shit...
Three brief FLASHES of -"Erin" being chased out of the city.
Freaked out to drive so fast, "Queen E." screaming, etc.
Robbie's Suburban right behind them, closer, closer... finally
slams into their Taurus, knocking them half off the road. He
pushes them off again, again, "Queen E." covering her eyes,
"Erin" coming back onto the road, fighting to keep control, and
the road narrowing more and more, down to one tight lane. This
looks like totally the wrong place to be leading someone.
"QUEEN ELIZABETH"
(WORRIED)
Mom?
Up ahead is a one-lane covered bridge crossing over a stream.
The bridge is very narrow.
"QUEEN ELIZABETH"
Mom, are you sure...?!
Quite sure, thank you. "Erin" guns the accelerator.
Robbie's FACE... driving, confident, full of blood lust, and
then his expression changes. Eyes widen. He realizes - shit!
too late!! - that the bridge is way too narrow for -
"Erin" Is car slides through, scraping one side
The Suburban crashes into the bridge, careens into the water -
80
"Queen E." looks back through the rear view mirror... looks at
her mother ...back and forth...
"QUEEN ELIZABETH"
That was dangerous.
Slim parks. As she starts to get out, she says to Gracie:
SLIM
Anybody talks to you, hit the horn.
82
She walks up the street, punches in a number...
93
BUTLER'S VOICE
Tyler residence.
SLIM
Yes. Tony. Could you please tell
Mrs. Tyler that I'll call her around
f our this afternoon.
BUTLER'S VOICE
Of course, Miss Slim. My pleasure.
Slim hangs up, goes into a. bagel shop.
Alex and Slim are across the street from a strip joint.
SLIM
It's closed?
ALEX
Till six, eh?
SLIM
And I'd guess whoever owns it
isn't a very nice person.
ALEX
That's a safe one.
Slim starts walking toward the shop. As they go:
SLIM
Why here?
ALEX
You've got soft hands, you've worked
hard. The tricky part now is nerves.
They reach the entryway; Slim takes out her tools.
94
SLIM
People on the street?
ALEX
Yeah. And you have to go in when
his alarm's turned off -
SLIM
(NODS)
Meaning he's inside.
(has tools out)
I'm ready.
Alex moves slightly to block the view as Slim bends over and
slips her tool into the lock...
Slim working quietly, concentrating...
Alex looking. around...
A SHADY CHARACTER noticing them. Hesitating. Coming over..
ALEX
We got company, doll...
Slim still working...
The Shady Character has almost reached them...
ALEX
Forget it. You're too slow.
She opens the door -
Alex glances down, nods -
She closes the door again and stands just as:
SHADY CHARACTER
Hey. What're you guys up to?
Slim stares at him.
SLIM
We were hoping to see some action,
but it looks like they're closed.
The Shady Character stares back. He is ve skeptical.
He watches Slim and Alex walk off down the block. Alex mutters
under his breath:
95
ALEX
"Action?"
Off her grin -
CUT TO:
Slim exits in a long gray coat.
Stops outside for one moment, glances around -
Sees a guy in a GREEN TRENCHCOAT across the street.
She walks hurriedly away.
Glances over her shoulder, sees Trenchcoat following her.
She smiles slightly, to herself.
CUT TO:
From a discreet distance, across the street, we watch her go
into her hotel.
96
Trenchcoat is standing across the street.
Slim going out the door, down the alley...
98
Slim parks, looks across at a warehouse converted into lofts.
BATTLE OF THE
She takes a duffle from the back seat. Steps into the shadows,
stares at the warehouse:
Brick building, modern door and light fixtures.
SEXES
She looks both ways:
The street's dark. Deserted.
She hoists her duffle, takes a deep breath.
And crosses the street.
Goes up the stairs to the stoop. Looks at the alarm panel on
the door: green.
Crouches, starts to work on the lock.
Mitch walks down the street.
Up the steps, punches in his alarm code.
She comes out, sits on the steps. A siren is audible.
Cop cars speed down the street, screech to a stop.
TWO COPS LEAP OUT OF THE CAR, run toward her.
FIRST COP
You okay?
She looks at him, considering the question.
Shakes her head.
FIRST COP
Where is he?
She makes a slight motion to indicate that Mitch is inside, and
the OTHER COP runs into the apartment.
Slim lowers her head.
First Cop looks at her, sees the blood on her scalp.
FIRST COP
Looks like you're one of the lucky
ones.
She looks up, stares at him, and starts to cry.
