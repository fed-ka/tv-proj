CREDIT SEQUENCE.
As OPENING CREDITS play, we study the city's nighttime
pulse, ribbons of headlights moving and cross-connecting
like blood through the veins of a body --
impressionistic, even beautiful, but what we're hearing
is soulful trumpet-based MUSIC, mellow and haunting, the
modern classic -- JAZZ sound of a Wynton Marsalis,
putting a voice to our story. As CREDITS END, we...
DISSOLVE TO:
Now the MUSIC is GONE, SOUNDS are MUFFLED and vision
blurred. We get the impression of urgent movement. We
hear BREATHING. There are VOICES, SHOUTS, even SCREAMS,
but MUFFLED, far away. Only the breathing is distinct.
We come to realize it is our breathing, and we are inside
someone, looking out. The man whose POV this is is on
the edge of consciousness and not far from death. He
lies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of an
accident only minutes after impact.
His VISION goes IN and OUT of clarity. People are
swarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage of
wrecked vehicles. A SIREN BLOOMS in the distance and
approaches haltingly. The man slips away, comes back
toward consciousness, slips again.
The crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage to
a police officer. It is a woman, Officer SHARON POGUE,
LAPD. She kneels at the man's side, taking charge,
speaking, but we hear only SLIVERS of SOUND. He sees her
face clearly now, close above him.
Sharon is
a dedicated professional and more. We see down
into her
to a place of real caring. She stares into our
eyes and
connects. We begin to hear her now -- and there
are more
SIRENS converging in b.g.
SHARON
Can you hear me?
(shouting, off)
This one's conscious!
VOICE (O.S.)
Paramedics on the way!
We are slipping away again. Sharon holds us with her
eyes, and she grips our hand.
(CONTINUED)
2.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
Wait. Wait. Listen to me.
Can
you feel that?
She holds on tight.
We see that our hand, held in her
own, is bloody.
SHARON
That's my hand. Hold it.
Go on
-- as hard as you can.
We watch our hand gripping hers, and as we hold on, the
sights and sounds around us grow more clear.
SHARON
It's over, and I've got you, and
you're safe. You're safe now.
You got that? Don't let go.
Don't let me go.
But our eyes unlock from Sharon's and DRIFT TO a patch of
night sky. Her voice fades awawy. Our POV begins TO
LIFT, MOVING TOWARD that sky, as the blue-black night
begins to turn white. We GO INTO that white light and...
DISSOLVE TO:
We PICK OUT a police car from the traffic and FOLLOW.
The beat being patrolled is a mixed neighborhood with
some very rough edges.
At the same time, a few blocks away, an OLD, FRAIL MAN is
carrying two plastic grocery bags that are too heavy for
him.
Walking behind this man is a younger man named CATCH
LAMBERT, an attractive man with some scarring on his
face. His eyes, deep down, are haunted by something, but
there is energy in his step. He is dressed in a relaxed
and stylish manner, not expensive. He begins to pick up
his pace to catch up to the old man.
(CONTINUED)
4.
CONTINUED:
People glance at Catch, nad he glances back in an open
and unflinching way, ready for anything, a smile, a nod,
or -- because these are some of L.A.'s mean streets -- a
threatening or taunting look. These he also meets
openly, without a trace of fear. The man has been
through some kind of fire, and it has left him different
from us. Outside the usual boundaries.
Catch walks beside the Old Man, glancing at him.
Finally, the man glances back, wondering and suspicious,
but Catch has a slight, disarming smile, open and honest.
CATCH
Y'know... since we're both walking
the same way, I could take one of
those bags for you. That way, I
do some upper body work while I'm
walking along. Helps my back.
What d'you say?
The Old Man trudges on, proud and suspicious, too.
CATCH
Right now your mind's making
pictures of me robbing your
groceires, but, y'know, nine times
out of ten, people do the right
thing.
The Old Man glances at him, still not convinced, but he
soon has to stop and rest. Catch stops, too. The old
man looks at him, a bit embarrassed.
OLD MAN
It's the dog food that makes it so
heavy.
Catch nods, puts out his hand. The Old Man hesitates,
then decides and lifts a bag, and Catch takes it.
CATCH
I guess it's worth it... for a
good dog.
Catch isn't kidding. He has that honesty. The Old Man
nods and starts trudging again. As they walk on
together, Catch reaches for that second bag. The man
relents and lets him take it. They continue on, Catch
carrying the bags and every now and then lifting them a
bit for his upper body work.
5.
This is the call Sharon and Robby have sped to. It is a
chaotic scene of cops breaking up a fight between eight
boys, 16-20. A big KID, 18 or so, is being pulled off
another by Sharon and Robby. The Kid is wild and
resisting and Sharon shows her toughness and
professionalism and some anger, too, as she slams him
into a fence -- and Robby holds him while she cuffs the
young man -- who is very mouthy, playing to his friends.
KID
Look at this bitch.
Whoo!
Benny,
look at this!
Sharon and Robby are both very good at their jobs, taking
this Kid to their car while other cops contain the rest.
A crowd watches -- mostly teens.
KID
(to Sharon)
You come in with me.
Hey, bitch.
Some of his bystanders friends howl at that.
KID
You're going to arrest me, you
come into the back seat with me.
Come on!
He resists a bit, but they're getting him into the car.
KID
Come on.
We'll have a good time.
as Robby and Sharon walk to their car. They are
interrupted by one of their lieutenants, SANDERMAN,
walking their way and stopping to stare at Sharon. She
meets his look.
SANDERMAN
You trying to be a bad-ass, Pogue?
She is straightforward, not rebellious.
SHARON
I just dealt with the situation.
The prisoner...
(CONTINUED)
7.
CONTINUED:
SANDERMAN
And you don't see a pattern here?
(pause)
I want you to keep yourself way
inside the line instead of walking
on it. All right? Are you taking
notes?
He walks away, and Sharon and Robby walk on to their
car -- she is dark; he is glancing at her.
ROBBY
You broke his nose.
SHARON
He grabbed me.
End of story.
ROBBY
And you were waiting for him. You
were hoping. You were making
long-range plans for his ass while
he was mouthing off in the car --
and you're supposed to be above
that shit.
SHARON
If you think I crossed the line,
put it in the report.
ROBBY
Pogo, stop the shit. What is it?
You pissed off at me, too?
They enter the car, Sharon behind the wheel.
SHARON
Not you, Rob. You're a rare
unthreatened male cop with a good
marriage, and you like to eat
where I eat -- so everything's
code four.
She STARTS the CAR and starts to back out, and he reaches
over and turns OFF the IGNITION. She stares hotly at
him -- but then, slowly, she softens, takes a deep
breath.
ROBBY
Come over
for dinner tonight.
I'll call
Charlene. She'd like to
see you.
It's been awhile. We'll
talk about
it.
(CONTINUED)
8.
CONTINUED:
She STARTS the CAR again, more calm, starts to drive out
of the lot.
SHARON
Thanks. But
she'll invite
friends, try and fix me up. She's
always trying to fix me up so she
doesn't have to worry about you
and me.
ROBBY
She doesn't worry about that.
SHARON
They all worry about that.
They both smile wryly, driving on.
SHARON
You don't need to fix me, Robby,
or fix me up. I don't want some
guy to heart and soul me and then
walk away 'cause he can't stand
the cop thing -- or worse: he
wants cop stories every night
'cause it turns him on, and he has
no idea who I am inside my head.
Anyway, I'm busy tonight.
ROBBY
Got some action, huh?
Well,
that's promising.
SHARON
Yeah.
Hot and heavy.
IMMEDIATE CUT TO:
Catch Lambert is walking the wet streets, head down in
the rain. Far away we hear that car with a BASS-BLASTING
RADIO.
(CONTINUED)
9.
CONTINUED:
In the glow of a street lamp, Catch sees a bright-colored
object in the gutter. He picks it up out of the gurgling
rain water. It is a small toy, a discarded superhero.
He puts it in his pocket, walks on.
Now the car, the prowling, MUSIC-BLASTING, BASS-
THUNDERING CAR turns a corner and begins rollling along
slowly -- beside Catch. He glances over, walking on.
There are four tough-looking MEN in the car, looking for
trouble. The MUSIC is DEAFENING. Catch glances again,
walks on. Their eyes follow him like gun barrels. He
stops and walks out on the street, moving toward the car,
shouting over the music.
CATCH
Hey! You want to turn that volume
down? What's your point?
The men, incredulous, stop the car and snap OFF the MUSIC
in order to make sure they're hearing right. They stare
death at Catch.
DRIVER (MAN)
What did you say?
CATCH
What's the point of blasting your
music through the whole zip code?
Don't you realize there are kids
trying to sleep in these
apartments -- old people, sick
people?
They can hardly believe this.
DRIVER
You better watch your mouth,
asshole.
Catch meets the man's look with his own unflinching,
haunted eyes.
CATCH
Why?
What're you gonna do?
Kill
me?
Catch's look is not a macho challenge. It's something
else -- beyond that, a man somehow without limits. One
of the riders in the backseat taps the Driver's shoulder.
MAN #2
Guy's nuts.
Let's go.
The Driver, never breaking his death stare, snaps on the
DEAFENING MUSIC and then slowly rolls on, still glaring
at Catch. Catch stands in the rain, watching them go.
10.
Sharon is just leaving with a clean uniform on a hanger
in a plastic bag. It's a neighborhood place where
alterations are done. As she is leaving, an older woman
is just entering. This is MRS. VANDER, beaming at
Sharon, a real talker.
MRS. VANDER
Sherry!
SHARON
Hi, Mrs. Vander. You're looking
good.
MRS. VANDER
Oh, you just wait. I splurged.
She is pulling a new blue dress out of a shopping bag.
MRS. VANDER
It's for the church and the party.
It's just a little too long.
SHARON
Looks great.
MRS. VANDER
Y'know, I cried over the
invitation -- just imagine me in
church.
(laughs)
It'll be so good to spend time
with you.
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
Sharon forces a smile -- but is mystified. Mrs. Vander
is walking to the counter and pausing to say...
MRS.
VANDER
You know Dan and I
renewed our
vows last year. I
bet that's
where your mom got
the idea.
SHARON
Their vows?
MRS. VANDER
Your mom and dad -- the
ceremony...
Mrs. Vander realizes what's going on and stammers on,
sympathetic and embarrassed.
MRS. VANDER
Oh, well... y'know, I just got
that invitation a few... just now,
so I'm sure you'll...
SHARON
Oh, yeah. We've had... there's
been some problems with the mail
in our building, so... I'll
probably get it today.
They're both covering like mad, both realizing Sharon's
been left out.
SHARON
So, I guess I'll see you.
MRS. VANDER
Sure, honey.
I'll see you there.
Sharon leaves -- Mrs. Vander staring after her, feeling
bad. As Sharon walks away, we see her forced smile die,
replaced by an old pain and darkness.
Robby and Sharon's unit pulls up at a house remodel with
a sign marked "POGUE CONSTRUCTION." Sharon exits the car
and walks onto the site, moves toward a man who is both
carpenter and supervisor on the job. This is her
brother, LARRY POGUE, 29. They are not comfortable with
each other -- an old wound. He gives her a wary nod.
She's trying a little harder, being a bit more friendly.
We can sense the strain.
(CONTINUED)
13.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
I didn't see his truck, so...
LARRY
He's not here.
SHARON
How you doing?
She touches his shoulder as she says this, a friendly
gesture, a reaching out. He doesn't respond, only
shrugs.
LARRY
I'm okay.
SHARON
Kathy and the boy? Bet he's big
now.
LARRY
Growin' fast.
SHARON
Is he looking more like you now --
or did he get lucky?
She has broken through a bit and they both smile a brief,
wry smile.
LARRY
He's got Kathy's looks and brains
and my strong back. You should
feel his grip.
(pause)
You just passing by?
She looks about.
SHARON
Place is coming along nice. The
octagon window. Dad's signature.
But Larry's look stays on her, wondering what's on her
mind.
SHARON
Look, Larry, I shouldn't have to
hear it from Mrs. Vander -- about
what's happening.
He turns back to his work now as they speak,
uncomfortable.
(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:
LARRY
What's happening?
SHARON
(hurt)
So you really weren't going to
tell me? Nobody was going to tell
me? Mom and Dad renewing their
vows, the church, the party. Mrs.
Vander is all excited. She bought
a new dress. It's blue.
LARRY
We're workin' on Dad. We think
you should be there. We told him.
SHARON
Mom told him?
LARRY
We mentioned it.
SHARON
He's holding out, hah?
LARRY
You want to come?
SHARON
It's my family. Jesus, Lar. It's
over ten years, and he won't let
go of it.
LARRY
You two were always head to head.
SHARON
For good reason. Remember?
LARRY
Let's just leave it.
She stares, then...
SHARON
You're still scared of him.
Pissed, he throws his hammer down on the plywood, turns
to her.
(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED:
LARRY
I don't think it's a good idea you
coming around here in uniform.
People see it, they think we're in
trouble here.
SHARON
Nice seeing you, too.
She walks away.
He frowns, picks up his hammer, goes
back to work.
ON STREET
As Sharon walks towards the car, she sees a van
approaching and she holds up a hand to Robby and calls
out...
SHARON
Two more minutes.
And she walks toward the oncoming van, which is parking
now.
The van is driven by KATHY, Sharon's brother's wife.
Beside her in a car seat is LARRY, JR., four years old.
Sharon comes to the rolled down window on the driver's
side. She has a warm smile for Kathy and the child.
Kathy smiles, too.
KATHY
Hi! Look -- it's your Auntie
Sharon.
SHARON
Hey, Champ, my God, look how big.
She has a special affection for the boy -- who is
subdued, but he smiles a small one for his aunt. She
takes one of his hands and they shake in mock formality.
LARRY JR.
Hi.
SHARON
Ow! You hurt my hand with that
grip. Whew.
(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED:
She shakes her fingers, and he smiles a bit more. Sharon
reaches in and rubs his head in a mock knuckling move.
He laughs. She smooths his hair, affectionately.
KATHY
We're bringing Larry his lunch.
Hey, it's good to see you. It's
been awhile. What?
Sharon is staring at Kathy's badly bruised ear.
KATHY
Oh, I went boom into a low shelf
-- chasing after him of course.
(nodding to the child)
How're you doing?
Sharon pulls her eyes off the bruise to meet Kathy's look
-- and connect.
SHARON
I'm semi-okay. I heard about
the... ceremony and the party.
KATHY
(embarrassed)
Oh. I hope you'll be there.
(pause)
Really.
Sharon smiles a bit, appreciating the support.
She pats
Kathy's arm.
SHARON
Take it easy.
You too, Champ.
The boy offers his little hand to shake again.
SHARON
Oh, no. You're not breaking my
fingers again.
They smile and drive on and Sharon walks toward her car
and Robby.
We WATCH moms and kids and a basketball game in the park
and PICK UP Catch walking by. Two pre-teens are playing
bounce and catch with a rubber ball against a (tennis
practice) wall, and one of them misses, and Catch makes a
lunge and snags the ball. Instead of throwing it to one
of the boys, he fires it at the wall.
(CONTINUED)
17.
CONTINUED:
One of the boys catches it, bounces it off the wall
toward Catch. Catch grabs it, and now he's part of this
rapid-fire game -- and he's athletic and funny, too,
playing hard and mugging and making them smile until... a
POLICE CAR comes ROARING down the boulevard, slowing a
bit to CHIRP its SIREN a few times -- clearing traffic.
Catch glances up and sees...
CATCH'S POV
Sharon is in the car beside Robby.
ON CATCH
Stunned by the sight of her -- and he doesn't know why.
He can't move, can't breathe, eyes fixed on her. The
POLICE CAR pulls around a truck and ROARS on -- and
that's when he is struck by a memory, a little like
lightning. It comes as a quick --
- CATCH'S POV
-- The man near death. Sharon is bending close to him,
this all just a sliver of an image, and it jolts him.
BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)
The police car is now converging with other squads just
half a block away. Catch throws the ball back to the
boys and runs toward the police incident. The boys watch
him go, wondering.
A police
car is parked askew near this closed store -- as
now Robby
and Sharon's UNIT ROARS to a STOP beside it.
Two cops
are calling and motioning to them, one holds a
shotgun.
This is RAY JULIETTE.
RAY
Break-in alarm. One suspect in --
nobody out. Take the back.
And they are moving.
Robby and Sharon are hurrying around to the back as we
hear more POLICE UNITS CONVERGING in front.
18.
ANGLE - STREET
As Catch arrives on the scene and sees Sharon and Robby
moving around the building to the back. He is still
amazed at the sight of her. He decides to follow her,
keeping her in sight, driven.
ON SHARON, ROBBY
They are scouting through crates and weeds as a young man
is flushed from cover at the back of the store and runs
from them.
ROBBY
Freeze!
The man runs on, and Sharon chases with Robby close
behind her. Sharon speaks to her shoulder radio mike as
she runs.
SHARON
(to radio)
Three-A-5, foot pursuit. Suspect
fleeing south on Pico Place, young
man, green jacket. No visible
weapon...
(to Robby)
Robby!
ROBBY
Right behind you!
(to man)
Stop and lie down with your
arms... shit.
The man has jumped a fence.
Sharon follows.
ROBBY
Careful!
SHARON
I see him!
She goes over the fence, then Robby.
The man runs and Sharon chases. Robby, not far behind
glances off to the side, seeing Catch, still following.
ROBBY
Citizen on your right!
Hey!
(CONTINUED)
19.
CONTINUED:
But Sharon is now closing on the fleeing man who turns
suddenly, pointing a handgun!
ROBBY
Gun!
And Sharon, wide-eyed, is already pulling her weapon, but
not in time. The man is aiming at her and about to fire
when he is tackled by Catch.
Catch and the man go sprawling, and the gun flies out of
the man's hand, and Sharon is on him in an instant,
pointing her gun at him...
SHARON
Freeze!
Right there!
Catch scrambles to his feet. Robby joins Sharon and puts
his knee in the man's back and cuffs him, then glances at
Catch. So does Sharon. But Catch starts to hurry off.
ROBBY
Hey!
Wait!
Two other cops (Ray Juliette and SANCHEZ) rush toward the
suspect on the ground.
RAY
You got him?
ROBBY
He was armed.
RAY
Jesus.
ROBBY
Citizen took him down.
RAY
No shit!?
Sharon stares across the lot to where Catch has halted.
More cops are converging. Ray Juliette and Sanchez move
toward Catch, while a sergeant and others surround Sharon
and the suspect. In between the crowd of cops, Catch and
Sharon glance at each other, during...
ON CATCH
as the cops reach him.
(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED:
RAY
What happened here?
CATCH
I... just saw it and... I saw the
gun, so...
ON SHARON
ROBBY
You all right, Pogo?
She is shaken, speaks softly.
SHARON
I was dead.
Y'know.
She glances toward Catch. (She doesn't recognize him
from the accident.) Their eyes meet briefly, but then
their attention is pulled to the others. Sharon speaks
to her sergeant.
SHARON
He had me.
I was dead.
ON CATCH
He is shaken, too.
Sanchez is taking notes as Ray checks
his I.D.
CATCH
I was just walking by.
I live
near here.
Ray nods, handing the I.D. to Sanchez.
SANCHEZ
Sergeant's going to want to talk
to you, Mr. Lambert. We'll need a
statement.
RAY
Don't worry about it. That's just
procedure. Look -- we appreciate
what you did. No bullshit. Let
us buy you a drink tonight, all
right? You know where the Rib
House is?
Catch glances at Sharon again, and he nods.
21.
Catch, a bit bruised and dirty from his tackle, is
carrying groceries up the walkway steps to a small, well-
kept home. He is taking out a key as he walks to the
covered portico.
As Catch and Sharon exit the building, walk toward her
car.
SHARON
It's not a great neighborhood.
Maybe I should walk you to your
car.
CATCH
I don't have a car.
They walk on, silent a moment.
This doesn't come easy
for her.
SHARON
Want a ride home?
CATCH
Oh, thanks, but... I like to walk.
SHARON
It's starting to rain.
Don't be a
hero.
He hesitates, nervous about it, but then...
CATCH
Yeah. If it's no trouble.
Thanks.
They walk to her car.
SHARON
Okay... ten years from now, what
d'you want to be doing?
They walk side by side a moment.
He shrugs.
Then -- in
his open way...
CATCH
I don't know.
This is pretty
good.
She glances at him, taking this in, then fumbles a bit
with her car keys, and he asks -- nervously again...
(CONTINUED)
31.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
Can you drive okay?
She gets a little defensive.
SHARON
I'm not drunk. You think I'm
drunk? I'm not. You'll know I'm
drunk when I'm throwing up, and I
never throw up, so don't worry
about it.
He nods, looks at her dead-on a moment.
CATCH
The only time I worry is when
people tell me not to worry.
SHARON
Get in the car, will you?
Catch leaving Sharon's building in a turmoil of emotions,
staring hard at his thoughts -- and he steps into the
path of a car. The CAR SCREECHES to a stop, and the
scream of those brakes and white light of the head lamps
paralyze Catch, and he sees --
37.
FLASHBACK - SLIVER OF IMAGE
Headlights suddenly washing into a vehicle he is driving.
BACK TO SCENE
(PRESENT)
This sliver of memory jolts HIM -- and then another one
comes.
FLASHBACK - HEADLIGHTS
coming closer and the scream of brakes from his memory,
and all of this is exploded --
BACK TO SCENE
(PRESENT)
by the angry DRIVER shouting at him.
DRIVER
What the hell do you think you're
doing?!
Catch is numb -- completely shut down there in the middle
of the street. The Driver exits his car and comes toward
him, raging.
DRIVER
Are you crazy?!
Catch isn't even aware of him. The man gawks at this --
and now Catch walks off. It is raining. The streets are
wet.
ANGLE - RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
As Catch continues his walk, he is still a bit shaken --
but when he passes a parked car with the window half
open, rain getting in, he hesitates. He can't just walk
on. He looks about. He tests the lock. He opens the
door, rolls up the window, closes the door, walks on.
But a MAN is just exiting a doorway to the street -- and
calls out...
MAN
Hey!
Hey!
What did you do?
Catch stops and turns in the rain.
The Man hurries
toward him, upset, angry.
(CONTINUED)
38.
CONTINUED:
MAN
That's my car!
What the hell were
you doing?
CATCH
Nothing.
I just...
The Man shoves him.
MAN
I saw you!
What did you take out
of there?!
CATCH
No, I rolled up the window.
It's
rain...
The Man gets in his face, shaky...
MAN
You take my phone?!
Hah?!
He shoves Catch again, and Catch's desperate confusion
explodes in a surprising reaction, grabbing the Man's
jacket front in one hand and not punching him but quickly
slap, slap, slapping him, saying...
CATCH
Hey!
Hey!
Wake up!
Wake up!
The Man is now speechless, frozen, terrified, as Catch's
eyes hold him with a fierceness -- and a sadness.
CATCH
I helped you.
(pause)
I helped you.
Catch lets him go, and immediately begins walking away,
hunching into the rain, his expression dark and troubled.
He gets five steps away and turns. The Man steps back --
but Catch only says...
CATCH
I'm sorry.
And he walks on.
The Man watches him go.
Candace, Catch's neighbor, is waiting for the slow,
RATTLING ELEVATOR with her son.
(CONTINUED)
39.
CONTINUED:
The elevator door opens -- and there is Catch, seated on
a newly-bought wicker chair in the elevator with a small
table across his lap, other boxes nearby and a
long-stemmed rose in his hand, wrapped for giving.
CATCH
Oh.
Sorry.
He rises and hurriedly gets his purchases off the
elevator so the woman and little boy can enter.
CANDACE
Shopping day?
He smiles at her, a bit less subdued than before as he
gets his things into the hall -- and he manages a special
look for Tommy, a wink. He frees the elevator; they step
inside. As the door starts to close, Catch's face
"follows" the sliding door with a funny look for the boy.
We hear Tommy laugh as the door closes. Catch carries
his new possessions to his apartment.
A well-kept older home, well-planted, pretty. A woman of
nearly 60 is tending the flowers. She hears someone
approaching the gate in the wooden fence. She looks up.
Sharon is at the gate, in uniform, on her dinner break.
The older woman is her MOTHER, Elaine Pogue. There is an
old strain between them, a sadness -- and a nervousness
in Elaine. She's a quiet woman. She smiles at her
daughter as Sharon comes through the gate. They hug
tentatively, a lot of baggage here. Sharon turns to the
garden.
SHARON
It's looking great, Mom.
MOTHER
(pleased)
Thanks, honey. It's the best year
ever for the impatiens. The very
best.
There is a beat of awkward silence.
MOTHER
Let's go in.
Sharon is climbing the
outdoor staircase to her
apartment, tired after
her shift, drained a bit
by her
visit home. When she
reaches her door she sees
that a
long-stemmed rose has
been masking-taped to her
door.
Written on the masking
tape is: "Catch Lambert"
and a
phone number.
She pauses, staring at this, gets a little grin.
Sharon is driving, speeding a bit, getting to Catch's
building ahead of him.
He approaches his apartment building, unlocks the front
door, walks in the entrance area. Now we see, across the
street, Sharon exit her car and follow him.
The front door has locked automatically. Outside there
is a panel of buzzers and apartment numbers. Sharon hits
all the buttons. Somebody BUZZES her in.
As Catch charges up the stairs to the wide porch of Mrs.
Chu's well-kept home, carrying a grocery bag, head full
of his thoughts.
52.
Sharon, not in uniform, is approaching Larry's house. It
has a small yard with kids' toys strewn about and a tire-
swing. She walks up on the porch and RINGS the DOORBELL.
She hears VOICES inside, LARRY AND KATHY, a quick
murmuring, low-voice argument, can't make out the words.
In a moment, Larry opens the door.
LARRY
Jesus, you're up early.
SHARON
I wanted to catch you before you
went to work.
LARRY
I thought you were on late shifts.
SHARON
I don't sleep much. Can I come
in?
56.
Sharon is driving Catch home. They are now on a main
boulevard of stores, office buildings. They stop at a
light. Both are surprised by a voice calling out from
the pedestrians crossing the street.
PINDELLA (O.S.)
Catch?
They look up to see a well-dressed man pausing in the
middle of the crosswalk to face their car. He is in his
forties, tall, with grey-blond hair. This is RICHARD
PINDELLA. He has a small smile and wave for Catch.
Sharon is curious, looking at Catch. Catch throws the
man a dark look and then turns away, ignoring him,
nervous, intense.
PINDELLA
Catch?
CATCH
(to Sharon)
Drive, will you?
Pindella is moving toward the car, Sharon watching him,
wondering.
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
Drive!
The light changes. Pindella hurries to the curb as the
cars surge forward. Sharon drives slowly, checking the
mirror to see Pindella stare after them -- then enter the
office building on the corner.
CATCH
Will you get off this street?
She makes a turn, glancing at Catch.
SHARON
What?
You owe him money?
But his dark look persists, and he doesn't answer.
Then...
CATCH
If you take a right and stop -- we
can walk from here. I'd rather
walk.
He is nervous, being in the car -- and glad to leave it
when she pulls over. She watches this, wondering.
Sharon exits the car and locks it, staring at Catch.
SHARON
If you're in trouble...
CATCH
I'm not.
SHARON
If you're in trouble with him,
maybe I can help.
CATCH
Forget about him. Somebody I used
to know. I don't want to know him
anymore. That's all. Forget
about it. Walk with me.
She hesitates,
then falls in
beside him as he walks on.
They walk along
in silence,
the neighborhood growing more
seedy, tougher
as they go.
Catch is relaxing now, trying
to push it all
away. Sharon
looks around her.
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
This is not a great place to walk.
CATCH
I like it here. It's fine.
SHARON
I work here.
It's not fine.
CATCH
What's the problem?
SHARON
Besides the shootings, break-ins,
rapes, cart thefts? We've got a
loose dog raiding garbage cans,
knocking 'em over. Can't catch
him. Got somebody blowing a
trumpet between midnight and
three. Can't find him.
As someone approaches them, Catch makes eye contact and
smiles a small, friendly smile-in-passing. He gets a
brief smile in return. He and Sharon amble on. He does
it again.
SHARON
You know everybody here?
He nods to another YOUNG MAN he's never met...
CATCH
How's it goin'?
YOUNG MAN
Goin' uphill, man.
Catch and Sharon smile.
CATCH
(to Sharon)
You try it.
SHARON
Try what?
CATCH
Go ahead. We need this.
Everybody.
She has misgivings. A young woman is bustling along.
Sharon makes eye contact and presents a nervous smile and
a nod -- but the woman looks at her sternly and bustles
on.
(CONTINUED)
65.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
I feel like a jerk. I feel like a
smiley face.
Catch smiles, Sharon frowns, but when an OLD MAN passes,
she gives a small smile. The Man lights up.
OLD MAN
Mornin'.
Catch looks at her. She tries to shrug it off, but can't
quite hide her pleasure. Now Catch is pausing as a woman
is walking her six-year-old daughter to their parked car.
Catch makes eye contact with the girl and does a goofy
wave that makes her smile. Sharon smiles, too. As the
girl's MOTHER is unlocking the car, the girl shyly looks
back at Catch for more fun. He does that quick finger
trick -- trying to catch his own thumb, and the girl
giggles But the Mother is impatient.
MOM
Go on.
The girl gets in. The Mother is about to close the door.
She frowns, mean-eyed.
MOM
Move your arm!
The girl slides in further,
and the Mother slams the
door. The girl follows her
mother with hurt eyes as she
walks around to the driver's
side. Catch has paused to
watch this, his eyes gentle
on the girl. The Mother is
about to enter the car when
she sees Catch staring.
MOM
What are you staring at?
CATCH
She feels bad 'cause you yelled at
her.
MOM
What?! Who the hell do you think
you are?
Sharon is uncomfortable.
Catch persists, never flinching
at the woman's anger.
CATCH
She just needs you to smile at
her.
(CONTINUED)
66.
CONTINUED:
MOM
It's none of your business!
CATCH
Why not smile at her?
What's it
cost?
MOM
Who the hell are you to talk to
me?!
Catch's anger is like flint in his eyes.
It surprises
Sharon. She's upset by this.
CATCH
You're so damn impatient.
WOMAN
Get away from me!
CATCH
You're so busy being pissed off,
and time is going by.
WOMAN
What?!
CATCH
It's not her fault.
The Woman gets into the car and slams the door.
WOMAN
I'm calling the police!
CATCH
No.
I'm calling the police.
(turns to Sharon)
Hey -- police.
The Woman speeds her car away.
Sharon gets in Catch's
face.
SHARON
Jesus Christ, Catch.
CATCH
Maybe she'll think about it now.
(CONTINUED)
67.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
You had no right to do that. God!
You think you know everything?!
Who the hell are you, some expert
on raising kids?! The
neighborhood angel?! Jesus!
CATCH
No. No, I just... some people are
walking around blind...
SHARON
That's not your problem!
CATCH
Don't tell me what my problem is!
SHARON
Okay, fine -- you tell me what it
is!
CATCH
Maybe it's not my problem. Maybe
it's your problem. Maybe you're
going around blind.
SHARON
Blind to what?!
CATCH
Blind to what's going on around
you. Blind to what people need.
We're supposed to take care of
each other. We're supposed to
keep each other safe. That's the
way it should be -- if you're not
going around blind, like that
woman...
SHARON
Or like me, right? What about
you? How come you can see?
That stops him, the darkness rising.
He looks about,
trying to contain it.
CATCH
I think I'll... walk the rest of
the way on my own.
SHARON
Yeah.
Fine.
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
I'll call you later -- about the
hiking.
SHARON
I'll be out.
She turns and walks away.
He is still angry, but sorry
to see her go.
CATCH
Shar... wait.
Hey!
But she
keeps walking, and he watches her walk away.
Then he
walks on, upset, mad at himself, trying to pound
through
it, walking quickly. He is passing an alley,
when he
hears a CRASH. He looks in...
He sees a large dog that has just knocked over a garbage
can. He and the dog stare. Catch walks into the alley,
approaches the big dog, squats down to look the animal in
the eye, and begins petting it. The big mutt is now
leaning into the petting, and Catch's eyes go deep -- and
slowly find their way to a sad smile.
Sharon and Robby
are patrolling in their unit. Robby is
driving. Sharon
is watching out the window with a deep-
eyed look, a bit
down because of her argument with Catch.
She is staring as
she rolls along.
SHARON'S POV
She is watching the people on the street, NOTICING, for
once, just how isolated they are, each in a box, passing
without connecting.
ON SHARON
watching.
It is early evening of the same day, and Sharon is just
off shift, out of uniform in her own car, parking on
Larry's street and walking to the door. She knocks --
and takes a step back. Larry opens the door, already
angry, his nose bandaged, eyes blackened a bit from the
blow.
LARRY
I don't want you around here.
SHARON
Let's go talk in the yard.
They stare. She starts walking back into his darkening
front yard, looking over her shoulder. She walks to a
tree where the tire swing hangs, waits there. He goes
back inside, but leaves the door open. In a moment he
reappears, coming outside, closing the door behind him.
ON SHARON AND LARRY
As they meet by the tire swing.
His eyes burn her, hate
and pain.
SHARON
You took a swing at me.
(CONTINUED)
70.
CONTINUED:
LARRY
You asked for it -- calling me a
coward. You knew I'd swing. You
think I look bad now? Look at
this.
He has a Polaroid photo in his hand, holds it in front of
her, dried blood and bad bruising on his face.
LARRY
Nice, huh? Beautiful. The
cops'll love this, right?
Evidence. Don't you guys love
evidence?
He puts it in his pocket, and they stare a moment more.
LARRY
You wanted me to swing.
She looks away.
She nods, speaks softly.
SHARON
I'm sorry I hit you so hard.
LARRY
But you're not sorry you hit me.
SHARON
Jesus, Larry, what about Kathy's
face?!
LARRY
That's not your business! Nobody
called you, right? She didn't ask
for you to come here. This is my
family. You don't get it, 'cause
you've got no family. Nobody. So
you try to run everybody else's
life. Jesus Christ -- get your
own life. That's the goddam
problem. Get your own goddamn
life.
Their stare holds, but she is giving way.
SHARON
Okay. I'm sorry I came here.
I'm
sorry I hit you. Okay?
LARRY
Okay what?
This is very hard for her.
(CONTINUED)
71.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
Don't go to my department, all
right?
LARRY
Why the hell not?
SHARON
Larry...
LARRY
Why not?!
SHARON
Because the job's all I got.
LARRY
That's what I said, right?
No
life.
She nods, her voice smaller, almost a whisper.
SHARON
That's what you said.
He makes her wait, thinking it over.
LARRY
And you won't come around here.
You won't call. Ever.
In a moment Sharon nods.
LARRY
And I don't want you to come to
Mom and Dad's celebration...
Her eyes snap to his, surprised.
LARRY
Not the church. Not the party.
Stay away. I don't want you
around. I don't want to see you,
Shar.
After another moment, she nods again -- and he snatches
the photo out of his shirt pocket and pushes it against
her chest and walks away. The photo falls to the ground.
Larry says without turning...
LARRY
Go get a life.
... and she snaps.
(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
I got a life!
The words burst out of her, thick with tears, but she's
not crying. Larry stops and turns.
SHARON
How the hell would you know about
my life?!
LARRY
I know.
SHARON
You know nothing about me, because
you don't want to know. The
family doesn't want to know me.
Well, too bad. Sharon's got a
life. Sharon's got a boyfriend.
Sharon's going hiking in the
morning with her boyfriend. She's
not sitting alone miserable like
you want. Too bad!
She reaches down, snatches the Polaroid photo off the
ground, walks to her car, enters and slams the door as
hard as it is possible to slam it.
Moving through the panorama are two small figures on a
hiking trail, traveling uphill on a ridge.
ON SHARON, CATCH
Sharon is pounding along, barely out of breath. She
studies the beautiful view, and it helps her. It lifts
her. Catch is falling behind, breathing heavily.
CATCH
Hey. Hey!
Can you wait up a
minute?!
She waits.
He catches up.
SHARON
I thought you walked all over the
city.
(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
(gasping)
The city is flat. Okay? Can we
stop here? Can we examine the
view? Have a Milky Way? I've
burned every calorie I ever had.
But she walks on.
SHARON
My favorite lunch spot is another
half mile.
CATCH
Up?!
She smiles and walks on, and he follows, calling out.
CATCH
I'm not one of those competitive
guys, you know!
Sharon is already unpacking their lunch as Catch trudges
up and collapses near a stream-fed pond. She hands him a
sandwich, but he shakes his head.
CATCH
No thanks. I can't eat and have a
heart attack at the same time.
She smiles again and takes a bite and stares off, and
soon enough her dark thoughts come and cover her, and
Catch notices.
CATCH
As soon as you get happy, you get
sad.
SHARON
I'm okay.
Everything's code four.
CATCH
Everything's what?
SHARON
Everything's fine.
CATCH
Fine? This isn't fine. I know
fine. This is something else.
Something happened yesterday.
(CONTINUED)
74.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
Yesterday -- you mean you want to
hear about it?
CATCH
Sure I do.
SHARON
No kidding. Why? You never talk
about yesterday.
CATCH
All my days are the same.
He keeps staring, waiting. She is chewing a sandwich,
looking at him. Finally, she begins -- with no emotion.
SHARON
Yesterday. Okay. Yesterday we
rolled on a 415. Juliette and
Sanchez had these four guys
against a wall, but they were
H.D.B. and definitely unco-op. It
got pretty jumpy, but we got them
in the car with a couple of
bruises and Robby got a sprained
wrist, so I did the rest of the
shift with a rookie who lost it
over a D.B. in Sunset Park, old
woman who'd been dead maybe six,
seven days, and I usually do all
right but the smell got to me, and
I can still smell her. Then we
arrested a prostitute working out
of her home, and I carried her
little girl out to the social
worker, and the kid was holding on
real tight and making my shoulder
wet and I wanted to punch her
rock-head mother, and then shift
ended and I had a nice visit with
my brother Larry.
He is staring at her.
He takes her hands, holds them.
CATCH
(softly)
I'm sorry. That would make
anybody sad.
SHARON
Sorry you asked?
(CONTINUED)
75.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
No.
No, you can always tell me.
She stares a moment, then speaks with an irony he doesn't
pick up on.
SHARON
Well... I feel better now.
You
feel better?
CATCH
I feel fine.
Great.
He takes off his T-shirt and begins stripping off his
shorts, his underwear!
SHARON
What are you doing?!
She is surprised, smiling, as he plunges into the pond,
her darkness dissipating.
SHARON
Catch! There's no swimming here!
And you can't be naked in a state
park!
He dives under and surfaces again.
CATCH
Take the day off, Pogo!
SHARON
What if a park ranger comes?!
He dives and surfaces once more.
We STAY CLOSE ON him.
CATCH
Take your badge off for once.
Don't be such a damn Marine about
everything. Just...
He stops because she isn't there. He looks about. Then
suddenly he sees her, poised on a boulder right above
him, in her underwear about to dive! He yelps and gets
out of her way, and she dives off the rock in classic,
near-professional form, a beautiful, sleek dive. She
hits the water just right and surfaces, and they splash
and swim and frolic and dunk each other in unabashed
play.
(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED:
At one point she jumps at him to dunk him, and he catches
her. They are in chest-deep water and their faces are
close. They pause -- then she goes in for a kiss, but he
pulls his head back, avoiding that kiss and says...
CATCH
Someplace I've never been kissed.
She smiles, staring, then slowly reaches her hands to his
face, gently closes his eyes and is about to kiss him on
the closed lids, but she changes her mind and instead
puts her lips tenderly on each of the small scars on his
face. Then she moves away. He opens his eyes. She
walks to the shore, moves to her clothes and starts
getting dried and dressed, giving him a soft look.
Catch comes to the shore
to dry himself, but as he
dresses, Sharon glances
at his body -- and the scarring
on his chest and arms.
He is troubled about this,
avoiding her eyes. Then
he makes a decision.
CATCH
They tell me I was in an accident.
Long time ago.
SHARON
Looks like a bad one.
CATCH
I don't remember it.
I...
She waits -- but he says no more. She continues
to
dress, sliding her shorts over her wet underwear
-- but
before she puts her shirt on, she turns her back
to take
off her wet bra. He glances at her. She looks
over and
catches him glancing. They both smile softly,
ironically, as they finish dressing.
SHARON
We should be thinking about lunch.
We have to pack up.
CATCH
So soon?
SHARON
Some of us have to work.
(teasing)
You ever work?
CATCH
Yeah.
I worked.
(CONTINUED)
77.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
Oh?
You remember that?
Working?
She smiles and walks off toward the food. He stares
after her, his smile fading into thoughtfulness, memory,
as he dresses.
Catch is standing outside, looking in through the large
window, searching. His eyes settle on a man, and he
stares. The man, about his age, is having coffee and
reading the paper. Catch is staring deeply, mustering
his courage. He walks into the place.
In a seedy parking lot, tough part of town, Robby and
Sharon are arresting two teenage girls. One of them is
leaning on the car as Sharon searches her. Robby stands
back with the other (cuffed) girl. Robby is staring at
Sharon through this moment -- noting the difference in
her, still very professional -- but softer. The girl is
upset, near tears. Sharon is gentle in her search.
SHARON
I have to check these jacket
pockets. What's your name --
Allison?
The girl nods, not trusting her voice.
SHARON
I need to unsnap this, Allison.
I'm checking your waistband. You
got to Whitney School?
ALLISON
St. Mark's.
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
Sharon is searching, Robby is noting all this, his eyes
appreciating the difference.
SHARON
Lift your arms higher. Got a good
basketball team at St. Mark's.
You play basketball?
Sharon and Robby are still on the job, their unit rolling
down a residential street of apartment buildings. A
parked car is BLASTING MUSIC, and Robby halts beside it.
Sharon starts making dancing moves to the MUSIC, sitting
there beside Robby, and he stares at her as she grooves,
kidding it. Then Robby HITS the HORN to get the driver's
attention in the parked car. Robby makes a gesture to
lower the volume, and the man SNAPS OFF his TAPE. Robby
rolls on, glancing at Sharon. She wears a small smile,
checking their beat.
ROBBY
What's going on, Pogo?
You're not
happy or anything?
SHARON
Well, it's a mix, Robby. Life is
shit, but I'm dating this great
dead guy.
She smiles at Robby's look.
SHARON
He says before I came along, he
thought he was dead. Sounds
better when he says it --
(stops abruptly)
Listen.
ROBBY
What?
SHARON
Shhh.
Sh!
Robby stops the unit, rolling the windows down.
They
hear the FARAWAY SOUND of...
SHARON
The trumpet player.
Robby pulls over.
(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED:
ROBBY
This time we got his ass.
They exit the car and stand in the street, looking up,
scanning the dark buildings -- but the sound is hard to
track, a FAINT BALLAD on a skillful HORN.
SHARON
Wow.
ROBBY
Got 'im?
SHARON
Look at that moon.
They stare at the full moon. In a moment, we hear the
sound of ROARING CARS, their TIRES SCREECHING as they
turn onto this street, one car speeding ahead to cut off
the other and force it to stop. The two male drivers are
screaming at each other. Robby shakes his head.
ROBBY
Full moon, man. Hey!
They run toward the drivers who are exiting their cars to
confront each other. One big guy carries a baseball bat.
Robby heads off one DRIVER while Sharon intercepts the
BAT-MAN.
DRIVER
This guy's crazy!
BAT-MAN
This asshole side-swiped me!
SHARON
Are you McGuire?
BAT-MAN
What?!
SHARON
Mark McGuire?
BAT-MAN
No.
SHARON
Then put that bat away.
Put it in
your trunk. Now.
The man hesitates, then moves toward his trunk.
(CONTINUED)
81.
CONTINUED:
DRIVER
I never touched his car.
BAT-MAN
You lying bastard!
The man charges, bat in hand, and Sharon makes a flying
tackle, bringing him down hard on the street -- and we
immediately...
CUT TO:
Just after dawn. Catch is on the couch, stirring in his
sleep, in the grip of an unsettling dream. We hear what
he hears: the VOICES of his wife, his son, murmurings.
We're not sure of the words, even laughter. Catch's eyes
snap open, jolted out of sleep, but the VOICES don't
stop, and he suddenly sits up. The VOICES FADE as he
catches his breath, gulping air. He tries to calm down.
In a moment, he rises and moves to Sharon's bedroom.
We keep the sound of CATCH'S TRUMPET going as he and
Sharon exit the club and begin to stroll away, arms
around each other. In a moment, he stops. He can't go
another step. He has to kiss her. He holds her face and
comes in for the kiss, and above the music we hear her
say softly.
SHARON
Where I've never been kissed.
He stops and stares a moment, then takes her hand and
walks her out into the middle of the traffic-less
boulevard and there, in the center of the street, kisses
her, and she responds, and it is their finest, fullest
moment, lifting on the MUSIC, and it is ironic and
prophetic that at its peak they are washed over by the
revolving light from a police car and a SIREN that CHIRPS
once as they break, staring.
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
Oh, God.
We WIDEN to see Ray and Sanchez in their police unit 20
feet away. Ray uses a small electronic bullhorn to
say...
RAY
Are you in danger there?
SHARON
Go away.
RAY
I was talking to him, Pogo.
CATCH
No thanks, Ray. Everything's code
four. Go away.
Sharon laughs aloud and walks (with Catch in hand) to the
police car, her joy overwhelming any embarrassment. She
gestures behind them at the jazz club.
SHARON
See that place? He's going to be
playing there every weekend.
Catch notes the pride with which she says this.
RAY
(impressed; to Catch)
Oh, yeah? What d'you play?
SHARON
It's music, Ray. You wouldn't
like it.
She waves and walks off with Catch, arms around each
other. The cops watch them go.
DISSOLVE TO:
Sharon is asleep, alone in the tousled bed.
Catch is walking Bob in the park, but is also checking
for someone, studying the playground. He begins walking
toward the swings.
ANGLE - SANDBOX
Tommy, Catch's neighbor, is playing in the sand with a
metal truck. Catch walks up to Tommy, carrying a bulging
plastic bag -- but Tommy's attention is on Bob, and pets
the big, friendly dog.
ANGLE - CANDACE
She sits on a bench nearby, watching this, smiling a bit.
89.
ON CATCH, TOMMY
Catch kneels in the sand, beside the boy, and he spills
out the contents of the bag -- action figures,
superheroes, soldiers. Tommy goes wide-eyed at the
array. Catch is pleased by the boy's reaction. Catch
keeps a layer of emotion covered here.
CATCH
You like these?
TOMMY
Yeah!
CATCH
Well... They're for you. We can
pretend it's your birthday.
Tommy stares at him, then back at the toys in delight.
Candace is walking toward them, and Catch turns to her.
CATCH
I hope you don't mind.
TOMMY
They're for me, Mom!
Her look of surprise questions him.
CATCH
Yeah. I've... kind of been saving
them up.
CANDACE
For Tommy?
He nods. She kneels close to her boy, the toys, pleased
but not quite knowing what to say.
CANDACE
Well, thank you. Thanks a lot.
Catch nods, grins at Tommy who is already at play with
the figures.
ANGLE - SHARON
She has entered the park and witnessed this from a
distance. She is angling toward the playground.
ON CATCH
He watches Tommy at play with the figures, but it's
almost too much for him. He touches the boy and rises,
smiles and nods at Candace and begins to walk off.
90.
ON SHARON
She hurries her steps to intersect with Catch.
ON CANDACE, TOMMY
CANDACE
Wow, Tommy -- Look at them all.
Did you say thank you?
Now Tommy looks up. Catch is moving away with Bob,
walking home. Tommy stands up, Candace calls out to stop
Catch.
CANDACE
Excuse me!
ON CATCH
But he is walking on, some of the emotion seeping
through, not darkness, some old joy welling up. We see,
in b.g., Tommy starts to run after him to say thanks. We
now have a convergence of Tommy, Sharon and Catch, who is
moving steadily toward the street, crossing a bike path
now. A BIKER is coming on. All in one moment Catch
hears the WHIZZ of the BIKE, Tommy calling out "Thank
you," and Candace shouting "Be careful!" And Catch goes
cold inside and turns quickly and rushes onto the bike
path, taking the collision with the bike so Tommy is sure
to be safe. Catch and the biker fall hard. Sharon stops
-- holding her breath. Tommy watches, wide-eyed, and
Candace comes running.
Catch is rising, a little sore and soiled.
The biker is
angry.
BIKER
Goddammit -- I saw the kid.
Jesus. I wasn't even close.
But Catch is walking
away with that frozen, numb look,
all shut down by his
fear and his memory as Bob trots
along beside him and
the Biker comes after him and Tommy
and Candace watch him
go and Sharon hurries her steps to
catch up. The Biker
reaches Catch first.
BIKER
Wait a minute!
Hey!
But Catch won't turn to him, walking on -- and the man
gets in front of him, raging.
(CONTINUED)
91.
CONTINUED:
BIKER
Why the hell did you cause a
wreck?! I told you -- I saw the
kid, you idiot. I was...
Pain and darkness build in Catch's eyes until he says in
a quiet, choked voice, right into the Biker's face...
CATCH
One more word, and your life will
change forever.
The man stops talking, looking at the dead certainty in
Catch's eyes. He wants to say more, to save face, but
Catch's look holds him like a fist. Sharon has stopped,
frozen, watching. The Biker turns away and walks back to
his downed bike as Catch moves on. Sharon can hardly
believe all of this, following Catch again.
ON CATCH, SHARON
SHARON
Catch!
Catch!
It takes a moment for her voice to penetrate, then he
quickly turns and sees her approaching.
SHARON
Are you all right? Your elbow's
bleeding. I...
But he is tight, nearly frozen, everything held in.
SHARON
What's wrong?
He walks away from her, and this shakes her, and she
catches up again.
SHARON
Where are you going? Catch --
you're scaring me. Please...
But he walks on, desperate, and she gets in his way,
faces him.
SHARON
Please, Catch, don't... Can't you
talk to me?!
He turns and walks off, heading for the street.
(CONTINUED)
92.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
Please.
Wait.
I... Catch!
He has walked into traffic -- not completely unmindful of
the cars, but desperate to get away. She watches this,
frozen, as HORNS BLARE. He has to stop in the middle of
the street to wait a moment, and he stands there,
stricken.
ON CATCH
As the traffic moves around him and the dog -- a HORN
BLARES, BRAKES SCREECH, and he thrown into a storm of...
FLASHBACKS
That come sharper and faster than before, bits and pieces
of memory outside any order: He is driving, Annie smiles
at him, headlights blind him, Annie screams, the little
boy in Annie's arms grins at him, BRAKES SCREAM, Annie
says something to him, calmly, but he can't hear her, the
headlights blind him again and BRAKES SCREAM again, and:
BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)
Catch stands there shaken and shut down.
ON SHARON
Watching him, shocked and frightened for him. She sees
the traffic let up, and Catch crosses and walks toward
home. She watches him go.
As Robby and Sharon's police unit moves along with
traffic. In a moment they pull over and park beside an
office building. It is the same building the man entered
shouting, "Catch!" Sharon watches the building's
entrance. After a while...
ROBBY
Are you going to tell me why we're
sitting outside this building
again?
SHARON
Watching for somebody.
Tall guy.
40s. Grey-blond hair.
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:
ROBBY
What's it about?
SHARON
It's personal.
ROBBY
Fine -- what am I supposed to do?
SHARON
Chill.
She watches the building, studying the people who come
and go.
Sharon is still staking out the office building. Robby
is fidgeting. She just keeps watching. When Robby
begins to speak, she puts up a hand to stop him, going
very still, staring out the window at the man who Catch
was afraid of, Richard Pindella. The man enters the
building. Sharon gets out of the car, intense...
SHARON
Give me fifteen.
And she hurries after the man.
Catch waits on a busy street corner in Westwood Village
not far from Santa Monica. He is waiting, glancing over
the passing crowds for Sharon. He sees her. She is off
duty, out of uniform. He watches her until she spots
him. She smiles a little, but there is a mix of fear and
sadness in her smile. They walk to each other and stop
and hug, but it is brief, and then she keeps walking
slowly, and he walks beside her. There is a strain
lingering between them.
CATCH
Shar, I'm sorry about yesterday.
I...
SHARON
That's okay.
CATCH
It's hard to explain, but it's...
I'm okay now.
SHARON
You don't have to explain.
He glances at her, wondering, walking along.
CATCH
So... why'd we meet here?
SHARON
So you're the trumpet player who
was waking people up -- on my
beat.
They walk along in silence a moment.
CATCH
I used to practice late...
outside. On my roof.
SHARON
On your roof? That's why we
couldn't find you.
(CONTINUED)
101.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
I didn't know it bothered anybody
until you mentioned it. You
arresting me?
They smile nervous smiles. She walks on, leading him
somewhere. He looks about, beginning to show some
agitation, but covering it.
CATCH
You going to tell me where we're
going?
(as she doesn't
answer)
That's okay. I mean... I'll go
anywhere with you, Shar. Jaws of
death. The mall on a Saturday.
Just about any...
He slows his steps, looking across the street and down
half a block...
HIS POV
We see an ivy-covered brick building there, with a sign
that is too far away for us to read.
ON CATCH AND SHARON
He looks quickly away from that building.
She sees his
growing agitation.
SHARON
You can trust me, you know.
She takes his hand.
SHARON
I've got you now. I'm holding on
-- like before.
CATCH
What d'you mean?
SHARON
Like I held you before.
Like I
did -- at the accident.
He suddenly pulls his hand out of hers, shocked, and it
shakes her.
(CONTINUED)
102.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
What makes it so... unspeakable,
Catch? What makes it like that?
He begins to shut down, to grow cold and numb and not
hear this.
SHARON
Is it because you were driving?
He turns away, closing his eyes.
SHARON
I read the reports, and it wasn't
your fault. It wasn't. Is it
because you survived and they
didn't?
She puts her hand out for him again.
SHARON
Catch. Please. Hold on, and
we'll go in there together...
He does not take her hand, so she takes his and walks a
few steps toward that building.
SHARON
You can talk to them. You can say
goodbye or I love you or
whatever...
He pulls his hand away again, more violently, a layer of
rage over his pain.
CATCH
This is wrong! It's wrong!
Why
are you doing this?!
SHARON
To help you.
CATCH
I don't need your help! I don't
need this. We don't need this --
we're fine...
SHARON
We're not. We're not fine, Catch.
Nothing is fine -- no matter how
much you pretend.
It is as if she's fighting for his life again -- and her
own.
(CONTINUED)
103.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
You pretend that nothing happened.
You walk all over the city helping
people, but you're dying inside.
CATCH
I'm not dying! I'm not
pretending! I don't remember! I
don't remember any of it. So
leave me alone! What good does it
do? It's gone! And I'm all right
this way! Why do you have to
change it? I'm all right.
She points at the building across the street.
SHARON
Then walk in there.
He can't even look at the place.
SHARON
Walk in there, and I'll walk in
with you. Walk in there and say
it's real -- what happened is
real. Your family died.
CATCH
Don't talk about that!
Don't!
SHARON
(breaking down)
All right -- you talk about it!
You tell me your family died and I
say yes, I know, I'm sorry, and
you say, I loved them... and I
say, what an awful thing to lose a
family...
CATCH
(unravelling)
Damn you, Shar. Damn you -- why
won't you stop?!
SHARON
So you can have a life!
CATCH
I have a life! We could have a
life. We could get up and go to
work and come home to each other
and never, never talk about
before. We don't need to do that!
Why do we need to do that?!
(CONTINUED)
104.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
Because it happened! Because it's
the truth! I'm sorry. I'm so
sorry it happened, but...
CATCH
Nothing happened! If we say it,
then that's the truth, that can be
the truth. Say it. Nothing
happened. Say it, Shar.
SHARON
Catch -- take my hand.
Please.
CATCH
Say it!
I'm asking you to say it.
Her tears come, and she shakes her head.
SHARON
I can't.
CATCH
Why not?
SHARON
Because I want it too much. I
want everything with you. I want
all of you -- not just the part
that isn't hiding and running
away...
CATCH
Why are
you pushing so hard? Why
does it
have to be your way? Why
does it
have to be your truth?
This is
who I am! This is the way
I am!
SHARON
Not anymore. It doesn't have to
be this way anymore because you're
not alone -- because we're the
family now. We can be the
family...
CATCH
You like to push people, don't
you? You just have to push and
shove and make it right for you --
for you. You push everybody,
Shar. You even pushed your family
away, didn't you?
(CONTINUED)
105.
CONTINUED:
He has stung her. The tears are in her throat.
She has
to take a moment, but she pushes through to say
quietly...
SHARON
I just... want to say...
CATCH
You already said it.
You said it
all.
SHARON
When you're ready, I'll be there
for you. I just want to say that.
And she turns and walks away. He watches her go, angry,
scared and sorry for what he said. He takes a few steps
after her, wanting to call out and to stop her. We see
him almost call to her. He is coming apart, watching
her, needing her so much, but unable to call out.
He is shaky. He takes a glance at that building, then
away. He stares after Sharon -- but she's out of sight
now. He steels himself, then looks across the street
again at that building.
He is desperately afraid. He stares at the building a
long while. He begins to cross the street. He makes
fists to keep from shaking. He walks to the entrance.
This is the "Wellston Memorial Chapel and Mausoleum."
The sign is on one of the brick pillars. The iron gate
is open. He can't walk in there. He just can't. He
walks away quickly, as if escaping.
The new shift
of cops is heading for its cars -- Sharon
and Robby, Ray
and Sanchez, others. The mood is relaxed,
teasing talk,
but Sharon is way down. She tries to push
her mood away
and tough through it.
RAY
Rib House after shift today?
4:30?
ROBBY
I think I'll head home.
(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:
RAY
Pogo?
Bring your friend.
SHARON
No, I think I'll turn vegetarian.
RAY
Gotta have that meat to keep your
strength up.
SHARON
How come it's not working for you?
There is a scattering of laughter -- almost by rote -- as
Sharon enters her car without even the hint of a smile.
Robby notices. She just punches up the CAD monitor, all
business. Our TRUMPET MUSIC comes in, aching now, and
takes us into...
Sharon and Robby are rolling to a stop in a strip mall
parking lot, exiting their car. No rush. She's still
very downbeat. As they walk from the car, he keeps
glancing at her, concerned for her.
ROBBY
Pogo...?
She puts up a hand to brush all the words away. She
can't talk about it. She pushes through it by doing the
work.
SHARON
Which store is it?
ROBBY
The little market there. They
came through a back window last
night. Mostly vandalism...
They walk on, but as Sharon reaches the sidewalk, a
little child, three years old or so, toddles out the door
of a shop. A SKATEBOARDER is rattling along, and Sharon
makes a grab for the child, taking his arm gently...
SHARON
Whoa...
... and pulling him to safety as the Skateboarder passes
by shouting...
SKATER
Sorry!
And now the WORRIED MOTHER is emerging from the shop...
WORRIED MOTHER
Oh, God, thank you. Billy!
She picks up her boy, walks back into the shop. Sharon
stands there -- as it all blooms inside of her, rocks
her, really, this little act, evoking Catch, who he is,
what he said and what he means to her. Robby is a few
steps ahead, waiting for her, but she can't move yet,
looking around her now at the people walking among the
shops and cafes. She picks one. She catches the eyes.
She gives a brief smile. The smile is answered, shyly,
kindly, the person moves on.
ROBBY
Pogo?
She doesn't move for a moment.
Then she turns to Robby.
(CONTINUED)
108.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
There's something I have to do.
I
need an address and phone.
ROBBY
What's the name?
SHARON
Elanora Chu.
Robby looks at her, then nods, giving her this.
ROBBY
Let's do it.
They walk back to the car.
We see Sharon walking quickly from her police car to the
front of Mrs. Chu's home. Robby waits in the unit.
Sharon walks under that covered portico to the front
door, but before she rings the bell, a voice startles her
a bit.
ELANORA (O.S.)
Pogo?
Mrs. Chu emerges from the shadows of the portico, rolling
her wheelchair toward Sharon. She has a smile for her --
but with some reserve.
SHARON
I'm Sharon Pogue. I know all
about the...
ELANORA
Elanora.
Sharon nods, very held back.
She gestures toward the
wheelchair self-consciously.
SHARON
I'm sorry for... what happened.
I
know about the accident.
ELANORA
(hopeful)
He told you?!
(CONTINUED)
109.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
No. I found out, and... I
remembered. I was there.
ELANORA
Oh.
Yes.
Sharon stares a moment, begins with some of her tough
cover in place, over her emotions.
SHARON
I guess he comes here a lot -- to
talk to you.
ELANORA
He shops for me. Twice a week.
SHARON
Oh. And when he comes here -- he
never mentions the past, never
talks about the accident?
ELANORA
No.
SHARON
And you... let him do that?
All
this time? Why?
ELANORA
It's what he needs.
SHARON
Walking all over the city like...
ELANORA
Like an angel.
Yes. Sweet man.
SHARON
But... you let him get so lost.
Elanora is a bit defensive now.
ELANORA
I let him find his own way through
it. Why did you come here,
Sharon?
SHARON
Because... I want to know how to
help him.
ELANORA
You are helping him.
(CONTINUED)
110.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
I don't think so.
ELANORA
Why not?
SHARON
He... he was paying me back, I
guess, for the accident, for
helping him. That's why he
felt... so close to me. But...
ELANORA
Is that what you think?
SHARON
But now he probably hates me.
I...
ELANORA
What happened?
SHARON
I took him to the cemetery, and...
ELANORA
The cemetery!
Elanora's look darkens and she begins to shake her head
in worry.
SHARON
I thought it might help him...
come back, you know? But he
wouldn't even go in. He screamed
at me.
ELANORA
(upset)
What made you take him there?
SHARON
For the truth...
ELANORA
He knows the truth.
SHARON
But he won't even say it, or...
(CONTINUED)
111.
CONTINUED:
ELANORA
That's his way. That's his way
through all this. He made a wall
-- around that whole day, that
night -- other things, too. He
keeps them behind the wall -- his
little boy, my daughter. He can't
help it. The cemetery?! Do you
know how hard it is for me to go
to the cemetery? Can you imagine?
Sharon is shaken by this, realizing, crumbling a bit as
Mrs. Chu goes on.
ELANORA
That's where it stares you in the
face -- the loss. And it's too
much sometimes.
Elanora takes a breath, acknowledging how upset she is.
ELANORA
See? I'm still finding my way
through it. And Catch -- it
almost kills him to think about it
or say it or drive a car or see
the place where it happened or...
go by the cemetery.
SHARON
I was trying to help him... come
back to some kind of life. I...
ELANORA
But he was coming back. Do you
realize how much he changed in the
past weeks? His apartment, his
life, his music is coming back.
He fell in love! He even got a
job, Sharon -- for you. For the
two of you. Isn't that coming
back? Why do you have to rush?
Everybody has to rush these days.
Sharon, battered by the truth of this, is totally exposed
now, realizing, admitting.
SHARON
I was scared. I push so hard...
when I'm scared.
ELANORA
Scared of what?
(CONTINUED)
112.
CONTINUED:
SHARON
Losing him. So I did. I lost
him. He won't talk to me. I... I
didn't know what I was doing.
Elanora sighs, looking at her, and her anger drains away,
studying Sharon's misery.
ELANORA
You were finding your way.
What
else can we do? You think
I'm
always sure what to say to
him,
what not to say? I do what
I
think is right and hope he
sees
the love in it.
She shakes her head at Sharon's tears, her warmth showing
now, liking this girl.
ELANORA
Look at you -- so worried now, so
miserable. That's the love in it.
SHARON
Did I... make it worse for him?
ELANORA
I don't know. I really don't.
But I think he'll see the love in
what you did.
Sharon stares, without much hope. She puts out her hand
to touch Elanora's, to say goodbye. Elanora takes her
hand and holds on a moment, staring into the girl, with
strength. Sharon nods and walks off, dark and sad.
Elanora watches her go.
Catch is walking down a commercial street -- no Bob-the-
dog, no strolling gait. He is focused, deep-eyed, on a
mission of some kind. Our MUSIC CONTINUES over this and
on into...
The MUSIC CONTINUES over Sharon driving to the church,
parking, taking a deep breath, exiting the car. There is
no one else outside the church. The ceremony has already
begun. She's planned it that way. She enters the church
as the MUSIC FADES OUT.
The PRIEST'S VOICE from the church plays over this scene,
invoking the blessings, saying the prayers of the mass as
we watch Catch continuing his mission, slowing his steps
now and pausing at the entrance to the Welston Memorial
Chapel. He hesitates. We see the price he's paying and
the determination. He walks through the gate.
He walks into a courtyard of several small buildings in a
garden setting -- all red brick and ivy, fountains and
flowers. He is fighting his way through this, moving
closer to one of the buildings. He is nearly alone on
the chapel grounds, and, as he reaches the sheltered wall
of this building, he is alone.
(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:
This is a wall
of bronze vaults within the bricks, and on
each vault is
a plaque -- a name. His breath shivers in
his body as he
struggles to lift his eyes. Slowly, his
gaze comes to
rest on a name: "LAMBERT."
As he stares, the PRIEST'S VOICE from Sharon's church
FADES OUT, and we are left with silence. Catch is
shaky,. He takes a step closer to the wall, to the name,
to them -- and he tries to speak, but can't. He tries
again -- his voice intimate, just above a whisper at
first.
CATCH
Annie. Chet. I don't... want you
to think I forgot about you. It's
just that I... I couldn't find
you.
(pause)
I woke up, and you were gone.
Everything was gone. It all
just... disappeared. In one
minute. I couldn't remember that
minute. I lost it. It took me so
long to find it. I think I found
it all now. I used a calculator.
I did. I figured it out. You
know... we get about 1400 minutes
a day and so I figured it out. I
was 33 years old and three months
and eight days, so it was... I've
got it here...
He fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket. His hand
is shaking as he reads a number off the paper.
CATCH
It was minute number 17 million
eight hundred ten thousand, two
hundred... or so.
He puts the paper away.
CATCH
That's the one I lost. And...
when I lost that minute, I guess I
tried to lose it all, all the
memories -- because they hurt. I
tried, but... I couldn't do it.
We --
116.
As Larry and his family exit -- and Sharon comes out of
the church, calling ahead.
SHARON
Larry...
(CONTINUED)
119.
CONTINUED:
He starts to just walk on, ignoring her, but Kathy takes
the little boy and walks ahead, with a look at Larry, at
Sharon.
ON SHARON AND LARRY
They nod to a few passing guests. Then they're alone.
His nose is still bandaged, but less so, anger and
betrayal in his eyes.
LARRY
How did you have the guts to walk
into a church after breaking your
word?
SHARON
I have to be here. It's a chance
to make things right, and I'm
taking it.
LARRY
Why even talk go me? You got what
you wanted. You laugh about it?
You tell your cop friends how
you...
SHARON
You think I talk about it?!
You
think...
She stops herself, catching her rush toward the old
anger. She goes calmer, deeper, even sad.
SHARON
Here, Lar.
She hands him something. It is the Polaroid photo. He
looks at it, surprised. They lock eyes. She speaks
softly.
SHARON
I was invited. I'm here. I'm
going to the party. You do what
you want.
And she walks off toward the parking lot.
Sharon exits
and starts to walk away. She sees Larry Jr.
look up from
his play. He smiles at her. She returns
the smile --
it means a lot to her, and she walks on. As
she reaches
the gate, she notices something across the
street that
halts her. She stops still, surprised and so
pleased.
HER POV
Catch is there, waiting near her car, watching her now.
BACK TO SCENE - FULL SHOT
as Sharon walks to him, so glad he's there, needing him
-- but still not sure of what he's feeling about her,
until she gets close and sees his eyes and the way he
opens his arms -- and they embrace, and she holds on
tight, eyes closed.
(CONTINUED)
128.
CONTINUED:
They break the embrace, still holding on, searching each
other's eyes.
CATCH
Sorry, Shar.
For what I said.
SHARON
Me, too.
In a moment, he gestures toward the Pogue house.
CATCH
Was it bad?
SHARON
They don't like me in there.
CATCH
Then they don't deserve you in
there.
She stares a moment more, still together.
SHARON
That's a nice thing to say.
CATCH
It's not a thing to say.
It's the
truth.
She can only look away, not wanting to cry.
CATCH
Why do you try so hard not to cry?
She stares at him again. Her throat fills with tears,
mouth is trembling a bit. She starts quietly, finally,
with nothing held back -- but this is not anger as much
as mourning.
SHARON
It's not fair.
The tears come, and she doesn't fight them, emptying the
old, old wound, speaking through her weeping now. The
first time we've seen her cry.
SHARON
It's not fair. Things got better
for them because of what I did.
Things got better, and I'd still
do it. I'd do it all over again.
And it's not fair they shut me
out. It's not.
(CONTINUED)
129.
CONTINUED:
CATCH
No.
SHARON
It's not fair. I was
19, and I
didn't know what else
to do. I
didn't know how else
to stop it.
It's not fair I don't
have a
family anymore.
CATCH
No.
It's not, Shar.
It's not.
He raises his hands to her face, places a palm gently on
each cheek, and she covers his hands with her own and
closes her eyes. They remain that way awhile. In a
moment he lightly kisses her forehead. There is a depth
to his words...
CATCH
We're the family, Pogo.
She opens her eyes, staring deep into
his. He has said
it all -- as it is and as it will be.
She smiles a bit
through her tears and nods. He puts
an arm around her
shoulder and holds her tight against
him as they walk to
her car. She puts an arm around his
waist.
They reach the car, and she unlocks it, gets in behind
the wheel as Catch gets into the passenger seat.
Catch comes around to Sharon's window. She rolls the
window down, concerned, wondering what he's doing. Is he
leaving? But he reaches for her door and opens it and
says without a fuss...
CATCH
I'll drive.
She stares a long moment,
realizing,
but also making no
fuss about it as she gets
out of the
car, walks around
and enters the passenger
side. They
close the car doors.
Catch STARTS the CAR and
drives them
away. Drives them
home.
FADE OUT.
