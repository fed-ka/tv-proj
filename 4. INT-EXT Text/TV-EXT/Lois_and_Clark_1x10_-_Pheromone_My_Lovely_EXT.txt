				LUTHOR
		Nigel, call Miranda.  Ask her to
		come to my study tomorrow at 5:00.

				NIGEL
		Very good, sir.
			(beat)
		You'll forgive me for asking, sir,
		but I thought you had... cancelled
		her.

				LUTHOR
		Well, I've had a change of heart.
		It seems I was wrong about her.
		Apparently, she has developed a
		formula that renders people
		incapable of resisting their animal
		urges.

				NIGEL
		And that would be of some service
		to you?

				LUTHOR
		Oh, yes, yes indeed.  You see, I've
		always thought of myself as an
		opportunist, and what we have here
		is an... opportunity.  If you
		control men's hearts, their minds 
		will follow.  For example, a 
		politician, owned by me, is losing 
		in the polls.  A dashing fellow, 
		but the kind that women love only 
		from afar.  The night before 	*
		elections, a little whiff through 	*
		the auditorium, the theater... the 	*
		result... a landslide.  Or, I wish 
		to by a company or two at a 
		bargain price.  A spray here, a dab 
		there... how could they deny me?

				NIGEL
		Very ingenious.

				LUTHOR
		Thank you, Nigel.  That's what, as
		they say, I get the big bucks for.

	Lois takes another bite of her salad.  Luthor hasn't

				LOIS
		What is it, Lex?  Are you feeling

		Of course.  I am never sick.  I

	Lois is not quite sure what to make of this.

		Huh.  Thank you.

	Lois pulls up in her car, walks into the open hangar.  A
	plane is ready for take-off.  Big barrels of the fruit fly
	spray, malathion, are in evidence.

				LOIS

		Miranda?

	Miranda appears out of nowhere.  She's wearing a black

	Lois looks into another part of the hangar, sees several

	turns to Miranda, who takes out a different atomizer from
	her pocket and sprays Lois, who starts to cough.	*

		Why me?

	Lois starts to lose consciousness, falls to the floor.	*
	Miranda kneels beside her.	*

	Superman, using his telescopic vision, desperately

	As the plane taxis down the runway, a very groggy Lois
	wakes to find herself hanging over a vat.  A sign above it
	reads:  Toxic Malathion.  Hand-lettered below the sign is	*
	a note which reads:  "Bye Lois.  Have a nice, slow	*
	death.  Love, Miranda."  The noise that woke Lois was the	*
	pulley starting up, now slowly lowering her into the
	deadly chemicals.  She starts SCREAMING.



	Superman hears Lois' screams, swoops down.



	Lois is about to reach the toxic mixture when Superman
	lands.  Superman pushes the vat aside, then melts the	*
	rope with HEAT VISION.  Lois falls into his arms. Just	*
	then, Lex's limo pulls up, with the police right behind.

				SUPERMAN
		Are you all right?

		Yes, now I am. But... the plane.
