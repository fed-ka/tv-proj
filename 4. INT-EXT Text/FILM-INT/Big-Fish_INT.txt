WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD
BLOOM, 40's and handsome, tells the story. In every gesture,
Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with
absolute conviction.
EDWARD
I didn't put any stock into such
speculation or superstition. All I
knew was I'd been trying to catch
that fish since I was a boy no bigger
than you.
(closer)
And on the day you were born, that
was the day I finally caught him.
Edward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming
dance. She is enjoying the story, but also the force of
Edward's charisma. He's hypnotizing.
EDWARD (CONT'D)
The Beast jumped up and grabbed it
before the ring even hit the water.
And just as fast, he snapped clean
through that line.
WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. His
mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and
practicality -- stands with him at the door.
EDWARD
You can see my predicament. My wedding
ring, the symbol of fidelity to my
wife, soon to be the mother of my
child, was now lost in the gut of an
uncatchable fish.
ON WILL AND SANDRA
WILL
(low but insistent)
Make him stop.
His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie.
WILL'S DATE
What did you do?
EDWARD
I followed that fish up-river and
down-river for three days and three
nights, until I finally had him boxed
in.
Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.
EDWARD
With these two hands, I reached in
and snatched that fish out of the
river. I looked him straight in the
eye. And I made a remarkable
discovery.
WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE. This
is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and
family. They should be joyful, but Will is furious.
Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast. The room is
cozy and drunk.
EDWARD
This fish, the Beast. The whole time
we were calling it a him, when in
fact it was a her. It was fat with
eggs, and was going to lay them any
day.
Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from
the restrooms. She looks gorgeous. She couldn't be any happier
if this were her own wedding.
EDWARD
Now, I was in a situation. I could
gut that fish and get my ring back,
but doing so I would be killing the
smartest catfish in the Ashton River,
soon to be mother of a hundred others.
Will can't take any more. Josephine tries to hold him back,
but he gets up and leaves. Edward doesn't even notice.
EDWARD
Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-
born son the chance to catch a fish
like this of his own? This lady fish
and I, well, we had the same destiny.
As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father --
EDWARD AND WILL
We were part of the same equation.
Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.
SANDRA
Honey, it's still your night.
Will can't articulate his anger. He just leaves.
EDWARD
Now, you may well ask, since this
lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief,
why did it strike so quick on gold
when nothing else would attract it?
(closer; he holds up
his ring)
That was the lesson I learned that
day, the day my son was born.
He focuses his words on Sandra. This story is -- and has
always been -- about her more than anyone.
EDWARD
Sometimes, the only way to catch an
uncatchable woman is to offer her a
wedding ring.
A LAUGH from the crowd.
Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him. As she
crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not
lessened their affection for each other.
As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.
The crowd APPLAUDS.
Edward toasts the happy couple. Josephine covers well for
her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.
Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.
A typically busy day. On hold with the phone cradled under
an ear, Will sorts through a bundle of mail dropped on his
desk.
WILL (ON PHONE)
(without pauses)
William Bloom with the Associated
Press if I could just...
He's put back on hold. Returning to the mail, he finds a
hand-addressed envelope. Rips it open.
WILL (V.O.)
We communicated indirectly I guess.
In her letters and Christmas cards,
my mother would write for both of
them.
At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a
sandwich.
WILL (V.O.)
When I'd call, Mom would say that
Dad was out driving. Or swimming in
the pool.
Edward takes a seat, starting to eat his sandwich.
WILL
True to form, we never talked about
our not talking.
Sandra stands by the window, watching as...
Young Dr. Bennett stands between the Wife's legs. She's
flustered and sweating, but the doctor has a comforting
bedside manner...
YOUNG DR. BENNETT
Now, Mrs. Bloom, I'll need you to
give me one good push. On three.
One...
Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets
into the doctor's unprepared hands. Bennett tries to hold
tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish. It shoots up
into air.
The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one
can hold it. As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we
can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.
As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides
it a ramp to slide right out of the room. Everyone races
after it.
Bursting through the doors --
YOUNG DR. BENNETT
Grab that baby!
A NURSE finally scoops up the slippery baby. Everyone lets
out a collective sigh of relief.
WILL (V.O.)
My father's birth would set the pace
for his unlikely life. No longer
than most men's, but larger. And as
strange as his stories got, the
endings were always the most
surprising of all.
Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair. By the
tone of the ring, we know we're not in the U.S. -- it has
that insistent European sound.
As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly
empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes. A cradle is still in
its carton.
KEYS in the lock. LAUGHTER in the hallway. The door swings
open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of
groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain. His wife
Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone.
JOSEPHINE
Allo oui?
Will begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer
unleashing a new drizzle. He plays it up, trying to get a
reaction out of Josephine.
JOSEPHINE
(on phone)
Yes, he's here.
She hands the phone to Will, concerned.
JOSEPHINE
It's your mother.
Half-stripped, Will takes the phone. This won't be good news.
WILL
(on phone)
Hi. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
As Josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very,
very pregnant. She listens carefully to Will's side of the
conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is.
WILL (CONT'D)
What does Dr. Bennett say? Okay. No,
sure, let me talk to him. I'll wait.
He covers the mouthpiece. Looks over to Josephine.
JOSEPHINE
It's bad.
WILL
It's more than they thought. They're
going to stop chemo.
JOSEPHINE
You need to go.
WILL
Probably tonight.
A beat.
JOSEPHINE
I'm going with you.
WILL
You don't have to.
JOSEPHINE
(a simple fact)
I'm going with you.
As the plane continues boarding, a STEWARDESS recites the
welcome spiel in French. Will has a window seat in coach.
Josephine sits beside him, putting on hand lotion.
Taking his hands, she rubs the excess into him. There's an
effortless intimacy between them. She can pinpoint what he's
feeling before he can.
Hours later, and the lights are dimmed. Most of the PASSENGERS
are asleep, including Josephine. Her head is propped against
Will's shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly.
Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair. A beat, then
he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.
Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands
to cast shadows on the seat back. The kid is pretty good,
making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a
dog.
We PUSH IN on the silhouettes.
EDWARD (O.S., PRELAP)
So which one's it gonna be? The Monkey
in the Barn, the Dog in the Road?
Focusing on the final shadow, we...
MATCH CUT TO:
...come to find Edward making the shapes.
Will (6) sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him. The
endtable lamp lies between them, its shade off to cast big
shadows on the wall.
WILL
The one about the witch.
EDWARD
Your mom says I can't tell you that
one anymore. You get nightmares.
WILL
I'm not scared.
Edward looks around for a beat, seeing if his wife is in
earshot. He then leans in, complicitous.
EDWARD
Neither was I. At first.
Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story.
EDWARD
This all happened in the swamp outside
of Ashton. Kids weren't supposed to
go out in the swamp, on account of
the snakes and spiders and quicksand
that would swallow you up before you
could even scream. But there were
five of us out there that night: Me,
Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price
Brothers, Don and Zacky.
Edward holds up his hand, counting the names on his fingers.
EDWARD
Not a one of us knew what was in
store.
As his hand moves past the light, we
COME TO:
A flashlight SWEEPS past. We are...
Twenty-year old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile,
face mushed in the grout. Very much dead.
The front door opens to reveal Will and Josephine on the
porch with their bags. REVERSE to Will's mother Sandra (53),
surprised and a little annoyed.
SANDRA
How did you get here?
WILL
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that
big really.
SANDRA
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up
at the airport.
WILL
We rented a car.
SANDRA
(simply)
You didn't need to do that. You just
didn't.
A beat. Starting over...
WILL
Hi, Mom.
He leans in and hugs her. She surrenders, squeezing her son
tight. Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth --
strong-willed but practical. They've always been close.
SANDRA
I'm so glad you're here.
That hug finished, Sandra pushes past her son to her daughter-
in-law. Seeing the size of her belly --
SANDRA
You shouldn't have flown. But...
They hug.
JOSEPHINE
It's good to see you. You look
beautiful.
It's not flattery. It's the truth.
SANDRA
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
JOSEPHINE
Yes.
SANDRA
Down the hall on the right. The door
sticks. You have to really pull it.
Josephine squeezes past, a smile to her husband -- be nice.
Will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage. Sandra
follows him.
Coming down the driveway, we get to see the house for the
first time: an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for
the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot. KIDS are
playing on the street.
WILL
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
SANDRA
He's up with your father.
Heading back to the house...
WILL
How is he?
SANDRA
He's impossible. He won't eat. And
because he won't eat, he gets weaker.
And because he's weaker, he doesn't
want to eat.
WILL
How much time does he have left?
SANDRA
You don't talk about those things.
Not yet.
Sandra is pouring iced tea for Will and Josephine.
DR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded
from coming down the stairs. He was the town's first Black
physician. He's still the town's best physician.
DR. BENNETT
Will.
WILL
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.
(they shake)
My wife, Josephine.
DR. BENNETT
A pleasure.
He judges her belly.
DR. BENNETT
You're seven months.
JOSEPHINE
(impressed)
To the day.
He leans close to her, whispering in her ear...
DR. BENNETT
It's a boy.
She smiles, surprised but not doubting. Will looks over --
what did he say? Josephine shakes her head.
Back to the main subject...
SANDRA
You don't think he looks any worse.
DR. BENNETT
No. I would say he's the same.
And in the silence that follows, a lot is said. It wasn't
the upbeat reply Sandra was hoping for.
WILL
Can I see him?
DR. BENNETT
Absolutely. Be good for you to talk
to him.
A moment of awkwardness -- everyone here knows they haven't
spoken in years.
Sandra hands Will a squat can of Ensure from the case on the
counter.
SANDRA
Get him to drink one of these. He
won't, but tell him he has to.
Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs.
They CREAK with every step.
The wall is filled with family photos, happier times. Most
of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant
and ending at his wedding. As he climbs the stairs, we can
see him growing up with every step.
A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the
end of the hallway. Will walks towards it, running a hand
along the wallpaper.
Almost at the door, he stops for a beat. Gets his breath.
Then goes inside.
Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed. Although he's not
the vibrant man we've seen before, it's not as bad we feared.
The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.
There are no I.V.'s, no monitors, nothing.
Coming up to the bed --
WILL
Dad?
Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses. He tries
to say something, but no words come out.
He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand. Will pours him
a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips.
Finished, Edward sets down the glass by himself. A very long,
tense beat. Will almost speaks again to fill the silence.
Finally...
EDWARD
You --
(he points)
-- are in for a surprise.
WILL
Am I?
EDWARD
Having a kid changes everything. I
mean, there's the diapers and the
burping and the midnight feedings...
WILL
Did you do any of that?
EDWARD
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then
you spend years trying to corrupt
and mislead this child, fill its
head with nonsense and still it turns
out perfectly fine.
WILL
You think I'm up for it?
EDWARD
You learned from the best.
Will doesn't rise to the challenge. A beat, then he remembers
the can of Ensure. Holds it up. Edward recoils.
WILL
Just drink half the can. I'll tell
her you drank the whole thing.
Everyone wins.
A beat, then Edward rolls his eyes. Fine. Will cracks open
the can, finding a straw on the nightstand.
EDWARD
People needn't worry so much. It's
not my time yet. This isn't how I
go.
WILL
Really.
EDWARD
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
WILL
The Old Lady by the swamp.
EDWARD
She was a witch.
WILL
No, she was old and probably senile.
Maybe schizophrenic.
EDWARD
I saw my death in that eye. And this
is not how it happens.
WILL
So how does it happen?
EDWARD
Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to
ruin it for you.
Edward slurps down as much of the Ensure as he can stand,
then pushes the can away. He swallows with difficulty.
EDWARD
There was this panhandler who used
to stop me every morning when I came
out of this coffee shop near the
office.
WILL
Okay.
EDWARD
And every day I gave him a quarter.
Every day. Then I got sick and was
out for a couple of weeks. And when
I went back there, you know what he
said?
WILL
What did he say?
EDWARD
You owe me three-fifty.
WILL
Really.
EDWARD
True story.
A beat.
WILL
When did you ever work in an office?
EDWARD
There's a lot you don't know about
me.
WILL
You're right.
Edward gives a wry smile. He walked into that.
EDWARD
Your mother was worried we wouldn't
talk again. And look at us. We're
talking fine. We're storytellers,
both of us. I speak mine out, you
write yours down. Same thing.
Will won't commit to Edward's assessment.
WILL
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about
some things while I'm here.
EDWARD
You mean, while I'm here.
WILL
I'd just like to know the true
versions of things. Events. Stories.
You.
Edward LAUGHS a little, which becomes a COUGH. The HACKING
escalates until another drink of water gets it under control.
It's not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from
talking.
EDWARD
Your mother hasn't been keeping up
the pool. If you wanted to you
could...
WILL
I will.
EDWARD
You know where the chemicals are?
WILL
I used to do it when you were gone,
remember? I used to do it a lot.
He didn't mean for that to sound so pointed. Taking the half-
empty Ensure, Will gets up to go. He's at the door when...
EDWARD
I was never much for being at home,
Will. It's too confining. And this,
here. Being stuck in bed. Dying is
the worst thing that ever happened
to me.
He smiles at his joke.
WILL
I thought you weren't dying.
EDWARD
I said this isn't how I go. The last
part is much more unusual. Trust me
on that.
Shutting the door behind himself, Will drinks the rest of
the Ensure himself. Edward was right. It tastes horrible.
Heading for the stairs, Will walks past an open door. As he
leaves frame, we STAY BEHIND to look inside...
...where an eight-year old Will is propped up in bed, his
face covered with chicken pox and pink calamine lotion. He's
showing Edward how many bumps there are on his arm.
YOUNG WILL
Dr. Bennett says I'm going to have
to be home for a week.
EDWARD
That's nothing. I once had to stay
in bed for three years.
YOUNG WILL
Did you have chicken pox?
EDWARD
I wish.
CUT TO:
Wearing a white shirt and tie, YOUNG EDWARD -- still about
10 -- sings "Down to the River My Lord" along with the
CONGREGATION. His voice is high and thin, but he gives it
his all.
Suddenly, his voice CRACKS and DROPS a half-octave. And then
another. His friends Wilbur Freeley and Ruthie look over,
wondering what's wrong. Embarrassed, Edward just keeps
SINGING, trying to follow along with the baritone part.
He pulls at his collar. Then pulls again, his face getting
red. Starting to panic, he loosens his tie. He's starting to
undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself. Two more
buttons fly off. One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.
ON HIS SHOES
As we watch, Edward's pant cuffs rise inch by inch -- that's
how fast he's growing.
EDWARD (V.O.)
Truth is, no one quite knew what was
wrong. Most times, a person grows up
gradually. I found myself in a hurry.
Young Edward lies in bed, his limbs connected to various
pulleys and levers to support his weight. He has a dozen
encyclopedias around him, and another dozen on the floor.
EDWARD (V.O.)
My muscles couldn't keep up with my
bones, and my bones couldn't keep up
with my body's ambition. So I spent
the better part of three years
confined to my bed, with the World
Book Encyclopedia being my only means
of exploration. I had made it all
the way to the "G's," hoping to find
an answer to my gigantificationism,
when I uncovered an article about
the common goldfish.
INSERT: The encyclopedia article, complete with drawings.
YOUNG EDWARD
(reading)
"Kept in a small bowl, the goldfish
will remain small. With more space,
the fish can grow double, triple, or
quadruple its size."
Young Edward thinks this through.
EDWARD (V.O.)
It occurred to me then, that perhaps
the reason for my growth was that I
was intended for larger things. After
all, a giant man can't have an
ordinary-sized life.
Edward takes an impossible shot at the buzzer from the other
end of the court. Naturally, he makes it, winning the game.
As the crowd goes wild for Edward, Don Price is the only
teammate who doesn't mob him.
Edward wins a blue ribbon for his invention, a machine
labelled "Perpetual Motion." He and the JUDGE pose for a
photograph. A FLASH.
Pissed, Don Price throws his crappy lima bean plants in the
trash.
A dashingly handsome Edward leads the CAST out for a curtain
call. He's the star of the show. Off to the side, we see Don
Price is the ass-end of a horse costume.
Edward soaks in his applause, smiling and gracious.
Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of
apple pie. He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30),
who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never
left the state.
BEAMEN
Now tell me if that isn't the best
pie you ever ate.
EDWARD
It truly is.
UNDER THE TABLE
Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes.
NORTHER WINSLOW
Everything here tastes better. Even
the water is sweet. Never gets too
hot, too cold, too humid. At night
the wind goes through the trees and
you'd swear there was a whole symphony
out there, playing just for you.
Suddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward's shoes. She races for the
door.
EDWARD
Hey!
He chases after her.
Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra
and Josephine in the middle. Although Edward has a small
plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it. He's
exhausted from the trip downstairs, but determined to maintain
the family dinner ritual.
The other three eat awkwardly, each CLINK and SCRAPE of a
knife or fork resonating. Will finally breaks the silence.
WILL
I don't know if you've seen it, but
Josephine has some photos in the
most recent Newsweek.
SANDRA
Really! That's wonderful.
JOSEPHINE
I spent a week in Morocco for the
story. It was incredible.
SANDRA
We'll have to pick up a copy.
A beat. As Will scoops out another serving of potatoes, Edward
suddenly speaks:
EDWARD
I don't know if you're aware of this,
Josephine, but African parrots, in
their native home of the Congo --
they speak only French.
All three stop to listen.
JOSEPHINE
(amused)
Really.
EDWARD
You're lucky to get four words out
of them in English. But if you were
to walk through the jungle, you'd
hear them speaking the most elaborate
French. Those parrots talk about
everything: politics, movies, fashion --
everything but religion.
Taking the bait...
WILL
Why not religion, Dad?
EDWARD
It's rude to talk about religion.
You never know who you're going to
offend.
A beat.
WILL
Josephine actually went to the Congo
last year.
EDWARD
Oh, so you know.
Will shakes a shopping cart free from the pile-up while his
mother checks her list.
AT THE PRODUCE SECTION
Sandra starts to bag string beans.
WILL
Mom, would you say you understand
Dad?
SANDRA
Of course.
WILL
What I mean is, do you really know
what's going on in his head?
SANDRA
Yes.
WILL
How is that possible? I mean, you
try to ask him a question and suddenly
it's another one of his stories.
(decidedly)
You can't honestly say you know him.
SANDRA
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume
things you don't know.
She's more amused than annoyed, but Will is entering dangerous
territory.
SANDRA
Would you say you understand
Josephine?
WILL
Yes. But that's a different...
SANDRA
No it's not. It's exactly the same.
Your father and I met, we dated, and
we married -- we chose each other --
because we understood each other on
some fundamental level. Just the
same as you two.
She moves on to the carrots.
WILL
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
SANDRA
Yes, you both think William Bloom is
a very smart man.
(beat)
The problem is, you only see me as
your mother, and not as someone's
wife. And I've been his wife longer
than I've been your mother. You can't
discount that.
WILL
True. But I've known him my whole
life, and I don't feel like I know
him at all. Or ever will.
With a look, Sandra acknowledges the stakes.
SANDRA
I know it's not easy. Just remember,
he didn't choose to be your father
and you didn't choose to be his son.
You just ended up together. You could
pick numbers out of a dark bag and
it'd be just the same. If you ask
me, it's a wonder parents and children
can stand each other at all.
WILL
But I understand you, Mom. I always
have.
SANDRA
Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not
the mystery you're trying to solve
right now.
Reaching the CASHIER, Sandra hands over her coupons. Will is
approaching with a Newsweek magazine.
Two checkstands over, an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE WOMAN in her 50's
is getting her change. Though she's Sandra's generation, she
carries herself like a much younger woman, with blue jeans
and sneakers.
She accidentally makes eye contact with Will as he passes.
We HOLD ON the woman, who tracks Will as he reaches Sandra.
It's hard to read her reaction: does she recognize him, or
just find him attractive?
Will notices the gaze. The woman turns away.
Will racks his brain -- does he know this woman?
SANDRA
Before I forget, your father has
papers in the basement I'd like you
to go through. I wouldn't know what's
important.
WILL
(distracted)
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde
hair.
Sandra looks. After a beat, the Blonde Woman turns again,
semi-casually. Noticing that both Will and Sandra are looking,
she smiles a little before taking her cart to leave.
SANDRA
(no idea)
Was she one of your teachers?
WILL
No. But it's weird. She seemed to
recognize me.
SANDRA
(to the cashier)
Do you know who that is?
The Cashier turns to look. He can only get a profile as the
woman leaves.
CASHIER
Never seen her before. Pretty, though.
A portable fan quietly WHIRRS in the corner. Turned low, the
RADIO on the nightstand is playing a call-in AM sports show,
just a wash of background chatter. Edward lies asleep on his
back.
At the window, Josephine quietly lowers the shade. She reaches
over Edward to switch off the radio. He stirs from the silence --
he wasn't fully asleep -- and sees Josephine stretched over
him.
EDWARD
(playfully lecherous)
Hello.
She smiles.
JOSEPHINE
Hi. How are you feeling?
EDWARD
I was dreaming.
JOSEPHINE
What were you dreaming about?
He tries to recollect, but it's already gone. Josephine
motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed? He nods.
EDWARD
I don't usually remember unless
they're especially portentous. You
know what that word means, portentous?
She shakes her head.
EDWARD
Means when you dream about something
that's going to happen.
(beat, gathering)
Like one night, I had a dream where
this crow came and told me, "Your
Aunt is going to die." I was so scared
I woke up my parents. They told me
it was just a dream, to go back to
bed. But the next morning, my Aunt
Stacy was dead.
JOSEPHINE
That's terrible.
EDWARD
Terrible for her, but think about
me, young boy with that kind of power.
Wasn't three weeks later that the
crow came back to me in a dream and
said, "Your Grampa is going to die."
Well, I ran right back to my parents.
My father said, no, Gramps is fine,
but I could see there was trepidation.
And true enough, that next morning
my Grampa was dead.
He sits up a bit in bed, his strength returning.
EDWARD
For the next couple weeks, I didn't
have another dream. Until one night
the crow came back and said, "Your
Daddy is going to die."
(beat)
Well, I didn't know what to do. But
finally I told my father. And he
said not to worry, but I could tell
he was rattled. That next day, he
wasn't himself, always looking around,
waiting for something to drop on his
head. Because the crow didn't tell
how it was going to happen, just
those words: your Daddy is going to
die. Well, he went into town early
and was gone for a long time. And
when he finally came back, he looked
terrible, like he was waiting for
the axe to fall all day. He said to
my mother, "Good God. I just had the
worst day of my life."
(beat)
"You think you've had a bad day,"
she said. "This morning the milkman
dropped dead on the porch!" Josephine
smiles, a half-laugh, which gets him
smiling too.
A long beat. Then, deadpan...
EDWARD
Because see, my mother was banging
the milkman.
JOSEPHINE
No, I understand.
EDWARD
He was slipping her a little extra
cream.
She nods, a bit more of a laugh.
EDWARD
He was filling her basket. He was
making deliveries around back.
As Edward continues, she can't help but laugh harder,
especially as the metaphors get more vulgar.
EDWARD
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping
her churn. Splashing milk in her
box.
JOSEPHINE
Stop.
EDWARD
They were squeezing the cheese.
Clanking the bottles. Licking the
popsicle.
She's starting to cry from laughing.
EDWARD
Cracking the eggs and making an
omelet.
With that, he stops. She regains her composure.
EDWARD
Spooning the sherbet.
JOSEPHINE
(interrupting)
Can I take your picture?
EDWARD
You don't need a picture. Just look
up handsome in the dictionary.
JOSEPHINE
Please?
He rolls his eyes, why not.
Josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera.
We STAY WITH Edward in bed.
JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
I have photos from the wedding to
show you. There's a great one of you
and my father. I had an extra print
made.
Edward grimaces, a flash of pain. Around others, he's hiding
how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is.
He controls his breathing, trying to push through it.
JOSEPHINE
I want to see pictures of your
wedding. I've never seen any.
She returns with her camera. Edward smiles, doing a good job
masking the pain.
EDWARD
That's because we didn't have a
wedding. Your mother-in-law was never
supposed to marry me. She was engaged
to somebody else.
JOSEPHINE
(loading film)
I never knew.
EDWARD
Will never told you that?
(she shakes her head)
Probably just as well. He would have
told it all wrong anyway. All the
facts and none of the flavor.
JOSEPHINE
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
EDWARD
Well, it's not a short one.
A devilish smile. Pushing past Edward, we settle on the
whirling fan.
MATCH CUT TO:
SPINNING PINWHEEL
held by a LITTLE BOY. He's slumped over his FATHER's shoulder,
being carried towards a big-top tent. We are...
A troupe of STILT-WALKING FIREBREATHERS finishes their act
to tremendous APPLAUSE.
As the performers clear away, the circus' owner-and-ringmaster
AMOS CALLOWAY (50) approaches the stands. He may only be
four feet tall, but Amos has a titanic presence.
AMOS
Ladies and Gentlemen, you may think
you've seen the unusual. You may
think you've seen the bizarre. But
I've travelled to the five corners
of the world, and let me tell you,
I've never seen anything like this.
From behind Amos, CARNIES start rolling a massive ball towards
the crowd.
AMOS
When I found this man, he was picking
oranges in Florida. His fellow workers
called him El Penumbra -- The Shadow --
because when you were working beside
him, he blocked out the daylight. He
could take a whole tree in his hands
and shake off the fruit. I had to
pay his crew boss $10,000 just so I
could take him with me.
Amos comes up to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in the first row, a
quieter moment.
AMOS
Not to alarm you, Ma'am. But if this
man wanted to, he could crush your
head between his toes.
(she trembles)
But he won't.
(a long beat)
He's not going to hurt her, folks,
because he's our own Gentle Giant.
Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you
Colossus!
The carnies back away from the ball as a deep DRUM ROLL
begins. A moment, then the ball starts to bulge from inside.
A foot suddenly bursts out from within. GASPS from the crowd.
That foot is massive. In the stands, Edward looks closer.
Intrigued.
As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot breaks out.
Followed by hands. Shoulders. Finally, the head. This is
COLOSSUS.
From a very LOW ANGLE, we look up to see just how massive he
is. He seems to fill the Heavens. With his shaved head and
giant club, he seems more ogre than man.
In the bandstands, a YOUNG BOY's jaw drops in awe. Colossus
walks down the row, letting the crowd get a better look at
him. Some reach out to touch him, disbelieving. A tight
spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd.
Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed. He leans with
the spotlight, WHISTLING to get the big man's attention.
He points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is
sitting on the dirt --
KARL THE GIANT
stands up, so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold
him. He's a good foot taller than Colossus. There's a GASP
from the crowd, along with nervous anticipation -- what will
happen next?
ANGLE ON Amos, stunned, megaphone dangling.
ANGLE ON Colossus, realizing the gig is up. With a resigned
shrug, he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into
the shadows.
CUT TO:
As the stands empty, Edward and Karl talk to Amos.
AMOS
What's his name? Does he talk? It's
not important.
KARL
Karl.
AMOS
Tell me Karl, have you ever heard of
the term "involuntary servitude?"
Karl shakes his head.
AMOS
"Unconscionable contract?"
Nope.
AMOS
Great, great. That's fantastic.
EDWARD (V.O.)
It was on that night Karl met his
destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
As Amos pulls Karl aside to give him the hard sell, Edward
notices a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN (16) leaving with her family.
She's wearing a blue dress and hat. For no good reason, she
looks back at Edward.
The two make eye contact. And as they do, all motion FREEZES.
A fiery baton remains mid-twirl, flames locked in place. A
spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air, each kernel like a
snowflake. Even the elephant is mid-poop.
Only Edward is free to move, winding his way between the
frozen bodies, ducking underneath arms to get closer and
closer to this woman.
EDWARD (V.O.)
They say when you meet the love of
your life, time stops. And that's
true. What they don't tell you, is
that once time starts again, it moves
extra fast to catch up.
Suddenly, everything RUSHES. The crowd becomes a blur, and
the young woman is lost in its wake. Now it's Edward who's
frozen, helpless in time.
Amos leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back. He
spots Edward walking back into the tent.
AMOS
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself
a star.
EDWARD
That's great.
Amos hands off the contract to a CLOWN.
(INTRODUCING)
My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.
EDWARD
Good to meet you.
Mr. Soggybottom HONKS his horn, then waddles off.
AMOS
What's the matter with you, kid? I
haven't seen a customer so depressed
since the elephant sat on that
farmer's wife.
(beat)
Get it? "Depressed?"
Karl chuckles.
AMOS
See! The big guy likes it.
EDWARD
I just saw the woman I'm going to
marry, I know it. But then I lost
her.
AMOS
Tough break. Most men have to get
married before they lose their wives.
EDWARD
(with absolute
conviction)
I'm going to spend the rest of my
life looking for her. That or die
alone.
AMOS
Jesus, kid.
(realizing)
Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde
hair, blue hat?
EDWARD
Yes!
AMOS
I know her uncle. Friends of the
family.
EDWARD
Who is she? Where does she live?
AMOS
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's
out of your league.
As Amos starts to walk away, Edward hurries to catch up with
him. Karl follows as well.
EDWARD
What do you mean? You don't even
know me.
AMOS
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in
Hickville, but here in the real world,
you got squat. You don't have a plan.
You don't have a job. You don't have
anything but the clothes on your
back.
EDWARD
I've got a whole backpack full of
clothes!
He points to the bleachers, where no backpack is to be found.
EDWARD
(realizing)
Someone stole my backpack.
AMOS
Kid, you were a big fish in a small
pond. This here is the ocean, and
you're drowning. Take my advice and
go back to Puddleville. You'll be
happy there.
Getting in front of Amos, Edward stops him.
EDWARD
Wait. You said I don't have a plan.
I do. I'm going to find that girl
and marry her and spend the rest of
my life with her.
Amos smiles, amused.
EDWARD
I don't have a job, but I would have
a job if you gave me one. And I may
not have much, but I have more
determination than any man you're
ever going to meet.
AMOS
Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.
EDWARD
I'll work night and day, and you
won't have to pay me. You just have
to tell me who she is.
Amos takes a long look at him. Ultimately, there's no way he
can say no. He shrugs. What the hell.
AMOS
Every month you work for me, I'll
tell you one thing about her. That's
my final offer.
Edward shakes Amos's hand before he can retract the offer.
We move into a MONTAGE:
CLOSE ON Edward, smiling nervously. His head is tilted to
the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why: he's holding it
in a MASSIVE LION's open mouth. The beast's sharp teeth are
just poking his skin. If the lion so much as flinches, Edward
is dead.
The CROWD applauds, which makes the lion antsy. Which makes
Edward antsier.
EDWARD (V.O.)
From that moment on, I did everything
Mr. Calloway asked, and a lot of
things he didn't. I'd go three days
without stopping to eat, and four
days without sleeping.
Edward shovels shit in the nastiest stables you've ever seen.
But all he can think about is...
EDWARD
(to himself)
Daffodils!
The wonder of it. He goes back to shoveling, a smile on his
face.
EDWARD (V.O.)
True to his word, every month Amos
would tell me something new about
the woman of my dreams.
CLOSE ON Edward, lost in quiet reverie, pondering his latest
bit of information.
EDWARD
College! She's going to college!
A sudden EXPLOSION as Edward is shot...
...out of a giant cannon.
Under a full moon, Edward feeds the animals.
EDWARD
(to himself)
Music! She likes music. I like music
too!
EDWARD (V.O.)
Over the months, I learned a lot
about the woman I was going to marry,
but not her name, and not where to
find her.
That time had come. I couldn't wait any longer.
Amos Calloway stands up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy.
He still has the stick in his mouth, which he takes out as
Edward approaches.
AMOS
Didn't kill anything, did I?
EDWARD
A few rabbits, but I think one of
them was already dead.
AMOS
That would explain the indigestion.
Edward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates.
AMOS
I was wrong about you kid. You may
not have much, but what you got, you
got a lot of. You could get any girl.
EDWARD
There's only one I want.
A beat.
AMOS
Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's
going to Auburn. The semester's almost
over, so you better hurry.
EDWARD
Thank you.
AMOS
Good luck, kid.
Edward walks away. Then starts running. He has to get there
as soon as possible.
Amos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot.
Edward is dumbstruck. With all the strength he can muster...
EDWARD
Well. Congratulations. I'm sorry to
have bothered you.
He turns and walks down the front steps.
She stays in the doorway for a few beats, feeling genuinely
horrible for what's happened. But eventually she goes back
inside. We hear GIGGLES from inside as her sorority sisters
get to the bottom of this.
SANDRA
Stop it. It's not funny. That poor
boy.
We LEAD Edward as he walks away, tears just starting to form.
EDWARD (V.O.)
Fate has a cruel way of circling
around on you. After all this work
to leave Ashton, the girl I loved
was now engaged to one of its biggest
jerks.
He EXITS FRAME, leaving only the sorority house in the
background.
EDWARD (V.O.)
There's a time when a man needs to
fight, and a time when he needs to
accept that his destiny is lost,
that the ship has sailed, and that
only a fool would continue.
A beat. Edward steps back INTO FRAME, looking at the sorority
house.
EDWARD (V.O.)
The truth is, I've always been a
fool.
We CIRCLE as he shouts:
EDWARD
Sandra Templeton! I love you! And I
am going to marry you!
Sandra and her SISTERS peer out through the curtains. Is
this guy crazy?
The tweedy ECONOMICS PROFESSOR continues his explanation.
Sandra isn't paying a lot of attention.
He switches on the overhead projector without looking at it.
There's a TITTER from the STUDENTS, but he doesn't notice.
A classmate nudges Sandra, who looks up. Written on the
projector is "I Love Sandra Templeton." She's horrified and
excited at the same time. The professor finally notices what's
written there.
At her Sisters' prompting, a just-woken Sandra looks out the
second-story window to find the lawn filled with
TEN THOUSAND DAFFODILS.
Edward stands amid the sea of flowers. He's waited there six
hours.
Sitting on the can, Don Price pinches a loaf while reading
the new Playboy.
EDWARD (V.O.)
All the physical activity had worsened
a congenital valve defect. Put simply,
his heart wasn't strong enough.
Don Price squeezes down hard, trying to shit the unshittable.
Suddenly, he grasps his chest and collapses face-first on
the tile.
MATCH CUT TO:
JOSEPHINE
I thought you said you didn't have a
church wedding.
EDWARD
Well, we were all set to, but there
was a complication.
He reaches for his glass of water, but Josephine already has
it for him. She watches him while he slowly drinks the entire
glass, thirstier than he imagined. While he's drinking, we...
CUT TO:
Will, back from the grocery store, reaches the top of the
stairs. He hears voices coming from the bedroom.
JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
Is it the medicine that's making you
thirsty?
EDWARD (O.S.)
Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole
life. Never really known why.
Will quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but
not exactly announcing his presence. The door is open a few
inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife.
INTERCUT HALLWAY / BEDROOM
EDWARD
There was one time when I was
eleven...
JOSEPHINE
(gently)
You were talking about your wedding.
EDWARD
I didn't forget. I was just working
on a tangent. See, most men, they'll
tell a story straight through, and
it won't be complicated, but it won't
be interesting either.
JOSEPHINE
I like your stories.
EDWARD
And I like you.
He doesn't let the moment linger with undue sentimentality.
There's a story to be told.
EDWARD
Now. The thing about working for a
circus is you don't have a regular
address, and after three years I had
a lot of undelivered mail.
In the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself
listen to the story one more time.
EDWARD
During the four weeks I was in the
hospital, the postmaster finally
caught up with me.
Bruised and bandaged, Edward sorts through a big bag of mail
with help from Sandra. He rips open an official-looking
letter. Reading it, his face drops.
FLUTE and DRUM, music rising to a military cadence.
EDWARD (V.O.)
It turned out that while my heart
belonged to Sandra, the rest of my
body belonged to the U.S. Government.
With a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a
dozen other SOLDIERS. The noise of the ENGINES is deafening,
but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook.
EDWARD (V.O.)
A hitch in the Army was up to three
years at that point, and having waited
three years just to meet Sandra, I
knew I couldn't survive being away
from her that long. So I took every
hazardous assignment I could find,
with the hope of getting my time
down to less than a year.
The JUMP LEADER yells...
JUMP LEADER
GO! GO! GO!
One by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main
line. When his time comes, Edward leaps...
...but he's stuck. His cord is caught up in the assembly.
He twists and struggles, trying to free himself. Looking
down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the
darkness. They're already long gone.
Digging a knife out of his pocket, Edward gets to work cutting
through the cable. It finally POPS. Edward jumps from the
plane.
As ARMED GUARDS search the halls below the stage, Ping and
Jing shut the door to their dressing room. At the closet,
they start to change outfits. Off-stage, their personalities
become quite apparent: Ping is brash, bitchy and ambitious,
while Jing is quiet, sweet and bookish.
In Chinese, subtitled...
PING
How could you miss your cue? You
make me look like a fool, out there
alone.
JING
You weren't alone.
Ping HUFFS, turning her back on her sister.
Jing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress,
exposing Edward's hiding place. She GASPS. Ping turns to
look.
PING
Who the hell are you?
EDWARD
(in Chinese)
I'm not going to hurt you.
PING
Damn right you're not.
(yelling)
GUARD!
Jing grabs her, a hand over her mouth, but it's too late. A
rifle-toting GUARD looks in.
Pretending to be her bitchy sister --
JING
Tell your men not to bother us! And
lock that door!
The guard obeys. Ping shakes her sister off. Desperately
flipping through his Asian phrasebook, he finds...
EDWARD
Please, I need your help.
PING
What makes you think we'll help you?
Edward pulls a photo out of his flak jacket. It's Sandra.
CROSSFADE TO:
VARIOUS SHOTS
EDWARD (V.O.)
Over the next hour, I described my
love for Sandra Kay Templeton, and
the ordeal that brought me before
them. As it had always been, this
love was my salvation. It was destined
to be.
Hearing the story, Jing wipes away a tear. Even Ping is a
little affected.
EDWARD (V.O.)
We put together an elaborate plan
for escape, involving a whaling ship
to Russia, a barge to Cuba and a
small, dirty canoe to Miami. We all
knew it would be dangerous.
Still subtitled:
PING
And what are we supposed to do when
we get to America?
EDWARD
I can get you bookings. I know the
biggest man in show business.
JING
Bob Hope?
EDWARD
Bigger.
TRANSITION TO:
...where the couple stays cocooned under the sheets, a kind
of limbo. A kiss good morning. Legs entangling. Neither wants
to get up.
JOSEPHINE
I talked with your father last night.
WILL
Did you?
A look to say, should I be worried?
JOSEPHINE
You never told me how your parents
met.
WILL
They met at Auburn.
JOSEPHINE
What about the details? How they
fell in love. The Circus. The War.
You never told me any of that.
WILL
That's because most of it never
happened.
JOSEPHINE
But it's romantic.
A beat.
WILL
(non-committal)
Mmm.
JOSEPHINE
Mmm, what?
WILL
Mmm, what. I know better than to
argue romance with a French woman.
He moves his head out from under the sheet. She follows him
to the "outside."
JOSEPHINE
Do you love your father?
WILL
Everyone loves my father. He's a
very likeable guy.
JOSEPHINE
(repeating)
Do you love him?
Will doesn't want to answer yes or no.
WILL
You have to understand. When I was
growing up, he was gone more than he
was here. And I started thinking --
maybe he has a second life somewhere
else. With another house, another
family. He leaves us, he goes to
them. Or maybe there is no family.
Maybe he never wanted a family. But
whatever it is, maybe he likes that
second life better. And the reason
he tells all those stories is because
he can't stand this boring place.
JOSEPHINE
But it's not true.
WILL
What is "true?" I've never heard my
father say a single true thing.
Off her silence...
WILL
Look, I know why you like him. I
know why everyone likes him. But I
need you to tell me I'm not crazy.
JOSEPHINE
You're not.
WILL
I need you on my side.
JOSEPHINE
I am always on your side. And I think
you should talk to him.
The family finishes eating breakfast off TV trays set up
around the bed. For his part, Edward is looking better.
Certainly not recovered, but there's an optimism to his
expression. And for the first time, he's actually hungry.
He watches as Sandra puts the cap back on the syrup.
EDWARD
Did I ever tell you about how...
WILL
(interrupting)
Yes.
Edward is startled.
WILL
The maple tree and the Buick. We
heard it.
EDWARD
(re: Josephine)
I think someone hasn't.
JOSEPHINE
The tree fell on the car, spilling
the syrup, which attracted the flies,
which got stuck to it and flew off
with the whole car.
A beat.
EDWARD
(undeterred)
But the real story is how I got the
car. You see...
WILL
(interrupting)
Dad?
EDWARD
Son?
WILL
Can we talk?
Sandra SNAPS the cap back on the syrup.
SANDRA
I'm going to get started on dishes.
JOSEPHINE
I'll help you.
Both women quickly gather plates.
Will and Edward both smile. The women clearly want this to
happen. It settles for a beat after they leave.
WILL
Do you know much about icebergs,
Dad?
EDWARD
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They
were hauling it down to Texas for
drinking water, only they didn't
count on an elephant being frozen
inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
WILL
(interrupting)
Dad!
EDWARD
What?
WILL
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
EDWARD
Then you shouldn't have started with
a question. Because people want to
answer questions. You should have
started with, "The thing about
icebergs is..."
WILL
(frustrated)
The thing about icebergs is you only
see 10 percent of them. The other 90
percent is below the water where you
can't see it. And that's what it is
with you Dad. I'm only seeing this
little bit that sticks above the
water.
EDWARD
(joking)
What, you're seeing down to my nose?
My chin?
WILL
I have no idea who you are because
you have never told me a single fact.
EDWARD
I've told you a thousand facts. That's
all I do, Will. I tell stories.
WILL
You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing
lies. Stories are what you tell a
five-year old at bedtime. They're
not elaborate mythologies you maintain
when your son is ten and fifteen and
twenty and thirty. And the thing is,
I believed you. I believed your
stories so much longer than I should
have. And then when I realized that
everything you said was impossible --
everything! -- I felt like such a
fool to have trusted you. You were
like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny
combined. Just as charming and just
as fake.
EDWARD
You think I'm fake.
WILL
Only on the surface. But that's all
I've ever seen.
Edward looks away, angry and disbelieving.
WILL
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my
own here. It would kill me if he
went through his whole life never
understanding me.
EDWARD
It would kill you, huh?
Finally --
EDWARD
What do you want, Will? Who do you
want me to be?
WILL
Yourself. Good, bad, everything.
Just show me who you are for once.
EDWARD
I have been nothing but myself since
the day I was born. And if you can't
see that, it's your failing, not
mine.
The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring
into the mouth of oblivion. The storeroom is a museum of
hasty decisions and half-finished projects: partially built
outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian
lawnmowers. We also find boxes of products Edward used to
sell.
Clearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its
ribs covered in dust. Two beaten metal file cabinets sit
beside it.
SANDRA
Your father decided he needed to
have an office, and it wouldn't do
to have it in the house. You'll know
better than me what's important.
With some effort, Will forces up the desktop. With a HISS, a
neighbor's cat makes a run for it. Will's getting used to
being startled.
Will, Sandra and Josephine have worked through two trash
bags of papers to throw out. Looking through a new file,
Sandra makes a small sound. A memory.
WILL
What is it?
Sandra hands Will a yellowed telegram. He shares it with
Josephine.
SANDRA
It was during the war. Your father
went missing. They thought he was
dead.
Will can't believe what he's reading.
WILL
That really happened?
SANDRA
Not everything your father says is a
complete fabrication.
A beat, then Sandra stands.
SANDRA
I'm going to check on him.
JOSEPHINE
I need to lie down for a bit.
WILL
Go.
Josephine kisses him, then follows Sandra. Will re-reads the
telegram, still bewildered.
Looking for a place to put it, he tucks it into a strange
mechanical hand on the desk. It clamps down automatically.
Will smiles, a memory. He hasn't thought about this device
in years. We slowly PUSH IN on the telegram, held in the
hand.
Edward's VOICE begins as a memory...
EDWARD (V.O.)
After the war, the sons of Alabama
returned home, looking for work.
Each had an advantage over me. They
were alive, while I was -- officially --
deceased.
Edward shakes hands with his new boss, a TOUPEED MAN. The
company is called "Confederated Products." The OFFICE LADIES
all love Edward.
EDWARD (V.O.)
With my prospects few, I took a job
as a travelling salesman. It suited
me. If there's one thing you can say
about Edward Bloom, it's that I am a
social person.
The bank is busy with the lunch-hour crowd. Taking his place
in line, Edward fills out a deposit slip.
As the line snakes around through the ropes, the man in front
of him gets a look at Edward.
THE MAN
Edward? Edward Bloom?
The man is none other than...
NORTHER WINSLOW
It's me. Norther Winslow.
EDWARD (V.O.)
I was astonished to see the greatest
poet of both Ashton and Spectre all
the way out in Texas.
The men shake, disbelieving this lucky coincidence.
EDWARD
I don't believe it!
NORTHER WINSLOW
I want you to know, when you left
Spectre it opened my eyes. There was
a whole life out there that I was
not living. So I travelled. I saw
France, and Africa, half of South
America. Every day a new adventure,
that's my motto.
EDWARD
That's great, Norther. I'm happy for
you. I can't believe I helped.
He's genuinely proud.
EDWARD
So what are you up to now?
NORTHER WINSLOW
I'm robbing this place.
Reaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols
out of his coat, FIRING both into the ceiling.
SCREAMS all around. The skinny SECURITY GUARD makes a
halfhearted reach for his gun, but Norther waves him off.
The guard takes out his gun and slides it over.
NORTHER WINSLOW
(to Edward)
Would you mind grabbing that?
There's nothing threatening about his delivery -- he might
as well be asking for a Budweiser. Still, Edward senses it
would be best to do as he says. He takes the guard's gun.
NORTHER WINSLOW
(to the crowd)
Now, I want all of you to lie down.
I'm gonna be cleaning out the cash
drawers, and my associate here is
going to handle the vault.
(pointing to a Teller
Woman)
You help my friend, okay?
The TELLER WOMAN nods.
ANGLE ON Edward, not sure what to do. He has a gun, but he
truly doesn't want to shoot Norther. The Teller Woman is
already waving him to the back.
He decides he better go.
The Teller Woman is crying as she works the combination.
Edward feels horrible.
EDWARD
Look, I'm really sorry. I just don't
want anybody to get hurt.
TELLER WOMAN
It's not that, it's just...
She pulls open the vault door.
The inner sanctum of the Horizon Savings and Loan holds
exactly one folding chair. Nothing else.
TELLER WOMAN
...there's no money. We're completely
bankrupt.
EDWARD (V.O.)
It turned out the savings and loan
had already been robbed -- not by
armed bandits, but by speculators in
Texas real estate.
TELLER WOMAN
(dead serious)
You gotta promise you won't tell
anybody.
CUT TO:
Edward drives the getaway car, though truthfully they're
going just a little over the speed limit. No one's following
them. It's an empty country road for miles.
Norther HOLLERS with body-tingling joy as he counts the money.
NORTHER WINSLOW
Sixty. Eighty. Four hundred dollars!
Not bad for just the drawers. Let's
see what you got from the vault.
Edward winces, but doesn't say anything yet. Digging through
the vault bag, Norther is surprised to find only a single
deposit envelope. He rips it open, revealing just a little
cash inside. Even some dimes and pennies.
NORTHER WINSLOW
This is it? The whole vault.
EDWARD
'Fraid so.
NORTHER WINSLOW
Edward, it's got your deposit slip
on it.
Caught, Edward has to confess...
EDWARD
Look, I just didn't want you to go
empty-handed. There's something you
should know, Norther. You see, the
reason why...
Edward continues his narration...
EDWARD (V.O.)
I told Norther about the vagaries of
Texas oil money and its effect on
real estate prices, and how lax
enforcement of fiduciary process had
made savings and loans particularly
vulnerable.
Hearing this news, Norther was left with one conclusion:
CLOSE ON Edward's hand as he turns knobs.
CLOSE ON water SPLASHING into the claw-foot bathtub, which
begins to fill.
Still wearing his pajamas, Edward climbs into the tub.
Carefully lowers himself.
As the water reaches the third button up on his pajama shirt,
Edward suddenly slides
UNDERWATER.
Bubbles rise from his nose for a few beats, then stop. It's
quiet, except for the distant SPLASHING of water from the
spigot. Edward's eyes are closed.
A long beat. Another. Then the SPLASHING water goes silent.
Edward opens one eye. The other eye. He sits up to find
SANDRA
sitting on the edge of the tub. She doesn't seem particularly
worried -- her husband has always done this.
EDWARD
I was drying out.
SANDRA
I see. We need to get you one of
those plant misters. We can spray
you like a fern.
He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in
the tub. A beat while she considers.
Sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub,
facing him. Her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind.
He leans forward and kisses her. When they separate, she has
tears hanging in her eyes.
EDWARD
Come now.
He wipes them away.
SANDRA
I don't think I'll ever dry out.
Perched awkwardly on a canoe, Will's made it through another
file cabinet. He goes through the folders page by page, but
usually ends up tossing the whole thing in the trash.
He's about to toss a file when he stops. Takes another look.
Something doesn't make sense.
Will is headed upstairs when his mother comes around the
corner with an armful of laundry, including her wet dress.
WILL
Is he awake?
SANDRA
He just fell asleep. Josephine's
with him.
She passes him. He turns.
WILL
Mom?
SANDRA
Yes?
Will quickly debates whether or not to ask her...
WILL
Did you and Dad have any other
property?
SANDRA
(thinking)
I suppose your grandmother's house
when she passed on. But we sold that
right away. Your cousin Shirley bought
it.
WILL
So you never bought any land.
SANDRA
Heavens no. We had a hard enough
time keeping the mortgage on this
place.
Will nods, just curious. He continues heading up.
Will changes his shirt. Takes his keys off the nightstand.
Will checks the address on one of his father's files.
While Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she
never expected to see again. She hands it back to Will.
WILL
How did you know my father?
JENNY
This was on his sales route, so he
was through here all the time.
Everyone in town knew him.
A beat. Not flinching...
WILL
Were you and my father having an
affair?
JENNY
(taken aback)
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was
expecting to dance around this for
another half hour.
WILL
I've seen him with women. He flirts.
He always has. On some level, I
presumed he was cheating on my mother.
I just never had proof.
She moves, trying to get out of the corner he's boxed her
into. Once she's finally free...
JENNY
Can I ask you a question? Why did
you come here today? If you found
this deed, why didn't you just ask
Eddie?
WILL
Because he's dying.
A long beat. Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it.
She's a tangle of conflicting emotions.
JENNY
Look, I don't know how much you want
to know about any of this. You have
one image of your father and it would
be wrong for me to go and change it.
Especially this late in the game.
WILL
My father talked about a lot of things
he never did, and I'm sure he did a
lot of things he never talked about.
I'm just trying to reconcile the
two.
Fair enough. Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.
JENNY
The first thing you have to
understand, is that your father never
meant to end up here. And yet he
did, twice. The first time, he was
early. The second time, he was late.
It's late, and Edward is pensive.
JENNY (V.O.)
Those days, your father was working
for himself. If there was one thing
you could say about Edward Bloom,
it's that he was a social person,
and people took a liking to him. One
night he was returning from three
weeks on the road, when he hit a
thunderstorm unlike any in his life.
The first raindrops hit the windshield. Edward turns on the
wipers.
Suddenly, a deluge descends. It's not even rain anymore --
there's no space between the drops. It's like being caught
in a waterfall. It's that loud.
No choice, Edward stops the car. Puts on the handbrake. Just
as suddenly, the sound changes -- no longer pounding, but
softly SPLASHING. The world is close and echoing, because --
Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm. Water is
trickling in through the crack between the window and the
door, but very slowly. For now, he's fine.
That's when he sees her -- The Girl in the River.
She's swimming outside the car. While we never see her face
exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious,
as the first time we saw her.
She puts her hand to the windshield. He puts his up to meet
hers. And smiles.
FLASH CUT TO:
Edward pitches his plan to Norther.
JENNY (V.O.)
He was never a wealthy man, but he
had made other men rich, and now he
asked for their favors.
VARIOUS SHOTS: Expressive and passionate as always, Edward
talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway.
JENNY (V.O.)
Most of them had never seen Spectre --
they only had Edward's words to
describe it. That's all they needed.
He sold them on the dream.
JING
You can structure it as a historical
trust. But you'll need every
contiguous piece of property. It's
all or nothing.
As Edward takes notes...
JENNY (V.O.)
So first he bought the farms. Then
he bought the houses. Then he bought
the stores.
Finishing up with AL, Edward shakes hands.
JENNY (V.O.)
Whatever he bought, the people were
not asked to leave or pay rent or
anything. They were just asked to
keep doing as they were doing. In
that way, he could make sure the
town would never die.
The inside is nicer than you'd think, a real home. A fire
burns in the stove, and curtains hang in the windows.
With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano.
Edward doesn't recognize her as the little girl who used to
have a crush on him. Without turning, she says...
JENNY
You must be Edward Bloom.
EDWARD
How did you know?
She keeps PLAYING.
JENNY
No one would come out here unless
they had business. And no one would
have business with me except for
you. You're buying the town.
EDWARD
Apparently I've overlooked this one
piece of it, and I'd like to remedy
that. You see, in order for the town
to be preserved, the trust must own
it in its entirety.
JENNY
So I've heard.
EDWARD
I'll offer you more than it's worth.
And you know you won't have to move.
Nothing will change except the name
on the deed, you have my word.
Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished. She turns
to face him. Edward still doesn't recognize her.
JENNY
Now let me get this straight. You'll
buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay
in it. You'll own the house, but
it'll still be mine. I'll be here,
and you'll come and go as you please
to one place or another. Do I have
that right?
Strange to hear it put that way, but --
EDWARD
In so many words, yes.
JENNY
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If
nothing is going to change, I'd just
as soon it not change in the way it
hasn't been changing all this time.
EDWARD
It's not like you're going to lose
anything. You can ask anyone in town.
I've been nothing if not generous. I
want the best for everyone.
A long beat.
JENNY
Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this
land? Some sort of midlife crisis?
Instead of buying a convertible, you
buy a town?
He looks at her, puzzled and surprised. No one has really
asked before.
EDWARD
Helping people makes me happy.
JENNY
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
EDWARD
I'm sorry. Have I offended you?
She finally turns to face him.
JENNY
No, you did exactly what you promised.
You came back. I was just expecting
you sooner.
FLASHBACK TO:
Finally realizing who this woman is...
EDWARD
You're Beamen's daughter. Your last
name is different.
(realizing)
You married.
JENNY
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that
was a big difference.
Before he can say anything more...
JENNY
I won't be selling you this house,
Mr. Bloom.
EDWARD
I see. I thank you for your time.
A bit bewildered, Edward tips his hat to her as he leaves.
Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it
breaks off in his hands. It's not the clean exit he was hoping
for.
Inside Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed.
Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they
SNAP off. The door frame buckles and the whole shack CREAKS.
EDWARD
I'm sorry.
He tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps
slipping.
JENNY
It's okay, just leave it.
EDWARD
I can get it. I can just...
He leans the door a different way. It holds for a beat then
falls in, SMASHING a small table.
EDWARD
Lord, I'm sorry I...
JENNY
Please. Go. Just go.
EDWARD
I'll...
JENNY
Go.
She's dead serious. Weighing the scales of chivalry, he
finally backs away. Turns and heads back towards his car.
We STAY ON Jenny, watching him go. She's furious, but there's
something more in her feelings for him. Something softer.
JENNY (V.O.)
Most men in that situation would
accept their failure and move on.
But Edward was not like most men.
Holding nails between his lips, Edward puts in new windows
himself. Jenny is making soup, laughing at the story he's
telling.
JENNY (V.O.)
As the months passed, he found more
and more things to fix, until the
shack no longer resembled itself.
Edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer.
Jenny leans against the doorframe listening to his story.
And watching him with deepest affection.
EDWARD
Of course, the best part was creating
new material. By the time the twins
and I got to Havana, we had a whole
new routine worked out for them,
with just a ukulele and a harmonica.
Finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and
hangs it on the rack. Perfect.
A beat. A look between them. With that last job done, there's
no reason for him to be staying any longer.
EDWARD
I suppose I should...
He takes his hat off the rack.
JENNY
You can leave it there.
A beat. Does she really mean it?
She comes closer. Edward holds his ground. She takes his
hand, lifting his hat up to the peg. She's very close --
just a half-inch from kissing him when --
-- Edward gently holds her back.
EDWARD
No.
She freezes, stunned and humiliated. She pulls away.
EDWARD
Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should
never have let you think that...
(beat)
I am in love with my wife.
JENNY
I know.
EDWARD
And from the moment I saw her until
the moment I die, she's the only
one.
JENNY
Lucky girl.
EDWARD
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
With that, he begins to leaves.
JENNY
Wait! Edward!
She finds a pen and hastily signs the deed to the house.
Hands it to him. With a look, he thanks her. Then goes.
Will and Jenny are still sitting at her table, a pitcher of
iced tea between them.
WILL
Logically, you couldn't be the Witch,
because she was old back when he was
young.
JENNY
No, it's logical if you think like
your father. See, to him, there's
only two women: your mother and
everyone else.
WILL
You didn't become crazy.
JENNY
Well, therapy. And one day I realized
I was in love with a man who could
never love me back. I was living in
a fairy tale.
Will smiles to hear it called that.
JENNY
People aren't like they are in
stories. They hurt each other without
meaning to. They are kind and
unbelievably cruel at the same moment.
Like me, now. I'm not sure I should
have told you any of this.
Her composure is starting to break.
WILL
No, I wanted to know. I'm glad I
know.
A long beat, both staring at their iced tea. Jenny is working
herself into more of a state by not talking.
JENNY
I wanted to meet you for the longest
time. I did.
(a smile)
I envied you so much. The way Eddie
would talk about you when you were
at Missouri, that award you won.
Congratulations, incidentally. And
when you got the job at the A.P.,
everything, he was so proud of you.
I mean, that's the thing. Every moment
he loved you.
She's fighting tears, not the first ones she's shed over
this.
JENNY
And as brightly as the sun would
shine when he was with me, every
time he left it disappeared. I wanted
to be as important to him as you
were, and I was never going to be. I
was make-believe and his other life,
you, were real.
ANGLE ON Will, sorting through his swirling thoughts.
JENNY
You knew that, didn't you?
CUT TO:
Will skips through the stations on the radio, but ultimately
turns it off. He's trying to think.
It's half-dark and quiet in the house, no talking, no TV.
Will sets his keys on the table.
Will looks in. Empty.
WILL
(calling out)
Hello? Mom? Dad?
We follow Will, looking into his and Josephine's room. He
aims for the guest room at the end of the hall.
Looking over his shoulder, we see his father's bed is empty.
The sheets are in a tangle on the floor.
A beat, then Will half-runs back down the hall. Back down
the stairs.
Headed out, Will grabs his keys off the table. We LOOK RIGHT,
where the "MESSAGE" light blinks on the answering machine.
The hospital is so new, it's not even finished -- thick
plastic hangs from exposed framing. There's no one at the
information desk, so Will forges ahead.
Will reads a directory board, trying to decide the best place
to start. Then, behind him --
JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
Will!
He turns to see his wife at a payphone. She hangs up. She
was calling him.
WILL
What happened?
JOSEPHINE
Your father had a stroke. He's
upstairs with your mom and Dr.
Bennett.
WILL
Is he going to be okay?
A beat. How can she answer?
He half-smiles, realizing the idiocy of his question. Of
course his father's not going to be okay.
WILL
What I mean is, will he get back to
the way he was when...
She cuts him off --
JOSEPHINE
No. He won't. I'm sorry.
And like that, it's done. We HOLD ON Will, reeling from the
news.
Edward sleeps peacefully, just an oxygen tube under his nose.
There are no beeping monitors, no blinking lights. It's
mercifully quiet.
Sandra squeezes Will's hand tightly. She's holding herself
together, but it's been a tough day.
Dr. Bennett has just gone through the details for the third
time.
SANDRA
I don't suppose one of us could stay
with him. In case he...
(beat)
In case he wakes up, one of us should
be there.
WILL
I'll stay. Why don't you go home
with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
SANDRA
(to Dr. Bennett)
That's okay?
DR. BENNETT
It's fine.
SANDRA
(to Will)
You'll call if...
WILL
I will. I'll call.
A beat.
WILL
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
SANDRA
Yes. Thank you.
A nod, then Will holds the door for Dr. Bennett and Josephine
as they leave. Sandra is alone in the room with her husband.
She neatens his hair. Holds his hand. As she kisses his
fingers, she tweaks her chin with them -- his signature move.
TRANSITION TO:
Sandra waits outside the women's restroom. Her face is a
study in strained composure -- acknowledging the inevitable
but refusing to surrender to it.
Josephine emerges.
JOSEPHINE
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I
have to...
SANDRA
I know. It was the same when I was
carrying Will. Like clockwork.
The two women start to walk, no hurry.
SANDRA
Do you like it, being pregnant?
JOSEPHINE
I do.
SANDRA
I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but
I loved every minute of it. I did.
Eddie was travelling a lot, so he
was gone, but I felt like I always
had a piece of him with me. A little
part of his soul inside me. I could
feel it. It was alive and kicking.
Sandra has accidentally evoked a storm of emotion. She
struggles to keep it in check. Almost a whisper...
SANDRA
I really miss that.
With a few breaths, Sandra tries to hold on. Hold back.
JOSEPHINE
Don't stop. Don't.
A beat, then Sandra finally melts. Josephine holds her. The
two women stand together in the hallway, letting the moment
be.
Will sits in a chair beside the bed, working through the
crossword puzzle. A KNOCK as Dr. Bennett enters with his
overcoat and bag, ready to leave for the night.
DR. BENNETT
Glad to see you're not trying to
have a heartfelt talk. It's one of
my greatest annoyances, when people
talk to those who can't hear them.
WILL
My father and I have an advantage.
We never talk.
Dr. Bennett smiles as he checks Edward's chart.
WILL
How long have you known my father?
DR. BENNETT
Thirty years. Maybe more.
WILL
How would you describe him?
DR. BENNETT
(re: chart)
Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated
hypertension.
(beat)
How would his son describe him?
Tables turned, Will searches for an answer. He doesn't have
one.
Dr. Bennett hangs the chart back on the bed.
DR. BENNETT
Did your father ever tell you about
the day you were born?
WILL
A thousand times. He caught an
uncatchable fish.
DR. BENNETT
Not that one. The real story. Did he
ever tell you that?
WILL
(suddenly interested)
No.
DR. BENNETT
Your mother came in about three in
the afternoon. Her neighbor drove
her, on account of your father was
on business in Wichita. You were
born a week early, but there were no
complications. It was a perfect
delivery. Now, your father was sorry
to miss it, but it wasn't the custom
for the men to be in the room for
deliveries then, so I can't see as
it would have been much different
had he been there. And that's the
real story of how you were born.
A long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors
being paged.
DR. BENNETT
Not very exciting, is it? And I
suppose if I had to choose between
the true version and an elaborate
one involving a fish and a wedding
ring, I might choose the fancy
version. But that's just me.
Will half-smiles.
Patting Will's shoulder, Dr. Bennett leaves. We STAY ON Will
and his father for a long time, then Will takes his pen and
starts making a list.
Will flips to a new page. The list keeps getting longer.
He smiles, remembering something. On his fourth page, he
looks up at his motionless father. A beat, then we slowly
CROSSFADE TO:
It's very early morning, and the first blue light of day is
glowing through the vertical blinds. Still in his chair,
Will wakes up a bit at a time. The notepad is on his lap,
the pen in his hand.
He cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong. What
woke him up?
He looks to his right. Holds his gaze for a breath.
WILL
Dad?
His father is awake, silently GASPING for breath. His eyes
are open, scared and confused.
WILL
Dad! Do you want me to get a nurse?
Edward shakes his head unambiguously. Will already has his
finger on the orange "nurse call" button, but doesn't push
it.
WILL
What can I do? Can I help? Can I get
you something? Water?
Edward nods. Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the
nightstand. He holds it to his father's lips, but Edward
won't drink. He pushes it away. He wanted something else.
EDWARD
(whispering)
The river.
WILL
The river?
It takes Edward all his strength to put together each thought.
It's like he's only half-there, fighting to hang on to this
world.
EDWARD
Tell me how it happens.
WILL
How what happens?
EDWARD
How I go.
ON WILL, realizing...
WILL
You mean what you saw in The Eye?
Edward nods. Yes, that's what he was trying to say.
A long beat.
WILL
I don't know that story, Dad. You
never told me that one.
Will pushes his fingers under his father's heavy hand, and
holds it. There's nothing else to do.
Edward looks around, confused and increasingly scared. He
sees the end approaching, but doesn't know exactly what's
coming. Without the story, he's lost.
Fighting the urge to panic --
WILL
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just
tell me how it starts.
EDWARD
Like this.
WILL
Okay. Okay.
Will looks around the room, increasingly desperate. He looks
to the nurse call button. He really wants to press it.
ON EDWARD, waiting for Will to begin.
WILL
Okay. It's morning, and you and I
are in the hospital. I'd fallen asleep
in the chair. I wake up and I see
you, and...
CUT TO:
WILL
Dad?
It's dawn, and the first golden glow is shining through the
vertical blinds.
WILL
(louder and concerned)
Dad?
We LOOK OVER to find a nimble Edward sitting up in bed,
combing his hair.
EDWARD
Let's get out of here.
WILL (V.O.)
Somehow, you're better. Different.
You're getting ready to go. And I
say...
WILL
Dad, you're in no condition to...
But Edward throws back the covers.
EDWARD
There's a fold-up wheelchair in the
bathroom. Wrap a blanket around me.
As soon as we get off this floor,
we'll be in the clear.
Will heads for the bathroom. Sure enough, the wheelchair is
there.
EDWARD
Hurry! We don't have much time.
With the blanket draped over his head like a ghost, Edward
points for his son to steer the wheelchair thataway.
EDWARD
Faster!
They pass a HEAVYSET NURSE, who turns to look.
Rounding a corner, they nearly crash into Dr. Bennett.
DR. BENNETT
Will! I... What are you doing?
Before he can answer, Will spots Edward rolling the chair
himself, pumping both arms. Will dashes to catch up with
him.
The Heavyset Nurse leans out of Edward's hospital room.
NURSE
Security! Stop them!
DOWN THE HALL
At the elevators, Sandra and Josephine step out to find Will
and Edward barreling straight at them.
EDWARD
No time to explain! Follow us!
Seeing SECURITY GUARDS heading their way, a quick-thinking
Sandra shoves a nearby cart into them, bowling them down.
Will brakes hard, sliding with both feet. The chair nearly
crashes into the back wall as the doors close.
TIGHT ON Will, trying to hold back tears as he talks.
WILL
And we have to take Glenville to
avoid all the church traffic, because
those damn church people drive too
slow.
TIGHT ON Edward, enjoying that detail. He's focused completely
on Will's story.
WILL
I ask...
BACK TO:
EDWARD
The River!
Will stops short, the traffic backed up. He HONKS, trying to
get around the jam. But it's no use.
Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive
hands. It's Karl the Giant, clearing a path by brute force.
Edward leans out the window and waves. Karl waves back.
Amazed, Will turns to his father.
WILL
It's unbelievable.
EDWARD
Story of my life.
Will has tears hanging in the corners of his eyes.
WILL
You become what you always were. A
very big fish.
(he smiles)
And that's the way it happens.
EDWARD
(a whisper)
Yes. Exactly.
Edward smiles, proud of both of them. His eyes are so pale
and so open, we can almost see his soul. In every atom of
his body, in every thought, Edward Bloom is entirely happy.
And this is how he goes.
Will shuts the door to his father's room behind him. The
walk to the payphones seems to take a lifetime.
He finds a quarter, starts to dial. He has to squint to see
through the water in his eyes. It's ringing. And ringing.
The other end answers.
WILL
(voice cracking)
Hi.
That's all he can get out before the dam breaks inside him.
He presses closer to the phone, trying to shield himself.
MUSIC begins that will carry us through the next passage.
Will waits at reception as Sandra and Josephine come off the
elevator.
Josephine opens the curtains, letting white sunlight in. She
strips the bed.
Will and his mother pick out one of Edward's ties, for Will
to wear at the funeral. Will tries to button the cuffs on
the shirt he borrowed, but they're the kind that need links.
He goes through the top drawer of the dresser, trying to
find a matching pair. Further down, he finds a ribbon tied
to
THE KEY TO THE CITY.
He smiles, disbelieving. It's a real thing.
