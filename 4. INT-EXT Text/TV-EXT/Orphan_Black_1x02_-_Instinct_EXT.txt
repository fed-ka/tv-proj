      CLOSE ON:  SARAH'S EYES, wide, terrified. Her breath rasps
      in her head, drowning out all other sound but a ringing phone.

      She stands in stasis outside the Audi where it skidded to a
      halt. The phone is in her hand, ringing, ringing ...

      Sarah slowly looks in the back seat ...

      The dead German lies there, eyes staring, exit wound oozing.

      Sarah can't make sense of it. The fear is absolute.

      The phone rings on. The ID says "unknown caller". Her thumb
      is poised to answer, she has no idea --

      She hits the button, stays quiet. She can hear breathing.

      Sarah switches voices and body language to "Beth".

                                      SARAH
                    Hello?

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                          (relieved)
                    Beth. Where have you been?

      Sarah balks - it's her voice. She glances to the body in the
      car, her face.

                                      SARAH
                    Long story.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Well we have a problem. The German
                    came anyway.

                                      SARAH
                          (beat)
                    The German's dead.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    She's what?

                                      SARAH
                    Shot dead, right in front of me.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Are you all right?

                                      SARAH
                    Not really.                                                                                      2. 


                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Jesus. She was right.

                                      SARAH
                    About what?

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                          (like it's obvious)
                    That someone is killing us, Beth.

                                      SARAH
                    Us...?

                                      VOICE
                    Just go slow. What happened?

                                      SARAH
                    It's ... It was a headshot. I didn't
                    even hear it.

      It freaks Sarah all over again, makes her check her
      surroundings.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Where's the body?

                                      SARAH
                    My car.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    You have the body? There, with you?

                                      SARAH
                    Yes.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    I need hair and blood samples.

                                      SARAH
                    Hair and blood...?

                                      VOICE (V.O.)
                      Sterilize. If you touch them they're
                      contaminated.

                                      SARAH
                    I'm a cop. I know what I'm doing.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    I know. So tell me how a cop gets
                    rid of a body.

                                      SARAH
                          (gulps)
                    Actually, open to suggestions there.                                                                                      3. 


                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Bury her.

      She stumbles, breaks character, muttering in her English
      accent.

                                      SARAH
                    Bury her, bloody hell ...

                                      VOICE
                    What?

      Sarah looks to the body again. She has to deal with it.

                                      VOICE (CONT'D)
                    You have no choice, she can't be
                    found. Beth, are you there?

                                      SARAH
                          (back as Beth)
                    I'm here.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Empty her pockets, don't leave
                    anything to identify her.

      Sarah can't think of any other alternative.

                                      SARAH
                    Okay.

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    You can do this. I'll call back.

      The phone goes dead. Sarah drops "Beth". She stares at the
      phone in her shaking hand, rattled to her core.

      Off the body, off her own dead face ...

                                      END OF TEASER                                                                                      4. 


                                          ACT ONE


      The dead, staring German, cooling in the back seat.

      Sarah, sickened, covers her with a car blanket.

      She swabs blood droplets off the front windshield with
      kleenex. Fumbles with bloody hands to swab down the seats.


      The Audi joins the evening exodus out of the city.

      Traffic thins. Suburbs give way to fields. Fields give way
      to forest.


      It's getting light out. Felix is trying to herd out Vic,
      who's the last to leave. Vic has a bottle of bourbon and
      won't let go of his glass.

                                      FELIX
                    Vic, I'm tired.

                                    VIC
                    One last drink. A bourbon. For Sarah.

      Felix groans and takes the bottle, swigs, shivers.

                                      FELIX
                    Okay? Off you go.

                                    VIC
                    My turn.

      Vic tilts the bottle for a long, long pull. When he finishes,
      his eyes are teary.

                                    VIC (CONT'D)
                    Felix, I want to get to know Sarah's
                    daughter.

                                      FELIX
                    Out, Vic.

                                    VIC
                    Why not?

                                      FELIX
                    There's a reason you never met her.

                                    VIC
                    What?

                                      FELIX
                    You're a drug dealer --

                                    VIC
                    -- I could help, financially --

                                      FELIX
                    -- And Sarah left you. She ran,
                    because you're abusive.

                                    VIC
                    I want to make up for it. Felix, I
                    need to stay connected to her ...                                                                                      9. 


                                      FELIX
                    To who?
                          (to get it through
                          his thick skull)
                    Kira is not Sarah. Sarah is dead and
                    she's not coming back. You need to
                    man up and accept that, Vic.

      Vic struggles. Emotion cracks. He opens his arms for a hug,
      beseeching him.

                                    VIC
                    Felix ...

      Felix closes the door in his face. Vic punches it.

                                    VIC (CONT'D)
                    Cold hearted little faggot!


      Sarah comes up the stairs carrying the "money" shoulder bag.
      She turns around a corner, but recoils.

      Vic is stumbling drunk and sniffly down the hall. She holds
      her breath and he passes without seeing her.

      But he lurches to a halt, sensing something through is stupor.
      He turns around. Sarah is gone.


      Felix emerges and enters a scruffy, working class hood.


      Felix looks over a run-down house with a sad rope swing in
      the front yard. He approaches tenuously, not sure what to
      expect. Then the front door flies open and Kira runs out.

                                    KIRA
                    Felix!

      She races into his arms. But not until he looks into her
      face does he know --

                                    KIRA (CONT'D)
                    Did you see my Mum?

                                      FELIX
                    Oh thank God.

                                    KIRA
                    You were at the lake party. Did my
                    Mum go?

                                      FELIX
                    Not exactly, but I happen to know
                    she misses you very much.

      The imposing Mrs. S appears in the door. 50's, a gruff,
      working class Brit. She's been expecting him.

                                    MRS. S
                    Put her down.

      He does, squats to Kira's level.

                                      FELIX
                    Can you play outside for a little
                    while?

                                    MRS. S
                    Uncle Felix has some explaining to
                    do.

      She disappears into the house. Felix is not looking forward
      to this. But it's a huge relief Kira's oblivious. He ruffles
      her hair.


      Sarah leads Art down the crowded sidewalk. He has the shooting
      file in his hand, harassing her.

                                      SARAH
                    I was by myself. We split up,
                      canvassing witnesses on another case.

                                    ART
                    Which case?

                                      SARAH
                    The Ramsay thing. New Sun Jewelry
                    Heist. Point is we weren't even
                    looking for Yip.

                                    ART
                    Yip who? 

                                      SARAH
                    Xan Yip, Yan Yip, however you
                    pronounce it - the US racketeering
                    warrant. I'd seen her sheet that
                    morning, Asian female, 41.

                                    ART
                    And?

      They're standing at an alley mouth.

                                      SARAH
                    And right here I thought I saw Yip.

                                    ART
                    You thought?

                                      SARAH
                    Did. I saw her. I called her name,
                    told her to freeze.

      A pause, staring at one another.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Well she didn't, she ran down there.

                                    ART
                    So what are you waiting for?

                                      SARAH
                    All right, you're making me nervous.

                                    ART
                    Good, you know what it feels like.                                                                                      23. 


      Sarah angrily leads him into the alley.


      Art in a deserted, crumbling courtyard. We've seen it before
      in the photos he holds, the scene of the Maggie Chen shooting.
      Several possible entrances/exits. Sarah stands in one.

                                    ART
                    So you had your weapon drawn, and
                    you saw her from there.

                                      SARAH
                    Glimpsed her. She was just
                      disappearing in there.
                          (points to an exit)
                    I went across --

                                    ART
                    Show me.

      Sarah moves towards the exit as if stalking the suspect.

                                      SARAH
                    I stopped here. That's when I heard
                    someone behind me. I turned ...

      Art has the CRIME SCENE PHOTO in his hand, Maggie Chen with
      two in the chest.

      She is facing the exact spot the body fell. There's still a
      blood stain on the ground. Sarah gulps.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    And I shot her, twice.
                          (a whisper)
                    They were both dressed in black. It
                    wasn't her.

                                    ART
                    Then?

                                      SARAH
                    I saw the phone.

                                    ART
                    And then what?

                                      SARAH
                    Then you finally showed up.

      Art drills her with cop-eye. She points to an entrance.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Over there.                                                                                      24. 


                                    ART
                    And that's how it went down? 

                                      SARAH
                    That's how it went down. Just like
                    our statements.

      He just keeps staring. Waves his hand in front of her face
      like she's a mirror or a ghost. She's sick of it.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    You got something more you want to
                    say, Art?

      At that, Art snaps, shoves her up against a wall.

                                    ART
                    Are you trying to fuck me?

      He frisks her roughly, scaring the shit out of her.

                                    ART (CONT'D)
                    Are you wearing a wire? Are you?

                                      SARAH
                    No.

                                    ART
                    I didn't come in over there.
                          (explodes)
                    I wasn't even here!

      It lands like a bomb.

                                    ART (CONT'D)
                    You called me at home. You said it
                    was an accident. I came down and put
                    the phone in the vic's hand. I lied
                    to I.A. to back you up. So if you
                    took 150 K to cap this woman --

                                      SARAH
                    I didn't!

                                    ART
                    -- If there's another version of the
                    story, Beth, I don't care what it
                    is, it needs to die.

                                      SARAH
                    -- There's only one story --

                                    ART
                    I will put a bullet in your head,
                    you hear me?                                                                                      25. 


      He's raw and emotional. Sarah placates, talking him down.

                                      SARAH
                    Art. I gotta carry what I did. But
                    Maggie Chen was in the wrong place
                    at the wrong time. None of this ends
                    up on you.

      It's partner to partner. Art's just barely believing her.

                                        END ACT TWO                                                                                      26. 


                                        ACT THREE


      ON SARAH'S REFLECTION: In a shop window. Off the German's
      driver's licence, she tries to approximate the photo, tucks
      her hair up under a hat. Tries a German accent.

                                      SARAH
                    Guten morgen, Katja Obinger. Jah
                    schtimpt. Genau, genau.

      Ready, she turns and heads for the doors of the once-grand
      Hotel Diplomat.


      Grey water, grey skies. The Audi parked on a desolate stretch
      of shoreline.                                                                                      33. 


      On the hood of the car, Sarah fiddles with the combination
      lock on the metal briefcase. She looks it over - the hinge,
      the tight seal, the lock to be picked to go deeper.

      She checks her watch. Almost 2 o'clock. Then, fuck it. She
      hefts the case and bashes it again and again on the ground
      like a madwoman until it breaks. Typical looking business
      crap scatters.

      She picks out the German's passport. 2 manilla envelopes.
      Inside one:  X-rays. In the other: Photocopies of photo ID's.
      Different names, European countries. Different haircuts and
      styles, but all the same face - hers. One by one, she lays
      six on the hood, muttering.

                                      SARAH
                    Are you kidding? Austrian, Italian,
                    French ... Beth.

      A copy of Beth's driver's licence as well. The next one
      belongs to ...

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Alison Hendrix.

      A Driver's licence photo. Herself in a cardigan and bob.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Address in Waterloo ... you're
                      practically a local.

      The pink phone rings. Sarah checks her watch, 2pm exactly.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    And punctual.

      Sarah considers the "evidence" before her. She's sick of
      getting nowhere.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Fuck it.

      She completely drops the charade and answers in her own voice.

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    Hello?

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hello?

                                      SARAH
                    Yes? Are you calling for Beth?                                                                                      34. 


                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                          (suddenly cold)
                    Who is this?

                                      SARAH
                    Beth's indisposed. Is this Alison?

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Just one, I'm a few, familyless too.
                    Who am I?

      It's the same riddle the German threw at her.

                                      SARAH
                    Sorry Riddler, means nothing to me.
                    Beth said to say I have the
                      information from the German's hotel.
                          (silence)
                    You want me to bring it to you?

      The phone goes dead. Sarah lets out a slow breath.

      CLOSE ON: the German's passport, Beth, Alison and the Euro-
      ID's laid out. Their faces FLASH BY in a rush.


      The Audi roars out a highway, leaving the city in it's dust.


      The Audi slowly crawls through a bland, upscale, treeless
      travesty. New pavement, new lawns, big new variation-on-a-
      theme houses. 


      And is just getting out when - the garage door starts to
      open. She ducks behind her car as

      A blacked-out SUV emerges fast, races past her down the
      street, garage door closing in it's wake.

      On Sarah:  What is this now? She quickly hops back in the
      Audi, starts the engine.


      Sarah tails the SUV through traffic. Nothing can be seen
      through the rear windows.

      The SUV makes a left turn. Sarah holds up traffic to see the
      car broadside but still can't see the driver. She steps on
      the gas after it.

      Tailing again, the SUV's rear view almost offers a glimpse.

      Then the SUV is signaling, turning into an empty parking
      lot. Sarah drives past, watching as ...


      The SUV rolls slowly across the empty parking lot, pulls
      into a space.


      Sarah pulls up at a distance with a clear view.

      The SUV stops idling. Nothing happens. It just sits there
      looking ominous ...

                                                                                INTERCUT:


      Then the doors burst open and kids pile out. A BOY, 8, and
      GIRL, 9, the girl in a soccer uniform. They bound off to the
      nearby pitch.

      The driver's door opens. Sarah can only see feet, someone
      finishing tying up their cleats, then ...

      ALISON HENDRIX steps out. Another twin. Full Lulu Lemon
      sportmotif, tying her hair back with a scrunchy.

      Sarah slumps lower in her seat.                                                                                      36. 


                                      SARAH
                    Holy shit.

      She takes another peek.

      "Alison" pulls out a bag of balls from the back of the car.
      More cars arrive, dropping kids. Alison waves and greets and
      hectors. She's the coach.

      Off Sarah, gobsmacked, just can't look away ...

                                      SARAH (CONT'D)
                    A soccer mom?

                                      END ACT THREE                                                                                      37. 


                                            ACT FOUR


      ABSTRACT SEQUENCE:

      Soccer practice underway.

      Sarah in the Audi, fixated on the woman at the center of it.

      Alison runs drills with the GIRLS. She helps the GOALIE with
        positioning. She uses two players to illustrate a give-and-
      go. Her son, meanwhile, has to be ball-boy to the girls.

      Sarah reads her: She's competitive, even pushy, especially
      with her daughter. In an unguarded moment, she seems stressed.

      A scrimmage now, Alison refereeing. Her phone rings, she
      checks the ID and has to take it. She gives the whistle to
      another MOM, steps aside to take the call.

      Alison paces away from everyone, closer to Sarah. The call
      looks intense - questions, arguing, some kind of fight. She
      hangs up unsatisfied. Looks around, then turns and heads for
      the PARK WASHROOMS nearby.

      Sarah watches her go in the Women's. Gets out of the car.


      Keeping herself shielded from the soccer pitch, Sarah
      approaches the door. Peeks in.


      To Establish.

      The Audi pulls up across the street.


      SEQUENCE: Under music, side by side, Art and Sarah repeat
      the "walk" into the station from the pilot.

      It's busy, a long way to the front doors. UNIFORMS changing
      shift, DETECTIVES in suits, a knot of BRASS with briefcases.

      Sarah is all Beth, chewing gum, cop swagger. Art walks tall
      beside her, a display of loyalty, challenging anyone
      otherwise. They mount the steps together. Sarah recognizes
      DETECTIVE ANGELA DEANGELIS. She gives her a nod.

      Art holds the door for her. Sarah gives him a rueful smile.
      She has to respect the guy. Then she steps into the station.


      Sarah emerges with Art, they head for the parking lot. He's
      raining on her parade.

                                      SARAH
                    It was good, right?

                                    ART
                    Academy Award.

                                      SARAH
                    Come on. Why do you have to be such
                    a hard ass? I'm back.

                                    ART
                    Are ya? They haven't ruled yet.

                                      SARAH
                    I know but ...
                          (makes her play)
                    Art, Paul doesn't know I took that
                    money out of our account. Let me put
                    it back before he finds out.

                                    ART
                          (scoffs)
                    No, I think I'll hang on to it till
                    you're reinstated.

                                      ANGELA (O.S.)
                    Hey, Beth.

      DeAngelis approaches with a smile.

                                      ANGELA (CONT'D)
                    I hear it went good.

                                      SARAH
                          (off Art)
                    Not outta the woods yet.

                                      ANGELA
                    Whatever, you own the woods.                                                                                      46. 


                                      SARAH
                    Thanks. I should go ...
                          (to Art)
                    I owe Paul some quality time.

                                    ART
                    Yeah, you do.

      Sarah heads off for her car.

      Art and DeAngelis watch her go.

                                      ANGELA
                    Cut her some slack, why don't ya?

                                    ART
                    She's seriously off.

                                      ANGELA
                    It's called a fatal shooting, Art.

                                    ART
                    Nope. That was just Beth. This I
                    can't put my finger on.

      Off Art. He's going to be a problem.


      The Audi parks across the street from Alison's house.                                                                                      47. 



      Sarah crosses to Alison's house. Mounts the steps.

      Felix observes, all paranoid, slumped in his seat.

      She's about to ring the doorbell, but remembers not to. She
      knocks lightly. Nothing. Knocks a little louder.

      She turns and shrugs at Felix in the car. He stage whispers.

                                      FELIX
                    Come back! Run away!

      The door opens a crack behind her.

      Felix squeaks again. He watches her open the door on her
      own, step inside ...
