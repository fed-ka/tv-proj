      1 a.m.  Lit by harsh lamp light.  Detective ERIC COLLINS
      (mid-30s, sleepless good looks) leans intensely over his
      littered desk, cell phone to his ear.  Nobody's answering
      his call.  His partner, detective PAZ HALDERON (30s), stands
      nearby--

                                      COLLINS
                    I had Jen's brother move them.  He
                    was going to hide them somewhere
                    new, somewhere safe.  Then he was
                    supposed to call me.

      Collins slams off his phone in frustration.  Paz glances at
      a TV monitor nearby:  A RECORDING of Collins intensely
      interrogating Billy Grimm on some previous occasion.  Collins
      looks wound tight; Billy looks supremely at ease.

                    This thing between you and Billy has
                    turned seriously twisted, man.  The

                    dirty, you'd have something on him

      Paz studies Collins -- worried about his partner's mental
      state.  Collins labors to make sense of the disjointed clues
      before him.  Suddenly a thought flashes--

                                      COLLINS
                    What was it that latest vic kept
                    repeating before he died?

                    It was really weird, he said -- "These
                    things snap off."  What things was
                    he talking about--

                                      COLLINS
                    No, that wasn't it.  Not exactly. 
                          (straining to remember)
                    He said, "Well -- hey -- these things
                    just... just snap right off."

                                    PAZ
                    But these Billy Grimm whack-jobs are
                    always saying nutty junk, like they're
                    revealing the secrets of the universe--

                                      COLLINS
                    "Well, Hey, These Things..."

      Collins puzzles it out...

                                      COLLINS
                      W.H.T.T.--

      And he quickly shoves through the papers on his desk, finds
        a wrinkled-torn GAS STATION MAP.  Handwritten in what looks
      like BLOOD:  letters scribbled all around the map.  Collins
      grabs a marker, starts finding and circling initials --

                                    PAZ
                    Uh, that's evidence you're marking

                    "...Just Snap Right Off."  J.S.R.O...

      Collins finishes.  Considers the pattern.  Then -- he quickly
      draws spokes between them.  Circles the point where the spokes
      all intersect.  He looks at Paz.  He may've figured it out.

      On the TV monitor, the RECORDED IMAGE of Billy Grimm now
      stares at the interrogation camera... seemingly right at
      Collins in this room.  Right at us.  Eerie.CULT

      Collins drives way too fast for this road.  Paz, the map in
      his lap, just holds on for dear life.

                                    PAZ
                    Even if this map means something, it
                    doesn't mean Billy's people have
                    taken your family--

                                      COLLINS
                    They wanted me to find this place.

                                    PAZ
                    What place?  There's nothing out
                    here--

                                      COLLINS
                    Yes there is...

      UP AHEAD:  a rough-hewn ISOLATED CABIN.  Dark, ominous.  Lit
      only by the full moon.  A 70's PLYMOUTH VALIANT, a distinctive
      dull-orange color, is parked in front.


      The door is KICKED open.  It's Collins -- WEAPON and MAGLITE
      in hand.  He enters the shadowy cabin -- and freezes at what
      he sees.  Paz is a step behind him.  He also freezes.

      EVERY SURFACE - WALLS, WINDOWS, TABLES, FLOOR -- IS COVERED
      IN WORDS AND DRAWINGS.  Crazed.  Chilling. 

      Collins eases into the hellish environment.  Paz follows.

                                      COLLINS
                      Definitely the work of Billy's
                      followers. 

      Collins is at a section of the chaotically-painted wall where
      the ancient wallpaper has buckled, creating an uneven texture. 
      Then, suddenly, as he's watching:  A PAIR OF HUMAN EYES OPEN -
      INSET IN THE WALL.  Collins and Paz react in shock:A MAN'S
      BODY is inset in this wall, painted to perfectly blend in.

                                    PAZ

      Collins and Paz pull the man free, leaving a perfectly-shaped
      indent in the wall.  The man, nearly dead, stares up at
      Collins, barely any voice--

                                    MAN

      The man tries to form words, straining...

                    Jen and Andy -- where are they?

                    them...

      Collins' worst nightmare has just come to life.

                                      COLLINS
                    It was Billy Grimm's people, wasn't
                    it?  Where did they take them?
                          (no answer)
                    Douglas-- !

      The man meets Collins' eye.  And with his dying breath, says--

                    Well hey... these things just...
                    snap right off...

      The man falls back, lifeless.  Collins stares in gathering
      horror.  HOLD on Collins.  And then...

      Something completely unexpected happens:  we suddenly HEAR
        appreciative LAUGHTER.  Then, from seeming nowhere, PEOPLES'
      VOICES CALL OUT:  "Whoa!"  "Total freak out!"  "I knew it!" 
      "Say buh-bye, Collins - your wifey and son are his-tor-y!" 
      "The cult's got 'em now!"  

      And we slowly PULL AWAY from Collins TO REVEAL... a WALL-

      A good CROWD.  Everybody drinking, having a good time. 
      Watching the bar's 70-INCH.  A banner reads:  "CULT" NIGHT
      at Henri's.  Every Weds Nite.  Be Here - Or bleed!

      On the TV:  Collins is outside the cabin, face ashen, trying
      to catch his breath.  And it begins to sink in on us...

      Everything we've just watched with Collins and Paz - is a
      television series called "CULT". 

      And we CUT AROUND TO:

      MONTAGE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

      -- In a SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM, a YOUNG COUPLE draped on the
      sofa, watching "CULT"...

      -- In ANOTHER HOME, TWO SISTERS, 30s, glasses of wine,
      watching...

      -- In an OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY, two SECURITY GUARDS (one
      male, one female) watching on a small TV...

      -- In a TEENAGER'S ROOM, TEEN GIRLS on the bed, laptops open,
      simultaneously on LIVE CHATS about the show while watching...

      And finally --


        A brightly-colored, cool-retro place - dedicated to TV and
      its FANS.  FOLKS lounge, drinking coffee, watching TV on
      various wall-mounted sets.  We PUSH PAST other sections where
      different TV shows, past and present, live and recorded, are
      being watched and enjoyed.  To:

      A section in the back.  The section dedicated to "CULT".

      The "CULT" FANS are a cross-section.  Most just watch and
      enjoy the show.  But there are a few others who are far more
      engrossed -- they actually have notebooks or laptops open...
      their focus on the show much more serious. 

      We SWEEP through the "CULT" fans - finally coming upon: 
      NATE SEFTON, 25, scruffy -- with a certain lost puppy dog
      vibe.  He's rapid-fire texting with somebody. 

      His eye goes to his well-worn "CULT"-centric notebook in his
      lap -- filled with arcane writing and drawings.  Then he
      looks at the TV -- with a very different expression than
      anyone else.  His is a look of excitement mixed with --
      nervous uncertainty.CULT

      He has to find his voice, calls over to a conservatively-
      dressed woman seated across the way with her own filled
      notebook and pen at ready as she watches the show--

      The woman looks up, sees Nate's expression, reacts, and
      instantly hurries over.  This is MERRIAM LIVINGSTON, 47.

      Merriam stares, wide-eyed.

                    I think so...

      Merriam's expression tells us:  whatever this is, it's huge. 
      Nate rapidly starts gathering his things.

                                      MERRIAM
                    C'mon, you and I are in this together.

                    Nate--

      But Nate is already rushing for the exit.  He slams into
      buoyant coffee server KIRSTIE, 20.  Kirstie turns to watch
      Nate exit, and we SEE a moment of worldly-awareness in her
      face that we don't expect from someone so young.  Has she
      overheard what Nate just said?

      Kirstie delivers a coffee to Merriam, and she clocks Merriam's
      anxious expression, as well.

                    are you, man?

      Jeff recognizes a quality in Nate's voice.  Breaths a SIGH. 
      He doesn't want to ask, but--

      CLOSE as Nate's hand anxiously checks the deadbolt and door
      lock.  PAN UP.  Nate is even more on edge than last night. 
      Into his CELL PHONE--

                                    NATE
                    I'm... it's just that I'm freaking
                    out here a little... definitely
                    freaking out...

      Instead of being concerned, Jeff just shakes his head.

                                    JEFF
                    C'mon, bro.  We talked about this.

      There's a NOISE beyond Nate's door.  Could be nothing.  But
      it totally spooks Nate that somebody might be out there.

                                    NATE
                    I've got to see you--

                                    JEFF
                    You agreed.  We're not going to start
                    this up again.

                                    NATE
                    Please.  It's maybe a matter of life
                    and death.
                          (another NOISE outside)
                      Definitely life and death--

      Jeff has been here with Nate too many times before.  But he
      also can't stop himself from caring for Nate.  Resolved SIGH--

                                    JEFF
                    You want me to come to your apartment?

                                    NATE
                    No.  Uh, someplace public.  The pier.

                                    JEFF
                    ...Half an hour.

      And with a resigned look, Jeff hangs up.

      ON NATE.  Also hangs up.  Glances at his messy desk.  Eyes
      his "CULT" NOTEBOOK.  Stares like it's a coiled rattlesnake. 

      We PUSH IN on the cover.  Among the other chaotic drawings
      is Nate's hand-rendering of the insanity-inspired "CULT" 
      box logo.  OFF this--CULT

      There's no misinterpreting the apparent true terror in that
      cry.  And the line just DIES.

                                    JEFF
                    -- Nate?

      Jeff stands there a moment.  Not sure whether Nate is
        bullshitting him or not.  He hits auto-dial.  Pause.  And
      the call goes directly to VOICE MAIL.

      Jeff doesn't know whether he should be royally pissed -- or
      sincerely worried.  Right now, he's both.  HOLD, and--


      Jeff eases open the door.  The place is a neglected mess. 

                                    JEFF
                    Nate...?  You in here?

      The TV is ON.  We notice that "CULT" (muted) is playing as
      Jeff moves past.  He checks the kitchenette, opens the bedroom
      door.  Nobody home. 

      He moves to the cluttered desk and -- finds Nate's CELL PHONE
      still here.  Jeff's expression darkens.

      While Jeff tries to fathom all this, his hand accidentally
      brushes the desk chair.  It slowly turns.  And Jeff jumps.

      THE CLOTH CHAIR IS SOAKED THROUGH WITH BLOOD.

      Jeff stares in gathering horror.  ON the TV beyond him: 
      "CULT" plays...

      Two UNIFORMED COPS, a pair of DETECTIVES.  Jeff, very
      troubled, watches as a CSI GUY takes a sample from the blood-
      soaked chair.  Too-good-to-retire LAPD detective ROSE SAKELIK,
      55, eases around the room, taking it all in, listening to--

                                    JEFF
                    He called me around nine.  He sounded --
                      distressed.  It was a bad connection. 
                    The call ended... or was cut off. 
                    So I decided to come over and talk
                    to him face to face...

      Sakelik studies him.

                                      SAKELIK
                    You think the call was cut off?

                                    JEFF
                    Could've been.  I don't really know.
                          (eying the room)
                    No signs of aggressive contact.  No
                    forced entry.  The blood is contained,
                    no splatter. 

      Sakelik looks at him curiously.  Jeff explains--

                                    JEFF
                    I'm a reporter.  My first job outta
                    college was working city crime in
                    Philly.  When will you have DNA on
                    whether the blood is Nate's?

                                      SAKELIK
                    Soon enough.  You and your brother
                    get along?

      She says it quickly, to throw Jeff off.  Jeff realizes --
      he's under suspicion.

                                    JEFF
                    Fine.  We got along fine.

      Sakelik studies him.  Her feelers out.  Jeff hates to go
      there, but...

      A UNIFORMED COP is exiting the bedroom -- holding up an
      evidence back containing a DRUG PARAPHERNALIA KIT.  He hands
      it to Sakelik.

      The CSI Guys glance at Sakelik now.  They've gotten the
      message.  Jeff realizes the search is taking a new direction.

      Jeff is near Nate's desk -- sees a sliver of Nate's CELL
      PHONE showing beneath some papers.  He glances at Sakelik
      who is now poking in the kitchenette. 

      Jeff decides.  And covertly slips the cell phone into his

      Jeff jumps.  Sakelik's partner, detective MARIO ZAVALA, 35,
      is referring to the TV.  He didn't see Jeff take the phone.

      of:  Billy Grimm, that creepy guy from the "CULT" promo. 

      This is Jeff's first real look at the show. 

      Frowning, Jeff eases closer.  Eying the screen.  Curious. 
      Uncertain.  Moment, then he turns up the SOUND enough to
      hear.  We PUSH IN on the TV.  And suddenly we're watching--


      Jeff staring, absorbing all that he just witnessed.  Not to
      mention:  he reaches into his jacket -- and brings out the
      identical 3-D glass.  The ones Nate gave him at the pier.

      He looks around at the cops, to say something.  But they're
      all across the room, with the drug paraphernalia kit in hand,
      in hushed conversations.  Jeff glances back at the 3-D
      glasses.  It's all so crazy. 

      Sakelik heads this way, and Jeff instinctively shoves the
      glasses back into his pocket.  HOLD on Jeff, his head
      swimming.  He looks back at the TV.  The TITLE SEQUENCE of a
      new episode is just ending.  The credit comes up--

      very unsettling CUT.  And they'd be deeply disturbing --except
      for the "CULT" crew caps on their heads and unlit cigarettes

                    Sure, and the network loves the fan
                    passion.

      Nearby, Skye is working a copier.  She can't help but
      eavesdrop--

                    Look, I'm new at the network, and
                    new to this show.  But at Fox I was
                    the guy who kept Joss on the air
                    more than one season -- and I've got
                    some definite ideas on how to course-
                    correct "Cult" so it doesn't just
                    end up--

                      SEGALFISHER
        -- a cult show.-- a cult show.

      They're moving away from Skye -- and she can't hear them. 
      She instantly grabs up some pages and moves closer to them,
      "dropping" the pages so she has to kneel to pick them up...

                    As you know, Steven writes every
                    episode.  You buy a show like this,
                    you're buying one man's vision. 
                      Especially on this show...

                                      SEGAL
                    And it's Steven Rae's vision that
                    makes the show.  I respect that. 
                      Seriously.  But it would be in
                      everyone's best interest for Steven
                    to hear what I have to say.  And the
                    sooner the better.

      Skye freezes in her paper-gathering.  She knows Segal is
      speaking blaspheme.  Fisher sighs--

                                      FISHER
                    All I can do is e-mail Steven and
                    ask him.

                                      SEGAL
                    Super.  I knew you'd understand.
                          (all smiles)
                    Let Steven know I definitely look
                    forward to getting creative with
                    him.

      Skye watches Segal exit.  As he's exiting, someone else is
      entering.  It's -- Jeff.  Escorted by the show's publicist,
      TERI McNABB, 45.  Skye stands up with her papers -- and she
      bumps directly into Jeff.  Their eyes meet.CULT

                    No problem.

      The slightest moment passes between them -- then Jeff moves 
      off with Teri.

                    I must say, I'm so glad that the
                    Post is willing to give a fresh look
                    at our show.

                      Unfortunately your Mr. Shales thought
                    we were a tad on the dark side. 
                    But, as you know, today's television
                    is just so competitive.  And we're
                      justifiably proud that "Cult" is
                    truly like nothing else presently on
                    the air.

                    I'm particularly interested in knowing
                    about the show's impact on the people
                    who watch.

                    Very passionate.  Word of mouth on
                    this show is fabulous.  Makes my job
                    as a publicist so much easier.

                    Are you aware of any particular --

                    you mean.

      Jeff studies her expression.  She seems to sincerely have no
      idea what he's talking about.

      Then Teri's young assistant, ANNE, 23, hurries up to Teri. 
      Anne throws Jeff a nervous look, whispers to Teri, handing

                    mail you some promotional materials. 
                    Used the e-mail address off your
                      Washington Post business card here. 
                    And much to her surprise -- the 
                    e-mail bounced back. 

      Jeff knows where this is going.

                                    JEFF
                    I can explain--

                                    TERI
                    So she called the Post.  And
                      discovered a very interesting piece
                    of information.  Namely -- you don't
                    work there anymore.

                                    JEFF
                    Look, I'm sorry.  I just -- I need a
                    few minutes with this Steven Rae.  I
                    need to ask him about his show--

      Now Teri figures she has him pegged--

                                    TERI
                    You fans will do absolutely anything
                    to try to get to Steven--

                                    JEFF
                      I honestly don't give a damn about
                    your show.  I know how it sounds,
                    but... my brother's the fan, and he --
                    he's disappeared.

      Jeff feels like a jerk saying this.  Meanwhile, Skye perks
      as she hears this.  Teri regards him -- is he potentially
      dangerous?  To Anne--

                                    TERI
                    Call Security.  Tell them we have an
                    intruder.  Tell them to make it fast.

      Jeff wants to try to rationalize with her.  But knows he
      can't.  Everyone is staring at him now.  The only one with a
      different expression is -- Skye.


      As they race inside from the stark sunlight.  Jeff's eyes
      adjust -- and he reacts to the chaotically-painted
        surrounding.  THEY ARE IN THE ISOLATED CABIN SET from the
      show (as seen in our opening).  Empty now, lit by worklights.

                                    JEFF
                    Is this... from the show?

                    Yeah.  You don't watch?

      Jeff eyes the walls with ill-ease, and definite distaste.

                                    JEFF
                    No.  But my brother does.  A lot,
                      apparently.

                    ...And he's disappeared?

      And, again, that sense that this holds special meaning for
      Skye.  Jeff nods, still eying the surroundings.CULT

                    Just because he watches the show, it
                    doesn't mean--

                                    JEFF
                    I saw him yesterday -- before he

                    And, bizarre as it sounds, according
                    to him, it had everything to do with
                    this show.

      Skye considers this.

                                    JEFF
                    You work on the show?

                          (can't believe he's

                    Is there any reason my brother's
                      disappearance could be related to...?

      Skye doesn't answer.  But Jeff reads the uncertainty in her
      eye.

                                    SKYE
                    Did you go to the police?

                    They think his disappearance might
                    be drug related.  My brother's had
                    some problems in the past.  But I
                    don't think that's what this is.

      Jeff looks around curiously at the smattering of FANS
      watching, a couple of them working their laptops or
        smartphones.  He glances at all the creepy SCREEN CAPTURES
      pinned to the walls.  More strangeness.

      Jeff turns.  An older man, GLEN, 60s, seated at one of the
      tall-stool cafe tables.  Beside him is VIRGIE, also 60s. 
      Both wear blood-red t-shirts featuring the "CULT" box logo.

                                    JEFF
                    No, not really.

      She indicates her mobility scooter parked nearby -- every
      inch adorned with "CULT" imagery (photos, arcane symbols). 
      Jeff stares -- his expression saying it all.

                    When you called, I was hoping you
                    might know something.  Considering
                    that your brother's also--

      He doesn't finish the thought -- clearly troubled that his
      wife may be missing with Jeff's brother.

                    When was the last time you heard

                    She said she was running errands. 
                    But there was a tone in her voice. 
                    And she just... never came home.

                    Merriam is forty-seven...

                    Look -- if my brother and your wife
                    are someplace together, I... I don't
                    think it's like that.

                          (trying to fathom it)
                    Six months ago, after our daughter's
                    wedding, Merriam just seemed... lost. 
                    It happens, I know.  Facing the empty
                    nest.  Didn't know what to do with
                    herself.

                    But then, all of a sudden, she just --

                    months she's actually been perkier
                    than I've seen her in years.

                    No.  Neither of us do.  We only have
                    the one set.  It's in the den.  I'm
                    not even sure it's plugged in.


      Kirk leads Jeff inside.  Points to the TV off to one side,
      books stacked on top.  Kirk glances around the room--

                                    KIRK
                    Merriam spent so much of her time in
                    here.  It was supposed to be my den,
                    but Merriam made it into her sewing
                    room.

      Jeff notes the decor -- so warm and wholesome.

                                    KIRK
                    She was always making clothes and
                    such -- whatever members of our church
                    needed.
                          (beat)
                    This was her little hideaway.  

      Jeff looks at the TV.  Its presence somehow ominous.  The
      phone RINGS o.s.  Kirk says anxiously--

                                    KIRK
                    Maybe that's...  Excuse me, please--

      And he hurries off.  Jeff glances at the completely wholesome
      sewing room.  He notices Merriam's large sewing box, with a
      needlepoint decoration inlaid in the top.  And he freezes --

      Hidden in the needlepoint pattern:  the "CULT" box logo.

      Chilled, Jeff reaches out, opens it.  All the typical sewing
      accouterments.  Then Jeff sees a flap of material, and pulls
      it.  Revealing -- a false bottom.  Jeff lifts it and sees:

      Screen captures from the show, pages of madly-scribbled notes,
      sketches.  Beneath these:  a folded green dress.  Then he
      sees:  a photograph.  In the photo is Merriam -- wearing the
      dress Jeff just found.  And beside her stands -- Nate.

      The hair on Jeff's necks stands up.  His brother is wearing
      the outfit cult leader Billy Grimm wears on the show -- with
      the 10-inch bowie knife held prominently in his hand.

      Jeff stares.  Suddenly -- his cell phone RINGS.

      And she hurries off.  Jeff's eyes follow her.  Not exactly
      sure what to make of her.  HOLD, and-- 


      Skye sits hunched over her laptop, deep in concentration. 

      While she works, Jeff can't help himself.  His eye is drawn
      to one of the TVs.  Where a new snippet from "CULT" plays...


      Collins kneels in this darkened room, holding JOEY KELLER,
      35, who lies on the floor beside the bed, absolutely terrified--

                                      COLLINS
                    Dammit, Joey -- where's my family?! 
                    Where are they?!

      Joey stares -- but Collins isn't who he's afraid of...

                                    JOEY
                    If Billy finds out I let you find
                    me... he's gonna be mad at me... I
                    don't want Billy mad at me...

                                      COLLINS
                    I'll see that you're protected--

                                    JOEY
                          (manic laugh)
                    You -- protect me?  From Billy?

                    What have you done with my wife and
                    boy?

      Joey sees the desperation in Collins' eyes.  Perhaps hoping
      for some sort of redemption, he finally says...

                                    JOEY
                    ...in a cabin... Meyer's Woods...

                    I've been to that cabin!  They're
                    not there!

                                    JOEY
                    But you didn't really see.  You gotta
                    look beyond what's right in front of
                    you -- or you'll never find the
                    answer...

                            into Collins' eyes)
                    I don't want Billy mad at me...

      And, suddenly, Joey pulls a gun from behind his back.  Collins
      instantly grabs for it -- but Joey doesn't aim it at Collins,
      instead swings it against his own temple, and--


      -- Jeff flinches at the REPORT and FLASH of the gun.  Jeff
      grimaces at what he's just watched.  Then, breaking in:CULT

      They drive in silence.  The weirdness of where they are headed --
      combines with the plain oddness of being alone like this.

                    all of this.  And I've got a very
                    big problem about that...

      She drops a file in front of Jeff.  Jeff looks -- it is a
      file on Jeff.

                                    JEFF
                    You've been investigating me?

      Jeff doesn't reply.

                    You lied on a story.  Just fabricated
                    a central source, that's all...

      Skye looks over at Jeff, surprised.  And she's further
      surprised when -- Jeff doesn't deny it.

                                      SAKELIK
                    And word is six D.C. cops went to
                    jail because of that story.

                                    JEFF
                    They went to jail -- and are still
                    in jail -- because they were dirty.

                    you're not lying to me now?

      Jeff has no reply.  Skye studies him. 

                                      SAKELIK
                    You want to clear this up, I suggest
                    you find your brother and get his
                    ass in here.  Fast.

      But Skye is already staring out the window, lost in puzzled
      thought.  Then her eye goes to Jeff walking back to his car. 

      CLOSE - SKYE ... and we see the deeply-felt sympathy she
      feels for him playing clearly on her face.  HOLD.  Then we: 
      PRE-LAP SOUND of urgent searching, and--


      SERIES OF SHOTS -- as Jeff fiercely tears apart Nate's
      apartment:  the mattress is upended, drawers are yanked out,
      the medicine cabinet rifled, etc.  Until--

      Jeff stops.  Breathing hard.  He's exhausted every possible
      hiding place.  HOLD.  He doesn't want to go there.  But--

      His eye goes to the one place in the room where the true
      answer might lie.  He looks at Nate's television.  The dark
      screen staring back at him blankly.  Ominously.

      Jeff finds the remote.  Considers, then -- switches ON the
      TV.  STATIC and SNOW.  Jeff scrolls the DVR menu.  And sees:
      every recording is "CULT".  He moves to the last recording--

                                    JEFF
                    Okay, bro, let's see exactly what
                    you were watching the night before
                    you disappeared...

      ON THE TV:  "Previously on CULT..." and Jeff watches snippets
      of previous episodes:  Collins and his wife JEN and their 3-
      year-old SON playing in a park (pre-disappearance)...  The
      orange Plymouth Valiant parked ominously near Collins' house,
      following as Jen drives their son to preschool...

      Jeff hits JUMP on the remote.

      ON THE TV:  Now we SEE that scene of Collins confronting
      Billy Grimm at his compound (the scene he watched earlier). 

      Jeff JUMPS again.  ON THE TV:  Collins with Joey Keller in
      the motel room--

                                    JOEY (ON TV)

                    answers!

      This sinks in on Jeff.  He hits JUMP again.  ON THE TV: 
      it's a scene he hasn't seen before:  Collins ripping past
      CRIME SCENE tape to get back into that isolated cabin in the
      woods (from our opening scene).CULT

      Curious, Jeff stops, let's this scene play...


      Collins moves purposefully into the cabin.  His partner Paz
      is with him.  There's the man-shaped space in the wall, but
      otherwise the room is unchanged.

                                    PAZ
                    C'mon, Collins.  There's no way your
                    family were ever here.  After we
                    found your brother-in-law, the whole
                    place was combed and combed again--

      Collins keeps pacing the room, drinking in the madness on
      the walls, desperate for an answer.  The answer.

      Then, suddenly, a thought hits him.  And he pulls out the   
      3-D glasses that Billy Grimm gave him.  Puts them on and
      begins to scan the chaotic images on the walls.

                                    PAZ
                    Collins -- c'mon--

                                      COLLINS
                          (with desperation)
                    Look beyond what's right in front of
                    you...

      Finally, Collins looks down at the floor.  And--

      SOMETHING SUDDENLY JUMPS OUT AT HIM FROM THE FLOOR --
      startling him.  It is:  A 3-D IMAGE hidden among the
      overlapping graphics.  It's a representation of a trapdoor.

      Collins falls to his knees, starts urgently feeling around.

                                    PAZ
                    What is it?  What did you see?

      Collins' hand touches -- A RECESSED HANDLE.  Completely
      obscured.  Paz stares in amazement.  Collins pulls his gun. 

      Collins yanks open a trap door.  The trap door is lined with
      insanely thick sound-proof padding.  Jagged wooden stairs
      lead down.  Collins starts down--


      Dark and disturbing.  Collins hears -- a tiny WHIMPER.

      Across the room is a sealed box.  Collins races to it.  He
      smashes the latch, throws it open.  And FREEZES.

      Inside is his SON.  Dirt-streaked, disheveled -- but alive.CULT

                    Andy-- !!

      Collins sweeps him up, hugs him tightly with streaming tears.

                                      COLLINS
                    It's okay, son... it's okay...

      Paz spies something taped to the inside of the box.  He
      reaches for it.  It's a slate-black DVD -- blank, except for
      that CIRCLED M SYMBOL carved on it (Steven Rae's important
      "graffiti" symbol from earlier).

      Then Paz notices something else -- as little Andy clings to
      Collins, his t-shirt has ridden up.

                                    PAZ
                          (quaking voice)
                    Look...

      Collins looks.  There's something on the boy's skin.  Collins
      lifts the shirt.  And his blood runs cold:  there's a large
      box tattoo on his son's abdomen.

      As Collins stares in horror and anger, the boy says weakly--

                                    ANDY
                    Where's mommy...?

      HOLD on Collins, and--


      Back to Jeff, staring at the TV.  He plops back against Nate's
      desk, trying to fathom it.  He glances over, sees a photo
      Nate has kept of the two of them as boys.  In their bedroom
      at home.  Happier times.  Then something tucked in the shelf
      beside the photo catches his eye--

      The spine of a brightly-colored book.  Jeff thinks he
      recognizes it.  He pulls it out, revealing--

      Nate's "CULT" notebook.  That book Nate had with him that
      day at the pier.  Jeff looks at the psychotically-drawn "CULT"
      box logo on the front.  Jeff really doesn't want to open it. 
      But he does...

      INSIDE:  Nate's copious notes, drawings, pasted screen
      captures, Nate's own matching photos of the same locations.

      Jeff keeps flipping pages.  And he comes to -- a page pasted
      with a repeat pattern of baseballs.  Odd.  Then, slowly,
      Jeff begins to recognize it.  He grabs the photo of Nate and
      him in their childhood room.  Behind them -- the wallpaper
      is the exact same pattern of baseballs.CULT

      12-YEAR-OLD JEFF and 5-YEAR-OLD NATE -- as they peel back a
      section of the wallpaper.  There's a hidden hole -- their
      childhood hiding place -- full of candy, baseball cards,
      comic books...

      BACK TO SCENE

      Jeff stares at the identical baseball pattern on the page. 
      Puzzling it.  Then he touches the page, and notes:  there's
      a slight unnatural thickness to this page.  It's actually
      two pages glued together.  And there's something hidden
      between them.

                                    JEFF
                    Look beyond what's right in front of
                    you...

      Jeff quickly tears at the page.  And his eyes widen at the
      sight of:  a slate-black DVD disc, with the CIRCLED M SYMBOL
      carved in it.  Identical to the one he just saw on TV.  Jeff's
      heart immediately jumps.

      He looks over at the TV.  Where "CULT" continues to play...

                    wife is by stepping completely away
                    from his normal life.  Completely
                    immerse himself into this... this

                    -- What is that?

      Jeff studies it.  And -- it dawns on him.  He reaches over
      to his hanging jacket and takes out -- the 3-D GLASSES that
      Nate gave him.  Skye recognizes them from the show--

                    Nate gave them to me.  Said they
                    might come in handy...

      Jeff slides on the glasses and looks at the SCREEN.  And--

      JEFF'S POV -- the BLURRY IMAGES now extend in 3-D from the
      screen.  Coming right into the room with Jeff.  Blank spaces:

                    It's blank spaces.  Like I'm supposed
                    to enter in letters...

      Jeff puzzles it.  Then -- a look of uneasy recognition hits.

                                    JEFF
                    Merriam told us exactly what it is...

      Jeff leans forward and begins typing.

      Jeff takes off the glasses, hits ENTER.  The drive WHIRS
      anew.  And Skye notices the RED WI-FI LIGHT starting to BLINK--

      Jeff and Skye watch and wait.  Ready for anything.  We PUSH
      IN on the BLINKING RED LIGHT.  And CUT AWAY TO:


      ON Jeff, Skye beside him, watching the laptop screen.  The
      drive is working, but the screen remains blank, interrupted
      only by occasional strange FLICKERS.  The anticipation is
      unnerving.  Then--

      What a strange time for her to ask.  Then Jeff realizes --
      it's her way of dealing with the tension.  Long moment, then--

                                    JEFF
                    I lied to protect my source.  My

                    real one.  These scumbag cops would've
                    killed him for sure.

                    It was a judgment call.  And I'd do

                    But you told me...

      Jeff looks at her.  Yeah, he did.  He somehow trusts her in
      a way he hasn't trusted anyone else.  Play the moment.  Then--

      Jeff's laptop begins to go wild.  Rapid-fire IMAGES, wild,
      insane, begin to FLASH.  Jeff and Skye stare.  It's like
      reaching the top of the roller-coaster, when you have no
      idea what's about to come.

      The IMAGES FLASH faster and faster -- building to --
      something.  Then--

      Jeff's CELL PHONE RINGS.  Loud.  Startling them.  And very
      bizarre timing.  Jeff tentatively opens his phone.  HEARS --
      that distant STATIC again.

      Then, suddenly -- Billy Grimm's face appears.  It's the promo

      Back at that alley, we WATCH Sakelik slide into her sedan,
      leaving the crime scene.  She puts in the key, then notices
      that her detective's notebook has fallen from the passenger
      seat.  She reach for it, her sleeve rides up.  And--

      THERE IS ONE OF THE BOX TATTOOS ON HER FOREARM.

      She casually pulls down her sleeve, fires up the car, and--


      A bundle is thrown in.  It's Segal.  Bound psycho-style with
      duct tape.  Eyes wide with fear.  His SCREAMS muffled. 

      Kirstie is already in the front seat.  Now someone climbs in
      behind the wheel.  Kirstie snuggles close.  We don't see the
      driver's face -- but we do SEE:  CLOSE STUDIES of what the
      driver is wearing.  Jeans, and that very distinctive vest. 
      Billy Grimm's clothes.  And, of course, that 10-inch knife.

      CAMERA PULLS OUT THROUGH the car window--
