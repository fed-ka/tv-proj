WILL, 15, serious about his dress shirt and sweater vest, 
stares out at a sea of teenagers waiting for the morning 
bell... His buddies JAY, SIMON and NEIL (holding a football) 
sit on a concrete picnic table next to him.  

WILL V.O.
My name is Will Mackenzie.  And 
these... are my closest friends.

WILL
You really think throwing a 
football will make a girl like you?

NEIL
It makes her see him as an athlete.  
Subliminal advertising.

True.  It s liminal.

...And, as I came from a school 
where popularity was determined by 
how early you got into Harvard...

Simon, across the lawn now, pivots in front of Carly and 
LAUNCHES THE FOOTBALL.  A nice tight spiral.  Carly and the 
other students watch as it sails through the air towards the 
guys.  Will jogs a few steps and CATCHES IT.  People notice.  
A brief moment of cool that s not lost on him.

WILL V.O. (CONT D)
...It was nice to be at somewhere you 
could have it by throwing a football.

Will drops back and hurls the ball with all his might.  It 
flips through the air, end-over-end, veering wildly off 
course and slamming into the head of a special-ed student 
struggling to walk on arm braces.  He goes down hard.

The students gasp at the challenged kid, moaning and flopping 
around on the ground, then turn their glare at Will, who 
stares in silent horror. 

WILL V.O. (CONT D)
Yup...  This was going to be great.

ACT ONE

WILL V.O. (CONT D)
So far my first day of public school 
had been a wonderful voyage of 
discovery...  About how awful public 
schools were.

MISCELLANEOUS SHOTS OF SCHOOL DAY

- WILL opens his locker door.  It comes off in his hand.

- WILL walks down a CROWDED HALLWAY.  A group of students 
chuckle at his briefcase.  He pretends not to notice.

- WILL approaches the door to the LIBRARY and tugs on it.  
It s locked.  He sees a sheet of paper taped inside, reading: 
 Closed for budgetary reasons. 

- WILL enters a CLASSROOM, the briefcase on his back - his 
 a Jansport.  He heads to arms through the handles like it s
an empty seat, when the briefcase opens and his books fall 
out in a noisy avalanche.  He smiles tightly.


SIMON, JAY and NEIL walk away from the school in a crowd of 
students.  WILL hurries up to them.

WILL V.O.
If I was going to survive this 
 do it school, I knew I couldn t
alone.  High School is a scary place 
and there s safety in numbers.

about skipping.

will always find something they like 
 about you.  Even if it snot you.

WILL walks along the sidewalk with his briefcase. 

WILL V.O.
The next morning I headed to 
 house to skip school for Simon s
the first time ever.  

A school bus full of kids passes by.  Will squirms guiltily, 
but presses on, approaching:

There he is.  The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   14.


Will freezes, not at all ready for this.  He gives Mrs. 
Cooper a doff of his invisible hat...

WILL
Hello there, Madam.

And regrets it immediately.

MRS. COOPER

Oh, yes.  I drive everywhere.  I

eyebrows.

MRS. COOPER
The panel van?

Will looks at the faded 1980 Econoline and cringes.

WILL
Yyyes.  It is a little molestery, I 
know.  But I got a great deal.  
From a molester.  But its never 
been-- he never molested in it.  
Just transported... to molest.

JAY

Stop saying molested.

Bye, Mom.

Mrs. Cooper nods, unsure, as they start down the street 
towards the van.  She heads back inside as they get to it.  The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   15.


SIMON (CONT D)
Well that was flawless.

WILL
I should have pointed to the Volvo.

JAY
You think?

A balding, 40-something guy with a creepy mustache approaches 
and smiles delightedly at the sight of them. 

GUY
You guys need a lift?

NEIL
Sure!

Will, Jay and Simon glare wide-eyed at Neil, then tear off.  
Neil shrugs apologetically to the guy and hurries after them.


The guys sit around a fountain in a city park.

WILL V.O.
So, so far - skipping school had 
 mom, consisted of lying to Simon s
dodging a rape, and hanging out 
with the only other people not in 
school or at work.

A group of toddlers skip by.  Jay crumples his 7-11 cup and 
hurls it after one of them.

WILL V.O. (CONT D)
Two year-olds.

JAY
Alright, this is totally lame.

NEIL
Yeah.  We should get up a game of

No, we should get some booze.

Well, we could use my fake ID but I

night.  So stupid.

 the middle of the You know, it s
school day.  The stores are 
expecting adults.  Somebody just 
has to look the part. 

All eyes turn to Will, specifically his preppy outfit and 
briefcase.

What, because I tuck my shirt in?

NEIL
You also talk kinda grownuppy.

Will sighs, resigned.

JAY finishes pouring the Remy Martin into paper cups.

JAY

They all take a shot, then immediately cringe.

Holy God.

JAY
No no no.  Not intimate enough.  
You want to be romantic, you have 
to aim straight for the heart.

Simon nods.

WILL V.O.

advice for killing a deer, it was 
all Simon needed to make his move.

Sure.

I think writing her last name is 
especially important.  Even though

to risk any Carly-based confusion.

CARLY approaches on the sidewalk with her buddies, including 
her best friend WENDY, on their way home from school.  They 
stop in their tracks at the sight of the spray-painted drive.

CARLY
What the hell is that?

SIMON
What?

Simon looks up, caught.

CARLY
Simon, why are you spray-painting 
my driveway?!

SIMON
Um--

CARLY
What does it--

Will, Jay and Neil stifle drunken laughter.

SIMON
Look, I can easily wash it off -- 
and we can pretend this never 
happened, and I could not tell

ACT THREE


 WILL and SIMON (looking a bit hammered) walk up to Carly s
house and ring the bell.

WILL V.O.
So, after three hours of drinking 
what tasted like mouthwash and 
formaldehyde, Simon was ready. 

CARLY opens the door, seeing Simon.

CARLY
Hi.

SIMON
Hi.

WILL
(peeking from behind 
Simon)
Hello.

CARLY
Oh.  Hey, Will.  
(to Simon)
Is he your chaperone?

SIMON
s gonna watch  cool, baby.  He It s
your little brother while we chat.  
You know, about our feelings.

He winks drunkenly at her.  She stares at him, bewildered.The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   25.


CARLY
 though.Best not to call me  baby 

SIMON
Really?

CARLY
Mm.  Come on.  I was just gonna 
grab a drink.  Dylan is in there 
watching TV, Will. 

Will nods and gives Simon a thumbs-up before heading to the 
living room.


WILL and SIMON walk through the night, Simon hunched over and 
humiliated.  Will puts a supportive hand on his shoulder. 

WILL V.O.
Though the night was a complete 
disaster, it actually bonded the 
two of us.  A friendship forged out 
of failure.  We were the golden 
flakes floating in the pool of 
vomit.  And there was comfort 
knowing it would never get any 
worse than this.The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   29.


They stop at the sight of Simon s house...  A sporty red car 
parked in the driveway.

POLLY steps out on the stoop with MR. & MRS. COOPER, looking 
pissed.  

WILL V.O.
...I stand corrected.  


WILL, SIMON, JAY and NEIL saunter through the crowd of 
students, goofing around and shoving each other.  

WILL V.O.
 safe to say public So I think it s
school is going to work out fine.  
I have three friends that seem to 
accept me, and a lifetime of 
superior private education to get 
me out of any jam this environment 
could present.

He waves goodbye to the guys and heads into a CLASSROOM, 
smiling at an ATTRACTIVE GIRL as he passes.  She smiles back.

WILL V.O. (CONT D)
Who knows?  I might even get laid. 

He has a seat in an empty desk, feeling good about himself, 
as the morning announcements start from the PA SPEAKER:

MR. GILBERT (O.S.)
(from PA)
Morning students.  First, I want to 
 had a formal announce that we ve
suit filed by the mother of William 
Mackenzie, regarding his treatment 
by the student body.  

Will looks up, the color draining from his face.

MR. GILBERT (O.S.) (CONT D)
(from PA)
Any student caught bullying him, or 
causing him any emotional or 
physical distress, will be severely 
disciplined by the school and 
possibly outside law enforcement.  
Will is a good boy, with a great big 
heart, and he deserves your respect.

The students all turn and giggle at Will, who is mortified.

WILL V.O.
But then again, I m a fucking idiot.

He slams his head down on the the desk, as we CUE END MUSIC, 
OVER:The Inbetweeners    Brad Copeland 10-22-10   31.



The guys clean the spray-paint off the driveway.  JAY uses a 
pressure washer, but we notice he s used the water stream to 
draw a massive cock in the concrete.  SIMON sees it and 
throws a scrub brush at him.  Jay dodges, accidentally 
turning the washer on the garage door, which blasts off a 
large stripe of paint.  

They all stare, horrified, then start laughing.  WILL turns 
the water hose on all of them, and they get into it -- 
carrying on, completely drenched, not a care in the world. 

PULL BACK to see the brown panel van parked on the curb, the 
man with the mustache smiling warmly at the peaceful sight.
