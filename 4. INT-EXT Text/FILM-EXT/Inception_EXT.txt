A LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and Arthur
steady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES and
pieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA churns. Other
GUESTS wander the massive terraces.
ARTHUR
Saito knows. He's playing with us.
COBB
I can get it here. The
information's in the safe- he
looked right at it when I mentioned
secrets.
Arthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder.
ARTHUR
What's she doing here, Cobb?
Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed,
staring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her.
COBB
You just get to your room. I'll
take care of the rest.
ARTHUR
See that you do. We're here to
work.
Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb.
Looks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIR-
MAL
If I jumped, would I survive?
6.
COBB
With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal,
why are you here?
She turns to look at him. Amused.
MAL
I thought you might be missing
me...
She smiles. He leans in, mesmerized.
COBB
I am. But I can't trust you
anymore.
She stares up at him, inviting.
MAL
So what?
Cobb RAPPELS down the wall, darting past windows. He stops at
a particular one. Gets out a glass cutter-
Suddenly he starts DROPPING-
Cobb JOLTS to a stop 15 ft. lower. He looks up at the bedroom
window. Shakes his head. Starts climbing back.
Cobb runs up the stairs, pulling out the SECOND ENVELOPE-
The BULLET TRAIN speeds through the lush landscape.
Moving over the vast city towards a high rise. A HELICOPTER
thumps into frame, heading for a pad on the roof.
The HELICOPTER sits, ROTORS SPINNING. As Cobb and Arthur
reach the door, it SLIDES OPEN. Cobb steps up into the
leather-padded interior. He freezes.
21.
The helicopter sets down next to a PRIVATE JET.
Ariadne leans against the parapet, overlooking Paris. She
unwraps a sandwich, watching Cobb pull out a pad of GRAPH
PAPER and a PEN. He offers them. She bites her sandwich.
COBB
A test.
29.
ARIADNE
(mouth full)
Aren't you going to tell me
anything?
COBB
Before I describe the job, I have
to know you could do it.
ARIADNE
Why?
COBB
It's not, strictly speaking, legal.
Ariadne raises her eyebrows.
COBB
You have two minutes to draw a maze
that takes me one minute to solve.
Ariadne takes the pad and pen. Cobb looks at his watch.
COBB
Go.
She starts DRAWING LINES on the grid, constructing a maze.
COBB
Stop.
Ariadne hands the pad and pen to Cobb. He glances at the pad,
then, looking her in the eye, TRACES the solution. She is
taken aback. Cobb RIPS off the sheet, hands the pad back.
COBB
Again.
She traces straight lines, CONCENTRATING...
COBB
Stop.
She hands Cobb the pad, a touch pleased. Cobb solves the
puzzle instantly, as before. Her smile falls.
COBB
You'll have to-
She GRABS the pad, frustrated... but this time she FLIPS it
over and starts drawing on the BLANK CARDBOARD of the back.
Cobb watches, surprised. He smiles as he sees that she's
drawing CIRCLES, creating a maze based on concentric rings.
Ariadne hands back the pad, defiant. Cobb takes the pen,
starts the maze. This time he gets stuck. Nods.
30.
COBB
(working the maze)
More like it.
Arthur stops at a warehouse door. Consults a piece of paper.
Cobb and Ariadne sit at an outdoor table.
COBB
They say we only use a fraction of
the true potential of our brains...
but they're talking about when
we're awake. While we dream, the
mind performs wonders.
ARIADNE
Such as?
COBB
How do you imagine a building? You
consciously create each aspect,
puzzling over it in stages... But
sometimes, when your imagination
flies-
ARIADNE
I'm discovering it.
COBB
Exactly. Genuine inspiration.
Cobb leans forwards and draws on the paper table cloth.
COBB
In a dream your mind continuously
does that...
Cobb has drawn a circle made of two arrows.
31.
COBB
It creates and perceives a world
simultaneously. So well that you
don't feel your brain doing the
creating. That's why we can short-
circuit the process...
ARIADNE
How?
COBB
By taking over the creating part.
Cobb draws a straight line between the two arrows.
COBB
This is where you come in. You
build the world of the dream. We
take the subject into that dream,
and let him 111 it with his
subconscious
ARIADNE
But are you trying to fool him that
the dream is actually real life?
COBB
(nods)
While we're in there, We don't want
him to realize he's dreaming.
ARIADNE
How could I ever get enough detail
to Convince him that it's real?
COBB
Our dreams reel real while we're in
them. It's only when we wake up we
realize things were strange,
Ariadne gestures around them-
ARIADNE
But all the textures of real life-
the stone, the fabric. cars...
people... your mind can't create
all this.
COBB
It does. Every time you dream. Let
me ask you a question: You never
remember the beginning of your
dreams, do you? You just turn up in
the middle of what's going on.
32.
ARIADNE
I guess.
COBB
So... how did we end up at this
restaurant?
ARIADNE
We came here from...
Ariadne trails off, confused.
COBB
How did we get here? Where are we?
Ariadne THINKS, unable to remember. A FAINT RUMBLE begins.
ARIADNE
Oh my God. We're dreaming.
Cobb nods. The RUMBLE is BUILDING.
COBB
Stay calm. We're actually asleep in
the workshop. This is your first
lesson in shared dreaming,
remember?
Ariadne looks around, mind REELING. Cobb BRACES-
The restaurant VIOLENTLY FRAGMENTS, EXPLODING AND IMPLODING
PARTICLES OF FURNITURE, WALLS, PEOPLE FLYING AROUND- Ariadne
WONDERS at the MAYHEM WHIRLING around them- Cobb SHIELDS his
head against the debris. She sees him-
ARIADNE
(shouting over noise)
If it's just a dream, why are you
covering your-
Ariadne is WIPED FROM HER SEAT BY A MASSIVE BLAST and we-
CUT TO:
Ariadne walks down the crowded street with Cobb. Cobb looks
around at the street, the cafe, approving.
COBB
It's good. You've got the cafe, the
layout... you forgot the book shop
but pretty much everything else is
here.
Ariadne looks at the passers-by.
ARIADNE
Who are the people?
34.
COBB
They're projections of my
subconscious.
ARIADNE
Yours?
COBB
Sure-you are the dreamer, I am the
subject. My subconscious populates
your world. That's one way we get
at a subject's thoughts-his mind
creates the people, so we can
literally talk to his subconscious.
ARIADNE
How else do you do it?
COBB
Architecture. Build a bank vault or
a jail, something secure, and the
subject's mind will fill it with
information he's trying to protect.
ARIADNE
Then you break in and steal it.
COBB
Exactly.
Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street.
ARIADNE
I love the concrete sense of things-
(stamps foot)
Real weight, you know? I thought a
dream space would be all about the
visual, but it's the feel of
things. Question is, what happens
as you start to mess with
physics...
She CONCENTRATES on the street. The street starts to BEND IN
HALF- the buildings on either side FOLDING IN until they form
the INSIDE OF A CUBE OF CITY, GRAVITY FUNCTIONING
INDEPENDENTLY ON EACH PLANE. Ariadne looks up (or down) at
the people on the opposite city surface. Cobb watches her
excitement.
ARIADNE
It's something, isn't it?
COBB
(quiet)
Yes. It is.
35.
As they walk, Ariadne notices more and more of the
projections STARING at her.
ARIADNE
Why are they looking at me?
COBB
Because you're changing things. My
subconscious feels that someone
else is creating the world. The
more you change things, the quicker
the projections converge on you.
ARIADNE
Converge?
COBB
They feel the foreign nature of the
dreamer, and attack-like white
blood cells fighting an infection.
ARIADNE
They're going to attack us?
COBB
Just you, actually.
They walk along the street to where it joins the next
gravitational plane. They step up onto the different plane
and walk down the street towards a river. As Ariadne
approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leads
Cobb up onto a small jetty. As she concentrates, pillars
emerge and a BRIDGE starts to telescope out from the jetty.
They step onto it as it grows. Cobb is impressed.
COBB
It's beautiful... but if you keep
on changing things...
People crossing the bridge STARE at Ariadne. Several of them
BUMP her shoulder as they pass.
ARIADNE
Mind telling your subconscious to
take it easy?
COBB
That's why it's called subconscious.
I don't control it.
The bridge now spans the Seine. Cobb marvels at it.
COBB
Arched stone, iron pillars...
it's...
36.
Cobb pauses, thinking. Remembering.
INSERT CUT: Mal, hair blowing, turns to Cobb, smiling,
laughing. He smiles back. They are on the same bridge.
COBB
I know this bridge. This place is
real-
(serious)
You didn't imagine it, you
remembered it...
ARIADNE
(nods)
I cross it every day on my way to
the college.
COBB
Never recreate places from your
memory. Always imagine new places.
ARIADNE
You have to draw from what you know-
COBB
(tense)
Use pieces-a streetlamp,
phonebooths, a type of brick-not
whole areas.
Several people around them ECHO Cobb's attitude...
ARIADNE
Why not?
COBB
Because building dreams out of your
own memories is the surest way to
lose your grip on what's real and
what's a dream.
ARIADNE
Did that happen to you?
Cobb says nothing. He stands there, starinq at Ariadne.
PEOPLE around her stop and look at her, hostile.
COBB
Look, this isn't about me-
Cobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to him-
ARIADNE
Is that why you need me to build
your dreams?
37.
A passerby GRABS Ariadne's shoulder-
COBB
Leave her alone-
More of the crowd join in, PULLING at Ariadne, holding her
arms open- Cobb PULLS people off- the crowd PUSHES him away-
Cobb sees someone WALKING PURPOSEFULLY through the crowd
towards the helpless, Ariadne- it is Mal. She approaches with
even strides- Ariadne stares at her, uneasy.
ARIADNE
Wake me up, Cobb.
As Mal walks, she pulls out a LARGE KNIFE-
COBB
Mal, no!
ARIADNE
Wake me up!
Ariadne SCREAMS as Mal LUNGES at her with the knife and we-
CUT TO:
A ramshackle balcony overlooking a bust street. Eames pours.
COBB
Inception.
Eames's glass stops halfway to his mouth.
COBB
Don't bother telling me it's
impossible.
EAMES
It's perfectly possible. Just
bloody difficult.
COBB
That's what I keep saying to
Arthur.
42.
EAMES
Arthur? You're still working with
that stick-in-the-mud?
COBB
He's a good point man.
EAMES
The best. But he has no
imagination. If you're going to
perform inception, you need
imagination.
COBB
You've done it before?
EAMES
Yeas and no. We tried it. Got the
idea in place, but it didn't take.
COBB
You didn't plant it deep enough?
EAMES
It's not just about depth. You need
the simplest version of the idea-
the one that will grow naturally in
the subject's mind. Subtle art.
COBB
That's why I'm here.
EAMES
What's the idea you need to plant?
COBB
We want the heir to a major
corporation to break up his
father's empire.
EAMES
See, right there you've got various
political motivations, anti-
monopolistic sentiment and so
forth. But all that stuff's at the
mercy of the subject's prejudice-
you have to go to the basic.
COBB
Which is?
EAMES
The relationship with the father.
(downs drink)
Do you have a chemist?
43.
Cobb shakes his head.
EAMES
There's a man here. Yusuf. He
formulates his own versions of the
compounds.
COBB
Let's go see him.
EAMES
Once you've lost your tail.
(Cobb reacts)
Back by the bar, blue tie. Came in
about two minutes after we did.
COBB
Cobol Engineering?
EAMES
They pretty much own Mombasa.
Cobb glances over the balcony.
COBB
Run interference. We'll meet
downstairs in half an hour.
EAMES
Back here?
COBB
Last place they'd expect.
Eames downs his drink. Rises. Walks over to the Businessman.
EAMES
Freddy!
The Businessman looks up, awkward.
EAMES
Freddy Simmonds, it is you!
Cobb nonchalantly SLIPS over the balcony DROPPING HARD into
the midst of the crowd on the street below.
EAMES
(looks harder)
Oh. No, it isn't.
Cobb stands up, PUSHES into the crowd- faces PEER at him- he
moves, trying to blend- TURNS- a SECOND BUSINESS MAN is
there.
44.
COBB
(disarming smile)
Yes?
SECOND BUSINESSMAN
We need to-
Cobb HEAD BUTTS the Second Businessman, PUSHES past him-
The First Businessman races out of the bar, sees Cobb's wake,
DIVES after him- Cobb RACES headlong through tight
passageways, WEAVING through or KNOCKING into the locals...
He steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the tables...
the First Businessman enters, spots him. An AFRICAN MAN gets
in Cobb's face, jabbering at him in Swahili- Cobb considers
his options... the First Businessman DRAWS A GUN- Cobb bolts,
steps up on a table and out an open window, SCRAMBLING into
the alley outside...
Cobb LOOKS left, right... CUTS LEFT into a narrow, CROWDED
alley- the alley NARROWS TO A DEAD END. Faces in the CROWD
start to watch Cobb- PEOPLE start to SURROUND him- Cobb looks
back the way he came- the two Businessmen are there, GUNS
DRAWN-
Cobb sees a SMALL GAP between the buildings at the narrow end-
he THROWS himself into it- gets STUCK HALFWAY...
The crowd bears down, GRABBING for him as Cobb struggles to
SQUEEZE HIMSELF through the gap... Cobb's moving INCHES as
his pursuers gain YARDS... the Crowd is upon him... he BURSTS
FREE. TUMBLING onto the next street, ROLLING out of sight.
Cobb Jumps to his feet- in a market square. TWO MORE
BUSINESSMEN move towards him. Cobb BOLTS but a CAR SKIDS UP,
BLOCKS HIS PATH- the door opens- SAITO IS IN THE BACK.
SAITO
Care for a lift, Mr. Cobb?
COBB
(jumping in)
What brings you to Mombasa, Mr.
Saito?
SAITO
I have to protect my investment.
Eames stands on the pavement. The car pulls up. Cobb beckons
from the rear window. Eames looks at Saito. Back to Cobb.
EAMES
This is your idea of losing a tail?
45.
COBB
(shrugs)
Different tail.
Saito deposits a FILE in front of Cobb: PHOTOS, DOCUMENTS. As
Cobb runs through them, he passes them to Eames.
SAITO
Robert Fischer, 32. Heir to the
Fischer Morrow energy conglomerate.
He's spent his whole life being
groomed as successor-breaking up
his father's empire will take a
radical shift in his thinking.
COBB
What's your problem with Fischer?
SAITO
That's not your concern.
48.
COBB
This isn't the usual corporate
espionage, Mr. Saito. This is
inception. The seed of the idea we
plant will grow in this man's mind.
It'll change him. It might even
come to define him.
Saito looks at Cobb.
SAITO
My sources suggest you might not
have always been so cautious.
COBB
Then you need new sources, Mr.
Saito.
Saito considers Cobb. Shrugs.
SAITO
Fischer Morrow has the regulators
in their pockets. We're the last
company standing between them and
total energy dominance and we can
no longer compete. Soon they'll
control the energy supply of half
the world. They'll be able to
blackmail governments, dictate
policy. In effect, they become a
new superpower. The world needs
Robert Fischer to change his mind.
EAMES
That's where we come in. How's
Robert Fischer's relationship to
his father?
SAITO
Rumor is the relationship is
complicated.
COBB
We'll need more than rumor, Mr.
Saito.
Eames picks up a photo: a distinguished executive (68).
EAMES
Can you get me access to him?
Browning. Fischer senior's right-
hand man. Fischer junior's
godfather.
49.
SAITO
It should be possible. If you can
get the right references.
EAMES
References are something of a
specialty for me, Mr. Saito.
Eames leads Cobb and Saito down uneven steps to a doorway.
CLOSE ON Cobb's face as he lies, EYES CLOSED, cheek pressed
to a METAL RAIL- THE SOUND OF THE TRAIN IS DEAFENING- Cobb is
BREATHING, BREATHING, BREATHING, and we-
CUT TO:
The team are in the middle of a DESERTED intersection.
Ariadne is showing Yusuf aspects of the geography.
EAMES
We could split the idea into
emotional triggers, and use one on
each level.
COBB
How do you mean?
EAMES
On the top level, we open up his
relationship with his father....
Say: "I WILL NOT FOLLOW IN MY
FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS." Next level
down we've accessed his ambition
and self-esteem. We feed him: "I
WILL CREATE SOMETHING MYSELF."
Then, the bottom level, we bring
out the emotional big guns...
COBB
"MY FATHER DOESN'T WANT ME TO BE
HIM."
EAMES
That could do it.
ARTHUR
How do you produce these emotional
triggers?
59.
EAMES
I forge each emotional concept in
the style and manner of Peter
Browning, a key figure in Fischer's
emotional life.
Two AFRICAN PEDESTRIANS wander into view.
ARTHUR
Are those yours?
Eames shakes his head. Cobb turns to Yusuf.
ARTHUR
Yusuf?
YUSUF
Yup. Sorry.
COBB
Suppress them. We don't bring our
own projections into the dream-we
let Fischer's subconscious supply
the people.
EAMES
Saito, when do I get to see
Browning?
SAITO
You fly out to Sydney on Tuesday.
We've arranged for you to spend
several days...
Fischer steps out of a black town car and walks across the
tarmac towards a GULF STREAM JET, accompanied by two aides.
COBB (V.O.)
Surely he flies private?
SAITO (V.O.)
Not if there were unexpected
maintenance with his plane.
Fischer is met at the steps by a DISTRAUGHT FLIGHT OFFICER.
The 747 HURTLES down the runway.
The great plane SOARS through a burning cloudscape.
Yusuf stands on the corner, silver briefcase in hand, collar
turned up against the rain. He reaches for the door.
75.
Cobb pulls out into the heavy traffic. He weaves around
several cars before lining up behind a YELLOW CAB.
COBB
Brace yourselves.
Cobb hits the gas- REAR ENDS the cab with a CRUNCH. The
CABDRIVER gets out, fuming. Heads to Cobb's window-
CABDRIVER
Hey, asshole! Why don't you try
driving without your thumb up-
He sees the SILENCED PISTOL Cobb is holding at his belly.
COBB
Walk away.
The Cabdriver backs off. Arthur climbs into the cab. Both
cars pull away.
Arthur SLOWS in front of the TRAIN STATION, peering at the
pedes pedestrians. He SPOTS Fischer, lights the cab's sign.
Fischer FLAGS him down. Fischer JUMPS into the back, brushing
rain from his shoulders.
76.
FISCHER
Third and Market. Snappy.
Eames JUMPS in from the other side.
FISCHER
What're you doing?
EAMES
Sorry, I thought it was free. Maybe
we could share.
FISCHER
Maybe not.
Saito gets into the front passenger seat. Pointing a gun.
FISCHER
Great.
Arthur pulls away. Fischer pulls out his wallet and tosses it
at Eames.
FISCHER
(contemptuous)
There's 500 dollars in there. And
the wallet's worth more than that.
For that you ought to at least drop
me at my stop.
Eames smiles at this.
EAMES
I'm afraid-
A SHOT SHATTERS the window by Eames's head- another SHOT
IMPACTS by Saito-
EAMES
Get us out of here!
Arthur hits the gas, but a BLACK S.U.V. SKIDS sideways in
front, BLOCKING the path-
A BLOCK BEHIND- Cobb is at a light. ARIADNE is getting in the
front. Cobb has HEARD the GUNFIRE-
COBB
Come on!-
Cobb looks ahead to the AMBUSH, hits the gas- the sedan
ROCKETS forwards... but BAM- A FREIGHT TRAIN CLIPS THE FRONT
OF THE SEDAN, SHOVING IT SIDEWAYS AS AN ENDLESS TRAIN BARRELS
PAST, A WALL BETWEEN COBB AND THE AMBUSH-
77.
A SECOND S.U.V. is behind the cab- PLAIN CLOTHES SECURITY MEN
advance through the traffic, weapons trained on the cab.
Bullets RIP into the cab as Eames throws himself on top of
Fischer, PULLING a SACK over his head-
Inside the sedan, Ariadne watches the train passing-
ARIADNE
This wasn't in the design-
Cobb BACKS UP, SPINS around, heading for the tail of the
train-
A Security Man emerges from the front S.U.V. carrying an
AUTOMATIC RIFLE- he steps towards the cab through the rain,
raises his weapon and BLASTS THE CAB'S WINDSCREEN-
Cobb clears the end of the train, and SKIDS across the tracks-
Arthur CROUCHES down- PUSHES the accelerator with his HAND-
YANKS the wheel- FLYING BLIND. The cab NAILS the Security
Man, CRUNCHING into the front S.U.V.-
Cobb SMASHES his car into the rear S.U.V., creating a GAP-
Arthur YANKS the transmission and REVERSES- SCRAPING through
the gap- Security Men DIVE out of the way- Arthur throws a
ragged J-turn to head down a SIDE STREET- Cobb follows in the
other car. Rain whips across Arthur's face as he BREATHES-
ARTHUR
Everybody okay? Saito?
Arthur looks at Saito. Saito's hand is at his belly. Covered
in BLOOD.
The sedan and cab pull into the side entrance- Eames jumps
out- PULLS the shutter down behind them-
Cobb looks out the window: Mal sits on the ledge of the
opposite window. HAIR BLOWING. Feet dangling over the
dizzyingly high atrium. She smiles.
MAL
Join me.
COBB
Mal, come back inside.
MAL
No. I'm going to jump. And you're
coming with me.
COBB
No, I'm not. This is real-if you
jump, you're not going to wake up,
you're going to die. Let's go back
inside and talk about this, please.
MAL
We've talked enough.
She KICKS off a shoe and watches it DROP.
MAL
Come out onto the ledge or I'll
jump right now.
She means it. Cobb swings his legs out, sitting on the ledge
opposite is wife. He looks down at the drop.
MAL
I'm asking you to take a leap of
faith.
COBB
I can't do that, Mal. I can't leave
our children.
MAL
If I go without you, they'll take
them away, anyway.
COBB
What do you mean?
91.
MAL
I filed a letter with our attorney.
Explaining how I'm fearful for my
safety, how you've threatened to
kill me...
Cobb looks back at the wrecked hotel suite, PANICKING...
MAL (CONT'D)
I love you, Dom. I've freed you
from the guilt of choosing to leave
them. We're going home to our real
children.
COBB
Out children are here, Mal.
Mal CLOSES HER EYES. Cobb looks for some way to reach her...
MAL
You're waiting for a train...
COBB
NO! MAL, NO, I CAN'T!
MAL
A train that will take you far
away...
COBB
DON'T DO THIS!
MAL
You know where you hope this train
will take you, you can't know for
sure...
COBB
DON'T!
MAL
But it doesn't matter...
COBB
NO!
MAL
Because you'll be together...
Mal SLIPS FORWARD INTO SPACE. Cobb SCREAMS after her. Then
tries to bury his face in the wall...
The van pulls out into the rain-drenched streets. Arthur
opens the mechanism case and hands out tubes-
COBB
Shifting Fischer's antipathy from
his father onto Browning should
work.
EAMES
We need the imagery, the words...
ARIADNE
So you destroy his one positive
relationship?
COBB
No. We repair his relationship with
his father and expose his
godfather's true nature.
EAMES
Hell, we should be charging Fischer
as much as Saito.
97.
ARTHUR
What about his security? It's going
to get worse as we go deeper.
COBB
We bring in Mr. Charles.
ARTHUR
No.
EAMES
Who's Mr. Charles?
ARTHUR
A bad idea.
COBB
Arthur, the second we approach
Fischer in that hotel, they're
gonna mow us down-we run with Mr.
Charles like on the Stein job.
EAMES
So you've done it before?
ARTHUR
Sure. But it didn't work. The
subject realized he was dreaming
and his subconscious tore us to
pieces.
Eames takes this in.
EAMES
You learned a lot, though. Right?
COBB
(to Eames)
I'll need a decoy.
EAMES
No problem. How about a pretty
young lady I've used before?
COBB
Fine-
Cobb looks back: a second S.U.V. pulls out, tailing them.
COBB (CONT'D)
(to Yusuf)
I know you've got to stay ahead of
them, but drive with kid gloves,
okay? The world down there is going
to be very unstable-
98.
ARTHUR
And don't make the jump too soon-
that kick is our only way back, we
have to be ready to catch it-
YUSUF
I'll use the music to let you know
when it's coming, but the rest is
up to you.
Arthur puts the mechanism onto the front seat.
YUSUF (CONT'D)
Everyone ready?
Nods all round.
YUSUF (CONT'D)
Sweet dreams-
Yusuf hits a button and we-
CUT TO:
Yusuf FIGHTS the wheel as the van CUTS DOWN AN ALLEY, BUMPING
OVER POTHOLES and SMASHING TRASH CANS aside- THREE S.U.V.s IN
FURIOUS PURSUIT. Yusuf looks in the rear view mirror,
FRUSTRATED. He checks his WATCH, then checks the back: the
SLEEPERS SHAKE with the impact and we-
CUT TO:
GUNSHOTS BLAST out the rear and side windows of the van- a
Security Man is leaning out of the lead S.U.V. With a SHOTGUN-
WIND AND RAIN RIP THROUGH THE VAN- in the back, ARTHUR'S
SLEEPING FACE IS WHIPPED BY THE SPRAY, AND WE-
CUT TO:
At the end of the alley-
Yusuf THROWS the van into a HARD
RIGHT TURN- we move into
EXTREME SLOW MOTION... THE SLEEPERS
IN THE BACK ARE DRAWN TO
ONE SIDE OF THE VAN BY THE
CENTRIFUGAL FORCE... and
we-
CUT TO:
Yusuf STRAIGHTENS UP the van, RACING down the street,
swerving through traffic and we-
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON Cobb's face, staring. Fixed.
ARIADNE (O.S.)
Cobb? Cobb?
Ariadne is beside him. They stand on a cliff, dressed in
white snowsuits, carrying white-painted weapons like WWII
commandos. Cobb checks his SNIPER RIFLE, examines their
objective: a massive FORTIFIED MEDICAL FACILITY a mile below.
ARIADNE
What's down there?
COBB
Hopefully, the truth we want
Fischer to learn.
ARIADNE
I meant what's down there for you?
Cobb turns to her. Eames, Saito and Fischer arrive, SKIING
down from the hill above. Cobb pulls Eames out of Fischer's
earshot.
COBB
You're the dreamer. I need you to
draw the security away from the
complex.
113.
EAMES
Then who guides Fischer in? You?
COBB
If I know the route... we could be
compromised.
Eames looks as Cobb, uneasy. Ariadne comes over.
ARIADNE
I designed the place.
COBB
No. You're with me.
SAITO (O.S.)
I could do it.
They turn to Saito. Saito shrugs at Eames. Eames smiles.
COBB
Eames, brief Saito on the route
into the complex. What we're
looking for is going to be in the
most heavily fortified section.
That north tower.
Cobb moves to Fischer. Saito COUGHS. SPITS. Eames sees BLOOD
on the snow. Looks at Saito.
COBB
Mr. Fischer, you're going in with
Mr. Saito.
FISCHER
You're not coming in?
COBB
You have to do this on your own.
You have to get in there, break
into your godfather's mind and find
out the truth about your father.
Cobb taps Fischer's radio mike.
COBB
Keep this live at all times. I'll
be listening in, covering you.
(holds up the sniper
rifle)
The windows on the upper floors are
big enough that I can cover you
from that south tower.
114.
Cobb slips into his skis, shoulders his rifle.
CUT TO:
A GUNSHOT slams into the van as Yusuf DRIVES- he glances back
to see a MOTORCYCLE pulling up behind him, the REAR PASSENGER
FIRING A SHOTGUN- the bike pulls alongside Yusuf's window as
the passenger RELOADS- Yusuf YANKS the wheel TOWARDS the
bike, bringing the shotgun barrel into the cab so he can GRAB
it, spin the wheel back- PULLING the passenger from the back
of the bike... Yusuf turns a corner, heading into a disused
MARKET-
The bike crosses behind the van, catching up again as the
driver pulls a handgun and starts BLASTING. Up ahead, an
S.U.V. sits in a side road, lining up to head off the van-
the SECURITY MAN driving the S.U.V. guns it, as the bike
creeps up on the other side of the van- Yusuf HITS THE
BRAKES, forcing the bike out into the path of the S.U.V.,
tossing the rider like a rag doll-
Heading out of the market, the van races onto a FREEWAY ON
RAMP, approaching the BRIDGE. An S.U.V. SMASHES into the
van's side, FORCING it up against a CRASH BARRIER... the van
starts to SLOWLY TILT OVER THE BARRIER as the S.U.V. PUSHES-
CUT TO:
SLEEPING ARTHUR BOUNCES around as the van TILTS, SCRAPING
along the barrier- the van CLEARS THE END OF THE BARRIER AND
ROLLS DOWN THE EMBANKMENT, and we-
CUT TO:
The van SETTLES with a thump. Yusuf BREATHES hard. Then
SMILES as he realizes he is in one piece. A RINGING BELL up
ahead makes him look up to the bridge, where the barriers are
starting to come down. Yusuf checks his watch-
YUSUF
Bugger.
Yusuf hits the gas, heading for the bridge. An S.U.V. lines
up behind him, trying to catch up before the van crosses the
barrier onto the bridge-
The van JUST MAKES IT- the S.U.V. behind RIPS its read axle
off, SCRAPING to a halt on the rising section. The Security
Man inside starts FIRING on the van...
Eames SKIS down within sight of the hospital complex. He
reaches into his pack and lets off a FLARE.
116.
Security Men on the ramparts spot the flare and send PATROLS
out on skis and SNOWMOBILES to investigate.
Eames watches them close in, then launches himself down the
mountain, STREAKING across the icy slope, and we-
CUT TO:
Yusuf PULLS FORWARD, looking over his shoulder to line up a
BACKWARDS RUN at the edge. He DUCKS as vicious FIRE from the
S.U.V. HAMMERS the vehicle. He looks at his watch. The SECOND
HAND TICKING SLOWLY...
YUSUF
Sod it. I hope your ready.
He grabs an MP3 player and reaches into the back to place
HEADPHONES on sleeping Arthur's head. As he does so, he
notices Saito's bandage BLEEDING THROUGH. Yusuf hits PLAY-
Edith Piaf's "Non, je ne regrette rien" starts up and we-
CUT TO:
Cobb and Ariadne make their way down towards the complex.
EAMES (OVER RADIO)
Cobb? Are you hearing that?
Cobb listens. The wind sounds unusually LOW.
Eames is hidden at the base of some trees, whispering as a
patrol passes beneath his position.
117.
EAMES
I noticed it twenty minutes ago-at
first I thought it was just wind...
Cobb is listening intently. The "wind" changes pitch.
COBB
No, it's music. Dammit.
EAMES (OVER RADIO)
What do we do?
COBB
We move fast. Saito, did you copy?
Saito and Fischer CLIMB down a CLIFF FACE above the complex-
SAITO
We're going as fast as we can.
Ariadne looks at Cobb, concerned.
ARIADNE
How long do we have?
COBB
Yusuf's about ten seconds from the
jump, which gives Arthur about
three minutes, which gives us about-
ARIADNE
Sixty minutes.
COBB
The route you gave them, can they
do it in under an hour?
ARIADNE
I don't think so. They've still got
to climb down to the middle
terrace.
COBB
They need a new route-a direct
route.
ARIADNE
The building's designed as a
labyrinth.
118.
COBB
There must be access routes that
cut through the maze.
(into radio)
Eames?
Eames cannot answer- he SLALOMS through the forest, Sub-
security in hot pursuit, bullets smashing into the trunks...
Cobb turns to Ariadne.
COBB
Did Eames add any features?
ARIADNE
Yes.
COBB
What did he add?
Ariadne looks at Cobb.
ARIADNE
I shouldn't tell you. If Mal-
COBB
There's no time-what did he add?
ARIADNE
Utility closets, trap doors...
COBB
What about service features? Did he
add any large pipes or-
ARIADNE
Ducts. He added an air duct system-
it doesn't follow the maze. They
can use it to go straight from the
outer walls to the upper tower.
COBB
Explain it to them.
ARIADNE
(into radio)
Saito?
Saito is using a hammer to tap in a belay.
119.
SAITO
Go ahead.
And we-
CUT TO:
Yusuf looks at the Security Man in the S.U.V., gives him the
finger and hits the GAS- RACING BACKWARDS at the barrier...
and we-
CUT TO:
In SLOW MOTION- the van SMASHES THROUGH THE CONCRETE BARRIER-
and we-
CUT TO:
A MASSIVE RUMBLE prompts Cobb to look across the valley-
Eames shoots out of the trees, then FALLS to the snow as he
sees a great CRACKING up ahead- the SLOPE IS FALLING AWAY IN
AN AVALANCHE-
120.
Saito hears the RUMBLE above them. He looks down, Fischer is
below, near the bottom of the sheer face-
SAITO
Look out!
Saito CUTS the rope- they FALL- HIT the icy face and SLIDE
down the slope, clearing the path of the avalanche- and we-
CUT TO:
In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van emerges from the concrete
balustrade and starts FALLING- and we-
CUT TO:
Cobb watches the avalanche cloud slide past the complex.
ARIADNE
What was that?
COBB
The kick.
EAMES (OVER RADIO)
Cobb? Did we miss it?
COBB
Yeah, we missed it.
Eames is lying on the snow.
EAMES
What the hell do we do now?
COBB (OVER RADIO)
Finish the job before the next
kick.
121.
EAMES
What next kick?
Cobb looks at Ariadne as he talks into the radio.
COBB
When the van hits the water. I
figure Arthur's got a couple
minutes and we've got about twenty.
Cobb and Ariadne MOVE towards the base of the complex.
Saito and Fischer RUN around the base of the building. They
find a large EXHAUST PORT. Lay a charge on the GRILL. They
blow the charge. Climb into the open vent.
In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van seems SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR
TEN STORIES ABOVE THE RIVER... and we-
CUT TO:
Cobb GRABS a Security Guard from behind, strangling him
unconscious. He beckons to Ariadne, covering her as she runs
towards him. They enter the base of the south tower.
Eames is watching the patrols HEAD BACK towards the complex.
EAMES
They're heading your way. Like they
know something.
Eames TAKES OFF towards the base of the complex. And we=
CUT TO:
Eames is setting MINES along the LOWEST WALL of the
structure. He moves carefully-there is a SHEER DROP below the
wall...
124.
In EXTREME SLOW MOTION, the van CREEPS DOWNWARDS, still high
above the river... and we-
CUT TO:
Ariadne lies in the SURF, STARING up at a CLOUDLESS SKY. A
tremendous BOOM prompts her to look around her- URBAN
BUILDINGS PILED right down to the water. The buildings are
DECAYING, falling into the ocean like a GLACIER calving. Cobb
WADES towards her through the shallow water. Ariadne looks up
at the crumbling city around them.
ARIADNE
This is your world?
128.
COBB
It was. And this is where she'll
be.
And we-
CUT TO:
Eames races along the upper terrace dodging fire- BULLETS
SHATTER a window behind him and we move into SLOW MOTION, the
glass CASCADING GENTLY and we-
DISSOLVE TO:
Cobb and Ariadne climb out of the waves, full speed. They
move into the shadow of the tall, crumbling buildings. The
streets are eerily DESERTED. As they move further in, the
buildings become NEWER, different. Ariadne marvels at the
extraordinary collection of buildings- every architectural
style imaginable in waves of FAILED UTOPIAS.
ARIADNE
You built all this?
COBB
We both did.
129.
ARIADNE
It's incredible.
COBB
We built for years. Then, when that
got stale, we started in on the
memories.
A child's SHOUT echoes through the deserted canyons,
prompting Cobb to look down a side street: a LITTLE BLONDE
BOY crouched, his back to us. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the
boy, and, as Cobb turns down the street, they run off.
Cobb and Ariadne emerge into a peculiar SQUARE lined with an
eclectic mix of buildings, from APARTMENT BLOCKS to HOUSES.
COBB
This is our neighborhood.
ARIADNE
(confused)
From what city?
COBB
No. Our neighborhood.
(pointing)
That was our first apartment...
then we moved to that building...
we got that small house when Mal
became pregnant.
ARIADNE
You reconstructed them all from
memory?
COBB
We had time.
Cobb pauses in front of a French country house. Staring.
ARIADNE
What's that?
COBB
The house Mal grew up in.
ARIADNE
Will she be in there?
COBB
No. Come on-
Cobb leads Ariadne to the entrance of a glass skyscraper.
130.
Ariadne looks up as a LARGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING RIPS across the
sky... she looks down to see Fischer, BOUND AND BLOODY, lying
below the rail.
ARIADNE
He's here. And it's time. But you
have to come with us.
Another massive lightning strike flickers across the sky-
ARIADNE
Cobb, I'm not going to let you lose
yourself in here! You have to get
back to your children!
COBB
Send Fischer, I have to stay-
ARIADNE
You can't stay here to be with her-
Cobb turns from Mal. Looks at Ariadne.
COBB
I'm not. Saito is dead by now. That
means he's here. I have to stay
here and find him.
Ariadne removes Fischer's gag- pulls him up, onto the rail.
Cobb looks back at Mal.
COBB
I can't stay here to be with her
because she's not real.
Mal looks at Cobb, furious.
MAL
Not real? I'm the only thing you do
believe in anymore. Here-doesn't
this feel real, Dom?
She STABS him in the chest- Cobb WHEEZES- GASPING, looking at
Mal-
139.
COBB
I wish you were. But I couldn't
make you real. I'm not capable of
imagining you in all your
complexity and... perfection. As
you really were. You're the best I
can do. And you're not real.
Mal pulls the knife and moves to STRIKE again-
ARIADNE
No!
A SHOT rings out, Mal GRABS her shoulder- Cobb turns to
Ariadne, who is pointing Cobb's gun.
COBB
What're you doing?
ARIADNE
Improvising.
She KICKS Fischer off the roof- AIMS again at Mal-
Fischer DROPS as the sky LIGHTS UP WITH ELECTRICITY- Fischer
SCREAMS, then GASPS, no longer falling, and we are-
Ariadne takes aim at Mal-
COBB
No!
Cobb holds Ariadne's gaze. She lowers the gun. And we-
CUT TO:
140.
Eames GRABS the detonator- then moves to the door of the
strongroom...
CUT TO:
A line of EXPLOSIONS RIPS ALONG THE LOWER WALL... the ENTIRE
BUILDING STARTS TO SLIDE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN-
A FIERCE WIND starts HOWLING through the house as the sky
outside DARKENS. Cobb shields Mal against the blast- looks up
at Ariadne, who HOLDS the railing, FIGHTING the wind-
COBB
That's the kick-you have to go!
ARIADNE
You're coming!
COBB
No, I'm not. I'm staying here to
find Saito.
(turns to Mal)
And to say goodbye.
Ariadne loosens her grip on the railing...
ARIADNE
Don't lose yourself. Find Saito.
And bring him back.
COBB
I will.
Ariadne lets the wind pull her off the edge- FALLING- and we-
Cobb holds Mal in his arms. The wind DIES...
MAL
We'd be together forever. You
promised me.
COBB
I know. But we can't. And I'm
sorry.
MAL
You remember when you asked me to
marry you? You said you dreamt that
we'd grow old together.
COBB
And we did...
Mal looks at Cobb... thinking. Remembering.
INSERT CUT: TWO ELDERLY PEOPLE (MAL AND COBB) WALK THROUGH
LIMBO... ACROSS A WASTELAND... TWO ELDERLY HANDS CLUTCH EACH
OTHER AS THEY LIE DOWN ON THE RAILROAD TRACK...
COBB
I miss you more than I can bear...
but we had our time together. And
now I have to let go...
She nods, weakly. Cobb holds Mal as her eyes close...
DYING... and we-
THE WATER, THE VAN CRUNCHING WITH THE IMPACT- WATER CRASHING
THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOWS FLOODING THE INTERIOR...
Fischer's EYES OPEN, PANICKING- he UNBUCKLES HIMSELF, pushes
out of the broken window- STOPS, goes back to UNBUCKLE
Browning and DRAG him out.
143.
Fischer breaks the surface with Browning, who COUGHS and
GASPS. He starts PULLING for the near bank, struggling
through the rain-impacted water-
Fischer turns Browning/Eames over. They lie there, exhausted.
BROWNING
I'm sorry, Robert.
Fischer stares at the rain on the water.
FISCHER
The will means that Dad wanted me
to be my own man, not live for him.
(turns to Browning) )
And I'm going to, Uncle Peter.
Browning nods. Wipes the rain from his face. In the puddle
beside them, the reflection is not Browning, but Eames.
Arthur sits on the riverbank, breathing heavily.
ARTHUR
What happened?
ARIADNE
Cobb stayed.
ARTHUR
With Mal?
ARIADNE
No. To find Saito.
Arthur looks out at the water below the bridge.
ARTHUR
He'll be lost...
ARIADNE
No. He'll be alright.
144.
And we-
CUT TO:
The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand.
As the Japanese Security Guard turns him onto his back, we
realize that this is Cobb- OLDER. WEARY. TRAVELLED...
