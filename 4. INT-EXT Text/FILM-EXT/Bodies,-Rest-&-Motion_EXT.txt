A beautiful vista -- cacti and sage dot the landscape as it
rises to mountains in the distance.
END CREDITS
THE CAMERA PANS revealing an island of modern culture --
malls and more malls, parking lots, and fast food franchises.
FADE IN TITLE: ENFIELD, ARIZONA
A brown Pinto pulls out of a parking lot and into rush hour
traffic.
A tiny well-kept Spanish style home in lower middle class
residential section.
Sid's pick-up truck is facing her across the intersection.
It slowly pulls up beside her and stops.
He smiles and gives a little wave of his hand.
Without knowing why, she smiles and waves back.
BETH
(sweetly but firmly)
Good-bye.
She drives away. Sid stares after her.
CUT TO:
Nick and Beth are standing in the lawn, lit by the glow of
the porch lamp.
Both sides of the street are lined with nearly identical
tiny faux Spanish houses.
BETH
G'night.
THE FRONT DOORWAY
Carol waves.
CAROL
G'night.
ANOTHER ANGLE INCLUDING NICK, BETH, AND CAROL
NICK
(calling out)
Pizza Hut, tomorrow?
CAROL
Okay.
(to Beth)
I've got the short shift -- you want
me to come over, help pack?
BETH
Great... I'm really sorry we didn't
tell you sooner. He just decided.
CAROL
smiles to herself, a trace of sadness in her eyes.
CAROL
I understand.
She shuts the door.
NICK AND BETH
She starts to walk across the lawn. She stops and stares at
Nick, who's staring out into the night, oblivious to her.
BETH
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.
He turns and looks at her.
NICK
What's your problem?
BETH
I haven't got a problem.
NICK
Okay.
He walks up to her and past her -- when she doesn't fall
into step, he stops.
NICK
You agreed to try Billings.
BETH
I know.
(in Nick's words)
Billings, Montana. City of the future.
NICK
Yeah and I read that a while ago --
so the future's probably already
there.
She smiles and shakes her head.
NICK
(defensively)
It's not like you're leaving anything
behind. A good job or something.
BETH
Just some friends.
He puts his arms around her waist from behind, and nestles
her against his body.
NICK
You'll make new friends.
BETH
I know.
(after a beat)
I'm not eight years old. I know I'll
make new friends.
NICK
Then what is it?
She pulls away from him and starts walking to the house next
door. He falls into step with her.
BETH
(uncomfortably)
I, umm... I... It embarrasses me.
When you talk about something with
Carol that happened before me. She's
my best friend. It embarrasses me
that you used to live with her.
NICK
That was years ago.
BETH
Three years.
NICK
That's right.
BETH
I know...
NICK
And we're moving. She won't be your
best friend anymore.
They arrive at their front door. Beth takes out her keys.
Nick stops her hand and kisses her. She kisses him back.
NICK
Living with someone isn't such a big
deal.
She nods and looks to the lock.
NICK
Anyway... I live with you now.
Beth looks to Nick. He stares out at the night.
CUT TO:
CLOSE-UP: COFFEE-MAKER
The coffee-maker clock hits nine o'clock. The coffee maker
clicks on with a rattle. Steam starts to spew out.
The coffee-maker makes horrible gurgling sounds.
Beth is holding a donut and her coffee mug. Nick tosses his
jacket into the front seat of his old sedan.
NICK
I might do it.
BETH
I say do it.
(after a beat)
Sears can afford to give you a bonus.
NICK
Maybe they are.
BETH
What do you mean?
NICK
Maybe when I get my check today,
there'll be a bonus in it.
BETH
(evenly)
Nick. They fired you.
NICK
Yeah...
BETH
(flatly)
There's no bonus.
NICK
Yeah... That's true.
(shaking his head)
And I sold a lot of teevees for
them...
Beth sips her coffee, waiting for Nick to decide.
BETH
(calmly)
You should take a t.v.
Nick looks at his watch.
NICK
I should go.
(sarcastically)
Don't wanna be late on my last day.
He kisses Beth, surprising her. He presses against her. He
takes the donut from her hand and takes a bite.
Beth kisses Nick, his mouth still full of donut.
BETH
Mmmmm...
He kisses her fully, then breaks the kiss.
NICK
I gotta go.
CUT TO:
About hundred cars dot the vast parking lot.
Nick swings into a parking spot and gets out of the car. He
tosses his jacket on the roof and crouches, tieing his necktie
using the car's outside mirror.
MAN'S VOICE
You livin' in your car or what?
NICK'S POV - IN THE MIRROR
CHIP, a big redheaded guy in his late thirties, wearing a
jacket and tie, is grinning at the crouched Nick. Nick's
reflection grins back.
NICK
Just waiting for the last second to
put on the noose.
(tightening the tie)
So Chip -- what's new?
NICK AND CHIP
Nick straightens up and grabs his jacket. They start walking
toward the mall.
CHIP
Nothing much.
(broaching the subject)
I heard you're leaving.
NICK
Yeah. I'm outta here.
They approach the employees entrance.
CHIP
They can you?
NICK
That's what they think.
CHIP
Yeah?
NICK
I was gonna quit anyway -- this way
I get unemployment.
CHIP
Good deal.
Nick opens the door.
NICK
Yeah... recession insurance...
(Chip enters)
This way I'm not stuck waiting around
for the lay-offs to start.
Nick follows Chip in.
CHIP
(a hint of panic)
Lay-offs?
The door shuts behind him.
CUT TO:
CLOSE-UP - NEWSPAPER
The front page of the Phoenix Sun-Times -- the headline reads
"Misery Index Soars".
Beth's hand comes INTO FRAME and crumples the page.
An oasis in the center of a packed mall parking lot. Carol
hurries toward the front entrance in a snappy skirt and blazer
combo, a Bullock's name tag attached to her lapel.
Nick and Carol are walking away from the Pizza Hut, across a
huge parking lot, toward a large mall. Cars circle past them,
searching for close spots.
NICK
(doggedly)
It was the drive that killed us. San
Antonio to Seattle is just too many
hours in a car. If we'd have flown,
we would've made it.
CAROL
(shaking her head)
No...
NICK
Things were all right in bed.
CAROL
But the rest of the time they were...
awful.
NICK
(hurt)
Really?
CAROL
(flatly)
Nick. We couldn't stand each other.
We stopped in Enfield and just stayed.
NICK
(after a beat)
Why didn't you go on to Seattle? It
was your car.
Carol stops. On her face, the answer to his question is clear --
she was stuck on Nick then and she's still stuck on him now.
But she'd never let him know that.
CAROL
(dryly)
Big trees scare me.
She starts walking. Nick hurries up beside her. They walk
side by side for a few paces before the shotdown Nick comes
up with a new ploy to win favor.
NICK
(casually)
I'm thinking about stealing a t.v.
CUT TO:
Nick is driving. His face is beaded with sweat as he drags
heavily on a cigarette. He pushes the buttons on his radio,
getting NEWS BROADCASTS.
NEWSMAN'S VOICE
And in Canton, Ohio today, a man
opened fire in a mall, killing nine
and wounding seventeen others. Initial
reports indicate the young man was a
disgruntled employee...
Nick turns the radio off.
He pulls the scotch bottle from his jacket and takes a slug.
He jerks his necktie loose and slips it over his head. He
tosses it into the back seat.
NICK'S SEDAN
swerves into a vast mall parking lot.
Through the flow of traffic, WE SEE Nick standing at a
payphone on the outside wall of a Red Lobster Restaurant.
Nick speaks urgently into the phone, punctuating his
conversation with edgy body language. Abruptly, he hangs up.
CUT TO:
The lightly traveled highway cuts a straight line through
the desert.
Nick's sedan pulls off into a service station with a giant
teepee beside it.
The wind is roaring, kicking up swirls of grey dust in the
flourescent light of the service station.
A TEENAGE NAVAJO boy is filling Nick's tank. Nick leans
against the car staring at the giant teepee.
NICK
Nobody lives in that, right?
NAVAJO TEEN
Gift shop. But it closed at seven.
NICK
(cheerfully shrugging)
I got no one to shop for.
A gust of wind sends dust into Nick's eye.
NICK
Shit.
(rubbing his eye)
Fuckin' wind...
NAVAJO TEEN
Yeah.
NICK
(sincerely)
What does it mean?
NAVAJO TEEN
High pressure field coming in --
should bring some nice weather.
NICK
No. The wind itself, you know what I
mean, you're an Indian...
NAVAJO TEEN
(correcting him)
I'm a Navajo.
NICK
Yeah, so you're in tune with this
stuff...
NAVAJO TEEN
(checking the pump)
It's thirteen bucks.
NICK
(his train of thought
broken)
Oh... right.
Nick pulls a bill out of his wallet and holds it out.
NICK
Here's a twenty.
The Navajo Teen takes the bill and takes a wad of bills from
his pocket.
Nick stares out at the moonlit desert and the mountains rising
in the distance.
NICK
So what does the wind mean? Like as
an omen or something, you know --
(making his voice
mystical)
-- a change is coming to the people. --
the spirit of freedom is walking the
land.
(flatly)
That kind of meaning...
NAVAJO TEEN
(handing him money)
Fourteen, fifteen and five makes
twenty.
He opens Nick's car door for him.
NAVAJO TEEN
The wind is. It's the wind like I'm
a Navajo.
NICK
That's it?
The Navajo teen nods.
NICK
Shit.
He gets in the car, his mood darkening, and pulls his door
shut with a slam.
NICK
(out the window)
It would be better if meant something.
The Navajo teen shrugs. Nick starts the engine.
CUT TO:
Nick stares at the road ahead. He takes rapid drags on a
cigarette. The RADIO is barely audible over the ROAR of the
WIND through the open windows.
PREACHER'S VOICE
(covered by static)
"And he arose and came to his father,
but when he was still a great way
off, his father saw him and had
compassion, and ran and..."
Nick turns the radio off.
He fumbles the cigarette into the ashtray.
He takes a pint of scotch from the front seat, uncaps it,
takes a slug, takes another slug, recaps it, and drops it
back on the seat.
He stares at the road. He looks down to the front seat and
finds the map. He splits his attention between the road and
unfolding the map. The wind catches the map.
The map billows up, covering his face. Losing control of the
car, Nick slaps it down.
A car HORN blares.
Nick jerks the car back into his lane, bats the map down
again, and pulls off to the side of the road.
He stops the car and slams the shift into park.
He opens his door a crack, turning on the dome light. He
smooths out the map on the dashboard.
Billings and Enfield are marked with Carol's big red circles.
CLOSE-UP - THE MAP
Nick's finger traces from Enfield toward Billings along the
route Carol highlighted with the red felt-tip. Halfway to
Billings, the red line stops. Nick's finger stops.
NICK
He stares at the map.
CUT TO:
Beth stands in the moonlight, staring out at the stars.
BETH
(contemplatively
dubious)
You find what you want here?
Sid steps out behind her.
SID
It seems that way.
BETH
Yeah?
SID
(simply)
I found you.
BETH
Oh. No...
She walks out into the backyard. Sid follows her.
SID
(earnestly)
We never met before last night...
The moonlight through the orange trees casts a magical air
about the backyard. Beth stops by a swingset.
SID
...but we know each other.
Beth stiffens.
BETH
No...
She walks away from him. He watches her intently.
SID
Leave it behind.
She looks to him.
BETH
Leave what behind?
SID
Unhappiness.
BETH
(amused)
That was a bad answer.
SID
(seriously)
No. It was true.
Beth stares at Sid.
BETH
It's not.
SID
Come hold me.
(after a beat)
Come hold me, and you'll be happy.
BETH
(dryly)
I'll find happiness. Right. In your
arms.
SID
Yes.
BETH
In you.
SID
Yes.
BETH
But I won't. I have to find happiness
in myself.
SID
No. That's wrong.
(going toward her)
People tell you that, but it's wrong.
She turns away from him. He stands behind her, close.
SID
I've lived with people who have that
happiness from within. That happiness --
it's just them being pleased with
themselves. It's not enough. It's a
lonely thing.
She turns and faces him. The moonlight casts a pale glow
over them.
She stares in his eyes for a long moment. She steps back
from him.
BETH
You're showing how young you are.
SID
No. I'm not. I'm showing you a way.
You know that. And you know me.
(after a beat)
And I know you.
She walks away from him, back to the swingset.
BETH
I don't know you.
Sid follows and takes her arms, turning her to face him.
SID
You know.
BETH
(after a beat,
defensively)
I know you want to fuck me.
He pulls her very close. He lets go of her arms so she is
standing against him, unrestrained.
SID
Is that what you know?
Beth stares at his face for a long time.
BETH
I know...
She kisses him, suddenly, long and slow.
BETH
(whispering)
I know you.
They kiss, pulling each other tight.
They lose their balance and stagger against the swingset,
kissing passionately. Beth pulls back.
BETH
(w/ fierce intensity)
I know you.
SID
That's right.
CUT TO:
A canopy of stars hangs over it.
Nick walks toward the door. He stops, stares at the door and
starts back for his car. He stops, shakes his head, and walks
quickly to the front door.
FRONT PORCH
Nick stands, staring at the door. He knocks. He waits
impatiently, then pounds on the door. On his third pound the
lights in the house suddenly go on.
OVER NICK'S SHOULDER
The door abruptly opens.
MR. AUGUST, an eighty year old man, stands in the doorway.
HE wears pajamas, slippers, and a long robe. He is over six
and a half feet tall.
NICK AND MR. AUGUST
Nick, startled, steps back. Mr. August stares at him. Nick
composes himself.
NICK
Excuse me...
Mr. August stares at him.
NICK
Excuse me... I'm... I'm looking for
my parents.
Mr. August calmly puts his hands over his ears, and slowly
shakes his head.
NICK
My mother, my father... they...
ELIZABETH, a fifteen year old girl steps out from behind Mr.
August. She seems very small next to Mr. August. He puts a
hand on her shoulder. She stares at Nick.
NICK
(uncomfortably)
Hello.
ELIZABETH
Hello.
NICK
(exhaling in relief)
Oh... good...
(to the point)
This is my house. I, uhh... mean
this is the house I grew up in.
Nick looks past them into the house.
ELIZABETH
(nodding to Mr. August)
This is his house now.
NICK
Nice to meet you.
He holds out a hand to Mr. August, who slowly shakes it.
ELIZABETH
He's deaf.
NICK
(loudly)
Nice to meet you.
ELIZABETH
He's stone deaf.
NICK
Oh.
(uncomfortably)
Yelling doesn't help.
ELIZABETH
No.
Nick breaks the handshake. Mr. August smiles at him. Nick
looks to Elizabeth.
NICK
My name is Nick, Nick Brennan.
He waits for her to introduce herself. She doesn't.
NICK
Did you know the Brennans?
ELIZABETH
No.
NICK
They lived here. They used to live
here. I used to live here with them...
Elizabeth stares at him. Nick tries his salesman charm.
NICK
What's your name?
ELIZABETH
Elizabeth.
NICK
No...
ELIZABETH
Yes.
NICK
I know an Elizabeth.
(quietly)
I call her Beth.
CUT TO:
Nick looks like hell -- his eyes red, his hair a mess. The
nearly empty scotch bottle is on the dashboard.
The car windows are open, the roar of the wind competing
with the blasting radio.
Nick suddenly jerks the wheel over.
The sedan screeches off the highway into the abandoned rest
area.
It stops facing a battered phone booth -- the engine turns
off but the headlines stay shining on the phone booth.
IN THE SEDAN
Nick turns off the radio. It is suddenly very quiet -- only
the occasional lonely DRONE OF A TRUCK passing on the highway.
He takes a deep breath.
Nick's sedan is parked in the same place as the night before.
A YOUNG MAN with long hair ROARS into the rest stop on a
Harley-Davidson, his life's possession strapped on the back.
He stops the bike between Nick's car and the phonebooth,
idling the engine, loudly. He looks to the phonebooth, the
receiver dangling. He turns to Nick's sedan.
YOUNG MAN
Phone work?
NICK
Awakened by the ROAR, Nick has wearily leaned his head out
the window.
Nick stares at the young man.
NICK
(after a beat)
No.
Drained, Nick rests his head on the steering wheel.
OFFSCREEN, the motorcycle starts up and zooms away. A silence
falls over the rest stop.
Without raising his head from the steering wheel, Nick starts
the car.
CUT TO:
Boxes full of a motley collection of knickknacks, housewares,
and crummy appliances are spread out on the lawn.
In the BACKGROUND a couple of M.T.V. influenced teens are
checking out the knickknacks and goofing on them.
MRS. DOTSON, a woman in her late forties wearing a NURSE'S
UNIFORM is poking through the odds and ends.
Beth and Carol hovering near her.
Mrs. Dotson picks up the coffee maker, examines it, and puts
it down. She picks up the blender, examines it, and puts it
down.
CAROL
(impatiently)
Is there something specific you're
looking for?
MRS. DOTSON
Yes.
(sheepishly)
Actually everything... I don't have
anything.
BETH
Nothing?
MRS. DOTSON
I just moved to town.
(hesitating then
confiding)
My husband passed away, and I, umm,
didn't want to have our things...
they were too familiar.
Beth realizes why she's selling all her stuff -- it's too
familiar.
BETH
(abruptly)
You can have it all for three hundred.
The stuff in these boxes and
everything inside.
MRS. DOTSON
(taken aback)
Oh, my, I don't know... everything?
BETH
Everything.
(hesitating)
Except the t.v.
Mrs. Dotson searches Beth's face with a kind gaze. Beth smiles
nervously.
BETH
(apologetically)
The t.v.s not for sale.
CUT TO:
Nick's smoking, looking haggard. Between drags, he anxiously
taps a tempo on the steering wheel with his cigarette holding
hand.
NICK'S POV
The highway and the desert stretch out before him, the heat
waves of late afternoon shimmering above the blacktop.
In the distance, the giant teepee souvenir shop rises out of
the horizon like a mirage.
NICK
An idea strikes him and his lips tighten into a small
determined smile.
CUT TO:
Beth and Mrs. Dotson are standing beside the now empty
blankets.
In the BACKGROUND, Sid and Carol are packing boxes into Mrs.
Dotson's car.
Mrs. Dotson has begun to fill out a check.
MRS. DOTSON
I'm sorry, what's your name?
BETH
Can you just leave the name blank? I
won't have an account, so I'll have
to find someplace to cash it for me.
Mrs. Dotson looks at her. They stare into each other's eyes.
MRS. DOTSON
(after a beat)
All right.
Mrs. Dotson hands Beth the check. Beth sticks it in her back
pocket. After an awkward moment she extends her hand.
BETH
Thanks a lot.
Mrs. Dotson takes her hand. Sid and Carol walk up to them.
SID
(cheerfully)
You're set.
Mrs. Dotson lets go of Beth's hand. They turn to Sid and
Carol.
MRS. DOTSON
(warmly chagrined)
You did all the work...
SID
(good-naturedly)
Sure.
(mischieviously)
Now I've gotta finish painting, but
Carol here would be happy to help
you unload.
Carol starts to protest and then checks herself for Beth's
sake.
CAROL
(trapped, dryly)
Of course. I'll follow you in my
car.
SID
(to Mrs. Dotson)
And I'll be by tomorrow with my truck
and the big things.
He heads into the house. Beth stares after him. Mrs. Dotson
touches her shoulder, lightly, getting her attention.
MRS. DOTSON
(to Beth)
Thank you.
(smiling)
You've given me a home.
She looks to Carol.
CAROL
(nicely)
I'll be right along.
Mrs. Dotson walks off toward her car.
CAROL
(to Beth)
This had to be history's most
efficient tag sale.
Beth laughs, distractedly.
BETH
Yeah... I'm sorry Sid stuck you with
unloading.
CAROL
No problem.
(smiling to herself)
He kinda bites my butt, but he's
okay.
BETH
He is.
Beth suddenly embraces Carol.
BETH
Listen.
(breaking the embrace)
I'll probably be gone before you get
back.
CAROL
I thought maybe we could be roomies
for a while. You know, while you
figure out what's next.
BETH
(shaking her head)
I can't.
(after a beat,
admitting her feelings)
He gets to me... too much. If I don't
go I'll end up with staying with
him.
CAROL
(gently)
You've done worse.
BETH
Sure.
They look at each other and start to laugh. Their laughter
builds -- a release of the strain of the last two days.
CUT TO:
Beth makes her way to her car. Sid stands in the doorway,
watching.
SID
What are you gonna do?
She turns and faces him.
BETH
I don't know.
Beth tosses her suitcases in the backseat. She gets into the
car and starts the engine.
Sid stands, willing her to stop the car.
Beth pulls out to the end of the driveway.
Nick's car screeches to a stop in front of the house. He
leaps out of the car and runs toward the front door.
Nick runs out into his lawn.
NICK
(running; under his
breath)
Be at Carol's... be at Carol's...
The CAMERA FOLLOWING he races up to Carol's front door and
leans on the doorbell -- a loud tight buzzing.
He pounds on the door, then stops, gasping for breath. No
one's home. He turns, leaning against the door for support,
staring out at tract house neighborhood.
NICK
(spent)
I'm too late...
Suddenly he bolts for his car.
Nick yanks his car door open and disappears into it. In a
second he emerges with the bottle of scotch.
It's empty. He eyes it for a moment then hurls it as far as
he can down the street -- it shatters explosively.
He races to his front door and stops dead in his tracks at
the open doorway.
Carol gets out of her car. Nick hurries toward her.
CAROL
(flatly)
You came back.
NICK
(a little chagrined)
Yeah.
CAROL
Is Beth here?
NICK
No. Do you know where she went?
CAROL
No.
NICK
Shit.
CAROL
You're too late.
SID
(from the doorway)
She's gone.
NICK
(to Carol, exasperated)
Who is this guy?
CAROL
(walking past him
toward the house)
Beth's new boyfriend.
NICK
(exploding)
What?!
CAROL
(stopping)
You heard me.
NICK
(to Sid)
Is this true?!
SID
Not really.
He turns and walks back into the house.
NICK
(to Carol)
Not really?
He races after Sid.
They're lugging the t.v. across to Carol's -- Carol backing
up and Nick going forward. They arrive at the front door.
Nick takes most of the weight of the t.v., while Carol fumbles
with her key into her front door lock with her free hand.
CAROL
You're not going to be their new
neighbor.
NICK
It was just something to say.
Carol gets the door open.
CAROL
Good.
Carol backs into the house, leading the way.
Through the windshield we see Sid driving slowly, looking
out at motel parking lots. Their neon signs reflect in the
windshield.
Gas stations, fast food joints and motels.
Sid and his truck pull away from the strip and up onto the
on ramp.
Sid and his truck pull onto the highway.
CREDITS ROLL
As Sid's taillights disappear down the barren highway.
