                    Mr. Bishop?

    An African-American man turns.  LEMONDBISHOP (29).  Tall, *
      shaved head, calm.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #115     "Fleas"     PINK COLLATED     1/29/10      23.

      Doing his best to seem like an MBA, not a drug kingpin.  
      Leaning against an active horse corral, he eyes Kalinda and 
      Alicia approaching.

                                  BISHOP
                    So you re my lawyer s lawyer?

                                  KALINDA
                    Actually, she is. 

                                  BISHOP
                          (grins)
                    What s that make you?  My lawyer s 
                    lawyer s lawyer?

                                  KALINDA
                    No.  Because that would be comic.

      Bishop laughs as his right hand man, TONYGURSTELLE (27), *
      white, tall, intense but handsome eyes, steps forward to 
      frisk Kalinda.  

                                  BISHOP
                    It s alright.  The lawyers are on 
                    our side, didn t you hear, William?  
                    When we were picking sides, they 
                    got the cops; we got the lawyers.

      Alicia eyes Bishop.  A confident man.  Bishop sees her look.  
      Pauses.  Recognizing her?

                                  ALICIA
                    Beautiful horses.

                                  BISHOP
                    They re not mine.  Rich people need 
                    places to board them.

                                  KALINDA
                    One of your legit businesses?

                                  BISHOP
                    Hey, I m all legit these days.  
                    Isn t that right?

                                  GURSTELLE
                    It is.

                                  BISHOP
                    So you wanted help with Dorfman?
                    Good.  I like him.  Did he show you 
                    his rock collection?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #115     "Fleas"     PINK COLLATED     1/29/10      24.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes.

                                  BISHOP
                    I think he just picked up those 
                    rocks on the street.
                          (to Bill)
                    Guy has rocks from the top peaks 
                    around the world.

                                  GURSTELLE
                    Everest?

                                  BISHOP
                    No, not that one yet.  Mountain 
                    climbing, never made sense to me.  
                    Bunch of idiots who need something 
                    to do.  But he s a good lawyer.  And 
                    a lucky one.  We didn t even have to 
                    go to trial with that witness dying. 

                                  ALICIA
                    Being murdered.  

      Bishop turns to her, eyes her.  Intimidated, Alicia looks 
      away.  Bishop smiles at that.

                                  KALINDA
                    Mr. Dorfman has been accused of 
                    leaking the witness s identity 
                    allowing you to... murder her.

                                  BISHOP
                    Well, as I m sure you re aware, he 
                    didn t do that because I didn t do *
                    that.

                                  KALINDA
                    Right, but if you could... steer us 
                    toward what really happened, I 
                    think that could help Mr. Dorfman.

                                  BISHOP
                     What really happened? 

      Alicia clears her throat, bravely tries straightforward:

                                  ALICIA
                    Is there some evidence that points 
                    toward the murder happening for 
                    other reasons?  Reasons that didn t 
                    require the witness list.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE GOOD WIFE #115     "Fleas"     PINK COLLATED     1/29/10      25.

      Bishop stares at her.  Not angry eyes.  Calm, long-suffering.

                                  BISHOP
                    I own a chain of six sporting good 
                    stores, four restaurants, ten dry 
                    cleaners.  I am a businessman.  So 
                    I don t want you to make the same 
                    mistake as the government: thinking 
                    that, because of the color of my 
                    skin, I sell drugs.  Because... 
                    that would be racism, wouldn t it?

      Alicia and Bishop stare at each other.  A second.  Then...


      Becca.  She sits on the hood of her mini coop, laughing with 
      three other juniors: mean girls.  In the school parking lot-- 
    not so close to the school it feels like Nickelodeon.  

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Becca?

      Becca looks up.  Finds the certain and odd personage of Eli 
      Gold.

                                  BECCA
                    She s still in class.

    Eli smiles.  Moves closer.  The other girls start to split.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    You got a problem?

                                  ELI GOLD
                    That depends, Upriser7?

      Becca smiles, grins, studies Gold, unintimidated.

                                  BECCA
                    So, what, you re from the Internet 
                    police?

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Just an interested bystander who 
                    wants to protect his six-figure 
                    income.  So you and Zach talk a 
                    lot?  He tells you a lot about his 
                    parents, is that it?

                                  BECCA
                    Oh no.  Have I been a bad girl?

                                  ELI GOLD
                    No.  Dear Becca.  Because that 
                    would only make you want to do it 
                    again.  You know what you ve been?  
                    Gum on the bottom of my shoe.  A 
                    little spoiled brat who s gonna get

                    spring break, and work as a dental 
                    hygienist until the day you die.   

                                  BECCA
                    And you-- you re a perv.

    Eli laughs.  Becca smiles, sees a MOTORCYCLE COP pulling 
      through the lot, and starts to scream, an earth-curdling 
      scream!  People in the parking lot turn.  The cop makes a u-
      turn, revs up.  As Becca smiles at Eli Gold, whispers:

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    I d work on my story, perv.

    The cop approaches as Eli turns, smiles...

                                  MOTORCYCLE COP
                    Oh, Mr. Gold, I m sorry.

      Becca s smile drops.  Oh shit.  

                                  ELI GOLD
                    That s alright.  Just the daughter 
                    of a friend.  She s alright now.  
                    Aren t you, Becca?

      Becca nods, humbled.  The cop smiles, nods, starts off again.

                                  ELI GOLD (CONT D)
                    I have a lot of friends.  I m sure 
                    you do too.  The only difference, 
                    my friends aren t in homeroom.  So 
                    I want you to listen to me.  Stop 
                    tweeting.  If you tweet, I will 
                    know you tweet.  And I will-- have 
                    you seen DRAG ME TO HELL?
                          (she nods)
                    It will be like that.  Do you 
                      understand?
                          (she nods)
                    I want to hear the words.

                                  BECCA
                      I understand.

                                  ELI GOLD
                    Good.  And enjoy high school.  It s 
                    really the best time of your life.

    And Eli Gold starts away.  Becca stares after him, leans back 
      against her car, exhales.  


      LeMondBishop.  He stands in his usual spot, watching the *
      horses.

                    No reflection on your work.  I just

                    wraps, you turn over the murderer.

                                  BISHOP
                    Well, we only ended up there 
                    because of your defense.  

      Bishop nods to Alicia.  She doesn t nod back.
