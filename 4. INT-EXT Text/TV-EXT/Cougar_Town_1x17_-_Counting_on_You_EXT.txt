                    No, we re friends because we have a

                    Dad, does that man have three fingers 
                    because of what I m about to do?

                              BOBBY
                    I want to say no...

                    I m out.  I m not doing this.

  As Travis trudges to shore, Bobby disappointedly calls out:

                              BOBBY
                    Aw, come on, Trav.  Noodling s no fun 
                    if you do it alone!

                    It s just so depressing to me that 
                    men and women can t be real friends.  
                    This is like finding out that twelve 
                    hour mascara only lasts three hours.

                    Jules, don t feel so bad.  Look, guys 
                    just play the friend card because 
                    it s so hard to impress women.

  Tom (shirtless and watering his lawn) waves to Jules.  He 
  starts to water down his body with the hose.

  They enter the house. 


  Everyone follows him out.

  He takes off on the motorbike -- and drives into the bush 
  again.  Ellie slams the door and Jules and Grayson react.

  Bobby comes out of his tent.  Travis is nowhere to be found.

                              BOBBY
                    Trav?  You here?  

  Bobby spots something approaching.  His eyes well with 
  tears:

                              BOBBY (CONT D)
                    I ve never been more proud.

  WE REVEAL Travis, dripping head to toe, with a GIANT CATFISH 
  ON HIS ARM.

                                TRAVIS
                    Please get it off.  The big one 
                    swallowed a smaller one that s on my 
                    arm, too.
