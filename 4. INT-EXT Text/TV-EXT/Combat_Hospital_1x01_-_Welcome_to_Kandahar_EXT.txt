      A giant C-17 GLOBEMASTER flies high above ocher-brown 
      mountains and dusty plains.  A title card reads:

                          SOUTHERN AFGHANISTAN - 2006


      A military ceremony is underway in a dusty courtyard between 
      ramshackle living quarters on the left and the KANDAHAR ROLE 
        3 MULTI-NATIONAL MEDICAL UNIT on the right, an impressive 
      name for the least impressive hodgepodge of shipping 
      containers, tents, plywood and duct tape you ever saw.  

                                  MAJ. GEN. VAN DER VELDE
                    ...has in reality already taken 
                    place, thanks to the professionalism 
                    of the outgoing commander, Colonel 
                    Winton Beaven...

      This takes place near the runway of Kandahar Airfield, on the 
      other side of a ten-foot concrete blast wall:  the SOUND OF A 
      CARGO JET taking off forces MAJOR GENERAL VAN DER VELDE, the 
      Dutch NATO commander for South Afghanistan, to pause.  

                                  MAJ. GEN. VAN DER VELDE (CONT D)
                    ...and the new commander, Colonel 
                    Xavier Leclerc.

      There s applause from the audience: a few CIVILIANS, the vast 
      majority MILITARY PERSONNEL in desert camouflage.  Sitting 
      behind the General on the makeshift stage, COLONEL XAVIER 
      LECLERC, M.D., mid 40 s, a career military surgeon with a 
      great face for poker, doesn t acknowledge the applause; if 
      anything he s embarrassed by it.

                                  MAJ. GEN. VAN DER VELDE (CONT D)
                    But this hospital has always been a 
                      multi-national effort, and that... 

      In the audience, a BEEPER goes off; an embarrassed MEDIC 
      makes her way to the aisle.  The general ignores the 
      interruption.

                                  MAJ. GEN. VAN DER VELDE (CONT D)
                    ...will continue under Canada as 
                    lead nation with the U.S. providing 
                    the second largest contingent... 

      Now OTHER BEEPERS go off, and one by one those beeped slip 
      out, trying unsuccessfully to not disturb the general, who 
      struggles on with his remarks. 

                                  MAJ. GEN. VAN DER VELDE (CONT D)
                    ...with important contributions from 
                    many other nations, including the 
                    UK, Denmark, Australia, Holland...

      More BEEPERS, more MEDICS leaving, breaking into a run as 
      they head toward the MMU.  


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                          COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - TEASER - 3.

      CONTINUED:

      And now a BEEPER GOES OFF on stage, right behind the General:  
      it belongs to U.S. NAVY COMMANDER ROGER  WILL  WILLETT, the 
      soft-spoken African American Chief Nurse.  

                                  MAJ. GEN. VAN DER VELDE (CONT D)
                    ...New Zealand, France, Germany, 
                      Romania...

      The General turns to see Will whispering to Col. Leclerc.

                                  WILL WILLETT
                    Seven Marines inbound.  I.E.D.

      Col. Leclerc gives a apologetic look to the general, then he 
      and Will Willett tiptoe off the stage.  The general turns 
      back to the MUCH SMALLER AUDIENCE -- and cuts to the chase. 

                                  MAJ. GEN. VAN DER VELDE
                    We will now conclude with the 
                      benediction.  Padre?  

      The General makes a  hurry up  gesture to the startled U.S. 
      ARMY CHAPLAIN who takes the General s place at the podium.

                                  CHAPLAIN
                    Let us bow--

      That s as far as he gets -- everyone ducks as the courtyard 
      is WHIPPED BY THE DOWNDRAFT of TWO MEDEVAC BLACKHAWKS coming 
      in low and fast, raising clouds of dust, blowing over metal 
      folding chairs like confetti and knocking over the podium.  
      The pages of the general s speech flutter away.


      A pair of truck-like MILITARY AMBULANCES wait beside the pad 
      as the Blackhawks touch down in a cloud of dust.  The engine 
      roar makes speech impossible so the MEDIC IN THE HELICOPTER 
      uses hand signals to say  7 wounded. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The Blackhawks are on the other side of the blast wall, so we 
      can t see the ambulances being loaded from here.  Col. 
      Leclerc and Will Willett wait with a small CROWD OF MEDICAL 
      PERSONNEL -- including ALL THE REGULAR CHARACTERS we ll meet 
      later.  Some have managed to put on blue scrubs over their 
      camo pants and desert boots.  The first ambulance comes 
      around the blast wall into view, the DRIVER flashing HAND 
      SIGNALS.  REGIMENTAL SERGEANT MAJOR SEAN KELLY interprets:

                                  RSM SEAN KELLY
                     7 wounded.  4 litters, 3 walking. 

      The ambulances pull up and the medics swing the rear doors 
      open, revealing PATHETICALLY SMALL CHILDREN S FEET.  

                                  WILL WILLETT
                    These aren t the Marines!  They re 
                    kids!

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Then where the hell are our Marines?

                                                                            CUT TO:                                          COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - TEASER - 5.



      ...the enormous cargo jet goes into a CORKSCREW DIVE worthy 
      of a fighter plane, while back inside...


      We re close enough to hear the TIRES SQUEAL as the C-17 
      touches down, but as we

      PULL BACK TO A WIDE ANGLE 

      the massive plane is dwarfed by the vastness of Kandahar 
      Airfield, the busiest single runway airport in the world, 
      NATO headquarters for South Afghanistan and home to 12,000 
      soldiers and civilians from a dozen countries.  The base is 
      littered with construction sites and groups of temporary 
      buildings, the Role 3 Multinational Medical Unit somewhere 
      among them.  A pair of A-10 WARTHOG fighters take off with a 
      ROAR as we...

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      With all the TROOPS off-loaded, the C-17 taxis away.   Buses 
      and humvees full of troops are also preparing to drive off.  
      Everyone s been met by their units, except Rebecca and Bobby.

                                    REBECCA
                    Anybody here from the medical unit?  
                    Anyone going near the hospital?

      Evidently nobody is.  The last of the busses pull away, 
      leaving Rebecca and Bobby standing forlorn with their duffle 
      bags in the middle of what seems like an endless length of 
      tarmac with nothing nearby.  

                                  BOBBY
                    What now? 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                        COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT ONE - 8.

      CONTINUED:

      In a moment of silence between plane takeoffs, they HEAR a 
      quiet BZZZT.  BZZZT.  BZZZT.

                                  BOBBY (CONT D)
                    I think that s you.

      Rebecca pulls out her cell phone, which is on VIBRATE.  
      BZZZT.  BZZZT -- the sound of incoming text messages.  She 
      stares at it, incredulously.

                                  BOBBY (CONT D)
                    Your phone works here?

                                    REBECCA
                    I don t know if it works as a phone, 
                    but I m getting text messages.

                                  BOBBY
                    Maybe there s one telling us where 
                    we should go.

      Rebecca starts to scroll through the messages even as the 
      BZZZT, BZZZT of her phone announces messages still arriving.

                                    REBECCA
                    Dammit!

      She stabs a key to delete the first message, and the next 
      message, and the next, and the next, while Bobby examines his 
      own cell phone.

                                  BOBBY
                    Nothing.  No messages.  No bars.  
                    Nada.

      Rebecca keeps hitting delete.

                                    REBECCA
                    You d think that Kandahar would be 
                    far enough away...

                                  BOBBY
                    You re not going to even read them?

                                    REBECCA
                    They re all from the same guy.  My 
                    ex.  He s turned into a stalker.

                                  BOBBY
                    Oh.  No messages from here, then?

                                    REBECCA
                    No.  That looks like the nearest 
                    building.  Let s head there.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                        COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT ONE - 9.

      They set out, dragging their bags along with them.

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:


      The buildings Bobby and Rebecca are trudging toward don t 
      look any closer.  A sudden HONKING HORN scares the shit out 
      of them.  A ROMANIAN MILITARY POLICEMAN leans out of his 
      humvee to SHOUT at them -- in Romanian.  Rebecca shows him 
      the flag on her shoulder.


                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                        COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT ONE - 10.

                    Do you speak English?  We re trying 
                    to get to the hospital.

                                  ROMANIAN M.P.
                    Then why you go to Romanian 
                    compound?

                                    REBECCA
                    We didn t know that s what it was.   

                                  ROMANIAN M.P.
                    Also, it is not for walking here.  
                    This is for only airplanes.
                    Get in, we give ride.


      The Romanian M.P. s humvee drives away, having dropped 
      Rebecca and Bobby off.  There s no one around.  They stare, 
      incredulously, at this pile of plywood and duct tape.

                                    REBECCA
                    I love what they ve done to the 
                    place.


      Well rehearsed LITTER BEARERS swiftly unload the first 
      ambulance as Col. Leclerc does triage on the spot. 

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Take him to one, then straight to 
                    the OR after resusc.  He goes to 
                    three.  The belly wound goes to two.  
                    This one, bay four.

      We follow the litter of the young Marine destined for Trauma 
      Bay Four as the MEDICS race him through the swinging doors--                                        COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT ONE - 18.



      Tongues of flame light the runway as A PAIR OF F-18 S take 
      off with the aid of their ROARING AFTERBURNERS.


      They emerge from the hospital into the night.  Beyond the 
      blast walls to their right, the glow of a busy airbase.  In 
      front of them, the flimsy plywood living quarters.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                        COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT TWO - 29.

                    Good, then you can explain the name.  
                    Because there s apparently not an A-
                    hut or a C-hut, only B-huts.

                                  BOBBY
                    The manual didn t say.

                                  SIMON
                    Oh well, another military mystery.  
                    B-hut 1 and 2 are for men, 3 and 4 
                    for women.  Same for the second row, 
                    5 and 6 for men, 7 and 8 for women.  
                    Bobby, you re in here.

      They climb the steps of B-hut 2.


      DOCTORS, NURSES and MEDTECHS -- Rebecca, Bobby and Simon 
      among them -- pour down the steps of the B-huts and race 
      across to the hospital.  They can HEAR incoming helicopters.


      The rear doors of the first ambulance swing open and LITTER 
      BEARERS unload WOUNDED AFGHANI SOLDIERS as Col. Leclerc does 
      triage on the spot.  One WOUNDED AFGHANI, YELLING CURSES in 
      Pashto, is accompanied by a PAIR OF U.S. AIR FORCE  P.J. s -- 
      for Pararescue Jumpers, regarded as the elite of helicopter 
      medics -- Master Sgt. RICARDO RAMIEREZ and Technical Sgt. 
      JIRO HAMANO, still wearing their night vision-equipped 
      helmets.  They run alongside the litter holding IV bags.

      In English, that s an Enemy High Value Individual with Gun 
      Shot Wounds through his right chest and Left Lower Quadrant 
      of his abdomen.

                    Take him to 4.


      Rebecca and Bobby come out of the hospital building, 
      surprised that it s now daylight.  The flags flutter in the 
      dusty breeze as Rebecca and Bobby cross to the B-huts.


      A mini-convoy of THREE ARMORED G-WAGONS, one equipped with a 
      top-mounted machine gun, waits outside the hospital s 
      outpatient entrance.  An AFGHANI POLICE CAR with lights 
      flashing pulls up and parks.  MAJOR GHEZAL SAMIZAY, one of 
      just a handful of women in senior Afghan National Police 
      ranks, gets out and hurries into the hospital.


      Will Willett, with young Aref in his arms, orchestrates a 
      procession of patients from the ward being carried on litters 
      or, in the case of the YOUNG SOLDIER and MARINES we saw 
      earlier, walking, propelling their own IV stands, out through 
      the EMERGENCY EXIT DOORS on the north side of the building to  
      A CONCRETE BUNKER ten yards away.


      No planes come in or out, due to the rocket attack.  We see a 
      puff of smoke followed by the SOUND OF AN EXPLOSION:  a 
      rocket s landed somewhere in the vastness of the airbase.


      The SIRENS go off again.  This time it s the  all clear. 


      Aref s having the time of his life riding on Will Willett s 
      shoulders as we see the evacuation in reverse:  now, the 
      litter bearers and the walking wounded are heading from the 
      bunker back to the hospital. 


      Rebecca comes out, and stops abruptly when she sees:

      STAFF in respect to Lance Corporal Whitey White.  

      BACK TO REBECCA

      who comes to attention and salutes also.

      WIDER ANGLE

      With the flags now at half staff, the Colonel and the 
      Regimental Sergeant Major simultaneously lower their arms 
      from the salute, then turn back to the hospital building as 
      Bobby comes out behind Rebecca.  Bobby arrives at her side 
      just as Col. Leclerc and RSM Kelly reach her.

                                    REBECCA
                    Colonel-- 

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    The Taliban prisoner s gone missing.  
                    I know.  

                                    REBECCA
                    He didn t  go missing.   He was 
                    taken out of here.  What are you 
                    going to do about it?

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Nothing right now.

                                    REBECCA
                    What?  Aren t you pissed off?

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    I m pissed off for the same reason 
                    you are, that we lost that young 
                    man.  I take it personally when we 
                    lose one and I see that you do, too.

                                    REBECCA
                    But what about-- 

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    We ll discuss it tomorrow.  Get some 
                    sleep now.  That s an order.

      Rebecca s on the verge of trying to continue the argument but 
      thinks better of it.  Col. Leclerc and RSM Kelly walk on past 
      them, back toward the Role 3 MMU.  Rebecca and Bobby turn 
      towards the living quarters.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                      COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT FIVE - 64.

                                    REBECCA
                    I ve completely lost track, how 
                    long s it been?

                                  BOBBY
                    Since we got here?

                                    REBECCA
                    Yes.

                                  BOBBY
                    I ve lost track, too.  It was 
                    daylight.  It s daylight again.  48 
                    hours, maybe?

      BZZZT.  BZZZT.  Rebecca pulls the cell phone out, throws it 
      to the ground, and STOMPS ON IT with her thick-soled Army 
      desert boot.  She grinds the pieces into the ground.

                                    REBECCA
                    There.  Done.  Over and out.  Maybe 
                    now I can get some sleep.

                                  BOBBY
                    Actually, there s one more thing.

                                    REBECCA
                    You re kidding me.

                                  BOBBY
                    No.  I don t know what to do, except 
                    hand it to you.

      He gives her the results of the urine test.  

                                    REBECCA
                    The lab gave this to you?

                                  BOBBY
                    To give to you, yes.  He didn t 
                    think anything of it.  Since it was 
                    for your  friend.   

      She sits down on the steps of B-hut 2 to read the report.  He 
      sits down as well.  Both of them are hideously embarrassed 
      about this secret they now share.

                                    REBECCA
                    You looked at it, naturally.

                                  BOBBY
                    It wasn t exactly in a sealed 
                    envelope.  Are you relieved or sad?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                      COMBAT HOSPITAL 101 - ACT FIVE - 65.

      CONTINUED:

                                    REBECCA
                    Frankly I don t know how I feel at 
                    this point.  Relieved, I guess.  

                                  BOBBY
                    It would have been a ticket out of 
                    here.

                                    REBECCA
                    You know what?  We just had the 48 
                    hours, or whatever, from hell -- and 
                    there s no place in the world I d 
                    rather be than here.  

                                  BOBBY
                    Me, too.

                                    REBECCA
                    So you re my doctor now.  And I m 
                    sure you ve figured out that I 
                    thought I might be pregnant and 
                    according to this, I m not -- what s 
                    going on?  You re the diagnostician.

                                  BOBBY
                    It could be one of several things, 
                    none of them serious.  You need a 
                    blood test.  Can you stay awake for 
                    another half hour?

                                    REBECCA
                    Honestly?  No.  This...
                          (the test results)
                    ...is what I was worried about.  If 
                    it s something else, I can wait to 
                    find out.


      An ambulance waits to take SUCCESSFULLY TREATED COALITION 
      TROOPS to the plane that will take them to Landstuhl.  Our 
      folks have gathered to say goodbye to PATIENTS like the 
      Canadian Soldier and the two U.S. Marines that gave up their 
      beds in the ward.  PFC DAVID LOWEN of Dayton, Ohio, shakes 
      hands with Bobby and Rebecca.

                                  PFC LOWEN
                    I will.  And thanks from my parents, 
                    and thanks from my wife and kids.

                                    REBECCA
                    You have a wife and kids?

                                  PFC LOWEN
                    No, but they thank you anyway.

                                  BOBBY
                    The pleasure was all ours.

      Regimental Sergeant Major Kelly comes out and BELLOWS:

                                  RSM SEAN KELLY
                    Get that thing moving!  We got five 
                    civilian ambulances incoming from 
                    the main gate!

      Our people hurry to finish loading the ambulance, while 
      others race back inside to prepare.  As the military 
      ambulance drives off in one direction, the first of the 
      CIVILIAN AMBULANCES rounds the corner from the other.  
      Rebecca finds herself standing next to Col. Leclerc.

                                    REBECCA
                    You were right.  Nothing prepared me 
                    for this place.

                                  COL. LECLERC
                    Me neither...  me neither.

      FROM A HIGH ANGLE

      with the flags at half-staff in the foreground, WE SEE the 
      CONTROLLED CHAOS as the CIVILIAN AMBULANCES pull up and 
      another day at the Kandahar Role 3 begins.

                                        THE END
