 
  Heavy breathing on the soundtrack as we approach a small 
  guest house. A woman (MADGE) appears briefly at the 
  window. A man s sweaty hand trembles over a pocket 
  revealing a grenade. 
 
  POV walks up towards the door-- 
 
 
  A hand reaches out and rings the doorbell. 
 
 
  DANNY swipes the card. TOM looks at the lock on the 
  window -- KERCHUNK! Bars are being set up outside. 
 
                                        DANNY 
            Check it out. Windows, french doors, even the 
            roof access. All failsafe, all through this 
                                        key. 
                              (admires his work) 
              I hope this does the trick with her, Tom. 
                            She s a great person. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      I know. 
                                (nods--thank you) 
                          How reliable s the strip? 
 
                                        DANNY 
                Would I give you anything but the best? 
 
  Their eyes meet briefly. TOM s convinced. 
 
  A SERIES OF SHOTS--SECURING TOM S FLAT 
 
  -- Swipe card lock on front door is tested; 
  -- a  London bar  installed along the frame; 
  -- a barred door behind that; 
  -- hinge locks; 
  -- window bars upstairs and down; 
 
 
  TOM, dressed in a Barbour jacket, walks along a rural 
  lane. He climbs over a stile. He could be a farmer. 
 
                                  PATRICK S VOICE 
            Two miles east from the terminus is a lane. 
              Follow it and take the first stile on the 
            right. Cross the field and I ll meet you in 
              the middle. Don t be late. Dress for the 
                            country, Davy Crockett. 
 
  He walks across the field. We follow... Tension building. 
 
  ANOTHER ANGLE -- DISTANT POV

  Grainy long distance lens. Someone s watching TOM walk. 
 
  BACK TO SCENE 
 
  TOM s eyes scan the horizon. No trees to speak of. Only 
  the hedgerow he just climbed over. 
 
  Then, in the middle distance--a man. A farm labourer? 
 
  No, it s PATRICK. Alone. He sees TOM, starts walking. 
 
  The two men stop about twenty feet from one another. And 
  then do a strange thing. They start undressing 
    efficiently. 
 
  They continue until both men are completely naked. They 
  examine each other briefly. Satisfied neither is wired, 
  they start to put their clothes on again. 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                                (Irish--subtitled) 
                          Davy Crockett I presume.

                  Keep it English. No use drawing more 
                            attention to ourselves. 
 
                                      PATRICK 
              Are you joking? Anyone seeing that would 
                think we re in some fecky farmer s porn 
                                        video. 
 
                                        TOM 
              You picked the spot, not me. Let s walk. 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                                    Let s not. 
 
  Silence. A plane overheard. Both men glance, nervous. 
 
                                PATRICK (CONT D) 
                  I guess this wasn t easy for you, Mr. 
              Crockett. Had to pull some strings I bet. I 
                                  certainly did. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Something like that. Those directions wasted                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 23
 

                                  a lot of time.

              This secrecy s for my benefit as well you 
            know. There s people d fry my balls in batter 
                      if they knew what I was doing. 
 
                                        TOM 
                  Suddenly grown a conscience have we? 
 
                                      PATRICK 
            I ll tell you how it feels once I ve worn it 
                                        in. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Rich. 
 
                                      PATRICK 
            It s the same for us you know. I don t like 
              the idea of breathing the same air as you 
                            either. You follow me? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Asabiyah. 
 
                                      PATRICK 
            We ve had a minor corporate cashflow problem 
              thanks to certain recent events. So we ve 
                  been freelancing. Bit of management 
              consultancy. Few hard lads in Columbia. The 
            odd mercenary in Somalia. And then we got a 
            call from some hard nuts in Sudan. Needed a 
                swift how-to on some anti-tank weaponry 
            they d just acquired. State of the art, the 
            dog s bollocks. Our lads went over there, but 
          we weren t taking any chances and we had them 
          all checked out. Bastards would kill you soon 
                                as look at you. 
 
  TOM is icy. Brain ticking over, storing everything. 
 
                                PATRICK (CONT D) 
                Nothing new to speak of. Til last week. 
            Another check. And suddenly there s this very 
            detailed aerial schematic of a large-scale UK 
                                      facility.

              They do what I think they re gonna do and 
          most of Eir  s uninhabitable for the next two 
              hundred years. Not to mention everything 
            north of Bristol. Not that we d miss Wales. 
 
  TOM looks at him -- scepticism in his eyes -- 
 
                                PATRICK (CONT D) 
            Don t look at me like that. It s a holy war. 
            These lads are serious. And when a man with 
              my experience tells you that, you should 
                                      listen.

                      You could disincentivise them. 
 
                                      PATRICK 
          Kill them, you mean? Great minds think alike, 
            Davy. Sadly my branch chief had other ideas. 
                Wanted his money first. By the time he 
            realised he was an eegit they had a couple of 
            lads already on their way. And I had to come 
                                crying to yous. 
                                    (spitefully) 
                                    For help.

                              When did they leave? 
 
  PATRICK shrugs. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                            Are they already here? 
 
  PATRICK smiles.

                        How much money do you want? 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                          Money is not our concern.

            Some snaps we took ourself. And don t forget 
            there s still about ten Asabiyah heavies down 
            there in the desert. We ve even got lads on 
            the inside right now if you re interested. 
                  We ve got access. We ve got trust.

              Today is Tuesday. I want a blind eye til 
              sunrise Thursday. We ve got some business 
            here. We d rather you kept your noses out. 
            And that goes for the rest of the Gestapo. 
 
                                        TOM 
            You want carte blanche to do what you like 
                            for thirty six hours? 
 
                                      PATRICK 
              Cardai b n. No coppers, Special Branch or 
                uniforms. But only thirty hours. Special 
                                        offer. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              It can t be done. 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                Of course it can. You run this bloody 
                                      country. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Look this is just a technical matter, but -- 
          how can we trust you? We can t turn our backs 
                while you commit a terrorist outrage. 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                  Trusting your enemy s a fine art, Mr. 
              Crockett. We re not planning a  terrorist 
            outrage . Alright? You have my word on that, 
                Davy, okay? You re forgetting it s our 
                  country on the line here too. We re 
              recruiting. Pure and simple. And a blind eye 
            means my operation goes well. I get a gold                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 26

                                  Why the rush?

              I mean you d better get back in your car.

                                We got a deal? 
 
  TOM nods, takes a card from PATRICK, who turns to walk 
  away. 
 
                                PATRICK (CONT'D) 
            Little unfair, by the way. I mean, you know

  UNKNOWN POV - WATCHING 
 
  From a great distance, we see the men part. TOM starts to 
  run-- But the POV follows PATRICK instead... what s going 
  on?

  TOM is working through the elaborate locks and devices on 
  the door. That done he opens the door and goes in. 
 
 
  Sunrise. Early in the morning. 
 
 
  A sign saying  STATION CLOSED . A commuter looks at it 
  angrily. 
 
 
  Saturday shoppers crowd the yellow line. Pan up over 
  their disgruntled faces to an electronic board that says 
     CANCELLED . 
 
  PLATFORM VOICE 
  Bronze Line Trains regret to announce the cancellation of 
  the 0617 service to London Euston... 
 
 
  An Engineer Foreman is unwinding a line across the 
    entrance--the tape reads  FALLING DEBRIS -- DO NOT 
  ENTER.  Fire crews.

                        Move back! Move back please. 
 
 
  A grille is pulled down over Warren Street tube entrance. 
  The board reads  TUESDAY 0445 -- DUE TO CUSTOMER 
    ACTION...  
 
 
  We see the platform. Clock reads  0730 . A white light. 
  And the camera broadcasts white noise. Or rather -- there 
  is no more camera. 
 
 
  -- an DEFRA official stops a car on a country lane. 
  -- a public footpath is closed. 
  -- straw at the entrance to farms. 
 
 
    Establishing.  Thursday morning.  
 
 
  TOM looks at the lock-up. On guard. It s a small 
  asphalted square, the lockups round two sides, the sides 
  walls, heavily plastered with graffiti. He realises there 
  are three exits. 
 
  He stares at a garage door: No 6 painted on it. He feels 
    underneath the door. A key. He unlocks and lifts the 
  door. 
 
  PATRICK McCANN and two other men, with a car are waiting 
  for him. He is pulled into the garage. 
 
 
  The car is outside the lockup. One of the men is closing 
  the door. Hurriedly he gets into the back and the car 
  drives off. 
 
 
  The car pulls up. PATRICK and the men get out. Others - a 
  couple armed - come out of the farm house. 
 
 
  TOM is taken out of the boot of the car. His hands are 
  untied, his hood is taken off. He is given the computer 
  bag. McCANN offers him a hand. TOM doesn t shake it. 
  McCANN laughs. 
 
                                        MCCANN 
                  We could be friends in another life. 
 
                                        TOM 
                    We ll just have to wait til then. 
 
  He and the men get into the car and drive off. Beat. 
 
  TOM looks around. He gets off the road into a field, in 
  the shade of a tree. He turns the laptop on. He gets it 
  into deeper shade to read the screen. Dials a number on 
  his mobile.

                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                            C mon c mon c mon ... 
 
  He taps keys as the laptop boots up. He reads. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                                        Jesus. 
                                  (into phone) 
            Danny I ve got it. It s today. But most of 
          it s in Arabic. Get a translator standing by. 
                              I need a modem lead. 
 
 
  TOM is running along a lane. There is a cottage. He 
  knocks on the door. No reply. He looks through a window 
  and sees an OLD WOMAN in a floral shawl with a walking 
  stick. He waves. She waves back and turns aside. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                Please please ... 
 
  The OLD WOMAN answers the door. She is pointing to her 
  ears. 
 
                                    OLD WOMAN 
              Deaf you see, if only it was just the wax 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    (Improvising.) 
                                  Phone? Phone? 
 
                                    OLD WOMAN 
              Phoning me is no use, I m deaf. You want to 
                                        phone? 
 
  TOM nods. She gestures him in. The Grail of a telephone 
  is there. He lifts it. Wrenches out the connection to the 
  phone -- it s the right fit for the laptop. 
 
                              OLD WOMAN (CONT'D) 
            Reading lips, some say you can, never got the 
                            hang of it myself ... 
                                      (laughs) 
              Got lost did you? There s tea in the pot. 
                They get lost round here no road signs. 
 
  TOM has plugged it in. On the mobile -- 
 
                                        TOM 
            Six numbers and the bonus, mailing now! Can                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 63
 

                              you get me a car? 
 
  She pokes her stick at the computer. TOM looks up at her. 
 
                                    OLD WOMAN 
                    Modern world does it do any good? 
 
 
    Countryside. Men and women of Special Ops drive past in 
  DEFRA Landrovers. We can see Sellafield in the 
  background. 
 
  A Special Ops guy (Asian) scours the horizon with binos. 
  He sits with a caucasian colleague. Looks back to his 
    colleague. Nods. Put down their rucksacks. 
 
 
  Two Asabiyah members posing as tourists have certainly 
  slipped through the cordon. Camouflaged rather 
  brilliantly by the roots of a tree, behind a bank. 
  Gigantic rucksacks open. And a piece of scary military 
  equipment being assembled. Quietly. 
  THROUGH CROSSHAIRS 
 
  An area with low buildings can be seen--plus some 
  unobtrusive workmen. The crosshairs turn green. A beep. 
 
  GRAPHIC:  TARGET ACCEPT?  
 
  A beep. 
 
  Graphic changes:  TARGET LOCKED . 
 
  The TOURISTS look up to see, on the horizon, two SPECIAL 
  OPS guys walking rather obviously towards them. 
 
  Slightly panicking, they shove their kit back into the 
  rucksacks and move off down the bank, hidden on both 
  sides... 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 65
 

 
  Special Ops scan a far horizon. Suddenly, a movement! 
 
  SNIPER SIGHT 
 
  Tracks a windcheater -- a man, back turned. 
 
                                    VOICE O.S. 
                          Target in sight. Advise. 
 
                                  ANOTHER VOICE 
                                    Go ahead. 
 
  We hear the click of a safety coming off. But now the man 
  turns -- he s an OLD FARMER! 
 
                                    VOICE O.S. 
                                        Shit! 
 
                                  ANOTHER VOICE 
                                      Advise! 
 
                                    VOICE O.S. 
            I thought this area was cleaned up. I almost 
                            shot a bloody farmer. 
 
  BEHIND A TREE 
 
  The two  TOURISTS  assemble their launch unit--sweaty 
  fingers. So close to their target. So close to death. 
 
  They say a short prayer under their breath-- 
 
  PULLING FOCUS 
 
  We see a tuft of grass rise slightly in the far distance. 
 
  PRONE SPECIAL OPS GUY 
 
  Lies camouflaged brilliantly. Unlocks the safety on his 
  Barrett 82A1 sniper rifle. Eyes unmoving. Frozen. 
 
  BACK BY THE TREE 
 
  A finger moves to the trigger--nearby, a bird has landed. 
 
  THOUGH THE SNIPER SIGHT 
 
  The two men can be seen. But the sight shakes -- and 
  sweeps round to a THIRD MAN in the undergrowth behind the                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 66
 

  targets. This man too has a gun. Another Special forces 
  shooter. 
 
  TWO QUIET RAPPORTS 
 
  And the finger goes limp. The men fall over, shot to the 
  head. So quiet, the bird has not even been disturbed. 
 
 
  TOM, exhausted, is heading home with the laptop. Gets a 
  call. 
 
                                        TOM 
                            What s the atmosphere? 
 
 
  TOM ends the call. Torn. Looks at the laptop. 
 
 
  PATRICK goes into a red phonebox. 
 
 
  (INTERCUT THIS SCENE WITH PATRICK IN THE PHONEBOX) 
 
  TOM shivers in his T-shirt. 
 
  BEHIND HIM 
 
  We can see MAISIE, still inside. She s examining the 
    lock--even fiddling with it. We can t be sure. Doing 
    something. There are now ornate bars over the bay 
  windows. 
 
  As TOM talks, MAISIE shuts the door. Double-locked. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Hello? 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                            It wasn t me, alright? 
 
                                        TOM 
                        What? Patrick? What wasn t? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 70
 

                                      PATRICK 
              It wasn t me, it was the other lads, they 
                        found out--my branch chief-- 
                                    (breaks up) 
                                    gone yet? 
 
                                        TOM 
                              You re breaking up-- 
 
                                      PATRICK 
            --laptop s rigged. The bastards put a slab of 
                                  C4 in there-- 
 
  Cold professionalism takes hold--just-- 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Repeat that. 
 
                                      PATRICK 
          The laptop has six ounces of explosive in it, 
                                      alright? 
 
                                        TOM 
              That s enough to take out half my street! 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                                  Your street?! 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  I m at home! 
 
                                      PATRICK 
            Oh, they thought you d take it into work -- 
                                      sorry -- 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      (sorry????) 
                                Is it a timer? 
 
                                      PATRICK 
            It s a timer. Hidden near the mother board, 
                                left hand side-- 
 
                                        TOM 
                            You stay on the line-- 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                                      I can t--

                                        TOM 
                          You stay on the line--! 
 
  And he s at the door-- hammering hard-- 
 
                                      PATRICK 
                                I ve got to go. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Dammit! 
                                  (BAM BAM BAM!) 
                                        ELLIE! 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                  Jesus, what?! 
 
                                        TOM 
                                Open the door--! 
 
  Pause. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                                        Ellie? 
 
                                    ELLIE O.S. 
                                  Bloody key-- 
                                      (shouting) 
                      It won t work! The key s not-- 
 
                                        TOM 
                                  Try it slowly. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                      Sticky! 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                              Tom, it s still red. 
 
                                        TOM 
            Go to my jacket. My key card s in the left 
                        pocket. Should do it. Hurry! 
 
  TOM races next door -- presses the bell. Meanwhile tries 
  the number again on the mobile. Number unobtainable 
  sound-- then: 
 
                          NEIGHBOUR (UPSTAIRS WINDOW) 
                                        Hello? 
                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 72
 

                                        TOM 
              There s a gas leak. Get out of your house. 
 
                          NEIGHBOUR (UPSTAIRS WINDOW) 
                                        What? 
 
  He sprints to the other neighbour -- rings bell. Nothing. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        It s the gas board. Please! 
 
  He runs back to his door. ELLIE s hand is dangling out of 
  the letterbox with the card. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                            It s not working Tom! 
 
                                        TOM 
              Pass it here, pass it out the letterbox-- 
 
  She passes it out. He takes it. Their hands touch for a 
  second. TOM tries the key from this side. Red light. 
 
  Surely not. He tries again, calmly. Red light. 
 
  And again. Wipes the card clean. Again. Red light. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
            Ellie is there anything in the lock, can you 
                                        see? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                              There s--I m not sure. 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                    I fixed it! 
 
                                  NEIGHBOUR O.S. 
                          You re not from the gas! 
 
  Tilt up briefly--crotchety old NEIGHBOUR now leaning from 
  his front room window. TOM s jaw twitches. 
 
                                        TOM 
                        ..How did you fix it Maisie? 
 
                                        MAISIE 
                                I made it sticky. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Ellie. Listen to me. Get out of the house.                                                   Spooks\Season 1\Episode 6 Page 73
 

                                        Now. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                        Why? 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    (to ELLIE) 
                              Just do what I say. 
                                  (to NEIGHBOUR) 
                      There s a gas leak. A gas leak! 
 
                                      NEIGHBOUR 
                          I ll just get me glasses. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              No! Just get out! 
 
                                      NEIGHBOUR 
              This is what happens when you get gas from 
                      the phone. Oh here they are. 
 
  He discovers his glasses are on his head. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              (into own mobile) 
                            Get Danny on the line. 
                                  (to NEIGHBOUR) 
            Look I m telling you, I m a manager for the 
            gas company and I m ordering you to vacate 
                          your home immediately-- 
 
                                      NEIGHBOUR 
                              Moderate your tone. 
 
                                        ELLIE 
            Tom! We can t get out, everything s locked. 
                          What the hell s going on? 
 
                                        TOM 
                    Try the attic. Get onto the roof. 
 
    Somewhere, someone must have complained about the noise. 
  Because a police car rocks up. POLICEMAN turns up. 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
                    Is there a problem here at all? 
 
                                        TOM 
            I m Security Service. There s a bomb in my 
                                        house.

                                      POLICEMAN 
                You re the fourth I ve met today mate. 
 
                                        TOM 
            My I.D. s inside. I m locked out. Ring the 
                                  bloody number. 
 
                                      POLICEMAN 
                      What number would that be sir? 
 
  TOM is an inch from killing him. 
 
                                        TOM 
                              7946-0001. 7946-0001. 
                                (the PC recoils) 
                                      7946-0001! 
 
  TOM points to the NEIGHBOUR. 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                            And get him out too! 
                                  (reminding PC) 
            Battering ram! Torches. Get a drill team out 
                                    here! Now! 
 
  POLICEMAN barks into his radio--biggest day of his 
  career-- 
 
                                    ELLIE O.S. 
                                        Tom! 
 
  TOM runs back to the front door. TOM checks his watch. 
  It s three minutes to an hour. Whether that s 
    significant, he can t know. But it s not good. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      Ellie-- 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                  It s all blocked off, it s sealed-- 
 
                                        TOM 
                                    (remembering) 
                            Oh, we did that, shit! 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                      (fierce) 
            I m not doing a single thing til you tell me 
                                what s going on!

                                        TOM 
            Listen to me. There s a bomb in the computer 
                                  I brought home. 
 
  She can t speak-- 
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
            Ellie did you hear me? Did you hear what I 
                                        said? 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                                    I heard you. 
 
                                        TOM 
          I ve locked the computer in my filing cabinet 
            in my office. Listen to me carefully. Go to 
              my jacket. In the pocket are my car keys. 
                                      (thinks) 
              There s a red key on there. Get the red key 
          and go to the bottom drawer in my office. And 
                                        then-- 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                          Wait, too much too much-- 
 
                                        TOM 
                  There s a box in the bottom right-- 
 
                                        ELLIE 
                          I said too much! Call me! 
 
                                        TOM 
                                      (shouts) 
                            I m calling you now! 
 
 
  TOM on the phone to DANNY. We see the irate NEIGHBOUR 
  being hauled into a police van in the b.g. 
 
                                      NEIGHBOUR 
                      The trains, the post, the gas! 
 
                                        TOM 
              It s a ThinkPad. Year old. The C4 s on a 
                          timer on the motherboard. 
 
                                        DANNY 
          The internal clock s on a battery. If they ve 
            set it up on that, you can take the battery 
                            out. And you re fine. 
 
                                        TOM 
                                        Great! 
 
                                        DANNY 
              On the other hand, taking the battery out 
            could break the connection and risk setting 
          it off anyway. As could any jarring movement. 
 
                                        TOM 
              Shit -- conference this to my home line. 
 
  TOM sprints to the letterbox  
 
                                  TOM (CONT'D) 
                          Ellie! Try the phone now!
