      Dim lights, seductive music. A Cowboy boot hits the ground as a 
      rugged, middle-aged guy, LARRY, undresses and eagerly lies face 
      up on a massage table. He pulls a thin sheet to just barely 
      cover his crotch as the door opens, revealing RILEY CLARK (late 
      20 s, cute as hell, wearing jeans and a tight t-shirt). 

                                  LARRY
                    I've got a special request today.

                                  RILEY
                    Oh, yeah. How special is it? 

      She grabs his Cowboy hat, puts it on, playful. 

                                  LARRY
                    It's a little embarrassing actually.

      She circles the table, running her finger along the edges.

                                  RILEY
                    Will it make me blush?

                                  LARRY
                    Only one way to find out. 

                                  RILEY
                    Then let's get started Cowboy.

      She grins, grabs the sheet, and yanks it all the way off his 
      body as we hear the LAUGHTER of children. SMASH TO: 


      Modest and homey. Kyle and Riley in the midst of an argument. 

                                  KYLE
                    I don't think you understand how big a 
                    mess we're in! 

                                  RILEY
                    I totally understand, it's all we talk 
                    about anymore. I wanted one fun night 
                    with the family for a change.

                                  KYLE
                    So I'm supposed to fake it? You know I 
                    had zero luck finding a job today and 
                    you're out jacking up our credit cards 
                    when we barely get by on my disability 
                    check!

                                  RILEY
                    I got the jacket for 70% off after 
                    trompin' all over town. Would you 
                    settle down? It's your birthday.

                                  KYLE
                    I can't, babe. I've tried. The bank 
                    called again about our mortgage 
                    payment.
                          (raw and vulnerable now)
                    It's been the worst day of my life.

      Riley, agonizing for him now, moves closer.

                                  RILEY
                    Baby, I know, but things are gonna get 
                    better. I promise. 

                                  KYLE
                    Did your mom have any luck finding you 
                    a job at the salon?

                                  RILEY
                    I'd rather yank my toenails out than 
                    work with my mom. I'll find something. 

                                  KYLE
                    And it won't be enough. I've screwed 
                      everything up so bad! I can t stand how 
                    everyone stares at me now like I'm such--

                                  RILEY
                    Kyle, stop it. That's all in your 
                    head. We re gonna pull through this. 
                    Like we always do. Together. ...loving 
                    each other.

                          (she kisses him)
                    That's what matters, right? 

      A beat. He finally nods. And kisses her back. 

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    So many people don't even have that. 
                          (kissing him again)
                    I love you so much. We're lucky.

      He brushes the hair off her face. Kisses her again. Smiles.  It 
      gets more and more heated. Soon they re undressing, groping, 
      pulling each other down the hallway, stumbling into the bedroom--
      slamming the door shut to block out the world.  


      Kyle s fast asleep, but Riley s wide awake. Finally, she gets 
      up, goes to the window and stares outside. Worried.


      Modern decor. Thirty years ago. Linette's at work in a smock, 
      checking a row of CLIENTS sitting under dryers as she talks to 
      Riley on her cell. 

                                    LINETTE
                    I just don't know how you take it. 
                    He's either moody as hell or flying 
                    off the handle about something. 

      INTERCUT Linette and Riley.

                                  RILEY
                    It's easy, Mama. I love him. He'll be 
                    fine once he finds a job. Everyone's 
                    saying construction's about to rebound.

                                    LINETTE
                    No one I know is sayin' that. They're 
                    all saying it's gonna get even worse. 

                                  RILEY
                    That's really not helpful, Mama.

                                    LINETTE
                    It's reality, Riley. You can't both be 
                    out of work. How long have I been 
                    telling you I don't think you're going 
                    about this the right way?                                 THE RUB   7/31/11                         5

                    Since I was born.

                                    LINETTE
                    Don't get snippy. You need a plan. 
                    You've always let Kyle lead the way. 
                    That's how you got in this mess.

                                  RILEY

                    five times. 

                                    LINETTE
                    I've been married four times. Clyde 
                    was twice and there is nothin' wrong 
                    with tryin' something till you get it 
                    right.
                          (knows this is touchy)
                    I could ask here at the salon? Might 
                    be washing hair for me at first, but--

                                  RILEY
                    Someone's screaming in the house. 
                    Gotta go!

      She clicks off, irritated. Linette looks at her phone. Perturbed. 


      Riley sits in a messy office. Unpacked boxes, files stacked 
      high. She grimaces, but is determined to make the best of this 
      as GEORGIA GAINES (50 s, country gorgeous, big hair, big tits, 
      big personality) enters in tight jeans, heels and a sexy blouse. 

                                    GEORGIA

      She offers it, can't help but stare at Georgia's impressive tits.

                    relax when they look into a fish tank.

                                  RILEY
                    I wasn't aware of that.

                    I like a homey vibe even though we're a 
                    full service spa. We do facials and 
                    nails, but our bread in butter, what 
                    we're known for, is having the best 
                    damn female massage therapists in town.

                    Tell me if I'm wrong, but there's just 
                    something about a woman's touch. 

      Riley smiles, she likes this woman already, as Georgia opens a 
      door and leads her into--

                    up. Not so sure about the men.

                                    GEORGIA
                    The girls hang out here between 
                    clients. They have some mean poker 
                    games if you're into that. I don't 
                    have many rules, but I'm really strict 
                    about one thing. Right girls? 

                                  THE GIRLS
                    Everyone goes home happy!

                                    GEORGIA
                    Love it when they do that. And one 
                    more thing I wanna show you--


      Georgia and Riley enter a closet-sized room with a 2-way mirror 
      view into a massage room next door. 

                                    GEORGIA
                    Did Selena mention our viewing room? 

      She moves so Riley can see through the glass: A MASSAGE GIRL 
      skillfully rubs oil on a CLIENT'S muscled chest. 

                                    GEORGIA (CONT D)
                    All first-timers get put in here. 

      The girl's hands move down to the guy's stomach.

                                    GEORGIA (CONT'D)
                    Just so I can keep an eye on things. 

      The girl seductively peels off the guy's boxers.

                                    GEORGIA (CONT'D)
                          (oblivious)
                    The welfare of my girls has always 
                    been my number one priority.

      Riley stares, her mouth falling open.

                                    GEORGIA (CONT'D)
                    What's wrong, honey? It's just for--                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         10


                                  RILEY
                    There s been a really big mistake. I 
                    had no idea-- 

      Confused, Georgia turns. Sees what Riley is referring to. 

                                    GEORGIA
                    Oh, for God's sake!!!

      Riley whips around to leave and runs RIGHT into a wall! She 
      recovers and bolts out as Georgia rushes after her. 


      Riley speeds down the freeway, on her cell now, pissed. 

                                  RILEY
                    How could you do that to me?! 


      Selena's on her cell, shopping for designer handbags, amused.

                                  SELENA
                    You said you needed a job. How'd you 
                    think I was making so much money?

      INTERCUT Riley and Selena.

                                  RILEY
                    I thought you were working for it. 
                    Like a normal person!                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         11


                                  SELENA
                          (trying out a handbag)
                    Trust me, I give plenty of good ole 
                    fashioned massages, just like the 
                    other girls do, but it didn't take 
                    long to figure out how to make major 
                    bank. I'm totally out of debt now. I 
                    have a cute new condo and I just 
                    booked a week vacation in--Cancun.
                          (so a SALESLADY won't hear)
                    If a guy wants a little "extra" 
                    attention with a release at the end, 
                    so what? Let him pay for it.

                                  RILEY
                    Last time I checked that was called 
                      prostitution. Not the kind of job I 
                    was looking for.

                                  SELENA
                    Your loss. I'm out shopping for a new 
                    handbag I don't really need. What're 
                    you doing?

      Riley considers this. Flares. Hangs up. 


      Riley walks in, eager to see her family. She puts down her keys 
      as her phone chirps with a text. She glances at it: TOOK THE 
      KIDS FOR PIZZA AND A MOVIE. XOXOX, MOM. She looks into the den. 

                                  RILEY
                    Kyle? Honey?


      She searches the bedroom. Empty. The kid's room. No one's there. 
      The backyard. No sign of him. She enters the kitchen, sees an 
      note with her name on it. She quickly opens it: 

      BABE, I JUST CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. I'M SO SORRY. LOVE, KYLE.

      Riley can t breath at first. Her heart starts pounding out of 
      her chest. She rushes to the garage. His car is gone. To his 
      closet. His suitcase and clothes are missing. To their medicine 
      cabinet. His side is totally empty. OFF Riley, floored. 


      Riley paces, manic. A KNOCK at the door. She rushes over, opens it 
      to find Kyle s hunky, but shy best friend, EVAN ATKINS.

                                  EVAN
                    I got here fast at I could. You OK?

                                  RILEY
                    He hasn't called you or anything?                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         12


                                  EVAN
                    No, I tried his cell. It's been 
                      disconnected. What the hell's going on?

      She hands him the note. He quickly reads it, upset. 

                                  EVAN (CONT'D)
                    I told him yesterday I was gonna talk 
                    to Coolidge again about giving him his 
                    job back. He seemed fine.

                                  RILEY
                    He barely goes to the store without 
                    telling me. What am I gonna go, Evan?

      Evan, heart breaking for her, takes her in his arms.

                                  EVAN
                    He'll come back. I'm sure he will.

                                  RILEY
                    What if there's someone else?

      Evan pulls away. There's something really sweet and substantial 
      about this guy. 

                                  EVAN
                    There's no way in hell. Kyle's totally 
                    in love with you. Always has been.

                                  RILEY
                    Then how could he do this to me?

      Evan shakes his head. With no idea. As Linette walks in with the 
      twins, returning from the movie. 

                                    LINETTE
                    Hey, Evan. Cute shirt. What's up?

      One look at Riley tells her something is terribly wrong. 


      Riley s camped out on the sofa, utterly drained and wrecked, 
      surrounded by her mom and her best friends since high school: 
      PADMA (fun and single) and LACEY (bossy and married). 

                                  LACEY
                    Sweetie, there's nothing else you can 
                    do tonight. The kids are fast asleep.

                                  PADMA
                    They have no idea anything's wrong. 

                                  LACEY
                    The police have all Kyle's 
                      information. Padma and I are gonna 
                    sleep over tonight so you can--

                                  RILEY
                    Guys, you really don't need to.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         13


                                  PADMA
                          (pouring Riley some wine)
                    Oh yes we do. I brought Xanax for all 
                    of us! Linette, should we open another 
                    bottle of wine?

                                    LINETTE
                    Were you reading my mind?

                                  LACEY
                    Drugs and wine?

                                  PADMA
                    Give it a break, Lacey, she frazzled. 

                                    LINETTE
                    We all are. It's been a day from hell. 
                          (trying to be strong)
                    We'll have a sleep over! Just like 
                    high school. I'll make s'mores!

      She heads off. As Padma and Lacey sit on either side of Riley to 
      comfort her as we MOVE tight on Riley's face. The look in her 
      eyes says it all. This has been the worst day of her entire life.


      Linette cuts the twins' hair as they eat popsicles. Riley's at 
      the island, going thru stacks of meticulously organized bills. 

                                  RILEY
                    They said they can't turn it back on 
                    till I pay the bill.

                                    LINETTE
                    I can't even watch my soaps when I'm 
                      babysitting now?

                                  RILEY
                    Mama, please. And I really need you 
                    tomorrow, too, so I can look for work. 

                                    LINETTE
                    I can't take another day off. I'm 
                    broke now too. 

      The phone RINGS. Riley grabs it in frustration. 

                                  RILEY
                    Hello?
                          (faux cheerful)
                    Mr. Andrews. Thanks for calling back. 

      She heads into the den for privacy. Hopeful.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         14


                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    Did you get a chance to evaluate my-- 
                    Yes, I know we've already had one 
                      extension, but-- What happens if we 
                    can t pay the mortgage by then? 

      She s told something she doesn t want to hear. She glances back 
      into the kitchen where her mom is goofing around with the twins. 
      Her eyes fill with tears, completely overwhelmed. 


      Riley leans against the closed door, on her cell. 

                                  RILEY
                    Miss Gaines? Oh, hi. It's Riley Clark. 
                    Right, the bolter. Look, I'm really 
                      embarrassed about that. I know it's 
                    been a while. But I was...wondering. 
                          (she bites her lip)
                    How much could I make a week at your 
                    spa? 

      She hears a number that clearly jolts her.

      Riley and Georgia head down the hall. Riley s first day of work. 

                                  RILEY
                    I need to make two things very clear. 
                    I've got kids, they're a priority. My 
                    schedule has to be flexible. Secondly, 
                    there's no way in hell I'm having sex 
                    with anybody. 

                                    GEORGIA
                          (amused)
                    Honey, first of all, lots of our gals 
                    have kids. This job is all about 
                      flexibility. I run a completely legit 
                      establishment. Be that as it may, you 
                    girls are captain of your own ships when 
                    you get behind closed doors. I make my 
                    money booking out the rooms. 

      She grins as if this somehow explains everything. OFF Riley, 
      realizing this is a woman who likes to play it both ways.  


      They enter and Georgia takes Riley over to her locker as Kendra, 
      Jolene, Selena and Dee Ann glance over as they prepare for work. 

                                  SELENA
                    OhmyGod, you changed your mind!

      She rushes over and gives Riley a big hug like they're best 
      friends. Riley forces a smile as Kendra comes over.

                                  KENDRA
                    We heard what happened during your 
                      interview. That must have been so 
                      embarrassing.

                                  JOLENE
                    I've worked here nine years, that kind 
                    of thing is strictly forbidden here. 

                                  DEE ANN
                          (knowingly)
                    I don't know if I'd use the word 
                    strictly. 

                                    GEORGIA
                    Dee Ann, enough. I explained to Riley 
                    how things work. There's a reason 
                      discretion's one of my favorite words. 

                                  DEE ANN
                    Georgia gives us lots of free rein.

                                  JOLENE
                    Too much, if you ask me.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         16

                          (with a smile)
                    No one did, Jolene. Y'all help Riley 
                    get settled in. And could y'all 
                      straighten up some like I've asked a 
                    million times? Riley, I picked a 
                    really nice fella to be your first 
                    client. He'll be here at ten. 

      She smiles and walks out. Selena whispers to Riley.

                                  SELENA
                    We pretty much do whatever we want. 
                    You're gonna love it! 
                          (to the others)
                    Y'all, Riley has the hottest husband. 
                    He played football at U.T. How is he? 

      The girls perk up, curious about Riley s relationship status. 
      Riley has no intention of letting these girls get to know her. 

                                  RILEY

                    back. I m on my own now.

                    That's not very nice, Selena. 
                          (to Riley, sincere)
                    Sorry to hear that, hon. I've always 
                    been on my own.

                    put out a little effort.

                    Isn't that adorable?

      OFF Riley--unnerved by this new world she's entering.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         17



      Riley gives an intense and efficient sports massage to HANK 
      (clean cut/40's) as he lies on his stomach. Hank frowns.

                                  HANK
                    Uh, can you make it a little more... 
                    gentle? And sensuous please.

                                  RILEY
                    Oh, sure.

      She kneads his back with long, assured, sensuous strokes.

                                  HANK
                    Mmm, that's better. Lower.

      Riley's hands move down his back toward his ass. 

                                  RILEY
                    So Hank, do you uh come here a lot?

                                  HANK
                    Every Tuesday. Never miss a week. 

                                  RILEY
                    It's my first day.

                                  HANK
                    Georgia told me. That's why I chose 
                    you. ...can I turn over now?

                                  RILEY
                    Sure.

      He turns over, glancing at her expectantly. Riley adjusts the 
      sheet so it's covering his crotch. He sucks in his gut.

                                  HANK
                    Damn, you're really pretty. 

                                  RILEY
                          (making an effort)
                    Thanks. You're cute yourself.

      He grins, encouraged, and reaches over to grab her ass. Riley 
      quickly takes his hand and places it back on the table. 

                                  RILEY (CONT'D)
                    Relax, Hank. Lemme do my job.

      He squints. Huh? She massages his arms now.

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    So, you married?

                                  HANK
                    Yeah. Unfortunately.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         18


                                  RILEY
                    That's not very nice.

                                  HANK
                    My wife and my kids are a pain in the 
                    ass. This is the one thing I do all 
                    week that's just for myself.

                                  RILEY
                          (engaged now)
                    Maybe that's part of the problem? You 
                    need more outside interests.

      Hank looks at her. Is she for real? 

                                  RILEY (CONT'D)
                    I'm just sayin' you gotta have 
                    balance, right? Or you start blaming 
                    everyone else for something you need 
                    to work on yourself. What exactly 
                    makes your wife so difficult? 

      Beat. Hank pops up.

                                  HANK
                    OK, this is not what I had in mind. 

      He tries to leave, but Riley blocks his way.

                                  RILEY
                    Wait, what's wrong? I'm sorry. 

                                  HANK
                    I'll ask Georgia for Selena. 

                                  RILEY
                    No, please. I told her I could handle 
                    this. I really need this job, Hank. 

                                  HANK
                    Then you should know the girls who 
                    don't give extras don't last very long 
                    here. And I had a really great tip for 
                    you. But I'm not in the mood anymore. 

      He moves for the door dejected. Tight on Riley--in a split 
      second she makes her decision. She grabs his arm.

                                  RILEY
                    Then we'll have to get you in the mood 
                    again. Trust me, Hank, I know how.

      There's something in the way she says it that's both playful and 
      assured. She sits him back on the table. Intent.

                                  RILEY (CONT'D)
                      Everyone's gonna go home really happy.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         19


      Hank swallows. Riley steels herself, dims the lights. She 
      unbuttons her jeans and slowly takes them off to expose her 
      cotton briefs. She shoots him a grin. There's something both 
      hesitant and seductive in the way she does it. 

                                  HANK
                    Now you're talking.

      He moves for her, but Riley holds a finger up to stop him. 

                                  RILEY
                    I have rules.

      Hank nods. Way turned on. As Riley moves towards him and Dolly 
      Parton's "The Track of My Tears" begins to play, taking us to--


      Riley makes the long drive home in the dark. Light from the street 
      streaks off her face. A myriad of emotions as she replays the 
      events of the day: she s amused, astounded, exhilarated, ashamed. 

                                  ON THE RADIO
                    "Just take a good look at my face. 
                    You'll see my smile looks out of 
                    place. If you look close it's easy to 
                    trace. The track of my tears--" 

      Riley glances at an envelope packed with cash on the seat beside 
      her. She suddenly SCREAMS in anger, swerves to the side of the 
      road. Stops. And just sits there, fighting to catch her breath 
      as a more upbeat COUNTRY song comes on, taking us to--


      Riley, Linette and the twins practice a country western line 
      dance in the living room. Step, step, clap, clap, foot tap, 
      lasso, spin! Travis is a natural and loves every minute. Katie 
      struggles and finally gives up, turning off the music.

                                  KATIE
                    This is so lame. I hate it!

                                  RILEY
                    Honey, you're doing so much better.

                                  KATIE
                    Anything would be better than--
                          (gagging like she's sick)
                    country western.

                                    LINETTE
                    Katie, that's not very lady-like.

                                  TRAVIS
                    The class voted, country western won. 

                                  KATIE
                    Doesn't mean I have to do it.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         20


                                  RILEY
                      Everyone's doing it, Katie.
                          (kissing her)
                    We can rehearse more tomorrow.

                        TRAVISKATIE
      Can we Skype daddy and show  hasn't daddy called us, *Why
      him our routine?*Mommie?

      Riley glances at Linette, unsettled. She acts nonchalant.

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    Daddy's crazy busy looking for a new 
                    job. He has to focus on that now. Just 
                    like y'all have to focus on getting 
                    ready for Spring Sing. But he told me 
                    to give you both extra big hugs and 
                    tickles tonight! 

      She grabs them both and tickles them ferociously. The twins 
      squeal and wrestle around with her as Linette watches. 


      Riley and her mom have some wine and cheese after the kids have 
      gone to bed. Riley's straightening up the kitchen. 

                                    LINETTE
                    So, how was your new job today?

                                  RILEY
                    Um, good. Great.  

                                    LINETTE
                    That's not very specific. Would you 
                    stop being so anal and talk to me?

                                  RILEY
                          (stops cleaning up)
                    It's nice, Mama. Kinda fancy, one of 
                    those, you know, high end places. The 
                    commute's a pain, but I think the tips 
                    are gonna be really big. I mean good. 

      She smiles. Her mom only slightly aware that she's acting weird.

                                    LINETTE
                    I never understood how you could stand 
                    rubbing stranger s bare skin all day. 

                                  RILEY
                    You cut hair all day. It's not that 
                      different. 

                                    LINETTE
                    It's totally different. They're not 
                    naked for one thing. I just don't see 
                    any future in it. I begged you to stay 
                    in school and get a degree in 
                    something useful.                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         21


                                  RILEY
                    I'm lucky to have this. My career is 
                    very "useful". And no one's "naked", 
                    they're covered with a sheet.

                                    LINETTE
                    That's naked as far as I'm concerned.

      Riley really doesn't want to get into this. 

                                  RILEY
                    So, how were the kids today? 

                                    LINETTE
                    I think it's time you tell 'em about 
                    their daddy.

                                  RILEY
                    ...I'm not ready yet. I'm praying 
                    he'll come back. And they'll never 
                    have to know. 

                                    LINETTE
                    I had that same feeling when your 
                    daddy abandoned me. 

                                  RILEY
                    Daddy died of a stroke. It's not the 
                    same thing.

                                    LINETTE
                    It felt the same. He left me all alone 
                    with an 8-year-old to raise. But I 
                    bounced right back, didn t I?

                                  RILEY
                            (astounded/amused)
                    You married someone else three months 
                    later!

                                    LINETTE
                    That's quite a bounce, now isn't it?

      Riley shakes her head. Her mother never ceases to amaze her.

                                    LINETTE (CONT D)
                    I know things are tough, but you need 
                    to open up to whatever the next 
                    chapter of your life might be. 

      Riley shoots her a bemused smile. If she only knew.


      Riley brushes her teeth. She finishes and stares at herself in 
      the mirror, tears welling. 

                                  RILEY
                    Just bring him back, God. Please. I 
                    won t even ask why he left.                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         22



      Georgia s working at her messy desk as Riley enters with a knock.

                                  RILEY
                    You wanted to see me, Georgia?

                                    GEORGIA
                    Hey, honey. Just wanted to say I'm 
                    gettin' great feedback on you. 

                                  RILEY
                    That's nice to hear. 

                                    GEORGIA
                    Clients tell me you're not like the 
                    other girls. ...exactly what are you 
                    doin' with them?

      Riley's embarrassed, or is it evasive? 

                                  RILEY
                    Just a good ole massage. 

      She looks for a place to sit, but every chair's piled with stuff. 

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    Look, I was hoping I could add a few 
                    more shifts. I really need the money.

                                    GEORGIA
                    Sure, honey. The girls mentioned you 
                    were on your own. How long since you 
                    and your hubby split up?

      Riley wasn't expecting this. Beat. She lies. 

                                  RILEY
                    A year and half ago. 

                                    GEORGIA
                    That's tough. My husband took off 
                    three years ago this August. With a 
                    good friend of mine who worked here. 
                    Never even saw it coming.

                                  RILEY
                    I'm sorry to hear that.

      She starts clearing off of one of the chairs.

                                    GEORGIA
                    His loss. But trust me, running this 
                    place is a lot harder than it looks. 
                    My husband used to handle all the 
                    upkeep and finances. Now bills keep 
                    piling high, getting lost and unpaid. 
                    I'd swear this place is growing things 
                    if I didn't know better! Here, lemme 
                    help you with that.                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         23


      They clear off the chair together.

                                  RILEY
                    I could easily help you straighten up 
                    around here. You're really not 
                    utilizing the space. And your bills 
                    should all be on Auto-Pay so you don't 
                    get behind. But it's really none of my 
                    business. Just makes things easier.

                                    GEORGIA
                    I'm all for easy. Have at it, honey. 

                                  RILEY
                    Really?

      Georgia nods. Riley smiles and heads over to the desk to get to 
      work. Georgia watches her, impressed. 


      Riley eats crab legs with Padma and Lacey.

                                  LACEY
                    So, you like this new place better 
                    than working at the country club?

                                  RILEY
                    God, yeah. It's not nearly as uptight. 
                    I'm crazy about the owner and the 
                    clients are really nice so far.

                                  PADMA
                    Remember that one guy you had at the 
                    country club, two minutes into every 
                    massage he gets a huge--

      She tilts her crab leg up like a fierce erection.

                                  LACEY
                    Padma, that's gross! I'd never let 
                    Dale get massaged by another woman. 

                                  PADMA
                    Why not? He d come home relaxed. And 
                    horny.

                                  LACEY
                    Dale comes home horny enough as it is. 
                    Call me a prude, I don't think married 
                    men should be getting "massaged" by 
                    anyone except their wives. 

                                  PADMA
                    You're a prude then. 

                                  RILEY
                    Really, Lace. People need to be 
                    touched more, not less.                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         24


                                  PADMA
                    At work the only rubbing I get offered 
                    is from guys in my wing in their 70 s 
                    bragging how Viagra has changed their 
                    lives. And perfectly willing to show 
                    me the results. Talk about crab legs!

      She waves her crab leg again like it's really old but horny. 
      Riley and Lacey laugh and groan, then it gets quiet again.

                                  LACEY
                          (knows this is touchy)
                    Have you heard anything about Kyle? 

                                  RILEY
                          (beat, shakes her head)
                    The police said there's really nothing 
                    else they can do since the note made 
                    it clear he left of his own volition. 
                    I keep thinking he's gonna walk in the 
                    door one night. With some incredible 
                    excuse for leaving that somehow makes 
                    sense. Or I get so mad at him I can 
                    barely breathe. I'd never in a million 
                    years do this to someone I love.  
                          (she wipes away tears)
                    I don't care how much pain I was in. 

                                  LACEY
                    Sweetie, when we were cheerleaders who 
                    was always the bossiest and most 
                    organized with all the best ideas? 

                                  PADMA
                    You were, Lacey.

                                  LACEY
                    Besides me!

                                  RILEY
                    I was.

                                  LACEY
                    Exactly. And hard as it is for me to 
                    admit, you were the one everyone 
                    looked up to. 

                                  PADMA
                    With the biggest future ahead of them. 

                                  RILEY
                    I've pretty much screwed that up. 

                                  PADMA
                    Please. You're not even thirty yet! 

                                  LACEY
                    We just know you're gonna find a way 
                    to pull through this. 

      Riley searches them. And smiles. Yes, indeed she is. Donna 
      Summer's "She Works Hard For The Money" comes up as we CUT TO--                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         25



      Riley with one CLIENT after another. (Note: this should be 
      stylized and fun, yet a realistic view of what her day is like. 
      Riley in a different sexy, yet somewhat tasteful outfit with each 
      client. Playing out her fantasies as well as giving them theirs. 
      Or in a Rub t-shirt and shorts when giving legit massages.) 

      A seductive strip tease for an OLDER GUY. A deep, professional 
      stretch for a PREGNANT WOMAN. Just chatting with a COLLEGE BOY. 
      Dripping massage oil down a lean stomach. A playful whisper to a 
      FAT GUY. Her chest moves just inches from a HANDSOME FACE. It's 
      all a seductive dance, a drawn out tease.

      CLIENTS are moaning, toes are curling, a hand grips the sheet. An 
      OLDER LADY is asleep, blissfully snoring. Riley's intense focus  
      as we move faster and faster now. She's really good at this! 
      Breaking a sweat as bigger and bigger tips are left on the table. 
      We get the feeling each client gets something special-
      personalized, unexpected. She's doing everything possible to give 
      them pleasure, except actually having sex with them. 

      Ending with a shot of Riley, exhausted, massaging the thighs of 
      a BURLY CLIENT whose hand is under the sheet pleasuring himself-- 
      as they hear a sudden CRASH and SCREAM in the hallway! 

                                  BURLY GUY
                    What the fu--!

      He bolts up as Riley pulls on a robe and opens the door to peek 
      outside. There s some sort of ruckus at the end of the hallway. 

                                  RILEY
                    Stay right there.

      But the guy isn't taking any chances, he grabs his clothes and 
      hauls ass past her for the rear exit. But something about the 
      SCREAMING intrigues Riley. 


      She enters the hallway and heads toward the fray. Georgia, 
      Selena and Kendra are in a major confrontation with a drunk and 
      unhinged, well-dressed woman, VALERIE PETERS (mid-40's). She s 
      ripping things off the wall--kicking, slapping, screaming. 

                        VALERIEGEORGIA
      No! Get away, you're gonna Selena, grab her arm! 
      regret it!

                          SHERIKENDRA
      I'm trying, damn it!You need to go home, Mrs. 
                                                    Peters!

                                    GEORGIA
                    Valerie, I want you out of here! Now!

                                    VALERIE
                    I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE! I know what 
                    goes on here and I'm calling the cops!  

      OFF Riley, stunned, what the hell?  END OF ACT TWO.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         26


                                            ACT THREE


      Where we left off. Riley rushes in to help Georgia and Selena 
      try to subdue Valerie as she rips pictures off the walls. 

                                    VALERIE
                    I know what Jared does here!!

                                    GEORGIA
                    You don't know a damn thing. 

                                    VALERIE
                    I heard him bragging to his poker 
                    buddies about all the "happy endings" 
                    he gets here! It's nothing but a 
                      whorehouse!

      Georgia and Riley manage to grab her arms and subdue her. 

                                    GEORGIA
                    That's a helluva ugly allegation. Only 
                    thing I see illegal here is you 
                      destroying private property! 

                                    VALERIE
                    Ouch, you're hurting my arm!

                                    GEORGIA
                    Surprised you can feel it you're so 
                    soused up. Selena, call her a cab and 
                    get her home to sleep this off. 

                                  VICTORIA
                    You haven't heard the end of this!

                                    GEORGIA
                    Yes I have. Nighty night!

      Kendra and Selena haul Valerie out to the reception area. Riley 
      looks at Georgia, unnerved. 

                                    GEORGIA (CONT D)
                    Honey, she's all bark. She's made 
                    crazy threats before.

                                  RILEY
                    Before? Does her husband know?

                                    GEORGIA
                      I seriously doubt it. I have a strict 
                    don't ask, don't tell policy when 
                    comes to husbands and wives. If she's 
                    not happy in her marriage let her go 
                    fix it. Not my problem. 

                                  RILEY
                    It will be if she goes to the police.                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         27


                                    GEORGIA
                    Trust me, no way she s gonna risk her 
                    status in town telling everyone what 
                    her husband does here twice a week. 
                    She's president of Jr. League, for 
                    God's sake. 

      Riley absorbs this. But something about this woman's pain is  
      familiar.

                                    GEORGIA (CONT D)
                    Hey, don't forget, margaritas over at 
                    my place after work. First Day of 
                    Spring Party.

                                  RILEY
                    I really can't. Long drive home.

                                    GEORGIA
                    Lame excuse. I insist.


      Riley walks in exhausted from work and heads into the den. 
      Gasps. Evan is waiting for her on the sofa.

                                  RILEY
                    What the hell are you doing here? 

                                  EVAN
                    Your mom let me in. She and the kids  
                    went to bed. I have news about Kyle.

                                  RILEY
                          (flashing with hope)
                    What is it? What happened? 

                                  EVAN
                    A woman at work I'm friendly with said 
                    someone called her today about getting 
                    their disability benefits mailed to a 
                    P.O. Box in Colorado. She told him it 
                    has to be a street address. The guy 
                    wouldn t leave his name or number, but 
                    she said he sounded exactly like Kyle. 

                                  RILEY
                          (defensive)
                    That doesn t mean anything. It 
                    could ve been anybody. 

                                  EVAN
                    She knew him, Riley. She remembers the 
                    day he hurt his knee. It means he's 
                    out there somewhere trying to scrounge 
                    up money without calling anyone back 
                    home he supposedly cares about!                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         29


                                  RILEY
                    OK, you're pissing me off now. Kyle 
                    would never do that. 

                                  EVAN
                    But he would leave you high and dry 
                    with nothing but a note? He blew me 
                    off, too, but at least this means he's 
                    alive. 

      Riley absorbs this, manages a nod.

                                  EVAN (CONT'D)
                    But you have to be realistic now. He's 
                    made his choice. From now on you have 
                    to do what's best for you and twins. 

      He just stares at her now. It s obvious he has feelings for her, 
      but is incredibly conflicted because of the circumstances. 

                                  RILEY
                    I need to go to bed now, Evan. 

                                  EVAN
                    I didn't mean to upset you. 

                                  RILEY
                    I'm fine. Let's talk later. 

      He nods. She nods. They just stand there a moment. Then he turns 
      and leaves. Riley watches after him. Not so sure how to handle 
      this friendship anymore.


      Selena's doing her nails. Dee Ann and Kendra are on Lifecycles.

                                  SELENA
                    I had Mrs. Daniels again. She is the 
                    worst! Every week it's a different 
                    ailment she expects me to 
                      "miraculously" heal with an hour 
                    massage. And she barely tips.

                                  DEE ANN
                    That's weird. Her husband's very 
                    generous. And easy to please. If you 
                    know what I mean. 

                                  KENDRA
                          (knowingly)
                    And you've got the gift cards from 
                    Neiman Marcus in Houston to prove it. 

                                  SELENA
                    Why can't I find a guy like that? 
                    First thing I'd do is ditch this job 
                    and get the hell outta Sugarland.

                                  KENDRA
                    So, he's gotta be rich now, too?                                THE RUB   7/31/11                         30


                                  SELENA
                    And gorgeous. Girl, I have standards.

                                  DEE ANN
                          (giving her shit)
                    How's that working out for you so far?

      Selena shoots her a dirty look. Kendra laughs as Riley walks in 
      for work and heads to her locker to change.

                                  RILEY
                    'morning, y'all.

      The girls AD LIB hellos. (Note: Jolene is not in this scene.)

                                  KENDRA
                    You gotta open yourself up to a 
                    broader spectrum of men, Selena. 
                    Bobby's not rich. Or gorgeous.   
                          (simply)
                    And I'm totally in love anyway. 

      This gets an ahhhh from the girls. 

                                  KENDRA (CONT'D)
                    And, trust me, every trick I've 
                    learned here about pleasuring men-- 
                    gets put to use in our bedroom!

      Dee Ann hoots and high fives Kendra as she gets off the 
      Lifecycle to grab a bottle of water. Riley's curious now.

                                  RILEY
                    So your boyfriend knows what goes on 
                    with you and your clients here?

                                  KENDRA
                    Girl, do I look like a fool? That's 
                    nobody's business but my own. It's not 
                    all my clients anyway. Just a few. 

      But Dee Ann is more blunt.

                                  DEE ANN
                    My husband knows exactly what I do to 
                    get big tips here. I love mixing it 
                    up. He loves the fact I make great 
                    money doing something I enjoy.
                          (shrugs)
                    It turns him on.

      Riley doesn't flinch, but this is obviously blowing her mind.  

                                  KENDRA
                    What about you, Riley?

                                  RILEY
                    What about what?                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         31


                                  DEE ANN
                    What kind of "extras" do you offer 
                    your clientele?

      The girls look at each other, amused. They're obviously the 
      group at the spa that doesn't have a problem with this. 

                                  RILEY
                    I don't really...massage and tell.

                                  KENDRA
                    Oh come on! The three of us are cool.
                          (quieter)
                    We know who does and doesn't around 
                    here. Just like Georgia does. So she 
                    knows who to match with who.

                                  SELENA
                    Just don't say anything around Jolene. 
                    She thinks it's her duty to police the 
                    place since she's been here the 
                    longest. 

      Dee Ann gets off her Lifecycle, heads over to Riley.

                                  DEE ANN
                    What's the story? Your clients look 
                    crazy happy when they come out of 
                    their sessions with you.

                                  KENDA
                    All blissed-out goofy and drained--

      She imitates a totally blissed out, goofy guy. The girls laugh.

                                  DEE ANN
                          (to Riley)
                    How far do you go?

      Now the other girls are really interested. As if Riley's being 
      challenged to enter their secret club. 

                                  RILEY
                      Just...far enough. Crap, gotta go!

      She grins and heads out. Leaving the girls without an answer.


      Riley and Linette watch as the twins try on new boots.                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         32

                    It's Italian Night at church. Might be 
                    fun to take the kids for dinner. 
                    There's a little talk. A few songs.

                                  RILEY
                    Sounds fun. What do you think kids?

      The twins barely look up from their boots.

                                  RILEY (CONT'D)
                    You guys are awfully quiet today.

                                  TRAVIS
                    Katie screwed up at Spring Sing 
                    practice again. She's gonna ruin 
                      everything if she can't learn it 
                    right. 

                                  RILEY
                    Katie, we can work on it some when we--

                                  KATIE
                    It won't make any difference.

                                  RILEY
                    Yes it will. You're gonna be great.
                          (tousling her hair)
                    Some things just take a little extra 
                    practice. Travis will help, too. 

                                  TRAVIS
                    No I won't. It's embarrassing. She's 
                    the only kid who can't do it.

                                  RILEY
                    Travis, don't talk to your sister that 
                    way. We all have different talents and 
                      interests. Right Mama? That's what 
                    makes life so interesting.

                                    LINETTE
                    Well, I'm not sure about that. But I 
                      definitely like these snakeskin boots 
                    best. 

                                  TRAVIS
                    It's fake snakeskin, Mee Maw!

                                    LINETTE
                    Excuse me. Wouldn't wanna kill a 
                    snake.

                                  KATIE
                          (shoves her boots away)
                    Just save your money, Mommie. I don't 
                    want 'em anymore. 

                                  RILEY
                    Katie, it's the last thing you need 
                    for your costume. You're gonna be the 
                    prettiest cowgirl up there.                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         33


      Katie won't look at her. 

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    Mama, why don't you take Travis to the 
                    church thing tonight? I'm gonna hang 
                    out with Katie some. 

                                    LINETTE
                          (grabs Travis, playful)
                    It's a date! 

      OFF Riley, worried about Katie. 


      Country MUSIC plays. FIND Riley and Katie alone in the den as 
      Riley patiently helps Katie practice the line dance. 

                                  RILEY
                    That's better, sweetie. And one two 
                    clap, clap, foot tap, hee-haw!

      Katie slowly gets the hang of it. She looks at her mom. Smiles.


      Georgia works the desk as Riley enters to check her schedule. 

                                    GEORGIA
                    Honey, your two-o-clock cancelled. I 
                    booked you a new client. Jared Peters.
                          (whispers)
                    Valerie's husband. 

      A slight jolt as this registers with Riley. She turns to glance 
      through the glass doorway to the men's waiting room and sees 
      JARED PETERS, a nice-looking, but slightly paunchy guy in his 
      40 s, waiting for her with a smile. 


      Jared s on his stomach as Riley gives him a deep tissue back 
      massage. Her mind racing with the realization that this is the 
      man who s wife was so incensed. 

                                  JARED
                    Feels good. I heard you were amazing. 
                    I love trying out the new girls. 

                                  RILEY
                    Yeah, I heard.

                                  JARED
                    Excuse me?

                                  RILEY
                    Nothing. Just relax.

                                  JARED
                    I'm ready to turn over. I'm really 
                    tense in my upper thigh/groin area.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         34


      Riley rolls her eyes as Jared turns over. She covers him to the 
      waist with the sheet as he looks her over. 

                                  JARED (CONT D)
                    Wanna get more comfortable for me? 

      Riley knows the drill. She strips to a tank and cotton panties 
      for him. He likes what he sees as she massages his legs. 

                                  JARED (CONT D)
                    So, where'd you work before this?

                                  RILEY
                    Here and there. Lots of places.

                                  JARED
                    Single or married?

                                  RILEY
                    That's really none of your business.

                                  JARED
                    Just curious. Single, right? 

                                  RILEY
                    Yeah, happily. 

                                  JARED
                    You don't want a boyfriend?

                                  RILEY
                    You sure are chatty.

                                  JARED
                    I don't get much conversation at home.

      This gets Riley's interest. 

                                  RILEY
                    Oh yeah, why not?

      He shrugs, but surprises her by opening up. 

                                  JARED
                    My wife--doesn't have much interest in 
                    me anymore. Besides blaming me for 
                    anything that goes wrong. So I end up 
                    spending a lot of time here.

                                  RILEY
                    What do you think went wrong?

                                  JARED
                    With my wife?

                                  RILEY
                          (slaps him playfully)
                    With your marriage, silly.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         35


                                  JARED
                          (more vulnerable now)
                    She stopped...really listening a long 
                    time ago. We got married really young. 
                    You couldn't keep us off each other 
                    back then. She was so into me. And I 
                    was so in love with her. 
                          (just the truth)
                    Still am. 

      This surprises Riley. Saddens her, especially after what she s 
      going through with Kyle. She moves to massage his arms now. 

                                  RILEY
                    Then you ve gotta make her listen. You 
                    can't just give up. You ve gotta find 
                    a way to explain what you feel so she 
                    can know what you need. She can t read 
                    your mind.

                                  JARED
                    And I can't read hers. I have no idea 
                    what she wants anymore. 

                                  RILEY
                    Then you've gotta find out.

      He looks at her now. She brushes a strand of hair off his face 
      and sees he s actually just a sweet and lonely guy who wants 
      someone to talk to. He smiles.

                                  JARED
                    I'm glad I got you today.

      She smiles back at him. An unexpected moment of connection.

                                  RILEY
                    I'm glad you did, too. 

      LATER--

      Riley's alone after Jared's left. She finds a $500 tip under the 
      sheets. Damn! A big smile on her face as upbeat MUSIC comes up:


      She drives home, windows down. Hopeful for a change.


      She shops and buys a pretty new dress.


      She showers. The water feels so good.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         36



      She dresses in her new dress, checks her look in the mirror.


      She strides in, goes straight to her MORTGAGE BANKER who is busy 
      at his desk. And pays her mortgage. In cash. MUSIC/MONTAGE ends. 


      Georgia's working the front desk. (Dee Ann's in the background, 
      feeding the fish.) As Riley walks in and heads over to the desk. 

                                  RILEY
                    Georgia, can I talk to you a sec?

                                    GEORGIA
                    Hey, honey. What's up?

                                  RILEY
                    Look I think I'm starting to get the 
                    hang of this. Feel free to give me all 
                    the extra shifts you want. Pile 'em 
                    on.

                                    GEORGIA
                    Sure thing. Fellas can't seem to get 
                    enough of you. 

                                  RILEY
                    And you could do all the scheduling 
                    online instead of that tattered old 
                    book of yours. Much more efficient. 
                    Just so you know.

                                    GEORGIA
                    I'll keep that in mind, honey. 

      OFF Dee Ann, overhearing this. And not at all pleased about it. 


      Riley drives home, lost in thought. She turns onto her street. 
      Looks out, squints-- 


      The twins watch TV in the den. Riley helps Linette make dinner. 

                                  RILEY
                    Mama, would you please quit asking 
                    Evan favors? And stop blabbing about 
                    my finances. It's nobody's business 
                    but my own.

                                    LINETTE
                    Don't be so sensitive. He's happy your 
                    new job's working out so well. And so 
                    am I. He definitely looks better with 
                    his shirt off, huh?

                                  RILEY
                    I didn't notice.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         40


                                    LINETTE
                    Oh, right. You always noticed the boys 
                    with the best bodies. That's why you 
                    chose Kyle. You never gave a flip 
                    about brains. 

                                  RILEY
                    That is so not true. 

                                    LINETTE
                          (re: Evan)
                    You never know, the Lord works in 
                      mysterious ways. 

                                  RILEY
                    You're the one who works in mysterious 
                    ways. Kyle s barely been gone a month. 
                    How can you say something like that?

                                    LINETTE
                    Oh, so you wanna be giving massages 
                    the rest of your life?

      Riley glares. Boy, is this loaded. 

                                  RILEY
                    Can we please just drop this and have 
                    a nice dinner?

                                    LINETTE
                    Actually, there's something I wanna 
                    discuss with you. 

      Riley stops what she's doing. Oh God, what now?

                                    LINETTE (CONT D)
                    I know it's not the best timing with 
                    all you're going through, but--
                          (no easy way to say it)
                    I met someone. At church!

      Riley is speechless.

                                    LINETTE (CONT D)
                    We've been seeing each other a little 
                    over a month. That's why I wanted 
                    y'all to come to Italian Night with 
                    me. To meet Mario.

      Riley sits down, floored. And she thought she had secrets. 

                                  RILEY
                    Wow. ...so, what's he like?

                                    LINETTE
                    Baldish, but really cute. Divorced 
                      twice--which is a negative, but who am 
                    I to judge? 
                          (excited)
                    He works over at the Toyota/Prius 
                      Dealership by the mall and loves the 
                    Lord! I really want you to meet him.                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         41


      Riley manages a nod. But we sense this throws yet another wrench 
      in her desire to keep her life private and contained now.


      Riley enters with a glass of wine, lonely, and upset from her 
      talk with her mom, when she sees Kyle come out of the bathroom, 
      fresh from a shower, in nothing but a towel. She gasps. 

                                  KYLE
                    Don't listen to your mother. Has she 
                    ever even once had a successful 
                      relationship?

      Riley shakes her head, breathless.

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    I've missed you so much. My leg's been 
                    killing me since I left. Come over 
                    here. I need a massage. 

      Riley stays right where she is. 

                                  KYLE (CONT D)
                    Don't be mad, babe. I need a release. 
                    Like you give all the guys at that 
                      whorehouse you're working at!

      Riley flares, picks up a chair and hurls it at him--SHATTERING 
      her medicine cabinet mirror.  SMASH TO:


      Riley bolts awake in a cold sweat. It was all just a dream. 


      Selena, Kendra, Dee Ann and Jolene play poker in between 
      clients. Dee Ann's dealing out a new hand. 

                                  JOLENE 
                    Hell, you'd think we'd be busier with 
                    the rodeo in town. 

                                  SELENA
                    The Gay Rodeo, Jolene, didn't you read 
                    the signs?

                                  JOLENE
                    The gay rodeo? You're kidding me?

                                  DEE ANN
                    Sounds frisky, count me in. Ok ladies--
                          (calling the game)
                    Seven Card Hi-Low Follow The Queen!

      They all grab their cards. 

                                  KENDRA
                    So am I the only one who's noticed 
                    that Riley's booked solid all day?                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         42


      They've all noticed. 

                                  JOLENE
                    That girl's doin' something right. 

                                  DEE ANN
                    Georgia said Larry Doyle booked her 
                    five days in a row.

                                  SELENA
                    Larry was my client!

                                  JOLENE
                    And he's movin' on. Welcome to my 
                    world, sugar.

                                  DEE ANN
                    Riley may seem plain vanilla, I'm 
                    telling ya, that girl's got some 
                    tricks up her sleeve. 

                                  KENDRA
                    Whatdaya think she's doing with 'em? 

                                  SELENA
                    She won't say.

                                  JOLENE
                    That's all I need. Someone else 
                    joining the three of you hoodlums with 
                    all the little "extras" you throw in. 

                                  DEE ANN
                          (teasing her/playful)
                    Sweetie, it's never too late to jump 
                    on the gravy train!

      Kendra and Selena are amused. Jolene shoots them a look. They 
      all love Jolene, but enjoy giving her shit. 

                                  KENDRA
                      ...Riley's in the viewing room right 
                    now with Woody Powell...? 

      The four of them glance at each other. Beat. They grin 
      mischievously. (Even Jolene.) And bolt out of the room.


      Selena, Kendra, Dee Ann and Jolene crammed tight, watching 
      through the two-way mirror as Riley (in a robe) sits on the 
      massage table next to WOODY POWELL (cute but hefty, wearing  
      boxers). Riley's showing him some type of brochure.

                                  JOLENE
                          (hushed and appalled)
                    Oh, Good Lord. Porn!

                                  KENDRA
                    Jolene, hush.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         43


      They're extra quiet so they can hear what's going on. 

                                  WOODY
                          (to Riley)
                    I can't believe you remembered.

                                  RILEY
                    Of course I did. You took your wife to 
                    Las Brisas 25 years ago, stayed six 
                    nights in the La Villa suite and had a 
                    wreck one night driving the cute 
                    little pink Jeeps. 

      We see now that the brochures are from resorts in Acapulco.

      Woody's impressed by her memory and thoughtfulness.

                                  WOODY
                    Most of the girls here barely remember 
                    my name. 

      (This irritates Selena, Kendra, Dee Ann and Jolene.)

                                  RILEY
                    Well, I know it's outta your price 
                    range now that you've got kids in 
                    college, but I found three less 
                    expensive resorts with the same vibe. 
                    One even has pink Jeeps! 

      She hands him the brochures. Woody's genuinely touched.

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    That is if you re serious about 
                    proving to your wife you can be 
                    romantic again. 

                                  WOODY
                    I most certainly am.

                                  RILEY
                    And you did the research on clitoral 
                      stimulation I told you about?

      Woody nods again, blushing and a little turned on.

                                  WOODY
                    I sure did. I think I've got it now.

                                  RILEY
                    Good for you! She'll love it. Ok, 
                    Woody, let's get you all massaged.

      She takes off her robe. She's wearing a teensy black lace 
      babydoll slip. Woody grins. Obviously his favorite.  

      Kendra, Dee Ann, Selena and Jolene look at each other. Frown. 
      What the fuck? How are they supposed to compete with this?                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         44



      Riley peeks in to find Katie alone with her laptop, reading. 

                                  RILEY
                    Honey, can we talk a minute? I just  
                    got a call from Mr. Marshall. He said 
                    you're not participating in the Spring 
                    Sing rehearsals. 

      Katie just stares. Riley goes to sit next to her. 

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    You've got the dance down now. You 
                    love to sing.

                                  KATIE
                    Not in front of the entire school.

                                  RILEY
                    Even if the whole class is doing it? 

                                  KATIE
                          (the real issue)
                    Daddy's never coming home again, is 
                    he?

      A horrible beat. The two of them just staring at each other. 
      Riley swallows, gathers her strength. 

                                  RILEY
                      Honey...of course he is. He'll be 
                    back... Before you know it. 

      Tears well. She pulls Katie in for a hug so she won't see.

                    He loves you so much. More than 
                    anything. Just like I do.

                    You don't have to be in Spring Sing if 
                    you don't wanna do it. I can call Mr. 
                    Marshall in the morning. 

      Katie pulls away. Considers her a moment. 

                                  KATIE
                    Lemme sleep with it. 

                                  RILEY
                          (amused)
                    You mean sleep on it?

      Beat. Katie nods. 

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    OK, sweetheart. 

      She smiles. Katie goes back to her reading. OFF Riley, her heart 
      bursting with love and concern for her child.                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         45



      Riley eats lunch with Padma and Lacey. 

                                  RILEY
                    I've actually paid all my bills on 
                    time this month. It's kinda shocking.

                                  PADMA
                    Hell, maybe I should get a job there. 
                    Are they hiring?

                                  RILEY
                          (laughs nervously)
                    That's a horrible idea. 

                                  PADMA
                    What's so horrible about it? I can 
                    give a good massage.

                                  RILEY
                    It's a little more than that.

                                  LACEY
                    A little more than what? 

                                  RILEY
                    She's not...certified for one thing.

                                  PADMA
                    I'll get certified. I hate my job.

                                  LACEY
                    Since when? I thought you loved it?

                                  PADMA
                    I just say that so I don't sound whiny 
                    and pathetic. You think I wanna be 
                    changing granny diapers the rest of my 
                    life. Could you at least ask for me? 

                                  RILEY
                    I already know, she's not hiring. 

                                  LACEY
                    Riley, what's wrong? She's just--

                                  RILEY
                    It just bugs me. Everyone thinks 
                    massage is so easy. It takes a lot of 
                    skill, strength and endurance. It took 
                    me over 500 hours of classes and 
                      instruction to get my license. You 
                    have to intuitively understand the 
                    deepest needs of your clients--

      --a guy on the table wears nothing but women's silky red 
      underwear. It's Larry, the rugged guy from our opening scene. 
      Riley's next to him, wearing his Cowboy hat, doing his nails.  
      He grins with delight. So this is what he meant when he said he 
      had something else in mind. 

      --Riley carefully applies hot stones and oil to a BUTCH WOMAN's 
      back--as the woman munches on a bag of Cheetos. 

      --Riley reads BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN to a TEARY-EYED OLD RANCHER as 
      she uses her other hand to massage his neck. She's crying, too. 

      --Riley tickles a blindfolded ASIAN GUY'S nipples with a feather 
      as he squirms in pleasure. She rolls her eyes and glances at her 
      watch, bored. Hey, it's a living.  CUT TO:


      Jared (Valerie's husband) is on his back, moaning with pleasure. 
      PAN to find Riley (in shorts and a tank) giving him a very legit 
      and intense foot massage. 

                                  RILEY
                    Jared, there's something we need to 
                    talk about. Someone wrote "whore" all 
                    over my car the other day and I think 
                    it was Valerie. 

                                  JARED
                    There is no way in hell.

                                  RILEY
                    Are you aware that she barged in here  
                    drunk off her ass, threatening to get 
                    the place closed 'cause she knows what 
                    goes on here? 

                                  JARED
                          (sits up, jarred)
                    Valerie was here?

                                  RILEY
                          (massaging his hands now)
                    I wasn't gonna say anything, but she's 
                    outta control. She overheard you 
                    bragging to your poker buddies about 
                    all the happy endings you get here. 

                                  JARED
                    Oh my God.
                          (flushed with guilt)
                    Why didn't Georgia say anything?

                                  RILEY
                      Apparently, that's not her style. But 
                    I've got a family to worry about. I 
                    can't have some crazy wife stalking 
                    me. Did you say something about me to 
                    her?                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         47


                                  JARED
                    No. I mean, yeah. Just that you did an 
                    amazing job on my stiff neck.

                                  RILEY
                    Great. She obviously thinks that's not 
                    the only thing that was stiff. And 
                    that I'm having sex with you! 

                                  JARED
                    She's just a little stressed lately. 
                    It's the first year all the kids are 
                    off to college. I think she feels--

                                  RILEY
                    What? Lonely?

                                  JARED
                    She's got her friends. Her charity 
                    work. 

                                  RILEY
                    Maybe she wants you?

      Jared looks at her, a pang of guilt.

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    You said you still love her. 
                          (simply)
                    You have to fix this.

                                  JARED
                    But how? 

                                  RILEY
                    She's obviously trying to figure out 
                    exactly what you do here. And why. 
                    Maybe it's time to tell her? 

      OFF Jared, staring. Nothing could be more frightening. 


      Riley turns off the lights to go to bed when there's a KNOCK at 
      the door. Unsure, she goes to open it. It s Evan. Intense. 

                                  RILEY
                    What's wrong? What're you doing here 
                    so late?

                                  EVAN
                    We need to talk. I know how you've 
                    been making so much money at that new 
                    job of yours. 

      OFF Riley, mind racing, as her heart skips a beat. 

      END ACT FOUR.                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         48

      Where we left off. Riley yanks Evan inside, hushed. 

                                  RILEY
                    What the hell are you talking about?

                                  EVAN
                    I was out having a few beers and it 
                    was so obvious once I really started 
                    thinking about it!

      Riley's eyes flash with fear. The moment she's been dreading.

                                  EVAN (CONT D)
                    Why don't you come out and admit it?

                                  RILEY
                    I want you to leave right now. You 
                    have no business being over here. 

                                  EVAN
                              (disgusted/incredulous)
                    Kyle hasn't even been gone a month and 
                    you stoop to this? I thought I knew 
                    you so well. What's his name?

                                  RILEY
                    Who's name?

                                  EVAN
                    Your Sugar Daddy!

                                  RILEY
                    My--you think I have a Sugar Daddy?

                                  EVAN
                    Yeah, from work, right? How else could 
                    you be bringing home so much cash?

      Riley turns away so he doesn't see her relief.

                                  RILEY
                    Wow, that is so...insulting! 
                          (turning back to him)
                    I happen to be really good at my job.

                    I'll tell you what adds up. I'm 
                    fighting tooth and nail to provide for 
                    my family after the most traumatic 
                    event in my life, Kyle walking out on

                                                    having a few drinks, making 
                                                    wild accusations!

                    Riley, I was just really--

                                  RILEY
                    What?!!

      Without warning, he reaches out, grabs her by the arms and 
      kisses her on the lips! Stunned, she gives in for an instant 
      then shoves him away.

                                  EVAN
                    Riley, you know how much I've always-- 

                                  RILEY
                    No, get out. Now! And stay away. From 
                    me, the kids. Everyone. Got that?!

      Hurt and humiliated, Evan manages a nod. He turns, stumbles out. 

      OFF Riley, breathless and guilty now for treating him this way. 


      Riley's at her locker, running late, changing out of her street 
      clothes. She finishes, shuts the locker door and finds Selena, 
      Kendra, Dee And and Jolene staring at her.

                    Dee Ann heard you.

      The others laugh, but Selena steps toward Riley, something about 
      this doesn't make sense to her.

                      I just...think this job can be a lot 
                    more, that's all. Clients don't just 
                    come here for a massage. They come 
                    because some part of them's...lonely. 
                    And wants to be heard. Like we all do. 

      The girls just stare, but this touches some part of them.

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    Give 'em that--plus all the other 
                    stuff. And we'll all be busy. 
                          (genuine)
                    I'm sorry if I took anyone's clients. 
                    I'll talk to Georgia about it. 

      She starts to leave, but stops. Turns to Selena.

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    And just to set the record straight, I 
                    didn't leave my husband. He left me.
                          (to all of them)
                    A week before I started here. I have 
                    no idea if he's ever coming back 
                    again.

      A beat. There's really nothing else to say. She leaves the room.

      OFF the girls. Affected. Not what they were expecting from her.                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         51



      Riley drives home, lost in thought. Unnerved by the emotions her 
      job brings up in her. She arrives at her house and notices a car 
      as it parks across the street. A Lincoln. She squints and sees 
      that it s Valerie Peters. 

                                  RILEY
                    Good God, you've got to be kidding me.


                                  RILEY
                    You followed me all the way home? Are 
                    you out of your friggin  mind?! 

      Valerie notices bikes and toys on Riley's front porch. 

                                    VALERIE
                    You have kids of your own yet you're 
                    out ruining other people's families?! 

                                  RILEY
                    I'm not having sex with your husband. 
                    I told him to tell you that. 

                                    VALERIE
                    I'm supposed to believe some whore?

                                  RILEY
                    Wow, that is really offensive. You've 
                    got a thing about that word, don't 
                    you? You spray painted it all over my 
                    car the other day!

                                    VALERIE
                    I have no idea what you're talking 
                    about.
                          (grabbing her purse)
                    I brought money, I'll pay you whatever 
                    Jared does to keep you away from him. 

                                  RILEY
                    Jared and I aren't having sex!

                                    VALERIE
                    Right. And he never did anything with 
                    any of the other girls I suppose?

                                  RILEY
                    That's really none of my business and 
                    if you're so worried about what 
                    Jared's doing you should be talking to 
                    him, not me. He happens to love you. 
                    He talks about you all the time during 
                    his massages.                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         52


                                    VALERIE
                    I find that very hard to believe.

                                  RILEY
                    He doesn t think you give a crap about 
                    him anymore. He thinks you care more 
                    about your friends and your charities 
                    than you do him. 

                                    VALERIE
                    That's insane. I've built my entire 
                    life around him.

                                  RILEY
                    Then why does he feel so lonely?

      Valerie looks at her, a bit stricken now. 

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    Look, I m sure there are two sides of 
                    the story, but trust me, a man doesn t 
                    go looking elsewhere if he s getting 
                    what he needs at home. 

      She looks out at her house a moment. Then back at Valerie, more 
        sympathetic.

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    But you weren't getting what you 
                    needed either. Were you?

      A beat. Valerie shakes her head.

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    But there was a time when you were. He  
                    told me about them. ...if you love him 
                    you still have a chance. 

      Valerie considers this, vulnerable now. 

                                    VALERIE
                    But what do I do?

                                  RILEY
                    Tell him you want him back. That 
                    whatever he's done or hasn't done is 
                    in the past--it's done, it's over. You 
                    love him. You wanna move on. 

      Valerie just stares. Tears well in Riley's eyes. We can imagine 
      this is her fantasy of what she'd tell Kyle if he ever returned. 

                                    VALERIE
                    ...why are you crying?

                                  RILEY
                    Because that's something I'll probably 
                    never get the chance to do.                                THE RUB   7/31/11                         53


      She wipes her tears. Valerie s taken aback to see honest emotion 
      from this woman she hated five minutes ago. The two woman just 
      look at each other. An oddly intimate moment between them. 

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    But you could drive home right this 
                    minute and do it.
                          (she grins)
                    Then screw the livin' daylights outta 
                    him. 

      Valerie's offended at first, then she shakes her head and smiles 
      for the first time. Riley smiles back at her. A beat. She gets 
      out of car, looks back in. 

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    Good luck, OK?

                                    VALERIE
                    Same to you.

      Riley nods and smiles. Valerie drives off into the night. OFF 
      Riley, watching her go. 


      Riley comes home to find Linette asleep with a a MODERN BRIDE 
      magazine across her chest. She shakes her head, takes the 
      magazine and covers her mom with a blanket. 


      Riley peeks in. The twins are asleep in their bunk beds. She 
      enters and tucks Travis in. Then notices that under the covers 
      Katie's wearing the leather jacket she gave Kyle for his birthday. 
      She smiles, runs her finger along the trim and kisses Katie's 
      forehead. Then just as suddenly, she breaks into tears. For all 
      that she s lost, for all her children must be going through. 


      Riley, Linette and Katie (in her cowboy costume) are hurrying 
      about, getting ready to leave for Spring Sing when Travis (in 
      his cowboy outfit) enters in tears. 

                                  TRAVIS
                    I used too much hair gel!

      His hair is plastered with gel. A huge mess.

                                    LINETTE
                          (horrified)
                    Good Lord, you look like a wet possum!

                                  RILEY
                    Mama, that's not helping. 
                          (going to Travis)
                    Honey, I told you just a dab.

                                  TRAVIS
                    Daddy always helped me do it!

                                    LINETTE
                    OK, I'll fix this. It's nothing 
                    compared to the disasters I see down 
                    at the salon. Come with me, Possum.

      She leads Travis off to the bathroom as Riley turns to see Katie 
      standing there in her Cowboy outfit, vulnerable.

                                  RILEY
                    Honey, you look so cute. I'm really 
                    glad you decided to be in the show. 

      She kneels to make sure Katie's costume looks just right.

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    What made you change your mind? 

                                  KATIE
                          (shrugs)
                    I want you to be proud of me.

                                  RILEY
                          (melts)
                    Oh sweetie, I already am.                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         56


      She gives her a big hug and a kiss as the doorbell rings.

                                  RILEY (CONT D)
                    Oh God, what now? Check on your 
                    brother for me. We're running late.

      Katie heads off. Riley hustles to open the door. It's Evan. 

                                  EVAN
                    I just wanna say something in person 
                    real quick. I'm sorry about the other 
                    night. Kissing was...totally out of 
                    line. It won't happen again.

                                  RILEY
                    OK, well... I certainly hope not. 

                                  EVAN
                    I want us to be friends again. They're 
                    hard to come by around here.

                                  RILEY
                    Yeah. They are. Long as we're clear.

                                  EVAN
                    We are. I am.

      They both nod. But there's an entirely different energy between 
      them now. Whether they want to admit it or not, it's sexual.

                                  EVAN (CONT D)
                    Ok, bye then. But don't hesitate to 
                    call if you need help with anything.

                                  RILEY
                      Actually...the yard's only half mowed, 
                    last time I checked.

                                  EVAN
                    Damn, you're right. I'm on it. 
                          (he grins, cute)
                    And I'll wear a shirt this time.

      Riley smiles. Unsettled by her new feelings for him. 


      Big CROWD gathered for Spring Sing. Bales of hay in front of a 
      curtain on stage, Texas flags, a Country Western theme.  

      Riley sits in a middle row with Linette, Linette's new boyfriend 
      MARIO (50's, bald, handsome) and Padma and Lacey as they wait 
      for the show to begin and Linette chatters away.

                                    LINETTE
                    ...I finally pulled a few strings and 
                    got Riley a job at the salon washing 
                    hair now that she's outta work again. 
                    Doesn't pay much, but it's a leg in.                               THE RUB   7/31/11                         57


                                  RILEY
                    Mama, we're here to watch the show.

                                    LINETTE
                          (proud of herself)
                    And I'm movin' in to share expenses 
                    and help out with the twins!

                                  PADMA
                          (yikes for Riley)
                    Wow, isn't that exciting? 

      Riley shoots her an unamused look.

                                    LINETTE
                    Just till Mario and I figure out where 
                    we're headed. Did I mention Mario 
                    sells Toyotas and Priuses?

                                  MARIO
                          (eager to impress)
                    I'll cut you gals a deal you wouldn't 
                    believe! 

      Riley rolls her eyes as she notices heads turning around her. 
      She glances back to see:

      Georgia (in a big blonde wig and low cut dress) scrunching down 
      an aisle to find empty seats with Selena, Jolene, Dee Ann and 
      Kendra. They're quite a sight, all gussied up and sexy in stark 
      contrast to the conservative parents and kids. 

      Georgia shoots a grin and a wave to Riley. Riley is touched and 
      surprised to see her here as Georgia spots Mario and shoots him 
      a naughty little wink. Mario grins back, he obviously knows her. 

                                    LINETTE
                    Who in the Lord's name is that? 

                                  RILEY
                    Oh, just um friends. From my job. My 
                    old job. What a surprise.

      Padma and Lacey glance back, curious now, too. As Riley gives 
      Georgia and the girls a little wave. Impressed they came all 
      this way. They wave back as the lights go down and the 
      performance begins. Banjos strum the "Cotton-Eyed Joe" as the 
      curtain rises, revealing--

      Travis and Katie's 2nd GRADE CLASS in their Cowboy costumes. 

                                  2ND GRADE CLASS
                      YEE-HAW!!!!!!

      In unison they form a line to sing and dance the Cotton-Eyed 
      Joe. Step, step, clap, clap, foot tap, lasso, spin!

                                  2ND GRADE CLASS (CONT D)
                    "Where did you come from, where did 
                    you go? Where did you come from Cotton-
                    Eye Joe!"                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         58


      One problem. Katie's just standing there. Frozen. 

      Riley's eyes flicker with panic. Oh God no. 

      The kids keep dancing and singing around her. Travis glances at 
      his sister. Embarrassed. 

      MURMURS in the crowd. Why isn't that one girl moving? 

      Riley looks at Linette. What the hell do they do now? But 
      Linette looks just as helpless as Katie does. Instinctually, 
      Riley rises to go rescue her chid as Padma grabs her arm.

                                  PADMA
                    Wait, Riley, look--

      Onstage, Travis has grabbed his sister's hand and pulled her 
      into the fray. Katie responds and starts to sing and dance with 
      the others. Travis grins. His support was all she really needed.

      Riley sits down, relieved. As Katie relaxes into the music and 
      starts kicking it up with the others. She's actually one of the 
      most talented kids up there. She shoots the crowd a grin and 
      does an extra fancy kick step.

      The crowd APPLAUDS, realizing she was just a little nervous. 

      Riley smiles, tears in her eyes. Proud and relieved. She turns 
      to Georgia and girls. Happy they re getting to see all this. 


      Hustle and bustle as we MOVE through the salon on a Saturday 
      morning. Past Linette who is finishing a challenging dye job to 
      FIND Riley in back washing the hair of ENTITLED YOUNG WOMAN who 
      is bitching incessantly.

                                  ENTITLED WOMAN
                    ...would you put up with that crap?! 
                    The men in this town can kiss my sweet 
                    little ass as far as I'm concerned. 
                    Since when does a "5" break up with   
                    a "9"?! 

      All SOUND fades as she yaks on and on and we MOVE tight on 
      Riley's face. Glazed over, bored out of her mind.

      She finishes up and wraps a towel around the woman's head as she 
      rises. Then, the kicker, the woman opens her purse and leaves a 
        seventy-five cent tip on the counter. Literally.

      ON Riley. You've got to be fuckin' kidding me. SMASH TO:                              THE RUB   7/31/11                         60



      Georgia enters from her office in a velour track suit. Stops. 

                                    GEORGIA
                    Well, I'll be damned. Look what the 
                    cat drug in!

      Riley stands there with a box full of inflated plastic bags. 

                                    GEORGIA (CONT D)
                    What the hell's all that?

                                  RILEY
                    Fancy guppies, a pair of swordtails 
                    and a Siamese Algae Eater. Studies 
                    have proven folks noticeably relax 
                    when they look into a fish tank.

                                    GEORGIA
                          (amused)
                    I wasn't aware of that. 

                                  RILEY
                          (holds up some small plants)
                    And some zucchini plants. For your 
                    garden. 

      Georgia walks over to check them out, genuinely touched.

                                    GEORGIA
                    Hell, there's only one thing to say to 
                    something like this.

                                  RILEY
                    What's that?

                                    GEORGIA
                          (big smile)
                    Welcome partner!

                                  RILEY
                    I was hoping you'd say that. 

      They give each other a little hug and head over to the aquarium 
      to add the new fish.                                            

                        END OF PILOT
