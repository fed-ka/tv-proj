      June steps out of a cab, still holding her box of items 
      (which now includes a tub of peanut butter).  Police tape is 
      stretched across the entrance way.  A COP stands outside.

                                  JUNE
                    Oh my g-- what happened?

                                  COP
                    This building is an asset of 
                    Buchwald Mortgage Company and has 
                    been seized by the government.

                                  JUNE
                    But I live in there!

        BEEP-BEEP-BEEP.  June looks and sees a moving van backing up.                                                                                       7.


                                  DRIVER
                    Delivery for June Colbern?!  

                                  JUNE
                    Oh.  No.
                          (calling)
                    Look, I know we just met and this 
                    is New York, but I smell 
                      friendliness!  I m sensing the 
                    seeds of a friendship!  You are 
                    gonna laugh when you hear this 
                    story, friend!


      June exits the apartment building.  She strides down the 
      sidewalk, carrying a briefcase, giving herself a pep talk.  

                                  JUNE
                    You can turn every obstacle into 
                      opportunity.  You can turn the 
                    smallest job into a resume builder.  
                    You are J-U-N-E, that spells June!


      June stands next to a HOT DOG VENDOR, who looks over her 
      resum .  He is dressed in traditional African garb.

                                  JUNE
                    You know, the original CEO of 
                    Carl s Jr., Carl Karcher, started 
                    out with a hot dog stand.  

                                  HOT DOG VENDOR
                    They gave me a gun when I was 11.  
                    I ATE THE HEARTS OF MY ENEMIES!


      June now stands outside with the DAY-LABORERS.  They call to 
      passing customers.

                                  DAY-LABORERS
                    Do everything.  Do everything.

                                  JUNE
                    I also do everything!  

      A truck pulls up.  The DRIVER leans out and points.

                                  DRIVER
                    You, you, you and you.

      The guys shove June out of the way and pile into the truck.

                                  JUNE
                    Julio, come on!  Qu  pasa, Jorge?!  
                    You know it s my turn!


      Chloe and Lance walk down the sidewalk.  Chloe wears a pair 
      of oversized designer sunglasses.

                                  LANCE
                    Don t you feel the tiniest bit bad?

                                  CHLOE
                    Survival of the fittest.  She ll be 
                    happier back home in Idaho.  
                          (to herself)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    21.

                                  CHLOE (cont'd)
                    People in turtlenecks, throwing 
                    glasses of milk at each other...
                          (shudders, then)
                    I pray to God I never have to leave 
                    New York.


      Robin opens her door to reveal June and Chloe standing there.  

                                  JUNE
                    Robin, hi.  I need to buy back the 
                    ottoman I sold you.                                                                                    24.


                                  ROBIN
                          (to Chloe)
                    How s it feel being on the short 
                    end of the stick?  Yeah, it s 
                    payback time, bitch.

                                  JUNE
                          (confused)
                    I thought she was in love with you.

                                  ROBIN
                    In love with her?!  I was roommate 
                    number 4!  She stole my jewelry and 
                    got me fired from the hospital!  
                          (to Chloe)
                    Well, I finally got you back!  It 
                    feels amazing!  You never say hi to 
                    me in the elevator!

                                  CHLOE
                    Robin, I need that ottoman.

                                  ROBIN
                    This isn t some desperate attempt 
                    to get your approval!  Love me!

                                  CHLOE
                    Ottoman!

                                  ROBIN
                    I sold it!  The fabric chafed my 
                    forearms!  

                                  CHLOE
                    Who d you sell it to?


      Jeremy sits on the taped-up ottoman, playing a hand-held 
      video game.  Chloe enters through the front door.

                                  CHLOE
                    Hello, little freak Steven is 
                    watching.  Where is everyone?

                                  JEREMY
                    June s at work and Dr. Clayton and 
                    Nurse Nicole are in a meeting.

                                  CHLOE
                    What?  I thought the whole reason 
                    she came was so you d be constantly 
                      monitored.

                                  JEREMY
                          (shrugs)
                      Monitored?  I don t know.  The only 
                    reason I do this is to get out of 
                    Boy Scouts. 

                                  CHLOE
                          (beat, then)
                    Hey, you know what s fun?  Drinking 
                    alcohol.
