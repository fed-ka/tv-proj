A column of German Soldiers, led by an officer on horseback,
march into view.
On the sidewalk of the street, with its buildings in ruins,
smoke still rising, stand onlookers, including Szpilman
and Henryk, and a little behind them, Father, craning to
see. They watch, expressionless, as the Germans march past.
Szpilman and Dorota stroll along a tree-lined street with
bombed-out buildings and rubble. She flicks admiring, almost
loving glances at him as they walk and talk. And he is
smiling, touched by her.
DOROTA
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks.
And at last he gave in and said,
'All right, come with me tomorrow,'
and so I came and they bombed the
station.
SZPILMAN
You know something? Meeting you
like that was absolutely wonderful.
DOROTA
Really?
SZPILMAN
Yes!
(he looks at her,
smiles)
It was...it was unforgettable.
She's embarrassed.
DOROTA
I've always loved your playing,
Mr. Szpilman.
SZPILMAN
Wladek, please.
DOROTA
No one plays Chopin like you.
She begins to laugh.
SZPILMAN
I could accompany you, me on the
piano, you on the cello.
They become almost helpless, holding on to each other.
DOROTA
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite...
quite wonderful.
SZPILMAN
Wladek, please.
Amidst their laughter, he takes her hand and kisses it.
Father, wearing the Star of David armband, walks slowly
along, carrying a string bag containing potatoes and
carrots, his eyes fixed on the pavement as if his thoughts
are a million miles away.
He passes two GERMAN OFFICERS. They stop.
GERMAN OFFICER
(a harsh shout)
You!
Father stops, turns fearfully and approaches the Germans.
GERMAN OFFICER
Why didn't you bow?
FATHER
(removing his hat)
I'm sorry I...
I German Officer cracks him hard across the face, catching
his ear. Father reels, collects himself as best he can and
starts to shuffle on -
GERMAN OFFICER
(calling after him)
You are forbidden to walk on the
pavement. Walk in the gutter!
Father steps off the pavement and walks in the gutter. The
German turn and go. Father walks on.
A great column of Jews of all ages make their way towards
the area that will become the ghetto. On foot, on bicycles,
on horse-drawn platforms, some pushing prams loaded with
belongings. A great moving mass of humanity.
They're watched on either side of the street by Poles.
On a horse-drawn platform, the Szpilmans with their
belongings.
All wear armbands.
Szpilman, Halina and Henryk walk beside the platform with
Mother, Father and Regina seated on it.
Szpilman catches sight of someone among the onlookers,
smiles and pushes through the crowd to Dorota, close to
tears.
SZPILMAN
Dorota!
DOROTA
I didn't want to come, I didn't
want to see all this, but I couldn't
stop myself.
SZPILMAN
How are you doing?
DOROTA
Fine, no, not really, they arrested
my cousin, but Jurek says they'll
let him out.
(stops, tears in
her eyes.)
This is disgraceful.
SZPILMAN
Don't worry, it won't last long.
DOROTA
That's what I said, it's so - it's
too absurd!
SZPILMAN
I'll see you...soon.
He smiles and runs to catch up with his family. He looks
back, but Dorota is lost to sight and the procession
continues on its way.
Two rooms on the third floor: a living room and a kitchen.
The Szpilmans are unpacking their belongings in silence.
Father pauses for a moment to take stock.
FATHER
To tell you the truth, I thought
it would be worse.
SZPILMAN
How will we sleep?
MOTHER
I'll sleep with the girls in the
kitchen. You, Henrykc and Papa in
here.
HALINA
(at a window)
Look! Come and look!
They all go to the window and look out.
Their POV - the street.
Further along, men are building a wall across the street.
A SERIES OF SHOTS:
THE WALL. THE WALL. THE WALL.
Winter. Cold, freezing day. Slush underfoot. Great activity.
People selling shoes, clothes, carpets, curtains, food. A
woman offers cakes under a barbed-wire cover. Noise, bustle,
restless wing and froing.
Among the traders, Henryk, slightly shabbier now, and at
his feet a basket with books. He holds a couple of volumes
in his hands, trying to interest passers-by.
Szpilman, also a little shabbier, wends his way through
the setters and buyers, the beggars, the passers-by, and
reaches Henryk.
Henryk drops the two volumes into the basket, takes a handle
one side of the basket, Szpilman the other. They set off.
As they walk, carrying the basket between them, passing
beggars and children asking for food:
SZPILMAN
You sell anything?
HENRYK
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot.
Three zlotys.
SZPILMAN
That's better than yesterday.
HENRYK
Three lousy zlotys. And there are
people here making millions.
SZPILMAN
I know.
HENRYK
You don't know, believe me. They
bribe the guards. The guards turn
a blind eye. They're bringing in
cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor,
French cosmetics, and the poor are
dying all around them and they
don't give a damn.
Suddenly, a WOMAN appears in front of them, barring their
way. She's brightly rouged with thickly painted eyebrows,
dressed in an old green velvet curtain with an unsteady
mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat.
THE FEATHER WOMAN
Excuse me, but have you by any
chance seen my husband Izaak
Szerman?
SZPILMAN
I'm afraid not.
THE FEATHER WOMAN
A tall handsome man with a little
grey beard?
They shake their heads.
THE FEATHER WOMAN
No?
(she is near to
tears, then smiles
artificially.)
Oh, do forgive me.
(as she goes)
Goodbye, sleep well, if you see
him, please do write, Izaak
Szerman's his name...
She wanders on. Szpilman and Henryk, too, continue on their
way. And as they go:
HENRYK
Sometimes I wish I could go mad.
A stream of cars and trams. Jewish policemen and German
soldiers much in evidence.
Szpilman and Henryk join a large crowd of Jews waiting at
a barrier to cross the intersection. The crowd is agitated,
impatient for a policeman to stop the traffic and let them
through.
A MAN next to Szpilman and Henryk is becoming more and
more distraught, shifting his weight from foot to foot,
taking off and putting on his hat.
THE NERVOUS MAN
This is totally insane; why do we
have to have a gentile street
running through our area? Can't
they go around?
HENRYK
Don't worry about it, they're about
to build a bridge, haven't you
heard?
THE NERVOUS MAN
A bridge, a schmidge, and the
Germans claim to be intelligent.
You know what I think?
I think
they're totally stupid. I've got a
family to feed and I spend half my
time here waiting for them to let
us through.
Meanwhile, a street band begins to play a waltz. Jewish
policemen and German soldiers are clearing a space, shoving
Jews out of the way, including Szpilman, Henryk and the
nervous man. Other soldiers are clearing a space.
Two GERMAN SOLDIERS pull out of the crowd a tall woman and
a short man and haul them into the cleared space.
THE GERMAN SOLDIER
Dance!
The couple dance to the street band's waltz.
At intervals, German soldiers select even more unlikely
couples: a fat woman with a painfully thin man, a young
boy with an elderly woman, two men, and two cripples.
The German soldiers are, to various degrees, amused. One
of them is almost hysterical with laughter.
SOLDIERS
Faster! Go on, faster! Dance!
The couples dance as fast as they can. A soldier kicks one
of the cripples who can't go on any more.
SOLDIERS
Dance! Dance!
Then a whistle blows, a policeman stops the traffic, the
barrier swings open and people swarm across in both
directions.
Szpilman walking. He passes emaciated children and beggars.
He steps over the corpses lying on the sidewalk.
The wall runs the length of the street, dividing it in
half and narrowing it. Buildings on one side, the wall on
the other.
Szpilman walks along. A piercing whistle from the Aryan
side.
Szpilman stops.
Two women appear from a doorway, approach the wall and
look up.
Two or three packages come flying over from the
Aryan side. The women grab them and disappear.
Szpilman walks on and sees a child appear through a hole
at ground level. The child wriggles through then turns,
pulls a package after him and runs.
Szpilman walks on, hears a noise, looks back to see a SECOND
CHILD trying to wriggle through the same hole. But he's
stuck. Angry German voices from the Aryan side.
2ND CHILD
Help me! help me!
Szpilman goes to him, pulls him with all his might but the
boy is jammed in the hole.
From the other side of the wall, the sound of an angry
German voice and of a boot stamping violently on the boy.
The boy screams in agony.
Szpilman continues to try to pull the boy through.
The sound of the German voice swearing and the dull,
crunching noise made by the boot smashing into the boy
continues, and with every thud the boy screams in terrible
pain.
Szpilman struggles to help the boy whose screams are
becoming weaker yet increasingly desperate.
Szpilman pulls his arms and finally manages to get him
through. The boy lies moaning.
Szpilman takes the boy's face in his hands, tries to comfort
him, revive him, but the boy has stopped moaning. His head
lolls and his jaw sags. He is dead. Szpilman stands quickly
and hurries away.
Szpilman approaches the house through a shabby yard.
A Gestapo vehicle has entered the street and screeched to
a halt.
Helmeted, jackbooted SS MEN, led by an NCO, pour
out of the vehicle.
The Szpilmans gather at their open window to watch. Regina
turns off the lights before joining them. They are all
terrified. Their half-eaten meal still on the table behind
them.
POV - from Szpilman apartment: the building opposite.
The SS men pouring into the building opposite. Sound of
the jackboots on stairs. Lights go on floor by floor.
In an apartment directly opposite, a businessman, his wife,
three young people and an old man in a wheelchair sit at
their dining table. The SS men burst in, machine pistols
at the ready. The family is frozen with horror, remain
seated.
The NCO scans their faces.
NCO
(in a towering rage)
Stand up!
The family rise to their feet fast, except for the old man
in the wheelchair. The NCO bears down on him.
NCO
Stand up!
The old man in the wheelchair grips the arms of the chair
and tries desperately to stand. But he can't. Without
warning, the SS men seize the chair with the old man in
it, carry him out on to the balcony.
THE SZPILMANS:
Mother SCREAMS, Father shrinks back, Halina comforts him
and Regina comforts Mother.
Szpilman's and Henryk 's POV - the apartment opposite:
The SS men throw the old man in his wheelchair over the
balcony. He seems to hang in the air for a second then
drops out of the chair and out of sight. But there's a
terrible thud as his body hits the pavement and a clatter
as the wheelchair follows him.
THE SZPILMANS:
Mother sobbing. The others, still horrified.
REGINA
(softly, to Mother)
Be quiet, Mama, for God's sake, be
quiet!
Then sound of shots, slamming doors, screams, shouts.
Szpilman and Henryk hurry to another window so that they
can see what's going on.
Their POV from second window building opposite and street:
SS Men herding a couple of dozen prisoners from the building
opposite.
People watching from the windows but trying not to be seen.
The headlights of the SS vehicle are switched on and the
SS Men are forcing their prisoners to stand in the beam.
A GERMAN VOICE
Run!
Run!
The prisoners start to run.
The SS men open fire with a machine gun mounted on the
vehicle. People in the building opposite begin to SCREAM.
The prisoners are being shot down. They are lifted into
the air by the bullets, turn somersaults, fall dead.
One man escapes by running back in the opposite direction,
out of the beam of light and is lost to sight for a moment.
The escaping man, a silhouette, out of the light, runs
with all his strength, putting distance between himself
and the SS. He starts to scale a wall. He looks as though
he's getting away.
But there's a floodlight on the SS vehicle. It flares into
light, swivels and finds the man. A volley of shots.
The man drops from the wall, dead. The SS men get into the
vehicle and speed off, driving over the dead bodies.
THE SZPILMANS:
Szpilman and Henryk stare at the scene, silent, shocked.
The only sounds, the weeping of the people opposite and,
nearer, Mother crying softly.
CAFE NOWOCZESNA - DAY
A doorman with a cudgel beats away the beggars from the
door as Halina, distraught and out of breath, runs to the
cafe entrance. The doorman lets her in.
Szpilman running. Streets crowded. Corpses. Szpilman,
sweating, dodges and sidesteps. Then, suddenly, a woman
bars his way. She's the Feather Woman, brightly rouged,
with her thickly painted eyebrows, the unsteady mauve
ostrich feather rising from her straw hat.
THE FEATHER WOMAN
Excuse me, but have you seen my
husband Izaak Szerman?
SZPILMAN
I'm afraid not.
He tries to dodge past but she grabs his arm.
THE FEATHER WOMAN
He's tall, he's handsome. He has a
little grey beard. If you see him,
please do write, Izaak Szerman's
his name, don't forget.
Szpilman manages to free himself and runs on.
A mob of men in front of the building being herded this
way and that by Jewish policemen. More and more captive
men are brought in by the German Schutzpolizei (Shupos).
The mob constantly swelling.
Szpilman reaches the back of the crowd.
SZPILMAN
(to an elderly man
nearest him)
What's happening?
THE ELDERLY MAN
They've got my grandson in there.
They pick 'em up, they take 'em
away. What do they do to them?
I've stopped believing in God!
Szpilman scans the mob. The Jewish policemen using batons
and whips to herd the men. No sign of Henryk. Szpilman
becomes alert. He's seen someone he recognises. Heller,
with his red hair and Hitler moustache, wielding a baton,
driving men into the building. With difficulty, Szpilman
pushes his way through the mob and gets nearer to Heller.
SZPILMAN
(yelling)
Yitzchak!
Heller doesn't hear.
SZPILMAN
Yitzchak!
Heller glances round.
SZPILMAN
Here, please! Wladek Szpilman!
Heller shoves someone aside so that Szpilman can approach,
but he continues to beat and manhandle people.
SZPILMAN
Henryk's in there.
HELLER
I haven't seen him.
SZPILMAN
Believe me, they've picked him up.
HELLER
Tough luck.
SZPILMAN
Can you help?
HELLER
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you
need me!
SZPILMAN
Can you help us?
HELLER
It costs.
SZPILMAN
I've no money.
HELLER
Then there's nothing I can do. He
should've joined us when I gave
him the chance..
SZPILMAN
Yitzchak, they told me you had
influence.
HELLER
Who told you?
SZPILMAN
People I know. They said you're an
important man.
Heller just glares at Szpilman and then moves away. Szpilman
stands, jostled by the crowd, uncertain, forlorn.
Szpilman, keeping to the shadows of the alleyway, watches
the front of the building. Comings and goings. German
Soldiers in evidence. The mob is smaller now.
Szpilman waits and watches, and then a POOR WOMAN passes,
carrying a can wrapped in newspaper followed by a RAGGED
OLD MAN, dragging himself along. He's shivering with cold,
his shoes with holes show his purple feet.
The ragged old man suddenly lunges forward and tries to
grab the can from the poor woman. They struggle desperately.
POOR WOMAN
(screaming)
A snatcher! Help me, a snatcher!
The can falls to the pavement and thick, steaming soup
pours into the dirty street.
Szpilman watches, rooted to the spot. The ragged old man
stares at the can, lets out a groan, more like a whimper,
and throws himself full length in the slush, licking the
soup up from the pavement. The poor woman starts to howl,
kicking the old man and tearing at her hair in despair.
Then:
RUBINSTEIN'S VOICE
Boys, keep your peckers up! And
girls, keep your legs crossed!
RUBINSTEIN, a ragged, dishevelled little man, Chaplinesque,
waving a stick, hopping and jumping, approaches the Germans
outside the bureau.
RUBINSTEIN
Don't let 'em get you down -
He approaches a couple of Shupos.
RUBINSTEIN
Bandits! Crooks!
Thieves!
He waves his stick at them. They laugh. One of them bows
low.
1ST SHUPO
Good day, Herr Rubinstein.
RUBINSTEIN
If that means good day, I'm your
man, you gangsters, robbers,
pirates!
2ND SHUPO
(tapping his head)
Mad!
RUBINSTEIN
Ich bin meshuge, you bandit!
Almost in tears with laughter, they give him a cigarette
and he goes on his way.
Szpilman almost smiles, then looks again at the building.
He waits.
Sun just setting.
From the shelter of the alleyway, Szpilman continues to
watch the entrance of the bureau. No mob any more, but
people come and go - jewish policemen, shupos, a few jews.
Almost continuous sounds of distant shots and screams.
Then, Heller appears at the entrance, looks this way and
that and goes back inside the building. Szpilman alert.
Again Heller appears in the entrance. He beckons someone
inside. Henryk shuffles out. Heller shoves him into the
street. Henryk stumbles, falls.
Szpilman runs to him, helps him to his feet.
HENRYK
(immediately on the
attack, furious)
You go to Heller, did I ask you to
talk to him?
SZPILMAN
You're out, aren't you?
They start to walk.
HENRYK
Did you beg, did you grovel to
that piece of shit, that cockroach?
SZPILMAN
I didn't grovel, I asked him to
help.
HENRYK
What did you pay him?
SZPILMAN
Pay him? With what? With what could
I pay him? Every zloty I earn we
spend on food!
HENRYK
I can look after myself!
SZPILMAN
They were taking you away.
HENRYK
It's nothing to do with you. It's
me they wanted, not you. Why do
you interfere in other people's
business?
SZPILMAN
You're mad, that's your trouble,
you're mad.
HENRYK
That's also my business.
They walk on.
A wooden bridge has been constructed, linking the small
ghetto to the large ghetto. Few people about, mostly beggars
and children.
Szpilman and Henryk climb the stairs of the bridge, but as
they reach the bridge itself Henryk stumbles, sinks to his
knees. Szpilman gets hold of him, tries to help him stand.
SZPILMAN
What's the matter? Are you sick?
HENRYK
Hungry.
Szpilman supports Henryk, helps him towards the back of
the cafe.
A dense crowd of people crossing the bridge in both
directions.
Szpilman, shabby and unshaven, hurries along and meets
Jehuda Zyskind coming towards him, accompanied by the small
man, Majorek.
JEHUDA
Wladek!
Szpilman stops.
JEHUDA
I thought you'd be off on tour,
playing London, Paris, New York?
SZPILMAN
(trying to smile)
Not this week.
They're buffeted by the crowd. In the street below them,
cars, trams, pedestrians and German guards.
JEHUDA
I have to say you look terrible.
What's the trouble?
SZPILMAN
You've heard the rumours they're
going to resettle us in the East?
JEHUDA
(dismissing him)
Rumours, rumours, you take it all
too much to heart, Wladek.
SZPILMAN
I've been trying to get a
certificate of employment for my
father. I've managed to get
certificates for me and the rest
of the family but I need one more
for my father. I've been trying
all the firms, the shops...
JEHUDA
Why didn't you come to me?
SZPILMAN
I didn't know you were in the
certificate business.
JEHUDA
I'm not, but Majorek is.
SZPILMAN
(to Majorek)
Can you help? I've no money...
JEHUDA
Please, don't insult us.
(to Majorek)
Can you do something for him?
MAJOREK
Be at the Schultz Workshop,
tomorrow, four o'clock.
JEHUDA
You see what a wonderful piece of
luck you've had today? That's die
historical imperative in action
and that's why I always say, look
on...
SZPILMAN
(joining with him)
...the bright side, yes, I know.
A great mass of agitated people crossing only one way:
from the small ghetto to the large ghetto, carrying their
belongings. A German film crew records the scene. The
Szpilmans among the crowd, lugging suitcases and bundles,
Henryk with a few books, Father carrying his violin case.
They struggle across the bridge.
A truck backing up. The tail-gate is opened to reveal a
huge load of furniture, linen, clothing, mirrors, carpets,
bedclothes. Three Jews inside the van start to unload the
stuff, dumping it in the yard.
Other Jews stand ready to start sorting the load, among
them the Szpilman family. Shupos and Jewish policemen
supervise.
Each has their allotted task: Szpilman and Henryk sort out
carpets, Father mirrors, Regina linen, Halina and Mother,
clothing.
The sounds of trains not far off.
They carry the stuff into the warehouse.
Still quite dark. The Szpilmans and about twenty others
lined up under lights shining on them from a couple of
German vehicles.
The NCO goes along the line, making a selection, using his
pistol to prod people into moving. When he gets to the
Szpilmans he selects Henryk and Halina. Then, he turns to
those who are left:
NCO
The rest of you get dressed then
report back here. Bring your
belongings. Fifteen kilos only.
A YOUNG WOMAN
Where are you taking us?
The NCO turns his pistol on the young woman and shoots her
through the head. He marches off while she lies on the
ground with blood spurting out of her.
Hot, fine summer's day. Jews, among them Szpilman, Mother,
Regina and father, clutching their meagre belongings, walk
towards wooden gates and come to a halt. Jewish policemen
approach and order the people about, pushing and shoving
them into line.
REGINA
(to a Jewish
policeman)
Where will we be going?
JEWISH POLICEMAN #1
You're going to work. You'll be
much better off than in this
stinking ghetto. The gates are
The gates are opened.
JEWISH POLICEMAN #2
Move!
They shuffle forward.
Szpilman, Mother, Regina and Father, with others, enter
through one of the gates, which closes on them. They pause
for a moment to take in their new surroundings.
The Szpilmans and their POV:
Their first sight of the large rectangle, walled on two
sides and overlooked by buildings. Several hundred people.
People walk up and down.
SZPILMAN
Let's sit over there.
But he stops again, and so do the others. Something they
see causes them to stand stock still, expressionless.
THE SZPILMANS' POV:
An unoccupied space at the edge of the compound where
bloated, decaying bodies lie near to a wall. The wall itself
is spattered with blood. Large flies walk over the dead.
Nobody goes near.
THE SZPILMANS:
Szpilman turns away and leads the others to another space.
Later:
Glaring sun. The Szpilmans have settled down on the kerb
of a pavement and are waiting. Szpilman stands, observing
the scene.
Mother sits on a bundle of things, staring vacantly, her
hair hanging down in strands. Regina, beside her, has her
hands over her face and is weeping, the tears running
through her fingers.
Father walks nervously up and down, hands behind his back,
four steps one way, four steps back. Near them, a YOUNG
WOMAN begins to wail.
THE YOUNG WOMAN
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
A young man, beside her, whispers to her, but she does not
seem to take in what he's saying. Her cries continue at
intervals.
THE YOUNG WOMAN
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
The sound of trucks. Everyone looks towards the gates.
More Jews are being unloaded from trucks and are marched
through the gates. Mothers, children, old people, begging,
most of them holding papers. Pandemonium.
Later:
The sun high, blazing. Szpilman is wandering around,
occasionally greeting people. The place is crowded now,
packed. Trucks bring more and more Jews at intervals.
Old people lying down, exhausted, impossible to tell whether
some of them are alive or dead. Women carrying dehydrated
children drag themselves from group to group. One WOMAN
approaches Szpilman.
WOMAN WITH CHILD
He's dying, don't you have a drop
of water? My child's dying of
thirst, he's dying, he's dying, I
beg you!
Szpilman shakes his head sadly. The woman with child wanders
off to another group.
A MAN'S VOICE
I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.
Szpilman turns to see a man, DR. EHRLICH, haranguing Father.
FATHER
I can hear you.
Szpilman goes to them.
DR. EHRLICH
(overlapping)
We're letting them take us to our
death like sheep to the slaughter!
FATHER
Dr. Ehrlich, not so loud!
DR. EHRLICH
Why don't we attack them? There's
half a million of us, we could
break out of the ghetto. At least
we could die honourably, not as a
stain on the face of history!
Another man, Grun, joins in.
GRUN
Why you so sure they're sending us
to our death?
DR. EHRLICH
I'm not sure. You know why I'm not
sure? Because they didn't tell me.
But I'm telling you they plan to
wipe us all out!
FATHER
Dr. Ehrlich, what do you want me
to do? You want me to fight?
GRUN
To fight you need organisation,
plans, guns!
FATHER
He's right. What d'you think I can
do? Fight them with my violin bow?
GRUN
The Germans would never squander a
huge labour force like this. They're
sending us to a labour camp.
DR. EHRLICH
Oh, sure. Look at that cripple,
look at those old people, the
children, they're going to work?
Look at Mr Szpilman here, he's
going to carry iron girders on his
back?
A loud cry from Mother. Szpilman and Father spin round.
MOTHER
Henryk!
REGINA
(glancing up, shocked)
Oh my God!
Near the gates, among a large bunch of new arrivals, Henryk
and Halina.
MOTHER
Halina! Henryk!
Regina and Szpilman also call and wave. Henryk and Halina
struggle through to them. Halina falls into Mother's arms
and they hug.
HALINA
We heard you were here...we...didn't
want...we...we wanted to be with
you.
Mother comforts her. And so does Regina. Father smiles
sadly.
SZPILMAN
(shakes his head,
almost to himself,
a forlorn smile)
Stupid, stupid!
THE YOUNG WOMAN
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
Szpilman stands and stares at her.
Later:
The sun lower but the heat still intense.
The place is now packed to suffocation. People calling out
names, trying to find each other. The wailing of women and
the cries of children.
A cordon of Jewish policemen and SS guards are, almost
surreptitiously, ringing the compound.
The Szpilmans sit in the same place, with Henryk sitting a
little apart and now reading a small book.
THE YOUNG WOMAN
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?
HALINA
She's getting on my nerves. What
did she do, for God's sake?
Grun leans across to her.
GRUN
(quietly, to Halina)
She smothered her baby.
Halina looks at him in disbelief.
GRUN
They'd prepared a hiding place and
so, of course, they went there.
But the baby cried just as the
police came. She smothered the
cries with her hands. The baby
died. A policeman heard the death
rattle. He found where they were
hiding.
Later:
Szpilman and Henryk.
SZPILMAN
What are you reading?
HENRYK
(a crooked, ironic
smile)
'If you prick us, do we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
If you poison us, do we not die?
And if you wrong us, shall we not
revenge?'
Szpilman takes the book and reads the title page:
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.
SZPILMAN
Very appropriate.
HENRYK
(taking the book
back and resuming
his reading)
Yes, that's why I brought it.
Later:
The Szpilmans seated on the kerb. Their attention is caught
by a BOY who has a box of sweets on a string round his
neck. And he's setting the sweets, pocketing money.
HENRYK
Idiot. What's he think he's going
to do with the money?
Father calls to the Sweet Boy and beckons him over.
FATHER
How much for a caramel?
THE SWEET BOY
Twenty zlotys.
FATHER
What? For one caramel? What d'you
think you're going to do with the
money?
THE SWEET BOY
Twenty zlotys.
FATHER
(turning to the
family)
Have we got twenty between us?
They search their pockets and handbags, hand over to Father
what change they can find. He, in turn, hands the money to
the Sweet Boy, who hands over one caramel and goes on his
way.
Father holds the caramel between thumb and forefinger and
examines it carefully. Then, carefully takes out his
penknife and with great care divides the caramel into six
pans. He hands a part to each of the family.
They all exchange a look, an acknowledgement of each other,
almost like a toast, and then they chew, slowly,
deliberately.
The whistle of a locomotive. Sound of trucks rattling over
the rails.
At once, a sound of great agitation from the Jews in the
compound.
The locomotive pulling cattle and goods trucks comes into
sight, rolling slowly towards the boundary of the
Umschlagplatz and coming to a halt.
A cordon of Jewish policeman and SS guards. Among the great
throng of people, the Szpilmans trudge towards the train.
Szpilman and Halina walking.
SZPILMAN
Halina?
HALINA
What?
SZPILMAN
Funny time to say this.
HALINA
What?
SZPILMAN
wish I knew you better.
HALINA
(a smile)
Thanks.
THE TRAIN:
The Szpilmans near the train. The first trucks are already
full, the people inside pressed close together, SS men
pushing them with their rifle butts.
People in the trucks cry out in desperation.
The Szpilmans are pushed along by SS men along the cordon
of Jewish policemen, past loaded trucks.
Then, suddenly:
A VOICE
Szpilman! Szpilman!
A Jewish policeman grabs Szpilman by his collar and pulls
him back out of the police cordon. It's Heller. The rest
of the family have reached the next truck to be filled.
A scuffle as Szpilman tries to resist. Another Jewish
policeman shoves him.
Szpilman stumbles, falls to the ground, in front of him
the closed ranks of the Jewish policemen's backs.
He stands, runs at the cordon, seeing between their heads,
shoulders, Mother, Regina, Henryk and Halina clambering
into the trucks. Father is looking around, bewildered.
SZPILMAN
(yelling)
Papa!
Father sees him, takes a step towards him, but stops,
smiling helplessly. He raises his hand and waves, then
turns and goes towards the trucks.
Again, Szpilman flings himself at the policemen's shoulders.
SZPILMAN
(desperate)
Papa! Mama! Halina!
Heller turns on him.
HELLER
What do you think you're doing,
Szpilman? I've saved your life!
Now, go on, save yourself!
Szpilman stands for a moment, confused, terrified. Then he
turns and starts to run.
HELLER
Don't run!
Szpilman drops to walking pace, makes for the gates. Workers
are pushing carts piled with the bloated corpses that lay
against the wall. Szpilman falls in with them and they
pass through the gates.
The doors of the trucks are closed. The train begins to
move. Slow, laborious. From the trucks, the faint cries of
the occupants.
STREET BY THE SIDING - DAY
Szpilman catches his breath by a building. An SS man and
Jewish policeman emerge. The Jewish policeman is servile,
crawling to the German. He points to the train -
JEWISH POLICEMAN
Well, off they go for meltdown!
They laugh as they walk away. Szpilman turns and stumbles
down the empty street. The cries from the trucks fading.
He begins to weep, loud, agonised sobs, and staggers on.
GHETTO STREET - EVENING
Szpilman, lost, empty, aimless, tries to catch his breath
in the aftermath of his tears.
He wanders forlornly down the street, passing empty
buildings with their doors open, windows smashed. Furniture,
torn mattresses and pillows lie scattered. Feathers fly.
Desolation.
He turns a corner.
Szpilman comes into the courtyard. He stops, his face blank.
Lying outside the door, the bodies of Jehuda, Mrs. Zyskind,
their two sons and the toddler.
Szpilman steps across the
bodies.
Szpilman shuffles along, comes to the cafe. No sign of
life, but the door is wide open. He goes inside.
GHETTO STREET - DAY
In bright sun, Szpilman and Benek march in a column, four
abreast, under the command of two Jewish foremen, guarded
by two German policemen. They are being marched out of the
ghetto gates.
SZPILMAN
(to Benek)
My God. I haven't been outside for -
it must be two years.
FELLOW WORKER
(on the other side
of him)
Don't get over-excited.
Street traders with baskets full of wares, fruit,
vegetables, fish, tins of preserves. Women bargain with
them, making purchases. Lively, colourful. Dealers in gold
and currency calling monotonously.
DEALERS
Gold, buy gold! Dollars! Roubles!
Later:
Szpilman, on top of a free-standing scaffold, Benek and
the others demolishing a ghetto wall, wielding skdgehammers.
They work slowly.
A smartly dressed young couple are passing, but stop.
They stare. The young woman is extremely attractive and
knows it. The foremen, workers and the German policemen
ogle her.
THE YOUNG WOMAN
Look - oh, do look!
Her young man is puzzled; she points.
THE YOUNG WOMAN
Jews!
THE YOUNG MAN
Can't be the first time you've
ever seen Jews.
Embarrassed, she giggles and they go. Szpilman, Benek and
the others continue to work.
The foremen sit, sunning themselves, and the German
policemen stand, deep in conversation, ignoring the workers.
Szpilman suddenly stops work. He has seen something in the
square that alerts him.
At the furthest stall, he sees a woman, attractive, chic,
in her thirties, buying vegetables at a stall.
Her name
is JANINA GODLEWSKA.
Surreptitiously, Szpilman raises a hand, trying to catch
her attention. But he's frightened of alerting the German
policemen and the foremen. Benek has noticed.
BENEK
Someone you know?
SZPILMAN
Yes.
Again Szpilman tries, but Janina, her profile to him,
doesn't see.
BENEK
A beauty. Who is she?
SZPILMAN
A singer. Her husband's an actor.
I knew them well. Good people. I'd
like to talk to her.
BENEK
(playful)
Don't forget, Mr. Wladek, they
hang them for helping Jews.
He goes back to work.
The German policemen wander over to one of the stalls to
buy fruit. The moment they do so two Jewish workers scamper
across to another stall to buy bread.
Szpilman glances across the square: Janina is still at the
stall.
He comes to a decision. He jumps down, is about to dash
towards Janina, but stops dead.
Janina is no longer there.
As before, Szpilman and Benek march towards the ghetto
gates in the demolition column, four abreast, under the
command of the Jewish foremen and guarded by the two German
policemen.
Suddenly:
YOUNG SS MAN
Halt!
The column halts before a young SS man, wild-eyed, with
his sleeves rolled up and wielding a pistol. He talks
excitedly to the policemen then turns, walks along the
column dividing them up: some men to the right, others,
seven of them, to the left. Benek he orders to the left,
Szpilman to the right.
Young SS man turns to those on the left.
YOUNG SS MAN
Lie down!
Terrified, they obey. He stands over them and, one by one,
shoots them. When he comes to Benek, the seventh man, his
pistol runs out of ammunition. He changes the clip, shoots
Benek and marches off.
Szpilman, bent almost double, carries a hod on his back
piled with bricks. He is mounting a wooden ramp that runs
up beside scaffolding on a small building site where an
extra floor is being added to a house. There are Polish
workers, too, who don't, of course, wear armbands as the
Jews do. There's a wooden hut serving as a store on the
site.
Halfway up the ramp, Szpilman hears someone whistle. He
stops, turns to see, at the bottom of the ramp, Majorek,
smiling and giving a discreet wave.
Later:
Szpilman and Majorek sip gruel out of mugs. They sit apart
from the others who are also taking a break.
SZPILMAN
How long have you been here?
MAJOREK
Since last night. I was pleased to
see you.
Brief silence.
MAJOREK
They're going to start the final
resettlement now. We know what it
means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt.
A good man. His orders were to
follow the trains out of Warsaw.
He got to Sokolow. A local
railwayman told him the tracks are
divided, one branch leading to
Treblinka. He said every day freight
trains carrying people from Warsaw
forked to Treblinka and returned
empty. No transports of food are
ever seen on that line. And
civilians are forbidden to approach
the Treblinka station. They're
exterminating us. Won't take them
long. We're sixty thousand left.
Out of half a million. Mostly young
people. And this time we're going
to fight. We're in good shape.
We're organised. We're prepared.
SZPILMAN
If you need help...
Whistle blows.
A little later:
Szpilman again mounting the ramp with a hod full of bricks
on his back. The noise of airplanes overhead.
A swarm of Russian bombers. Anti-aircraft fire. Puffs of
exploding shells.
The workers look up. So does Szpilman and, as he does so,
the bricks slide off his hod, crashing to the ground below.
ZICK-ZACK
You!
An SS man, ZICK-ZACK (his nickname), with a whip, approaches
Szpilman.
ZICK-ZACK
Here!
Szpilman goes to him. Enraged, Zick-Zack grabs him by the
hair and presses his head hard between his thighs and then
beats him mercilessly.
ZICK-ZACK
(with every stroke,
hissing through
clenched teeth)
Und-zick! Und-zack! Und-zick! Und-
zack!
After a dozen or so strokes, Szpilman falls forward and
lies in the dirt. Zick-Zack nods, satisfied.
ZICK-ZACK
Get him away from here.
Two Poles, without armbands, one of them Bartczak, drag
him away.
Bartczak and the other man help Szpilman to his feet.
BARTCZAK
Hope you played the piano better
than you carry bricks.
POLISH WORKMAN
He won't last long if he goes on
like this.
BARTCZAK
I'll see if I can get him something
better.
Winter. Rain. Cold. The store, a wooden hut, contains wood,
nails, tools, paint, metal brackets.
Szpilman sits at a table, where a line of workers has
formed. Szpilman makes a record in a ledger of the tools
each worker takes out on the site.
A worker puts his head into the store.
WORKER
(hissing)
Trouble.
A GERMAN VOICE
Assemble! Fall in! Only the Jews!
Poles go on working! Only the Jews!
Poles go on working!
The Jewish workers start to assemble on the site in
haphazard ranks as an SS Captain strides in.
The SS Captain, with much jollity and jokes, hops up on to
scaffolding and stands, beaming broadly, surveying the
workers.
SS CAPTAIN
(in English)
I have important and good news for
you. There are rumours circulating
that resettlement measures are
again going to be taken.
A glance between Szpilman and Majorek.
SS CAPTAIN
(in English)
I want to assure you personally
that no such measures will be taken
now or in the future. Posters will
be going up also to this effect.
As proof of our good will, we want
you to select a delegate, who will
be permitted to go into town once
a day to buy, on each worker's
behalf, five kilos of potatoes and
one loaf of bread, which you will
be allowed to take back into the
ghetto. Now, why would we do that
j if we meant to resettle you?
He beams; no reaction from the workers.
SS CAPTAIN
(in English)
You can do good business on what
you don't eat. Isn't that what you
Jews are best at? Making 'geld'?
Rubs thumb and forefinger and leers; still no reaction;
his smile vanishes.
SS CAPTAIN
(in English)
Carry on.
Snow. Majorek pulls a barrow by a rope attached to its
shaft across the site. On the barrow, five sacks. The Jewish
workers are phased to see him.
Majorek pulls the barrow to where Szpilman waits.
MAJOREK
(under his breath)
The smaller one. At the bottom.
Szpilman nods and starts unloading the sacks as Majorek
moves away.
STORES AND BUILDING SITE - NIGHT
Szpilman and a Jewish worker distribute the potatoes to
the other Jewish workers lined up with empty containers of
various kinds. There are scales on the table, and they
weigh out five kilos of potatoes, pour them into the men's
containers and drop in a loaf of bread.
The Jewish workers, all carrying their parcels of potatoes
and bread, march back towards the ghetto gates escorted by
two Polish policemen. Szpilman walks beside them. Ahead of
him, Majorek near the front of the column.
As the column nears the ghetto gates, Majorek tosses his
package over the wall and when Szpilman reaches the same
spot, he throws a similar package. The column marches on.
Freezing cold. The Jewish workers, with their bundles of
potatoes and bread, march back towards the ghetto gates
escorted by the two Polish policemen. In the column,
Szpilman, near the policeman with the moustache, and a
little behind them, Majorek. Distant sounds of gunfire.
Majorek falls in beside Szpilman.
MAJOREK
I tried your friends. They're not
at that address any more.
But.
SZPILMAN
You made contact?
MAJOREK
Be ready to leave in two days'
time. Same place as last night.
Sudden, frantic cries from the head of the column, which
comes to a stop.
Two SS men, blind drunk, drinking vodka from bottles, are
lashing the column with whips. One of them is Zikk-Zack, .
SZPILMAN
Oh, shit!
As the SS men advance on Szpilman and Majorek's section,
Majorek slips back to his place in the column. Szpilman
hides his package inside his coat.
Zick-Zack lashes out at the workers blindly.
ZICK-ZACK
Und-zick! Und-zack!
He takes a swig of vodka and comes face to face with
Szpilman.
ZICK-ZACK
(shouting")
I'll soon teach you discipline!
Jew pigs!
He is staring directly at Szpilman with glassy eyes.
Szpilman is terrified, trying as surreptitiously as possible
to cover his hidden package with his hands. A moment of
danger. Zick-Zack grabs Szpilman by the cottar.
ZICK-ZACK
Know why we beat you?
No response; shaking him.
ZICK-ZACK
Know why we beat you?
SZPILMAN
(tentatively, in
German)
No. Why?
ZICK-ZACK
To celebrate New Year's Eve!
He and his comrade find this hilarious; recovering from
his laughter.
ZICK-ZACK
Now, march! Go on, march!
The column starts to march. ....
ZICK-ZACK
And sing!
(he belches.)
Sing something cheerful!
(laughs.)
And sing it good and loud!
A brief silence, then from the back, a solo voice starts
to sing, 'Children of Warsaw will go to fight!'
Szpilman glances back, sees that it's Majorek singing.
Szpilman smiles, Majorek nods. Szpilman joins in. Now, so
do the others.
They march on, singing lustily.
ALL WORKERS
(singing)
Hey, ranks unite
And follow the White Eagle!
Stand up and fight
Our mortal enemy.
Riflemen, hey!
Let's give them fire and brimstone.
We'll blow away
The yoke of slavery.
Punish and rout
The rapists of our nation.
We'll smash the knout
To save our dignity.
Soon we'll be proud
Of our liberation -
Hey, take your sights!
Aim sharply at the heart.
Hey, load! Hey, shoot!
Hey, load! Hey, shoot!
Give 'em a bloody start!
Hey, load! Hey, shoot!
Aim sharply at the heart.
The column reaches the lamp posts near the ghetto gates.
Szpilman his package over the wall. So does Majorek.
The Jewish workers lined up to get their potatoes and bread.
Szpilman and two others weigh the potatoes.
GERMAN VOICES
Get on with it and fall in! Fall
in!
Calmly, Szpilman leaves the table with the scales, walks
past Majorek and the others, who, having got their potatoes,
are assembling in a column, preparing to march back into
the ghetto. The Polish workers have packed up their tools
and are talking among themselves, also about to leave the
site but in a casual way.
The SS guards shout orders for the Jewish column to move
off. Szpilman seems as if he's going to join them, but at
the last moment turns and falls in with the Polish workers,
beside Barczak, who just glances at him then moves so that
Szpilman is in the middle of the group.
Szpilman slips off his armband, stuffs it into his pocket.
The group walk into the darkness.
Dimly lit. Empty street. Szpilman walks fast to the corner,
stops, looks round anxiously. Nothing. He takes the armband
from his pocket and drops it through the grating of a drain
in the gutter just as there's movement in a darkened
doorway. Szpilman tenses.
Then, out of the darkness of the doorway, a woman: JANINA
GODLEWSKA.
She turns and starts to walk quickly. Szpilman, putting
the collar of his coat up, follows, keeping pace. A
pedestrian walks past in the opposite direction but pays
them no attention.
Janina and Szpilman walk on.
Janina comes to the front door, opens it with a key, goes
in. Szpilman, a little distance behind, catches up and
follows her inside.
A rickshaw carrying Szpilman and Bogucki travels along the
dark streets.
The rickshaw comes to a halt outside a store. The moment
it stops the shutters of the store are raised and Bogucki
escorts Szpilman to the door, then quickly returns to the
rickshaw, which moves off fast.
Szpilman and Gebczynski wait with others at the stop as
the tram trundles towards them and comes to a halt.
As they board:
GEBCZYNSKI
(quietly, to Szpilman)
Go as near to the front as possible,
to the German section.
A charmingly furnished bed-sitting room with a comfortable
divan. Gebczynski leads the way in. Szpilman glances around,
goes to the window, looks out.
SZPILMAN'S POV:
He can see a section of ghetto wall below. Beyond it, inside
the ghetto, a narrow street leading to deserted buildings.
Gebczynski comes up behind him.
GEBCZYNSKI
Must feel better this side of the
wall.
SZPILMAN
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not
sure which side of the wall I'm
on.
GEBCZYNSKI
Here.
He leads Szpilman to the small kitchen.
Gebczynski opens a cupboard to reveal potatoes, bread.
GEBCZYNSKI
I'll come again. And Janina Bogucki
will visit twice a week. Bring
more food. See how you are.
He closes the cupboard.
THE MAIN ROOM.
Gebczynski makes for the front door, stops.
GEBCZYNSKI
Yes, now, this is very important.
In case of emergency, I mean
emergency, go to this address.
He hands over a scrap of paper, shakes Szpilman's hand and
goes quickly.
Alone, Szpilman stands, lost for a moment. Then, he takes
off his shoe and stuffs the scrap of paper into it. While
he does so, his eyes light on the divan bed.
He goes to it, slips off his other shoe and lies down,
testing the divan's springiness with his whole body.
He smiles beatifically. He shuts his eyes and is instantly
asleep.
Szpilman still fast asleep. Voices wake him. He opens his
eyes. He's not certain where he is for a moment.
He hears the voices again, coming from the adjoining flat.
Intrigued, he rises, goes closer to the watt, puts his ear
against it, listens. After a brief silence:
KITTEN'S VOICE
(angry)
Puppydog, what d'you mean, you
forgot?
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
What d'you think I mean, Kitten? I
forgot, that's what I mean.
KITTEN'S VOICE
You know what? You treat me like
dirt!
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
I treat you like dirt because you
are dirt.
KITTEN'S VOICE
Pig!
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
Cow!
KITTEN'S VOICE
Pig!
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
Bitch!
KITTEN'S VOICE
Dirty pig!
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
You're a dirty pig!
KITTEN'S VOICE
Takes one to know one! Pig!
Silence.
Szpilman is enjoying himself.
Then the sound of a piano being played with great feeling
but a lot of wrong notes.
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
You play like an angel, Kitten.
The piano continues for a moment, but suddenly stops:
KITTEN'S VOICE
If I play like an angel, why don't
you listen?
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
I was listening, Kitten.
KITTEN'S VOICE
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
A door slams.
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE
(wheedling)
Kitten, let me in.
Silence.
Szpilman smiles but then hears the sound of rifle
shots and a huge explosion.
He crosses quickly to the window, looks out.
SZPILMAN'S POV - THE GHETTO.
Deserted. Stillness. Silence. From the ghetto smoke drifting
slowly.
1ST APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING
Szpilman asleep on the divan. The roar of motor car and
motorcycle engines. Sporadic firing.
He wakes, rushes to the window.
SZPILMAN'S POV:
A German personnel carrier, an open car carrying officers,
and a motorcycle and sidecar roar down the narrow street
below towards the buildings at the far end. German soldiers
follow behind on the trot, pulling a field gun.
Unseen marksmen fire down on the Germans from the buildings.
As the German soldiers dismount from their vehicles one of
them is hit and falls. The others rush for cover.
The German Commander and two officers alight from the car
and take cover.
The Commander orders the field gun to be trained on the
buildings. Spasmodic firing continues.
He gives the order to fire.
The gun roars. The shell tears into the building. At once
the German soldiers open fire with their rifles and lob
grenades into the building. The gun fires again.
The building begins to burn. Flames and smoke.
German soldiers with flame-throwers advance carefully then
unleash their fire into doorways and windows, and quickly
retreat.
At ground level, Jewish fighters try to fight their way
out and are mowed down.
The fire spreads quickly through the building. Smoke begins
to pour from the upper floors.
The Germans, less cautious now, stand and watch.
A woman struggles out on to her narrow third-floor balcony.
She climbs over, holds on to the wrought-iron railings and
hangs on for dear life. Shots ring out and she drops like
a stone.
From inside the building, screams and shouts.
From another upper window, a man in flames jumps and falls
to his death on the pavement below.
The Germans have stopped firing. They stand, spectators,
watching the building burn.
1ST APARTMENT - LATER - DAY
Szpilman at the window, watching, his mood downcast.
The noise of a key in the door.
He turns to see the door of the flat open. Janina enters
with a parcel of food. She kisses Szpilman on the cheek.
JANINA
wanted to come earlier but...
She hands him the parcel.
SZPILMAN
Thank you.
He goes into the small kitchen and unpacks the contents
while Janina gazes out of the window.
JANINA
No one thought they'd hold out so
long.
SZPILMAN
should never have come out. I
should've stayed there, fought
with them.
JANINA
(turning to him)
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.
Just be proud it happened. My God,
did they put up a fight.
SZPILMAN
Yes, so did the Germans.
JANINA
They're in shock. They didn't expect
it. Nobody expected it. Jews
fighting back? Who'd have thought?
SZPILMAN
Yes, but what good did it do?
JANINA
(passionate)
What good? Wladek, I'm surprised
at you. They died with
dignity,
that's what good it did. And you
know something else?
Now the Poles
will rise. We're ready. We'll fight,
too. You'll see.
she turns to look again out of the window.
The building burning. Corpses lie scattered on the pavement.
The Germans stand about chatting and laughing.
A handful of Jewish fighters are lined up and shot.
Satisfied, the Commander returns to his car. Another officer
confers with him before the engine starts up and he is
driven away. The building burns.
Blazing sun. The ghetto buildings now burned-out shells,
the street empty.
Autumn leaves falling and gusting in the wind. Szpilman
gazes out.
1ST APARTMENT - DAY
Snow. Ice on the windows.
The sound of the key in the door.
Szpilman turns as the door opens and Gebczynski enters,
distraught. Whispered, at speed:
GEBCZYNSKI
Get your things together, you have
to leave!
SZPILMAN
What's happened?
Gebczynski takes out a cigarette and lights it. While he
does so:
GEBCZYNSKI
I'm on the run!
SZPILMAN
What's happened?
GEBCZYNSKI
The Gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.
They're bound to find out about
this place, too - you must get
away at once.
SZPILMAN
Where do you want me to go?
Look
at me. No, no, I'm not leaving.
Can't I take my chances here?
GEBCZYNSKI
That's your decision.
(Stubs out cigarette.)
But when they storm the flat, throw
yourself out of die window - don't
let them get you alive. I have
poison on me, they won't get me
alive either!
And he goes. Szpilman listens to his footsteps clattering
down the stairs.
He sees the cigarette stub, takes it, lights it, coughs,
smokes awkwardly.
Later:
Szpilman hears a car engine and the screech of brakes. He
tenses. German voices shouting and their heavy footsteps
on the stairs.
He goes to the window, opens it. He gets a chair, places
it sideways in front of the window to make a step. He's
working out how best to throw himself out.
He leans against the wall near the door and waits..
Slamming of doors, German shouts, a scream.
Szpilman steels himself, ready to jump.
Again footsteps on the stairs, but this time descending. A
door slams.
He cautiously goes to the window and looks out.
SZPILMAN'S POV - THE STREET.
In the street below, he sees SS men escorting two prisoners
and shoving into a car. The car speeds off. The street is
empty.
Heavy snow. Szpilman stumbles into the street and runs. He
darts down a side street.
Szpilman lurches into the narrow street. No one about. He
stops, almost collapses, but manages to keep hold of
himself. He puts on his coat and wraps the scarf round his
neck. He leans up against a wall.
He removes a shoe and takes out the scrap of paper
Gebczynski gave him. He reads it.
Szpilman drags himself along, trudging through snow and
slush. Passers-by give him a wide berth. He tries to walk
normally, with dignity, but he's weak and slips, and finds
the going hard.
He comes to a villa.
A large room, sparsely furnished but with an upright piano
and a bed.
Michal carries a bag of provisions and puts them on a table
while Szpilman goes immediately to the window and looks
out.
SZPILMAN'S POV:
There are views of the city, but in the street below,
opposite, is a hospital and, on the corner, a building
flying a Nazi flag and guarded by a sentry, standing at
his sentry-box.
Michal comes up behind Szpilman.
MICHAL
(in whisper)
You're in a very German area. The
building opposite is a hospital,
taking in wounded from the Russian
front. Next door is the
Schutzpolizei. It's the safest
place to be. Right in the centre
of the lion's den.
THE APARTMENT:
Michal makes for the door.
MICHAL
I'll be locking you in. No one
knows you're here. So keep as quiet
as possible.
He nods and goes. The sound of the padlock closing. Szpilman
takes in the room. He sees the piano, is still for a moment,
then goes to it.
He sits on the piano stool and adjusts its height. He opens
the lid. A cloth covers the keys. He removes the cloth. He
gazes lovingly at the keyboard. He flexes his fingers.
Then, without touching the keys, his fingers floating just
above them, he plays. Silently. Passionately.
Snow falling.
Summer. Trees in leaf.
Comings and goings at the Schutzpolizei building. And an
ambulance draws up at the hospital, disgorging a couple of
stretcher cases, who are carried inside.
Szpilman looking down from the fourth-floor window.
Peaceful. A few pedestrians. An everyday atmosphere.
At the far end, at the T-junction with a main road, a tram
rumbles down the street and comes to a halt, disgorging
passengers on the far side and so out of sight.
The tram continues on its way, now revealing the few
passengers who alighted '97 women, an old man with a stick.
Last, three young Poles, carrying long objects wrapped in
newspaper.
One of the men looks at his watch, glances around, then
suddenly kneels and puts the package he's carrying to his
shoulder. The sound of rapid firing, which makes the
newspaper at the end of the packet glow to reveal the barrel
of a machine gun.
His two companions have also put their packages to their
shoulders and begin shooting, all aiming their fire at the
Schutzpolizei building.
The sentry is hit and falls in front of his box.
As if these young men have given a signal, now from all
over the city comes the sound of gunfire.
The pedestrians have scattered except for the old man,
gasping for breath, hobbling on his walking stick, who
eventually manages to disappear inside a building.
Rifle and machine-gun fire from the Schutzpolizei building.
The firing intense. The three young Poles manoeuvre to the
corner opposite the Schutzpolizei and toss grenades into
the building.
A battle raging.
The Germans firing from the hospital.
The three young Poles have been joined by other fighters
and they the Schutzpolizei building.
Grenades thrown, machine-gun fire exchanged.
The sentry box blows up, splinters of wood cascading. A
couple of Poles make a dash for it and enter a building
opposite to the Schutzpolizei.
Szpilman watching from his window, looks in the opposite
direction and sees smoke rising.
When he turns back to look towards the T-junction, he sees
a Panzerfaust anti-tank rocket firer poking out from a
window in the next-door building but on the floor below.
The Panzerfaust fires. The shell hits the hospital.
The city in flames.
Sound of firing becoming sporadic, less intense. Isolated
explosions.
The interior of the Schutzpolizei building burnt to cinders.
An ambulance is being loaded with patients from the
hospital.
A horse-drawn cab rounds a corner and clatters down the
street.
Szpilman at the window, watching.
The horse-drawn cab clatters out of his sight. He is about
to draw back when he sees, directly beneath him, a man and
woman walking with their hands in the air. Then, a German
soldier, pointing his rifle at their backs, appears.
Suddenly, the man and woman begin to run.
The man turns and disappears. The woman also turns, but
the German soldier drops to one knee and fires.
The woman clutches her stomach, drops slowly to her knees
and collapses on the street in an awkward kneeling position,
and that's how she remains.
Szpilman watches, aghast. Then, he hears voices outside
his door, shouts, footsteps, panic.
THE APARTMENT:
He runs to his front door and listens.
VOICES
(confused)
Where? Where? Just get out!
Everywhere! Get out into the street!
More clatter of footsteps. Then:
A MAN'S VOICE
Get out now! The Germans have
surrounded the building! They're
going to blow us to pieces.
Footsteps descending stairs, more shouts, and:
THE MAN'S VOICE
(further off)
Everyone out, please! Leave your
flats at once, please!
Szpilman runs to the door, tries it but it's padlocked and
he can't open the door.
In panic, he runs back to the window.
His eyes grow wide with terror.
SZPILMAN'S POV: AGAIN THE STREET.
A German tank bringing its gun to bear on the building
next to his.
The gun jerks back and there's a great roaring noise.
The whole building shakes. Szpilman reek back, falls, gets
to his feet and crawls back to the window.
He sees the tank turret swivelling slowly, bringing the
gun to bear directly on a lower floor of his building. The
roaring noise again.
A terrific explosion. His windows are shattered. Glass
everywhere. He is thrown back across the room. Smoke begins
to billow and fill the room.
Two German soldiers are firing at Szpilman.
The sun is setting.
Szpilman crawls into the backyard. He hears German voices
shouting commands. He hides behind three garbage bins by
the wall.
He waits. Listens.
Silence
Deserted. Buildings on fire but dying out. Corpses in the
street, including the woman who was shot, still in her
strange kneeling position.
Szpilman watches from the doorway. Then, dropping down, he
crawls across the road on his stomach, threading his way
through the dead bodies, now besieged by flies, and makes
for the hospital opposite.
German soldiers appear from around a corner. Szpilman
immediately lies still, pretending to be just another
corpse. Flies alight on him. When the Germans pass, he
sets off again.
German soldiers dragging the corpses into a pile.
A sergeant douses the bodies in petrol, then sets them
alight.
The bodies burn.
From a shattered window on the first floor, he looks at
the burning bodies.
Two German soldiers wander into his eyeline. He draws back
a little but watches them warily.
They sit just beneath him, chatting, and take out their
food-tins, drink coffee and eat bread.
Szpilman at a window sees autumn leaves thick on the ground.
And at the end of the street, a line of Poles, some with
their hands in the air, others with hands on heads, being
marched away by German soldiers.
Szpilman gets to a window and looks out.
German soldiers with flame-throwers are burning the
buildings opposite.
One soldier, with a bucket of white paint and a brush,
numbers the building.
Szpilman cranes to see them reach the end of the street,
then cross over and start on the buildings on his side,
working their way towards the hospital.
He pulls away and makes for the back of the hospital.
Devastation, not a human being in sight.
Nothing. Emptiness.
He is alone.
Szpilman hobbles away.
Cautiously, Szpilman limps towards the villa, a once grand
building, but now partly damaged by shell fire.
He makes his way in.
Artillery fire. Fires glow on the horizon.
The German Captain strides out of the villa, down the front
steps to a waiting car and a driver. He gets into the car.
The driver starts the engine and the car speeds off into
the night.
RUINED VILLA - DAY
Snow. The sound of distant gunfire.
The Germans are evacuating the villa. Men carry out boxes,
filing cabinets, desks, papers and load them into trucks.
They're careless, leaving a trail of debris. No sentries
now.
Freezing weather.
Empty streets.
Then the sound of recorded music, as a car, with a
loudspeaker and a Polish national flag, comes into view,
the Polish national anthem blaring out from the speaker.
Cautiously, in his German military overcoat, Szpilman trots
down the staircase into the empty hall.
He goes to the front door, opens it a crack and cautiously
goes out.
Szpilman looks around, hearing the car loudspeaker
indistinctly.
LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
...German army! Polish soil
liberated!
Official!
His excitement grows and he walks out into the street.
He sees at one end soldiers serving soup from afield kitchen
to a group of people.
On the opposite side of the street, he sees a man and a
woman who have left the field kitchen. The man carries a
two-tiered canister.
Szpilman rushes towards them, grabs hold of the man and
tries to kiss him. The man, totally bewildered, tries to
fight him off. The woman is terrified.
THE WOMAN
German! German!
She runs, yelling, towards the field kitchen. So does the
man.
Szpilman stands and stares, then sees one of the soldiers
cock his rifle and fire at him.
Szpilman runs, the firing continuing.
Szpilman bolts into the doorway of a ruined building. He
peers out to see Polish soldiers beginning to surround the
ruined building, firing shots, lobbing in a grenade or
two.
SZPILMAN
(shouting)
Stop, for God's sake, I beg you,
I'm Polish!
More shots and another grenade explosion.
SZPILMAN
Don't shoot! I'm Polish!
The Polish soldiers: Two of the officers stand near the
entrance, hearing Szpilman's shouts.
1ST POLISH OFFICER
He's Polish!
2ND POLISH OFFICER
(yelling)
Come out with your hands up.
SZPILMAN
(obeying)
Don't shoot! I'm Polish! Please,
please! I'm Polish!
1ST POLISH OFFICER
Yes, he's Polish!
2ND POLISH OFFICER
(as Szpilman
approaches')
Why the fucking coat?
SZPILMAN
I'm cold.
The Polish officers confer briefly in whispers. Then:
2ND POLISH OFFICER
Take him to headquarters.
And they march him off.
Spring. Idyllic.
A column of men and women stretching along the length of
the lane. A couple of horse-and-carts. One or two bicycles.
Some of the people wear concentration camp garb, others in
tattered clothing.
Four men walk together and when they come to a narrow
junction, stop, seeing something
Behind barbed wire, German prisoners of war, guarded by
Russian soldiers. Desolate place. No shelters, no tents.
The POWs sit or lie on the ground, silent, broken,
shattered.
The four men gaze at them. :
1ST MAN
Look at them - bastards!
2ND MAN
German fuckers!
3RD MAN
I prayed for this, never thought
I'd see it.
The fourth man, ZYGMUNT LEDNICKI, approaches the barbed
wire.
LEDNICKI
Murderers! Assassins!
Look at you
now! You took everything I had!
Me, a musician!
(wagging his finger
fiercely)
You took my violin! You took my
soul!
He stands glowering at them, then sees a POW rise from a
group, wretched, shabby, unshaven. It's the German Captain,
uniform tattered, a wreck. He comes to the barbed wire.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
(urgent) (in German)
Do you happen to know another
musician, a Mr Szpilman? A pianist!
Polish radio?
LEDNICKI
Yes, of course, I know Szpilman.
THE GERMAN CAPTAIN
(desperate)
I helped Mr Szpilman when he was
in hiding. Tell him I'm here. Ask
him to help me...
A RUSSIAN GUARD, inside the compound, approaches, grabs
hold of the German Captain.
RUSSIAN GUARD
(to Lednicki, in
Russian)
Hey! No talking to the prisoners.
Get away from there!
He drags the German Captain away from the wire.
LEDNICKI
(as he backs away,
calling)
What's your name?
The German Captain is being bundled away by the guard, who
aims a kick at him. The German Captain shouts out his name
but it's unintelligible.
LEDNICKI
What?
The German Captain and the guard have disappeared. Lednicki
stands for a moment, then turns and goes.
SITE OF POW CAMP - DAY
Szpilman and Lednicki looking around an empty field.
LEDNICKI
It was here, I'm certain of it.
SZPILMAN
It's not here now.
LEDNICKI
I shouted abuse at them, I'm not
proud of it, but that's what I
did, and, I'm certain, I stood
where you are now. There was barbed
wire, and this German came up to
me.
SZPILMAN
You didn't catch his name.
LEDNICKI
No. I'll ask at the factory. They
may know something.
Lednicki goes.
Szpilman stands, looking around the empty field. He is
filled with sadness. He sits. He closes his eyes and put
his face to the sun.
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:
IT WAS LATER DISCOVERED THAT
THE NAME OF THE GERMAN OFFICER
WAS CAPTAIN WILM HOSENFELD.
ALL THAT IS KNOWN IS THAT HE DIED IN
A SOVIET PRISONER-OF-WAR CAMP IN 1952.
WLADYSLAW SZPILMAN CONTINUED TO LIVE
IN WARSAW UNTIL HIS DEATH ON 6 JULY 2OOO.
HE WAS EIGHTY-EIGHT YEARS OLD.
