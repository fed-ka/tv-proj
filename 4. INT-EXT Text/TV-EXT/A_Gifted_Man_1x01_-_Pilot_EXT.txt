                     Interestingly, Halstead and 
                    Balthus, known to be friends ...

      Then a SHOT of Balthus and Michael, on the floor of the 
      Laker s game.  Two men who have never lost.  At anything.


      Moon above.  City lights below.  Michael pounds up and down 
      the hills in a fast-paced pre-dawn run.  


    A Lamborghini Murcielago rumbles into Michael s reserved spot 
      in the cool, jacaranda-shaded parking lot. 


      From above: Michael s Lamborgini weaves through the traffic.

                    I didn t get to read the file.  
                    Give me the bullet points. 


      Michael s car winds around leafy streets.

                    far this year, she s won the 
                    French, Australian and Wimbledon.

                    If she takes the US Open, which 
                    starts next week, she ll be the 
                    youngest woman to win a calendar-
                    year Grand Slam.  

      The Guard hands back the license, waves Michael through.


      10 STARBUCKS CUPS are lined up along the service line.  LACEY 
      SANDRESKI, adorable, ponytailed, delivers a blistering serve

                    She also earns more in endorsements 
                    than anyone else on the tour.

      Lacey s Terminator-fit father, MILT (42, sunglasses, Nike 
      cap) watches, arms crossed, as Lacey crushes cup after cup.


      Milt opens the door and smiles, doing an almost-convincing 
      impression of an easy-going guy.                                                                                        8.


                                  MILT
                    Dr. Halstead, a pleasure, Milt 
                      Sandreski.  Come on in. 


      Michael s Lamborgini shoots through the McClure tunnel.

                                    MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    Hi, it s Michael Halstead.  I ll be 
                    there in ten minutes, can you have 
                    that thing I get ready for me?


      Michael heads to his car -- then stops short.  Thunderstruck.  

      Walking his way is ANNA LINDBERG: confident, wildly 
      attractive, despite the lack of fuss she spends on her 
      appearance.  Or maybe because of it.   

      She breezes toward the restaurant, until she sees him.  She 
      stops too.  They both stare.  Then erupt in awkward laughter. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    What the Hell are you doing here?                                                                                    11.


                                  ANNA
                    I live here. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Hang on -- you move to my city, and 
                    you don t even tell me?

                                  ANNA
                    Your city?  Michael, four million 
                    people live here.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I can t get over this -- what are 
                    you doing, you meeting someone?

                                  ANNA
                    I m getting take-out.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Go grab your food and follow me in 
                    your car.  We ll eat together.  
                          (sees her mulling)
                    Don t think, just go.  

      She capitulates and heads in.  Michael watches her go.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    My my my ...


      It s a sleek vessel.  Top-of-the-line.  Michael and Anna are 
      on the deck, eating dinner.  He s opened a bottle of wine.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    When I left Alaska, I figured you d 
                    spend your whole life up there in 
                    that dismal Inuit clinic.  

                                  ANNA
                    It wasn t dismal --

                                    MICHAEL
                    But no, you re here, in Gomorrah, 
                    eating at 5-star restaurants.

                                  ANNA 
                    Is that place fancy?  I didn t 
                    know.  I had a coupon. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Of course you did.  God.                                                                                     12.


                                  ANNA
                    Anyway -- I got recruited by a 
                    clinic down here -- Para Todos, 
                    have you heard of it?  

                                    MICHAEL 
                    No, but it sounds very commie.    

                                  ANNA
                    It s like the Inuit place, minus 
                    the snow.  That cold was pretty 
                      relentless.

                                    MICHAEL 
                    No kidding.  Why do you think I 
                    left?

                                  ANNA
                          (amused)
                    Not because of the cold, Michael.

                                    MICHAEL
                    No?

                                  ANNA
                    Hon.  You left because you didn t 
                    want to be married.  Possibly not 
                    to anyone.  Definitely not to me.  

      He meets her eyes for a beat, then pours himself more wine. 

                                    MICHAEL 
                    So you got here, when?

                                  ANNA
                    About eight years ago.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Christ, Anna, eight years you re 
                    living in the same city, and you 
                    can t pick up the phone?

                                  ANNA
                    To say what?

                                    MICHAEL
                    I don t know.  Hello?  How are you?

                                  ANNA
                    I knew how you were.  Brilliant, 
                      successful, rich, famous.                                                                                    13.


                                    MICHAEL
                    How do you manage to make all those 
                    things sound like character flaws?

      She smiles, enjoying teasing him.  Takes a sip of her wine.  

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    For what it s worth, when I got 
                    back, I realized I didn t want to 
                    not be married to you either. 

                                  ANNA
                    So what d you do?  Marry someone 
                    else?

      A beat.  Trying to stay light:

                                    MICHAEL
                    I did not.  You?

                                  ANNA
                    No.  I try not to fail at things 
                    more than once.  
                          (then, wrapping up:)
                    Moral of the story: don t drag an 
                    ambitious surgeon to a dingy clinic 
                    with one crappy O.R. thinking love 
                    will be enough to keep him there.  
                    It won t. 

                                    MICHAEL 
                    There were things I wanted to do 
                    that were never gonna happen up 
                    there.  

                                  ANNA
                    So you came home and did them.  And 
                    here you are.  The man you always 
                    wanted to be.  The top dog.

                                    MICHAEL 
                    See, there you go, making it sound 
                    like something shameful.  Yes, I m 
                      successful.  Yes, I m very, very 
                    good at what I do.  Those are not 
                    things I need to apologize for.  

      He sees her smirking, enjoying having gotten under his skin --  

                                  ANNA
                     ... very, very good ... 

      He fights a smile.  This is a familiar dynamic.                                                                                     14.


                                    MICHAEL 
                    Hey, I bring you here, I open a 
                    very nice Chateaunef-de-Pape, and 
                    this is your thanks -- teasing me --

                                  ANNA
                    Muscle memory.  Some things you 
                    can t unlearn.

      She smiles warmly at him in the soft light.  He takes her in. 

                                    MICHAEL 
                    You re even more beautiful than you 
                    were a decade ago.  You know that?

      She laughs a little, knowingly.

                                  ANNA
                    And you are just as predictable.  

      She closes up her take-out container, stands. 

                                    MICHAEL 
                    Where are you going?  Don t leave.  

                                  ANNA
                    It s great to see you, Michael, but 
                    I m not going to sleep with you.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Why not?

                                  ANNA
                    How many women have you seduced on 
                    this boat?

      He doesn t answer.  She kisses him on the cheek, lovingly.   

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    Thank you for the wine.  And the 
                    company.  I m happy you re happy.  

      She jumps onto the dock, saunters up the slip, into the dark.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Who said I was happy?


      The same indistinct gray shapes ... the RED BOUNCY BALL with 
      a SMILEY FACE floats into frame ... FOLLOW IT as before, but 
      this time it s interrupted by A RINGING PHONE.                                                                                     15.



      Michael wakes up in a sleeping bag, on the deck.  He digs his 
      ringing phone out of his pocket: 3:22.  He answers.

                                    MICHAEL
                    This is Dr. Halstead. 

                                  RECORDED VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                    THIS IS A COLLECT CALL FROM THE LOS 
                    ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF S STATION.  


      A big, black Cadillac Escalade parks next to the Lamborghini.  


      Michael watches Madeline drive away.  Heads back inside.  


      A renovated storefront on a shitty block in the Very-Other 
      part of town.  There are 10 PEOPLE out in front -- all ages, 
      mostly Latino, low- or no-income.  Speaking Spanish. 

      Michael pulls up, gets out, locks his car, heads inside...


      Rita guides Ines and the five kids out of the office, into 
      reception.  The kids all have SURGICAL HATS on.  

                                  RITA
                    Okay, we ll call with the results. 

      They leave.  Rita sees Jill Sandreski standing at the desk.

                                  RITA (CONT'D)
                    Hi.  Can I help you?


      Michael is standing by his car, ribs aching, looking at the 
      mangled grill.  His AIRBAG is inflated.  He walks over to the 
      passenger side.  No air bag.  Just an empty seat.    


      The Lamborghini is parked.  HEAR loud, repetitive GRUNTING.  


      The ROAR OF AN APPROACHING JET.  LACEY S PLANE, in descent. 

      ON THE JETWAY: AN AMBULANCE is waiting.  TWO EMT s are on 
      hand with a stretcher.  Michael is checking to make sure his 
      meds are all in order.  As soon as the plane touches down, 
      everything moves with military-like precision and speed.

      * The jet door, flying open.

      * The IV, going into Lacey s arm.

      * Lacey s body, lifted onto a stretcher.

      * The AMBULANCE, screaming through the Santa Monica streets.  

      * In the O.R, the surgical team, waiting.  Tense and silent.  
      The doors fly open and the stretcher is wheeled in.  Michael 
      enters right behind, scrubbed.  

      * FROM OUTSIDE THE O.R., as the doors slowly close:                                                                                    50.


                                  O.R. NURSE
                    Lacey Sandreski, 19 years old, 
                    ruptured cranial aneurysm ...

      Then the doors close and there s TOTAL SILENCE.  


      The same dreamscape from Michael s recurring dream.  Blurred 
      shapes moving too fast and too slow at the same time.                                                                                      55.


                                  ANTON (O.S.)
                    Her whole deal.  Her looks, her 
                    smell.    

      In the deep distance, ANNA starts to emerge.  She s far away, 
      but walking toward us, red ball under her arm...

                                  ANTON (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Well, hello, there.  

      Then just like that, she disappears.


      She reappears, coming at us, with that same confident strut.  


      Anna s still looking at him sideways -- what s going on here?  
      Michael takes her hand.  Tries to do what Anton tells him:

                                    MICHAEL
                    Anna.  I want to thank you for 
                    being in my life --

      He sounds like a bad greeting card.  She cracks up.  

                                  ANNA
                    What is that, what are you doing -- 
                    an Oprah Winfrey impression?    


      Michael, lying on the deck in his sleeping bag, eyes closed.  
      A BREEZE picks up, ruffling the burgee at the top of the 
      mast.  Michael feels the wind, opens his eyes.  Quietly:

                                    MICHAEL
                    You there?  

      No answer.  


      Michael, in scrubs, on a bench outside, stewing.  Rita comes 
      out with a file, searching.  Spots him.  

                                  RITA
                    There you are.  I need to microchip 
                    you.  You didn t sign the surgical 
                    report. 

      She hands him the file.  He takes it, signs. 

                                  RITA (CONT'D)
                    Sounds like it went well.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Yup, came out clean.  Most likely 
                    benign.  He ll be fine.  

                                  RITA
                    No wonder you look so pleased. 

      She takes back the file and pen.  Heads inside.                                                                                     63.


                                  RITA (CONT'D)
                    Luckily, I have a feeling there s a 
                    gift basket coming to cheer you up.

      Michael hangs his head in his hands, hating himself.  He 
      hears footsteps.  It s Anna.  She stops in front of him.

                                  ANNA
                    Ah, the age-old dilemma.  Doing the 
                    right thing for the wrong reason -- 
                    is it still virtuous?  What matters 
                    more?  The intention or the act? 

      There are people around (GARDENER, PARKING LOT ATTENDANT), so 
      he doesn t respond. 

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    You operated on the boy to get out 
                    of visiting your dying friend.  And 
                    I m sure you did a very good job. 
                          (sits beside him)
                    I used to think it was strange, how 
                      uncomfortable you were with death.  
                    Then I realized -- you like to 
                    believe you know everything and can 
                    fix anything.  Death proves you 
                    wrong.   
                          (then)
                    Go see him.  It won t be easy.  But 
                    it won t be as hard as avoiding it. 
                          (then)
                    I ll go with you if you want. 


      Michael s Lamborghini, in the parking lot.  


      THROUGH THE WINDOW: Michael and Milo are watching TV 
      together.  Milo says something.                                                                                      66.


      Michael laughs -- hard and genuine.  Milo smiles to himself, 
      obviously pleased that he cracked up his hotshit uncle. 


    A beautiful day.  Michael s boat on the water, under sail.  


      Michael, at the helm, sailing it himself.   

                                    MICHAEL 
                    So listen, I ve been thinking ... 

      And now we see Anna, lying on the deck.  She props up on a 
      shoulder, shades her eyes, so she can see him.  

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    We re gonna need some ground rules.  

                                  ANNA
                    Like what?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Like, no bossing me around.  I m in 
                    charge, I do what I want.  And: no 
                    meddling with my real life -- my 
                    work, my social life, my sex life -- 
                    all off limits.  Also: no trying to 
                    change me into the man you wish I 
                    were.  It didn t work before, and 
                    it won t work now.  Agreed? 

      She smiles a little knowingly.  Salutes him.  

                                  ANNA
                    Aye-aye, Captain. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    That lacked sincerity.

                                  ANNA
                    You re very mistrustful, Michael.

      She lowers herself back down on the deck.  Closes her eyes 
      again. 

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                    We ll have to work on that.
