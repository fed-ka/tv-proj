      EXT. NIXON MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

      A few Safety Patrol girls help students cross the street.  A 
      Mercedes flies by buzzing the School Zone like Maverick in 
       Top Gun .  An awkward LILY (12), spills her hot chocolate.

                                  LILY
                    Dammit!  Not again.    


      EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

      The Mercedes pulls up.  Out gets MEREDITH DAVIS (30), sexy, 
      confident, a woman other women hate.  She takes a sip of Ice 
      Blended then just tosses it half-full on the ground.  


      INT. BLACKMON LAW FIRM - DAY

      Meredith drops her keys on GERRY s desk.   

                                  MEREDITH
                    It s out front; I know the mileage.    

                                  GERRY
                    We ve been through this.  I m not a 
                    valet.  I m a paralegal.    

                      MEREDITH*GERRY*
      And my husband--*Ex-husband.*

                                  MEREDITH
                    Spends a lot of money at this firm.

                                  HOWARD
                          (walking in)
                    Meredith!  Hi!  Gerry, take care of 
                    her car or go to law school, okay? 


      INT. HOWARD S OFFICE - DAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Meredith sits across from Howard, a fatherly lawyer.  

                                  HOWARD
                    I m so sorry about the divorce.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Me too.  Ray cheated on me with a 
                    younger, allegedly hotter girl.                                                                                       2.


                                  HOWARD
                    She s okay.   Nice body, that s it.     

                                  MEREDITH
                    So, cut to the chase, Howard.  
                    What s my divorce settlement?

                                  HOWARD
                    This is hard to say, but you don t 
                    get anything.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    What?!

                                  HOWARD
                          (hands it to her)
                    Before you got married you signed a 
                      pre-nuptial agreement.  

                                  MEREDITH
                      A pre-nup?  How did I sign a pre-
                    nup?  I read everything.  

                                  HOWARD
                    I m good at what I do.  Sorry.    

                                  MEREDITH
                    I get nothing?  But I loved Ray.  

                                  HOWARD
                    Or his money? 

                                  MEREDITH
                    I m insulted.  His money was just 
                    one thing I loved about him.  

                                  HOWARD
                    You ll be fine.  You didn t have 
                    anything before Ray.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I have bills.  I have college 
                    loans.  I have tennis lessons.  How 
                    am I supposed to get money?    

                                  HOWARD
                    How everyone else does.  Get a J-O-- 

                        MEREDITH*HOWARD*
      N?  Prostitute myself?*--B.  A job.*

                                  MEREDITH
                    What?  No.  What?                                                                                       3.


                                  HOWARD
                    Just get a job.  Okay?  I m sorry, 
                    doll, but I have another meeting.    

                                  MEREDITH
                    Can Gerry bring my car around?

                                  HOWARD
                    It s not your car anymore.  But he 
                    can take you home to get your stuff 
                    and then drop you somewhere if 
                    you d like.  Good luck, Meredith.     


      INT. MEREDITH S MERCEDES - DAY

      Gerry drives Meredith.  The car is crammed with stuff.   

                                  MEREDITH
                    My friend s house is on the right.  

                                  GERRY
                    The tables sure have turned.

                                  MEREDITH
                    You re still a paralegal. 


      EXT. GIANT FANCY HOUSE - DAY

      Gerry peels out.  Meredith is left with garbage bags of stuff 
      from her old house.  BRIE (32), a trophy wife, comes out.

                                  BRIE
                    Mere Bear!  I m so sorry.  It s 
                      everyone s worst nightmare... to 
                      accidentally sign a pre-nup.  You 
                    can stay in the guest house as long 
                    as you want.  But the remodel s not 
                    quite done yet so you have to use 
                    the bathroom in the main house.  
                    It s only a five minute walk.       

      Brie heads in.  Meredith takes a deep breath and follows.  


      INT. BRIE S GUEST HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

      The guest house is definitely unfinished.  A depressed 
      Meredith watches TV on a pull-out couch next to a pile of 
      bills.  She kills ants with the job listings.  Brie enters.  

                                  BRIE
                    Can you pick Lily up from school?                                                                                           4.


                                  MEREDITH
                    I m in the middle of stuff, Brie.  

                                  BRIE
                    I ll give you twenty bucks.      

                                  MEREDITH
                    C mon, it s your daughter.  Forty.    

                                  BRIE
                      Step-daughter.  Thirty.

      Meredith is not thrilled but needs the cash.  


      EXT. NIXON MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

      Meredith eats Cheetos.  Her fingers are covered in Cheeto 
      dust.  A snotty BOY walks out and gives her a look.  

                                  BOY #1
                    Parent pick-up is by the gym.  

      As the boy walks by, Meredith wipes her Cheeto fingers on his 
      backpack.  Lily comes out.  She s the Safety Patrol pre-teen 
      we saw earlier.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Lily.  Your mom sent me to get you.   

                                  LILY
                    That s what child molesters say.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Don t flatter yourself.  I m Brie s 
                    friend, Meredith.  I m staying in 
                    your guest house for a while.  

      Lily starts walking.  Meredith follows.  

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    It s a long walk, I hope you have 
                    something interesting to share. 

                                  LILY
                          (begrudgingly)
                    Today my social studies teacher, 
                    Ms. Guerrero, got transferred 
                    because she had a total breakdown.  
                    She liked Coach Kotsky but he 
                    didn t like her.  She hung pictures 
                    of his penis up all over school.  
                                                                                        5.


      As they walk past the exit to the school parking lot, they re 
      almost hit by a BMW.  The handsome DAD DRIVER jumps out.  

                                  DAD DRIVER
                    Oh my God!  I m so sorry!  I m 
                    late.  My ex-wife flaked and I had 
                    to do carpool.  I wasn t looking.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    My neck is really aching.  

                                  DAD DRIVER
                    I didn t even touch you.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    I feel dizzy and post-traumatized.  

                                  DAD DRIVER
                    I don t have my checkbook.  Sorry.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    You can t blame me for trying.  


      INT. BRIE S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Meredith has white wine and brie with Brie.

                                  MEREDITH
                      Unfortunately, the guy didn t hit 
                    me.  He was rich.  And single.    

                                  BRIE
                    There are quite a few rich single 
                    dads at that school.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Really?

                                  BRIE
                    A girl can look.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Brie, that s it!  I don t just need 
                    any job.  I need a job where I can 
                    meet another rich husband.  I 
                    should teach at Lily s school.    

                                  BRIE
                    Isn t teaching hard?                                                                                      6.


                                  MEREDITH
                    Lily s teacher put pictures of an 
                    adult man s penis all over school 
                    and only got transferred.  They 
                    pretty much can t get fired, get 
                    summers off and leave at three 
                    o clock.  It s the perfect job.  
                    And if I play my cards right, I can 
                    retire next year with a new rich 
                    husband. 

                                  BRIE
                    But how can you get a teaching job 
                    without any experience?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Because I will have experience.  


      INT. BRIE S HOUSE - LATER 

      Meredith looks at a social studies teacher s resume on the 
      web.  Meredith highlights it and drags it to her resume. 


      INT. NIXON MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

      Meredith sits with PRINCIPAL CARL GAINES (mid-40 s), who is 
      confident but searching.  He looks at her resume, impressed.

                                  MEREDITH
                    When I heard about Ms. Guerrero, I 
                    realized it was a message from the 
                    universe.  I have to get back to 
                    the kids.  FYI my speciality is 
                    kids from broken homes.    

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    After my divorce, I felt the same 
                    way.  I threw myself into work.

                                  MEREDITH
                          (knows she s got her in)
                    I m divorced too!  And only people 
                    who have been through it understand 
                    the pain.  You really have to 
                    surround yourself with other 
                    divorced folks.  It s just so hard.      

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    It s the pits, which is my support 
                    group, P.I.T.S.  People In Terrible 
                      Situations.  It s kinda an umbrella 
                    group.                                                                                      7.


                                  MEREDITH
                    My husband cheated on me and left 
                    me with no money but I m still 
                    rich.  Rich in knowledge and love 
                    for children. 

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    You re an inspiration, Meredith.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I ve heard that a lot.

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    I d love to have that kind of 
                    positive energy around here.  The 
                    crystals just aren t enough.  

      We see he has a lot of crystals on his desk.

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL (CONT D)
                    I m gonna push this through as an 
                    emergency hire.  You re more than 
                      qualified.  My secretary will give 
                    you all the paperwork.  I ll let 
                    you know if there s a problem.  But 
                      hopefully, we ll see you next week.      
                          (hands her a red apple)
                    Welcome to the Nixon Middle family.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  
                    Oh, and is it at all possible to 
                    get an advance on my paycheck? 

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    We don t really do that.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    I would never ask but it s for 
                      medication.  I have--  

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                          (stops her; doesn t want 
                          to pry)
                    I ll make an exception. 


      INT. BRIE S GUEST HOUSE - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

      Satisfied with herself and energized by her new plan, a happy 
      Meredith makes a bong out of the shiny red apple Principal 
      Carl just gave her.  Looks like we found our  Bad Teacher .    

                                      END OF COLD OPEN                                                                                      8.


                                            ACT ONE


      EXT. NIXON MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING

      The school is buzzing.  A school bus pulls up.  Kids pour off 
      including Lily.  Behind Lily is Meredith, in a sexy top, 
      pencil skirt and Jimmy Choo high heels.  She turns heads.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    So, where do I go?

                                  LILY
                    Just walk through the main hall and 
                    the Teachers  Lounge is at the end.  

      A little boy then comes off the bus butt first lugging a 
      Louis Vuitton rolling bag.  He sets it next to Meredith.  

                                  MEREDITH
                          (handing him a dollar)
                    Thanks.  
                          (then)
                    Can I have seventy-five cents back?


      INT. HALLWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Meredith walks down the hall, certainly out of place.  She 
      stops at a vending machine to get a muffin.  She only has 
        seventy-five cents.  She looks in her wallet.  There s 
      nothing.  Her funds are running low.  She looks over and sees 
      a locker with a bag lunch in it.  She swipes it and continues 
      down the hall picking through the contents.  She pulls out an 
      orange and tosses it, hitting a boy, leaning over.  He looks 
      up and thinks another boy threw it and pushes him.


      INT. HALLWAY BY TEACHERS  LOUNGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Principal Carl talks to a boy with a bulge in his pants.

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    But see everyone knows it s a sock.  

      Principal Carl notices Meredith and goes up to her.  

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL (CONT D)
                    Good Morning, Meredith!  I hope you 
                    got the welcome packet I sent.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    I did.  And the flamingo socks.  
                    They didn t match my outfit today.                                                                                      9.


                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    Those are for Crazy Sock Friday.  
                    The first Friday of every month.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Looking forward to it already.  

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    I m so happy you re here.  This 
                    weekend was so dark.  I curled up 
                    with a pile of Hungry Man dinners 
                    and put feelings into words.  Did I 
                    mention I m writing a self-help 
                    book,  The Principles of Principal 
                    Carl ?  I am.  I d love your input.  

      Meredith steels herself, eyes on the rich husband prize.


      INT. TEACHERS  LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

      The teachers are all gathered when Carl and Meredith enter.    

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    Everyone, this is our new social 
                    studies teacher, Meredith Davis.  

      There are a few claps.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Thank you.    

      A JANITOR runs in.   

                                    JANITOR
                    Fight by the lockers!

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    Ginny, go ahead and get started.    
                          (running out)
                    No cops.  No cops!  

      GINNY (27), uptight busy body history teacher, steps forward. 

                                  GINNY
                    Great to meet you.  We re about to 
                    do morning announcements if you 
                    want to take a seat.  Or borrow it!     

      JOEL (30), a cute shorts wearing Jason Segel-esque coach, 
      pulls a chair out for Meredith.  He has a laid back vibe and 
      it seems like he d wear shorts no matter what he taught.  
      Meredith sits back and pulls trail mix out of the sack lunch.  
      She picks all raisins out of it and puts them on the table.                                                                                          10.


                                  GINNY (CONT D)
                    If you didn t see my profile in 
                    Middle School Educator magazine, I 
                    have copies.  One per person, 
                    please.  Okay, we need monitors for 
                    Safety Patrol.  Any heroes?

      Nobody raises their hand.  People avert their eyes.  

                                  GINNY (CONT D)
                    Irene, do I see your un-manicured 
                    hand in the air?

      We ANGLE ON IRENE (mid-40 s), a shy introverted drama and 
      English teacher.  A little uncomfortable in her own skin. 

                        IRENEGINNY
      I do light exercise after  *Great!
      school.   *

                        IRENEGINNY
      It s required by my doc--See you in the morning.

                                  GINNY (CONT D)
                    Anyone else gonna help Irene out?  
                    I know she can talk a lot but there
                    is a small stipend--

                                  MEREDITH
                          (perking up at  stipend )
                    I ll do it with her.  

      Irene mouths  thanks .  She has an instant friend crush.  The 
      bell RINGS.  Teachers get up to leave.    

                                  GINNY
                    Okay, everyone.  Remember you gotta 
                    be hard.  You gotta be tough.  You 
                    gotta be stronger.  You gotta be 
                    cool.  You gotta be calm.  And you 
                    gotta work together!  

                                  MEREDITH
                    What s next?  Is she gonna tell us 
                    not to go chasing waterfalls?

      Joel turns to Meredith as she surreptitiously knocks the 
      raisins she s collected onto the floor.  

                                  JOEL
                    Your mother doesn t work here.    
                          (off no reaction)
                    Coach Kotsky or Joel.  I teach gym.    
                    We went to high school together.                                                                                      11.


                                  MEREDITH
                    I don t remember you. 

                                  JOEL
                    Well, I remember you.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    I m sure you do.  I was the hottest 
                    girl in school.  I bet you jerked 
                    it to me a thousand times.

                                  JOEL
                          (you can t embarrass me)
                    Probably.  Thanks for the memories.  

      Meredith doesn t seem that interested in Joel, regardless of 
      their past.  She has a goal and she s focused on it.  Ginny 
      and Kim (23), a shy submissive type, come up to Meredith.         

                                  GINNY
                    Ginny Taylor-Clapp, Faculty 
                      President.  And this is Kim, my 
                    student teacher.

                                  KIM
                    Nice to meet you.  

                                  GINNY
                    Remember your ears are your best 
                    learning tool, Kim.  Okay.  
                          (handing book to Meredith)
                    Here s a copy of the Teacher s 
                    Handbook.  Great 411 in there.  On 
                    start times, dress codes, etc.    

                                  MEREDITH
                    Save the tree.  It s the standard 
                    stuff, right?  No running...  No 
                      horseplay...  No glass...     

                                  GINNY
                    Those are pool rules.

      Just then a kid, MATTY, runs in.  

                                  MATTY
                    That teacher stole my lunch!  

      He points to Meredith, holding the bag that says  Matty .         

                                  MEREDITH
                    Or confiscated it.  Childhood 
                    obesity.  It s everyone s problem.                                                                                       12.


      Ginny nods as Meredith pinches Matty s non-existent fat.


      INT. HALLWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Meredith walks out.  Joel follows.  

                                  JOEL
                    You really don t remember me?

                                  MEREDITH
                    I don t.  

                                  JOEL
                    We did that senior project 
                    together,  So, What is Email?   No?  
                    Fine.  Look, you were pretty stuck 
                    up in high school but you were 
                    always nice or rather not a total 
                    bitch to me.  So, I m gonna be nice 
                    to you.  Nixon Middle is like 
                    prison.  And just like in prison 
                    you need friends.  Friends who 
                    watch your back in the shower-- Now 
                    I m just sounding like a creep.  

      Meredith can t help but smile a little.  Irene comes up.    

                                  IRENE
                    We didn t meet.  I m Irene.  Thanks 
                    so much for teaming up with me.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    I have bills to pay.  

                                  IRENE
                    I used to be Ginny s favorite, then 
                      I disagreed with her about corporal 
                      punishment.  She replaced me with 
                    that spank happy student teacher 
                    and never looked back.  I m like a 
                    lone wolf expelled by the pack.  
                    But you re new.  So we can form a 
                    pack together, a best friends pack.    

      Meredith looks a little worried.  Irene is intense.  

                                  JOEL
                    Irene.  Tuck it in.    

                                  IRENE
                    Anyway, Safety Patrol is gonna be 
                    fun.  We get badges and slickers.                                                                                        13.


                                  MEREDITH
                    I m not wearing a badge or slicker.     

                                  IRENE
                    Me neither.  They re so dumb.  
                          (then)
                    Hey, why don t you eat lunch with 
                    us?  Our treat.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    I nap at lunch, but you guys can 
                    give me the cash equivalent. 

                                  JOEL
                          (sarcastic)
                    What a great way to get to know 
                    each other.  
                          (points to classroom)
                    This is actually you. 

                                  IRENE
                    Excited for your first day?

      We see Meredith has already disappeared into her room.  

                                  IRENE (CONT D)
                    She s pretty cool.             

                                  JOEL
                    And pretty terrible.  But the most 
                      interesting thing that s happened 
                    around here in a long time.  


      INT. MEREDITH S CLASSROOM - DAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      Meredith has her iPod playing Dr. Dre, while the kids enter.

                          (turning music off)
                    Good morning.  I m your new social 
                    studies teacher, Ms. Davis.  

      Meredith picks up chalk.  It looks like she s gonna write her 
      name on the board but she writes  Class Dues $25 .   

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Checks should be written to  cash .
                          (handing out cards)
                    Okay.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    14.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    To get to know you better, I m 
                    handing out student information 
                    cards.  Please fill them out.  
                    Name.  Address.  Whether your 
                    parents are divorced or unhappily 
                    married.  How many cars fit in your 
                    garage.  Standard stuff.        

      PARKER (12), a smart kid, raises his hand.

                                  PARKER
                    I don t know how many cars fit in 
                    my garage.  Maybe ten?  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Wait.  Everyone shut-up.  A house 
                    with a ten car garage?

                                  PARKER
                    It s an apartment.

                                  MEREDITH
                          (grabbing card)
                    Don t worry about it.   
                          (then; back to class)
                    Let s talk about summer vacation.  
                    What did you guys do?  Club Med?  
                    Beach vacay?  European adventure?

      NOAH (12), a popular boy, raises his hand.  

                                  NOAH
                    We drove to the Grand Canyon--

                                  MEREDITH
                    Next.  

      JALISSA (13), a popular girl, raises his hand.  

                                    JALISSA
                    We went on a boat to the Bahamas.    

                                  MEREDITH
                    Was your mom there?

                                    JALISSA
                    Yes.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Did your parents fight?

                                    JALISSA
                    Yes.                                                                                      15.


                                  MEREDITH
                    Is she fat?
                          (off look)
                    You don t have to tell me.  I can 
                    see on your face that she is.  
                          (taking his card) 
                    Okay, keep filling out your cards.  
                    I m running to the bathroom.  
                    Number one, so no funny business.  
                    When I get back, I m gonna show you 
                    something cool called Google Maps 
                    Street View.  We re gonna randomly 
                    start with kids who have pools.   


      INT. BATHROOM - DAY

      Ginny and Kim enter with a fire extinguisher, to find 
      Meredith holding a lit cigarette.   

                                  MEREDITH
                    I just took this away from a girl.    
                    Sad.  I let her off the hook, she 
                    has bigger issues.  Acne, fupa etc.

                                  GINNY
                    Well, good thing you stopped her.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Just doing my job, inspiring 
                      greatness.  And building 
                      foundations for learning. 

                                  KIM
                    I ve heard that somewhere.

      Meredith walks out, past an inspirational poster that says, 
       Teaching inspires greatness and builds foundations for 
      learning.   Ginny and Kim s interest is slightly piqued.    


      EXT. STREET - DAY

      We see the nerdy girls from the Cold Open (Bronwen, Lily and 
      Kelsey), in neon reflective Safety Patrol gear, practicing.   

                                  LILY
                    See.  You raise the flag on your 
                    right but lower it on the left.  

                                    BRONWEN
                    That s awesome, Lily.                                                                                      16.


                                  LILY
                    I learned it at Safety Patrol Camp.   
                    We can practice this weekend.   

      Irene leads Meredith up to the group.  

                                  IRENE
                    Girls, this is the other Safety 
                    Patrol advisor, Ms. Davis.

                                  EVERYONE
                      Hey./Hi./Great.    

                                  MEREDITH
                    So, when do I get my stipend?

                                  IRENE
                    It s added to our paychecks.

                                  MEREDITH
                    When do we get our paychecks?

                                  IRENE
                    Friday.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Morning or after--
                          (just noticing)
                    Lily, you re in Safety Patrol?  

                                  LILY
                    I m captain.    

                                  MEREDITH
                          (to group)
                    I live in Lily s guest house.  

                                  LILY
                    She s friends with my dumb stepmom.

                                  MEREDITH
                    You stay late to help kids cross 
                    the street for free, that s dumb.

                                    BRONWEN
                    It s a great way to meet people. 

                                  KELSEY
                    You re really pretty, Ms. Davis.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I know.  And I m also photogenic.                                                                                     17.


                                  LILY
                    Okay, Patrolers.  We re piling up.  

      Students wait to cross.  Lily heads out.  The other girls 
      unfurl their flags.  Meredith sits in a folding chair.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    I ll be here.  Supervising.

                                  IRENE
                    Yeah.  Me too... after I help a 
                    little bit.  

      Irene walks off.  Meredith pulls out a magazine marked  DO 
      NOT REMOVE FROM LIBRARY .  Mean girls, BELLA (14) and JAMIE 
      (14), walk up with a few boys.   

                                  JAMIE
                    Oh, look, it s the Nerd Patrol. 

                                  KELSEY
                    Wrong.  It s Safety Patrol.

                                  BELLA
                    Same diff.  Nice sashes, lesbos. 

      Everyone LAUGHS.  Meredith tries to ignore them.  

                                    BRONWEN
                    Thanks.  Because there s nothing 
                    wrong with being gay or bi-- 

      Meredith can t sit by.  She gets in the mean girls  faces.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Okay, move it along, Water Bra.  
                    And take Panty Lines with you.

      The mean girls huff off and their friends follow. 

                                    BRONWEN/KELSEY
                    Thanks, Ms. Davis./Thank you.    

                                  MEREDITH
                    You have to fight fire with fire.  
                    It doesn t get better right away.  

                                    BRONWEN
                    I hate the popular kids--  

                                  MEREDITH
                    This isn t therapy.  Unless you pay 
                    me a hundred and fifty dollars, 
                    then it can be anything you want.                                                                                        18.


      Bronwen and Kelsey look bummed.  Meredith SIGHS.

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Lay low and wait for a few popular 
                    girls to get pregnant.  Then you ll 
                    move up socially.  I was popular 
                    but smart.  I was on the pill.  
                    Those girls aren t smart and have 
                      definitely let a guy go  under the 
                    shirt .  It won t be too long.  

                                  KELSEY
                    Middle school is the worst.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Not worse than having a job.  I 
                    can t believe we have to do this 
                    all again tomorrow.  


      EXT. SCHOOL - NEXT MORNING

      We hear a bell RING.  Irene and Meredith walk towards school.

                                  IRENE
                    My other car really isn t a ferret.

                                  MEREDITH
                    It s quite a bumper sticker.    

      A fancy car pulls up, out climbs JALISSA, from class.  
      JALISSA S DAD, a good-looking guy, gets out and hugs her.    

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Hey, Rich-girl-from-my-class.  What 
                    does your dad do?

                                    JALISSA
                    He s an investment banker.  I m 
                    gonna be one when I grow up.      

                                  MEREDITH
                    Don t.  That job emasculates men.  
                    You ll end up alone at forty trying 
                    to get your groove back by adopting 
                    a foreign baby or getting into 
                    wine.  But you did give me an idea.  


      INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

      Meredith stands in front of her class, excited.                                                                                      19.


                                  MEREDITH
                    Friday is Career Day!  

      She writes on the board,  Class Dues are still $25.   

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    You guys are gonna invite guest 
                    speakers.  We ll start with men. 
                      Successful men.  If your parents 
                    are divorced, maybe dad doesn t see 
                    you enough.  Get him involved.  But 
                    don t limit it to dads.  It can be 
                    a brother or uncle.  Shout out who 
                    you ve got.  Who s got a doctor?  
                          (a few hands go up)
                    No dentists.     

                                  PARKER
                    My uncle is a Podiatrist.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Are you serious right now?


      INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

      Meredith s come around a little and eats with Joel and Irene.  
      They watch Ginny and Kim walk through the cafeteria with CDs.  

                                  GINNY
                    Junk for Funk!  Trade junk food for 
                    a CD from my own collection.
                          (taking candy from a kid)
                    You will take the Amy Grant CD.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    What s the deal with Ginny?  She s 
                      everywhere.  I just want to do the 
                    least amount of work possible and 
                    be left alone. 
                          (off their looks)
                    ...to help kids.    

                                  JOEL
                    Almost saved it.

                                  IRENE
                    Just don t get on Ginny s bad side.  
                    I know she got Ms. Guerrero fired.   
                    Those penis pictures had Ginny 
                    written all over them.         

      They HEAR some kids singing (Parker, Jalissa and Noah) in 
      another part of the cafeteria and look over.                                                                                        20.

                    Bitches ain t shit but hoes and 
                    tricks.  Lick on these nuts-- 

                                  GINNY
                    That song is not okay for school.   

                                  NOAH 
                    We learned it in Ms. Davis s class.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Snitch.  

      Ginny throws her a look.  Meredith heads over.     

              MEREDITH (CONT D)IRENE
      I got this.  Be careful.  

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Kids, that song isn t right.  

      Ginny nods approvingly.  Irene and Joel relax. 

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Because bitches can be anything 
                    they want.  Bitches can be doctors.  
                    Bitches can be astronauts.  Bitches 
                    can even be the President.  Which 
                    you ll learn at Career Day.   
                      Knowledge.  Pass it on.  Now scat.  

                                    JALISSA
                    Thanks, Ms. Davis.  

      The kids leave Meredith with Ginny s disapproving glare.

                                  GINNY
                    One, we try not to use  bitches  to 
                    describe our female students.  Two, 
                    Career Day is my thing.  I do it 
                    every year.  It s the official one.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Career Day is definitely my thing.  
                    I have successful people coming, 
                    who sound like great prospects for 
                    the students.  I m not cancelling.       

      Meredith s firm.  Nobody s gonna stand in her way.  

                                  GINNY
                    I would reconsider reconsidering.                                                                                     21.


                                  MEREDITH
                          (I m not backing down)
                    I already printed the flyers.  

                                  GINNY
                          (sure you want to do this)
                    You already printed the flyers?

                                  MEREDITH
                          (I m not scared of you)
                    I already printed the flyers.  

                                  GINNY
                          (you re a c word)
                    There s really something different 
                    about you, Meredith.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Yeah, I m like a hundred times 
                    hotter than any other teacher here.  

                                  GINNY
                    That s not it.  

      Ginny and Kim walk off.  Irene looks nervous.  Joel LAUGHS.        

                                  JOEL
                    Brilliant diplomacy.  

                                  MEREDITH
                            (triumphant)
                    Thank you.  

                                  IRENE
                    Ginny might have sounded like she 
                    wasn t mad, but she was.  I know.  
                    I hope there s no dirt on you, 
                    because she ll find it.  She can 
                    find it anywhere.  Even under your 
                      fingernails.  With the magnifying 
                    glass she carries on her key chain.      

                                  MEREDITH
                          (calming Irene)
                    What could she possibly find on me?  

      But of course we know there s dirt.  Meredith watches Ginny 
      and Kim walk away.  Ginny turns and catches Meredith looking.  
      She smiles the smile of someone, who s gonna try and destroy 
      Meredith.  We see a little anxiety cross Meredith s face.  
      She hopes she didn t win the battle, only to lose the war...  

                                        END ACT ONE                                                                                    22.


                                            ACT TWO


      INT. PRINCIPAL CARL S OFFICE - MORNING

      Ginny and Kim enter to find Carl meditating on a yoga mat.  

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    Excuse you.  I m in the middle of 
                    putting myself first.  Okay?  
                    Because in order to last you have 
                    to put yourself first.  Does that 
                    make sense?  It s the title of the 
                    second chapter in my book.

                                  KIM
                    I think I like it--

                                  GINNY
                    Kim.  Please.  
                          (to Carl)
                    We have a problem.  The new social 
                    studies teacher thinks she s having 
                    a Career Day this Friday.  

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    And?

                                  GINNY
                    And, I have an official Career Day 
                    every Spring.  The Times wrote 
                    about it last year.  

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    You took out an ad.  

                                  GINNY
                    They ran it.  

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    Ginny, you re Faculty President.  
                    Set a good example here and resolve 
                    this without getting the 
                      administration involved.   

                                  GINNY
                    But something is off about her.  
                    She wears thongs.

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    Don t know how you know that but 
                    remember it s just her first week.                                                                                     23.


                                  GINNY
                    You re right, Principal Carl. 

      Ginny steps out of the office and turns to Kim.

                                  GINNY (CONT D)
                    We have to show her who s boss.  


      INT. TEACHERS  LOUNGE - DAY

      Joel, Irene and Meredith work on posters for Career Day.  
      There are other teachers around too.  Just then Ginny and Kim 
      come in holding a large Career Day banner.  

                                  GINNY
                    By the power vested in me as 
                    Faculty President I took down your 
                    Career Day banner.  It s confusing 
                    since it isn t the official one.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Oh, thanks so much.  You know what 
                    will make it not confusing.  

      Meredith rolls out some butcher paper.  

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Irene, make a new banner that says, 
                     The BEST Career Day .    

      Ginny and Kim storm out.  Other teachers clap.  

                                  IRENE
                    Nobody s ever stood up to Ginny.  
                    This calls for a liquid 
                      celebration.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Yeah, it does.

      Irene exits.  Meredith looks through a Lost & Found box.   

                                  JOEL
                    So, you re really doing this, huh?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Ginny s not gonna stop me from 
                    getting rich successful men into my 
                      classroom... to teach the kids.  

                                  JOEL
                    Oh.  That s why you care so much.  
                    You want to meet a rich single dad.                                                                                        24.


                                  MEREDITH
                    If I can kill two birds, the bird 
                    of educating youth and the bird of 
                    me meeting a rich guy, with one 
                    Career Day stone, why not?  

                                  JOEL
                    Nice.  Confessions from a High 
                    School Prom Queen.     

                                  MEREDITH
                    How about Confessions from a High 
                    School Nobody I Don t Even 
                    Remember?

                                  JOEL
                    I didn t vote for you for Prom 
                    Queen.  How s that for a 
                      confession?

      Irene comes back with sodas, not what Meredith was expecting.  

                                  IRENE
                    Hope you like Squirt.  
                          (off Lost & Found box)
                    Did you lose something?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Yep.  Something expensive.
                          (pulls out gold necklace)
                    Here it is.  

                                  JOEL
                          (ribbing)
                    Your famous Virgin Mary pendant?    

                                  MEREDITH
                    It goes with everything.  

      Joel smiles.  An old dynamic has clearly resurfaced.  
      Everything is about her but he doesn t let her get away with 
      anything.  And she likes it.    


      EXT.  HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Ginny and Kim regroup in the hall.

                                  GINNY
                    It ll be okay.  Life doesn t give 
                    you an obstacle you can t overcome.    

      Ginny turns to go down the hall and trips over a mop bucket.                                                                                      25.


      EXT. STREET - DAY

      We come up in the middle of a talk between Meredith, Irene 
      and the girls.  They are listening intently to Meredith.            

                                  MEREDITH
                    ...and I ended up getting paid but 
                    it was a disaster.  Moral of the 
                    story:  Never text naked pictures.  
                    They ll be out there forever and 
                    you can t control the lighting on 
                    those camera phones.  You could end 
                    up with weird shadows everywhere. 

                                  IRENE
                    Men on eHarmony can be pretty 
                      persuasive.      

      Lily comes over.  

                                  LILY
                    You guys, we need to be doing our 
                    job.  Keeping kids safe.    

                                  KELSEY
                    We re talking to Meredith.

      Lily huffs off.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Next question before I get bored.  

                                    BRONWEN
                    I just got my period.  Is my life 
                    like totally over? 

                                  MEREDITH
                      Congratulations.  

                                    BRONWEN
                    I know.  I m a woman now.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Screw that.  You just got a free 
                    pass to miss anything you want.  
                    Church, family dinners, all of 8th 
                    grade-- you just have the say the 
                    magic word  cramps .  You ll be 
                    riding that baby to Menopause.   

                                    BRONWEN
                    I can get out of ballet.  Cool.                                                                                     26.


                                  MEREDITH
                      Manipulating the system.  Now that 
                    makes you a woman.  

                                    BRONWEN
                    Thanks for being honest.  Adults 
                    are never honest.  It s cool.  

      Meredith is genuinely touched.  We REVEAL Kim and Ginny 
      watching from afar.  Ginny is on full alert.  


      INT. BUS FIVE - DAY

      Meredith rides next to Lily.  Lily reads a book. 

                                  MEREDITH
                    Why are you reading?  You can do 
                    that when we get home. 

                                  LILY
                    You mean when we get to  my  home.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I m living there too.

                                  LILY
                    As a guest.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Why don t you read when we get to 
                     your  home, where I m a guest?  

                                  LILY
                    Brie only lets me read on the 
                      elliptical.  Why don t you want me 
                    to read?  Are you bored because 
                    your little sycophants aren t here?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Whoa.  Someone needs a chilaxative.

                                  LILY
                    Way to destroy the English 
                    language.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    What do you mean by sycophants?

                                  LILY
                    You ve created a patrol of Meredith 
                      worshippers, who wait at your feet 
                    for morsels of trite wisdom.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    27.

                                  LILY (CONT'D)
                    The patrol used to be the place I 
                    fit in, now nobody listens to me.    

                                  MEREDITH
                      Somebody s jealous. 

                                  LILY
                    Meredith, we re outsiders.  We 
                    don t fit in.  We eat lunch in a 
                    supply room so we don t have to go 
                    to the cafeteria.  You re just a 
                    hot popular girl giving obvious 
                    advice.  It might make you feel 
                    good but it s surfacey.  You re 
                    just like all of Brie s vapid 
                    friends.  Why don t you just become 
                    a realtor too?

      Lily moves to another seat.  Meredith is hurt.    

                                  MEREDITH
                    Fine.  I quit.  I don t need your 
                    stupid Nerd Patrol.  I should be 
                    focused on meeting a rich husband, 
                    not saving kids  lives!  


      EXT. LILY S NEIGHBORHOOD/HOUSE - DAY

      Lily rushes off the bus ahead of Meredith.  We see Ginny and 
      Kim behind them in Ginny s car.  They follow Lily and 
      Meredith to their house.  Lily goes in the front door.  
      Meredith goes around back.  Ginny notices the trash bins are 
      on the curb.  She gets out and opens them then closes them as 
      if she has gone too far.  She gets in her car and backs into 
      them, spilling their contents.  She rolls down the window.   

                                  GINNY
                    Oh my God!  I better clean that up.  

      Ginny gets out and digs through the trash.  She unwads a 
      piece of paper to find Meredith s resume.  Ginny sees the 
      door open.  Brie comes out with a smallish dog.

                                  BRIE
                    C mon, Pepsi.  Do your business. 

      Ginny puts the resume in her pocket.  Ginny jumps in the car 
      and floors it.  But it s still in reverse.  She hits the 
      trash can again making a big ruckus.  Pepsi begins to BARK.                                                                                       28.


      INT. BRIE S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Meredith s having her usual white wine and brie with Brie.     

                                  BRIE
                    Lily said you re supervising Safety 
                    Patrol.  I thought you were just 
                    teaching to meet a rich husband.

                                  MEREDITH
                    I am.  I heard Safety Patrol is a 
                    great way to meet people.
                          (then; changing subject)
                    So, what have you been up to?

                                  BRIE
                    I went to this workshop today led 
                    by this Indian man, think Depak 
                    Chopra, who taught me to eat 
                    mentally.  He described a five 
                    course meal in detail.  I was such 
                    a mental pig.  It was delicious.  I 
                    still didn t  eat  the carbs 
                    though.  Old habits die hard.

      Brie LAUGHS.  You can see Meredith is bored.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    I taught my kids how to use Google 
                    Street View so we could look up the 
                    rich kids  houses but then a kid 
                    suggested we look up the Taj Mahal.  
                    It was pretty amazing.    

                                  BRIE
                    Yeah, but their take-out is 
                    terrible.  It s run by Indians.

                                  MEREDITH
                          (disappointed)
                    I think I m gonna hit the hay.     

                                  BRIE
                    Oh, the gardener wanted me to ask 
                    if you ve been peeing in the rose 
                    bush outside the guest house?

                                  MEREDITH
                          (clearly she did)
                    Of course not.  That s crazy.                                                                                    29.

                                  DR. GRANT
                    So, I operate on hearts.  Open 
                    heart surgery mostly.

                                  MEREDITH
                          (flirting)
                    How about closed hearts?
                          (then)
                    Okay, kids.  Do you have some 
                    questions you want to ask?     

                                  PARKER
                    Dr. Grant.  Do you love your wife?

                                  DR. GRANT
                    I m divorced.     

                                  NOAH
                    How many houses do you have?  Don t 
                    include lake houses.

                                  DR. GRANT
                    Three, I guess.

                                    JALISSA
                    How best would you describe your 
                    tax bracket?

      Joel leans into Meredith. 

                                  JOEL
                      Interesting questions. 

                                  MEREDITH
                    They re a smart group.


      INT. GINNY S CLASSROOM - DAY

      Ginny s playing a game with her history class.  Everyone has 
        a historical figure s name on a Post-it note on their 
      forehead.  They have to guess who it is.  Ginny has 
       Napoleon  on her forehead.  Jamie, the mean girl, is at the 
      front, she has a note stuck to her that says,  Bill Clinton .    

                                  JAMIE
                    Did I hook-up with a Kardashian?                                                                                    30.


                                  GINNY
                    Maybe.  

      Ginny s phone RINGS.  She picks it up.  

                                  GINNY (CONT D)
                    I have to take this.  Sorry.  
                    Hello, this is Ginny Taylor-Clapp.  
                          (beat)
                    Yes.  I did leave the message.  
                    About a teacher you had there for 
                    six years.  Meredith Davis.
                          (beat)
                    So, you ve never heard of her.  No 
                    record?  Perfect.  

      Ginny hangs up.  She turns to Kim, whose back is to us.     

                                  GINNY (CONT D)
                    Kim, we ve got her.  

                                  KIM
                    Really? 

      Kim turns.  We see she has a note on her forehead that says, 
       Get Milk .  Ginny rips it off and heads out.  Kim follows.    


      INT. MEREDITH S CLASSROOM - DAY

      Ginny bursts in with Principal Carl.  The whole scene Ginny 
      has the  Napoleon  Post-it on her forehead.  

                                  CARL
                    Ginny, what s going on?  

                                  MEREDITH
                    We re in the middle of Career Day.  

                                  GINNY
                    I guess we ll have to cancel it.  
                    Luckily, the official one is in 
                    March.
                          (to entire room)
                    Attention everyone.  Ms. Davis is a 
                    fraud.  She didn t work at Windsor 
                    Park K-12, where she claimed to 
                    work for six years on her resume.  
                    They ve never even heard of her.    

      Everyone REACTS.  Ginny pulls out the crumpled resume and 
      hands it to Principal Carl.  Meredith whispers to Joel.                                                                                        31.


                                  MEREDITH
                    Is your brother still a cop?

                                  JOEL
                    So, you do remember me from high 
                    school.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Can he get me a restraining order?

                                  JOEL
                    I m sure. 

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    Meredith, is this true?  

      Meredith stands up to address Carl and the whole room.

                                  MEREDITH
                    It s true.  Meredith Davis didn t 
                    work at Windsor Park.  

                                  GINNY
                    We know.       

                                  MEREDITH
                    When I was younger I had a stalker.  
                    My beauty, smarts and bikini ready 
                    body made me a target.  I went out 
                    with the guy for a few weeks and 
                    when I ended it, he didn t get it.  
                          (to eligible men)
                    Once I went to bed with him he 
                    couldn t imagine a life without me. 
                          (back to whole group)
                    I had to change my name and move 
                    states.  But after six years and a 
                    failed marriage I decided to come 
                    back home.  And come back to 
                    Meredith Davis.  

                                  GINNY
                    This is bullshit.

                    Language.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    I can get a copy of the restraining 
                    order.  I m sorry I wasn t up-front 
                    about it.  But it was a dark part 
                    of my life.                                                                                      32.


                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    Meredith, I m so sorry.  This is 
                      embarrassing.  C mon, Ginny.  
                    You ve done enough damage in front 
                    of all these parents. 
                          (sotto; to Ginny)
                    This ends here.  This ends today.

      Meredith is swarmed by the single men.  Joel is amused.  

                                  DR. GRANT
                    You are an amazing woman.

      Meredith notices Irene by herself.  She whisper yells to her.  

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    Irene!  Get in on this.  You can t

                          (then; to men)
                    Alright, who s taking me out first?        
                    There s a sign-up sheet on the 
                    wall.

                          (to Meredith)
                    Okay.  That s a little 
                      presumptuous.

                    Is it?

      Meredith points to the sheet.  There s a line.  Joel nods; 
      giving it to her.  Meredith is psyched.  Her plan is working. 


      INT. HALLWAY - DAY

      Meredith exits class with Dr. Grant, Parker and Irene.    

                                  PARKER
                    Do you think I could be a surgeon, 
                    Dr. Grant?                                                                                    33.


                                  DR. GRANT
                    Maybe.  Want to watch a surgery?

                                  PARKER
                    Really?  Awesome!  

                                  DR. GRANT
                    See you next weekend, Meredith.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Yeah you will.  

      Dr. Grant and Parker walk-off, leaving Meredith and Irene.     

                                  IRENE
                    Parker seems really inspired.  What 
                      a successful Career Day.

                                  MEREDITH
                          (missing point)
                    I know.  I got like ten numbers.  
                    And you got a referral for a skin 
                    rash.  Still a win.  

                                  IRENE
                    I knew we d become friends.  We re 
                    friends, right?  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Of course we re work friends.  
                    Okay.  I m gonna slip out early.  I 
                    have tennis.

                                  IRENE
                    It s one o clock. 

                                  MEREDITH
                    On a Friday.  Just cover for me.

      Meredith then notices Bronwen ahead, who slips into a room.  


      INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY

      Meredith and Irene enter to find the Safety Patrol eating 
      lunch in the storage room.  It s pretty pathetic.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    What are you guys doing?

                                  LILY
                    Eating lunch.  What s it to you?  
                    You quit Safety Patrol.                                                                                      34.


                                  MEREDITH
                    It s sad.  

                                  KELSEY
                    Not anymore.  We put up posters to 
                    make it look like we re outside.  

      Kelsey points to some posters of beach scenes.

                                  MEREDITH
                    You can t do this. 

                                  LILY
                    This is what I was talking about, 
                    Meredith.  You don t understand--

                                  MEREDITH
                    Look, I know I was blessed with a 
                    perfect rack and the ass to match.  
                    But that doesn t mean I haven t 
                    felt like you guys.  I was married 
                    to a really rich guy, who contrary 
                    to popular belief I actually fell 
                    in love with eventually and then he 
                    cheated on me with someone younger.  
                    And now I m a woman without a 
                      country... club.  I m an outcast.  
                    And a charity case.  I don t fit in 
                    with the teachers here either.  I m 
                      different.  I know that.  And 
                    you re different.  I know that too.  
                    But you only don t fit in if you 
                    think you don t fit in.  You ve 
                    gotta fake it  til you make it.  
                    Trust me.    


      INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

      Meredith struts into the cafeteria with Irene, Bronwen, Lily 
      and Kelsey.  They turn heads and hold theirs high.      

                                  IRENE
                    I thought you had tennis.

                                  MEREDITH
                          (I m as surprised as you)
                    Yeah.  I thought I did too.

      Irene gets it.  They pass Joel, who smiles.  He sees what 
      Meredith s doing for the patrol.  They walk by Ginny and Kim.  
      As Meredith passes, Ginny stops her.  The girls continue on.                                                                                    35.


                                  GINNY
                    I may have been wrong this time, 
                    but I m not letting my guard down.

      Ginny menacingly licks a yogurt lid and hands it to Kim.

                                  GINNY (CONT D)
                    I m saving these for breast cancer 
                    research.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    Good luck with that.

      Meredith catches up to the group.  They sit down. 

                                  MEREDITH (CONT D)
                    See.  It wasn t that bad.  

                                  LILY
                    She s right.  

      The girls look around, nobody s paying much attention.  
      They re relieved.  They take out their sack lunches.  Joel 
      comes over.  Meredith stands up out of ear shot of the girls. 

                                  MEREDITH
                    About the restraining order thing--  

                                  JOEL
                    I don t need to know the whole 
                    story.  Your secret is safe with 
                    me.  In case you were worried.   

                                  MEREDITH
                    I thought I was gonna have to sleep 
                    with you to get you to stay quiet.
                          (off his reaction)
                    Kidding.  I d never sleep with you. 

                                  JOEL
                    But you do remember me from high 
                    school.  So, looks like I win.   

                                  MEREDITH
                    Of course I remember you.  That s 
                    how I know I d never sleep with 
                    you.

      Meredith sits back down.  Joel smiles.  A high school crush 
      just might have been reignited.  

                                  LILY
                    You aren t like Brie at all.  I 
                    hope you stay in Safety Patrol.                                                                                      36.


                                  KELSEY
                    You re gonna come back, right?

                                  MEREDITH
                    Only because I need the money.  

                                    BRONWEN
                    Ms. Davis, you re the coolest 
                    teacher we ve ever had.

                                  MEREDITH
                    Really?  The  best  teacher you ve 
                    ever had?  Wow.  Thanks.

                                    BRONWEN
                     Coolest  teacher.

                                  MEREDITH
                    The  best  teacher.  Aww.  You re 
                    probably just on your period.  
                          (then)
                    Okay, I m gonna grab lunch before 
                    the line gets any longer.     

      Meredith gets up and runs into Principal Carl.  

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    Sorry about earlier, but I want you 
                    to know I ve got your back.  I know 
                    you re gonna do great things here.  
                    And don t forget, next week is 
                    Crazy Sock Friday.  

                                  MEREDITH
                    It s on my calendar.  

      Meredith heads to the lunch line.  It s really really long.  
      She takes her place.  She has a place...  We PULL OUT to see 
      the crowded cafeteria, Meredith s home for now.    

                                      END OF ACT TWO                                                                                    37.


                                              TAG


      EXT. NIXON MIDDLE SCHOOL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

      All is calm at Nixon Middle School until we HEAR an alarm go 
      off.  The fire alarm.  Kids begin pouring out of the 
      cafeteria including the Safety Patrol girls, Joel, Irene, 
      Ginny, Kim and Principal Carl.         

                                  PRINCIPAL CARL
                    Everyone keep moving towards the 
                    faculty parking lot in an orderly 
                    fashion!  I said single file not 
                    triple file.      

      The kids head in an unorderly fashion to the faculty parking 
      lot.  Talking.  Yelling.  Running.  It s chaos.  


      INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS

      In an empty peaceful cafeteria, Meredith leisurely serves 
      herself lunch because there s no longer a line.  She has her 
      pick of tiny milks and square pizzas.  The last thing she 
      grabs is a shiny red apple.  She might be getting a little 
      bit better but she s still a  Bad Teacher ...
