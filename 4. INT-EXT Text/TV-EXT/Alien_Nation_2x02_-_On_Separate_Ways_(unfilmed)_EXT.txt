      Emily is at her locker, dressed in a little fashionless 
      dress. Buck drags up.

                                  BUCK
                    How's it going?

                                  EMILY
                    Root functions in calculus. I did that in 
                    the third grade.

                                  BUCK
                    No, I mean with the hairys.
                            (off her look)
                    The terts. The humans.

                                  EMILY
                    Haven't really met anyone.

                                  BUCK
                    Yeah, well don't plan on having a fan club.
                            (throws his books in her 
                            locker)
                    You mind if I stow these here for a while?

                                  EMILY
                    Where are you going?

                                  BUCK (covering)
                    I got a free period. Later.

      He's gone as a human teenage girl approaches and opens the 
      locker next to Emily's. She's dressed exactly the way Emily 
      was before her mother made her change her clothes. Her name 
      is Mindy Hooks. She notices Emily.

                                  MINDY
                    How you doing?                                  EMILY
                    Fine.

                                  MINDY
                    You go to school here.

                                  EMILY
                    I just started.

      Mindy starts applying a fresh coat of lipstick using the 
      mirror on the inside of her locker.

                                  MINDY
                    No kidding. You any relation to that other 
                    one?

                                  EMILY
                    Buck's my brother.

                                  MINDY
                    Cool.
                            (re: lipstick)
                    You want some?

                                  EMILY
                    I don't know. Sometimes Tenctonese have a 
                    bad reaction to makeup... at my age.

                                  MINDY
                    Yeah, right.
                            (shuts locker)
                    My mum would have killed me too, if I wore 
                    makeup at your age.

                                  EMILY
                    No really. It's a physical thing.

                                  MINDY
                    Sure.

      Mindy catches a handsome stud walk by and is drawn to him.

                                  EMILY
                    I don't think I'd have a problem.                                  MINDY
                    Yeah, well help yourself.
                            (calling)
                    Hey, Bobby... see ya kid.

      She takes off. As Emily watches her go, the CAMERA PULLS 
      BACK showing her alone in the empty hallway.


      To establish the city of love.


      The red dirt swirls as George stands before a flapping tent 
      in his slave clothing. Newcomers push by him in panic. 
      George is trying to wrestle a baby from a Newcomer female 
      who pleads, tears flowing. George is desperately trying to 
      communicate t the woman.

                                  GEORGE (V.O.)
                    It's not the same.

      BACK TO SCENE - ON SUSAN AND GEORGE

      Susan looks at George intensely.

                                  SUSAN
                    Then why is everything in me screaming to 
                    keep my family close?

      Seeing the pain in Susan's eyes, George pulls her close.


      Emily has her back to us as Buck speaks to her.

                                  BUCK
                    Well, how much did you use?

                                  EMILY
                    Barely any. A little lipstick and some 
                    mascara.

      THE CAMERA MOVES around to see Emily. Her eyes are starting 
      to swell closed and her lips are puffy.

                                  BUCK
                    You definitely clogged up something.

                                  EMILY
                    What am I going to do?

                                  BUCK
                    Get a note from the nurse and go home.

                                  EMILY
                    Sure and have mum kill me.

                                  BUCK
                    Better than staying around this place and 
                    have friendly terts give you the once over.

      They look at passing kids who stare and snicker as they       walk by.

                                  BUCK
                    Look, I gotta get out of here.

                                  EMILY
                    What do you mean? Don't you have classes?

                                  BUCK (uncomfortable)
                    Yeah, right. I'll see you later.

                                  EMILY
                    But what about me?

                                  BUCK
                    Look, Emily, it will go away in a couple of 
                    hours... I'd just wait a while till you 
                    tried painting your face again.

      He saunters off. Emily watches, more alone than ever, kids 
      walking by look at her puffy face and snicker.


      As the plane lands establishing the Parisian city.


        Establishing a quiet row of apartment buildings in the 
      Latin quarter.

                                  JARRE (V.O.)
                    Of course we sealed off the room 
                      immediately...


      As Susan moves from a large metal container to the flapping 
      opening of the tent, joining George with the Newcomer woman 
      who clings to her baby.

                                  SUSAN
                    {She doesn't understand we want to help 
                    her. Prepare the container for loading... 
                    I'll try.}

      George spots something.

      ANGLE - ON APPROACHING OVERSEERS

      As they move through a limbo cloud of red blowing dust, 
      some kind of breathing device over their mouths.

      BACK TO SCENE

      As George grabs Susan.

                                  GEORGE
                    {We have to leave her.}

                                  SUSAN
                    {No.}

                                  GEORGE
                    {We have no choice. They'll find all the 
                    others.}

                                  SUSAN
                    {No. We can't.}

      As the two struggle we,

      END FLASHBACK


      As the overseers, their faces protected with futuristic, 
      minimal gas masks, walk through the blowing dust, now       holding the Newcomer woman who clings to her baby.

                                  OVERSEER ONE
                    {We're running out of time. This storm is 
                    building too quickly.}

                                  OVERSEER TWO
                    {The tech team can't find a way to reverse 
                    the virus.}

                                  OVERSEER ONE
                    {Then leave them all. Sterilise the ship 
                    and let's move.}

                                  OVERSEER TWO
                    {On your command.}

                                  OVERSEER ONE
                    {Leave them all. This exercise has already 
                    cost us an unfortunate delay.}

      They move on and the CAMERA PANS to the flapping tent door 
      where we see the suggestion of Susan and George.

                                  EMILY (V.O.)
                    Mum. Mum are you all right.

      END FLASHBACK


      As the overseers we saw before continue past the tent where 
      George and Susan are loading equipment.

                                  OVERSEER ONE
                            (shouting above the building 
                            storm)
                    {Leave them all. Load the equipment and our 
                    workers and move out.}

                                  OVERSEER TWO
                    {On your command.}

      They move past George and Susan who have heard the doomsday 
      command.

                                  SUSAN (V.O.)
                    We had to save the babies... we had to.

      DISSOLVE TO


      Strong symbols make up this fashionable graffiti. A roller 
      of white wash covers it.

      WIDEN TO INCLUDE

      George, in city-issued coveralls, stirring paint, is 
      watching Sikes, dressed in similar fashion, paint out the 
      graffiti with a roller on a long pole.

                                  GEORGE
                    You really think by painting out this 
                    gangs' slogans they are going to show up?                                  SIKES
                    These slogans mean more to them than their 
                    mothers. It's their mark, their life... you 
                    wipe it out, you wipe them out.

                                  GEORGE
                    And they'll return to resurrect themselves.

                                  SIKES
                    They'll return with spray cans to piss on 
                    the wall again.

                                  DAVID (V.O.)
                    You got a reason to be doing that?

      George and Sikes turn to see, David, Alan and Rick, whom we 
      recognise from the opening act as the abductors of the 
      Newcomer baby. Donned in their white shirts, black ties and 
      pants, they are White Peepo.

                                  SIKES
                    You got a reason to care?

                                  RICK
                    You're messin' with our tags.

                                  GEORGE
                    You're White Peepo?

      David pulls a knife and puffs up.

                                  DAVID
                    Go do your cleaning somewhere else.

      George and Sikes exchange a look. George puts his stirring 
      stick down reaching for his gun strapped to his ankle as 
      Sikes placates the gang.

                                  SIKES
                    I haven't got a problem with that. You got 
                    a problem with that, George?

                                  GEORGE (ready for action)
                    Well, yes, actually I do.

      The two start walking off, when suddenly Sikes turns with 
      the soggy roller on the pole, smacking David hard on the 
      head. Simultaneously, George turns, his gun aimed at the       other boys as David goes down to the ground, his knife 
      flying out of his hand.

                                  GEORGE
                    We're police officers... you're under 
                    arrest.

      The other boys immediately put up their hands, scared out 
      of their minds. Sikes moves in on David, cuffing the paint-
      soaked minor.

                                  SIKES (RE: DAVID)
                    Looks like White Peepo just got a little 
                    whiter.


      Through a LONG LENS we watch as Rick walks down the street, 
      cradling a box which holds Vessna, in his gang uniform -- 
      black tie and white shirt -- and moves to a row of pay 
      phones. PULLBACK TO REVEAL,

      George and Sikes as they sit in their car on the opposite 
      side of the street watching Rick.

                                  GEORGE
                    I don't think we should be so exposed.

                                  SIKES
                    I'm not letting that box out of my sight.

                                  GEORGE
                    Vessna is quite comfortable. The buildings 
                    are covered. There's a man at every corner. 
                    You're more nervous than I am.                                  SIKES
                    Well, I'm sorry, but I happen to be the one 
                    who pulled that little girl out of you and 
                    I kind of don't want to see anything happen 
                    to her.

                                  GEORGE
                    I gave birth to her and neither do I.

                                  SIKES
                    Fine. So why are we doing this?

      George is distracted by the action on the street where we 
      see, Rick reacting and moving to the phone. He nods, and 
      listens.

      INTERCUT WITH

      George and Sikes watching from the car.

                                  GEORGE

      ANGLE ON RICK as he carries the box and tips it to a 
      partially lowered rear window of the Cadillac.

      ANGLE ON THE BOX to REVEAL little Vessna comfortably lying 
      inside.

      BACK TO SCENE OVER SIKES AND GEORGE to see in the distance 
      the window of the Cadillac go up, the back door pops open, 
      and Rick climbs in with Vessna.

      THE BLACK CADILLAC drives off, Sikes and George doing a 
      leisurely U-turn and following.

      ANOTHER ANGLE - ON THE CADILLAC as it turns down a side 
      street and parks.

      SIKES AND GEORGE are at a traffic light looking down the 
      block at the car.

                                  GEORGE
                    They've obviously checked the authenticity 
                    of the baby.

                    This gang punk is rolling over on us. I 
                    know it. We should have wired him.

                                  GEORGE
                    It'd be the first thing Salamandra would 
                    pick up.

      ON THE BLACK CADILLAC as the back door opens and Rick gets 
      out holding the box. He carefully tucks Vessna's arm 
      inside.

      A WHITE CADILLAC rounds the corners and pulls up between 
      Rick and the black Cadillac. the back door pops open. Rick 
      gets in.      ON THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL as it turns green. George isn't 
      moving through the signal and the driver behind him is 
      getting anxious. The driver leans on his horn.

                                  SIKES
                    We gotta do something.

      George starts through intersection slowly. Both men stare 
      at the white Cadillac, waiting for "The" signal.

      ON THE WHITE CADILLAC - GEORGE AND SIKES POV

      As the back window goes down and we see Rick spit. George 
      and Sikes react to the spit.

                                  SIKES
                    That's it.

      Sikes grabs the walkie-talkie, while George does a high 
      speed U-turn in the intersection barrelling down on the 
      Cadillac.

      TWO BLACK AND WHITES round the corner.

      TWO MORE BLACK AND WHITES join Sikes and George in the 
      charge.

      THE WHITE CADILLAC jerks to a halt, the front door opens, 
      and Salamandra, a little man in a baggy over coat, jumps 
      out, slicing on foot through heavy traffic, causing two 
      cars to collide, and sending,

      GEORGE AND SIKES' CAR leaping the curb into a newspaper 
      rack.

      Sikes leaps out but is stopped momentarily by George as he 
      gets out of the car, touching his ear plug.

                                  GEORGE
                    He has the baby.

      They look up to see Salamandra get into a cab and drive 
      off.
