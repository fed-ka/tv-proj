        The 90s now.  Cole with HIS WIFE, TESS.  Smarter than he 
        is, but hampered by practicality.  They walk through the 
          ancient, hand-painted cave.

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE
                        26,000 years since a human set foot 
                        in here.  Yet all these images of 
                        bison, elk... they look like they 
                        were painted yesterday.  I think 
                        art was born, right here.

          openly, respectfully, sadly.  A PHOTO OF COLE HANGS.

                        He was my hero.

          CLOSE ON:  LINCOLN COLE.  28 now.  All his father s rugged 
            independence, with none of his exhibitionism.  Sharp, 
          tough, happiest in quiet settings, which this is not.  He 
        is currently being hugged way too hard by someone --

                                            LINCOLN
                        You didn t have to come all this 
                        way.

        We see the squeezer is an emotional Hispanic man, EMILIO 
          VALENZUELA (50s, out of place among this sea of suits).  He 
          speaks English intelligently, but haltingly.

                                            EMILIO
                        For Doc, I go anywhere in the 
                        world.  I owe him my life.  I come 
                        out of prison, no one want me.  Doc 
                        give me a home on that boat.  I 
                        should have been with him.

          Lincoln moves on.  Walks towards the stage.  WELL-WISHERS 
        stop him to offer condolences.  He presses through --

          Until he sees LENA LANDRY (mid-20s now, still fearless, 
          abrasively competent).  The only other person here who 
          knows exactly what he s going through.  Beat.  So much to 
        say there s nowhere to start.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Hell of a place to catch up.                                                                                      4.

                                            LENA
                        Tell me we re not doing this too 
                        soon?  We should ve kept looking.

                                            LINCOLN
                        You did.  Everyone did.  After six 
                        months... we need to let them go.

        She nods.  Knowing he s right.  Hating it.

                                            LENA
                        Your mom didn t come.  How is she?

          Lincoln shakes his head.  Not good.  JUMP CUT TO:



          Lincoln takes to the podium.  Looks out at the audience.

          QUIET.  Someone COUGHS.  He is about to eulogize his own 
          father.  He looks to the CAMERA FOLLOWING his every move.  
          Cracks a smile.  He knows the game: to the world his family 
        is all sunshine and lollipops.  Regardless of the truth.

                                            LINCOLN
                         Keep the cameras rolling, they 
                        might strike gold. 
                                (LAUGHTER, beat)
                        This is all hard to believe.  As a 
                        kid I d watch my father on TV and 
                        the voice would come up,  Next 
                        week, Emmet Cole may not survive 
                        what he finds in the cave...   I d 
                        be terrified he wouldn t come home.  
                        He always did.
                                (beat)
                        Then six months ago we got the call.
                                (beat)
                        I m not alone in loss today.

          Camera catches LENA in the crowd.  A smile back.

                        His crew went where they shouldn t.  
                        Because my father... he believed 
                        more than anything that the age of 
                        discovery was only just beginning.                                                                                      5.

                                            LINCOLN (V.O.)
                        Before the Amazon expedition, he 
                        said this was going to be his 
                        greatest discovery.  The one that 
                        changes everything.  He had hope 
                        like most people have troubles...

        BACK ON LINCOLN.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Today we give up hope.
                                (beat)
                        My father spent his life making the 
                        show you all loved.  He missed a 
                        lot of things for it.  I can t tell 
                        you how many times in my life 
                        people ve stopped me and said, 
                         Hey, your dad s my hero.   He was 
                        a lot of people s hero.
                                (beat)
                        I wish I could...

        He stops.  Trails off...  Almost getting real for a moment.  
          People in the audience sense the tension.  Uneasy.

          Lincoln looks at his speech.  Three pages to go.  A long 
          beat.  Then... folds up the pages.  Puts on a smile for the 
          crowd.  Finding a booster shot of charm:

                                            LINCOLN
                        Aw hell, my father was the show 
                        more than anything.  Let s watch 
                        some.  Lights, please --

          Relief from everyone.  LIGHTS DROP.  PROJECTED BEHIND HIM:

          A MONTAGE OF EMMET COLE COMES ALIVE ON A SCREEN.  CLIPS OF 
        HIM GIVING HIS SIGNATURE CATCH PHRASE.  AGAIN AND AGAIN...

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE
                        There s magic out there...

        And somehow every time he says it, it feels true.  The 
          CROWD adores it.  The only one still uncharmed is... 

          Lincoln.  The projected IMAGES overshadow him.  Nothing 
        he s not used to.



          A CAMERA TEST.  DIFFERENT LENSES TRIED OUT.  FOCUSING ON:                                                                                      6.

        This documentary s PRODUCER.  No accident he s framed with 
        his EMMYS behind him.  He competed for his success.  
          Roughly.  A gift for inserting/extracting himself from the 
          action for maximum effect.  And for stirring the shit.  
          CHYRON IDENTIFIES HIM:  CLARK QUITELY.  SERIES PRODUCER.

                        You ready?

          Camera finds...  TESS (late 40s now).  Cole s wife.  We 
          recognize her from the old footage.  Time and loss has 
          taken the laugh out of her eyes, replacing it with 
            thoughtfulness.  Determination.  A beat.

                                            TESS
                        We shouldn t do this to him.
                                (Clark holds silent)
                        Yeah.  Let s go.



          A place to get drunk and be left alone.  Tess finds 
          Lincoln, striving for both.  Still in his suit.

                                            TESS
                        You re drinking too much.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Yes, I have that good fortune.

                                            TESS
                        Take a break.  We need to talk.

                                            LINCOLN
                        I had a shitty day.  We buried my 
                        father.  Why are they following 
                        you?

        He means the CAMERAS, the crew.  Following his mother.  
          There s little in life he hates more than being filmed.                                                                                      7.

          (NOTE:  As in a true documentary, characters will swear 
          naturally and we ll BLEEP it out.  Similarly, we won t use 
           fake  brands, only blur out real ones.)

                                            TESS
                        We need to talk.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Turn off the cameras, talk all day.
                              (but the camera stays)
                        I let you cover the memorial, you 
                        have an episode.  Make it a two 
                        hour.  Enough already.

                                            TESS
                        You didn t bury him.

                                            LINCOLN
                        We said goodbye.  We let go.  You 
                        should have been there.

                                            TESS
                        I couldn t come because he s not 
                        dead --

                                            LINCOLN
                        Mom -- we had this conversation.  
                        He s legally dead.  He s actually 
                        dead.  I wish he wasn t --

                                            TESS
                        -- He s not dead.  I d know.  I 
                        spent my life with him.  We had no 
                        secrets.  I know everything about 
                        him.  I d know if he was dead.

          Something in her insistence rankles Lincoln, making him 
        less kind than he ought to be.

                                            LINCOLN
                        That s the difference.  I didn t 
                        spend my whole life with him.  My 
                        whole life was waiting for him to 
                        come back from Kenya or Peru for my 
                        birthday, graduation...  You d be 
                        there.  And I d just know he was 
                        gonna make it too...  He never did.  
                        To me, this feels like just another 
                        birthday.  See?  We re talking.  
                        This is fun.

                                            TESS
                        You re pissed at me -- I m sure you 
                        think you have a reason.  I don t 
                        care.  I m going down there.  To 
                        find him.  
                                            (MORE)                                                                                      8.

                                            TESS (CONT'D)
                        Listen to me -- we have a boat -- 
                        we have a crew.  The network is 
                        paying for everything if I let them 
                        shoot --

                          LINCOLNTESS
          What?  You can t go back to -- He knows the Amazon 
        the Amazon --better than anyone, no 
                                                    matter what happened, he d 
                                                    survive there --

                                            LINCOLN
                        Yeah, he would.  He could survive 
                        anywhere, eating bugs and filtering 
                        water through his socks as long as 
                        it took to get to a phone and call 
                        you.  But he didn t.  He didn t.

          A long beat.  Tess drops her bomb.

                        They found his beacon.  Yesterday.  
                        4:02 PM, Eastern.  The emergency 
                        signal went off.  His personal 
                        frequency.  After six months.

          Lincoln stops.  Weighing the news.  Deciding whether to 
          allow hope back in.

                                            LINCOLN
                        That doesn t -- it could have been 
                        anything.

                                            TESS
                        It could have been him.
                                (then)
                        I m going down there.  We have a 
                        boat and a crew.  We ll find his 
                        ship.  And we ll find him.
                              (and then)
                        I need you to come with me.

        He finishes his drink.  Sets it down.  Striving for calm.

                                            LINCOLN
                        This hasn t been easy for me 
                        either.  I wish he was still alive, 
                        because I have a lot I wish I d 
                        said to him.  I said my goodbyes.  
                        I m done putting my grief on 
                        display --

                        Mom.  Listen to me.  I m going back 
                        to school in a week, I start my 
                        residency in Chicago.  I got a 
                        really good placement -- they 
                        approved my research on the NMDA 
                        mouse, the allosteric site, so I 
                        can work on my PhD too.  You might 
                        even be proud.  Come visit.

        He kisses her, tosses a few bills.  Walks out.  Tess 
          follows, out to --



          RAINING AGAINST THE WINDOW.  The fickle rainforest storms.  
        The boat ROCKS pukeably.  Get used to it.                                                                                    12.

        Tess steers them down the choppy river.  She holds a SONAR 
          SIGNAL FINDER, TRACKING THE BEACON.  It s miles ahead.  She 
          looks out, as if she could already see him.  Hoping.



          Cramped quarters.  Noisy.  Where EMILIO feels most at home.  
        He s here too.  Sanding down a dinged prop.

                        This Red Cross thing, this is no

                        come on this trip, go home.   I 
                        say,  Fuck you, this is my home.   
                        Next morning, they left without me.  
                        Left me keys to his sailboat, note 
                        says it s my pension.  After 23 
                        years.  I thought he was mad at me.

          Sammy s camera lingers.  She s annoyed by it.  And him.

          Reese brought guns, a Bible, and little else.  He re-
          inventories his guns, like a catechism.  Looks to camera:                                                                                    14.

          Sammy SLIPS on the deck, falls.  Looks at his Converse.  
          Definitely the wrong shoes for this.



        THE MOON shines huge and star-supported in the unpolluted 
        sky.  The boat CHUGS on.  Crew wound down.  CAMERA GRABS:

        -- Tess combs the map for an idea.  Absolutely not crying.

        -- Lincoln tries to read on an iPad.  The light from the 
          screen draws fat BUGS.  He flicks them off.

        ON CLARK -- taking it all in from the bow of The Magus, 
          which is RUNNING, sailing through the clear morning.  A 
          magical place.  A rare moment of introspection.

                        I liked Emmet.  We were colleagues 
                        a long time.  Argued a lot.  Won a 
                        lot of awards as a result.  What he 
                        never got is that all this wasn t 
                        about adventure.  It was a product.  
                        His show s syndicated around the 
                        world.  Translated into 65 
                        languages.  He sold them a belief 
                        in fantasy.   Magic.   So yeah, 
                        we re getting another bunch of 
                        episodes out of him, alive or dead.  
                        And it gives Tess something to do.

                        He barely saw a dime.  He didn t

        Hard to tell if we believe him.

          NOTE:  This is our first example of a convention of the

          CRASHING IN, AS WE -- SMASH BACK TO:



        The Team RUSHES THROUGH the ship.  It s dark, cramped,

        way across the floor.  STAINS in strange places.

        DEEP GASHES DUG INTO THE METAL WALLS.

          Reese finds a METAL PIPE, uses it to BANG THE WALL.                                                                                    24.

        No answer.  He hits again, twice.  Then -- TWO BANGS BACK.  
        An intelligent response.  THEY FOLLOW IT TO --



        Even darker here, making them rely on the CAMERA LIGHTS.

        They run.  A foot of fetid WATER on the floor.  They stop

        Tess POUNDS on it.

                                            REESE
                        Why would someone --

          WHAM!  WHAM!  Whatever s inside SHOULDERS against the door.  
          RATTLING THE HALL.  They startle.  But then... hope.  
          SOMEONE S INSIDE.  Tess SHOUTS to the door.

                                            TESS
                        We re here!  Listen -- we re here!  
                        Save your strength!   We re going 
                        to get you out.

          A small KNOCK of understanding.  Followed by sad 
          SCRATCHING.  Like a dog locked outside.  JUMP CUT TO:                                                                                    25.

          SPARKS -- FLYING OFF THE DOOR.

          Reese CUTS with a circular saw.  Lincoln keeps tension on 
        the door with a crowbar.  Rough work.  Lincoln doesn t 
          care.  His father -- or Lena s -- may actually be alive.

                                            REESE
                        This is gonna be a while.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Get a med kit, prep an IV -- who 
                        knows what shape they could be in.

        Lena goes.  Reese and Lincoln keep at it.  All the while, 
        that PAWING on the door from inside.

          Camera PANS THE WALLS.  Lines of SCRATCHES here too.



        The SAW ECHOES as... Clark and Tess find the editing suite.  
          A small room, PACKED with equipment, Avids, endless memory 
          towers, HUNDREDS of tapes.  And the heart of the room:

        104 SCREENS OF VARIOUS SIZE.  Like casino surveillance.

          A HUM FROM BELOW, THE GENERATOR COMES TO LIFE.  A SIREN 
          BLARES -- jolting them.  Quickly killed.  LIGHTS COME ON 
          THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.  The power is back on.

          Clark smiles, flicks on the video equipment.

        OVER HALF THE SCREENS COME TO LIFE.  MOUNTED CAMERAS FROM 
        ALL OVER THE SHIP.  STILL WORKING.  THE Magus HAS BEEN 
          WIRED WITH 104 CAMERAS, ALL NIGHT-VISION EQUIPPED, ABLE TO 
          CATCH ACTION ALL OVER THE BOAT.  INSIDE AND OUT, ABOVE AND 
          BELOW, BOW TO STERN.  EVEN A META-CAM COVERING THIS EDITING 
        BAY OVERHEAD.  ADJAY FILMS IT FILMING HIM, WAVES.

          Clark works the controls.  The camera overhead ZOOMS, 
          SWIVELS, TRACKING.  He lights up like a sparkler.

                                            CLARK
                        Hello old friend.

        In addition to Sammy and Adjay s cameras, we now have 
          access to all these.  WHICH WE CUT BETWEEN FREELY.  The 
          coverage game just exploded wide open.

                                            CLARK
                              (to Adjay)
                        Get the rest up.  I want every inch 
                        of this boat covered.  Get the 
                        editing bay live too -- log it all, 
                        we can cut as we go --                                                                                    26.

                                            TESS
                        Hold on.  You don t cut.  I cut.  
                        This is Emmet s bay, he had final 
                        say over every episode.

                                            CLARK
                        You re not him.  Unless he walks 
                        out of that safe, this is my bay.

        On Tess, her frustration covered by the overhead camera.  
        She looks to the MONITOR covering Reese as he CUTS into the 
          panic room.  Hopeful.



        THE MOUNTED CAMERAS FIND LENA.  JUMP CUT THROUGH her 
          movements as we FOLLOW HER -- searching around the ship.  
          Unaware she can be seen.  Looking for something.

        She stops at -- A FOOT LOCKER.  Takes out a KEY, tries it.  
          Doesn t fit.  The LIGHTS FLICKER, grow BRIGHTER, as we --



          Emilio tunes the generator, which HUMS louder.  Making the 
          LIGHTS throughout the ship BRIGHTEN.

          Emilio looks.  This is his and Jahel s room on the boat.  
        It s in shambles.  The engine, his baby, is beaten up.  
          METAL TWISTED.  DEEP GASHES.  Three inches of water on the 
          floor.  It hurts to look.  In PORTUGUESE, SUBTITLED:

                                            EMILIO
                          I should ve died young and drunk.  
                        Hard to see her like this.

                                            JAHEL
                        They shouldn t open it.

        She means the safe.  Emilio knows that look.  Fear.  It 
          makes her look 10 again.

                                            EMILIO
                        Doc could be inside.

                                            JAHEL
                        It s not him...  It s not him.

          Strange certainty.  Emilio s reaction suggests a bad memory.  
        He pushes it down.  Returns to the solidity of the engine.

                                            EMILIO
                        Help me take this apart.  See if 
                        there s hope for her.                                                                                    27.



        Tess enters alone.  She spent a good part of her life in 
        this room.  Sees the sad state of it, everything overturned.

          A fallen PHOTO of Emmet, Tess and Lincoln.  Happier days.  
        His FILE SAFE -- LOCKED.  His HAT.  Tess picks it up.  
          Feels for a moment like she s cradling his neck.

                                            TESS
                        Please be in there...

        Then sees ON THE FLOOR:  A SMALL, WATERPROOF CAMCORDER.



          Lena, Clark crowd around Tess as she sets fresh batteries 
        into the camcorder.  Turns it on, heart racing.

          (NOTE:  This will be our first taste of what the peak 
          horror moments of this show are like:  THE SUBJECT IS NEVER 
        SEEN STRAIGHT ON -- BUT IN HALF-CAUGHT MOMENTS -- MOVING 
          CAMERAS -- SUBJECTIVE GLIMPSES OF TERROR.  Something for 
        the audience to imagine -- and speculate on -- and post 
          about online -- and rewind a dozen times until they re 
          convinced it s safe to fall asleep.)

          COLE S LAST IMAGES RECORDED PLAY ON THE SMALL SCREEN:

          A CRISP DAY.  A pretty shot as he tracks a brightly colored 
        tree frog.  Then -- an abrupt shift to --

          NIGHT.  A RUNNING SHOT THROUGH THE MAGUS.  AS IF CHASED.  
          CLOSE, CRAMPED.  HARD TO SEE.  SCREAMS:   THIS WAY!    GO! 

          A BLOW -- THE CAMERA IS DROPPED -- SOMEONE FALLS -- AN 
          ANIMAL GROWL -- CRUNCH OF BONE --

        AN ARM FALLS INTO FRAME -- SEVERED -- THE RECORDING ENDS.

        Tess DROPS the camcorder.

                                            TESS
                        That s the kitchen --



        PAN around as Tess enters.  The space matches the camcorder 
          footage.  Tess pulls at the overturned stove.  Too heavy.  
          Clark helps her.  SCREECHING as it DRAGS, REVEALING:

          Right where it fell in the video:  A HUMAN ARM.  
          Desiccated.  Tattered sleeve still attached.                                                                                    28.



          Reese still cutting.  Not slowing, despite the heat.  The 
        saw blade glows with the effort.  Lincoln still at his 
          side.  Both washed in sweat.

          Clark and Tess watch, impatient after their discovery.

        The pawing at the door has STOPPED.

                                            TESS
                        How long is this gonna take?

          Reese just keeps cutting.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Any one of those missing men could 
                        be trapped in there, for who knows 
                        how long.  My father -- Lena s --

                        It ll take what it takes.  This is

                        No it isn t.
                              (to Lincoln)
                        The portal.

                                            LINCOLN
                                (catching on)
                        Tide s up, I can dive under.

                        This used to be a smuggling ship, 
                        there s a portal underneath they 
                        used to unload drugs.  We used to 
                        play in here, swim under, scare the 
                        hell out of everyone.  My Dad bolted 
                        it shut.  Maybe he can cut through.

                                            CLARK
                        Hold it -- this isn t diving water, 
                        there could be piranha down there --

                                            LINCOLN
                                (masking fear)
                        Then you get one hell of an episode.



        THE SAW SPITS SPARKS.  Finally, Reese flicks it off.

                                            REESE
                        We re in.

        All tense.  It s time.  Lena has the medkit.  Reese grips 
        his sidearm.  Lincoln turns the handle -- A METAL CLUNK.

        He swings the vault door slowly.

        An acrid smell makes them cringe.  Darkness inside.

          Lincoln steps in, followed by camera.

          Steps past shredded cloth hanging from the ceiling.

          Steps on rotted food.  SOMETHING RUSTLES in the back.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Hello -- who s in here?

          A lump of blankets MOVES, as if rising and falling, as if 
        with shallow breaths.  Lincoln moves to it.

          KICKING A WOODEN OBJECT OUT OF THE WAY.

        He crouches low.  Reaches out a hand.  Touches the blanket.

          Slowly begins to peel it back.

                                            LINCOLN
                        We re here to help.                                                                                    31.

          Peels it back further.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Dad?

          Suddenly, the thing under the blanket STOPS MOVING -- 

        AND SCREAMS -- JERKS FORWARD -- TOO FAST TO SEE -- 

        IT KNOCKS LINCOLN BACK -- RACES THROUGH THE OTHERS --

        OUT OF THE VAULT --

        LENA IS THROWN DOWN --  SCREAMS -- REESE S GUN FIRES --



          CAMERA FOLLOWS AN INDISTINCT FORM -- IT CHITTERS AWAY --

          A WINDOW SHATTERS, BLOWS OUT -- IT ESCAPES TO --



          Emilio nurses The Magus s engine, which RUNS.  Promising 
          better days ahead.

                                            EMILIO
                        When she was small, five, six, 
                        Jahel, she slept there --
                                (points under a shelf)
                        Always like a rock. One night she 
                        comes to me, I play cards upstairs 
                        with Doc, and she says,  Papa, 
                        come, you have to tell Ghost Friend 
                        to be quiet.   I think one of the 
                        new crew is bothering my girl.  I 
                        get my gun.  I come here, I say 
                        which man was it. She says it was 
                        not a man, it was Ghost Friend.  
                        She wants to sleep, but Ghost 
                        Friend... keeps talking to her.  
                         Tell him to be quiet.  So I say, 
                         Ghost friend, be quiet.  A few 
                        days later I ask her if there is 
                        still a voice bothering her. She 
                        says,  No.  No bother.  Ghost 
                        Friend talks more quiet now. 
                                (still unnerved, in 
                                  PORTUGUESE)
                        I did not like this Ghost Friend.

                                                                  SHOCK CUT BACK TO:



          ...Where Tess looks over Emmet s camcorder.  The ATTACK 
          FOOTAGE.  The SOUNDS.  The savagery.  A FORM THE CAMERA 
          CAN T FOCUS ON.  SO SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY JUST SAW.

                                            CLARK
                        You think it was the same thing 
                        that was in the panic room?                                                                                    34.

                        What the hell was it?

                        Probably just a panther.  Must ve 
                        gone through a vent as a baby, grew 
                        too big to get out.  I ll look.

          Panther?  No one s buying it.  Lincoln looks to his mother, 
        not liking this.  The full measure of his patience spent.



          Reese s FLASHLIGHT scans THE PANIC ROOM.  Gun cocked.  
          Emilio beside him, finding the nerve to step in.

          Jahel comes in behind him with none of his hesitation.

        They look at the blankets.

                                            REESE
                        No scat.  That was no animal.

          Something on the floor:  A GUN.  Distinct.  Ivory-handled.

        They step out.  Completely overlooking A WOODEN BOWL on the 
          floor (the one we saw under the blanket).  A CLASP with a 
        LID to seal it tight.

          Jahel sees it.  Picks it up.  Turns it in her hands.

        Sees it is stained on the inside with DRIED BLOOD.



          Reese puts that GUN on a table for the Team to see.

                                            REESE
                        That mean anything to anyone?

                              (off Clark, spits)
                        Was a son of a bitch.

        Lena registers the name.  She knows something.  Hesitates --

                        Before they went missing, Emmet 
                        said Travers caught a fever.  They 
                        thought he wouldn t make it.                                                                                    35.

                                            TESS
                                (beat, surprised)
                        Emmet spoke to you.  From here?

                                            LENA
                                (making light of it)
                        Emailed.  He had some questions 
                        about how to back up files.  Always 
                        worried about a server crash.

          Camera HOLDS ON LENA.  If it s a lie, it s a good one.



        Lena walks, limping.  Her leg freshly dressed.  MOUNTED 
          CAMERAS follow as she resumes her secret search, unaware 
          cameras can see.  CHYRON:  NIGHT 4.  10:15 PM.

        JUMP CUTS as she checks under benches, floorboards...



          Still with Lena.  She peels back an electrical panel and 
          finds... THE LOCKED FILE SAFE.  She tries that KEY again...

        IT OPENS.  Inside:  SHELVES PACKED WITH VIDEOS.  DVDS.  
        Like in the edit bay, but when we ZOOM IN -- 

        WE SEE THEY ARE ALL LABELED IN A STRANGE CODE.  Lena 
          checks, makes sure no one else has seen this.



          Emilio CROWBARS open a chest.  CANNED GOODS spill out.  
          Water.  Food in bar form.  The boat s reserve.  Lincoln 
          knifes open a can of peaches on a marlinspike, hands it to 
          Jahel.  She doesn t take it.  Upset.  He sets the can down.

          Lincoln and Emilio collect the cans.

                                            LINCOLN
                        All that time you sailed with my 
                        father, you see anything like that?  
                        Any idea what it could be?

                                            EMILIO
                                (beat)
                        Before he fire me... your father 
                        started to spend nights off the 
                        boat.  All night.  By hisself.  No 
                        food, no gear.  I told Doc I worry 
                        about him.  He said I shouldn t 
                        worry.  He was protected.                                                                                    36.

                                            LINCOLN
                        By a gun?

                                            EMILIO
                        By magic.

          Lincoln gives a polite nod.  Ooookay.  Jahel speaks up -- 
          urgent.  SUBTITLED:

                                            JAHEL
                        He does not believe.  Tell him.

                                            EMILIO
                        Eat your peaches.

                                            JAHEL
                        I am no child to be silenced with 
                        treats --

        She shows Lincoln that WOODEN BOWL.  (NOT SUBTITLED).

                                            JAHEL
                        You need to see -- look!  It tasted 
                        blood, it will be stronger now --

          Emilio quiets her in Portuguese.  But she continues.

                                            LINCOLN
                        What s she saying?
                              (to Jahel)
                        You know what that thing was?  It s 
                        okay.  Tell me.

          Jahel locks eyes with her father.  She begins answering.

          Beat.  Then, reluctantly, Emilio TRANSLATES as she speaks, 
          talking over her.  So the legend is spoken in doublets.

                                            JAHEL / EMILIO
                         It was not an animal.  It was 
                        Corpo Seco.  The dry spirit...  A 
                        soul so bitter the ground would not 
                        take him.  And the Devil sent him 
                        back.  So it wanders the land where 
                        it died.  Looking for blood to make 
                        it whole.  More blood, more 
                        strength. 

                                            LINCOLN
                        You think it s some kind of ghost.

        She touches the bowl.  INTERCUT Jahel with NIGHT VISION 
          SHOTS from MOUNTED CAMERAS on the gunwhales, looking off 
        the boat into the wind-strewn night.  A place for ghosts.                                                                                    37.

                                            JAHEL / EMILIO
                        This.  This is Kraho.  From chonta 
                        palm.  Full of tsarutama.  Holy.  
                        The shaman use this to catch the 
                        angry soul.  A soul trapped inside 
                        suffers worse than Hell s heart... 
                        but can hurt no one.
                                (Jahel looks inside)
                        Blood.  Your father trick Corpo 
                        Seco.  It come to drink the blood, 
                        they catch it... close him up 
                        inside...  But we open.  We feed it 
                        blood.  Now it is strong enough.

                                            LINCOLN
                        To what?

                                            JAHEL
                        To hunt us.

        Off Lincoln... fear rising...  SMASH CUT TO:



          Lincoln storms through.  On a mission.



          Lincoln finds Tess studying a map with Clark, Reese, Lena.

                                            LINCOLN
                        We re going.  Right now.  Pack what 
                        you need, everyone on the Zodiacs --

                            TESSCLARK
          What?  --Hang on a minute --

                                            LINCOLN
                        We re not safe.  Someone is out 
                        there -- I don t know if it s an 
                        animal or a guy on drugs -- or just 
                        the crew is on drugs.  But people 
                        died here -- and we could be next --

          Clark finds this ridiculous.  Lena looks uneasy.

                                            TESS
                        Whatever attacked us killed at 
                        least one man on The Magus and 
                        forced it afoul.  Any survivors 
                        would be on foot -- we re isolating 
                        places they might take shelter.  We 
                        are going to find them.  
                                            (MORE)                                                                                    38.

                                            TESS (CONT'D)
                        I am not leaving this close to 
                        finding your father --

                          LINCOLNTESS
        If he s still alive --Someone welded that thing in 
                                                    -- someone survived.

          Holding fast to faith.  Beat.  Reese speaks up.  To Tess.

                                            REESE
                        You re captain here, so this is 
                        your call --

                                            CLARK
                        Excuse me, she is not --

          Reese shuts him right the fuck up with a look that d make a 
        rock shitsquirt.  Turns to Tess.  Voice calm, compelling:

                                            REESE
                        Your son cares about you and that 
                        counts for something.  But you 
                        hired me for a bucket of money to 
                        keep you safe and find your 
                        husband.  I promise you, I can and 
                        will do both of those.  We are 
                        here.  We have a trail.  I intend 
                        to follow it and see your family -- 
                        your entire family -- home safe.  
                        It s your call.

        Tess looks from Reese to Lincoln.  For a rare moment, 
          Lincoln s guarded exterior goes soft.  Goes honest.

                                            LINCOLN
                        I lost my father to this place.  
                        I m not losing two of you.

        The one thing he could leverage to get through.  Love.  
          Under all his resentment.  As much as Tess wants to press 
        on, she can t fight that.  She nods.  Okay...  JUST THEN --

        THE SHIP ROCKS.  VIOLENTLY.  SHOUTS FROM THE MAIN DECK.

                                            LENA (O.S.)
                        Up here!  Something out here! --

        WITH LINCOLN, TESS, REESE, RACING OUT -- THE SHIP LURCHING.



          Reese is uncomfortable in front of the camera.

                                            REESE
                        16 years DEVGRU, Blue.  Yeah, I was 
                        Navy.  Now I m not.  Guess I like 
                        my freedom.

                                            SAMMY (O.S.)
                        You ever kill anyone?  How many?

                                            REESE
                                (beat, hard stare)
                        You ask a man how many girls he s 
                        had, what kinda drugs he s tried, 
                        and if he s drunk, what he really 
                        thinks about God.  You don t ask a 
                        man that.

        He walks off.  Interview over.



        ON TESS, taking a break from her map work.

                                            TESS
                        People always tell me they loved 
                        Emmet s show growing up not because 
                        of the nature or the travel... but 
                        they wanted to be part of our 
                        perfect little family.  That was 
                        the secret sauce.  And it worked 
                        because it wasn t a TV lie.  On 
                        screen we were pretty damn perfect.  
                        Off screen... not too far from it.
                                (beat)
                        I mean we had our problems, sure...  
                        Our secrets...  Who doesn t?

                                                                        SMASH BACK TO:                                                                                    41.


          LINCOLN, COMING AT ADJAY, PISSED FOR LETTING HIM HANG --

                                            LINCOLN
                        Thanks for the help, asshole --



          Emilio and Jahel hard at work on the engine.  An unspoken 
          choreography from years together.  Father and daughter 
          might not connect in life, but over fuel pumps and exhaust 
          manifolds and oil coolers and sterndrives... they 
          articulate their every thought... wordlessly.                                                                                    43.



        Lena has the locker opened.  Showing Lincoln, Tess and 
          Clark Cole s secret cache of VIDEOS, DVDS.

                                            LENA
                        Emmet... made me promise never to 
                        let anyone know these existed.  If 
                        anything happened to him I was 
                        supposed to destroy them.  There 
                        might be something on them that can 
                        help us.

        Tess is silent.  Lincoln checks the strange CODING SYSTEM.  
          OPENS A JOURNAL WRITTEN ENTIRELY IN THE SAME MADMAN S CODE.  
        The only recognizable word anywhere:  BOI NA.

                                            LINCOLN
                        This is his handwriting.

                                            LENA
                        These are the originals.  He sent me 
                        backups, all encoded.  I unscrambled 
                        a few -- and what I saw was...  You 
                        should see for yourself.

          Tess, uneasy, looks at the tapes.  So many.                                                                                    45.

                                            TESS
                        He hid these.  From me?

        Lena looks away, eyes saying she s sorry.  JUMP CUT TO:

        -- CLOSE ON COLE S FACE.  SOAKED IN SWEAT.  SMOKE ALL 
          AROUND HIM.  EYES ROLLED BACK IN HIS HEAD.  HE S CHANTING 
        IN SOME UNKNOWN LANGUAGE.  WIDEN TO REVEAL HE IS BY A 
          CAMPFIRE, SURROUNDED BY PAINTED KAIAPO TRIBESMEN.  
          OVERTAKEN BY A TRANCE -- COLE BEGINS TO CONVULSE -- THEN 
          LEVITATE OFF THE GROUND -- VIDEO ENDS.  JUMP CUT TO:

        -- COLE WITH LENA S FATHER AS FOUR DRAGONFLIES FLY IN A 
          DANCE AROUND COLE S HAND.  HE POINTS UP... THEY FLOAT UP... 
        HE TWIRLS HIS FINGER IN A  W , THEY DO THE SAME.  AS IF 
            COMMUNICATING, SENTIENT.  WONDERFUL.  JUMP CUT TO:

        -- ON THE RIVER -- A RAGING HIGH TIDE CURRENT -- AND THE 
          ENTIRE LENGTH OF RIVER IS ON FIRE.  A MAN STANDS IN THE 
          MIDDLE OF THE FLAMING WATERS.  JUMP CUT TO:

        -- A MILITARY BASE ON A BRIGHT DAY.  CAMERA FOLLOWS COLE 
          THROUGH A QUAD WHERE... HUNDREDS OF U.S. SOLDIERS LIE DEAD 
        ON THE GROUND.  CRUMPLED WHERE THEY STOOD.  A BAFFLING MASS 
            EXTERMINATION.  COLE IS HORRIFIED.

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE (ON SCREEN)
                        They re all dead.  The whole base.  
                        No gunshot wounds.  No blood -- no 
                        apparent cause of death.  How --

        -- JUMP CUT TO:  THE WRECKED MAGUS.  CAMERA WHIPS AROUND, 
          TRACKING THE SHRIEK OF THE CORPO SECO AS IT HUNTS THEM!  
          EVERYTHING FRAGMENTARY, JUMBLED -- HARD TO FOLLOW --

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE (ON SCREEN)
                        -- Engine s trashed -- it killed 
                        half the crew -- four of us, all 
                        that s left -- that thing, it s 
                        Travers.  I know it s impossible, 
                        he died -- he came back -- as a -- 
                        it s him, he s trying to kill --

        Cole DUCKS.  Falls to the floor.  He holds the WOODEN BOWL.

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE
                        -- The Kraho carve soul traps from 
                        sacred wood -- Landry and I are 
                        going to try to draw it in -- trap 
                        it -- it s our only chance --                                                                                    46.

        TAPE ENDS.  The results of their showdown unknown.

          Jahel catches Lincoln s eye.  As much as he can process 
          anything right now, he sees the clue to their survival.

        ON LENA, hearing her father s name, realizing:  HER FATHER 
        WAS ALIVE AT THE TIME OF THIS RECORDING.  HOPE.

          Clark slows the VIDEO down.  Looking for any indication of 
        FX.  He is floored.  They all are.

                                            CLARK
                        Is any of this faked?  Effects?

                                            SAMMY
                        Video doesn t show any signs of 
                        tampering.  This is raw footage.

                                            CLARK
                        He said he was out here working on 
                        his great discovery...  Real magic.  
                        He was looking for real magic.

                                            TESS
                        You knew about this?  He trusted... 
                        why you?

                                            LENA
                        I m sorry.

          There s a story here.  For another day.  Tess walks out.  
          Lincoln follows after her.  The VIDEOS continue to PLAY:

        DAY.  CLOSE ON COLE.  EXHAUSTED, EYES WILD, MAD, THRILLED --

                                            DOCTOR EMMET COLE (ON SCREEN)
                        We re so close to the Source.  We 
                        have to keep going... we have to.  
                        The River, it makes you make bad 
                        decisions.  But I know... the 
                        further we go up the Boi na... the 
                        more physics breaks down, and 
                        reality... is so much... bigger.

        The Team is stunned -- awed -- terrified -- at what they ve 
          seen.  Only Adjay curls a smile:

                                            ADJAY
                        We just got a second season.



          OVERHEAD CAMERA SHOT OF CLARK.  Feeling like the shit he 
        can sometimes be.  Yeah, he caught all that.                                                                                    49.

        We CATCH the MONITOR covering THE ENGINE ROOM -- where --



          Emilio does a proud little dance with his daughter.

                                            EMILIO
                                (SUBTITLED)
                        We are better at this than anyone 
                        is at anything!



        Tess opens up the throttle -- The Magus yawns awake.  She 
          grins, like greeting an old friend.  CHYRON:  4:46 AM.



        Tess gives it everything it s got -- hoping -- come on...



        The moon has set.  All quiet save the engine.  A time of 
          private prayers.  The Team indoors.  Alert... tired... and 
          irrevocably pissed at each other.  CHYRON:  5:15 AM.



          Emilio prays quietly.  Jahel stares out the window.  Beside 
        her is the wooden bowl that held the dark spirit.                                                                                    50.



          Reese has his RIFLE at the ready.  Resting on his Bible.

          Clark checks the time.

                                            CLARK
                        An hour to sunrise -- two to the 
                        Yutay.  We could make it.

                                            LENA
                              (to Reese; re: rifle)
                        You really think a gun ll help?

                                            REESE
                        A gun always helps.

        Then -- THAT BELLOW AGAIN.  Rustling through the trees.  
        It s coming back.  All eyes dart around.  Highest alert.

        The creature is stronger now -- its renewed strength can be 
          heard in the speed of its movements -- and in its raw power 
        as it HITS THE SIDE OF THE SHIP --

          WHAM!  The Magus quakes.  EVERYONE TAKES COVER.



          WHAM!  The hit reverberates.  Sammy and Adjay feel it.

                                            SAMMY
                        It s on the starboard --
                              (off Adjay s look)
                        The right side.  Dammit --

        He checks the monitors, tries the controls.

                                            SAMMY
                        We lost cameras on that side.  We 
                        don t have any coverage.

          Adjay doesn t hesitate.  He grabs his camera, heading out.

                                            SAMMY
                        Where you going?

                                            ADJAY
                        Getting a shot of it.  Lead 
                        cameraman, there s a reason, pussy.



          WHAM!  AGAIN.  Jahel clutches her father.  He consoles her.  
          Tells her there s nothing to fear.  Not believing it.



          Reese SCOPES out the window looking for something to shoot.

        On the floor, Tess grabs Lincoln s hand.  Still family.

          Lincoln eyes that wooden bowl.  New meaning to it now.



          Sammy watches the MONITORS COVERING THE DECK.  ON SCREEN:

          A GUST OF INDISTINCT MOVEMENT -- EQUIPMENT GOES FLYING.

          Incredible.  On Sammy, deciding...  HE GRABS HIS CAMERA.



          Adjay RUNS DOWN -- frantic -- NO CAMERA.  Tough exterior 
          finally crumbled.  He SLIPS down the stairs, falls.

                                            CLARK
                        What happened --

                                            ADJAY
                        Sammy -- I think -- he s dead.  
                        He s up there -- he s dead.  It s 
                        still out there! --

                                            REESE
                                (looking out)
                        It s coming back --

          WHAM!  The creature STRIKES the boat again.  Harder now.  
          Grown even STRONGER from having tasted more blood.

                                            TESS
                        We have to outrun it.

        Tess moves through the galley to --



        She throws the throttle forward -- full tilt.  THE ENGINE 
          ROARS -- the ship guns ahead.



        They hear a SHRIEK -- or is it THE ENGINE SCREAMING?

          A BLUR OF MOVEMENT out the window -- then --                                                                                    54.

          WHAM!  They are rammed in the stern -- knocking them 
          forward.  They huddle on the floor.

        THE WOODEN BOWL FALLS TO THE GROUND.  Rolls by Lincoln.

                                            REESE
                        It s going for the engine.

          WHAM!  The sound of METAL TEARING.  Pipes and gears 
          CRACKING as... THE ENGINE GROANS -- CHUGS -- DIES.

        It is suddenly painfully QUIET.  The creature destroyed the 
          engine.

        The boat glides forward on its own inertia... then DRIFTS.

        No one knows what to do.  Tess and Lincoln catch eyes.

                                            TESS
                        You think it s really Cam Travers?

                                            LINCOLN
                        I don t know.

          A NOISE outside the ship.  Whatever it is...

                                            JAHEL
                        It is coming for us.  There is no 
                        more running.  We must catch it.

          Lincoln doesn t need translation to understand.  He rises.  
          HOLDING THE BOWL.  Someone has to save them.

                                            LINCOLN
                        It wants blood...

          Lincoln takes Reese s KNIFE.  CUTS ACROSS HIS HAND.

                                            LENA
                        What are you doing?

                                            LINCOLN
                        I m going to trap it.

        He drips HIS OWN BLOOD into the bowl.  STEPS OUT TO THE 
          DECK.

                                            TESS
                        No --

        Tess follows after him.  Reese after her --



          Clark and Adjay edit FOOTAGE of the ghost attacks -- of 
          Sammy s death.  REPLAYING the moment over and over for some 
          details, hints (much like anyone with a DVR will be).

                                            ADJAY
                        The hell is that?

                                            CLARK
                        No idea.
                                (beat)
                        You shouldn t ve let him up there.

        The only time Clark lets on he s effected by losing a man.  
          Adjay shares none of his remorse.

                                            ADJAY
                        He made his choice.

          Clark looks up...  LINCOLN has come to the edit bay.  
          Lincoln sees that CUT across Clark s temple.

                                            LINCOLN
                        That looks like it hurts.

                                            CLARK
                        Yep.                                                                                    58.

                                            LINCOLN
                        Good.
                                (beat, sincere thanks)
                        You tried to save my mom from that 
                        thing.  You protected her.

                                            CLARK
                        She s the star of my show.  Need 
                        her alive.

          Lincoln sees the SCREEN ON in front of Clark:  A MOUNTED 
          CAMERA shot of the BOW, ZOOMED IN ON TESS.  Hand across 
          BANDAGES on her stomach.  Hurt but alive.  As if Clark was 
          keeping an eye on her.  Clark s largely a shit... but 
          there s a nub of something there.  Maybe decency.  Or maybe 
        he just loves her.

          Lincoln lets it slide.  Nods his thanks.  He goes.

          A beat.  Adjay sees some activity on THE CLUSTER OF SCREENS 
          COVERING REESE S ROOM.  Shows Clark:

                                            ADJAY
                        Check this --

        PUSH IN ON THE SCREENS, AS WE -- INTERCUT:



          REESE IS DISMANTLING ALL THE MOUNTED CAMERAS/MICS IN HIS 
          ROOM.  JUMP CUT THROUGH, as he unscrews, yanks or just 
          BASHES them in.  ONE BY ONE THEY GO OUT.



                                            CLARK
                        Fucker.

          Adjay checks.  ONE CAMERA IN REESE S ROOM IS STILL WORKING.  
        From the floor, looking up.  Adjay taps the SCREEN.

                                            ADJAY
                        He didn t see it.

        ON SCREEN:  The camera catches Reese as... he opens a CASE.  
          A SAT PHONE.  He DIALS.  WE HEAR A MURMUR on the other end.

                                            REESE (ON SCREEN)
                        He saw a hell of a lot more than we 
                        thought.  We re still in pursuit...  
                        Negative.  Cole may be alive.  If 
                        he is... and if he found it -- I ll 
                        put him down.                                                                                    59.

        ON ADJAY AND CLARK.  Hearing that.  Adjay REPLAYS that last 
          ominous piece over and over again.  Trying to comprehend.
