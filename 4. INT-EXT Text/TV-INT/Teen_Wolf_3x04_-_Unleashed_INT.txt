      THE SHARP TIP of a NEEDLE catches the glare of the overhead 
      light. With a steady hand, Dr. Deaton lowers a SYRINGE to a 
      small TERRIER held still on the table by Scott. 

      The dog s owner, a young man named KYLE, watches with 
      noticeable anxiety.

                                  KYLE
                    It s not going to hurt him, is it?

                                  DEATON
                    Just a little. But, to be honest, I 
                    usually find it s the owners...

      Deaton quickly jabs the needle in. The dog barely blinks 
      while Kyle draws a terrified breath.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    ...who feel the most pain.

      Kyle lets out an embarrassed laugh. Scott picks the dog up 
      off the table, helping him back to the floor.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    All right, we ll let you know if we 
                    find any parasites in the sample. 
                    But my guess is he probably just 
                    ate something he shouldn t have.

      Gently petting the dog as Kyle leashes him, Scott notices the 
      name tag: BULLET.

                                  SCOTT
                    Cool name.

                                  KYLE
                    He s got two brothers at home named 
                    Beretta and Trigger. Military 
                    family.

      Bullet rolls to his back for Scott, exposing his stomach in a 
      submissive pose.    TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/132.

                    Guess he knows who the Alpha is.

      Scott gives a nervous laugh. He doesn t see Deaton also react 
      to Kyle s coincidental choice of words, but with a look more 
      thoughtful than amused. A look of concern.

      Realizing he s still holding the syringe, Deaton turns and 
      drops it into a bin marked HAZARDOUS.


      Scott pulls the lid off a container marked BULLET and 
      prepares the sample to dilute it. But then he pauses.

                                  SCOTT
                    Hey Doc, I think I found something.

      Deaton steps in to look over his shoulder.

                                  DEATON
                    Rinse it off.

      As Scott works, Deaton grabs a tweezer. He uses it to pick up 
      a SMALL, WHITE BERRY from the sample.

                                  SCOTT
                    What is it?

                                  DEATON
                      Definitely poisonous. For the dog, 
                    and actually, you as well.    TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/133.

                    No. Mistletoe.


      A BARKING snaps Scott s head up from his work. It s distant, 
      but alarmingly frantic. Yanking his gloves off, he moves for 
      the double doors, pulling them open and--


      Heels click across the tile floor, the sound echoing 
      throughout the otherwise empty corridor. Nervously clutching 
      the strap of her bag, Jennifer Blake glances behind her.

      After a moment, she starts off again, picking up her pace. 
      Turning the corner with another anxious glance, she moves 
      faster and faster, on the verge of breaking into a run when--


      Blake rushes inside her classroom and slams the door shut. 
      She rests her head against the pane of glass, catching her 
      breath. Then turns around and SCREAMS.    TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/135.

      Derek stands right in front of her. Blake grabs a pointer and 
      SWINGS it at his head. He casually ducks out of the way.

                                  MS. BLAKE
                      Physically or emotionally? 
                    Although, I guess that presupposes 
                    I was emotionally okay before any 
                    of this and according to my 
                    therapist that s been debatable for 
                    a long time.

      Derek steps toward her, causing her to flinch back. But when 
      he reaches for the pointer, she allows him to take it.

                                  DEREK
                    I think you re going to be okay.

                    Maybe you should start by telling 
                    them it s an allegory for 
                      McCarthyism.

                                  MS. BLAKE
                    Is that a subtle way of suggesting 
                      I shouldn t say anything? Because I 
                    won t.

      Amid the rush of boys changing into sweats and shorts, Scott 
      and Stiles whisper at their lockers.

      Hair in a pony tail, sweat dripping from her brow, Cora uses

      She tumbles through the air, but lands on her feet underneath 
      the PIPE on which Cora was doing pull ups. Ripping it free, 
      Kali swings it around.

      Derek can t dodge it fast enough. Kali CRACKS the pipe 
      against the back of his head, sending him to the floor. When 
      he tries to rise, Kali whips the pipe up and PLUNGES it right 
      through his mid-section, IMPALING him.

      Derek CRIES OUT in agony, causing Cora to struggle uselessly 
      against the more powerful Ennis.

      With a sadistic, sexually charged smile, Kali grips the pipe 
      over Derek who kneels pinned down on all fours.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1315.

      Snapping awake, Allison looks up to the white hot glare of 
      her mother, Victoria Argent. But in the blink of an eye, 
      she s gone, replaced by a concerned Morrell.

      While Allison packs up her things, Morrell takes the seat in 
      front of her.

                    You re starting to concern me, 
                    Allison. Maybe we should chat in 
                    the guidance office sometime.

      Allison waits for the last of the students to clear out 
      before responding.

                                    ALLISON
                    Maybe you could tell me what you 
                    were doing at the bank the other

      Chalk strikes across the board with swift strokes, revealing

                    Isaac?

      He barely seems to be listening, however. Eyes focused 
      forward while Harris continues.

                    It s the product of mass and 
                    velocity. The more massive 
                    something is, the faster it s 
                    going.

                    Mr. Harris, I have to use the 
                    bathroom.

      Harris dismisses him with a wave. Worried, Scott watches 
      Isaac hurry for the door.

                                  SCOTT

      Barely having gone a few steps from the classroom, Isaac 
      stops. Down the otherwise empty corridor stand Ethan and 
      Aiden. Waiting for him. Waiting for a fight.

      Fully willing to accommodate, Isaac starts forward. Until 
      something odd happens--

      Aiden reels back and PUNCHES Ethan in the face. The twin 
      staggers forward, trying to stay on his feet. While a stunned 
      Isaac watches, Aiden hits his brother again. And again. 

      Grabbing him by the shirt, Aiden SMASHES Ethan against the 
      lockers, bouncing him from one side of the corridor to the 
      other until, finally, he hurls his brother to the floor, 
      sending him rolling to a stop--

      Right at Isaac s feet.

      Classroom doors burst open at the commotion. Harris pushes 
      past students still pouring into the corridor.

                                  HARRIS
                    What is this? What s going on?

      Right behind him, Scott sees Ethan on the floor, bloodied and 
      cowering in front of Isaac. Danny pushes past to help him up.

                    Isaac? What the hell did you do?

      Finding Scott in the crowd, Ethan s bloodied lips part to 
      give him a small, cruel smile while Isaac simply stares back 
      at Harris, utterly helpless.

      FADE IN:


      Derek kneels on all fours, trying not to move while Kali 
      stands over him gripping the pipe impaled through his chest.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Sorry about this, Derek. I asked 
                    Kali to be gentle, but...

                    This is me being gentle.

      Derek looks to Cora in Ennis s arms.

                    Let her go.

                    Sure.

      Deucalion gestures to Ennis who releases Cora. She scrambles 
      back, ready to fight. But Derek s glare stops her.

                    See? We re not unreasonable. But, 
                    Ennis, if she attacks you again? 
                    Feel free to remove her arms. One 
                    at a time.

      Ennis smiles. He likes this idea.

                                  DEREK
                    What do you want? You want to kill 
                    me?

                                  DEUCALION
                    Kill you? No. You really think I m 
                    that boring? Don t throw me in with 
                      sociopaths like your uncle. I m a 
                    man with far more vision than 
                    simple murder.

      Moving with care, Deucalion lowers to face him. He removes 
      his glasses and turns his cataract eyes to Derek s.

                    Not just me.

      Scott follows his look. Down the hall Lydia leans against her 
      locker, flirting with Aiden. Scott s HEARING adjusts, picking 
      up on their conversation.

                    What about tonight?

      Stiles waits outside the administrative offices, glancing 
      about. Nervous, he s unable to stand still. Finally, the door 
      opens and he scrambles back. Kyle s girlfriend, Ashley, walks 
      out, escorted by a Deputy.

                    teenagers bound to become a 
                      liability? And believe me, they 
                    will become a liability. In fact, I 
                    have a feeling one of them is 
                    getting himself into trouble right 
                    now...


      In front of the chalkboard on which is written LUNCHTIME 
      DETENTION, Mr. Harris eyes a group of students which includes 
      Isaac and Allison. He points to the first of his detainees.

                                  HARRIS
                    The two of you will wash all of the 
                    boards on this wing.

                          (to Allison and Isaac)
                      Restocking the janitor s closet.

      Isaac approaches him, trying not to be heard by Allison.

                                  ISAAC
                    Do I have to be with her?

                                  HARRIS
                    Well, now that I know you d prefer 
                    not to? Yes, you have to be with 
                    her.

      Isaac turns back to Allison who offers up a weak smile.


      A GIRL lays a single flower in front of Kyle s locker, now a 
      memorial to the teen. Stiles steps forward, eyeing the 
      various items gathered on the floor...

      Photos of Kyle with Ashley, a perfect looking couple. A 
      picture of Kyle on a skateboard. One in a Raiders jersey. 
      Another with his dog, Bullet.

                    Yeah, I would have told you. But 
                    we re not actually friends.

                    He was a good guy.

                                  STILES
                    Were you two friends?

                                  BOYD
                    I only had one friend. And she s 
                    dead too.

      He moves off, blending back into the rush of students. Stiles 
      returns his eyes to Kyle s locker, still searching for even 
      the smallest of clues.


      Down in the murky darkness of the school s basement, Allison 
      wheels in a cart of boxes while Isaac carries several of his 
      own. They head into the janitor s closet in silence and get 
      to work restocking the shelves. Backs to each other, Isaac 
      bumps Allison with an elbow.

                                  ISAAC
                    Sorry.

                    Do you have to?

                    Um... I guess not, no.

      They continue restocking in silence. Until she turns again.

                    I m going to ask you anyway. Did 
                    you tell anyone I was at the school 
                    the other night?

                                  ISAAC
                    Was I supposed to tell someone?

                                    ALLISON
                    I d be really happy if you didn t.

                                  ISAAC
                    You being really happy isn t much 
                    of a priority for me. Since you 
                    kind of stabbed me. Like twenty 
                    times. With knives.

                                    ALLISON
                    They were actually Chinese Ring 
                    Daggers, but yeah... sorry.

                                  ISAAC
                    Was that an apology?

                                    ALLISON
                    Would you accept an apology?

      Before he can answer, the door CLICKS shut behind them. They 
      share a nervous look. Isaac grabs the knob and gives it a 
      turn. When he pushes forward, though, the door won t move.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Maybe it locks from the outside?

                                  ISAAC
                    I think something s blocking it.

      Keeping the knob turned, he pushes again. Then turns his 
      shoulder to it, giving a harder shove. But the door won t 
      budge. He steps back, breath tightening noticeably.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1326.

                    Okay, maybe we should--

      Isaac SLAMS his shoulder against the door. Then again, harder 
      and harder, anger and desperation taking hold.

                    Isaac--

      With a SHOUT of frustration, he POUNDS a fist against the 
      door. Frightened, Allison watches his hands lower, noticing 
      his CLAWS are extended.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Okay, Isaac, just relax.

      Chest rising and falling with each heavy breath, he seems to 
      be trying to maintain control. But then he turns to the door 
      again, slamming his fists against it--


      Frantic, Isaac pounds his hands against the lid of the locked 
      freezer--


      Claws DIGGING into the door, Isaac clenches his fanged teeth 
      in panicked rage, eyes squeezing shut as--


      His BLOODY FINGERS dig at the inside of the freezer--


      Allison retreats as far as she can, back hitting the shelves. 
      At the sound, Isaac snaps his YELLOW EYES toward her.

                                    ALLISON
                    Isaac... Isaac, don t--

      Fangs bared, he lunges at her, grabbing her arm. She moves to 
      defend herself, but his CLAWS DRAW BLOOD and--THE DOOR behind 
      them RIPS off its hinges and CLATTERS to the floor.

      Scott stands at the threshold near a SODA MACHINE pushed 
      aside.

      Isaac barely has a moment to turn when Scott yanks him out 
      and SLAMS him down to the floor. Hand wrapped around his 
      throat, Scott s own eyes surge with a YELLOW BRILLIANCE.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1327.

      fading from his own eyes, the boy scrambles back across the 
      tile, seeming to return to his senses. Scott helps Allison 
      out and notices the blood on her arm.

                    I know. It s all right.

      Isaac rises to his feet, both he and Allison shaken. They

      expression darkening.

      FADE IN:


      BLACK BLOOD begins to join the RED dripping from Derek s 
      torso, a sight not lost on Cora.

                                  DEUCALION
                    See, the reason I m always invested 
                    in new talent is simple. We all 
                    know a pack is strongest due to its 
                      individual parts.

      He holds the cane broken down to thirds between his hands.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    The stronger the individual parts, 
                    the greater the whole.

      With a flick of his wrist, the cane whips out, extending to 
      its full length.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    When I lost my sight, one of my 
                    Betas assumed I wasn t fit for my 
                    role anymore. He thought he could 
                    take it from me. He was wrong.

      Deucalion pulls the top third of the cane loose.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    Killing him taught me something I 
                    didn t know an Alpha could do. His 
                    power was added to mine. I became 
                    stronger, faster, more powerful 
                    than I d ever been. I tested this 
                    new ability to subsume the power of 
                    your own by killing another one. In 
                    fact, I killed them all.

      He breaks down the middle of the cane, reducing it to thirds.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    I took the individual parts and 
                    became a greater individual whole.

      A flick of his wrist. The cane snaps back to its full length. 
      Placing it on the bench, he rises to approach Derek again. 
      Kneeling, he gently touches the young Alpha s face, fingers 
      drawing over every feature.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1329.

                    his mother.

      Deucalion rises, turning back to pick up his cane.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    You ll get to know me, Derek. Like 
                    she did.

                    I know you. I know what you are.

      Deucalion pauses at the challenge in Derek s voice.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    You re a fanatic.

      The word falls on Deucalion like a sour note.

                                  DEUCALION
                    Know me? You ve never seen anything 
                    like me. I am the Alpha of Alphas.

      Cane gripped in both hands, his eyes begin to glow behind the 
      dark lenses. His VOICE rises to a DEMONIC RASP, volume almost 
      seeming to shake the walls.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    I am the apex of apex predators.

      Eyes flaring RED, his face contorts momentarily, cheeks 
      pushing out, fangs extending.

                    I am death, destroyer of worlds.

      His face shifts and reverts, sudden and terrifying.

                    I AM THE DEMON-WOLF.

      THE RIGHT LENS of his dark glasses cracks under the 
      phenomenal power of his voice. And suddenly, he s perfectly 
      calm again. Gently pulling the glasses from his eyes, his 
      thumb feels over the crack in the lens.

                                  DEUCALION (CONT D)
                    Hate it when that happens.

      He drops the glasses in his pocket and holds out his arm for 
      Kali. She takes it, leading him out with Ennis following.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1330.

      to the floor with an agonized breath. As she kneels to him, 
      they both gaze back to the loft s STEEL DOOR which quietly 
      slides shut.


      Trying to whisper but rarely succeeding, Stiles follows Lydia 
      down the corridor.

                    day a dead baby. Every day. Hey

                    Because Scott s dealing with the 
                    twins.

      Lydia stops, turning to him with a look of alarm.

                    Yeah. Yeah, I know about them.

      She starts walking again, noticeably disturbed.

                                  STILES
                    So I was thinking what if the 
                    murders come in threes? Ancient 
                    societies love things in threes. So 
                    first it s virgins and then it s--I 
                    don t know--three people who own 
                    little dogs.

                    I own a little dog.
                          (off his look)
                    I m not getting rid of my dog.

                                  STILES
                    Would you think about getting rid 
                    of your dog?

                                  LYDIA
                    No. And by the way, you can t 
                    discern a pattern from a single 
                    data point. So stop trying.

                                  STILES
                    I m supposed to just wait around 
                    for someone else to die? Just sit 
                    there waiting for them to die? 
                    Watch them wither and die right in 
                    front of you?

                                  LYDIA
                    Wither?

                                  STILES
                    You know what I mean. Die in a 
                    hideously awful strangulating, head 
                    bashed in, throat cutting way.

                                  LYDIA
                    Maybe it s not your job. You said 
                    it yourself. They were strangled 
                    with a garotte. That s a human 
                    thing to do. So maybe you should 
                    leave the figuring it out part to 
                    someone human.

                                  STILES
                    You mean someone like my dad.

                                  LYDIA
                    No. I mean your dad. The Sheriff.

      THE BELL RINGS and Lydia hurries into her next class. The 
      hall clears out, leaving Stiles alone, still thinking.


      Hurrying in behind the other students, Scott raises his cell 
      phone to see the picture of Isaac on the bike. Ms. Blake 
      follows, the last to enter.

                                  MS. BLAKE
                    Okay everyone, I know this is the 
                    last class of the day. To be honest 
                    I want to get out of here too 
                    and... and I think I forgot my 
                    point. Just--you know--take your 
                    seats.

      Scott grabs a desk next to Ethan. He gives him and his 
      brother, Aiden, a polite nod as he reaches into his backpack 
      to take out a book. He reaches in again for his note pad. 
      Then pulls out a LARGE STEEL FRONT SPROCKET. He sets it down 
      with a CLUNK. 

      Ethan sits up, alarmed. Scott pulls out another GLEAMING 
      METALLIC PIECE, torn wires attached to it.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1333.

                                  SCOTT
                    This looks kind of important.

      He pulls out another MECHANICAL PART.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    No idea what this is.

      From his own desk, Aiden looks up, enhanced hearing catching 
      the unmistakable sound of a MOTORCYCLE ENGINE.

                                  ETHAN
                    Aiden, wait--dont!

      But he s already on his feet and gunning for the door as a 
      surprised Ms. Blake turns from the board.


      ENGINE ROARING, Isaac tears down the corridor on the 
      motorcycle. He soars past the locker room, heading right for 
      Aiden who comes hurtling down the stairs. Isaac hits the 
      brakes, SKIDDING towards him. 

      Aiden grabs the handlebars, stopping the bike short. The 
      tires SCREECH and SPIN, kicking up SMOKE.

                                  AIDEN
                    Get off my bike.

                                  ISAAC
                    No problem.

      Feet jumping up onto the seat, Isaac flips off the bike and 
      right over Aiden s head. He lands just as the hall fills with 
      teachers and students.

      Blake pushes through the crowd in time to see Aiden turning 
      off the bike, engine sputtering to silence.

                                  MS. BLAKE
                    You ve got to be kidding me. You 
                    know this is going to result in a 
                      suspension?

      From Aiden s fuming look it s clear he did not know this. But 
      a few other satisfied witnesses look as though it s exactly 
      what they were hoping for...

      Deaton leans over a file making notes when the front door 
      CHIMES and Stiles enters. 

                                  DEATON
                    You re out of school early.

                                  STILES
                    Free period, actually. I was headed 
                    to see my dad. You probably heard 
                    people are kind of getting murdered 
                    again. It s his job to figure it 
                    out.

                                  DEATON
                      I gathered as much from the Sheriff 
                    title, but I didn t want to make 
                    any assumptions.

                                  STILES
                    Yeah. But it gets kind of hard for 
                    him to do his job if he doesn t 
                    have all the information. And we 
                    all know he s missing pretty much 
                    half the story, right? So then I 
                      remembered someone who does have a 
                    lot of information. Someone who

                                        ACT FIVE

      FADE IN:


      A BLACK PEN sketches out the branches of a leafless tree on 
      the blue-lined page of a notebook. Danny leans over Lydia s 
      shoulder to watch her drawing.

                                  DANNY
                    You re really good at that.

                                  LYDIA
                    I know, right?

                                  DANNY
                    Maybe you should be in Art Class.

                                  LYDIA
                    Maybe.

                                  DANNY
                    Since you re not in Music.

      Danny holds up his trumpet. Confused, Lydia glances among the 
      students, each with musical instrument cases, sheet stands in 
      front of their chairs.

                                    STUDENT (O.S.)
                    Fifteen minutes!

                                  LYDIA
                    What? What s that?

                                  DANNY
                    Fifteen minute rule. The teacher 
                    didn t show up.

      While the rest of the class bolts for the door, Lydia slowly 
      closes her notebook. While Danny follows the last student 
      out, Lydia lingers behind.

      Alone in the empty classroom, she looks over the instruments, 
      the music stands. She spots a TABLET sitting on a table near 
      the piano, still running a program.

      Slowly approaching, she takes a look at the application to 
      find it s been recording for over an hour. Stopping it, she 
      pulls the SLIDER back to listen to a previous moment...

                                  MUSIC TEACHER (V.O.)
                    Recording piano, part three...  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1336.

      THE AUDIO WAVES on the application move up and down as the 
      Music Teacher plays. Lydia scrolls forward. More piano 
      playing. She frowns, growing uninterested and reaches to 
      press STOP when--

      THE PIANO NOTES HIT VIOLENTLY. Lydia snaps her hand back from 
      the tablet. The audio drops down. Silence...

      All she can hear now is the sound of her own breathing. She 
      leans closer. Then gently moves the VOLUME SLIDER up.

      Amid the STATIC she begins to hear something strange. VOICES. 
      Like chanting. Musical but plaintive, a chant of desperation. 
      Hundreds of voices becoming louder, rising in pitch, crying 
      out in fear until the chant becomes--

      SCREAMING.


      Stiles follows Deaton into the Examining Room.

                    All these symbols and things--the 
                      triskeles, the bank logo, the 
                    mountain ash--all of it s stuff 
                    from the Celtic Druids. And anyone 
                    who s looked up human sacrifice 
                    knows the Druids had a pretty big 
                    hard on for giving one up to the 
                    Gods. You know who the Lindow Man 
                    is? Two thousand year-old body 
                    found in England? He was strangled, 
                    head bashed in and throat cut. 
                      Three-fold death. They also found 
                    pollen grains in his stomach. Guess 
                    what favorite Druid plant that was?

                                  DEATON
                      Mistletoe.

      Deaton turns and holds up a small BRANCH of the plant. WHITE 
      BERRIES stuck amid dark green leaves, he sets it down on the 
      examining table for Stiles.

                                  STILES
                    I m just telling you everything you 
                    already know.

                    Maybe because when you spend every 
                    moment of the last ten years trying 
                    to push something away, denying it, 
                    lying about it--it becomes a pretty 
                    powerful habit.

                                  STILES
                    So is the person doing this a 
                    Druid?

                                  DEATON
                    No. It s someone copying a 
                    centuries old practice by a people 
                    who should have known better. Do 
                    you know what the word Druid means 
                    in Gaelic? Wise Oak. The Celtic 
                    Druids were close to nature. They 
                    believed they kept it in balance. 
                    They were philosophers and 
                    scholars. They weren t serial 
                    killers.

                                  STILES
                    Yeah, well this one is.

      A BUZZING interrupts them. Stiles pulls out his phone to see 
      Lydia s name on the display.

                    Hey, I can t talk right now.

      He falls silent, listening intently.

                    Are you sure he s missing?


      Phone pressed to her ear, Lydia s eyes remain locked on the 
      piano, its cover now closed over the keys.

                                  DEATON
                    Lydia? Something wrong?

                                  LYDIA
                    No, I was--I mean--I just thought 
                    of someone else with a military 
                      connection.

                                  STILES

                    Who?

                                  LYDIA
                    Well, you should know especially.

                                  STILES
                    Me?

                                  LYDIA
                    It s been there on his desk the 
                    whole time.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1340.

                                  STILES
                    Lydia, what? What s been there?

                                  LYDIA
                    I can t believe you ve never seen 
                    it--

                                  STILES
                    LYDIA, WHAT IS IT?

                                  LYDIA
                    The West Point honor code. It's 
                    sitting right on his desk.


      On the teacher s desk stands a small bronze PLAQUE emblazoned 
      with the words:  A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or 
      tolerate those who do. 

      Just past it, alone in the empty room and slashing through 
      tests with a RED MARKER, Mr. Harris glances up as if having 
      heard something.

      VOICES drift toward him. The low and rhythmic sound of voices 
      crying out.

                                                                          FADE OUT:


                                  END OF ACT FIVE  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1341.


                                        ACT SIX

      FADE IN:


      Turning the corner in the empty hallway, Isaac follows Scott.

                                  ISAAC
                    I wish I could ve seen their faces. 
                    Did they look seriously pissed?

      Scott stops short.

                                  SCOTT
                    Yeah. Kind of like that.

      At the other end of the corridor stand Ethan and Aiden. They 
      make a slow, deliberate approach. Ethan casually begins to 
      pull off his shirt.

      Scott throws a worried glance to Isaac. Then looks back to 
      see Aiden STAB HIS HAND into Ethan s back. The two bodies 
      begin to merge, growing in size, bones crunching together, 
      flesh expanding. 

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Holy...

                                  ISAAC
                    Yeah. It s bad.

      Rising to its full height, the Twin Alpha starts forward. 
      Isaac steadies himself, ready to fight.

                                  ISAAC (CONT D)
                    We can take him.

                                  SCOTT
                    Are you kidding?

      Grabbing him, Scott turns him around to run. But neither 
      moves fast enough. The Twin Alpha lands its powerful hands on 
      both of them, lifting each one right off his feet and 
      SWINGING them together.

      Isaac and Scott SLAM INTO EACH OTHER like crashing cymbals. 
      Then SLAM into each other again. The Twin Alpha whirls about 
      and HURLS them down the corridor. 

      They tumble, sliding to a stop on the floor right near THE 
      TIP OF CANE.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1342.

      CONTINUED:4242

      The Twin Alpha pauses, breath held in fear. 

      Scott pushes himself up to watch the silhouette of the Twin 
      Alpha break back into two bodies while THE MAN WITH THE CANE 
      calmly approaches.

      Pulling the RUBBER TIP from the end to reveal a sharp BLADE, 
      Deucalion raises the cane. Then, in one swift stroke, he 
      whips the blade across both Ethan and Aiden s cheeks.

      They take the cut with only the slightest gasp of pain. 
      Deucalion slips the rubber tip back on the cane and turns to 
      leave. 

      Eyes filled with rage, the twins give a last look at Scott 
      and Isaac. Then follow in silence.

                                  ISAAC
                    Who the hell was that?

                                  SCOTT
                      Deucalion.


      Deaton glances up from the West Point plaque on Harris s desk 
      to Stiles and Lydia in the otherwise empty room.

                                  DEATON
                    All right, this is just one of many 
                      possibilities. He could ve simply 
                    left for the day.

      Stiles picks up Harris s briefcase from behind his desk.

                                  STILES
                    Not without this.

      Setting it back, his eyes wander to the uncapped RED MARKER 
      atop the tests Harris was grading. One is marked F. One an A. 
      The next a D. But Stiles picks up another paper with a 
      curious look.

                                  DEATON
                    What?

                                  STILES
                    This test is graded R.

      Lydia grabs another from the desk.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1343.

                                  LYDIA
                    This one is H.

      Deaton steps between them. He picks up the tests, moving 
      several around to form a word. One with an ominous impact on 
      his expression.

                                  DEATON
                    Stiles, remember I told you Druid 
                    is the Gaelic word for Wise Oak?

                                  STILES
                    Yeah.

                                  DEATON
                    When a Druid went down the wrong 
                    path, the Wise Oak was sometimes 
                    said to have become a Dark Oak. 
                    There s a Gaelic word for that as 
                    well...

      He looks down at the word spelled by the tests.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    Darach.


      Rain runs down the windows of the loft. Derek concentrates on 
        re-attaching the pipe used to impale him, barely looking at 
      Isaac as the boy questions him.

                                  ISAAC
                    I don t get it.

                                  DEREK
                    What don t you get?

                                  ISAAC
                    I mean what happened?

                                  DEREK
                    Nothing happened. It s just not 
                    going to work with you both here. 
                    I ve got Cora now. It s too much. I 
                    need you out tonight.

                                  ISAAC
                    Where am I supposed to go?

                                  DEREK
                    Somewhere else.  TEEN WOLF EP#304"UNLEASHED"GOLDENROD1/30/1344.

      CONTINUED:4444

                                  ISAAC
                    Did I do something wrong?

      Behind one of the broken brick walls, Cora listens to Derek 
      becoming more and more frustrated.

                                  DEREK
                    You re doing something wrong now by 
                    not leaving.

                                  ISAAC
                    Derek--

                                  DEREK
                    Get out. GO!

      He grabs a GLASS off the work table and HURLS it. The glass 
      SMASHES against the wall right by Isaac s head. Stunned, he 
      cowers down, hand instinctively moving to his cheek where 
      glass shards may have struck.

      Derek turns away. Finally, Isaac picks up his bag and leaves.


      At his desk, Scott stares blankly at a textbook. His eyes 
      drift to the window and the rain slipping down the glass. A 
      KNOCK at the door snaps his attention up.

                                  SCOTT
                    Come in, Mom.

      The door opens but it s not Melissa. It s Isaac, bag slung 
      over his shoulder and dripping wet.

                                  ISAAC
                    Hey. Was wondering if I could ask 
                    you a favor.
