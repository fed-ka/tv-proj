      Adam and Fiona sit amidst the remains of an heroic curry. 
      Surrounded by takeaway boxes and empty bottles of Kingfisher.  
      The house around them is still unpainted, partly unfurnished. 

      In front of them there is a mass of paper work that they re 
      dividing into a pile each.  All that shit that happens when 
      you move.

                                  ADAM
                    Is setting up the water direct 
                    debit a blue or pink task?

      Fiona looks at him.

      A pause.

                                  RUTH
                    That s great, congratulations.

                                  HARRY
                    Of course I m not the only one, 
                    there s a short list, but they want 
                    me to go for an interview.

                                  RUTH
                    A board ...

                                  HARRY

                      Precisely.  When they invite you, 
                                                                                              *
                    they make it very hard to say no 
                    ...

                                  RUTH
                    But why would you want to say no, 
                    Harry? 

      Harry considers but he s not going to tell her yet.

                    Look at it from my perspective: we 
                    find you next to an old Soviet arms 
                    dump that is full of new kit, in 
                    fact so new that my technical guys 
                    think Christmas has come early, but 
                                                                                              *
                    still you claim that you re just 
                                                                                              *
                    the water carrier.

      Morgan shrugs.

                                  MORGAN
                    I ve told you what I know.

                                  DANNY
                    We know how much you guys get paid 
                    if a job like this works out, just 
                                                                                              *
                    tell us the sums and we ll match 
                    that.


      Morgan shakes his head.

                                  DANNY
                    We ll make sure you re not

                      compensated to your full amount.

      He produces a deal memo out of his pocket.

                                  MORGAN
                    What s that?

                                  DANNY
                    A deal for you to sign.
                                                                                              *

      Morgan almost laughs.

                                  DANNY
                    You don t believe me?  Well as you 
                    know this is all being taped and if 
                    you still have doubts, we ll get in

                    that lawyer you asked for, a 
                    witness, anyone you like.

      Morgan shakes his head uninterested.
                                                                                              *

                                  DANNY
                    Okay. Your call. I know that you ve 
                                                                                              *

                    stuff, we all know how that works, 
                    you re going to have to give us 
                      something.  This is the best way of 
                    doing it.

      Still nothing.

                    earn it back again, working for 
                    some of your old mates, all your 
                                                                                              *
                    old friends.

      Only Morgan s not really listening.  He moves suddenly, not 
      going for Adam but for the bottle of water.


      Adam tries to grab it back but then shrugs and lets him 
      finish it.  Morgan sucks the water down and then carefully 
      places it back on the chair.

      Then goes back to standing where he was.

                                  ADAM
                    In about 15 minutes you re going to 
                    seriously regret that.

                                  MORGAN
                          (to himself)
                    Shit.

                                  ADAM
                    Yes, there ll be lots of that, 
                    that s just one of the unpleasant 
                    things that ll happen.

      Adam has been replaced with Danny.  He has another and 
      different bottle in his hand.  Cap off, hand out offering it 
      to Morgan.

      Real urgency to him now.  What looks like real sympathy.

                                  DANNY
                    Take this now, drink it and that 
                    last bottle won t affect you.  
                    There s an antidote in here. It ll 
                                                                                              *

      He holds the water tantalisingly close Morgan.  A pause.

                                  DANNY
                    And I m not lying to you.
                                                                                              *

      Morgan looks up at him.  It s clear from his face that he can 
      already feel shit happening.

                                  DANNY
                    It s up to you.  Hey, look I ll 
                    throw the money in as well.

                                  MORGAN
                    And if you re bullshitting me?

                    It s easy, don t tell me anything 
                    until you re better.  What more can 
                    I say?

      He stares up blankly.  Shakes his head.  He s not going for 
      it.

                                  DANNY
                    What is it with you?  Why do you 
                    make your life so impossible? 

      He shrugs and takes back the bottle and puts the top on.

                                  DANNY
                    You have about five minutes before 
                    it s too late.  And when it is too

      Danny and Adam watch Morgan on the monitor.

      ANGLE ON THE SCREEN: Morgan is suddenly violently ill on the 
      floor.

      Danny flinches as he watches this.
                                                                                              *

      Adam doesn t take his eyes off the screen.  Forcing himself 
      to go through this.

                    He must have some very good reason 
                    and it doesn t seem to be money.

      Adam moves to leave.

      gear, everything being taken out.

                    do to you?  Is that it? 
                                                                                              *

      He s right in his face here and you know that Morgan, sick 
      though he is, is like a coiled snake and is severely tempted 
      to have a go at Adam and fuck the consequences.
                                                                                              *

      And he suddenly lashes out aiming for Adam s throat but 
      Adam s quicker than him, catches his hand, holds it slowly 
      and begins to twist it.

      And Adam knows that finally he had got to him. He now knows 
      what he s frightened of.

                    That s it?  All that martial arts, 
                    unarmed combat, Jap slapping or

                    you can manage? 

      Morgan is a formidable opponent even in his state.  Both 
      their arms locked together.

                                                                                              *43A43A

      But we can see this stuff is where Morgan is vulnerable.

                                  JULIET
                    Good and bad. Capitalism at work - 
                                                                                              *

      She s putting away the cash into her wallet. 

                                  FIONA
                    And what do you think about that?

                                  JULIET
                    A big mortgage to pay tends to 
                    sharpen the senses a little.


      Fiona nods.  

      Then Juliet s phone goes.  She looks at the number on the 
                                                                                              *

                                  JULIET
                    Sorry, I really need to take this.  
                    Can I use your hall?

      Fiona nods. 

                                  FIONA
                    Sure...

      We stay with Fiona who casually extracts her own phone. Dials 
      two digits and is able to patch into Juliet s conversation.  
      She is quickly able to hear both Juliet and who she s talking 
      to. 

                                  SIMON (O.S.)
                    How about this afternoon? Around 3?

                                  JULIET (O.S.)
                    Should be fine.  Tom s at the rugby 
                    and Mattie s playing with a friend. 
                    We ll have a couple of hours.  

                                  SIMON (O.S.)
                    Where are you?

                                  JULIET (O.S.)
                    Trying to sort out this nightmare 
                    with the car, but I m only five 
                    minutes away.  Dying to see you.

      This conversation has affair written all over it.

      Fiona hangs up and Juliet comes back in.

                    She went to this address where she 
                    was met by a rather handsome 
                    stranger.  Simon Carr.  One hour 
                    and forty minutes later she came 
                    out of the house and dutifully went 
                    to collect her two children before 
                    going home to her husband.

                    Blackmail may not be healthy for a 
                    long term relationship with a 
                    source but it can be ... highly 
                    effective in the short term.
