Liz reacts to Cris' confession with disbelief.
LIZ
What are you saying, you're some
sort of prophet?
CRIS
It's not religious. I just happen
to see my life before it happens.
LIZ
Cris, it's sweet that you feel
responsible for people. But I think
you need help.
She looks down.
LiZ
And I'm...I'm not the one to help
you, right now. I've got too much
going on in my own life.
Cris can't let her go. He takes a quarter from his pocket and
hands it to Liz.
CRIS
Flip it.
LIZ
Why?
61.
CRIS
Just do it.
She takes the quarter and flips it. Cris calls it in the air.
CRIS
Heads.
She looks. It's heads.
CRIS
Flip it again.
(calls it in the air)
Tails.
Tails it is, but so what. She flips again.
CRIS
Tails.
(she looks;flips again)
Heads.
(she looks, flips again)
Tails.
She looks. Amazed. Disturbed.
CRIS
Now you believe me?
She stares at him like he's the devil.
LIZ
Yeah. And I don't want to have
anything to do with you.
She walks away.
CRIS
Liz.
(follows)
Don't you see? I can get us all the
money we need.
She turns abruptly.
LIZ
Don't follow me. Don't talk to me.
Get out of my life!
She walks on, leaving Cris bereft.
SNAPBACK TO:
62.
WALKING IN THE PARK - fiVE MINUTES AGO
Cris
What do you want me to do? Wait for
people to die?
LIZ
Cris...I think you should move on.
Today.
Cris squints, then chooses his words carefully.
CRIS
Why? Because I care so much about
kids that sometimes I overreact?
His words hit the bull's-eye. Liz's whole demeanor softens.
Although still troubled, she takes his arm, and they walk on.
ANOTHER ANGLE - BINOCULAR MASK
ferris (o.s.)
Who's the woman?
Ext. Hillside overlooking park - DAY
Ferris, Cavanaugh, and Policeman Rick are each looking
through a pair of binoculars.
POLICEMAN rick
Liz Cooper. Nice girl, but very
erratic.
cAVANAUGH
Think she'll cooperate?
POLICEMAN RICK
Hard to say. She's impossible to
control.
Ferris
Sounds like you've tried.
POLICEMAN RICK
She's quite a challenge.
Liz and Cris, still walking, holding hands.
LIZ
I swear, I can't figure you out.
63.
CRIS
Believe me, the feeling is mutual.
LIZ
Sometimes you seem mindlessly
impulsive. But other times I feel
like you're utterly calculating,
saying exactly what you think'll
push my buttons.
CRIS
What do you mean?
LIZ
Don't you think it's kind of an
amazing coincidence that neither of
us can have kids?
CRIS
You want to talk to my doctor? I'll
get him on the phone. No, really, I
mean it. I'll have him send you my
records. Because I want you to
trust me.
He seems so sincere that she dismisses her concerns.
LIZ
Then open up. Talk to me. Where are
you going with your life?
Cris seems unprepared for the question.
crIS
Wherever it takes me.
LiZ
You never think about the future?
CRIS
All the time. - But mainly how to
stay out of trouble.
LIZ
No goals? Dreams? Ambitions?
CRIS
There's only one thing I've ever
wanted.
LIZ
What's that?
64.
CRIS
A family.
She seems disappointed.
LIZ
That's all? Just a family?
CRIS
Well, I was, as they say, left on a
doorstep when I was two.
(makes light of it)
Never found foster parents who
could put up with me. - So to me, a
family sounds like plenty.
That certainly pressed her buttons again.
LIZ
You've got to be making this up.
CRIS
I wish.
She rests her head on his shoulder.
LIZ
You poor guy.
Ext. Hillside overlooking park - DAY
Still watching Cris and Liz as the couple get into her car.
CAVANAUGH
I say we get the whole department
up here and bust his ass.
Ferris
And by that time, his ass'll be
long gone.
CAVANAUGH
Then why won't he see through your
trap?
Ferris takes a deep breath.
Ferris
Let's try this one more time.
65.
ext. old SHOPPING CENTER - daY
Grocery, drug store, hardware, gas station. Liz and Cris get
out of her Jeep. He heads for the grocery store.
LIZ
I'll meet you inside. I need to
pick something up at the drug
store.
They split up.
Ext. Across the street - unmarked car - DAY
Ferris, Cavanaugh, and Policeman Rick watch the couple go
their separate ways. Ferris gets out.
FERRIS
Stay in the car. If he sees your
shadow, he won't take the bait.
CaVANAUGH
We hear you.
Ferris
I'm serious. This guy can smell
your farts before you even eat the
beans.
rick
Miss, I won't even think about
beans.
Ferris gets out of the car. Cavanaugh and Rick stay put.
Rick
Sounds like a crock to me.
CAVANAUGH
You haven't been chasing him for
three years.
Cris waits impatiently by her Jeep. Liz finally approaches,
carrying a couple of heavy bags filled with wine and booze.
crIS
What took so long?
LIZ
I ran into a friend I hadn't seen
in a while.
67.
Liz holds out a single key on a ring.
LIZ
She said we could use her cabin up
at the peak.
ACROSS THE STREET
Ferris rejoins Cavanaugh and Ferris in Rick's car.
caVANAUGH
Did you tell her about the future
thing?
Ferris
Of course not. I wanted her to
believe me. - But I loaded her up
with liquor, to dim his headlights.
Ext. Mountain road - DAY
Liz's Jeep grinds up a steep, winding road, past a sign that
says "State Line."
She turns onto a dirt driveway that leads to a cabin and a
glorious panorama.
CRIS
God, this is gorgeous.
Inspired, he kisses her, but she's distant.
CRIS
What's wrong?
She smiles wanly, then gives him a peck.
LIZ
Nothing.
She hops out of the truck.
Ext. STAKEOUT SITE across the CANYON - DAY
Cavanaugh and Rick look through binoculars. Ferris peers
through a telescope on a tripod. Baines approaches with a
half dozen tech and construction guys.
68.
baines
Okay, when you press the remote,
the cabin will lock down like a big
jail cell.
FERRIS
But silently, right?
BAINES
Unnoticeably.
CAVANAUGH
And that's when we go in.
Ferris rolls her eyes with exasperation.
Ferris
You still don't get it.
(tries to be patient)
This has to be clear to your whole
army.
(to Baines)
And yours. -- After she comes out
and we lock down the cabin...We
don't do anything. We wait.
Policeman RICK
But if he's already trapped...?
FERRIS
Gentlemen, try to think like him. -
If the plan is to go in right after
he's trapped, he'll see it coming
and he'll slip away before he's
trapped...
(to Cavanaugh)
Like he's always done.
cavANAUGH
How does your plan change anything?
baines
At least he won't hear it when the
trap closes.
FERRIS
And if he doesn't know he's
trapped, he can't foresee knowing
he's trapped.
CAVANAUGH
That kinda makes sense.
69.
FERRIS
The eureka moment is when he
realizes he's been trapped.
CAVANAUGH
When is that?
ferriS
That's the point. We want to delay
"eureka" for as long as possible.
So by the time he sees trouble and
decides to waltz away...
baines
(finally gets it)
He's already been in the trap for
hours.
FERRIS
Voila.
Cavanaugh and Rick nod with a kind of awe.
RICK
You're smart.
Baines looks at her with new respect.
State Troopers are camped out in two's and three's. Fifty of
them. Plus Baines' SIX MP's, wearing different uniforms.
Slowly making his way through the steep redwood-covered
slopes, Cris hears a NOISE. Looks up. Sees a STATE POLICE SUV
CRASHING down the cliff across the Gorge.
SNAPBACK TO:
MAXWELL GORGE - NOW
Cris, catching his breath against a redwood, opens his eyes
and looks back toward his approaching pursuers. He looks
around the gorge, searching for the cliff where he FORESAW
the SUV come crashing down. He recognizes the rock formations
across the gorge. He heads in that direction. PAN UP and we
see that the cliff is directly under the...
StakEOUT SITE
Baines steps closer to the edge and looks down.
BAINES
He's heading this way.
Ferris, suddenly confident, shouts into the radio.
feRRIS
Cavanaugh! We've got a fox hunt
going in Maxwell Gorge, right
beneath the stakeout. Throw
everybody into it! We need to
overload him!
Liz looks around for some way to help. She spots the State
Police SUV that we saw crashing down the hillside. She
sidles toward it.
MAXWELL GORGE
Thirty Troopers and Six MP's are converging on Cris.
FerrIS (o.c.)
Gentlemen, if he surrenders, fine,
cuff him. But if he even shivers,
shoot to kill.
StakEOUT SITE
Liz opens the door of the SUV, shifts into neutral, and
starts pushing. - It's too heavy to budge.
85.
MAXWELL GORGE
Cris moves toward a field of LARGE BOULDERS.
StakEOUT SITE
Slowly, with great effort, Liz gets the SUV to inch forward.
MAXWELL GORGE
Troopers and MP's are closing in on Cris.
CaVANAUGH
(megaphone)
Lie down on your stomach, hands
behind your head! You've got ten
seconds. Ten seconds and we shoot.
Cris climbs in among the large boulders, glances up, and
waits for the future to happen.
StakEOUT SITE
Liz gets the SUV onto a slight downslope, and it picks up
speed.
Baines and Ferris see the SUV rumbling straight toward them.
They dive out of the way as the SUV plunges over the ledge.
MAXWELL GORGE
Troopers and MP's are advancing toward Cris, about to open
fire.
CAVANAUGH
This is your last warning.
Thirty Troopers and MP's have their fingers on the trigger
when the SUV sails over the ledge and plummets straight down
towards them. Cris crouches down among the boulders just as
the SUV crashes on top of him, then tumbles toward his
hunters, who scatter.
Cris makes a run for it just as the SUV explodes in a
fireball.
STAKEOUT SITE
Ferris and Baines watch the events below.
fERRIS
Keep after him! Quick! Stay on him!
86.
While they are distracted, Liz climbs into the front seat of
RICK'S POLICE CRUISER, cranks it up, slams into reverse,
spins, and takes off down the road.
baines
What the...?
LIZ
fishtails down the twisting mountain road.
MAXWELL GORGE
Cris practically mud-skis down the slope.
Troopers and MP's hurtle after him.
At the bottom, Cris is carried by momentum onto the CREEKSIDE
ROAD...
Into the path of A POLICE CAR that comes careening around a
curve!
Liz at the wheel. She swerves and slams on the brakes,
skidding and screeching to a halt.
Troopers and MP's slalom onto the road from the incline and
rush after Cris.
Cris makes it to the car. Driver's side.
CRIS
Believe me now?
He climbs in and guns it.
LIZ
I'm getting used to miracles.
Three MP's grab onto the car's mirrors and door handles. Cris
weaves violently until they lose their grip and fly off.
In Rick's Police Cruiser - dawn
Liz and Cris grin at each other.
CRIS
Where were you going?
LIZ
No idea. I was just trying to be
unpredictable.
87.
STAKEOUT SITE - dawn
Ferris urgently unrolls a road map and studies it.
In Rick's Police Cruiser - dawn
Cris speeds down the treacherous curves.
LIZ
So what's the plan? Bonnie and
Clyde?
CrIS
Remember that place in the South
Pacific?
LIZ
It's starting to sound really good.
He pulls out his cell phone.
CRIS
I'll check on our ride.
Police vehicles converge on the area, systematically blocking
the intersections that Ferris indicated.
Rick's Police Cruiser
Cris threads his way through town, zigging and zagging down
streets and alleys.
FROM THE HELICOPTER
Ferris sees Cris maneuvering perfectly through the maze,
avoiding imminent traps and confrontation.
BAINES
(discouraged)
He doesn't miss a beat.
FERRIS
(pleased, to herself)
Come to momma.
Cris dodges another trap.
91.
FERRIS
(to radio)
Stay after him. Keep the pressure
on.
The bypassed police cars chase after Rick's stolen Cruiser,
which leaves town on a street that merges with a WINDY NARROW
CANYONSIDE ROAD.
BAINES
(incredulous)
He's driving right into it...
Up ahead, beyond a blind curve, the road leads to a ONE-LANE
BRIDGE over a DEEP CHASM with RAGING RAPIDS at the bottom.
BAINES
Sometimes looking one step ahead
isn't enough.
On the FAR SIDE OF THE BRIDGE, out of sight, beyond a curve,
EIGHT STATE POLICE CARS form a barricade across the road.
The grenade explosion attracts many of the guards. Cris and
Ferris slip out the front door where the Guards were
previously stationed.
He addresses a Soldier in a patrol car.
CRIS
Give me your keys.
The Soldier obeys. Cris shoves Ferris into the car and gets
in after her.
CRIS
(to soldier)
If I see you, I'll kill her.
They drive off.
IntERROGATION ROOM
Wisdom, agonized, is about to pull the trigger. Liz,
trembling, sees that he's going to do it.
WISDOM
I'm sorry.
Ext. Car - DAY
Driving away. Ferris realizes that Cris' escape is going to
be successful. She checks her watch. It's 6:13.
FERRIS
You know what our problem is?
CRIS
"We got off on the wrong foot."
He has taken the words right out of her mouth.
127.
FERRIS
It's really...
CRIS
"all been a big misunderstanding."
FERRIS
Exactly.
CRIS
"We've never meant you any harm."
FERRIS
It sounds so insincere when you say
it.
CRIS
I guess you're a better liar than I
am.
FERRIS
You know what I'm going to say
next?
Cris nods.
CRIS
It'll never happen.
She offers her card.
FERRIS
My door will be open. We can start
from scratch.
He takes it. The phone number stands out: 888-CFerris. Flips
the card out the window.
FERRIS
The magic word is cooperate. That's
all we've ever wanted to hear from
you.
A helicopter lands on the road ahead, blocking the way.
CRIS
When are they going to give up?
After you're dead?
Cris holds his gun threateningly to Ferris' head. Two MP's
get out of the helicopter, carrying something heavy.
128.
Cris reacts to what he can't see yet.
They are carrying a body. They remove the hood from its head.
It's Liz. Dead.
Quaking with rage, Cris prepares to shoot Ferris.
