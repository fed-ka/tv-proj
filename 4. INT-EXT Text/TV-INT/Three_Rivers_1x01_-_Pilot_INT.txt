      KIM MULLINS (22), stands before the altar holding the hand of 
      her groom, SAM HARVEY (22, wearing a yarmulke).

                    We re here today to join together 
                    Kim Mullins and Sam Harvey.  Kim s 
                    been a member of this church all 
                    her life but Sam s new to us.  He 
                    met our Kim just across the inland 
                    waterway at College of Charleston.  
                    And yes, folks, Sam s a Yankee.
                          (smiling, to Sam)
                    We won t hold it against you, son.  
                    Nobody can blame you for falling in 
                    love with Kimmy.

                                  SAM
                    Thank you, sir.

      Guests CHUCKLE, some shoot knowing looks to Kim's mother, 
      NANCY MULLINS (50's), who forces a smile from the front pew.

      The stands are packed with screaming college students and 
      rabid fans as Pitt takes on arch-rival Duquesne.  The game is 
      fast, the crowd is electric as Duquesne player (TYLER) takes 
      a shot, which is blocked by Pitt player, ALVIN WEATHERS (20, 
        African-American, confident and cocky).  Weathers steals the 
      ball, turns and hits a three-pointer from almost half-court.  
      The crowd goes nuts and Alvin Weathers is loving every minute 
      of it.

      IN THE STANDS, RUSS COBLE (30 s) sits down next to an NBA 
      SCOUT.

                    Exploring a few possibilities on

                    Six feet even, but with his jump

                    the court all to himself.

                    I know that s all behind him.

      The Scout shoots Russ a skeptical look.

                                  RUSS COBLE (CONT D)
                    Okay, look, the kid grew up in 
                    foster care, drugs all around him.  
                    But I told him if he wanted to go 
                    pro, he had to clean up his act.  
                    That was six months ago.  Since 
                    then, no drugs, respects his 
                    curfew, in the gym eight, nine 
                    hours a day.  He wants this.  He 
                    needs this.  He s ready.

      Impressed by Russ  belief in Alvin, the Scout looks back to

      THE COURT 

      where Weathers has the ball, Tyler guards him aggressively.  
      Alvin smiles, dribbles behind his back in a little flourish 
      that sends up a CHEER from the stands.

                                  TYLER
                    Hey, Showboat.  Stop playing to the 
                    crowd.  You ain t the only one 
                    they re looking at.

                    I m the only one they re gonna see.

      Weathers fakes in one direction, dribbles past Tyler, makes a 
      jump shot, sending the CROWD TO ITS FEET.  Alvin struts down 
      the court as the CROWD CHEERS --

      Andy and Pam head toward O.R. #2, intersecting with a medical 
      team transferring a patient, MARK WILSON (50 s, weak, pale).  
      At his side is MIRANDA FOSTER (mid-30 s, surgical fellow).

                    He can t wait anymore.  Let s get 
                    him on the ECMO and hope we get an 
                    offer soon.

                                    MIRANDA
                    I say we rip the lungs out of the 
                    factory owner who exposed Mr. 
                    Wilson to the radon.

                                  ANDY
                          (beat, then -)
                    You really do need a nap.

      Miranda smiles, exits into the O.R.  Off Andy,


      Kim slips a gold wedding band on Sam's finger.

                                  PASTOR MILLER
                    I now pronounce you man and wife.  
                    You may kiss the bride.

      As Sam lifts Kim's veil, the MAN in the back reveals he s 
      carrying a HANDGUN.  The bride and groom kiss, the MAN lifts 
      the handgun and SHOOTS.  Chaos in the church.  People 
      SCREAMING.  More shots POP, POP, POP.  Two men tackle the 
      gunman and wrestle the gun away.  Blood runs down Kim s neck 
      onto her white dress.  Nancy SCREAMS and runs to her 
      daughter.


      Weathers' steals the ball, races down court.  Tyler tries to 
      cut him off, but Weathers goes past him for a slam-dunk and 
      makes it.  He hangs onto the rim in triumph, then drops to 
      the floor in front of Tyler, laughing for a beat, then 
      suddenly collapses.  Confusion turns into panic as players 
      and coaches run onto the court and swarm around Weathers.

      3-WAY SPLIT SCREEN  

      THREE RIVERS O.R.: Miranda has finished opening Wilson s 
      chest.  Andy comes out of the scrub room wearing his goggles, 
      a surgical mask and cap and holding up his clean hands.  Pam 
      deftly gloves him, Bud hands him an instrument, a nurse turns 
      on the stereo and Andy begins the operation. 

      SPORTS ARENA: Weathers unconscious on the court, team doctors 
      whirling around him;  Get the ambulance.

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Andy makes his way through the crowded room, looking for 
      someone he doesn t see.

                                  EDDY (O.S.)
                    Andy.  Hey, Yablonski --

      Andy finds EDDY BANKS (40, working class, bruised face, blood 
      seeping through the T-shirt wrapped around his arm).

                                  EDDY (CONT D)
                    I told  em I knew you.  Thought 
                    they might get to me sooner.

                                  ANDY
                            (examining him)
                    What happened to your arm?

                                  EDDY
                    You know.  Bar.  Some jerk wanted 
                    to fight.

                                  ANDY
                    That jerk being you?

      Eddy laughs.  Suddenly the E.R. doors BANG open and Alvin 
      Weathers (still in his basketball gear) is wheeled in on a 
      gurney, writhing in pain, with an endotracheal tube down his 
      throat.  Andy spots the number on Alvin s jersey, recognizes 
      it.  An E.R. DOC checks Alvin s vitals, shouts to the EMT s --

                                  E.R. DOC
                    Take him into three and page the 
                    cardiac team --

                                  ANDY
                          (to Eddy)
                    I gotta go, Eddy.

                                  EDDY
                          (pointed)
                    You should come by the bar.  Carl 
                    got out last week.

      Andy meets Eddy s eyes.  There s a story here.  One Andy 
      would rather forget.  

                                  ANDY
                    I ll see what I can do.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THREE RIVERS "Pilot" Revised Network Draft 2-2-09  11.

      CONTINUED:


      Andy runs to Alvin s gurney.  The E.R. Doc is surprised to 
      see Andy, treats him like visiting royalty.

                                  E.R. DOC
                    Dr. Yablonski?  You kidding me?

                                  ANDY 
                          (to a NURSE)
                    Get me an echo and an EKG.

      Andy follows the team into the exam room. 


      Alvin is fighting the tube and the nurse attempting to hook 
      him up to an I.V.  Andy checks Alvin s pupils as the medical 
      team sets up the EKG.

                                  EMT
                          (to Andy)
                    Collapsed during a game.  He plays 
                    for Pitt.

                                  ANDY
                    Alvin Weathers.

                                  EMT
                    He arrested in the ambulance, had 
                    to shock him.

      Andy leans down, face to face with Alvin.

                                  ANDY
                          (to Alvin)
                    Alvin?  Alvin, can you hear me?

      Alvin s eyes are filled with fear as he continues to fight 
      the breathing tube.

                                  ANDY (CONT D)
                    We re going to take care of you, 
                    okay?  You re going to be all 
                    right.  That tube s going to help 
                    you breathe, I want you to stay as 
                    calm as possible.  All right?  
                    You re gonna be okay.

      Alvin nods, trying to do as Andy tells him.

                                  ANDY (CONT D)
                          (to the EMT)

                    the test results.
                          (to Alvin)
                    Be right back, Alvin.

      Andy exits the exam room.


      Andy yells into the crowded, chaotic room --

                                  ANDY
                    Who s here for Alvin Weathers?
                          (louder)
                    Anybody here for Alvin Weathers?!

      Russ pushes his way around several people to reach Andy.

                                  RUSS COBLE
                    I am!  I m Russ Coble.  His 
                    attorney.

                                  ANDY
                    Dr. Yablonski.  I m a cardio-
                    thoracic surgeon.  

                                  RUSS COBLE
                            (panicked)
                    He needs surgery?  What s wrong 
                    with him?

                                  ANDY
                    We re waiting for tests, right now 
                    we need a medical history, do you 
                    know how to contact his family?

                                  RUSS COBLE
                    He doesn t have any.  Well, he 
                    mentioned some people in Indiana, 
                    but I don t think he talks to them.

      A nurse approaches Andy.

                                  NURSE
                    Dr. Ruiz is here from Cardiology 
                    and we re ready with the echo.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THREE RIVERS "Pilot" Revised Network Draft 2-2-09  13.

                                  ANDY
                          (to Russ)
                    Sit tight.

      Andy moves to go.

                                  RUSS COBLE
                    Will he still be able to play ball?

                                  ANDY
                    One thing at a time.

      Andy heads back to the E.R.


      As Andy hurries in, a nurse hands him an EKG graph paper.  
      DR. SERGIO RUIZ (50, Cardiologist, conservative and 
        competitive) is standing at the echocardiogram machine.  

                                  RUIZ
                    Heard you were down here.

                                  ANDY
                          (reading the graph)
                    EKG shows left axis deviation.  
                    How s the echo?

      He joins Dr. Ruiz at the ultrasound screen, to see THREE 
      DIFFERENT VIEWS OF ALVIN S HEART BEATING IN 3-D.  ONE VALVE 
      IS VERY DAMAGED, THE VENTRICLE IS DILATED AND BARELY MOVING.

                                  RUIZ
                    Looks like he has severe 
                      ventricular dilatation.

                                  ANDY
                    Possible hypertrophic 
                      cardiomyopathy.

                                  RUIZ
                    The walls are thickened but I 
                    wouldn t go that far.

                                  ANDY
                    I would, but let s start with 
                    improving his blood flow.  I think 
                    we should put him on a VAD.

                                  RUIZ
                    Agreed.

                    Move him upstairs --

      ALARMS go off as Alvin begins to seize.

      Nurses quickly prepare for surgery as Andy continues CPR,


      The walls are clean but faded.  The equipment is old.  Kim 
      Mullins lies in a hospital bed at the end of the hallway with 
      Sam and Nancy on either side of her.  We HEAR two women with 
      Southern drawls, speaking in hushed tones --

                                  LUCY (O.S.)
                    Who shot her?

                                  WOMAN (O.S.)
                    Some nut.  Just lost his wife, mad 
                    at God, decided to shoot up a 
                    church.

      LUCY WALLACE (30 s, wearing scrubs and a lab-coat) walks into 
      frame and heads into Kim s room. 


      Lucy enters to see Sam, holding Kim s hand and Nancy seated 
      on the other side of the bed, stroking Kim s hair.  Connected 
      to a ventilator and IV lines, Kim looks as if she s sleeping.    

                                  LUCY
                    I m Lucy Wallace.  I m a family 
                    care specialist.  I am very sorry

                    Yes.  And this is Kim s mother, 
                    Nancy Mullins.

                                  NANCY
                    They say she s dead.  But look at 
                    her.  She s still breathing.  She s 
                    still warm.

                                  LUCY
                    The IV s and ventilator are keeping 
                    Kim s body stable for the moment, 
                    to give you time to make some end

                                  NANCY
                    No.  She s still here.  People wake 
                    up out of comas all the time.

                                  LUCY
                    I m afraid this isn t a coma.  The 
                    scan shows that Kim s brain 
                    function has ceased and once that s

                    In a few hours, her heart could

                    No.  We don t believe in any of

                                  SAM
                    Kim had her own beliefs --

                    You re not carving up my baby.  
                    This is the family s decision.

                                  LUCY
                    Yes, ma am, but as her husband, 
                    Sam s the next of kin.  Legally, 
                    the decision is his.

      Off Nancy s look to Sam,


      State of the art medical technology.  Computer terminals at 
      each bedside; X-rays projected on flat screens.  There is a 
      constant BEEPING of ALARMS, the loudest at the moment, 
      belonging to Mark Wilson, who is now hooked up to the ECMO 
      and numerous IV s.  Miranda adjusts Wilson s medication, 
      stopping the alarm as Wilson s wife looks on.  

      A medical team wheels Alvin Weathers (now attached by wires 
      to a small mechanical box) into ICU; setting him up in an 
      empty unit.  Andy sweeps in behind them, surgical mask 
      hanging around his neck.

                                    MIRANDA
                    Andy.

      He joins her at Wilson s bedside.

                    How s the basketball player?

                                  ANDY
                    Stable but the heart looked 
                    enlarged when I put him on the VAD.

                                    MIRANDA 
                    I have Mr. Wilson s post-ops, if 
                    you ve got a minute.

                    How are you doing, Mrs. Wilson?

                          (re: her husband)
                    If he s okay, I m okay.

      Andy gives her a comforting smile and moves away with 
      Miranda, through the busy unit.  They see DAVID LEONE (30, 
      surgical resident, model good-looks) across the room flirting 
      with a very CUTE NURSE.

                                  ANDY 
                    Too bad Wilson doesn t need a 
                    heart.  David seems to be building 
                    up quite a collection.

                                    MIRANDA
                    But he always breaks them, so it 
                    wouldn t help.

      Andy smiles as Miranda stops at a FLATSCREEN, types in 
      Wilson s name.  X-RAYS are projected onto the board.  Andy 
      and Miranda keep their poker faces, knowing the patients and 
      their families are always watching them.

                                    MIRANDA (CONT D)
                    So far, no infection or clotting, 
                    but he s awfully weak.

                                  ANDY
                          (looking at the x-ray)
                    Increase his Heparin.  I m worried 
                    about what s building up around the 
                    valves of the ECMO.

                                    MIRANDA
                    How long do you think he has? 

                                  ANDY
                    Few days.  If we re lucky.

      Off Miranda s concern,

      Jordan keeps moving into ICU, Ryan quickly follows.


      Jordan and Ryan enter on the move.

                    you how excited I am to be working

                    Sure.

      They walk away.  Andy follows.

                    Why s Khalid riding her so hard?

                                  JORDAN
                    Because the building has her name

                                  JORDAN
                    Maybe that s why he wants to see 
                    her.

      Andy reacts to that as Dr. Jordan moves to David and Ryan.

                    Correct, Dr. Yorn has requested 
                    that you never return to his O.R.

                                    MIRANDA
                    I had a nineteen year old cystic 
                    fibrosis patient with a rare blood

                      I appreciate the dedication to your 
                    patients but when you are on a

                    I went through a difficult time

                          (looking him in the eye)
                    I m here to prove myself as a

                    getting that chance because of who

                    Actually, I see a great deal more 
                    of your mother in you.

      Miranda is surprised by that.  Uncomfortable letting his 
      guard down, Khalid quickly gets back to business.

                    wanted.  She was my baby for twenty 
                    years before you came along and you 
                    will not tell me about my own

      Andy exits.


      Committee meets around a conference table, including Khalid, 
      Jordan, Ruiz and HELEN ROSS (50 s, African-American, social 
      worker).  Standing in back observing, are several surgical 
      fellows, including Miranda.  Andy s at the smart board, which 
      shows Alvin Weathers  3-D ECHO.

                                  ANDY
                    Alvin Weathers.  Twenty-year-old 
                    male, collapsed during a basketball 
                    game.  Severe ventricular 
                      hypertrophy and restricted blood 
                    flow due to aortic stenosis.  He s 
                    now on a VAD and has stabilized.  

                                  KHALID
                    Options?

                                  RUIZ
                    We could start with medication, see 
                    if he heals on the VAD.

                                  ANDY
                    He s not responding quickly enough 
                    to the meds.
                          (pointing to the echo)
                    I think we should replace the 
                    aortic valve, which would improve 
                    his ventricular outflow.  The 
                    concern I have is that he may have 
                      underlying cardiomyopathy --

                                  RUIZ
                      I disagree.  It s entirely possible 
                    his heart will heal if we give it a 
                    chance.  We should start with meds 
                    then move to aortic surgery only if 
                      necessary.

                                  KHALID

                    Helen, you took the med-sosh?

                                  HELEN
                    Yes.  He has no family --



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THREE RIVERS "Pilot" Revised Network Draft 2-2-09  26.

                                  ANDY 
                    He has people in Illinois or 
                    Indiana or somewhere --

                                  HELEN
                    His mother s from Indiana, but she 
                    was estranged from her family and 
                    died when he was ten years old.

                                  KHALID
                    Heart problem?

                                  HELEN
                    Mixed with drugs and alcohol.  
                    Alvin ended up in foster care and 
                    was never adopted.  Not 
                      surprisingly, he also has a history 
                    of drug use.  

                                  ANDY
                    He s been clean for six months --

                                  HELEN
                    Yes, but those influences are never 
                    far away and my fear is that faced 
                    with prolonged medical problems and 
                    no family support, he ll revert 
                    back to his old ways.

                                  ANDY
                    So, let s move aggressively, fix 
                    the valve and a couple months from 
                    now, he s good as new.

      Khalid considers, then --

                                  KHALID
                    I agree.  Recommend aortic valve 
                    surgery.

                                  ANDY
                    Thank you.

                    He s getting too sick to

                    He is getting weaker, but the only 
                    way to reverse his slide is to

                    There are no contra-indications --  
                    no infections, no clots.  I can 
                    still transplant him, we just need 
                    a pair of lungs.

                    to take the lungs, we ll take them.  
                    Just save him.

      Off Miranda,


      Ryan s at the soda machine, mixing ice tea with lemonade in a

      Ryan runs into his office as a FAX is arriving.  He grabs it, 
      reads the headline:

      MEDICAL REPORT: DONOR LUNGS / PAWLEY S ISLAND - URGENT

      Ryan exits quickly with the report.


      Andy enters to find Russ and Alvin watching ESPN.  Andy 
      enters.

                                  ANDY 
                          (to Alvin)
                    Okay, let s talk about your heart.  
                    You have a genetic defect -- one of 
                    your valves is too small to let 
                    blood flow through properly.  
                    That s why you collapsed.  We could 
                    continue treating you with 
                      medications, keep you on the VAD 
                    and see if you improve but I m not 
                      optimistic about that.  This is 
                      life-threatening.  I think we need 
                    to replace the valve.

                                  ALVIN WEATHERS

                    If everything goes well, yes.  
                    You ll need six or eight weeks of 
                    recovery but then you can start to 
                    train again.

                    Today.

      As that hits Alvin, Ryan hurries up, waving the report. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THREE RIVERS "Pilot" Revised Network Draft 2-2-09  30.

      Ryan hands the report to Andy, who looks at it, then heads 
      across the unit to where Miranda is attending to Wilson, 
      shows her the report.  Sue Wilson enters carrying a cup of 
      coffee, sees Miranda and Andy at her husband s bedside.

                                      ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Andy and Miranda arrive at the busy nurses  station, where 
      David, Ryan and INDER (20 s, resident) gather supplies.  

                                  ANDY
                          (to Ryan)

                    Got the jet, the pilot, David s 
                    weird sandwich --

                                  RYAN
                    For the drinks?

                                    MIRANDA
                    For the lungs.

                                  RYAN
                    Be right back.

      Ryan runs down the hall.  Miranda finds a roll of masking 
      tape, rips off a piece, writes the name MARK WILSON on it, 
      and slaps it on her chest.  Andy sees, but doesn t comment.

                                    MIRANDA
                    The lungs are perfect.  Same with 
                    the heart, liver and kidneys but 
                    we re not getting any of those.

                                  ANDY 
                    Which means you re going to be 
                    tripping over a bunch of other 
                    teams in a crowded O.R.

                                    MIRANDA
                    Don t worry, I ll play nice.
                          (smiles)
                    If they do.

      Miranda, David and Inder head out. Ryan runs by, carrying a 
      red IGLOO COOLER, trying to catch up.  Pam joins Andy.

                                  PAM

      Andy ignores her and moves off.  Pam dials the house phone.

                    for Dr. Yablonski...  Another O.R.


      The procurement team boards the private jet.  David and Inder 
      take seats and settle in - having done this numerous times.  
      Ryan looks around, impressed.

                                  RYAN
                    Hard to believe people fly like 
                    this.  I mean, regular people, not

                    Sit down, Jethro.

      Ryan takes a seat as Miranda enters the cabin with the PILOT.

                    We can t have any delays on the way 
                    back.  The lungs are only viable 
                    for five hours and it s a three and 
                    a half hour flight.

                                  PILOT
                    Shouldn t be a problem.  I m 
                    watching a storm system in the 
                    Gulf, but if we stick to the 
                    schedule, we won t get anywhere 
                    near it.

                    Oh, my goodness, we forgot to bring 
                    a bimbo for David.

      Inder slides the CD into the sound system, cranks it up, 
      BLASTING Three Doors Down s  IT S NOT MY TIME,  as the 
      ENGINES ROAR and the plane starts to taxi.  THE MUSIC 
      CONTINUES OVER --


      Andy is there, overseeing Alvin s transfer to the O.R.  As 
      Alvin is wheeled out, he looks back to Russ, who gives him a 
      hopeful thumbs-up.


      CLOSE-UP ON LIVE IMAGE OF VALVE SURGERY

      Andy s skilled, gloved hands suture the new valve.  PULL BACK 
      to reveal Pam, Bud and the operative team, working in concert 
      with Andy, anticipating his needs; a beautiful machine.

                                  ANDY
                    New valve looks perfect.  Let s 
                    take him off the VAD.

      As Andy and Pam begin to disconnect the heart pump, Alvin s 
      heart begins to slow down.

                                  ANDY (CONT D)
                          (suddenly worried)
                    Pam, check this --

      She looks up to the FLATSCREEN showing Alvin s heart, beating 
      slowly and erratically.

                    It s not contracting well --

                    We can t take him off the pump, he 
                    won t get enough blood flow.  Leave 
                    him on the VAD and take him back to

                    Slush.  Start with three bags.

      David heads to the scrub room.  A dozen people buzz around 
      the small O.R. as Miranda sees Ryan frozen in place.

                                    MIRANDA
                    Why are you just standing there, 
                    get the damn slush!

                                  RYAN
                    I don t know what that is.

      Miranda (and everyone, for that matter) stops to face Ryan.

                                    MIRANDA
                    Where did you get your medical 
                    training?

                                  RYAN
                    I don t have medical training.  I 
                    was hired to assist the person who 
                    had medical training --

      The others in the room smirk and try to look away.

                                    MIRANDA
                    What kind of training do you have?

                                  RYAN
                    I was a stringer for a newspaper in 
                    Columbus and I did the farm report 
                    on a local radio station --

                                    MIRANDA
                    You re a D.J.?

                                  RYAN
                    No, I did the news --

                                  DR. YORN
                    Why don t the two of you settle 
                    this outside while those of us who 
                    have medical training do our work.

      Miranda gets in Yorn s face.

                                    MIRANDA
                    Stay out of this, Yorn, this isn t 
                    your hospital --

                                  DR. YORN
                          (to his team)
                    Can someone call security.  This 
                    woman is unstable --

      David comes into the room, sees Miranda squaring off with 
      Yorn and runs to get between them.

                                  DAVID
                          (to Dr. Yorn)
                    Do not make me kick your ass --

      In the midst of the yelling and posturing, Lucy enters.

                    the judge, we re on hold.

                                    MIRANDA
                    No!  Talk to the mother, make her

      David gently pulls her back and she allows it.  She looks at 
      the clock on the wall: 7:00 p.m.


      Andy stands in front of a FLATSCREEN, looking at Alvin s new 
      3-D echo with Sergio and Jordan.

      A RESIDENT interrupts.

                                  RESIDENT
                          (to Andy)
                    Excuse me, Dr. Yablonski, we re 
                    unable to keep Mr. Wilson s 
                    systolic pressure up.  Could you 
                    take a look?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THREE RIVERS "Pilot" Revised Network Draft 2-2-09  38.

      Andy walks with the resident to Wilson s bedside, checks his 
      vitals stats on the monitor.  Pam hangs up the house phone.

      Andy hears that, then tells the resident --

                    Keep the dopamine, start him on

                    the slightest change in his 
                      condition.

      The resident nods and goes to work.  Andy watches the numbers 
      on the monitor.

      CLOSE-UP ON A CLOCK: 8:15 p.m.  

      Move down to find David, frustrated, his surgical mask untied 
      and hanging around his neck, heading to the coke machine.  
      Nancy Mullins waits for coffee from another machine.  As 
      David slams quarters into the slot, Nancy eyes him -- his 
      surgical scrubs, paper booties covering his shoes.  Finally, 
      he says --

                                  DAVID
                    Hello.

                                  NANCY
                    Are you one of the vultures who 
                    came to pick my daughter apart?

      David takes that hit, and realizing who he s talking to, 
      decides not to defend himself.  Taking his Coke, he starts 
      back down the hall, but then pauses.

                                  DAVID
                    For the record, your daughter was 
                    gone before we were called.  And 
                    you are making a terrible mistake.  
                    Not for us.  For yourself.

                                  NANCY
                    How do you figure that?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THREE RIVERS "Pilot" Revised Network Draft 2-2-09  39.

                                  DAVID
                    No one ever regrets saying yes.  
                    But ninety percent of the ones who 
                    say no, are haunted by that 
                    decision because the one thing they 
                    could have done to keep some part 
                    of their loved one alive, to honor 
                    that person... they didn t do.

                    We don t get a commission for the

                          (then)
                    I m sorry about your daughter.

      David walks away.  Off Nancy,


      Russ and Alvin watch a basketball game.  Alvin s wearing an 
      oxygen cannula under his nose and there is surgical dressing 
      under his hospital gown.

      Russ agrees.  Andy enters, turns off the TV.

                                  ANDY
                    We need to talk.

      He goes to Alvin s bedside.

                                  ANDY (CONT D)
                    We were hoping we could repair your 
                    heart by replacing the valve.  That 
                    didn t work.  The damage is 
                      irreparable.

                                  ALVIN WEATHERS
                    What does that mean?

                                  ANDY
                    You need a heart transplant.

      That hits Alvin hard.

                    you want to die?

      Off Alvin, his world crashing in,


      YELLOW CAUTION signs guard plastic pails, catching leaks.  
      Sam looks through the window into the O.R., watching Miranda 
      and Inder adjusting the fluids going into Kim s body.  They 
      seem worried.  Miranda sees Sam watching, comes out.

      In no mood to wait, Sam walks away with purpose.


      Sam slams through double doors, angrily searching for Kim s 
      mother.  He passes a room that has been turned into a chapel.  
      Nancy sits in a pew, focusing tearfully on the cross, hanging

                    this beautiful?

      He can see that she s struggling.  He softens. 

                                  SAM
                    Kim was proud of growing up here.  
                    No matter what you think, she loved 
                    coming here.

                    She didn t do it much.  Not lately.

                                  SAM
                    Well, things got... complicated.

      This pains Nancy even more.

                                  NANCY
                    She was going to get her degree and 
                    come back here to teach.  She 
                    wanted to give something back, 
                    raise these kids up.  That s what 
                    she always said, until she met you. 
                    Suddenly, she s moving to New York.

                                  NANCY
                    Her dream got changed for yours.

      Beat, then --

                                  SAM
                    She came with me to visit NYU, did 
                    you know that?  

      Nancy shakes her head, no.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    She wasn t crazy about the city, 
                    but she visited some elementary 
                    schools.  Disadvantaged, poorer 
                    schools.  You know Kim...
                          (then)
                    She spent time with the children and 
                    said she realized that there was no 
                      difference in helping them or 
                    helping the kids in Pawley s Island.  
                    There was so much work that needed 
                    to be done and the important thing 
                    was to do it, where ever you were.

                                  NANCY
                    I said the most awful things to her 
                    this morning.  I tried to talk her 
                    out of going through with the 
                    wedding.  Told her she was turning 
                    her back on her family, the way she 
                    was raised.
                          (then)
                    She s got to wake up, Sam.  She s 
                    got to forgive me. 

      Sam puts his arms around Nancy and she allows it.

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    I feel like I didn t even know her.  
                    I stopped listening, so she stopped 
                    telling me things.

                                  SAM
                    I could fill you in on the last 
                    year.  And maybe you could tell me 
                    about everything before that?

      A small room with a kitchenette and lockers.  The lights 
      FLICKER OFF then ON AGAIN, revealing a lot of people in 
      scrubs going stir crazy, pacing and drinking coffee.  Rain 
      POUNDS, the wind HOWLS as Inder listens intently to the news.  
      Miranda keeps her eyes on the CLOCK, which reads: 9:30 p.m.

                                  INDER
                    The storm was upgraded to a CAT-1 
                      hurricane.  They re closing the 
                    bridge to the mainland in half an

                    We re back on!  The mother changed

                    Go where?  We can t get out of here 
                    in half an hour.  We should wait 
                    until the storm passes.

      Ryan picks up the phone, dials.  Miranda appeals to Yorn.

                                    MIRANDA (CONT D)
                    We can do this much faster if we 
                    all work at the same time.

                                  DR. YORN
                    For what purpose?  You can t get 
                    the organs to our patients or to 
                    the back up offers.

                                    MIRANDA
                    Lucy can try to place them with 
                    patients near Three Rivers.  We ll 
                    fly them all back and do the

      Miranda looks down to see blood pouring into the cavity

      Miranda immediately assists, suctioning the blood away so 
      Yorn can find the problem.  As quickly as the blood is 
      cleared, more appears.

                    I think I nicked it.  The aorta s

                    to cut it short.  Is there anything

                    Bring the remnant of the aorta, 
                    we ll try to repair it.

                                    MIRANDA
                    Okay.  We ll see you in three hours 
                    and forty-seven minutes.

      Andy hangs up.  Miranda nods to Yorn, who then lifts the 
      heart out of Kim s body and places it in the sterile bag 
      David holds for him.  That bag is placed into a second 
      sterile bag, then into a hard plastic container and finally 
      into a blue igloo cooler...


      David runs to the O.R., opens the door to find Lucy standing 
      by as Sam and Nancy view Kim's body, which has been sutured, 
      cleaned and covered.  Nancy s eyes connect with David s.  
      They hold the moment, then David mouths the words --

                                  DAVID
                    Thank you.

      Nancy nods.  She takes Sam s hand, they bow their heads and 
      pray together.  David exits, closing the door quietly.


      Small, cramped - basically a flying Volkswagen.  The violent 
      motion of the plane fighting the storm jostles Miranda, 
      David, Ryan, Inder and the coolers stacked between them.

                                  DAVID
                          (yelling over the noise of 
                          the plane)
                    Why is Ryan trying to kill us?!

                                  RYAN 
                          (yelling)
                    You eat fried potatoes inside of 
                      sandwiches!  Nothing will kill you!

      The plane suddenly DROPS IN ALTITUDE.  The team is rocked as 
      the Cessna attempts to climb out of the storm.  It feels as 
      if it might come apart.  The team members hold on tight, some 
      shutting their eyes.  Miranda looks protectively to the 
      coolers, which are also being jolted.


      Andy looks in on Wilson, being prepped for transplant.  
      Khalid is in surgical scrubs.  Bud exits Wilson s O.R.

                                  BUD
                          (to Andy)
                    We re doing the heart in O.R. two. 

                                  ANDY
                    When s the last time Khalid was 
                    here in the middle of the night?

                                  BUD
                    All-star line up tonight, buddy.  
                    Khalid, Jordan and you.

      Jordan approaches, wearing scrubs.

                                  JORDAN
                    Actually, Andy s going home.  Just 
                    got a call.  The heart recipient 
                    backed out.  She s refusing the 
                    heart.

                                  ANDY

                                  ANDY
                    She s assuming there will be a next 
                    one --

      A beat, Andy gets an idea.

                                  ANDY (CONT D)
                    Let s give it to Alvin Weathers.   
                    Blood type on this heart works, 
                    size should be fine --

                                  JORDAN 
                    We can t do that.  We have to let 
                    UNOS offer it to the next person on 
                    the list.

                                  ANDY
                    There s no time to send it to 
                    another hospital.  That heart has 
                    about an hour and half of viability 
                    left, not to mention a shortened 
                    aorta which will be hell to attach 
                    so no one else will want it.  That 
                    heart goes in Alvin Weathers or it 
                    goes to waste.
                          (starts to go)
                    I ll call UNOS and clear it --

                                  JORDAN
                    No, I ll call UNOS.  You talk to 
                    Alvin Weathers.


      Andy enters to find Alvin alone.  All bravado gone, Alvin is 
      just a scared, sick kid.

                                  ANDY
                          (with gravity)
                    Showtime, Alvin.

      Alvin looks to him.

                                  ANDY (CONT D)
                    There s a heart arriving in half an 
                    hour.  The aorta is short but I can 
                    fix that.  It s a perfect heart 
                    otherwise and it s yours if you 
                    want it.

                    else.  Something maybe you can t 
                    even imagine at this moment.

      Overwhelmed with fear, Alvin s not so sure.

                                  ANDY (CONT D)
                    A second chance is a powerful 
                    thing.  Take it.

      Off Weathers --

      Jordan and her team prepare a FEMALE PATIENT (40 s) for 
      transplant.


      Andy checks under the sterile blue cloth to see that Alvin 
      Weathers is under anesthesia and breathing well.  Andy lays 
      the cloth gently over Alvin s face so that all that is 
      visible to the transplant team, is Weathers  chest.  Just 
      then, Andy s PAGER GOES OFF.  He reads the display --

      The team hurries down the hall.  Jordan is standing at the 
      door to O.R. #1.  David gestures to the cooler in his hand --

      He heads into the O.R. with Jordan.

                          (to Inder)
                    Inder, take the heart to Andy.

      Inder heads into O.R. #2 with the blue cooler.  Miranda 
      hurries into O.R. #3 with the red cooler...


      ... to find Andy and Khalid standing over Wilson.

                    What s going on?

                    There was nothing anybody could do.

      Miranda is beside herself, trying to keep her emotions in 
      check, struggling with anger and a deep sense of failure.  
      Khalid is upset by Miranda s display of emotion.

      Determined to pull Miranda out of her emotional spiral and

                    save the ones we can save.  Scrub 
                    in.

      Miranda forces herself to exit.  A look passes between Andy 
      and Khalid before Andy follows Miranda out. 


      Andy (assisted by Pam and Bud) connects Weathers to the 
      heart/lung bypass machine.

      The CLOCK reads: 3:00 a.m.

                    Going on bypass.

      Andy clamps the aorta.  Red blood flows through the many 
      tubes connecting Weathers to the heart/lung machine.  We 
      watch as Weathers' heart beat slows until it stops.  Andy 
      cuts the connecting arteries, the old heart is removed.

      DAVID holds up the ice-filled bowl containing Kim's heart.

      gloved by Bud.  Her game face on, takes her place opposite of 
      Andy.

      ANDY lowers Kim's heart into Weathers' chest --

      FADE IN:


      Andy works diligently, having difficulty with the short 
      aorta.  Miranda suctions the blood away as Andy works.  On 
      one of the FLAT SCREEN MONITORS OVERHEAD, we watch the action 
      up close as Andy s gloved fingers guide a large needle 
      through the walls of the aorta.  Andy ties off the stitches 
      and says --

                    We re in.  Get ready... taking off 
                    the clamps.

      Andy watches A DIFFERENT OVERHEAD MONITOR for Weathers  vital 
      stats until the moment comes.

                    Here we go.

      Andy massages the heart as it begins to pink up with the 
      blood flow.  All eyes are on the heart as the team waits for 
      it to beat.  

                                  ANDY (CONT D)
                    Come on...

      Everyone holds their collective breath until&

      The heart pinks up and begins to beat.

      Andy smiles at Pam over his mask.

                                  ANDY (CONT D)
                    I never get tired of that.

      Pam smiles back.  Andy looks to Miranda, whose smile is 
      muted.


      Surgery over, Miranda comes through the O.R. doors, ahead of 
      the other medical personnel.  Andy exits the O.R., pulling 
      off his surgical cap, following Miranda into...      THREE RIVERS "Pilot" Revised Network Draft 2-2-09  56.




      ... where an African-American man in his 40's (JOHN RUSSELL),

      Andy heads down the hall.


      Andy walks, Miranda and David join him. 

                                  DAVID
                    Ready for rounds?

                                  ANDY
                    Gotta see Alvin Weathers, I ll meet 
                    you in ICU.

      Ryan pops out of an adjoining hallway, falls in step.

                                  RYAN
                    Oh, guys, hi.  I m having a hard 
                    time locating a three millimeter 
                    catheter adjuster.

      Andy looks to David and Miranda.  What is he talking about?

                                    MIRANDA
                    David and I are helping Ryan with 
                    his medical knowledge.
                          (to Ryan)
                    Did you ask about a six millimeter?

                                  RYAN
                    Yes, but no one seems to --

      Ryan notices the smirks between Andy and David.

                                  RYAN (CONT D)
                    There s no such thing, is there?

                                  ANDY
                    Tell you what, Deejay, why don t 
                    you hold a contest, see if the 
                    tenth caller can tell you.

      As Andy exits into a patient room, he hears Ryan say --




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THREE RIVERS "Pilot" Revised Network Draft 2-2-09  59.

      CONTINUED:


                                  RYAN
                    I was the news guy...


      Alvin Weathers is sitting up in bed, watching a basketball 
      game when Andy enters.

                                  ANDY
                    Couple more weeks like this and 
                    you ll be able to go home.

                                  ALVIN WEATHERS
                    I think you mean Indiana.

      Alvin turns off the television.

                                  ANDY
                    Give it a chance.

      Alvin shrugs, unsure of what his future holds.  A KNOCK on 
      the door, Helen enters.

                                  HELEN
                    The donor family s here.

                                  ANDY 
                          (to Alvin)
                    What do you say?  We could wait --

                                  ALVIN WEATHERS
                          (nervous but willing)
                    Nah.  Let s do it, now.

      Alvin sits a little taller, straightens his shirt and robe as 
      Helen opens the door for Nancy Mullins and Sam Harvey.

                                  HELEN
                    This is Sam, Kim Mullins  husband 
                    and Nancy, Kim s mother.  Dr. 
                    Yablonski and --
                            (gesturing to...)
                    Alvin Weathers.

      Nancy nods but stays quiet, not sure what to make of Alvin.  
      Sam shakes Alvin s hand.

                                  SAM
                    Thank you so much for agreeing to 
                    see us so soon.

                                  ALVIN WEATHERS
                    Sure.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THREE RIVERS "Pilot" Revised Network Draft 2-2-09  60.

      CONTINUED:


                                  SAM
                    I brought a picture of Kim.

      Sam pulls out a PHOTO OF KIM.  She s radiant, beautiful.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    She wanted to teach second grade.  
                    I asked her why second grade and 
                    she said because the kids were 
                    still sweet and hadn t been twisted 
                    by learning fractions.

                                  ALVIN WEATHERS
                            (struggling)
                    I, uh...  Thank you.  For... you 
                    know...

      Nancy finally finds her voice and approaches Alvin.

                                  NANCY
                          (to Weathers)
                    Can I hear my daughter s heart 
                    beat?

      Weathers is surprised by the request but nods, yes.  Nancy 
      puts her ear to Alvin's chest and hears the steady thumping 
      of Kim's heart - alive and strong again.  She wells up.

                                  NANCY (CONT D)
                    You have to live for two, now.  You 
                      understand?  She was my baby and 
                    she was a bright light in this 
                    world and you have to live for her, 
                    too.

      A beat.  Weathers is struck very deeply by this.  Andy sees 
      this working on Weathers as he says --

                                  ALVIN WEATHERS
                    I will.
                          (then)
                    I will.

      Off Andy, watching Alvin s transformation,


      Andy comes out of Alvin s room.  For a moment, he stands in 
      the hallway, letting the moment sink in.  We PULL BACK as 
      Andy heads down the hallway.  He enters the ICU and is joined 
      by Miranda and David and we -- 
                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.
