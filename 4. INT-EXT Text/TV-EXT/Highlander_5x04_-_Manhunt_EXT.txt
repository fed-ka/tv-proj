      To ESTABLISH, as OVER this we hear the sound of starting
      cars, calls of "Later".

                                    CARL (O.S.)
                    Fifteen's not gonna get it done,
                    Bobby.


      The practice is over, the last ballplayers are climbing into
      their cars, taking off.  CARL ROBINSON, late 20's, a tall,
      good looking black man in practice togs, stands standing
      near his red Ferrari.  His monogrammed flash satin jacket
      might as well say "star." He is on his cell phone.

                                    CARL
                    I want twenty million over four years
                    or when spring training ends I'll be
                    playing for Steinbrenner.
                          (beat)
                    It's not my problem.  Let the old
                    man sell more cars.

      At that moment --

                                    FANS (O.S.)
                    Over there!  Carl Robinson!  There
                    he is!  HEY CARL!

      Two teenage FANS have spotted Carl, break into an eager run
      as they head towards him.

                                    CARL
                    Gotta go.

      Carl turns back to the two clamoring FANS waving their
      precious mint-condition balls to be autographed.

                                    CARL (CONT'D)
                    Okay, okay, take it easy... who's
                    first here?

      He takes the closest ball, starts signing -- then frowns.

302CONTINUED:302

                                    CARL (CONT'D)
                    Damn, this looks like the one Griffey
                    hit off me last year.  Who you guys
                    rootin' for, anyhow... ?

      And OFF the Fans' gleeful grins as he signs --

      TREY FRANKS approaches, wearing a team practice jacket, a
      wet stub of cigar, and a heavy equipment bag.  Trey is 40s,
      unshaven, a used-up look.  He's white trash, body gone to
      seed along with childhood dreams of being a great ballplayer. 
      He's an Assistant Trainer, so far down the line, he's hardly
      there.

                                    TREY
                    Lookin' pretty good out there today,
                    Carl.

      Carl gives a scant, sardonic nod, a little patronizing -- he
      doesn't have time for this washed up guy.

                                    CARL
                    Pretty good?

      Trey lowers his bag, wanting to give advice.

                                    TREY
                    Could be better.  You gotta learn to
                    pull the string, throw that change. 
                    You follow me?  You can't do it all
                    with heat.  They start timing you,
                    you're done.

                                    CARL
                            (dismissive)
                    Is that a fact, Trey.

      Carl is barely tolerant.  Trey flares at the tone he wants
      Carl to listen, wants his respect.

                                    TREY
                    Hell yes, it's a fact!  Been a fact
                    since I was in the minors.  You
                    weren't so damn arrogant, maybe you'd
                    know it.

      CLOSE - CARL

      about to reply -- as he gets the BUZZ.  He looks up and sees,
      standing by the edge of the lot --

      AN IMMORTAL

      young, long hair, predatory face -- CORMAN.  He's waiting
      for Carl, and it's not to talk ball.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96503       "Manhunt"      3.       Final Shooting Script 7/18/96

302CONTINUED: (2)302

      Distracted, Carl flips the ball to the delighted Fan.  Trey
      intercepts it.  Trey is going on doggedly, talking around
      his stogie, holding the ball to demonstrate.

                                    TREY
                    It's the motion, see, same as your
                    fastball.

                                    CARL
                    Give the kid the ball, Trey.

                                    TREY
                          (tossing it)
                    The hitters get so far out in front,
                    they dunno whether they're comin  or
                    goin ...

                                    CARL
                          (cutting him off)
                    Later, Trey.  I got things to do.

      Eyes locked on the Immortal, Carl moves off to meet him,
      leaving Trey hanging in mid-sentence.

                                    TREY
                          (tossing the ball to
                          the Fan)
                    And I don't?
                          (an edge)
                    You think I was born in a swamp?! 
                    Ten years in the minors, Carl!  I
                    caught Maddux, Johnson, and Smoltz. 
                    I know things!

      But Carl is gone.  Trey deflates.  His pride has taken a lot
      of kicks over the years -- it doesn't get easier.

                                    TREY (CONT'D)
                      Know-it-all sumbitch.  Ten years in
                    the minors.

      With a twitch of humiliation he shoulders the equipment bag,
      lets out a spit of tobacco juice.


      Carl cautiously faces CORMAN, leering, dripping with self-
      centered arrogance, he's a Melrose Place immortal.

                                      CORMAN
                    If it isn't the great Carl Robinson. 
                    Nice threads, man.

                                    CARL
                    What do you want?

      Corman flaps a wrist, indulges in some sarcastic valley-speak.

                                      CORMAN
                    Your autograph, star-man.  I just
                    totally couldn't live without it.
                          (ice-cold)
                    Saw you playin' on TV a while back. 
                    You got a little trouble with south
                    paws.

                                    CARL
                    So?

                                      CORMAN
                    So I'm a south paw.

      He smiles and pulls his sword, left-handed.  Carl backs off
      warily.

                                    CARL
                    Are you crazy, man?  Not here.  You
                    got the wrong place and the wrong
                    man.  I'm not lookin' for trouble.

                                      CORMAN
                    Surprise, man.  You found it.

      He suddenly SWINGS.  Carl has his sword out, blocks two hard
      swings, driven back each time.  Corman swells with eager
      confidence.

                                      CORMAN (CONT'D)
                      Oh-and-Two.  Excellent.

      He attacks.  Carl's sword goes up, blocking the blows, and
      as they engage --


      The two FANS are drooling over Carl's FERRARI, when there's
      an electric CRACK.  They look up --

      More CRACKS, and a FLASH OF LIGHT from the alleyway.  They
      look at each other, then run towards it.


      As the fans pelt into the alley mouth -- and almost fall
      over as they brake to an abrupt halt.  Staring.

                                    FAN
                    Oh, man.

      On the ground before them --

      A HEADLESS BODY

      Corman.  What's left of him.  The Immortal south-paw.  A
      SLIGHT PAN as their shocked eyes shift up to --

      CARL ROBINSON

      leaning over the corpse, exhausted from the fight and the
      Quickening.  Blood on his slashed jacket, a sword in his
      hand, it's clear he killed the guy.

      THE FANS

      staring, speechless, horrified.

      Carl sees their horrified looks.  He pushes to his feet,
      takes a step toward them.

                                    CARL
                    It's not... No.  No, listen, please...

      But the Fans back away.  A dead body, a sword -- nothing
      Carl could say would help.  Knowing he's in trouble, he turns
      and staggers away down the alley.  As the FANS watch --

      ANOTHER watches from the alley behind them: Trey Franks. 
      Staring at the body, then up after Carl.  His face is tight,
      a twitch of emotion there that we can't read.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      A dingy building in grunge-town.


      A yellow POLICE CORDON still rings the crime site.  Two
      UNIFORMED COPS and two plainclothes DETECTIVES compare notes
      as a DARK SEDAN pulls up.  Detective FRAYNE sizes up the
      newcomer with a sour look.

                                      DETECTIVE FRAYNE
                    Fed.

      A man steps from the sedan: MATTHEW MCCORMICK wears a jacket,
      civvies, looking not at them, but at the crime site as he
      flashes his FBI flap.

                                      MATTHEW
                    Matthew McCormick, Special Agent in
                    charge.  I'll be taking it from here.

      No ego, simply stating a fact.  Mid-thirties, Matthew is
      calm, implacable, relentless -- not a man you'd want after
      you.  The Detectives exchange surprised looks.

                                      DETECTIVE FRAYNE
                    You're the serial killer guy?

                                      MATTHEW
                    Among other things.
                          (polite, acknowledging)
                    The "serial killer guy" is good
                    enough.

      And OFF this, he ducks under the yellow cordon, examining
      the CHALK MARKINGS outlining a headless body with great
      intensity.  He doesn't look at them as he talks.

                                      DETECTIVE FRAYNE
                          (frowning)
                    There's only been ONE murder here.

                                      MATTHEW
                    A very high profile murder, gentlemen. 
                    Let's just say there's a certain
                    pressure to wrap it up quickly...
                    and to make sure it stays wrapped.
                          (beat)
                    Nobody wants to screw up one of these
                    again.

      And OFF this, he slips on a RUBBER GLOVE, lifts a small spot
      of CHARRED CLOTH and stares at it.

                                      MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                    Let me guess.  Murder weapon was a
                    very sharp object.
                          (glancing up)
                    Don't suppose you found it?

      Frayne shakes his head.

                                      MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                    I thought not.  And nobody knows
                    where Carl Robinson is.

      Frayne nods.  Matthew steps from the cordon, to the trunk of
      his sedan.  Opens his trunk to drop in the evidence.  As he
      does --

      ANGLE - MATTHEW'S TRUNK

      revealing a gleaming SWORD lying there.  His sword.  Matthew
      McCormick is an Immortal.  He drops the cloth next to the
      sword, removes the glove, drops it in.

                                      MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                      I wouldn't worry.

      He slams his trunk shut, turns to the Detectives, flashing a
      smile that is not a smile, but a promise.

                                      MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                    I think we'll find him.

      And OFF this --96503       "Manhunt"      12.       Final Shooting Script 7/18/96

                    I'd been a slave since I could
                    remember.


      REVERSE - CARL

      standing in a field.  Clothes torn, shredded and wet-looking
      around the shoulders and neck -- he's been badly whipped. 
      He's trapped, scared to die, angry at the injustice of it.

                                    CARL (V.O.)
                    I was a hard worker -- but I was
                    trouble.

                    Been bought and sold too many times
                    to count.  Seth Hobart was the latest
                    one.


                                    CARL
                    Then somebody knocked up Hobart's
                    youngest daughter.  She hadda name
                    someone.  She said it was me.


                                    CARL (V.O.)
                    It never happened, but nobody listened
                    to my side.  Hell, nobody had to.

      CARL

      shaking his head, desperately pleading his innocence.

      HOBART

      face filled with contempt, righteous anger as he levels the
      gun.  Carl sees it coming.  Shaking his head, he turns, starts
      to run --

      HOBART

      fires.  The big gun kicks out flame --

      CARL

      is hit in the back, slammed to the ground.  Hobart steps up
      to Carl, rolls him onto his back with his boot.  Carl's eyes
      open in a fading glaze.  Death.

                                    CARL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    He shot me in the back, left me for
                    dead.  Only thing was...
                          (beat)
                      I couldn't die.

      Hobart turns and walks away.  Slowly PAN down as we see Carl's
      eyes open.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


      CLOSE - A BILLY CAN hanging over a dying campfire.

      WIDEN -- it's close by a large tree.  Some bedrolls, a
      Hunter's camp, momentarily unoccupied.

                                    CARL (V.O.)
                    I ran for days.  I didn't know why I
                    was still alive...
                          (beat)
                    I just knew that for the first time
                    I could remember, I was free... and
                    I had to keep moving.

      As we watch, a MOVEMENT in the tree, then --

      CARL ROBINSON

      barefoot, ragged clothes, lowers himself awkwardly from the
      tree was hiding in.  He looks hunted, famished.

                                    CARL (V.O.)
                    Dead or alive, I was still a slave.

      He checks around, kneels by the fire.  Raises the billy can
      to his lips.  Eats greedily.

      As he does, a loud CLICK at his ear.  He freezes.

                                    CARL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    And freedom didn't last too long.

      WIDEN -- to find a GUN BARREL jammed into his head.  Slowly
      Carl lowers the tin.  Very carefully, he rises, raises his
      arms as he turns to face --

      TWO WHITE GUYS

      facing him.  One holds a rifle on Carl, while the other raises
      a heavy set of chained MANACLES, and grins.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      Carl is being led along by the two men.  Stumbling as they
      jerk on the rope attached to his manacled wrists.

                                    CARL (V.O.)
                    No way to tell 'em what happened. 
                    Hell, it didn't even make sense to
                    me.
                          (beat)
                    They were lookin' at a reward for
                    bringing in a runaway slave or they
                    were gonna sell me for whatever the
                    market would bear.

      CLOSE - CARL

      as he stops, reacting to the BUZZ.

                    Then I felt it.  It was the first
                    time I'd ever run into one of us.

      One WHITE GUY yanks impatiently on the rope, and then they
      hear a sound, swivel to see --

      MATTHEW MCCORMICK

      riding up on his horse, wearing the garb of a successful
      working plantation owner.  He touches his hat to the white
      men, but his eyes are on Carl.

                                    CARL (V.O.)
                      McCormick.  He used to come by the
                      plantation all the time.  He was
                    married to Hobart's oldest daughter.
                          (beat)
                    He bought me.  Paid twice what I was
                    worth.

      Matthew pulls a small MONEY BAG from his coat, tosses it to
      one of the White Guys.  The other White Guy tosses the rope
      to Matthew, and the two white men head off.

                                    CARL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    I didn't know what the hell to make
                    of him.

      Matthew dismounts, holding the rope, faces Carl.  His face
      unreadable.  Carl wary, belligerent.  The white guys are out
      of sight.  Matthew pushes his coat aside, draws out a gleaming
      SWORD.

      Carl pales, moves back.

                                    CARL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    But I damn sure thought I was dead.

      Matthew gets a grip on the rope, pulls it tight.  Carl trying
      to stay away from that sword, not knowing what will happen. 
      Then Matthew suddenly SWINGS -- and cuts through the chains.

      As Carl raises his hands, stares in wonder at the broken
      metal links --

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      As SETH HOBART rides his fields, riding-crop in hand.  As he
      mops his sweating face, his eyes fall on --

      HOBART'S POV - A MAN

      sitting on a rock, motionless, his back to him.  A black
      man.  Hobart bridles.

                                      HOBART
                    You there!  Get your black ass to
                    work or there'll be hell to pay!

      The black man doesn't seem to hear him.  Doesn't move.

      Furious, Hobart spurs his horse over to the man.

      NEW ANGLE - INCLUDE THE SITTING MAN

      as Hobart dismounts, drops the reins, and approaches.

                                      HOBART (CONT'D)
                    You deaf, or just stupid?

      The man ignores him.  Furious, Hobart lashes out with the
      crop.  It cracks across the man's back, hard as a pistol-
      shot.  The man doesn't move.

      Hobart is goaded.  He strikes again, harder.  This time the
      black man flinches -- but he still doesn't turn.

                                      HOBART (CONT'D)
                    Damn your insolent hide!  Stand when
                    I'm addressing you!

      He brings the crop down on the man's shoulder -- suddenly a
      strong black hand snakes out, grabs the crop.

      Slowly, the black man rises, slowly turns -- it's Carl.

      Hobart turns white in shock as he recognizes him.

                                      HOBART (CONT'D)
                    Sweet Jesus.  Robinson...

                                    CARL
                      Afternoon, Mr. Hobart.  You feeling
                    okay?  You're looking a bit pale
                    around the gills.

      Hobart is staring, backing away in disbelief.

                                      HOBART
                    You're dead!  I shot you!

                          (ominous)
                    Am I?

      He raises the crop -- but Carl yanks it away from him.  He
      advances on Hobart dangerously, starts to hit him.

                                    CARL (CONT'D)
                    Could a dead man do this?
                          (a blow)
                    Or this?
                          (beat)
                    You like it Hobart?  You like how it
                    feels?!

      He's beating Hobart in a blind rage.  Hobart staggers back
      under the blows, towards his horse.  He sees --

      THE PISTOL resting in his saddle holster.

      Hobart grabs it, frantically tries to swing it around -- but
      Carl grabs the gun.  Both men have a grip on it.  Carl drops
      the crop, and slowly starts to twist the barrel back towards
      Hobart.

                                    CARL
                    I'm strong, Hobart.

      Hobart is a tough man, but he's losing this struggle, shaking
      with effort.

                                    CARL (CONT'D)
                    Got strong working your fields...
                    Carrying your loads... !

      Carl twists relentlessly, his fury building.  They're almost
      face to face.

                                    CARL (CONT'D)
                    Under your whip...

      Until the barrel points directly at Hobart's chest.

                                    CARL (CONT'D)
                    No more... NO MORE!

      He squeezes.  A booming EXPLOSION as the .44 kicks, blasts
      Hobart over backwards, into the field.

      Before the echo dies --

                                      CLAYTON

      A cry from the fields, as 20-year-old CLAYTON HOBART stumbles
      toward Carl.  Crying his father's name, he's running at Carl
      carrying a pitchfork.

      RESUME CARL

      his blood is up.

                                    CARL
                    Stay away, boy.  Don't make me.

                                      CLAYTON
                    You murdering nigger.

      Clayton keeps coming.  Carl swings the pistol around, levels
      it, and shoots.  A resounding BOOM --

      CLAYTON HOBART

      spins over backwards into the grass, seeming to take forever
      to fall, the fields echoing with the shot as he hits the
      ground, and lies still.  Then silence.

      Carl slowly he lowers the gun.  There's no triumph on his
      face -- just a sucked-out look.  His voice is a whisper.

                                    CARL
                    No more.  Never.

      WIDER

      as we PULL AWAY from this stark tableau: Carl, the two dead
      men sprawled on the field.

                                                                          TRANSITION TO:


      No game today.  The stadium deserted.  Old programs, paper
      cups blow forlornly across the field.  In the distance, a
      slow, steady WHAP sound.  Almost like Hobart's whip, striking
      a back.  Then we see --

      TREY FRANKS

      sitting on a bench near the dugout.  The sound is him tossing
      a ball into his glove, mechanically, over and over.  He's
      staring straight ahead, not looking at the ball.  Beside him
      on the bench, we see --

      A NEWSPAPER

      and the LEAD STORY there: CARL'S FACE, and the slugline
      MANHUNT CONTINUES FOR BASEBALL STAR.  And below that --
      WITNESSES SOUGHT IN GRUESOME MURDER.

      Trey pulls a half pint of whisky from his pocket, slugs down
      the little that's left.  Tosses it aside.  He looks out over
      the field.  The old programs, the waste... as empty as he
      is.  His expression tightens.  He keeps smacking that ball
      into his glove.  Thinking.96503       "Manhunt"      28.       Final Shooting Script 7/18/96




      Carl moves down the street.  Hands thrust in his pockets,
      head down, he's distracted, tight.  Then --

                                      COP'S VOICE (BULLHORN)
                    Hold it right there!

      Carl freezes.  Ahead of him --

      A COP CAR, blocking the street, and a COP behind the door
      with a drawn gun.

      Carl turns to run back the other way ANOTHER COP CAR squeals
      into the street, the Cops clambering out even before it has
      stopped.  Bookended.

      Nearby, the mouth of an ALLEY.  Carl takes off, blasting
      into it.


      (NOTE: where possible, Camera should be HANDHELD) Carl races
      down the alley, the Cops in pursuit.  A mad scramble as he
      pours on speed, distances them, dodging obstacles and low
      fences, running for his life.

      VARIOUS SHOTS, ENDING IN:

      a FENCE ahead.  A stack of boxes in front.  Carl mounts the
      boxes, scrambles up and flips over the fence --

      NEW ANGLE

      as he lands -- hits a roll of BALING WIRE.  He falls,
      struggles frantically -- but it's useless, he's hopelessly
      tangled.  As he moves, TWO GUNS level at his head.  Carl
      raises-his hands, and closes his eyes in defeat.


      As over this we HEAR --

                                    CARL (O.S.)
                    Because he drinks.  Because he's a
                    loser... hell, maybe he's just plain
                    crazy.


      The CRACK of bat striking ball.  Then another.  A tiny white
      sphere sails far into the distance.

      MACLEOD watches from down the cages.  He tracks the ball's
      flight, then follows its source back to --

      CARL

      standing in the cage, T-shirt on, he grips the bat like a
      weapon, pounding them away as if his troubles would go with
      them.  He's sweating, grimly intent.

                                      MACLEOD
                    It won't go away, Carl.

      Carl curses under his breath, throws the bat against the
      cage in frustration.

                                    CARL
                    Damn him.  Dumbass cracker

                    It's you.

      Carl is pacing, in turmoil.

      And standing at the top -- MATTHEW.  He flashes a grim smile,
      and slowly descends the stands, heading for them.

      MacLeod and Carl watching Matthew.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Looks like you don't have any.

      And OFF this --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Well apart from the batting cages, Matthew moves to a point
      near MacLeod and Carl and stops.

                                      MATTHEW
                    This isn't for you, MacLeod.  You
                    know why I'm here.
                          (to Carl)
                    You should have gone north, Carl.

                                    CARL
                    Maybe so.
                          (beat)
                    What happened back in Louisiana
                    happened.  I can't take it back.

                                      MATTHEW
                    No, you can't.
                          (beat)
                    But you can pay for it.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Matthew, people change.  The world
                    is different.  Carl is different.

                                      MATTHEW
                          (curious)
                    Did you imagine redemption comes so
                    easily, Carl?

                                    CARL
                          (gritting)
                      I imagined there was some justice in
                    what I did.  The men I killed were
                    slavers.

                                      MATTHEW
                    Those men were my friends!
                          (beat)
                    I told you I'd come after you, Carl. 
                    Here I am.

      He draws his sword.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Who wins if one of you dies here?

      They stand that way a tense BEAT, then --

334CONTINUED:334

                                      MATTHEW
                    A man avenges his own, MacLeod. 
                    They were family.
                          (beat)
                    I made a promise.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You think you're honor bound to do
                    this?
                          (Matthew nods)
                    Your honor won't be served by Carl's
                    death.  Only your pride.  Only your
                    vanity.  There's no justice here, no
                      redemption.  Just tragedy.

                                      MATTHEW
                    I gave my word.

      A poignant moment as former teacher and pupil face off. 
      Matthew feels it too.  Carl sees the slight crack in his
      armor.

                                    CARL
                    I don't hold this against you,
                    Matthew.  You do what you have to
                    do.
                          (beat)
                    But I got one favor to ask.

      Matthew hesitates.  Nods.

                                      MATTHEW
                    What?

                                    CARL
                    You win, don't let Trey go down for
                    me.
                          (beat)
                    Man thinks he's worthless, just a
                    piece of human garbage... but he's
                    wrong.  Nobody's garbage.
                          (with feeling)
                    You find a way.  Tell him his life
                    isn't worthless.  It has a point.
                          (beat)
                    I trust you to do that?

      Matthew nods.  Carl takes a breath, raises his sword

                                      MACLEOD
                    Matthew, please, listen to what he's
                    saying.  What he's asking.  Look at
                    him.  Is this a man you want to kill?



                                                                (CONTINUED)96503       "Manhunt"      42.       Final Shooting Script 7/18/96

334CONTINUED: (2)334

                                      MATTHEW
                    What else can I do?

      MacLeod steps between them.  He looks directly at Matthew.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You can forgive him.

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:


      The same grungy warehouse where Carl hid earlier.  MACLEOD
      waits outside, as several CRUISERS pull up, heavily armed,
      Cops piling out, forming a barricade with their car settling
      behind the doors with pump-actions, flaks, ready for serious
      trouble.

      Detective Frayne pulls MacLeod back to where more cops wait,
      Matthew among them.

                                      MATTHEW
                    Better make yourself scarce, Mr.
                    MacLeod.  This could get ugly.

      He starts to turn to his men -- MacLeod stops him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Give me one chance to talk to him. 
                    Settle this peacefully.

                                      MATTHEW
                          (beat)
                    He already killed one man.  Maybe
                    more.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Three minutes.  It's all I want.

      BEAT -- Matthew nods his assent.

                                      MATTHEW
                    It's all you've got.

      MacLeod, hands raised, moves toward the warehouse.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (calling ahead)
                    Carl!  I'm coming in!  I'm not armed!

      There's no answer.  As he steps into the mouth of the
      Warehouse --


      MacLeod emerges.  As he moves to the waiting cars, two vested
      Cops hustle him back to where Matthew stands.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I'm sorry.  I tried.
                          (beat)
                    Says he won't spend the rest of his
                    life in jail.

      Matthew turns to his men, all business.

                                      MATTHEW
                    Get ready, people.  This one's going
                    down hard.

      Before they can make any moves --

                                    COP VOICES
                    "Drop it, man!"  "Freeze!"

      ANGLE - THE WAREHOUSE

      as CARL steps from it, shotgun in hand.

      A sudden CLATTER of many weapons being racked, safeties
      released, as every Cop levels his gun at Carl.

      Matthew spreads his arms, trying to keep it under control.

                                      MATTHEW
                    Easy!  Keep it down!

      He whirls to face Carl.

                                      MATTHEW (CONT'D)
                    Carl Robinson!  Throw down your
                    weapon, put your hands behind your
                    head!

      CLOSE - CARL

      tensing.  He looks at what is arrayed before him:

      CARL'S POV - THE POLICE SQUAD

      bristling with weapons, tense squinting faces all that
      firepower aimed right at him.  And among them --

      MACLEOD

      grim-faced.  Beside him, Matthew, looking neutral.

      RESUME CARL

      he licks his lips.  This is it.  He takes a deep breath --
      and takes a step forward.

      THE COPS

      aiming.

                                      MATTHEW (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Drop the weapon.  DROP THE WEAPON!

      CARL

      keeps coming, a man about to go down in flames.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Carl!  Don't do it!

      Carl stops.  Locks eyes with MacLeod a LONG BEAT, then -- He
      swings up the gun.  There's a BANG -- as Matthew's GUN barks
      once.

      CARL

      is hit in the heart.  He falls, the shotgun firing into the
      air.  Suddenly MORE GUNS fire.  Carl's body hits the ground
      in SLOW MOTION.

      MacLeod looks away, meets Matthew's gaze.  And OFF THIS --



      The stands are empty, the stadium deserted.  Out on the
      diamond, a solitary figure walks the ground, toting his
      equipment bag:  Trey, bleak eyes fixed on nothing as he
      retrieves a lost batting glove.  Then, just ahead of him --

      THE PITCHER'S MOUND

      and a baseball lying there.  The sight of it stops Trey. 
      Memories flooding in.  As he chokes them back --

                                      MACLEOD (O.S.)
                    Trey.

      Trey turns -- it's MacLeod, standing near the dugout.  Trey's
      face closes in, tightens with bitterness.

                                    TREY
                    I don't have to talk to you.

      MacLeod just waits.  He knows the man is churning inside.

                                    TREY (CONT'D)
                    Wasn't for you, he'd still be alive.
                          (letting it out)
                    They had me, dammit, I confessed!

                                      MACLEOD
                          (quiet)
                    You didn't kill anyone, Trey.

                                    TREY
                          (anguished)
                    I didn't save no one, either!

                                    CARL (O.S.)
                    You're wrong.

      Trey stops, turns to the shadowed breezeway, as --

      CARL

      steps into view.  Trey's eyes almost fall out.  Dumbfounded,
      he lowers the bag, unable to speak.

                                    CARL (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, I'm alive.
                          (beat)
                    Don't try to understand.  Just accept
                    it.

      Trey does.  He has to.  He nods, using gruffness to cover
      his emotion.

                                    TREY
                          (looking around)
                    You... you shouldn't be here.  It
                    ain't safe.

                                    CARL
                    I know.
                          (beat)
                    I won't be back this way for a long
                    time.

      Trey is silent for a beat.

                                    TREY
                    You take care, then.
                          (choked up)
                    And don't forget you gotta pull the
                    string.

                                    CARL
                    I'll work on it.

                                    TREY
                    And you got trouble with southpaws.

                                    CARL
                          (a slow smile)
                    Is that a fact?

                                    TREY
                    Hell yes that's a fact, and if you
                    weren't so arrogant, you'd know that.

                                    CARL
                    I'll work on that, too.
                          (beat)
                    Trey... Thank you.

                                    TREY
                    For what?  I didn't do nothin'.

                                    CARL
                    But you did.
                          (beat)
                    You said I changed you.  Fact is,
                    you changed me.
                          (off Trey's stare; he
                            finds the words)
                    You gave me something to live up to.

      He says this with simple dignity, acknowledging the debt.

      Trey can't bring himself to speak.

                                    CARL (CONT'D)
                    You did something great, Trey.  I
                    won't forget it.
                          (beat)
                    Don't you forget it.

      Trey finally nods, both men moved.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Time to go.

      Then Carl breaks away, turns back to MacLeod.  He falls in
      with MacLeod and they disappear into the breezeway, walking
      side by side.

      Trey turns back to the stadium.  The ball lies before him on
      the mound.  Feeling numb, he automatically picks it up, starts
