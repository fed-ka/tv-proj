      THE LIGHTS ARE BRIGHT.  THE GAME IS UNDERWAY. 
      CHARLOTTE SITS IN EXCELLENT BOX SEATS WITH AN
      INCREDIBLY GOOD LOOKING GUY, RICK, AND HER FOUR
      BEST FRIENDS: LESLIE AND JILL BESIDE HER AND MIKE
      AND WAYNE IN THE ROW IN FRONT.  

      WAYNE WEARS A GIANT FOAM FINGER AND MIKE WASHES
      DOWN JUNK FOOD WITH A HUGE BEER.  

      LESLIE IS TYPING ON HER BLACKBERRY.

      JILL FLIRTS WITH A SHIRTLESS BASEBALL FAN WHO IS

      CHARLOTTE, LESLIE AND JILL WALK ALONG THE SIDE WALK. 
      JILL IS DRESSED VERY CONSERVATIVELY: HAIR UP, SKIRT
      AND SWEATER, GLASSES. 

      (THROUGHOUT THE SCENE JILL CHANGES HER CLOTHES AND
      PUTS ON MAKE UP, GETTING DOLLED UP FOR HER DATE.)  

                                JILL

                        (Walking and applying blush)

                Why can't we just take a cab?  We're

                all going to the same neighborhood.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                It's eight blocks, Jill.  You'll

                survive.

                                JILL

                It's just that I have to get ready for

              my date with the body painter.  It's

                easier in a cab.

                                  CHARLOTTE

              Do you have any idea what his name is?

                                JILL

              Of course, I do! It's either Tom, Roger

              or something with a "K". 

                                  LESLIE

                Okay, Charlotte. Here's what you do. 

              Go up there and tell him, "Rick, we

                are adults.  The fact that I refused

                your proposal of marriage --                                                                 19.


                                JILL

              In front of the entire world.

                                  LESLIE

              -- Should have no bearing on our

                professional lives." Then you demand

                that he call his contacts and get us

                those accounts back. 

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Leslie, I'm not going over there to

                talk about business.  I feel bad.  You

                saw the way he was crying. 

                                JILL

                Sobbing.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                I'm worried about him.  He hasn't

                returned any of my calls.  I've sent

                texts, e-mails --   

                                JILL

                Maybe he killed himself?

                                  CHARLOTTE

              He didn't kill himself.

                                JILL

                How sexy would that be though?  A guy

                trying to kill himself just because he

                can't have you.  I'd love that.

      THEY ARRIVE AT RICK'S BROWNSTONE.                                                                 20.


                                  CHARLOTTE

                Here it is.

      SHE BUZZES THE DOOR.  JILL REMOVES HER SWEATER, SHE
      IS BRIEFLY IN NOTHING BUT A SKIRT AND BRA.  

                                  LESLIE

                Jill, we're in the middle of the street.

                                JILL

                Hey, man.  I gotta date. I can't show

              up looking like I just graded papers. 

      JILL PUTS ON A TOP AND TAKES HER HAIR DOWN.

                                JILL (CONT'D)

                There.  The transformation it complete.

                                  LESLIE

                You're like the Clark Kent of sluts.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                He's not answering.

                                JILL

                        (Ominously)

                Maybe we're too late. 

      CHARLOTTE OPENS HER PURSE AND TAKES OUT A KEY.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                I'm gonna let myself in.

                                  LESLIE

                Good.  Now, when you talk to him try

                and act sad.  Like you've been having

                a rough night as well.  Match his mood.

                It's a sales technique, works every

                time.                                                                21.


                                JILL

                No!  Act like you're on top of the

                world.  Like he hasn't even entered

                your mind in the past twenty four hours. 

                Guys will do anything for a girl who

                doesn't give a crap about them.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                Guys, please.  I can handle this.

      CHARLOTTE OPENS THE DOOR.

                                JILL

                Charlotte.  After you apologize, give

                him one more tug at the slots.

                                  LESLIE

                Jill!

                                JILL

                It's a consolation prize.

                                  LESLIE

                Actually, it's not a bad idea.  If

                you're really good, he might be more

                disposed to get us those accounts back.

                                  CHARLOTTE

                You've both been very helpful.

      CHARLOTTE ENTERS THE BUILDING. 

                                                              DISSOLVE TO:                                                                22.
