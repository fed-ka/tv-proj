    superbly sexy. She's watching something on the ground below
    with bemused interest. CRASH!



    where Lois looks at him.

                                   LOIS
                  You beat Superman.

                                   KOMBAT
                  To a pulp.

                                   LOIS
                       Thank God!

    They come together in an embrace.

                                   LOIS
                  I was getting so sick of him.

                        female voice)
                  Jaxon, haven't you wasted enough
                  time playing games?

    PULL BACK TO REVEAL:



    We're watching this on a Virtual Screen (a large monitor).
    In front of the screen, WE FIND JAXON XAVIER, known more
    simply as "X", a strange-looking, freakish fellow with a big
    grin.  He wears a VIRTUAL HELMET and a SLEEK BLACK SUIT.
    WIRES from the chair are attached to helmet and gloves.  On
    his LEFT WRIST is a very distinct WATCH.  On its face are
    the initials "L.L." and a small lever.

    The screen in front of him projects what he/we were
    seeing -- Kombat kissing Lois Lane, and Jaxon is living the
    role of Kombat!

                                   JAXON
                  I'm not playing, I'm rehearsing!

                                   COMPUTER
                  Rehearse all you want, it won't get
                  you what you need.



    Kombat breaks away from the kiss, flashes Lois a killer
    smile, then "clicks" the lever on his watch (the escape
    window) and DISAPPEARS.



    Jaxon takes off his virtual helmet.  The screen in front of
    him is FROZEN with the image of Lois Lane.

                                   JAXON
                  I need to get used to the idea that
                  in this world I may be just another
                  geek with a lotta RAM... but in
                  that world, I'm a god.  Being a
                  god takes practice.

                                   COMPUTER
                  That world is nothing but a
                  pixilated pinball game unless you
                  get those passwords from the real
                  Lois Lane.

    He moves close to the screen and the frozen image of Lois.

                                   JAXON
                  Oh, I'll get them.  She doesn't 
                  know it, but she's going to give me

    FADE IN:


    JIMMY OLSEN has on a pair of virtual goggles.  He's got a 
    big smile on his face, his fingers breezing across his keyboard.

                                   JIMMY
                       (chuckles to himself)
                  Oh, Chief, you're gonna thank me...

    PERRY WHITE crosses behind Jimmy, pulls off his goggles.

                                   PERRY
                  Thank you for what?

                       (rubs his eyes)
                  Owww!  Chief, you can't just pull 
                  virtual goggles off somebody.  It's 
                  dangerous.  If I was in a virtual 
                  program, you could mess with my 
                  mind.

                                   PERRY
                  If they're that dangerous, then you 
                  shouldn't be putting them on.  Now, 
                  what in Sam Hill are those things, 
                  and what am I gonna thank you for?

                                   JIMMY
                  They're virtual goggles.  It's a 
                  way of transporting yourself to 
                  another world... a world where I 
                  have to say in all modesty, I'm                  (X)

                                   PERRY
                  Jimmy, I don't like dating                       (X)
                  services, and I don't trust

                  I know I'm grabbing this lamp, you 
                  get my meaning, son?

    Perry's holding the lamp as if he might hit Jimmy with it.

    Lois and Clark have each slipped on a pair of VIRTUAL 
    GOGGLES, and a pair of VIRTUAL GLOVES.  The goggles are not 
    yet over their eyes.  Their VITAL SIGNS are displayed on a 
    monitor next to them.  Jaxon checks to make sure all the 
    wire connections are secure.

    He does a double-take at Clark's vital signs, which are 
    _way_ different than Lois'.  Jaxon bangs the side of the 
    machine.  Clark sees this, checks Lois' display -- closes 
    his eyes, and his display suddenly reads the same as Lois'.

                  Lois Lane is not someone to whom
                  you should become emotionally

                                   JAXON
                  I know that.

                                   CLARK
                  I wonder if everything in virtual                (X)
                  reality feels this real.                         (X)

    He kisses her.                                                 (X)

    They kiss again.                                               (X)

                                   JAXON (O.S.)
                  Okay, trip's over.

    Lois and Clark straighten up, startled.  Jaxon has appeared 
    from nowhere, and he's dressed in a very stylish white suit.
    As they move to him, they whisper to each other.

                                   LOIS
                       (sotto)
                  Why is he wearing that suit?

                                   CLARK
                       (sotto)
                  To impress you.

                                   LOIS
                  No, he's not.

                                   CLARK
                  Yes, he is.

    Though overdressed for the occasion, Jaxon looks and moves
    much better in this virtual environment -- stronger and more
    vibrant.  He's all business.

                                   JAXON
                  Time to go back to reality.  Just
                  relax and...                                     (X)

    Jaxon takes Lois' hand.  The three of them DISAPPEAR as the    (X)
    screen goes WHITE.

    FADE IN:


    Lois and Clark, sitting in their chairs, emerge from the
    virtual world.  They take of their gloves, goggles.            (X)

    They turn to see Jaxon standing in the doorway of his Master
    Station, watching them with a smile.

    Jaxon removes his goggles, and starts typing on his

    kissing, talking close.

    Jaxon is still working on Clark's vital sign monitor.  He
    has a control panel open, and tools strewn about the floor.

                  Jaxon, they've arrived at Lois'
                  apartment.  How are we coming?

                                   JAXON
                  Just a few more minutes.  It seems
                  Mr. GQ here has shorted out some
                  circuits.

    He hits Clark in the shoulder, but hurts his hand.

                                   JAXON (CONT'D)
                  Ouch! He's thicker than he looks.



    They enter, and the place looks the same.  Everything
    appears normal.

                  Act normal.

    She takes a deep breath.

                                   LOIS

                  You know, on the beach he showed
                  up when you and I were kissing.
                  And that car chased us when we were

                       (a little breathy)
                  Still nothing...

    They kiss again, really deep, and passion starts to take 
    over.  They are barely able to pull apart.

                                   CLARK
                  Anything?

    Their faces smash together, and they're lost in passion.



    They fall onto the bed.  She takes off his glasses, loosens
    his tie, while he unbuttons her jacket and peels it off her
    shoulders.

    Clark's vital signs suddenly go haywire -- and everything
    shorts out!  There is smoke, sparks, and Jaxon runs for his
    Master Chamber.

    Jaxon looks up at the monitor.  His eyes go wide -- Lois and
    Clark locked in their embrace.

                                   JAXON
                  I have an idea.  If she's so hot
                  for Kent, then...

    Jaxon jumps into his seat at his master chamber, and slips
    on his goggles, starts typing rapidly.



    Lois pulls off Clark's shirt.  He is bare-chested.  Clark      (X)
    looks at Lois.  His hands reach for her blouse, when --        (X)

    A door is kicked in.  Kombat stands there, dramatically        (X)

                  virtual world, and only I can let
                  her out.  I control the escape

    The computer suddenly answers back, and Lois nearly jumps
    out of her seat.

                                   COMPUTER

    Jimmy and Superman are outside the door, listening.

                                   JIMMY
                  The guy sounds like Clark.

                                   SUPERMAN
                  It's not Clark.  Trust me, no
                  matter what he looks like.  He's
                  not Clark!



    Clark/X turns menacingly to Lois. She's getting scared
    now.                                                           (X)

                  a child from another woman?

    Clark/X grabs Lois by the collar, pulls her close.  She
    notices his "L.L." watch.

    Lois' hand reaches to the side.  She picks up a vase, and
    slams it on his head.  He is unfazed, stands up.

                  I'm not sure what he wants.  Except
                  that he's obsessed with what Lex
                  wanted to name our children.

                                   JIMMY
                  He's looking for access codes.

                                   LOIS
                  Access to what?

                                   JIMMY
                  Well, I think this is Luthor's                   (X)
                  system --

                  You're telling me we're inside
                  something Luthor made?

                                   JIMMY
                  Yeah.

                                   LOIS
                  Uggh.  The phrase 'it can't get                  (X)
                  any worse' just doesn't apply in                 (X)

                  It's only the fate of the entire

    Jaxon studies his computer screen, then:

                  wasn't Luthor's choice?  What if it

    He types C-L-A-R-K on the computer screen.  The word

                  Me, too.                                         (X)

                                   LOIS
                  I mean, just when I think I know                 (X)
                  everything there is to know, you                 (X)
                  take my breath away with something               (X)
                  new.

                                   CLARK
                  Good.  Because that's what happens               (X)
                  to me everytime I see you.                       (X)

                                   LOIS
                  I'm counting the hours to our                    (X)
                  honeymoon.                                       (X)
                       (kiss)
                  But, in the mean time, what do you
                  say we go get some pastrami?

                                   CLARK
                       (moving off)
                  Russian dressing.

                                   LOIS
                  Sliced pickles.

                                   CLARK
                  Side of slaw.

                                   LOIS
                  And a crrrream soda...

    As they walk off, CAMERA HOLDS on CLARK'S COMPUTER MONITOR.
    It displays the Daily Planet Menu.  A small, "glitch" and we
    suddenly see JAXON'S FACE fill the screen, looking for a way
    out.  Another "glitch" and Jaxon disappears.

                                                     FADE OUT:

                            _THE END_
