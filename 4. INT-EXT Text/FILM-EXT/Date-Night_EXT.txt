As Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport
next to the house, his overly cheery neighbor CHAZ picks
a newspaper off his lawn.
CHAZ (O.S.)
Well, well! We're up bright and early,
aren't we!
PHIL
Yes we are!
(under his breath)
ike you say to me every morning.
Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and
Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara'
car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few
inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING
STUCK halfway.

PHIL (CONT'D)
OW! OW! OW!
Dislodging himself, Phil sidesteps between the cars and
peers around the other side of Clara's. TONS of room.
Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car's passenger
side. OPEN HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the
front passenger door. Frustrated, Phil hops in the rear
and grunts as he climbs diagonally over to the driver's
seat.
HONKING.
The Eisenhower Highway is a parking lot as ROAD
CONSTRUCTION blocks 3 out of 4 lanes. In the middle of
it, Phil checks his watch, frustrated. Peering out his
window, he looks at a billboard of a smiling older man in
slick suit and construction hat. The sign reads MAYOR
DIGGS APPRECIATES YOUR PATIENCE WHILE WE BUILD OUR
HIGHWAY TO THE FUTURE! Phil scowls, then checks his
watch.
E
Clara and JANE, another sharply dressed realtor in her
30's, walk down the street putting up OPEN HOUSE ARROW
SIGNS on the sidewalk.
JANE
His name's Juan and he's some kind of
Spanish, I think. He knows all these
exclusive, underground places downtown.
It's so exciting. And in bed...
(WHISPERS)
I never knew I could still get my leg
back that far.
CLARA
Too much information, Jane.
Phil's flustered as he and Clara head out the door
towards Phil's car.
CLARA
I'm sorry, Phil. I just felt like she's
doing us a favor tonight.
PHIL
fine. Fine.
oust as they climb into the car, Clara stops.
CLARA
You know, I should pee before we go.
PHIL
(BEAT)
OK. Sure.
As Clara runs back to Ruth's house, Phil plops down in
the driver's seat.
PHIL (CONT'D)
I'll just wait in the car as you go back
E inside to pee. Again.
As the sun sets, Phil and Clara sit in BUMPER TO BUMPER
TRAFFIC. It extends for MILES toward the center of the
city.
CAR - S
Phil turns on the air conditioner and adjusts the vents.
PHIL
You gotta almost feel sorry for Mayor
Diggs. Tries to widen all the highways
to get reelected, but all everyone's
going to remember when it's time to vote
is all this mess.
CLARA SHIVERS
CLARA
You're hot?
PHIL
Yeah. That's why I turned on the air.

E
CLAPA
OHM
Clara shuts the passenger side vents which causes AIR to
GUST out of Phil's vents, into his face. He glances at
Clara, oblivious, then reaches over and turns down the
air.
CLARA (CONT'D)
You know, Mrs. Cardigan told me today
that Ollie's been antagonizing his
daughter.
PHIL
Antagonizing? How does a five year old
"antagonize?" I'm sure she wouldn't have
mentioned it if it wasn't "the Mayor's
daughter."
CL
She also went on that Ollie's
penmanship's sloppy and he's not
motivated enough.
PHIL
(trying to make a joke of
Got all my best traits, huh?
He looks over to see that Clara looks out of the wiF n,,
not responding - a response in itself. He sucks in.
PHIL (CONT'D)
I think he's fine.
CLARA
She actually had the gall to suggest we
should think about sending him somewhere
else.
PHIL
Maybe she's right if the school has that
kind of attitude.
Clara's about to object bit stops herself and takes a
breath, playing affection-.-ely with the back of Phil's
hair.
CL RA
You know what? All we ever end up
talking about is Ollie or work. Let's
just focus on us tonight.
PHIL
SMILES)
Great. I'm all for tha
Beat. They sit in silence in the traffic.
Ga.
CLARA
So what are you thinking about?
PHIL
Right now? Traffic.
CLARA
Oh. Well, I heard this unbelievable
story from Jane today.
PHIL
Yeah?
CLARA
She has this old classmate who went into
labor with her second child the other
day. She's totally healthy and
everything's normal with the pregnancy.
So she goes into labor and walks into the
emergency room, and the second the nurses
and attendants see her come in, they go
into a panic and start yelling A,LA! ATMiA!
AMA!
PHIL
What's AMA?
CLARA
Advanced Maternal Age!
PHIL
(CHUCKLES)
No! You've got to be joking me!
CLARA
kid you not!
PHIL
That's unbelievable!
CLARA
I know.
Beat. Clara looks out the window.
CLARA (CONT'D)
The funny thing is she's my age,
actually.
Suddenly, Phil's smile fades as he realizes the possible
ulterior motive.
PHIL
Huh.
S
21.
E
Clara picks up on his change and figures out what he's
thinking. A bit flustered, she opens her vents again.
Phil looks over at her.
PHIL (CONIT'B)
I thought you were cold.
CLARA
I was, but then you turned it down and I
got hot.
PHIL
But I turned it down because... you see
when you open and close your vents it
makes my... never mind.
Phil reaches over and turns up the air again. Tapping
his fingers on the wheel with a sigh, he gets fed up,
suddenly veering the car to the shoulder and speeding
toward the exit.
CL AAA
What are you doing?
PHIL
I'm just gonna take a shortcut.
CLARA
Phil, please don't. You think they're
shortcuts but they always take longer.
And we're already-
PHIL
Clara, please just trust me, OK
They zoom ahead for a moment in silence. Frustrated,
Clara shuts her vents, once again sending a POWERFUL GUST
OF COLD AIR onto Phil's face. Biting his tongue, he just
leaves it blowing on him as they drive.
In the middle of the deserted warehouse district, Clara
and Phil exit the meat packing plant behind Frank, who
carries Clara's purse, Harry holding a gun as he follows
them. As they head toward a Towncar, Frank throws the
keys back to Harry.
FRANK
You drive with her in front.
PHIL
(WHISPERS)
So what's your plan here?
CLARA
(WHISPERS)
I don't have a plan Phil.
PHIL
(WHISPERS)
You don't have a plan?
33.
CLARA E
(WHISPERS)
No. I was just trying to keep our knees
for the time being.
PHIL
(WHISPERS)
Well, if we end up in that car with them
we're as good as dead.
FRANK
Quiet!
CLARA
(WHISPERS)
Well, any time you want to help...
PHIL
(WHISPERS)
What's that supposed to mean?
FRANK
I said quiet!
They continue walking toward the Iowncar, Phil thin ing
hard. Suddenly, his expression changes and he star s
weaving dizzily, putting his hand to his forehead.
CLARA
Phil?
He drops to the ground.
PHIL
Whoa.
CLARA
Phil? What is it?
PHIL
I'm... not feeling so great...
HARRY
's wrong with him?
CL:
I don't know.
PHIL
(BREATHING HARD)
I didn't... eat dinner and when I don't
my blood sugar... Hypoglycemic...
CLARA
You're not hypoglycemic.
Phil shoots Clara a quick LOOK OF
34.
CLARA (CONT'D)
(CATCHING ON)
You're diabetic! You never get the terms
right, Phil! Oh no! This is bad, guys.
PHIL
I just can't... go any further.
Harry and Frank look at each other, not sure what to do.
HARRY
Should we call Mr. Stockton?
FRANK
Don't say his name, you idiot!
HARRY
Sorry! I was just-
FRANK
We'll just throw him in the back and have
her show us.
hey move over to pick up Phil. Clara thinks fast.
CLARA
Wait! In my purse there's a Luna Bar.
If you give it to me I can find it for
him.
With a sigh, Frank hands Clara her purse. She rummages
inside...
and quickly WHIPS OUT her MINI 409 SPRAY, spritzing
Frank right in the eyes. With a shriek, he falls back
grabbing his face and dropping his gun. Clara makes a
dash and grabs it. As Frank blindly lunges after her,
she KNEES HIM IN THE BALLS. He collapses on the ground,
whimpering in pain. She spins and points the gun at
Harry.
CLARA (CONT'D)
Drop the gun and the keys.
PHIL
oa! Clara! No
Harry drops them, raising his hands. Phil gets up and
grabs the gun and keys, then awkwardly hits Harry as hard
as he can on the back of the neck with the butt of the
gun.
Harry looks at him, confused.
HARRY
Ow! Why, man?
35.
E
PHIL
Sorry. i was trying to knock you out.
HARRY
Why,
PHIL
ought that's what you do when-
CLARA
Phil! Just c'mon!
PHIL
USHING OFF)
Sorry.
Befuddled, Phil meets Clara at the car and they climb in
and speed away.
PHIL (V.0.) (CONT'D)
OK, let me just start from the very
beginning...
Clara tries on her phone, then hangs up, frustrated.
CLARA
Great, Phil. Now she's not picking up at
all!
PHIL
You think this is my fault, don't you?
T - ft
(SIGHS)
No. I just don't know why you two can't
get along is all.
PHIL
You know, your Mom shows me no respect, 0
Clara. And you just pretend like it
isn't happening.
CLARA
So you think it's j1y fault. Listen,
Phil. Every single other boyfriend I
ever dated got along with her just-
(REALIZING)
Wait a minute! Holbrooke Peterson!
PHIL
What?
Clara starts looking through her purse for her phone.
CLARK
Holbrooke Peterson does something hush
hush with the FBI! I think he even lives
down here.
PHIL
Holbrooke Peterson? You mean the tongue
guy?
CLARA
What?
46.
PHIL
Holbrooke was your prom date who you said
had the really long tongue, right?
CLARA
(GIGGLES' )
Oh yeah.
(catching herself, shrugs
CASUALLY)
Uh, yeah... something like that...
She finds her phone and dials.
PHIL
Since when have you been in touch with
Holbrooke Peterson?
CLARA
(SHRUGS)
We found each other on Facebook
PHIL
Facebook? I didn't know you were on
Facebook!
CLARA
It's a networking thing for work.
Everyone's on Facebook.
11
PHIL
0 yeah? Who else are you "in touch"
h on Facebook?
CLARA
O PHONE)
Hello? Holbrooke? Thank God you're
there. It's Clara Foster...
Phil and Clara back away, keeping Holbrooke between th
and the agents. Through the door, Agents slowly creep
down the hallway after them, guns trained.
HOLBROOKE
Seriously, Phil. I'm a bad shield. I
promise.
CLARA
Wow, Phil!
Phil feels a little pumped up with Clara's praise.
PHIL
Just give me your car keys, Holbrooke.
When we're about to drive off we'll let
you go.
HOLBROOKE
Uh, they were on the keychain.
PHIL
What?
HOLB'?n`_
The key chain you dre-,~_d with the keycard
inside. The keys were on that.
And so the hero falls...
PHIL
Shit.
CL AA
we'll never outrun them.
56.
Searching around, Phil eyes the KEYCARD PANEL outside the
entrance. He aims the gun and FIRES, MISSING BADLY.
Both he and Holbrooke cover their ears.
HOLBROOKE
AH!
PHIL
YOW! Man is that loud!
As the Agents run toward the door, Clara quickly grabs
the gun from Phil and shoots, nailing the lock.
PHIL (CONT'D)
(stunned, looks at her)
How are you so good at that?
The Agents try the door, but are LOCKED IN. Agent #1
tells his men to stand back and tries shooting the glass,
but it's BULLETPROOF. He gestures and all the Agents
rush around to the front.
CLARA
gotta get going! Quick!
PHIL
Where?
They both look around, unsure.
HOLBROOKE
Across the bridge a few blocks down that
street there's an entrance to the Green
Line subway. Get on it and you can get
anywhere in this city.
Phil and Clara look at him, confused.
PHIL
Aren't you supposed to be our hostage?
HOLBROOKE
(SIGHS)
Whatever. I don't know. Sure. What's
the difference? I'm never gonna get
behind that desk now anyway.
my gun! I dropped it in front of
everybody!
PHIL
It wasn't so much of a drop. it was more
of a... bobble.
CLARA
Yeah, a bobble's bad...
57.
HOLBROOKE
Listen, if you just leave me here I can
tell them you ran the other way. It'll
buy you time to get there. And maybe I
can work on clearing all this up for you.
Phil and Clara look at each other, then start to run
away. Suddenly Phil stops, thinking.
CLARA
What?
PHIL
Let me have the gun.
As Clara gives it to him, Phil quickly runs back and
hands it to Holbrooke
PHIL (CONT'D)
Here. Tell them you got it back from us.
Holbrooke takes back his aun, grateful.
HOLBROOKE
Thanks, Phil.
As Phil runs back, Clara takes in the nice gesture of
husband.
EXT RIDGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
A lit up raucous PARTY BOAT in a canal starts to pass
under a roadway bridge up ahead as Phil and Clara, trying
to stay in the shadows, walk quickly toward it. Phil
glances back over their shoulders - the road is DESERTED.
PHIL
it's just on the other side of that
bridge. I think we're going to make it.
He notices Clara looking at him.
PHIL (COND
What?
CLARA
Nothing. That was just nice of you, back
there.
(BEAT)
This is crazy, but you know what I'm,
reminded of right now?
PHIL
Bourne identity?
58.
CLARA
I'm talking about right now. When we
used to walk home late at night after
going downtown to the clubs. We couldn't
ever find a cab, remember? We'd grab
those "healthy" dogs and cheese fries at
the Weiner's Circle and go to the Adler
Planetarium to watch the sunrise.
PHIL
Where I held your hand for the first
time.
CLARA
I can't believe we used to stay up all
night like that.
PHIL
It's because we could sleep 'til noon.
CLARA
(SMILES SLYLY)
If I remember correctly, we weren't
always "sleeping."
Beat as they share the moment together, walking.
PHIL
I just don't understand when we got so...
I don't know...
CLARA
Old.
PHIL
No, I was thinking numb. When did we
become one of those couples that we used
to look at in restaurants back then and
think were so sad?
CLARA
We're not that bad, Phil. I just think we
haven't been that honest with each other
recently.
Phil doesn't understa
CLARA (CONT'D)
Not big things. Just little things
keep adding up and putting this thing
between us.
(BEAT)
Like the fact I know you never want to
talk about us having this other baby.
59.
PHIL
It's not that I don't want another kid,
Clara. It's just... I used to be the
whole pie with you. And now with Ollie
and your work, I'm barely even a piece of
the pie anymore. I'm, like, maybe a
pecan on a piece of the pie! So part of
me's not jumping at the chance of having
the little pecan I have left of your
attention going into some new baby's
mouth!
CLARA
But that's crazy, Phil. When you're home
you're the one who seems like your hardly
even there! It's all about your work.
Believe me, if you-
Clara suddenly notices a POLICE CAR, lights off, drive
past them over the bridge.
CLARA (CONT'D)
Shit!
PHIL
I think we're OK. Just play cool and
keep walking.
The patrol car continues across and down the street. 11
Phil and Clara breathe a sigh of relief.
Then suddenly, a few blocks down, BRAKE LIGHTS. The
patrol car turns around and TURNS ON ITS LIGHTS, zooming
back toward them.
PHIL (CONT'D)
Now you can say shit.
Phil looks around - they're in the middle of the bridge
with no place to run. Then he notices the lit up PARTY
BOAT coming out the other side of the bridge beneath
them.
PHIL (CONT'D)
e 's only a few feet.
CLARA
What u high? No way.
But looking main at the patrol car speeding toward them,
Phil grabs Clara and dashes for the side of the bridge.
CLARA (CONT'D)
AH!
11
60.
As she's YANKED OVER THE SIDE, Clara CLUTCHES onto the
railing. With Phil hanging onto her other arm, they
DANGLE above the water and the boat.
CLARA (CONT'D
Ahhh! Are you CRAZY!?!
PHIL
Let go, Clara!
CLARA
A GROUP of DRUNKEN PARTIERS on the boat, spotting them,
cheer below. Some even take FLASH PICTURES. Phil looks
down - if they don't let go soon they're literally going
to miss the boat.
PHIL
go or I'm going to tickle you!
CLARA
(DEAD SERIOUS)
No you're not, Phil. We have a rule!
tickling. I'm not-
He reaches up and TICKLES Clara under her arm. She
giggles.
E
CLARA (CONT'D)
(LAUGHING)
Ah! Stop it, Phil! Ah! It's not funny!
I mean- Stop it! Ah!
Clara can't hold on any longer...
They land - THUMP! - onto the top deck of the boat, both
groaning as they roll back and forth while the Drunken
Partiers CHEER and FLASH PHOTOS.
PHIL
Ow! I think I broke my butt.
CLARA
OW! OW! Dammit, Phil! What's our rule
about tickling?
PHIL
I'm sorry! I didn't do it for pleasure!
What is our rule?
0
61.
PHIL
(BLANDLY RECITES)
"It's only funny if it's funny for the
both of us."
CLARA
Right! And guess what? It wasn't funny
for me, Phil!
Clara gets up and storms off, clutching her arm. Walking
down the side of the boat, she passes a MAN down on one
knee in front of an EXCITED WOMAN, who nods, accepting
his proposal.
CLARA (CONT'D)
(MARCHING PAST)
B i g mistake!
They look at her, stunned.
A OTHER PART OF THE BOAT - M0_,'_= -1; LATER
Phil limps along, finally finding Clara alone and calmed
down, looking out over the rear of the boat. He comes
next to her. Beat.
PHIL
T ' s your elbow?
CL RA
(SIGHS)
's OK, How`s your butt?
PHIL
Well, for jumping off a bridge onto a
moving boat, not so bad.
(SHAKES HEAD)
I can't even fucking believe this is
happening to us.
CLARA
You know, we're kind of running ou
ons.
PHIL
Maybe we could just hide or something
until this all blows over.
CLARA
What makes you think it ever wil
PHIL
iaybe we should just turn ourselves
11
62.
CLARA
(SIGHS)
Imagine what it's going to be like for
Ollie when everyone hears about this
tomorrow. I bet our pictures are going
to be all over the papers.
Phil nods, gazing out. Then suddenly an idea comes to
him.
PHIL
Wait. What if we found the pictures?
CLARA
What do you mean?
PHIL
These pictures that everyone's after.
we could get them we'd have some kind o
bargaining chip to get out of this.
CLARA
But then we'd have to find the Gales.
don't know anything about them.
PHIL
(THINKS)
Except... the Rainbow.
CLARA
(CATCHING ON)
The pictures have something to do with
that place!
PHIL
Yeah, but even so, Holbrooke said these
clubs are so secret you have to know
where they are and how to get in-
Clara rummages through her purse and grabs her phone,
dialing, then notices Phil looking out, shaking his head.
CLARA
What?
PHIL
You're not listening to me again!
CLARA
"You have to know where they are and h
to get in-"
PHIL
That's great. Clara wanna cracker?
63.
C LARA
I'm calling because of what you said,
Phil. I know who can help us.
Clara dials the number.
CLARA_ (CONT'D)
Hey Jane, it's Clara.
(LISTENS)
Where am I?
(beat, looks around)
I'm... I'm on a party cruise around
Chicago. Oh yeah. It is turning into
quite a night. Listen, we need to go to
this club called the Rainbow later. Do
you know how we can get in?
Clara looks at Phil, excited, and nods as she plugs her
ear and listens. Phil watches her until he notices the
boat IS TURNING. He looks around the side.
A slew of POLICE CARS on the shore. He taps Clara.
PHIL
ara...
Clara turns and looks.
CLARA
Oh shoot. You know what Jane? I've
actually gotta jump off right now.
It's WINDY and COLD as Phil and Clara, soaked, squeak and
slosh down the street. Clara, missing one heel, dumps
water out of her purse as she checks her cellphone.
CLARA
Mine's totally shot too.
PHIL
You got the info from her though, right?
CLARA
Yeah, but we can't get in looking like
this, Phil.
PHIL
I don't think we have a choice. Not a
big shopping hour.
They walk past the 24 CHICAGO FITNESS CENTER, lights
blazing. Windows show machines filled with young
HARDBODIES working out.
PHIL (CONT'D)
Now if we wanted to do a little cardio,
on the other hand. Who knew that many
people worked out at 1 in the morning?
Clara thinks a moment, then stops in her tracks and looks
back up at the building.
PHIL (CONT'D)
You wanna do a little cardio?
Clara smirks at him, then Phil, thinking, gets it. He
shakes his head.
PHIL (CONT'D)
OK, now that's scary. You know you're
starting to think like a real criminal?
You know that, don't you?
Clara waggles her eyebrows. We hear Devo's "Secret Agent
Man" over a TrC _ GE .
Looking both ways, Phil and Clara walk nervously down a
dark, derelict alley.
PHIL
Down here?
JANE
It's what she said.
PHIL
And if you die, does Jane get your
commissic-l on the open house?
Up ahead, a TWO S:_=:Y LOOKING CHARACTERS huddle near a
bunch of GARBAGE CANS watching them, a SMALL FIRE nearby.
Nervously, Clara approaches.
CLARA
Excuse me?
Men shoot her a fierce look.
E
66.
CLARA (CONT'D)
Um... do you know which is the way back
to Kansas?
They eye her, then inspect Phil up and down. One of them
LUNGES, and Phil jumps back...
but he's moving aside some trash cans, revealing a
RAINBOW COLORED STAIRWAY going down.
SHADY GUY #1
Welcome to the Rainbow.
Phil and Clara knock on the door of a the deserted
looking row house. No answer. Clara tries the door...
PHIL
That never really-
OPENS. She shoots Phil a look.
PHIL (CONT'D)
OK. Never mind.
Phil and Clara inch insi
RUN DOWN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
As they start down the dark hallway to the living room,
Phil hunches over, hugging the wall.
CLARA
are you bent over like that?
PI
sneaking.
CLA?.A
Rut why don't you just walk normally and
quietly?
PHI
This is the wav I sneak. You sneak in
your way and I'll sneak in mine, OK?
71.
CL
(SHRUGS)
OK. Fine. I was just asking.
Clara walks quietly behind crouching Phil. Reaching the
living room, they spot TWO PACKED SUITCASES on the couch.
Suddenly, the DOOR SLAMS behind them and RAY holds a gun
to Phil's head, DORA nervously next to him.
RAY
Talk! Who are you?
PHIL
You know, that's like the 5th gun I've
had to my head tonight! Just lower that
thing and cool it, OK?
Off guard from Phil's reaction, Ray, confused, does.
DORA
She was in the bathroom at the
restaurant!
RAY
Who are you?
PHIL
Who are we? Good question! Well,
everybody thinks we're "the Gales"
because we were lucky enough to take your
reservation tonight!
RAY
(CONFUSED)
What? Why would you take our
reservation?
Phil shoots Clara a look.
CLARE
Don't.
RAY
Both of you. Stand ov there in the
corner. Dammit Dora, ere's your
goddamn brother? He was E,.--,-Dc.-zed to b
here an hour ago!
I don't know, Ra_, He's not answering
his phone.
RAY
Yeah, well, if these guys found u
long do you think it's gonna take
other guys? We're dead! DEAD!
72.
E
CLARA
Excuse me.
In the corner, Clara raises her hand. Ray eyes her
strangely.
CLARA (CONT'D)
Sorry. I have to pee.
RAY
(FLUSTERED)
You have to nee?
Clara nods. Phil shrugs.
PHIL
That's my wife.
Flustered, Ray waves Dora to take Clara.
The conjoined cars sail across the
grass and SMASH
THROUGH a barrier, landing on the MCCORMICK ICE RINK.
Their cars PINWHEEL OUT OF CONTROL across the ice. Phil,
Clara, and the Black Dude are all WIDE EYED as the world
is a SPINNING BLUR around them.
Finally, they hit the other side. Getting his bearings,
Phil sees the Towncar has entered the park after them.
He searches where to go next, then spots something.
PHIL
Clara! Reverse it, keep it straight
put your foot to the floor. Give it
everything!
Clara reverses and Phil puts the car in drive and floors
it. The car goes faster... faster...
BLACK
Oooh. I really woulc_n.'t be doing that.
CLARA
Doing what? What are you doing?!?
Clara glances over her shoulder. Their heading strai
toward a CONCRETE STAIRWAY.
CL. (CONT'D)
Oh God.
0
80.
11
PHIL
Just trust me!
The conjoined cars HIT the steps and their wheels SMOKE
as the TWO ENGINES POWER TOGETHER ALL THE WAY UP THE
STAIRWAY!
The Towncar tries the follow them, but its single engine
doesn't have enough power. Swearing under his breath,
Frank reverses back down the steps.
Phil and the Black Guy both look back over their
shoulders as they speed by Anish Kapoor's large metallic
CLOUD GATE. No sign of the Towncar. The Black Guy holds
up his hand for Phil.
BLACK DUDE
Ha HA! That last move was wicked, man.
Wicked.
They try to give each other a fancy handshake, but Phil,
the WHITEST MAN EVER, muddles it up.
PHIL
 Sorry.
BLACK DUDE
s cool.
CLARA
(SPOTTING SOMETHING)
They're back.
They peek again over their shoulders. The Towncar's
driven around and is now BACK ON THEIR TAILS.
BLACK DUDE
Jesus! What the hell are you guys in
trouble for?
'D R
(SIGHS)
f i ght... you name it.
Phil and Clara's conjoined cars barrel across the gr ss
of the Great Lawn in Millennium park, then SPIN onto
Columbus Drive, the Towncar giving chase.
81
Phil peeks back over his shoulder then sighs, looking at
Clara.
PHIL
Can we just try to work together at this?
CLARA
PHIL-
PHIL
I'm not blaming you. Please?
Clara nods.
PHIL (CONT'D)
Now whatever direction I give you, take
your normal version of it and tone it
down like 85 percent, OK?
CLARA
35 percent. Fine.
PHIL
OK. Small left. Now!
E
Clara breathes deeply and turns her wheel slightly lefts
They ZOOM around the corner.
PHIL (CONT'D)
(LOOKING BACK)
Yes! That was awesome! Perfect, Clara!
Now give me a medium right. Do it!
She does and they veer sharply and perfectly onto another
street.
CLAA
Yes!

Now we're cooking with fire!
Now tiny le

(HAVING FUN)
You act it!
They make the slightest turn.

PHIL
Yes!
(spotting something ahead)
No.
BLACK DUDE
Oh no.
CLARA
What?
Clara turns around to look. LIGHTS FLASH as a BARRIER
comes down across the road - A DRAWBRIDGE ahead is slowly
rising.
Phil looks behind - the Towncar's got them closed in.
The Black Dude peeks back as well, then turns to Phil.
BLACK DUDE
say we can pop you guys up and over.
PHIL
H
CLARA
Excuse me? What are you talking about,
"pop you guys up and over?"
E
BLACK DUDE
You climb over, then we both reverse it
and leadfoot the motherfuckers. Send you
flying over the top.
CLARA
What?
Sucking in a breath, Phil hands control of the car back
to the Black Dude. As the conjoined cars zoom toward the
drawbridge, Phil CRAWLS ON THE ATTACHED HOODS FROM ONE
WINDSHIELD TO THE OTHER, sitting next to Clara.
CLARA (CONT'D)
Phil, don't even think of it.
PHIL
can do it. Clara.
CLARA
No, Phil. We can't! It's suicide!
BLACK DUDE
Here we go now... One... two... THREE!
CLARA
NO!
83.
But Phil reaches over and switches the gear to reverse,
stepping on Clara's foot to GUN IT.
CLARA (CONT'D)
AHHHH!
The two cars SMOKE as their wheels spin in opposite
directions, then DISLODGE. Phil and Clara's car flies
reverse UP ONE SIDE OF THE DIAGONAL DRAWBRIDGE...
.and LANDS SPINNING IN A FLURRY OF SPARKS OVER ON THE
OTHER SIDE, causing AIR BAGS to deploy all around Phil
and Clara.
The Black Dude spins his steering wheel, jack-knifing his
Honda across the road, and PUTS ON HIS SEAT BELT. Frank
and Harry's eyes go wide as Frank jams on his brakes, but
the Towncar CRASHES right into the Honda.
ugh his broken window, the Black Dude grins at Frank
and Harry.
BLACK DUDE
Hope you all got insurance.
Hitting a button, he starts a FIBER-OPTIC LIGHT SHOW on
his Honda.
U
Phil rushes after Clara, trying to catch up.
Where are you going?
CLARA
I want to make sure that at least one
our son's parents survives tonight!
PHIL
What?
0
84.
CLARA
You almost just got us killed!
PHIL
I see. I almost got us killed. Forget
about the people chasing and shooting at
us all night long because of the
reservation you stole.
CLARA
There's a difference between fleeing from
people shooting at you and knowingly
driving a car in reverse over an open
drawbridge!
PHIL
Unbelievable! You know, all you complain
about is that I don't take risks anymore.
Then the second I do, you get mad at me
for doing it! I can't win with you!
CLARA
Poor Phil! You have i so bad, don't
you!
PHIL
Oh, you have no idea! Every single day
from the moment we wake up you're bossy,
 disapproving, inconsiderate-
CLARA
I'm inconsiderate? I'M INCONSIDERATE?!?
Have you ever seen our bathroom in the
morning after Tsunami Phil's blown
through? The floor! The sink! You use
my toothbrush.
PHIL
What's the difference? Afraid you're
gonna get my cooties?
CLARA
I want my own toothbrush, Phil! Sue me!
And how many years have I asked you to do
a simple thing like put the toilet paper
in right?
PHIL
Listen to yourself! You have problems
with how I pqt in the toilet paper!
C
Because under makes no sense, Phil!
Under makes no sense! When it's under it
doesn't pull off right! It just keeps
spinning and spinning and doesn't cascade
properly!
(MORE)
85.
CLARA (CONTVD)
After ten years of asking you to have
roll the right way, you still can't do
it!
PHIL
Yeah, how about the fact that I have not
woken up with our comforter over me once
in those 10 nears! You steal the whole
thing away from me every night and
mummify yourself.
CLARA
What? Phil, I do not "steal" the
comforter. It just happens when we're-
PHIL
(points at her)
Bulls Bull-shit.
CLARA
Don't you point that at me!
PHIL
I see your hock leg lock maneuver. Don't
think I don't!
(ILLUSTRATING)
You wrap that leg around and lock the
comforter down then reeeeel it in so I
can't pull it at all.

CLARA
I do not leg lock the comforter!
PHIL
Oh yes you do!
CLARA
u think I don't know your little
icks? Where you leave like half a
thimble of milk in the carton and put it
back in the fridge so you don't have to
be the one to "finish" it and replace it?
PHIL
You're right. I do that. You know why
do that, Clara?
CLARA
Because you don't want to haul your
ass to the market to buy it yourself!
PHIL
Because I'm afraid to! God forbid I
the wrong kind of grass-fed bio
homogenized whatever and meet your wrath!
You're like the Nutrition Nazi.
(MORE)
11
86.
PHIL (CONT' D )
And I've got to be your little Nutrition
Nazi Goebbels because we have to be this
"united front" with Ollie! What's wrong
if he eats two bowls of Captain Sugar
instead of one? Or if his handwriting
isn't perfect? Or if he goes to school
for one day not dressed like Finneas J.
Nerdo!
CLARA
Poor Phil. I feel so sorry for you. I
must be hard having to be the cool fun
parent while I get to be the one who
makes sure our child's fed, clothed and
SURVIVES!
PHIL
How would you even know? You don't give
me or anyone else a chance! You're so
goddamn controlling! You've got to be
Wonder Woman, keeping everyone in line,
looking down on them from her fancy
Wonder Woman plane and controlling
everything with all her wonder
superpowers! You paint yourself as this
victim but you get off on being the
superlady!
CLARA
Urgh! You know w sometimes I don't pay
attention to you, Phil? Because you give
me a headache!
Clara angrily rummages through her purse then lets out a
frustrated sigh.
PHIL
What? No aspirin in the wonderpurse?
How could it be?
Clara, furious, HURLS her purse at Phil's head. He ducks
and the contents spill all over the road.
CLARA
Screw you, Phil!
PHIL
Yeah, fine! Sure! Screw me ! Even if I
survive tonight I'm screwed all around
anyway! Screwed with you! Screwed with
my job!
CLARA
What are you talking about, screwed with
your job?
87.
11
PHIL
was supposed to spend all tonight
guring out a new brilliant plan for the
fund so George wouldn't take it over
tomorrow. Doesn't look like that's gonna
happen!
CLARA
Why didn't you tell me?
PHIL
I don't know, Clara. Maybe because I
didn't want you chiming in on how Mr.
Rivers was right. He wants the new guy
for all the reasons you complain about
me! Someone who doesn't "play it safe."
Someone who'll "take a risk."
CLARA
I can't believe that's what you think
do.
PHI
Yeah, well...
(BEAT)
You know, when you set up this whole
"magical" night, in that dress... I got
this glimmer that it was going to be like
it used to be with us. But... I don't
know. I guess we're just not those
people anymore.
CLARA
(BEAT)
I guess we're not.
Shaking his head, Phil turns and walks away do-- the
street. Clara, trying to hold it together, h
and starts to gather the items from her purse
something catches his eye. She picks up the
ENVELOPE that Dora put in her bag.
As Phil walks along, Clara comes running up behind him.
Phil! Phil!
She steps in front of him, trying to catch her breath.
PHIL
I think we said all needs to be said
right now, Clara.
Panting, Clara holds out the manila envelope.
88.
E
CLARA
This... this... this...
PHIL
What?
CLARA
(PANTING)
Side cramp... Wow.
She hands Phil the manila envelope and bends down, trying
to stop her cramp. Confused, Phil opens it and looks at
the pictures inside. His brow furrows.
PHIL
What is it?
Clara looks over his shoulder, shakes her head and TURNS
THE PICTURE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. Phil's eyes go wide.
PHIL (CONT'D)
Oh jeez. It's... it's...
C
It's the Mayor.
Phil looks at Clara, taking it all in.
PHIL (V.0.)
I bet this didn't have anything to do
with Stockton at first.
Phil and Clara walk quickly down the street as they piece
things together.
PHIL
The Mayor must have gone to Stockton's
club one night. He saw Dora working
there and obviously gave some sign that
he was interested.
CLARA
So much for "Mr. Squeaky Clea
PHIL
Her sleazy boyfriend Ray finds out and
convinces her to take him up on it so
they could photograph it and blackmail
him.
CLARA
They knew it was an election year and he
would have to pay them whatever they
asked.
89.
PHIL
But somehow Stockton found out about the
photos too and wanted that power over the
mayor himself.
CLARA
So he sent his guys to the restaurant to
intercept the Gales and get the photos.
PHIL
But Ray and Dora spotted them and bailed
before the Mayor even had a chance to
show up.
Phil thinks. He snaps his fingers.
CLARA
What?
PHIL
If we could find some way to get in touch
with the mayor directly, without anyone
else knowing, there actually might be a
way out of this for us.
Clara thinks for a moment. A light comes to her eyes.
CLARA
can.
DOORMAN BUILDING - LATER THAT NIGHT
Phil and Clara walk into the lobby of the doorman
building and start toward the elevator, straight past the
NIGHT DOORMAN.
DOORMAN
Whoa whoa whoa. Where do you
you're going?
CLARA
Oh, we're guests of Apartment 605
The Doorman picks up the phone to call the apartmen
DOORMAN
And you are?
looks at him in shock.
CLARA
Are you crazy? It's 4 in the morning!
We were lust out for dinner. Trust me
90.

DOORMAN
I'm not really allowed to just let you up
there.
CLARA
Please. Just look at us!
The Doorman looks at Phil and Clara - a white, well
dressed suburban couple.
DOORMAN
OK. Yeah. Go ahead.
The elevator door opens and they get inside.
PHIL
Have a nice night.
DOORMAN
You too.
ELEVATOR
As the elevator doors close, Phil and Clara look at each
other, then simultaneously slip PAPER BAGS with EYE and
MOUTH HOLES over their heads.
Phil and Clara meet the Mayor at the bottom of the steps.
Clara takes the manila envelope out of her purse, handing
it to him.
PHIL
This is what you're looking for. I've
tten down our information inside.
MAYOR DIGGS
And that's it?
PHIL
That's it. We're going home now.
The Mayor nods, and Phil and Clara start walking past him
toward the parking lot. Mayor Diggs stays behind,
nervously tapping the envelope in his hand.
As Phil and Clara get halfway to the lot, ALL THE MAYOR'S
CAR DOORS OPEN, and Manning, Frank, Harry, and Mr.
Stockton climb out. Frank and Harry pop the trunk and
grab SHEETS OF CLEAR PLASTIC. Phil's eyes go wide.
PHIL (CONT'D)
Oh God. Run, Clara!
Phil and Clara start to run, when a GUNSHOT hits the
ground in front of them. They turn, when ANOTHER SHOT
rings out.
LIEUTENANT MANNING
The next one won't be a warning shot.
They look over to see Manning training a gun as he and
Stockton walk toward them, Harry and Frank behind with
the plastic.
MR. STOCKTON
(to Harry and Frank
Let's do it over there.
y and Frank quickly throw the plastic sheets down on
the grass nearby.
MAYOR DIGGS
I'm going to wait in the c r
don't mind.
MR. STOCKTON
Sure thing, Mr. Mayor.
E
As Mayor Diggs starts to walk back to the parking lot, he
opens the manila envelope. Manning gestures for Phil and
Clara to walk to the plastic sheets.
PHIL
Please. Please don't do
LIEUTENANT MANNING
Over there.
PHIL
Please! We have a child!
'VT MINING
said over there!
J PH I L
(BEGGING)
Just me then, OK? I promise you she's
not going to say anything! Please! We
have a child!
LIEUTENANT MANNING
Last time I'm going to say it.
Resigned, Phil and Clara sadly look at each other, then
walk to stand in front of the plastic on the ground.
11
LIEUTENANT MANNING
(CONT'D)
On your knees.
Phil, scared, holds out his hand to Clara. She takes
looking back at him and they kneel in front of the
plastic, side by side.
Mr. Stockton nods to Lieutenant Manning, who checks his
gun.
M A Y O R DIG GS (O . S . )
WHAT THE
Mr. Stockton and Lieutenant inning turn. Mayor Diggs
sifts through pages of DOCJ J:TTS that were in t h ''w Wila
Envelope.
PHIL
-eally were planning to give you the
pictures, Mr. Mayor. That is, until you
-.sre so casual about is not needing to
worry about the cop who was after us.
That made me a little suspicious because
I never told you which cop it was.
CLARA
Then we got to talking and realized how
dumb we were.
(MORE)
102.
CLARA (CONT'D)
E If you came on to some waitress at the
Rainbow, you must have felt pretty darn
comfortable there.
PHIL
Which meant Stockton was probably your
buddy.
MR. STOCKTON
Where are the pictures?
PHIL
But we were still confused, because if
you guys are buddies, how do you explain
the Falconwood Corporation?
Mr. Stockton's face blanches.
MR. STOCKTON
They're obviously not going to tell us!
Just shoot them!
MAYOR DIGGS
Wait. I've heard that name. What's the
Falconwood Corporation?
PHIL
Runs the hiring of inspectors for the
Department of Highways in Chicago. You

know, the ones who have been finding all
those violations?
MR. STOCKTON
Manning! I said shoot them!
LIEUTENANT MANNING
I work for the Mayor, Terrence.
MAYOR DIGGS
Why do you keep interrupting, Terrence?
PHIL
Maybe because according to the paperwork
you've got there, he owns Falconwood.
CLARA
Not only that, you'll see those other
pages that he also owns a cc=rpany called
Eurostruct - which rents the city all of
its construction equipment.
MR. STOCKTON
Frank, Harry!
Frank and Harry reach for their guns, but Manning turns
his gun on them.
E
103.
PHIL
The more violations Falconwood finds, the
longer Eurostruct rents the equipment.
That turns into big bucks, Mr. Mayor.
I'm sure that's not a moral problem for
you, but he's kind of screwing you in an
election year, isn't he? Some of us are
pretty pissed off about the roads.
Mayor Diggs flips through the documents, taking it all
MAYOR DIGGS
You did this to me? I don't get it,
Terrence. Why? How much do you need? I
have the Lieutenant here watch your back
on all of your gambling clubs-
MR. STOCKTON
Oh, do you mean the ones that you gamble
at? Where I cover your debts? Those
clubs?
MAYOR DIGGS
I slipped your company 5 no-bid
foreclosed buildings for a dollar each
downtown.
MR. STOCKTON 
You think that pays for what I do for
you? The girls I have to pay off? The
jet charters? And let's not even get
into your "re-election fund"! Let's not
even go there!
PHIL
( `TIKES HEAD)
Listen to them.
Stockton angrily pulls his own the gun out of his jacket
pocket, shoving it against the back of Phil's neck.
MR. STOCKTON
How did you get this? How?
HOLBROOKE (O.S.)
Tha be from me.
Mr. Stockton and others turn around to see HOLBROOKE
P_IF SON, brandi= --.g his gun and looking like the FBI

STEPS.
HOLEROOK E (CONT ' D )
FBI! Drop it!
104.
Manning tried to object, pulling out his bad
HOLBROOKE (CONT'D)
Yeah, yeah. I know all about you, buddy.
With a smile Phil and Clara get up, disconnecting the
WIRES under their clothing. Seeing them hand over the
wires to Holbrooke, it hits Mayor Diggs what he's just
revealed.
MAYOR DIGGS
Aw fuck.
PHIL
(SHRUGS)
Makes you feel any better, I wasn't gonna
vote for you anyway.
CLARA
either.
As Holbrooke drops Phil and Clara off in front of their
house, his BLACKBERRY buzzes and he checks it.
 CLARA
Everything OK?
HOLBROOKE
Yeah. They just need me downtown in half
an hour for a news conference with the
Deputy Mayor. Want it for the morning
shows.
PHIL
Don't think they're going to be calling
you the IT guy any-more.
HOLBROOKE
Listen guys, I feel weird about not even
acknowledging you two.
CLARA
Don't.
HOLBROOKE
But you should be up there with me. You
handed this whole case to me.
PHIL
(smiles, winks)
Yeah, well-, that's how we roll.
They get out of the car and start up the driveway.

105.

As Clara opens the front door, Phil slowly bends down,
picking up the morning paper.
CHAZ (O.S.)
Hey hey! Up bright and early, aren
Phil looks over to see his overly cheery neighbor Chaz in
his jogging suit. He smiles, appreciating Chaz for the
first time.
PHIL
Yep. We sure are.
As he joins Clara on the doorstep, they take each other
in.
CLARA
You have your presentation in a few
hours.
PHIL
(SHRUGS)
Yeah. You know, I think I'm gonna be OK.
CLARA

I had a good time tonight.
PHIL
Yeah. Me too. It was fun.
CLARA
It was.
PHIL
So... let's do this again sometime?
CLARA
(SMILE)
like that.
For the first time the whole night, THEY KISS.
Interlocking fingers, they head inside, closing their
front door behind them.
FACE OUT.
