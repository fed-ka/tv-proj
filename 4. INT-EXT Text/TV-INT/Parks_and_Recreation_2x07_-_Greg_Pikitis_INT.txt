                 Safe Halloween  PSA, take one.
                      (to cameras)
                Hey, kids!  The Parks Department wants 
                you to have fun on Halloween.  But we 
                also believe that  trick or treat  
                doesn t have to mean  sick or hurt. 
                      (trying to make it rhyme)
                 Sick or hur-eeet.   Rhymes with 
                 treat.   Okay.  Let s watch this skit 
                I ve written, and copyrighted, about 
                  Halloween safety.

      JERRY, APRIL, and TOM walk on stage.  Tom and April are 
      playing trick-or-treaters, Leslie is their mom. 

                                TOM
                 Hey, Diane.  Don t you love 
                  Halloween, especially when we act 
                  responsibly? 

                                APRIL
                 Yes, Jeremy.  I do. 

                                LESLIE
                 Okay, kids.  Just one more house, and 
                then it s time to go home. 

      Tom realizes something.  Looks at Leslie.

                                TOM
                Mommy?  Why do I look so different 
                from you?  And my sister? 

                                LESLIE

                I can t when I m so confused about who 
                I am.  I need my backstory, for the 
                  character of  Jeremy.

                Trick or treat.

                                JERRY
                Hello, kids!  Do you want some candy?

                                APRIL
                No.  I m too sad.  I just found out my 
                dad is dead.

                                JERRY
                      (at a loss)
                ...Okay.  Well.  Here s some candy.

      He hands them a CANDY BAR with a GIANT BLADE sticking out of 
      it.  Tom has clearly never seen this prop before and LAUGHS.

                                TOM
                Whoa!  What s up, Creepsville?  Did 
                you lose your machete?  Because 
                there s a machete sticking out of this 
                Kit Kat.

                What are you talking about, Jeremy?  I 
                don t see anything wrong with that.  
                I m going to eat it.

      Leslie stands in the hallway, arms folded, calmly looking for 
      someone as KIDS filter past her.  Suddenly she sees him: GREG 
      PIKITIS.  16.  Ultra-cocky.  Leslie s worst nightmare.

                                LESLIE
                Greg Pikitis.

      He looks over, smirks, walks up to her.  He s eating a PEACH.

                                GREG
                You re the Parks lady, right?

                                GREG

                I don t know what you re talking about.

                I think you do.  It ends today,

      She walks off.  

                                GREG
                Thanks for dropping by, Leslie.  You 
                look great.

                I know it s Greg Pikitis, but I can 
                never prove it.  He s like an 
                  invisible, adolescent, James Bond 
                  supervillain criminal mastermind.

      There are a few more PEOPLE in the house, but the party is 
      pretty quiet.  LAME HALLOWEEN SONGS are still playing.

      APRIL, DEREK, and BEN enter.  She s a HAPPY CLOWN with a big 
      smiley face.  Ben is also a PIRATE, but it s WAY MORE 
      ELABORATE than Ron s costume.  Derek is wearing a button-down 
      shirt and tan pants.

                I did.  I m a straight person.

      MARK enters holding a bag with his costume in it.  He s 
      wearing exactly the same outfit as Derek.

                whole house, and everyone just hangs 
                out in the kitchen.  Why do people 
                always just hang out in the kitchen?!

      In the b.g. we see that literally everyone is in the kitchen.

                nurses and doctors are just dressed as 
                nurses and doctors.  That s so lame.

      Camera sees, in the kitchen, a bunch of NURSES and DOCTORS in 
      their usual work gear.

                Ann, do you have any Mounds?  All I

                                GREG
                What is this?  I kinda like it.

                                LESLIE
                Damnit.
                      (to herself)
                Why do you have to be so good, Sarah?

      Leslie stops the music.  SMACKS the peach pit down.

                                GREG
                What s that?

                                LESLIE
                You know what it is.  You were eating 
                a peach when I saw you today at the 
                school.  Then my office gets 
                  vandalized, and I find this on my 
                desk?  You think that s a coincidence?

                                GREG
                Wow, you nailed me.  There s no way two 
                  different people could have both eaten 
                fruit on the same day, in the same part 
                of Indiana.  Never mind that I was 
                actually eating a plum when you saw me.

      Leslie hesitates.  She looks unsure.  Then:

                                LESLIE
                      (angry)
                I know you did this.  I don t care 
                what you say.  I don t care that you 
                spent the whole night in that parking 
                lot.  You did this, somehow, and I m--

                                GREG
                How did you know that?

                                GREG
                That I spent the whole night in that 
                parking lot?  Did you follow me?

                                GREG
                If you followed me all night then you

      Greg gets out his phone and dials.

                Fine.  You get one phone call.  That s 
                fair.

                  Department is holding me hostage.

      Leslie looks worried.


      Dave, Leslie, Andy.

                She s going to be here any second!

      Dave looks over -- camera WHIPS to see DEBORAH, Greg s mom, 
      striding angrily into the room.

      Leslie, Dave, and Andy walk out of Leslie s office and 
      intercept Deborah.  Greg comes out of the conference room.

                don t know how you landed that chick, 
                but nice work.  She s awesome.  You re 
                really lucky. 

      Tom looks a tiny bit sad as Wendy comes up.

                You, too!  Thanks for everything.

                Thanks.  The thing that s driving me 
                nuts is, how did he do it?

      Greg TP s the office, SPRAY-PAINTS on the wall, and DRAWS 
      MOUSTACHES on Leslie s pictures.  Then he LEAVES THE PEACH 
      PIT on her desk.

                Does he have a look-a-like, or 
                  something?
