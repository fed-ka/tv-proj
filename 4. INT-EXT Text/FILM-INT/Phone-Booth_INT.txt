PHONE BOOTH
ANGLE ON DANGLING RECEIVER
as it sways back and forth.
From it, we hear the voice.
VOICE
Thanks for such an interesting
afternoon.
THEN THERE ARE OTHER SOUNDS EMANATING FROM THE DANGLING
SWAYING PHONE.
A wooden door being battered open.
A few incomprehensible
shouts as a SWAT TEAM dashes in.
Stu's stalling for time has
paid off.
THE SOUND OF A BARRAGE OF GUNFIRE.
THE SOUND OF A MUFFLED SCREAM.
The police have broken in on Stu's tormentor and there has
been a rapid exchange of shots.
A HAND reaches into the booth and grabs the receiver.
ANGLE WIDENS as Ramey places it to his ear.
RAMEY
Hello?
This is Captain Ramey.
Somebody talk to me.
SWAT OFFICER'S VOICE
Yeah.
We took him out, Captain.
Nobody else got hurt.
RAMEY
What's his condition?
SWAT OFFICER'S VOICE
Critical.
The sonofabitch took
two.
Probably won't survive the
ride.
RAMEY
Get a statement from him.
I'll be
right over.
He drops the receiver so that it dangles again.
CAMERA FOLLOWS RAMEY to where Stu lies surrounded by cops and
medics.
He's stunned, but very much alive.
MEDIC
Don't try to sit up.
STU
What was that?
RAMEY
(kneeling)
Rubber bullet.
MEDIC
You'll have one hell of a nasty
welt.
Busted rib.
Maybe a
permanent scar there.
STU
It couldn't hurt much more if you
really shot me.
RAMEY
Somebody was going to and we
thought it may as well be us.
STU
Did you get him?
RAMEY
Sure as hell did.
Thanks to you.
STU
Still alive?
RAMEY
Barely.
MEDIC
We'll be giving him a hypo for the
pain.
It'll put him out for a
while.
Kelly is now brought over by a female cop.
She drops to her
knees beside Stu and tries to embrace him.
The medics
restrain her.
STU
It's okay.
I'm not really shot.
KELLY
I was so afraid.
I thought...
STU
I thought so, too.
But we're going
to be alright.
Both of us.
KELLY
Remember how you swore up and down
you'd get me on TV?
Well, you did.
I already got interviewed on Fox
and Channel Eleven and they even
want me on A.M. America tomorrow
morning.
STU
Bet you didn't think I could
deliver on that.
MEDIC
Will you please let go of him,
Miss?
A gurney is wheeled over from a police ambulance.
The medic
is about to administer the hypo but Stu pushes him away.
STU
No.
No hypo.
I want to see him
first.
The medics are now ready to lift Stu onto the gurney and cart
him off.
But Stu struggles against them.
RAMEY
Relax.
The guy's dying.
STU
That's why I've gotta talk to him.
Please!
RAMEY
We'll see.
MEDIC
(to Kelly)
You can ride with him in the
ambulance.
The woman cop escorts Kelly to the waiting ambulance.
Ramey meanwhile tries to resume contact with the SWAT team
inside the hotel.
RAMEY
This is Ramey.
Over.
This is
Ramey.
Ten-Four.
There's nothing but static, mixed up feedback and multiple
garbled voices on the other end of the line.
RAMEY
Shit.
Get everybody off this
wavelength.
He crosses back to the phone booth -- picks up the dangling
receiver.
RAMEY
Hello.
Hello!
Pick up!
Yeah,
it's Ramey again.
Can you hold the
phone close enough so the perp can
listen?
COP'S VOICE
He's not saying a word, Captain.
RAMEY
He's not about to talk to us.
Maybe to him.
Ramey looks back to where the medics are still trying to lift
Stu onto the gurney.
RAMEY
Forget that.
Stand him up.
(to Stu)
Can you stand?
STU
I can try.
RAMEY
Help him over here.
The medics support Stu and inch him back to the booth.
It's
painful, but Stu ignores it.
Ramey holds the phone up so Stu can both listen and speak.
RAMEY
Here.
Speak up.
STU
(into pay phone)
It's me.
Do you hear me?
Answer
me.
VOICE
(wheezing)
Had to have the last word, Stu.
STU
I finally beat your ass.
Admit it,
you fuck.
VOICE
But you'll never forget me.
I gave
you the most thrilling day of your
life.
Say thanks.
STU
Now you're gonna die, you bastard.
VOICE
I lost a lot of blood.
Don't you
want to donate some for me?
Then
we'd really be part of each other.
STU
Hang on.
I can't wait to see you
at the hospital.
So I can yank
your fucking air tube out.
VOICE
Wish I could give you that
pleasure.
You deserve it.
(coughing)
... Only I'm out of time.
STU
What's your name?
At least tell me
who you are.
There's more violent coughing, then silence.
Then a cop's
voice is heard.
COP'S VOICE
He's gone.
Stu stares at the receiver.
RAMEY
Don't worry.
We'll find out who he
is.
And why he picked you.
STU
No.
You won't.
(a beat)
What do you want to bet you won't?
Stu reaches over and hangs up the receiver.
CLICK.
STU
I'll spend my whole life trying to
figure that out.
Then he sinks into the arms of the medics who lower him onto
the waiting gurney.
The hypo is finally administered.
It kicks in immediately,
relieving the pain.
He's wheeled away from the booth to the waiting ambulance.
Kelly is already inside waiting to accompany Stu to the
hospital.
STU'S POV - BEING WHEELED AWAY FROM THE EMPTY BOOTH
pulling away in LOW ANGLE.
CAMERA SLIDES BACK inside the ambulance with Stu.
The doors
shut, obliterating our view of the phone booth that was his
entire world until moments ago.
STU
(groggy)
Gotta sleep now.
No phone calls...
Kelly smiles down at him as the image blurs.
Stu passes out
-- into a deep sleep he much deserves.
A SIREN BLARES.
CUT TO BLACK.
