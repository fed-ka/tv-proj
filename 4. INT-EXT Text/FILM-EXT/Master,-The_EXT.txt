Freddie walks into the alley, stuffing some money in his
pockets - he's followed by a FIGURE. FREDDIE realizes,
stops, SPINS AROUND AND PULLS KNIFE:
FREDDIE
You come any closer and I'll slice your
GUT -
FIGURE
I'm not after your dough, I just want to
talk with you -
FREDDIE
You can talk standing in front of the
restaurant, around the corner --
At that moment, TWO OTHER MEN come out of the shadows and
JUMP FREDDIE, KNOCK HIM AROUND, TAKE HIS MONEY AND LEAVE.
He's left a little bloody, messy, no money in the alley.
CUT TO:
They exit, move away from each other, both drunk..
CUT TO:
LATER. off the side of the highway. Freddie collects
himself, obviously running for the past hour and evading
the Filipino's.
He hitches now...
CUT TO:
Inside the crowded HIRING HALL, sailors, men looking for
work, etc. Freddie puts his name down. This is a short
burst of a scene, establish he wants to get back to sea,
wants work, but there's nothing for a few weeks.
VARIOUS ANGLES. Freddie makes his way around the docks,
looking for something/anything. PLAY OUT.
He comes across a SHIP that's being readied for voyage.
It's an old cattle TRAWLER that seems converted to some
kind of CRUISE SHIP/PRIVATE YACHT-type vessel.
There's a buzz of getting ready around the ship also a
minor cocktail party in progress. (light music playing
from the ship...) DECKHANDS preparing to ship out, etc...
Freddie approaches the gang-plank...no one is there to
guard it. He walks straight up the gang plank and gets on
board the ship.
ANGLE, ON BOARD.
CAMERA follows him around... no one seems to notice or
care...
He goes down below...
ANGLE, BELOW DECK.
He sneaks around... some YOUNG MEN are getting dressed in
TUXEDOS.
11.
This plays itself out...FREDDIE finds a small CLOSET with
a TUXEDO and slips it on. He gets swallowed up into this
group of young men and acts as if he belongs --
.THE SHIP PULLS AWAY. HEADING OUT SAN FRANCISCO BAY...
.FREDDIE HEADING UP INTO A WELL APPOINTED CABIN...
A COCKTAIL PARTY IS IN FULL SWING AS THE SHIP LEAVES S.F.
There are all manner of people here, in this area,
everyone seems quite happy, chatty. Middle aged couples,
single middle-aged men, young couples, some kids,
teenagers, etc.
Freddie working near the bar, starts delivering drinks...
A live PIANO TRIO playing. FREDDIE NOTICES:
A LARGE MAN IN HIS MID-40s, all red-hair, red eyebrows,
red lips sings and dances while holding a baby It's a
bit blurry across the room from Freddie's POV
The SONG ENDS and everyone laughs, applauds, collapses.
KIDS run around...
CUT TO:
FREDDIE is dragged by to ASSISTANTS down the narrow
hallways of the SHIP. . .down another hallway, down
another...
CUT TO:
CAMERA MOVES WITH THE SHIP, SILENTLY MOVING ALONG AT
NIGHT.. .SEES THE LIGHTS GLOW FROM INSIDE...
CUT TO:

MASTER

FREDDIE
Oh yeah?
MASTER
It will come out over time, but yes. We
are re-united... do you reember me?
24.
FREDDIE
.I don't know...
MASTER
That's alright. Don't strain yourself.
You will. There will be much time to
discuss this on the journey to our
destination. As we travel down Time-
Holes...you won't be afraid will you?
FREDDIE
.what destination?
MASTER
Have you ever had harm cme to you?
FREDDIE
Sure.
MASTER
What if we could return to a period of
your life where there was harm and do
away with it? .would You like that?
FREDDIE
Ok.
MASTER
That's where we go.
They come across ALL THE PEOPLE ON BOARD. THEY WALK INTO
THE GROUP. Everyone is getting ready for a WEDDING. . .they
greet MASTER and FREDDIE. He walks into it and is
welcome'd...
MASTER finds his daughter, ELIZABETH, who is to be
married and her husband-to-be CLARK (20s) He introduces
them to Freddie -
ZOOM BACK FROM CU. On MASTER as he presides over his
DAUGHTER's WEDDING. ELIZABETH and CLARK. Everyone dressed

this life: you may kiss the bride.
THEY KISS. APPLAUSE, CHEERS. CU. FREDDIE. He listens and
watches.
CUT TO:

FREDDIE moves around, CAMERA follows him, collecting
VARIOUS SUPPLIES to start making a home-made potion of
booze. POTATOES, PAINT THINNER, ORANGES, YEAST. (TBD,
OTHER CONTENTS OF THE SHIP) that could go into a recipe --

CUT TO:
The SHIP HAS ARRIVED AND DOCKED. Everyone is rounding up
to disembark. Those leaving: MASTER, MARY SUE, ELIZABETH,
CLARK, THE BABIES, NANNIES, VAL AND FREDDIE. They all
head down the gang-way...
The New York City franchise owner/follower is a thin,
sickly man named: BILL WHITE (40s) He's very
nervous/anxious/eager to please, comes to greet them.
He's here with some other ASSOCIATES/FOLLOWERS:
BILL WHITE
Master! Hello. Yes. Welcome. Welcome back
to New York City, Master. It's our honor,
its our pleasure. We are humble and so
happy...
MASTER
Thank you, Bill, good to see you.
BILL leads the way, waves his hand to the show:
BILL WHITE
We'd like to present you with this gift
from the New York Branch for your stay
here ...we know how fond you are of
motorcycles.
He presents a HARLEY-DAVIDSON..
MASTER
Loooooooooook at that... 1940 Harley
Davidson Knucklehead. For me?
47.
He slides on, starts it up, everyone APPLAUDS. MASTER
TEARS AWAY ON THE MOTORCYCLE, everyone else [piles into
some OLD SEDAN'S driven by some New York Followers --
Everyone on deck of the ship waves good-bye and watches
them go.
CUT TO:
MASTER and everyone comes in to the hotel/ballroom of a
fading mid-town hotel. Local students, followers are here
to greet ... about THIRTY people...
FREDDIE looks at the GIRLS. MASTER shakes hands, kisses
babies, etc...
BOOKS FOR SALE, DESKS, PARTITIONS, PAMPHLETS, REEL TO
REEL TAPE'S FOR SALE. BILL WHITE doing all the intro's,
liason work, etc... (note: Helen Sullivan here.) This
operation embryonic a little shabby...
CUT TO:
INT UPSTAIRS/HOTEL. LATER.
Everyone here, a FLOOR of the hotel has been taken over,
adjoining rooms connecting everyone... CAMERA moves
around, seeing all the activity, movement-the ADULTS are
getting dressed and ready for something ... . FREDDIE
brings MASTER some booze. They cheers, drink ... MASTER
gets ready.."to past, present, future and the street
where they all meet and shake hands."
CUT TO:
A very fancy APARTMENT ON THE PARK. The whole entourage
pulls up. MASTER on the Harley, everyone else in the
sedans..they head into a PARK AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDING;
CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM ALL IN. THE DOORMAN looks up;
BILL WHITE is quick to explain they're going to the
Penthouse to the party of Mrs. Purcell, etc..
48.
BILL WHITE
Make way, make way..thank you.
CUT TO:
They're leaving. Master gets on his Harley and peels off
into the night. . .HOLD THE SHOT - everyone else gets into
their SEDANS. . .up ahead, MASTER WIPES OUT, lays the bike
down in the middle of Park Avenue...
57.
.he leaves it, the SEDANS pull up, he gets in. An AID
goes to the bike and picks it up.
FREDDIE and CLARK, walking down the street... They
WALK/TALK;
FREDDIE
Where are you from, Clark?
CLARK
Los Angeles. Pasadena.
FREDDIE
What's there?
59.
CLARK
I'm from there. Master and headquarters
there for a year.
FREDDIE
.how'd you see them?
CLARK
I read the first book. I worked at Boeing
for three years. When I read the book, I
didn't want to waste my time there
anymore. I came to help the Cause.
FREDDIE
What did it say?
CLARK
I'm skeptical of everything. Always have
been. All I know is I used to not be able
to sleep. Now I sleep through the night.
I spent 18 months at the Presidio with
every Army head-shrinker they had and not
one did as much for me as Book One did.
That's simple arithmetic to me. And I met
Elizabeth, so...
FREDDIE
That's good.
CLARK
He changes things. And the research is
hard to keep up with. None of this is
done by a long shot. Sometimes it's easy
to get lost.
FREDDIE
He's a very smart man. I can tell that. I
don't understand myself but - more time
with it and I might - I feel better - I
feel like I've more to do with my life
since I met him... and I JUST met him.
So - that can't be a bad thing, right?
CUT TO:
Outside an OLD APARTMENT BUILDING...
.Freddie BUZZES THE BUZZER.
60.
JOHN MORE (GROGGY) (O.C.)
Hello?
FREDDIE
I have a delivery for Mr. More. Special.
Late night delivery. I need a signature.
JOHN MORE (O.C.)
Yes, yes, of course...
CUT TO:
START CU. ON MASTER. He looks down at something in his
hands, quietly inspects it, looks up:
FREDDIE is here, he's given him the HANDKERCHIEF. HOLD
between them, then;
MASTER
What is it?
FREDDIE
I don't think John More will be speaking
out against you again.
MASTER
This isn't the way...you heard me say to
attack and you attacked?
FREDDIE
You were right.
MASTER
FREDDIE
You were right. . .he had a wise-ass mouth.
MASTER
My little Soldier.. .what did you
do?... . you need to tell me so that I
know...
65.
FREDDIE
That's why I won't tell you. Nothing bad.
Just scared him good.
WIDEN ANGLE, THAT MOMENT.
Reveal MARY SUE is here, listening... Master looks to Mary
Sue, back to Freddie:
MARY SUE
Whatever you've done, best not come back
to Master or the Cause.
FREDDIE
It won't.
MASTER
But-this-is-not-the-way-you-naughty-boy.
Ok? Alright. Freddie:
You-are-mischeif. Horrible young man you
are!
The PHONE RIGHTS, Mary Sue moves and picks it up, speaks
OC, we stay with MASTER and FREDDIE:
MASTER (CONT'D)
How are you...?
How do you feel to be so close to your
Auntie - just across the river? Close to
the incident of this present time?
FREDDIE
I don't really think about all that stuff
with my Auntie, you know ...I got other
things going on besides that thing I told
you about.. .that's yesterday's news to
me, so...
MASTER
Your problems aren't with your auntie or
your mommy or daddy or any such things.
FREDDIE
MASTER
You have seeded aberrations in this way.
Absolute rejection of authority and nay-
sayers.
FREDDIE
I don't like smart-mouths. If that's what
you mean.
66.
MASTER
Don't act out. This anger and battle has
been there from before you remember.
Before you know. It's not you, Freddie.
It's not...I promise you.
Freddie takes it all in.
FREDDIE
-- what is it?
He grasps his shoulders, touches his head to Freddie.
MASTER
It's just Q-44...all it is. Trillions of
years ago - little implants..
BEAT. He pulls back, smiles...
MASTER (CONT'D)
I promise to explain it. And make it go
away.
MASTER collects his notebooks.
MASTER (CONT'D)
Val has a habit of finding trouble...
I sometimes wonder what danger a man
could get himself into this Island.
MASTER (CONT'D)
Can you do this for me?
With a casualness and delicacy? Watchful
eyes to make sure trouble doesn't come...
or that come doesn't trouble? My little
soldier?
FREDDIE
Keep an eye on him?
MASTER
And report back to me...
FREDDIE
Alright.
MASTER leaves.
67.
VAL walks into a coffee shop, takes a seat in a booth and
orders some coffee...
FREDDIE stands across the street and watches VAL.
FREDDIE buys hot dog from a hot-dog vendor... stands and
waits.. .and watches VAL sit alone...
After a few minutes ... FREDDIE sees something:
A YOUNG GROUP ENTERS THE COFFEE SHOP. It's BILL WHITE,
his girlfriend PEGGY and TWO MALE NEW YORK FOLLOWERS: JIM
LEHR AND FRED FRITZ. They're here to meet VAL. They join
him, sit down, speak. Order cokes, coffee, smoke cigs,
etc...
FREDDIE watching all this from across the street. VAL is
answering their questions, speaking with some authority
about something, etc. etc.
70.
.FREDDIE sizes up the situation
And what this meeting might mean...
He turns this all around in his head for a while.. .and
after enough of it, gets restless...
.He moves to a phone booth. Makes a call. He hears a
young male voice say "HELLO? HELLO?"
FREDDIE
Bobby?
BOB (OC)
Yeah?
FREDDIE
It's Freddie.
BOB (OC)
FREDDIE! FREDDIE WHERE ARE YA!
FREDDIE
Are you home?
BOB (OC)
YEAH. YOU HERE?!
FREDDIE
I'm comin' over -
He hangs up.
He looks back across the street at the group in the
coffee shop. And WALKS AWAY, OFF DOWN THE STREET...
CUT TO:
The FIVE BOYS, including FREDDIE and BOB get out of an
OLD CAR... . they Find and lift a MANHOLE cover and head
down with FLASHLIGHTS and a SLEDGEHAMMER - They're drunk
and bring more BOOZE down with them - (two girls? staying
up top?)
They all climb up and out of the sewer - cheering and
celebrating.
DISSOLVE TO:
Everyone is GETTING INTO CARS.. .the whole ENTOURAGE.
FREDDIE at the center of it. MASTER comes out of the
hotel quickly and into the sedan that waits...
BILL WHITE is there to say good-bye and is all but
ignored by MASTER and MARY SUE...
The swirl of getting bags, kids and bodies into SEDANS...
77.
VAL gets in one car...FREDDIE gets behind the wheel of
another... and they DRIVE OFF...
CUT TO:
A party is in progress at HELEN SULLIVAN'S HOME which has
been converted into a STUDY COLLEGE. It's beautiful,
large, well-appointed home.
A woman: JOAN BANKS is singing, ELIZABETH is playing
piano. Everyone is here for a welcoming party, good time,
cocktails, snacks, etc...
JOAN (SINGING)
I DROPPED IT, I DROPPED IT, I BETTER GO
AND FIND IT.
(MORE)
78.
JOAN (SINGING) (CONT-D)
SOMETHING HURTS AND DON'T NEED THOSE
JERKS TO TELL US WHAT TO DO-O -
WE'RE HERE NOW, WE'RE HERE NOW.
IN LOVELY PHIL-E-DELFI. AND
WRESTLE OUR RE-ACTS RIGHT TO THE
GROUND AND PUSH, PULL, PIN IT DOWN.
WE'LL TAKE IT, WE'LL TAKE IT,
THOSE DIRTY SEEDS AND WIPE 'EM.
THE APA AND AMA WILL HAVE TO KISS OUR -
SS'S..
Everyone applauds, laughs. MASTER is smitten, STANDING
OVATION. MASTER walks over to JOAN to shake her hand...
She whispers to him:
JOAN (CONT'D)
What do you do with a student who keeps
dreaming she is in bed with you?
MASTER
Get thee behind me --
JOAN
And push.
They disperse. PIANO STARTS IN AGAIN...
Everyone is relaxed, sitting around. New faces (JOAN and
HELEN) sit close to MASTER...
A WOMAN is speaking (stories of Cause success she's had
at her branch in Minneapolis)
WOMAN
.a once-a-month meeting... this last
Saturday night we had a chiropractor..and
he spoke about 'Handwriting Analysis'...
MASTER is distracted... as he listens: HE RUBS HIS NOSE
AND PULLS HIS EAR, CATCHING FREDDIE'S EYE. As we hear the
woman ramble on, FREDDIE gets his FLASK, moves discreetly
to get a glass, make a drink and brings it to MASTER.
This is unnoticed by everyone but MARY SUE. The WOMAN
FINISHES TALKING:
MASTER
Cheers to that!
Everyone raises their glasses and DRINKS. MASTER downs
his new drink. A calm... then Master gently protificates:
79.
MASTER (CONT'D)
Something that Joseph Smith had right:
the breeding and the development of the
group... doubled, tripled with certain. ..a
certain marital structure... how clever.
Something to look at deeply for a
growth...
MARY SUE looks at him. JOAN looks at him. HELEN looks at
him. FREDDIE looks at all of it. Helen's husband John
looks confused.
MASTER (CONT'D)
.the consideration of Celestial
Marriage. Spiritual Wifery. Plural
Unions. These cannot be overlooked so
quickly... think of the speed at which a
movement could grow...
BEAT. Met with a strange silence. MARY SUE moves to get
up. . .MASTER changes the topic slightly...
MASTER (CONT'D)
To live in the days of six-shooters and
open frontier, that's what I'd like! My
grandfather. Rancher. Wyoming. A criminal
of the highest lineage, once told me he
met a boy named Buckskin Joe...
He keeps talking...
CUT TO:
A beautiful spring day. STUDENTS, FOLLOWERS, COME IN,
SIGN IN...
IN THE MAIN LIVING ROOM, on stage, MASTER is working with
a WOMAN, processing her. She lays back on a couch set
up...FULL CROWD of students watching...
MASTER
Try to recall how you feel...
WOMAN
Oh, I'm sort of glad it's the end..
MASTER
What happens next?
WOMAN
The doctor puts a stethoscope to her
chest..
MASTER
What is the doctor wearing?
WOMAN
A white coat.
MASTER
Is there a smell in the room?.
81.
WOMAN
It smells like a hospital.
MASTER
Try to imagine what a hospital smells
like.
WOMAN
Uugh. Uugh. Alright.
MASTER
What does the doctor say?
WOMAN
He listens to her chest and says, "She's
gone."
FREDDIE and VAL are sitting in the front foyer of the
house, facing each other in two folding chairs...we see
the. STAGE IN THE B.G...
.VAL is bored and nodding off to sleep ...FREDDIE
watches VAL. FREDDIE kicks his chair --
FREDDIE
Wake up. Your Father's speaking.. .you
could learn something.
VAL
What's that?
FREDDIE
You heard me.
VAL
He's making this up as he goes, don'tcha
know..? You can sleep and wake up and not
have missed anything...
FREDDIE
Maybe you should pay more attention.
VAL
You have something to say to me?
FREDDIE
I'm curly-q. Round in circles. So shut
up.
.FREDDIE takes a nice big drink from his FLASK...
FREDDIE looks out the open front door: TWO POLICEMAN AND
A MARSHALL are parking their cars and walking towards the
house...
82.
FREDDIE.
Watching them advance... He hesitates. He's not sure what
to do. So he stays put...
The MEN walk up to the house ...FREDDIE and VAL look:
POLICEMAN
We're looking for Lancaster Dodd.
FREDDIE
I don't know who that is...
POLICEMAN
May we come in?
FREDDIE
No. You cannot.
VAL
Yes you can. He's up there -
VAL points to the stage...
VAL (CONT'D)
That's him.
FREDDIE
You can't come in. Get outta here.
MASTER, ON STAGE, looks out - AGAINST THE GLARE OF THE
DOOR, he can recognize the FIGURES AS UNIFORMED...
ANGLE, AT THE DOOR.
POLICEMAN
We have a civil warrant to serve to
Lancaster Dodd to appear in Philadelphia
Bankruptcy Court - an arrest warrant -
VAL
Stay out of their way, Freddie.
MASTER walks down to see what's happening.
MASTER
What is happening here?
POLICEMAN
Are you Lancaster Dodd?
MASTER
Yes I Am.
83.
POLICEMAN
We have an arrest warrant for you, sir...
MASTER
What are the charges?
POLICEMAN
By order of Pennsylvania District Court
by the Mildred Purcell Foundation for
wrongful withdraw of funds. And operating
a medical school without a license.
That's.what we'll have to take you in for
MASTER
This is a silly joke, no?
MARSHALL
No, sir it isn't. But we have to take you
in and book and fingerprint you.
MASTER
This is comic opera. Is it illegal in
this city to get better?
MARSHALL
Please put your hands behind your back.
MASTER
I have no disagreement with you boys
doing your work in all its silliness as
defenders of what code? What honor? What
part of the galaxy? This is a scientific
gathering - you will cuff me from the
front, if you please --
He raises his ARMS for HANDCUFFS. FOLLOWERS COME FORWARD
AND START TO PROTEST ABOUT THIS. ONE YOUNG MAN, WITH ONE
ARM AND A HOOK FOR A HAND STARTS SWINGING IT AROUND (WWII
VET)
FREDDIE gets into it and is pushed by a POLICEMAN which
unleashes a WRATH IN HIM. IT VERY QUICKLY BECOMES A MINI-
MELE.
FREDDIE IS SLAMMED TO THE GROUND AND WRESTLED WITH BY THE
TWO MARSHALS. HE FIGHTS BACK. IT'S VERY ROUGH AND
VIOLENT.
MASTER, FREDDIE are taken away in hand cuffs. MARY SUE
comes out, angry at the police, everyone is, etc. Quite a
scene.
84.
MASTER is actually trying to CALM FREDDIE DOWN, WHO IS
GOING NUTS IN THE HANDCUFFS AND AT HIS TREATMENT
MASTER (CONT'D)
Freddie, no, no, no, calm down, please,
please. It's nothing, just laugh, we'll
be out shortly, it's nothing. I, please,
pleasue, Freddie -
FREDDIE is sitting outside the CLOSED DOOR to MASTER'S
UPSTAIRS BEDROOM/OFFICE. We HEAR VOICES talking
CLARK walks up and sits with FREDDIE, they sit in
silence... trying to listen, but not hearing...
CLARK
He's done this before...
FREDDIE
What happened?
CLARK
He ran out of money and came back. He's a
squirrel.
He's trying to get to The Split Saber,
don't you think?
To sell it. Sell it off to any of these
DISSENTERS -
88.
The door ... NORMAN CONRAD asks FREDDIE to come in...
FREDDIE gets off the plane, walks to the terminal - he
carries a DUFFLE BAG. Walking swiftly, purposefully...
CUT TO:
FREDDIE is in A CAB that pulls into a SUBURBAN PHOENIX
NEIGHBORHOOD. He gets out in front of RANCH STYLE HOME
separated a bit form the rest of the neighborhood ... THE
CAB WAITS.
HE WALKS UP TO THE HOUSE, TAKES OUT THE KEY...HE PUTS THE
KEY IN AND STEPS INSIDE. HE LOOKS AND SEES:
THE HOUSE HAS BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND RANSACKED.
Freddie is shocked/nervous ... . suddenly on guard.
FREDDIE walks around, looks into what appears to have
been MASTER'S OFFICE... Writing, books, etc, thrown all
over the place...
92.
HOLE'S IN THE WALLS, SOCKETS RIPPED OUT, FLOOR BOARDS
RIPPED UP...
CUT TO:
UNDER THE HOUSE. A CRAWL SPACE. FREDDIE crawls on his
belly underneath the house - goes to the center of it and
(HAT
finds a HOLE. He digs into it...and digs up A BOX
BOX SIZE) COVERED IN DUST. HE TAKES THE BOX OUT AND
CRAWLS AWAY.
HE PUTS THE BOX INTO HIS DUFFLE BAG. HE BRUSHES THE DUST
OFF. HE GOES BACK TO THE CAB AND GETS IN --
CUT TO:
FREDDIE pulls up in the cab to THE CAUSE H.Q. STOREFRONT
OPERATION in downtown PHOENIX. He walks in...DICK BRETON
(30s, Phoenix Branch Manager) is here - a few others.
DICK
Good morning.
FREDDIE
Are you Dick Breton? I'm Freddie Sutton.
You're expecting me...
FREDDIE is very friendly, but focused on the task, he
asks to use the phone to call Master - some place
private, perhaps...
CUT TO:
FREDDIE bursts out into the street in full-ready-for-
anything mode ... . STRETCH OUT, MINI SEQUENCE...
.looking up at the rooftops, alley's, etc...
.He gets across the street, rounds a corner, and into -
CUT TO:
FREDDIE with DICK BRETON and another FOLLOWER are
cleaning, fixing up the ranch house...
CUT TO:
A PLANE TAXI'S TO A STOP, MASTER and MARY SUE, ELIZABETH,

FREDDIE, clean cut and wearing a nice suit, is here to
GREET THEM. They head for CARS waiting...
CUT TO:
THE WHOLE-ENTOURAGE unloads and heads into the house.
CUT TO:

MASTER and FREDDIE pull up in a car to the bank, get out,
GO IN:
CUT TO:
FREDDIE is sitting outside the house, smoking a cig,
drinking some coffee... (distant sound of typing coming
from inside the house - Master at work)
.a CAR PULLS up...across the street. . .he watches it
park... . and out steps: BILL WHITE (from New York)
.he closes the door... and walks across the
street... towards the house ... . he Looks very out of place
in the middle of the desert. . .he approaches Freddie:
BILL
Hello, Freddie.
FREDDIE
Bill.
BILL
Just dropped in to see Master, find out
what's going on - guess I lost my
invitation.
FREDDIE
There's nothing going on, Bill.
BILL
What does that mean?
FREDDIE
That's what that means.
BILL
Does that mean I'm out? Am I in? What
does that mean?
FREDDIE
That's it.
102.
BILL
Y'know that I've had no communications
from this office for six weeks - no
Journals, no answer's to my calls, I
wrote a letter, was it received?
FREDDIE
Yes.
BILL
I'm mixed up slightly here. You know,
when I worked for the Cause, I was made a
nearly $800 in salary due me.
FREDDIE
We appreciate that.
BILL
And as a Founding Member, I'm supposed to
be a member for life?
FREDDIE
Yes.
BILL
And that entitles me to the Journals?
FREDDIE
Yes.
BILL
But I haven't gotten the Journals?
FREDDIE
No.
BILL
And I'm not going to get the Journals?
FREDDIE
No.
BILL
And do you know that I'm a Fellow of the
Cause and as a Fellow of the Cause I'm a
member for life?
FREDDIE
Yes.
BILL
But I haven't gotten the Journals?
103.
FREDDIE
No.
BILL
And do you know that I paid $800 for the
Minister's Course and that entitles me to
membership in the Group until January 1?
FREDDIE
BILL
And as a member I'm supposed to get the
journals?
FREDDIE
BILL
And I'm not going to get any Journals?
FREDDIE
No.
BILL
Ok. Do you know that I paid $50 for my
"Doctor Of Divinity" certificate, and for
which I also was to receive a medallion,
a ribbon, a lapel pin, and a gold
bordered book of The Cause?
FREDDIE
Yes.
BILL
And I haven't gotten them?
FREDDIE
No.
BILL
But you're going to give them to me?
FREDDIE
No.
BILL
Then I suppose you're going to refund my
money?
FREDDIE
No.
104.
BILL
Why?
FREDDIE
You're a dissenter. And an unfaithful
woman.
BEAT.
BILL.
Aren't you ashamed of yourself, sitting
there getting all red in the face and
being embarrassed because you have to act
like a heel?
FREDDIE
I'm not embarrassed. That's sunburn.
BILL
I'm not going to let anyone tell me I
can't have what I paid for, except
Master. I want to see Master.
FREDDIE
You can't see Master.
BILL
Why?
FREDDIE
Because he's busy and I'm not going to
let you.
BILL
Oh...it's Freddie-Barrier now? Why don't
you hyphenate that?
PAUSE.
BILL (CONT'D)
You know what this all is? Huh? It's
mental cruelty. That's what it is. It's
just mental cruelty to invent all these
new ideas and never follow through on it
and just keep adding and subtracting and
I gotta pay for this and that level and
more and more-and Book II's coming. All
the answers..."if you had that, it's no
good 'cause here's the new thing.. .and
oh no...you don't need that.. .that's
old.. .this is new." And it's more and
more and it's all just cruel.
(MORE)
105.
BILL (CONT'D)
And it's all gettin' away form what it
was at the start which made sense. This
is screwed man. Screw this. And screw
you.
BILL leaves.
FREDDIE watches him go. Something takes hold of him.
.FREDDIE walks after BILL, behind his back, come up on
