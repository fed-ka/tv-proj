                                      COLD OPEN

    INT. BAR - EVENING

    MARK IS SITTING AT A TABLE AT A BAR. HE IS 22 YEARS OLD, 
    SWEET LOOKING BUT A LONG WAY FROM DASHING. 

    HE LOOKS NERVOUS - AS HE IS WAITING FOR A COMPUTER DATE. HE 
    IS WEARING A RED CARNATION IN HIS LAPEL.  

    AN ATTRACTIVE GIRL WALKS IN. AS SHE WALKS PAST, MARK LOOKS 
      HOPEFUL. SHE WALKS STRAIGHT PAST. HE WATCHES HER GO AND LOOKS 
      DISAPPOINTED.

    ANOTHER ATTRACTIVE GIRL COMES IN. MARK LOOKS HOPEFUL. HE SEES 
    HER GREET HER BOYFRIEND. HE LOOKS DISAPPOINTED. 

    FROM BEHIND MARK COMES A VOICE

                                  KATIE (O.S.)

                Mark? It s Mark isn t it?

    MARK GETS UP AND TURNS AROUND AND SEES KATIE. SHE S 22, A 
    PRETTY GIRL NEXT DOOR TYPE. MARK KNOWS HER FROM HIGH SCHOOL. 
    HE IS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER.

                                MARK

                Katie! Wow Katie? This is amazing...

                                  KATIE

              It must have been... I mean it s 

                years...

                                MARK

                ...I haven t seen you since high 

                school. [he pauses and takes in the 

                sight of her]  Wow! Katie Mackey.

    THEY SMILE AT EACH OTHER. 

                                  KATIE

                Mark. Mark...                                   ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              2.



    SHE STRUGGLES FOR THE LAST NAME AND LOSES.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)

                I m sorry - I ve forgotten your last 

                name.

                                MARK

                Fletcher. 

                                  KATIE

                Mark Fletcher. 

                                MARK

                This is incredible! I was thinking - 

              my date s probably going to be awful, 

              or like - a Russian transsexual. And 

                then it turns out to be you!

                                  KATIE

                Huh?

                                MARK

              I mean, I worried that this computer 

                dating thing was only for loners and 

                weirdos but...

                                  KATIE

                Computer dating? 

    MARK LOOKS KATIE UP AND DOWN. HE REALISES SHE IS WEARING A 
      WAITRESS OUTFIT. SHE IS CARRYING A PAD OF PAPER, WITH A PEN. 
    A BEAT OF REALISATION. 

                                MARK

                You...work here don t you?                                  ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              3.



                                  KATIE

                Yeah. You were saying something about 

                computer dating. 

                                MARK

              Oh that! Ignore me! When I m surprised 

              I talk about things I have never, ever

                experienced. Have you ever been ice-

                climbing? 

                                  KATIE

                No.

                                MARK

              Me neither! There you see. So, where 

                are you living at the moment?

                                  KATIE

                Just next door actually. 

                                MARK

              Oh right.  

                                  KATIE

                Yeah. With some friends from college. 

                There was someone else, but he s gone 

                travelling, so if you know anyone 

                who s looking... 

                                MARK

                Actually, I might know someone who'd 

              be interested. 

                                  KATIE

                Yeah?                                   ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              4.



                                MARK

                He's er&about medium height, brown 

                hair, quite charismatic, good looking 

              in his own way, popular, a bit of a 

                joker&

    PAUSE

                                MARK (CONT D)

                &popular&

    KATIE LOOKS BLANKLY AT MARK

                                MARK (CONT D)

                Me! I mean me!

                                  KATIE

              Oh yes! Of course! Well that would be 

                perfect. I m on my shift now, but 

                stick around and I ll get you the 

                details. Can you do that?

                                MARK

                Sure.

                                  KATIE

                Great!

    AND SHE GOES OFF ABOUT HER BUSINESS.

    MARK SITS BACK IN HIS SEAT. A MASSIVE SMILE TAKES OVER HIS 
    WHOLE FACE.

                                OLGA (O.S.)
                      (very low voice, Russian 
                      accent)

                Excuse me? Are you Mark Fletcher?

    MARK LOOKS UP TO SEE A VERY OBVIOUS, STOCKY TRANSSEXUAL 
      STANDING IN FRONT OF HIM.                                  ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              5.



                                MARK

                Me? 

    MARK THINKS ABOUT HIS RESPONSE. 

                                MARK (CONT D)

                No. 

    OLGAR LOOKS AT MARK SUSPICIOUSLY. MARK SMILES BACK.                                   ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              6.


                                      ACT ONE

    INT. THOM S KITCHEN/LOUNGE - MORNING

    THE TINY MAIN ROOM OF A TINY ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT. IT IS A 
      COMPLETE TIP. 

    MARK IS SLEEPING IN A SLEEPING BAG ON A MATTRESS ON THE 
    FLOOR. HIS CLOTHES ARE STREWN ON THE SOFA. 

    THERE ARE NO CURTAINS, AND THE ROOM IS LETTING IN ALL THE 
    LIGHT, SO MARK IS WEARING THOSE BLACK GOGGLES PEOPLE WEAR FOR 
      HANGOVERS/AIR TRAVEL. 

    THOM ENTERS. HE IS A LOVEABLE AND ENTHUSIASTIC 22 YEAR OLD 
    GEEK. HE AND MARK ARE BEST FRIENDS FROM COLLEGE. 

    HE IS NAKED. HE IS TOTALLY COMFORTABLE WITH THIS. 

                                THOM

                Hey stud, how did the date go!

    MARK GROANS IN BED. 

    THOM LOOKS AT THE SINK WHICH IS FULL OF DIRTY PLATES. HE GETS 
    TO THE BOTTOM AND TAKES OUT A VERY DIRTY BOWL FROM THE SIDE. 

    HE STUDIES IT. HE POURS CEREAL AND MILK IN. HE EATS A 
      SPOONFUL, AND CHEWS THOUGHTFULLY.

                                THOM (CONT D)

                You know you d expect chicken soup and 

                Cheerios to go well together. They 

                don t.

    HE TAKES ANOTHER SPOONFUL JUST TO MAKE SURE.

                                THOM (CONT D)

                No, they really don t. 

    THOM PUTS THE BOWL DOWN. 

    HE GOES TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKS OUT. HE YAWNS AND STRETCHES. 

    HE SEES SOMEONE ON THE STREET BELOW. THEY RE CLEARLY ABLE TO 
    SEE HIM COMPLETELY NAKED. HE SMILES. HE WAVES. HE CHUCKLES TO 
      HIMSELF.                                    ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              7.



                                THOM (CONT D)
                      (with affection)

                Kids!

    MARK GROANS IN BED. 

                                THOM (CONT D)

                Mark, time to get up! Time for you to 

                start the day. 

    MARK GROANS. THOM TUGS MARK'S SLEEPING BAG A BIT OFF HIM.  

                                THOM (CONT D)

                Mark. Get up!

    THOM TUGS AGAIN, MARK PUTS UP MORE RESISTANCE, BUT THE COVERS 
    ARE ALMOST OFF. THOM CONTINUES TO URGE MARK TO GET UP, UNTIL&

                                MARK

                Right, that's it.

    MARK SUDDENLY LAUNCHES HIMSELF AT THOM. THEY WRESTLE ON THE 
    FLOOR FOR A WHILE, UNTIL MARK IS FIRMLY PINNED UNDER THOM.

    THEY LIE FACE TO FACE, LAUGHING. MARK SUDDENLY STOPS 
      LAUGHING, AS IF HE'S FELT SOMETHING. THOM IS STILL LAUGHING.

                                MARK (CONT D)

                Thom? 

                                THOM

                Mark.

    PAUSE

                                MARK

                You're naked, aren't you.

    MARK SLOWLY LIFTS OFF HIS EYE GOGGLES. HE LOOKS AT THOM IN 
    HORROR. 

                                THOM

                Yes, I am.                                  ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              8.



    PAUSE

                                MARK

              I& think it's time I moved out.

                                THOM

                Move out?

    MARK HAS LEFT THE ROOM, LEAVING THOM THERE NAKED, FACE DOWN 
    ON THE FLOOR. HE CALLS AFTER MARK, DESPERATE.

                                THOM (CONT D)

                For the love of god - why?!

    INT. KATIE S ROOM - MORNING

    A DOUBLE BEDROOM IN A MARKEDLY MORE STYLISH APARTMENT. 

    BEN IS 22 AND VERY GOOD LOOKING JOCK. HE IS KATIE S ON/OFF 
      BOYFRIEND AND KNOWS HER FROM COLLEGE.  

    NAKED, SAVE AN ELEGANT KIMONO, HE WAKES UP TO SEE KATIE 
      STANDING AT THE FOOT OF HIS BED.

    THE BED IS COVERED WITH POST-COITAL TISSUES. KATIE IS 
      DETERMINED BUT TEARFUL&

                                  KATIE

              I know I said this two weeks ago. But 

                this time it really is over, Ben.

                                  BEN

                OK. 

    BEN ROLLS OUT OF BED, TOTALLY NONCHALANT. KATIE MEETS HIM AT 
    THE DOOR OF THE ROOM. 

                                  KATIE

                What went wrong? Was I not good enough 

                for you?                                  ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              9.



                                  BEN

                You were too good, Katie. There was 

                nothing left to want.

                                  KATIE

              Is that true?

                                  BEN

              Of course not. Can I go now?

    BEN WALKS INTO THE ENSUITE BATHROOM. WE HEAR A SHOWER START.  



    INT. THOM'S KITCHEN/LOUNGE - MORNING 

    THOM AND MARK ARE EATING BREAKFAST AT THE BREAKFAST BAR. 
    THOM'S CLEARLY REALLY UPSET WITH MARK. 

    HE BUTTERS SOME TOAST AGGRESSIVELY. HE CLUNKS DOWN THE KNIFE. 
    HE CLUNKS DOWN THE BUTTER. 

                                MARK

                You're not upset are you?

                                THOM
                      (incredibly upset)

                No!

                                MARK

                I'm sorry, Thom, but this is exactly 

                the kind of break I've been looking 

                for. I've been dreaming about Katie 

                since I was fifteen years old. 

    PAUSE. THOM IS NOT MOVED.                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              10.



                                MARK (CONT D)

                This guy James she shares with, 

                apparently he's an investment banker - 

                he's rich, dresses well, goes out a 

                lot. 

                                THOM

                Goes out a lot? 

                                MARK

                Yeah. His girlfriend's this glamorous 

                girl in TV.

                                THOM
                      (impressed)

                TV? Girlfriend?

                                MARK

                You see? These are people I can really 

                relate to.

    THOM HAS CHEERED UP

                                THOM

                Yeah. Me too. We'll all be great 

                friends.

    MARK LOOKS AWKWARD

                                MARK

                Yes, but I really feel they could 

                bring something out in me.

                                THOM
                      (grinning)

                And I'll be right by your side. We'll 

                all hang out together.                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              11.



    MARK LOOKS, AGAIN, AWKWARD. 

    THOM PICKS UP A DIRTY MUG FROM THE SINK. HE POURS SOME ORANGE 
    JUICE INTO IT. 

                                MARK

                Didn t you mix your eggs in that mug? 

    THOM SPITS OUT HIS ORANGE JUICE. IT IS DISGUSTING. 

                                THOM

                I m having really bad luck with my 

                combinations this morning!

    THOM LOOKS AT THE INSIDE OF THE MUG. WE SEE IT TOO, IT S 
      DISGUSTING.  

                                THOM (CONT D)

                Actually the aftertaste is OK. 

    INT. KATIE S ROOM - MORNING

    KATIE IS STILL AT THE DOOR OF BEN'S ROOM. BEN IS BRISKLY 
    DRYING HIMSELF OFF AFTER HIS SHOWER. 

                                  KATIE

                Three months is a long time, Ben. When 

              I think about that whole part of our 

                lives that we're just throwing away&

                                  BEN

                You want to have sex one last time.

                                  KATIE

                Yes.

                                  BEN

                Like last night.

                                  KATIE

    BEN SHRUGS. HE FOLDS UP HIS TOWEL.

                                  BEN

                Sure. Why not? 

    EXT. A TRAIN PLATFORM - MORNING

    THOM AND MARK ARE WAITING ON A TRAIN PLATFORM, STANDING 
    BESIDE ONE OF THOSE SMALL COFFEE BOOTHS. 

                                MARK

                She s with this guy called Ben at 

                present but, reading between the 

                lines, I reckon that s rocky. All I 

                have to do is wait. 

                                THOM

                Wait? Let me say something here, Mark. 

                Women respect a powerful man. That's 

                why I took up archery. Women respect a 

                man with imagination. That's why I 

                read fantasy fiction. Women do not, 

                however, respect a man who has been 

                building up to making his move for six 

                and a half years.

                That's why I didn't do that and I 

                never would. 

                                MARK

                But at least if I get into the house, 

              I can&                                 ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              13.

                Live on the same territory, establish 

              a day to day rapport - sure. But then 

                surprise her with some subtle token of 

                your affection. Something classy. 

    PAUSE. THOM THINKS.

                                THOM (CONT D)

                Remember that film we saw where the 

                guy makes up to his wife by wrapping 

                flowers around his genitals?

                                MARK

                Yes.

                                THOM

                Would she like that?

                                MARK

                Katie?

                                THOM

                Sure.

                                MARK

                No.

                                THOM

                Not the flowers kind, eh? Tricky. 

                Tricky.                                 ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              14.



                                MARK

              I was thinking more, you know. We'd be 

                watching TV one night, and gradually 

                her head would rest onto my shoulder, 

                and she'd nuzzle my neck and start to 

                kiss me. And then she'd take my hand 

                and lead me to her room. And then...

                                THOM
                      (captivated by the story)

                And then what..?

                                MARK

                And then we'd have sex.

                                THOM

                Great! I did not see that coming. 

    THE COFFEE WAITRESS BEHIND THE COUNTER IS A 22 YEAR OLD, WHO 
    LOOKS LIKE SHE WOULD BE VERY GLAMOROUS ON HER DAYS OFF. SHE 
    IS WELL GROOMED AND HARD EDGED. 

    SHE LEANS FORWARD AND PLONKS A COFFEE IN FRONT OF MARK. MARK 
    LOOKS AT THE CUP OF COFFEE. 

                                MARK

                Umm& sorry. I think I ordered a cup of 

                tea. 

    THE WAITRESS LOOKS BLANKLY BACK AT HIM. 

                                MARK (CONT D)

                This is coffee. 

                                  WAITRESS
                    (as if Mark is being 
                        staggeringly petty)

                It's a hot drink.                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              15.



                                MARK

                Well, may I have a cup of tea instead 

                please?

    THE WAITRESS SHAKES HER HEAD, AND GROANS IN PROTEST LIKE AN 
      ADOLESCENT. SHE GOES TO THE BACK OF THE COFFEE BOOTH AND 
    STARTS TO PREPARE ANOTHER DRINK.  

    MARK STANDS AGOG FOR A WHILE.

                                THOM

                This is all part of the same thing, 

                Mark. You let women walk all over you. 

                Stop being so nice. As soon as that 

                bitch comes back I want you to give 

                her hell!

                                  WAITRESS

                There's your tea, sir. 

    SHE HANDS OVER THE ACCOMPANYING PAPER NAPKIN. 

                                  WAITRESS (CONT D)

                And there's your prize for being this 

                week's most anal customer. 

                                MARK

                Thank you. Thanks, very much.

    THE WAITRESS TUTS AND PROCEEDS BACK. 

    MARK TURNS TO SEE THOM SHAKE HIS HEAD.  

    MARK RAPS HIS HAND ON THE COUNTER.

                                MARK (CONT D)

                Erm&excuse me.

                                  WAITRESS

                What?                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              16.



                                MARK

                Excuse me& I'm sorry. I don't like 

                your attitude.

                                  WAITRESS

                What's wrong with my attitude?

                                MARK
                      (warming up)

                It's bad. It's a bad attitude. 

                                  WAITRESS

                So?

                                MARK

                So, I think we need to talk&

                                                                            FADE TO:

                                MARK (CONT D)
                      (relaxed)

                You probably don't think this is 

                really your job, do you? You're not 

                really just a coffee-vendor. You're 

                waiting for your break in television, 

              or advertising, somewhere where you 

                can be pretty and bright for a living. 

                Well, I think you should know: you're 

                not that pretty, and my guess is 

                you're not that bright&

                                                                            FADE TO:

                you to the giddy heights of sandwich

                you in charge of the latte machine.

                distinguish between the only two hot 

                drinks you have to serve. By the way, 

                that's tea, that's coffee.

                                THOM
                      (pointing at his drink)

                And that's hot chocolate.

                sarcastic comments to yourself in 

                future. Because you piss me off. Good 

                day.

    INT. BAR - MORNING

                                THOM

                How come this guy James has to 

                interview you?

                                MARK

                It s his house. I guess he wants to 

                check he likes his new roomie. 

                                THOM

                Right. And how are you going to 

                impress him?

                                MARK

              I don t know. Just be myself I guess.

    THOM LOOKS AT HIM, WORRIED. HE STARTS SLOWLY SHAKING HIS 
    HEAD, LOOKING MARK IN THE EYES. 

                                MARK (CONT D)

                What?

                                THOM

                OK. Practice questions for the 

                interview then:

    THOM CHANGES HIS DEMEANOR TO ACT THE PART OF A HARSH 
      INTERVIEWER.

                                THOM (CONT D)

              So Mark, are you currently attached?

                                MARK

                Not at the moment, James. 

    THOM LOOKS AT MARK, AS IF TO IMPLY THAT BEING SINGLE MEANS 
    YOU ARE WEIRD.                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              19.



                                THOM

                Hmm. 

                                MARK

              I mean, I'm single at the moment, but 

              in my time at college, I went out with 

                three or four girls. Really attractive 

                ones.

                                THOM
                      (reverting to his normal 
                      self)

                You never! I was at college with you.  

                                MARK

                Thom, I told you about those three or 

                four girls I went out with at high 

                school. The really attractive ones.

                                THOM

              At high school, yes. But the sex tired 

                you out so much that at college you 

                decided to be celibate for three 

                years. Remember? And I did too. To 

                help you out.

                                MARK

                Yes, but I have to tell James I went 

                out with lots of girls at college, 

                because otherwise it sounds a bit 

                strange, like a lie. Even though it's 

                true.                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              20.



                                THOM

                You're right. I have the same problem 

                when I tell people about losing my 

                virginity to that girl in the Czech 

                Republic.

                                MARK
                      (correcting him)

                You mean Fiji.

                                THOM

                Yes, Fiji. Of course.

    INT. OFFICE - MORNING

    WE SEE THE FACE OF A WATCH READING HALF-PAST TWELVE. WE THEN 
    SEE THE WATCH'S WEARER.

    WE ARE IN JAMES  OFFICE. JAMES IS 22, A FAIRLY AVERAGE 
    LOOKING GUY IN EXPENSIVE CLOTHES WITH A SERIOUS SELF 
      IMPORTANT MANNER. JAMES IS DINGLE S BOYFRIEND, AND KNOWS 
    DINGLE, KATIE AND BEN FROM COLLEGE. 

    HE IS SHOUTING INTO A PHONE AS HE CHECKS THE TIME.

                                  JAMES

                No, no! I don't want to hear any of 

                this crap, just quote me a 

                number!&give me a number& no, I don't 

                want to hear that, I don't want to 

                hear that, I don't want&

      TALKING.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)

                Listen, buddy, are we going to screw 

                around with generalities all day, or 

                are you going to give me what I want? 

                Good. Right. That wasn't so hard now 

                was it?

    HE PUTS THE PHONE DOWN

                                  JAMES (CONT D)

                Goddam directory assistance!

    INT. BAR - AFTERNOON

    KATIE IS IN A BAR WITH HER BEST FRIEND, DINGLE. DINGLE IS 
    KATIE S BEST FRIEND FROM COLLEGE. 

    KATIE IS LOOKING AT A PHOTO. THE CAMERA SHOT REMAINS TIGHT ON 
    KATIE'S FACE.

                                  DINGLE

                How have you been feeling since Ben 

                finished with you? 

    KATIE LOOKS TEARFUL ON AN INSTANT.

                                  KATIE

                Not good. I just can't believe it's 

                really over. It doesn't seem so long 

                ago that he took me back to his place 

                for the first time. [dreamily] We made 

                love in every room. 

                                  DINGLE

              It was a studio apartment.

                                  KATIE

              It was so romantic! Where did it all 

              go wrong?

                                  DINGLE

                Don't blame yourself, Katie! There's 

              no way you could have predicted it.

                                  KATIE

              to all your friends at high school, 

                and I did tell you every day twice a 

                day for the whole three months of your 

                relationship that he was going to 

                cheat on you. Which he did.  

    KATIE SLUMPS ON THE TABLE, AND CRIES IN EARNEST. 

    DINGLE MOVES THE PHOTO ACROSS THE TABLE TOWARDS HER. 

    IT SHOWS BEN AT GRADUATION, SURROUNDED BY KATIE, DINGLE AND 
    TWO OTHER GIRLS. 

                                  DINGLE (CONT D)

                Katie, you might think this shallow, 

                but after my exam results, my career 

                looked dead in the water, just like 

                your love life does. Now, I've got a 

                job in television, I'm successful, 

                thin, and thrillingly happy. So don't 

                cry. It can happen. It happened to me. 

    WE NOW SEE DINGLE. 

    IT IS THE SAME GIRL AS THE COFFEE ATTENDANT THAT MARK TOLD 
    OFF.

    SHE SMILES

    INT. OFFICE - AFTERNOON

    JAMES IS PACING ABOUT THE ROOM, HOLDING HIS CLIPBOARD.

                I'm an actor.                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              24.



                                  JAMES

              An actor?! Wow! What kind of stuff do 

                you do?

                                MARK

                Well, you know, theatre, TV, films&

                                  JAMES

                Films? What films have you been in?

                                MARK

                Pardon? 

                                  JAMES

              I mean, were you in "Amistad"? That's 

              a very touching film. 

                                MARK

                No. I'm actually just temping at the 

                moment.

                                  JAMES

                Right. Temping. Wow. [he mouths while 

              he makes a note]  Amistad . 

    INT. BAR - AFTERNOON

    DINGLE AND KATIE'S DISCUSSION IS NOW QUITE HEATED.

                                  KATIE

                Dingle, I know Ben. And you have to 

                realize that Ben is a very physical 

                person - he finds it hard to express 

                himself otherwise. So when he had sex 

                with Nicky&                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              25.



                                  DINGLE

                And Jane.

                                  KATIE

                &and Jane& he was saying "look at me. 

              I feel neglected."

                                  DINGLE

                Katie, Ben used you. And if you keep 

                going back for more, he'll just use 

                you again.

                                  KATIE

              Do you think so? Do you think there's 

                still a chance?

    KATIE REALIZES WHAT SHE HAS SAID AND LOOKS DOWN IN SHAME. SHE 
    LOOKS LIKE SHE'S ABOUT TO CRY. DINGLE REACHES ACROSS THE 
    TABLE TO CONSOLE HER. 

                                  DINGLE

              Oh darling! Do you know what the most 

                difficult thing in the world is? 

                Watching your friends make mistakes. 

                When you've specifically told them not 

                to. Now, I don't want you to feel 

                emotionally pressured by this, but if 

                you sleep with Ben one more time, I'll 

                never speak to you again. It's the 

                only kind way. 

                                  KATIE

                But&                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              26.



                                  DINGLE

                Promise!

                                  KATIE

              I promise, Dingle. 

                                  DINGLE

                Good girl.

    KATIE GETS UP TO GO TO THE TOILET. 

    DINGLE REACHES INTO HER HANDBAG AND BRINGS OUT A FOLDED PIECE 
    OF PAPER. AS SHE UNFOLDS IT WE REALIZE IT IS A PHOTO, A COPY 
    OF THE PHOTO KATIE HAD. 

      HOWEVER, IN DINGLE'S COPY, THE TWO OTHER GIRLS HAVE BLACK 
    MARKER PEN CROSSES OVER THEIR FACES. DINGLE GETS A BLACK 
    MARKER PEN. SHE CROSSES OUT KATIE'S FACE. SHE LOOKS UP, LOST 
    IN REVERIE.

    INT. OFFICE - AFTERNOON

    JAMES IS BACK ON HIS CHAIR. HE LOOKS DOWN HIS NOTES. HE 
    APPEARS TO BE MAKING SOME CALCULATIONS FROM THEM.

                                  JAMES

                Well, Mark&I am pleased to welcome& 

                no, wait!

    HE LOOKS BACK AT HIS NOTES, MOVING HIS LIPS AS HE GOES. HE 
    HAS TO TURN HIS EYES UPWARDS AS IF TRYING TO MAKE SURE A BIT 
    OF ARITHMETIC IS RIGHT.

                                  JAMES (CONT D)

                No. No. It's alright. I was right 

                before. 

    JAMES BEGINS HOLE-PUNCHING THE NOW MASSIVE PILE OF NOTES HE 
    HAS MADE, AND PROCEEDS TO PUT THEM IN A RING BINDER ENTITLED 
    "MARK FLETCHER"                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              27.



                                  JAMES (CONT D)

                Now, in an ideal world I'd check with 

                Dingle before I do this, but screw it - 

                it's my name on the contract. I'd be 

                delighted to have you with us. Just 

                sign there

    HE HANDS THE CONTRACT TO MARK

    INT. BAR - AFTERNOON

    MARK ENTERS THE BAR, WITH A BIG FAT SMILE. KATIE RUNS UP TO 
    HIM. 

                                  KATIE

                Good?

                                MARK
                      (with new found confidence)

                I'm your new lover! Roommate. I said 

                roommate. 

    KATIE, OBLIVIOUS, SMILES AND GIVES MARK A HUG. MARK SEES 
    DINGLE OVER HER SHOULDER. HIS FACE DROPS. 

                                  KATIE

                Mark, this is my other roomie, Dingle.

                                MARK

                Yes, we've met  - no we haven't.

    DINGLE IS SHAKING HER HEAD FURIOUSLY AT HIM.

                                  KATIE

                Hey, maybe Dingle could help you out. 

                [to Dingle] Mark wants to be an actor&

                                MARK
                      (correcting her)

              Is an actor&                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              28.



                                  KATIE
                    (to Mark)

                &Dingle works in TV.

    MARK NOTES THE LIE BUT TRIES TO BE POLITE ABOUT IT.

                                MARK

              Oh really, what on? 

                                  DINGLE

                It's called "if you think you're 

                living with me after what happened 

                this morning, you're very much 

                mistaken."

    SHE STARES AT MARK. MARK STARES BACK, BUT LOOKS UNCERTAIN.

                                  KATIE

              If that's a new project, Mark could 

                audition for it!

    MARK, STILL STARING AT DINGLE, DECIDES THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT 
    NOT TO FIGHT.

                                MARK

                Hmm. When's it being filmed?

                                  DINGLE

                November. 

                                MARK

                Actually Katie, I've got a job coming 

              up in November. 

                                  (MORE)                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              29.

                                  MARK(CONT'D)

                I'm up to play a desperate man who 

                it's unwise to cross, in the crime 

                thriller "I know your secret, Missy, 

                and I'll snitch if you attempt to foil 

              my accommodation plans."

                                  KATIE

                Mark, that's wonderful. Why didn't you 

                tell me?

                                  DINGLE

              I think I know a producer who's 

                working on that actually, Mark. I met 

                him on "very well, we have a deal, but 

                I'll be watching you"

                                  KATIE

                Brilliant. When did you do that one?

                                  DINGLE

                It's ongoing. 

    MARK AND DINGLE ARE STARING AT EACH OTHER TO THE POINT WHERE 
    KATIE IS FINDING CONVERSATION QUITE HARD. 

                                  KATIE

                I'm such an idiot! I haven't heard of 

                any of those programmes. 

                                  DINGLE AND MARK
                        (simultaneously)

                They're on cable.

    DINGLE AND MARK LOOK AT EACH OTHER. THEY ARE WORTHY 
      OPPONENTS&                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              30.



    INT. THE APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

    MARK IS BRINGING IN ALL HIS STUFF. KATIE IS ON THE SOFA.

    THERE ARE SUITCASES, A PLANT, A LAVA LAMP, BOOKS, DUMBBELLS, 
    A CASSIUS CLAY POSTER, A LARGE GLASS FRAME WITH PHOTOS OF 
    MARK WITH FRIENDS. 

                                MARK

                That s the lot.

                                  KATIE

                Remember when me and Hannah Proops 

                tried to smuggle all that bourbon onto 

                the high school trip?

                                MARK

                Yes.

                                  KATIE

                And you took the blame for us.

                                MARK
                      (mimicking himself)

                "It s mine. It s all mine!"

                                  KATIE
                      (laughing)

                Yes. And Mr. Marshall said&

                going to put you on report card for 

                the next three years!"

    KATIE LAUGHS, BUT LESS SURE OF HERSELF

                                  KATIE

                Yes, and&                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              31.

    PAUSE

                                  KATIE

                Taking the blame like that. That was a 

                really sweet thing to do. 

    MARK SMILES

                                MARK

                                  KATIE

                What did you think of Dingle?

                                MARK

              I really really really like her.

                                  KATIE

                Sometimes I think she can be a 

                bit&um&do you know what I mean?                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              32.



                                MARK

                Yeah. I could tell that she was 

                um&like that.

                                  KATIE

                Bossy.

                                MARK

                Yes, exactly. Bossy. And a bad judge 

              of character. Quite arrogant too. And 

                really annoying.

                                  KATIE

              I thought you liked her.

                                MARK

              I do. I do. I really really really 

                like her.

                                  KATIE

                Could I ask you something?

                                MARK

                Sure.

                                  KATIE

                This is a hypothetical situation which 

                isn't real and I'm asking it because I 

                just want to know the etiquette if it 

                maybe happened to a friend of mine, 

                like, way off in the future or 

                something.

              If this person's best friend, the one 

              in the future, has told her not to be 

                with someone, and has made her promise 

                not to, but she still wants to be with 

                that person. What do you think she 

                should she do?

                        perception)

                Yes! But it's someone she doesn't 

                really know, and I, well, I've known 

                him for ages.

    MARK NODS.

                You shouldn't listen to Dingle. I 

                don't think she's& objective. 

                                  KATIE

                Thanks, Mark. I'll see you at home.

                That is awesome. There is absolutely 

              no way she could have been talking 

                about anyone else but you. 

                                MARK

                Think so?

                Nice, nice.  Just one problem.

                The best friend.

                                THOM

                Mark, I enjoyed this morning on the 

                platform. I admire what you did, don't 

                get me wrong. However, with the 

                benefit of hindsight, knowing that you 

                were about to move in with her, you 

                almost certainly made a bad first 

                impression.                                  ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              35.



                                MARK

                Maybe it won't make a difference.

                                THOM

                Think for a minute, will you? If 

                Dingle hates you, she'll try to make 

                life in the house as hard as possible. 

                You'll start to feel unpopular - just 

                like at college. Except this time 

                it'll be worse - because this is real 

                life - there's no going back. 

    HE TAKES A SIP OF MILK.

                                THOM (CONT D)

                You've got to show Katie how much she 

                means to you before Dingle ruins it 

                all. The question is: how?

    MARK PUTS HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND STARTS TO THINK.

                Maybe in another reality, we would 

                have stayed together.

    HE LEAVES. MARK WATCHES HIM GO. HE IS VERY ANNOYED THAT THIS 
    IS HIS RIVAL. HE BEGINS TO BEAT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE FRONT 
    DOOR.

                It s me! Mark.

    KATIE EMERGES FROM THE BATHROOM. SHE IS NOT QUITE FULLY 
      DRESSED, AND HER MASCARA IS A BIT SMUDGED. SHE HAS CLEARLY 
    BEEN CRYING, BUT IS MAKING AN EFFORT TO LOOK COMPOSED. 

    SHE IS HOLDING A BOX OF TISSUES

                Oh.

    SHE DABS AT IT. IT DOESN'T GO AWAY.

                                MARK

                Just saw Ben at the door.

                                  KATIE

                Really? Mark, you won't let Dingle 

                know Ben was here will you?

                                MARK

                                  KATIE

                Only, I don't think she's really 

                objective about Ben. So I took your 

                advice instead. You won't tell, will 

                you?

                Promise?

              I promise.

                                  KATIE

                Thanks, Mark. What would I do without 

                you?

    KATIE HUGS MARK WITH GREAT AFFECTION. MARK SMILES AS HE HUGS 
    HER BACK. SHE NOTICES HIS PANTS.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)

                Your pants are dirty.

                                MARK

                Oh, I spilled some coffee on myself, 

                it's noth&

                                  KATIE

                You'd better take them off or they'll 

              be ruined. I'll deal with that for 

                you.                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              40.



                                MARK

                Take them off&?

                      (tugging at Mark's belt)

                Mark, it's only me. Don't be shy. 

    MARK TAKES THEM OFF. HE IS WEARING RALPH LAUREN TIGHT FIT 
    TRUNKS. THEY DON'T SUIT HIM. 

                                  KATIE (CONT D)

                Let's see if I can get this off. Stay 

                right there.

    SHE GOES INTO THE KITCHEN. MUSIC VERY QUIETLY IN THE 
      BACKGROUND. 

    MARK LOOKS AROUND. HE LEANS AGAINST THE WALL AS IF DRUNK. 
      EVERYTHING GOES BLURRY AND STRANGELY ANGLED. HEARTBEAT ON THE 
      SOUNDTRACK. WE SEE KATIE, CLOSE UP FROM MARK'S POV. 

                                  KATIE (CONT D)

                You'd better take your pants off or 

                they'll be ruined. 

    SHE LOOKS DOWN. A LITTLE SMILE. HEARTBEAT BUILDS UP.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)

                I'll deal with that for you.

    SHE DESCENDS OUT OF VIEW. BEHIND HER STANDS DINGLE.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)

                Let's see if I can get this off.

                                  DINGLE

                Why haven't you got any pants on?

    SUDDEN CUT BACK TO REALITY. HEARTBEAT STOPS. DINGLE IS POISED 
    BUT OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED. JAMES STANDS BEHIND HER. THERE IS AN 
    AWFUL SILENCE.                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              41.



                                MARK

                Erm& I got coffee on them. Katie said 

                she'd wash them. I'm sorry.

    THEY STARE AT HIM INTENTLY

                                  DINGLE

                It's alright, Mark, you look quite 

                sexy.

    FOLLOW SUIT.

                                  JAMES

                She's right. And we'd have seen you in 

                your underpants before long anyway.

    MARK LAUGHS

                                  JAMES (CONT D)
                    (to Mark)

                What type are those? I might get some 

                myself.

                                MARK

                They're Ralph Lauren, tight-fit 

                trunks.

                                  JAMES

                Nice. Nice.

                                MARK

                Oh, yes. Stella. She had a Ph.D. in 

                  astrophysics. She was from Finland. I 

                met her on holiday in the Czech 

                Republic.

                                  JAMES
                      (correcting him)

                You mean Fiji.

                                MARK

                Yes, Fiji. Of course.

                                  DINGLE

              Do you still see her at all?

                No, never, she lives in Boston.

                                MARK

                Boston, England. She's English.

                                  DINGLE

              I thought she was from Finland. 

                                MARK 

                She's dead. She died. 

    PAUSE. JAMES AND DINGLE LOOK CONFUSED.                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              43.

                What happened to the sofa?

                crazy, but when I get into a new home 

              I like to try out the sofa. So while 

                Katie popped out and couldn't stop me 

                with her responsible ways, I put 

                "Stairway to Heaven" on the hi-fi, and 

                had a bit of a bounce.

    INT. THE APARTMENT - EVENING

    THE CAMERA STAYS CLOSE IN ON MARK AS HE ROUNDS THE DOOR OF 
    THE LOUNGE.

                                MARK

                Sorry. I'm a bit of a&.

    MARK FREEZES, AS HE LOOKS AT THE SITTING ROOM.

    THE SITTING ROOM IS REVEALED. ALL ABOUT THE SOFA ARE CRUMPLED 
    WODGES OF TISSUE PAPER. DINGLE HOLDS ONE AT ARM'S LENGTH. SHE 
      SUDDENLY DROPS IT IN DISGUST.

                                MARK (CONT D)

                Weirdo.

    DINGLE COMPOSES HERSELF.                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              45.



                                  DINGLE

                You must really like Led Zeppelin.

    JAMES ENTERS HOLDING A CLUMP OF TISSUES. 

                                  JAMES

                Who left tissues on our bed?

    HE STOPS AND LOOKS AT MARK, WHO IS STANDING IN HIS BOXER 
    SHORTS HOLDING THE TRAY OF TEA. JAMES DROPS THE TISSUES 
      SUDDENLY.  

    THEY ALL LOOK AT MARK.

                                  KATIE

                Look, there's been a&

                                MARK

                They're mine. They're all mine.

    JAMES LEAVES THE ROOM. THE OTHERS STARE IN SILENCE. 

                                MARK (CONT D)

              I&

                                  JAMES (O/S) 
                      (calling out loudly)

                They're in the bathroom too!

    ANOTHER LONG PAUSE. DINGLE AT LAST RAISES HERSELF TO SPEAK IN 
    A VERY CONTROLLED WAY. 

                                  DINGLE

                You wanked in every room?

    THEY STARE AT THE PILE AGAIN. THEY LOOK AT KATIE. SHE SHOULD 
      REPRIMAND HIM. KATIE LOOKS AT HIM.

                                  KATIE

                That's disgusting, Mark.

    DINGLE AND KATIE FILE OUT. KATIE GOES LAST, MAKING EYE 
    CONTACT WITH MARK AS SHE GOES.

    MARK STANDS THERE AMONGST THE TISSUES.                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              46.



    INT. KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

    MUSIC BEGINS. PERHAPS "THAT'S ALL" PLAYED BY BEN WEBSTER. 

    MARK AND KATIE ARE IN KATIE'S BED, SNUGGLING UP TO EACH 
    OTHER, FACE TO FACE, ALL BUT THEIR HEADS UNDER THE COVERS. 
    THIS IS ALL VERY PILLOW TALK. THEY LOOK LIKE THEY COULD BE 
    NAKED. 

    KATIE LEANS OVER TO THE BEDSIDE TABLE TO PICK UP THE CD BEN 
    GAVE HER EARLIER. SHE GIVES IT TO MARK. 

                                MARK

                The Beach Boys. Great.

                                  KATIE

                It's just to say sorry you got off to 

              a bad start with James and Dingle.

    MARK SMILES UP AT HER. THIS IS HEAVEN.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)

                You know what, I've come to a 

                decision. As much as I'm in love with 

                Ben I'm not going to let myself see 

                him again. It's over. Forever.

                                MARK
                      (punching the air)

                Yes!!!!

                                  KATIE

                What?

                                MARK

              I mean& I'm sorry. I hope you're OK. 

                Not too upset.                                 ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              47.



                                  KATIE

                I'll be OK. I've got you looking out 

                for me now, haven't I? 

    AN AFFECTIONATE MOMENT

                                  KATIE (CONT D)

                I'd better let you get to bed.

    SHE KISSES MARK ON THE CHEEK. MARK GETS OUT OF THE BED. HE 
    WAS FULLY CLOTHED UNDERNEATH THE COVERS, INCLUDING HIS SHOES. 
    KATIE STOPS HIM BEFORE THE DOOR.

                                  KATIE (CONT D)

                You know what my problem is. I've 

                never been able to make friends with a 

                boy without sleeping with him. That's 

                got to stop. From now on, I'm going to 

                have real male friends, where sex just 

                doesn't enter the equation. 

                                MARK

                That's great, Katie.

                                  KATIE

                I'm starting with you.

                                MARK
                      (resigned)

                That's even better.

                                  KATIE

                Night, Mark

                                MARK

                Goodnight.                                ROOMIES - "EPISODE ONE"              48.



    HE LEAVES AND CLOSES THE DOOR. WE HEAR A THUD AND A GRUNT 
    FROM OUTSIDE, AS IF SOMEONE IS BANGING HIS HEAD AGAINST THE 
    DOOR. 


                                      THE END
