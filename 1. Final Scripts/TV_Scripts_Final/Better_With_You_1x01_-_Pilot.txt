                  Ave. at 6th.  And can you crank up

                the heat?  She gets a little cold.

                                    MADDIE

                And I'm sorry but could you turn

                off the sports radio?  They'll say

                  something bad about the Giants and

                  then he'll have to call in and yell

                at "Bill from Trenton".

                                    BEN

                Oh, we're having Indian?

                                    MIA

                  Yeah, is that okay?

                                    CASEY

                  It's just there's this spice that's

                in every Indian dish that makes me --

                My sister's crazy about this guy --

                  says he's totally different from

                  guys she's dated before.  

                                    BEN

                  I got a real good feeling about

                  him.  He's a keeper.    "Pilot..."  3.

                  You're just sick of being saddled

                  with her every time we go out.

                                    BEN

                Do you know how hard it is to try

                and buy concert tickets for three

                  people?  It can't be done!

                                    MADDIE

                  I know you want this to work but

                  don't come on too strong and scare

                him off.  Do you think you can play

                it cool?

                                    BEN

                How do you think I got you?

                                    MADDIE

                You hounded me day and night until

                  I agreed to go out with you.

                  I know how close you are with your

                  sister.  I hope she likes me.

                  I really feel for Mia.  Those awkward

                  first few weeks when you're hoping

                  you've found someone, but you're

                  terrified they'll turn out to be a

                  creep, and you can't relax because

                you want to seem perfect. Nothing

                but worry and stress.

                                    BEN

                I'm so happy to be done with that. 

                New relationships suck.

  INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT (NIGHT 1)
  (BEN, CASEY, MADDIE, MIA, WAITRESS)

    MADDIE AND BEN CHECK IN WITH A WAITRESS.

                                    MADDIE

                Hi, reservation for four, under the

                  name Coles for eight o'clock?

                                    WAITRESS

                The rest of your party is at the

                  bar.  The table will be ready in a

                few minutes, Mrs. Coles.

                                    MADDIE

                Oh.  (RE: BEN)  No, he's Mr. Coles,

                but I'm not Mrs. Coles.  We're not

                  married.

                                    WAITRESS

                  (MORTIFIED)  Oh my God, so sorry.

                                    MADDIE

                  (GENUINE)  No, no, don't be.  

  THE WAITRESS MAKES A FACE, STILL WORRIED SHE'S STEPPED
  IN SOMETHING.    "Pilot..."  6.
    writer's draft - 1/8/10 (I/B)


                                    MADDIE (cont'd)

                For real.  There's no need for the

                  "sad eyes".  Neither of us wants to

                be married.  But we love each other,

                  we're committed, very happy.  Let

                me see your eyes again.

  THE WAITRESS LOOKS AT HER.

                                    MADDIE (cont'd)

                  Still sad.  Show me your "happy for

                the committed couple who made a

                  choice" eyes.

                                    WAITRESS

                  (AWKWARD)  It will just be a minute.

  THE WAITRESS MOVES OFF.

                                    BEN

                  That'll teach her for not having a

                  table ready.

                                    MADDIE

                  (OFF CELL PHONE)  I just got a text

                  from Mia.  (READS TEXT) "Here. 

                  Where R U?"  Why does that need to

                be texted?  We said we'd meet at 8. 

                  I don't get this generation's need

                for constant communication.

                                    BEN

                  You're only six years older.    "Pilot..."  7.

                                    MADDIE

                But it's a big six years.  None of

                the famous people her age wear

                  underwear.

  THEY MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE BAR.

                                    MADDIE (cont'd)

                  Okay, so remember you're gonna be

                  cool and for my part, I'm not gonna

                say anything critical.

                                    BEN

                  (PULLED UP)  You're not?  Then what

                are you gonna say?

                                    MADDIE

                  I will admit that in the past I

                  have been guilty of... overstating

                my opinion as it relates to my little

                  sister's choices.  But I have decided

                  that I am going to be supportive. 

                                    BEN

                  ("YEAH, RIGHT")  Great.  Then I am

                  going to be a black woman.

                                    MADDIE

                  (LOOKS AROUND)  I don't see them. 

                  Let's just grab this booth.

  THEY SIT ON ONE SIDE OF A BOOTH.  AFTER A BEAT, A COUPLE
  POPS UPS FROM UNDERNEATH THE TABLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF
  THE BOOTH, MAKING OUT AND OBLIVIOUS.  IT IS CASEY AND
  MIA.    "Pilot..."  8.

                  (SCANDALIZED)  Mia!

  MIA AND CASEY BREAK APART, A LITTLE EMBARRASSED.

                                    MADDIE (cont'd)

                Um, hello?  This is a public place!

                                    MIA

                You two, coatroom, cousin Beth's

                  wedding?  Your impressionable baby

                  sister walked in?

                                    MADDIE

                You were twenty-three.

                                    MIA

                Our brains are like sponges at that

                  age.  (DEEP BREATH)  Okay, I'd like

                you to meet -- (NOTICES CASEY HAS

                  LIPSTICK ON HIS NECK) after I give

                him a quick bath.

  SHE DABS A NAPKIN IN HER DRINK AND CLEANS HIM UP.

                                    MIA (cont'd)

                  This is Casey!  This is Ben and my

                  sister, Maddie.

    EVERYONE SHAKES.

                                    CASEY

                  (RE: BEN'S GRIP)  Whoa.  Strong

                  shake.  (TO MIA)  Better watch what

                  I say around him.  Tough guy.

  BEN LAUGHS, EMBARRASSED AND FLATTERED.    "Pilot..."  9.

                too long, way too much cologne, and

                  that leather bracelet?  (EXHALES,

  INT. MADDIE'S LAW OFFICE - NEXT DAY (DAY 2)
    (MADDIE, CLIENT, ASSISTANT, CASEY)

  WE ARE IN MADDIE'S FANCY CORPORATE OFFICE.  SHE IS
    USHERING A CLIENT OUT THE DOOR.

                                    MADDIE

                  It's complicated but I think this

                may be the best will I've ever drawn

                up.  I think you'll be very happy

                  when you drop dead.

  THE CLIENT EXITS.  MADDIE'S ASSISTANT POPS HER HEAD IN.

                                      ASSISTANT

                  Your sister is on the phone.

                  dying to know -- what did you think?

                                    MADDIE

                Oh my God!  Loved him!  Four and a

                Why not five stars?

                  (FIRM)  Five stars is reserved for

                  Prince William.  (THEN)  I'll be

                  honest: I went in trying not to be

                  critical, which was a little

                  difficult given certain leather

                  wrist accessories --

                                    MADDIE

                But then I really got him.  I like

                  him.  Ben likes him too.

                                    MIA

                  That I got. 

  WE SEE MIA IN A WIDER SHOT.  IT IS NOW CLEAR THAT IS
  SHE IN FACT SHOPPING.  AN UPBEAT SALESWOMAN APPROACHES,
    CARRYING A DRESS.

                  Where are you?  You said you were

                  working!

                  Three years of law school, six years

                  trying to make partner and yet you

                get paid while you shop -- there is

                no justice.

                  Look, if you didn't want to be tied

                to a desk you should have invented

                  something like me.

                                    MADDIE

                  (DRIVES HER CRAZY)  You didn't invent

                  anything!  You and your friends

                                    MIA (cont'd)

                  I feel much better now that I've

                  gotten your "sister stamp of

                  approval".  You'd know how much

                  that meant if you ever asked my

                  opinion about relationship stuff.

                                    MADDIE

                  Mia, you were fifteen when I started

                  dating Ben.  I asked your opinion,

                you were impressed that he could

                  drive at night.  (THEN)  But really,

                  really happy for you.  Casey seems

                  great.

                                    MIA

                And you normally think the guys I

                  date are crazy!

                                    MADDIE

                He doesn't seem crazy at all.

  JUST THEN CASEY POKES HIS HEAD IN.  MADDIE'S ASSISTANT
    GESTURES, "SHOULD I LET HIM IN?"

  CASEY GESTURES THAT SHE SHOULDN'T SAY HE'S THERE.

                  What?

                Oh my God, it's 11:34 and nothing

                  happened.  Something usually happens

                at this time but it didn't.  Weird,

                  huh?  Love ya bye!

  SHE HANGS UP AND WAVES CASEY IN.  END INTERCUT.  

                                    CASEY

                  Nice work -- you could get a job

                  with the CIA.  

                                    MADDIE

                Hi!

    MADDIE GOES TO GREET CASEY.  THERE'S AN AWKWARD BEAT
  WHERE THEY AREN'T SURE WHETHER TO SHAKE HANDS OR KISS. 
  THEY SETTLE FOR A HALF-HUG.

                                    CASEY

                  Sorry about that.  I didn't want

                  anyone to know I was here.  I, uh,

                  want your advice about Mia.  See, I

                  want to propose.

                                    MADDIE

                  Huh.  Guess you are crazy.

  AND WE...

                                            SCENE D

  INT. MADDIE AND BEN'S APARTMENT - LATER (NIGHT 2)
  (BEN, MADDIE, MIA, CASEY)

  THEIR LOFT IS AN INVITING, LIGHT-FILLED SPACE WITH A
  SMALL TERRACE.  BEN'S HAVING A BEER.  MADDIE ENTERS.

                                    BEN

                Hey babe, how was your day?

                                    MADDIE

                  Well, let's see.... I just got back

                  from ring shopping with Casey.

                                    BEN

                Is that to distract from the

                  bracelet?

                                    MADDIE

                  Engagement ring shopping.  He came

                to my office and wanted my advice

                on the best way to propose.

                                    BEN

                  What?!

                                    MADDIE

                  I know!  It's crazy right?!

                                    MADDIE

                It makes no sense -- so impulsive. 

                  (SHAKES HEAD)  These kids today.

                                    BEN

                  "These kids today"?  You should go

                on facebook and update your status

                to "old".

                                    MADDIE

                  I know I said I'd just be supportive,

                but I have to step in.

                                    BEN

                  I don't know... when you butt in... 

                it only makes her do the opposite. 

                  Remember when she was in college

                and you told her not to take that

                  Spanish class, what did she do?

                                    MADDIE

                  Major in Spanish.

                                    BEN

                  And?

                                    MADDIE

                Go to Spain for a year.

                                    BEN

                And now how does she pronounce the

                  name of the co-host on "The Today

                  Show"?    "Pilot..."  17.

                                    BEN

                  Exactly.  How did you leave things

                  with Casey?  

                                    MADDIE

                  I just tried to stall.  I suggested

                  ideas for the proposal that would

                  take a while to happen.  Like I

                  said it's always been Mia's dream

                to get engaged during the summer

                  Olympics but unfortunately they

                  aren't until 2012.  Stuff like that.

                                    BEN

                  (CHUCKLES)  That's so lame.

                                    MADDIE

                It was not my best work.  But I

                  just needed to buy some time.  (THEN) 

                  I have to talk to her.  Before

                  somebody does something rash.

    THERE'S A KNOCK.  MIA AND CASEY BURST IN, EXCITED.

                                    MIA

                  Casey just proposed!  We're engaged!

                  (EXAGGERATED ACCENT)  Dios mio.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                  Wow.  (TO CASEY, SLIGHTLY ACCUSATORY)

                You proposed.

                                    CASEY

                  I know, I'm sorry.  I so appreciated

                all your great ideas but I couldn't

                  wait for "the perfect moment."  I

                  couldn't wait another second.

                                    MIA

                Do you want to know how he did it?

                                    CASEY

                  summer Olympics, or an election

                  year or even a census year.

  BEN SHOOTS MADDIE A LOOK.  ASHAMED, SHE HANGS HER HEAD.

                  seven years but I hope you will

                  take me anyway.  I love you and I

                  can't wait to start our life

                  together.  Will you marry me?

                  ARM)  Third time you did it and I

                  still got chills.  (THEN, TO OTHERS) 

                  I made him do it in the elevator.

                  appreciate that.  Though some of

                  your ideas were a little wacky. 

                Why did you say I thought the

                  giving him a few pointers.  Coach

                him a bit?  Mom and Dad love you so

                you visited us at the house we'd

                  rent in Maine?  I cleared out of

                the bedroom so you two could be

                  together.  I slept in a rowboat!

                  telling my parents tomorrow.  They're

                way more critical than I am.  They

                  once made one of her boyfriends

                  cry.

                The point is they're gonna raise

                all the right objections so I won't

                  have to.  This is perfect -- I make

                her happy.  My parents tell her

                too young, then we wanted to get

                out of debt, establish our careers,

                  then all our friends got married,

                  then all our friends got divorced,

                and after a point what we had was

                so good, why rock the boat?  But I

                  don't know, are we missing something?

                                    BEN

                  Look, I love that we wake up every

                day and make the decision to be

                  together -- not because some piece

                of paper tells us to.  I think it's

                  very romantic.

  INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT (NIGHT 3)
  (BEN, CASEY, JOEL, MADDIE, MIA, VICKY)

    MADDIE, BEN, MIA AND CASEY ARE AT A TABLE.  THERE ARE
  TWO FREE SEATS BETWEEN MADDIE AND MIA.  MIA FIDGETS.

                                    CASEY

                (TO MIA)  Babe, you seem nervous.

                                    MIA

                  I just want this to go well.  I

                  love you -- I want them to love

                  you, too.

                                    MADDIE

                And they probably will.  But let's

                be realistic -- you can't expect

                  everyone to be a supportive as I

                am.

                                    MIA

                  When they come, let Mom sit next to

                  you.  I want her to be in a good

                  mood.

  THE PARENTS, JOEL AND VICKY PUTNEY (50'S-60'S, WELL-
    GROOMED, A BIT INTIMIDATING) APPROACH.

                                    MIA (cont'd)

                Oh God, here they are.  (TO CASEY)  
                                    (MORE)    "Pilot..."  32.
    writer's draft - 1/8/10 (II/J)


                                    MIA (cont'd)

                  Just be yourself.  (BLURTS)  But

                  better!  I'm sorry!  But I mean it!

                                    MADDIE

                (TO BEN, RE: HER MOM)  Aw, she's

                  wearing that scarf you got her.

                                    MIA

                (TO BEN)  Suck up.

                                    BEN

                  Jealous.

                                    MIA

                  (HATES HERSELF)  I am!

  JOEL AND VICKY ARRIVE AT THE TABLE.

                                    VICKY

                  Sorry we're late.  It took us forever

                to get here.  Your father is on a

                  huge walking jag.

                                    JOEL

                No, I'm on a huge "not paying for

                  taxis" jag because our net worth

                  went on a huge "losing seventy five

                  percent of itself" jag.  And you're

                on an "acting like it didn't happen"

                  jag.

                                    MIA

                  Well, if it helps dinner is on us

                  tonight.    "Pilot..."  33.
    writer's draft - 1/8/10 (II/J)


                                    VICKY

                  That's for sure.  He's started

                  "forgetting" his wallet at home.

                                    JOEL

                  (BAD ACTING, PATS HIMSELF)  Oh son

                of a gun, you're right.  I don't

                  have it.  

                                    MIA

                  (POINTS)  Mom, I thought you'd sit

                  there.

                                    VICKY

                  (GIDDY)  Next to Maddie!  

                                    CASEY

                  (SOTTO, TO BEN)  Wow, you weren't

                  kidding.

  BEN NODS.

                                    MIA

                  Okay.  Mom, Dad, this is Casey.

  CASEY GETS UP AND SHAKES THEIR HANDS.

                                    CASEY

                  Great to meet you, Joel.  Victoria.

    SURPRISED, THEY SHARE A LOOK.  BEN SHAKES HIS HEAD AND
    SLIDES HIS PURPLE INDEX CARD OVER TO CASEY.

                                    BEN

                  (JUMPING IN)  Mr. and Mrs. Putney!  

                                      JOEL/VICKY

                How are you, Ben?  Great to see

                  you.    "Pilot..."  34.
    writer's draft - 1/8/10 (II/J)


                                    BEN

                  Nice to see you getting some use

                out of that scarf.

                                    JOEL

                It really is beautiful.  I was

                  shocked no one on eBay wanted it.

                                    VICKY

                Oh, before I forget, Casey -- let

                me get your email.  I find it is

                the best way to communicate.

                                    CASEY

                It is facehumper, one word --

                                    MIA

                  (JUMPING IN)  He doesn't have an

                  email.

    A WAITRESS DELIVERS SOME CHAMPAGNE TO THE TABLE.

                                    VICKY

                Oh, this is nice.  What's the

                  occasion?

  MIA NUDGES MADDIE FOR HELP.  

                                    MADDIE

                Um, Mia has news.

  MIA TAKES A GLASS AND STANDS TO MAKE HER ANNOUNCEMENT.

                                    VICKY

                  (GASPS, SUPER-EXCITED)  Maddie and

                Ben are getting married!    "Pilot..."  35.
    writer's draft - 1/8/10 (II/J)


                                    MADDIE

                  What?  Why would that be Mia's news? 

                  That doesn't even make sense!

                                    MIA

                  Yeah, like I don't have anything of

                my own going on?

                                    MADDIE

                And all of a sudden you're desperate

                for us to get married?

                                    CASEY

                  Wait, you guys aren't married?  Why

                  not?

                                    BEN

                Not the time, buddy.

                                    VICKY

                I'm sorry.  I guess I misunderstood.  

                                    JOEL

                Can we please hear the news that I

                  walked eighty-five blocks for?

                                    MIA

                  Well, this is not the exact mood I

                  wanted to strike but I'm getting

                  married.

                                    VICKY

                To who?

                                    JOEL

                  (CORRECTING)  Whom.

  CASEY STANDS.    "Pilot..."  36.
    writer's draft - 1/8/10 (II/J)


                                    CASEY

                To me!

  HE HOLDS OUT HIS ARMS FOR A HUG.  NO ONE RESPONDS.  BEN
    STANDS AND HUGS HIM.

                                    BEN

                (IN THE HUG)  Sit down now.

    CASEY, BEN AND MIA SIT.

                                    MIA

                So that's the news.  I am settling

                  down... man of my dreams... (OFF

                  THEIR NON-RESPONSE)  Thoughts?

                                    MADDIE

                  (PROMPTING)  Pretty crazy, huh?

  VICKY AND JOEL LOOK AT EACH OTHER FOR A BEAT.  IT IS
  NOT CLEAR WHICH WAY IT IS GOING TO GO.  THEN...

                                    VICKY

                  It's wonderful.

                                    JOEL

                I'm so happy for you, pumpkin.

                                    MIA

                  Yay!

  SHE KISSES CASEY.

                                    MADDIE

                  (FLOORED)  Heh?

                                    VICKY

                  What a wonderful surprise!  You

                  found love!    "Pilot..."  37.
    writer's draft - 1/8/10 (II/J)


                                    MADDIE

                  (WITH JUDGMENT)  Yeah, like last

                  Tuesday.

                                    MIA

                  Sis, what are you doing here?

                                    MADDIE

                  (REELING)  Reacting to a shocking

                  lack of parental... mate-vetting. 

                  Where are the parents who made the

                  boyfriend cry?  This doesn't seem

                  insanely fast to you?

                                    JOEL

                  Well, not everyone is gonna wait

                  fifteen years.

                                    VICKY

                  (CHUCKLES)  Darling, stop.

                                    MADDIE

                Is that directed at me?

                                    JOEL

                No, it's directed at Kurt Russell

                and Goldie Hawn.

  THE PARENTS CHUCKLE. 

                                    MIA

                  Hey, guys, this is my moment.  I

                  just got engaged.  Make fun of Maddie

                  when she gets engaged.  In 2044.

  JOEL AND VICKY LAUGH.  CASEY JOINS IN.    "Pilot..."  38.
    writer's draft - 1/8/10 (II/J)


                                    MADDIE

                  You're new -- you don't get to laugh!

                                    VICKY

                  Don't be so sensitive, dear.  We've

                  come to accept your choices.

                                    MADDIE

                I'm sorry is our not being married

                  something you talk about?  

  MIA, JOEL AND VICKY NOD.

                                    MADDIE (cont'd)

                  You've never put any pressure on us

                at all.

                                    VICKY

                  Well, the therapist said --

                                    MADDIE

                  Therapist?  Therapists have been

                  consulted?!

                                    JOEL

                  I think we are getting off track. 

                  We're losing sight of the fact that

                our little Mia is gonna walk down

                the aisle... in what I trust will

                be an intimate, modest affair in

                  keeping with the financial realities

                of the day.

                                    MADDIE

                  Okay, well great.  Then let's just

                  celebrate.  (RAISES GLASS)  To haste!    "Pilot..."  39.
    writer's draft - 1/8/10 (II/J)


                                    BEN

                  (WARNING)  Honey.

                                    MADDIE

                I'm sorry but I can't understand

                why we're being mocked.  Call me

                  old-fashioned but I think it's

                  appropriate to apply a little thought

                  before making huge life choices. 

                But you?  You get an idea in your

                  head and you need to jump

                  immediately.  There's no patience

                  anymore.  Everybody needs instant

                  gratification.  I blame the internet!  

                                    MIA

                  Where is this coming from?  You

                  helped Casey plan the proposal.

                                    MADDIE

                  I didn't want to be the bad guy but

                  I thought (RE: PARENTS) somebody

                  would have the sense to say this is

                  crazy. I mean you haven't even been

                  together long enough for you to

                  feel comfortable telling him how

                  much his leather bracelet sucks.

                  Nah, can't be that one.    "Pilot..."  40.
    writer's draft - 1/8/10 (II/J)


                                    MIA

                We may not have been together long,

                but we know each other.

                                    MADDIE

                  Really?  What's his favorite movie? 

                  Favorite color?  Flavor of ice cream?

                                    BEN

                  Hey, we've been together nine years

                and we don't even know stuff like

                  favorite ice cream.

                                    MADDIE

                  I absolutely know your favorite ice

                  cream.

                                    BEN

                  How?  I don't even have a favorite.

                                    MADDIE

                  Mint chip.

                                    BEN

                  (REALIZES, AMAZED)  It is mint chip.

                                    MIA

                  This is so insulting.  Does it make

                No, I'm sorry, why in the world

                  does she have to get married right

                  now?!

                  Yes, I'm sorry I didn't mention it

                  earlier -- I was trying to think of

                the perfect way for Ben to say it.

                                    CASEY

                the big secret," on your card.

                  Well, sure.  You just loooove

                  everything.

                                    MIA

                  Yes, I'm happy!  Very happy!  Over

                the frickin' moon -- (TO CASEY, RE:

                  BEN)  I can't believe you told him!

                                    CASEY

                I'm sorry!  We were bonding... he

                was giving me all this advice... it

                was real early in the morning.

                                    JOEL

                (TO CASEY) So you knocked up one

                  daughter (TO BEN) and you won't

                  marry the other.  A couple of princes

                  here.  Does one of you want to hold

                me down while the other kicks me in

                the stomach?

                                    MIA

                  Wonderful.  (TO CASEY, BEN, MADDIE) 

                  Thank you, and you, and you for

                  orchestrating this precious moment.

                                    MADDIE

                  Would I have said anything if I'd

                  known you were pregnant?  Why didn't

                you tell me the truth?    "Pilot..."  44.

                                    MIA

                  Because I was worried you would be

                  judgmental and not supportive --

                  exactly how you've been tonight! 

                Of course you didn't really think

                us getting married so soon was a

                  good idea -- it's not exactly what

                  you've done, so it must be wrong!

                                    CASEY

                (TO THE PARENTS)  You guys should

                  know, marrying, having a kid...

                  it's all stuff we know we would

                  have done eventually. This just

                  speeds things up a little.

                                    JOEL

                  (SOFTENING)  Well, if there's one

                  thing our reversals of the last

                  year have taught us, it's that life

                is short, and you should grab all

                the joy you can find when you find

                it.  That and how depressing powdered

                  milk tastes.

                                    VICKY

                And this truly is joyous.  There's

                so much to look forward to.  I wanna

                  talk about the wedding and (MELTS)

                  a grandchild!  Maddie, switch seats

                so Mia can sit next to me.    "Pilot..."  45.

                  (SOTTO, TO BEN)  That seems major.

                                    BEN

                  (SOTTO)  Huge.  Never happened.

  BEN STANDS AS WELL.

                  Sorry, kids, but we still haven't

                  ironed out the matter of the bill.

  INT. TAXICAB - LATER (NIGHT 3)
  (BEN, CASEY, MADDIE, MIA)

  BEN IS IN THE FRONT SEAT OF A CAB.  CASEY IS IN THE
  BACK, SANDWICHED BETWEEN THE TWO SISTERS WHO STARE OUT
  THEIR RESPECTIVE WINDOWS, NOT TALKING.

                                    CASEY

                  Wow, this is tense.

  NO ONE RESPONDS.

                                    CASEY (cont'd)

                  Sometimes when you say "this is

                  tense" it breaks the tension.  (BEAT) 

                But clearly not in this case.

    ANOTHER BEAT.

                                    MADDIE

                  (BREAKING DOWN)  It's because you're

                  upset with me -- I did this.  (TO

                  BELLY)  I'm sorry, baby.  I'm not

                  usually like this.  I just felt so

                  attacked --  everyone was judging

                our relationship and I had no idea

                and I'm no longer the favorite which

                of course doesn't matter but sadly

                  does.  Don't judge me, baby. I need

                you on my side.

  SHE LOOKS AT MIA.

                                    MADDIE (cont'd)

                I'm so sorry I ruined your big night. 

                Who am I to say what's right for

                  you?  I clearly don't know anything.

                                    MIA

                  That's not true.  You're very smart.  

                                    MADDIE

                  (WEEPY)  I just test well.  (THEN) 

                  I think part of it is -- it feels

                  weird you doing something first.  I

                  normally blaze the trail for you. 

                I'm your big sister.  That's my

                  job.    "Pilot..."  48.

                                    MIA

                But you've done that -- what you

                two have -- that's what I've wanted

                for years.  

    A BEAT AS MADDIE ABSORBS THIS.

                                    MADDIE

                Can I...? 

  SHE REACHES ACROSS AND PUTS HER HAND ON MIA'S STOMACH.

                                    MIA

                  (SHEEPISH)  Yeah, I lied.  It's way

                too soon to feel the baby kick.  I

                was just trying to stop the fight. 

                  You're just touching my Spanx.

                                    MADDIE

                  (IMPRESSED)  Manipulative but

                  effective.

                                    MIA

                Be honest with me.  Having all this

                  happen at once -- a marriage, a

                  baby -- do you think I'm making a

                  mistake?

                                    MADDIE

                  I think one of the best things about

                you is that you are fearless.  You

                  just go for it.  I wish I could be

                  more like that instead over-analyzing

                  every decision to death.  (THEN) 

                Do you think I am making a mistake?    "Pilot..."  49.

                  (VERY TOUCHED)  You want my opinion? 

                Oh my God -- I've dreamed of this

                  day.  You want to know what I think!

                                    MADDIE

                So what do you think?

                                    MIA

                  (STILL THRILLED)  No idea!  

                                    MADDIE

                You know we never got to eat. Wanna

                  grab some food and we can talk about

                  your wedding dress?

                                    MIA

                  Fun!  I would love that.  I think

                  I'll probably just end up altering

                  mom's dress.  (OFF HER FACE)  What? 

                You look judgmental again.  You

                  hate that idea?

                                    MADDIE

                No, I love it.  That's why I always

                  said if I got married that's what I

                  would wear.

  IT GETS TENSE AGAIN.

                                    CASEY

                Oh, we were so close.  (GETS AN

                  IDEA, HAND ON MIA'S STOMACH)  Hey,

                  I think the baby's kicking again.
