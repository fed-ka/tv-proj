
	A crowd of bystanders and news crews has gathered around
	to watch firefighters try to contain the blaze.  A
	NEWSCASTER stands nearby giving her viewers a
	play-by-play.

				NEWSCASTER
		And yet another case of arson has
		drawn firefighters to the Riverview
		area.  That makes six in the last
		twenty-four hours and still
		Metropolis Fire Department
		officials have no leads.

	She listens to her earphone.

				NEWSCASTER
			(continuing)
		I'm getting word now that there is
		a custodian trapped inside the
		building on the top floor.  The
		engine ladders aren't tall enough
		to reach him and the building's
		stairwells are engulfed in flames.
		There doesn't appear to be any way
		to get him out.

	Behind her the crowd starts to look up and react.

				VARIOUS CROWD VOICES
		Superman!  It's Superman!  He's got
		him! etc.

	The newscaster tries to spot the action but too many
	things are happening at once.

				NEWSCASTER
		It seems that Superman has been
		able to reach the man in question
		and -- over here...

	She walks to where a crowd has gathered along the
	sidewalk.  Everyone cheers as Superman comes out of the
	burning building, a 72-year-old Custodian in his arms.
	They are both blackened from the fire and smoke.  As
	Superman hands the Custodian to an awaiting Paramedic, he
	pats the old man on the shoulder.

				SUPERMAN
		You'll be okay now.

				NEWSCASTER
		Superman!

	Superman turns to face the Newscaster and the cameras.

				NEWSCASTER
			(continuing)
		You've been helping the fire
		department all day.  Any idea who
		could be behind the fires?

				SUPERMAN
		No, not yet.  We've been too busy
		fighting them.

				NEWSCASTER
		We're hearing rumors the arsons
		might be gang related.  Any
		comment?

	In the b.g. we hear SIRENS and ENGINES ROLLING OUT.

				B.G. VOICE
		Fire at Hobs and 8th!

				SUPERMAN
			(answering)
		I'm sure the proper authorities are
		trying everything they can to find 
		out.  Now, if you'll excuse me.

	Superman hurries off revealing firemen behind him, dousing
	the spreading flames with water, creating...

				GIRL #1 (PRELAP)
			(singing-off-key)
		Psssssss ... Steamed Heat, I got...



	Geographically the same as the model except that
	everything is seedy and run down.  We HEAR a FIRE ENGINE
	SIREN in the distance.


	9. 



	The same fire engine ROARS by the club, on its way to
	another emergency.  The large neon sign looks worn in
	daylight.  Several shiny sedans are parked out front.



	Clark kicks open the back stage door.  He carries a
	struggling Lois over his shoulder.

				LOIS
			(manic whisper)
		You'll pay for this, Kent, I swear
		you'll--

				CLARK
			(under his breath)
		King, remember?

	He spots a row of dumpsters.  He looks back at the stage
	door where Lou is watching.  They talk softly so he won't
	hear.

				LOIS
		Why are you doing this?

				CLARK
		So she'll quit looking for a leak.
		At least my cover's still safe.

				LOIS
		Well, Merry Christmas and Happy New
		Year.

				CLARK
		Believe me, this is for your own
		good.

	Her eyes grow wide as they approach an-open dumpster.

				LOIS
		No...

	He drops her in.

				LOIS
			(screaming)
		No!!

				CLARK
			(loudly)
		And stay out.

	He wipes his hands and walks back to Lou.  As he reaches
	the door, a head of rotten lettuce hits the wall next to
	him.

				LOU
			(smiling)
		I guess we won't be hearing from
		her no more.

				CLARK
			(sighs, to himself)
		Speak for yourself.

	Toni looks out over the city as Clark comes up behind her.

				CLARK
		That was delicious.

	He looks out at Metropolis as well.

				CLARK
			(continuing)
		No Toaster fires tonight.

				TONI
		They wouldn't dare.

				CLARK
		Have you found something out?
			(off her silence)
		if I don't know what's going on how
		can I help?

				TONI
		Why should I trust you?  I hardly
		know you.

				CLARK
		In your position I'd probably feel
		exactly the same way.

				TONI
			(ruefully)
		My position.  Sometimes I think I
		could cheerfully trade it all for a
		quiet life far away from
		Metropolis.  Growing up I used to
		sit at my father's knee and listen
		to him talk.  I learned so much but
		I never thought I'd have to apply
		it.  If my brother's hadn't turned
		out to be such idiots...

				CLARK
		I thought you enjoyed running
		things?

				TONI
		Someone had to.  Let me tell you,
		Charlie.  I don't want to run a
		crime syndicate.  I want to run a
		conglomerate.  In five years, if I
		have my way, all Metro business is
		going to be legitimate.  A
		legitimate corporation with me as
		CEO.  I want to take what my father
		started and make him proud, put our
		name up there with the captains of
		commerce, the Lansings, the
		Schwabs, the Luthors.  No more
		dirty money, no more shady deals.

				CLARK
		Sounds like a good plan.

				TONI
		If I can just get past this thing
		with the Toasters.

				CLARK
		You will.
			(a double meaning)
		We will.

				TONI
		Maybe.  But not tonight.  I have a
		prior engagement.  Disappointed?

				CLARK
		Nope.  It'll just give me something
		to look forward to.

				TONI
			(turning to go)
		You're full of surprises, Charlie.

	She leaves.

		If you only knew.

					CUT TO:


	As Toni exits the building, Lois comes out of the shadows
	and follows her, a safe distance behind.

					CUT TO:



	The building that was on fire in the very first scene is
	still standing, but barely. A large sign has been posted:
	"Future LexHarbor Development Site," along with a drawing
	of an ultra-modern building.  Toni slips into the
	condemned shell.  She now carries a briefcase. After a
	beat, Lois appears.  She goes around to the back of the
	building.



	Superman steps out, looks around, then takes off into the@
	sky.

					CUT TO:


	CLOSE ON A CAR... as it explodes into a ball of fire.


52	THE TOASTERS	52

	march down the center of the street, a trail of burning
	cars raging behind them.  Fear has cleared the streets of
	traffic.  The Toasters pause before a storefront.

				TOASTER #1
		Gentlemen, I'd like to propose a
		toast.

	All begin to adjust their weapons.


53	CLOSE ON A TOASTER	53

	The dial moves from "Light" all the way up to "Toast,"
	accompanied by a WHINE of the gun charging..


54	BACK TO SCENE	54

	All are now fully charged.

				TOASTER #I
		Let's cook.

				SUPERMAN (O.S.)
		You know what they say about people
		who play with fire?

	They turn to see Superman standing behind them.

				TOASTER 01
		Yeah, they get burned.

	At his signal, the Toasters direct their maximum fire
	towards Superman.  The bullets strike.  He's seemingly
 	engulfed in flames. But when the smoke clears, he's fine.

				SUPERMAN
		It's about time someone cooled you
		guys off.

 	Using his SUPER COLD BREATH, he directs streams of
 	frigid air towards them.


55	CLOSE ON THE WEAPONS	55

 	... encased in ice.


56	THE TOASTERS	56

	... are also frozen in place.

				TOASTER #1
		Hey! You can't leave us like this!
		It's cold.

				SUPERMAN
		The police are on their way. I'm
		sure they'll have a nice toasty
		cell waiting for you.

 	And with that he's gone up into...


57	THE SKY	57

 	... where Superman HOVERS above the city.  Below him the
	fires continue to spread.  Off in the distance he spots...


58	A STORM	58

	... wind, rain, thunder, and lightning.


	46. 


59	SUPERMAN	59

	at SUPER SPEED he flies to the edge of the storm, 
	and uses SUPER BREATH to blow it toward Metropolis.
