The sultry dampness of a blistering summer hangs in the night
air. People stroll the boardwalk looking for a cool breeze.
The soft rhythms of a jazz concert float from the band shell.
CLOSE SHOT - A PAIR OF SEXY HIGH HEELS
and a woman's shapely legs, walking along the wooden pier.
OPENING TITLES & CREDITS OVER.
After several steps, a discarded piece of gum sticks to one
of her shoes, stretching out stickily. Two steps later, a
piece of paper sticks to the gum, flopping awkwardly with
each step.
The MOVING CAMERA PANS UP her gorgeous legs and sensuous
body. She wears a loose summer dress that floats like gossamer
around her soft curves. Her hair is long and blond.
NED (V.O.)
To some guys, women are like a cheap
puzzle... with pieces that just don't
fit. They think the soul of a woman
is darker than a back alley... more
tangled than a telephone cord... and
colder than a Klondike Bar in Canada.
But those guys don't even have a
clue.
She stops at the railing. We see an incredibly beautiful
face and cool, alluring eyes. This is LOLA CAIN. The term
"femme fatale" was coined for her. She's on display... and
knows it.
NED (V.O.)
When you know women the way I do,
you understand exactly what what
makes them tick... what makes them
hum... what makes them jiggle up and
down when they walk. And it's not
the kind of thing you can learn from
a correspondence course.
The CAMERA MOVES with her as she walks on, passing TWO MEN
whose eyes are glued to her. We HOLD ON THEM.
One is NED RAVINE, in his thirties, stalwart, handsome, hair
trimmed neatly, but with a feel of loose ends about him...
coat slung over his shoulder, sleeves rolled up, the sweat
dampening his shirt. He's a cop. A plain clothes detective
who's been around the block a few times and still gets lost.
Next to him is ARCH, his partner. Older, if not in years, at
least in mileage. Dependable, solid, with no great aspirations
except to reach the end of a shift intact. He's eating Nachos
from a cardboard container, licking the cheese off his
fingers.
The CAMERA PUSHES IN to NED. His eyes are fixed on Lola.
ANGLE - LOLA - NED'S POV
She walks to the other side of the pier... as more paper
sticks to the gum on her shoe. She stands at the railing.
NED (V.O.)
There are two kinds of women in this
world... and I've known 'em both.
ANGLE - ARCH
Arch heaves an exasperated sigh and looks toward Ned. The
CAMERA PULLS BACK to INCLUDE NED. It isn't "voice-over"
narration at all. Ned is actually talking out loud.
NED (V.O.)
One will take you for a fast ride on
a bumpy road with no seat belt. But
the other kind...
ARCH
(interrupts)
Jeez... knock off the chatter, will
ya.
NED
Just trying to keep you awake, Arch.
ARCH
I'm awake! Where do you come up with
all that crap about women?
NED
It's true. Women are very complex,
but if you know how to read 'em...
they're an open book. You can always
tell the rotten apples from the
peaches.
ARCH
Are you kiddin'?
NED
I'd stake my career on it. Anybody
ever proves me wrong, I'll throw
away my badge.
ARCH
Aayyhh... women are trouble...
NED
I used to believe that too. Until I
married Lana. Now, she... is a peach.
ARCH
Yeah, well you're a lucky stiff,
pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a
beautiful wife waitin' for ya at
home. Everything a guy could ever
want, including NO kids.
NED
I'd love to have kids.
ARCH
What?! Rug-rats? Give me a break!
(looks around)
Jeez, I hate stakeouts. What makes
you think Milo's gonna show up here?
NED
Logic. He knocked off all those banks.
He's got cash. He's gonna want to
spend it. This is one of the few
places that still takes cash. Sooner
or later... he's gotta turn up.
ARCH
And how we s'posed to recognize this
scumbag?
NED
The "Support Hose Bandit"? When you
see him... you'll know him.
In the b.g., MILO CRUMLEY, the "Support Hose Bandit", ambles
by casually, unnoticed, sucking on a cherry Snow-Cone through
the panty-hose pulled down over his head.
ARCH
These are the best damn Nachos in
North America. Maybe the world!
He pops the last chip in his mouth, licks his fingers and
turns the container over.
ARCH
I'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill.
You want some?
Ned shakes his head. Arch heads off to the Nacho stand. Ned
steps over to the railing... gazes out at the ocean.
A SAXOPHONE begins to wail a scorching, romantic melody... a
recurrent tune that will come to be known as LOLA'S THEME.
A beat later... Lola moves to Ned's side at the railing. He
tries to ignore her presence, peering into the darkness.
Lola digs in her purse for a pack of cigarettes.
LOLA
Got a light?
NED
Sure.
Ned pulls out a small flashlight, shines it in her purse.
She pulls a cigarette out of the pack, puts it to her lips...
her eyes on Ned, sizing him up.
LOLA
How about a match?
NED
No thanks. I have plenty.
He pulls out a handful of matchbooks, shows her, then stuffs
them back in his pocket.
He turns and walks along the pier. She falls into step beside
him, lighting her own cigarette. A saxophone player named
DIZZY follows behind them, continuing to play. He's the actual
source of the romantic THEME MUSIC we've been hearing.
LOLA
You really are incredibly stupid,
aren't you? I like that in a man.
NED
I'd be insulted, but I know you're
serious.
LOLA
You sound so sure of yourself.
NED
I'm not as dumb as I look.
LOLA
Let me buy you a drink, Mr. uh...
NED
Ravine. Ned Ravine. And you are...?
LOLA
Thirsty. What about that drink?
NED
I'm on duty.
LOLA
Brain surgeon?
NED
Cop.
LOLA
Oooo... and I bet you have a big
gun.
NED
You lose.
Lola looks toward a nearby hot dog vendor.
LOLA
If I can't buy you a drink...
(nods toward vendor)
...let me buy you one of those.
NED
Who can say no to a weiner?
LOLA
Not me.
Lola turns to the hot dog VENDOR, raising two fingers.
LOLA
Two dogs. Hot.
She takes them... hands one to Ned. He picks up the plastic
mustard container to put mustard on her hot dog first.
NED
You come here often?
LOLA
Only when I'm in heat.
Ned REACTS to this, squeezing the container. A stream of
mustard squirts out, hitting the front of Lola's dress.
NED
Oh! Sorry.
Flustered, he stuffs his hot dog into his inside jacket
pocket, then tries to wipe the mustard off Lola's dress,
smearing it all over her, making it worse. She watches him
with a cool, detached gaze as he fumbles ingenuously.
Suddenly, Ned stops, looking off. He sees... Milo Crumley
going into the PUBLIC RESTROOM. Ned starts to leave. Lola
grabs his hand, holding it tightly against her breast.
LOLA
Where ya going?
NED
Get something to wipe it off.
LOLA
That's okay. You're doing just fine.
NED
I'll get you a wet paper towel.
He heads for the men's room... signaling to Arch, who's
waiting in line at the Nacho stand. Arch motions at the long
line... all UNIFORMED COPS... shrugging helplessly.
Milo bursts out, colliding with Arch. They both go down in a
flurry of Nacho chips and cheese. Arch helps Milo to his
feet, apologizing profusely... picking up the gun that Milo
dropped, handing it back to him. Milo sprints off down the
pier.
A beat later, Ned bursts out the door... dashing after Milo.
ANGLE - ALONG THE PIER
Milo runs frantically, knocking people aside! He ducks into...
Large. Expensive. Impressive. The name on the mailbox reads
"Ned and Lana Ravine."
We begin to HEAR the O.S. SOUND of passionate lovemaking!
OMIT
Sequence omitted from original script.
DISSOLVE TO:
Ned glances at the white van parked in the driveway, then
takes note of his wife's silver Mercedes... sitting on floor
jacks, the hood raised, tools spread out around it.
He pulls her outside, nodding toward a line of tall PINE
trees behind the house. They are all straight and even...
except one, whose tall branches tower conspicuously above
the rest.
He holds up a chainsaw, nodding toward the trees. Shaking
and tearful... she backs into the house.
END FLASHBACK
BACK TO LAURA
SCREAMING out in terror! Ned rushes in, shaking her.
NED
Laura. Laura! What is it?
LAURA
(coming out of it)
I'm okay, I'm okay. I just get a
bit... claustrophobic... in the
bathroom.
NED
Maybe we should try some prune juice.
He gives her shoulder a consoling squeeze, then exits. She
shakily straightens the towels and regains her composure.
Ned opens a wardrobe closet in his office. He walks along,
looking at thirty exactly identical blue suits, hanging
neatly. Laura follows behind him. He stops and stares,
indecisive.
LAURA
Wear the blue one.
Frank glances back up at the bedroom window with an arrogant
smirk. WHAP! Ned's shoe hits him right in the face!
Ned comes down the courthouse steps. He pauses in the street,
glimpsing the back of a WOMAN passing nearby... a STUNNING
BLOND decked out in a clinging dress and fashionable hat...
a long strip of toilet paper trailing from her high heel
shoe. It must be LOLA. He turns to watch her.
A HORN BLARES! BRAKES SCREECH! The SOUND OVERLAPS to...
Laura's Husband scrambles up onto the deck, looking fore and
aft. Laura's vanished! He looks out to sea, calling...
LAURA'S HUSBAND
Lau-raaaaa!
Laura paddles ashore, grasping a little kid's inflatable
float ring. She struggles onto the sand and looks out to
sea, triumphant... tossing the plastic float aside.
MONTAGE - ULTRA CONTEMPO BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
-- Laura rushes in, tracking water all through the house.
-- Laura cuts an inch of hair from her amazingly long, very
wet tresses, then puts on a WIG... that is also LONG and
WET!
-- Laura retrieves a bra and a package of Twinkies from a
secret hiding place... and stuffs them into a small brown
paper bag.
-- Laura hurriedly mops up her water tracks, then...
-- She uses an industrial buffer to wax the hardwood floor.
-- Laura removes her wedding ring... throws it in the toilet.
She reaches for the handle to flush it... hesitates, seeing
the "CONSERVE WATER - THIS MEANS YOU!" sticker on the toilet.
She reaches into the bowl and retrieves the ring.
-- On the deck, Laura throws the wedding ring toward the
ocean. A SEAGULL swoops down, snatching it in mid-air and
flies off.
OMIT
Sequence omitted from original script.
-- In the bathroom... the Seagull flies in through the open
window, lands on the back of the toilet and drops the ring...
into the toilet bowl!
Laura's Husband reaches into the surf and picks up the
deflated float ring. He looks at it with a cruel sneer.
The two cars enter a long drive, coming to a stop near a
large two story house surrounded by lush greenery.
Ned climbs out... his wind-blown hair flattened on one side
and sticking out crazily.
ANGLE - LOLA'S CAR DOOR - NED'S POV
It opens. Lola's legs swing out. The CAMERA PANS DOWN her
long legs to her feet. The car floormat is stuck to one shoe.
She casually shakes it off... going to the front door.
Lola clicks on a porch light. She and Ned step out. Dozens
of small boxes hang around the perimeter of the porch.
LOLA
My wind chimes.
Ned steps over, running his hands along the boxes. They "thud"
against each other.
NED
You know, these would work a lot
better if you took them out of the
boxes.
He slips several boxes off, releasing clusters of the metal
chimes. They "tinkle" and "clang" melodically in the breeze.
LOLA
Well well... I guess you have been
around. I'm impressed.
She moves close, coming on to him. Ned feels uneasy.
NED
Why don't we take a look at those...
papers?
LOLA
(remembering)
Papers. Right.
Ned opens the door, pauses, turns... as Lola joins him there.
She looks into his eyes with desire.
LOLA
You're not so tough. Last chance.
She moves her lips close to his, about to kiss him. Then...
NED
No thanks. I got a cold shower and a
wife who trusts me waiting at home.
LOLA
What's the matter? Don't you want
me? It's the way I look, isn't it?
He steps out, pauses... turns to her.
NED
Don't forget to lock up.
Ned pulls the door shut. The lock CLICKS. He pauses by his
car, realizing something, heaves a sigh, goes back to the
door.
He tries the knob, but the door is locked. He looks through
the small window. He sees Lola standing inside... breathing
heavily, bracing herself against the staircase bannister,
hand to her heaving chest as if to calm a pounding heart.
He pushes against the door. It won't budge. He goes to the
large window, gazing inside. She slides one hand enticingly
across her breast and thigh, striking a seductive pose.
He points toward the door, motioning for her to unlock it.
She looks away. Frustrated, Ned tries the window. It's locked.
He picks up a wrought iron chair, SLAMS it into the window!
The heavy chair falls apart. The glass doesn't even vibrate!
He sees a riding power mower in the driveway... jumps into
the seat, starts the engine... barreling toward the front of
the house! THUNDER CRASHES and LIGHTNING FLASHES in the sky!
He PLOWS into the side of the house, SMASHING a huge hole
thru the wall!... MOWING a swath in the carpet!
Lola GASPS. Ned climbs off the mower, moving toward her. She
opens her arms, breathless. The MUSIC SWELLS dramatically!
She intercepts him, embracing him passionately.
LOLA
I knew you'd come back...
NED
(looking past her)
I forgot my car keys.
He struggles free, grabbing his car keys from the hall table.
She follows, embracing him again, even more tenaciously.
LOLA
That's not what you came back for.
NED
Yes it is.
Impatient, she crushes her mouth against his, kissing him
hard, desperately clawing at his clothes. She's relentless...
devouring him with her lips and tongue.
Overwhelmed, he succumbs to her passion. His car keys drop
from his hand. She pushes him down toward the floor.
LOW ANGLE - AT FLOOR LEVEL
Her hands grasp his shirt, ripping it open. The buttons fly
in all directions! She grabs at his leather belt, twisting
it in her hands... ripping it in two!
She grabs his pants by the cuffs... rips one pant leg off!
Then the other!... tossing them over each shoulder!
Ned and Lola tumble across the floor, arms and legs
entangled... rolling themselves up in a rug in the process.
ANGLE - FIREPLACE
A roaring fire. We HEAR O.C. MOANING and HEAVY BREATHING.
The CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a sheepskin rug in front of the
fireplace. No one is there! A crystal vase falls, CRASHING
on the stone hearth. The CAMERA TILTS UP to REVEAL Ned and
Lola... stretched out on the mantle, ravishing each other.
ANGLE - THE REFRIGERATOR
The door suddenly BURSTS OPEN! Ned and Lola tumble out...
wrapped in each other's arms, food tumbling out with them.
OMIT
Sequence omitted from original script.
ANGLE - THE DINING ROOM TABLE
The table wiggles. The CAMERA MOVES UP to REVEAL Ned and
Lola kissing passionately. She lays on the table, arms and
legs stretched upward... a spinning plate balanced on the
pointed finger of each hand... and a large spinning platter
balanced on the end of her pointed left toe. Her right foot
brushes the platter to keep it spinning. The Ed Sullivan
Show position.
SEVERAL ANGLES - IN BED
-- Ned and Lola's entangled legs, moving under the sheets.
-- Ned sitting, wrists tied to the brass bed with silk
scarves.
-- Lola, also with her wrists tied to the bed with silk
scarves.
-- Then... A WIDER ANGLE... revealing that they are BOTH
tied... at opposite ends of the same bed!
ANGLE - THE BASEMENT STAIRS
Wrapped in each other's arms, they tumble down the stairs...
crashing into a workbench, still kissing passionately!
ANGLE - A WALL SOCKET
Ned's hand plugs in a cord. RACK FOCUS to a soft lamb's wool
BUFFER WHEEL rising into frame, WHIRRING. It dips into an
open can of FLOOR WAX... then moves over to Lola's naked
body, buffing the surface of her skin to a high gloss. The
CAMERA MOVES to her EYES. They're CROSSED in ecstasy.
ANGLE - THE BEDROOM FLOOR
HEAVY BREATHING. SQUEAKY BED NOISES. The CAMERA MOVES up
along the mattress. The bed moves with a jerky rhythm. The
CAMERA REVEALS Lola's hand, grasping the sheet tightly. WE
MOVE UP to Lola, lying face down against the pillow.
LOLA
(breathless)
...don't... stop...
FULL SHOT - THE BED
Ned jumps up and down on the bed like a trampoline! Lola is
on her stomach, bouncing each time Ned's feet hit the bed.
LOLA
...Oh Ned... please... don't...
stop...
He does a complete BACK FLIP!... then keeps bouncing.
The wind blows. THUNDER and LIGHTNING! RAIN pours down.
Ned and Lola, both in yellow rain slickers, ravish each other
lustfully on the roof, sliding down the incline of shingles.
Oblivious to the peril, they slip right over the edge!
They hang from the eaves trough, each clutching it with one
hand while still holding one another with their free arms...
kissing passionately. The trough breaks! They fall!
ANGLE - THE GROUND BELOW
They roll out of the bushes onto the lawn, arms and legs
entangled. They fall apart, gasping for breath. A beat.
LOLA
That takes care of foreplay.
Ned's eyes widen. Lola grins lustily, rolling on top of him.
Two huge iron doors swing open and a mob of milling REPORTERS
rushes forward, surrounding Max Shady. He wears a blue suit
just like Ned's. The Reporters have no microphones, but shove
their empty hands at Max as if they do. They shout questions.
REPORTER #1
Mr. Shady! What's the first thing
you're gonna do now that you're out?
MAX SHADY
Find Ned Ravine... rip his head off
and use it for a bowling ball!
REPORTER #2
Are you a good bowler?
REPORTER #3
You ever bowled a three-hundred game?
REPORTER #4
How would you handle a seven-ten
split?
REPORTER #1
Say, aren't you wearing one of
Ravine's "trademark" blue suits?
MAX SHADY
Yeah. The bastard gave it to me as a
gift... to make up for losing my
case. Now I'm going to wear it to
his friggin' funeral!!
Shady sees someone o.s., waves like a gleeful little kid.
MAX SHADY
Ma!
Lana is seated on a park bench wearing a trenchcoat, hat and
sunglasses. Frank walks up, looks around nervously, pretending
not to know Lana. He sits down next to her.
FRANK
How come we gotta meet here?
LANA
We have to be careful now. We can't
risk being seen together at the house
or someone might connect us to the
murder later on.
She hands him a hat.
LANA
Here... put this on.
She takes her sunglasses off, looks at him. He hesitates,
staring at the hat. A dignified looking OLDER GENTLEMAN
approaches. Frank quickly slips the hat on his head.
The Older Gentleman sits on the bench across from them. He
opens a paper sack and begins neatly laying his lunch out
next to him. An apple, sandwich, napkin, Mountain Dew.
LANA
(whispers to Frank)
Speak Yiddish.
FRANK
What?
LANA
Red Yiddish.
We see the SUB-TITLE "Speak Yiddish." From this point on,
all their dialog is in YIDDISH... but it appears in ENGLISH
SUB-TITLES across the bottom of the screen.
FRANK
Ich hobe getracht, efsher iz der
nisht geshtoigen un nisht gefloygen.
(I been thinkin'...
maybe this plan is
too complicated.)
LANA
Zein nisht azoy meshige! Der plan iz

(Quit worrying. The
plan is perfect.)
INTERCUT - ANGLE ON OLDER GENTLEMAN
He tosses crumbs of his sandwich to the pigeons, occasionally
glancing up at Frank and Lana. Whenever they speak, however,
his eyes look down toward their legs.
INTERCUT - MEDIUM TWO-SHOT ON FRANK AND LANA
with SUB-TITLES across the bottom of screen, about knee-level.
FRANK
Yo! Ober mir darfen imvarfen in tsug.
Un schissen un schtippen in vasser
arein. Oy a broch! Mir zenen git

(Yeah, but we gotta
get him on the train,
shoot him... then
push him in the river.
There's a million
ways we can screw
up.)
LANA
Vus iz mit idr? Die host a vaichen

(You're not going
soft on me, are you?)
FRANK
Ven hob ich gehat a vaichen schmoke?
(When have I ever
gone soft on you?)
LANA
Lest'n Yomkippur.
(Last Yom Kippur.)
FRANK
Nu shoin, ein mul. Es paseert tsie

(Okay... once! It
happens to every
guy.)
He looks around nervously.
FRANK
Oy! Mir vellen zein oif groise tsures.
Me'vet unz chap'n.
(We're going to be in
big trouble. They're
going to catch us.)
OLDER GENTLEMAN
There's very little risk involved.
Statistics reveal that less than
thirty-two percent of all murderers
are ever apprehended.
They both look at him... stunned. A long beat.
LANA
You speak Yiddish?
OLDER GENTLEMAN
No. But I can read sub-titles.
Frank and Lana are speechless. But across the bottom of the
screen we see a SUB-TITLE reflecting their thoughts.
SUB-TITLE
Oy vay!
Lola stands in the pouring rain outside, drenched... staring
at Lana and Ned through the window.
Lola is in a glass telephone booth with venetian blinds and
a ceiling fan. She cracks the blinds open. In the background,
through a window, we can see Lana in the house on the phone.
LANA
(filtered)
I told you not to call. Frank? FRANK!
Lana FIRES her gun rapidly... BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!...
over her shoulder, behind her back, under her leg.
ANGLE ON TARGET
A full-body cut-out of a man, wearing one of Ned's trademark
gray suits. A HUGE SMOKING HOLE has been blown right through
the crotch! Lana smirks, inhales the SMOKE from the gun
barrel... and blows it out.
Frank opens the hood to Ned's car, holding a screwdriver in
one hand... a wrench in the other. He doesn't know where to
start.
CLOSE ANGLE - MAX SHADY'S FEET - MORNING
A NEWSBOY tosses a folded newspaper. It lands at Max Shady's
feet. Max picks up the paper, opens it. The headline says:
SHADY READS NEWSPAPER IN FRONT OF RAVINE RESIDENCE! Max looks
around self-consciously, eyes shifting uneasily.
Ned turns the car key. Nothing. He gets out, opens the hood.
He stares... dumbfounded.
The CAMERA BOOMS DOWN LOW to reveal Max Shady under the van,
hanging on like a leech, his back only inches from the road.
The van drives off.
The train is pulling in. The CAMERA PANS to Frank's muddy
van as it drives up nearby. Frank waits in the van as Ned
and Lana get out and walk toward the train.
They pass a feeble OLD WOMAN struggling to drag a HUGE STEAMER
TRUNK along the platform... inches at a time. A REDCAP passes
her also, carrying a small overnight case for an attractive,
elegantly attired SOCIALITE. Everyone ignores the Old Woman.
Ned looks nervously at the train, already pale.
LANA
Okay... now what're you going to do
if you feel queasy going through the
tunnel?
NED
I'll stand in the vestibule between
the cars.
LANA
That's right. When you get queasy...
go stand in the vestibule between
the cars.
She kisses his cheek. He reluctantly boards the train. Her
smile vanishes.
She hurries back to the next car, nods at Frank, boards the
train. Frank peels off his coveralls, follows her on.
ANGLE - COACH PLATFORM
Laura's Husband steps from the train, holding the deflated
Ninja Turtle float ring. He looks around, then walks toward
the cab stand. The CAMERA MOVES with him, then HOLDS ON...
MAN READING NEWSPAPER - TIGHT SHOT
The headline says: SHADY VOWS BLENDER VENGEANCE ON RAVINE!
Under the headline is a picture of Max Shady... muddy, bloody,
greasy, clothes ripped, cigar shredded... looking off.
The paper lowers, revealing Max... a battered mess, looking
off. He picks up a small violin case and quickly moves toward
the train as it starts to pull out.
We now SEE that the seat of Max's pants has been ripped out,
his naked buttocks scratched and scraped raw by the road.
Up ahead, we see a tunnel approaching.
OMIT
Sequence omitted from original script.
...racing toward the tunnel!
It looms ahead.
Max flies out the door, executing a perfect "full gainer
with a triple twist and a half-tuck"... a flawless Olympic
style dive... ending with a dead body "belly flop" into the
water!
Ned and Laura move up the steps, surrounded by REPORTERS and
MEDIA PEOPLE. Questions are being fired from all sides.
REPORTER #1
What kind of gun did she use?
NED
That's a question for the arresting
officer.
REPORTER #2
Aren't you the arresting officer?
NED
You'll have to ask her attorney.
REPORTER #1
But aren't you her attorney?
NED
Only her husband can answer that.
REPORTER #3
What will Mrs. Ravine be wearing at
the trial?
Ned stops at the top of the stairs, turning to the Reporters.
NED
A lovely powder blue dress with a
cinch waist, full bodice and a
delicately pleated skirt.
REPORTER #3
Does it have a matching jacket?
NED
No comment.
REPORTER #3
Is it cotton or rayon?
NED
(perturbed)
I said... NO COMMENT!
Ned and Laura turn and enter the building.
REPORTER #1
(calling out)
Did she eat any of the victim's body
parts?
The CAMERA MOVES IN to a wire mesh cage at the very back of
the yard. A small sign on it says: NED JUNIOR. The door is
open. The cage is... empty!
Lola rides the roller coaster with Lana's pet Skunk. She
LAUGHS maniacally as they plunge down a steep grade!
The Skunk stands stiffly on her lap, his paws planted on the
guard rail, eyes bulging out!... his fur standing straight
up!
Ned bursts out the back door... CAMERA TRACKING with his
feet as he dashes across the huge back yard... MUSIC POUNDING!
He SEES the EMPTY animal cage! The door is open. A fuzzy
blanket hangs halfway out.
Shocked, Ned spins around... running back toward the house...
CAMERA TRACKING HIS FEET, struggling to keep up. The CAMERA
SLAMS into a tree!... CRACKING the LENS!
It's a media circus! Vendors sell "TRIAL BALLOON" balloons.
PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS cluster around a squad of CHEERLEADERS
wearing sweaters emblazoned with "FREE LANA OR BUST!" across
their chests.
They perform a rousing CHEER in front of a sign on the
building that reads... "LE COURTHOUSE".
CHEERLEADERS
(with choreography)
Lana, Lana, she's the one Shot a bad
guy with a gun Blew that sucker off
a train Some guys are a friggin'
pain YaaaaaAAAAAAAAY LANA!
A BBC COMMENTATOR speaks to a TV camera.
COMMENTATOR
Once again, Americans are making a
mockery of their courts, turning a
murder trial into a media circus!
How can justice ever prevail when it
is ridiculed and reviled in such a
heinously revolting manner? This is
Clement Von Franckenstein returning
you to our BBC studios in London for
the latest photographs of Lady Di
naked in the bath.
Ned and Laura push their way through the crush of REPORTERS.
The Cheerleaders lead the SPECTATORS in an exuberant CHEER.
CHEERLEADERS
U-G-L-Y! You ain't got no alibi!
You're ugly! Yeah, you're ugly! M-A-
M-A! How you think you got that way?
Your Mama! Yeah, your Mama!
In the b.g., the Court Clerk plummets to the ground, then
staggers to his feet, and stumbles... dazed... back toward
the courthouse.
The Judge, Jury, Attorneys and Spectators are all playing on
the swings, teeter-totters, monkey bars... having a blast!
Ned and the Prosecutor play "dodge-ball." Laura cheers Ned
on. The Prosecutor rockets the ball at Ned... and just misses!
PROSECUTOR
Gotcha, dork face! Gotcha, gotcha!
LAURA
No you didn't!
NED
No way! Uh-uh! Missed by a mile!
The BAILIFF steps into CLOSE UP, blowing a whistle loudly!
BAILIFF
Recess is over! Let's go... move it,
move it, move it!
We see Lana's SILHOUETTE on the window as she raises the big
power screwdriver and turns it on. WHIRR-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R!
The CAMERA WHIPS AROUND and PUSHES IN TO...
LOLA
watching the murder from her car. There is a... FLASH! Then
another! And another! We are...
Ned pulls up. The house is dark and ominous. So is the MUSIC.
We MOVE IN SLOWLY toward the house.
NED (V.O.)
So... maybe I was wrong. Maybe women
really are like a big jigsaw puzzle...
with pieces that never seem to fit
where you want 'em to.
