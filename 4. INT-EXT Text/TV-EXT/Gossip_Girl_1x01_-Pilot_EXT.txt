      A town car pulls up.  The Chauffeur opens the door.  Serena 
      steps out.  Takes a beat.  Then heads in, past a DOORMAN who 
      seems surprised to see her.

                                  GOSSIP GIRL VOICE 
                    Upper East Side  It Girl  just up 
                    and heads for boarding school 
                    without so much as a good-bye to 
                    anyone... 


      Serena walks up the street.  Surprised to find, standing 
      outside the grand Carlyle-esque hotel -- Nate. In his 
      uniform, backpack slung over his shoulder.  

                                  NATE
                    Hey.  Your mom said you guys were 
                    staying at the hotel --                                                                                    16.



                                  SERENA
                    We re renovating again.  You know 
                    my mom -- if it s not broke, break 
                    it.
                          (then)
                    What are you doing here?

                                  NATE
                    I just wanted to see how you were.  
                    You seemed upset last night.
                          (notices her in last 
                            night s clothes)
                    Where have you been?

                                  SERENA
                    It s not important.  And I have to 
                    go -- I m gonna be late for school -

                                  NATE
                    Right.   Course...

      She heads past him, but he stops her --

                                  NATE (CONT D)
                    Serena --

                                  SERENA
                          (before he can finish)
                    No.  No way.

                                  NATE
                    Maybe we should tell her.  Maybe --

                                  SERENA
                    Blair can never know.  It s the 
                    whole reason I went to boarding 
                    school in the first place.  

                                  NATE
                    But you re back now.  

                                  SERENA
                    I didn t come back for you --

                                  NATE
                    I m not saying you did.  But if  
                    you re here -- it changes things.  
                    It changes everything.  

                                  SERENA
                    I don t want things to change.  
                          (smiles softly)
                    I ve really missed you.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    17.

                                  SERENA (CONT'D)
                    But Blair is my best friend.  And 
                    you re her boyfriend.  She loves 
                    you.  And that s how things are 
                    supposed to be.

                                  NATE 
                          (disappointed, covers)
                    No, I know... you re right.

      ACROSS THE STREET - A KID, 16 with a backpack BICYCLES by.  
      Sees them talking, intense.  Knows exactly who they are.  He 
      pulls out his PHONE, holds it up... FLASH!


      Dan races from the crosstown bus to the one heading up town --


      Dan and Rufus post FLYERS for Rufus  band s upcoming show.  
      Dan has a big satchel of flyers.  Rufus has a staple gun.

                                  DAN
                    You know, Dad - there s this thing 
                    called MySpace where you could post 
                    all this information on-line.  Save 
                    some trees, have a blog.

                                  RUFUS
                    Maybe if musicians spent as much 
                    time working on their songs as they 
                    do their blogs, the music business 
                    would be in better shape.

                                  DAN
                    Spoken like a true relic.

                                  RUFUS
                    Thanks, son. 

      Suddenly Dan s phone BUZZES.  He flips it open.  

      It reads:  HELP.  EMERGENCY.  MEET ME IN 20! 

                                  DAN
                    I have to run...
                          (beat)
                    Dad - are you gonna be okay?

                                  RUFUS
                    Yeah.  I mean your mom ll be back.  
                    She s always been a free spirit. 
                    One of the reasons I fell for her 
                    in the first place.  But in the 
                    end, this ll bring us closer.

                                  DAN
                    I meant with the flyers?

                                  RUFUS
                          (smiles, right)
                    Luckily staple guns are old school.


      Chuck and Nate spark up a joint.  Hanging out together.

                                  CHUCK
                    This is some good stuff...

                                  NATE
                    I m gonna need it.  Blair s mom is 
                    at the country house...

                                  CHUCK
                    Yeah, well then maybe I should 
                    swipe some of my Dad s Viagra. 
                          (off Nate s look)
                    Or my mom s Paxil.  Nathaniel.  
                    You re about to finally have sex 
                    with your girlfriend and it s like 
                    you re headed to your execution.

                                  NATE
                    No, man.  I m good. 

                                  CHUCK
                    Talk to Chuck, buddy.

                                  CHUCK (CONT'D)
                    You and Blair have been dating 
                    forever.  Suddenly there s a 
                    problem?  Out of the blue?

                                  NATE
                    There s no problem.
                          (beat)
                    Just... do you ever feel like your 
                    whole life is planned for you and 
                    you re just gonna end up like our 
                    parents.

                                  CHUCK
                    Jesus.  That s a dark thought.

      Nate looks at Chuck.  Wants to open up, not sure how.

                                  NATE
                    Since we were kids we were told 
                    what school to go to, what girl to 
                    date, what job to have, right?... 
                    But what if it s not want you want?  
                    Aren t we entitled to choose?  To 
                    be happy?

                                  CHUCK
                    Easy, Socrates.  What we re 
                    entitled to is a trust fund.  A 
                    house in the Hamptons.  Maybe a 
                      prescription drug problem.  But 
                    happiness does not seem to be on 
                    the menu.
                          (beat)
                    So smoke up.  And seal the deal 
                    with Blair.   Cause you re also 
                    entitled to tap that ass.

      Nate, embarrassed, tries to laugh it off.  Takes a hit.  But 
      doesn t feel any better.


      Serena, in a small summer dress, carrying her shoes and a 
      bottle of vodka stumbles outside.  Laughing.  Right behind 
      her NATE.  This is the mythic Serena we ve heard so much 
      about.  Wild.  Free.  Dangerous.

                                  SERENA
                    C mon.  It s so hot at that party.  
                    Don t you want to cool off?

      She starts to climb into the fountain.  Nate follows.  
        Entranced...

                                  NATE
                    What are you doing?  You re crazy.

                                  SERENA
                    Save me.  I might drown...

      She pulls him into the fountain.  They tumble down into the 
      water.  SPLASH.  As they get up, soaking wet, laughing -- 
      their eyes lock.  And they KISS.

                                  NATE S VOICE
                    It was one time.  We were both 
                    pretty wasted.  You were in the 
                    Hamptons with your Dad.


      Serena and Nate peel their soaking wet clothes off each 
      other.  This is charged, dangerous... As her bare legs wrap 
      around his bare back --


      Nate sits by the pond.  Feeding the ducks.  Deep in thought.  
      Checks his cell phone.  Nothing.  And decides to dial...


      Nate rises.  Nervous.

                                  NATE
                    Serena.  Hey.  Did you get my text?

                                  SERENA
                    I lost my Sidekick last night.  You 
                    have to stop calling me.  Blair and 
                    I had a great talk.  Things are 
                    finally in a really good place --

                                  NATE
                          (blurts it out)
                    Blair knows.

      Serena closes her eyes.  This is the worst possible news.

                                  SERENA
                    I m going to kill Chuck.

                                  NATE
                    Chuck?  What?  No.  I told her.

                                  SERENA
                    Why would you do that?                                                                                    39.



                                  NATE
                    I was trying to do the right thing.  
                    I don t know if I love her.  But I 
                    do know... that since that night - 
                    I haven t stopped thinking about 
                    you.  

                                  SERENA
                    Nate...

                                  NATE
                    Serena - please -- don t tell me 
                    you didn t feel anything -- that 
                    you don t --

      Serena takes a beat.  There s some truth to this...

                                  SERENA
                    Whatever we had... what we did was 
                    wrong.

                                  NATE
                    Maybe we can make it right.  Maybe 
                    we can --

                                  SERENA
                          (firm)
                    Nate, listen to me.  There s only 
                    one way to make this right.  You 
                    need to call Blair.

                                  NATE 
                    What?... No... I can t.

                                  SERENA
                    She ll forgive you.

                                  NATE
                    No she won t.  You didn t see how --

                                  SERENA
                    Yes.  She will. 
                          (deep breath)
                    Tell her you don t care about me, 
                    that you never did.  Say you ll 
                    never see me again.

                                  NATE
                    Why... why would I do that?

                                  SERENA
                    Because.  I m asking you to.                                                                                      40.



      Nate, crushed, knows she s right.  Serena hangs up.  
      Trembling.  


      Serena and Eric walk and talk with hot dogs and sodas.

                                  SERENA
                    ... I dunno.  Hang out with a 
                    strange guy in Brooklyn?  Watching 
                    some band... 

                                  ERIC
                    Not just some band.  Rolling Stone 
                    just named Anthem one of the top 
                    ten forgotten bands of the 90s.

                                  SERENA
                    So I hear...

                                  ERIC
                    Plus, how many people get to say 
                    they ve been to Brooklyn?

                                  SERENA
                    Well that s true.

                    Nothing happened.  I just... got 
                    sick of taking the meds.  Got sick

      A taxi pulls up.  Dan and Serena head up.  There are SECURITY 
      GUARDS manning the velvet rope out front.

      As the rope comes unclipped --


      Dan hails a taxi.  Putting Jenny and Serena inside.  Serena 
      and Dan share a look.
