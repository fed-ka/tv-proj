The small theatre is nearly packed to capacity. Maureen
and Phil enter, moving down the aisle searching for two
seats. A YOUNG GIRL SCREAMS, whizzing by them as a
GHOST MASKED GUY chases after her. The crowd LAUGHS.
Everyone is having fun.
Maureen and Phil find aisle seats down towards the
screen just as the lights DIM. People FAKE SCREAM in
terror. A very lively crowd.
ON SCREEN
Credits roll as the movie begins. The studio logo
appears followed by...
"A ROBERT RODRIGUEZ FILM"
IN THE THEATRE
Maureen turns to find a GHOST MASK in her face. Phil
has slipped it on.
MAUREEN
I don't think so.
Phil gets in her face, playing with her. She swats him.
MAUREEN
Take it off.
PHIL
But...
MAUREEN
Now.
He obliges.
ON SCREEN
More credits.
"BASED ON THE BOOK "THE WOODSBORO MURDERS" BY GALE
WEATHERS"
Maureen looks behind her, toward the rest of the
audience. A sea of white ghost faces fill the theatre.
The publicity masks actually glow in the dark. A
chilling sight that leaves Maureen extremely spooked.
ON SCREEN
The movie begins. A house in the middle of nowhere.
Lights burn from within.
Inside the house, a YOUNG GIRL, Alicia Silverstonish is
taking a shower. The water cascades over her nubile
body. Suddenly, a FIGURE is glimpsed through the
curtain. It's all very PSYCHO.
MAUREEN
Now why does she have to be naked?
How does that serve the plot?
PHIL
Sssshhh.
ON SCREEN
The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower
curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She
grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living
room, grabbing the phone.
GIRL
Hello?
A menacing VOICE responds.
VOICE
Hello?
GIRL
Who is this?
VOICE
You tell me.
IN THE THEATRE
Maureen is not having a good time. She's already
spooked.
MAUREEN
I hate this shit.
ON SCREEN
The phone rings again.
VOICE
Why did you hang up on me?
GIRL
Who is this?
IN THE THEATRE
Maureen shifts in her seat.
MAUREEN
Why doesn't she just hang up and
call the police? Stupid..
PHIL
Shush.
MAUREEN
I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
He nods. Maureen stands and moves up the aisle.
Maureen emerges from the theatre and into the small
lobby. It is dark and shadowed. She moves down a long
hallway to a staircase. A "BATHROOM" sign with an arrow
points downstairs.
Maureen hits the stairs to...
A small lounge leads to two bathroom doors. Very low
lighting. Maureen descends the stairs, heading for
the...
A large bathroom. Five stalls line one wall. The door
CREAKS open. Maureen enters and shoots for a stall.
INSIDE THE STALL - MOMENTS LATER
Maureen finishes up, fastening her pants. Suddenly, the
bathroom door CREAKS open. Maureen listens. FOOTSTEPS
are heard. Loud and heavy.
Maureen eyes the crack in the stall door. Not much is
visible. Suddenly, a SHADOW sweeps by. The footsteps
stop.
Maureen finishes up quickly. She flushes, throws the
stall door open and rushes out to find...
THE BATHROOM EMPTY.
The stall doors are all closed. Maureen shoots for the
door. She rips the door open as a FIGURE rushes her...
A YOUNG GIRL followed by her FRIEND, both perky and
loud. They hurl past Maureen, LAUGHING and carrying on.
GIRL #l
I got so scared my bladder rolled.
GIRL #2
You chicken shit. It's just a
movie.
GIRL # l
No, it really happened. It's a true
story.
Maureen is out the door. Now thoroughly spooked.
Alone, Maureen moves for the stairs when a FIGURE
emerges from the shadows. A GHOST MASKED SHAPE
appearing behind her...
LUNGING FOR HER, grabbing her, spinning her around. She
SCREAMS MADLY as the Ghost starts LAUGHING. The mask
comes off. It's Phil.
MAUREEN
You ass.
PHIL
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to.
It was too easy.
MAUREEN
You are so not funny.
Phil takes her in his arms.
PHIL
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little,
will ya?
MAUREEN
I get scared really easy, okay.
PHIL
You gotta go with it. Scary movies
are great foreplay.
He's sincere. He leans down and plants a kiss on her.
She caves, kissing him back. Sweet and sensual.
MAUREEN
I just have a hard time with
insipid, sexist violence.
PHIL
(nibbling her neck)
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
MAUREEN
(nibbling back)
Sandra started without us. We can
stay. He kisses her again, then
breaks away.
PHIL.
Yeah? Okay. I gotta whizz. Meet me
upstairs?
MAUREEN
Want some popcorn?
PHIL
Butter.
Maureen moves up the stairs out of sight. Phil turns,
reaching for the bathroom door just as a...
GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears in his path. Phil steps
back, surprised. Suddenly, a flash of silver shoots
forth as Phil is pierced with a long sharp knife. Quick
and silent. He bellies over just as the Ghost Shape
strikes again. Phil goes down without a scream.
CUT TO:
Maureen is at the concession. A GIRL at the counter
hands her change and Maureen is off with soda and a tub
of popcorn.
SCREAMS and GASPS from the audience as the movie plays
on.
ON SCREEN
A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The
young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING,
flying through the room.
IN THE THEATER
The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to
the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house."
etc.
Maureen makes her way back to her aisle seat. She sits
down next to...
PHIL
Who sits with the mask on. The reflection from the
movie bouncing against it in the darkness.
MAUREEN
Give it up.
She sits down, with the popcorn.
MAUREEN
How many stabs did I miss?
ON SCREEN
The young girl slips out a side door, completely
terrified. In her hand, she holds a portable phone.
IN THE THEATER
Maureen offers Phil popcorn.
MAUREEN
Why doesn't she run?
Phil turns to her, bringing his finger to his masked
lips, SSSHHING her.
ON SCREEN
The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST
MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through
the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting
away, running...
IN THE THEATER
Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her
best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her
popcorn.
MAUREEN
This is so tired.
She turns her attention to Phil.
MAUREEN
Hey, you... pasty face...
Phil ignores her. She reaches over in the darkness
putting her hand on his knee. She inches it up. The
Ghost-masked Phil just stares ahead.
MAUREEN
Whatsa the matter? Can't I get your
ghost?
ON SCREEN
The young girl is running through the yard. The Ghost
Killer is right behind her, chasing her... she
SCREAMS...
IN THE THEATER
Maureen pretends to watch the movie while her hand
continues to move between Phil's legs. She stares
ahead, WINCING at what's about to happen to the girl on
screen.
She doesn't notice as Phil pulls a long sharp hunting
knife from inside his coat jacket. Maureen's hand moves
up Phil's jacket... something stops her. She feels
something on her fingers... something wet. She pulls
her hand back, the reflected movie illuminating bloody
fingers.
Maureen stares at her hand...
ON SCREEN
The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her,
pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife.
The young girl is helpless...
IN THE THEATER
Maureen looks at Phil, confused... as if seeing for the
first time... IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the
Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other
one clutching the hunting knife.
Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD
SCREAM that is matched by the entire audience as they
SCREAM at the screen.
ON SCREAM
The young girl is stabbed in the heart.
IN THE THEATER
Maureen is helpless. The knife comes fast and furious,
striking her in the stomach. She falls forward, into
the aisle as...
ON SCREEN
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest... drags
herself, crawling across wet grass... the killer behind
her... raising his knife again.
IN THE THEATER
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle,
clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable
to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to
see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle.
Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several
PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see
the Ghost Face coming at her again... knife raised.
ON SCREEN
The young girl is slashed again.
IN THE THEATER
The knife slices into Maureen again... then again. The
theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost
keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A
horrifying, sickening sight.
Maureen stumbles forward, her bloody body moving down
to the front of the theater. Suddenly, the entire
audience begins...
APPLAUD AND CHEER
Maureen, swaying from side to side, turns to the crowd
and emits a HORRENDOUS BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM as...
ON SCREEN
The young girl lets out an enormous EAR SCREECHING
SCREAM that mirrors Maureen's as the killer attacks one
last time, stabbing her, silencing her forever.
IN THE THEATER
The Ghost slashes out one last time, direct and fierce.
Maureen falls back against the movie screen... very
much dead. Her arms flail across the screen... smearing
blood over the wide screen image of the GHOST MASK.
SMASH CUT
TO BLACK
TITLE CARD
"SCREAM 2"
FADE IN:
A typical college dorm room. Industrial strength
furniture. There's two of everything.
A RINGING phone stirs a YOUNG GIRL in bed, asleep under
a mound of blankets and pillows. The girl starts to
rise as the phone is answered. A VOICE is heard. Brass
and sassy.
VOICE (O.S.)
Hello... uh-huh... Who is this?
Well, we identify ourselves around
here. No, you can't. Uh-huh...
yeah, right...
The girl rolls out of bed, her hair falls away to
reveal her face - It's SIDNEY PRESCOTT. Two years older
has brought a maturity to this beautiful young woman.
Her face posses a survivor's edge. Stronger and more
determined, she appears to have weathered the storm.
SIDNEY
I got it.
She stands and moves to...
HALLIE
Her roommate and friend. An attractive young black
woman. Twenty at most. Brazen. Fun. Full of life. She
hands the phone to Sidney.
HALLIE
Knock yourself out.
SIDNEY
Hello?
(silence)
Hello?
VOICE
Hello Sidney.
A VOICE spits out of the phone. Deep and haunting.
Sidney doesn't flinch.
SIDNEY
Yes?
VOICE
What's your favorite scary movie?
SIDNEY
Who is this?
VOICE
You tell me.
Sidney grabs a small device hooked to the phone. She
takes a look at its display.
SIDNEY
Cory Gillis. 442-8730.
Silence.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Hot flash, Cory - prank phone calls
are a criminal offense prosecuted
under penal code 653M...
CLICK! The phone goes dead.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Enjoy the movie.
She hangs the phone up, turning to Hallie.
HALLIE
Time to change numbers again?
SIDNEY
Nah... I think it'll die off. It's
opening weekend. Let's see how it
goes.
Sidney grabs her robe and shower bucket as Hallie
channel surfs. Various morning news programs are on
their small TV. Snippets are heard.
REPORTER
(from TV)
"... The two victims, Maureen Evans
and Phil Stevens..."
The channel switches. A YOUNG MAN is being interviewed.
Attractive, sullen. Sad.
YOUNG MAN
(from TV)
Please, I just wanna be left alone.
His voice stops Sidney cold. She turns to the
television.
HALLIE
He sure gives a lot of interviews
for someone who wants to be left
alone.
Hallie hits the remote. The man's image disappears as
the TV goes off. Hallie turns, all smiles.
HALLIE
Get your ass in gear. You're late.
Don't forget we've got rush at the
Deltas tonight. Don't wear anything
you don't want trashed. Sid? Sid?
Sidney turns from the television. Momentarily lost.
Recovery is immediate.
SIDNEY
I can't believe I let you talk me
into going Greek.
Sid moves to the door and throws it open. A GHOST
FIGURE LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS but then stops
herself.
It's just a costume hung from her doorframe. Preset, to
scare. Another prank. Sidney rips it down, turns to
Hallie, throwing the costume at her.
SIDNEY
Pumps. Nice handbag. Whaddya think?
Sid is surprisingly cool. She exits out the door,
leaving Hallie staring at the Ghost Mask in her hands.
CUT TO:
Sidney moves down a hallway. Not your typical school
building. Through open doorways, film equipment is
glimpsed. Editing bays and the like. She's in the Film
Department.
She comes upon an open door and peers in. A large room,
a class is in progress. She slips in quietly.
Sidney takes a seat at the back of the room. A handful
of FILM STUDENTS sit around on torn couches heavy in
discussion. Sid goes unnoticed as she watches a
whirlwind debate. A SNOTTY GUY is pontificating a
point.
SNOTTY GUY
Sequels are too handicapped. By
definition alone, they're inferior
films.
Hallie sits on a couch next to MICKEY, 20's, atheletic,
cool and rowdy. Arms enwrapped.
MICKEY
Bullshit generalization. Many
sequels have surpassed their
original.
SNOTTY GUY
Name one.
MICKEY
ALIENS Far better than the
original.
ANOTHER GUY
Subjective.
SOME GIRL
Life's subjective. I much prefer
Ridley Scott.
The conversation overlaps, everyone arguing... making
their point about ALIENS VS. ALIEN.
HALLIE
No way. ALIENS rocked. "Stay away
from her - you bitch."
SNOTTY GUY
I'll give you that one. Name
another.
MICKEY
T2.
SOME GIRL
You've got a hard-on for Cameron.
SNOTTY GUY
A bigger budget does not make a
better movie. TERMINATOR one is
historical.
Someone screams out, "You Sarah Connor?" as the
TEACHER, a young artsy type, speaks up.
ARTSY TEACHER
How about THE GODFATHER PART II?
Ooooohhh. The whole room goes worship silent. All in
agreement.
SNOTTY GUY
The almighty exception. Name
another.
A YOUNG MAN, handsome and smooth, jumps into the
conversation. His name is Derek.
DEREK
EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Smarter story.
Improved effects.
From the back of the room, Sidney watches him. Fixated.
HALLIE
I liked JEDI. With the furry
things.
Everyone BOO'S. "Ewoks blow."
MICKEY
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
HALLIE
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH,
PART 20.
SNOTTY GUY
Case in point. The entire horror
genre was destroyed by sequels.
ARTSY TEACHER
Really? And why do you think that
is?
SNOTTY GUY
Sequels suck. Hello. It becomes
about: money and no one's
interested in quality.
DEREK
It's more than that. Horror films
are only as good as their villains.
How can Freddie and Jason possibly
be scary after they've been diluted
through five or six sequels.
TEACHER
What's the solution? If you were
making a sequel today what would
you do differently?
The class stews on this. Derek turns, spotting Sidney
in the back of the room. She gives a half wave. He
starts for her, excusing himself.
SNOTTY GUY
The point is - I made my point.
Sequels suck.
Derek and Sidney move out into the hallway. Derek
throws his arms around her protectively.
DEREK
How are you? You weren't in class.
I called as soon as I heard...
SIDNEY
I skipped. Too many "That's her"
looks.
DEREK
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
SIDNEY
Don't ask what you can do. No
coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
He looks at her with bedroom eyes.
DEREK
I can do that. And I can also do
this.
He moves on her, wrapping her in his arms and kissing
her passionately. She breaks away, laughing.
SIDNEY
No PDA.
But it's a failed objection. He kisses her again and
they're soon devouring each other like two people in
love. Right in the middle of the hallway.
CUT TO:
A huge living room. Divided sensibly in several
sections. Nicely done. Et is empty except for one girl
who lies on the couch watching television. This is
CICI, pretty with a lively energy about her. She
channel surfs while talking on the phone.
CICI
(on phone)
No, they broke up again. Bailey
won't stop drinking and Sarah can't
take it anymore.
GIRL ON PHONE
(from phone)
Thought he was doing AA.
CICI
No, he quit - the whole God thing -
he has issues. The previews for
next week...
BEEP! BEEP! Call waiting bleeps through.
CICI (CONT'D)
Hold up... someone's calling. (she
clicks over) Chi Omega House.
MAN'S VOICE
Hello.
A MAN'S VOICE. Deep and alluring.
CICI
Yes.
MAN'S VOICE
Who is this?
CICI
Cici. Who's this?
MAN'S VOICE
Someone who wants to talk to you.
CICI
Ted? Where are you? Are you
drinking? Hold on.
She clicks back over.
CICI (CONT'D)
Teddy's on the other line. He
sounds drunk. I'll call you back.
GIRL ON PHONE
That shit. He only calls you when
he's drunk. Don't go over there.
CICI
I won't.
GIRL ON PHONE
Don't. Think Bailey.
CICI
Alright, alright... I'll call you
back.
She clicks back over.
CICI (CONT'D)
Okay, Ted, you sound loaded. What's
up?
MAN'S VOICE
Who's Ted?
Realizing, it's not Ted.
CICI
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. I thought
you were someone else.
MAN'S VOICE
That's okay.
CICI
Who do you want to speak with?
Nobody's here.
MAN'S VOICE
Where is everybody?
CICI
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain
mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
MAN'S VOICE
Why aren't you there?
CICI
I'm designated driver. I have to be
here in case a sister calls and
needs a ride.
MAN'S VOICE
That's too bad.
CICI
"Drink with your brain." That's our
motto. Who are you calling for?
MAN'S VOICE
What if I said you?
CICI
What if I said goodbye?
MAN'S VOICE
Why would you wanna do that?
CICI
Why do you always answer a question
with a question?
MAN'S VOICE
I'm inquisitive.
CICI
I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna
leave a message for someone?
Silence. No response.
CICI (CONT'D)
Hello? Hello? Where'd you go?
Silence again. And then...
MAN'S VOICE
Do you wanna die tonight, Cici ?
Almost a whisper. Simple. Direct. His voice pierces
Cici. Her eyes widen. BEEP! Call waiting CLICKS
through.
CICI
Just a second.
(clicks over)
Yes?
Cici gets up and moves to...
Cici checks the front door, making sure it's locked.
GIRL ON PHONE
Was it Teddy?
CICI
No, some creep asshole trying to
scare me.
GIRL ON PHONE
It's hell week. Chill. The movie
murders have brought out the
crazies. It's nothing.
BUMP! A noise from upstairs. Cici spins around to the
staircase.
CICI
Shit.
GIRL ON PHONE
What is it?
CICI
I heard a noise.
GIRL ON PHONE
Where?
CICi
Upstairs.
BUMP! Something moves upstairs. It sounds almost like
footsteps.
CICI
Shit. Cici moves to the staircase.
She peers up it.
CICI (CONT'D)
(calling out)
Hello? Hello?
GIRL ON PHONE
(
la Friday the 13th)
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah,
hah, hah...
CICI
Stop it...
GIRL ON PHONE
I can't believe you're alone in
that house.
Cici looks up the staircase again.
CICI
(soft whisper)
I don't think I'm alone.
Floorboards CREAK above her. Cici freaks.
CICI
I'm outta here.
She flies to the door, unlocking it, throwing it open.
She moves out onto the...
A large, dark kitchen. Cici moves to the frig and opens
it, She gives it the once over. The frig light reflects
against her face. She closes the refrigerator, not
seeing the Shadow that bounces across her back.
Cici moves to a sliding glass door that overlooks the
backyard. She checks the lock. Secure. Then, the phone
RINGS.
She turns to the phone that's attached to a nearby
wall. It RINGS AGAIN. She reaches for it, answering it.
CICI
Hello?
SUDDENLY, TWO HANDS LUNGE OUT OF THE DARKNESS
One finds her neck, the other grabs her by the hair,
wrenching her head backwards and spinning her around,
shoving her, pushing her into the...
SLIDING GLASS DOOR
Glass explodes everywhere, shattering to bits as Cici's
body crashes through it, setting off the ALARM. A loud,
shrill RING resonants through the house as Cici's body
lands on the deck outside. Still. (NOTE: WES DOES
REALLY SCARY SHIT HERE.)
CUT TO:
Captain Tyler, the Sheriff, police, FBI... the house is
crawling. Dewey sifts around on his own, checking
things out.
IN THE KITCHEN
Captain Tyler and the Sheriff stand at the shattered
glass door.
SHERIFF
Lots of blood. But no body.
CAPTAIN TYLER
Have you checked the...
SHERIFF
Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
CAPTAIN TYLER
Take the neighborhood.
The Sheriff turns to his men.
SHERIFF
Alright men, listen up...
Dewey is all ears.
Derek and Sid stand on the porch, his arms around her.
Her face is numb.
SIDNEY
It's starting all over again.
DEREK
Lemme take you home.
SIDNEY
I'll get my jacket.
Sidney, indifferent, moves through the open front door,
back inside the house. Her face and mind detached from
what's going on. Derek remains on the porch, watching
the spectacle. Slowly, the door behind him closes.
Sid moves through the living room, she grabs her coat
when the phone RINGS. She looks at it suspiciously...
knowingly... she reaches for it.
SIDNEY
Hello?
MAN'S VOICE
Hello Sidney?
The VOICE. Low and haunting. Sidney closes her eyes.
When she opens them tears are immediate But still, she
refuses to crack.
SIDNEY
Who are you?
MAN'S VOICE
Soon, Sidney, soon.
SIDNEY
What do you want?
MAN'S VOICE
To see every ounce of blood drain
from your body.
The Voice has never sounded more evil... more
seductive. Sidney doesn't flinch. She holds steady.
SIDNEY
Then come and get me.
And with that Sidney hangs up the phone, SLAMMING it
down. Silence. And then...
MAN'S VOICE
My pleasure.
The Voice comes from inside the room... behind her.
Sidney spins around and finds herself staring at the...
GHOST MASKED FIGURE
But not the one from the movie theater. The one from
Sidney's nightmare long ago. It stands in the foyer
archway, staring at her.
A sustained moment. A stand off. Sidney doesn't move.
But then the killer withdraws his trademark. A long,
steel hunting knife... blood stained.
SIDNEY BOLTS
As the GHOST LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS, dodging him,
ON THE PORCH
Derek hears her SCREAM. He turns to the front door. He
finds it locked. He starts to BEAT on it.
DEREK
Sid? Sid?
IN THE LIVING ROOM
Sid just dodges the Ghost, just missing the knife's
blade. She bolts through the living room, to the front
door. Derek beats on it from outside.
IN THE FOYER
SIDNEY
Derek. He's in the house. Help...
me...
She struggles with the door, there are too many locks,
the Ghost is already upon her. She looks to the stairs,
thinks better of it... flies through the dining room.
Derek is going nuts trying to get into the house. He
moves along the porch to the windows, looking through.
He watches as the Ghost Figure chases her into the
kitchen. Derek looks about the porch. He rears his foot
back and kicks in the window.
Sid moves through the kitchen to the back door. She
struggles with the lock as the Ghost is right behind
her. She barely makes it out the back door...
The place is packed. No longer just a campus security
office. The place has been converted to the local
police station as well as FBI headquarters. UNIFORMS
and SUITS swarm the place.
In a back section of the room, Sheriff Hartley and
Captain Tyler are in a huge discussion with Dean
Fisher. Tempers are heated. Its been a sleepless night
for all.
CAPTAIN TYLER
We don't know if it's random. We
haven't been able to connect the
victims.
SHERIFF
The first two were stabbed without
thought. The sorority girl was
gutted with autopsy precision.
DEAN FISHER
Christ! Just do something. I will
not have a repeat of Gainesville.
Not on my campus. .
Dewey listens to this exchange, slowly stepping
forward.
DEWEY
Sidney Prescott, sir.
They both turn to him.
DEWEY (CONT'D)
She's the connection.
CAPTAIN TYLER
We know that, son.
DEWEY
The killer was trying to get to
her. That sorority girl was a
distraction.
CAPTAIN TYLER
We're aware of that.
Sheriff Hartley steps forward.
DEWEY
The killer is obviously repeating
Woodsboro. I can fill you in on
what I know.
Dewey is not a welcome participant. Eyes roll. Captain
Tyler pulls Dewey aside.
CAPTAIN TYLER
Look, son. I know you've lived
through this, but we got it under
control. Why don't you have some
coffee?
Just then, Gale Weathers appears being ushered in by
TWO UNIFORMS. Dean Fisher greets her with smiles The
FBI and local police fawn over her.
SHERIFF
Thank you, Miss Weathers for coming
in.
GALE
Of course, what can I do?
Captain Tyler gives Dewey a patronizing pat on the
back, sending him off.
CAPTAIN TYLER
We were hoping you could help with
the killer's profile.
Dewey's face couldn't be more burned.
A chalk board in front of them. Three names are written
on it under the label "Victims" - "MAUREEN EVANS, PHIL
STEVENS, CICI TAYLOR"
Gale is at the chalk board
GALE
Maureen Evans - Maureen Prescott.
Sidney Prescott's mother. The first
victim in the Woodsboro Murders.
Phil Stevens - Stephen Orth - the
first kid to be murdered. Ten to
one - Cici is not the third
victim's real name.
SHERIFF
It's Cassandra.
GALE
Nickname Cassie or - Casey. The
third victim in Woodsboro. She was
hung from a tree and gutted.
The room goes quiet. Dewey watches from the back of the
room. His eyes burning holes into Gale.
CAPTAIN TYLER
Jesus...
GALE
This is a complete copycat. Your
killer is even going in sequence.
Captain Tyler sits up.
CAPTAIN TYLER
Who was the next victim in
Woodsboro?
GALE
In the book or in the movie?
DEAN FISHER
Let's try reality.
GALE
Mr. Himbry - the principal was the
next victim. However, in the movie
version, Tatum Riley was killed
next. Dramatic license.
SHERIFF
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies
out of his seat and into action.
CAPTAIN TYLER
(to his men)
Find me every variation of Himbry
and what was the other name...
DEWEY
Tatum Riley.
Dewey speaks up. His voice soft but heard. The entire
room stares at him, knowingly. Gale's eyes find his. He
looks away.
CAPTAIN TYLER
Both on campus and the surrounding
community. I want names ASAP.
DEAN FISHER
I'll get you full access.
The room breaks into a fury as they jump into action.
Gale stops Captain Tyler.
GALE
What about Sidney? Is she safe?
CAPTAIN TYLER
She's completely insulated. I've
got my top men on her.
CUT TO:
Sid, Derek, Hallie, Mickey, and Joel lounge among
pillows and blankets. The remains of a sleepover. Joel
parts the blinds.
ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW
Two plains clothed policemen are in view, milling about
outside - standing guard.
JOEL
How many guys they have on you?
MICKEY
I counted four.
Hallie reads from a notebook in her hand.
HALLIE
Okay, you're sure about skipping
Calculas?
SIDNEY
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
HALLIE
What about rehearsal?
SIDNEY
Gotta.
HALLIE
I'll cover you through rehearsal.
Derek when do you get outta docu-
drama?
DEREK
Two.
HALLIE
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
DEREK
And watch her til 8:00 - I've got

JOEL
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio
and we can grab a bite.
SIDNEY
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
HALLIE
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take
her late evening.
MICKEY
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
HALLIE
Too bad.
SIDNEY
This is exactly what I don't want.
DEREK
I think it's out of your control.
Derek puts his arms around her, pulling her close.
Mickey and Hallie argue about this evening. Joel moves
out the door.
JOEL
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
SIDNEY
But...
Derek kisses her sweetly.
SIDNEY
My screwed up life shouldn't have
to bleed onto my friends.
DEREK
Let us decide that.
SIDNEY
What about your film? Isn't it due
next week? Have you even started
it?
DEREK
It's under control.
He kisses her again.
CUT TO:
A huge one-stop for students. Comprised of several open
floors, it looks like a mini-mall. A cafeteria, book
store, movie theatre, arcade, etc. fill the place.
Gale moves through the lobby area when she sees Debbie
Salt heading her off. She tries to bolt but she's not
fast enough.
DEBBIE SALT
Hi, Gale, any leads?
GALE
Tons and tons.
DEBBIE SALT
Where is Sidney's father?
GALE
Home - where he lives.
DEBBIE SALT
And are the police sure about that?
GALE
Why don't you ask them?
DEBBIE SALT
Already did. He's the perfect
suspect, don't you think?
GALE
No, I don't.
DEBBIE SALT
Parents are always responsible. It
all starts in the home.
GALE
Look, I know you kinda hold me up
as your career template and it
gives you some anal charge to
challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm
not interested in the scoop
anymore. Excuse me.
Gale charges off, moving to a nearby newsstand. The
tabloid papers exploit what's going on. Crazy headlines
about the murders dominate the newsrack.
Gale is clearly bothered by this. Just then, a phone
RINGS. She pulls it from her pocket.
GALE (CONT'D)
Hello?
MAN'S VOICE
Hello, Gale.
It's the Killer. His voice is unmistakable.
GALE
Who is this?
MAN'S VOICE
I'll give you one guess.
Gale knows immediately. She looks around for help. A
CAMPUS COP is across the lobby.
GALE
Who are you?
MAN'S VOICE
That's not the way we play the
game.
GALE
I don't play games.
MAN'S VOICE
What if your life depended on it?
Gale gets testy with him.
GALE
What do you want?
MAN'S VOICE
You're pretty when you're angry.
Gale stops cold. She looks around. The place is alive
with people. He could be anywhere.
GALE
Where are you?
MAN'S VOICE
I'm everywhere.
She continues moving to the Campus Cop.
GALE
Oh - a God complex
MAN'S VOICE
Stay away from the cop.
A deadly warning. Gale stops. She plays it cool. She
looks above her to the upper floor. STUDENTS hang over
a balcony.
GALE
What do you want from me?
MAN'S VOICE
It's what you want from me.
Silence.
GALE
What do you mean?
MAN'S VOICE
You are writing another book,
aren't you? That's why you're here.
The story's not over.
GALE
You're getting obvious.
MAN'S VOICE
No, Gale, I'm just getting started.
Seeya soon.
GALE
No, wait...
MAN'S VOICE
Watch your back.
CLICK. The phone goes dead. Gale spins around, doing
quick circle to make sure no one's around her. She
turns and heads off, right into...
DEWEY
They both GASP.
CUT TO:
A large tiered theatre. Seats five-hundred. Old but
preserved and updated. A rehearsal is in progress.
SEVERAL ACTORS stand stage center running lines as
stagehands work on the set around them.
Sidney is one of them. She moves around the stage, very
animated. More alive than ever. She dons a Russian
accent. Convincing. A promising actress.
SIDNEY
(in character)
"Pain, yah, such pain. Pain."
An awkward silence. Everyone looks at each other.
Finally, Lois, the bitchy sorority girl speaks up.
LOIS
That's not the line. You jumped.
SIDNEY
Shit. Did I?
LOIS
About a page.
DIRECTOR
(off stage)
CUT! Let's take five.
The actors break up as Sidney, frustrated, walks across
a make shift bridge that takes her across the orchestra
pit and down the stairs into the house where Hallie
sits watching. Sid's bodyguards can be seen sitting
scattered about.
HALLIE
That was good.
SIDNEY
Yeah, right.
The DIRECTOR, mid-30's, intelligent, friendly.
DIRECTOR
Sid, why don't you get outta here?
We'll pick this up tomorrow.
Sid nods in agreement. The Director smiles at her.
DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
Work on the accent.
She grabs her things and heads off with Hallie when...
VOICE
Sid?
Sid turns to find Randy moving through an aisle. He had
been watching rehearsal. Sid's face tenses.
HALLIE
Who is that guy?
SIDNEY
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet
you outside.
HALLIE
No, girletta, I don't leave your
side.
SIDNEY
I've got my entourage. Take a
break. Please.
Sid is definite. Hallie backs off, heading up the
aisle, against her better wishes.
SIDNEY
What do you want?
RANDY
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never
should have gone along with Gale. I
know I'm stupid. I wish I had some
good reason to give you but I'm
just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be
mad at me.
SIDNEY
Do you work for her now?
RANDY
Well, yeah... she gave me a job.
Freelance. It got me outta
Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton
and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I
knew it was a bad idea but it
seemed like a quasi harmless bad
idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up.
Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly
appearing.
SIDNEY
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
He nods, knowingly.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Wanna get outta here?
CUT TO:
Gale and Dewey are with Captain Tyler and Sheriff
Evans.
CAPTAIN TYLER
If he calls again - find help.
Don't engage him in conversation.
I'm gonna put a man on you - to
cover you.
DEWEY
I can do it, Captain.
CAPTAIN TYLER
Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking
I'd pull Jesse off...
GALE
I'd prefer Dewey, Captain.
Tyler doesn't argue. He's too crazed. Dewey avoids
Gale's stare.
DEWEY
How's the name search going?
CAPTAIN TYLER
37 usages of Himbry located in the
registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47
Riley's. And that's just on campus.
It's hopeless.
CUT TO:
A movie is in progress. STAB.
ON SCREEN
A young girl, looking a lot like Tori Spelling, runs
down a school corridor. She runs smack into a young,
handsome boy. He could very well be Johnny Depp.
TORI
(in movie)
Oh, God, Billy, you scared me. What
are you doing here?
JOHNNY
(in movie)
They let me go, Sid, I didn't do
it. I'm innocent.
IN THE THEATRE
Sid and Randy sit in the small cineplex mall type
theatre. Behind them sit Sid's trusting police guards.
Sidney shifts in her seat.
RANDY
You okay, Sid?
SIDNEY
Yeah.
ON SCREEN
Tori Spelling and Johnny Depp continue their dramatic
discussion.
JOHNNY
When my mom left my dad, I accepted
it. That's just the way the cookie
crumbles. Moms leave.
TORI
Yeah, but your mom left town. She's
not dead. My mom's dead. Do you
hear me? She's dead. Dead. And
she's never coming back. Ever,
Ever.
IN THE THEATRE
Sidney grows increasingly uneasy.
CUT TO:
Mickey, Joel, and Derek are crowded around a table in
the Student Union Cafeteria.
DEREK
My documentary is due on Tuesday.
MICKEY
What's your subject?
DEREK
I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
JOEL
You should of done it on Sidney.
That would have been a cool.
DEREK
She wouldn't let me.
MICKEY
Not with Primetime Live and 20/20
coming at her. I'd save my shit
too.
Hallie comes waltzing up.
DEREK
Where's Sid?
HALLIE
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
DEREK
You weren't supposed to leave her
alone.
HALLIE
I didn't say she was alone. That
guy - from her home town showed up.
They went off together.
Hallie plops down, giving Mickey a big kiss.
MICKEY
I've been waiting for you, baby.
JOEL
Is that cool? Just to leave her
like that?
HALLIE
She's got guards with her.
DEREK
What guy?
HALLIE
Randy somebody.
JOEL
Randy Meeks. He was with Sid that
night in Woodsboro.
MICKEY
Her old boyfriend?
JOEL
No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy
was a friend.
MICKEY
Watch out, Derek.
HALLIE
He tried to kill her first.
MICKEY
Is Sid in therapy?
JOEL
She was for a while. Gave it up.
DEREK
How do you know so much about her?
JOEL
I read the book.
MICKEY
I could use some therapy.
DEREK
Should we be worried about this
guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just
showed up and now people are dying?
HALLIE
He seemed harmless.
DEREK
Aren't most serial killers
seemingly harmless?
JOEL
And white.
MICKEY
Easy black boy.
JOEL
It's documented. Most serial
killers are attractive - slightly
off white males in their twenties.
HALLIE
That's you, honey.
Hallie kisses Mickey again.
MICKEY
I got a surprise for you.
HALLIE
What?
Suddenly, he leaps up on the cafeteria table and begins
to sing at the top of his lungs.
MICKEY
"If I should stay. I would only be
in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I
know, I'll think of you each step
of the way...
HALLIE
Don't do this.
MICKEY
"And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always
love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will
always love you."
Everyone has taken notice. They begin to cheer and sing
with him.
JOEL
(to Derek)
Whitney?
DEREK
I think he's doing Dolly.
MICKEY
"And I hope life treats you kind
and I hope you have all you dreamed
of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
DEREK
Definitely Whitney.
Hallie can't help but be touched. He finishes up,
ending on a last, final note. As he does, he pulls a
necklace from around his neck. His Greek letters dangle
from it. He places them around her neck, kissing her.
JOEL
Isn't that a big no-no?
DEREK
I think so.
Hallie breaks away. She swats him.
HALLIE
You're going to get it. You know
what happens.
MICKEY
But I love you. And I want the
whole world to know it.
Hallie smiles, her eyes misty. Derek and Joel eye each
other.
CUT TO:
Sid and Randy continue watching the movie. The guards
behind them are way engrossed.
ON SCREEN
It's the end of the movie. Tori Spelling is running for
her life from two killers - Johnny Depp and his
sidekick. She finds herself trapped in the kitchen.
Johnny Depp holds the knife up to Tori's face.
TORI
Why did you kill my mother?
JOHNNY
Because she was sleeping with my
dad. She's the reason my mom left.
She was a whore just like you.
IN THE THEATRE
These words sting Sid. Randy notices her flinching.
ON SCREEN
TORI
My mom was no whore. Don't you say
that.
JOHHNY
Whore! Whore! Whore! Whore!
Tori starts to cry.
IN THE THEATRE
Tears find their way down Sidney's cheeks.
ON SCREEN
Johnny Depp and his murderous sidekick start stabbing
each other.
JOHNNY (CONT'D)
It's the perfect alibi, Sidney.
SIDEKICK
Just like in the movies.
IN THE THEATRE
Sidney can't take it anymore. She gets up and races out
of the theatre.
Sid emerges from the theatre and into the lobby. She
moves into a curtained section where the water fountain
is. She looks up and sees Randy flying out of the
theatre. He exits outside looking for her. The cops are
right behind him.
VOICE
Hello Sidney.
Sidney spins around. Cotton Weary stands before her.
shoulders slumped, his face pained.
SIDNEY
Cotton.
COTTON
Can we talk?
SIDNEY
I don't think that's a good idea.
COTTON
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea.
That was all Gale and dollar signs
and ratings.
SIDNEY
What do you want from me, Cotton?
COTTON
You could start with an apology.
SIDNEY
I did that.
COTTON
You wrote me a letter. Very
cordial. Very appropriate.
SIDNEY
How? What could I say that would
make a difference? I took away a
year of your life - how do I
apologize for that?
COTTON
I wish it was just a year. I lost
everything because of you. I have
nothing now. Look at me, this is
what I've become.
A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
SIDNEY
Cotton, there isn't one day, one
hour, one minute when I'm not
reminded of what I've done. I have
not had one second of reprieve and
no therapy or religion or spiritual
plane can ever erase what I feel in
every vein of my being. And I wish
I had in me what you need to hear
but I don't think the words exist.
More silence.
COTTON
I just thought if I saw you face to
face, maybe it would help.
SIDNEY
Did it?
COTTON
It helped me realize one thing.
SIDNEY
What?
COTTON
You're a self-obsessed little cunt
like your mother.
And with that, Cotton flips on a dime. His face turns
evil. Sidney races by him as he throws out his arm,
stopping her just as...
THE TWO POLICE GUARDS
Appear, grabbing him from behind. They throw him
against the wall, retaining him. Randy appears at Sid's
side.
RANDY
You okay?
Sid nods as she watches the officers arrest him. They
do a body search, pulling from his coat a large
revolver. Cotton just smiles.
CUT TO:
A room of the library sectioned off exclusively for
computer use. It consists of thirty to forty cubicles
that house computer terminals. Every cubicle is full.
The place is packed.
Sid sits at a terminal busy at work. Her two police
guards wander up and down the cubicles keeping an eye
out.
CLOSE ON SIDNEY
Her face appears concentrated, focused. She scans the
computer screen in front of her.
ON THE MONITOR
Sid is typing feverishly. Suddenly, her screen starts
flashing and BEEPING, freezing her words.
ON SIDNEY
Confused, she tries to make it stop but it won't. She
leans back, turning to the GUY next to her. A handsome
young man.
SIDNEY
Excuse me? Did your computer just
freeze?
The guy leans over and takes a look at Sid's monitor.
GUY (CONT'D)
You have an instant message, that's
all. Just hit ALT M.
SIDNEY
I'm not signed on.
GUY
Someone here in the room. All the
terminals are connected.
The guy returns to his own computer. Sidney eyes the
screen suspiciously. She hits ALT + M. A message pops
up on the screen.
"YOU'RE GOING TO DIE TONIGHT."
Sidney freaks. A muffled CRY. She shoots up, looking
about the crowded room. He could be anywhere. The two
guards take notice, rushing over to her.
SIDNEY
He's here. He's in the room right
now.
She points to the screen. The men instantly break up
and cover the room. They start pulling people from
their terminals to check their screens.
Sidney backs away from her screen, her terror growing.
Suddenly, it starts flashing and BEEPING again. She
looks around. She slowly moves toward it, drawn
uncontrollably. She hits ALT + M. Another message pops
up:
"THE POLICE CAN'T SAVE YOU."
CLOSE ON SIDNEY'S FACE
It's stone pale. She takes a deep breath and begins to
type.
ON THE MONITOR
The words "FUCK YOU" appear. Sid hits "SEND".
LATER
Captain Tyler and Sheriff Hartley are drilling a very
subdued and cool Cotton.
COTTON
What better alibi could I have? I
was here in custody.
CAPTAIN TYLER
Maybe you don't work alone.
COTTON
Yeah, that's it.
SHERIFF
Why did you attack Sidney Prescott?
COTTON
There was no attack, we were
talking. Very heatedly. Miss
Prescott and I have a very
complicated past. That's no crime.
CAPTAIN TYLER
And the gun?
COTTON
I have a permit. It's registered. I
have a legal right to carry it.
SHERIFF
Why do you need a gun?
COTTON
Gentlemen, your growing hysteria is
not reason enough to hold me here.
I've been down this road before.
And unless you're going to charge
me with a crime I'd like to walk
outta here. I have an interview at
6:00.
CUT TO:
Gale sits at a table. Dewey approaches. He places a
hand on her shoulder. They're both at a loss.
GALE
Where's Sidney'?
DEWEY
She's safe.
Silence.
DEWEY (CONT'D)
How you doin?
GALE
Not good. How you doin?
DEWEY
Not good.
Just then, the Sheriff and Captain emerge from their
office. Cotton is escorted out behind them. Gale moves
to him.
DEWEY
Can't we hold him?
CAPTAIN TYLER
No, we got pressure from California
State. The man practically has
clemency. We can't run the risk of
falsely accusing him. He has to be
standing over the victim with knife
in hand before we make a move.
DEWEY
What now?
ON COTTON
He stands at a counter, signing forms. Gale approaches.
GALE
What's going on, Cotton?
COTTON
You know the story, Gale. Man
falsely accused, sent to prison,
proved innocent, released back into
the real world and never trusted
again. Want the exclusive?
GALE
Did you do it?
She looks him dead in the eyes.
COTTON
Now, Gale, you were so instrumental
in my freedom. You're not having
character doubts now, are you?
GALE
You have a right to be angry.
COTTON
No, Gale, I don't have any rights.
You made sure of that.
GALE
Cotton, I've done nothing but help
you.
COTTON
You've done nothing but get rich
off of me. How many books have you
sold, Gale? You think I don't
understand points and royalties and
ancilliary rights?
Just then, the OFFICER behind the counter brings him
his gun in a plastic bag. Cotton takes it out and
checks it over. Gale is surprised to see the gun.
GALE
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton.
You've come to far.
COTTON
Gale, I don't know what I'm doing
from one moment to the next. I'm
just taking it as it comes.
Cotton pockets the gun and heads out. Gale rejoins
Dewey and the others.
CAPTAIN TYLER
Night's coming. I think its time to
beef up security on the Prescott
girl.
GALE
Where is she?
SHERIFF
She was just escorted to her dorm
room.
DEWEY
Is she safe there?
CAPTAIN TYLER
We're going to bring her in. Hide
her out for a coupla days. And
we're issuing a campus lock-in this
evening. No one is allowed out
after dark.
DEWEY
That doesn't work, sir.
GALE
You're just isolating people.
You're giving the killer a blank
canvas.
CUT TO:
Sidney is trying to focus on homework while Hallie
channel surfs. She finds a channel. On screen, Siskel a
Ebert are reviewing a movie.
EBERT
(from TV)
I enjoyed its clever execution...
HALLIE
We're missing the Sig Ep party.
SIDNEY
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties
and mass murderers don't go
together. Trust me.
HALLIE
No, no, I hadn't planned on going,
it's just Mickey will be pissed.
Hallie clearly wishes she were there.
SISKEL
(from TV)
It was just an excuse to kill
young, big breasted girls. I didn't
like it.
They're reviewing STAB. Hallie switches channels.
There's a KNOCK on the door. Sid answers - it's Dewey
and Gale. From the look on their faces...
SIDNEY
Someone else has been killed.
CUT TO:
Hallie consoles Sidney. Dewey and Gale nearby. Sidney
is a stone rock. It's frightening to watch her hold it
together.
SIDNEY
I'm fine. I wish people would stop
treating me like glass. I'm not
gonna break.
HALLIE
It's okay to break, girl. You
shatter if you have to.
SIDNEY
I'd really just like to be alone.
DEWEY
The police are waiting outside.
They're going to take you somewhere
safe.
SIDNEY
Dewey, there's no such place.
DEWEY
Humor me, Sid.
Sidney starts packing an overnight bag.
HALLIE
Can I come with her?
SIDNEY
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you
down too. I'll be alright.
GALE
Sid, I'll come with you.
SIDNEY
But who would operate your camera?
A burn. It comes out of nowhere. Gale goes silent. A
KNOCK at the door. Dewey opens to find a Police guard
standing with Joel.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
He's cool, Remy.
Joel is ushered in. He says his hello's, moving to
Hallie. Gale and Dewey move out into the hall with the
guards. Sid continues to pack. Her face rigid.
JOEL
They got Mickey. He's being toasted
at the Deltas.
HALLIE
I knew it. Shit! I gotta get over
there.
JOEL
We're under quarantine.
He points to Dewey who talks to Gale in the hallway.
HALLIE
I'm the only one who can cut him
down.
SIDNEY
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
JOEL
I'll go with her.
HALLIE
Be safe, girl.
She gives Sidney a hug before she can object, then she
and Joel race out into the hallway as Dewey sticks his
head in.
DEWEY
Sid, you should get going.
He looks at Joel and Hallie.
DEWEY (CONT'D)
Where are you two headed?
JOEL
(instant cover)
Hallie forgot her footage at the
film dept. I'm gonna walk her over
before it's gets too late
DEWEY
You really...
HALLIE
I gotta have it, Dewey.
Gale steps in.
GALE
Hey, Dewey?
HALLIE
Seeya, Dewey.
Hallie and Joel race outta there before any more
objections. Dewey turns to Gale.
GALE
If you were truly a copycat,
wouldn't you want to emulate
everything about the killer that
you could?
DEWEY
Meaning?
GALE
He's already gotta be a part of
Sid's life. What do you know about
this Derek?
DEWEY
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney
when she was attacked.
GALE
Billy had alibis too.
Dewey turns to Sid who now stands ready in the doorway.
DEWEY
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll
find you later, okay.
SIDNEY
Whatever.
Sidney's exterior keeps hardening.
CUT TO:
A dark room. A slight disturbance at the door and it
comes popping open. Light from the hall floods the room
as Dewey and Gale slip in and close the door behind
them.
GALE
(checking door)
You broke the lock.
DEWEY
You broke my heart.
GALE
What are we looking for?
DEWEY
A bloody knife. A ghost mask.
Something like that?
GALE
Can we turn the light on?
DEWEY
That's not the way it's done.
Dewey pulls out his flashlight and begins to search the
room. He sifts through drawers and a closet.
DEWEY
And it's sexier in the dark.
GALE
Dewey, you and I would never make
it.
DEWEY
Maybe not. But think about the sex.
As frustrated as I am...
GALE
... and as lonely as I am...
DEWEY
We'd break some furniture.
Gale LAUGHS at this. She reaches over and pats his
buttock.
GALE
Tell you what. We get through this
one. And we'll take out a hotel
room. Over here with the light.
Dewey points the light to a framed picture. It's of
Joel and Derek - a buddy pose. She sifts through some
text books on the desk.
DEWEY
They're roomates.
GALE
And Joel's pre-med.
DEWEY
The sorority girl was gutted with
autopsy precision.
GALE
Shit! It's both of them. The first
murders were to throw us - using
the same names as Woodsboro. But
they've moved on - they're getting
closer to Sidney. They're not
looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to
kill. They're looking for the new
Tatum.
DEWEY
Hallie?
A moment. Then in a splash, they're outta there.
CUT TO:
Sidney sits in the backseat. The two police officers
ride in front.
SIDNEY
Where are you taking me?
POLICE GUARD #1
Actually, I don't know.
POLICE GUARD #2
We're meeting another car that will
transport you the rest of the way.
POLICE GUARD #1
Safety precautions.
SIDNEY
I feel like Eddie Murphy.
The car comes to a halt in front of a stop light.
POLICE GUARD #1
We feel like Kevin Costner.
Sidney smiles at this just as the car door rips open on
the passenger's side. Two hands reach in and yank
Police Guard #2 from the car. He starts to CRY OUT but
it's cut short.
Sid SCREAMS as the Police Guard behind the wheel
struggles with his seat belt. He looks up to see a
Ghost Masked Figure move around the side of the car
towards his door. He reaches for his gun but it's too
late. The Ghost has the door open.
A flash of silver and the Police Guard's throat is
slit.
IN THE BACK SEAT
Sidney SCREAMS and SCREAMS, BEATING on the door of the
car. It won't open. She's trapped like a caged animal.
IN THE FRONT SEAT
The Ghost pulls the Police Guard from the car, then
gets in, behind the driver's seat. The Ghost puts the
car in drive and takes off down the road.
Sidney looks behind her as the guard's dead bodies lay
sprawled in the middle of the road. She turns to the
door, BEATING and CLAWING at it. She leans back, manic,
and KICKS at the window with her feet. No use.
Dewey and Gale move down a dark and shadowed hallway.
THUMP! They stop cold.
GALE
Ssshh! What was that?
DEWEY
Let's find out.
Dewey keeps moving.
GALE
This is all too familiar.
DEWEY
Over here.
Dewey has lead her to a door marked "LECTURE HALL".
The same room seen earlier. A large, rounded room with
three levels of seats that shoot straight up to the
ceiling. A podium stands center. Video monitors hang
from the ceiling in different places around the room.
Dewey and Gale enter. If not for the red EXIT SIGNS
that hang over the exit doors, the room would be
completely dark.
They move down the first level of chairs to the
lecturn.
GALE
Maybe they never got here. He could
have taken her anywhere.
DEWEY
C'mon. Let's go.
CLICK! STATIC! A noise from above takes their
attention. They looks up as a video monitor comes to
life. Images appear.
CLOSE ON MONITOR
Home-made video footage fills the screen. A movie
theatre, people standing in line. The home camera ZOOMS
in to a YOUNG COUPLE. Maureen and Phil come into view.
ON DEWEY AND GALE
Gale watches the screen as Dewey looks around the room,
searching for it's source.
CLICK! Another monitor comes to life. More home shot
video footage. This time of a big house. A closer look
reveals it to be the Chi Omega Sorority House. A young
girl stands on the front porch talking on a portable
phone. It's Cici.
ON GALE AND DEWEY
GALE
Jesus Christ!
DEWEY
He filmed his victims.
CLICK! ANOTHER MONITOR TURNS ON.
It's Randy standing outside the newsvan with the
cellular phone to his ear.
CLICK! Another monitor turns on. It's of a man and
woman back to the camera. The couple move in frame. It
becomes apparent quick. It's Gale and Dewey. As they
stand in the room - live. They're being taped.
CLOSE ON DEWEY AND GALE
GALE
Shit!
Dewey spins around. He reaches for the gun he no longer
carries.
DEWEY
Dammit!
He looks around the room, up to the two levels above
them. He spots a small light on the second level. He
squints his eyes and sees a FIGURE standing behind it.
GALE
Let's go.
DEWEY
No, wait here.
Dewey hands her his flashlight and takes off for the
stair rise that leads to the upper level.
GALE
No, Dewey, let's call for backup.
But Dewey is gone, leaving Gale alone. She turns to the
monitor to see her face in fear-stricken CLOSEUP.
ON THE UPPER LEVEL
Dewey moves fast, limping his way to the level's edge.
He approaches the railing and makes his way around to
the shining light.
He reaches it, finding nothing but a camera and tripod.
It sits alone against the railing. Dewey surveys the
second level. Empty seats everywhere. Completely bare.
Dewey looks down to the main floor... to Gale who looks
up to him.
GALE
Dewey?
DEWEY
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
Dewey turns to leave, his eye catching a monitor that
hangs level with the railing. On the monitor, Gale is
in frame, looking up at Dewey, her face fear stained.
She takes a step forward, moving out of frame,
revealing
THE GHOST
Who stands right behind her. Dewey looks down to see
the Ghost standing directly behind Gale.
DEWEY (CONT'D)
Watch out!
DOWN BELOW
Gale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killer's
knife as it darts out of the darkness. Gale catapults,
just dodging it. She moves like lightning up the aisle
of seats.
UP ABOVE
Dewey races for the stairs, going as fast as his
handicapped leg will allow.
DOWN BELOW
Gale tears out the exit door, the Killer right behind
her.
AT THE LECTURN
Dewey arrives, searching, looking for Gale.
DEWEY (CONT'D)
Gale!
He eyes the exit door as it slowly closes. He moves for
it.
Gale races down the hallway, eyeing the nearest door.
She tears it open, disappearing into...
Gale finds herself in the student studios. She stands
in a huge control booth that overlooks a dubbing stage.
Lots of glass walls and doors. It has a maze quality.
Gale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room.
Darkness everywhere Gale stops for a second, listening
as she main door CREAKS open. And then FOOTSTEPS are
heard, making their way towards her.
Gale proceeds deeper into the studio. She moves into a
sound proof room and closes the door. Not seeing the...
GHOST FIGURE
That stands behind her. She turns around and SCREAMS.
She starts out, but then realizes he's standing in the
control booth. She's protected by a clear, large,
plexiglass window that wraps around the room. The ghost
moves out the side door, heading her way. He disappears
out of view. Gale freaks. She races to the door, trying
to secure it. There's no lock.
AT THE MAIN DOOR
Dewey slips through quietly, trying his best to be
quick on his toes. Through the control booth window, he
immediately spots Gale.
INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
Gale looks for objects to block the door with. She
drags a shelf of sound equipment towards the door.
OUTSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
Dewey moves to the window.
DEWEY
Gale! Gale!
She doesn't hear him. The room is sound proof. He BEATS
against the glass. Still, she doesn't turn to him.
INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
Gale shoves everything she can find against the door,
not seeing or hearing Dewey as he POUNDS against the
sound proof barrier behind her.
She also doesn't see the Killer that appears behind
Dewey. He moves on him swift and focused.
INSIDE THE DUBBING STAGE
Gale can't take her eyes off the door. Her face is
terrified. If she'd only turn around, she would see
Dewey - his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled
into him repeatedely. With each thrust, blood is
splattered against the glass.
IN THE CONTROL BOOTH
Dewey SCREAMS for his life, caught completely off
guard. He falls forward onto the control panels.
Suddenly, microphone feedback tears through the studios
as Dewey's CRIES are heard throughout the stage.
IN THE DUBBING STAGE
Dewey's DEATH SCREAM rips through the room.
Gale turns to the window to see Dewey, his face smashed
against it, blood smeared across the glass. She moves
to the window, her face only inches from his. A moment
as their eyes meet. Dewey's life is near gone. His eyes
reveal it.
Gale BEATS against the glass window.
GALE
(through tears)
NOOOOOOO!
Dewey's body slides down, out of view. Gale is
mortified. She looks to the Killer who has already made
his way through the control booth. He's coming for her.
She races to the door, throws the things away.
She manages to pull the door open just enough to slide
through. And she's off and running.
Gale finds a door and plows through it, stopping only
long enough to lock it.
BAM! The Ghost RAMS it from the other side but it
holds. Gale surveys her surroundings. She's in a
storage room. She eyes another door. She moves through
it and out into...
THE HALLWAY
Gale shoots down it.
CUT TO:
The theatre is big and old. Plush chairs, balcony, huge
proscenium stage.
Sidney enters through a side house door. She pulls on
it, releasing the emeregency lock. She makes her way
down the aisle toward the orchestra section.
SIDNEY
Hello?
The stage is dark and bare with the exceptions of the
furniture from the DEATHTRAP set. BUMP! A noise from
the stage wings.
SIDNEY (CONT'D)
Hallie?
Sidney moves down front to the little bridge that
extends out over the orchestra pit. She crosses it and
moves to stage center, peering into the wings on either
side of her.
Complete darkness.
DRIP! DRIP!
Something drips down from above and onto Sidney. She
wipes it from her face when...
CLICK! A spot light turns on from the back of the
house, illuminating Sid center stage. She jumps at
this, unnerved. She looks to her hand, covered in
crimson. Then out to the house... the light is
blinding.
CLANK! A NOISE from above..ropes, pulleys moving. Sid
looks up as a set wall comes PLOWING down at her. She
leaps out of the way, falling to the floor.
The wall falls into place on the stage. It is the back
wall of the set that's dressed with framed pictures and
antique weapons and...
DEWEY
Who hangs from it, pinned up against the wall, very
much deadk, arms outstretched, crucified. His body a
bloody mess. Sidney stops, stunned. She stands frozen
in unspeakable horror. Her entire being ripped apart.
She breaks into tears. And then...
Sid backs up, moving, racing toward the wings when
another wall flies in, sealing the backstage area off,
trapping her. She looks in shock at...
HALLIE
Strung up, her body hanging lifeless. Sid SCREAMS,
turning, running to the other side of the stage when a
third wall comes flying in, creating the three walled
set of DEATHTRAP.
Attached to it, is the body of Joel. Dead. Blood
everywhere. And then, Sid hears...
CLAPPING!
A single pair of hands from somewhere in the house...
applauding. She turns around and spots a FIGURE moving
down the aisle. She can't make out who it is.
Sid bolts. She spots the set door up center, near
Dewey's body. She goes for it, ripping it open to
find...
COTTON WEARY STANDING IN THE DOORFRAME
Sid SCREAMS. But then sees his face, he looks scared.
And then, Cotton's body falls forward to the floor, his
arms and legs bound by electric tape.
Sid turns back to the front of the stage. The Figure is
now walking across the bridge, holding something... a
light attached to a video camera. She's being filmed.
Sid looks back to Cotton who looks up to her with
pleading eyes.
COTTON
Quick, untie me.
Sid is paniced. She doesn't know what to do. She leans
down to untie him but stops.
VOICE
(from behind video
camera)
You've seen this movie before,
haven't you?
Sidney looks to the voice. The camera is pulled away to
reveal...
DEREK
He smiles at her.
DEREK
Smile for the camera.
Sidney remains silent.
COTTON
Sid, c'mon.
Side backs away from Cotton. She doesn't trust either
one of them. Derek watches her, amused.
DEREK
Go on, untie him.
SIDNEY
No. This is a set up.
DEREK
That's quick.
COTTON
Please, Sidney, he's going to kill
us.
Derek begins filming again.
DEREK
You must be dealing with some
serious trust issues right about
now.
Sidney says nothing. She egdes away, moving to the wall
where Hallie hangs.
DEREK (CONT'D)
Sidney, you can't keep your back to
the audience like that. Could you
cheat a little forward for me?
COTTON
Please, Sidney.
DEREK
You're really stumped, aren't you?
You know there's two killers but
you don't know who they are. I'm a
given. The boyfriend. Way obvious.
But now you're torn. Everyone else
appears to be dead. Except for
Cotton. Hmmm? Hmmm?
Suddenly, Hallie comes to life behind Sid, reaching
out, grabbing her. Sid JUMPS. She spins around to find
Hallie breaking out in a torrent of GIGGLES. Very much
alive.
HALLIE
Paaaaiiin... yah, such pain... The
story of your life, Sid.
Sidney stares in mortal shock as Hallie cuts herself
down from the wall with a big hunting knife.
DEREK
Need some help, honey.
HALLIE
I got it..
Sidney's eyes go back and forth between the two.
DEREK
You should really see your face
right now, Sid. It's doing some
freaky shit.
Derek's right. Sid's face appears completely tortured.
HALLIE
Yeah, you look quizzical yet
pensive.
DEREK
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have
any questions regarding the sequel
of your life?
Sidney stares them down. She's been here before.
SIDNEY
Why?
DEREK
Good question. You took the bait.
HALLIE
Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS?
Well, Derek and I have this whole
Mickey/Mallory-Woody
Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing
going on.
DEREK
I really don't like that
comparison, honey.
HALLIE
(to Sid)
He hates Oliver Stone.
DEREK
I find his work overwrought.
Sid is waning.
HALLIE
C'mon, Sid, don't fade on us. We've
been planning this baby for a year.
Humor us.
Sid turns to Cotton. She kneels down and begins to
untie him.
DEREK
Nope. You had your chance.
Derek dummy lunges at her with the knife. Sid backs
off.
CUT TO:
Hallie and Derek move around Sid, taking turns filming
her with the camera.
DEREK
We met on the internet.
HALLIE
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
DEREK
I read her postings on the horror
movie chat boards and fell
hopelessly. Hook, line...
HALLIE
We have our own website now. We
dedicated a whole page to you.
DEREK
You'd me amazed at how many of us
there are out there. It's a whole
world, Sid. You're really popular
amongst the demented.
HALLIE
You're the one who got away.
DEREK
Until now.
COTTON
You guys are fucked.
HALLIE
Actually Cotton, and I think
critics would agree, it's the other
way around.
DEREK
Poor Cotton, could life be a little
more cruel?
SIDNEY
You're not going to get away with
this.
HALLIE
Of course not. Who wants to? What's
the point if we don't get caught?
Where's the glamour in that?
DEREK
The way I see it. We'll be
arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on
the home footage. Secure a book
deal. If all goes as planned, our
trial should coincide with the
release of STAB II.
HALLIE
A verdict and premiere all on the
same day. I love it.
DEREK
We're hoping for the death penalty.
I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING
swan song exit planned.
HALLIE
And now, drum roll please...
DEREK
Hope you're ready, Sid. We got one
last surprise for you.
Cotton pull and twists on his bound wrists. Sid had
loosened them somewhat. He tries to finish undoing
them.
HALLIE
A twist ending if you will.
DEREK
Yeah, we really had our work cut
out for us. It really is the curse
of the sequel. The Billy/Stu
thing's been done.
HALLIE
... so we had to be different but
yet the same because if you venture
to far away from your orginal story
you completely alienate the
audience...
DEREK
And we didn't want to do that, Sid.
We wanted to give you your money's
worth.
HALLIE
So we found a compromise.
DEREK
Or it found us.
HALLIE
We have a surprise guest star
waiting in the wings.
DEREK
Just for you, Sid.
HALLIE
Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to
flip.
Derek reaches in his pocket for a coin.
DEREK
Oh yeah.
(to Sid)
We figure the one of us that
actually kills you will get a
little more press. It's been an
ongoing discussion.
(to Hallie)
Heads or tails?
HALLIE
Tails.
He flips the coin.
DEREK
Shit! You win.
IN THE AUDITORIUM
Gale emerges from the lobby. She found a way in. She
eyes the proceedings on stage. She sees Sidney standing
over Cotton. And then Hallie and Derek on either
side... knives in hand. She races down the aisle.
GALE
Sidney!
ON STAGE
They all turn, spotting Gale. Sid moves forward, happy
to see her.
SIDNEY
Gale!
IN THE AUDITORIUM
Gale moves down the aisle, not sure what's going on.
ON STAGE
Sidney moves down center. Derek cuts her off just as...
THE CURTAIN DROPS
Gale glimpsed the terror on Sidney's face just as the
curtain separates them.
ON STAGE
Derek grabs Sidney, holding her, the knife at her
throat.
HALLIE
It's about time she showed up.
IN THE AUDITORIUM
Gale moves to the exit door and into the...
Gale eyes a door that's marked "STAGE DOOR". She opens
it and steps in coming face to face with a...
A LARGE AUTOMATIC REVOLVER
Gale's eyes move down the end of the gun to find...
DEBBIE SALT
standing, lips pursed.
DEBBIE SALT
Hello, Gale, we've been waiting for
you.
Gale's face is a mass of confusion.
Derek releases Sidney, shoving her, she falls to her
knees, next to Cotton.
CLOSE ON COTTON'S HAND
SIDNEY
Okay, look, you guys - I applaud
your methodical expertise but I
have a question. What's going to
happen after I die? I thought the
heroine is supposed to live.
HALLIE
Not this time.
Hallie moves in on her.
DEREK
Yeah, we're trying to send a
message to Hollywood. I'm really
getting tired of all the happy
endings. It's just not reality. In
the real world the good guys die,
the innocent are punished, and the
murderers inherit the earth.
SIDNEY
But nobody wants to see that. It'll
never go. They'll rewrite you. You
don't want that.
HALLIE
Oh, Sid, you're sounding desparate.
I guess fearing death makes one
anxious.
SIDNEY
You fucking freaked out movie nut
psychos...
VOICE
(off camera)
Don't blame the movies, Sid. Movies
don't create pyschos.
Sid stops dead in her tracks as these words still her
very soul. The Voice comes from the wings. They all
turn as Gale Weathers appears. Behind her, with gun in
hand, is Debbie Salt. Derek grabs the camera. He
doesn't want to miss a second.
DEBBIE SALT
Don't you know that by now? It's
about family. It all starts at
home. It starts with the father...
and the mother.
Sidney mouth drops, her face aghast, as she looks to
Debbie Salt. She recognizes her immediately.
SIDNEY
Mrs. Loomis?
Gale stops cold.
GALE
What?
SIDNEY
Oh my God.
Gale turns to Debbie Salt.
GALE
Jesus. It can't be.
HALLIE
Told you we had a guest star.
Didn't see that coming, did you?
DEREK
Everything's taken on a hyper-
reality, hasn't it?
GALE
You're Billy's mother?
DEBBIE SALT
I couldn't believe you didn't
recognize me. You even interviewed
me for your book.
GALE
You're all in this together?
DEREK
We had to have financing.
HALLIE
Tuition's expensive.
SIDNEY
Why Mrs. Loomis?
DEBBIE SALT
Where should we start? Your mother
ruined my marriage by sleeping with
my husband. You ruined my family by
killing my son. Gale aired it to
the world. Should I go on... isn't
that enough?
GALE
Jesus, you're just as whacked as
your son.
DEBBIE SALT
Where do you think he got it?
Mental illness is heriditary. Who
do you think incouraged him to kill
your mother? He was a smart kid but
children need parental guidance.
Sidney is completely horror stricken. She stands in
total disbelief.
DEREK
Yeah, she's been great, Sid. We
never would have been able to it
without her.
Debbie Salt/Mrs. Loomis looks to both Derek and Hallie,
smiling.
DEBBIE SALT
And I couldn't have done it without
you two. Now who won the coin toss?
Hallie raises her hand.
HALLIE
I did.
Debbie points the gun at her, quickly, simply... and
FIRES. Sid and Gale SCREAM as a bullet through the
forehead sends Hallie flying back against the flat
wall. Her body drops to the floor. Dead.
Derek drops the camera, completely taken back. He looks
to Debbie.
DEREK
What are you...
Debbie turns the gun on him. FIRES AGAIN. Derek moves,
the bullet catches him in the stomach. He drops to his
knees. Debbie FIRES again. Derek takes another bullet.
This time dropping. Very dead. His body falls near
Cotton who has remained suspiciously quiet through this
ordeal. He eyes Derek's knife that now lay near his
wrists.
SIDNEY AND GALE
Turn to Debbie in complete horror.
DEBBIE SALT
Nice kids but a little out there.
GALE
What are you going to do?
DEBBIE SALT
Finish what my son started.
GALE
But you'll never get away with it.
DEBBIE SALT
Enter Cotton Weary.
Cotton looks up.
DEBBIE SALT (CONT'D)
Think about it. An innocent man
wrongly accused. Spends time in
prison where he justs sits with his
righteous anger, waiting, planning
his revenge. His life so
incomprehensively ruined he's
forced to take revenge on the
people responsible. It's perfect.
COTTON
No... not again.
DEBBIE SALT
Sorry, Cotton. I guess you were
just meant to be a killer.
SIDNEY
You'll never get away with this.
Debbie moves to Cotton, shrugging.
DEBBIE SALT
Who would you like to shoot first,
Cotton?
Just then, Cotton leans up, freed from his bindings.
With the knife in hand, he lunges for Debbie Salt. It
strikes her, lodging into her chest. She goes back.
Cotton doesn't stop, he stabs her again and again. She
goes down. Dead.
GALE
Thank God.
Gale rushes to Cotton as he jumps to his feet. She
helps him with the last of his bindings. Sid looks
about at the body count on stage. It's mounting. She
takes a deep breath. Relieved.
GALE (CONT'D)
God, Cotton, what a nightmare. I'm
so sorry.
COTTON
Yeah...
Gale gives him a hug.
CLOSE ON COTTON'S FACE
GALE
Thank you.
He hugs her back. She doesn't see as he rises the knife
behind her, bringing it down in one swift, maniacal
move. Gale's body jerks, a moment of shock and then she
goes limp as the knife lodges in her back.
Sidney turns just in time to see Cotton toss Gale's
body down into the orchestra pit. He turns, facing
Sidney. The bloody knife in hand.
SIDNEY
NOOO!
Cotton moves to Derek's body where the video camera
lay, he pulls the tape from it.
COTTON
It's perfect, Sidney. No one will
ever suspect me. I have proof. I'm
the victim.
SIDNEY
Please, Cotton, don't do this.
He holds up the video cassette. Murder in his eye.
COTTON
I get my revenge and make some fast
cash.
SIDNEY
It's over, Cotton.
COTTON
Not until you're dead.
Cotton lunges for her. Sid tears off, slipping through
the set door to...
BACKSTAGE
Sid runs to the rear of the stage. She moves in the
narrow space that exists between the scrim and the back
wail. She races down it.
She almost reaches the end when COTTON RIPS THROUGH THE
SCRIM!
Sidney ducks, bypassing him. She comes to the stage
door. It's locked. She turns, seeing the metal ladder
that's attached to the wall. It leads to the catwalk
above.
Sid goes for it. She climbs up the ladder with
lightning speed.
Cotton, up and running, is close behind.
The catwalk sits above the open fly space where flats
and a large chandelier are stored in the air.
Sid reaches the top and takes off running down to the
ending.
AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I'VE GOTTEN.
WHAT HAPPENS IS SID AND COTTON FIGHT TO THE FINISH, HE
CHASES HER THROUGH HANGING FLATS, THEN DOWN THE FLY
RAIL, BACK TO THE STAGE. SID GETS FINDS A KNIFE AND
STABS COTTON.
HE STABS HER BACK. THEY FIGHT, CONTINUING TO STAB EACH
OTHER UNTIL THEY BOTH DROP CENTER STAGE. THEY LAY NEXT
TO EACH OTHER, NEITHER ABLE TO MOVE. THEIR EYES SLOWLY
CLOSE.
THE END (FOR NOW)
