          The outskirts of Bangor.  A few prostitutes, johns and
          panhandlers linger along the sidewalk.  Walt and Johnny
          show Erica's picture around.  Walt stops a prostitute -
          TAMI, 25ish with long dark hair, a micro-mini skirt and
          boots.  She turns to walk away...

                        Sorry, officer, I was just waiting
                        for my mother to pick me up.

          She lights up as she recognizes Johnny.

          She playfully opens her fake fur jacket to REVEAL a lacy
          push-up bra.  Walt quietly enjoys Johnny's awkwardness --

                        Let me get this straight.



          Johnny stands in front of a suburban house.  A perfectly
            manicured lawn.  Clouds FLASH QUICKLY across the blue sky
          above him.

          He notices a FLASH SERIES OF SCHOOL BUSES dropping and
          picking up students.  A bus stop.  He notices the number
          on the bus -- 226.



          A school bus waits for the kids to climb aboard.  AS THE
          CAMERA PANS the bus we see the number 226 printed on the
          back end.

          The CAMERA CONTINUES OFF the back of the bus and FINDS
          Walt and Johnny trailing it in Walt's cruiser.



          Walt and Johnny sit across the street from the Vision

          Walt approaches, Johnny slightly behind him.  ROSCOE and

          Roscoe nods as he breaks off with the others.

          the strap on his holster and presses the DOORBELL.

            A massive WIDE SHOT: a thin RIVER splits miles of open
            farmland.  A CAR drives alongside it.



          A river bank off a dirt road.  Linda leads Walt and Johnny
          to an embankment near the river.  Next to an old, abandoned
            refrigerator and some other discarded debris.

                        on my face as the sun broke over
                        that ridge.

          Time spins back.

          Johnny notices Linda, bound and blindfolded.

          And then ANOTHER GIRL stands behind him.  Hands bound in
          front.  Dirty.  Emaciated.  A girl we've never seen before. 
          She CRIES uncontrollably.

          Johnny watches her wander off down the river embankment.

          strikingly horrific images he's just experienced.

                        My name is Sarah Bannerman.  I
                        got your address from the Sheriff's
                        department -

          The woman's cold detachment suddenly becomes apprehensive
          concern.

                        You haven't been contacted yet?

                        Phone's out of order and I've
                        been gone since mornin'. 
                                (beat, warmer)
                        I know what this is.  I told the
                        man my car's been in the shop.

                                        SARAH
                        Your car?

                        It's hard to hunt for a job without
                        one.  I only need another few
                        days to make things right.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm sorry, are we talking about
                        the same thing?

                        You came here to collect the rent
                        money.  Like I said, my car...

                        I'm here about Erica.

          The woman's demeanor shifts again -- hard and cold.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm sorry to be the one to tell
                        you this, but your daughter is
                          missing.

                        No.

          The woman moves to close the front door.  Sarah puts her
          hand up to stop it.

                                        SARAH

                          daughter is in trouble.

          The woman holds herself still for a moment, then looking
          Sarah straight in the eyes...

                                        DENISE
                        I got no daughter.  Not for nearly
                        three years.

          She shuts the door, leaving Sarah quietly stunned and
            confused.



              A gas/food/lodging/weigh station.  Walt, Johnny and Linda
          step out of the car and smell something bad. 

                                        WALT
                        What's that smell?

                        Not the blue plate special, I
                        hope.

          Linda has a specific, but subtle reaction to it.

                                        WALT
                        Take my coat inside.  I'm gonna
                        show the picture around... see if
                        anybody recognizes her.

          Linda watches intensely as Walt drops his car keys into
          his jacket pocket and hands it to Johnny.



          Johnny runs outside to find Walt talking to a few truckers.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did you see her?

                        Not that I saw.  John?

          Johnny RUSHES towards the parking lot, Walt quickly
          FOLLOWS.



          An empty parking spot.  Walt's cruiser is gone.  There it
          is.  The cold hard reality of it.  Off Johnny...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:


          Johnny and Walt stand in the parking lot.

                                        WALT
                        How the hell did she get my keys?

          Johnny thinks BACK...



                                        WALT
                        She must have realized we were
                        close to finding him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There was something she remembered,
                          a sound, a taste, a... smell.

          Johnny glances back into the diner.



          Walt rushes out of the diner and blocks the path of the
          big truck --

                                        WALT
                        County Sheriff!  Stop your vehicle!

          Walt climbs up into the passenger side of the cab and
          turns to look though the front window at Johnny.

                                        WALT
                                (SHOUTS to Johnny)
                        You comin' or not?!



          Metal gates closed, but not locked.  KEEP OUT -- NO
          TRESPASSING signs all around.  Across a weed strewn parking
          lot stands the silent behemoth, the massive soap factory. 
          250,000 plus square feet of production, packaging, business
          offices and assorted rooms and chambers.  The ideal place
          to keep another human being captive.

          Walt and Johnny jump down out of the cab of the big rig,
          as the truck powers away up the dark mountain road.

                                        WALT
                          Somebody forgot to leave the lights
                        on.

                        Not a bad place if your hobby is
                          kidnapping.

          They open the gate and make their way towards the shadowy
          factory.


  7474FAR SIDE OF THE STRUCTURE

          They come around the corner to FIND Walt's cruiser, the
          driver side door is open.  Walt quickly checks the car.

                                        JOHNNY
                        At least we know she's here.

                        And why she took off.

                        came here to kill him.  

          Walt grabs the hand mic.  Off the dash.

          Johnny looks at his watch.  It reads: 11:35PM.

                        We can't wait for them.

                        Which might be one minute longer
                        than Erica has to live.

          Walt pops the trunk, pulls out a bullet-proof vest and
          hands it to Johnny.

          OUTSIDE.  Walt, Johnny and Eric duck behind Walt's cruiser
          just as there's a HUGE EXPLOSION and the structure begins
          to implode. 

          Johnny looks around, but Linda and the Unmasked Man are
          nowhere to be found.

          The SHOT PUSHES TIGHT on Johnny's silent anguish, his
          eyes lit by the burning factory.



          An old truck is the only vehicle on a dark, lonely highway.
