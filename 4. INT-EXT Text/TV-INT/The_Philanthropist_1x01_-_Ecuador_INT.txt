      BETTY LYNN, twenty-three, a sharp-tongued cowgirl, is
      bartending.  Her clothes are so tight they look as though
      they shrank in the dryer.  TEDDY's face is blocked by a Red
      Scarlet digital camera, which he is using to film his current
      surroundings.  She places a tequila in front of him.

                    I was trying to get the vaccine to
                    the village before all the people
                    there died.

                                      BETTY LYNN
                    Boy oh boy, I have heard alotta pick
                    up lines since graduating high school,
                    yours takes the blue ribbon.

                                      TEDDY
                    I'm not trying to pick you up --
                    well, I am.  But I'm not lying about
                    the vaccine.

      BETTY LYNN pffts.  He aims the camera at her, says casually: 

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    I'm Teddy Rist.

                                      BETTY LYNN
                    Teddy Rist, the billionaire?

                      Ninety-ninth richest man in the
                    universe.  As of last Thursday.    

                                      BETTY LYNN
                    A week ago, I had a guy in here,
                    says he's Justin Timberlake.  I'll
                    ask you what I asked him: with all
                    that dough, what're you doing in a
                    dump like this?

                                      TEDDY
                    My jet needed refueling.

      BETTY LYNN snickers a ha-ha-ha.  He lowers the camera. 

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                      A Gulfstream G550, it's next door at

                          (takes her hand)
                    C'mon, I'll show you. 

      She shakes his fingers loose.  TEDDY smiles, knocks back the
      tequila, indicates he'd like another.  She grabs the neck of
      the bottle and pours, laughing dismissively.

      WIND HOWLS, a torrent of rain.

                                      TEDDY (v.o., cont.)
                    I was sleeping off a night of
                      bacchanal, which is the Greek word
                    for too much of everything.

      TEDDY lies sprawled out on bed, naked, unconscious.  KNOCK
      on door. 

                                    MALE VOICE
                    Mister Rist?

      TEDDY's eyelids half open.  The back of his eyes hurt.  He
      moans, barely audible:

                                      TEDDY
                    Do not disturb, the sign says "do
                    not disturb" --

      KNOCKING, more insistent.  TEDDY's pupils start to focus and
      he sees a beautiful POLYNESIAN WOMAN next to him, asleep. 
      He only has the vaguest of memories who she is.

                                    MALE VOICE
                    Mister Rist, please --

      Groggily, TEDDY mumbles a curse, swings his legs off the bed
      and -- SPLASH, his feet land in water.

      Instantly, he is jarred into consciousness by the sensation
      and pulls his feet back out.

      TEDDY's POV -- The room is thigh-deep in water.  Pieces of
      clothing (discarded in the throes of passion) and other
      objects float by.  On top of the bedstand, still above sea
      level, rests his wallet and Windows Sg-2520 SAT phone.

      RESUME TEDDY, trying to figure out what the fuck is happening.


                                                                (CONTINUED)      "The Philanthropist"                                      4.

                    Mister Rist, please open the door --

      Resigned, TEDDY puts his feet back in the water.  He's naked
      and his clothes are soaked, so he grabs pillow and places it
      over his jewels.  He steps off bed and wades to the door,
      which he unlocks and forces open.  Standing in the hallway
      are the HOTEL MANAGER and a local POLICEMAN.

                                      HOTEL MANAGER (cont.)
                    I am sorry, Mister Rist, the typhoon
                    is stronger than was forecast.  Damage
                    to the island is massive, power lines
                    are down, homes are gone, many are
                    drowned.  The waters continue to
                    rise at a rapid pace.  We must
                    evacuate.  You must come at once.

      TEDDY presses his thumb and index finger into his eyes, trying
      to squeeze away the pain.

                                      TEDDY
                    Okay, but there better be coffee.

      He opens closet.  Shirts and pants hang above the water.  He
      slips a pair of pants off hanger, tosses it over to bed,
      where the POLYNESIAN WOMAN is just coming to.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    I hope the pants fit.

      She's so beautiful.  If there was time, he'd fuck her again.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                    You're next, Mister Rist.

      TEDDY is about to get into the last free seat when he sees a
      six year old native BOY, terrified and alone.

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    That's when I saw him, this kid...

      The BOY's eyes lock onto TEDDY's.

                                      MAXINE
                    Worse comes to worst, I'll send a
                      helicopter from Nauru for you.

                                      TEDDY
                          (to HOTEL MANAGER)
                    Take him first.

                                      HOTEL MANAGER
                    The boy?  He is no one.  A beggar.

                                      TEDDY
                          (the boss)
                    Take him first.

      Obeying, HOTEL MANAGER lifts up the BOY and places him in
      the last remaining spot.

                                      MAXINE
                    I also have the Governor-General's
                    cell phone.

      As the boat casts off, the GUESTS, remaining on the balcony,
      panic and push brusquely forward, voices wailing.

                                      HOTEL MANAGER
                    Be patient.  There will be more boats.

                                      TOURIST
                    When?  I don't want to die --

      TOURIST forces his way through the CROWD and leaps off the
      balcony onto the boat, catching the side and causing it to
      capsize.  The PEOPLE on board disappear beneath the water.

      TEDDY watches, anxiously, as heads start to reappear -- the
      POLYNESIAN WOMAN among them.

      BUT NOT THE BOY.

      TEDDY searches the surface of the floodwaters, but after a
      two-count, he drops his phone and dives into the foam.


                                                                (CONTINUED)      "The Philanthropist"                                      6.

                    Teddy?

      Underwater: TEDDY dives, on the lookout for the BOY -- whom
      he spots, arms flailing, drowning.  TEDDY propels himself
      deeper into the water and grabs the CHILD.

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    You have to understand: I am not the
                    heroic type.  Reckless, yes. 
                    Superman, hardly.  I learned long
                    ago -- no matter how much money I
                    have -- bullets don't bounce off me.  

      On the surface: TEDDY bursts out of the water clutching the
      BOY, then swims to the balcony, where he hands off the kid.

                                      TEDDY (v.o., cont.)
                    I saved the boy but, in an odd way,
                    he saved me.

      The BOY looks at TEDDY, gratefully.  As TEDDY smiles,

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      TEDDY takes a beat, struggling to articulate the torment in
      his soul.  Instead, he says with a grin:

                                      TEDDY
                    Let me get back to you on that.

      As he holds up empty shotglass,

                                                                                FADE TO:

      FADE IN:


      TEDDY faces BETTY LYNN, as he sips tequila.

                                      TEDDY
                    The one thing I do best is forget.


      TEDDY sits, rocks glass in hand, wearing a silk bathrobe,
      eyes downcast, waging an emotional war in his head.

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    I forget -- until I remember.  Then
                    the memories flood my brain, like a
                    typhoon in Tuvalu.


      DAX VAHAGN, late thirties, of Armenian extraction and an
      Iraq war veteran, pilots the plane.  He pushes intercom.

                    Teddy, we're about a half hour outside
                    of New York.


      TEDDY finishes his drink.  Sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT enters,
      holding a Kiton suit on a hanger.

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    And the face of a drowning child
                    brings back all the demons.

      As TEDDY rises and drops his bathrobe,

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      PHILIP MAIDSTONE, early forties, handsome, walks along,
      reading text message and none too happy with its contents.

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    Oh, I gotta tell you about Philip
                      Maidstone, my co-CEO and best friend.

      A woman's arm reaches out and pulls PHILIP into:


      The WOMAN, arrestingly beautiful, in her late thirties, backs
      PHILIP against a wall and kisses him, passionately, long
      enough for us to hear:

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    And his wife Olivia, who runs our
                      corporation's charitable foundation. 
                    One of the most extraordinary -- and
                    sexy -- women in the solar system.

                                      BETTY LYNN (v.o.)
                    Ooo, you wanna bang her, dontcha?

                                      TEDDY (v.o.)
                    We dated early on.  A disaster of
                    space shuttle Challenger proportions.

      PHILIP and OLIVIA break kiss.  They are a WASP power couple,
      attractive and stylish, with pedigrees dating back to the
      Mayflower and the libido of rabbits.

                                      PHILIP
                    That was one of your "I'm-happy-about-
                      something" kisses.

                                      OLIVIA
                    The big fund-raiser.  Donations just
                    topped ten million dollars.

                                      PHILIP
                    You rock.

      He kisses her this time, with equal passion.

                                      TEDDY (o.c.)
                    Do I have to hose you kids down?

      They break, turn to see TEDDY in doorway.

                    I'm thinking our foundation should
                    send a check.

                                      TEDDY
                    Sure.  Checks are nice.

                    Okay.  The most important thing is,
                    at Thursday's board meeting, the

                    I've been on the phone all morning
                    with the White House, the
                      International Red Cross, Catholic

                    massive earthquake in Ecuador.

                    The administration down there sucks
                    at handling emergency relief, too
                    much bureaucracy.  And they've refused
                    the U.S. offer of aid, because they
                    don't want to look weak.

                    they've got, massive poverty,
                      insurgents all over the place, the

                    Have the hotel send a messenger to
                    the Gulfstream, get a bottle of
                    Blanton's out of the bar.

      Doctor ALICIA FLORES, late twenties, a combination of Florence
      Nightingale and Scarlett Johansson, stands at doorway.

                    Uh, I didn't exactly study at a
                    school.  When you're crawling your
                    way up, you learn to zig and zag.

      this dance before.

                    for Puerto Napo -- that's the village
                    hit hardest by the tremors, where I

                    Doctor Flores, we've come to help,
                    but we keep hitting road blocks. 
                      Ambassador Korman thought we might --

                                      ALICIA
                    There is a case of vaccine at the
                    airport, which was supposed to be
                    delivered to my clinic days ago. 
                    When it did not arrive I drove here
                    to fetch it.  But I cannot get the
                      government officials to release the
                    box to me.

                                      TEDDY
                    A box of vaccine.  I gotta tell ya,
                    I was thinking of doing something
                    more on a Bruckheimer scale.

                                      ALICIA
                    This vaccine can cure two hundred
                    victims.  Which, in turn, will stop
                    the spread of disease to hundreds
                    more.  Big gestures often don't change
                    anything, the smallest ones do.  If
                    you only save one life, you still
                    have saved one life.

      TEDDY is impressed by this woman.  And she's hot.  

                                    SIPE
                    Why won't the government release the
                    vaccine?

      TEDDY, SIPE and ALICIA talk to BAGGAGE HANDLER.  A SOLDIER
      stands nearby, silently belligerent.

                    No puedo hacerlo.

      TEDDY surreptitiously drops a balled-up wad of U.S. currency
      on the floor.  He then pretends to see it and asks innocently:

                     Es el suyo?

      BAGGAGE HANDLER looks down, grabs the money.

      SERGEANT yells at ALICIA.

      TEDDY admires her courage.  SERGEANT aims gun at ALICIA.  

                                      TEDDY
                    Hey, hey, hey, don't go pointing
                    that thing at her.

      SERGEANT shoves gun in TEDDY's face.  DAX draws his gun. 
      Drunken SOLDIER enters with his gun.  A standoff.  TEDDY is
      unafraid.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Put the gun down, Dax.  Go back and
                    guard the plane.

                    Take a walk, damnit.

      DAX lowers gun, exits.  SERGEANT laughs, takes out handcuffs.

      4 A.M.  Almost deserted.  TEDDY sits with an empty shot glass,
      brooding.  On the jukebox, "Crazy In Love" by Beyonc  PLAYS. 
      WAITER arrives with another vodka.

                                      TEDDY
                    I hate this song.

                                      WAITER
                    You played this song.  Ten times.

      TEDDY takes the empty shot glass and fires it at the jukebox. 
      The projectile hits the top of the jukebox, which shatters,
      the SONG slows and dies.

                                      TEDDY
                    Put that on my bill.

      WAITER nods, starts to go.  TEDDY grabs his arm.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Andr s, my trusted friend, I'm craving
                    something a tad more potent than
                    vodka, if you catch my drift.

                                      WAITER
                    I do, Mister Rist.
                          (whispers)
                    The man in the middle booth.

      TEDDY sees a SLEAZY MAN in the middle booth.

                                      TEDDY
                    Geez, how could I not have known.

      He rises, crosses to the booth, then stops -- suddenly TEDDY
      has a solution to the problem.  He smiles at the SLEAZY MAN.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Hola.

      SLEAZY MAN stares at him, blankly.  

                                      TEDDY (cont.)

      On the SLEAZY MAN, recognizing the dialogue,

      She enters the makeshift clinic and is immediately engulfed
      by the pale faces of the ill and dying.

                    Alicia, in the meantime, had returned
                    to Puerto Napo, where the situation
                    was deteriorating with heartbreaking
                    speed.

      ALICIA, defeated, sighs.  As she touches the burning forehead
      of a sickly OLD WOMAN,

      He wills the phone to RING.  It does.  He lifts receiver.

                     Hola?   Hola?

      There's no one there.  Hear a VOICE from his balcony.

                                      VOICE
                    Beautiful night, yes?

      TEDDY hangs up phone, heads toward the VOICE.


      TEDDY opens door.  Five of the most beautiful WOMEN in the
      universe are standing in the hallway.

                    Tsk.  Poor kids.

      As the "ORPHANS" come inside,

                    Orphans are very needy.  Especially

                    That's despicable.

                    Yeah, but, I never said I was perfect.

                    A car, then?

                    A car would not make the journey. 
                    The roads -- because of the quake --
                    are inconsistent.

                    That'd only get you to the edge of
                    the rainforest.  The truth is, because
                    of the rebels, the trip is far too
                    perilous.

                                      TEDDY
                    Then what do you suggest?

                    No offense, but I'm not trusting
                    this vaccine to anyone.  I will
                    deliver it myself.

                    That's okay.  I have a better idea.

      TEDDY, talking on phone, stands alongside SIPE in front of
      the Gulfstream, as DAX sits in a 1942 Boeing Stearman Model
      75, used for crop dusting.  The case of vaccine is on the
      tarmac.

      TEDDY hangs up, points to the Stearman.

                                    DAX
                    I can try.  

                                    SIPE
                    This is suicide.  Parachuting.  At
                    least take the Gulfstream.

                                    DAX
                    Y'can't jump out of a Gulfstream. 
                    And there's no airstrip big enough
                    on the other side of the mountains
                    to land the plane.

                                    SIPE
                          (re: the crop duster)
                    That tin bucket won't make it over
                    the Andes.  You'll crash and burn -- 

                                      TEDDY
                    Sipe, I appreciate your concern --

                                    SIPE
                    It's not you I'm concerned about,
                    it's me.  Bringing the body of Teddy
                    Rist back to New York, that's a career
                    killer.

      TEDDY laughs, slips on parachute.  SIPE, desperate, tries
      another tactic:

                                    SIPE (cont.)
                    Here's a thought: Maidstone-Rist has
                    a factory in Peru --

                    Just over the border.  Why?

                                    SIPE
                    Dax and I could take the jet down
                    there, get one of the company's
                    trucks, be back in a day or less.

                                      TEDDY
                          (stops, thinks)
                    Peru...
                          (takes off parachute)
                    A good leader knows when to listen
                    to his troops.  We go with your plan. 

      He hands parachute back to DAX. 

                                    DAX
                    You were scared, huh?

                    standing here?  Take off.  

      DAX slips out his gun, offers it to TEDDY who takes it and
      hides it.  DAX and SIPE go into the plane.  TEDDY's cell
      RINGS.  He answers it, as he walks away from the jet.

                    Olivia told me what you're up to --

                    Oh, and how much did it cost to fly
                    the jet down there, huh?  You're

                    I didn't mean to imply mismanagement

                    fade away. 
                          (shakes her head)
                    Hell, I can't blame you.  Everyday I
                    wish I could... Fade away...

      She starts to cry.  HEAR "Gravity" by Sara Bareilles.  OLIVIA
      goes to MORGANA, embraces her, comforts her.  Over their
      shoulders, on a table behind the couch, is a photo of MORGANA,
      TEDDY and a three year old BOY.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      SONG CONTINUES.  MAXINE, KYLE and other SENIOR STAFF MEMBERS
      watch PHILIP emerge from his office with BURTON, laughing
      and patting each other on the back.  On MAXINE, turning to
      KYLE, worried,

                                                                          CUT BACK TO:


      SONG CONTINUES.  PHILIP and BURTON wait at elevator, as doors
      woosh open, revealing OLIVIA.  BURTON smiles at her, then
      enters the elevators.  The doors close.  As OLIVIA stares at
      PHILIP, whose face is an enigma,

                                                                          CUT BACK TO:


      MORGANA molds the clay bust; then stops, staring at the image. 
      As she reaches over and squeezes the clay with her fingers,
      destroying her work,

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      CU on TEDDY's face, eyes fluttering open.  As he focuses,
      CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL an ECUADORIAN BOY, gazing at him. 
      ALICIA appears next to the BOY, shoos him away. 

                                      TEDDY
                    I made it.

                                      ALICIA
                          (joking)
                    Yeah.  What took you so long?

                                      TEDDY
                    And the vaccine?

                                      ALICIA
                    Already kicking in.  Look. 

      TEDDY's POV -- PEOPLE, standing on line, getting vaccinated.

      RESUME ALICIA, who smiles.

                                      ALICIA (cont.)
                    I don't know how I will ever repay
                    you.

      As TEDDY smiles,

                                                                          SMASH CUT TO:


      TEDDY smiles at the memory.

                                      TEDDY
                    Her eyes were on fire, so alive, so
                      beautiful... We made love that night
                    under the moon...


                                                                (CONTINUED)      "The Philanthropist"                                     58.

                    Haw.

      The sound brings TEDDY out of his revelry.

                                      BETTY LYNN (cont.)
                    I ain't buying this cock'n'bull story.

                                      TEDDY
                    Come with me, I'll take you back
                    there to prove it to you.  Or to
                    Paris.  France, not Texas.

                                      BETTY LYNN
                    If I go with you to the airport and
                    there's no super-duper jet, all my
                    friends who work over there are gonna
                    call me a fool.  Ansley Barber put
                    you up to this, didn't he? 

      TEDDY takes out checkbook, writes, rips the check out.

                                      TEDDY
                    Here's a check for one hundred
                    thousand dollars.

      She takes it, examines it, rips it into pieces, which she
      tosses in TEDDY's face.  He puts up his hands.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    That's it, I surrender.  I'm leaving.

                                      BETTY LYNN
                    Hoo-ray.

      TEDDY exits.  BETTY LYNN clears his glass, wipes bartop. 

      On TV: CNBC -- Teddy's face is on the screen.  BETTY LYNN
      turns up the sound.

                                      BARTIROMO
                    -- Rumors are flooding Wall Street
                    that Philip Maidstone is abandoning
                    his long-time partner Teddy Rist, in
                    favor of an alliance with DeWitt
                    Burton --

      HEAR the sound of a jet.  She looks out window.

      BETTY LYNN'S POV -- A Gulfstream G550 soaring.

      RESUME BETTY LYNN, mouth agape.  As she scoops up the pieces
      of the hundred thousand dollar check and starts trying to
      reassemble it,

                                                                                  CUT TO:      "The Philanthropist"                                     59.

      TEDDY sits, eating Bean Buddies.  SIPE is on computer.

                                      TEDDY
                    How're those numbers coming?

                                    SIPE
                    Pretty good.  If we produce the Amazon
                    perfume in Puerto Napo, instead of
                    Brazil, we'll add about five million
                    dollars to the local economy in the
                    first year alone...

      TEDDY nods, ponders the countryside passing below.  He reaches
      for phone, speed-dials.

                                      VOICE
                    The Maidstone-Rist Foundation.  

                                      TEDDY
                    Peter?  Teddy for Olivia.

      He leans down, picks up his son's metal top (from Morgana's
      apartment) and puts it on the table in front of him.

                                      TEDDY (cont.)
                    Hey... I'm on my way back... So,
                    what else needs fixing?

      TEDDY pushes down the red knob.  As the top SPINS, colors
      twirling, full of life,

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            THE END
