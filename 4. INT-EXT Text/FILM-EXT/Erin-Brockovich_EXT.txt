Palms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars
motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls
of mockingbirds mingle with the BLIP BLIP of car alarms.
ON THE SIDEWALK, a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk,
past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flops,
Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes ... then, in the middle of
this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE-
HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop.
So high it hurts to look
at them.
As the shoes leave frame, we TILT UP and see
they're leaving a 99-cent store.
As the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are
connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG, SHAPELY LEGS.
Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going.
They saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break.
The men
pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful
woman.
In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes
rest on her a microsecond longer than usual.
- Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming the
tops of her thighs.
- A MAILMAN spots the BIG, DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into a
MOUNTAIN OF BIG, BLOND HAIR.
- A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of the
TIGHT, BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER.
It isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block
that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is
so goggle-eyed.
Eye-catching is an understatement.
All
those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic have
obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH.
A side street.
No pedestrians, just parked cars.
A PARKING
TICKET flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai.
ERIN
Fuck.
Even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to
her voice.
Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze.
As she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses
accidentally CLATTER to the ground.
ERIN
Shit.
When she picks them up, a fingernail snags on the pavement.
ERIN
God damn it.
She tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in.
WIDER ON THE STREET
The Hyundai starts it up, signals.
Then, just as it pulls
slowly out into the street, a JAGUAR barrels around the
corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side
of Erin's car, sending it CAREENING into the median.
It
SMASHES into a foot-thick lightpost.
And stops.
A boring building on a boring block in the Valley, surrounded
by strip malls.
Definitely not where the power lawyers work.
ROSALIND (O.S.)
Morning, Mr. Masry.
How you doing today?
A shitty little house in a shitty part of Northbridge.
The
Hyundai with a bashed-in side pulls up to the curb.
Erin gets out, takes the mail from her mailbox, then heads
over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell.
A Hispanic woman in her 60's opens the door, holding a white
baby.
This is MRS. MORALES.
MRS. MORALES
Hi, Erin!
You're back so soon.
How was it?
She hands Erin the baby.
It's BETH, Erin's 9-month old.
Erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby.
ERIN
Hi, sweetie.
Were you a good girl?
Where
are Matt and Katie?
MRS. MORALES
Outside with the sprinkler.
So it's good?
The truth is too depressing to share.
ERIN
It'll be fine, yeah.
MRS. MORALES
Ai, bueno.
Because I didn't want to tell
you before, with your worries --
ERIN
What?
MRS. MORALES
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a
room for me.
I'm going to move in with her.
ERIN
You're moving away?
When?
MRS. MORALES
Next week.
ERIN
(stunned)
Wow, that's soon --
MRS. MORALES
I know.
But it's good for me.
Now I can
help my daughter take care of my grandkids.
And it's good for you, too.
Now you have
money, you can find a good babysitter, huh?
Not the old lady next door.
Oh, God.
In Erin's arms, Beth starts to COUGH.
Erin carries Beth up to her house.
As she nears her door,
she steps on a GIANT WATER BUG.
It crunches under her sole.
ERIN
Ugh.
Insult added to injury.
She heads up to the house, dragging
her shoe, wiping off the bug guts.
Matt and Katie are messing around with a gumball machine.
Erin is at the door, taking Beth from the BABYSITTER, a
shabby, unkempt-looking woman in her 40's.
Katie and Matt
pull on their backpacks and troop out of the sitter's house.
Erin is leaving the store, carrying Beth in one arm and a bag
of groceries in the other.
Katie and Matt are each carrying
a bag of groceries as well.
They are all singing and moving
with the jaunty step of the newly carefree.
Katie spots a
flower display outside the store.
KATIE
Mommy, can I get a flower?
ERIN
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
Erin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what
used to be Mrs. Morales's house.
A few MOTORCYCLES are
parked on the lawn; A FEW BIKERS are drinking beer on the
stoop; and one asshole is on his bike, REVVING HIS ENGINE.
ERIN
Hey!
But of course he can't hear her.
She walks over to him,
stands right in his line of vision.
ERIN
HEY!
He sees her and kills the engine.
Everything about GEORGE
HALABY is tough -- his denim, his leather, his bike, his long
hair.
Everything but his eyes, which twinkle like Santa's.
GEORGE
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
ERIN
What the hell do you think you're doing,
making all that Goddamn noise?
GEORGE
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
ERIN
Well, I'm the neighbors.
There, now we're
introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
The guys on the porch chuckle.
Erin turns and starts back to
her house.
George hops off his bike and follows her.
GEORGE
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a
beautiful woman next door, I'da done this
different.
Let's start over.
My name's
George.
What's yours?
ERIN
Just think of me as the person next door who
likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
GEORGE
Now, don't be like that.
Tell you what.
How about if I take you out on a date to
apologize for my rudeness?
Erin shakes her head in disbelief and keeps walking.
GEORGE
Come on.
Gimme your number, I'll call you
up proper and ask you out and everything.
She stops at her porch, turns to him.
ERIN
You want my number?
GEORGE
I do.
ERIN
Which number do you want, George?
GEORGE
You got more than one?
ERIN
Shit, yeah.
I got numbers coming out of
my ears.
Like, for instance, ten.
GEORGE
Ten?
ERIN
Sure.
That's one of my numbers.
It's how
many months old my little girl is.
GEORGE
You got a little girl?
ERIN
Yeah.
Sexy, huh?
And here's another: five.
That's how old my other daughter is.
Seven
is my son's age.
Two is how many times I
been married and divorced.
You getting all
this?
16 is the number of dollars in my
bank account.
454-3943 is my phone number.
And with all the other numbers I gave you,
I'm guessing zero is the number of times
you're gonna call it.
She turns and heads inside.
He calls out after her:
GEORGE
How the hell do you know your bank balance
right off the top of your head like that?
See, that impresses me.
Katie and Matt are running up to the house.
Erin follows,
toting Beth under one arm and the box of documents under the
other.
She steps on another water bug.
ERIN
Ugh.
As she wipes the bug guts off the bottom of her shoe:
GEORGE (O.S.)
Hey, neighbor, wanna beer?
She spots George on his stoop, with a six-pack beside him.
ERIN
No.
GEORGE
C'mon.
I bought 'em for you, to make up for
that night.
ERIN
Return 'em.
Maybe you'll get your money
back.
He gets up and follows her to her house.
GEORGE
Now, why're you giving me such a hard time?
I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.
Erin turns to him.
The kids are waiting at the door.
ERIN
I had a good neighbor, George.
She was 60
and Mexican and she watched my kids for
free.
Something tells me you're not gonna
be able to measure up to that.
GEORGE
You need help with your kids?
I could
probably do that.
George reaches out and grabs the box from under her arm.
ERIN
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
GEORGE
Why not?
ERIN
Cause I don't even know you.
GEORGE
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
He's got a point there.
After a beat:
GEORGE
What, you got so many friends in this world,
you don't have use for one more?
Large.
Looming.
Very establishment.
Through the windows,
we see Erin at the desk, talking to a LIBRARIAN.
She has the
file in her hands.
Over this:
ROSALIND (O.S.)
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
ERIN (O.S.)
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.
Brockovich.
From the file room?
I was wondering if you
could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up
on that real estate thing out of the office.
The librarian gives her directions to somewhere else.
Smaller, but still establishment.
Erin's Hyundai pulls into
the parking lot.
The beat-up old Hyundai heads east out of L.A.
DISCO MUSIC
blares from its speakers.
This is a dry, desolate part of California.
No downtown, no
community.
Just tract after tract of arid farmland, with
small, bland, unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the
landscape like occasional tombstones.
A beat-up old sign on the road reads: "HINKLEY, CA.
POP: "
but the
corner where the number would be has broken off.
As a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields, Erin turns onto
Community Boulevard, the main road that cuts through Hinkley.
A generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of
nothing.
There's a pool out back and a chain link fence
hugging the property.
No landscaping.
Dull, but clean.
A
few BOTTLES OF SPRING WATER wait by the door.
The Hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops.
Erin gets
out.
As she heads up to the door, her spike heels sink into
the dirt.
She rings the bell.
It has a melody chime.
DONNA IRVING opens the door.
She's 35, petite, with a
scrappy, high-strung manner.
She's wearing tight jeans, and
her dark curls are piled on top of her head.
ERIN
Hi.
Donna Irving?
DONNA
Yes?
ERIN
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
DONNA
(a little surprised)
You're a lawyer?
ERIN
Hell, no.
I hate lawyers.
I just work for
them.
You got a minute?
Erin opens the door to find George attaching bars to her
windows.
ERIN
What're you doing?
GEORGE
Better safe than sorry.
She shakes her head, amused by his persistence.
ERIN
You want some coffee, George?
Erin clips down the block in short-shorts and high-heeled
boots.
Up ahead a few of DOWN-ON-THEIR-LUCK MEN are out on a
stoop, drinking their breakfast.
Erin approaches them.
ERIN
Hi, y'all -- how you doing today?
MAN 1
Hangin' in, baby.
How about yourself?
ERIN
I'm okay, I'm just fine.
I was wondering --
could I maybe ask you a couple questions?
She settles down on the stoop with them for a chat.
Erin towers over DAVID FRANKEL as she walks across campus
with him.
He's the grittier variety of scientist: Patagonia,
Birkenstocks, bushy beard.
He's as dry as dust, and as much
as Dr. Paulsen responded to Erin, Frankel barely notices her.
FRANKEL
What kind of chromium is it?
ERIN
There's more than one kind?
FRANKEL
Yes.
There's straight-up chromium -- does
all kinds of good things for the body.
There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and
then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium,
which, depending on the amounts, can be very
harmful.
ERIN
Harmful, like -- how?
What would you get?
FRANKEL
With repeated exposure to toxic levels --
God, anything, really -- respiratory
disease, liver failure, heart failure,
reproductive failure, chronic headaches,
bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of
course, any type of cancer.
He rattles it off coolly.
Just facts.
Erin's stunned.
ERIN
So that stuff -- it kills people.
FRANKEL
Oh, yeah.
Definitely.
Highly toxic, highly
carcinogenic.
Bad, bad stuff.
ERIN
Well, how do I find out what kind of
chromium is up in Hinkley?
FRANKEL
Have you been to the water board?
ERIN
Hunh-uh.
What's that?
FRANKEL
Every county has one.
They keep records of
anything water-related within their
jurisdiction.
You should be able to find
something there.
ERIN
County water board.
All righty, thanks.
FRANKEL
Good luck.
(beat)
Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're
looking for if I were you ...
His line continues over:
Erin's Hyundai pulls up and stops in a cloud of dust.
FRANKEL (O.S.)
... Incriminating records have a way of
disappearing when people smell trouble.
Erin hops out, checks her reflection in the side-view mirror,
then heads into the building.
It's gotten dark.
Erin's Hyundai's still there.
Erin's Hyundai rumbles to a stop in front of the house.
Erin
shoves open the creaky, reluctant door, lifts her box of
stuff off the seat, and gets out.
As she walks around the car and toward the house, she runs
into the MAILMAN.
He hands her a packet of mail.
MAILMAN
Here ya go, Miz Brockovich.
Erin looks at the top of the stack.
It's the electric bill.
Erin's Hyundai zips along the freeway.
"Funky Town" is
blaring from the tinny stereo.
Over it:
MATTHEW (O.S.)
I hate this music.
The Hyundai is parked at the entrance to the station, by a
row of dead trees.
Erin is standing beside a sign that says
"Private Property.
No Trespassing", taking pictures of the
massive structure in the distance.
Matthew, Katie, and Beth
are drawing in the dirt with sticks.
ERIN
Stay out of the road.
I'll be right back.
She wanders up the drive, onto PG&E; property, moving around
the plant, taking pictures of it from every possible angle.
As she wanders over a big, flat, dry field to the side of the
plant, she glances over her shoulder to check on her kids and
notices the trail she made in the dirt has a greenish hue.
She looks at the dirt right her feet.
Kicks the ground.
Below the surface, the dirt turns from brown to green.
Erin
notes this, then looks back at her kids playing in the dirt.
Worry comes over her face.
She heads back to them.
The kids are waiting at the car.
Erin comes out of the store
with a bottle of water and uses it to rinse off their hands.
The sound of a BABY CRYING.
The Hyundai's parked in front.
MATTHEW (O.S.)
I'm hungry.
From the door, Erin watches Donna run to the edge of the pool
in a frantic response to this news.
DONNA
OUT OF THE POOL!
BOTH OF YOU, OUT OF THE
POOL, RIGHT NOW!
SHANNA
How come?
DONNA
CAUSE I SAID SO, THAT'S WHY, NOW GET OUT!
OUT!
NOW!!!
Erin watches compassionately as Donna flails to get her kids
out of the contaminated water.
Dry, flat California.
Ed's big old Mercedes is toodling down
the freeway, at an overly safe, almost-geriatric speed.
The Mercedes pulls to a stop on the shoulder.
Erin gets out,
walks around to the driver's side.
Opens the door.
ERIN
First of all, don't talk baby talk to your
wife in front of me.
It really undermines
your authority.
And second, I know you're
my boss and all, but you are the worst
fucking driver I've ever seen.
Move over or
I quit.
He moves over.
She gets in, turns off the Sinatra.
They
pull back out onto the freeway in silence.
The Mercedes and a truck are parked out front.
PETE (O.S.)
There's something about this whole thing I
don't quite understand, Mr. Masry.
Another day.
BOB LINWOOD, 40's and gruff, is in the barn,
tossing hay around.
ERIN (O.S.)
Excuse me.
Are you Mr. Linwood?
He sees Erin picking her way toward him in her high-heels.
LINWOOD
Yeah?
ERIN
I'm Erin Brockovich.
I work at the law firm
that represents your former neighbors the
Browns.
They suggested I give you a call.
She steps in a cow patty.
Laughs at herself good-naturedly.
ERIN
Boy howdy, did I ever wear the wrong shoes.
CLOSE ON A SIGN that reads: THE DESOTOS, hanging on the side
of a small, paint-chipped house.
Erin is at the door talking
to MARY DESOTO, 65, who's wearing a big cross at her breast.
ERIN
... and Mr. Linwood seemed to think that
your husband had been sick as well.
MARY
Yes, Mr. DeSoto has lung cancer.
Never
smoked a day in his life, neither.
Ed and Erin are walking down the street, take-out coffee cups
in their hands.
Ed is sipping his, but Erin is in too much
of a lather to drink hers.
ED
Hunh-uh.
Absolutely not.
ERIN
That's crazy -- why not?
ED
Because I said no.
Look -- the only reason
PG&E;'s even talking to us is cause this is a
quiet little real estate dispute.
We add
plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle
of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem --
against a massive utility.
No, thank you.
They go into their office building.
Erin, in high heels and miniskirt, is straddling a ditch,
scooping clumps of gunky moss from the ditch into plastic
containers.
Over this:
ERIN (O.S.)
Dr. Frankel, it's Erin Brockovich.
Tell me
something: if I wanna find as much evidence
of hexavalent chromium contamination as I
possibly can, what should I do?
As Erin labels the containers, her heels slide down the side
of the ditch, and she lands smack in it, knee-deep in gunk.
Erin, now completely dirty, is climbing over a fence marked
"No Trespassing".
Her arms are full of more containers.
FRANKEL (O.S.)
Well, what you have to remember is, if you
have hex chrom in the water, you have it in
anything that lived off the water.
She adds them to a growing collection of containers in the
trunk of her car.
Another day.
This time it's RAINING.
Erin minces her way
down to the deep end of the pool in her spike heels.
FRANKEL (O.S.)
What I'd do is start a collection.
Anything
that existed in water, on water, under water
...
She gets to the deep end and scoops up a Ziploc full of
rancid pool water and seals it.
FRANKEL (O.S.)
anything that had water flow over or under
it ...
Erin spots a few dead frogs in the water.
She picks one up
by the leg, and seals it in a plastic bag as well.
With a sample cup held in her teeth, Erin hauls herself up
over the well's concrete wall, then, with her back against
one side of the well and her feet against the other, starts
shimmying down the well.
FRANKEL (O.S.)
anything that had water pass through it ...
INSIDE THE WELL
she winces at the algae and gook that's clinging to her as
she descends to the water level.
When she's low enough, she
takes the sample cup from her teeth and scoops up the water.
Erin's car is parked in front.
A DIRTY OLD PICK-UP comes
rumbling up the road.
When its lights hit Erin's car, it
slows, then pulls over.
The driver flicks on his BRIGHTS to
get a better look at the car.
The truck sits there for a
bit, a dark presence.
Then, as the headlights of another car
appear down the road, the truck goes back in gear, pulls out
and drives off.
Open pits, pony rides, watermelon.
George is watching Katie
and Matt being led around on ponies, an activity that stopped
being fun hours ago.
Now they're just hot and tired.
BY THE BARBECUE, Ed is talking to an OLDER COUPLE as they
sign retainer agreements.
ELSEWHERE, Erin, holding Beth, is looking at pictures of a
swimming pool with FIVE OTHER WOMEN.
The water is green.
ERIN
This was the community pool?
WOMAN 1
Yeah, that PG&E; built.
The whole time we
thought it was algae that made it so green.
LATER ...
Erin's trunk is open.
She and Ed are clipping new clusters
of retainer agreements into the "PLAINTIFFS" binder.
LATER STILL ...
Erin and Ed are passing out informational pamphlets.
She
sticks one in a hand before noticing that it's George's.
GEORGE
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
ERIN
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.
(as he heads off)
Take her, will you?
George drops the pamphlet and takes Beth from Erin.
He heads
over to Matt and Katie, sitting glumly on a log.
As he steps away, a hand reaches down and grabs the flier he
dropped.
It belongs to a MAN IN A BLACK JACKET.
He's in his
50's, strong and sinewy.
Military-style dark glasses obscure
his eyes.
He scans the pamphlet, then watches Erin working
the crowd.
Watches her carefully.
He slides the pamphlet
into his inside pocket, and heads back his car -- the DIRTY
OLD PICK-UP TRUCK that idled in front of the Water Board.
LATER STILL ...
Erin is heading over to George and the kids, ready to leave,
when Donna comes up to her, with A MIDDLE-AGED MAN in tow.
DONNA
Erin, this here's Frank Melendez.
He works
over at the compressor station --
Erin stops in her tracks, very interested.
LATER STILL ...
Erin and Frank are on a bench, talking.
Out of the corner of
her eye, she sees her car drive off.
George's hand sticks
out the driver's side and flips her the bird.
She watches
him disappear, then, hiding her rage, turns back to Frank.
ERIN
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?
LATER ...
The barbecue is winding down.
Ed is heading for his
Mercedes.
Erin storms up beside him, mad as all get-out.
ERIN
I need a ride.
The curtains are drawn; everything is dark.
Ed and Erin are
at the door, talking to Mike, who looks drawn and tired.
MIKE
She was about to take a handful of these --
He shows them a bottle of prescription pills.
MIKE
It's a morphine thing -- for pain --
Erin nods, then leaves Ed with Mike and heads toward:
George, in his leather and denim, is walking down the
sidewalk.
As we WIDEN, we see he's pushing a PINK STROLLER.
He stops at a crosswalk, waiting for the light to change.
In the stroller, Beth starts to whine.
George reaches in his
pocket, finds her pacifier.
As he's leaning down to give it
to her, he hears a RUMBLE coming down the street behind him.
The roar grows.
He stands, looks.
A GROUP OF ABOUT TEN
BIKERS has pulled up next to him.
He looks at them.
They
look at him, then at the stroller.
George feels ridiculous.
When the light changes, the bikers REV LOUDLY and pull out.
George just stands there and watches them go.
Late, late at night.
The plant is silent.
The property
seems empty, until we notice Pete Irving standing alone
inside the gates, staring up at the station.
After a beat, he picks up a rock and hurls it at the plant.
It misses.
Not that it would do anything if it hit.
He
reaches for another, throws it.
Then another, and another.
He hurls rock after rock at the gigantic plant.
Then,
overwhelmed by his impotence, he lets out a TERRIFYING YELL.
Erin is sitting out front, swigging cough syrup from the
bottle.
She checks her watch: 6:30.
The GAS STATION
ATTENDANT comes out, locks up, and turns out the lights.
ERIN
This is the only station in town, right?
ATTENDANT
Yup.
He gets in his car and drives off.
Erin sits down again.
Looks down the road in both directions.
Nothing.
Then she spots, behind some bushes across the street, a glint
of chrome.
She shields her eyes against the sunset and sees:
the BEAT-UP TRUCK parked behind some shrubbery.
Erin looks around, realizes she's alone.
As she looks back
at the truck, the ASH of a cigarette brightens in the cab.
She realizes she's being watched.
The driver's door opens.
Erin bolts for her car, scrambling to find her keys.
She
jumps in, locks her doors, and tries to start her car, but it
won't turn over.
Panic.
The Man in the Dark Glasses has
gotten out and is heading toward her car. Erin looks around
again.
Not a soul.
She tries the engine again.
And again.
Just as he gets to her car, the engine engages.
Erin peels
out of the gas station.
The Hyundai zips down the road.
And behind it, the truck.
The Hyundai going faster.
The truck still following.
Crappy and pink.
Ed's Mercedes pulls into the parking lot.
Erin's Hyundai follows.
Ed stops, gets out.
Erin and Ed amble down the porch, checking door numbers, each
rattling a key.
They find their adjacent rooms and stop.
Erin leans against the wall, too weak to stand.
ED
Lock the door every which way you can.
And
if there's anything -- funny sound, whatever
-- pound on the wall.
I'll come right over.
She nods a little.
Then before she goes into her room:
ERIN
I think you should know -- there's very few
people in the world who don't piss me off 90
percent of the time.
(beat)
You're one of 'em.
It's as tender as she gets, and he's moved by it.
They look
at each other.
Maybe even considering.
But after a long
beat, she reaches for her door again.
Moment over.
ED
I'm triple locking my door, so don't even
think of trying to take advantage.
She smiles, goes inside.
He watches her close her door
behind her before going inside himself.
George is sitting alone on the stoop, drinking a beer.
Music
is coming from his house next door.
He stares out into the
street with a lot on his mind.
The Hyundai pulls into the lot.
Erin drives up in the Blazer, pulls into a parking space.
Bob Linwood is in his barn, mucking it out.
Theresa is at
the edge of the property, trying unsuccessfully to get his
attention by yelling and waving her arms.
In her expensive
shoes, she's stopped short of the cow patty minefield.
Theresa still hasn't gotten Linwood's attention.
Finally,
rather than ruin her shoes, she picks up a stone and tosses
it at the barn.
It hits the window and BREAKS IT.
Erin gets to her car.
As she opens the door, the ALARM
SOUNDS.
She fumbles with her keychain, trying to turn it
off, but she's too sick and upset to figure it out.
With the
siren still blaring, she kicks at the car in rage.
The parking lot is empty, except for three Mercedes.
Ed,
Potter, and Theresa are in the doorway, going over their
notes.
A TRUCK pulls into the lot.
The lot is filling with more cars and trucks; headlights
criss-cross each other as people pull in from all directions.
One more car pulls into the lot.
It's Erin's Chevy.
Erin gets out of the car, looks around, then goes over to a
window and looks in at the packed meeting.
PLAINTIFF (O.S.)
And then a jury decides?
POTTER (O.S.)
No, sorry, I should have mentioned that.
There's no jury in binding arbitration.
No
jury, and no appeal.
She climbs up on an old wagon for a better view.
BOB LINWOOD (O.S.)
No appeal?
So what are our options if we
don't like the result?
POTTER (O.S.)
Well -- you have none.
The judge's decision
is final.
But I really don't anticipate
that as a problem.
Erin watches the meeting fall apart.
It's driving her crazy.
ERIN
Fucking idiot --
Meeting's over.
The plaintiffs stream out of the firehouse.
Cars start up, headlights flick on.
People pull away.
Everything's closed, except the KINKO'S store at the far end.
Erin's truck pulls into the parking lot.
Erin's Chevy pulls into the parking lot.
MATTHEW (O.S.)
I don't want to stay here.
It smells.
Very early.
Erin is visible in the motel office, talking to
the clerk, when George's motorcycle pulls into the lot.
She
turns around and sees him pulling up next to her Chevy.
Erin comes up to him, hands him a key.
ERIN
I got you your own room.
He takes it, glances toward the motel room.
GEORGE
They up?
ERIN
Hunh-uh.
Not yet.
(awkward beat)
Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike,
okay?
Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
She hands him a wad of cash.
GEORGE
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
ERIN
I don't know.
Few days.
(beat)
Thanks for helping me.
I appreciate it.
He nods.
She gets into her car.
Before closing the door,
she turns back to him.
ERIN
And I miss you.
GEORGE
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
She sees how mad she's made him.
Takes a beat.
ERIN
I treated you real bad, George.
I know
that.
But, my problem was -- I never been
with anyone who deserved better than that.
You're the first nice guy who ever liked me.
George softens, shifts.
He steps toward the truck and gently
closes her door, so he's standing close to her.
ERIN
I just ... didn't know how to handle it.
That's all.
He thinks about this.
Finally:
GEORGE
Think you could learn?
ERIN
(with a smile)
You know me.
I pick things up real fast.
He smiles back at her, nods, then tenderly brushes a piece of
hair out of her eyes.
GEORGE
You shouldn't be driving around, you know.
You're sick.
ERIN
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.
A lot of
these folks aren't.
He nods, understanding.
Then he taps the side of her truck
and turns toward the motel room.
She puts the truck in gear
and pulls out.
Erin's Chevy is bombing down the road.
Donna's gardening out front, her head wrapped in a scarf to
cover her chemo-thinning hair, when Erin's Chevy pulls into
the driveway.
Erin gets out, goes to the back of the truck,
gets two of the release forms, then heads over to Donna.
The door opens.
Erin emerges, holding two signed agreements.
Donna is letting her out.
ERIN
You wouldn't happen to have a little time
right now, would you, Donna?
DONNA
For what?
ERIN
Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns
now.
I was thinking -- Mandy really values
your opinion ...
From outside, we see Erin at the kitchen table with Donna and
Bob and Ruth Linwood, who are listening intently.
People are going about their shopping.
Rita Daniels is
stopped, talking with A FEW MORE PLAINTIFFS.
RITA
I thought so, too, but Erin says a trial's
gonna take years
Morning.
A GROUP OF MEN are arriving at work.
Erin's truck
pulls up.
She grabs some release forms from the truck and
wanders up to the men.
ERIN
Hey, y'all.
How you all doing today?
Morning drop-off time.
Erin is handing out release forms zo
a GROUP of MOTHERS who just dropped off their kids.
Erin is leaning on the hood of her truck, going down her list
of plaintiffs, checking off the ones who have already signed.
CLOSE ON ERIN'S TRUNK.
A bunch more forms get thrown onto
the signed stack, which is now much higher than the unsigned.
ERIN (O.S.)
I'm gonna head out to Barstow and talk to
some folks out there tonight.
WIDEN TO REVEAL Erin talking on a nearby pay phone.
GEORGE (O.S.)
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
ERIN
I will.
Bye.
She hangs up.
As she turns to get into her car, she finds
herself face-to-face with the Man in the Dark Glasses.
ERIN
Jesus!
He's just standing there, a foot away, blocking her exit.
She recognizes his truck as the one that chased her.
ERIN
Okay, what're you gonna do?
You gonna kill
me?
Dump my body in a ditch somewhere?
Or
maybe you just wanna inject me with some
poison too -- why change tactics at this
stage of the game?
(beat)
Get outta my way, you make me sick.
She pushes past him.
But he grabs her by the arm.
He's a
big guy; it's a strong grab.
Now she's scared.
For a
moment, he does nothing.
Just looks at her.
Then:
DARK GLASSES
If PG&E; made someone destroy a whole lot of
documents -- would that matter to you?
Erin takes a beat, realizing she completely misread him.
She
gently pulls her arm away.
ERIN
Well ... I guess that depends on what the
documents were.
(she takes a beat)
I'm sorry -- I didn't get your name.
DARK GLASSES
Embry.
Charles Embry.
Erin comes out of the office, flushed with success, and heads
down the hall.
She presses the elevator button.
The doors
open.
As she steps on, Ed comes out of the office.
ED
Hey!
Erin puts her hand in the door, keeping it from closing.
He
stares at her, in awe.
ED
I don't know what to say.
ERIN
Say you were wrong.
ED
I was wrong.
ERIN
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged
yourself.
ED
I did.
Both.
ERIN
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on
Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
ED
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe,
Erin.
The luckiest son of a bitch in
history.
He looks down the hall at her, standing so tall and proud in
the elevator.
He walks toward her, stops right outside the
elevator.
ED
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
ERIN
How do you know that?
ED
(with a smile)
Cause you got a little voice in your head
saying, do the right thing.
Give him
another chance.
Of course she will.
She releases her hand so he won't see
her smiling.
Ed watches the doors close.
DISSOLVE TO:
One of those days when the bay sparkles like a glitter ball.
Erin's Chevy moves up the PCH.
DISCO music emanates from it.
Erin gets out of her new truck, looks, sees the Irvings in a
little cluster.
Donna's under an umbrella.
Pete is
slathering on sunscreen.
The two girls zip out toward the
water.
Erin waves.
Pete and Donna spot her, wave back.
Donna is standing at the edge of the water, watching her
girls boogie board in.
Erin comes up behind her.
ERIN
How you feeling today?
Donna turns, sees her.
Smiles.
DONNA
It's a good day.
I feel good.
ERIN
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it,
maybe we should talk shop.
Erin sits down on a rock.
ERIN
The judge came up with a number.
DONNA
A number for the whole group, or for us?
ERIN
Both.
Donna sits down next to her.
ERIN
He's making them pay the maximum.
Tears of vindication spring to Donna's eyes.
DONNA
Oh, my God.
ERIN
And he's making them give five million of it
to you all.
DONNA
Five million dollars?
ERIN
Five million dollars.
She reels.
After a breathless beat:
DONNA
I don't even know how much money that is.
ERIN
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for
whatever your girls need, for whatever your
girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
Donna wipes the tears off her face, then watches the light
flickering off her girls playing in the surf.
DONNA
I can put them in a good school.
ERIN
Any school you want.
DONNA
And get someone to help around the house.
ERIN
Yup.
DONNA
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Donna is overwhelmed.
Erin pulls her close.
DONNA
Oh, my God.
Now this is where the hot lawyers work.
A gleaming testament
to power.
