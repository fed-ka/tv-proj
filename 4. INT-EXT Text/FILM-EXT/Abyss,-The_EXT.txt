Blue, deep and featureless, the twilight of five hundred feet down.
PROPELLER SOUND.
Materializing out of the blue limbo is the enormous but
sleek form of an Ohio-class SSBN ballistic missile submarine.
5
We see only the effect, not the source, as a large diffuse light passes
rapidly under the sub's hull.
Moments later a shockwave, like an underwater
sonic boom, impacts the sub, slamming it sideways.
7
The cliff wall materializes out of the blue limbo off the port bow with
nightmarish slow-motion.
The sub slams into it with horrific force, scraping
along and bouncing off.
One tail stabilizer is sheared off and the big screw
prangs the wall with an earsplitting K-K-KWANG!
10
The great sub is being hauled down by the mass of its flooded bow section,
its flanks rushing past us like a freight train headed for Hell.
12
A tiny transmitter is ejected from the sub's hell and begins its long ascent
to the surface.
A second later the sub slams down like a piledriver onto a
ledge, tearing open its pressure hull.
14
In the cobalt twilight we see the Montana slide down the sea cliff, its hull
SCREECHING like the death agonies of some marine dinosaur.
Descending in an
avalanche of silt, it finally disappears into the blackness below... a
blackness which continues almost straight down, 20,000 feet to the bottom of
the Cayman Trough.
The abyss.
15
Above, in the world, the Caribbean rolling gray under a stormy sky.
The
Montana's emergency buoy pops to the surface, transmitting.
CUT TO:
16
LONG LENS SHOT: three massive Navy Sea King helicopters thundering straight
at us, FILLING FRAME.
REVERSE, as they barrel OVER CAMERA toward a lone civilian ship... an ugly
but very sophisticated deep-sea drilling support ship, the BENTHIC EXPLORER.
It is a twin-hulled monstrosity with a central opening in its deck, around
which crouch enormous cranes, winches and other arcane equipment.
The first Sea King settles onto the helipad, disgorging a contingent of Naval
officers, technicians, and a squad of armed seamen.
A pantomime in the
rotorwash, we see the Benthic Petroleum "company man" KIRKHILL greeting
COMMODORE DEMARCO, the on-scene commander.
18
1700 FEET BELOW.
A submersible oil-drilling platform, DEEPCORE II, an island
of light in the vast blackness.
Its main framework connects two "tri-
modules" consisting of three cylinders each.
These contain living and work
areas in a pressurized environment.
An umbilical cable, thick as a man's
thigh, runs up from the oil rig into the darkness, to the Benthic Explorer
at the surface.
In a bubble-like dome port window we see the rig foreman, or
"toolpusher," BUD BRIGMAN.
He's talking (via headset) with two divers
working outside... 'CATFISH' DE VRIES, AND LEW 'BIRD-DOG' FINLER.
BUD
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
CATFISH
(Kentucky drawl)
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out
here sooo much, boss.

A22
Flatbed's pilot, LISA 'ONE NIGHT' STANDING, can be clearly seen behind a
bubble canopy.
She is a no-nonsense lady who holds her own in the mostly
male environment by being one of the best submersible drivers in the
business.
She controls a hydraulic manipulator arm, assisting the diver,
ARLISS 'SONNY' DAWSON, in his work.
Little Geek hovers around them like a
tiny helicopter.
One Night moves the Flatbed arm to Sonny and hands him the
pipe.
ONE NIGHT
Here you go, hon'.
SONNY
Just in time, sugar.
They react to Bud's recall, looking toward him up in the control module.
ONE NIGHT
Dammit, we just got out here.
SONNY
There was a time when I would have asked why.
One Night makes a grab for his butt with the manipulator claw, which he
narrowly avoids.
CUT TO:
23
Flatbed moves underneath the rig, a few feet above the seafloor, with Sonny
riding on its top deck.
It passes under a lit opening and rises toward the
surface of the water in the chamber above.
Little Geek follows like an
obedient dog.
27
A single Navy Sea King churns through the rain under massive thunderheads.
The sea below is whipped by the storm.
28
PANNING ALONG BOOTED FEET, four pairs of black military size twelves line
up, onto... a pair of Charles Jourdans fives under shapely ankles.
WIDER, revealing the four-man team of Navy SEALs.
And a slender woman in
her early thirties.
She's attractive, if a bit hardened, dressed
conservatively in a skirt and jacket.
Meet LINDSEY.
Project Engineer for
Deepcore.
She's a pain in the ass, but you'll like her.
Eventually.
She's holding on grimly, sitting crammed in with the SEALs and a bunch of
gear, getting tossed around by the storm.
The SEALs are dressed alike in
black fatigues.
They are muscular, finely-tuned and extremely dangerous
special-forces types.
The leader of the SEAL team, LIEUTENANT COFFEY, makes
his way forward to the cockpit.
The pilot is white-knuckling his stick, trying to hold the great beast of a
helicopter in position.
Through the windshield, the deck of the Benthic
Explorer can be seen below, pitching in a violent sea.
PILOT
No way I'm putting her down.
I shouldn't even
be flying in this shit.
COFFEY
(cool)
Just hold it over the deck.
Coffey goes back to the crew deck, moving easily in the bucking craft.
He
nods to the others SEALs, MONK, WILHITE, and SCHOENICK.
In the open side
door, Wilhite clips a 100 foot nylon rope to the airframe and throws out the
coil.
One by one the shoulder the gear-bags, grab the rope, and step out.
Lindsey stands swaying in the chopper door, watching the SEALs fast-roping
to the deck.
One, two, three.
Coffey looks at her.
COFFEY
You want to be on that ship, there's only one
way it's going to happen.
He's sure she won't go for it.
It's his certainty that gets her.
She sets
her jaw.
Opening her purse she takes out a small plastic bag, puts her
shoes and purse in the bag, and grips the bag in her teeth.
Then grabs
the rope and slides down.
29
Swinging wildly in the wind like a human pendulum, Lindsey fast-ropes forty
feet to the deck.
She steps away an instant before Coffey hits behind her.
Lindsey crosses the rainswept deck with athletic strides.
Her nylons are
ruined.
An air-crewman in the chopper lowers two additional equipment cases
using the rescue sling.
The SEALs catch them as they swing radically across
the deck.
They Navy chopper banks and seems to scurry away before the
mounting storm.
CUT TO:
30
BLACKNESS.
Then shafts of light become visible, above a ridge of rock.
Flatbed appears, trailing two heavy two cables.
Behind it, the mass of
Deepcore emerges from the darkness, its forward lighting array blazing.
Flatbed is towing it like a tug, aided by Deepcore's own mighty stern
thrusters.
34
Ten foot waves crash through the launch-well, sending up geysers of spray.
Next to the launch-well, crewman have attached a lifting cable to CAB THREE,
eighteen feet of ugly yellow submersible.
It slams violently in its steel
cradle as the drill-ship rolls.
Coffey and Schoenick hand the gear bags in
to Wilhite and Monk though the hatch under the rear of the submersible.
Lindsey approaches, wearing a borrowed roustabout's coverall.
She looks down at the larger of the two equipment cases brought by the SEALs,
lying on the deck.
Stenciled on it are the words: F.B.S./DEEP SUIT/MARK IV.
Coffey and Schoenick push past her to pick it up.
LINDSEY
Let's go, gentlemen!
We either launch now or
we don't launch.
Coffey looks up in surprise as she nimbly climbs the side of Cab Three and
grabs the lifting shackle, circling her raised hand to signal the crane man.
LINDSEY
Take her up, Byron!
Cab Three, with Lindsey riding its back, is pulled up out its cradle and
starts to swing violently as Explorer pitches.
The submersible is then
swung out to the center of the launch well.
It sways and gyrates above the
furious water below.
Lindsey drops into the upper hatch.
38
Lindsey reaches up a grabs a red lever.
LINDSEY
Roger.
(to Coffey)
There's only one way it's going to happen...
She pulls the lever hard.
CLUNK-CLANG!
The shackle-release drops the sub.
It freefalls ten feet to the water with an enormous splash and keeps right
on going after Lindsey floods the trim tanks.
Coffey et al have been slammed
hard.
LINDSEY
Touchdown.
The crowd goes wild.
Explorer...
Cab Three.
We are styling.
MCBRIDE (filtered)
Roger, Cab Three.
Lindsey cuts on the floodlights and maneuvers the descending submersible so
that the umbilical cable is a few feet ahead on her front port.
Moving up
through her lights, it will guide her down to the rig.
Cab Three free-falls
into increasing darkness.
Soon it is a candle below us in the indigo.
39
One Night is driving the tug one-handed, pouring coffee from a thermos and
rocking out to the great truck-driving song "Willing" on the beat-box she's
got propped up on the sonar rig.
Fighting white-line fever in the best
tradition.
41
Lit up like a proud Peterbilt, the rig crossed the trackless wastes.
We
hear them singing, carried OVER.
42
In total blackness, the submersible descends along the rigorous line of the
umbilical cable.
Two hundred feet below it, the lights of Deepcore resolve
out of the darkness.
Now we can see the rig crawling over the ocean bottom
like some monster lawnmower.
LINDSEY (V.O.)
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on
final approach.
HIPPY (V.O.)
Gotcha, Cab Three.
Who is that?
That You,
Lindsey?
44
Lindsey executes a 180 degree turn and cruises over the control module, back
through the A-frame toward the docking hatch.
The flange of Cab Three's
lockout hatch settles over the pressure collar on the rig's back.
There is
a CLUNK as it mates up.
57
The platform is stopped, hovering in place.
Like a great spacecraft setting
down on a barren planet, the rig settles into the bottom ooze.
Flatbed
releases its tow lines and heads back to its berth inside.
CUT TO:
59
Three sets of moving lights move outward from Deepcore.
Cab One and Three,
with Lindsey and Hippy at the controls respectively, and One Night in the
Flatbed.
Lindsey is in the lead.
She approaches the cliff-like drop-off
and starts to descend.
LINDSEY
Com-check, everybody.
Flatbed, you on line?
ONE NIGHT
Ten-four, Lindsey, read you loud and clear.
LINDSEY
Cab Three?
HIPPY
Cab Three, check.
Right behind you.
LINDSEY (V.O.)
What's you depth, Cab Three?
HIPPY
1840... 50... 60... 70...
LINDSEY
Going over the wall.
Coming to bearing 065.
Everybody stay tight and in sight.
ONE NIGHT
Starting out descent.
Divers, how're you doing?
60
Eight divers ride the back of Flatbed like itinerant workers on the way to
the fields.
Bud and his civilian crew, Catfish, Finler, and Jammer... sit
across from the SEALs.
They are in their gear and breathing from umbilical
hooked in Flatbed's low-pressure manifold.
BUD
Okay so far.
JAMMER
How deep's the drop-off here?
CATFISH
This here's the bottomless pit, baby.
Two and
a half miles straight down.
COFFEY
Knock off the chatter.
Cab One, you getting
anything?
61
Lindsey consults her array of instruments.
COFFEY
Cab One, do you see it yet?
LINDSEY
The magnetometer is pegged.
Side-scan is showing
a big return, but I don't see anything yet.
Are
you sure you got the depth right on this?
BUD (V.O., filtered)
You should be almost to it, ace.
She turns the submersible and...
The spotlight flares back from the great brass screw of the Montana.
It
dwarfs Cab One, FILLING FRAME.
LINDSEY
Uh, yeah, roger that... uh, found it.
62
Cab One maneuvers along the flank of the enormous sub, while Flatbed and Cab
Three move above it.
Wilhite take readings with a hand-held neutron counter.
COFFEY
Cab One, radiation readings?
LINDSEY
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
COFFEY
Wilhite, anything?
WILHITE
Negative.
Nominal.
COFFEY
Just continue forward along the hull.
LINDSEY
Copy that, continuing forward.
You just want
me to get shots of everything, right?
COFFEY
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep
moving.
We're on a tight timeline.
LINDSEY
Copy that.
The great black hull of the Montana recedes into the darkness beyond the
puny beams of their lights.
It seems bigger than the Titanic and just as
eerie in its final resting place.
On it side, the sub's top deck becomes a
wall along which the tiny submersibles are moving.
Ahead, in the lights, is
a white painted circle.
COFFEY
That's the midship hatch.
You see it, Cab Three?
HIPPY
Roger, I see it.
BUD
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
HIPPY
Check.
Then I just hang with these guys, right?
COFFEY
Right.
ONE NIGHT
How do you want me?
COFFEY
Just hold above it.
Alright, A team.
Wilhite, Schoenick, and Monk unhook their short whip-umbilicals from the
central manifold and roll off the side of Flatbed.
They maneuver down toward
the sub's hatch.
Hippy guides Cab Three in closer to the hatch area.
64
The three SEALs have unlatched the deck cover and revealed the hatch.
They
open the out hatch and Monk swims down into to narrow escape trunk.
He bangs
on the inner hatch with a wrench, listening carefully with his helmet pressed
against it.
MONK
It's flooded.
Alright, I'm opening her up.
Straining hard in the confined space, he get the lower hatch open, then swims
backs out immediately.
He gestures to Hippy, via Little Geek's vision, and
Hippy flies the ROV into the hatch.
65
Meanwhile Cab One and Flatbed have proceeded forward along the hull.
Beyond
Lindsey's front port, the great hatches of the Trident missile tubes roll
toward us in procession.
Several of the hatch covers have been forced
partway open by the warping of the hull.
COFFEY (V.O.)
Radiation is nominal.
The warheads must still
be intact.
LINDSEY
How many are there?
COFFEY (V.O.)
24 Trident missiles.
Eight MIRVs per missile.
LINDSEY
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are
they?
SCHOENICK
Your MIRV is a tactical nuke, 50 kilotons
nominal yield.
Say times time Hiroshima.
LINDSEY (V.O.)
Jesus Christ... this is World War Three in a
can.
COFFEY (V.O.)
Let's knock off the chatter, please.
67
Monk moves into the opening.
MONK
Alright.
Let's get in there.
Wilhite and Schoenick follow him through the escape trunk, into the dark
corridor beyond.
68
Out of the darkness ahead emerges the trailing edge of the sail, big as a
five-story building.
Far below her, Flatbed moves along the edge of the
ledge which supports the vast sub.
Its lights, and Lindsey's strobes, reveal
the tremendous damage to the forward section as they pass the sail.
The torn
and twisted hull looms above Flatbed as it sets down.
Coffey indicated an enormous rent where the bow section is almost torn away
from the rest of the hull.
COFFEY
We'll go in through that large breach.
BUD
Let's go, guys.
Bud's team leaves Flatbed, swimming forward.
The opening is a black mouth in
their lights.
Coffey moves inside.
Bud attaches one end of an orange nylon
line to a piece of pipe and moves into the wreck behind him.
BUD
Take it slow, stay on the line, and stay in
sight.
Watch for hatches that could close on
you, or any loose equipment that could fall.
Jammer, Catfish, Finler, and Sonny follow him inside.
73
Lindsey circles the hull, documenting, photographing.
Her strobes sear the
darkness, give glimpses of the dead leviathan's form as her tiny submersible
circles it like a bee.
79
Lindsey is approaching the monolith of the sail, maneuvering to clear the
horizontal diving plane.
Then her lights go dim and her thrusters loose
power.
Suddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail and SOMETHING
appears right in front of her, a glowing object moving like a bat out of
hell right at her!
It is slightly smaller than submersible and we only get
a glimpse.
What we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent ovoid,
open at the front with a spinning vortex of light inside... like some
hallucinatory jet engine.
And it's hauling ass.
Lindsey jinks left.
The object jogs right.
She fights the control as her
sub slews around, slamming broadside into the sail.
K-BAM!
Her power comes
back up.
Righting Can One, she spins to look through the aft viewport in
time to see the object racing away in a broad arc.
It pulls a high-G turn
and dives straight down.
We see the object zip behind Flatbed.
One Night can't see it.
The thing
spirals down into the darkness like a hit-and-run drunk, diving along the
wall into the abyss until it is lost to view.
HOLD ON Lindsey excited, amazed... dazed.
Her hands are shaking.
Suddenly
Bud's voice blares out over the open frequency.
BUD (V.O.)
CAB ONE!
CAB ONE!
Meet me at Flatbed!
This
is a diver emergency!!
Do you copy?
Lindsey?!
She has a hard time focusing on what he's saying.
Finally...
LINDSEY
Copy you, Bud.
On my way.
CUT TO:
86
The sky is charcoal, the sea is a mountain range of gray slopes.
Waves
thunder over the foredeck, whipped by eighty-know winds.
Men in life
jackets scurry like insects.
Off the port bow, the ASW destroyer ALBANY
vanishes and reappears among waves sixty feet tall.
McBride scream orders
that can't be heard to the crewmen on deck.
He staggers back along the bridge
railing.
87
McBride steps into the quiet of the control room.
He turns on De Marco.
MCBRIDE
We're trying to get unhooked and get out of
here... and your boys go sightseeing!
DEMARCO
They'll be back in two hours.
MCBRIDE
Two hours?!
We're gonna be getting the shit
kicked out of us by our friend Fred in two hours!
De Marco's expression is infuriatingly calm... icy.
McBride looks at his
watch and swears under his breath.
CUT TO:
88
For a second time the black hull of the ballistic missile sub is illuminated
by diver's lights.
Tiny figures, the divers move like moths around a distant
streetlight.
Wilhite, Monk and Schoenick are clustered around an open missile
hatch.
Using a large lift bag, they are removing the frangible fiberglass,
or 'diaphragm'.
Coffey pilots Flatbed with increasing deftness, deploying
the big arm to aid in the work.
DOWN ANGLE as the diaphragm lifts away... revealing the blunt nose of the
TRIDENT C-4 MISSLE.
Like looking down the barrel of a gun at the bullet
aimed right at you.
CUT TO:
90
The divers are working head-first in the missile's launch tube.
Monk reads
from a plasticized card, directing the other two step by step.
The arcane
litany is punctuated by the hissing rasp of their breathing.
WILHITE (filtered)
Separation sequencer disconnected.
Next?
MONK (filtered)
Remove explosive bolts one through six in
counterclock-wise sequence.
SCHOENICK (filtered)
Check... removing bolt one.
92
It is now clear what the SEALs are doing.
Using large lift bags and Flatbed's
big arm, they have pulled one of the Trident C-4 missiles partway out of its
launch tube, and have partially disassembled the nose-shroud, exposing
several of the MIRV warheads within.
Moving very carefully, Wilhite and Schoenick ease one of the individual MIRVs
out of its bracket.
Hanging under a lift-bag in a jerry-rigged harness, the
three-foot long warhead is move gently by the divers to the back of Flatbed.
95
The big A-frame, massive as a railroad bridge, to which the umbilical from
the Explorer is attached.
Flatbed rises INTO FRAME arcing around the
coupling mechanism F.G.
One Night deploys the big hydraulic arm.
It unfold from Flay bed like a huge steel spider leg, its claw-like 'gripper'
opening.
96
An ALARM sounds stridently on the dynamic-positioning console.
BENDIX
We're losing number two thruster.
Bearing's
going.
99
As the ship slews, the umbilical is drawn off vertical.
It goes tight as a
bowstring.
Pulled to the edge of the launch well, it rips down the side
with a godawful screech, tearing loose ladders and floats.
100
Flatbed's manipulator has gripped the de-coupling mechanism when the cable
suddenly pulls taut.
The sub is jerked sideways, its grip dislodged.
We
see One Night get tossed around inside.
102
The rig begins to move. The enormous skid breaks loose.
Start to slide,
plowing furrows in the bottom.
One Night junks the controls, pivoting her
submersible as the A-frame looms toward her.
104
The winch man staggers along the railing, blasted by 80-knot winds.
He
sprints for the base of the enormous crane which supports the umbilical
winch.
A wave blasts him into the bulkhead.
He half-crawls to the ladder
going up to the winch-house.
As he climbs the winch's heave-compensator
slides up and down, FILLING FRAME behind him.
It is bottoming-out with a sound like a piledriver, overloaded by the strain
on the cable.
It chooses that moment to fail.
GRINDING CRASH OF METAL.
105
Lindsey has joined Bud, looking out the front viewport.
LINDSEY
We're heading right for the drop off!
106
The deck is ripped upward as the entire 40-ton crane is pulled over by the
weight of Deepcore.
It topples in the launch well with a roar of tortured
steel that rivals the storm.
An EXPLOSION OF WATER.
UNDERWATER, the crane
tumbles between the twin hulls.
Trailing a vortex of foam and debris, it
roars down on us, FILLING FRAME WITH BLACKNESS.
109
The umbilical drops down in slack loops out of the blackness above, draping
itself over the habitat in large coils.
One Night pilots her submersible
feverishly among the falling loops.
She banks and twists.
A length of heavy
umbilical slams onto her neck, tipping the sub.
She manages to get out from under it a keep going.
111
The rig begins to slide.
It tilts over the embankment and grinds down the
slope of the drop-off in a cloud of silt.
The cable pulling it inexorably
toward the cliff.
The framework twists and slams into rocks.
SCREECHING
AND GROANING of tortured steel.
115
The rig is sliding to the edge of the cliff.
Beyond it... the bottomless
pit of the Cayman Trough.
It slams, crushing and twisting, into a rock
outcropping and stops, hanging over the precipice.
A118
LOOKING DOWN THE WALL of the canyon as Big Geek moves beneath us, tilting up
to show Deepcore perched at the very edge of the abyss.
The rig is twisted
and dented, covered with loops of umbilical, trimodule-A a mass of wreckage.
The ROV passes across the front of the control module.
Through the front
port, two figures can be seen in the light of a single emergency lamp.
SONNY (V.O. static)
Mayday, mayday.
This is Deepcore Two calling
Benthic Explorer.
Do you read, over?
124
Catfish and Lindsey, in suits and helmets, drop down from the glare of the
moonpool onto the dark sea floor under the rig.
Walking, they pull their
umbilicals behind them and head out through the twisted wreckage.
Little
Geek follows along like a dog at their heels.
They settle beside a valve
assembly at the base of the wrecked module.
LINDSEY
Cat, you tie onto this manifold.
There's some
tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check
them out.
CATFISH
You watch yourself.
He begins to attach one end of a coiled-up high-pressure hose to a manifold.
She takes the other end of the hose and moves off into the darkness.
Little
Geek goes with her faithfully.
127
Catfish is working on one side of the wrecked module while Lindsey is on the
other, out of sight.
She is standing on the bottom at the base of the
wreckage, checking valves on a rack of oxygen bottles amongst the wreckage.
Right at the edge of the canyon wall.
Behind her is a sheer drop to
nothingness
LINDSEY
Yeah, Hippy, I read you.
What's the matter?
The reply is GARBLED by a wash of static.
Then, for no apparent reason,
Lindsey's helmet light begins to dim out.
Little Geek's lights fade.
His
motors whine to a stop.
ON CATFISH, as his lights drop to candleglows.
128
ON LINDSEY, as she fiddles with her lights and transceiver pack.
LINDSEY
Catfish... I got a problem here.
You there?
Catfish?
Behind her, SOMETHING rises from the depths.
It is the little vehicle she almost collided with at the Montana wreck.
It comes right up behind her.
She doesn't know it's there.
It hovers
sideways like a hummingbird, as if curious, trying to get a better look.
She
becomes aware of the pulsing glow on the ground around her.
She turns
slowly.
We see her react as the glowing, pulsing apparition is reflected in
her faceplate.
A more powerful glow washes up onto her from below.
Her eyes go down.
She gasps, absolutely stunned...
Above the edge of the wall, AN ENORMOUS SHAPE RISES SILENTLY OUT OF THE
DEPTHS.
Over sixty feet across.
It looks like a blown glass manta ray, its
transparent outer hull housing interior structures of great delicacy and
complexity, pulsing with a blue-violet glow.
Lindsey stand before it, unable to move.
Absolutely rapt.
Captivated by its ethereal beauty.
It begins to turn, majestically, one
rounded wing passing only a few feet above her.
She reaches up.
Touches it
as it passes over her.
Lindsey is without fear, completely mesmerized.
The thing completes its turn and dives gracefully down along the wall.
She
is gently lifted by a backwash of turbulent water.
About that time, Lindsey remembers she has a still camera, a little Nikonos.
She fumbles to set focus and exposure with her bulky gloves as the beautiful
machine glides into the depths.
Gets all set for a shot and...
WOOSH!
The little 'scoutschip' whizzes past her from behind, startling her.
She completely misses the shot of the 'manta ship'.
She pivots, trying to
get a shot of the little one as it zig-zags down along the wall, fast as a
meteor.
CLICK.
She get a shot a second before it disappears.
From around the flank of the rig module, Catfish appears.
Their com-sets
come backs to life, along with their lights.
LINDSEY
You better not say you missed that.
CATFISH
Missed what?
CUT TO:
162
Bed shoots down through the hatch.
The cold hits him list a fist, becoming
instantly paralyzing.
He starts kicking in powerful strokes through the dark
water, maneuvering around tangles of umbilical cable twisted tubular steel.
Catfish is behind him, swimming like hell.
They reach hatch six.
Together
they spin the wheel and heave upward, opening it.
164
Bud is stroking rapidly through the tangle of pipes and conduit.
He sees the
lit rectangle of the moonpool far ahead.
175
Beneath the habitat, Coffey is maneuvering Flatbed through the twisted pipe
and debris left by Deepcore's slide to the edge.
Bloodied, his fatigues
ripped half-off, he looks like a feral animal.
His eyes burn with the
determination of his mission.
177
Coffey passes under the twisted wreckage of the big automated derrick and makes
a tight turn beneath the drill-floor module.
Flatbed scrapes through between
twisted conduit, metal screeching on metal.
179
Bud rockets DOWN INTO FRAME in a column of bubbles.
He looks around.
Through
the lattice of conduit under the rig he can see Flatbed moving forward from
its exit point under the stern.
Bud see a shortcut under the platform.
He kicks along a lattice a pipes, heaving himself along in frantic hand-over-
hand stokes.
He reaches for Flatbed's stern as it passes.
Misses the last hand-hold... but just manages to seize a tie-down trailing
behind it.
He is jerked along behind the sub.
Bud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake of the powerful
thrusters.
Flatbed gathers speed, moving out toward the edge of the abyssal
wall.
The current slams him, spinning him like a fishing lure.
He pulls
himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of Flatbed's platform.
LOW ANGLE, look up the wall.
Flatbed appears over the edge and stops.
Hovering.
ON THE BACK OF FLATBED.
Bud has the break he needs.
He scrambles up onto the
deck and opens and equipment locker.
Nothing in it but one of the yellow
nylon safety lines.
The big arm begins to unfold, lifting Geek/ROV.
180
Coffey works intently.
His eyes are the cool ice of lethal madness in a
face streaked with blood.
He brings the ROV into view with the boom arm.
GEEK/ROV had a passenger.
Brigman.
The diver is holding Geek's skid with
one hand, doing something with the other.
He turns to look at Coffey.
181
Coffey releases the ROV with the gripper and makes a grab at Bud with the
steel claw.
Bud dives.
The gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow.
Bud
kicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out.
We see he has managed to tie
one end to Geek's skids.
Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV, sending
an acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder.
The little robot, pregnant with its
load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void.
Coffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud.
Bud strokes rapidly to a large
jumble of wreckage.
He loops the rope around a twisted pipe.
Big Geek is
hauling ass away from him.
The line snap taut an instant later.
The ROV
strains, like a Rottweiler on a leash... trying to go.
The rope is slipping
as Bud fights to make a knot.
Flatbed slews around, thrusters whining.
As it banks, it hurls up clouds of
sediment from the escarpment face.
Through the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls.
The big arm extends menacingly.
The smaller from manipulators open.
An
enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring.
The big machine roars forward.
Straight at Bud.
Bud gets his knot partly done.
See Flatbed looming.
Glare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as
Coffey closes the last few feet.
One manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside
rakes across his legs as it passes over.
Flatbed crushes into the tangle of
pipework.
K-CRUUUNCH!!
183
Bud swims clear, diving down at an angle along the wall, hoping to stay in
Coffey's blind area.
Flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris.
It pivots toward Bud.
Moves after him.
Nearby, the ROV is whining mindlessly, trying to please.
Trying to GO.
DETAIL OF ROPE attached to wreckage, as Bud's knot begins to slip.
The nylon
line starts to play through the knot slowly.
BUD has gotten himself into a bad position.
Along the bare rock face of the
cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a
truck.
Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward.
Flatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic.
There's no cover, side to
side, up or down.
Coffey has him head in his lights.
Suddenly a bright glare blasts in,
blinding Coffey.
He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full
throttle.
At the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible
slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab.
Coffey is
smashed sideways by the shock.
He fights to control his vehicle.
Lindsey
looks up to see Coffey's sub gun it up over the wall, out of sight.
She
cruises up over Bud.
LINDSEY (V.O.)
Get in!
Bud gets the lockout hatch open and clambers up into Cab One's belly.
184
Bud flops over the lip of the hatch and slams it shut.
He ditches his helmet.
Lindsey raises her vehicle warily above the wall.
Through the front port
there is not sign of Coffey.
LINDSEY
You owe me one, Virgil.
BUD
Can we negotiate later?
There's Big Geek.
He points.
Through the front port, they can see the ROV still straining at
its leash.
Lindsey dives toward it, simultaneously working the controls to
open her own small manipulator claws.
185
The last few feet of the rope slip through the knot.
Big Geek happily surges forward.
It dives gracefully down into the void,
trailing the yellow rope like a kite tail.
ONE CAB ONE, Bud and Lindsey through the front port.
BUD
Go after it!
We gotta catch it!
FLATBED DROPS INTO FRAME BEHIND THEM, dwarfing little Cab One.
They are
slammed viciously as Coffey's submersible hammers into them.
She hits full
throttle.
Coffey floors it after Lindsey, ramming her from behind with his
more powerful vehicle.
With difficulty Lindsey maintains trim.
She arcs back toward the rig.
Flatbed slams her again, for the side.
She
fights for control.
186
Bud is tossed around, ricocheting off the walls.
Lindsey flies with her
jaw set.
Fighting hard for control.
The A-frame of the rig looms before her.
She shoots through at full throttle.
187
Now the fight is really on.
The two subs are dodging between the cylindrical
modules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure
hulls.
Coffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways.
It screeches along
the flank of one of the trimodules.
They head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run.
Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing
up the bottom with its powerful backwash.
Lindsey carves hard around a rock
pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon.
Coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side.
Lindsey snarls.
He's pissing her off.
He shouldn't do that.
Ahead, out of the blackness, another outcropping.
Lindsey rises, cuts right.
Smashes down into Coffey's craft.
Timing it just right.
He skids catch in
the rocks.
Flatbed slews violently, nosing down.
Crushing into the rocky bottom.
Pressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind.
It smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control.
Tangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the
wall.
With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds
her crippled sub.
Flatbed tumbles over the edge.
ANGLE DOWN THE WALL as it falls, trailing a cloud of sediment like a comet's
tail, down into the unfathomable blackness below.
189
Flatbed looks like a toy, tumbling away down the wall.
Soon its lights vanish.
192
Bud swims with long, powerful kicks, towing Lindsey.
Her arms and legs float
as gracefully as seaweed waving in a gentle current.
Bud's voice comes in
short rasps, breathing hard, but icy with control.
BUD
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen...
de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc
syringe... and some... heating blankets.
You got all that?
HIPPY (V.O.)
Got it. Over.
BUD
Meet me in the moonpool.
Move fast.
194
Bud moves up toward the rectangle of light, towing Lindsey to the diving
platform.
Through the surface we can see the others arrive at the edge,
looking down.
198
FROM FAR BELOW, Deepcore is a faint tiara of lights, above in the blackness.
A single moving light appears above, at the edge of the cliff, and starts
down.
It grows large, resolving into Bud, free-falling down the wall.
He gathers speed as Little Geek's vertical thruster drives them down.
Bud looks down.
Between his feet he can see a short way down the wall in the
glow of his single light, and beyond that an unfathomable blackness.
The wall
unrolls upwards out of the darkness like a convoluted gray drapery.
He looks
up.
The lights of Deepcore are gone.
He feels
more alone than he has ever
felt.
He types out:
CANT SEE YOU
LINDSEY (V.O.)
We're right here with you, Bud.
Your depth is
3800 feet.
You're doing fine.
Bud comes upon the twisted wreckage of the crane, hanging against the wall
like a forty-ton yo-yo at the end of the umbilical.
200
WIDE SHOT.
Bud is a tiny spider dropping down the wall in a pathetic little
pool of light.
The wall is sterile brown-gray, devoid of life at this depth.
LOOKING DOWN, as the light shrinks to a star and vanishes in the blackness
yawning below.
202
Bud is visibly trembling, gritting his teeth... holding on as the vise-grip
of pressure takes him.
LINDSEY (V.O./filtered)
It's pitiful.
I have to wait until you're
freezing in the dark and there's ten thousand
feet of water between us.
I guess I'm babbling.
I'm sorry.
Bud struggles with his keyboard.
204
BLAM!
Bud jerks as his dive light implodes.
He still has Geek's floodlights.
He falls on.
206
Bud is in an enormous school of bioluminescent squid, graceful, attenuated
creatures less than a foot long.
Thousands of then glide in ghostly arcs
around him, filling the black void as far as the eye can see.
He stares at
them in wonder.
Reaches out and touches one, catches it, lets it go.
Are
they really here?
He can no longer be sure of his own perceptions.
208
Bud emerges from the school of squid.
As he falls, they form a luminous plane
of swirling colors above him.
He stares upwards, transfixed.
BUD'S POV, the
ghostly blizzard of luminescence above him.
A spectral form takes shape in
the patternless glow... resolving into Lindsey's face, a hundred feet wide.
Gazing down at him, her expression sad.
Her image receded away from him into
the darkness above as he falls.
DOWN ANGLE ON BUD, reaching up in anguish.
210
Bud is shaking violently, as if with palsy.
His eyes keep rolling back, and
he's having a hard time staying conscious.
He tries to type a message and he
can't.
The tons of pressure per square inch are short-circuiting his nervous
system.
Suddenly K-BAM!
Little Geek's pressure hull implodes.
Its lights
go out.
BLACKNESS.
212
Blackness.
Then a bright light appears... he's lit a MAGNESIUM FLARE.
It's fierce, flickering glare lights his plunge.
Bud discards the stalwart
little ROV and free-falls like a skydiver without a chute.
Out of control, he
hits a ledge and rolls off.
Tumbles forward in a cloud of debris.
He hits
another outcropping, limp as a rag doll.
Rocks and sand rain down with him
as he continues his descent.
Bud us quivering, teeth locked in a titanic rigor.
He pulls his arms and legs slowly into a fetal position.
In the plunge toward death he has gone he has gone full circle, returned to
the womb in which we all breathe the water of life before we know the world of
air and light.
Still, there is Lindsey's voice, faintly in his helmet.
LINDSEY (V.O.)
You remember that time, you were pretty drunk,
you probably don't remember... the power went
out at the old apartment, the one on Orange
Street... and we were staring at that one little
candle, and I said something really dumb like
that candle is me, like every one of us is out
there alone in the dark in this life...
214
A tiny flickering light moves down along a vast black wall.
Bud falls on in
dream-like solitude, a candle in the dark.
216
Bud is no longer in pain.
His expression is rapt.
LOOKING DOWN, past his to a ghostly landscape.
His last flare sputters out,
but there is light.
Bioluminescent algae carpet the walls of the canyon
below him.
And he's right... it is beautiful.
The water is so clear we can see down 500 feet past Bud's tiny, silhouetted
figure, to a vast landscape faintly revealed in spectral pastels.
Barren as
the moon but exquisite, serene.
Changeless.
A place unseen by human eyes.
Like a firefly below, the lights of Big Geek are visible.
Bud descends toward
the ROV, which has grounded on a narrow shelf.
Below the shelf, the wall
slopes out, suggesting we are near the bottom of the canyon but can't see it.
ONE BIG GEEK/MIRV, sitting there like a dumbshit.
Bud's feet thump into the
sediment next to it, stirring it luminous particles.
Touchdown... three and
half miles of water over his head.
Bud leans over the warhead in a swarm of
fireflies.
218
Bud is peering into the detonator unit.
How bad is he?
We can't tell.
MONK (V.O.)
It's the blue wire with the white stripe, not...
I repeat... NOT the black wire with the yellow
stripe.
Bud is staring.
Blinking.
The two wire look big as sewer pipes, and they're
miles away... way down there where his hands are.
The only light he has left is a CYALUME STICK.
He pulls out the little
plastic tube.
Breaks and shakes.
It starts to glow, a tiny wand of green
light.
He fumbles with his tool pouch, takes out a pair of side-cutters.
CUTING NNOW he types to them.
He reaches into the detonator.
DETAIL, THE WIRES... in the green Cyalume glow, the look identical.
The
cutters go over on wire.
A long beat.
They withdraw, then go over the other
wire...
He cuts--
220
Bud is one his knees beside the dead warhead.
His expression is enigmatic.
He looks around slowly at the luminous canyon.
Starts to type.
222
A tiny figure lies slumped beside the inert ROV, an Indian dying with his
horse in the desert.
Bud's eyelids close.
His chest barely moving.
A strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open.
He blinks.
Weakly,
he raises his head, facing the source of the radiance.
BUD'S POV... A glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision.
It seems to
be an angel.
Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an
extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish.
Its body
and limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass.
A
delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates
gently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer.
The
head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a
cold, dispassionate wisdom.
It is stunningly beautiful.
The creature settles toward him.
Unafraid, Bud extends his hand.
Its slender, blown-glass digits grasp his bulky glove.
It pulls him up from
the benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope, deeper into the
abyss.
At the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below.
They
resolve into NTI ships.
Tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that Lindsey
nearly collided with at the Montana wreck.
The larger manta-ships.
And
others, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish.
Suddenly the darkness explodes with light.
A vast, reticulated pattern of
brightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below
them, covering the floor of the abyssal trench.
It sweeps outward from the
center, as if the light were surging through channels.
The NTIs are revealing
their home to Bud.
The ships move among the spires like air traffic over a
major city.
223
Bud and the creature descend until, between the lines of light, we see a dark
surface of inhuman design.
The shape extends beyond the limits of visibility.
Towers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface.
It
dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it, approaching an opening that soon
yawns like a vast mouth.
They are picking up speed, swept along by a powerful current, into the mouth-
like opening.
226
A video news crew leaps from a Jet Ranger helicopter in a parking area and
runs to set up near the railing, facing the ocean.
Pandemonium reigns around
them, people running, driving, evacuating inland.
On the horizon, out to sea, a dark line has appeared.
It grows in height as it comes closer, a wall of water stretching across the
horizon, already hundreds of feet high and growing.
227
LONG LENSE SHOT, looking seaward past the Statue of Liberty, out past the
Verazzano Narrows.
Stacked up by perspective, the distant wave is a wall of
water impossibly high, still miles out.
228
The scene repeats on the eastern coast of the Kamchatka Penninsula in Russia,
where a full moon shimmers along the crest of a vast wave.
SIRENS wail as Russian sailors run from the docks of Petropavlovsk Naval Base.
Some stand rooted as the black glacier of water, a thousand feet high and
growing, thunders toward them in nightmarish slow motion.
229
The minicam crew reporter is speaking rapidly, faltering with emotion, his
voice cracking like the famous broadcast from the scene of the Hindenburg
disaster.
REPORTER
The horizon has gone dark... the crowd is starting
to run... some are just staring, unable to
move... the wave... the wave is... it's...
I don't know... maybe a thousand feet high
already... getting bigger as I'm watching...
still miles out... oh my God, Jesus... I can
hear it...
A roar fills the air, a thunder which drowns out the people's screams, even
the rotors of the news chopper as the camera teams scrambles aboard.
They
leave the announcer standing transfixed, his face blank, eyes tracking upward
and upward as the ground begins to shake.
230
The Statue of Liberty looks like a souvenir figurine at the afternoon sun is
blocked out by the cresting tsunami, an escarpment of water 2500 feet tall.
231
LONG LENS SHOT -- The Golden Gate Bridge and the hills of the city, the
buildings downtown.
Beyond, FILLING FRAME is the wall of sea green which
defies our comprehension.
The image shakes with the THUNDER.
232
A diehard surfer looks over his shoulder as the mountain of water which
transcends his worst nightmare.
He lies paralyzed on his board.
233
Downtown Miami crouches in terror at the feet of the shimmering monolith.
In a penthouse office suite, an executive watches the wave towering above him,
blocking out the sun, a line of raging foam appearing as it arches over,
about to break upon the teeming city.
And then...
The wave slows as it crests...
And stops.
IT SIMPLY STOPS.
2600 feet high and motionless except for a shimmering undulation of its
surface in the bright sun.
There is quiet, a faint wind and calling of
confused gulls.
Various reactions, as the thunder fades and people recover,
only to stand awed before the vast, inexplicable manifestation.
A news
helicopter passes in front of it like a dragonfly.
234
The surfer just blinks, starting.
235
On the East Coast it's the same, as the World Trade Centers are dwarfed by a
shimmering blue wall which stands... waiting.
236
Russian seamen, lining the harbor breakwall at Petropavlovsk Naval Base on the
Kamchatka Peninsula, stare upward at the monolith of water, undulating in the
moonlight.
It seems poised to crash down, inflicting inconceivable
devastation... but it doesn't.
237
When all have seen...
The wave soundlessly subsides, slowly slipping back and down until the surface
of the sea is normal again.
VIDEO SHOT, HANDHELD, of a crowd of people watching the sea.
Moving from
face to face.
Various reactions as people respond to what they can only
understand as a miracle.
The faces... awed, stunned, tear-streaked...
laughing.
The cameraman is just walking.
Some people turn to him and smile,
or laugh, or whoop.
A woman is collapsed on a bench, crying.
A man is on his knees, shaking.
Total strangers hug each other.
A black guy, tears pouring down his face, turns to the camera with a beautific
grin.
GUY
Somebody just laid it down to us, man.
Things
ain't never gonna be the same!
PULL BACK to reveal that we are in the...
242
Bendix and the bridge crew are going nuts.
All their instruments are pegged.
BENDIX
Active is pinging back something big... it's
enormous!
Coming up right under us.
DEMARCO
Where?
BENDIX
Where?
EVERYWHERE!!
(looks out the window)
Over there!
Port bow.
243
A depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred yards off, not
swirling down like a whirlpool, just dimpling down.
It gets wider.
Deeper.
Rapidly becomes a yawning pit.
The ocean is OPENING.
Now the surface is churned by turbulence.
Slow massive roils of tremendous
power boil up from the depths.
McBride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better.
The open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across.
The ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom.
SOMETHING RISES IN THE CENTER OF THE OPENING.
A massive spire.
Smoothly
curving and iridescent.
Off the starboard beam, a quarter mile away, another
spire rises.
Tons of seawater fall from its sides with a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the
energy of Niagara.
Off the port bow... another spire.
And another, beyond the destroyer Albany, dwarfing it.
Six towers... plus one larger, in the center.
Rising.
One the Explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out
the sun.
The air, the sea, the deck... all vibrate with the THUNDER OF
CREATION.
And now for the payoff shot:
WE'RE HIGH, LOOKING DOWN.
THE SPIRES FORM A
PERFECT RING A MILE ACROSS.
A VAST DARK FORM, LIKE A GREAT SHADOW, RISES FROM
THE DEPTHS BENEATH THE SHIPS.
THE SPIRES ARE CONNECTED.
IT IS ALL ONE.
THE NTI ARK.
It surfaces with slow majesty, gently beaching all the ships on its broad
back.
We recognize it as the structure into which Bud was led by the angelic
being, which we assumed was a city.
The Explorer rocks gently on its flat
hull, clunking massively to one side as it settles.
The bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of
the vast, slightly curved hull.
The missile cruiser rocks back and forth
nearby, high and dry... its prop whining futility.
ON EXPLORER'S DECK, McBride, Bendix, DeMarco, the rest of the Navy
contingent... they're all standing there open-mouthed, in a dream-like daze.
Touched by the hand of God.
BENDIX
Look...
WHAT THEY SEE -- Fifty yards away, between them and the Albany, sits Deepcore
Two.
It looks like a particularly ugly and unwanted toy, sitting on the
glistening plain of the NTI Ark's hull.
CLOSER, ON TRIMODULE C, as the hatch at the bottom opens.
Catfish's feet appear, bicycling.
He swings down to the pearlescent 'deck'.
Stands there blinking in the sunlight, mole-like.
Jammer plonks down behind
him.
He turns, lifts Lindsey down.
Hippy, Sonny, and the rest, emerge into
the light of the sun.
A deliverance from the blackest night they will ever
know.
LINDSEY
We should be dead.
We didn't decompress.
CATFISH
Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook-
up Coke.
HIPPY
They must've done something to us.
Lindsey has tears streaming down her cheeks... for the sun, for life, for
their deliverance and the larger one she knows has happened, an epiphany for
the whole human race.
LINDSEY
Oh, yes.
I think you could say that.
She blinks.
Seeing something not far away.
She gives a little laugh, or
something between laughing and crying.
REVERSE, as Bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouth-like
enterances to the NTI structure.
His suit is casually unzipped and the FBS
helmet dangles from one hand jauntily.
She starts toward him.
Breaks into a run.
Then stops a few feet from him.
Watching him come to her.
His smile, his eyes illuminating her.
He stops and she touches him, lightly.
Is this real?
The look at each other, wonderingly a moment.
Then laugh.
She sniffs loudly.
LINDSEY
Hello, Brigman.
BUD
Hello, Mrs. Brigman.
Their lips meet.
