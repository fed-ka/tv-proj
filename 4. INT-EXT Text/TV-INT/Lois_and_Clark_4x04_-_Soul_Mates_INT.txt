                                    LOIS
                   Hello, Husband.  I still can't
                   believe it -- we're really actually
                   married!  It feels like a dream.
                        (floating anxiety)
                   It's not, right?  I mean, I know
                   that's silly, but on the other
                   hand, given our history together...

                                    SUPERMAN
                        (kisses her)
                   That feel like a dream?

                                    LOIS
                   Come true.

                                    LOIS
                   Ready... Wait, I'm missing a bag.
                   I must've left it at home.
                        (makes flying motion)
                   Do you mind?

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Something tells me we won't be
                   needing a lot of clothes on our
                   honeymoon, Lois.

                   Yeah, but you told me about it when 
                   we ran into Tempus the second time.

    Wells reveals a Walkman-sized, titanium encased Device,

                   to a time quite unlike anything I'd

                   fellow inventor who discovered a                  (X)

                   cosmic fingerprint, if you will.
                   No two exactly alike.  This Device
                   was created as a means to track
                   that energy.  Or, to be more
                   precise, _back_track it.

                   love over and over again throughout
                   Time.  Truly a mythic bond.

                   why stuff _does_ keep happening to

                   Never actually tried this before.

    He enters data into the Device, causing the liquid crystal 
    center to GLOW WHITE.  That GLOW ARCS directly into Lois's 
    and Clark's chests and then, in what best can be described 
    as a GHOST-LIKE INNER LIGHT separates from their respective 
    bodies and the BACKGROUND VORTEXES LIKE A TIME TUNNEL.

                                                     CUT TO:


    filled with things magical and mystical. Tempos enters to        (X)
    find a ancient, white haired SORCERER toiling over a boiling
    cauldron.  The Sorcerer drops a mandrake root into the
    cauldron and the mist FLARES.  An inquisitive large, brown
    RAT watches from a nearby cage.

                                    SORCERER
                        (reading mist)
                   Uneasy is the dragon's breath
                   to-day.  Something is amiss...

    The Rat SQUEAKS.  The Sorcerer glares at it:

                                    SORCERER (CONT'D)
                   If I want your opinion, I'll ask
                   for it.

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                   Really, Sorcerer, you must stop
                   talking to rodents.  It completely
                   undermines your credibility.

                                    SORCERER
                   Baron, I fear a strange magic, a
                   force unlike any other has entered
                   our sphere.

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                   Never mind that, I've got more
                   pressing concerns.  The Fox has
                   stolen Lady Loisette from me, and I
                   simply can't have that.  I hate it
                   when the hero gets the heroine,
                   it's so cliche.

                                    SORCERER
                   Why do you want to force her to
                   marry you anyway?  Simply to rule

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                   Why, sure, power's _fun_.  But the 
                   added bonus is it'd destroy The Fox 
                   because she's his girl.  That's why 
                   I want you to make her love me.

                                    SORCERER
                   Would that I could, Sire.
                   Unfortunately, spells can enchant
                   and they can damn, but they can                   (X)
                   never force the ways of a heart.

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                   You're sure about that?  You've 
                   checked with all the other 
                   sorcerers?

                                    SORCERER
                   Positive.

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                   Very well, I'll try a more 
                   conventional approach first.  But, 
                   if that fails, I want you to 
                   prepare your most diabolical 
                   curse -- and doom their love for 
                   all time.

    Tempos tosses a root into the cauldron causing it to FLARE 
    and HISS.  The rat SCREECHES wildly.

                                    SORCERER
                   Gladly.

    Then, SQUIRE JEREMY, _Jimmy Olson's incarnation_, enters and 
    bows his head:

                                    SQUIRE JEREMY
                   My liege.

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                        (condescending)
                   Who are you?

                                    SQUIRE JEREMY
                   I am Jeremy, loyal squire to Sir 
                   Charles.  I'm afraid Sir Charles is 
                   away on patrol.

                                    BARON TEMPOS
                   Ironic, isn't it?  Every time Sir
                   Charles is away, The Fox shows up.
                   I wonder, is it possible... ?

    Squire Jeremy holds a tray of cheese for the Sorcerer, who
    takes a piece and dangles it just out of the rat's reach.

                                    SORCERER
                   Come, come, now, you can beg better

                   I'll tell him you're here.

    Jeremy exits.  Clark drifts over to the Sorcerer, who's
    still teasing the rat with the cheese.  The rat SQUEAKS.

                   wrong with The Device.  It's from

                   History's held in delicate balance,
                   with infinite consequences to even
                   the most remote or seemingly
                   insignificant change.  It's quite
                   possible that in allowing Baron
                   Tempos to defeat The Fox, we
                   unwittingly allowed Evil to defeat
                   Good in a place and time it had not
                   done so before.  That, over Time,
                   may very well have shifted the
                   balance of power in favor of Evil.

    Jimmy.

                                    CLARK
                   Something tells me you oughta ask
                   her out, Jimmy.

                                    JIMMY
                   Really?  You think she'd say yes?

                                    CLARK
                   Trust me.

    Clark gives him a 'go for it look,' then shoves him off in 
    her direction.

                                    WELLS
                   Well, the curse is broken, Good and
                   Evil are back in balance, and love,
                   as it's wont to do, has conquered                 (X)
                   all.

    He moves closer.

                                    WELLS (CONT'D)
                   Destiny has been kind to you.  It 
                   has blessed you both with each 
                   other, no small gift indeed.  There 
                   are a great many people who travel 
                   alone through their whole lives and 
                   envy what you two have.
                        (personalizing this)
                   Greatly...
                        (as if preparing them)
                   Try to remember that the next time
                   the gods decide to test you.
                        (into elevator)
                   By the way, congratulations on your
                   marriage.

    As the elevator doors begin to close, he flips open his
    pocket watch and checks the time.  After a moment, Clark
    swoops Lois up in his arms, looks deeply into her eyes.

                                    CLARK
                   Now, where were we?

                                                     CUT TO:



    Where we began with Superman flying Lois into the room and
    onto the bed.  He lays her down, kisses her.  When they
    part:

                                    LOIS
                   Hello, husband...

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Hello, wife...

                                    LOIS
                   Now, that's what I call getting
                   carried over the threshold

                                    SUPERMAN
                   You ain't seen nothing yet.

    He kisses her, then she plops her head back on the pillow.

                                    LOIS
                        (exhales)
                   Wow, I'm beat.

                                    SUPERMAN
                        (stops him)
                   You're kidding.  Please tell me
                   you're kidding.

    She coyly crawls out of be and finds the red teddy in her
    suitcase.

                                    LOIS
                   Don't touch that dial...

    She disappears into the bathroom.  As Superman climbs out of
    bed, pulls the covers back, and dims the lights:

                                    SUPERMAN
                   You know, I know this is our first
                   time, and, well, I want everything
                   to be just right...

    As he pours the champagne, he lights the candles with LASER
    VISION.

                                    SUPERMAN (CONT'D)
                   ... But, I just want you to know
                   that, if your heart was set on
                   Hawaii, I'd --

    He catches himself as he spots her standing in the doorway,
    wearing the sexy teddy as well as it can possibly be worn.

                                    LOIS
                   You were saying... ?

    He SUPERSPINS into Clark, wearing only boxers and an open        (X)
    shirt, but still holding the champagne flutes.                   (X)

                                    CLARK
                   Didn't spill a drop.

    He crosses to her side of the bed, offers her a glass. She
    puts it down without taking a sip, then puts his down too.
    Lois wraps her arms around his neck, pulling him close.

                                    LOIS
                   I don't want anything clouding this
                   moment.

                                    CLARK
                   A moment we're destined for.

                                    LOIS
                   That's what makes it so special.  I
                   love you, Clark Kent.

                                    CLARK
                   I love you, Lois --
                        (catches himself)
                   Lane.

    They fall into a kiss, this time with growing hunger.
    They're in no hurry as this moment is played out for all its
    worth.  Then, Clark gently leads her under the sheets.  Just
    as they start to get hot and heavy -- the phone RINGS.
    Clark looks over at it.

                                    LOIS
                   Don't even _think_ about it!

    As the phone RINGS again, she pulls him back into the kiss.
    He reaches over, fumbles for the phone line, and YANKS it
    out of the socket, pulling out a chunk of wall with it.  As
    their passion takes them, they lose themselves in the
    lovemaking and don't even notice that they're FLOATING under
    the top sheet, two feet above the mattress.  CAMERA PANS
    AWAY to honor their privacy and PUSHES OUT THE WINDOW TO:
