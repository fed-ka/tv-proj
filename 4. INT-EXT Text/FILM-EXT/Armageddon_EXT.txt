Clark Atlantis, what's the problem?
Shelby

It just isn't working. Any suggestions?
Clarke Hang on Pete. We'll figure something out for you.
Golden taps Clark and sits down.
Golden

DAY TWO
Close on a GOLF BALL. THWACK! The golf ball EXPLODES off the tee
from an oil
rig. The "TROLL" is the largest man-made structure
in the world - 12 aircraft
carriers big and 1200 feet tall. A
self-contained city.
HARRY STAMPER, world's foremost expert on offshore deep drilling,
immaculately
attired in golf attire and spikes, stands on a
patch of Astroturf with a five
iron in his hand. Piped-in MOZART
drown out the rig noise.
The main drilling platform. On "A" derrick, Chief Driller, A.J.
FROST, 30,
handsome, is at the controls. Roughnecks "JIMBO"
CARTWRIGHT, "BEAR" BROWN,
"CHICK" CHAPPLE, TITO GUEVARA, and MAX
LOGAN, handle 20 foot sections of PIPE
DRILLING SRTRING with a
HYDRAULIC TONG AND CLAMP.
Roughneck BENNIE MORGAN, late 20's an ox of a man, comes across
the platform,
pulling an oily green coveralls and donning his
hard-hat. Bennie examines the
rig's DOWNHOLE PRESSURE GAUGE.
Bennie Chick! take a look at this!
Chick Pressure's been up all morning. She kicked twice on me.
A.J.'s eyes move to a TALL BLOND MAN on his lunch break across
the rig.
A.J. What did our always-at-lunch-Swedish geologist say?
Bennie Jah, jah, jah. No bleeper. Too much pressure.
Chick You askin' the old man?
A.J. nods and walks off.
Harry HITS another ball. WE REVEAL his target, a GREENPEACE BOAT
anchored off
the rig. The BALL strikes the side of the boat,
just missing the head of ONE of
the PROTESTERS.
Harry Almost caught that little bastard.
He admires his shot as his daughter, GRACE, walks up. Grace is
late 20's,
business dress, Harvard Law.
Grace Having fun?
Harry HITS another ball. It misses the boat, skips across the
water.
Grace Sure sliced the shit outta that one.
(frowns)
Harry Watch your language, Gracie.
Grace Seagulls swallow those and they die.
Harry Stupid birds.
Harry's EYES move to a GROUP OF GREENPEACE PROTESTERS across the
rig, being held
back by Stamper Oil SECURITY GUARDS.
Grace I just talked with A.J.
Harry Talking to him quite a bit these days....
Grace
(awkward pause)
"A" rig's acting up. The drill string kicked twice this
morning, gave Chick a nasty bruise in the head.
Harry Good. He's not vulnerable there.
Grace Chase Manhatten okayed the bridge financing for the
Micronesia Project,
but at 21 percent interest. And Lloyd's of
London refuses to underwrite the
Venezuela> Project....
Harry Thieves and cowards, all of 'em. Twist their arms.
Grace I am.
Harry Keep twisting. Like a pit bull.
Grace Oh, and that magazine article - they want some human
interest stuff -
likes and dislikes. "Likes" I said Golf, Fly
Fishing, Single Malt Scotch, Old
Movies. What about
"Dislikes?"
Harry Any kind of flying and oil company executives. Go deal with
'em. I
always look better when you're doing the talking.
Harry HITS another ball. CLANG.
Grace You know you donate 300 grand a year to Greenpeace.
Harry smiles at the contradiction.
Harry What'd your mother call me?
Grace Complicated.
Harry Yeah well....I'm complicated.
Grace walks off, passing A.J., winking at him. A.J. winks back.
A.J. What's his mood?
Grace Complicated.
A.J. walks up to Harry.
Harry I understand we're having problems with "A" rig.
A.J. I'm on top of it
(Harry picks up his bag)
Harry, you have a second?
Harry Yeah. One.
A.J. I'll hurry. I've worked for you for a long time.
Harry Twelve years.
A.J. And you've been real good to me....
Harry Another company make you an offer, kid?
A.J. No. The reason I am here, today, standing here, talking to
you. I'm
obviously talking to you...but it's, you know, not,
uhh...it's not an
oil-related matter exactly....
Harry You're sweating, A.J.
A.J. You know there comes a time in a man's life when...
(to himself)
No,
that's a clich...
(to Harry)
Can I start again? I, uhh, fell...I've fallen...
Harry You hurt yourself?
A.J. In love, I mean. Fallen in love. It's the damnedest thing,
but this
person you...know...really well.
ACROSS THE PLATFORM - Grace escorts five angry OIL INDUSTRY
EXECUTIVES over to
Harry. A KLAXON SOUNDS. Harry, alarmed,
rushes right past them, toward the "A"
Derrick. They follow,
snapping at his heels
Oil Executive 1 You explicitly promised results at 25 thousand
feet.
Harry We have results.
Oil Executive 2 But we don't have oil. We've given you everything
you've
asked....
Harry Horseshit. What the...? Chick! Bennie! Somebody better tell
me why the
hell "A" derrick is not turning!
Chick hurries up to Harry.
Chick The uhh....the Greenpeace guys.
Harry approaches "A" Derrick. Five MEMBERS of Greenpeace have
handcuffed
themselves in a circle around the drilling pipe.
Harry Hey there, what can I do for you?
Greenpeace Leader This is an official protest.
Harry 'Course it is. I love you guys. You like dolphins and
whales, I like 'em
too. Hey, I know you. You too. Didn't you
have shorter hair?
Greenpeace Leader Stamper, do you know what this thing does to
the eco-system?
Harry How'd you get out here? Canoe? Rowboat? Oh, that boat down
there with a
thousand horsepower diesel!
Greenpeace Leader How can you wake up every day and look at
yourself in the
mirror?
Harry The same way you did when you blow-dried your hair this
morning. And you
used a curling iron, I betcha. Did you know
most electricity's from burning oil?
I'' stop drillin' when the
world - stops usin' it. Bennie, start 'er up!
Greenpeace Leader Wait........
Harry Can't wait! I'm a businessman! Those goons over there gave
me 57 mil. to
find oil and they ain't leavin' till I do! 'cause
they have no lives!
The drill string begins to turn in the hole.
Greenpeace Leader We....we threw away the key.
Harry Sorry. Time is money. BENNIE!
The MASSIVE HYDRAULIC KELLY begins to descend on the Greenpeace
Activists'
heads.
Greenpeace Leader STOP!!!!
Harry Bennie! Third gear!
The Greenpeace Leader miraculously produces a key and frantically
begins
unlocking the handcuffs.
Grace turns to the oil executives.
Grace He's good at public relations.
A.J. approaches Grace; they watch Harry.
Grace So?
(A.J. stares at her)
What?
(no response)
What?
(no response)
A.J.?
Suddenly, across "A" Derrick, a KLAXON SOUNDS.
Chick She's kickin'!
The civilians get the hell away.
Harry and A.J. run toward the rig.
Chick Pressure's north of seven thousand!
A.J. We gotta clear the Derrick!
Harry
(looks at wellhead)
Chick, rig up another pipe.
(Chick and Bennie look
at Harry with uncertainty)
NOW, NOT TOMORROW.
CHick and Bennie begin clamping, and tong a PIPE STRAND onto the
DRILL STRING
like an INDY PIT STOP CREW.
A.J. Harry, we've hit pressure. We gotta bleed it off. e go any
deeper, we'll
blow the rig.
Harry Thanks for that opinion. Chick, full speed!
A.J. The bit's five thousand feet down! Full speed'll rip the
pipe apart!
Harry You learn all this in college? I been doing this thirty
years, kid. Get
on the controls.
A.J. moves reluctantly to the DRILLING CONTROLS. Chick nods to
A.J., who engages
the gears. The PIPE STRING turns at FULL
SPEED. The new drill pipe descends ten
feet into the hole,
then....
The torque rips the NEWLY ATTACHED PIPE from the drilling string.
The drill
spins freely.
A.J. hits the "stop! lever and stares at Harry.
The roughnecks converge around the wellhead.
A.J. I'm goin' down. Reattach it. Gimme a wrench and a band
coupling.
Chick hand the items to A.J.
A.J. descends into the drilling hole.
RIG - "A" DERRICK
The wellhead KICKS. The rig platform shakes and shudders.
SEAWATER erupts from
the wellhead.
Chick The drill hole's flooding!
Grace A.J.!!
Harry strips off his jacket and climbs into the wellhead. He
takes a huge breath
and disappears into the brine-filled
drilling hole.
-- the wellhead KICKS again. The rig platform SHUDDERS violently.
The derrick
sways. SEAWATER SPEWS up from the wellhead.
Chick Get back, she's gonna blow!
Grace, Chick, Bennie and the other Roughnecks huddle around the
flooded drilling
hole, waiting. Tense, agonising seconds pass.
Harry scrambles out, covered in....CRUDE OIL.
He grabs Grace and pulls her away.
Grace Where's A.J.!!!?
Harry RIGHT BEHIND ME! RUN!
The platform SHAKES. Harry, Grace, and the others sprint away as
--
A GEYSER OF CRUDE OIL erupts from the drilling hole, blowing A.J.
out of the
hole fifteen feet above the wellhead. A.J. crashes to
the platform floor.
CRUDE OIL rains down on Grace and the Roughnecks...they run to
A.J.
Grace Never do that again!
CLOSE ON A.J. - he's looking back at the DRILL HOLE, panting,
traumatised,
greasy oil raining on his head.
A.J. You know how I told you there were two obstacles? I didn't
do the
first,'cause he's tough...but I did the second...!
(pulls out case; opens it)
I
got it at uhm..Tiffany's. I can't give it to you until I talk
to him, but try it on.
She reaches for the ring. It slips from A.J.'s hand and falls
through the grated
floor, pinging off the rig's steel pylons,
100 feet into the sea below.
Grace Don't worry! Tiffany's insures up to a week from purchase!
A.J. stares despondently over the railing.
Harry, black with crude oil, staggers past A.J.
A.J.
(pointedly)
Good plan, Harry.
Harry
(walks over to Oil Execs)
There's your oil, gentlemen. Now get the hell
off my rig.
The ground begins to SHAKE uncontrollably. EXHAUST billows out
from the Rocket's
BOOSTERS. The Russian rocket blasts off and
lifts into....
Something's wrong. The Rocket stops accelerating and stands still
for a moment.
It falls to Earth; BLOWING UP in a thunderous
inferno.
A champagne cork POPS and WIDEN TO Harry, Grace, A.J., and all
fifty Roughnecks.
The wellhead's been capped; pumping 2500
gallons per minute.
Harry To Hole Number Seventy-Six!
Roughnecks
(UNISON)
Hole Number Seventy-Six!
The Oil Executives stand off, watching.
Oil Executive 1 Seventy-Six?
Oil Executive 2 This is Harry's Seventy-Sixth straight hit.
Oil Executive 1 The man's a legend.
We hear the WHOP, WHOP, WHOP of HELICOPTER BLADES. Harry, Grace
and A.J. turn
toward the noise.
TWO U.S. ARMY BLACKHAWK HELICOPTERS whirr across the choppy
ocean.
The helicopters land on the heli-pad on the oil rig's top tier,
MAJOR STINSON,
50's, wearing formal dress and sunglasses along
with two strapping ADJUTANTS
stride across the rig.
Major Stinson Harry Stamper? I'm Major William Stinson, United
States Army. I
need a few words with you. In private.
Harry Say it now, say it quick, or get off my rig, Major. I've
got a business
to run here.
Major Stinson You've been summoned back to the States.
Harry Who's doin' the summoning?
Major Stinson Your Government, Mr Stamper.
The Roughnecks get out in front of the JOHNSON SPACE CENTER. They
stare up at
the familiar N.A.S.A. LOGO imprinted on the
building. Chick and Bennie exchange
looks --
BEHIND THEM
A battered Ford pick-up pulls up, driven by 71 year-old "MAMA"
MABEL BROWN.
Mabel's six foot-five, 375 pound son, BEAR, gets
out of the car.
Bear 'Bye, Mama.
Mabel Reginald, get over here and kiss your Mama goodbye.
Bear In front of the guys?
Mabel Never too old to kiss your Mama.
JIMBO, six-foot five, 375 pounds, bald, pulls up on a HARLEY
DAVIDSON
motorcycle. He climbs off the bike.
Chick There ain't no oil in this place. What the hell are we
doing here?
JET HANGER - DAY
A gleaming spit-shine hanger full of fifteen N.A.S.A. T-38
fighter jets. Our
drill team walks up looking worn out. They are
met at the open hanger door by
pilots CHUCK JR., Vietnam vet,
leatherneck-take-no-pussy-bullshit-type-of-guy
and HAMMER.
Chuck Jr. On this mission, they tell me you will experience the
worst G-Forces
in the history of flight. It's like an elephant
sitting on your chest. So, I
intend to flip you, spin you, splat
your bodies till your bones hurt. Now load up and
enjoy the
flight.
The Roughnecks, wearing flight suits and helmets, board the
planes. Harry does
not like the look of these things. Bear is
trying to figure out how to fit
inside.
Bear Thing's made for a child - like my kid's car seat.
Chuck Jr. and Hammer walk up to a nervous Harry.
Chuck Jr. What's the problem, Texas tough guy?
Harry I've got a thing about flying.
Chuck Jr. Not good for an astronaut.
(looks to Hammer)
Hammer, go easy, don't
rip his guts out.
Hammer Sure thing, Chuck.
The T-38's are pulling up and letting the drill crew out. They
walk back with
white sweat, soaked faces and wobbly legs. Harry
exits the plane.
Harry I hate to fly. I hate to fly. I hate it so much.
Harry leans over to puke.
Chick walks up to the house, KNOCKS. DENISE WILLIAMS answers the
door.
Chick Hey, Denise.
Denise What do you want, Chick?
A big six-year old boy, TOMMY, runs up behind his mom.
Tommy Who is it, Mommy?
Chick looks at Tommy, smiles.
Denise It's um...just a salesman, honey.
Chick Hi.
Tommy
(looking straight up)
You look like big foot.
Chick kneels, extends his hand. Tommy smiles and shakes it. Chick
doesn't want
to let go.
Chick I got a feeling you're going to be pretty big yourself.
Denise Go
inside and play, Tommy.
Tommy Okay, mommy. 'Bye, Big Foot.
Chick 'Bye, Tommy.
Chick watches Tommy run off. He looks to Denise.
Denise What was I supposed to tell him? We've got a life here
now, Chick, with
someone we can depend on.
Chick What I did before was wrong. Every day of my life I regret
it. I can see
you've got a good thing going, Denise, I'm not
trying to mess that up. But this
thing's come my
way and I got
the chance to do something really right.
Denise This another one of your scams, Chick?
Chick It's no scam. You might just be proud of me.
Denise opens the door a little wider, SHE SEES the car in the
driveway. The
N.A.S.A. logo stencilled on the door. The N.A.S.A.
Tech waiting.
Denise What's going on, Chick?
Chick I can't tell you now. But if it comes out good, I'll be
back.
(beat)
Then maybe you'd consider telling Tommy I'm not a...salesman.
It's good to see
you. You look really
beautiful.
Chick turns and walks away.
Denise Hey, Chick.
(Chick turns)
You be careful.
TWO X-71 SHUTTLES in the hanger. TECHNICIANS scramble around,
preparing the
shuttles for the mission.
Harry
(points)
From all of your intel, the deepest fault line is here. This is
my sweet spot. If I can get a clean hole in there, She'll blow in
half....
Golden ....and the two pieces will slide right past us. You
cannot shatter it.
Getting hit with 20 smaller asteroids is as
bad as one big one. You have to
drill, plant the nuke,
lift
off, and detonate -- all before the asteroid reaches this
position.
(demonstrates position)
You have eight hours. Remember it. You must
detonate by this
point or,
the two halves will hit us.
Harry nods and walks off.
Sharp Drill an eight-hundred foot hole in eight hours? Is that
possible?
Harry doesn't like to be questioned --
Harry You just worry about getting me on that rock, Colonel. Let
me worry
about the drilling.
A moment of conflict between them.
ONE OF THE ARMADILLOS, complete with drilling arm, sits at the
bottom of the
tank. Harry and six Roughnecks are already at the
bottom, in pressure suits and
helmets.
Golden, Quincy, Clark, Sharp, Truman, and all of the N.A.S.A.
BRASS, observe.
A.J. is the last to enter the tank.
Harry is outside, smoking a Coheba. Harry runs his hand over a
SMALL METAL MEDAL
that hangs from his neck. Golden approaches.
Golden A.J.'s off the team. We need a list of names from you to
fill the slot.
Harry A.J. would be the first name on my list.
Golden We don't want independent thinkers. And we don't need
heroes. We need a
team.
Harry You have to have confidence in the men you send up. I
understand that.
But I'm the one that has to land on that rock.
Not you.
(firm)
I pick my own
team.
Golden One shot. Pull him in line or send him home.
INT . HUB OF ROCKET SIMULATOR - NIGHT
A.J. and Grace are there talking. Grace is on A.J.'s lap.
A.J. I pushed it, I screwed up.
Grace These astronauts train for years for what you're training
for in a few
days.
A.J. I don't know why I didn't just listen to them.
Grace So, tomorrow you listen.
A.J. and Grace share a look.
A.J. I love you, Grace.
A N.A.S.A. Tech approaches.
N.A.S.A. Technician Harry wants to see you.
Two sleek BLACK LEAR JETS are parked on the runway. Harry studies
them. Grace
approaches.
Harry You know I was thinking, Gracie. Over the years, I should
have patted
you on the back more....
Grace Dad, you don't need --
Harry No father has ever been prouder of his child, Gracie. I
want you to know
that.
Grace's reaction makes it clear that Harry has never said
anything like this
before.
Grace I love you, Dad.
Harry I love you too, Gracie.
Grace
(as they hug)
Keep an eye on A.J. for me.
Harry climbs up the metal stairs --
A.J. and the rest of Harry's crew comes out of the building. A.J.
moves to Grace
as she watches her father disappear into the jet.
A.J. Excuse me.
(Grace turns)
You're really insanely gorgeous and I was jost
sort of
wondering if you --
Grace I'm engaged. But my father hasn't given him his blessing so
you might
still have a chance.
(smiles, then serious)
Promise me you won't do anything
stupid up there.
A.J. nods. They kiss passionately. Harry's crew sees this and
applauds. Grace
blushes, embarrassed.
A.J. I love you, Grace.
Grace I love you. Come back, Okay?
Harry's crew boards LEAR JET 2. A.J. starts toward LEAR JET 1.
Grace watches him
walk away, eyeing his suit.
Grace A.J.--
A.J.
(turning)
Yeah?
Grace When you get back, ask them if you can kep the suit
(winks)
It's kind of
sexy.
The cone-shaped noses of the two X-71's are towering silhouettes
against the
sun. Massive CRAWLERS move the shuttles to the
launch tower.
Seen from a distance as silhouettes behind a sun-soaked sky,
sixteen figures
walk toward us. As they grow closer, WE SEE the
intense game faces of Harry,
A.J., Bennie, Chick, Jumbo, Tito,
Rockhound, Max and others approaching the
launch site. They look
like N.A.S.A.'s version of the "Dirty Dozen."
Harry carries a LARGE MYSTERIOUS METAL CASE, that we've not seen
before now.
Metal components one after the other come out of the shuttle
hatchway and SLAM
into a heap on the lake bed. Harry then
appears in the hatchway.
Harry We don't need music and we don't mind dirty utensils.
Harry picks up his LARGE METAL CASE and ducks back inside the
Freedom. The
N.A.S.A Techs stare at the ruined components at
their feet.
The ground TREMBLES like an earthquake. EXHAUST BILLOWS out of
the ROCKET
BOOSTERS, filling frame. Shuttles Freedom and
Independence ROCKET OFF from dual launch pads, STREAKING
BETWEEN
CAMERA, climbing to the heavens.
Freedom and Independence scream away from Earth, dropping their
booster
canisters.
Harry, Chick and the others experience their first G-Forces.
PULL OUT of the MIR's window to see Lev dancing with joy. He's
celebrating the
forthcoming arrival.
PULL FURTHER BACK to catch a wider view of the Russian multi-
module Space
Station -- a white winged steel seagull.
Freedom and Independence approach the MIR station. The MIR is T-
shaped, with
TWIN DOCKING PORTS at each end of the T's crossbar.
Freedom begins docking at
one end., Independence at the other.
The MIR shudders and begins to TILT TO ONE SIDE.
The two shuttles RELEASE AWAY from the MIR Station on FULL
THRUSTER POWER, just
escaping as --
THE MIR STATION EXPLODES in an eternal flash fire, blowing out
sections of wall
panels and sending a SOLAR PANEL shooting
toward Freedom that just misses her!
The collapsed MIR STATION
drifts off into the oblivion of space.
The two Shuttles approach THE MOON, Freedom in the lead,
Independence following.
Beyond the Moon, too distant to see clearly, THE ASTEROID is on
its trajectory
toward Earth. It is a HUGE, GRAGGY MASS
surrounded on all sides by a DEBRIS
CLUSTER of rock and ice, the
ice glinting on and off in reflected sunlight, like
millions of
fireflies.
The Shuttles rapidly close on the moon. The dead, luminous sphere
looms larger
in frame.
Shuttles Freedom and Independence shoot toward the Moon, pulled
by the lunar
gravitational field.
The two Shuttles whip into lunar orbit, moving around the Moon,
continuing to
accelerate, nearing its Dark side.
On the Moon's opposite side, THE ASTEROID roars into frame, its
trailing
fragments motionless in relation to each other,
travelling as a swarm, a cluster
of debris. As it nears the
Moon's gravitational field --
TRAILING FRAGMENTS peel away, drawn into the Moon by its lunar
gravity. A
relatively DEBRIS-LESS CORRIDOR begins to form on one
side of the asteroid.
Freedom and Independence fire their BOOSTERS. The two SHUTTLES
explode forward,
hurtling around the Moon's DARK SIDE with a
degree of increasing velocity never
before experienced by man.
IN ONE AWE-INSPIRING SHOT, we see --
Shuttles Freedom and Independence rocketing around the Moon in
darkness, further
and further, until finally WE SEE,
increasingly, a staggering, mind blowing
visual --
THE ASTEROID'S TRAILING DEBRIS appears, a HUGE CLOUD of tiny ICE
CHUNKS AND
PEBBLES, and much larger BOULDERS, and ICEBERGS the
size of houses, the ice
glinting with reflected sunlight,
throwing off a dazzling SPECTRAL SHOWER OF
LIGHT in all
directions, and finally --
THE ASTEROID'S HUGE CORE - it has just cleared the Moon and now
flies straight
for it's destination - the cool, blue PLANET
EARTH dead ahead across an expanse
of space.
Shuttles Freedom and Independence slingshot out of the Lunar
orbit and fall in
behind the asteroid, settling into the DEBRIS-
LESS CORRIDOR.
Freedom, in the lead, and Independence, following to the rear and
side, descend
through the debris-less corridor to the waiting
asteroid.
Suddenly a CLOUD OF ICE AND PEBBLES wafts in front of the
Shuttles.
Freedom goes left, Independence right, splitting the ice boulder.
Freedom clears the ice boulder by a foot. Independence, not so
lucky, clips the
ice boulder, ripping her left thruster clean
off. With one thruster,
Independence careens out of control,
twirling and spinning.
Freedom hits a SMALLER ROCK, which changes its skid angle. It
clears the boulder
by a foot and skids to a stop at the base of
the slope.
Freedom's cargo door opens; its RAMP unfolds to the asteroid's
surface. HARRY
looks out.
Freedom is in a small, cold, dark valley. The asteroid's face is
tilted away
from the Earth and Sun. THE MOON is huge on our rear
horizon. The place is
eerily calm and tranquil. Harry walks down
the ramp onto the asteroid surface.
The Armadillo rumbles out of the cargo bay, carrying Bear, Max,
Rockhound and
Pitts over the wheel wells.
The Armadillo drives 50 yards from Freedom and parks. The guys
hop down, turning
on their PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTERS. Bear begins
off-loading 20-foot long DRILLING
PIPES.
Harry takes readings from a SEISMIC INSTRUMENT. Pulls out a SOIL
SAMPLER, a
small shovel on a telescoping shaft. He digs it in
with his boot. Clang. It
doesn't dig in at all. He walks around,
stabbing it into the ground. CLANG.
CLANG.
Chick exchanges nervous looks with Bear and Max.
Harry Bedrock. Whole goddamn place is Bedrock.
Harry examines the ground. Not satisfied. He finds a spot he
likes; digs an "X"
in the soil with his boot.
Harry
(cont'd)
Here. Fire up the Bad Boy bit.
Chick, Max and Bear go into action. Max screws the Bad Boy bit
onto the first
drilling pipe. Bear hoists the pipe up to the
DRILLING MECHANISM, muscles it
onto the DRILL DRIVE, then clamps
it on.
Harry plugs a TEE and GOLF BALL into the craggy surface. He
waggles his club, a
5-IRON HEAD, screwed onto the soil sampler's
shaft.
Pitts What's he doing?
Chick Wildcatters are superstitious, Colonel. Harry does this
every time we
break ground.
He swings....WHACK! The ball rockets off the tee and keeps
going...and going...
Harry HOLE NUMBER 77. Let 'er rip!
Chick throws a lever, lowering the BAD BOY BIT into the rocky,
icy surface. Down
the drill pipe goes, unimpeded, 10 feet just
like that. It suddenly stops. It's
turning, but not drilling.
Bear and Max approach the drill hole.
Bear What in hell's down there?
Harry Chick, bring 'er up!
Chick throws it in reverse. The DRILLING ARM reverses out of the
hole. The Bad
Boy bot comes up CHEWED TO SHREDS. Harry and the
guys examine the drill bit.
Everyone exchanges a worried look.
Max The dream. It's my dream.
Harry Shut up, Max.
(looks at Bear)
What's with the look? Get that off your
face. You've seen bits
get eaten before.
Bear Not after ten feet.
Chick The first ten better be the worst ten.
Harry Go to the Terminator.
Chick grabs Harry's mysterious METAL CASE. Harry pops open the
metal case,
revealing THE TERMINATOR, a super high-tech bit.
Harry I designed you. I built you. You are the enemy of all
subterranean shit.
You are the king. It's showtime.
Harry passes it to Bear, who screws it onto the drilling pipe,
Rockhound scoops
up a COLLECTION OF DOWNHOLE ROCK CHIPS.
Harry
(cont'd)
Hit it, Chick.
The DRILL PIPE turns. Sediment comes WHOOSHING out of the hole
and -- THE DRILL
PIPE descends like a bitch.
The gnarled WRECK OF SHUTTLE INDEPENDENCE lies below. Twisted
metal and cabin
materials strewn everywhere.
Chick and Bear screw on a new length of drill pipe. Chick engages
the gears. The
drill pipe descends. THE TERMINATOR is working.
Harry approaches from the
shuttle.
Harry How far?
Chick Almost 60 feet and startin' to kick ass!
Suddenly GRRRR. CLANG. BANG. The drill pipe stops. Harry walks
over to the hole.
Chick
(cont'd)
That did not sound good.
Harry Increase r.p.m.
Chick throws the lever. The drill pipe turns faster, but still
doesn,t descend.
Harry and the guys crowd around the drilling
hole.
Max Freaky, man.
Bear I got one of those big-time crappy feelings about this.
Harry We gotta get more power down to this bit.
(thinks; looks up at Chick)
Full throttle.
Chick You sure?
Harry Yeah, I'm sure.
Chick I don't think she can take it.
Harry She's gonna have to.
Chick The last time we ran her at full throttle we ripped her up!
Harry I don't have time to argue, Chick, now goddamn it, throttle
up, or I'll
come up there and do it for you.
Chick reluctantly throws the lever to FULL THROTTLE. The TURBINE
ENGINE ROARS.
The DRILL PIPE turns faster in the hole. The
TURBINE ENGINE is shaking the
Armadillo. The drill pipe is
descending again. Suddenly BANG!! The CLUTCH
rupture, spewing
the CLUTCH PLATES and GEARS into space.
Harry Stop!
Chick throws it into reverse. Up comes THE TERMINATOR, CHEWED TO
SHREDS. Bear
and Max look at it, then each other. Very worried
now.
Bear The Terminator's terminated.
Chick The clutch is dead.
Harry We're goin' to the second rig.
Harry stalks off toward the Shuttle.
Harry
(cont'd)
We need the second Armadillo.
Sharp We'll bring it out to you.
Harry moves to get his pipe tongs. Fisk and Pitts are next to the
uncovered
nuclear bomb. Harry looks at the bomb.
Chick, Bear and Max listen to Harry over the inter-crew link.
INTERCUT WITH ABOVE.
Lev is prying open the cargo bay ramp door
(the hydraulics are shot)
.
LEV YOU COME PUSH, YANKEE....
The Armadillo, engine rumbling, is poised to roll Independence's
long tubular
NUCLEAR WEAPON which has been ejected with other
debris from the broken
fuselage.
Lev Wait A.J.! We drive over nuclear weapon and we finished
before we started.
A.J. So move it.
Lev jams a pipe between the ARMING DEVIC and the nuke. As he
rolls the nuke
over, the arming device detaches, rips off, and
clatters to the ground.
The airlock opens. Sharp and Pitts are led out by Harry.
Harry Colonel Sharp, if we're going to blow this hole, you gotta
help ME. I
need some more manpower....
The SECOND ARMADILLO rumbles out of Freedom's cargo bay. Chick
and the
Roughnecks work like a NASCAR pit crew. Sharp and Pitts
lay on their backs
holding down a 1000 pound axle, fighting
zero-g.
Suddenly, the ground begins to tremble.
A.J.'s ARMADILLO rumbles over a little hill revealing the RIDGE
WTH THREE SPIRES
directly in front of them. THE SUN is moving
over the asteroid's FAR HORIZON,
causing a "sunrise." It is
breathtaking, spiritual...and frighteningly bright.
Lev gets out; he nervously paces back and forth across the lip of
the fissure.
Lev This bad.
(repeating, mantra)
Darth Vader. Darth Vader.
A.J. Listen, Mr. Negative. Everyone thinks we're dead. We're not.
So, suck it
up. Because if we don't drill that hole, six billion
people are going to die.
And I'm not lettin' Harry Stamper get
all the freaking credit for saving the world.
(firm)
We're gona do this, then we're going home.
Lev I l-o-v-e this American confidence! Like John Wayne.
(sotto)
This why I
suspect you won Cold War.
A.J. Hep me get these rocks over there.
A.J. and Lev start dragging rocks to use as a "kicker ramp" for
the jump. Lev is
oblivious. They pull embedded rock out,
revealing DIAMONDS. A.J. holds up a
large chunk.
A.J.
(cont'd)
This outta cut into a sweet wedding ring.
Lev
(holding chunk)
With this I can rebuild my MIR.
Chick, Bear, and Max cautiously approach the drill hole.
Everything seems okay.
Chick climbs back up to the drill-drive
platform.
Chick Back to work!
Bear grabs the drill pipe and hoists it... back to work.
A.J. is walking along the GAPING, JAGGED FISSURE, 50 feet wide,
50 feet deep,
stretching across the entire slope.
Lev This bad, this very bad, very, very bad...
A.J. Stick a cork in it, Lev. I'm tryin' to think.
A.J. stares at the fissure, his eyes roaming from the
fissure...to the
Armadillo...back to the fissure.
A.J.
(cont'd)
Hop on the back. Get our weight distributed better.
Lev
(uncertain)
And why to do this?
A.J. Because I'm askin'. And turn your suit's thrusters off.
Trust me, okay?
A.J. gets in the Armadillo. Lev goes around back, climbs on the
REAR BUMPER. He
clicks off his pressure suit's pro-gravity
thrusters.
Lev Okey-doke.
The Armadillo begins backing down the slope.
The Armadillo's REAR TIRES CHURN FORWARD, slinging rocks and
gravel which, in
zero-g, shoot off in a stream into space, never
falling. Lev holds on for dear
life.
A.J.'S Armadillo churns up the slope like a Bronco 4X4, slinging
gravel, heading
for THE JAGGED FISSURE. It FLIES over the
fissure's edge as --
-- the Armadillo's roof-mounted PRO-GRAVITY THRUSTERS shut down.
The Armadillo, no longer thrusting downwardly, flies across the
jagged fissure
in zero-g. The heavy steel vehicle doesn't fall.
It ascends, and amazingly,
shoots across the entire 50 foot
expanse of jagged fissure.
Lev looks down. The FISSURE passes beneath him, then SOLID GROUND
again. They've
cleared the fissure....but they're not coming
down.
Lev A.J., up is bad! Down!
The thruster nozzles SPUTTER, but no thrust. The Armadillo is 50
feet off the
ground and still ascending...into outer space. Lev,
his next stop being Planet
Mars, panics. He climbs the roof and
peers inside the front windshield, POUNDING
ON THE WINDSHIELD.
Lev Down! Not up! Up is bad! Down!
Not quite. Only the right-front and right-rear THRUSTER NOZZLES
fire, pushing
the right side downward, rolling the Armadillo
over on its side. Lev, on the
bumper, clings to the rear-mounted
TOW WINCH AND CABLE ASSEMBLY.
Suspended in zero-g, on its side and in mid-air, the Armadillo is
pushed by
thrusters, tires-first, against the SHEER, 90 DEGREE
CLIFF FACE next to the
slope. All four Armadillo tires slam
against the cliff. The Armadillo bounces
off.
Lev, grabbing the Armadillo's TOWING CABLE, flies off the rear.
The cable spools
out and LEV, hanging on for all he's worth,
SLAMS against the cliff face and
descends....
-- the Armadillo, all four thrusters now working, drives sideways
across the
cliff face dragging Lev, who bounces against the
cliff face and gradually falls,
until he's bouncing on the
asteroid surface.
The Armadillo finally falls down the cliff face and skids to a
stop.
A.J. walks to the rear. Lev splayed out 50 feet from the back of
the Armadillo,
covered in asteroid surface dirt and grime, looks
up at him.
Lev Very bad idea, A.J.
Harry orders his crew to start the drill up. The men drill a
shitload of feet in
record time. They finally burst through the
rock and hit easy sediment.
The asteroid is spinning toward sunlight. Here, too, there is a
sunrise. Bear's
face sweats inside the helmet. Chick's vision
begins to blur. Tito takes a seat
on a nearby rock, exhausted.
Chick Mutha...it's getting warm.
Bear
(worried)
We got that sunrise, Harry. These bits are gonna fry up......
Suddenly the TRANSMISSION LINKAGE in the Armadillo BLOWS.
Harry Goddamn it!
(thinks)
We'' take the tranny from the other rig! And if you
wanna
complain about the heat, go to some other fucking
asteroid....Toughen up.
Sharp
(to Roughnecks)
Let's move it.....let's go, guys.
Chick and Bear yank the detached good TRANSMISSION HOUSING from
inside Armadillo
2 and carry it across to Armadillo 1.
Chick and Bear, atop the drilling platform, begin installing the
clutch plates
and transmission linkage.
Harry Move guys, move it.....
Bolting, bolting, bolting, connecting, connecting.....
Harry's watching the work. Out of the corner of his eye... THE
DRILLING ARM
KICKS. Harry turns to it. Nothing happens. His eyes
move back to Chick and Bear,
then back to the drilling arm. It
kicks up again. Just a few inches.
Harry Chick. Unbolt the tranny.
Chick We just put it in.
Harry Do it. NOW.
Chick, confused, starts unbolting the tranny. Suddenly the well
kicks hard, one
foot high. Chick's jostled. BANG!! The RIG KICKS
HARD, THREE FEET, bucking Chick
off.
Chick scrambles back up to the drill platform.
The ground shakes. a terrific TREMBLER rumbles through the
valley. Harry, Max
and Bear cling to the side of the Armadillo.
Chick's nearly thrown off.
Harry
(cont'd)
GET THE TRANNY OUTTA THERE! WE LOSE THE TRANNY, WE'RE DEAD
MEN!!
Harry climbs up to the DRILL PLATFORM. The GROUND SHAKES
violently, throwing
harry and Chick around the top of the drill
platform.
Harry Max, you gotta get those bolts undone!
Chick and Harry pull the unfastened TRANNY HOUSING out of the
Armadillo as --
Suddenly the DRILLING ARM jolts upward, lifting the ARMADILLO SIX
FEET off the
ground.
Chick She's gonna blow!
Harry MAX, GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE!!!
The DRILLING ARM KICKS again, six feet this time, tossing the
Armadillo over on
two wheels.
A DEEP RUMBLING emanates from the drilling hole, coming seemingly
from the
ASTEROID'S CORE. Harry gets to his feet and SLAMS HIS
FIST against the
Armadillo's SIDE.
Harry CLEAR THE RIG!
Everyone scatters....
WIth an awesome force, the DRILLING HOLE BLOWS. The DRILLING PIPE
EXPLODES
upward, lifting the DRILLING ARM and the ENTIRE
ARMADILLO VEHICLE with it. THE
ENTIRE RIG blows upward into
space.
FIFTY FEET OF DRILL PIPE, THE DRILLING ARM, and the entire
ARMADILLO RIG with
MAX trailing, BLOWS into space. MAX'S FACE is
a screaming mask of terror and
confusion, reaching out, but
there's no one to catch him....Harry and the guys
watch in
helpless silence as the drill rig and Max ascend into space.
Chick Max.....No. No. No.
Silence. A stark tableau. Harry and the men standing there, just
watching.
Devastated, confused, in shock. This is a total
catastrophe. The mission is
over.
Sharp nods to Pitts. Pitts picks up the REMOTE NUCLEAR DETONATOR.
Sharp Stamper, you ready to blow this? Let's get outta here...!
Harry ignores him. He won't accept defeat.
Harry Chick, get your butt over here.
Chick drags his ass over to Harry.
Chick Yeah.
Harry We're gonna fix this - make it work. If we weld those two
together and
go in one speed....
Chick Harry....
Harry Get your ass up here!
Chick doesn't move. The two men stare at each other.
Chick I've been with you fourteen years. I've never said this to
you, never
thought I would. It's over.
Chick walks off toward the shuttle. Bear joins him.
Harry, atop of the Armadillo, looks around. His head drops...he's
burning up.
His fist clenches the HALF MEDALLION in his hand
(where is it - clipped to suit
- in pouch of suit?)
His eyes shut tightly. He is going to will victory from
defeat.
He will not give up.
CAMERA'S at low angle, giving Harry a larger-than-life look.
Harry hears something. A LOW RUMBLE. It is confusing. It sounds
like......an
ARMADILLO ENGINE.
Harry opens his eyes. He slowly turns and looks --
ACROSS THE VALLEY - ON THE DISTANT RIDGE - The front bumper of
A.J.'s Armadillo
inches over the ridge crest.
HARRY, for the first time on the asteroid, smiles. Miracles do
happen.
HARRY CHICK...BEAR!!!
Chick and Bear about ready to enter the Freedom's airlock, stop
and turn. They
see A.J.'S ARMADILLO ROARING down the hillside
onto the drilling site.
A.J. and Lev roar up to the drilling site in the Independence's
Armadillo. They
come down a hill spectacularly without brakes
and it piles into shit, knocking
things down.
Lev and A.J. bounce up to Chick and Bear.....hugs and high-fives
go around.
Bear A.J. Frost. Back from the dead.
Chick Now you can die with us.
Harry All the bits are gone, A.J. I've been inventing drill bits
for
twenty-five years and I don't know what to use.
A.J. You wouldn't happen to need a diamond tipper, would you?
A.J. pulls out the POUCH OF DIAMONDS, found on the ridge.
Harry Boys, we're back in business!
Chick shuts off an ARC WELDER and moves aside, letting Harry view
a DRILL BIT
with A.J.'S DIAMONDS mounted on the top like
diamonds in a ring setting. Harry
and the guys smile.
The NEWLY CREATED DRILL BIT lowers into the drilling hole and
begins turning. It
CHEWS into the shit down below, WHIRRING and
RIPPING and......descends quickly.
Chick It worked! She's goin' through her like a hot knife through
butter!
BEGIN MONTAGE
The men drill a shitload of feet in very little time. It is a
feverish pace,
their teamwork perfectly timed, as if
choreographed.
QUICK CUTS
--A.J. working the levers on the drill platform.
--Hydraulic tongs clamping, unclamping on pipe.
--Bear hoisting pipe.
--Chick and Bear waiting with connecting pipe.
--The drilling arm going up and down.
--Newly connected drill pipes descending into the hole.
--Harry watching, shouting orders.
--There are serious wind storms, giving Harry, A.J., and the
other guys
problems. So severe they knock guys across the
asteroid.
END MONTAGE
Harry Time, A.J.
A.J. One hour.
Harry Distance, Chick.
Chick Eight hundred and twenty feet, Harry.
Harry We gotta do 180 in thirty minutes.
Chick Downhole pressure's goin' through the roof!
Harry Stop! Shut down.
Chick throws the lever. The drill pipe stops turning.
A.J. Harry, we can't stop.
Harry Got to, kid. No choice.
A.J. Drill right through the pressure to pay dirt.
Harry That's crazy.
A.J. Sometimes crazy works.
Harry and A.J. stare at each other.
Harry Chick, A.J.'s callin' this one.
A.J. Full throttle!
Chick throws the lever. The DRILL PIPE descends on full throttle.
The HOLE'S finished, the drill pipe's been pulled; A.J. drives
the ARMADILLO
safely away from the site.
Watts and Sharp roll a GURNEY containing the NUCLEAR DEVICE
(a massive stainless
steel tube)
down Freedom's cargo bay RAMP toward the hole. Harry and all the
Roughnecks stand by the HOLE.
Harry One thousand feet.
Chick
(smiles)
Thousand and three, Harry. With a half hour to spare.
Sharp and Watts roll the NUCLEAR DEVICE GURNEY past the
Roughnecks up to the
drilling hole.
Harry Get the pipe and bit outta there.
Chick gets inside the Armadillo. Grabs the stick-shift.
Compresses the clutch
and throws it in reverse.
THE DRILL PIPE begins to reverse out of the hole.
The DRILL PIPE turns sloely, retracting from the hole. Bear, atop
the drilling
platform, is working on something with a wrench.
Bear accidently drops his wrench. It falls on the turbine's
RIPPED MESH
PROTECTIVE SCREEN and hangs there. Bear looks at it
nervously and reaches...THE
WRENCH falls into the turbine
spinning at six-thousand r.p.m. With a GRINDING
SQUEAL, the
wrench shrapnel blows out of the turbine and --
THE DRILLING ARM reverses speeds and VIOLENTLY THRUSTS THE PIPE
FORWARD,
buckling it. A piece of the drill string is BLOWN OUT,
smashing into Sharp's
helmet, spider-webbing his faceshield.
He's out cold.
Harry and the guys dive away from the hole. Chick, confused,
works the clutch
furiously to no avail. THE DRILLING ARM RAMS
THE PIPE back down the hole, where
it BUCKLES, BENDS AND BREAKS
IN HALF.
Tito tends to Sharp..his face has lost all color. Harry
approaches the hole.
Looks down. FIFTY FEET DOWN IS A MESS OF
MANGLED PIPE, blocking the hole.
Harry Well, Dan, you're just going to have to goddamn wait 'CAUSE
WE GOTTA BIG
PROBLEM UP HERE IN HELL.
(turns to guys)
Somebody's gotta go down there.
Chick Don't look at me.
Bear I can't even get my foot in there.
Harry turns and eyes A.J.
A.J. stares down the hole.
Harry Do or die, kid.
CLOSE ON A.J. as he peers into the hole.
A.J. Something I've been meaning to talk to you about. When this
is all over
and we're back home, I'd like to marry your
daughter....
Harry stares at A.J., the look priceless.
A.J.
(cont'd)
Maybe I'll ask her again later....
Harry turns around..looking up at the star-filled sky. A.J. walks
over to
Sharp...who's coming to now.
Harry
(to Golden)
Oh yeah, Golden?
Golden
(V.O.)
Go ahead, Harry.
Harry Your shuttle pilot just took a nasty shot from a drill
string....
Golden Is he alright?
Harry I hope so, he's gotta get us off this shithole.
The guys stand there, watching. Nothing happens. Agonising
seconds pass.
Suddenly the ground rumbles. Another EARTHQUAKE.
It slowly starts to subside.
Sharp Enter interface with the weapon.
Pitts clicks a six digit code into a DIGITAL PAD on the DEVICE'S
REMOTE
DETONATOR.
Pitts Device armed.
The NUCLEAR DEVICE has a small SLED with RATCHET WHEELS to let it
slide down the
hole slowly. Sharp and Watts lift one end of the
gurney. THE NUCLEAR DEVICE
slides off the gurney toward the
MOUTH OF THE DRILLING HOLE.
NT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY
The thermal and seismic sensors BEING TRANSMITTED FROM FREEDOM
START GOING CRAZY
Skip It's a mess up there...!
ANOTHER TEMBLOR hits, the worst yet, 9.7 on Earth. Watts falls,
losing her grip
on the gurney; her end collapses. THE NUCLEAR
DEVICE lurches sideways off the
gurney and rolls away from the
drilling hole......
The NUCLEAR DEVICE slides off the gurney....
Everyone whirls around in the sound's direction as --
ACROSS THE VALLEY FLOOR - A 100 FOOT METHANE GEYSER erupts,
spewing a PLUME OF
HIDEOUS GREENISH GAS into space. Then another
200 FEET HIGH! Another 500 FEET
HIGH! The ASTEROID has become
alive. The geyser's eruptions loosen the
asteroid's surface
material and --
PEBBLES AND HOT STEAM BLASTS from the drilling hole. Everyone
recoils....
Harry Get back!!
A.J. shoots out of the pipe, tethering the SAFETY LINE behind
him, blowing into
space. The safety tether snaps and RIPS off.
A.J. is 70 feet off the surface.
Harry dives for his ripped
tether. Catching it, inches before A.J.'s thrown into
space.
Harry and Bear grab A.J.'s safety tether and begin to pull him
down. Chick
stares at something O.S., his jaw drops.
Chick This thing definitely doesn't like us.
CHUNKS OF THE ASTEROID, some as big as trucks, others as big as
houses, dislodge
from the ASTEROID SURFACE and, slowly at first,
but with terrifyingly increasing
speed and momentum.....
.... they start rolling.
HARRY AND THE GUYS just stand there, disbelieving what they're
seeing.
On come the ROCKS and ICE CHUNKS, rolling. As they hit smaller
surface rocks,
they take little hops, and bigger hops, until
they are BOUNDING across the
surface. Harry lashes A.J.'s tether
to the Armadillo.
Harry and the guys run for their lives.
In the midst of this --
-- A 500 FOOT HIGH GEYSER erupts next to the drilling hole. Pitts
gets blasted
by the geyser, which blows him across the asteroid
floor, SLAMMING him into the
parked Armadillo. A BOULDER rolls
at Pitts and squashes him against the
ARMADILLO , killing him.
A 20 FOOT ICE BOULDER rolls toward A.J.'s SAFETY TETHER.
A.J., suspended 70 feet off the asteroid surface, looks down at
the ONCOMING ICE
BOULDER. A.J., terrified, tries to unbuckle the
tether, but he can't in time.
The boulder hits A.J.'s tether, rolling over it, flattening it to
the asteroid
surface, which causes --
--A.J., with a JOLT, to be yanked toward the surface. A.J.
scrambles with his
safety harness.
Chick, next to the Armadillo, sees A.J.'s plight. He dives
inside, engages the
gears. The Armadillo ROARS toward the
oncoming ICE BOULDER.
A.J., terrified, continues to descend as --
Chick, driving the Armadillo, rams the ICE BOULDER just as it's
about to roll
over A.J. The boulder hops up, SMASHES down on the
Armadillo's hood, CRUSHING
the steel compartment around Chick,
and gently rolls over onto --
A.J., who log-rolls under the Armadillo, as the ice boulder
WHOMPS down and
keeps rolling.
THE NUCLEAR DEVICE is rolling across the asteroid's surface.
Pebbles and debris
CLANGING off the device's REMOTE
DETONATOR.....
Harry bounds toward the Armadillo. THE LARGEST, JAGGED ROCK rolls
at the
vehicle. Harry's caught. There's no place to turn. The
rocks rolls straight at
him. Twenty feet....10 feet....Harry
FALLS heavily to the ground.
Harry gets up and dives down inside a fox-hoe-sized INDENTATION
in the asteroid
surface....
The BOULDER rolls right over him.
Finally the quake stops. The situation stabilises. Everyone gets
to their feet.
Harry and A.J. get up. They look off at --
The MASSIVE BOULDERS rolling away in the distance, smashing into
other rock
formations.
Harry picks up a DIAMOND. It SPARKLES in the light. Chick grabs
one. Holds it
up, marvelling at it. The MASSIVE BOULDERS rolling
away in the distance,
smashing into other rock formations.
Harry picks up a DIAMOND. It SPARKLES in the light. Chick grabs
one. Holds it
up, marvelling at it.
Sharp, with bruises on his face, looks through his cracked
faceshield down at
Pitt's corpse.
Sharp He's dead.
Harry Put it down, Chick.
Chick tosses down the diamond and follows Harry. Everyone checks
themselves.
Looks at others. There's no talk, no time to lose.
They reconvene, by the
NUCLEAR DEVICE. It's dented. The
alumniium gurney is smashed, mangled.
Sharp Three on that side, the rest over here.
They hoist the nuclear device and carry it to the drilling hole.
They plug one
end of the nuke in the drilling hole and lift the
other. The NUKE begins to
insert down the hole. Suddenly Sharp
tries to grab a TUBULAR PIECE OF ALUMINIUM
from the broken
gurney.
Sharp
(cont'd)
Stop...!
-- rams it into the wheels of the NUKE'S RATCHET-WHEEL DELIVERY
SLED. The nuke
stops inserting into the hole. Sharp inspects the
REMOTE DETONATOR.
Sharp
(cont'd)
The remote's shot.
(looks up)
It'll have to be manually
detonated.
Chick What's that mean?
Pause.
Harry Means one of us ain't leaving.
Harry and A.J. approach the NUCLEAR DEVICE. It's half in, half
out of the
drilling hole, as they left it. Harry and A.J.
alligator-clamp the end of the
wire spool-drum onto the nuke's
DETONATION DEVICE.
A.J You never answered my question.
They finish attaching the wire.
A.J. pulls the piece of TUBULAR ALUMINIUM out of the nuke's
ratchet wheel
delivery sled. The NUKE descends downhole, slowly
spooling out wire from the
SPOOL DRUM.
A.J. About Grace, Harry.
(laughs nervously)
I know it ain't gonna happen now,
but....if things were
different...What would you say...?
Harry walks back toward Freedom. A.J. follows.
Harry I always wanted a son. And if I had....I'd want him to be
like you.
Harry hands him the pipe section.
Harry
(cont'd)
You're going to need some magic in the world. You can marry
her, A.J.
A.J. laughs, being told at this dire time in his life. He looks
at Harry with a
hint of bittersweet smile.
A.J. Mean "could have...?"
Harry No. Go home, A.J. Marry Grace.
A.J. I'm not going home Harry.
With one hand, Harry stabs the airlock door, and then with a
small pipe clamp,
rips A.J.'s air tubes off.
Harry It's my hole, I drilled it, and I'm staying with it till
the end.
Harry grabs him, throws his kicking, screaming body into the
airlock. A.J. is
choking.
Harry
(cont'd)
She's always going to be my little girl.
The door shuts automatically. Harry is now alone.
Harry looks at the detonator in hand.
Harry You have three minutes and I'm not waiting.
Harry, all business now, situates himself next to the nuke. The
manual detonator
in his hand.
Harry Let's go, Sharp. Get the hell off this rock. I WILL push
this button.
The booster rockets SPUTTER and die.
Harry looks irritably at the SHUTTLE'S SPUTTERING THRUSTER.
Harry Sharp, you better get those engines goin'.
Harry is looking at the shuttle. Close-Up on finger ready to pull
the trigger.
Harry SHARP, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? GET THE HELL OUT OF
HERE!
Harry's eyes close as the clock counts -10...-11...-12.
Temple STAMPER DETONATE!
Shuttle Freedom lifts off the asteroid on full REVERSE THRUSTER
POWER, like a
Harrier jet. It ascends backwards, falling away
from the asteroid, away from
Earth, toward the Moon.
Harry is a solitary figure, left behind.
Harry takes his final breaths. Looks around.
Harry All right, son-of-a-bitch, it's just you and me....
Harry's FINGER compresses on the detonator button....
A GEYSER OF STEAM next to the drilling hole BLAT up to five feet
away. A SECOND
GEYSER, directly underneath Harry, BLOWS. The
MANUAL DETONATOR flies from
Harry's hand as he's knocked
backward --
-- into the drilling hole!
HARRY'S GLOVED HANDS grip the sides of the hole. Then his helmet
appears. He
looks across the asteroid surface to the MANUAL
DETONATOR, lying in the dirt.
The nuke has now descended several hundred feet into the hole.
Harry crawls out of the hole.
The nuke is at the bottom of the hole. Harry runs, gasping for
air, bounding
across the asteroid surface, dodging geysers and
rolling debris. He dives for
the detonator. He stares long and
hard. A TEAR wells in his eye. His finger
presses on the
detonator...sweat pours over his face....
Harry I beat you.
SLOW-MOTION CLOSE-UP on Harry's finger as it presses the
detonator.
The nuclear device DETONATES. A spectacular concussion. The
ASTEROID SPLITS in
two halves, as planned, like a split diamond.
The TWO BLOWN PIECES wing off into
space, on new vector angles
which might miss the Earth....
IN EXTREME SLOW MO, we see images around the world. WALL STREET
deserted....a
crowded BAR with people huddled around a
T.V....Extremely tight on a TEAR
falling form a woman's
face....ENGLISH FARMERS in a corn field.....a FATHER
holding his
SON as they watch the brilliant flaming sky....Golden closes his
eyes and falls to his seat....Arms raise in unison....PEOPLE
embrace....AT THE
PYRAMIDS, dappled in firelight, hundreds
praying....
Shuttle Freedom touches down. N.A.S.A. QUARANTINE VEHICLES race
out to meet it.
The EMERGENCY HATCH DOOR BLOWS in front of surprised N.A.S.A.
QUARANTINE
TECHNICIANS.
A.J., Chick and Bear walk away from the shuttle. All he N.A.S.A.
QUARANTINE
MEDICS are looking for them.
Chick What are you lookin' at?
Bear Yeah, okay, you're right, we're the studs who just blew up
the Death
Star.
A wave of fans are held back by MILITARY POLICE.
Sharp, holding his shoulder in pain, is helped across the tarmac
by Watts. A VET
BYSTANDER comes up to Sharp and drapes an
American flag over his shoulders.
Temple, with a huge grin, approaches Sharp. Temple salutes Sharp.
Among the masses, Chick catches sight of Denise. Tommy stands
next to her,
waving a small flag, proud as can be.
Grace runs toward A.J.; he sees her and runs to her.
They fall into each others arms. Grace is crying. A.J. is crying.
They kiss.
A.J. looks up at the sky.
A.J. He's up there, Grace. And he'll never die. Will you marry
me? I gotcha a
new rock....
A.J. pulls out one of the DIAMONDS from the asteroid surface, as
big as a
doorknob, about two thousand karats. It glitters in the
sunlight. Grace stares
at it, agog.
As we PULL BACK and CAMERA TILTS TO THE SKIES ABOVE.
Where Harry Stamper's soul remains.....
