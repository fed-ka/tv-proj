      EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AMERICAS - NIGHT   

      Steel and concrete vein connecting El Paso, Texas and Ciudad
      Juarez, Mexico.  The Rio Grande little more than a boxed in,
      trash strewn trickle on this moonless Bordertown night. 
      Past the gleaming lights of the two cities severed by the
      border wall lies a vast and unforgiving desert hiding secrets
      best left buried...  

      Tonight the CAMERA FINDS a black ESCALADE creeping across
      the bridge as WE PUSH IN. 

      INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

      The DRIVER a mere shadow behind the wheel.  We never see his
      face, just sense the whorl of his presence, a hand here,
      shirt collar.  He checks his watch and we see he's wearing
      surgical gloves.  We see what he sees -- the red border light
      flashing green as he pulls onto the center of the bridge, a
      cruddy, weathered sign:

      "WELCOME TO MEXICO/BIENVENIDOS A MEXICO"

      Now El Paso is in his rear view mirror, the messy heart's
      blood sprawl of Ciudad Juarez through his windshield, Murder
      City, ground zero for the narco war.  

      At this hour there are few cars on the bridge.  He checks
      his watch again and then it happens...

      EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AMERICAS -- NIGHT

      One by one the lights suddenly go out, PLUNGING the bridge
      into DARKNESS, save the sweep of a few motorists' headlights.

      INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT

      Our mysterious Driver kills his headlights, pulls to the
      side of the bridge and EXITS the car, moving with purpose...

                                      BORDER TECH #1
                          (Prelap)
                    Lights are out on the bridge...

      INT. BRIDGE OF THE AMERICA'S SURVEILLANCE ROOM -- NIGHT

      A pair of American BORDER TECHS hunched over computer monitors
      as alarms sound and their CAMERA FEEDS blink to static.

                                      BORDER TECH #2
                    Cameras too.  Hell's goin' on?                                                                                        2.

      His partner rises to check something --

                                      BORDER TECH #1
                      Auxiliary's down too.  Call the
                      Commander, we got a code three...

      As they spring into action we cut back to...

      EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AMERICA'S -- NIGHT

      QUICK HANDHELD SHOTS of our Driver pulling something from
      the trunk of the car, dragging it into the road.

      TIGHT ON his watch as he checks the time and then ducks away
      from the headlights of a car crossing on the other side of
      the bridge...  He scurries back to his car and takes off.

      INT. BRIDGE OF THE AMERICA'S SURVEILLANCE ROOM -- NIGHT

      Tech #2's talking frantically to his supervisor on the phone:

                                      BORDER TECH #2
                    ...It just happened.  Mexicans don't
                    know shit, water and power don't
                    know shit, everything's just black,
                    sir.

      Border Tech #1 leans into his screen and whattya know the
      lights begin to magically POP ON, the CAMERA FEEDS shudder
      back on line...  

                                      BORDER TECH #1
                    ... We've got juice!

                                      BORDER TECH #2
                          (into phone)
                    They just went back on -- how the
                    hell should I know...

      As he hunkers to check the VARIOUS CAMERAS winking back to
      life.  Tech #1 STOPS WHEN he sees a horrible sight...

                                      BORDER TECH #1
                    Holy shit.  Shut the border.  

      EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AMERICAS - NIGHT

      OVERHEAD SHOT of a WOMAN'S BODY resting smack in the middle
      of the bridge.  She's white, blond.  Her dead eyes stare up
      at the stars smeared in the sky... as we SMASH TO THE

      MAIN TITLES: THE BRIDGE.

                                    END OF TEASER                                                                                        3.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. STREET NEAR BRIDGE, CIUDAD JUAREZ -- NIGHT

      TIGHT ON a SHADOWY FIGURE watching the flashing lights of
      approaching police cars streaming onto the bridge from both
      the US and Mexican side of the border.  This is STEVEN LINDER,
      30's, white, a wolf of a man dressed in a too tight leather
      jacket, no stranger to the dark and jumbled chaos of Juarez. 
      He takes a drag on his cigarette.  He's been waiting for
      this night a long time.  And now here it is, moonless, alive
      with possibility... 

      A BEAT as he crushes the half smoked cigarette under his
      boot and then retrieves the stub, pockets it carefully. 
      This is a man who leaves no trace.  He takes one last look
      at the red and white flash of the police cruisers on the
      bridge and turns to a sudden gust of wind blowing in off the
      desert.  It's time...

      EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AMERICAS - NIGHT

      Both sides of the bridge are closed to traffic.  In the center
      we see a crush of Crime Techs, Border Patrol Agents and
      uniform officers from both sides of the border.  A car pulls
      up from the Mexican side.  Out steps a man.  This is Mexican
      State Homicide Investigator MARCO RUIZ, (40s) still rubbing
      the sleep from his eyes as he flashes his badge to the
      uniforms and swings under the crime tape.

      Marco finds El Paso homicide detective SONYA NORTH, (30s)
      unkempt hair blowing about her face, leather pants, calf
      boots...

      They meet over the body.  It is literally on the line that
      divides the U.S. and Mexico.  The head on Sonya's side, the
      feet on Marco's.  Sonya eyes Marco --

                                      SONYA
                    Who are you?

      A BEAT as Sonya stares at him.  She's there but not there, a
      distant ship on the horizon, not cold but something else... 
      However tonight she's focused on the body perfectly straddling
      the border.  Marco smiles warmly, fishes in his pocket and
      shows his BADGE, lightly accented English...

                                      MARCO
                    Marco Ruiz, State Police.

                                      SONYA
                    Sonya North, El Paso Homicide.                                                                                        4.

      He puts a hand out to shake but she just looks at him, lets
      him dangle.

                                      MARCO
                    Do you know who she is?

                                      SONYA
                          (nods)
                    She's American.

                                      MARCO
                    Okay.

                                      SONYA
                    Lorraine Cross, the judge.

      The name means nothing to him.  He has his own dead.

      A UNI crosses to Sonya...

                                    UNI
                    There's a gal asking to talk to the
                    cop in charge.

      They spot CHARLOTTE MILLWRIGHT, (40s) wealthy ranch wife --
      with the hair, clothes, all that --  straining against several
      officers.  Sonya stays on point with Marco --

                                      SONYA
                    She's American, the car came from El
                    Paso.  It's ours.

      Marco gestures -- it's all yours.  

      Sonya crosses to Charlotte who's frantic behind the crime
      scene tape.  Sonya fixes her with that faraway stare a beat... 

                                      SONYA (CONT'D)
                    Detective Sonya North.  You have
                      information?

                                      CHARLOTTE
                      Information?

                                      SONYA
                    On the crime.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                          (confused)
                    No.  We need to cross the bridge...

                                      SONYA
                    You'll have to wait.                                                                                        5.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    We can't wait, my husband's having a
                    heart attack... 

      She points to an AMBULANCE from Mexico, stopped on the Mexican
      side of the bridge --

                                      SONYA
                    This is a crime scene.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    We're American.  We need a hospital --

                                      SONYA
                    The bridge is closed.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    I can pay you.
                          (then)
                    To let us cross.

      She fishes out her fancy wallet from her fancy purse.  Sonya
      is blank.  Charlotte offers a clutch of BILLS --

                                      SONYA
                    No one crosses.

      Sonya turns her back on the woman, walks past Marco who has
      been watching all this with interest.  As Sonya returns to
      the body, Charlotte looks at Marco, eyes pleading...

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    Please.  

                                      MARCO
                    Why were you in Mexico?  Don't you
                    know the danger?

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    We were looking at some horses...

      Her tears take her over.  Marco watches as Charlotte runs
      back to the ambulance.  He waits a beat, ducks back under
      the crime scene tape and follows her, sees her get in the
      back with her unconscious husband, KARL (60s)...

      Marco crosses to the PARAMEDIC behind the wheel, motions for
      him to roll the window down... 

                                      MARCO
                     Qu  tiene?

                                      PARAMEDIC
                          (points to his heart)
                    El corazon...                                                                                        6.

                                      MARCO
                     Es muy grave?

      Off the Paramedic's nod, we CUT BACK TO:

      CENTER OF BRIDGE.  Sonya stands over the body, questioning
      SAMUELS, a BORDER AGENT who was on duty when the killer's
      Escalade crossed --

                                      SONYA
                    What kind of car?  

                                      SAMUELS
                    Don't know.

                                      SONYA
                    It's your job to know.

                                      SAMUELS
                    Our job is border security and
                      interdiction, not dead bodies, Ma'am. 

                                      SONYA
                    The car would have crossed over into
                    Juarez.

                                      SAMUELS
                    That makes it Mexico's problem.  

      Before she can continue the Ambulance starts moving, drives
      slowly past the body and crosses over into America --

                                      SONYA
                    Stop! 

      She chases after the ambulance, but it's too late.  She grabs
      one of the Unis who have just allowed the ambulance to pass.

                                      SONYA (CONT'D)
                    Who authorized that?

      Marco steps out of the crowd, faces a furious Sonya...

                                      MARCO
                    I did.  

                                      SONYA
                    You compromised my scene.

                                      MARCO
                    Her husband's very sick.

                                      SONYA
                    What's your name again?                                                                                        7.

                                      MARCO
                    Marco Ruiz.

                                      SONYA
                    Badge number?  

                                      MARCO
                    He needed a hospital.

                                      SONYA
                    There are hospitals in Mexico.

                                      MARCO
                    You ever been to one in Juarez?

                                      SONYA
                    Why does that matter?

                                      MARCO
                    Here.

      He holds his badge out for her to inspect again.  She takes
      down the number --

                                      SONYA
                    My body.  My scene.  You had no right.

                                      MARCO
                    I don't need your body.
                          (off look)
                    Just this morning I got nine heads
                    in the parking lot of City Hall...

                                      SONYA
                    Why tell me that?

                                      MARCO
                    We have our own dead.

      She studies him a beat.  Then:

                                      SONYA
                    How do you let that happen?  

      Judgmental, yes.  Like most other El Paso law enforcement,
      she thinks very little of the Mexican cops.  But her tone is
        matter-of-fact... she really doesn't understand.  

      Sonya moves off to the body again.  Marco shakes off the
      remark, crosses to his car where several other Juarez police
      officers stand waiting on his word.

                                      MARCO
                    Americans are taking it.  I'm going
                    back to sleep.                                                                                        8.

      As they disperse --

      EXT.  JUAREZ -- NIGHT

      CAMERA PANS across a dark mountainside where we can just
      make out the words "LEA LA BIBLIA - ES LA VERDAD" painted in
      massive white print as we...

      EXT.  JUAREZ -- NIGHT

      SWOOP into the city, past blocks of squat bunker-like houses
      behind high concrete walls topped with razor wire.  The walls
      of course tagged with petty street gang poetry.  A pack of
      wild dogs roam looking for trash, pause under a BRIGHT PINK
      CROSS standing in an abandoned lot, plastic flowers crucified
      over the name of one of the lost girls of Juarez as we...

      EXT. STREETS, JUAREZ -- NIGHT

      What passes for a nice neighborhood in Juarez, gaudy narco
      tecture houses with their golden domes, iron gates --
      monuments to the spoils of the drug war.

      CAMERA FINDS Linder as he crosses down a street filled with
      SUV'S parked outside night club.  The door opens briefly to
      reveal a few drunken SICARIOS (narco soldiers) parting to
      make way for EVA, (20s) a hot mess all jeweled and tarted
      up, the girlfriend of a narco.  Her two girlfriends follow
      her out.

      AS THE DOOR to the club opens we glimpse a BOY in a RED and
      BLACK SHIRT -- 18, a baby face, somehow different than the
      jaded narcos and clubbers he's hanging with.  The girls shut
      the door and he's gone, but remember him.

      And linger outside the club.  At first girl's chatter looks
      light, but with a closer look -- Eva is wiping tears.  As
      her make-up washes away, we also see BRUISES on her face.

      Linder presses himself into the shadows, watching Eva.  She
      kisses her friends goodbye, then slips away into the night...

      EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

      Linder follows her down an alley.  She hears his footsteps;
      turns and sees him.  He approaches, holding out a bandana. 
      In Spanish:

                                      LINDER
                    For your tears.

      Eva is frozen as he hands her the bandana.  She looks at it
      like it's some kind of signal... which it is.                                                                                           9.

                                    EVA
                    Are you the one... ?

      She starts to shake.

                                      LINDER
                    Yes.  I am the one.  Now come.  

      She stiffens as he grabs her elbow, leading her...

                                      LINDER (CONT'D)
                    Where is your car?

      A beat as she points to a Honda parked on an empty side
      street.  He pushes her across to the car.

                                      LINDER (CONT'D)
                    The keys.

      She fishes in her purse, hands him the keys.  Instead of
      opening the door, he pops the trunk.

                                    EVA
                    No.

                                      LINDER
                    Si.

      Eva hesitates, looks around.  The street is totally fucking
      empty, the din of the club faraway and faint...

                                    EVA
                    Por favor...

      She looks around -- she's gonna run.  Before she can, he
      GRABS HER and throws her in the trunk of the car.  Stifles
      her cry.  Takes her purse and then presses his face close to
      hers and puts a finger to his lips --

                                      LINDER
                    Shhh....

      He SLAMS THE TRUNK shut as we...

      EXT. BRIDGE OF THE AMERICAS -- NIGHT

      It's just Sonya now with the dead woman.  She kneels,
      finishing up her notes.  She motions to MORGUE ATTENDANTS --

                                      SONYA
                    I'm done.

      Two Morgue Attendants close in.  One grabs the shoulders,
      the other the feet...                                                                                        10.

      Sonya pulls out her cellphone to call her Lieutenant when
      she hears the morgue attendants react...

                                      MORGUE ATTENDANT
                    Shit... 

      She turns in time to see the dead woman's body CLEAVE IN
      TWO, perfectly vivisected.  She strides over and stares at
      the two halves -- what the fuck is going on?

      INT. UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER OF EL PASO -- NIGHT

      Charlotte hopping out of the ambulance as paramedics wheel
      her unconscious husband into an operating room, nurses working
      feverishly on his vitals, threading catheters, trying to
      stabilize him...  Charlotte peels away, sees a man standing
      there.  This is DR. BARNES and he's dressed in a jacket,
      string tie and boots -- not scrubs...

                                    DR. BARNES
                      Charlotte, I came as fast as I could --

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    Will you operate?

                                    DR. BARNES
                    I was at a wedding.  Had too much to
                    drink...
                          (off look)
                    Doctor McGrann will do the bypass.  

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    You're his doctor.

                                    DR. BARNES
                    I'll be here to consult.  It's a
                    routine procedure...

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    I'll pay you.

                                    DR. BARNES
                    Come on now...

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    I'll fund that heart clinic you've
                    been lobbying the board of directors
                    for.  We'll build a whole new wing --

      She stops as several nurses come RUSHING out of the room. 
      She reads the doctor's face -- this is not good.                                                                                         11.

      INT. EL PASO PD, ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

      ...Catch LT. HANK WADE (50s) possessing a weathered cowboy
      swagger even at this hour as he ENTERS the HQ, talking with
      Sonya on his cell.  INTERCUT WITH SONYA DRIVING AS NEEDED.

                                    HANK
                    You sure it's Judge Cross?

                                      SONYA
                    In two pieces.

                                    HANK
                    Well damn.

      INT. SONYA'S TRUCK (MOVING) -- NIGHT

      Sonya driving fast as she talks to Hank...

                                      SONYA
                    The Mexicans didn't want the body.

      Hank shrugs, not surprised.

                                    HANK
                    The Feds?

                                      SONYA
                    They don't know yet.

      INT. EL PASO PD, BULLPEN -- NIGHT

      Hank moves into the nearly empty bullpen, phone pressed to
      his ear.  He goes to the coffee maker, entirely befuddled by
      it.  Presses a few buttons here and there -- 

                                    HANK 
                          (into phone)
                    They will.  Morning light will bring
                    those boys, Border Patrol, DEA, ICE. 
                      Everybody'll wanna piece of this.

                                      SONYA
                    It's mine.

                                    HANK
                    How do you work this damn thing?

                                      SONYA
                    What?

      He means the coffee pot.  Starts striding through the halls,
      looking for someone to help him --                                                                                        12.

                                    HANK
                    Lorraine Cross on the Bridge of the
                    Americas.  Someone's sending a
                    message.

                                      SONYA
                    What do you mean?  What is the
                    message?

                                    HANK
                    She's an anti-immigration nut. 
                    Believes in the wall, anti-Dream
                    Act, all that.

      He spots KITTY, middle-aged civilian clerk, working her curves
      and orange lipstick, just arriving for work.  He signals for
      her to follow him.  She does, back to the coffee pot --

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    Have you told the family?

                                      SONYA
                    I'm on my way now.

                                    HANK
                    It's the middle of the night, Sonya. 
                    There are children there. 

                                      SONYA
                    I know.

                                    HANK
                    Tread lightly.

                                      SONYA
                    Their mother was murdered.  There is
                    no other way to say it.

                                    HANK
                    Why don't I join you?

                                      SONYA
                    Hank.  No.  

      She hangs up.  He does too, sighing.  Kitty's waiting
      patiently.  He points to the coffee maker --

                                      KITTY
                    Good morning, Lieutenant.

                                    HANK
                    Do you know how to do this?                                                                                        13.

                                      KITTY
                          (shakes head)
                    I just go to Starbucks.  

                                    HANK
                    Aw damn. 

      Off which --

      EXT. JUDGE CROSS'S HOUSE, WEST SIDE EL PASO -- NIGHT

      Nice neighborhood in the foothills of the Franklin mountains.
      The CAMERA PUSHES PAST a child's bike abandoned in the front
      yard to find a light in the living room as we PRELAP MIKE
      CROSS'S VOICE:

                                    MIKE
                          (prelap)
                    She was on her way to a conference
                    in Austin...

      INT. JUDGE CROSS'S HOUSE, WEST SIDE EL PASO -- NIGHT

      Sonya with Judge Cross's husband, MIKE (40s) numb with grief
      and the shock of what she has just told him.  Sonya remains
      unmoved.  She has not tread lightly.

                                      SONYA
                    Flying?

                                    MIKE
                    She drove.  I called her before I
                    went to bed...

                                      SONYA
                    What time?

                                    MIKE
                    Eleven, but she didn't answer.

                                      SONYA
                    She was dead by then.  I'll need
                    your phone.  And computer...

                                    MIKE
                    Right now?

      She nods.  He hands her the phone, too lost in grief to
      protest --

                                      SONYA
                    Why didn't she fly?

                                    MIKE
                    She liked to drive.                                                                                        14.

      She thinks for a beat --

                                      SONYA
                    Maybe an affair.
                          (off look)
                    People have needs.  

                                    MIKE
                    There was no affair.

                                      SONYA
                    Well you wouldn't know.  She would
                    keep it secret.  You have secrets.

      It's matter-of-fact, not cruel.  At least not intended to be
      cruel.  But of course Mike is reeling --

                                      SONYA (CONT'D)
                    Were there any recent threats?

                                    MIKE
                    She put a lot of bad people away...

                                      SONYA
                    So, yes?

                                    MIKE
                    Nothing lately. 

                                      SONYA
                    What was the conference she was going
                    to? 

                                    MIKE
                    Secure Our Border.  

                                      SONYA
                    Secure it from what?

                                    MIKE
                    Spillover violence.  Illegals.  She
                    was the keynote speaker.

      Sonya stares at him, considering this.  Then --

                                      SONYA
                    Did she use drugs?

                                    MIKE
                    Drugs?  Lorraine?  She was a mother
                    for christ sake.

      Sonya waits, blank.  He's had it.                                                                                        15.

                                    MIKE (CONT'D)
                    I'd like you to leave now.

      Off this --

      EXT. MARCO RUIZ'S HOUSE, JUAREZ -- NIGHT

      Marco pulls through the gate in his crappy Taurus.  Pauses
      to make sure the gate shuts behind him.  He looks up at his
      house, sees a light on the basement, frowns...

      INT. MARCO RUIZ'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

      He enters, the cozy mess of a house full of children,
      navigating in the half dark toward the basement door.

      INT. RUIZ HOUSE, BASEMENT -- NIGHT

      Marco pauses outside a door, listening.  He knocks -- no
      answer and then ENTERS.

      Sitting in front of a Playstation is an 18-year-old in a
      BLACK AND RED SHIRT -- same kid we glimpsed at that club. 
      He turns -- yup, same baby face.  This is Marco's oldest
      son, AGUSTINE, GUS for short.  Headphones on, deeply absorbed
      in Call of Duty, his character stalking a digital Cuba in
      search of Castro.  

      Marco watches his son maneuver, killing without pause.  Life
      here means nothing.

                                      MARCO
                    Gus?

      No answer.  He taps him --

                                    GUS
                    What?

      He takes off the headphones.

                                      MARCO
                    I can smell it.

                                    GUS
                    What?

                                      MARCO
                    The dope.

      No response --

                    Where'd you get it?                                                                                        16.

                                    GUS
                    Tico at school.

                                      MARCO
                    You know who Tico's uncle is?
                          (off look)
                    Aurelio Guetta, soldier for the Zetas. 
                    That's where your dope comes from.

                                    GUS
                    It was just a joint.

                                      MARCO
                    And now you owe him.  Maybe his uncle
                    wants you to make a delivery for
                    him.  Drive him someplace.

                                    GUS
                    That's not how it is --

                                      MARCO
                    That is how it is.  That's how you
                    get caught up.  These narcos will
                    reach out and grab you like that. 

      He snaps his fingers.

                                    GUS
                    Fine.

      He puts on his headphones, tuning Marco out.

                                      MARCO
                    You go across for classes, you come
                    right back.  No parties, no Tico.

      Gus doesn't respond.  Doesn't even look at his dad.  Marco
      moves out --

      INT. RUIZ HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

      Marco ENTERS and sees his wife ALMA (30s), beautiful and
      bathed in the blue glow of the alarm clock next to the bed.  

      He undresses, sets his gun and phone on the nightstand. 

      A BEAT as he pulls his pants off and winces as he moves slowly
      to the bed, pulls the covers back only to find one of his
      daughter's stuffed bears on his pillow.  He smiles, sets the
      bear on the floor and a big breath as he crawls into bed,
      obviously in pain, but from what?

                                    ALMA
                    Were you on the bridge?                                                                                        17.

                                      MARCO
                    Yes.

                                    ALMA
                    What happened?

                                      MARCO
                    A body.  The Americans took it.

                                    ALMA
                    Did you check on Gus?

                                      MARCO
                    Yes.

                                    ALMA
                    Is he asleep?

                                      MARCO
                    Yes.

                                    ALMA
                    He didn't come home til ten.

                                      MARCO
                    Maybe he had a night class.

                                    ALMA
                    He didn't.

                                      MARCO
                    I'll talk to him.

                                    ALMA
                    Maybe he should stay in El Paso. 
                    With my sister.

                                      MARCO
                    I like him here.

      Marco rolls away, lets out a pained gasp.  

                                    ALMA
                    Does it hurt?

                                      MARCO
                    Yes...

      Marco stares at the ceiling having one of those moments...

      INT. EL PASO MORGUE - NIGHT

      Sonya enters the morgue to find Judge Cross's body inhabiting
      two slabs -- one for her torso, the other for her legs. 
      MONITORS on the wall display photos of the wounds.                                                                                          18.

      Gory but Sonya seems not to notice.  Nor does M.E. CHIP
      RODRIGUEZ (30s), smiles like he's got a secret, like he's
      smarter than most...  

                                    CHIP
                    You're going to like this.

      She looks at him.  Doesn't engage in the playfulness.

                                      SONYA
                    Cause of death?

      He shrugs, points to a photo of a nasty puncture wound at
      the base of the victim's skull.

                                    CHIP
                    Some heavy gauge needle.  Entered
                    the base of the spine, then the brain
                    cavity where it wiped out motor
                    function.  Quick, neat and almost
                    painless.

      A beat as Sonya studies the entry wound.

                                    CHIP (CONT'D)
                    But even better...

      Chip holds out surgical gloves.  Sonya snaps them on and
      pulls back the sheet to reveal the severed torso in all it's
      grisly glory.  She studies the torso, probes the puncture
      wound, the crosscut abdomen as Chip watches, waiting for her
      to puzzle it out.

                                      SONYA
                    No petechial hemorrhaging.

      She palpates the skin, notes an INCISION at the neck artery...

                                      SONYA (CONT'D)
                    She was bled out and then cut in
                    half...

                                    CHIP
                    Probably made the bisection less
                    messy. 
                          (then)
                    And the other half?

      Sonya crosses to the other slab, pulls back the sheet on the
      lower half of the body.

                                      SONYA
                    The lower half is much darker...

      Chip nods.  Sonya notes what looks like a burn on the thigh.                                                                                        19.

                                      SONYA (CONT'D)
                    ... Is this frostbite?

                                    CHIP
                    Freezer burn.  Post mortem.
                          (off look)
                    For at least a year.

                                      SONYA
                    That's impossible.

                                    CHIP
                    The legs don't belong to Lorraine
                    Cross. 
                          (then)
                    This victim is a Hispanic female. 
                    I'm guessing late teens to early
                    twenties.

      Sonya snaps the gloves off.  WTF is going on?

                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                        20.

      FADE IN:

      EXT. ZAROGOSA BRIDGE, US/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT

      We see Linder driving across the bridge in Eva's Honda. 
      Faint WHIMPERS from the trunk.  He passes under a sign
      welcoming him to the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  There's barely
      any traffic at this hour and only two inspection lanes are
      open.  He chooses one, pulls to the gate arm only to have a
      BORDER AGENT wave him up for a little chat. 

      That's when he notices Eva's PURSE on the seat next to him
      and quickly shoves it under the seat, masking his movement
      by turning the radio up.

                                      BORDER AGENT
                    Passport?

      Linder reaches into his pocket, hands him the passport.  

                                      BORDER AGENT (CONT'D)
                    How long were you in Mexico?

                                      LINDER
                    Three hours.

                                      BORDER AGENT
                    What did you bring back from Mexico?

                                      LINDER
                    Just a smile, officer...

      The guy looks at him.  Stops with the rote questioning --

                                      BORDER AGENT
                    What were ya doin' in Juarez?

                                      LINDER
                    Seeing a friend.

      The Border Agent smells bullshit --

                                      BORDER AGENT
                    I got a friend in Juarez.  Haven't
                    visited him in six years.  Not worth
                    the risk...

      Linder looks at him, sheepish.  Confiding --

                                      LINDER
                    Okay.  I went over for the Senoritas.                                                                                        21.

      The Border Agent gives him a conspiratorial smile -- the man
      had a need.

                                      BORDER AGENT
                    Anything good?

                                      LINDER
                      Definetely worth the visit.

      The agent grins, hands the passport back...

                                      BORDER AGENT
                    Have a good night.

      He signals Linder through into America with his secret cargo,
      radio masking her trapped whimpers as we...

      INT. UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER OF EL PASO -- NIGHT

      TIGHT ON Charlotte pacing in the purgatory of a hospital
      waiting room, plastic flowers in a plastic vase, ancient
      Time Magazines, the blur of nurses, the old man combing the
      Bible for answers.  

      DR. Barnes ENTERS with a SURGEON in scrubs behind him.  They
      have that 1,000 yard stare, the bearers of bad news...

                                    DR. BARNES
                      Charlotte.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    How is he?

      Dr. Barnes shakes his head.  She stares.  Then pure animal
      grief as she knows.  Her husband is dead.  Gone.

      INT. RUIZ HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

      Marco's cellphone BUZZES on the night stand.  He reaches
      out, SILENCES it.  It immediately buzzes again.  He answers. 
      INTERCUT WITH SONYA IN THE MORGUE.

                                      MARCO
                    Si.  Yes...

                    The one in charge, I remember.

      His crack met with silence, then...

                                      SONYA
                    Were you sleeping?

                                      MARCO
                    I do that at night.

                                      SONYA
                    There were two women on the bridge.

                                      MARCO
                    You found another one?

                                      SONYA
                    No.  The victim was two bodies.  An
                    upper half and lower half.  Two
                    different women.

                                      MARCO
                      Chingame...

                                      SONYA
                    Have you found half a body in Juarez?
                          (then)
                    Hispanic, late teens to twenty. 
                    You'd have the top half.

      Marco sits up in bed, groans with pain.

                                      SONYA (CONT'D)
                    Something wrong?

                                      MARCO
                    No.  I'm listening.  Cut in half? 

                                      SONYA
                    Yes.  Do you have a girl matching
                    this description?

                                      MARCO
                    I don't know.  We have lots of bodies,
                    parts of bodies, bones...  

                                      SONYA
                    It could be a year old.  The legs
                    were frozen.  Can you look into it?                                                                                        23.

                                      MARCO
                    Yeah.  I'll check in the morning.

                                      SONYA
                    Who can I call to look into it now?

      Marco pulls the phone away from his ear -- later is not an
      option for this woman.

                                      MARCO
                    I'll do it.  I'll call you back.

                                      SONYA
                    When?

      CLICK.  Marco hangs up.  Sonya stares at the phone...

      INT. RUIZ HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

      Marco drags himself out of bed clumsily.  Alma watches...

                                    ALMA
                    What is it?

                                      MARCO
                    This El Paso detective.  I can't
                    tell if she's crazy or just American.

                                    ALMA
                    Maybe both.

      He leans over and kisses Alma.

                                      MARCO
                    I'll be back.

      EXT. JUAREZ POLICE STATION -- NIGHT

      Marco exiting his car, gingerly, enters the building...

      INT. JUAREZ POLICE STATION, FILE ROOM -- NIGHT

      Marco sits with CELIA (30s), plump, mischievous eyes.  Got
      dragged out of bed to help Marco, but he's lucky.  She likes
      him.  Maybe they even had an affair...

                                      CELIA
                    Missing female, fifteen to twenty
                    years old?  We get five of those a
                    week, Marco.  

                                      MARCO
                    I know.  Go back a year.  Only the
                    ones with partial remains.                                                                                        24.

                                      CELIA
                    We talking top half, or bottom?

                                      MARCO
                    Top.  The Americans found the legs.

      As Celia feeds this into the database.  Then waiting --

                                      CELIA
                    Things okay at home?

                                      MARCO
                    Fine.  You?

                                      CELIA
                    Same.

                                      MARCO
                    That's good.

      Some unspoken thing between them.  Playful --

                                      CELIA
                    So you'll be firing blanks, now?

      A beat as Marco shoots her a look.

                                      MARCO
                    Was my procedure in the bureau
                    minutes?

                                      CELIA
                          (ball busting smile)
                    Is everything working?

                                      MARCO
                    It will be.

                                      CELIA
                    And that's it?  Now you're fixed?

                                      MARCO
                    What do you mean?

                                      CELIA
                    You heard about the castrated toms?  
                          (off look)
                    Tomcats.

                                      MARCO
                    No...

                                      CELIA
                    My brother's a vet.  
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        25.

                                      CELIA (CONT'D)
                    He says the first thing that happens
                    is they gain weight, then they sleep
                    all day.
                          (snaps her fingers)
                    A wild predator turns into a fat
                    sleepy pussy just like that...

                                      MARCO
                    They're castrated.  That's not the
                    same thing.

      Celia looks at him, clearly enjoying this, part flirtation,
      part payback.  

                                      CELIA
                    Okay...

      Celia punches a button, sorting the search results.  Turns
      to him with a tart smile. 

                                      CELIA (CONT'D)
                    You got lucky tonight.
                          (points to screen)
                    Cristina Fuentes.

      The photo of CRISTINA FUENTES, 16, dark hair and dark eyes
      stares at us.  Off Marco as we... 

      EXT. STREET, JUAREZ -- NIGHT 

      Marco pulls up to a massive, gaudy house, domed roof, ornate
      stone work, polished gold lions, crossed guns over bandoliers,
      and the visage of Jesus Malverde adorn the high brick wall
      surrounding the property.  Behind the walls we can see and
      hear a party going full tilt, the rhythmic oompah pa of a
      narcorrido reverberating. 

      All along the street are pimped out SUV's with bullet proof 
      glass, rims, BODYGUARD & DRIVERS sit waiting in the vehicles.

      Marco pulls up and exits his car (a tin can compared to all
      the vehicles around him).  He crosses to one of the SUV's
      and knocks.  The window rolls down to reveal HUGO (30s) an
      off duty cop.  A flash of disappointment in Marco's eyes -- 

      THE FOLLOWING IN SPANISH, SUBTITLED...

                                      MARCO
                    You too, Hugo?

      Hugo's thrown, then defensive --

                                    HUGO
                    You come here to judge?                                                                                        26.

                                      MARCO
                    I need to see the Captain.

                                    HUGO
                    He's not here.

                                      MARCO
                    I need to see him, so pick up that
                    radio. 

      A beat as Hugo grabs a two-way off the seat, says something
      we can't hear.

      A second later the large wrought iron gate rolls open.  Hugo,
      trying to explain himself as Marco heads into the house --

                                    HUGO
                    Natalie's pregnant again. 

                                      MARCO
                    Mm hm.

                                    HUGO
                    We need the money...

      Marco just keeps going --

      EXT.  GALVAN'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

      Marco enters a courtyard strung with paper lanterns, littered
      with party goers, some paired off with senoritas in skimpy
      dresses and stripper heels, others sitting and watching
      Narcoriddo band sing the glories of a bloody showdown through
      the dope and cigar smoke.  We see flashes of gang tattoos,
      gaudy jewelry, a nickel plated nine dangling from a holsters
      under five thousand dollar suits.

      On either side of the courtyard stand two large cages.  Inside
      one cage is a motherfucking LION and in the other a PANTHER. 

      The men all stop to note Marco's entrance, making him
      instantly for a cop.  Marco gives it right back.

      As he passes the caged panther he stops to watch a drunk
      narco SOLDIER blow dope smoke into the cage.  The panther
      hisses, backs into the corner of the cage.  If not for the
      bars...

                                      MARCO
                          (Spanish)
                    You're making a dangerous enemy.

      The SOLDIER eye fucks Marco, lifts his guayabera to reveal a
      gun.  Marco holds his gaze and then pushes past into the
      house.                                                                                        27.

      INT.  GALVAN'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

      Dark wood paneled room.  Several men sit playing cards. 
      Among them CAPTAIN ROBLES (40s) drunk.  FAUSTO GALVAN (40s)
      dark black suit, long black braided ponytail slinking down
      his back and a diamond encrusted Movado.  He's flanked by
      two of his men.

      Fausto gives his back to Marco.  Fausto is the presence and
      menace in the room, all the men, even Captain Robles watch
      him, equal parts awe and fear.

      A BEAT as Marco studies Fausto, notes the flashy watch.  Not
      exactly the best of company for his police captain to be
      keeping. 

      IN SPANISH, SUBTITLED...

                                      CAPTAIN ROBLES
                    Marco...

                                      MARCO
                    Sorry to bother you.

                                      CAPTAIN ROBLES
                    Isn't it past your bed time?  

      The men laugh, Marco just smiles.  No need for him to make
      dangerous enemies.  He sees but doesn't see what's going on.

                                      CAPTAIN ROBLES (CONT'D)
                    What's so important that you interrupt
                    our card game?

                                      MARCO
                    There were two bodies on the bridge.

                                      CAPTAIN ROBLES
                    Two now?

                                      MARCO
                    One is from Juarez.

                                      CAPTAIN ROBLES
                    Let the Americans take it.
                          (off look)
                    Sit down have a drink, play some
                    cards with us.

                                      MARCO
                    I'm not here to play cards.  I need
                    your permission to work the case. 
                    That's procedure, right?                                                                                        28.

                                      FAUSTO
                    Bet's to you, Captain...

      Fausto pushes a stack of chips to the center of the table,
      turns and stares at Marco a long time, taking his measure.

                                      FAUSTO (CONT'D)
                    He's dedicated.  It's a good thing
                    to have men like that...

                                      CAPTAIN ROBLES
                          (to Marco)
                    Go on.

      Off Marco as we...

      INT. EL PASO PD - CRIMES AGAINST PERSONS (CAP) -- NIGHT

      Sonya pacing as she discusses the case with her boss, Hank --

                                    HANK
                    New Mexico or Arizona have any missing
                    girls?

                                      SONYA
                    Nothing that matches our half.  

                                    HANK
                    Sheriff's boys are looking for the
                    Judge's BMW.  I guess by daylight it
                    turns up.

                                      SONYA
                    And by daylight the FBI's gonna be
                    here, trying to take my case.

                                    HANK
                    You're going to have a task force
                      situation, Sonya. 

                                      SONYA
                    Well, I want to lead it.

                                    HANK
                    You sure about that?  'Cause a case
                    like this can change you.  Scratch
                    your soul.  Invade your dreams...

                                      SONYA
                    I don't dream.

      Sonya's cell rings.  She looks at the number, puzzled, and
      then answers.                                                                                        29.

      INTERCUT WITH:

      INT. MARCO'S CAR -- NIGHT

      Marco pulled over to the side of the road, reading from a
      file, downloading Sonya...

                                      MARCO
                    Cristina Fuentes, sixteen.  Went
                    missing from a maquiladora.
                          (then)
                    She got on the bus in the morning,
                    never came home.  Partial remains
                      discovered in a death house.

                                      SONYA
                    Death house?

                                      MARCO
                    Abandoned house where the Sicarios
                    dump bodies.  They fill one up, find
                    another.

                                      SONYA
                    When was she found?

      Hank sips coffee, watches Sonya as she talks --

                                      MARCO
                    A year and a half ago.  It fits.

                                      SONYA
                    Can you send the file?

                                      MARCO
                    It's better if I come to you.  She's
                    one of the dead girls of Juarez.  
                          (then)
                    Give me half an hour.  

                                      SONYA
                    It's not necessary.  It's my case --

      He hangs up before she can say another word, drops the car
      into drive and heads north towards the gleam of El Paso.

      STAY WITH Sonya, still with the phone to her ear...

                                      SONYA (CONT'D)
                    Hello?
                          (to Hank)
                    He's coming here.                                                                                        30.

                                    HANK
                    Good.

                                      SONYA
                    Why is that good?

                                    HANK
                    He's got a body too, right?  

                                      SONYA
                    He doesn't care about his.

                                    HANK
                          (checks watch)
                    He called you at 4 a.m. with her
                    name.   

                                      SONYA
                    Right.  Fine.

                                    HANK
                    We have two bodies placed directly
                    on an international border.  This
                    case is gonna take us down south. 
                    And last I checked that badge on
                    your hip don't mean shit in Juarez.

      Sonya smells her armpit, then reaches into her desk drawer
      and pulls out a fresh shirt.  

      Hank has seen this before; he looks away as she pulls her
      shirt off, oblivious to her state of undress, and slides the
      fresh one on -- 

      EXT. EAST EL PASO -- NIGHT

      Past the sprawl of El Paso into the hard pan desert of the
      foothills we see a car snaking up a washed out road,
      headlights illuminating jack rabbits, moths, the occasional
      trailer surrounded by broken down trucks and cars.

      It's the Honda.  Linder driving.  He stops at a metal bar
      gate.  Exits the car, unlocks the gate.  Looks around and
      gets back in the car.

      The road snakes behind a mesa and in the sweep of the
      headlight beam stands a small white TRAILER.

      He pulls to the trailer, parks and opens the trunk to reveal
      Eva freaked the fuck out.  She jumps out and starts to run. 
      Linder quietly reaches in and KILLS THE HEADLIGHTS plunging
      the place into darkness.  Instead of chasing after he simply
      watches her stumbling over rocks, falling...                                                                                        31.

                                      LINDER
                    Watch for rattle snakes.  They come
                    out at night.

      She falls and doesn't rise...

                                      LINDER (CONT'D)
                    Scream if you have to.  There's nobody
                    for miles.

                                    EVA
                      Ayudame...

      She crumples to the ground, crying.  He goes to her.  Slings
      her over his shoulder and crosses to the trailer, opens it
      and flicks a light on...

      INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

      Linder sets Eva down on a mattress with clean sheets, sees
      that she's scraped her knee. 

                                      LINDER
                    You've hurt yourself.

                                    EVA
                    Donde estamos?

                                      LINDER
                    A safe place.

      Linder finds a First Aid Kit, takes out some iodine and gently
      cleans the wound.  Eva recoils at his touch.  Linder fixes
      her with his unblinking gaze...

                                      LINDER (CONT'D)
                    Hold still, please.

      He dabs the wound clean, presses a bandage to it and then
      rises.

                                      LINDER (CONT'D)
                    You must be tired.  Duermes tu.

      Eva pushes herself back on the bed, away from him.   

                                      LINDER (CONT'D)
                    I'll be back.

      He steps out of the trailer.  We stay with Eva as she hears
      Linder throw a LATCH and snap a PADLOCK over it. 

      She runs to the door, tries to open it.  No way out.  As she
      panics, screams again --                                                                                        32.

      FADE IN:

      INT. UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER OF EL PASO -- NIGHT

      Charlotte looking out the hospital window, black mountains,
      her own numb reflection -- and when she turns, the still
      figure of her husband, Karl lying dead behind her.   

      She crosses to him, touches his cold arm and recoils.  This
      is not her husband.  She pulls at the WEDDING BAND on his
      finger.  She can't get it off.

      A NURSE enters...

                                      NURSE
                    Would you like more time?

      Charlotte turns, disoriented.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    No.

      The nurse hands Charlotte a pamphlet. 

                                      NURSE
                    The hospital provides non-
                      denominational grief counseling.

      Charlotte waves away the pamphlet.  Then:

                                      CHARLOTTE
                      I don't... know how to do this.

                                      NURSE
                    Of course not.

      Charlotte turns back to Karl, tugs at the wedding ring again. 
      The nurse offers some Vaseline.  Together they accomplish
      the task; off comes the ring.  Charlotte grips it tight.  

                                      NURSE (CONT'D)
                    Is there someone I can call?

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    Me.  I'm the person to call.  His
                    wife.

                                      NURSE
                    Do you have children?

                                      CHARLOTTE
                      A daughter.  She's not...
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        34.

                                      CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                          (tries to recover)
                    So, what happens now?

                                      NURSE
                    Someone from the hospital will contact
                    you about a funeral home.  

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    I... leave him here?

      The nurse nods.  Hands her a PLASTIC BAG from a table.

                                      NURSE
                    Your husband's clothes and personal
                    items.  

      Charlotte clutches the bag.  Takes one last look at her
      husband and walks past the nurse --

      INT. EL PASO PD - ENTRANCE - DAWN

      Marco waits, holding a bakery bag, case file tucked under
      his other arm.  A Clerk ignoring him.  Sonya joins him from
      behind secure double doors.

                                      SONYA
                    Email would have been quicker.

                                      MARCO
                    But not as pleasant.  I brought some
                      breakfast...

      He offers her the bakery bag --

                                      SONYA
                    Where's the file?

      He hands her the case file and she opens it, walking briskly
      back to the doors, only to stop when she sees that he's
      following her --

                                      SONYA (CONT'D)
                    Where are you going?

                                      MARCO
                    With you.

                                      SONYA
                    Why?

                                      MARCO
                    You've got my file.

      Sonya faces the inevitable --                                                                                        35.

                                      SONYA
                    My boss says there's gonna be a task
                    force.

                                      MARCO
                    Probably.  

                                      SONYA
                    And you want to be on it?

                                      MARCO
                    Cristina Fuentes was found six blocks
                    from my house.  She went to the school
                    my girls will go to. 
                          (then)
                    Of course I do.

      Sonya indicates to the clerk that it's okay; waves Marco
      through.  He follows her --

      INT. EL PASO PD -- CAP -- CONTINUOUS

      Marco follows Sonya into their offices.  A sign indicates
      "CRIMES AGAINST PERSONS" --

                                      SONYA
                    This is CAP.  Crimes Against Persons. 
                    We do homicides.  

      They find bulldog Kitty behind her desk --

                                      MARCO
                    Good morning...

                    Kitty.

                                      SONYA
                    He needs a day pass.

      Sonya moves over to her desk.  Marco lingers with Kitty who
      takes an instant shine to him --

                                      MARCO
                    It might be more than a day.

                                      KITTY
                    And who are you, Hon?

      He badges her --

                                      KITTY
                    That ought to be interesting.  

                                      MARCO
                    Why is that?

                                      KITTY
                      Sonya's... on the odd side.

                                      MARCO
                      I noticed.  Would you like a pan
                    dulce?

      He opens the bakery bag.

                                      MARCO (CONT'D)
                    The ones with walnuts are good...

      She smiles, takes one, can't help but be charmed.

                                      KITTY
                    I do like those Mexican pastries. 
                    Here ya go...

      She hands him a PD pass -- throws some flirt, winks. 

                                      MARCO
                    See you later Kitty.

                                      KITTY
                    Hope so.

      Marco finds Sonya at her desk sitting and staring into space,
      the file in front of her.

      AS BEAT as she sees him.

                                      SONYA
                    May we begin?

                    Yes...

      Sonya opens the file and is instantly absorbed as Marco PACES
      uncomfortably.  She looks up --

                                      SONYA
                    Did you get the pass?

      He shows it to her.  She goes back to the file.  He continues
      to pace, annoying her.

                    Actually I can't.

                    You're irritating me.

                                      MARCO
                    I'll stand still.

                    Why can't you sit?

                          (off look)
                    You have children?

                                      SONYA
                    No.  Why would I want to?

                                      MARCO
                    I've never heard anyone say that.

                                      SONYA
                    More people should.
                          (re: the case)
                    Evidence was collected, but never
                      processed. 

                                      MARCO
                    Yes.                                                                                        38.

      Marco paces.  Sonya can't stand it.

                                      SONYA
                    You drove here, right?
                          (off nod)
                    Pretend that chair is a car.

                                      MARCO
                    Okay, I'll try.

      Marco eases himself into a chair with considerable pain.

                                      SONYA
                    Much better.
                          (off look)
                    How was she killed?

                                      MARCO
                    I don't know.

                                      SONYA
                    Your name is on this report. 

                                      MARCO
                    My name is on a lot of reports.

                                      SONYA
                    There are no interviews.  Not even
                    with her parents.  

                                      MARCO
                    There's a saying we have in Juarez. 
                    Desde el plato a la boca, la sopa se
                    cae.
                          (then)
                    From the bowl to the mouth, the soup
                    falls.

                                      SONYA
                    What does that have to do with the
                    case?

                                      MARCO
                    Cristina Fuentes was one of two
                    hundred and fifty girls who
                      disappeared last year.  They go
                    missing from the buses, the factories. 
                    Always 15 to twenty years old, dark
                    hair, beautiful.  

                                      SONYA
                    So you have a serial killer.

                                      MARCO
                    No one knows.                                                                                        39.

                                      SONYA
                    And no one cares?

                                      MARCO
                    There are so many bodies.  And the
                    chiefs... don't really want us to
                      investigate.

      Sonya stares; understands this not at all.  Hank comes from
      his office.  Shaking hands --

                                    HANK
                    Morning.  Lieutenant Wade.

                                      MARCO
                    Mucho gusto.  Marco Ruiz.

                                      SONYA
                    His name is on the report for Cristina
                    Fuentes.  But he didn't investigate
                    at all.

      Marco, piqued, starts to say something; but stops himself. 
      Hank observes this; gives him a break --

                                    HANK
                    Well now he's got a second chance. 
                    Sheriff's Department found Judge
                    Cross' car.

                                      SONYA
                    Where?

                                    HANK
                      Interstate 10, outside of Van Horn.

      Sonya grabs her keys, heads out --

                                      MARCO
                    I guess she's driving.

                                    HANK
                    Little piece of advice.
                          (off look)
                    Buckle up, amigo...

      Marco follows her out --

      EXT. MILLWRIGHT RANCH, OUTSIDE OF EL PASO - MORNING

      A town car drives Charlotte through the gates of her sprawling
      ranch, down a drive lined with live oaks, the fields green
      and full of shimmering quarter horses...                                                                                           40.

      EXT. MILLWRIGHT RANCH -- MORNING

      Charlotte looks out the window as the car continues up to
      the main house, a testament to old Texas money and the rewards
      of being a gentleman rancher.

      The car stops.  Charlotte alights, and sees CESAR (50s) the
      ranch caretaker and her late husband's right hand man waiting
      for her.

      He removes his hat, pokes a tear from his cheek --

                                      CESAR
                    I heard about Senor Karl...

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    Have you told the rest of the staff?

      Cesar nods.

                                      CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                    Good.  I don't want to be disturbed.

                                      CESAR
                    Si.

      Charlotte grabs the plastic bag of her husband's clothes and
      enters the house...

      INT. MILLWRIGHT HOUSE, BEDROOM - MORNING

      Charlotte searching her drawers, finally finds that pack of
      cigarettes she's stashed.  She pulls one out, lights it and
      stands at the window looking out at the field of horses
      cantering in a nearby paddock. 

      On a desk in the corner are dozens of photos of her and Karl
      standing at horse shows, vacations in far flung places -- a
      life together in carefully framed photos.  She sweeps her
      arm across the desk, sending the photos crashing.

      She slumps into a chair, takes another drag of the cigarette
      and lets the tears come...

      A BEAT as she spots her husband's clothes in the bag.  She
      rises and dumps them out on the bed -- wallet, some loose
      change, watch and TWO CELLPHONES.  She opens one phone and
      sees on the home screen a photo of the two them on the ranch. 
      But the other cell phone is locked -- a security code
      required.  Why would her husband have two cell phones?

      Suspicious, she does a thorough search of his wallet -- the
      usual stuff, that is until she finds a SINGLE KEY hidden in
      one of the folds.  Seems old Karl had some secrets...                                                                                        41.

      EXT. HIGHWAY, TEXAS -- DAY  

      A highway cuts across the parched Texas scrub land, the sky
      an impossible lonesome cowboy blue as the CAMERA FINDS a
      truck barreling down the road...

      INT. SONYA'S TRUCK (MOVING) - MORNING

      Sonya's got a tough, tricked out, green pick-up truck.  She
      speeds and Marco rides shotgun --

                                      MARCO
                    Have you slept?

                                      SONYA
                    No.

                                      MARCO
                    'Cause I haven't slept.

      No answer.  She doesn't seem to need conversation.

                                      MARCO (CONT'D)
                    Nice truck.

                                      SONYA
                    Yes.

                                      MARCO
                    American police must pay well.

                                      SONYA 
                    It was my sister's.

                                      MARCO
                    Your sister has good taste.

                                      SONYA
                    Had.
                          (off look)
                    She died.

      An uncomfortable beat.  They pass a cheesy fast food place
      named Whataburger --

                                      MARCO
                    Now they make a good breakfast
                      burrito...

      She doesn't take the hint, flies by the joint.  Fine.  He
      figures he'll try to catch some sleep, but then:

                                      SONYA
                    Did you take money from that woman?                                                                                        42.

                                      MARCO
                    What woman?

                                      SONYA
                    On the bridge.  To let her pass.

                                      MARCO
                    No.  

                                      SONYA
                    They say you're all corrupt.  Mexican
                    police.  You all take bribes.

                                      MARCO
                    Not all. 

      She nods.  Hard to tell if she believes him.  

                                      MARCO (CONT'D)
                    The cartels threaten us --  

                                      SONYA
                    I thought they gave you money.  So
                    you won't do police work.

                                      MARCO
                    No.  They tell us, plata o plomo.
                          (explains)
                    Take our silver or take our lead.

                                      SONYA
                    So you just let girls die.  

                                      MARCO
                    I do all I can.  But the situation
                    is todo chingado.  

      Which means all fucked up.  His face tight.

                                      SONYA
                    You should try harder.

      Marco gives up; looks out the window --    

      INT. MILLWRIGHT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

      Charlotte sitting on the bed, punching security code after
      security code into her husband's locked cell phone.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                          (sotto)
                    Shit, shit, shit...

      She tries another code.  Another.  Frustrated she tosses it
      aside, only to have it start RINGING.  It's a BLOCKED NUMBER.                                                                                          43.

      She answers.  Silence and then a woman's voice...

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE  (O.S.)
                    Bueno?  
                          (then)
                    Karl?

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    Who is this?

      The line goes dead.

      EXT. SIDE OF HIGHWAY -- DAY

      Long desolate strip of the Texas interstate.  A SHERIFF'S
      CRUISER parked in front of a silver BMW on the side of the
      road.  

      Sonya's truck approaches, pulls over; Sonya and Marco alight. 
      Clock the BMW.  The driver's side is open.

      A Sheriff's Deputy, MANNY STOKES, 30s, with braces on his
      teeth, tips his hat.  To Sonya --

                                      STOKES
                    Ma'am, you may not want to look.  

      Sonya badges him, moves to the car with Marco.

      PULL TO REVEAL the bloodless and severed legs of JUDGE CROSS,
      still in heels, in the driver's seat.  Marco notes some
      surgical tubing leading from the body out the car to a small
      lake of blood soaking into the dry earth. 

                                      MARCO
                    We dealing with a doctor?

                                      SONYA
                    Where's her purse?

                                      STOKES
                    Passenger seat.  Everything's there. 
                    Cash, credit cards, what have you...

      Sonya gloves up, goes to the passenger side.  Rifles through
      the purse.  Opens the wallet.  An EMPTY SPACE where the
      judge's ID would be.

                                      SONYA
                    Did you pull her ID?

                                      STOKES
                    No ma'am.                                                                                        44.

                                      SONYA
                    Then it's missing.

                                      MARCO
                    Maybe that's his trophy.

                                      SONYA
                    Did Cristina have her ID?

                                      MARCO
                    I don't remember.  

                                      SONYA
                    Her mother would know.  We'll go to
                    Juarez, ask her.

      Marco laughs.  Gives her a look up and down; the pants, boots --

                                      MARCO
                    You gonna wear a hoodie?

                                      SONYA
                    Why?

                                      MARCO

                    go to Juarez looking like that.
                          (then)
                    It's not a good place.  Not anymore.

      Some sadness about that.  Sonya looks back at the body; then --

                                      SONYA
                    You want to write the scene?

                                      MARCO
                    Go ahead.

      But, he notes the generosity.  For the first time from her. 
      She pulls out a pad and pen, kneels next to the pool of blood --

                                                                                FADE OUT:

                                        ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:

      INT. TRAILER -- DAY

      TIGHT ON Linder as he strips the sheets off the bed, puts
      them in a garbage bag.  Eva nowhere in sight.

      We see him pull off his shirt, stuff it in the garbage too. 
      As he reaches for a fresh shirt, we see a LONG SERPENTINE
      SCAR running the length of his left forearm... he fingers
      the scar, before he pulls on a tee shirt.

      He turns and finds EVA'S PURSE on the floor.  He rifles
      through it, pulls EVA'S ID from the wallet, studies it. 
      Then he notices a PHOTO OF A SMALL CHILD in the wallet. 
      Pulls it out, too.  

      A BEAT as turns it over, an idea slithering.  Possibilities... 

      INT. EL PASO PD - CAP - DAY

      Hank with DETECTIVE TIM COOPER (30s), brash cowboy charmer. 
      He's looped into the case.  Looking at crime scene photos of
      the two bodies on the bridge -- 

                                      COOPER
                    Judge Cross.  She needed bent over a
                    couch, bad.

                                    HANK
                    Well she got worse.  Half of her's
                    in the Pecos morgue.

                                      COOPER
                          (incredulous)
                    And the Mexicans want in on this?

                                    HANK
                    Their half was one of those missing
                    Juarez girls.

                                      COOPER
                    Puttin' up them pink crosses sure as
                    shit ain't working.  This fella know
                    about Sonya?

                                    HANK
                    Know what?

                                      COOPER
                    That she's a whackjob.  You see what
                    she keeps in that bottom drawer of
                    her desk?                                                                                        46.

                                    HANK
                    No I have not.  Nor do I care, Timmy.

      Sonya ENTERS with Marco.  Cooper shuts up; knows she might
      have overheard.  Then --

                                      SONYA
                    This is Marco Ruiz.  Tim Cooper.

                                      COOPER
                          (busting balls)
                    Buenas Dias.

                                      MARCO
                    Howdy partner.

      Cooper smiles, likes this guy already.

                                      SONYA
                    You have the footage from the bridge?

                                      COOPER
                    Went a few rounds with those Homeland
                    Security boys, but yeah, I got it.

                                    HANK
                          (to Sonya)
                    You come with me.

      Cooper takes Marco to his computer; Sonya follows Hank to
      his office --

      INT. HANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

      Hank ushers her in, toes the door shut.  Picks up a report --

                                    HANK
                    What's this?

                                      SONYA
                    I filed a report on Marco with the
                    Mexican State Police.

                                    HANK
                    I see that.

                                      SONYA
                    He compromised my crime scene.  Let
                    an ambulance drive through it.

                                    HANK
                    Because a man was having a heart
                    attack.                                                                                        47.

                                      SONYA
                    Yes.

                                    HANK
                    I woulda done the same thing.  No
                    evidence was compromised.

                                      SONYA
                    How do you know?

                                    HANK
                    Sonya, you have to work with Marco.

                                      SONYA
                    I know.

                                    HANK
                    Filing this report will affect your
                    ability to do that.

                                      SONYA
                    Why?

                                    HANK
                    People don't like being ratted out
                    to their bosses.

                                      SONYA
                    Then they should follow procedure. 

                                    HANK
                    Sonya, trust me.  You don't want to
                    file this.  

      Before she can respond Marco taps at the door, enters --

                                      MARCO
                    Got something...  

      Sonya and Hank move out --

      INT. EL PASO PD - CAP - CONTINUOUS

      They gather at Cooper's computer running footage of the bridge
      traffic... he stops on a BLACK ESCALADE passing by the camera.

                                      COOPER
                      Sonofabitch knew there were cameras.

      HE PUNCHES in and we see a SHADOWY FIGURE behind the wheel,
      baseball hat pulled over his face, impossible to ID.

                                      SONYA
                    We sure it's him?                                                                                        48.

                                      COOPER
                    Timing is spot on.  Woulda been the
                    only car on the bridge at the time.

                                    HANK
                    Plate on the car?

                                      COOPER
                    Just a partial, which I ran.

      He hands a sheet of paper to Sonya.  She's thrown --

                                      SONYA
                    Daniel Fuller?

      Hank is surprised too.  

                                      MARCO
                    Who's Daniel Fuller?

      EXT. MILLWRIGHT RANCH, BARN - DAY

      Charlotte ENTERS the barn to find Cesar stacking feed bags
      next to the grain bin.  He straightens when he sees Charlotte
      standing there.

                                      CESAR
                    Nobody has bothered you, have they?

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    No.

      She holds out her husband's cell phone.

                                      CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
                    This was in Karl's pocket.  Have you
                    seen it before?

      Cesar shakes his head slowly -- not sure what the hell she's
      up to.

                                      CESAR
                    No.  Why?

                    A woman called for Karl.
                          (off look)
                    He's gone, Cesar.  You answer to me
                    now.                                                                                        49.

                                      CESAR
                    Si.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    Who is she?

                                      CESAR
                    I don't know.

      Charlotte flinches, but doesn't want to give Cesar the
        satisfaction of seeing her vulnerable.  She pulls out the
      KEY she found hidden in Karl's wallet.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    What about this?
                          (off look)
                    I found it in his wallet.

                                      CESAR
                    Miss Charlotte, I don't know...

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    You're lying to me, Cesar.  What is
                    it?

      Cesar holds her gaze a long beat, realizes she's the boss.

                                      CESAR
                    It's better I show you.  Come.

      Off Charlotte as we...

      El Paso Times REPORTER, DANIEL FULLER (30s), wrecked from no
      sleep and some serious partying, searches through the
        refrigerator in the kitchen area of the news room.  He finds
      a bottle of beer in the back -- helps himself, then takes
      two pills from his pocket.  Pops them, washes them down with
      the beer.  He wipes his face and hair, then moves into the --

      INT. EL PASO TIMES - NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS

      It's almost empty, save a young, diligent reporter named
      ADRIANA PEREZ, (20s) who is at her computer already.  Daniel's
      desk isn't far away.  As he approaches --

                                      DANIEL
                    You're here early.

                                      ADRIANA
                    I have to be in Juarez by 8.                                                                                        50.

                                      DANIEL
                    That's more like 9 or 10, Mexican
                    time.

      Adriana smiles, polite, but not engaging.

                                      DANIEL (CONT'D)
                    You're wasting your life on that
                    beat.  You know that? 

                                      ADRIANA
                    I'm wasting my life, huh?

      It's a subtle dig that he doesn't catch.  He's an addict,
      fallen from grace when the Houston Chronicle fired him for
      substance abuse.  He's no cleaner, a year later.  He guzzles
      his beer --

                                      DANIEL
                    So what're you doing across the
                    bridge?

                    girls over the border.  Anchor babies,
                    you know --

                            (interrupts)
                    I don't know, Adriana, and I
                      desperately don't care.  And guess
                    what, neither do our readers.

                                      ADRIANA
                    I care.  

      He finishes his beer.  He hands her the dead soldier, starts
      to head out --

                                      ADRIANA (CONT'D)
                    Denise was looking for you last night. 
                    You had a deadline.  

                                      DANIEL
                    Denise can fuck off.

                                      ADRIANA
                    Where were you?

                                      DANIEL
                    Down the street, reporting.  

                                      ADRIANA
                    So, you were at the bar all night.                                                                                        51.

                                      DANIEL
                    Are you my mother, Adriana?  

                                      ADRIANA
                    No.

      He gets nasty now --

                                      DANIEL
                    No.  You're just a little cub
                    reporter.  And I've written for the
                    Houston Chronicle, New York Times...

                                      ADRIANA
                    I know -- 

                                      DANIEL
                    So don't tell me how to deal with my
                    fucking editor.

                                      ADRIANA
                    Fine.

                                      DANIEL
                    Good luck chasing the Mexicans.  Try
                    not to get shot.

      He smirks to himself, moves out --

      INT. PICK-UP TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY

      Cesar driving across the ranch with Charlotte.

                                      CHARLOTTE 
                    Where are we going?

                                      CESAR
                    Just a little farther.

      He turns past an outbuilding on the ranch, down a two-track
      road and they come to a small cabin tucked behind some trees.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    I've never seen this part of the
                    ranch before.

                                      CESAR
                    Come.

      He parks --

      EXT. EL PASO TIMES, PARKING LOT -- DAY

      Fuller crosses the lot and finds his car.  He clicks the
      remote as we...                                                                                        52.

      INT. FULLER'S ESCALADE - DAY

      He sits behind the wheel, shuts the door when CLICK.  The
      doors LOCK suddenly.  He snaps awake, tries a door and shit
      it won't open.  Same with the windows.  It seems he's locked
      in his own car.  What the fuck is happening?  

      He sees a WIRE running from the rear view mirror -- what the
      hell is that doing there? 

                                      FULLER
                    What the...

      He pulls on the wire, sees that it runs to something behind
      his seat.  That's when he hears the TICKING and sees a digital
      clock mounted to two VIALS OF BINARY EXPLOSIVES, ammonium
      nitrate.  It's a bomb.  The clock reads 20 MINUTES and our
      cocky asshole reporter is trapped inside his car.

      EXT. CABIN, MILLWRIGHT RANCH - DAY

      Charlotte follows Cesar up to the door of the cabin.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    I don't understand.  Is this what
                    the key's for?  

                                      CESAR
                    Please, I show you.

      Charlotte watches as Cesar pulls a ring of keys from his
      jacket, finds the key and opens a door.

      He motions her inside...

      INT. CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

      Charlotte follows Cesar into the cabin.  There's not much
      inside except some empty PIZZA BOXES, dozens of empty FAST
      FOOD BAGS.  She notes the windows have been blacked out.   

      Cesar opens a door and clicks on a light, revealing a
      staircase leading into a basement. 

                                      CESAR
                    Down there.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    God damn it, Cesar, I don't like
                    this...

                                      CESAR
                    It's okay Senora.  Come.                                                                                        53.

      Charlotte follows Cesar down the staircase and finds an empty
      basement.  At the far end there is a large WOODEN DOOR with
      a crossbar and lock.  Cesar points to lock on the door bar.

                                      CESAR (CONT'D)
                    There.

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    Is that what the key's for?

                                      CESAR
                    Si...

      A BEAT as Charlotte tries to absorb all this.  Then she
      removes the KEY, hands trembling, and approaches the locked
      door.  

                                      CHARLOTTE
                    What's in there?

      He just indicates she should open it.  A beat, then she slides
      the key into the lock...

      INT. SONYA'S TRUCK (MOVING) -- DAY

      Sonya ripping through the streets.  Marco sits shotgun,
      worried as she takes her eyes off the road to stare at her
      cell phone --

                                      SONYA
                    Daniel Fuller's not answering.

      He puts a hand out for her cell --

                                      MARCO
                    You drive, I'll call.

      He takes the phone --

                                      SONYA
                    He's a pill head.  Been arrested for
                    battery.

                                      MARCO
                    He organized enough to freeze a girl
                    for a year?  Slice this judge in
                    half so elegantly? 

                                      SONYA
                    It was his car on the bridge. 

                                      MARCO
                    No answer...                                                                                        54.

                                      SONYA
                    We're here anyway.

      She swings a tight turn onto San Antonio Street --

      EXT. EL PASO TIMES, PARKING LOT - DAY 

      TIGHT ON a BOMB SQUAD TECH pulling on the heavy bomb suit. 
      We pull back to reveal uniform officers pushing back traffic
      and onlookers.

      WE FOLLOW the Bomb Tech as he joins several other men in the
      bulky suits walking with their bomb gear to Daniel Fuller's
      car.

      Sonya pulls up in the Truck and is brought to a halt by a
      phalanx of police and bomb squad support members.

                                      OFFICER
                    Fall back behind the perimeter!

      Sonya and Marco exit the car and badge one of the Bomb Techs.

                                      SONYA
                    Detective North...

                                    BOMB TECH
                    You're gonna have to vacate the area.

                                      MARCO
                    What's going on?

                                    BOMB TECH
                    There's a car rigged with a bomb in
                    that lot.

                                      SONYA
                    A black Escalade?

                                    BOMB TECH
                      Affirmative.  Now fall back please --

                                      SONYA
                    -- It belongs to Daniel Fuller. 
                    He's wanted in connection with a
                    double homicide.

                                    BOMB TECH
                    Well ma'am, he's the one called it
                    in.  He's trapped in there.
                          (then)
                    And he's gonna be scattered all over
                    this block if you don't let us assess
                    the situation and do our jobs.                                                                                        55.

      Sonya watches the Bomb Tech cross the barricade, frustrated --

      INT. FULLER'S ESCALADE -- DAY 

      WE HEAR THE STEADY BEEP of minutes ticking away on the timer. 
      Fuller's like a caged animal, windows fogged up from his
      hyper ventilating, trying the door to see if it will somehow
      magically open.  It does not. 

      Finally he sees the apocalyptic image of FOUR BOMB TECHS
      walking slowly toward him in their bulky suits.

      He pounds at the window.

                                      FULLER
                    Help!  Get me out!

      The first Bomb Tech reaches the car, looks inside.  Fuller
      points to the TIMER DEVICE behind him.

                                    BOMB TECH #1
                    Stay calm.  Don't move.

      A Tech slides a SNAKE CAMERA through the windshield/door
      gap.  We hear CHATTER...

                                    BOMB TECH #2
                    Binary solution... digital timer...

                                      FULLER
                    What the fuck!

                                    BOMB TECH #1
                    Eight minutes, forty seconds.  Windows
                    wired in...

      EXT. STREET - DAY

      A block outside the parking lot sit Sonya and Marco just
      outside the police tape, waiting, helpless... 

                                      MARCO
                    Call him again.
                          (off look)
                    Fuller, call him.

      Off Sonya with her cell...

      INT. FULLER'S ESCALADE -- DAY

      A hole saw whirs through the windshield.  It stops and we
      hear the steady BEEP of the countdown.  A BOMB TECH carefully
      attaches a suction cup to the windshield and pulls a disc of
      glass free.                                                                                        56.

      Fuller checks the timer -- FOUR MINUTES AND COUNTING.

      His PHONE SUDDENLY RINGS.  He answers --  

                                      FULLER
                    Help me!

                                      SONYA  (O.S.)
                    Daniel, this is Detective Sonya North.

      INTERCUT WITH:

      EXT. STREET -- SAME

      Sonya on the phone as Marco watches...

                                      SONYA
                    Were you on the Bridge of the Americas
                    last night?

                                      FULLER
                    What?

                                      SONYA
                    Were you on the bridge?  Yes or no?

                                      FULLER
                          (losing his shit)
                    No -- I was here all night.  How is
                    this going to get me out?

                                      SONYA
                    Do you know Judge Cross?

                                      FULLER
                    What?

                                      SONYA
                    Judge Lorraine Cross.

                                      FULLER
                    Just -- from her cases.

                                      SONYA
                    What cases?

      BEEP, BEEP, BEEP...

                                      FULLER
                    Oh god...

                                      SONYA
                    How about Cristina Fuentes?

      Fuller, despairing --                                                                                        57.

                                      FULLER
                    I am fucked.  So fucked...

                                      SONYA
                    Daniel!  This is important.

                                      FULLER
                      Important?  I'm going to die!

                                      SONYA
                    Have you written about Judge Cross?

                                      FULLER
                    I don't remember.  Maybe...

                                      SONYA
                    When?

                                      FULLER
                    Oh god.  I'm such an asshole.  I've
                    fucked everything up...

      One of the Bomb Techs reaches through the hole in the
      windshield -- but he can't quite reach the bomb.  Daniel
      sees the guys exchanging worried expressions --

                                      SONYA
                    Daniel listen to me.

      He looks back at the timer as it reaches 3 MINUTES and then
      it fucking skips a minute -- HE'S GOT TWO MINUTES LEFT.

                                      FULLER
                    It skipped a minute!  It skipped a
                    fucking minute!

      Bomb Tech #2 looks inside, confirms that the timer has indeed
      slipped below two minutes.  

      EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY

      And then something happens: One by one the Bomb Techs trade
      looks and step away from the car, signaling that they have
      precious little time to make it to safety.

                                    BOMB TECH #1
                    Fall back...

                                      SONYA
                    Daniel.

      The men retreat, leaving Fuller to the last minutes of his
      life...                                                                                        58.

                                      FULLER
                    No.  Come back!  Where are you going?

      He pounds on the window as the men fall back and he's left
      with the steady BEEP of the timer...

      One of the Bomb Techs turns and raises his hands up in a
      futile gesture, sorry...

      EXT. STREET -- DAY

      ON MARCO and SONYA.  Marco sees the first of the bomb techs
      retreating.  He motions to Sonya...

                                      MARCO
                    That's enough.  Let him die in peace.  

                                      SONYA
                    He needs to focus.

                                      MARCO
                    He's sitting on a bomb.  They can't
                    help him.

                                      SONYA
                    So he'll tell me the truth.

      Now Daniel hears the flat calm of Sonya's voice...

                                      SONYA (CONT'D)
                    Daniel, you must talk to me.

      INT. FULLER'S ESCALADE -- CONTINUOUS

      Fuller eyes the timer -- one minute, thirty five seconds, a
      strange calm settles over him.  This is the end...

                                      FULLER
                    Yes.

      He whimpers, closes his eyes, trying to will away the fucking
      beeping.

                                      SONYA
                      Everything will just stop.  The body
                    will feel no pain...

      He looks out the window and sees the police, firemen and
      bomb support running away from the impending blast...

                                      FULLER
                    Are you sure?

                                      SONYA
                    Don't look at the clock.                                                                                        59.

                                      FULLER
                    Okay...

      Waiting for the next soothing word --

                                      SONYA
                    Did you know your car was used to
                    dump two bodies on the bridge?

                                      FULLER
                          (broken)
                    No...

                                      SONYA
                    Focus.  Who would do this to you?

                                      FULLER
                    I've fucked with so many people.

                                      SONYA
                    Who?  Recently?

                                      FULLER
                    This can't be it.  No way, I've got
                    so much to fix...

                                      SONYA
                    Daniel?

      A LONG BEEP FILLED BEAT...

                                      SONYA (CONT'D)
                    Don't look at the timer.

      But he does and he watches the seconds stream by 8,7,6,5,4,
      3, 2, 1 ...  The final second ticks away and there is nothing
      but SILENCE for moment.  Fuller squints, braces for kingdom
      come.  

      Instead there's a CLICK.  And the DOOR LOCKS POP OPEN and
      the STEREO SPITS OUT A CD...

                                      SONYA (CONT'D)
                    Daniel, are you still there?

      He pulls open the door, races away from the car and falls to
      his knees and VOMITS as we TIME CUT:

      EXT. STREET - DAY

      Bomb Tech #1 approaches Sonya and Martin and hands them the
      CD in a clear evidence bag...

                                    BOMB TECH #1
                    It's clean.                                                                                        60.

      Sonya examines the CD.  She and Marco get inside the Truck.

      INT. SONYA'S TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER

      Sonya slides the CD into the stereo.  WE HEAR A MALE, ALTERED
      VOICE:

                                      VOICE
                    Four thousand, three hundred twenty-
                    one.  Such a tidy number -- 4321. 
                    Lorraine and Cristina are just two. 
                    Two drops in a bucket.  Two stars in
                    the multitudes.  You will see.  We
                    have some interesting times ahead of
                    us... this is only the beginning.

      And that's it.  CD pops back out.  Marco and Sonya trade
      looks as we...

                                                                                FADE OUT.

                                      END PILOT
