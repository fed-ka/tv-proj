Of everyone watching in the modest, small town theater, no
one is more enthralled than 8 year old CARL FREDRICKSEN.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
This lighter-than-air craft was
designed by Muntz himself, and is
longer than 22 Prohibition paddy-
wagons placed end to end.
Young Carl stares, mouth agape, wearing leather flight helmet
and goggles -- just like his idol on the silver screen.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
And here comes the adventurer now!
2.
NEWSREEL FOOTAGE: the dashing Muntz descends down the
gangplank to the delight of the crowd. His dogs trail him.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Never apart from his faithful dogs,
Muntz conceived the craft for
canine comfort! It's a veritable
floating palace in the sky...
An opulent dining room.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
...complete with doggie bath and
mechanical canine walker.
One dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time, while a
second wears an electrode helmet and runs on a treadmill.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
And Jiminy Cricket, do the locals
consider Muntz the bee's knees!
And how!
Cameras flash as Muntz stands heroic, striking his signature
"thumbs up" stance.
MUNTZ
"Adventure is out there!"
In the theater, Young Carl returns the thumbs up.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
But what has Muntz brought back
this time?
Muntz speaks to a crowded auditorium, on stage beside a
curtained object.
MUNTZ
Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster
of Paradise Falls!
He pulls away the drape to reveal a GIANT BIRD SKELETON.
CROWD
Ooh!
Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
And golly, what a swell monster
this is. But what's this?
Skeptical scientists analyze the bones.
3.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Scientists cry foul! The National
Explorers Society accuses Muntz of
fabricating the skeleton!
YOUNG CARL
No!
Muntz's portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other
famous explorers.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
The organization strips Muntz of
his membership.
Muntz's "Explorer's Society" badge is ceremoniously RIPPED
from his jacket.
Carl GASPS.
Muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield.
He grimly
addresses the crowd.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to
Paradise Falls and promises to
capture the beast... alive!
MUNTZ
I promise to capture the beast...
alive!
In the theater, young Carl smiles.
MUNTZ
And I will not come back until I do!
The crowd CHEERS.
Muntz gives his thumbs up from the cockpit as the dirigible
lifts off.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
And so the
explorer is off to clear
his name.
Bon voyage Charles
Muntz, and
good luck capturing the
Monster of
Paradise Falls!
Carl looks like he just witnessed a miracle.
DISSOLVE TO:
4.
Carl squeezes through the broken door into the foyer.
He
follows the voice toward the living room.
GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
All engines ahead full! Let's take
her up to 26,000 feet! Rudders
eighteen degrees towards the south.
Carl rounds the corner to see...
ELLIE, an eight year old girl, her mussy red hair barely
visible beneath her flight helmet and goggles. Bare footed,
her overalls are patched and dirty.
The old house has been transformed into a make-believe
dirigible cockpit. Ellie steers, the wheel made from a rusty
old bicycle.
YOUNG ELLIE
It's a beautiful day, winds out of
the east at ten knots.
Visibility... unlimited.
(yells a command)
Enter the weather in the logbook!
The navigator (her hamster) skitters in its cage.
Ellie uses two tied-together Coke bottles as binoculars.
YOUNG ELLIE
Oh! There's something down there!
I will bring it back for science.
Awwww, it's a puppy!
Carl is distracted by the Muntz newspaper clippings taped to
the wall.
YOUNG ELLIE (O.S.)
No time!
A storm! Lightning! Hail!
Ellie pops up in front of Carl.
6.
YOUNG ELLIE
What are you doing!?!
Carl screams. He lets go of his balloon. It floats through
a broken part of the ceiling and disappears.
Ellie circles Carl accusingly.
YOUNG ELLIE
Don't you know this is an exclusive
club? Only explorers get in here.
Not just any kid off the street
with a helmet and a pair of
goggles. Do you think you got what
it takes? Well, do you?!?
Carl FUMPHERS.
YOUNG ELLIE
Alright, you're in. Welcome aboard.
She offers her hand.
Carl looks down, embarrassed.
YOUNG ELLIE
What's wrong? Can't you talk?
Carl is frozen.
Ellie softens.
YOUNG ELLIE
Hey, I don't bite.
She takes off her helmet.
Her hair frizzes out in all
directions.
She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and
pins it on Carl.
YOUNG ELLIE
You and me, we're in a club now.
Carl smiles.
YOUNG ELLIE
I saw where your balloon went.
Come on, let's go get it!
Carl watches her stride out of the room.
She pops back in.
YOUNG ELLIE
My name's Ellie.
She grabs his hand.
Carl blushes as she pulls him out of the room.
7.
YOUNG ELLIE
There it is.
Carl and Ellie look across the attic at the balloon. Between
them the floor has collapsed, save one rickety beam. Carl GULPS.
YOUNG ELLIE
Well, go ahead.
She pushes him out onto the beam.
YOUNG ELLIE
Go on.
Carl steels his courage. He puts on his goggles, starts
forward... and FALLS through the floor.
CUT TO:
Carl in bed, reading a book by flashlight, his arm in a CAST.
Into the room floats Carl's lost BLUE BALLOON.
Carl jumps and CALLS OUT in fright.
YOUNG CARL
(re: arm)
Ow!
A head pops up from outside the open window.
YOUNG ELLIE
Hey kid!!
Carl SCREAMS, hitting himself in the face with the cast.
YOUNG CARL
Ow!!
8.
Ellie climbs in the window.
YOUNG ELLIE
Thought you might need a little
cheerin' up. I got somethin' to
show ya!
The two hunker under a blanket tent with a flashlight.
Ellie
whispers, as if to protect a National Secret.
YOUNG ELLIE
I am about to let you see something
I have never shown to another human
being. Ever. In my life.
Carl's eyes widen in alarm.
YOUNG ELLIE
You'll have to swear you will not
tell anyone.
Carl nods.
YOUNG ELLIE
Cross your heart. Do it!
Carl crosses.
Ellie unveils...
YOUNG ELLIE
My Adventure Book!
It's a reused photo album with the words "My Adventure Book"
written across it. She opens it to a photo of Charles Muntz.
YOUNG ELLIE
You know him.
Carl smiles excitedly.
YOUNG ELLIE
Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get
big, I'm going where he's going:
South America.
She turns the page to a map.
YOUNG ELLIE
It's like America... but south.
Wanna know where I'm gonna live?
9.
She turns to an engraving of a large waterfall. A small hand-
drawn picture of Ellie's clubhouse is glued to the top.
YOUNG ELLIE
(reading caption)
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in
time." I ripped this right out of
a library book.
Carl GASPS in horror.
YOUNG ELLIE
I'm gonna move my clubhouse there,
and park it right next to the
falls. Who knows what lives up
there? And once I get there...
She flips through her book, revealing a page marked, "STUFF
I'M GOING TO DO." Past that, the pages are blank.
YOUNG ELLIE
Well, I'm saving these pages for
all the adventures I'm gonna have.
Only... I just don't know how I'm
gonna get to Paradise Falls.
Ellie closes the book, disappointed.
Carl has a thought.
He looks at his toy dirigible.
YOUNG ELLIE
That's it! You can take us there
in a blimp! Swear you'll take us.
Cross your heart! Cross it! Cross
your heart.
Carl does.
YOUNG ELLIE
Good. You promised. No backing out.
Carl shakes his head "no."
YOUNG ELLIE
Well, see you tomorrow kid!
Bye.
Ellie hops up and jumps out the window.
YOUNG ELLIE
"Adventure is out there!!"
She pops back in.
10.
YOUNG ELLIE
You know, you don't talk very much.
I like you.
Carl looks out the window after her in amazement.
He rests
his head on his balloon.
YOUNG CARL
Wow.
The balloon pops.
CUT TO:
FLASH! A photo is taken of the wedding couple: Carl and
Ellie, now 19. She jumps at him and gives him a big kiss.
Ellie's side of the church erupts like wild frontiersmen.
A
gun shot is fired in the air.
Carl's side, rigid puritans in black, clap politely.
They push two chairs into place side by side in the living room.
Carl and Ellie sit side by side in their chairs, reading.
Without looking up from their books, they hold hands.
Ellie finishes painting a wall mural of a stork carrying a
bundle in its beak. Carl hangs a mobile above the crib.
Carl touches Ellie's shoulder as the doctor explains.
Ellie
drops her head in her hands.
Ellie paints a MURAL of their house atop Paradise Falls over
the mantle. Carl organizes a compass, map, binoculars, and
native bird figurine beneath the painting. It's their shrine
to Adventure.
Carl sets A JAR on a table, "PARADISE FALLS" written on it.
Ellie drops in a few coins. She looks at Carl and crosses
her heart. Carl crosses his.
A SERIES OF SHOTS
The jar slowly fills as Carl and Ellie toss in spare change.
Their car blows a tire.
The two stand by the jar, reluctant.
Carl BREAKS the jar.
New tire.
Carl in the hospital with a broken leg.
Breaking jar.
A storm rages.
A tree falls, crushing the roof.
Breaking jar.
Carl struggles to tie his tie.
Ellie helps.
They walk out
the front door arm in arm.
Ellie struggles to tie Carl's tie as they rush out the door.
A SERIES OF SHOTS as Ellie straightens Carl's ties.
Stylish
1950's ties. Wide 60's ties. Paisley 70's ties.
13.
Older Carl and Ellie smile at themselves in the hall mirror.
Carl and Ellie dance in the evening candlelight. The
PARADISE FALLS JAR sits off to the side, now dusty and
forgotten.
Carl cleans the inside of the window.
Ellie cleans the
outside.
Carl vacuums the Adventure Shrine on the mantle. Carl smiles
at a photo of Ellie as a child, wearing her flight helmet and
goggles. He looks up at the mural of their house at Paradise
Falls. His smile fades.
Behind him, Ellie sweeps the floor.
Their dream has gone
unfulfilled.
Carl has an idea.
Ellie lies in a hospital bed.
She looks through her
ADVENTURE BOOK.
A BLUE BALLOON floats in to the room.
Carl stands at the door.
He smiles and walks to her bedside.
Ellie pushes her Adventure Book toward him.
She weakly pats
his cheek and adjusts his tie.
He kisses her on the forehead.
Carl sits alone, next to a huge bouquet of balloons.
An ALARM CLOCK BUZZES.
An aged hand shuts it off and picks
up the nearby glasses.
CARL sits alone in his double bed.
He rubs his face. GRUNTS.
He gets out of bed, STRETCHING, GRUNTING and CRACKING BONES.
He grabs his cane, with four tennis balls stuck to the bottom
spokes.
Now dressed, Carl rides his ELDERLY ASSISTANCE CHAIR down the
staircase. This takes a LONG, LONG time.
Three quarters of the way down, the chair stops.
He bangs
the armrest and the chair restarts.
Carl eats breakfast by himself.
15.
Carl cleans the window with a cloth.
His lonely reflection
stares back at him.
Carl dusts the mantle and Shrine to Adventure.
Carl looks in the hall mirror. He puts on his hat and
considers his reflection. He straightens his GRAPE SODA PIN.
Carl sits in his chair watching TV.
A KNOCK at the door.
Carl listens through the door. Is the kid gone?
He opens it.
RUSSELL
"Good afternoon. My name is
Russell."
CARL
Uh... kid...
RUSSELL
"And I am a Wilderness Explorer in
Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12."
CARL
Kid.
KID!!
Russell stops... but goes back to reading.
RUSSELL
"Are you in need of any assistance
today Sir?"
CARL
Thank you, but I don't need any help!
19.
Carl swings the door shut, but a small camping boot stops it.
RUSSELL
Ow.
Carl opens the door.
Russell stands at attention.
CARL
(RESIGNED)
Proceed.
RUSSELL
"Good afternoon. My-"
CARL
But skip to the end!
Russell points to his SASH. It is covered with badges except
for one glaringly empty space.
RUSSELL
See these? These are my Wilderness
Explorer badges. You may notice
one is missing. It's my Assisting
the Elderly badge. If I get it I
will become a Senior Wilderness
Explorer!
Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a "W", his
fingers the "wings" of a bird, then the "claws" of a bear.
RUSSELL
"The wilderness must be explored!
CAW-CAW! RAAAR!"
This sets Carl's hearing aid off. Carl GRUMBLES in pain.
RUSSELL
It's gonna be great! There's a big
ceremony, and all the dads come,
and they pin on our badges...
CARL
So you want to assist an old
person?
RUSSELL
Yep! Then I will be a Senior
Wilderness Explorer!
Carl leans in close to Russell.
20.
CARL
(CONSPIRATORIALLY)
You ever heard of a snipe?
RUSSELL
Snipe?
CARL
Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it
sneaks in my yard and gobbles my
poor azaleas. I'm elderly and
infirm. I can't catch it. If only
someone could help me...
RUSSELL
Me! Me!
I'll do it!
CARL
Oh, I don't know, it's awfully
crafty. You'd have to clap your
hands three times to lure it in.
RUSSELL
I'll find it, Mr. Fredricksen!
CARL
I think its burrow is two blocks
down. If you go past --
RUSSELL
Two blocks down! Got it!
Russell runs down the block clapping and calling.
RUSSELL
Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey...
CARL
(calls after Russell)
Bring it back here when you find
it!
Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door.
He stops short.
A large truck is backing up, getting dangerously close to
ELLIE'S MAILBOX.
CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
Okay, keep her coming... And...
stop. Stop! STOP!!
The truck hits Ellie's mailbox, crushing the front.
21.
Carl is shocked.
He runs to the box.
CARL
What? Hey! Hey you!
What do you
think you're doing?
CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
I am so sorry, sir...
The worker bangs on the mailbox, trying to fix it.
CARL
Don't touch that!
CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
No no, let me take care of that for you.
Carl grabs the mailbox, trying to wrestle it from the worker.
CARL
(STRUGGLING)
Get away from our mailbox!
CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
Hey sir, I...
CARL
I don't want you to touch it!
Carl HITS the worker with his cane.
He falls to the sidewalk.
The worker rubs his head.
Blood.
Carl backs up toward his door, cradling his mailbox.
What
has he done?
Passerbys stare.
Workers gather, as does the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.
Carl backs into his house.
Carl shuts his door.
He closes the curtains.
He peeks out the window. The injured worker is helped to his
feet. A police car pulls up.
The Real Estate Developer looks toward Carl's house.
His
hand rests on Carl's fence.
22.
Carl sits alone on a bench holding a Court Summons.
A GUARD opens the door. Carl enters.
The REAL ESTATE
DEVELOPER watches him enter.
All is quiet but the slow ticking of the clock.
The empty hall.
The front hall mirror.
The kitchen.
Carl pulls out a suitcase.
A book tips over.
Ellie's
Adventure Book.
Carl sits in his chair slowly paging through the book.
23.
He turns to the page marked "STUFF I'M GOING TO DO."
He
closes the book and sighs.
Carl looks at the Adventure Shrine, and the PAINTING of their
house by Paradise Falls.
He holds the Shady Oaks pamphlet.
Carl's brows furrow.
He looks up at the shrine, and crosses
his heart.
Balloons spill colored light into a little girl's room as the
house floats past.
Carl sets a compass next to the map of South America.
The compass needle rotates to point SOUTH.
Carl kisses a photo of Ellie.
CARL
We're on our way, Ellie.
Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings
tied to the grate.
He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair.
He closes his eyes
and smiles.
SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle.
Carl relaxes in his chair.
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.
CARL
Huh?
26.
He stares at the front door.
Nothing.
CARL
Hm.
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.
He bolts up and approaches the door. He looks out the peep
hole. Nothing but the porch and clouds. He throws it open.
Russell PANTS, panicked.
He looks into living room.
RUSSELL
Huh. I've never been in a floating
house before.
Carl follows Russell into the living room.
Russell chuckles
and points at the photo of young Ellie.
RUSSELL
Goggles.
Look at this stuff!
Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of
the open atlas.
RUSSELL
Wow, you going on a trip?
(reads from the engraving)
"Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in
Time." You going to South America,
Mr. Fredricksen?
Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket.
CARL
Don't touch that.
You'll soil it.
RUSSELL
You know, most people take a plane,
but you're smart because you'll have
all your TV and clocks and stuff.
Russell runs over to the steering rig.
RUSSELL
Whoah.
Is this how you steer your
house?
Does it really work?
CARL
Kid, would you stop with the --
Russell steers and the house tilts, knocking Carl back and
forth.
RUSSELL
Oh, this makes it go right, and
that way's left.
CARL
Let go of the -- knock it off!
Russell looks out the window in front of him.
28.
RUSSELL
Hey look, buildings!
GRUMBLING, Carl kneels at the fireplace to cut a few balloon
strings with his housekeys.
29.
CARL
Stayed up all night blowing up
balloons, for what?
RUSSELL
...warm air goes by cool air, and
the airs go by each other and
that's how we get lightning.
CARL
That's nice, kid.
Carl turns off his hearing aid.
Silence.
He smiles.
Russell tries to get Carl's attention.
A storm is brewing in
the distance.
RUSSELL
(nearly silent)
Mr. Fredricksen, there's a big
storm coming. It's starting to get
scary. We're gonna get blown to
bits! We're in big trouble, Mr.
Fredricksen!
A huge lightning bolt flash lights up the room.
Carl turns
on his hearing aid.
CARL
What are you doing over there?
RUSSELL
Look!
The tiny house is heading for a MASSIVE STORM.
Carl STRUGGLES to steer the house away but is blown into the
storm. The steering mechanism recoils and sends Carl flying.
Plates fall from the walls and furniture slides as the house
is rocked in the storm.
Russell's backpack slides toward the front door.
30.
RUSSELL
My pack!
Russell HOPS on top of the backpack.
RUSSELL
Got ya!
The pack slides toward the OPEN FRONT DOOR. Russell screams.
He's about to slide out when the house tilts and the door
swings shut.
The Paradise Falls jar rolls past Carl.
He chases after it.
Ellie's chair slides across the room.
Carl gasps and runs to
protect it.
The photo of Ellie rocks and slides off the wall.
Carl
lunges to catch it.
Carl is asleep.
A finger pokes Carl's face.
Nothing.
The finger pokes Carl's face again.
Carl WAKES UP.
RUSSELL
Whew!
I thought you were dead.
CARL
Wha... what happened?
Carl STRUGGLES to rise from the pile of Ellie's things he'd
been protecting.
RUSSELL
I steered us. I did!
I steered
the house!
CARL
Steered us?
31.
RUSSELL
After you tied your stuff down you
took a nap, so I went ahead and
steered us down here.
RUSSELL
Oh we're in South America all
right. It was a cinch, with my
Wilderness Explorer GPS.
Russell holds up his WILDERNESS EXPLORER GPS UNIT.
CARL
GP-what?
RUSSELL
My dad gave it to me. It shows
exactly where we are on the planet.
With this baby, we'll never be lost!
Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window.
Carl kneels by the fireplace and cuts at the balloon strings.
CARL
We'll get you down, find a bus
stop. You just tell the man you
want to go back to your mother.
RUSSELL
Sure, but I don't think they have
busses in Paradise Falls.
CARL
There. That ought to do it. Here,
I'll give you some change for bus fare.
Russell follows Carl toward the front door.
RUSSELL
Nah, I'll just use my city bus pass.
CARL
Wow.
Carl's eyes adjust to the dark. Muntz's dirigible the
"Spirit of Adventure" is tethered in the cave.
MUNTZ (O.S.)
I'm sorry about the dogs -- hope
they weren't too rough on you.
GAMMA (O.S.)
We weren't!
MUNTZ
Go ahead and moor your airship
right next to mine.
Muntz gestures to a pylon, where Carl ties off the house.
Muntz and the dogs walk up the gangplank of the dirigible.
CARL
We're not actually going inside the
"Spirit of Adventure" itself?!
MUNTZ
Oh.
Would you like to?
CARL
Would I?!?!
Carl GIGGLES like a little boy.
CARL
Wait up, Mr. Muntz!
Carl and Russell follow up the ramp.
CARL
Jiminy Cricket.
Dug follows, but is blocked by Alpha and Beta.
BETA
Not you.
64.
GAMMA
What do we do with Dug?
ALPHA
He has lost the bird.
Put him in
the Cone of Shame.
Dug WHIMPERS.
Carl and Russell are speechless as they walk into the room.
It's a treasure trove of giant skeletons, stuffed creatures,
and rare cultural artifacts.
Various servant dogs dust and polish as Muntz leads Carl and
Russell through the room.
MUNTZ
Most of the collection is housed in
the world's top museums: New York,
Munich, London... `Course I kept
the best for myself.
CARL
Did you ever! Will you look at that?
MUNTZ
Oh yes, the Arsinoitherium. Beast
charged while I was brushing my
teeth. Used my shaving kit to
bring him down.
A dog approaches carrying a menu.
Muntz waves it off.
MUNTZ
Oh, surprise me.
(to Carl)
Only way to get it out of Ethiopia
at the time was to have it declared
as "dental equipment!"
Muntz LAUGHS.
Behind him, a dog can't resist gnawing at one
of the bones.
65.
CARL
Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian
Leopard Tortoise!
MUNTZ
Oh, you recognize it? I'm
impressed! That's an interesting
story there...
A dog approaches with a bottle of champagne in his mouth.
Muntz glances at the bottle.
MUNTZ
Hm, excellent choice.
(to Carl)
I found it on safari with
Roosevelt.
Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle.
POP! They sloppily pour two glasses.
MUNTZ
He and I fell into a habit of
playing gin rummy in the evenings.
And did he cheat? Oh, he was
horrible!
Muntz and Carl LAUGH.
Alpha interrupts.
ALPHA
(high-pitched voice)
Master, dinner is ready.
MUNTZ
Oh dear, broken translator.
It's
that loose wire again.
(leans down, fixes it)
There you go big fella.
ALPHA
(deep scary voice)
Thank you Master.
Russell reacts.
RUSSELL
I liked his other voice.
Muntz LAUGHS.
MUNTZ
Well, dinner is served!
Right this
way.
66.
Muntz leads Carl and Russell into the dining room and up to a
large table.
MUNTZ
So how are things stateside?
Almost tempted to go back a few
times, but I have unfinished work
here... Please.
Dogs pull back chairs for them.
They sit.
Dog waiters place
napkins on their laps.
MUNTZ
I hope you're hungry because
Epsilon is the finest chef I've
ever had.
Dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove
the silver plate covers at the same time. The meals look
delicious.
MUNTZ
Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!
RUSSELL
Yes!!
Russell is served a hot dog.
His waiter can't resist and
eats a bite.
RUSSELL
Hey!
Another dog pours some juice then takes a big slurp from his
glass.
RUSSELL
Hey!
Carl looks around, still enthralled.
CARL
Oh my Ellie would have loved all
this. You know, it's because of
you she had this dream to come down
here and live by Paradise Falls.
He gestures toward HIS HOUSE, tethered outside the porthole
window.
67.
MUNTZ
I'm honored. And now you've made
it!
CARL
You're sure we're not a bother?
I'd hate to impose.
MUNTZ
No no! It's a pleasure to have
guests -- a real treat.
The dogs erupt into excited barking.
DOG WALLA
Treat?!
Treat! I want a treat!
MUNTZ
No no, quiet! Calm down.
Calm
down...
In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell's hot dog.
RUSSELL
Hey!
MUNTZ
(CONT'D)
Shouldn't've used that word...
Having guests is a delight. More
often I get thieves, come to steal
what's rightfully mine.
CARL
No!
Muntz picks up a lantern and walks to the back of the room.
MUNTZ
They called me a fraud, those...
dah! But once I bring back this
creature, my name will be cleared.
The lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples,
feathers. Hundreds of them... all of THE BIRD. Kevin.
This is Muntz's obsession. He looks over to a full size
skeleton.
MUNTZ
Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a
lifetime tracking it. Sometimes
years go by between sightings...
(MORE)
68.
MUNTZ (cont'd)
I've tried to smoke it out of that
deathly labyrinth where it lives...
Can't go in after it. Once in,
there's no way out. Lost so many
dogs...
Muntz is lost in reverie.
MUNTZ
And here they come, these bandits,
and think the bird is theirs to
take! But they soon find that this
mountain is a very dangerous
place.
Distracted Russell finally notices the skeleton.
RUSSELL
Hey, that looks like Kevin!
MUNTZ
"Kevin?"
RUSSELL
Yeah! That's my new giant bird
pet. I trained it to follow us.
Muntz and Alpha exchange glances.
MUNTZ
Follow you? Impossible.
How?
RUSSELL
She likes chocolate.
Russell holds up a chocolate bar to show Muntz.
MUNTZ
Chocolate?
RUSSELL
Yeah, I gave her some of my
chocolate. She goes ga-ga for it.
Carl swipes the chocolate from Russell and pockets it.
CARL
But it ran off!
It's gone now.
Muntz stares.
He walks to a table full of flight helmets.
69.
MUNTZ
You know, Carl. These people who
pass through here, they all tell
pretty good stories. A "Surveyor"
making a map.
Using his cane, Muntz topples a helmet from the table.
It
rolls across the floor.
MUNTZ
A "Botanist" cataloguing plants.
Muntz topples another helmet.
He lifts a third to show Carl.
MUNTZ
An old man taking his house to
Paradise Falls.
He drops the helmet.
It rolls to Carl's feet.
MUNTZ
That's the best one yet. I can't
wait to hear how it ends.
Carl glances around nervously.
Out the window, sitting on the roof of his house, sits THE
BIRD!
CARL
Well! It's been a wonderful
evening, but we'd better be going.
Carl gets up and pulls Russell from the table.
MUNTZ
Oh, you're not leaving?
CARL
We don't want to take advantage of
your hospitality. Come on Russell.
Carl leads Russell toward the door.
RUSSELL
But we haven't even had dessert
yet.
Muntz follows behind them slowly, menacingly.
70.
MUNTZ
No, the boy's right. You haven't
had dessert. Epsilon here makes a
delicious Cherries Jubilee.
Carl pulls Russell along, Muntz following behind like
something out of a bad dream.
MUNTZ
Oh, you really must stay. I
insist! We have so much more to
talk about!
A distant HAUNTED WAIL.
Everyone stops.
RUSSELL
Kevin?
Muntz walks to the window and looks out.
Atop the roof he
sees THE BIRD.
MUNTZ
It's here.
He turns back to Carl... but they're gone.
MUNTZ
(to dogs)
Get them!
Carl and Russell untie Carl's house from the pylon.
CARL
Hurry!
RUSSELL
I am hurrying!
Dogs descend down the ramp behind them.
RUSSELL
They're coming!
Carl and Russell run toward the cave opening.
Dogs block the cave opening.
Carl stops short.
DUG (O.S.)
Master, over here!
71.
Dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave.
Carl
and Russell run toward him.
The cave leads to a steep incline.
The dogs are getting
closer.
There's no choice but to JUMP.
The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell
to leap down the incline, like astronauts.
DUG
Go toward the light, master!
Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell.
The bird sees the dogs. She jumps off the house and lifts
Carl and Russell on her back.
She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her.
Russell and Carl HANG ON for dear life.
BANG BANG BANG! Balloons pop as they scrape across the
ceiling. The house lowers.
Ahead, a giant rock sits in their path. Carl tugs at the
house but it CRASHES against the rock, pulling Russell onto
the ground.
CARL
Russell!
Dragging on the ground, Russell gets BUMPED around badly.
Dripping wet dogs cower in front of a menacing Muntz.
MUNTZ
You lost them?
BETA
Uh, it was Dug.
GAMMA
Yeah, he's with them.
He helped
them escape!
Muntz snarls in anger.
MUNTZ
Wait.
Wait a minute.
Dug...
He leans over a RADAR TRACKING DEVICE.
CUT TO:
Inside the living room, Ellie's photo crashes to the floor.
CARL
No!
Carl panics.
He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife.
Muntz motions to the dogs. They swarm past Russell, knocking
him down and grabbing the bird in the net.
RUSSELL
No!
Carl pulls his house away from the flames.
77.
The bird CALLS OUT plaintively as the dogs drag her into the
dirigible.
Muntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible.
MUNTZ
Careful. We want her in good shape
for my return.
RUSSELL
Let her go! Stop!
Russell runs after the dogs, but the gangplank closes.
The dirigible flies off.
RUSSELL
Kevin!
Carl beats out the flames with his jacket.
He extinguishes
the flames.
Carl collapses on the side of his house.
RUSSELL
You gave away Kevin.
You just gave
her away.
CARL
This is none of my concern.
I
didn't ask for any of this!
DUG
Master.
It's alright.
CARL
I am not your master! And if you
hadn't a shown up, none of this
would have happened! Bad dog! Bad
dog!
Dug slinks off, tail between his legs.
Carl angrily puts on the harness.
CARL
Now, whether you assist me or not,
I am going to Paradise Falls if it
kills me.
He walks off.
Russell falls in behind.
An angry dawn breaks.
78.
The door opens. Carl steps in.
He's back in his house for
the first time in days.
Carl and Ellie's things are strewn across the floor, a mess
from the rough journey.
Carl rights Ellie's chair, sets the lamp upright, slides the
table into position.
He pushes their two chairs back into their place.
79.
Carl closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sits.
Quiet.
Nothing, save the distant sound of the falls outside.
Carl surveys the room.
The ADVENTURE BOOK rests on a table near him.
He opens it
and puts Ellie's drawing back.
He looks through the pages, remembering the newspaper
clippings and old photographs, the dreams of young Ellie.
He turns to the page marked: STUFF I'M GOING TO DO.
Carl sighs. He managed to bring the house to the falls, but
Ellie never made it.
He closes the book.
But as he does, Carl sees something he
hadn't before.
The blank pages at the end are no longer blank.
A WEDDING PHOTO of the two of them.
On a picnic. Celebrating birthdays. Another and another...
photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs.
Carl's face warms. Ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw
adventure in everyday life.
A photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in
their chairs. Beneath it, Ellie has written:
"THANKS FOR THE ADVENTURE -- NOW GO HAVE A NEW ONE!
LOVE, ELLIE."
Carl smiles.
He looks over to Ellie's empty chair.
On the arm is
Russell's sash. Carl picks it up.
He looks to Ellie's chair.
He crosses his heart.
Inside the house, Carl adjusts his steering, scans the skies.
81.
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.
Carl's eyes go wide.
CARL
Russell?
The door swings open.
CARL
Dug!
DUG
I was hiding under your porch
because I love you. Can I stay?
CARL
Can you stay? Well, you're my dog
aren't you? And I'm your master!
DUG
You are my master?!
Dug lunges forward and overwhelms Carl with dog kisses.
DUG
Oh boy.
Oh boy!
Dogs play poker. Behind them, Russell flies past with the
leaf blower. They turn to look.
Russell releases the balloons and picks up the leaf blower,
ready for action.
RUSSELL
Yes!
Don't worry Kevin! I'll save -
Growling dogs move toward him.
Russell blows the leaf blower at the dogs.
Muntz stares into the bird's cage, mesmerized.
She's
miserable and scared.
MUNTZ
And they wouldn't believe me. Just
wait till they get a look at you.
Alpha enters.
ALPHA
Master! The small mailman has
returned.
MUNTZ
What?
Dogs tie Russell to a chair.
RUSSELL
Let me go!
Muntz enters.
MUNTZ
Where's your elderly friend?
Russell blows the leaf blower in Muntz's face.
RUSSELL
He's not my friend anymore.
83.
Muntz grabs the leaf blower and drags Russell out.
MUNTZ
Well, if you're here, Fredricksen
can't be far behind.
Muntz drags Russell through the trophy room.
RUSSELL
Where are you keeping Kevin!?
Muntz sets Russell down and walks to a control panel.
RUSSELL
Let me go!
BETA
Scream all you want, small mailman.
GAMMA
None of your mailman friends can
hear you.
RUSSELL
I'll unleash all my Wilderness
Explorer training!
Muntz is about to throw a switch when he looks out the
porthole. Flying toward him is CARL'S HOUSE!
MUNTZ
Alpha! Fredricksen's coming back.
Guard that bird. If you see the
old man, you know what to do.
Muntz pulls the switch and walks out of the room.
RUSSELL
Hey, where are you going?
I'm not
finished with you!
MUNTZ
Nice talking with you.
Muntz slams the door.
Light emerges from the floor.
Russell is on the ramp, which
is opening. Russell REACTS.
84.
Muntz enters the cockpit and takes the wheel.
MUNTZ
Where are you, Fredricksen?
Carl steers toward the cockpit. He dons Russell's sash, then
hooks his cane onto his back. He's fighting for a cause.
He hears SCREAMING. It's Russell! Tied to his chair, he
slides down the ramp as it lowers, closer and closer to the
edge.
CARL
Russell!
Carl steers his house to the dirigible.
Carl sets Russell, still bound, down in the front hall.
85.
RUSSELL
You came back for Kevin!
Let's go
get her.
CARL
I'm getting Kevin.
You stay here!
RUSSELL
But I want to help!
CARL
I don't want your help.
I want you
safe!
Carl leaps back into the dirigible.
Dug follows.
Russell STRUGGLES against his bonds.
Carl and Dug sneak down a hall. They see dogs ahead and hide.
CARL
How do we get past these dogs?
DUG
Uh... POINT!
Dug points to a grate in the wall.
Dug leads Carl "backstage" through a vent shaft into the
dirigible. They sneak past two biplanes.
They emerge through a grate near the ceiling. They look down
into the room where the bird is kept in a cage.
CARL
Kevin!
The bird recognizes Carl and CRIES OUT.
CARL
Don't worry Kevin, we're on our
way!
Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs. Carl and Dug duck
into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above.
86.
ALPHA
Allow no one to be entering through
these doors. Guard well that bird,
my minions.
CARL
(WHISPERS)
What do we do now, Dug?
Dug is lost in ecstacy, chomping on a tennis ball on the end
of Carl's cane.
Carl drops down from the ceiling and stands on the cage.
He
bangs his cane. All the dogs turn.
He grabs a ball from his cane and waves it in the air.
CARL
Who wants the ball?
DOGS
Me! I do! I want the ball!
CARL
Then go get it!
Carl throws the ball.
The dogs scramble after it.
The dogs pile into the hallway in pursuit.
DOGS
I'm gonna get there first! Oh gonna
get the ball! I'm gonna get it!
Gamma catches it..
GAMMA
I got it!!
Behind them Carl shuts the door.
The dogs realize their
mistake.
GAMMA
Uh-oh.
87.
Carl opens the cage door.
CARL
I'm sorry Kevin.
Let's get you out
of here.
Muntz scans the horizon.
Suddenly the in-ship communicator
comes to life.
DOG WALLA
(on radio)
Master! He's gone! The old man!
He's here! He's got the bird! The
bird's gone!
MUNTZ
What?
Calm down!
One at a time!
The melee of conflicting reports from the dogs continues.
DOG WALLA
He's in Hall D! He's in Hall B!
It's the old man!
88.
MUNTZ
Does anyone know where they are?!?!
On cue, Russell SPLATS into the dashboard window of the
control room and SQUEEGEES across, dangling from the hose.
Muntz stares, slack-jawed.
RUSSELL
Whoooaaah!
The house floats off.
MUNTZ
(into radio)
Grey leader! Take down the house!
Carl, Dug and the bird escape through the trophy room.
89.
CARL
Come on, Kevin.
Behind the door, Muntz is waiting for them.
He grabs a sword
from the wall display and attacks.
Dug hears and BITES Muntz on the leg.
Muntz kicks Dug loose and out the door.
He slams it shut.
Locked out, Dug jumps on the door and barks.
He hears growling and turns around.
There stands Alpha and
the other dogs.
DUG
Hi.
Dug runs.
The dogs give chase.
Muntz swings his sword at Carl but misses.
Carl uses his
cane to defend himself.
OLD MAN SWORD FIGHT!
Muntz smashes his trophy collection as he swings for Carl.
His sword gets stuck in a mounted skeleton.
Carl swings his cane and hits Muntz on the head. The tennis
balls bounce the cane off Muntz and smack Carl in the face.
Muntz pulls the sword free. He raises the sword over his
head to strike and his back CRACKS loudly. He's stuck! Carl
raises his cane over his head and his back CRACKS too.
Carl and Muntz STRUGGLE to move. Muntz CRACKS his back free
and kicks Carl in the chest, knocking him against a trophy.
He has the upper hand now. He throttles him with his arm and
lifts his sword.
MUNTZ
Any last words, Fredricksen?
Come
on, spit it out!
Carl spits his FALSE TEETH at Muntz.
He falls backwards.
90.
Carl collects his teeth and motions for Kevin.
CARL
Come on!
Muntz advances on Carl, who struggles to protect the bird.
Muntz is a wild man now, smashing and destroying anything
that gets in his way.
MUNTZ
Enough! I'm taking that bird back
with me alive or dead!
Carl trips and falls to the floor.
Muntz is about to deal
the final blow.
Meanwhile Alpha backs Dug into the control panel.
He bumps a
a LEVER.
Muntz is knocked off balance.
He slides to one side.
Trophy
cases slide after him.
The dirigible tilts to the other side.
The broken trophy cases barrel straight toward Carl!
Carl is thrown into a window which bursts open. Carl falls
through but manages to grab the frame with his cane. He
dangles out over open air.
He sees the biplanes circling the house, Russell hanging
beneath it.
The ship corrects again.
Carl climbs back inside.
Muntz comes at Carl.
CARL
Come on, Kevin!
91.
Alpha throws Dug viciously across the room. Alpha throws him
again and Dug crashes into the steering wheel, knocking a
radar shade off the control panel.
Alpha moves in.
Dug hides behind the steering wheel.
ALPHA
I will have many enjoyments for
what I am about to do, Dug.
Alpha lunges at Dug through the steering wheel.
Dug cowers,
but then notices the RADAR SHADE.
As Alpha lunges again, Dug jams the shade over Alpha's head.
Alpha's head is stuck, trapped by the cone.
The dogs all GASP.
MISC DOG
He wears the Cone of Shame!
ALPHA
(high-pitched voice)
What? Do not just continue
sitting! Attack!
The bump caused his collar to go funny again.
The dogs all
howl with laughter.
ALPHA
(high pitched voice)
No! No! Stop your laughing! Get
this off of me!
DUG
Listen you dog!
Sit!
Surprised at Dug's moxy, Alpha sits.
All other dogs sit too.
DOG WALLA
Yes, Alpha.
92.
DUG
Alpha? I am not Alpha, he is-
(REALIZING)
Oohhhh!
Russell, Dug and Kevin back away from the door.
Russell, Dug and Kevin run into the living room.
95.
Confused, Russell follows Carl's directions.
He Dug and the
bird huddle together.
Muntz breaks through the door.
He lifts his rifle and sights
the bird...
Through the window, Carl yells out.
Kevin lunges, pushing past Muntz and knocking the rifle from
his hands.
Muntz lunges after them.
Carl and Russell hold and cuddle the baby birds.
The babies
peck at Carl's head. Carl and Russell LAUGH.
CARL
Ow! Ow! Ow!
RUSSELL
Look at you. You're so soft.
97.
Kevin CALLS OUT, waiting for the babies at the gate to the
LABYRINTH. Time to go.
CARL/RUSSELL
(DISAPPOINTED)
Awwww!
RUSSELL
I wish I could keep one.
The babies run to the bird.
One stops to HISS at Dug.
Carl has misplaced something.
CARL
Huh, where's my cane?
I just had
it here...
Kevin starts HACKING.
She COUGHS up the cane.
Babies start HACKING too.
They COUGH up tennis balls.
CARL
You know what? Keep `em.
A little
gift from me to you.
The bird family enters the labyrinth.
Carl and Russell wave.
RUSSELL
Bye Kevin!
The bird looks back toward Carl and Russell and CALLS OUT one
last time before disappearing into the mist.
Carl and Russell both wear matching leather flight helmets
and goggles.
RUSSELL
Ready?
Carl gives a thumbs up.
CARL
Ready!
98.
CAMP MASTER STRAUCH
...and by receiving their badges,
the following Explorers will
graduate to Senior Explorers.
Each Junior Wilderness Explorer stands next to his father.
As the Camp Master announces the achievement he hands the

CAMP MASTER STRAUCH

(hands badge)
For Assisting the Elderly...
Russell is tanned and dirty.
And alone.
CAMP MASTER STRAUCH
Uh, Russell? Is there... someone
that... uh...
The Camp Master CLEARS HIS THROAT uncomfortably.
Russell
looks for his dad in the audience.
CARL (O.S.)
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Old man
coming through.
Carl takes his place next to Russell.
CARL
(to Camp Master)
I'm here for him.
CAMP MASTER STRAUCH
Congratulations, Russell. Sir...
The Camp Master hands Carl the badge and continues down the
line.
99.
CARL
Russell, for assisting the elderly,
and for performing above and beyond
the call of duty, I would like to
award you the highest honor I can
bestow: The Ellie Badge.
Carl pins the badge onto the missing spot on Russell's sash.
It's Ellie's GRAPE SODA PIN.
RUSSELL
Wow.
Carl smiles.
They salute each other.
Russell gives Carl a hug.
Carl
returns it.
Russell's mom sits in the audience with Dug.
Russell proudly
shows her the badge.
CAMP MASTER STRAUCH
Alright, I think that covers
everybody... So let's give a big
Explorer Call to our brand new
Senior Wilderness Explorers! Ready
everybody?
The Camp Master leads the audience in the WILDERNESS EXPLORER
CALL.
Muntz's dogs sit in the back, BARKING in approval.
DISSOLVE TO:
