      FADE IN:

      EXT. LACROSSE FIELD - NIGHT11

      A GLEAMING WHITE LIGHT floods the night sky. As the brilliant 
      glow focuses into a bank of SPOTLIGHTS over the lacrosse 
      field, a CHANT rises up.

                                  CROWD
                    State! State! State!

      Fists reach into the light, pumping in unison. Amidst the 
      rush of fans crowding the team at the benches, only one face 
      doesn t seem ecstatic over the win: Scott McCall.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT22

      Doors burst open and the still chanting crowd fills the 
      hallway. Scott pushes through, searching for--

                                  SCOTT
                    Stiles? Has anyone seen Stiles?

      He turns and unexpectedly find himself facing Allison. 
      Pressed together in the mob, they look at each other for an 
      awkward second. Scott opens his mouth to speak and--

                                  BRIAN
                    State! State! State!

      His teammate, Brian, screams between them. They both stare 
      blankly at him in annoyance until he finally decides to chant 
      in someone else s face.

                                    ALLISON
                    You were pretty awesome out there.

                                  SCOTT
                    Thanks, you too. I mean--that s not 
                    what I meant.

                                    ALLISON
                    No, I did some pretty awesome 
                    cheering. You can thank me.

                                  SCOTT
                    You did?            TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/112.

        CONTINUED:22

                                    ALLISON
                    Totally. I went from  Go, Team, Go  
                    to  Defense, Defense  without a 
                    breath. I brought my A game.

      The commotion seems to fade around them as Scott can t help 
      but smile at her effort charm him. Until Brian pops back in 
      between--

                                  BRIAN
                    State! State! State!

      Scott shoots a murderous glare at him. Brian shrinks away, 
      allowing Scott to return his attention to Allison. But she s 
      down the hall now, Argent with his arm around her shoulder, 
      gently guiding her out with the rest of the dissipating 
      crowd.

      Gazing after them, Scott doesn t notice Jackson stepping up 
      to whisper in his ear.

                                    JACKSON
                    That s heartbreaking, man. I bet 
                    it s been a lot of sleepless *
                    nights, huh? You. Your hand. A box *
                    of tissues--

      Eyes narrowing, Scott resists responding to the taunts.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    You know what, though, McCall? I 
                    actually sympathize. Which is why 
                    I m going to make this mutually 
                      beneficial. You get me what I want? 
                    I ll help you get her back.

                                  SCOTT
                    What?

                                    JACKSON
                    Three days makes it just in time 
                    for the winter formal. Think about 
                    you taking her instead of me. And 
                    think about all the things you ll 
                    be able to do to get her out of 
                    some tight little dress by the end 
                    of the night. See how this could 
                    work out for all of us?

      He backs away, letting the words sink in.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Three days, McCall.            TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/113.


      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT33

      Stepping out of the steam-filled shower, a deeply troubled 
      Scott pulls a towel around his waist. He passes by Danny who 
      changes into his street clothes at his locker.

                                  DANNY
                    By the way, McCall. Apology 
                    accepted.

                                  SCOTT
                    Um. I didn t apologize.

                                  DANNY
                    Every time you got the ball tonight 
                    you passed it to me.

                                  SCOTT
                    You scored every time I passed to 
                    you.

                                  DANNY
                          (with a nod)
                    Apology accepted.

      Bag slung over his shoulder, Danny heads out. Noticing he s 
      the only one left in the locker room, Scott quickly starts to 
      get dressed. But he s barely zipped up his jeans when--

      He HEARS FOOTSTEPS.

                                  SCOTT
                    Danny?

      No response. Scott peers around the corner, then breathes in 
      relief when he sees Derek.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Thank God. Where the hell have you 
                    been? Do you have any idea what s 
                    been going on?

      He stops when he notices Derek s odd demeanor. Then slowly 
      turns to find SOMEONE standing silhouetted in the darkness. 

      A hand reaches into one of the open lockers to withdraw a 
      LACROSSE STICK.

                                  PETER
                    I don t really get lacrosse. When I 
                    was in high school, we played 
                      basketball. That s a real sport.

                                  PETER (CONT'D)
                    But, I read somewhere that lacrosse 
                    comes from Native American tribes 
                    and that they sometimes played it 
                    to resolve conflicts. Am I right 
                    about that?

      He raises the stick. Breath held, Scott waits for him to snap 
      it in half or send it smashing against the lockers. But Peter 
      just carefully sets it down again.

                                  PETER (CONT D)
                    I ve got a little conflict of my 
                    own to resolve, Scott. But I need 
                    your help to do it.

                                  SCOTT
                    I m not helping you kill people.

                                  PETER
                    I don t want to kill all of them. 
                    Just the responsible ones. Which 
                    doesn t have to include...

      He looks to Derek for help remembering the name.

                                  DEREK
                    Allison.

                                  SCOTT
                      You--You re on his side now? Did 
                    you forget the part where he killed 
                    your sister?

                                  DEREK
                    It was a mistake.

                                  SCOTT
                    What?

                                  DEREK
                    It happens.

      Scott gazes at him in disbelief while Peter steps closer.

                                  PETER
                    I think you re getting the wrong 
                      impression of us, Scott. We really 
                    just want to help you reach your 
                      potential.

                    Sometimes the people closest to you 
                    can be the ones holding you back 
                    the most.

                                  SCOTT
                    If they re holding me back from 
                    becoming a psychotic nutjob like 
                    you, I m okay with that.

      Cornering him, Peter slowly lifts a hand to his face.

                                  PETER
                    Maybe you could try seeing things 
                    from my perspective?

      His hand moves like a cobra striking, latching onto Scott. 
      Fingernails rapidly extending to CLAWS, they sink right into 
      the back of the boy s neck.

      For a brief second, Scott s eyes FLASH YELLOW. Then Peter 
      yanks his hand back, letting him tumble to the floor. 
      Blinking furiously, strange IMAGES FLASH into Scott s head--

      INT. HALE HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK44

      A dark room fills with black smoke, men and women trying to 
      cover their mouths, coughing and screaming as--

      Reddick and Unger, visible through a dirty basement window, 
      toss liquid from five gallon jugs onto the house. They douse 
      the windows, their images BLURRING as--

      Hands desperately grab for a door, trying to push it open 
      while black, roiling smoke covers everything--

      INT. HOSPITAL/PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK55

      Nurses gently lay Peter back onto a hospital bed. One 
      undamaged eye blinks out from a face covered in white gauze 
      bandages.

      Light seeps over his face, the brilliant white glow from a 
      FULL MOON. 

      A now un-bandaged Peter sits up in bed, the moon almost 
      seeming to pull at him, drawing him up to his feet. At the 
      door stands his nurse, Jennifer, watching in astonishment as--

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT - FLASHBACK66

      Someone steps through the woods, boots crushing leaves 
      underneath her. LAURA HALE looks through the shadows to see--            TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/116.

      A STRANGE FIGURE in a hospital robe standing between the 
      trees. He turns around to reveal one half of his face is 
      covered in horrible burns.

                    Peter?

      She steps toward him, reaching for him while he gazes back at 
      her almost in a trance. And then he opens his mouth revealing 
      razor-sharp FANGS as--

      EXT. HALE PROPERTY - NIGHT - FLASHBACK77

      Spiraling down from the night sky, we find Scott and Stiles 
      circling a grave where Laura s body has been unearthed. They 
      gaze into the pit itself, through the pitch black dirt and--

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT88

      Down through a ceiling into the locker room where Scott lies 
      on the floor, eyes snapping open as he GASPS for air.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Main Title: TEEN WOLF

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT99

      Stiles slams through the door, tearing around the corner to 
      find a weary Scott slumped on a bench.

                                  STILES
                    Dude. We have a huge problem.

      INT. ARGENT HOME/ALLISON'S ROOM - NIGHT1010

      Slivers of moonlight stretch across the dark room to 
      Allison s bed where she lies wide awake on her stomach, 
      completely and utterly unable to get to sleep.

      The moment she lets her eyes close a shadow falls over her 
      back. Scott eases up behind her, gently moving her hair aside 
      to softly kiss the nape of her neck when--

      Allison turns over, rolling to her side, once again alone in 
      her room. Until fingers begin tracing lightly up her arm. 
      Next to her, Scott draws his hand up over her shoulder and-- 

      Allison turns again, this time onto her back. She squeezes 
      her eyes closed, trying to shut him out of her imagination.            TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/117.

      CONTINUED:1010

      But a moment later, Scott slips on top of her again, softly 
      touching his lips to her neck, then to the edge of her chin 
      making his way to her lips. She rises to meet his kiss and-- 

      Sits up in the dark, alone and exasperated. Her fingers move 
      to her neck where she imagined him touching her and then...

      She feels around her throat as if something is missing. 
      Something like a necklace.

      Standing, she crosses to her desk to find the book that was 
      holding her necklace lies empty.

      She clicks on the light and begins searching her room, 
      pulling open drawers and looking under pillows, moving more 
      and more frantically. But it s nowhere to be found.

      INT. ARGENT HOME/GARAGE - NIGHT1111

      Allison opens her car door and slips behind the wheel. She 
      feels around the seats, checks the glove compartment. Still 
      nothing.

      THE GARAGE DOOR begins RUMBLING open, surprising her. She 
      yanks the car door closed and slides down out of view.

      Argent and Kate step out of the SUV in mid-conversation.

                                  KATE
                    All I m saying is firing those 
                    things so close by is bound to 
                    attract attention.

      Argent holds up what looks like small pieces of SCRAP METAL.

                                  ARGENT
                    These things have saved my life 
                    more than once.

                    These extra skills are something 
                    you could start teaching your 
                    daughter, you know.

                    Ever?

                                  ARGENT
                    Not. Yet.

      Her lingering at the workbench causes Argent to crane his 
      neck, trying to see what she s doing. 

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    You coming?

      He s about to step back to her when she turns with a smile 
      and follows him inside the house.

      When the door eases closed behind them, Allison waits a 
      moment, then slips out of her car.

      AT THE TRASH CAN she delicately extracts one of the items her 
      father tossed in. 

      It s a METAL CASING, blown out, surface blackened. Allison 
      turns it over in her hand, no idea what it is. Until she 
      looks over at the workbench where Kate lingered.

      Lying right in the middle of it is a cone-shaped FLASH BOLT. 
      Allison matches the spent casing up to compare it to an 
      unused bolt. 

      They re the same.

      Slowly holding the conical FLASH BOLT up to her eyes, she 
      never notices that the door to the kitchen is actually still 
      slightly ajar.

      Standing in the darkness beyond it, Kate watches, clearly 
      pleased to see her niece picking up the clues on the path of 
      discovery to which she s so carefully guiding her.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      FADE IN:

      INT. JACKSON S PORSCHE - DAY1212

      Jackson roars down a desolate stretch of road with HEAVY 
      METAL MUSIC pumped so loud through the speakers that it 
      literally rattles the windows. Too loud for him to hear the 
      engine SPUTTER.

      Speed dropping precipitously, he taps the brakes, then grips 
      the wheel with both hands as it tries to yank from his grasp.

      EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY1313

      The Porsche coasts onto the grass and lumbers to a dead stop. 
      Jackson turns the key several times, but all he hears from 
      the engine is a useless CLICKING.

      Stepping out of the car, he SLAMS the door shut. 

                                    JACKSON
                    Son of a bitch.

      He walks around to the rear of the car where the engine is 
      located, but slows his pace when--

      He notices the odd quiet and isolation. No houses in sight. 
      No other cars on the road.

      Now somewhat nervous, he opens the rear engine compartment. 
      But like most people he just stares at the engine, 
        dumbfounded. Reaching to close it, he hears the sound of 
      another VEHICLE approaching. 

      A familiar SUV pulls to the shoulder of the road just behind *
      his Porsche. Argent steps out and offers a friendly smile.

      EXT. WOODS - DAY1414

      Through a mist-shrouded trail, a shivering Lydia reluctantly 
      follows Allison into the woods.

                                  LYDIA
                    Allison, when you said you need to 
                    stop for an errand before we went 
                    shopping, a five mile hike in the

                    Can you at least tell me what we re

      Allison shifts a heavy black bag on her shoulder as she 
      trudges up the path.

                                    ALLISON
                    Before I forget, I wanted to ask 
                    you if you re okay with something.

                                  LYDIA
                    I ll say yes to anything if it 
                    includes getting out of here.

                                    ALLISON
                    Jackson asked me to go to the 
                    winter formal with him.

      Lydia blinks. Any real reaction remains imperceptible.

                    Did he?

                                    ALLISON
                    Just as friends. But I wanted to 
                    see if you were okay with it first.

      Any emotional reaction still imperceptible, Lydia smiles.

                                  LYDIA
                    Sure. As long it s just friends.

                                    ALLISON
                    Well, yeah. It s not like I m going 
                    to take him under the bleachers 
                    during lacrosse practice and start

      Allison drops the bag and unzips it.

                                    ALLISON
                    We should be good here. It s 
                    isolated enough.

      Inside the bag she reveals a BOW and QUIVER of ARROWS. Lydia 
      looks down at it. Looks around to see the two of them are 
      indeed completely isolated. Then gives a nervous LAUGH.

      EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY1515

      Argent takes a look at the engine at the rear of Jackson s 
      Porsche.

                                    JACKSON
                    It s really okay. I can call for a 
                    tow truck.

                                  ARGENT
                    I know a few things about cars. 
                    Might be something simple.

                                    JACKSON
                    I don t know. This is a pretty 
                    expensive car and there s all that 
                    warranty crap they pull if you do 
                    your own repairs, right?

                                  ARGENT
                    I won t tell if you won t.

      Jackson gazes up at Argent s unnerving smile, clearly not 
      sure how to respond.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    It s Jackson, right? Come here.  
                    I ll show you what to look for.

      He reaches out, hand moving to the middle of Jackson s back 
      to press him forward. But then, with clear calculation, 
      Argent s hand glides up to the back of the boy s neck.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    Oh, I m sorry.

                    No. I mean--It s just a scratch.

                                  ARGENT
                    It looks like more than a scratch.

                                  ARGENT
                    They kind of look like claw marks.

      Jackson turns away from him so he can t see them anymore.

                    I think I should probably just call 
                    a tow truck.

      He reaches into his pocket for his cell phone.

                    tell me what it was that did that?

        relentlessly for an answer.

                    started you out with a nice little 
                    Honda.

      Opening the door to his car, he gives a last look back.

                    Me? I drive a Porsche.

      Slamming the door closed, he sends the car TEARING out of the 
      lot, kicking up DUST at the boys as they look after him.

      EXT. WOODS - DAY1717

      Lydia watches Allison take a normal arrow and twist off the 
      BULLET POINT. She replaces it with the conical FLASH BOLT 
      left to her by Kate.

                                  LYDIA
                    What does that do?

                    We re about to find out.

      She takes a firing position in front of a TARGET pegged to a 
      tree in the distance. Setting the arrow just under the sight, 
      she expertly pulls back on the nocking point of the 
      bowstring. 

      Lydia tenses up as Allison aims. Then lets the bolt SOAR. It 
      EXPLODES AGAINST THE TREE with a BRILLIANT FLASH, strange 
      WHORLS OF LIGHT spinning into the air.

                                  LYDIA
                    What the hell was that?

      Lowering the bow, Allison gazes at the SMOKING, SCORCHED 
      TARGET on the tree and shakes her head.

      EXT. WOODS - DAY1818

      Lydia hugs herself in the cold while Allison comes back to 
      her with the charred target in hand.

                                  LYDIA
                    Well, that was fun. Any other 
                    lethal weapons you want to try out?

      But Allison stops. Cocking her head, she listens to the woods 
      around them. A moment later, they both hear it. MOVEMENT 
      through the brush and leaves.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    What was that?

      But now there s nothing. Not a sound.

                    Hold this.

      She hands the bow to Lydia. 

                                  LYDIA
                    What? Why?

                                    ALLISON
                    I thought I heard something.

                                  LYDIA
                    So what if you heard something?

                                    ALLISON
                    So I want to go find out what that 
                    something is. Don t worry, it s 
                    probably nothing.

      Without another word, Allison takes off, leaving Lydia to 
      look utterly ridiculous while grasping at the weapon with her 
      mittens.

      VENTURING OFF THE TRAIL - Allison moves quickly but quietly.

      SOMETHING slips through the brush just near her. She stops at 
      the sound. Then retreats a step, pulling back against a tree. 
      Breath held, she slowly steps away and--

      SPINS back with the TASER X26 in her hands. She FIRES it, 
      TWIN PRONGS SOARING through the air and landing on--

      Scott. 

      He jerks back and falls to the ground with the STRANGLED CRY 
      of someone being pummeled with 50 thousand volts of 
        electricity.

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott?

      Rushing over, she attempts to pull out the prongs, but he s 
      still convulsing with spasms.

                          (in agony)
                        Finger--trigger--finger.

      Allison notices she still has her finger on the trigger, 
      still sending an electric charge into his shuddering body.

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh!

      She opens her hand, dropping the weapon to the ground. 
      Finally, Scott breathes, his body relaxing into the leaves.

                    I m so, so, so sorry.

                    My fault. Totally my fault.

      He SHUDDERS from the remaining charge still snapping at his

                    I didn t know it was you. If I knew

      He plucks the prongs out of his shirt and skin, wincing in 
      pain. Then, helping gather up the wires and the Taser, he s 
      about to hand it back to her when--

      His body has another UNCONTROLLABLE CONVULSION. The Taser 
      launches right out of his grasp. Allison manages to catch it, 
      glancing back to him with an unsure smile.

                    Oh, thank God. I was starting to

                    No, nope, just lost. Definitely not 
                    stolen. By anyone.

      He watches her slip the pendant around her neck and pull her 
      hair through the chain. When she looks up at him again, he 
      remembers to breathe.

                                    ALLISON
                    Thank you for finding this. And for

      She slips her arms around him to hug him. He holds her back, 
      holding just a little too long. 

      Allison finally breaks away. Trying not to look back, she 
      hurries off, leaving Scott in the woods. Alone again.

      BACK ON THE TRAIL - Lydia glances up in relief. She s been 
      trying to load and nock an arrow, but clearly has no idea 
      what she s doing.

      INT. STILINSKI HOME/KITCHEN - NIGHT1919

      Sheriff Stilinski pours over a stack of CASE FILES on the 
      kitchen table. 

      Stiles tears past, yanks something out of the fridge and 
      disappears back out of the kitchen so quickly you can barely 
      see him.

      Stiles takes the empty glass out of his drunk father s hand 
      before it drops through his flimsy grasp.

                                  STILINSKI

                                  STILES

                                  STILINSKI
                    And why make it all look like some

      drink. As he lifts it up, however, Stiles puts his hand 
      around it, gently setting it down.

      Scott and Allison sit on the edge of his bed, not talking. Or 
      even looking at each other. Finally, Scott turns to her.

      Allison still doesn t say anything.

                    stop talking so that he can start 
                    again.

                    Scott! Get the door!

      But he stands there paralyzed, eyes locked on the knob, hand 
      beginning to tremble. He takes a step back.

      THE DOORBELL RINGS again.

                    Scott, for the love of God!

      The KNOB slowly turns on its own. Scott reaches for the 
      deadbolt to lock the door. But just as he s about to grasp it 
      THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN TO REVEAL--

      Nothing. The porch lies empty. Scott turns back to see his 
      mother glance out from around the corner.

                    going to invite him in?

      Scott whirls back to find Peter Hale standing right outside 
      the house.

      Scott stares in disbelief at Peter Hale standing across the

                    Be back in half a minute.

      As she disappears into the house, Scott grabs the knob again, 
      moving to yank it closed. But Peter puts a hand on the door.

                                  PETER
                    Really? Slam the door in my face? 
                    Come on, Scott, take a second to 
                    think that through.

      Peter inches toward Scott.

                    in World War II were the German U-
                    Boat attacks? Know what they called 
                    them? Wolf Packs. Did you know 
                    that? Or are you failing History

                                  SCOTT
                    I know the Germans lost the war.

      Peter smiles at Scott s jab, enjoying it.

                                  PETER
                    Most people would argue that as a 
                    failure of leadership. Trust me, we 
                    don t have that problem here.

      Pulling her coat on, Melissa hurries back out to join them.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT2525

      Thundering HEAVY METAL blasts from an iPod sitting docked in 
      a speaker. Just a few feet beyond the rattling lockers, 
      Jackson pushes a barbell up on a bench press.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1134.

      Racking it, he immediately gets up and grabs two dumbbells 
      for hammer curls. Pushing himself as hard as he can, he grits 
      his teeth on the last rep. Muscles straining through his tank 
      top, he struggles to get the dumbbell up to his chest.

      The MUSIC stops. Jackson blinks, the weight coming down. He 
      drops both dumbbells to the floor.

                                    JACKSON
                    What the hell, dude?

      No response comes. He leans back, trying to see around the 
      locker to his iPod speaker and whoever turned it off.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Hey--

      He stops, seeing a tall figure in a black leather jacket 
      standing over the iPod speaker.

                                  DEREK
                    I like your taste in music.

      Jackson holds still, sweat rolling down his forehead.

                    I haven t heard this one in a long 
                    time.

      Derek presses PLAY. When he turns around he finds Jackson 
      holding a lacrosse stick like a bat, ready to defend himself.

      MUSIC hammering through the locker room, Derek slowly 
      approaches.

                                    JACKSON
                    I m not scared of you.

                                  DEREK
                    Yeah, you are. I don t think you ve 
                    had a day in your life where you 
                    weren t scared of something. But 
                    you won t be scared anymore. Not 
                    when you re one of us.

      Jackson lowers the lacrosse stick. A smile at his lips.

      Derek follows Jackson out of the locker room. The second they

      slips out of the shadows and into view...

      Kate. Watching with interest as the two of them leave.

      takes out her phone. But while tapping her thumbs on the 
      screen, she looks up to find him staring at her.

      forward. Melissa SCREAMS in surprise.

      Head snapped forward, Peter looks back up to reveal his eyes 
      are back to normal. They both glance to the rear window to

      EXT. HALE PROPERTY - NIGHT3131

      Jackson walks just ahead of Derek. His excited anticipation, 
      however, seems to lessen with every step forward.*

                    rafters falling on my head.

      Jackson takes a hard swallow, then inches his way up the 
      steps. He glances back yet again. But Derek simply nods him 
      onward.

      Reaching for the doorknob, Jackson pauses to notice just how 
      badly his hand trembles.

      Hand on the knob, Jackson turns it and slowly pushes the door 
      open. He doesn t step in yet, trying to peer into the 
      darkness. But he can t seem to make anything out inside.

      A creak of a floorboard makes him flinch. Derek steps up 
      behind him, his voice soft. Friendly.

                    It s going to be all right. Trust 
                    me.

      Finally, Jackson steps over the threshold.

      INT. HALE HOUSE - NIGHT3232

      Jackson walks deeper into the charred house. Apprehension 
      turns to confusion as he gazes about.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1140.

                                    JACKSON
                    This house...

      He s so entranced by the staircase and rooms before him, he 
      doesn't see Derek s fingers spread, CLAWS out.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    This is the same house.

      Derek abruptly stops.

                                  DEREK
                    What did you say?

                                    JACKSON
                    I dreamt about this place.

      He steps into what was once the living room, now blackened 
      and empty. His hand drifts to the SCRATCHES on the back of *
      his neck as he speaks.*

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                      I remember the couch. That lamp. I 
                      remember... everything.

                                  DEREK
                    You ve been here?

                                    JACKSON
                    No. Never. I dreamt it.

      Hands lightly touching the furniture, he stops. Then slowly 
      turns back around, eyes meeting Derek s.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    There s no one else here.

                                  DEREK
                    No.

                                    JACKSON
                    And no one else coming.

                                  DEREK
                    No.

      Lower lip beginning to tremble, Jackson bites it back. But 
      when he looks up he can t hide the fear.

                                    JACKSON
                    Please, don t. I ll shut up. I 
                    won t say anything ever again.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1141.

      Derek starts forward. But he seems to be having trouble 
      holding Jackson s gaze as if his resolve is weakening.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    I ll leave Scott alone. Please 
                    don t do this. Oh my God, please.

      Jackson begins backing toward the entrance. He doesn t see 
      the stairs behind him and stumbles into them.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Come on, please don t. I don t 
                    deserve this. I don t deserve it.

                                  DEREK
                    I think you do. Because wouldn t 
                    there be someone trying to save 
                    you? Look around, Jackson. There s 
                    no one. No one cares that you drive 
                    an expensive car. No one cares 
                    about your perfect hair. And no one 
                    cares that you re Captain of the 
                    lacrosse team.

                                  SCOTT
                    Excuse me.

      Derek s head snaps up to see Scott perched at the top of the 
      stairs. 

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                      Co-Captain.

      He LAUNCHES himself down the stairs, TRANSFORMING in mid-
      flight, SNARLING through sharpening fangs and dragging Derek 
      to the floor right in front of a stunned Jackson. 

      Rolling to his feet, Scott takes a protective stance in front 
      of Jackson who looks on him in his transformed state with a 
      mixture of fear and awe.

      Derek looks up, now also transformed and baring his fangs.

                                  DEREK
                    Move.

                    No.

      CONTINUED:3232

      Jackson cowers back in the shadows, moving to the side of the 
      stairs as the two werewolves circle each other until--

      They both stop, both seeming to sense something. They hear 
      it. A strange WHISTLING SOUND. Something SOARING through the 
      air.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Cover your eyes--

      A FLASH BOLT blasts inside the house and explodes with a 
      BLINDING LIGHT.

      It s followed by a volley of GUNSHOTS. Jackson SCREAMS out as 
      both Scott and Derek take hits.

      Scott tumbles to the FLOOR hollering in pain. As he rolls 
      over onto his back he looks at his stomach in terror. SMOKE 
      WAFTS UP from the wound. He s been hit with a wolfsbane 
      bullet.

      He blinks up at Derek who has taken cover behind a column.

                                  DEREK (CONT D)
                    Go.

      Then, without another word, Derek spins into a new round of 
      GUNFIRE and goes right out the door to face the hunters 
      himself.

      EXT. HALE PROPERTY - NIGHT3333

      Jackson runs for his life, charging blindly into the 
      darkness. He never looks back to see Scott stumbling after 
      him.

      INT. MCCALL HOME/SCOTT S ROOM - NIGHT3434

      Sitting there in Scott s room, still waiting and ever 
      patient, Allison checks the time on her cell phone.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT3535

      Still running, still trying to escape deeper into the woods, 
      Scott finally tumbles to his knees. He lurches up, BLACK 
      LIQUID at his lips. His body trying to heal itself. Trying 
      and failing.

      Crawling forward, he pushes himself up from the leaves and 
      dirt making one last attempt to get back to his feet. 

      But then he falls forward again. Rolling slowly onto his 
      back, the world above starts to blur.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1143.

      Darkness begins to creep in on his peripheral vision.

      Finally, Allison stands, pulling her jacket back on. Slowly, 
        reluctantly, she walks out the door.

      EXT. WOODS - NIGHT3737

      Scott s eyes continue to blink as he fights to stay 
      conscious. But then he sees something above him. The DARK 
      SILHOUETTE of a man gazing down at him.

      Limbs weak, Scott reaches up. But his eyelids flutter and the 
      world goes dark around him. When he opens his eyes again, 
      trees are moving past him.

                                  SCOTT
                    Stop...

      Whoever carries him speaks, his VOICE DISTANT and WHISPERY.

      INT. ANIMAL CLINIC - NIGHT3838

      Scott jolts awake. He squints, blinded by the FLORESCENT 
      LIGHT blazing down on him. Then hears the CLINK of METAL.

      Nearby, a BULLET SLUG now lies at the bottom of a steel tin. 
      His boss, Dr. Deaton, steps over to smile down at him.

                    Ours are a little different.

      Allison gazes past her to where Derek stands shackled to a 
      grid of pipes, his head bent low. When he raises his eyes, 
      they re GLOWING an ice-cold blue.

      Fully transformed and chained up like a dog, Derek opens his 
      mouth wide and ROARS THROUGH HIS FANGS at the two female 
      Argents.
