      PUSH IN on a car s wiper blade. Underneath it, a half-dozen 
      parking tickets. We drift past the tickets, coming around to 
      the driver s-side window, where we find an orange  FINAL 
      VIOLATION  sticker, that reads:  This car will be towed.  

      A tow truck hooks to the car, lifting it up.

      From inside the car, we see the TOW TRUCK OPERATOR get back 
      into his cab. CAMERA DRIFTS DOWN, past the dash, to reveal...

    A MAN S BODY slumped over, head-down in the front passenger 
      footwell.

      His head is encased in a plastic bag, wrapped with duct tape 
      at the neck. The body jerks up, as the car is pulled by the 
      tow truck out into traffic.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CASTLE'S LOFT, CASTLE S OFFICE - DAY22

      CASTLE sits at his desk across from CLARK MURRAY, mid-50s. 
      Clark is showing Castle morgue photos of a WOMAN s midsection 
      presenting multiple stab wounds. The photos are labeled: 
       JOHANNA BECKETT. 

                                  MURRAY
                      A stabbing, Rick? Isn t that a 
                    little pedestrian for you? Usually 
                    when you call me, it s to ask what 
                    happens if you put a head in a 
                      microwave.

                                  CASTLE
                    This one s a little less made-up. 
                    The victim was the mother of the 
                    detective I ve been following. 

                                  MURRAY

                                  CASTLE
                    The case has been cold ten years. I 
                    figured, since you re the best 
                    forensic pathologist in the city, 
                    you might find something they 
                    missed. CASTLE Ep. 110 "A Death in the Family"  Full White Draft   2-19-09    2.


                                  MURRAY
                    You know reality isn t fiction, 
                    right? The odds of finding anyone s 
                    killer after ten years are... 

                                  CASTLE
                      Astronomical. I know. But I d 
                      appreciate it if you could take a 
                    look.

      Castle rises.

                                  MURRAY
                    I ll do what I can, but don t make 
                    any promises that I can t keep. 

      Murray gathers up the material as Castle escorts him from his 
      office.

      As Murray heads toward the door, Castle hears from behind him:

                    It sounded like you were looking 
                    into Detective Beckett s mother s

                    I wasn t eavesdropping. I just

                    What s the point in telling her

                                  MARTHA
                    Did you ever stop to think that you 
                    might be invading her privacy?

                    It s not like I m looking through 
                    her underwear drawer. I m trying to

      Just then, the front door opens and ALEXIS enters with a huge

                    and notify next of kin, see how

                    never goes that far north. He 
                    always takes the Midtown tunnel to

                    an awfully long time.

      INT. DOCTOR S OFFICE, RECEPTION - MOMENTS LATER1111

      Beckett and Castle are in reception with Nurse Guerrera and 
      two other nurses: JULIA HAMMOND, late-40s, and MAGGIE DOWD, 
      late-20s.

                                  JULIA
                    It wasn t like him to disappear. I 
                    think, deep down, we all knew 
                    something was wrong.

                                  MAGGIE
                    We hoped maybe... I don t know.

                                  MARIO
                    I can t believe he s dead.

                                    BECKETT
                    Before he disappeared, did he seem 
                    agitated at all?

                                  JULIA
                    It was pretty much business as 
                    usual. 

                                  MARIO
                    Except for the wedding. We were 
                    trying to clear his schedule for 
                    the honeymoon... Maggie thought 
                    maybe he got cold feet.

                                  MAGGIE
                    It s just, why else would he 
                      disappear?

                                    BECKETT
                    When was the last time you saw him?

                                  JULIA
                    Last Tuesday. He was going to meet 
                    his fianc e, Courtney.

                    When was that?CASTLE Ep. 110 "A Death in the Family"  Full White Draft   2-19-09    14.


                                  MARIO
                    He left around 5:30.

                                  MAGGIE
                    When I called at six to give him 
                    messages, he was fine. He said he 
                    was in traffic at the tunnel.

                                    BECKETT
                    He d left Manhattan.

                          (to Beckett)
                    So why d he come back?

                                    BECKETT
                    Did Dr. Leeds have any enemies, 
                    anyone he operated on who had 
                      complications or bad experiences? 
                    Anyone who wasn t happy with the 
                    outcome?

                                  JULIA
                    None of Dr. Leeds s patients have 
                    ever had medical complications.

                                  MARIO
                    That doesn t mean they were always 
                    happy.

                                    BECKETT
                    What do you mean?

                                  MARIO
                    Cosmetic surgery is about self-
                    image. For some people, it changes 
                    their lives. For others, nothing is 
                    ever enough.

                                    BECKETT
                    Did any of them ever threaten him 
                    in any way?

      They exchange looks. Then Julia crosses to the patient files 
      and pulls one.

                                  JULIA
                    One... Jacey Goldberg. She was a

                    She wanted a face-lift.

                                    BECKETT
                    So?

                    So, she d already had three. Dr. 
                    Leeds refused to perform the 
                      operation.

                    She sued. It was thrown out of 
                    court, of course. That s when the 
                    threats started. 

                                    BECKETT
                    What kind of threats?

                                  JULIA
                    She said she was going to ruin his 
                    life.

                    She d just ramble, y know. I mean, 
                    she d totally lost it. After a 
                    while, it just became funny. We 
                    never thought...

      Julia offers a PICTURE of JACEY GOLDBERG, late-40s. She s had 
      so much work, it almost looks like her face isn t real. She 
      looks kind of like a cat.

                    You recently sued him for

                    That s correct.

      Beckett reads from the lawsuit:

                    For refusing to perform elective

                      face-lift, facial implants, and

                    I assure you, each procedure was

                                  JACEY GOLDBERG

      INT. BOUTIQUE, DRESSING AREA - DAY1717

      Several dresses are on a rack. Alexis steps out of the 
      dressing room, wearing a prom dress. She s feeling just a 
      little awkward.

                    You look beautiful.

      Alexis is exasperated.

                                  ALEXIS
                    You say that about every dress. 
                    Don t you think this makes me look

                    Sweetie, no matter how you think you 
                    look, I want you to know that you re 
                    perfect, exactly the way you are.

      She  grrrs  in frustration.

                                  ALEXIS
                    You re not helping.

      Martha enters, holding another dress.

                    Thank you!

      Alexis disappears back into the dressing room.

                    Our ears are funny looking, our

                    and the right makeup hides the 
                    flaws we think we have. They make 
                    us look beautiful to ourselves, and 
                    that s what makes us look beautiful 
                    to others.

      Castle shakes his head.

                                  CASTLE
                    It used to be that all she needed 
                    to feel beautiful was a pink tutu 
                    and a plastic tiara.

                                  MARTHA
                    We spend our whole lives trying to 
                    feel that way again.

      And now Alexis emerges from the dressing room, and this time, 
      the dress really is gorgeous. Youthful, sweet, demure.

                                  ALEXIS
                    What do you think?

      Castle and Martha share a look:  It s perfect. 

                                  CASTLE
                    I think it s you.

                    You know, the time-honored hazing 
                    that occurs in those few moments 
                    that he and I have alone before my 
                    daughter descends the stairs.

                                  RYAN
                      I remember the terror of meeting my 
                    date s old man.

                                  CASTLE

                    Checked my wallet for condoms and 
                    showed me his gun collection. My 
                    hands were shaking so hard I could 
                    barely put on the corsage.

                    All these years I thought he was

      BARFLIES planted on stools. In the back corner booth, set up 
      as his office, SAL TENOR, Italian, mid-50s, goes over a stack 
      of paperwork.

      As Castle approaches, a HEAVY grabs Castle, twists his hand,

                    thing, being a writer working with

      EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY2828

      Beckett leans against a car outside an office building, 
      holding a brown bag and a coffee. She watches as WILL 
      SORENSON comes out of the building and approaches the car. 

                                  SORENSON
                    Well this is a nice surprise. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Hopefully this will be, too. 

      She hands him the brown bag. He looks inside. 

                                  SORENSON
                    Am I really that predictable? 

      He pulls out a rainbow sprinkle doughnut and smiles. 

                                    BECKETT
                    Maybe I just know you too well.

                                  SORENSON
                    Yeah, I d never hear the end of it. 

      He starts to split the doughnut in half. 

                                    BECKETT
                    No, you eat it. I m not really into 
                    sprinkles anymore... 

      He looks disappointed. 

                                  SORENSON
                    Right. So you re buttering me up, 
                    or should I say  sugaring me up ? 
                    Is this the part where you ask me

                    To talk to Jimmy Moran. 

                                  SORENSON
                    Jimmy Moran? The mobster?
                          (off her look:  yeah )
                    What makes you think I can help 
                    with that?

                                    BECKETT
                    Because the FBI and the U.S. 
                      Attorney s Office have him in 
                    Witness Protection.

                                  SORENSON
                    And you know this how?

                    Word on the street.

      Sorenson sighs.

                                  SORENSON
                    Look, even if it s true, I don t 
                    work organized crime cases.

                                    BECKETT
                    No. But we both know how this 
                    works. You reach out to the agent 
                    in charge, he talks to the AUSA 
                    running the case, and I get to talk 
                    to Jimmy Moran.

                                  SORENSON
                          (smiles, shakes his head)
                    And I do this for you, why? 

                                    BECKETT
                    Let me put it another way: the 
                    Spolanos know that Jimmy Moran s 
                      cooperating with the government. We 
                    know they want him dead, because 
                    they murdered the surgeon you Feds 
                    hired to change his face.

      A door BUZZER sounds. Castle emerges from his office wearing 
      a BLOODY LAB COAT and holding a prop Halloween SEVERED HEAD. 

      Alexis comes rushing down the stairs in her prom dress, 
      looking beautiful.

                                  ALEXIS

      Martha comes in from the kitchen. 

                                  MARTHA
                    Really, Richard.

                                  CASTLE
                    All right. All right.

      Castle pulls off his bloody lab coat and tosses it and the 
      severed head into his office. Alexis crosses to the door and 
      opens it, revealing her date, OWEN, dressed in a tux and 
      holding a corsage. He s a little shy and awkward, and gives 
      off the air of a newborn puppy.

                                  ALEXIS
                    Hi.

                                  ALEXIS
                    Thanks. You, too.

      Castle and Martha appear behind Alexis. Castle has his 
      FlipCam out and is filming.

                    Well, don t you two look just 
                    adorable. And a corsage.

      Owen opens the corsage box.

                                  OWEN
                    Here. It goes on your wrist.

      He takes the corsage out and slides it on her wrist. Martha 
      takes the plastic box.

                                  MARTHA
                    It s beautiful.

      Alexis takes Owen s hand.

                    Okay, sweetie. Have fun, don t do 
                    anything I would do.

      And she and Owen get the hell out of the apartment, leaving 
      Castle with Martha. Castle closes the door behind them.

                    Mr. Moran. I m Detective Beckett. 
                    This is Richard Castle.

                    Richard Castle? Like the novelist?

                    Look, I already told the Feds

                    We re not here about the Spolanos. 
                    We re here about Dr. Leeds, the man

                    He was found murdered last week.

                    Maggie Dowd was at dinner with 
                    friends. Mario Guerrero worked late 
                    packing patient files. And the 
                    senior nurse, Julia Hammond, claims 
                    she was home alone.

                                    BECKETT

      INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS4747

      Maggie crosses to the bed where Jimmy  the Rat  Moran lies 
      half-conscious with tubes and IVs coming out of him. The EKG 
      beeps a steady rhythm.

                    the way.

      Moran, in a morphine haze, sees Maggie. We register a flicker 
      of panic in his eyes. From her pocket, Maggie removes a 
      syringe and a vial. She stabs the vial and draws up the 
      liquid. His EKG starts to speed up.

                    the trick.

      Maggie walks over to Moran s IV tap and sticks the needle in. 
      She presses the plunger, releasing the medication into the IV 
      tube. Then she leans in close to Moran. His eyes track hers.

                    Works at a hospital in Seattle. She 
                    had no idea her identity d been 
                    stolen. Carla even pulled 
                      recommendations for her off a job-
                    hunting site to get the position 
                    with Leeds a few months back. She 
                    was hoping to find pictures of 
                    Moran, and when she didn t, she 
                    went after Leeds.

                    And when he didn t talk, she killed 
                    him. But why stay on at the office?

                                    BECKETT
                    If she d left before Leeds s body 
                    was found, it would ve seemed 
                      suspicious. She probably didn t 
                    think he d be sitting there for a 
                    week. Then, when we showed up, she 
                    waited to see how far we d get. CASTLE Ep. 110 "A Death in the Family"  Full White Draft   2-19-09    57.

                    Good work, Detective. Very good 
                    work.

                                    BECKETT
                    I never thought I d be saying this, 
                    but I couldn t have done it without 
                    Castle, sir.

                    Where is Castle, anyway?

      On Beckett. She doesn t know.

      INT. CASTLE S LOFT, CASTLE S OFFICE - DAY4949

      Castle is with Murray, huddled over autopsy photos of Johanna 
      Beckett. 

                                  MURRAY
                    The original M.E. concluded that 
                    the stab wounds were random. Now 
                    maybe the killer got lucky, but see 
                    this wound here?

                                  CASTLE
                    Yeah.

                                  MURRAY
                    It s a low-angle thrust to the 
                    kidney. Wound size indicates that 
                    the knife was twisted. Her body 
                    would ve gone into immediate shock.

                                  CASTLE
                    And these others?

                                  MURRAY
                    Their angle indicates they were 
                    delivered after she was immobilized 
                    and on the ground. They re just for 
                    show. This is the one that killed 
                    her.

                                  CASTLE
                    This sounds less like a random 
                    killing and more like a targeted 
                    murder.CASTLE Ep. 110 "A Death in the Family"  Full White Draft   2-19-09    58.


                                  MURRAY
                    There s more. On a hunch, I checked 
                    the City M.E. files to see if this 
                    was an isolated incident and found 
                    three other stabbings around that 
                    time, which the M.E. working the 
                    case dismissed as random.

                                  CASTLE
                    Were they related?

      Off Murray s look, we know it s something significant.

                                  MURRAY
                    Are you sure you want to know?

                    Do you know what this will do to

                    The information you have could lead 
                    to her mother s killer. You can t 
                    keep that from her.

                                  CASTLE
                    I know. But she said if I opened 
                    the file that we d be through.

                                  MARTHA
                    It doesn t matter. She has to know.

      Off Castle, torn.

      Laughter. We find Beckett sitting bedside next to Sorenson.

                                  SORENSON
                    No, you didn t.

                                    BECKETT
                    I totally did. And the guys came 
                    in, and he was like,  Where did all 
                    the goldfish come from? 

      Sorenson laughs and winces simultaneously.CASTLE Ep. 110 "A Death in the Family"  Full White Draft   2-19-09    59.


                                  SORENSON
                    Stop making me laugh.

                                    BECKETT
                    Oh, please. It s not like you got 
                    shot.

      They both laugh as Beckett picks up the remaining half of a 
      rainbow sprinkle doughnut from his tray and takes a bite.

                                  SORENSON
                    Hey, I thought you were over 
                      sprinkles.

      She smiles mischievously at him and shrugs.

                                    BECKETT
                    Maybe not.

      Just then, there s a knock on the door. It s Castle.
