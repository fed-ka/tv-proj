      CHYRON: One Month Later

      Tillman exits the Prison Industries building to empty a scrap- 
      metal bin in a dumpster.  As soon as he s outside, he looks 
      over at a FOOD SERVICE TRUCK across the area.  

      ANGLE ON: Two food service EMPLOYEES bullshittingwith the 
      three GUARDS on duty.  This is it.  Tillman reaches inside 
    the bin and removes a thick stack of 30 license plates.  

    He hustles to the service truck.  Once there, he unfolds the 
      licenses.  They ve been hinged together and painted dark grey.                                                                                      2.


      Shoulder/ankle straps enable him to slip on this crudely-
      fashioned half-suit of armor.  He hits the ground and slides 
      under the truck.  TIME CUT TO:



    The food service truck slows at the gate.  A GUARD uses an 
      extended mirror to inspect the truck s undercarriage.  

      ANGLE ON Tillman, holding himself parallel under the truck, 
      just like he practiced.  But the Guard sees nothing but metal.  
    He waves the truck on.  The driver beeps goodbye, drives off.



    The truck stops at a light.  The MALE DRIVER whistles 
      pleasantly.  His FEMALE COWORKER rides shotgun.  They hear a 
      loud CLANG outside, look at each other curiously.  

                                  MALE DRIVER
                    What the hell was that?

    He reaches for the door handle to check it out just as the 
      grease-covered Tillman busts through the window.  As the 
      female employee SCREAMS we MATCH CUT TO:



      CHYRON:  Rahway State Prison - Avenel, N.J.

      Four TOUGH CONS play cards while a SLIGHTLY-BUILT CON acts as 
    a cabana boy.  Emptying their ashtrays and filling their 
      drinks.  One con taps his ash onto the slight con s forearm.

                                  TOUGH CON #1
                    Raise you two.

    The slight con shakes his head.  Bad bet.  A GUARD approaches.

                                  RAHWAY GUARD
                    Lowery.

      ANGLE ON the SLIGHT CONVICT: LLOYD LOWERY, 38, White, former 
      child prodigy.

                                  RAHWAY GUARD (CONT D)
                    Pack it up.  You re shipping out.

                                  LLOYD
                    Out of here?

    The guard nods.  A beat, then Lloyd DUMPS the bucket of sand 
    and cigarette butts in the middle of the poker table.

                                  LLOYD (CONT D)
                    Ciao, bitches.

    The TOUGH CONS jump up, pissed.As Lloyd is escorted off by 
    the Guard, we PRE-LAP a rough but enthusiastic rock band--

      Squad and unmarked cars parked in front -- police tape holds 
      back the neighbors.  A rentalSUVpulls up.  Our team hops 
    out -- Shea, Lloyd and Philly now dressed in ND clothes.

      CHYRON:  Baltimore, Maryland



      Tillman reaches behind the front seat, pulls out the license 
      plates he used to escape.  They serve a second purpose.  He 
      clips one free with tin snips, grabs a screwdriver, then 
      replaces his license plate with a  new  one.



      Graham reviews the police report at an outdoor table.  Charlie 
      paces, on hold with Julianne.  Lloyd reclines on a chaise, 
      searching Phelps  laptop.  Philly exits the house ...

                                  PHILLY
                    This is a hustler s house.  Plain 
                    on the outside -- top-of-the-line 
                    everything on the inside.                                                                                    12.


                                  LLOYD
                    Might be right.  Nothing on his 
                    laptop shows any kind of employment.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Wow, that s some expert insight.  
                    Thank God you guys were pulled out

      Graham spots Shea emerging from the house, holding a BIG BOX.  

                                  GRAHAM (CONT D)
                    -- oh, and the gang-bangerhas 
                    started looting the joint.  What s 
                    that?  A stereo?

    As Shea drops the box on the outdoor table...

                                  CHARLIE
                    What?

                                  SHEA
                    Found it in the back closet.  
                    Unless Phelps was a tranny, he was 
                    usin this for the acetone to take 
                    off ink from the dye pack they put 
                    in the cash when you rob a bank.  
                    Works like a charm.  We need to be

                    You get all that, Julianne?  

      Shea takes a small plastic sleeve of cookies from the top of 
    the box, pops one in his mouth.

                                  GRAHAM
                    What the hell is that?

                                  SHEA

                    Shirley, New York.

    All four turn to Charlie, who holds his finger up for them to 
      wait for more as he listens to Julianne on the line.

                                  CHARLIE (INTO PHONE) (CONT D)
                    I m going to put you on speaker.

      Charlie puts the phone on the table.  Silence.  Graham snaps 
    his fingers twice.

                                  GRAHAM
                    You re on, Jules.

                    for that bar fight.  This was a year 
                    and a half ago.  Right around the 
                    time of an unsolved bank robbery in 
                    Shirley for 100 thousand dollars.  
                    Three suspects.  Never caught.

      CLICK.  After a beat --

                                  PHILLY
                    Three suspects in the robbery.  We

                    We need a yearbook.  
                          (beat)
                    But you were about to say the same 
                    thing, right Graham?

    She takes one of Shea s cookies, bites it with a flourish.  



      CHYRON:  Atlantic City, New Jersey

      Charlie, Graham and Shea exit the SUV.  Philly and Lloyd are 
      still in the car.

                                  PHILLY
                    Can you leave the keys so we can 
                    listen to the radio?

                                  CHARLIE
                    No.

                                  PHILLY
                    We re not gonnarun, Charlie.

                                  CHARLIE
                    I know you won t. 
                          (toLloyd)
                    We re five blocks from the casinos, 
                    Lloyd.  I sent every one a photo of 
                    your ugly kisser.  You wouldn t make 
                    it past the first slot machine.



      Graham rings the door bell and knocks.  Charlie and Shea are 
      trying to get a peek inside, but no dice, shades are pulled.  

      ANGLE: a neighborhood kid watches from the sidewalk.  After a 
      beat, he bolts away on his skateboard.

                                  SHEA
                    The TV s on.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Really?  You re sure he s not just 
                    friends with Pat Sajak?

                                  SHEA
                    Didn t think it was possible, but in 
                    the three years since you busted me 
                    you ve become an even biggerprick.  

      Charlie hands Shea a lock pick.

                                  CHARLIE
                    Door was open.  We let ourselves in.

      Shea starts to work the front door lock.                                                                                    19.



      Charlie and Graham at the front door.  Graham knocks.  A BIG
      dude, CAZ, answers the door.

                                  CHARLIE
                          (flashes his badge)
                    Deputy Charlie DuChamp.We d like 
                    to talk to Sarah O'Leary.

                                  CAZ
                    About?

                                  CHARLIE
                    The Shirley bank robbery.  Is that 
                    a problem?

                                  CAZ
                    She s already been questioned.

    As Graham opens the door and steps in...

                                  GRAHAM
                    Not by us.  May we?

                                  CAZ
                    Doesn t look like I have a choice.



      Philly, Shea and Lloyd -- who points at Sarah s passing car.

                                  LLOYD
                    That s the teller!  

      Philly looks up at Sarah s house.

                                  PHILLY
                    Where the hell are they?

      Just then, the entwined mass of Charlie, Graham and Caz bursts 
      through the front window and onto the lawn.

                                  LLOYD
                    Who are we rooting for?

                                  PHILLY
                    Shea, dosomething.

                                  SHEA (O.S.)
                    I am.

      ANGLE:  Shea s hot-wiring the car.  As it roars to life --

                                  SHEA (CONT D)
                    They can handle themselves.
                          (throwingit in gear)
                    We need that chick.

      SCREECH-- as Shea peels out.



      Shea s a sickdriver.  He spots Sarah ahead, floors it, 
      weaves through traffic.  Philly holds on tight as Lloyd curls 
    up in the fetal position in the backseat.                                                                                    27.


      SARAH O LEARY, 27, spots Shea giving chase - cuts through a 
    gas station.  Shea jerks the wheel, slicing through 3 lanes 
    of traffic to keep up.  Philly buckles herself in.

      Shea soon pulls alongside Sarah, both going at least 75.  He 
      wedges her between his car and concrete construction barriers
      lining the shoulder.  Sarah has nowhere to go.  

                                  SHEA
                    Where ya goin now?!

      Philly looks - they re racing toward the massive steel 
      abutment of Hell Gate Bridge which spans the East River.

                                  PHILLY
                    We re gonnarun into the bridge!

                                  SHEA
                    We won t.  Shewill!

    The cars race closer and closer - only 50 yards away now.

                                  PHILLY
                    You re gonnakill her!

                                  SHEA
                    Or she ll stop!  Her choice!

    The bridge gets closer.  Philly closes her eyes tight, then: 
      SCREECH!  Sarah slams on the brakes.  So does Shea.  Both cars 
      smoke to a halt, just feet from the abutment.  Shea hops out 
    of the car, approaches a spent Sarah.

                                  SARAH
                    I hate you cops.

                                  SHEA
                    Oh, I ain t a cop.

    OFF Sarah, confused.



      Shea s in a private nook outside the offices. On his cell.

                                  SHEA (INTO PHONE)
                    They say a month for every 
                    fugitive, so we catch twelve
                    runners and I only get a year off.

                                  TIA (O.S.)
                    That s right.  So bust your ass for 
                    these guys.



      Charlie and Graham approach this working-class, non-trendy 
      pub.  The TowneLounge.

      CHYRON:  Richmond, Virginia



      POVof a TRUCK idling in the parking lot; REVEAL Shea watches 
    the truck from the railing.  He scans the parking lot -- he s 
      contemplating it. THEN, Lloyd steps into frame behind Shea, 
      observes him for a beat, then...

                                  LLOYD
                    Let me tell you about a study I did 
                    when I was teaching at the 
                    University - I gave five-year-olds
                    a choice between a nickel today or 
                    a dime tomorrow. They all took the 
                    nickel.  Point is, children have a 
                    hard time delaying gratification. 
                    And, if we re being intellectually 
                    honest, so do your people.

                                  SHEA

                    blingand new rims.

                    You re a straight up racist.

                                  LLOYD
                    I m a factist, and the factisI 
                    see in your eyes that you re 
                      contemplating jumping on that truck 
                    and making a run.  Don t take the 
                    nickel dummy.Let s ride this out, 
                    finish our time; then we can all be 
                    free at last, free at last.

                                  SHEA
                    This how you wanna spend the next 
                    10 years?  Charlie and Graham 
                    keeping you on a leash?  

      Lloyd steps to Shea, actually gets up in his face a bit.                                                                                    39.


                                  LLOYD
                    I want a shiny dime, pal! And I 
                    didn t get 10 years - I got 25. And 
                    it s a helluvalot different inside 
                    for a guy like me than it is for 
                    you. And I m not going back.

      Beat - Shea s taken aback by this information.

                                  SHEA
                    25 years?What the hell dyou do?

      Lloyd looks away, his demeanor changes.

                                  LLOYD
                    None of your business.

    The sound of the truck pulling away makes them look back.

                                  LLOYD (CONT D)
                    And there goes your ride.

                                  SHEA
                    Yeah, well the kids thought the 
                    nickel was worth more  cause it s 
                    bigger than a dime.  Your study was 
                    garbage.

      Lloyd takes this in a beat, then the sound of Philly exiting 
    the bathroom makes them turn. She s all sexed up and HOT AS 
      HELL. Shea and Lloyd stare, speechless.

                                  PHILLY
                    I m ready ... and you can close 
                    your mouths now.

    OFF Philly, smoking hot.



      Charlie/Graham in the front seat; Shea in back, writing on a 
      notepad.They stare across the parking lot at Philly s room.

                                  SHEA
                    And this llwork? Some dude s gonna
                    watch his old lady get tagged by 
                    another dude?  I mean, that 
                    actually goes down?

                                  GRAHAM
                      Apparently.

                                  SHEA
                    Said it before and I ll say it 
                    again: White people are crazy.
                          (then)
                    Alright, if we re gonnado this, 
                    let s do it right.  Ready?                                                                                    41.


      Shea tears out the paper he s been writing on, displays his 
      handiwork -- the latest group nickname nominee, once again 
      done in elaborate graffiti style:  BREAKOUTKINGS.  Graham 
    and Charlie look at it, then look at each other. 

                                  GRAHAM
                    It doesn t make any sense.  We re 
                    not breaking out.  

                                  CHARLIE
                          Breakout-ApprehensionKings, maybe.  

                                  SHEA
                    See, this is why I was clearin 
                    seven figures while ya llwere 
                      clippin coupons.  I got vision. 

                                  GRAHAM
                    Doesn t make any sense.

      Shea, undeterred, leans back in the seat and spreads his 
      hands out, like envisioning it on a t-shirt...

                                  SHEA
                    Breakout Kings...



      Tillman has beaten the male driver of the truck unconscious
      with a Maglightflashlight.  Tillman then walks over to the 
      female EMPLOYEE -- who we get a good look at for the first 
      time.  She s an attractive blonde in her late 20s.She 
      smiles at Tillman affectionately.  He kisses her, then --

                                  TILLMAN
                    Sorry, baby.

    He raises the flashlight and clocks her right over her ear --

      RESUME:

      Charlie leans toward the speaker.

                                  CHARLIE
                    You think she helped Tillman too?                                                                                    51.

                          (realizing)
                    I bet she created a distraction so 
                    he could get under that truck.

      FLASHBACK: 



      Tillman carries his trash bin, looking over at the food 
      service truck -- and behind it, where the two food service 
      employees talk to three guards.

      ANGLE:  The female EMPLOYEE is telling a story, in a 
      coquettish fashion that has clearly drawn the attention of 
    the three male guards and her male co-worker.  

    In the B.G.we see Tillman running for the truck as he 
      unfurls the license plate half-suit-of-armor.

      RESUME:

                                  CHARLIE
                    Where s this woman now?

                                  JULIANNE (O.S.)
                    Quit her job yesterday, citing 
                    stress from the attack.  Same 
                    excuse Ferro used.

      Shea emerges from the back bedroom.

                                  GRAHAM
                    Anything?

      Shea goes right for the freezer, takes out a bag of frozen 
      peas and places it on his right knuckles.

                                  SHEA
                    Not much: he was laundering money 
                    through the bar - we knew that; 
                    Tillman never divorced his wife; 
                    who cares; they all tried to screw  
                    Tillman over; knew that too --

                                  GRAHAM
                    Hold on.  His wife?  The chick from 
                    the bar fight that sent him to 
                    prison in the first place?
                          (offShea s nod)
                    Could that be the same woman from 
                    the food truck?

                                  CHARLIE

                    Julianne, do a search for Tillman s 
                    wife Gwen, any car she may have --

                                  JULIANNE (OVER SPEAKER)
                    -- two weeks ago she bought a 1996 
                    silver Ford Taurus -- most popular 
                    make and model in the U.S.



      CHYRON:  Alburg, Vermont

      Charlie and Graham s rental car is parked behind a roadside 
      diner.  They have a good view of the rest area.  Charlie 
      wraps up a phone call with his wife.

                                  CHARLIE (INTO PHONE) 
                    Okay.  Nah, just some meetings.  
                    Might be late. Okay.  Me too.  Bye.  

    He hangs up.

                                  LLOYD (O.S.)
                    Did you see a lot of action in the 
                    military, Charlie?

      Reveal Lloyd in the back, sipping the straw of a juice box.

                                  LLOYD (CONT'D)
                    I ask because there s an emotional 
                    impediment when you talk to your 
                    wife -- indicative, perhaps, of 
                    past trauma.

                                  GRAHAM
                    You want a presenttrauma?

                                  LLOYD
                    If he can t verbalize his feelings, 
                    he might try writing them down, 
                    letting her read it.  

      That resonates with Charlie-- then Graham snaps his fingers:

                                  GRAHAM
                    Here we go.

      Charlie turns to see a silver Taurus pull into the rest area.



      Gwen exits the car, gives $20 to the attendant in the center 
      island.  She begins fueling the car.



      Julianne sits by herself, watching a MAN walk his dog along 
    the river.  She takes a deep breath, stands, approaches.

                                  JULIANNE
                    Excuse me, do you have the time?

                                  MAN WALKING DOG
                    Yeah, it s 4:30.

      Julianne turns, moves back to the bench, sits, exhales.  
      CRANE UP AND BACK as she stands again and approaches a woman 
      leaning by a railing... Excuse me, do you have the time? ...
