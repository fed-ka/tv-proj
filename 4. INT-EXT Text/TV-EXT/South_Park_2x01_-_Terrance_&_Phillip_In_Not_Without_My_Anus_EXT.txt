               It's a high, sweeping, super serious MOW shot.


               Phillip and Terrance walk down the steps toward the parking 
               lot. We can see the big, Canadian flag behind them. Lots of 
               REPORTERS and PROTESTERS are gathered out front.

                                     TERRANCE
                         That sure was fun Phillip, let's go 
                         home and eat Kraft Dinner!

                                     PHILLIP
                         Here, here!

               Scott, the Prosecuting Attorney, emerges.

                                     SCOTT
                         Well, looks like you got you got 
                         away with it, Terrance and Phillip!

                                     PHILLIP
                         Oh, hello, Scott. No hard feelings, 
                         right ol' pal?

                                     SCOTT
                         There ARE hard feelings!! THIS ISN'T 
                         OVER!! I'M GOING TO SEE TO IT THAT 
                         YOU BOTH PAY FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE!! 
                         AND DO YOU KNOW WHY?!?!

                                     PHILLIP
                         'Cause you're a dick?

                                     SCOTT
                         NO! Because I hate you! You think 
                         farting is so funny! Well it isn't! 
                         Fart jokes are the lowest form of 
                         comedy, and --

               Phillip farts, they laugh.

                                     SCOTT
                         AGH!!! I hate you both!! I've hated 
                         you ever since I can remember, I 
                         hate you, and I wish you both had 
                         cancer.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Cancer?

                                     SCOTT
                         Yes. In the head.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Head cancer?

                                     SCOTT
                         This is NOT the end TERRANCE AND 
                         PHILLIP! YOU'LL RUE THIS DAY!!!

               Scott walks away.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Wow! Scott really hates us, Phillip.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Yes, perhaps he's homophobic.

               Terrance thinks.

                                     TERRANCE
                         But we're not gay, Phillip.

                                     PHILLIP
                         We're not?

                                     TERRANCE
                         Well, let us board the subway and 
                         return home. There we can eat Kraft 
                         dinner.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Yes, It's been a long day. And only 
                         Kraft dinner can calm my nerves.


               The men walk towards their humble home.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Well, it's too bad we didn't find 
                         any treasure on the subway, Phillip.

               Just then, another character who looks JUST LIKE Terrance 
               and Phillip walks in.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Oh hello, ugly Bob.

                                     UGLY BOB
                         Hello, Terrance. Hello, Phillip.

                                     TERRANCE
                         My God you're looking hideously ugly 
                         today, Ugly Bob.

                                     UGLY BOB
                         How come you guys say stuff like 
                         that?

                                     TERRANCE
                         Because you're God damned ugly, Bob.

                                     UGLY BOB
                         I know, but --

                                     PHILLIP
                         Ugly Bob, your face looks like 
                         somebody tried to put out a forest 
                         fire with a screwdriver.

                                     UGLY BOB
                         I can't help how I look. Besides, 
                         it's not what's on the outside that 
                         matters, it's what's on the inside.

                                     TERRANCE
                         No it isn't.

               Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Wanna see what's on the inside of 
                         me?

               Terrance farts. They laugh.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Wait, wait! I've got an idea! Why 
                         don't you put this paper bag over 
                         your head, Ugly Bob?

               Phillip pulls out a large brown paper bag.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Yes, if people can't see your face, 
                         they won't know how wretchedly ugly 
                         you are!

                                     UGLY BOB
                         Really?

               Ugly Bob puts the paper bag over his head.

                                     UGLY BOB
                         Hey, thanks you guys. Maybe now I 
                         can score with chicks.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Sure you can, Ugly Bob, if they can't 
                         see how horribly disfigured you are, 
                         they'll want to sleep with you.

                                     UGLY BOB
                         Thanks, you guys.

               Ugly Bob leaves, Terrance and Phillip head into their house.


               A TITLE reads 'FIVE HOURS LATER'.

                                                                    CUT TO:


               DING DONG -- Celine Dion answers the door.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Hello, Celine Dion.

                                     CELINE DION
                         Terrance. This is quite a surprise.

                                     TERRANCE
                         You're looking well.

                                     CELINE DION
                         And you.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Celine, where is our daughter Sally?

                                     CELINE DION
                         She's in the middle east, studying 
                         Anthropology, why?

                                     TERRANCE
                         Wrong. She's been taken hostage, and 
                         is now being held prisoner.

                                     CELINE DION
                         What?!

                                     TERRANCE
                         Phillip and I are going to Iran to 
                         find her, but we may never return.

                                     CELINE DION
                         Oh Terrance, what happened to us?

                                     TERRANCE
                         We just grew apart Celine Dion.

                                     CELINE DION
                         Please bring our daughter home safe, 
                         Terrance.

               Terrance farts.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Ha ha ha ha ha!!!


               Terrance and Phillip walk down the crowded, insane Iranian 
               streets.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Oh, Phillip, how will I ever find my 
                         fugitive daughter in this daunting 
                         place? We don't speak the language, 
                         we are unwelcome strangers, and we 
                         have no idea where to begin!

               They walk a little further.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Oh look, there she is.

               In the midst of Iranian people, little Sally, who is white, 
               stands out like a sore thumb.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Oh, good.

               They walk over to Sally.

                                     SALLY
                         Who? Where?

                                     TERRANCE
                         I'm here, Sally. It's your father, 
                         Terrance. I'm here to save you from 
                         your smelly Iranian captors.

                                     SALLY
                         Papa!

               Terrance and Sally hug.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Say, she looks a lot more like Celine 
                         Dion than you, Terrance.

               Sally rips a fart and laughs.

                                     PHILLIP
                         OH, NOW I SEE THE RESEMBLANCE!!

                                     TERRANCE
                         Well, enough of Iran, let's get home.


               We see the plane heading back the other way.


                                     TERRANCE
                         Well, now that I have my bastard 
                         daughter back, I feel like going 
                         back to Celine Dion's house and asking 
                         her to marry me again.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Oh Raspberries, looks like I'm losing 
                         a friend.

                                     TERRANCE
                         No, you're gaining a pop vocalist.

                                     PHILLIP
                         OH MY GOD, WHAT IS THIS?!?!

               Terrance and Phillip look around, and see that Canada has 
               completely changed.

               Most everything has been colored red, and large paintings of 
               Saddam Hussein hang everywhere.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Is this Canada?

                                     TERRANCE
                         It seems to have changed...

                                     PHILLIP
                         THIS IS MADNESS!!!

               DRAMATIC MUSIC.

                                          ACT II


               Terrance and Phillip walk down a Canadian street, where most 
               of the buildings have been painted red. Huge framed pictures 
               of Saddam are everywhere.

                                     TERRANCE
                         What's going on, Terrance? How could 
                         Canada have changed so much whilst 
                         we were gone?

                                     PHILLIP
                         I don't know, Terrance. And who is 
                         that smelly person in all these 
                         pictures?

                                     TERRANCE
                         I must take my bastard daughter back 
                         to Celine Dion, and she what she has 
                         to say.

               Terrance and Phillip walk up to Celine's door and knock.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Celine, I've brought our daughter 
                         Sally back. And I want to tell you 
                         that --

                                     CELINE DION
                         Terrance... Uh... Could you come 
                         back a little later?

                                     PHILLIP
                         Why?

                                     CELINE DION
                         Uh... I'm just a little busy right 
                         now...

                                     TERRANCE
                         You've got a MAN over, don't you 
                         Celine Dion!!

                                     CELINE DION
                         Well, I --

               Ugly Bob walks up to the door. The brown paper bag is still 
               on his head.

                                     UGLY BOB
                         Hi guys.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Oh my God! It's Ugly Bob!!

                                     TERRANCE
                         What the hell are you doing here?!

                                     UGLY BOB
                         I'm doing Celine Dion, what's it 
                         look like?

                                     TERRANCE
                         Oh Celine Dion, what have you done?! 
                         I was going to make us a family again 
                         but now you've slept with ugly Bob!

                                     CELINE DION
                         What do you mean? Why are you calling 
                         him 'Ugly Bob'?

                                     PHILLIP
                         Because that's his name, you stupid 
                         bitch!

                                     CELINE DION
                              (to Bob)
                         You told me your name was Handsome 
                         Bob.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Look at him, Celine Dion!

               Terrance grabs the paper bag and rips it off. Bob still looks 
               just like Terrance and Phillip.

                                     CELINE DION
                         AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHGHHH!!!!

               As Celine screams, there is a Hitchcock perspective zoom on 
               her face.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Behold his horrible face!!

                                     CELINE DION
                         OH MY GOD!! HE IS HEINOUSLY UGLY!! 
                         AND I AM PREGNANT WITH HIS CHILD!!!

                                     TERRANCE
                         WHAT?! NOOOoooo!!

                                     CELINE DION
                         I'm going to have a freak baby!!

                                     PHILLIP
                         Oh, the humanity!!


               Celine and Ugly Bob are lying in bed, smoking. Ugly Bob still 
               has a paper bag over his head.

                                     CELINE DION
                         Oh, ugly Bob... I'm so confused. I 
                         love your personality, but you are 
                         so wretchedly ugly.

                                     UGLY BOB
                         Maybe the baby will have your face 
                         instead of mine.

                                     CELINE DION
                         We can only hope... I suppose we'll 
                         be okay, as long as you keep that 
                         bag on your head.

               Suddenly, there is horrible commotion. A group of Iranian 
               soldiers break into the room. Saddam follows close behind.

                                     CELINE DION
                         What's this?!

                                     SADDAM
                         Hey, there. My name's Saddam. I'm a 
                         big fan of Polo. I've been searching 
                         a long time for you Celine Dion.

                                     UGLY BOB
                         Oh no you don't! She's my bitch!

                                     SADDAM
                         Who are you?

                                     UGLY BOB
                         I'm Bob. But my friends call me ugly 
                         Bob, because I have the features of 
                         a deformed burn victim.

                                     SADDAM
                         Really? I thought all Canadians looked 
                         alike. Let me see...

               Ugly Bob lifts his paper bag. Everyone in the room screams 
               horribly. Even Celine Dion.

                                     SADDAM
                         Wow, I'm sorry, guy. You know, I 
                         could cure that face of yours.

                                     UGLY BOB
                         You could?

                                     SADDAM
                         Sure, I just need a favor. There's a 
                         Canadian football game tomorrow. The 
                         Ottawa Roughriders against the 
                         Vancouver Roughriders. It's at that 
                         game that I will officially turn the 
                         Canadian flag over to my Iranian 
                         one.

                                     CELINE DION
                         What? Why?!

                                     SADDAM
                         Hey, don't worry about that. Take a 
                         load off. Don't think about it. Look 
                         over here. All I need is for Celine 
                         Dion to sing our Iranian National 
                         Anthem at the game, to finalize my 
                         hostile takeover of Canada. What'dya 
                         say?

                                     UGLY BOB
                         Did you say hostile takeover of 
                         Canada?

                                     SADDAM
                         No, no, relax there, fella.


               Terrance and Phillip are waiting in front of the Palace.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Well, Scott said to meet him here, 
                         but now he's not showing up.

               Phillip farts, they laugh.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Well, while we're waiting, why don't 
                         we search for treasure?

                                     TERRANCE
                         Oh, good idea! Let's search for 
                         treasure!

               Terrance and Phillip again look around their immediate area 
               for treasure. But find none.

               Finally, Scott walks up.

                                     SCOTT
                         What are you idiots doing?

                                     TERRANCE
                         We're looking for treasure!

                                     SCOTT
                         Is that some kind of metaphor for a 
                         kind of search that can't be 
                         described?

               Terrance and Phillip think.

                                     PHILLIP
                         No... We're searching for treasure.

                                     SCOTT
                         Listen, I have an inside scoop. 
                         There's an Iraqi dictator who is 
                         quietly and slowly taking over Canada.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Yes, you mean Saddam Smelly. We saw 
                         him on the tele.

                                     SCOTT
                         Well, what are you two gonna do aboot 
                         it?

                                     PHILLIP
                         What do you mean?

                                     SCOTT
                         It's YOUR fault that he's here! YOU 
                         brought the Iraquis back with you on 
                         your plane when you rescued your 
                         kidnapped daughter.

               Terrance and Phillip GASP!

                                     PHILLIP
                         You mean WE are to blame?!

                                     SCOTT
                         That's right, and now you must make 
                         amends. Tomorrow Saddam will try to 
                         finalize his takeover of Canada at 
                         the Roughriders/Roughriders football 
                         game. All his soldiers will be there. 
                         It will be your only shot at wiping 
                         them all out. Here, take this.

                                     PHILLIP
                         What is it?

                                     SCOTT
                         It's a bomb. You must strap it to 
                         yourselves, go to the game, and 
                         sacrifice your lives to take out 
                         Saddam's minions.

                                     TERRANCE
                         That sounds scary.

                                     SCOTT
                         Well, you must do it, for Canada.

                                     PHILLIP
                         For Canada, Terrance.

                                     TERRANCE
                         For Canada, Phillip.

               Terrance and Phillip walk away, and Scott is left alone.

                                     SCOTT
                         Yes... Yes... Terrance and Phillip. 
                         And when the dust has settled, Canada 
                         will be rid of both the Iraqis... 
                         AND your immature fart humor!

               DRAMATIC MUSIC.

                                         ACT III


               We see the last play of the second quarter.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         And the Roughriders are really giving 
                         the Roughriders a run for their money. 
                         All else aside, I must say the 
                         Roughriders are simply out matched 
                         by these Roughriders.

               The play ends. The clock runs out. The referee blows his 
               whistle.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         And that's going to take us to 
                         halftime. Be sure to stick around 
                         for the halftime show, Saddam and 
                         the Electric Iraqi's in a salute to 
                         hostile takeovers.

               Terrance and Phillip are sitting in the stands.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Well, I guess it's time, old friend.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Yes... Prepare the alert!

               A lame marching band takes to the field. They are cheesy and 
               gay.

               A quick stage is made, where Saddam and his friends appear.

                                     SADDAM
                         Hello to my Canadian friends. 
                         Everybody relax, take a rest, put 
                         your feet up, those dogs are barking.

               The audience looks confused.

                                     SADDAM
                         You may have noticed some changes to 
                         your country. Don't worry about that, 
                         the changes will continue. I am here 
                         to announce once and for all --

               ZOOM IN on Saddam.

                                     SADDAM
                         THAT CANADA WILL NOW BE KNOWN AS NEW 
                         BAGHDAD! KOO LOOK KA LOOK!!

               Iraqi guards lower the Canadian flags and raise Iraqi flags 
               in their place.

               The audience GASPS!

                                     SADDAM
                         YOU WILL BOW DOWN TO ME AS YOUR 
                         RULER!! YOU WILL OBEY MY LAWS OR YOU 
                         WILL BE KILLED!!! HA HA HAAH HAA!!

               Celine Dion and Ugly Bob take the stage.

                                     SADDAM
                         AND NOW YOU WILL SING THE IRAQI 
                         NATIONAL ANTHEM -- OR YOU WILL BE 
                         STABBED IN HEAD!!!

               Celine walks up to the mic and starts to sing.

                                     CELINE DION
                              (sadly)
                         Shtood makalek svtdot inka inka 
                         broost...

               MUSIC starts. A guard puts the tip of his gun in Celine's 
               back and makes her take the stage.

                                     TERRANCE
                         Now, Phillip?

                                     PHILLIP
                         Now, Terrance!!

               Terrance and Phillip pull out gas masks. Terrance put a mighty 
               Canadian Horn to his lips.

               Terrance blows the horn. Brrr ba ba BRRR!!!!

               Suddenly, every audience member in the stadium puts on a gas 
               mask.

                                     SADDAM
                         What the hell is this?

                                     CELINE DION
                              (still singing)
                         barak a shtood, kalak a shtood...

               Now all the audience members, with their gas masks, bend 
               over and point their asses at the field.

               With one mighty ROAR all of the Canadians FART!! Blowing hot 
               noxious gas onto the Iraqis.

                                     SADDAM
                              (Choking)
                         NOOOO!!!!

                                     GUARD
                         They're using chemical warfare! How 
                         could they?!

               Just then Celine Dion and Ugly Bob put on their gas masks.

               They fart along with everyone else. Until the entire stadium 
               is one big smelly dust cloud.

               Terrance and Phillip, meanwhile, are laughing their asses 
               off at all the farts.

               Finally all the dust settles, the air clears, and we see 
               that all the Iraqis lie dead or near death on the field.

               All the Canadians remove their gas masks and celebrate by 
               cheering and jumping up and down.

                                     TERRANCE
                         WE DID IT, PHILLIP! WE'VE DESTROYED 
                         THE TURKS!!

                                     PHILLIP
                         OH GLORIOUS DAY!!

               Everybody happily takes to the field.

               Terrance and Celine Dion embrace. 'Don't you forget about 
               me' from the Breakfast Club starts to play.

                                     CELINE DION
                         Terrance! Terrance! You've saved 
                         Canada!

                                     TERRANCE
                         Oh, it was all Phillip's idea!

                                     UGLY BOB
                         God bless you, Phillip.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Don't touch me, ugly Bob.

               Just then Scott walks up.

                                     SCOTT
                         What the hell happened! You were 
                         supposed to be blown up!

                                     PHILLIP
                         We came up with a better plan. You 
                         see Scott, after all your criticism 
                         it was farting that saved Canada!

                                     SCOTT
                         Oh! That is SO JUVENILE!!!

                                     TERRANCE
                         Hey Scott, do you like apples?

                                     SCOTT
                         Of course.

               Terrance farts a huge wet one of Scott's head.

                                     TERRANCE
                         How do you like THEM apples?!

               Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

                                     SCOTT
                         I HATE YOU TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!!

                                     TERRANCE
                         Oh, Celine Dion... You never finished 
                         that National Anthem.

                                     CELINE DION
                         You're right Terrance, You're right...

               Celine steps up to the mic and sings:

                                     CELINE DION
