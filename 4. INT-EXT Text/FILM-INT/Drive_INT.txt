We're close on a maze of metal rods, tubes, and wires. It's only
as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over
the image we hear a voice talking on a phone.
DRIVER O/S
...hundred thousand streets in this city,
you don't need to know the route. You give
me a time and place, I give you a five
minute window. Those five minutes I'm
yours. Whatever goes down I'm yours. Minute
either side you're on your own...
As the engine ignites and roars to life we DISSOLVE TO:
A map of downtown L.A. spread out on a bed, dozens of different
routes marked in pencil. The voice continues -
DRIVER O/S
...One last thing. You won't be able to
reach me at this number again...
DRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it
in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly
packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a
cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA
Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks.
Driver strides through a dimly lit car park, carrying his duffel
bag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night
out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his
way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle
The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is
only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the
passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes.
Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives
carefully, letting other cars overtake.
Clutching his duffel bag Driver heads towards the car park
elevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a
pretty GIRL in her 20's wearing a waitress outfit. Their eyes
meet briefly, before Driver walks on.
Driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new
apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean,
sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He
tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again.
Driver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on
the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food
shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage
lit up with a neon sign - Shannon's Picture Car Warehouse -
vintage cars.
SHANNON, the owner of the garage, has a distinctive limp. Driver
follows him past rows of vintage cars.
SHANNON
...Plain Jane cheap like you asked for but
with a hundred and sixty horsepower inside.
You get any sleep?
DRIVER
Not this week.
As Shannon grins we feel the familiarity between them.
SHANNON
I can offer you some Halcyon.
DRIVER
Won't work.
They head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they
arrive at a plain looking Impala.
SHANNON
There she is. Silver Impala. Most popular
car in the state of California...
Driver casts his eyes over the unimpressive vehicle then holds
out his hand for the keys.

9/24/10
The basketball game is approaching the end of the third quarter.
Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows
of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's
9:50. He checks his mirror then turns into a side street.
A vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street.
Under the pale yellow glow of the street lamps, Driver sees
signs advertising a `huge blow out weekend sale'. He pulls over,
making sure he has a good view of the entrance. On the radio,
the basketball commentator is getting more excited.
BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
...This is some comeback from the Clippers!
Only a few minutes ago they looked dead and
buried!...
Driver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld
scanner. He switches it on, tuning it to the right frequency.
Crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball
commentary now.
POLICE SCANNER
...9 Adam 81, what is your current
location?...Repeat, what is your current
location?...
BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
...Another unbelievable three pointer from
Davis and the Clippers are within five!...
Out of the corner of his eye Driver sees two MEN approach. He
doesn't react, expecting them. They cut through the fence with
bolt cutters and approach the main building. Driver watches them
pull on their masks, then one of them takes out a shotgun and
blasts the lock to the front door. Instantly the alarm shrills.
The only thing Driver does is to turn on his stop watch.
BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
...Time out Knicks...
The stop watching keeps ticking away, the siren blaring, the
commentary continuing, the police scanner crackling.
The storefront is hidden in shadow, impossible to tell what's
going on inside. Driver looks at his stop watch. Almost three
minutes. One of the masked men emerges now, carrying a duffel
bag. He hurries over and gets in the back of Driver's car
without a word. There's no sign of the other robber.
(CONTINUED)

9/24/10
11 CONTINUED: 11
The commentary continues, so does the crackling on the police
scanner. Four minutes. Still no sign of the second armed robber.
His companion in the back starts to look nervous, wondering
what's happened to his partner.
Driver doesn't betray a hint of nerves. Four and half minutes on
his stop watch. Thirty seconds more and he's on his way.
Suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows, running as
fast as he can to the getaway car. He jumps into the back seat a
few seconds short of five minutes and Driver screeches off.
Driver thunders over the 1st Street bridge towards Boyle
Heights, then eases his foot off the gas, slowing to a steady
speed. In the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their
masks, looking pumped up with adrenalin. Driver studies them in
his rear view mirror, then swerves right on Mission Street as
his police scanner crackles to life.
POLICE SCANNER
...Attention all units...211...Superstore
on Traction Avenue...Suspects headed
Eastbound on 1st Street...Driving a Silver
Impala...
Driver swings sharply into 4th Street now, crossing the L.A.
River again, heading back in the same direction he came.
POLICE SCANNER
...Airships dispatched...Downtown and Boyle
Heights...All units standby. Repeat, all
units standby...
Up ahead, the lights of Downtown L.A. glitter against the night
sky. Hovering between the neon green glow of the skyscrapers
Driver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter. He
switches off his headlights, turning left on Santa Fe Avenue.
The armed robbers watch in tense silence as Driver weaves in and
out of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off.
It's as if he's trying to find his way out of the maze or
probing to see if there's anyone out there.
POLICE SCANNER
...1 Baker 11, headed south on Boyle
Avenue...No sign of suspects...Repeat, no
sign of suspects...
The armed robbers look relieved when suddenly a police car
glides past at the end of the alleyway, its lights also off.

13 CONTINUED: 13
It's like catching a glimpse of a passing shark's fin. Driver
taps the brakes gently, his car sliding to a stop. He stays
there a moment, then eases the Impala forward, turning in the
same direction as the black-and-white.
It's a high-risk strategy but Driver follows the black-and-white
at a distance, hidden in the darkness, knowing other squad cars
won't be checking the same route. The police car makes its way
through the dimly lit industrial zone, unaware it's being
shadowed. Driver turns his car radio up a whisper.
BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
...And for the first time in the game the
Clippers have the lead. 71 to 69. Seven to
go in the Fourth here at the Staples
Centre...
Driver turns the sound back down. Up ahead, the police car
swings left, disappearing from view. Driver slows down too,
anticipating the next obstacle. He doesn't have long to wait. In
the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police
chopper's search-lights, sweeping the area one more time.
Driver floors the gas, speeding straight towards the approaching
helicopter. The armed robbers are too stunned to protest. They
just sit there, watching the sweeping searchlights getting
closer and closer.
Then suddenly it becomes clear what Driver's doing. Up ahead,
there's a small underpass below the 7th Street bridge. Driver
slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the
chopper's searchlights spot them.
The roar of the helicopter thunders overhead. The underpass is
crammed with dirty mattresses and shopping carts. Sleeping HOBOS
can be seen under dirty blankets. Driver waits for the echo of
the helicopter to fade, then moves forward again.
Gloomy yellow street-lamps shine down on the industrial zone.
Rows of delivery trucks are parked outside the meat-packing
factories. Driver cruises cautiously down the deserted street.
The crackling of the police scanner and the droning of the
basketball commentary add to the tension. Finally up ahead he
sees car-lights streaming back and forth on Broadway.
DRIVER
Get down...
(CONTINUED)

9/24/10
16 CONTINUED: 16
The armed robbers lie flat on the back seat, paying Driver more
respect now.
There's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway. Driver falls in
behind the other cars. On the radio, the basketball game is
still playing.
BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
...Three thirteen left on the clock.
Dunleavy calls a time out and it's the
Clippers by one...
The passing head-lamps light up Driver's face. There's not a
trace of emotion in his eyes -- even when he spots a patrol car
approaching in the opposite direction.
BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
...Buckle up your seat belts Clippers fans.
This game really is too close to call...
The two cars pass each other slowly. Driver sees the cops in the
Black-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past. He
turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner.
POLICE SCANNER
...This is 1 David 16...Silver Impala
headed South on Broadway and
Pico...Couldn't get a look at her license
plates...Appears to be only one occupant...
In the back seat, the armed robbers wait nervously for the
police dispatch to respond.
POLICE SCANNER
...1 David 16...why don't you check her
out...
As soon as he hears this Driver swerves sharply into the next
street.
Driver guns around the block now, building up speed.
POLICE SCANNER
...This is 1 David 16...We lost the suspect
somewhere between Broadway and
Grand...Possible evasive action...Request
airship and additional units...

9/24/10
Driver bursts out onto Pico now. A squad car headed in the
opposite direction slows down as it sees him but is caught up in
the flow of traffic, unable to turn round and give chase.
POLICE SCANNER
...1 David 11...suspect headed West on
Pico...
Driver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him, so
smooth and effortless it's hard to tell how fast he's going. He
glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper
overhead. The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging
its search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position.
Driver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way
of outrunning the chopper. Blue light floods the asphalt around
him as he guns down Figueroa.
POLICE SCANNER
All units...pursuit in progress...silver
Impala...Headed North on Figueroa...
Even now Driver doesn't panic, turning his attention back to the
basketball game.
BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
Thornton pulls up from behind the arc,
misses. Rebound New York. One eighteen to
play...
Driver swerves sharply towards the sparkling lights of the
Staples Centre.
The terraced parking lot looms up ahead. A sign above the
barrier says `Season Ticket Holders Only'. Driver punches in a
ticket and roars into the parking lot.
The Impala screeches from one level to the next. With a game
going on, the parking lot is almost full. Finally Driver pulls
into a free parking space.
BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
...Thirty seconds remaining and all the
Knicks have to do is run out the clock...
Driver glances in his side mirror. Behind him, dozens of FANS
are already streaming out into the parking lot before the game
is over, hoping to avoid the inevitable traffic.

BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
...Gordon back to Davis...Davis for

The jubilant commentary continues, but Driver isn't listening
anymore. The game has served its purpose. More fans flood into
the parking lot. Dozens of cars pull out of their places.
BASKETBALL COMMENTARY
...What a remarkable comeback...Outplayed
for most of the game, the Clippers have
shown incredible resilience...
Driver glances at the armed robbers and nods. It's time. They
climb out of the car, merging in with the crowd. Driver watches
them disappear, then slips on a Clippers cap, climbs out of the
Impala himself and heads towards another car.
Driver sits at the wheel of the Black-and-White while a STUNT
SUPERVISOR checks his harness. Shannon leans into the window
with a smile.
SHANNON
I managed to get them up to five hundred.
Driver doesn't seem to care, focussed on the job.
2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S
Camera ready, sound ready...
Shannon joins the rest of the crew, looking on.
2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S
...ACTION!...
Driver floors the gas, screeching out of the alleyway. He
swerves between several oil drums then straightens up on the
main road.
In his rear view mirror he sees a black Dodge Charger appear on
cue, bearing down on him.

9/24/10
26 CONTINUED: 26
Driver slows to forty, like he's supposed to, but the black
Charger keeps coming at speed.
Driver's eyes stay fixed on his rear view mirror, judging the
other car's speed and angle of approach to perfection.
The Charger slams into the back of Driver's car at sixty miles
an hour, hitting him just above the left rear wheel.
Driver's reactions are quick as lightning, counter-steering as
his Black-and-White goes careening off the road. He keeps the
car upright long enough to slow it down before it finally flips
end over end.
Up ahead, the Charger skids to a showy stop.
2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S
...And CUT!...
Some clapping and cheering breaks out, but most the crew
couldn't care less, returning to their cell-phones and shot
lists. Only Shannon seems interested in Driver, limping over and
helping him out of his battered Black-and-White.
SHANNON
Nice work, officer...
Driver spits out some fake candyglass from the shattered
windscreen.
A New York style pizza-by-the-slice restaurant. A WAITER takes a
delivery of Chinese food at the door and carries it over to a
table where Shannon is sitting with an old friend, BERNIE ROSE.
WAITER
Here you go, Mr. Rose.
(Taking out the white boxes)
Egg rolls, chicken chow mein, five flavor
shrimp and Peking duck.
BERNIE ROSE
Did they remember the chop sticks?
WAITER
Doesn't look like it, sir. Let me run and
get the guy.
From the way the waiter hurries off we get a sense of Bernie's
power and authority. He turns back to Shannon, resuming their
conversation.

BERNIE ROSE
...You run a perfectly good business. Why
would you want to change now?
SHANNON
You know how much my business made last
year? Thirty Grand. Takes me six months to
build a car and a couple of seconds for
these jerks to write it off on a stunt that
doesn't even make it into the movie.
Bernie shakes his head but clearly has a soft spot for Shannon.
BERNIE ROSE
How much do you need?
SHANNON
Let me talk you through it first.
BERNIE ROSE
That sounds like a lot.
SHANNON
Doesn't have to be. The big money teams
burn through three, four million a year but
that's `cause they're using half a dozen
test drivers and a stable of cars.
BERNIE ROSE
I don't know anything about car racing but
I assume there's a reason for that?
SHANNON
Sure, but it's not the only way. All I need
is a hard-used stock car. We start off with
the small-town action then work our way up.
There's close to two thousand events out
there and once we make the Show we're
talking millions.
BERNIE ROSE
`Millions'?
SHANNON
There's a fortune to be made. Sponsorship.
TV deals. We'll even name the team after
you.
Bernie looks at his friend in mild exasperation then turns away
as the waiter returns with a handful of chop sticks.
BERNIE ROSE
Thank you, Ron. You sure you don't want any
of this?

SHANNON
No, thanks.
Bernie waits for the waiter to leave then continues.
BERNIE ROSE
You still haven't given me a number?
Shannon hesitates but only for a second.
SHANNON
Four hundred and thirty thousand dollars.
Bernie Rose can't help grinning at his nerve.
SHANNON
Look, I wouldn't come to you unless I was
sure about this.
BERNIE ROSE
Come on, Shannon. How can you be sure? What
have you got these big money teams don't
have?
SHANNON
I got a driver.
BERNIE ROSE
And they got half a dozen Drivers you told
me.
SHANNON
Not like this one.
He stares at his friend with quiet conviction.
SHANNON
I been working with this guy a long time -
I've never seen anything like it. I had the
money I'd back him myself...
Bernie Rose considers him quietly.
BERNIE ROSE
But you don't have the money.
SHANNON
Everything I own is in metal. I had to sell
my Bullit car the other day just to pay the
gas bill. I'm telling you, Bernie, put this
kid behind a wheel there's nothing he can't
do.

BERNIE ROSE
And what happens to my money if this kid
gets hit by a bus?
Shannon's about to reply when they're interrupted by a big bull
of a man with a gruff voice.
NINO
What are you doing eating Chink food in my
restaurant?
BERNIE ROSE
What's a Jew doing running a Pizzeria?
Worst fucking pizza in LA by the way. How
hard is it to bake a loaf of bread?
NINO
It's the fucking water in this city...
Shannon smiles, intimidated by Nino, giving up his seat
respectfully. Nino doesn't even acknowledge him.
BERNIE ROSE
I thought you were supposed to be out of
town anyway?
NINO
Well, I'm back.
(Barely a glance at Shannon)
Take a hike. I need to talk to my partner.
BERNIE ROSE
Be polite, Nino. I invited him here.
NINO
Oh, I'm sorry. How you doing, Shannon?
How's the fucking leg?
Bernie senses things are only going to get worse and dismisses
Shannon gently.
BERNIE ROSE
I'll think about it but I want to meet your
guy first...
Driver stands in the elevator as it climbs slowly. It reaches
the ground floor then the doors slide open. Driver finds himself
face to face with the pretty girl he saw the other night. She
looks a little startled to see him, then recovers
PRETTY GIRL (IRENE)
Hi...

28 CONTINUED: 28
She joins him in the elevator, carrying a grocery bag with some
milk and Fruit Loops cereal.
DRIVER
Which floor, ma'am?...
IRENE
Fourth please...
Driver presses the fourth floor button even though it's already
lit. The doors shut and the elevator starts to climb. Driver
stares out quietly. Irene takes a glance at him, feeling awkward
in the silence. She looks relieved as the elevator doors finally
open. Driver steps aside to let her out first.
IRENE
Thank you...
Driver and Irene walk down the corridor in the same direction,
only a few feet apart. She seems more aware of his presence than
he is of hers. She reaches the door to her apartment first.
IRENE
Goodbye...
DRIVER
Goodbye, ma'am...
Driver looks at her just long enough not to seem impolite, then
continues down the corridor, not even glancing back.
Even in the cramped space of the roll cage there's something
effortless about the way Driver controls the car. His eyes are
fixed in concentration, his body tensing only slightly as he
lifts his foot off the gas and turns the wheel.
Tinny supermarket music plays in the background. Driver walks
past the vast selection of instant coffee brands, bemused by the
choice. Suddenly he notices something out of the corner of his
eye. At the far end of the aisle his pretty neighbor, Irene, is
browsing through the confectionery section. Standing next to her
is a young boy of six or seven, (BENICIO). He grabs a multi-pack
of snickers and puts it in Irene's shopping basket. Irene calmly
picks it out, replaces it on the shelf, and takes a single
snicker bar for him instead. As Driver watches them, the boy
turns around and notices him. Driver heads down another aisle
before Irene sees him too, keeping to himself to himself.
Driver, Irene and Benicio stand in silence in the elevator,
Driver clutching some of Irene's grocery bags.
Driver carries Irene's grocery bags into the kitchen for her.
DRIVER
Where do you want me to put them?
IRENE
Just over there. Thanks...
Driver places the bags on the kitchen counter.
IRENE
Would you like something to drink?
DRIVER
I'm okay.
IRENE
A glass of water?
DRIVER
Sure...
She pours him a glass of water and hands it to him.
IRENE
Excuse me a second...
She walks out of the room, leaving Driver alone with Benicio.
The little boy stares at him fixedly.
Irene closes the bathroom door behind her, looking at herself in
the mirror, feeling a little uncertain.
Benicio's still staring at Driver. Feeling a little awkward,
Driver takes a long piece of string from his pocket, tugs it
gently, then holds up two pieces of string.

Benicio keeps staring at him, puzzled by the magic trick. Irene
walks back into the room, smiling.
IRENE
You just move to LA?
DRIVER
No, I been here a while.
IRENE
And before that?
DRIVER
Here and there...
IRENE
(A gentle smile)
Too many questions, huh?...
Driver smiles back awkwardly, not sure how else to respond.
Irene switches on the TV for Benicio, sitting him down on the
couch.
Driver has a sip of water, glancing around the room. He notices
a few photographs on a side table. Most of them are of Benicio
and Irene, but one of them shows the little boy standing next to
a strikingly handsome Latino man.
Irene turns around and sees him looking at the picture.
IRENE
That's Benicio's father.
Driver takes in the significance of this, then looks back at
her.
DRIVER
What's he do?
IRENE
He's in jail.
DRIVER
I'm sorry.

IRENE
Isn't that dangerous?
He seems thrown by her concern.
DRIVER
It's just part-time. Most days I work in a
garage.
IRENE
Where?
DRIVER
Reseda Boulevard.
IRENE
You should tell Benicio you're a stunt guy.
DRIVER
He interested in that kind of stuff?
IRENE
Aren't all little boys?
She smiles softly and he realizes she's teasing him.
BENICIO O/S
Mama, I don't like this...
Irene takes the remote and changes the channel for him. Driver
watches her quietly, then drains his glass of water.
IRENE
Would you like another glass?
DRIVER

He catches the disappointment in her eyes, but she covers it
with another good humored smile.

She takes his empty glass and walks him to the door.
Passing traffic roars by on the busy street. Irene and Benicio
are walking home from the bus stop, chatting happily. They look
like they've just come back from the beach, Irene carrying a
basket full of towels, Benicio clutching a dusty soccer ball.
Driver watches them from the window of his apartment, blowing
gently on a cup of coffee.
The reflection of passing neon rolls down the Camaro's
windscreen. Driver's cruising down Hollywood Boulevard, shut off
from the world outside, listening to `Purple Rain'. The HOOKERS
and HIPSTERS have taken over the streets while up above
airbrushed movie stars stare down from their lofty billboards.
Jukebox music plays in the bar and grill. Driver sits on his
own, working his way through a plate of bacon and eggs.
BEARDED REDNECK OFFSCREEN
Mind if I cut in?...
Driver looks up and sees a burly REDNECK with an unkempt beard
and a wrestler's physique. The redneck slides into the seat
opposite him.
BEARDED REDNECK
You're Shannon's buddy, right? We met last
year. You drove me and my brother back from
Palm Springs...

himself killed...
(He grins through yellowing teeth)
He wasn't much, mind you, just family...
Driver doesn't seem to hear him.
BEARDED REDNECK
Thing is -
DRIVER
I'm not interested...
Driver looks up quietly, fixing him with his icy gaze. The
Redneck's smile slowly fades. He considers his response for a
moment, then decides against it, standing up.
BEARDED REDNECK
Well, it's good to see you again...
Driver carries on eating as if the man didn't exist.
Driver and Benicio sit in the Chevelle, driving in silence.
DRIVER
Your mom said you like movies?
BENICIO
Sometimes.
DRIVER
Ever see the Terminator?
BENICIO
No.
DRIVER

Benicio shakes his head.

SHANNON
Don't worry, ma'am, your son'll be fine.
IRENE
I didn't mean it like that...
Shannon smiles to himself, sensing her interest in Driver.
SHANNON
We been together about five years now. He
showed up out of the blue one day, no
references or nothin', asking me for a job.
I offered him half the wages I normally pay
and he didn't even blink. Been exploiting
him ever since...
(HE GRINS)
Only thing he knows is cars...
The car roars along the drainage canals. In the passenger seat
Benicio looks tense but exhilarated. The car glides past a
landscape of abandoned shopping carts, garbage bags, and
shredded tires, picking up speed all the time.
Benicio is asleep in the back of Driver's car now. Driver's
giving him and Irene a ride back to their apartment. Irene looks
at Driver, waiting for him to say something, but he keeps his
eyes fixed on the road.
Cradling the sleeping Benicio in his arms Driver lays him down
on his bed. Irene takes off her son's clothes and puts on his
pyjamas, careful not to wake him. Driver slips out of the room,
uncomfortable with the intimate moment between mother and son.
Irene walks out of the bedroom, smiling at Driver gratefully.
IRENE
Thank you for today. He had a great time...

IRENE
I'm sorry if I put you on the spot, you
know, just showing up like that...
DRIVER
Don't worry...
Their eyes stay on each other, the attraction palpable. Driver
finally breaks the tension, making a tentative move towards the
door. Irene opens it for him, looking up into his eyes. Driver
knows he could kiss her, wants to, but something inside holds
him back. Instead he just offers his help.
DRIVER
You need a ride anywhere over the weekend
I'm not doing much...
Benicio sits in a dentist's chair, looking nervous. Irene sits
beside him, mimicking his expression, trying to make him relax.
Soft rock plays on the car radio. Irene sits in the passenger
seat with a smile. Driver looks at her curiously as he drives,
no idea why she's grinning. Benicio suddenly leans forward and
changes the radio to a different station -- hard rock blaring
out. Driver lets it go for a moment, then changes it back.
Benicio responds, until it becomes a game, Irene laughing now.
On the TV, a Japanese cartoon is playing, a masked hero
confronting the villains, the screen flickering from color to
black and white. Driver and Benicio sit on the couch, watching
the cartoon. From their relaxed body language it's clear some
time has passed and they know each other a little better.
DRIVER
What's happening now?
BENICIO
He's telling him if he doesn't leave the
earth alone he'll fight him.
Irene calls out from her bedroom.
IRENE O/S
I'm almost ready...
Driver looks back at the screen. Werewolves appear now,
surrounding the hero.
DRIVER
Looks like he's in trouble.

Benicio watches curiously as Driver gets off the couch and
kneels beside the TV.
DRIVER
This is pretty complicated. You watching?
Benicio nods. Driver suddenly gives the TV set a hard smack and
the interference stops.
DRIVER
Think you can remember that?...
Benicio grins. Driver smiles back then looks away as he hears
the phone ring. Irene walks out of her bedroom, dressed in her
waitress's uniform, and answers it.
IRENE
Hello?...Yes?...Yes, this is she...
Driver sees the look of surprise on Irene's face as she listens
to the voice on the other end. The doorbell suddenly rings.
Irene catches Driver's eye and asks him to open it. He heads
over, checks the spy-hole, then opens the door. A YOUNG WOMAN
who's sitting for Benicio walks in, looking at Driver curiously.
YOUNG WOMAN (IRENE'S FRIEND)
Hi...
DRIVER
Hello...
BENICIO
Hi Cindy...
Irene's friend heads past Driver and scolds Benicio
affectionately.
IRENE'S FRIEND
It's 8:30. Teeth. Pyjamas. TV off.
BENICIO
It's not the TV. It's a DVD...
Driver looks back at Irene now. She puts down the phone, forcing
a smile but still looking distracted.
Irene sits next to Driver in the passenger seat, staring out of
the window at the glittering fountain in Echo Park.

IRENE
I've never come this way before...
DRIVER
It's a short cut...
IRENE
The park looks pretty at night...
She looks at Driver, watching him quietly, then looks away
again.
DRIVER
You okay?...
Irene takes a long time to answer, still staring out of the
window.
IRENE
That was my husband's lawyer on the phone.
He's getting an early release...
She tries to sound casual. Driver takes the news quietly, even
though it hits him like a sledgehammer.
DRIVER
That's great...
IRENE
I'm happy for Benicio...
Driver knows she's trying to explain herself but doesn't say
anything, driving in silence.
Up ahead the traffic lights turn red and the car slows to a
stop.
Inside, the silence is unbearable. Irene pauses, then looks at
Driver. He's even more handsome in the shadowy half-light,
something achingly lonely and melancholy about his stillness.
She hesitates, then moves her hand towards his, brushing the
back of his hand, then slipping her fingers between his.
The gesture is tiny but charged with emotion. They both stare
out in silence, fingers clasped, then Irene gently withdraws her
hand, as if nothing's happened.
Outside the lights change to green.
The sound of laughter. A sign over the door says, Welcome home
Dad. Inside the apartment there's a small party going on.

9/24/10
56 CONTINUED: 56
Irene's husband, STANDARD, has been released from jail and his
FRIENDS and FAMILY are here to celebrate. Holding Benicio in his
arms he makes a thank you speech to his guests.
STANDARD
...I'm touched and grateful that you're all
here today -- even though I know it's
probably for the food not me...
His self-deprecating humor gets a chorus of laughter and
agreement from the guests. Irene is standing next to her friend
Cindy, looking a little uncomfortable.
STANDARD
...Anyhow, now that I've completed my MBA
in catering from Chino Business School...
(MORE LAUGHTER)
Irene, Benicio and I are finally going to
get our lives back together...
He raises his glass to her.
STANDARD
I'd like to thank my wife for being the
smartest, most beautiful, most patient and
loyal woman I know...
More applause. Irene stares back at Standard's handsome face,
feeling even more uncomfortable.
Driver lies on his bed, gazing up at the ceiling, listening to
the sound of the party echoing down the corridor.
It's nighttime and the party's getting louder. Standard's on the
phone to someone, trying to hear them over the music.
STANDARD
I'm sorry, I can't hear you...
He heads into the bedroom to take the call. The voice on the
other end is accented and unfriendly.
MAN'S VOICE ON THE PHONE
Can you hear me now, you cunt?
Standard pauses, looking concerned.
STANDARD
Sure.

MAN'S VOICE ON THE PHONE
You're gonna come see me tomorrow, you
understand?...
Across the crowded room, Irene is looking for Standard. She sees
him in the bedroom, switching off his phone, and heads over.
IRENE
Benicio wants you to put him to bed.
STANDARD
Okay.
He gives her a warm smile.
IRENE
Who was that on the phone?
STANDARD
My parole officer. He thinks he may have
found me a job.
The noise of the party is finally too much for Driver. He gets
off the bed and slips on his jacket.
Irene is finding the party overwhelming too. She heads out into
the corridor to have a cigarette when she sees Driver across the
hallway, locking the door to his own apartment. She hesitates,
then calls out.
IRENE
Hey...
He turns around and sees her standing there with a smile.
IRENE
I'm sorry about the noise. I was going to
leave a note under your door warning you we
were having a party.
DRIVER
Don't worry. I won't complain.
IRENE
I wish you would. Maybe the cops'd show up
and send everybody home.
Their eyes stay on each other, the music pounding in the
background.

IRENE
The car works great by the way. Hasn't
stalled once.
DRIVER
I'm glad.
Another awkward silence, so much she wants to say but can't.
IRENE
Listen, if you're hungry we got plenty of
FOOD -
Suddenly she turns around as she hears her apartment door open.
Standard stands there with Benicio, holding a bag of trash. He
pauses, then smiles.
STANDARD
I thought if we emptied the trash everyone
would get the message and go home...
He grins at his wife, then looks over at Driver, his smile
hiding whatever he feels inside.
STANDARD
You're the new neighbor, right? Benicio's
told me all about you...
Driver seems unsure how to respond.
DRIVER
He's a great kid.
STANDARD
I can't take any of the credit. He's got a
great mother.
Standard rests his hand gently on Benicio's head, still staring
at Driver.
STANDARD
He tells me you drive for the movies?
DRIVER
Yeah.
STANDARD
Must be pretty good?
DRIVER
I get by.
STANDARD
Not like a nine to five gig, huh?...

60 CONTINUED: (2) 60
He's still smiling but there's a slight edge to his voice. Irene
looks uncomfortable.
IRENE
You want me to take that?
STANDARD
No, we got it.
His eyes are still fixed on Driver.
STANDARD
You want to come in, join us for a drink?
DRIVER
I've got some things to do.
STANDARD
At this hour of night?
IRENE
Standard, he's busy...
Standard doesn't respond, still holding Driver's gaze.
STANDARD
Well, if we're still going by the time
you're back you know where we are. It's
good to meet you...
He slips his arm around his son now and continues down the
corridor, brushing past Driver on his way to empty the trash.
Driver looks at Irene, then heads off in the same direction as
Standard and Benicio to take the elevator. The two men stand
there in charged silence, one emptying the trash, the other
waiting for the elevator, only Benicio oblivious to the tension.
Brooding movie stars look down from the billboards. Driver is in
his car now, soft rock playing on the radio.
Standard is helping his son get ready for school, interacting
with him affectionately. Irene watches them from the doorway,
looking thoughtful.
Anonymous streets roll by, Driver's eyes fixed on the road.

9/24/10
Standard, Irene and Benicio are having dinner at a Chuck E.
Cheese restaurant. We still sense the distance between Standard
and Irene, but Benicio seems completely unaware of it, talking
excitedly as he eats his pizza. Standard reaches out and takes
Irene's hand gently as he listens to his son.
65 OMITTED 65
A noise of hammering and drills. The corporate signage has been
scraped off the race car and the seats ripped out. Bernie Rose
has bought his partner Nino to the garage to take a look at his
investment.
NINO
...We paid three hundred fucking grand for
this?
BERNIE ROSE
I paid for it. Out of my own pocket.
Anyway, that's just the shell. You start
with the shell, then you build the frame,
then the motor.
(Pointing to an engine nearby)
I paid three hundred for that. The money
goes on the inside not the outside.
NINO
Fuck that. If I'm gonna blow three hundred
I wanna make sure everyone can see it. Go
waste your money on something else...
Shannon smiles nervously, worried Nino's going to sabotage his
deal with Bernie.
NINO
(Pointing to a Thunderbird)
...How about that fucking pussy mobile over
there.
BERNIE ROSE
You buy it. Shannon sell him the car...
At the far end of the garage Driver hears them laughing, too
busy working on his car to pay any attention. Shannon opens the
door of the Thunderbird and invites Nino to take a seat.
SHANNON
Try her out. She's more comfortable than a
water bed.

NINO
I already got a fucking water bed.
He sits heavily in the car and starts prodding and pressing all
the control buttons as if he wants to break them.
NINO
What does this fucking thing do?
SHANNON
Windshield wipers.
NINO
How about this little clit? I don't know
whether to fuck it or drive it. Fuck it,
I'll drive it...
Bernie Rose shakes his head at his partner's foul language then
looks away, observing Driver quietly.
Driver applies a blow torch to his car, so absorbed in his work
he doesn't hear Bernie Rose approach.
BERNIE ROSE O/S
How you doing?...
Driver hears him and turns off the blow torch, standing up
respectfully. Bernie Rose gives him a friendly smile.
BERNIE ROSE
So, when's our first race?
DRIVER
Soon.
BERNIE ROSE
You gonna be ready?
There's something gently challenging in his gaze.
DRIVER
I hope so...
BERNIE ROSE
Cautious man. Like myself. Don't wanna make
promises you can't keep...
Driver smiles but doesn't respond. Bernie Rose finds him as hard
to talk to as everyone else. Across the garage, Nino sits in the
T-Bird with Shannon, still fucking with him. Bernie watches
them.
BERNIE ROSE
He ever tell you how we met?

Driver shakes his head.
BERNIE ROSE
I did some producing back in the 80's.
Interesting pictures. Kind of European.
Shannon arranged the cars for us and did
all the stunts. I knew he was overcharging
me but I loved having him around. His next
business venture he tried the same thing
with some of Nino's friends they broke his
spine. He never had much luck...
He's about to continue when they're interrupted by a familiar
voice.
STANDARD O/S
Hey!...
Driver turns around and sees Irene's husband, Standard, heading
towards him with a confident smile.
STANDARD
You got a minute? I want to -
BERNIE ROSE
We're talking...
Bernie Rose barely raises his voice but it's full of quiet
menace and authority. Standard pauses, stung, but instinctively
senses this is someone you don't mess with.
STANDARD
I'll wait outside...
Bernie Rose watches him leave with a look of contempt, then
turns back to Driver with a smile, resuming their conversation.
BERNIE ROSE
The reason I'm telling you this is because
he's got a lot invested in you. So do I...
Their eyes stay on each other with just a hint of tension.
BERNIE ROSE
Anything you need just let me know...
Driver nods. Bernie Rose studies him a moment, then finally
walks away.
Passing traffic blurs past. Through the windows of a Mexican
restaurant we see Irene at work, serving tables in her
waitress's uniform.

Driver's parked across the street, watching her from his car. He
hesitates, conflicted, then finally gets out of the car.
Irene walks out of the kitchen with a tray of food, then stops
as she sees Driver sitting at a booth. She looks surprised to
see him, but pleased, serving her table first then heading over.
IRENE
Hi...
DRIVER
Hi...
Their eyes stay on each other, oblivious to the noise.
IRENE
We haven't seen you around in a while. You
must have been pretty busy?...
DRIVER
You look pretty busy yourself...
She smiles, glancing at the tables she's supposed to serve.
IRENE
What can I get you?
DRIVER
I already ate. I just wanted to see how you
were?
His concern touches her and makes her uncomfortable at the same
time.
IRENE
We're okay. Standard thinks he may have
found a job so I can give up my night
shift...
Driver stares back at her with his intense gaze.
IRENE
Benicio misses you...
From the way she says it she could almost be talking about
herself.
IRENE
He keeps asking me to invite you for
dinner...
(CONTINUED)

9/24/10
69 CONTINUED: 69
DRIVER
I'd like that...
His gentle gaze is finally too much for her. She grins, excusing
herself.
IRENE
I better serve some food...
It's only when she has her back turned that we see how hard this
is for her. Driver watches her walk away, lost in thought.
Irene piles some plates of tacos on her tray, bracing herself to
go back out and face Driver -- but when she finally walks out
again he's no longer there.
Driver leans out of his car window and inserts a key to open the
gates of the underground car park.
As Driver descends into the darkness of the car park, he sees a
group of SHADOWY FIGURES walking in the opposite direction,
heading up the ramp, one of them being pushed in a wheelchair.
Their leader, a large, balding man, (COOK), glances in Driver's
direction then looks away.
Driver cruises past the mysterious group and winds his way
further down the car park. Suddenly he notices something else in
the shadows. A figure lies sprawled against one of the pillars.
A smaller figure kneels a few feet away. Driver stops his car
now, climbing out to see what's happened.
The prone figure groans in pain. As Driver approaches he
realizes it's Standard. His face is covered in blood and he
clutches his ribs. The smaller figure is Benicio. He stares at
his father helplessly, then looks up at Driver in tears. Driver
kneels beside Standard, checking nothing's broken.
DRIVER
Can you move?
STANDARD
Where's Benicio?
DRIVER
He's right here...
Driver glances at Benicio. He looks terrified. Standard raises
his head painfully and looks at his son.

STANDARD
It's okay, Benicio. I'm okay...
Driver watches the boy struggling to hold back his tears.
STANDARD
(GENTLY)
Don't say anything to your mother, you
understand? This is between you and me.
Benicio nods, too choked-up to speak. Standard turns to Driver.
STANDARD
Can I use your bathroom to clean up? I
don't want Irene to come home and see me
like this...
Standard is bent over the sink, splashing water on his face. As
he turns off the tap he notices how neatly Driver's laid out his
toothbrush, shaving cream, and razor. He finally turns around
and looks at Driver.
STANDARD
Thanks. Sorry about getting all this blood
everywhere...
He's still shaken but tries to pass it off with a smile.
STANDARD
Fucking punks took me by surprise...
Driver watches him, unconvinced.
DRIVER
Fucking punks didn't look like they needed
to...
Standard looks at him in surprise now.
STANDARD
You saw them, huh?...
Driver doesn't answer, waiting for him to continue. Standard
hesitates, still not sure whether to trust him.
STANDARD
You ever been inside?
DRIVER
Why?

73 CONTINUED: 73
Standard takes another glance at the items laid out neatly by
the sink.
STANDARD
I owed some protection money in the joint.
Driver begins to see how worried he is.
DRIVER
How much?
STANDARD
They want twenty thousand. I told them I
couldn't pay so they want me to do a job
for them...
DRIVER
Is that why you need a car?
Standard stares back at him.
STANDARD
What did you say you were inside for?
DRIVER
I didn't.
A beat, then he finally opens up.
STANDARD
It's a pawn shop in the valley. I tried to
back out tonight, they said they'd come
after Irene and Benicio next time...
Driver stares at him in surprise now, more concerned than he
shows.
DRIVER
Why don't you take them away?
STANDARD
Where would I go? Irene finds out I fucked
up again I'll lose everything...
He sounds upset, angry with himself.
STANDARD
This lousy job's my only way out...
Driver stares at his battered face and the blood stains on his t-
shirt, then walks out of the bathroom to check on Benicio.

9/24/10
Benicio is watching a baseball game on TV, his back to Driver.
DRIVER
You okay?
The little boy nods without turning round, still frightened by
his ordeal.
DRIVER
You want something to drink?
Benicio shakes his head, trying to hide his tears. Driver heads
over, then stops as he notices something in Benicio's hand. The
little boy is clutching it as if he's afraid to let go.
DRIVER
What have you got there?...
Benicio holds out his hand to reveal a small bullet. Driver
stares at it, then looks at him.
DRIVER
Who gave you that?...
BENICIO
One of those men. He told me not to lose
it...
Driver gazes at the little boy's frightened face in concern now,
his eyes faraway, thinking to himself.
75 OMITTED 75
Driver sits at the dinner table with Standard, Irene and Benicio
now. Standard's in high spirits, beaming at his wife.
STANDARD
...I was such a jerk the first time we met.
We're at this party and I see the most
beautiful girl I ever laid eyes on and I
walk over and say, `Hello Miss, my name's
Standard Guzman'. She takes one look at me
and asks, `Where's the deluxe version?'...
(HE LAUGHS)
It took me like a minute to get it...

Irene smiles awkwardly, glancing at Driver. Benicio grins, eager
to please his dad.
STANDARD
You don't get it either do you, Benicio?
Hope you didn't inherit your Papa's brains.
He ruffles his son's hair then pours himself another shot of
tequila. Irene notices he's drinking, turning to Driver.
IRENE
Would you like some more chicken?
DRIVER
Thanks...
Their eyes stay on each as she serves him. Standard sees the
look between them but his only reaction is to drain his glass
and tuck into his food.
STANDARD
Now this is what I call a deluxe chicken.
Irene and I are gonna open a restaurant
together once I raise the money. That's why
she's working in that Mexican joint. Figure
out how it's done. She's got more ambition
than anyone I know, more smarts too...
(He raises his glass)
We're gonna drive all those fucking
Mexicans out of business -
IRENE
STANDARD -
STANDARD
Excuse my language, Benicio...
IRENE
(Changing the subject)
How's the movie going?...
DRIVER
Fine...
Irene looks at Standard as he pours himself another drink.
IRENE
Don't you think that's enough?
STANDARD
Come on, we're celebrating. I've got my
family around me and our new friend...

He raises his glass to Driver now. Driver senses how nervous he
is about the job ahead, and how uncomfortable he is depending on
someone his wife clearly admires.
IRENE
Are you working on anything else?
STANDARD
Stop asking the poor guy all these
QUESTIONS -
IRENE
(LOSING PATIENCE)
Then why don't you go ahead and talk for
all of us.
STANDARD
All right, I will. This time next week I'm
gonna take you and Benicio away with me...
Irene stops and looks at him in surprise.
STANDARD
Where you wanna go, Benicio?...
His quiet confidence concerns her even more.
BENICIO
Disneyland.
STANDARD
Forget Disneyland. I'm gonna take you and
your mother away from this bullshit city -
IRENE
Benicio, it's time for bed -
STANDARD
Your papa's got it all figured out -
IRENE
Benicio, you heard me -
STANDARD
It's okay. I'll take him...
Standard gets up from the table, lifting Benicio up in his arms
and carrying him back to his bedroom. Driver watches them. Even
in this kind of mood Standard's clearly devoted to his son.
Irene waits until they're gone, then turns back to Driver.
IRENE
I'm sorry.

78 CONTINUED: (3) 78
DRIVER
Don't worry...
She hesitates, torn, then looks up at him again, needing to
confide in someone.
IRENE
Every time he makes that speech about
taking me and Benicio away from here he's
in some kind of trouble...
Driver sees the deep concern in her eyes and feels even more
torn. Irene gets up, clearing away some plates.
Driver strides through the parking lot and climbs in his car.
Driver sits in the car as if it's his retreat from the world. He
stares out, then turns on a stop watch, listening to it tick,
finding his balance again in the familiarity of the ritual.
Driver glances in his rear-view mirror and sees the Chrysler on
his tail. It doesn't seem to be trying to close the gap, just
following at a discreet distance. In the back seat, Blanche zips
open the gym bag, then stares in shock.
BLANCHE
...Christ, there wasn't supposed to be this
much money!...
There are literally stacks of hundred dollar bills crammed
inside the gym bag. Driver catches her reaction in the mirror,
but his attention is focussed on the Chrysler. Up ahead, at an
intersection, the lights turn red. Driver thinks about running
them, but decides against it, braking sharply. The Chrysler
draws up beside him, its windows glinting in the sunlight.
BLANCHE
Move for Chrissakes!...
Driver ignores her, still watching the Chrysler out of the
corner of his eye. The lights change to green but Driver doesn't
move. Nor does the Chrysler. Behind them, other cars start
honking their horns. Suddenly Driver roars off, swerving left at
speed.
The Chrysler reacts, screeching off in pursuit.
Driver floors the gas. On speed and power his vehicle may be no
match for the Chrysler, but in traffic the odds are even. He
weaves his way past the slower cars, putting obstacles between
himself and the Chrysler. The pursuing car matches him move for
move, staying on his tail.
In the back seat, Blanche looks terrified, buckling herself in.

Driver swerves left then suddenly makes a hard right onto a
deserted canyon road. The mustang somehow manages to make
the same turn. It gets close enough to "pit" Driver, its nose
pressing against the rear corner of Driver's vehicle.
Driver's almost run off the road, but manages to save it and
regains control of his car.
The Mustang pulls out wide to build momentum and smash into
him. As it moves in to deliver the knockout blow, Driver
pulls the Emergency Brake and spins 180 degrees, causing the
Mustang to miss and lose control for a brief moment.
Now the two cars are nose to nose, barrelling down the road,
Driver heading in reverse as fast as he can, the Mustang
closing fast.
It rams Driver's front bumper. BAM! The two cars separated
for an instant.
The Mustang guns it, ready to smash into Driver again...
Driver clocks an upcoming three way intersection dotted with
construction equipment. In a last ditch attempt to evade his
pursuer he throws a reverse 180, then incredibly keeps going,
spinning 270 degrees.
The Mustang tries to make the same turn, but this time the
maneuver is beyond his ability. Driver's suckered him into a
corner he can't control.
The Mustang crashes into the construction equipment in a
sickening crunch of metal on metal.
Driver guns the motor and speeds away.

9/24/10
The black gym bag lies open on a double bed, full to the brim
with stacks of cash. Blanche sits on the bed, looking pale.
DRIVER
How much did Cook tell you you could expect
to net?
BLANCHE
Forty Grand...
She glances at the bag, staring at how much more money there is.
Driver switches on the cheap TV set with the remote, flicking
through the news channels. There's no mention of the robbery
yet. He zips up the bag and heads out.
DRIVER
Stay here. Don't answer the door...
Blanche nods, too shaken to protest.
In the living room we can see Irene sitting on the couch with a
male and female POLICE OFFICER, looking dazed, taking in the
news of Standard's death.
INTERCUT
Driver pauses, still on the phone to Benicio.
DRIVER
Tell her I'll call later...
A soap opera plays on the TV. Driver walks back into the motel
room. Blanche lies on the bed, looking more relaxed. Driver
picks up the remote and flicks through the channels until he
finally finds a breaking news story on the robbery. There is a
police mug-shot of Standard on screen.
TV REPORT
...The armed robber was pronounced dead at
the scene. He was identified as Standard
Guzman of Echo Park, Los Angeles...
Driver listens to the report in silence. Blanche seems upset
again, confronted with the reality of what's happened.
TV REPORT
...Other details are unclear but the owner
of the pawn shop told reporters that the
robber had no accomplices and that the
items he'd taken had been recovered. In
other news...
Driver switches off the TV, staring at the blank screen in
surprise. He turns to Blanche.
DRIVER
The guy saw you grab the money and jump in
the car -- why didn't he say anything?
BLANCHE
I've no idea.
DRIVER
Any idea there'd be another car waiting?

This time she takes a fraction too long to answer.
BLANCHE
I already told you everything -
Driver suddenly slaps her -- hard.
DRIVER
You just got a little kid's father killed.
You think I won't hurt you?
He raises his hand to slap her again and this time she talks,
tears welling in her eyes.
BLANCHE
...Cook told me another car would hold us
up...but he never said anything about this
much money or anyone getting killed...
Driver stares at her quietly, beginning to put the pieces
together in his head.
DRIVER
You were gonna rip us off and split the
take?
She nods guiltily.
DRIVER
How long have you known him?
BLANCHE
Just a couple months. We were fooling
around. I've never been mixed up in
anything like this -
DRIVER
You know his real name?
BLANCHE
He told me it was Chris, but I just called
him Cook.
DRIVER
You're going to take me to him right now,
you understand?
She nods, terrified, tears running down her face.
BLANCHE
....Can I go wash up?...
Driver nods distractedly, his mind racing. Blanche heads over to
the bathroom.

86 CONTINUED: (2) 86
As she disappears inside Driver notices something on the bed
where she's just been lying. It's her cell phone. Still flipped
open as if she's called someone recently.
Driver reaches for the cell phone when he notices the silhouette
of a MAN crossing the curtains. Someone's outside. The door
handle of the motel room starts to turn, slowly -- then suddenly
there's the roar of a shotgun from the bathroom.
Driver reacts in an instant, rushing towards the bathroom door.
He has to barge it open, something obstructing his way.
Driver almost trips over Blanche's sprawled body as he bursts
through. One quick glance and he knows she's dead - half her
head blown off. Another quick glance and he sees her killer, a
big burly HITMAN, trying to climb through the same bathroom
window where he just shot her.
Driver moves like lightning, grabbing the man's arms before he
can get off another shot and pulling him through the window. The
hitman lands heavily in a sea of broken glass, cutting his
forehead open, blinded momentarily by the blood in his eyes.
Driver takes his opportunity and slams the man's face back into
the glass strewn floor, stunning him for a few more seconds as
they struggle. Crawling away, he grabs the towel rack and pulls
the metal bar off the wall. Using it as a spear he impales the
hitman and grabs his shotgun.
In the bedroom, the 2nd HITMAN finally kicks the door open.
Driver bursts through the bathroom door at the same time --
firing the 1st shooter's shotgun. The force of the blast picks
up the 2nd hitman and flings him against the wall like a rag
doll.
The startling explosion of violence is over just as suddenly as
it began. Driver slumps to the floor in exhaustion, his hand and
his arm ripped open by the broken glass. There's blood splatter
all over the wall. Neon lights from outside flashing on the dead
man's face. But no panicked footsteps or sirens yet.
Driver crawls over to the dead hitman and rifles through his
pockets. All he finds are a set of car keys.
Shannon stands in his office, listening silently on the phone,
looking like he's been punched in the gut.

SHANNON
Why didn't you tell me?...
All he hears is silence on the other end.
SHANNON
Well, I guess it's done now...
He leans back against a car.
SHANNON
How big's the take?...
DRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE
One million I guess...
SHANNON
Jesus...
He looks dazed by the thought of so much money.
SHANNON
You better bring it over.
DRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE
I'm hurt. I need a doctor to patch me up...
SHANNON
I'll take care of it...
90 OMITTED 90
An underworld doctor, "DOC", a shabbily dressed old man who
looks well past his prime takes out a small bottle of scotch
along with his surgical tools, preparing for Driver's arrival.
Shannon watches him uncertainly then heads downstairs as he
hears a noise in the garage.
Shannon arrives downstairs to see Driver walking unsteadily
towards him in the gloom. Shannon can't help glancing at his
hands, expecting him to be carrying the bag with the money, but
there's no sign of it.
Scissoring Driver's blood soaked shirt away Doc examines the
shards of glass embedded in his arm, then notices the deep scars
running down his back.

DOC
...Looks like you got more metal inside you
than a ten ton truck...
(His hand shakes)
You'd be better off with a mechanic not a
medic...
Driver looks up at him warily from Shannon's pull out bed.
DOC
Relax. Just having my fun with you...
Doc picks up his bottle of scotch from among his bowls of
Peroxide and Betadine, takes a drink, then offers it to Driver.
DOC
Take a hit off that. Chances are you'll
need it...
Driver shakes his head, closing his eyes. Shannon watches him
quietly, concerned for him but also curious about the money.
SHANNON
What did you do with the cash?
DRIVER
It's safe.
Shannon hesitates, but can't help himself.
SHANNON
You want me to look after it for you?
Driver doesn't answer, gritting his teeth as Doc pulls out the
largest shard of glass.
SHANNON
Just think what we could do with all that
DOUGH -
DRIVER
Two guys just tried to kill me for it. I
want to find out who it belongs to first...
Shannon nods, coming back down to earth.
SHANNON
This guy Cook got a real name?...
DRIVER
Maybe Chris. Probably not...
SHANNON
I'll ask Bernie if he's heard of him...

Driver grimaces again as Doc pulls out another shard of glass.
SHANNON
I wish you'd talked to me first...
Driver doesn't reply, his eyes fixed on the ceiling.
SHANNON
Lotta guys fall for other mens' wives, but
you're the only one I know robs a joint to
make it up to the husband...
An elegant apartment full of framed photographs of beautiful
grandchildren and movie posters from Hollywood's golden age.
Bernie is in his silk pyjamas, looking like he's just woken up.
BERNIE ROSE
You want some coffee?
SHANNON
No, thanks...
Shannon looks tense but tries to hide it. From next door they
can hear the sound of raised voices. Bernie Rose grabs the TV
remote and turns up the volume to drown out his neighbors.
BERNIE ROSE
They've been going at it ever since they
moved in. She's such a nice lady but it's a
lousy Shidach. It's a wonder they haven't
killed each other...
(A BEAT)
So, what's your interest in the Seventh
Heaven?
Shannon doesn't understand, looking confused.
BERNIE ROSE
It's a strip joint on La Cienega. Your
friend Cook runs it. Why're you curious
about him all of a sudden?
Even though they're close, Shannon's wary of giving away too
much information.
SHANNON
A friend of mine owes him some money. I was
wondering if you knew him?
BERNIE ROSE
Yeah, I know him. He's a crazy Albanian. If
I were your friend I'd pay up.

Bernie Rose pours himself a cup of coffee in the kitchenette.
BERNIE ROSE
You wake me up this early this friend must
be a close friend?
SHANNON
(HESITATING)
Yeah...
BERNIE ROSE
How's our car by the way?
SHANNON
We're all set for next month.
BERNIE ROSE
And our driver?
SHANNON
He's doing great.
BERNIE ROSE
That's what you should worry about...
Shannon smiles back but Bernie senses how distracted he is.
BERNIE ROSE
You want my advice? Let your friend work it
out for himself. Don't take pills for other
people's headaches...
(HE GRINS)
You got twenty minutes? I need you to run
down to the market and get me some milk...
95 OMITTED 95
Sunlight pours through a doorway. Driver heads down some stairs,
passing some half naked STRIPPERS at the bar. There's a handful
of CLIENTS watching a pole dance, but otherwise the place is
empty. Driver turns down a long corridor. A couple of STRIPPERS
emerge from their changing room, surprised to see him, but he
puts them at ease with a friendly smile.
DRIVER
Cook moved office again?
STRIPPER
That one over there...
Driver smiles gratefully, then heads towards an office at the
end of the corridor. He knocks on the door. A voice calls back.

COOK O/S
It's open...
Driver takes a hammer out of his jacket, then starts turning the
door handle as if he can't get in.
COOK O/S
It's open, goddamit!...
He hears Cook striding impatiently towards the door now. He
waits, then suddenly kicks the door open, right in Cook's face.
Before Cook can recover, Driver storms into the office, smashing
him across the shoulder with the hammer. Cook collapses in a
heap. Driver's about to hit him again, when he sees that Cook's
left hand is broken and there are cuts and bruises on his face.
Someone's clearly given him a beating since the robbery.
DRIVER
Should've figured you for a shill. Who were
you fronting for?
COOK
Fuck you -
Driver smashes the hammer into Cook's right hand now, breaking
it too. Cook screams. Some of the strippers have gathered at the
door but Driver couldn't care less.
DRIVER
Whose money am I holding?
COOK
Don't worry. They'll come get it. You don't
know who you're fucking with -
Driver smashes the hammer into the metal plates supporting
Cook's left hand. He screams like a stuck pig.
DRIVER
Who's money am I holding?
COOK
(Barely able to get the words out)
Fuck you...
The strippers look stunned and riveted at the same time. Driver
bends over Cook and rifles through his pockets. Finally he finds
what he's looking for. Cook's cell phone. He scrolls down the
call log and finds the same number appearing again and again.
97 OMITTED 97

9/24/10
The kitchen is busy, CHEFS taking out hot pizzas from the oven
and slicing them up in takeaway boxes. In the background we hear
the phone ringing.
An impeccably dressed MAN IN A TAN SUIT answers the phone.
TAN SUIT
Hello?...I'm afraid we're closed. Could you
call back after twelve...
Tan Suit walks into the dining area. A large bull of a man sits
on his own in the empty restaurant with his back to us. It's
only when he hears Tan Suit approach and turns around that we
realize it's Nino, Bernie's partner.
Nino hangs up. Behind him we see that Tan Suit is also in the
room, waiting for his orders.
Irene is sitting on the couch next to Benicio, talking to him
gently as he watches TV.
IRENE
...I'll be back before you go to bed. How's
that sound?...
The little boy nods, watching his Japanese cartoon. Irene's
friend, Cindy, is also there, gazing at them both in sympathy.
Irene looks up at her.
IRENE
Are you going to be okay?
CINDY
We'll be fine...
Irene gets up to leave when the buzzer rings. She walks over and
opens the door then stops in surprise. Driver stands there.
DRIVER
You got a minute?...
She looks at him in a daze.
IRENE
Where have you been?...
He stares back at her in silence.
IRENE
I tried to reach you. Standard's been -
DRIVER
I know...
His eyes stay on her, as if he's trying to tell her something
more. She looks confused, staring back at him curiously when a
small voice interrupts.
BENICIO O/S
Hey...
Driver looks over at the little boy.
DRIVER
Hey...

Irene begins to see the guilt in his eyes and slowly it hits
her. She stares in disbelief, reeling.
DRIVER
I'm sorry about your father...
Benicio nods. Driver keeps staring at the boy but can't find any
more words of comfort. Irene watches him, still stunned. He
looks back at her.
IRENE
I can't talk now. I have to go.
DRIVER
Can I give you a ride?
She stares at him in dismay, close to tears.
IRENE
The car's working fine.
DRIVER
Then let me walk you down...
She wants to say no but can't.
Driver and Irene head down the long corridor in silence.
IRENE
(Almost a whisper)
Why?...
Driver misunderstands, thinking she's talking about Standard.
DRIVER
He was into one of the prison gangs for a
lot of money. He was trying to protect you.
IRENE
Great job...
She walks faster now, striding towards the elevator. Driver
follows her.
DRIVER
I still have the money. Whatever you need -
She turns around and slaps him hard.
IRENE
What are you, a bank? I work for a living.
I don't need your widow's pension!

105 CONTINUED: 105
Her eyes well up with tears, staring at him in anger and
frustration.
IRENE
Just tell me one thing. How did he talk you
into it?
DRIVER
He didn't talk me into anything. I've been
doing this my whole life. It's what I do...
She stares at him in deep disappointment.
IRENE
Stupid me...
She turns away when the elevator bell rings. The doors open,
revealing TAN SUIT. Neither Driver or Irene recognizes him but
we do. He smiles, pretending to look confused.
TAN SUIT
Sorry, I'm supposed to be going down...
IRENE
So are we...
She steps into the elevator. Driver follows her in.
TAN SUIT
Which floor?
DRIVER
Parking lot, please...
Tan Suit presses the button and the doors slide shut.
Driver and Irene ride down in silence, their eyes fixed on each
other. Tan Suit watches them quietly, considering a move, but
Driver glances at him and he smiles, biding his time. The lights
on the panel descend. The elevator bell finally rings as they
reach the lower level. Tan Suit hesitates, but Driver waits for
him to go out first. He nods goodnight and heads off into the
darkness of the parking lot. Driver follows Irene, the two of
them heading in the opposite direction.
The overhead lights flicker, the huge underground car park
hidden in shadow. Driver walks alongside Irene in silence. In
the distance Tan Suit's footsteps slowly fade.

107 CONTINUED: 107
DRIVER
I'm leaving. I want you to come with me...
Irene can't believe what she's hearing.
IRENE
What are you talking about?
DRIVER
You and Benicio...
She's almost too stunned to speak, walking even faster now.
IRENE
You're crazy. I don't even know you -
DRIVER
You will. Once I straighten out this thing
I'm getting out for good. We'll go some
place. Anywhere you want.
She shakes her head, fighting her feelings for him.
IRENE
It doesn't work like that.
DRIVER
Why not?...
She stops and looks at him.
IRENE
Because people like you never get out. And
I don't want my son to grow up like that...
She holds his gaze with regret. Driver's about to respond when
suddenly he catches a fleeting movement out of the corner of his
eye.
A beat -- then he suddenly lunges -- grabbing Irene and pulling
her to the ground. In the same instant Tan Suit appears out of
the darkness, opening fire with his automatic.
Bullets spark as they hit the concrete floor and the other
parked vehicles. Driver drags Irene behind a car now, covering
her with his body as Tan Suit fires another burst.
More sparks light up the darkness, the bullets penetrating the
car with ease, narrowly missing Driver and Irene.
Driver moves again, dragging the terrified Irene behind him. Tan
Suit loses sight of them in the darkness, striding past rows of
parked cars.
(CONTINUED)

9/24/10
107 CONTINUED: (2) 107
Driver turns to Irene as they take cover behind a pillar. She
looks terrified -- not just of Tan Suit but of him. It's as if
all her worst fears have been confirmed.
Driver stares back at her, then hears Tan Suit's footsteps
approaching.
He holds her gaze apologetically, then gets to his feet and
runs, trying to draw Tan Suit's fire.
Tan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up
the darkness. Driver keeps moving. Tan Suit strides after him,
reloading, when suddenly his gun jams.
Crouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his
chance, darting out after his pursuer. Tan Suit sees him coming
and runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now.
Still lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing
footsteps.
Driver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the
time. Tan Suit looks desperate now, tiring. He turns to face his
pursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a
car.
Tan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs
him, swinging him around, smashing him into another car.
Irene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She
picks herself up and runs towards the elevator.
Driver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the
resistance out of him. As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs
him by the throat and rams his head into a car window.
The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering
Tan Suit's skull.
Driver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the
elevator, framed against the light.
She stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out.
Driver stands there, his hands covered in Tan Suit's blood. The
elevator doors finally close, hiding Irene from view.
108 OMITTED 108
Bernie Rose looks quietly furious.
BERNIE ROSE
...I already gave you my advice. You should
have taken your money and left this guy
alone.
Nino and Cook sit opposite him, both of Cook's hands broken now.
NINO
It's not that simple, Bernie.
BERNIE ROSE
Not now that it's bounced up in your face.
COOK
Mr. Paolozzi, I owe you this guy. Just give
me the okay and I'll -
BERNIE ROSE
You like taking orders, go shut the blinds.
He looks at Cook's broken hands.
BERNIE ROSE
Sun's in my eyes...
Nino doesn't look at Cook, a clear indication he should do as
he's told. Cook stands up, humiliated, and walks over to the
windows. Bernie Rose waits for Nino to explain.
NINO
...The money belonged to a half assed
wiseguy from Philly. I had a tip-off he was
keeping a million in a pawn shop and was
gonna invest it here in LA, try to run a
rival operation. I wanted to teach him a
lesson...
The lights in the restaurant gradually fade as Cook shuts the
blinds.
BERNIE ROSE
(INCREDULOUSLY)
You stole from the East Coast mob?
NINO
I stole from a jumped up punk who was gonna
step on our business -

BERNIE ROSE
And where did this punk find a million
dollars? You ever consider he may have
consulted some higher-ups? You even bother
to check? -
NINO
I don't give a fuck who gave him their
blessing. This is my city -
BERNIE ROSE
Your city? This is a big city, pal, and
last time I checked we were partners! -
NINO
We are partners -
BERNIE ROSE
Then why the fuck didn't you come to me
before you set up your dummy robbery or
hired this fucking amateur?!...
Cook sits back down at the table, having closed the blinds. Nino
looks almost embarrassed for once.
NINO
This was off to the side, Bernie. I didn't
wanna involve you.
BERNIE ROSE
Well, now you fucked up I am involved.
Anyone finds out you stole from the family
they'll kill both of us -
NINO
What family? These fucks still call me a
kike to my face. I'm fifty nine years old,
they pinch my cheek, treat me like a
fuckin' kid. They're the reason we left New
York in the first place. Decrepit old men
waving us over to their dinner and domino
tables to complain.
BERNIE ROSE
Those old men gave us the funds to move out
here.
NINO
And I made them a lotta money. I made you a
lotta money too...
He stares at Bernie, genuinely indignant now.
(CONTINUED)

9/24/10
110 CONTINUED: (2) 110
NINO
I pay them half of everything I fucking
earn and then they set up some fucking kid
from Philadelphia just because he's a
fucking wop!
There's a hint of sympathy in Bernie's eyes.
BERNIE ROSE
The money always flows up, Izzy. You know
that.
He calls Nino by his childhood name now, emphasizing the fact
that they're both outsiders in this organization. For the first
time Nino's tough guy act slips and he looks anxious.
NINO
That's why this driver has to go. Him, and
maybe your friend Shannon, are the only two
people who can tie me to the robbery.
BERNIE ROSE
What about this prick?
He doesn't even bother to look at Cook.
COOK
Mr. Paolozzi -
NINO
Shut up...
The two friends stare at each other as if Cook didn't exist.
BERNIE ROSE
Are you asking my permission?
NINO
I'm asking for your help. I shoulda' come
to you first, Bernie. I know that. We're a
team.
He stares at Bernie apologetically, appealing to their
friendship.
NINO
I'll pay you back the three hundred you
spent on the race car.
BERNIE ROSE
It's not about the money...
He stares out quietly, torn.

BERNIE ROSE
All right...
Nino nods in gratitude.
BERNIE ROSE
(TO COOK)
Pass the salt...
Cook hesitates, thinking Bernie's fucking with him for having
two broken hands. He stares back dumbly and it's the final
straw. Bernie suddenly grabs a stainless steel fork and rams it
in his eye. As Cook screams, Bernie takes a knife and buries it
in his neck. He twists the knife deeper for good measure, then
with one powerful sweep of his arm clears Cook off the table.
Cook's not dead yet, just writhing on the floor, choking on his
own blood. Bernie Rose keeps his eyes fixed on Nino.
BERNIE ROSE
Your turn to clean up after me...
Shannon limps down the steps from his office with a suitcase in
his hand. He heads into the main garage then suddenly stops.
Bernie Rose stands beside the stock car, waiting for him.
BERNIE ROSE
All these priceless cars, you should get
better locks...
SHANNON
Door's always open to you...
Bernie Rose heads towards him with his hands in his coat
pockets.
BERNIE ROSE
Going somewhere?
SHANNON

SHANNON
You break in like this I figure it's bad
news.
BERNIE ROSE
It's bad luck. Two thousand heists in this
city a year, he had to pick the wrong one.
SHANNON
He tried to put it right.
BERNIE ROSE
Picked the wrong guy for that too. My
partner's a belligerent asshole with his
back against the wall...
He stops, facing Shannon.
BERNIE ROSE
Right now so am I. I don't take care of
this I'm in big trouble...
He stares at his old friend.
BERNIE ROSE
Any idea where he is?
SHANNON
Probably across the border by now. Mexico.
Belize. That's where I'd go...
Bernie Rose smiles, not believing a word.
BERNIE ROSE
He just walked out on you after everything
you've done for him, took all the money?
SHANNON
That's gratitude, I guess.
Bernie Rose can't help grinning, fond of Shannon despite
everything.
BERNIE ROSE
I ever tell you how long Izzy and I been
friends? Since we were six. Only Jews in a
neighborhood of wops. Long as I can
remember he was getting me into trouble and
I was getting him out of scrapes...
He looks almost apologetic.

BERNIE ROSE
Anyone else I'd take your side...
SHANNON
Anyone else I'd do the same...
Bernie Rose watches him with a mixture of affection and regret.
BERNIE ROSE
What's this fucking kid to you anyway?
Shannon shrugs, no idea himself.
BERNIE ROSE
I leave here without finding out where he
is, there'll be others coming after me. I
guarantee they'll be too stupid to figure
out you won't talk and drag this out
unnecessarily...
SHANNON
Then I'm glad you got here first...
Bernie Rose holds his gaze, then looks away, admiring the shiny
stock car.
BERNIE ROSE
You know, it's too bad, I was getting
excited about our race team, having my name
all over the car. I think we could have
made something of this business...
SHANNON
Nah, I'd have fucked it up too...
Shannon smiles, reconciled with himself. Bernie Rose grins, and
extends his hand. They shake hands firmly, like old friends,
when suddenly Shannon recoils, as if he's been stung.
We see now that his shirt sleeve is covered in blood, his vein
cut all the way from his elbow to his wrist. He looks dazed,
paralysed with shock.
Bernie Rose holds a razor knife in his hand, the blade wet with
Shannon's blood. He takes Shannon gently by the arm and sits him
down against the boot of the stock car.
BERNIE ROSE
You won't feel a thing. Close your eyes and
you'll fall asleep...
Shannon stares out numbly, the life ebbing out of him. Bernie
Rose watches him quietly, wiping his bloody razor with a
handkerchief.
73
9/24/10
Bernie Rose replaces the razor knife in a small lacquered box
full of other knives. From next door he can hear his neighbors
arguing again. He stands there a moment, deflated, then suddenly
storms towards his front door.
Sunlight glints on the parked vehicles by the curb. Driver slows
down as he approaches the sign for Shannon's Custom Kings,
glancing out of the window to see if anyone's staking out the
garage. Satisfied there's no-one there, he drives through.
Driver pulls open the garage door and sees the rows of vintage
cars shimmering in the shafts of sunlight. As he heads past the
vehicles he suddenly spots a figure slumped against the stock
car. Shannon's eyes have been closed, his head resting gently
against the trunk of the car.
Driver kneels down and lifts him up in his arms, holding him for
a second, then lays him down on the floor. He turns back and
opens the car boot now, revealing the black gym bag full of
money.
Nino stands in the kitchen, wearing a beautiful suit but no
shoes or socks, listening on his cell phone. We hold on the
curious image for a moment, then reveal a beautifully dressed
WOMAN polishing his shoes. And now we see more of Nino's MEN,
also smartly dressed and accompanied by GORGEOUS WOMEN, getting
ready for an event. Nino's talking to his wife on the phone.
NINO
Alright honey, I'll pick you up in an hour.
Several of Nino's men look up as Driver enters but none of them
recognize him.
NINO'S GUY
We're closed...
Driver stares past them at Nino in the kitchen, surrounded by
more of his men. We feel his mind calculating then he walks out
again.
Driver drifts in behind a couple of other cars, keeping them
between himself and the Lincoln.
The CHAUFFEUR checks his mirror as he turns into another street,
seeing only the anonymous glare of headlights behind him.
Driver slows down and lets another car turn in front of him,
keeping it between himself and Nino's car.
Driver cruises along another residential street. At every
intersection we glimpse the Lincoln heading in the same
direction down a parallel street.
Nino's talking on a cell phone in the back seat.
NINO
...Sure, Carlo, I'll send him your
regards...
Driver merges in with the traffic, weaving between the cars in
front of him until he has Nino's Lincoln back in his sights.
Nino's car turns into 7th Street.
This time there are no other vehicles turning into the same
street. Driver has no choice, settling in behind the Lincoln.
The chauffeur glances in his rear-view mirror and spots Driver's
car for the first time. For now he doesn't give it much thought.
In the back seat Nino finally says goodbye on the phone.
NINO
...Nice talking to you too...
(As he hangs up)
Asshole...
The chauffeur checks his mirror again and notices Driver's car
still on his tail. Just as a precaution he slows down, seeing if
the pursuing car will overtake.
Driver has to decide in an instant whether to take up the
invitation. He overtakes the Lincoln, speeding ahead.
Nino's chauffeur sees Driver's car disappear up ahead, relaxing
now.
Driver puts his foot on the gas, taking sharp turns on small
side streets, driving fast around the block until he's back on
the Lincoln's tail, keeping a safe distance now.
Nino's chauffeur turns right into the Pacific Coast Highway.
Driver follows the Lincoln at a distance, keeping the winding
corners of the PCH between himself and his prey.
In the back seat Nino dials another number on his cell-phone.
NINO
...Bernie, it's me...
Bernie Rose stands by the window, listening to the phone in
silence.
78
9/24/10
Nino sounds apologetic.
NINO
...Look, about that thing today...I'm
sorry. I know how much you liked the guy...
In his rear view mirror the chauffeur sees the headlights of the
car behind getting closer.
Driver stares ahead, his eyes fixed on the Lincoln's backlights.
Bernie Rose doesn't speak, looking weary.
NINO O/S
Bernie?...
BERNIE ROSE
Yeah?...
NINO O/S
You're the only fucking person in the world
I trust. I love you, man...
Bernie shakes his head, the same old apologies.
In the front seat Nino's chauffeur checks his mirror curiously.
NINO
When this is over I'll make it up to you, I
swear...
The lights of the car behind have vanished.
Even though he's still angry, Bernie can't help forgiving his
childhood friend.
BERNIE ROSE
How many times I heard that before...
79
9/24/10
Nino grins.
NINO
I lost count -
Suddenly blazing headlights explode to life behind him.
Driver rams the Lincoln at over a hundred miles an hour, hitting
it just above the left rear wheel.
Bernie Rose is left holding the phone as the line goes dead.
The collision has barely knocked Driver off course. His car
skids to a stop near the overturned wreck.
Among the carnage, we see Nino, bloodied but still alive. He
unbuckles his seat belt and crawls out of the twisted wreck.
A phone shrills. Bernie Rose answers it.
BERNIE ROSE
Nino?
DRIVER'S VOICE ON THE PHONE
He's dead.
Bernie Rose stares out in silence. Whatever he thinks of Nino, a
part of him has died. We feel the regret in his eyes but there's
no trace of emotion in his voice.
BERNIE ROSE
Looks like me, you and your girlfriend are
the only pieces left on the board...
A large Chinese restaurant. We follow Driver through the crowd.
He sees Bernie Rose sitting at a table on his own, pouring
himself a glass of wine. The mobster's dressed for the occasion,
wearing a jacket and tie. He smiles at Driver as he sits down.
BERNIE ROSE
Care for a glass?...
Driver doesn't smile, gazing back at him across the table.
Bernie Rose doesn't seem to care.
BERNIE ROSE
I can recommend the duck. Hell, I can
recommend everything -- Walnut prawns,
shredded beef, Velvet chicken -- but the
duck's to die for...
He delivers the last line with a pointed smile, then turns away,
calling over a WAITRESS.
BERNIE ROSE
The duck, please. For two.
WAITRESS
Anything else?
BERNIE ROSE
No, thanks...
He waits for the waitress to leave, then turns back to Driver.
BERNIE ROSE
You've been on a roll. Cut yourself quite a
swath out there.

Driver holds his gaze, the tension palpable, laughter and
conversation drifting over from the other tables.
BERNIE ROSE
Anyway it's water under the bridge now.
Question is where does that leave us?
DRIVER
That's up to you.
BERNIE ROSE
You bring the cash?
Driver nods. Bernie Rose studies him quietly.
BERNIE ROSE
Tell me something, how does someone with no
interest in money get mixed up in a heist?
(Off his silence)
Shannon told me it was because of the girl?
Driver hesitates, betraying a hint of concern. Bernie sees it
and smiles.
BERNIE ROSE
Don't worry. Nobody else knows about her.
Just me...
(A BEAT)
You still see her?...
DRIVER
She's not interested.
BERNIE ROSE
She's got her head screwed on right. I got
two ex-wives, three kids, four
grandchildren. Not one of them speaks to me
now...
He smiles again, looking into Driver's eyes with just a hint of
sympathy.
BERNIE ROSE
This is what I'll do for you. You give me
the money, nobody knows she exists. But
it's a different matter with you.

BERNIE ROSE (cont'd)
These people I have the misfortune to be
involved with, they don't mind Nino being
gone, but they'll wanna know what happened
to him...
DRIVER
Sounds like we have a problem...
BERNIE ROSE
And just when we were getting to know each
other...
Their eyes are fixed on each other, deadly enemies but kindred
spirits of a kind.
BERNIE ROSE
...We shake hands, say goodbye, it's the
start of your new life. Sooner or later
they'll come after you. No end to it.
Someone gets tired, somebody else takes
their place. It goes on and on. Whatever
dreams you have, whatever plans, you might
as well forget `em, because this is what
it's gonna be like till the day you die...
(A BEAT)
I just thought you should know...
Driver stares back at him quietly.
DRIVER
What do you suggest I do?
BERNIE ROSE
First time I heard about you, Shannon told
me you drove. Fast. That's a start...
He keeps staring at Driver, then smiles.
BERNIE ROSE
Either that or you choke on the duck...
Driver climbs into the front seat of the Camaro, catching his
breath. He sits there a moment, sheltering from the world
outside, then pulls out a pocket knife, opening the blades until
he finds the screwdriver. He starts with the left side of the
steering column, then gets to work on the section below the turn
signal.

His face shows the strain, but his fingers are as steady as
ever. A master at work. Finally he breaks into the ignition
device, leaning back in the seat to take a rest.
Driver's face is completely still now. So are his eyes. He looks
almost at peace. There's a long pause, then slowly he leans
forward and turns on the ignition. As the engine comes to life,
we CUT TO BLACK.
