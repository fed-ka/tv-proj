      steampunk Victorian - Cybertechnology welded to the

      CUT TO THE CYBERSHADE; indoors, it scuttles on all fours,
      like an animal, and it's now racing along the warehouse
      floor, pulling the rope tight behind it -

      The Other Doctor's in a sitting-up position - he's being
      pulled along the floor, on his arse, followed by - 

      CUT TO THE DOCTOR, wrist wrapped around the rope, being
      pulled over the sill, on to the floor -

      FX: WIDE SHOT, the scuttling all-fours Cybershade racing
      along the floor, like a husky with a sled, dragging Other
      Doctor and then the Doctor behind it, fast - both Doctors
      now sliding along on their arses, sending up dust -

      CUs on both men, holding on to the rope, sliding along!

      DEEP 2-SHOT, both men sliding along!

      CUT TO the Doctors' POV of the CYBERSHADE, rope pulled
      tight, as it scuttles towards the opposite wall, where
      there's another big, wide, open window -

      CUT TO BOTH MEN sliding along -

      And cutting the rope!  Bang on the windowsill!

      The Doctors stop!  Tumble into a heap!  Action stopped
                  The 
      dead, both men on the floor.  They unravel the rope off
      their wrists with 'ow!'s and 'ooh's.  Then they look at
      each other.  And they laugh.  Really laugh.  The relief! 

      They stand, dazed, and give each other a great big hug!

                    Is everything in position?

      And he reaches MISS HARTIGAN.  A strong woman, late 30s;
      sexy, albeit in plain, grey clothes - a tight, repressed
      Workhouse Matron's uniform.  Cool, unafraid of Cybermen:

                                    MISS HARTIGAN
                    That's rather dependent on you. 
                    All I can promise is to do my best.

      THE DOCTOR & OTHER DOCTOR walk from the back of the house,
      into the hall, Other Doctor creeping about, investigating,
      looking in drawers, under picture frames, anywhere.  The

      Doctor more intent on studying the Other Doctor.

                    You should make your escape, Mr

                    one more!  Oh I like this!  So
                    what are we looking for, Doctor?

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Signs of alien infiltration.

                    Oh good! 

      And he heads into the DRAWING ROOM, the Doctor following. 

      Large, austere room.  Curtains drawn against the light. 
      Dust in the air.  Both Doctors poking about, searching.

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    It started with a murder.

                    Oh good.  I mean, bad, but whose?

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Mr Jackson Lake.  A teacher of
                      Mathematics, from Sussex.  He came
                    to London three weeks ago, and

                    Hard to say, his body was never

                    secret murders.  Then abductions. 
                    Children, stolen away in silence.

                    The latest murder.  The Reverend
                    Aubrey Fairchild.  Found with burns
                    to his forehead, like some advanced
                    form of electrocution.

                                    THE DOCTOR

                    The Reverend was a pillar of the
                      community.  A member of many Parish
                    Boards.  A keen advocate of

                    what's his connection to the first
                    death, Mr Jackson Lake..?

      But the Other Doctor stops, looks at the Doctor, disturbed.

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    It's funny, I seem to be telling
                    you everything.  As though you
                    engender some sort of... trust.
                          (closer)
                    You do seem familiar, Mr Smith.  I

                    you're wearing a fobwatch.

      The Other Doctor has a fobwatch-on-chain, on his waistcoat,
      now takes it out.  All very solemn between them:

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Is that important?

      During this, behind him, to save time, the Doctor sneaks
      out the sonic, then quickly whirrs it in a semicircle,
      ending with a blip! as it points towards a bureau -

      The Other Doctor turns round, the Doctor pockets the sonic.

                    Wonder what's in here, though...

      Going to the bureau, opening it, Other Doctor joining him -

                    worked something like this...

      Holds up the INFOSTAMP, presses a button at one end:

                    haven't got much power, they need
                    plain old basic Infostamps to update
                      themselves...  Are you all right?

      FX: GRAPHICS PROJECTION dies as the Doctor turns to Other

      NOW INTERCUT with raw CUs of the REVERSE of this POV - THE
      OTHER DOCTOR.  Terrified.  Proper, raw fear.

      Cybermen advance, with metal hands -

      The Other Doctor backing away, trapped - about to die -

      But in his hand -

                    Who are you?

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    I'm a friend.  I swear.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Ah.  Two words I never refuse.

      THE DOCTOR with more energy, now, stepping back, going
      round the room, searching, quickly -

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    But it's not a conversation for a
                    dead man's house, it'll make more

                    your Tardis, hold on, I just need
                    to do a little final check, won't
                    take a tick, cos there's one more
                    thing, I can't help thinking, if
                    this room's got Infostamps, then
                    maybe, just maybe, it's got
                    something that needs infostamping...

      In checking everything, he's heading for an interior door...
                                  Writer's 
      He opens it.

      There's a CYBERMAN standing there.

                  The 
                    Okay.

      And he shuts the door.  Calm:

                                    THE DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    I think we should run.

      - then he leaps out of the way as BAM - !  The door's
      knocked flat, the Cyberman striding out - big CU for -

      The OTHER DOCTOR boggling - on his face, as - 

      His POV of the Cyberman flickers with a fast FLASHBACK of
      the sc.7 Cybermen - terrifying him, frozen to the spot -

      Said, pulling the Other Doctor out into the HALL - the
      Doctor slams the drawing room door, whirrs the sonic to
      lock it - both run towards the rear of the house -

      But there's a SECOND CYBERMAN, advancing from that direction -
      the stomp! stomp! stomp! of its feet -

      - both Doctors run back the way they came -

      BAM!  The Drawing Room door is knocked flat, the FIRST

      They've reached the landing -

                  The 
      Dark corridor.  THE DOCTOR & OTHER DOCTOR backing away - 
      CYBERMEN advancing, stomp! - the Doctor more serious now:

                    in the world who can help you -

      CYBERMAN #1 closer now, lunges forward, hand reaching out -

      The Doctor swings the cutlass -

      And this becomes a duel now, the advancing Cyberman lifting

      CUT TO CU Other Doctor, behind the Doctor - and during
      this, he's so scared - genuinely, gibbering - but not only
      by the Cybermen, he's scared because he hears what the
      Doctor's saying, and he's remembering -

                    But I can't remember.  What happened
                    to me?  What did they do?

      He's helpless.  The Doctor puts his arm round him, gentle:

                    heart of yours is still beating,
                    Doctor...  That one, single heart.

      Once an abandoned brick building, full of barrels and
      crates, now with a layer of junk added on top.  Piles of
      luggage.  A wooden bed, a table laid out for tea; they've
      made this a home.  And it works, it's oddly comfortable.

      As THE DOCTOR looks round, fascinated, the OTHER DOCTOR
      goes to a sink, splashes water on his face, towels dry.

                    Oh, but my new friend is a fighter,
                    Rosita, much like myself!  He faced
                    the Cybermen with a cutlass!  I'm
                    not ashamed to say, he was braver
                    than I, he was quite brilliant.

      But from / on the Doctor.  Again, he sneaks out the sonic,
      does a surreptitious whirr of the luggage, gets a blip,
                                  Writer's 
      pockets the sonic again as the Other Doctor turns round -

                                      OTHER DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                    Are you whistling again?

                  The 
                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Yes.  Yes I am.

      The Other Doctor gets back to finding a coat.  Rosita saw 
      the sonic; the Doctor gives her a silent sssh.  He opens a
      trunk, the one which caused the blip.  Full of clothes. 
      Rosita joins him (Other Doctor busy in b/g).

                                      ROSITA
                    That's another man's property.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Well, a dead man.
                          (goes through clothes)
                    And how did you two meet, then?

                    He saved my life.  Late one night,
                    by the Osterman's Wharf, this
                    creature came out of the shadows. 
                    A man made of metal.  I thought I
                    was going to die.  And then... 
                    There he was.  The Doctor.
                          (quieter)
                    Can you help him, sir?  He has
                    such terrible dreams.  Wakes at
                    night.  In such a state of terror.

      But the Other Doctor, with coat, joins them, now.  Quiet:

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    Come now, Rosita, is it any wonder? 
                    With all the things a Time Lord
                    has seen.  Everything he's lost. 
                    He must surely have bad dreams.

                                    THE DOCTOR

      THE DOCTOR, OTHER DOCTOR & ROSITA sit together.  Dark, a
      brazier burning.  Solemn, like a ghost story:

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    The story begins with the Cybermen. 
                    Creatures from a universe hidden
                    beneath our own, just out of sight. 
                    But then a long time away, and not
                    so far from here... the Cybermen
                    were fought, and they were beaten,
                    and they were sent into a howling
                      wilderness, called the Void.  Locked
                    inside forevermore.  But then a
                    greater battle rose up, so great
                    that everything inside the Void
                    perished.  But as the walls of the
                    world weakened, the last of the
                    Cybermen must have fallen through
                                                          Tale
                    the dimensions.  Back in time.  To
                    land here.  And they found you.

      CU Other Doctor, enthralled, but remembering...  INTERCUT
      with DARK, ENCLOSED SPACE FLASHBACKS as before fast, harsh -

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    I fought them.  I know that.  But
                    what happened..?

      The Doctor goes to the luggage.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    At the same time...  Another man
                    came to London.  Mr Jackson Lake! 
                    Plenty of luggage.  Money in his
                  The 
                    pocket.  Maybe coming to town for
                    the Winter season, I don't know. 
                    But he found the Cybermen, too. 
                    And just like you, exactly like
                    you, he took hold of an Infostamp...

      The Other Doctor scared, quiet; realising, but in denial:

                                      OTHER DOCTOR
                    But he's dead.  Jackson Lake is
                    dead.  The Cybermen murdered him.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You said no body was ever found. 
                    And you kept all his suitcases,
                    but you could never bring yourself
                    to open them.

                    I told you the answer was in the

      The Other Doctor, scared, holds out the fobwatch...

      The Doctor turns it over.

      It's inscribed on the back.  Two letters.  J.L.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You became the Doctor.  Because
                    the Infostamp you picked up was a
                    book about one, particular man.

                    D'you see?  The Infostamp must
                    have backfired.  Streamed all of
                    that information, about me, right

                    Cos an Infostamp is plain
                      technology.  It's not enough to

      Rosita's torn, but runs out.  Leaving poor Jackson alone.

      JACKSON LAKE, all alone.  He's been crying.

      But now he looks up.  And anger is taking over.  He looks
      round.  At the luggage.  Furious. 

      He strides over, starts throwing open cases, trunks, wild -

      FX: they're on the edge of a HUGE UNDERGROUND CHAMBER,
      which disappears down below.  At the edge, a GANGWAY leads
      to...  THE HEAD OF THE CYBERKING, its BODY below
        disappearing into the depths, though it's so big, it's
      still not seen in full; it should be hard to work out
      exactly what it is.  On her level, from this side of the
      gangway, all Miss Hartigan can see, across from her, is a
      huge, metal shape, in Cyber-Victorian-steampunk design,
      which has, inlaid at the centre, a PRAC BUILD THRONE.

      CLOSER on the THRONE, ie, the real, set-build-throne.  A
      CHAIR, like an antique electric chair, wires running out
      of it into the metal cogs-and-wires walls.  CYBERMEN stand
      to attention, either side of the chair, on guard.

                    The chair you designate as 'throne'
                    is not intended for me.  My function
                    is to serve the CyberKing, not to
                    become the CyberKing.
