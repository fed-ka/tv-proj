A huge empty chamber, with a side door leading to a stairwell. 

Eric, Presto and Sheila have already started up it when an energy 

arrow BURSTS in the air ahead of them, bringing them to a halt.

ON ERIC

He looks back O.S.  REFIELD to include Hank, Bobby, Uni and Diana 

standing in the doorway.  Hank has another arrow drawn.

                            HANK 

                Don't do it, Eric!

                            ERIC 

                    (quietly) 

                How you gonna stop me, Hank?

ON HANK

He has an arrow drawn, but not raised.  Now he raises it.  Diana 

and Bobby look at him anxiously.

                            HANK 

                I don't know -- but neither of 

                us wants to find out. 

ANOTHER ANGLE 


Emphasizing the standoff for a moment; then the floor suddenly 

shakes, accompanied by a deep RUMBLING.  Everyone looks about

apprehensively.

                            SHEILA 

                What was that?

ON FLOOR

The RUMBLING comes again, much louder now.  Huge flagstones CRACK.

The cracks web out from the center, becoming fissures.  From the 

fissures flow viscous, jelly like streams of translucent 

protoplasm.

ON DIANA, HANK AND OTHERS

The streams flow toward them, pseudopodia rising and questing 

blindly for them.  Hank pushes Diana and Bobby toward the stairs.

                            HANK 

                Get off the floor -- quick!

WIDE ANGLE

They run quickly up the stairs.  The floor is now covered with the

semi-solid mass, which begins flowing after them.  It rises and 

forms into a huge, amoeba-like creature.  SFX: GURGLING, SLURPING.

REVERSE ANGLE

Hank, Diana, Bobby and Uni join the others, and they all back up 

the stairwell.  The amoeboid surges after them, almost flowing

over 

Uni's front hooves.  She dances back wildly to avoid it.

                            UNI 

                    ("yuck!")

ANOTHER ANGLE 

the kids back up the stairs, weapons ready. The amoeboid flows

glutinously after them.

                            DIANA 

                What is it?

                            PRESTO 

                Whatever it is, it knows what we 

                are: lunch!

FAVOR HANK

He aims the arrow he nocked earlier down O.S.

                            HANK 

                Yeah?  Let's see if it likes its 

                food spicy.

He FIRES the arrow.

ON AMOEBOID

Almost filing the stairwell below them.  The arrow streaks toward 

it.  A pseudopod rises and engulfs it without visible effect, save


28 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


for a luminous rippling that spreads down the pseudopod.  Then the

entire mass surges forward again.

                            ERIC (O.S.) 

                    (gulps) 

                Looks like it liked it just fine!

ON KIDS

Presto steps forward, one hand stirring the air over his hat.

                            PRESTO 

                Lemme try!

His hand dips into the hat and pulls out a glowing sphere of

magic, 

which he hurls O.S.

ON AMOEBOID

It absorbs the magic ball much as it did the arrow, and with much 

be same result.  It flows toward us faster than ever.

AS BEFORE - PRESTO

He looks crestfallen.  The group continues backing up the stairs. 

The amoeboid is gaining on them.

                            PRESTO 

                Where's Steve McQueen when you need 

                him?

                            DIANA 

                We'd better think of something. 

                This bowl of jelly means business.

FAVOR BOBBY

He hefts his club determinedly.

                            BOBBY 

                Yeah?  Well, so do I!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Bobby runs forward O.S.  Sheila grabs for him but misses.

                            SHEILA 

                Bobby!  Be careful!


29 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


ON AMOEBOID

THE Lovecraftian horror rises above Bobby threateningly as he

steps 

INTO SHOT.  Bobby SMASHES his club against one wall of the

stairwell, then the opposite wall.  The walls CRACK and CRUMBLE,

BURYING  the amoeboid beneath tons of debris as Bobby dashes back

O.S.

ON KIDS

They retreat from the dust and flying fragments of rock.

                            SHEILA 

                Bobby?  Are you all right?

A beat; then Bobby runs out from the thick cloud of dust.

                            BOBBY 

                Good news and bad news -- that 

                thing's been buried --

ANGLE ON DUST CLOUD

It clears, revealing that the stairwell is blocked.

                            BOBBY (O. S. CONT'D) 

                But we can't go back down.

FAVORING HANK AND ERIC

Eric looks at Hank in satisfaction.

                            ERIC 

                Which means we have to go up.

Hank looks at him and nods slowly.

                            HANK 

                You win -- for now.

WIDE ANGLE - ALL

They turn away from the cave-in and continue up O.S.

                                                        WIPE TO:





30 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


The topmost part of the cenotaph is the sanctum -- a huge, 

cathedral-like chamber with a gigantic vault on one wall and an 

ornate sarcophagus in the middle of the floor, the lid carved in 

the shape of a figure in repose.  The wall opposite the vault has

collapsed, revealing the abyss beyond the Realm.  The stairwell 

opens off another wall.  Venger and Dungeon Master stand beside 

the sarcophagus.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 

                They are coming, Venger -- doubtful 

                and suspicious of each other and 

                their quest, but still coming.

                            VENGER 

                Bah!  They can yet fail -- and they 

                will.

ANGLE ON VENGER

He looks down at the carved figure on the sarcophagus lid with an 

unreadable expression, then turns away.  We cannot see the

features 

on the figure from this angle.

                            VENGER (CONT'D) 

                Do not celebrate your victory yet, 

                old one.

ON DUNGEON MASTER

He approaches the sarcophagus lid and looks at it.  We still can't

see what's on it clearly.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 

                    (cryptically) 

                It is not I who will be the winner, 

                Venger -- it is you.

A FOOTFALL O.S. causes him to turn.

                            DUNGEON MASTER (CONT'D) 

                They are here.

ON STAIRWELL

Eric, leading the rest, comes into view. He stops and looks 

around him O.S.



31 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                            ERIC 

                So this is it.  Doesn't look like 

                much.

ANGLE INCLUDES SANCTUM

Which is now empty, save for the sarcophagus and the kids.  Diana 

points toward the broken wall and the abyss beyond.

                            DIANA 

                    (awed) 

                Look ...

ON BROKEN WALL

The kids approach cautiously and look out over the ultimate gulf.

                            BOBBY 

                    (awed) 

                It goes on forever ...!

THEIR POV - REALM'S EDGE

An endless cliff dropping into the mists of night thousands of 

miles below.  Stars twinkle in the depths.  Barely visible is the 

suggestion of titanic, continent sized pillars that support the 

Realm.

ON VAULT

Sheila approaches the vault.  Almost hidden among the ornate 

intaglio of its surface is a keyhole.

                            SHEILA 

                There's a keyhole here.  This is 

                a door.

ON SARCOPHAGUS

Presto steps up to the sarcophagus and looks at the face of the 

figure carved on it.  He reacts in astonishment.

                            PRESTO

                Look -- on the lid! It's --

CLOSE ON LID

At last we see clearly the carved figure.  It is a man in


32 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


warrior's 

garb, arms crossed on his chest.  His face, though noble and

serene 

and lacking the fangs, horn, wings, and other accouterments of

evil,  nevertheless is unquestionably that of Venger.

                            PRESTO (O.S. CONT'D) 

                Venger! 

ANOTHER ANGLE

The others gather around, staring at the figure.

                            BOBBY 

                I don't get it.  Who'd want to make 

                old hornhead look good?

FAVORING ERIC

Looking down at the figure.

                            ERIC 

                Only one way to find out. 

                    (beat) 

                Open it.

WIDE ANGLE

The kids all line up on one side of the sarcophagus and push at

the 

heavy stone lid.  With a GRATING of stone on stone, it slides

over.

CLOSE ON SARCOPHAGUS

As the lid moves slowly to one side, revealing the interior of the

sarcophagus.  It is empty, save for an ordinary brass key lying at

the bottom.  PUSH IN on it.

ON ERIC

He reaches in and grabs the key.

                            ERIC 

                We've got the key!  Now all we've 

                got to do is throw it in the abyss 

                and we're home free.

He turns toward the abyss.  Hank ENTERS SHOT, blocking his path.



33 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                            HANK 

                Don't you get it yet?  We'll never 

                get home by trusting Venger.

ANGLE INCLUDES OTHERS

As Hank and Eric face off.

                            ERIC 

                Outta my way, Hank.

Hank shakes his head.

                            HANK 

                No!  I'm right about this -- I 

                know it!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Eric raises his shield -- and then, suddenly, all of them are 

thrown off their feet by the SHATTERING of the floor next to the 

sarcophagus.

                            KIDS 

                    (surprised walla)

ON FLOOR

The amoeboid rises from the floor, pseudopods lashing out in all

directions.  The kids scatter to avoid it.

                            KIDS 

                    (ad lib) 

                Look out!  That thing's back 

                again!  Watch out for those 

                tentacles! (Etc. )

ON ERIC

Bolding the key.  A pseudopod surges THROUGH SHOT, STRIKING his 

shield and sending him sprawling O. S.

                            ERIC 

                    (impact grunt)

ON EDGE OF FLOOR

Eric lands near the edge of the abyss.  He looks at the key, then 

raises his hand to throw it in.


34 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


CLOSE ON HIS HAND

Bank's hand ENTERS SHOT and grabs his wrist.

                            HANK 

               No!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Eric tries to pull his hand from Hank's grasp.

                            ERIC 

                Let me go!

ON DIANA

Backing up before a surging wave of the amoeboid, her staff held 

out before her.  A pseudopod extrudes from the main mass and wraps

about her staff, pulling Diana toward it.  Diana braces her feet, 

but the thing is too strong for her.

                            DIANA 

                    (struggles)

ON PRESTO

Holding his hat out before him as he backs away from the oncoming 

horror.

CLOSE ON HAT

It glows, but before anything can emerge a pseudopod wraps about 

it, closing it and seizing Presto's arms.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Presto is lifted off his feet.  He dangles helplessly in the 

pseudopod's grasp.

                            PRESTO 

                Hey!

ON ERIC AND HANK

They are on their feet now, both holding onto the key. Hank's back

is to the abyss.

                            ERIC 

                Let me do it!  Do you want to be 



35 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                a prisoner here forever?

CLOSE ON HANK

His eyes widen in sudden realization.

                            HANK 

                Eric!  Remember what you said about 

                this whole Realm being a dungeon?

ON ERIC

Still holding onto the key as Hank speaks.

                            HANK (O.S. CONT'D) 

                I think you were right!  We're all 

                prisoners here -- including Venger! 

                And this is the key!

ON UNI

Backed into a corner.  A pseudopod wraps about her and lifts her 

O.S.

                            UNI 

                    (bleat of fear )

ON SHEILA

She flips her hood up over her head as another pseudopod reaches 

for her.  She becomes invisible, but the amoeboid evidently uses 

other senses than sight to track its prey. It wraps about Sheila's

invisible form.

                            SHEILA (V.O.) 

                    (screams)

The hood falls away and she becomes visible again as she is

lifted, 

kicking, off the floor.

ON BOBBY

Backed into another corner, swinging his club to keep a pseudopod 

at bay.  He sees what's happening O.S.

                            BOBBY 

                Sheila!  Uni!



36 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


He raises the club over his head and SLAMS it down on the floor.

WIDE ANGLE - AMOEBOID

The SHOCK WAVE ripples through its protoplasmic form, causing it 

to drop Sheila, Uni, Diana and Presto.

                            SHEILA, UNI, DIANA, PRESTO 

                    (impact grunts)

ON HANK AND ERIC

The SHOCK WAVE rocks them both; Hank lets go of the key, drops his

bow and staggers backward.  He hovers for a second, arms 

windmilling, on the edge of infinity -- then falls.

                            HANK 

                    (trailing cry)

ANOTHER ANGLE

Eric lunges for him, but it's too late -- he's gone.

                            ERIC 

               Hank!

ON AMOEBOID

It's recovered from the effects of Bobby's blow.  The kids are 

grouped together now. The amoeboid flows toward them like a

sentient wave, surrounding them.

ANOTHER ANGLE

They try to free themselves, but it's like trying to run through 

heavy oil.  The protoplasm flows up around them -- another moment 

and it will encase them completely.

                            KIDS 

                    (struggle)

ON ERIC

He looks back toward his O.S. friends, then at the abyss.  He 

looks at the key in his hand.

WIDER ANGLE

Venger suddenly MATERIALIZES before him.  He points toward the 



37 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


abyss.

                            VENGER 

                The key, Cavalier!  Throw it into 

                the abyss -- or you will never see 

                your home again!

ON ERIC

He looks at the abyss, then O.S. in the opposite direction.

HIS POV - VAULT

PUSH IN on it, emphasizing the keyhole.

RESUME ERIC

He makes his decision -- he turns and runs for the vault!

ON VENGER

He spreads his wings in wrath.

                            VENGER 

                    (roars) 

               Stop!

He hurls a MAGIC BOLT O.S.

ON ERIC - RUNNING

The bolt SPLASHES against his shield, staggering him, but he keeps

going.

ON VENGER

He raises his hand to hurl another blast, but just then a

pseudopod 

ENTERS SHOT, wrapping about him, pinning his arms.  He struggles.

                            VENGER 

                    (struggles)

ON VAULT

Eric comes to a halt before the vault.

                            ERIC 

                Hank, you'd better be right --!



38 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


He thrusts the key into the lock and turns it.

ON VENGER

He frees himself of the pseudopod with a BURST of magic.  His eyes

grow wide as he realizes he's too late.

                            VENGER 

               No!

ON VAULT

The massive door swings open.  A cascade of coruscating light 

bursts forth, momentarily silhouetting Eric, who staggers

backward. 

The pyrotechnic forces sweep outward O.S.  APPROPRIATE SFX.

ON KIDS

The amoeboid's mass has nearly risen over their heads when the 

EFX wash over it.  The amoeboid shimmers and VANISHES in a burst

of 

brilliance.  The kids fall to the floor.

ON VENGER

He steps backward, holding his hands out in a futile attempt to 

warn off the magic, which engulfs him.

                          VENGER 

                (cry of fear)

                                                        CUT TO:


As the last of the magic streams out and O.S., leaving Eric 

sitting, dazed, before a huge, empty vault.  Diana, Sheila, 

Presto, Bobby and Uni run INTO SHOT.  Presto helps Eric up.

                        ERIC 

               (awed whisper) 

            Did you see that?

                        PRESTO 

            You kidding?  We were all ringside.

                        DIANA 

            Looks like Hank was right ...

ON ERIC

He reacts to this in shock.

                        ERIC 

            Hank!!

He rushes O.S.  The others follow.

ON EDGE OF ABYSS - UPSHOT

The kids gather around the edge of the abyss and look down, 

fearing the worst.  Then they smile in relief.

                        HANK (O.S.) 

            Well, don't just stand there --

REVERSE ANGLE - DOWNSHOT - HANK

Hanging from a rocky outcropping over the abyss.

                        HANK (CONT'D) 

           Get me outta here!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Diana extends her staff to Hank.  It glows as he pulls himself up 

hand over hand to stand beside them.  He picks up his bow and 

looks O.S.

                        HANK 

            Hey!  What's happening to Venger?

They all look O.S. and react as shimmering light begins to bleed 

INTO SHOT.

THEIR POV - VENGER

Still wrapped in the luminous spell.  It TRANSMOGRIFIES him, 

changing him into the noble, majestic figure whose likeness is 

carved on the sarcophagus.  He looks down at himself in disbelief.

When he speaks, his voice is that of Venger, but without the 

sinister reverb.

ON KIDS

Watching in awe.  Hank raises his bow in a gesture of triumph.

                            HANK 

                I was right!  Our mission in the 

                Realm was not to defeat Venger -- 

                it was to redeem him!

WIDE ANGLE - KIDS AND VENGER

As the new Venger approaches the kids.  Then, before them all, a 

burst of prismatic light appears and forms into Dungeon Master. 

He looks at Venger, and smiles.  Venger kneels before him.

                            VENGER 

                Father -- I have returned.

CLOSER - KIDS, DUNGEON MASTER, VENGER

Uni nuzzles Venger's hand as Dungeon Master, tears in his eyes, 

turns toward the kids.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 

                    (emotionally) 

                Thank you, my young pupils.  You 

                have done the one thing it was not 

                in my power to do -- you have 

                returned my son to me.

The kids look at each other in confusion.

                            ERIC 

                    (to Dungeon Master) 

               You're Venger's father?

                            PRESTO 

                There's not a big family 

                resemblance ...

ON VENGER

He smiles.

                            VENGER 

                Thousands of years ago, I chose to 

                follow another Master -- one of evil.

                                                              HANK

                     (understanding)

                The Nameless One.

                            VENGER

                I imprisoned in this cenotaph all that 

                which Dungeon Master had given me. 

                And now you have set me free.

ANGLE INCLUDES VAULT

Dungeon Master raises his hands, and a final bolt streaks from the

vault, IMPACTING near the kids and forming a portal.  Within it 

they can see the amusement park.

                            KIDS 

                    (gasps)

                            DUNGEON MASTER 

                And you have given those trapped in 

                this Realm their freedom.  I can do 

                no less for you.  You are free to 

                return to your world now, if you 

                wish.

ANGLE ON KIDS

They look at each other in disbelieving joy as Dungeon Master 

continues.

                           DUNGEON MASTER (O.S. CONT'D) 

                Or you may stay here, in the Realm. 

                There is still much evil to be dealt 

                with, and many adventures yet to be 

                had.

WIDE ANGLE

The kids and Uni stand in front of the portal, with Dungeon 

Master on one side and Venger on the other.

                        DUNGEON MASTER (CONT'D) 

                The choice, my children, is yours.

The kids look at each other, grinning, ready to make their 

greatest decision of all, as we PULL BACK, through the broken wall

of the cenotaph, BACK, rising over Realm's Edge, BACK STILL 

FURTHER, craning up above mountains, through clouds, until at last

we encompass an incredible vista:  the Realm itself, with its

myriad lands and lifeforms, its dangers and its joys; a new Realm

now, but still, and always: the Realm of Dungeons and Dragons.

                                                        FADE OUT
