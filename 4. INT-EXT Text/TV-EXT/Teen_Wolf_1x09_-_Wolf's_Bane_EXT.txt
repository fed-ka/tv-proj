      Feet landing on pavement, Derek runs for it. He charges down 
      one dimly lit alleyway, tearing around the corner as--


      TWO DEPUTY SHERIFF CARS blast out of the darkness into the 
      street. SIRENS BLARE as their tires rip up the pavement.


      Derek runs as fast as he can, pausing only to notice 
      HEADLIGHTS bursting out from around a corner. But this time 
      it s not a Deputy Sheriff s car--


      A pair of Deputies unleash their SEARCH DOGS sending them 
      darting into shadowy alleyways.

      Racing around the corner, the dogs charge toward a retreating 
      Derek. Until he stops and spins back, SNARLING with a mouth 
      full of fangs.

      The Deputies pause in their pursuit when the search dogs come 
      running back in terror, scurrying right past them as--


      Derek s Camaro bullets down the road with Kate still in 
      pursuit.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 109"   SALMON DRAFT1/20/114A.



      Having seemingly lost the cops, Derek backs his way into 
      another darkened alley. But when he turns--

      A BOLT FIRES THROUGH THE AIR.

      Derek raises his hand at the EXPLOSIVE FLASH. Too late. He 
      blinks rapidly, vision blurring. The FLARE blinds him, 
      sending him stumbling back, eyes blinking in pain.

      He peers up, seeing a blurred image of Argent, rapidly and 
      expertly reloading a crossbow with a new bolt.

      HE FIRES AGAIN.

      Derek dives out of the way, shutting his eyes to BLACKNESS as 
      he hears THE SECOND BOLT EXPLODE.

      He reaches out, clawing the air, looking for something to 
      grasp. But he crashes into a wall, moving about blindly as--

      A BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT blazes toward him, the sound of 
      SCREECHING TIRES behind it. The white light bisects into TWO 
      HEADLIGHTS. His own Camaro spinning toward him.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 109"   SALMON DRAFT1/20/116.

      The passenger door swings open, Scott and Stiles looking out.

                                  STILES
                    Get in!

      Derek pushes off the ground and hurtles forward. Tires spin 
      across the pavement, kicking up dust as--

      Argent rushes forward, crossbow at his side. Hearing SIRENS 
      and BARKING POLICE DOGS, he retreats into the shadows.


      Necklace in hand, Scott lands on the walkway just in front of 
      the door. He goes for his bike at the curb when--

                                  ARGENT
                    Scott?

      Getting out of his parked car just around the corner of the 
      house, Argent throws Scott a friendly smile.


      Allison races through the trails, running less for exercise 
      and more with purpose. She slows only when her destination is 
      finally revealed through the trees ahead--

      The Hale House.


      Dragging his lacrosse equipment with him, Scott hurries 
      toward the benches. He drops everything when his cell rings.
