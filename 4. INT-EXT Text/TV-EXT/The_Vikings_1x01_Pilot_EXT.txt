    Ragnar emerges from his house carrying the baby, wrapped in a 
    blanket. The storm has passed. The wood and turf building is 
  one of several in the small hamlet perched on the edge of a 
  deep fjord. It s a vision of stillness and utter 
    tranquillity. The thickly wooded slopes of the fyord drop 
  down sheer to the water, and above them the bare rocks are 
  still capped with snow. The whole landscape has a strange, 
    magical luminosity - a heightened, almost unnatural beauty. 

    Ragnar takes his son to the water s edge and holds him out in 
  his arms, like an offering.

                                RAGNAR
                  Look Odin. Look, I have a son. 
                  Thank you, lord. Thank you for my 
                  son.

  We move in CLOSE on the baby s face - then the camera tilts 
  up towards the sky.

  And suddenly the sky begins to darken...



    Darkness - and out of the darkness a noise like no other, of 
    horns and hooves and the shrill cry of birds and the roaring 
  of men and women. And over the dark fields, fringed with 
    fire, high in the darkling sky flies a tumultuous host: 
    thousands of Viking warriors and Valkyries packed together 
  and riding plunging horses, armed with spears and swords, and 
    half-naked shield-maidens with bows and shields, sweeping 
    across the heavens in a wild hunt amidst thick flocks of 
    wheeling ravens.

  And in the midst of this vast ghostly army the huge figure of 
    Odin, the god of dead warriors, lord of Valhalla, riding his 
    eight-legged horse Sleipnir, carrying his spear, two ravens 
    perched on his shoulders, his cloak streaming out behind him, 
  his single-eye surveying this great, ecstatic, thundering 
    host of the risen dead.                                                                                  5.





  Now everything is in the fierce grip of the deepest winter. 
  Icy winds blast across the fjord, heaping the water into 
    wild, foaming waves, and the mountains above are thick with 
  snow. Even at mid-day the sky is almost dark, like a 
    perpetual twilight.

  But through this dark desolation a solitary FIGURE can be 
  seen, a black smudge against the snow, wrapped in furs 
    against the icy winds, struggling towards the hamlet.



  They look up at the sky - even now, around noon, it s a 
    leaden grey, with no sign of the sun.

                                WANDERER
                  Watch.

  He holds up the sunstone. A beat. (The calcite works by 
    polarizing light).

  The sunstone glows faintly, and an equally faint beam seems 
  to bounce back from it and illuminate a spot in the sky, 
    behind the thick clouds.

                                WANDERER (CONT D)
                  You see? There is the sun.

  It seems like a miracle. Neither Ragnar nor Lagertha can 
    speak as they bear witness to it.



    Time has passed. Watched by her ten-year old daughter GYDA, 
    Lagertha draws water from the well. Despite her reputation as 
  a shield-maiden, Lagertha remains a slim, slight figure, with 
    long braided hair.

    It s still cold enough for her breath to steam, but the icy 
    blasts of winter are over and the landscape breathes and 
    greens.

  As she carries the bucket back towards the house we see 
    various animals in timbered pens, for this is a working farm. 
  And down by the water, a couple of small wooden boats.

  Two large and hairy hunting dogs shamble around the yard.

    Lagertha looks over at a neighboring property, where the 
    HOUSEHOLDER is leaving, riding a small, wiry horse up the 
    steep trail behind the houses.

    Glances back at her daughter.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Gyda, feed the goats.                                                                                  11.





    Father and son are ready to depart on their small, tough 
    horses, both wearing heavy woollen coats, tight leather 
    trousers, cloaks and leather boots.

    Lagertha and Gyda bring out some food for the journey, 
    putting it into their saddle-bags.

    Bjorn kisses Gyda.

                                BJORN
                  Goodbye, little sister.

                                GYDA
                  Goodbye, big brother. Don t get 
                  drunk.                                                                                  13.



                                LAGERTHA
                  Wait. I have something for both of 
                  you.

  She takes out two thin strips of colored ribbon, and ties one 
    around Bjorn s head and the other around her husband s.

                                LAGERTHA (CONT D)
                  There. Now everyone will know you 
                  are free men on your way to the 
                  Thing. 

    Ragnar kisses her.

                                RAGNAR
                  Goodbye my shield-maiden.

                                LAGERTHA
                  Look after your son - and when you 
                  come back, just tell me the truth. 
                I don t care about anything else.

  And then she and her daughter watch Ragnar and Bjorn set off 
  up the rough trail towards the trees, accompanied by one of 
  the hunting dogs, Ragnar armed with a spear, a sword and 
  knife and Bjorn with his hunting knife.

  Bjorn looks back once, and raises his arm in farewell, and 
  then they are swallowed up into the trees.



  They ride slowly on together through a landscape of forest, 
  scrub and rock. There is no-one else in sight, no farms or 
    dwellings, for the rocky earth here is clearly unfit for 
    agriculture or ploughing. Is even too barren for sheep.

  There are signs of spring everywhere, however, the trees a 
    brighter green, the gorse in flower.

                                BJORN
                  What will happen at the Thing?

                                RAGNAR
                  Earl Haraldson will deal, as usual, 
                  with some criminal offences that 
                  have happened since the last 
                  meeting. And then everyone will 
                  discuss the summer raids. 

                                BJORN
                  Where will you go?                                                                                  14.



    There s a long beat. Ragnar glances at his son, then away 
    again, with a shrug.

                                RAGNAR
                  It s not up to me. Earl Haraldson 
                  decides. I wish it was not so...but 
                  that is the law.

  But Bjorn can see that the question has affected his father s 
    mood.

    They splash through a stream.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                  All the ice has gone. Spring is 
                  here again, thanks to Frey.



    They have camped in the open. A fire is burning and they have 
    cooked some small animal over it and eaten it. The dog gnaws 
  at the bones.

                                BJORN
                  There s something I want to ask 
                  you.

                                RAGNAR
                  Then ask me.

                                BJORN
                  How did you meet mother?

    Ragnar s smiles.

                                RAGNAR
                  Hasn t she ever told you?

                                BJORN
                  Of course. But I want to know if 
                  your story is the same as hers. 

  A beat.

                                RAGNAR
                  Well, it occurred when a Swedish 
                  chieftan invaded our part of 
                  Norway. I went off to fight him and 
                  many of the local women dressed up 
                  in men s clothing and joined our 
                  camp. Lagertha was amongst them. 
                                (MORE)                                                                                  15.

                                RAGNAR (CONT'D)
                I was impressed by her courage and 
                  courted her from afar. 

                                BJORN
                  How far is that?

                                RAGNAR
                  Hush. Listen. After a while I went 
                to confess my love for her - but 
                  when I arrived I was set upon by a 
                  bear and an enormous hound who 
                  guarded her home. I killed the bear 
                  with my spear and managed to 
                  strangle the hound with my bare 
                  hands.
                        (beat)
                  And that s the way I gained her 
                  hand in marriage.
                        (glances at his son)
                  What did she tell you?

  Bjorn smiles, then lies down, pulls the blanket over himself.

                                RAGNAR (CONT D)
                  Did she tell you the same story?

  A long beat.

                                BJORN
                  Just about.

  And he closes his eyes, still smiling.



  They ride into Kattegat, a sizeable town and a trading 
    station, set on the bank of a river. It s a busy place with 
  open carts and covered wagons, horses and boats bringing 
    people and goods to the local market, as well as delegates to 
  the Thing, wearing ribbons around their foreheads.

  At the market place, TRADERS - several of them of Arabic 
    appearance, and dressed in totally different costumes - are 
    examining the pelts, furs, ropes and bear-skins for sale.

  The ARABS are also examining the handful of SLAVES for sale, 
    most of Slavic appearance, checking their teeth, hair and 
    nails, as if they were horses.

  There is a lot of good-humored banter and loud haggling.

  All of this Bjorn has clearly seen before, and is not fazed 
  by.                                                                                   16.


  But then a large group of YOUNG MEN, clearly drunk, come 
    swaggering through the market place, shouting out insults to 
  the traders and laughing, grabbing at the pelts and furs, 
    creating a disturbance.

  The traders reclaim their goods and drive them away, angrily. 
    Ragnar watches the incident with a heavy heart.

                                BJORN
                  Who are they?

                                RAGNAR
                  Young men with nothing better to 
                  do. These days they regard the old 
                  ways, of trading and farming, as 
                  too tame. They think it s stupid to 
                  acquire by sweat and toil what they 
                  can easily win by blood.

                                BJORN
                  Blood?

                                RAGNAR
                In battle.
                        (beat)
                  It s a real problem. There seem to 
                be more and more of them every 
                  year. And it s a great waste. Those 
                  young men are our future. Someone 
                  should harness their strength and 
                  their anger.

  They move on. 

  Then a great bear of a man steps out before their horses, 
    grabbing the bridles and laughing.

                                BEAR MAN
                  Ragnar Lothbrok!

    Ragnar and Bjorn dismount. Ragnar embraces him. 

                                BEAR MAN (CONT D)
                  Do my eyes deceive me? Is this your 
                  son? How he s grown!

                                RAGNAR
                  Bjorn, this is your uncle Rollo. We 
                  sail in the same boat.

                                BJORN
                  Uncle.

    Rollo looks him up and down.                                                                                  17.



                                ROLLO
                So you re here for the Thing? 
                  You re a real man now. Let s have a 
                  drink. 



  To jeers and shouts, Olaf Anwend runs the gauntlet of stones 
  and turf. He staggers down the line of people, women as well 
  as men, throwing the missiles at him.

  Bjorn watches with Ragnar, at first enjoying the comic 
    aspects of the scene - then wincing slightly as Olaf is 
    struck by stone after stone, staggers, and starts to bleed.

    Ragnar offers the boy a stone. Bjorn looks uncertain.

                                RAGNAR
                  You have to.

  A beat. Ragnar turns and throws the stone himself at Anwend, 
    hitting his leg. Anwend struggles on, everyone still enjoying 
  the comedic aspects. With a laugh Rollo throws a large rock 
  at Anwend, which hits his head and makes him cry out with 
  pain.

  Bjorn grabs a handful of turf and throws it, missing easily 
  and deliberately.

    Bleeding heavily, but alive, Anwend crawls the last few yards 
  to the end of the line, where with renewed hilarity a bucket 
  of cold water is poured over his bleeding head, and he 
    emerges - grinning like a madman. 

  Then Earl Haraldson and his entourage appear, the housecarls 
    bringing Eric Trygvasson to his execution. Trygvasson s 
    hands, unlike at the trial, are now unbound, and he walks 
    resolutely up to the wooden block on which he will be 
    decapitated.

  He smiles at the crowds gathered around him, and acknowledges 
  the dead man s family.

                                BJORN
                  Why is he smiling, father?

                                RAGNAR
                He wants to die well, of course, 
                  without fear. To atone for his 
                  sins.                                                                                  24.



  Bjorn looks puzzled.

                                ROLLO
                  Cattle die, kinsfolk die, we 
                  ourselves must die. But one thing I 
                  know will never die - a dead man s 
                  reputation. Remember that, young 
                  Bjorn.

    Trygvasson kneels on the grass and puts his head on the 
    stone. A HOUSECARL with an axe approaches, first lays the 
  blade of the axe flat on his head, then presents the blade 
  for him to kiss. Trygvasson kisses the blade eagerly, and 
    almost tenderly.

  Bjorn turns his head away.

                                RAGNAR
                  You must watch - for his sake. This 
                  is his only hope of reaching 
                  Valhalla.

    Bjorn forces himself to watch.

  The axe falls, striking off Trygvasson s head, which rolls 
    away into the grass.

    Earl Haraldson picks up the head and contemptuously tosses it 
  to the dead man s family.

                                EARL HARALDSON
                  Here. Feed it to your pigs. I curse 
                  him. May he never enter Valhalla. 

    Ragnar looks shocked. He s not the only one.

                                BJORN
                  Why did he do that?

                                RAGNAR
                I don t know. He should not have 
                  done. Not according to our law. He 
                  must have wanted that land himself.

  And he exchanges a meaningful glance with Rollo.



  The oars of a small boat slice cleanly into the waters of the 
    fyord. Bjorn stares down silently into the water, but the 
    reflections on its surface make it seem like the mountains 
  are in the water.                                                                                   25.


    Ragnar rows, keeping close to the shore, beneath the lee of 
  the overhanging cliffs and slopes of scree which fall sheer 
  to the fyord.

  Bjorn drops a smooth round pebble into the water and watches 
  it drop and drop, deeper and deeper into the clear depths.

  Bjorn watches his father row.

                                BJORN
                  Now where are we going, father?

                                RAGNAR
                To visit a friend.

                                BJORN
                A friend? What s his name?

                                RAGNAR
                  His name is Floki. 

  Bjorn stares at the high, snow-capped hills, the great, 
    almost overwhelming beauty of it.

                                BJORN
                  Like Loki, the god?

                                RAGNAR
                  Yes, like Loki. Only... different.

                                BJORN
                  How is he different?

                                RAGNAR
                  Well...
                        (thinks)
                  He s not a god.

    Bjorn laughs.

                                BJORN
                  Why didn t he come to the Thing?

  A long beat. Oars slice through the deep still waters. One 
    could well imagine that the gods were here, among these 
    unnaturally beautiful, silent places.

                                RAGNAR
                  Because he s...because he s shy.

                                                                          CUT TO:                                                                                  26.





    They ve pulled the boat onto a narrow beach in a hidden bay. 
    There s no sign of habitation.

  They walk up a steep path through the trees.

  When a FIGURE leaps out at them, wearing a fierce mask, and 
    with a hideous screech.

  Bjorn is shocked...but still calm enough to draw out his 
    hunting knife.

    Ragnar laughs.

                                RAGNAR
                  It s all right. Put your knife 
                  away.
                        (beat)
                  Floki, meet my son. Bjorn...this is 
                  my dear friend Floki.

    FLOKI rips off his mask, and grins. He has a strange, 
    mischievous, almost ageless face, ugly but animated, with 
    bright, piercing eyes.

                                FLOKI
                  Hello. How are you?

                                BJORN
                  Well, thank you...sir.

    Floki stares at his face.

                                FLOKI
                  Let me see. You have your father s 
                  eyes - unfortunately.

                                RAGNAR
                  Why unfortunately?

                                FLOKI
                  It means he will be like you. And 
                  therefore he will want to do better 
                  than you. And you will hate him for 
                  it.

                                RAGNAR
                  He s only twelve years old.                                                                                  27.



                                BJORN
                  How can you tell that by just 
                  looking at my face?

                                FLOKI
                  It s the same with trees.

                                BJORN
                  With trees?

                                FLOKI
                  Yes. I can tell which trees will 
                  make the best planks just by 
                  looking at them. I can look inside 
                  the tree. 

                                RAGNAR
                  Floki is a boat-builder.

  Bjorn stares around at the deeply-forested hill they are on.

                                BJORN
                So - you could tell which of these 
                  trees would make the best planks 
                  for a ship?

  Floki grins...then abruptly walks off the path, and into the 
    trees. They follow him.

  For their POV - and from ours - all the trees look the same, 
    virtually identical.

  But Floki stares at them with a strange, bewitching 
      intensity....touching the trunks of some of them, laying his 
  cheek against the bark, staring up at the uppermost branches. 

    Whatever amusement Bjorn might derive from seeing a man 
    staring at trees is quickly confounded by the aura of 
    spiritual intensity which surrounds Floki. He s no ordinary 
    mortal. It s not possible to laugh at the way he examines the 
  bark of tress, or caresses them, or simply just looks at 
  them.

  Floki is different. Strange but compelling. Authentic.

                                FLOKI
                        (suddenly)
                  This is one.

  He indicates a tree - to the others, just like the rest of 
  the trees...and yet. Floki strokes the trunk.                                                                                  28.



                                FLOKI (CONT D)
                  Inside this tree are two almost 
                  perfect planks. They will bend, 
                  then curve, like a woman s body, 
                  from the thigh to the back. When I 
                  split the tree I will find them.

  He marks the tree with a couple of blows from his axe.

  Bjorn laughs.

                                BJORN
                  You can see that?

                                FLOKI
                Do you think I m joking? I joke 
                  about many things, son of Ragnar, 
                  but never about ship-building. Our 
                  boats are our souls. 

  Bjorn looks abashed - embarrassed.

                                RAGNAR
                  So - how is our boat?

  Floki looks back at him. And grins.

                                FLOKI
                  Ah...

                                                                          CUT TO:



    Ragnar leads his sleepy son by the hand through the dark 
    settlement. Bjorn trips over something, yowls. Dogs bark.

                                BJORN
                  Where are we going now?

                                RAGNAR
                  Just to a place. Just to see 
                  someone.

                                BJORN
                  What place? To see who?
                        (beat)
                  I m so tired.

    Ragnar sees a lamp set outside a low door.

                                RAGNAR
                  Here it is. Wake up.

  He finds the door open, pushes his son inside, follows.



    Ragnar and Bjorn ride their small horses inland, up the side 
  of the mountain. It s a hard trek. The landscape is harsh and 
    dramatic with huge rock formations and boulders scattered 
    across it.

                                BJORN
                  This looks like a place where the 
                  giants might live.

    Ragnar smiles.

                                RAGNAR
                  You know very well that the giants 
                  dwell in Utgard, in the outer 
                  place. And between Midgard, where 
                  we live, and Utgard there is a 
                  great sea.

                                BJORN
                  Not our sea?

                                RAGNAR
                A bigger sea than that. And the 
                  Midgard serpent encircles it and 
                  holds the sea in.

                                BJORN
                  Don t the giants ever come here, 
                  into our world?

                                RAGNAR
                  They try to. They are 
                    shapeshifters. They can appear 
                  disguised as anything. But the gods 
                  look after us. 
                                (MORE)                                                                                  38.

                                RAGNAR (CONT'D)
                  They are forever watching out, in 
                  case the giants try to cross the 
                  sea and bring their chaos with 
                  them.

                                BJORN
                  And the dwarves help too?

                                RAGNAR
                  Yes, you can t always trust them of 
                  course - but they are a help to the 
                  gods sometimes. They bind Fenrir 
                  the wolf, so he can t escape and 
                  swallow the sun.

                                BJORN
                If Fennir is so big and strong, how 
                do they bind him...?

                                RAGNAR
                  With things you can t see or hear: 
                  like the breath of a fish; the 
                  sound a cat makes when it s 
                  walking, and the roots of a 
                  mountain.

    Bjorn nods, satisfied with the explanation. Takes it in. 

                                BJORN
                  I m hungry.

                                RAGNAR
                  Then we must catch something.



  They stand up to their knees in the cold flowing waters, both 
    with spears raised.

  They wait, and wait...and then both plunge their spears into 
  the water.

  Bjorn extracts a fish on the point of his spear, still 
    flapping. He grins.



    Lagertha is milking the goats in the milking shed. One of the 
    goat s is giving her trouble. She tries to coax it gently.

  Then Gyda comes rushing in, looking frightened.                                                                                  39.



                                GYDA
                  Mother.

  She glances over her shoulder. Lagertha understands that 
    something is wrong.

                                LAGERTHA
                      (to Gyda)
                  Stay here.

  She walks outside.



  Two YOUNG MEN - just like the young men who rain riot through 
  the town, are standing arrogantly in the yard. They are 
    armed.

                                LAGERTHA
                 What do you want?

                                FIRST YOUNG MAN
                  Where s your husband, woman?

                                LAGERTHA
                  He s at the Thing - where you 
                  should be. You re old enough.

                                SECOND YOUNG MAN
                  Don t taunt us, woman. We know 
                  you re alone here. All the men are 
                  gone.

                                LAGERTHA
                  If you re thirsty I will give you a 
                  drink. If you re hungry I will feed 
                  you. Otherwise you must go.

                                FIRST YOUNG MAN
                  We ll eat and drink after we ve 
                  satisfied our other needs. Let s go 
                  into your house.

  By way of a threat, he touches the axe head in his belt.

  A beat. Then Lagertha nods.

                                LAGERTHA
                  All right.
                        (looks over her shoulder)
                  Stay in the shed, Gyda. Do as I 
                  say.                                                                                  40.



  She leads the way into the house.



  They ride up, through the thinning line of trees, to the edge 
  of the plain.

  And stop.

  A majestic but also strange sight greets them. In the 
    distance is the golden dome of the temple. It s surrounded on 
  three sides by a grove of trees which are remarkable, even at 
  this distance, because there are very few other trees on this 
  high plateau.

  But dotted around there are some large earth mounds, clearly 
    man-made; burial mounds, but now covered in grass. And also 
  huge piles of stones. Bjorn knows what they are and doesn t 
  have to ask.

  The whole vista is strange, haunting.

                                RAGNAR
                  There it is.                                                                                  42.





  They ride towards the temple, between the trees. There s a 
    strange atmosphere here. Hidden bells chime very softly, 
    sweetly like a sighing wind.

                                RAGNAR
                  Keep to the path. The grove is 
                  sacred. Every nine years, here in 
                  the temple, the priests sacrifice 
                  nine of everything and hang them in 
                  the trees.

                                BJORN
                  Nine of everything? Nine sheep and 
                  nine hens?

                                RAGNAR
                  Yes.

                                BJORN
                  And nine horses?

                                RAGNAR
                Of course. We love our horses.

  A beat.

                                BJORN
                  And nine of us? Nine humans?

    Ragnar looks back at his son, but doesn t answer.

  Now Bjorn becomes aware of waif-like creatures flitting 
    between the trees, dressed in pale colored robes.

                                BJORN (CONT D)
                  Father, who are they?

                                RAGNAR
                  Priests, I expect. Or other things. 
                  Who can tell in a place like this? 
                  Look, here s the  entrance.



    They dismount in front of two large wooden doors, studded 
    with iron.

  A PRIEST appears, bows, silently opens the doors. He is a 
    tall, thin, homosexual YOUNG MAN, dressed in a flowing robe                                                                                  43.



  And they step inside.



  We are struck, again, by the immense, almost overwhelming 
    beauty of this place. A beauty that seems almost unreal. 

  A small boat is approaching, cutting through the calm waters, 
    dwarfed by the distant mountains.

  It reaches the naroow shingle beach and Rollo climbs out, and 
    fastens it to a post.

                                BJORN
                  Hello Rollo.

    Rollo ruffles the boy s hair.

                                ROLLO
                  Hello, young Bjorn.

                                ROLLO (CONT D)
                  Where are your parents?

    Bjorn is matter of fact.

                                BJORN
                  They re fucking.

    Rollo laughs.



    Ragnar finishes his piss. The landscape is bathed in 
    moonlight, which gives everything a mysterious look. Ragnar s 
    gaze is somehow drawn across to the edge of the woods...as a 
    wolf emerges.

  The wolf walks down the meadow a little way, completely 
    unafraid. Then stops, and seems to look back at Ragnar for a 
  few long moments.

  And then it turns, moves away among the shadows.



  We are in the fjord. Clouds scud across the sky. The 
    mountains soar into the blue air, and fall into the water 
    below.

  The water is full of reflections - of the sky, of the 
    forests.

  A waterfall cascades down the side of a mountain, foaming 
    over the rocks, sending up a fine mist of spray.

    This is nature, raw and elemental.

  We hear Lagertha s voice.

                                LAGERTHA V.O.
                A pyre was built around the body of 
                  Balder and his wife Nana, dry 
                  faggots that needed nothing more 
                  than a spark to leap into their own 
                  life and consume the lifeless 
                  bodies that lay upon them, 
                  releasing their bodies to travel 
                  on.                                                                                  54.





    Ragnar is out fishing with his son, Bjorn, in the deep 
    soundless waters of the fjord.

                                RAGNAR V.O.
                  Now Odin strode through the 
                  shallows and gripped the gunwale. 
                  He climbed into the boat and stood 
                  over the body of his dead son. For 
                  some time he gazed at him...

    Ragnar gazes at the very alive, very animated face of his 
    son. Then he speaks aloud:

                                RAGNAR
                  Then Odin bent down and put his 
                  mouth to Balder s ear. Again he 
                  gazed at his son; then he left the 
                  boat.

    Ragnar looks over at the shore, and points out something to 
  his son.

    Someone has kindled a fire on the far shore.

                                LAGERTHA V.O.
                  At a sign from Odin a servant 
                  stepped forward with a lighted 
                  brand. He set fire to the pyre and 
                  at once a steady plume of smoke, 
                  twisting and spiralling, rose into 
                  the calm air.

  And as father and son stare at the sight on the far shore, 
    this is exactly what they see.                                                                                   55.


  A boat has been set on fire - and the smoke, twisting and 
    spiralling, rises into the calm air.



    Father and son watch the boat, now completely alight, drift 
    slowly across the water. It s a fantastic, compelling image, 
  the fire reflected in the water so it seems to spread out 
  right across the fjord.

                                RAGNAR V.O.
                  The boat drifted across the water. 
                  Sea winds caught at her and tugged 
                  her away. First she was more boat 
                  than flame, but soon more flame 
                  than boat. She was a quivering 
                  shape, a farewell on the horizon, 
                  moving on under a great cloud of 
                  her own making.

  And so it is.

  And the boat burns on.



  The finished boat. It is a thing of such indescribable beauty 
  and latent power that Ragnar strokes the burnished planks 
    with his hands and lays his cheek against it, and shivers.

    Freshly oiled and painted. Sinuous, sleek, graceful the hull 
    rising shapely, like the contours of a body, like an organic, 
    living thing.

  And the prow standing proud, with its ornately carved dragon-
  head.

  Floki stares intently at Ragnar, watching his reactions.

    Ragnar looks at him.

                                RAGNAR
                  It s...

    Floki puts a finger over his mouth.

                                FLOKI
                  No need to say. I see it in your 
                  eyes.
                        (beat)
                  Let s put her on the water.                                                                                  57.





    Floki, his assistant, Ragnar and Rollo pull and heave the 
    finished boat, over wooden rollers, the short distance to the 
    water.

  The boat glides into the water and the men climb in.

    Threading oars through the oarports they row the boat out 
  into the deeper waters of the fyord, where a strong breeze 
    ripples the surface and sends the clouds scudding across the 
  sky.

  Floki is like a man possessed, grunting and groaning, 
    sighing, swearing at, then encouraging the boat, listening 
    intently to its creakings, watching for its listing.

    Ragnar ships his oar.

                                RAGNAR
                  Now the sail, Floki, the sail!

                                FLOKI
                  She ll sink. Oh, what have I done?

                                RAGNAR
                No she won t. She won t sink.

                                FLOKI
                I shouldn t have pretended to build 
                  such a boat. It s beyond my humble 
                  capabilities. I m a fool.

  He looks as if he s about to cry.

                                RAGNAR
                  I ll set the sail.

    Ragnar unfurls the large black sail. It falls. The others 
    fasten the ropes. Nothing happens for a moment. The sail 
    flaps rather uselessly.

                                FLOKI
                  I m sorry, Ragnar. I ve wasted all 
                  your money. It was all a joke.

                                RAGNAR
                  Shut up, man.

  A beat.                                                                                  58.



                                ROLLO
                  Look!

  A breeze catches the sail and it swells out proudly. The boat 
    starts to move. As it moves faster, the motion stabilizes, 
    becomes less choppy. It glides on smoothly, still picking up 
    speed.

  And now, suddenly, they re flying! The boat, still sitting 
  low in the water, cuts through it so easily that the frame 
    doesn t shudder on impact with the waves. It seems to ride 
  over the waves.

  And, after a while, there s an eruption of joy inside the 
  boat, the men shouting, and hugging, and Floki going mad, 
    laughing, leaping about, hugging them, trailing his hands in 
  the water.

                                FLOKI
                  Ha! What did I tell you? Now it 
                  runs on its cool keel. It s 
                  beautiful. Why didn t you believe 
                  me?

    Then, as they speed on, they calm down. Sober up. Look at the 
    shoreline racing past.

    Ragnar doesn t say anything. He doesn t need to, his 
    expression says it all. He can see the future now. He is 
    sitting on the edge of his dream.



  A HORSEMAN sits astride his horse, at the edge of the cliffs - 
  and watches the black-sailed ship carving through the waves.

  We have seen him before. He has a livid scar that joins his 
    mouth to his eye. He is one of Earl Haraldson s housecarls.

  He stares as the boat flies on.
