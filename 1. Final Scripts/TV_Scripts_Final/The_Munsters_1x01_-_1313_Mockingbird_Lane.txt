TEASER

EXT. SPOOKY FOREST - NIGHT

CAMERA DRIFTS OVER THE MOONLIT TREE TOPS to find the warm 
glow of a CAMP FIRE below where A SCOUT MASTER (40) addresses 
a DOZEN BOY SCOUTS (10-15) on a serious problem, as evidenced 
by the myriad crumpled food boxes and wrappers on display.

SCOUT MASTER
Would anybody like to say anything 
before we discuss community, 
responsibility and Scout honor?

CAMERA MOVES ALONG the Boy Scouts' faces until FINDING a 
thin, fastidious Scout named HUEY (11), who speaks up:

HUEY
We all know who it was.  Wallace's 
had a serious eating disorder since 
Webleos and you've all ignored it.

SCOUT MASTER
No one is ignoring anything, Huey.

HUEY
Well, someone gave him a merit 
badge in personal fitness.

There's an EH-HEM clearing of throat just outside the circle 
of Scouts from someone sitting on a log in the dark.

HUEY (CONT'D)
Oh.  I didn't see you there.

A heftier child named WALLACE (11) steps up, PUNCHES HUEY IN 
THE SHOULDER then returns to the dark log he was sitting on.

HUEY (CONT'D)
Ow.

SCOUT MASTER
Wallace.

HUEY
(undeterred)
I could hear whatever snack 
wrappers you have in your pockets 
crinkling when you hit me.



(CONTINUED)2.

CONTINUED:

Wallace stops moving, shooting Huey a tight-mouthed stare.

HUEY (CONT'D)
See.  He can't even deny it because 
his mouth is full.

Wallace slow chews, almost imperceptively so, nostrils 
flaring, as he tries to disguise what he's doing.  He 
swallows, then:

WALLACE
The crinkle is stay dry lining.  
Also, we're in the woods.  So maybe 
what got into the foods was a wild 
animal.  Like a baby bear.

Huey drops his bomb:

HUEY
I saw you hiding in the tall grass 
eating a box of Cap'n Crunch.

A few Scouts gasp, one we will call MARTIN turns to Wallace:

MARTIN
He called you out.

Another Scout who we will call BILLY interjects:

BILLY
That was my Cap'n Crunch.

WALLACE
Wasn't me.  I'm allergic to grass.

HUEY
First, we're surrounded by grass.  
So I guess your grass allergy makes 
you hungry.  Second...

Huey produces his iThing and shows everyone the covert 
picture of Wallace eating Capt'n Crunch in the tall grass.

HUEY (CONT'D)
Third, did you really think you 
could convince us there was some 
mysterious, wild, baby bear animal 
out there in the forest eating all 
our sugar cereals --

WOMPF!  A MYSTERIOUS WILD ANIMAL tackles Huey OUT OF FRAME. 
The Scouts SCATTER as they SCREAM IN HIGH-PITCHED TERROR.  




(CONTINUED)3.

CONTINUED: (2)

The Scout Master jumps to Huey's defense and the ANIMAL LEAPS 
ONTO HIS FACE AND CHEST, taking him down in one fell swoop.

Billy scrambles into his tent, zipping himself into his 
sleeping bag just as the ANIMAL slashes through the nylon 
wall and YANKS him outside.  CAMERA FOLLOWS Billy's sleeping 
bag dragged at high, galloping speeds through the forest.

Wallace leaps on a tree, climbing branch after branch up the 
trunk, earning every stitch of his personal fitness badge.  
But IT can climb faster, slashing and clawing at his heels.

A big, dramatic, iconic horror movie shot as shrieking SCOUTS 
dash along a hillside SILHOUETTED against the FULL MOON 
followed shortly thereafter by the ANIMAL in lunatic pursuit.

As chaos reigns in the forest, CAMERA DRIFTS TO THE MOON...

...WHICH BECOMES THE SUN.

CAMERA SNAPS BACK DOWN TO EARTH, SPECIFICALLY:

EXT. SPOOKY FOREST - MORNING

The camp site has been ravaged.  Tents are slashed.  The fire 
pit still smokes, but the fire wood was scattered.  There's a 
haze of early morning fog in the air.  A sleeping bag hangs 
high in a tree, unzipping itself REVEALING a terrified Billy 
still inside.  The Scout Master (scratched but not bitten) 
and other exhausted Scouts survived the evening crushed like 
sardines into the cab of the Scout Master's PICK-UP TRUCK.

CAMERA PULLS BACK from the Pick-Up Truck, across the forest 
floor and through some dense ground vegetation until A SWEET-
FACED BOY (10) sits up INTO FRAME as if from a deep sleep.  
He blinks and glances around, yawning and stretching, with 
absolutely no memory of the night before.  More blinks.

Meet EDDIE MUNSTER.

CUT TO BLACK.

ACT ONE

EXT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - DAY

A DECREPIT MANSION in the suburb of Mockingbird Heights.  

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the home is surrounded by 
BULLDOZERS AND HYDRAULIC EXCAVATORS (the modern descendant of 
the wrecking ball).  Beyond the perimeter of DEMOLITION 
EQUIPMENT and their HARD-HATTED HANDLERS, A CROWD OF 
NEIGHBORHOOD FOLK has gathered to watch 1313 go down.

The FRONT DOOR OPENS and a REAL ESTATE AGENT (40s) escorts a 
BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN named MARILYN (25) out of the house.

REAL ESTATE AGENT
You can see, it's a very emotional 
property for the neighborhood.  The 
previous owner was a notorious 
serial killer who poisoned hobos.

MARILYN
I'll take it.

REAL ESTATE AGENT
They're about to tear it down.

MARILYN
But they haven't yet.

REAL ESTATE AGENT
This is a horrible place.  Horrible 
things happened here.  They found 
dozens of graves in the back yard.

MARILYN
Mmm-hmm.

REAL ESTATE AGENT
Miss, there may be dead homeless 
people in the walls.

MARILYN
If we find any, I'll let you know.

SMASH CUT TO:

INT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - FOYER - DAY

The front door SLAMS OPEN REVEALING a FRANKENSTEIN-IAN SHAPE 
silhouetted by the MORNING SUN.  The silhouetted Frankenstein 
steps out of the shadow demonstrating he doesn't really look 
like Frankenstein.  



(CONTINUED)5.

CONTINUED:

A porch lamp gave him a square-headed, bolt-necked shadow.  
He is a handsome, gangly man appearing late 30s, stitched 
together from the corpses of many men.

MEET HERMAN MUNSTER.

Standing next to him is his son Eddie, wearing a Boy Scout 
uniform and a tight, weight-of-the-world expression, still 
slightly marred, scratched and bruised from his unexpected 
evening of Lycanthropy during the Boy Scout camp out.

EDDIE
This is very abrupt.

HERMAN
A happy confluence of events that 
happened to coincide with an 
unfortunate baby bear attack.

EDDIE
A lot of fuss over a baby bear 
attack I don't even remember.

HERMAN
Be glad you don't remember.  It 
ravaged you and tossed your naked 
body into the shrubs.  And that 
baby bear is still out there.

EDDIE
We didn't have to leave town.  It 
wasn't going to follow me home.

HERMAN
Not right away, but wait 29 days.

EDDIE
What happens in 29 days?

HERMAN
That's about how long it takes a 
baby bear to re-group.

Eddie's unsure dad knows of what he speaks, then laments:

EDDIE
I didn't say goodbye to anybody.

HERMAN
Moving away is a form of goodbye.





(CONTINUED)6.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE
Did Grandpa try to eat somebody 
again?  That why we had to leave?

HERMAN
No.  Not Grandpa.  Watch yourself.

Eddie pulls open a trap door in the floor, glancing down the 
opening of a spiral stone staircase.  He takes a coin out of 
his pocket and flicks it into the dark.  It TING-TING-TING-
TING-TINGS into the depths of the house as Eddie wonders:

EDDIE
If we see any dead hobos, I could 
earn a Fingerprinting merit badge 
and find their families.

TING-TING-TING, growing more and more distant.

HERMAN
Oh, honey.  They're hobos.  They 
don't have families.

The TING-TING-TING finally recedes into empty silence, then:

EDDIE
Grandpa said I had a condition.

HERMAN
He did?

EDDIE
He said it like he says it when he 
says Marilyn has a condition.  But 
he said my condition cleared up.  

HERMAN
I'm sure it's a different condition.  

EDDIE
I like being like Marilyn.

HERMAN
Don't say that in front of Grandpa.  
Say you like being like your dad.  
It'll be equally aggravating.  And you 
do get that condition from me.  

EDDIE
Which one of you?  

HERMAN
This one of me.  



(CONTINUED)7.

CONTINUED: (2)

He puts Eddie's hand on his chest affectionately.  Eddie 
smiles, then notices with curiosity not concern:

EDDIE
Your heart feels funny.

"Because its breaking," is what Herman wants to say but 
instead heaves a sigh, covering with a semi-cheerful smile.

HERMAN
That's how I know who I am when I'm 
made of so many different people.  

EXT. MOCKINGBIRD HEIGHTS - NIGHT

A lone DELIVERY TRUCK makes its way along a winding road.  
HEADLIGHTS wash over a sign that reads MOCKINGBIRD HEIGHTS.

INT. DELIVERY TRUCK - CARGO CONTAINER - NIGHT

TWO REFRIGERATOR-SIZED CRATES are strapped securely to the 
floor and walls of the cargo container.  CAMERA PUSHES IN TO 
AN EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF A CRATE TO REVEAL ICICLES FORMING.

INT. DELIVERY TRUCK - CAB - NIGHT

Two delivery men -- MR. GARCIA (driving) and MR. PEREZ 
(passenger) -- stare at the road, a tension between them.  
Mr. Perez exhales and his breath fogs in the cold air.  He 
reaches for the a/c controls to adjust the temperature. Both 
Mr. Garcia and Mr. Perez speak only in Spanish:

MR. GARCIA

MR. GARCIA

Mr. Perez rolls down the window and feels the outside air.




(CONTINUED)8.

CONTINUED:

MR. PEREZ (CONT D)
Warmer outside then it is in here.

There s a sudden, jolty, draggy, THUMP-KRRRRR from the back.  
Mr. Perez and Mr. Garcia exchanged a concerned glance.

CUT TO:

BLACK.  TWO DOORS OPEN TO REVEAL WE ARE --

INT. DELIVERY TRUCK - CARGO/EXT. MOCKINGBIRD HEIGHTS - NIGHT

The Delivery Truck has pulled over to the side of the road.  

Mr. Perez and Mr. Garcia open the cargo container doors and 
flick a switch.  A dim bulb provides barely enough light, but 
enough to see patches of icy frost on the two wooden crates.  
Mr. Garcia feels the crate with his bare hand, jumping at how 
sharp the cold is against his palm.

MR. PEREZ
 ice cream.Maybe it s

MR. GARCIA
 not ice cream.It s

Mr. Garcia turns to see, standing in the road about twenty 
feet from the back of the delivery truck, A LARGE BLACK WOLF.  
He nudges Mr. Perez and by the time he turns to look, there 
are FIVE LARGE BLACK WOLVES standing in the road behind them.

Both gentlemen grab a crow bar and calmly climb out of the 
back of the truck, closing and locking the doors.  The FIVE 
LARGE BLACK WOLVES watch inscrutably silent.  Then they all 
take a calculated step forward, herding Mr. Garcia and Mr. 
Perez back to the cab of the truck.  As they scramble into:

INT. DELIVERY TRUCK - CAB - NIGHT

Mr. Garcia and Mr. Perez quickly climb inside, slamming their 
doors behind them.  They can see the FIVE LARGE BLACK WOLVES 
in their rear view mirrors.  Mr. Garcia starts the engine.

EXT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - NIGHT

The Delivery Truck pushes its way through the DRIVEWAY GATES 
and backs up to LARGE CELLAR DOORS.  Brake lights brighten 
and Mr. Garcia and Mr. Perez hop out of the truck.  The 
headlights of the Delivery Truck shine across the expansive 
backyard, illuminating dozens of open graves.  

MR. GARCIA
I want those things off my truck.



(CONTINUED)9.

CONTINUED:

Mr. Garcia and Mr. Perez open the back doors of the Delivery 
Truck and push the first crate onto the loading platform and 
unload it, quickly moving the second one into position.  Mr. 
 a faint Perez leans closer, listening intently.  There s
SCRITCHY-SCRATCHY scurrying sort of noise coming from inside.  

MR. PEREZ
 moving in there.Something s

Mr. Garcia listens, too.  

It sounds as if something big is shifting.  They try to 
steady the crate, but it TOPPLES from the platform, landing 
hard enough to SPLINTER THE CORNER.  A rich, earthy soil 
spills... followed by 100 RATS THAT TEEM OUT OF THE CRACKED 
CRATE.  As the RATS FLOOD THE GROUND IN A HAIRY STREAM...

...Mr. Garcia has already thrown the truck into gear.  Mr. 
Perez runs along side of the moving Delivery Truck before 
pulling himself up and into the cab.

As the terrified Delivery Men flee, THE RATS CLIMB ONTO EACH 
OTHER S BACKS AND ASSEMBLE INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY OLD MAN with a 
rosy twinkle in his milky eyes.  MEET GRANDPA (580).  

He stands there a moment, naked and sagging before Marilyn 
finally approaches with a luxurious red silk robe.  She 
 shoulders as HERMAN ENTERS.drapes the robe over Grandpa s

MARILYN

A LIGHT MIST seeps out of the cracks in the other crate, 
collecting into a CLOUD that APPARATES into a STILL SMOKY 
PRETERNATURALLY BEAUTIFUL, PALE WOMAN.  MEET LILY MUNSTER. 

The moment the SMOKY CLOUD coalesces into Lily's naked form, 
HUNDREDS OF SPIDERS descend from above, cascading over the 
 body, weaving a beautiful dress from Munster matriarch s
their silk.  Herman takes in his striking beauty with:

HERMAN
Hello, Lily.10.


EXT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

Grandpa, in his luxurious red silk robe, glides toward the 
gates, peering out at the neighborhood, Marilyn by his side.

GRANDPA
I preferred it when the village was 
further away.  And we had a moat.

MARILYN
Best moats are made of good manners 
and filled with congeniality.

Grandpa gives Marilyn an annoyed, side-long glance, then:

GRANDPA
I'll make cookies.

A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:

A TRAY OF DELICIOUS FROSTED BUTTER COOKIES.  

GRANDPA'S WITHERED PALE CREPE-PAPER SKIN COVERED FINGER.

A SPONTANEOUS CUT SLICES ACROSS HIS FINGERPRINT.

ON THE TRAY OF DELICIOUS BUTTER COOKIES AS...

PLIP-PLIP-PLIP, a SINGLE DROP OF GRANDPA'S BLOOD lands on 
each cookie, BLOSSOMING INTO A DECORATIVE CRIMSON HEART.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE:

EXT. MOCKINGBIRD LANE - NIGHT

Marilyn (holding the tray of cookies) strolls arm-in-arm with 
Grandpa (dressed as an adorable older gentlemen, fedora, and 
the such), who glides along a neighbor s walkway, HIS SHADOW 
already stretching across the lawn and ringing the doorbell.  

GRANDPA
Look at these homes.  Each an 
impenetrable stronghold to a 
vampire without invitation.

The door OPENS as Grandpa and Marilyn climb the stairs to the 
porch.  NEIGHBOR TIM (50s) stands to greet them.

MARILYN
 Marilyn Munster.  This Hello, I m
is my grandpa, Grandpa. 




(CONTINUED)11.

GRANDPA
You can also call me Grandpa.

We just moved in across the street.

Neighbor Tim smiles and opens the door a little wider.

NEIGHBOR TIM
Welcome to the hood.  I'm Tim.

GRANDPA
Just a second, Tim.

 face, Grandpa waves his hand in front of Neighbor Tim s
putting him in a DEEP TRANCE, his eyelids dropping to half-
mast as he more or less stops moving exactly where he is.  
Grandpa turns to Marilyn, reading her like a book:

Were you planning on staying?

MARILYN
I was hoping on staying.  Were you 
planning on me not staying?

GRANDPA
Yes.  I was going to miss you when 
you were gone, but I would also be 
quite pleased you weren't here.

MARILYN
I'm touched that you'd miss me, but 
I didn't like that other part.

GRANDPA
Aren't you in higher learning on 
the other side of the country?

MARILYN
I transferred my class credits.

GRANDPA
They don't have campus housing?

MARILYN
It's a community college.

GRANDPA
I adore you, Marilyn.  I'm the one 
who talked your mother out of 
eating you, but you can't stay.



(CONTINUED)12.

CONTINUED: (2)

MARILYN
Why not?

GRANDPA
I'm going to start eating people.

MARILYN
I've seen you eat people before.

DARKNESS.  CLICK as 10 YEAR OLD MARILYN turns on the light to 
catch a TERRIFYING bloody-mawed GRANDPA feeding on a BURGLAR.  

GRANDPA
Go back to bed.

10 Year Old Marilyn shuts off the light with a bookend CLICK 
before she turns heel and does as instructed.

SMASH BACK TO:

EXT. MOCKINGBIRD LANE - NEIGHBOR TIM'S PORCH - NIGHT

Grandpa and Marilyn, as before, with DEEP TRANCE Tim.

GRANDPA
I haven't had a sip for the better 
part of a decade as to not terrify 
the boy.  But now that Eddie is in 
the family way, not eating people 
might send the wrong message.

MARILYN
Like eating people is bad?

GRANDPA
As one example.

MARILYN
Eating people is bad.

GRANDPA
Precisely why you shouldn't stay.  
Nobody wants to eat anybody with 
that standing over their shoulder.

Before Marilyn can continue to pursue that, Grandpa waves his 
hand over Neighbor Tim s face, lifting him out of the trance.




(CONTINUED)13.

CONTINUED:

GRANDPA (CONT D)
May I say you have a stunning home.

NEIGHBOR TIM
Would you like to come in?

GRANDPA
Can you re-phrase that as a 
statement?

NEIGHBOR TIM
Please come in...?

GRANDPA
Don't mind if I do.

Neighbor Tim opens the door wider, allowing first Marilyn and 
then a gliding Grandpa to ENTER.  OFF the DOOR CLOSING...

A FOGGY CLOUD

It roils and shifts like a time-lapse storm front.  We are -

INT. 1313 - LILY & HERMAN S BEDROOM - MORNING

The FOGGY CLOUD starts to COALESCE, REVEALING a NAKED HERMAN 
lying in bed on top of rumpled sheets.  He's sexy despite or 
 quality of his body,  quilt perhaps because of the  athletic
assembled from the corpses of great men.  He heaves a long, 
post-coital sigh and exhales a puff of cloud mist that is 
part of his wife Lily - who is coalescing into her now 
identifiable self, floating above Herman.

Herman runs his finger down Lily's chest along her stomach, 
leaving a vapor trail in its wake.  A quiet moment, then:

LILY
I wonder if this would have 
happened sooner if I breast fed.

HERMAN
I have to assume you're talking 
about Eddie.  

LILY
Evidently it's important.

HERMAN

baby drinking blood and you were so 
nervous about holding him after 
what your sister did to Marilyn.




(CONTINUED)14.

CONTINUED:

LILY
That was postpartum.

HERMAN
Mmm-hmm.

Lily drifts down from the ceiling, laying next to Herman.

LILY
Mothers who breast feed are closer 
 a fact.  A to their babies.  It s
 suckling baby changes the mother s
brain and makes them love harder.

HERMAN

LILY
I could have if I breast fed.  He 
was just so pink and chubby.

HERMAN
We have to stop thinking of him as 
fragile and or edible.  
(then)
He's asking questions.

LILY
I don't want him to know.

HERMAN
He's going to find out.

LILY
We have at least two more baby bear 
attacks before he gets suspicious.

HERMAN
He needs someone to talk to.  The 
only other werewolf Eddie knows is 
your brother and he's a sad sack of 
hair and teeth and self-loathing.

LILY
Eddie can talk to Grandpa.

HERMAN
Grandpa hand stitched your brother's 
sad sack of self-loathing.  

A personal issue for Herman.  Lily proceeds with caution.




(CONTINUED)15.

CONTINUED: (2)

LILY
Eddie is taking after Grandpa.

QUICK POP:

HERMAN'S HEART

Stapled, stitched and steam-punked together with various 
valves and bolts -- but PUMPING.  PLINK.  A staple pops.

BACK TO:

HERMAN

His face tightens, but he doesn't say a word.

 VOICEA WOMAN S
(pre-lap)
I'm so sorry for your loss.

INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

A haunted, distracted Herman is wearing a tasteful black suit 
and tie to honor the deceased as he hosts a MEMORIAL SERVICE 
as part of his job at the Funeral Home.  He s approached by a 
MOURNING WOMAN named MELANIE (50s).

HERMAN
I'm not mourning.  I work here.  

MELANIE
You look very snappy in the 
uniform.  Have you worked in the 
funeral services industry long?

HERMAN
Centuries --

MELANIE
(cutting him off)
Damn it.  You're married.

She turns the band of Herman's wedding ring around and 
partially unscrews his entire finger, nail-side down.

HERMAN
(screws it back in)
Double jointed.

MELANIE
How did you meet your wife?




(CONTINUED)16.

CONTINUED:

HERMAN
It was arranged.  I was arranged.  
The parts of me.  By her father.
(changing the subject)
How do you know the deceased?

MELANIE
I don t know them.  Or any of these 
people except some of the regulars.  

She nods to an ELDERLY MAN, who nods back.

MELANIE (CONT D)
You offer a wonderful soup bar.

She indicates the SOUP BAR dispensing hearty flavors from 
decorative pots through spigot taps.

HERMAN
You come here for soup?

MELANIE
 providing a service.  Nothing I m
sadder than a poorly attended funeral.  
So I dress appropriately, behave 
respectfully and enjoy the soup.  

She takes sip of soup and glances at the occupied coffin.

MELANIE (CONT D)
I heard somebody saying something 
about him being a dancer.

HERMAN
They're a whole family of dancers.

MELANIE
Whole family of anything is weird.  
They didn't all want to be dancers.  
You can't love your children based 
on how much of you you see in them.

It strikes a chord and we HEAR a MUFFLED PLINK from inside 
Herman's chest.  He exhales a sad little "uhhf" sound.

MELANIE (CONT D)
(hopeful)
Was that disgust?

HERMAN
No.  That was despair.




(CONTINUED)17.

CONTINUED: (2)

Herman seems to mull that over as he eyes the DEAD MAN'S LEGS 
flaunted in the open casket, then:

HERMAN (CONT D)
I wonder how good a dancer he was.

CLOSE ON - THREADED NEEDLE - WOUND P.O.V.

CAMERA LOOKS UP THE LENGTH OF THE NEEDLE at Herman, who 
concentrates as he STITCHES TWO FLAPS OF SKIN TOGETHER 
(CLOSING OVER THE FRAME as Herman sews).  We are --

INT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

Herman sits on the table next to an OPEN COFFIN.  The DEAD 
MAN inside has no legs below the knees (cuffs neatly rolled) 
because Herman is currently STITCHING them onto his own body.

CUT TO BLACK.


END OF ACT ONE18.


ACT TWO

EXT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - ROOF - EVENING

A STORM FRONT rolls in, unfurling over Mockingbird Heights.  
Eddie climbs up onto the roof and walks along its highest 
pitch to the chimney, where he affixes a LIGHTNING ROD.

EDDIE
(calling down)
Ready!

Almost in direct response to Eddie's call, the dramatic STORM 
FRONT RUMBLES as air molecules split in anticipation of...

CRRRZZZAK!

A BOLT OF ELECTRICITY summoned from the cloud strikes the 
LIGHTNING ROD and briefly dances across it in an arc.

CAMERA LAUNCHES INTO THE CHIMNEY following the LIGHTNING ARC 
down the metal conducting rod into the darkness.

CAMERA EMERGES from the darkness and HERMAN'S OPEN CHEST 
CAVITY as the ELECTRICITY ARCS across a series of wires and 
alligator clips into a CUMBERSOME FIST-SIZED STEAM-PUNK 
BATTERY PUMP sitting where his heart should be.  

Herman abruptly sits up INTO FRAME REVEALING we are --

 DUNGEON LAB - DAYINT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - GRANDPA S

Grandpa has Herman on the slab with his chest open.  His  
stitched and stapled heart rests beating on a metal pan.  A 
brief moment as Herman gets his bearings, then:

HERMAN
Shame on you for shoddy 
craftsmanship.

GRANDPA
You broke your own heart.  Shame on 
you for being so sentimental.  

HERMAN
It's my heart.  It's sentimental by 
definition.

Grandpa unceremoniously tips the metal pan, sliding Herman s 
heart into a trash pail.  Herman fishes it right back out.

HERMAN (CONT D)
That's my last original part.



(CONTINUED)19.

CONTINUED:

GRANDPA
Ruined.  All your fretting about 
Eddie has taken its toll.  

HERMAN
I'm not worried about Eddie.  He's 
going to be just fine.

As the words leave his mouth, Herman knows they feel odd.

GRANDPA
He is but he's not going to be fine 
how you think he's going to be fine 
which you won't be fine with.

HERMAN
(re: battery pump)
Take it out.  I don't like how it 
feels.  Doesn't feel like me.  I'm 
incapacitated with worry, this isn't. 
(re: his heart)
Put that back in.  Take this out.  
Put that back in.  Clean it first.

Grandpa sets about cleaning Herman's steam-punk heart using 
various steams, soaps and scrubs.

GRANDPA
You're too attached to how things 
were.  Only were now is were-wolf.
Can't be a Munster and a Boy Scout.  

HERMAN
If Eddie wants to be a Boy Scout, 
that's what Eddie's going to be.

GRANDPA
First rule of Scout Law is "help 
others at all times."  That's going 
to be difficult for Eddie when he's 
blacking out and waking up naked.

HERMAN
I know what's best for Eddie.

GRANDPA
Really?  Have you raised a werewolf 
before?  Cause I have.

HERMAN
Have you raised one successfully?




(CONTINUED)20.

CONTINUED: (2)

Grandpa stares at Herman than slaps his weathered steam-punk 
heart back into the cavity of his chest.  Much better.

GRANDPA
Tell Eddie there is no Baby Bear.

To punctuate that point, Grandpa staples -- K'CHUN-K'CHUN-
K'CHUN-K'CHUNK -- Herman's CHEST PLATE over his heart.

HERMAN
I'm going to need a stronger heart.

GRANDPA
Perhaps you should ask Lily to 
bring one home from work.

POP TO:

INT. PET STORE - EVENING

CAMERA PUSHES DOWN an aisle of PET KENNELS like a shot out of 
a BUSBY BERKELEY NUMBER as one after another in choreographed 
succession, a LINE OF DOGS delivers garbage bags to a bin.  

CAMERA FINDS LILY behind the counter wearing an employee

Are they cleaning their own cages?

LILY
Yes.

BACK TO:

EXT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - BACKYARD - DUSK

Herman leans on his shovel surrounded by open graves.  He's 
speaking to someone not visually present, presumably Grandpa.  

HERMAN
If I can't have my own heart, I 
need one that beats to the same 
drum of fidelity and domesticity.

A TEAM OF RATS crawls up and out of the soil and into the 
CRUMPLED CLOTHES lying on the ground, simultaneously dressing 
themselves as they assemble into GRANDPA.

GRANDPA
There's a whole bunch under there.  
Think it might be a swimming pool.




(CONTINUED)21.

CONTINUED:

HERMAN
We have a swimming pool?

Herman flips a switch on a vine-covered pedestal.  There's a 
HUM and WHIR as the GROUND OPENS UP.  An AUTOMATIC POOL COVER 
buried under a foot of lawn RETRACTS REVEALING inside the 
drained pool are dozens of DEAD HOBOS packed like sardines.

Grandpa begins plucking hearts out of the chests of the top 
layer of DEAD HOBOS like turnips out of the ground.

GRANDPA
Too fatty.  Too small.  Thin walls.

HERMAN
I don't want some vagabond's hooch-
addled sump pump.  Hobos are hobos 
for a reason.  They are free 
spirits with fleeting connections.  

GRANDPA
Now you're adverse to hobo parts?

HERMAN
I need a heart predispositioned to 
feel how I feel about Eddie and 
Lily.  To a lesser extent Marilyn.  
And to a much lesser extent you.

Grandpa tosses that last heart over his shoulder and shakes 
the muck from his hand before throwing down the following:

GRANDPA
I'll get your heart for you.  Like 
you ordered it out of a catalog.  
And the moment it is beating in your 
chest you will tell Eddie you are 
the proud father of a werewolf.

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. BAY - NIGHT

CAMERA GLIDES across the surface of the water to REVEAL:

EXT. BRIDGE - UNDERBELLY - NIGHT

Marilyn and Lily are perched on one of the massive supporting 
pylons under the bridge, taking in the night.

LILY
Gotten so used to drinking alone.  




(CONTINUED)22.

CONTINUED:

MARILYN
I brought hot cocoa. 

LILY
Drinking isn't a pretty time for 
me.  I don't want to scar you any 
more than my sister already has.  

MARILYN
Grandpa's going to start eating 
people and I need to get used to it 
so he'll stop packing up my room.

LILY
Your mother's post-partem craving for 
baby meat was... embarrassing for 
Grandpa.  I know it had a profound 
effect on my relationship with Eddie.

MARILYN
It was embarrassing for me, too.  Came 
out one end went back in the other.

LILY
I was so ashamed of what she tried 
to do.  And when Eddie was born, I 
was so ashamed of what I might do...   

MARILYN
You developed an eating disorder.

LILY
It clearly affected my self-esteem.  
Look at me.  I'm lurking under 
bridges like a common troll.

There's a THWUSH and a FLAPPING of loose clothing as a 
SUICIDE plummets past them, followed by a distant SPLASH.

LILY (CONT D)
I'll get the next one.

MARILYN
I'm sure Eddie would appreciate how 
wasteful suicide is and how you're 
trying to give it a small purpose.

She is uncomfortable with the words as they leave her mouth.

LILY
Eddie is not going to appreciate 
his mother eating anybody.




(CONTINUED)23.

CONTINUED: (2)

MARILYN
He just has to make it the same in 
his mind as a coyote eating a 
squirrel who doesn't want to live.

LILY
Eddie is his mother's son and I 
can't even be proud.  The more I 
see of myself in him, the more I 
know he's going to hate me for it.

She s interrupted by the SCREAM! of a SUICIDE leaping to his 
death off the bridge above.  Startlingly before Marilyn's 
very eyes LILY'S BEAUTY SUDDENLY TRANSFORMS INTO SOMETHING 
WITH A LARGE FANG-RIDDLED MOUTH.  She leaps off the support 
pylon with lightning-like reflexes, snatching the suicide in 
her maw and riding him toward the water until they disappear 
in the dense fog.  Marilyn takes a sip from her thermos. 

SMASH CUT TO:

SCOUT MASTER STEVE

Healthy, handsome, confident, athletic, warm, and friendly.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Know what I love about Scouting?
(wait for it)
Everything.  We get to be nice to 
people all day.  It's our job.  
Being pleasant is our super power. 

CAMERA REVEALS we are --

INT. BOYS & GIRLS CLUB - RECREATION CENTER - NIGHT

Eddie listens, rapt, as Scout Master Steve weaves a web of 
charm and enthusiasm.  Herman smiles over one shoulder, happy 
his son is happy.  Grandpa scowls over the other shoulder.  A 
DOZEN AND A HALF BOYS (10-17) mill about in the background.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
And a Scout uniform is our super 
hero costume.  That neckerchief is 
a cape.  Those merit badges are the 
armor of experience and adventure.

EDDIE
How many merit badges do you have?

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
All of them.

(MORE)


(CONTINUED)24.

CONTINUED:
SCOUT MASTER STEVE (CONT'D)
Do you like camping, Eddie?  Annual 
Scout Jamboree is almost upon us.

Eddie opens his mouth to answer and Herman quickly chimes in, 
keeping rhythm with his tapping feet.  CLICKITY-CLICK.

HERMAN
The last time Eddie went camping 
there was a baby bear attack.

GRANDPA
Allegedly.

EDDIE
I don't remember the baby bear.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Troop One One Zero?

Eddie nods.  CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLICKITY-CLACK.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE (CONT D)
Eddie, why don't you lead the rest 
of the troop in the Scout Oath?

Scout Master Steve ushers Eddie toward the rest of the 
Scouts.  Once he's out of ear-shot:

SCOUT MASTER STEVE (CONT D)
My heart feels for the little guy.

GRANDPA
It does?  Would you say that's a 
healthy heart?  Athletic?  No 
family history of disease?

HERMAN
Grandpa.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
It's a big heart, can tell you that 
much.  With a lot of love to give.  

In the background, Eddie leads his fellow scouts in the Oath:

EDDIE AND THE SCOUTS
(in jagged unison)
On my honor, I will do my best to 
do my duty to God and my country; 
To obey the Scout Law; To help 
other people at all times; To keep 
myself physically strong...




(CONTINUED)25.

CONTINUED: (2)

Scout Master Steve smiles proudly at the well-behaved Scouts.

HERMAN
Which one is yours?

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
None of them.  My wife was barren.  
Ever since she died, these boys 
have become my whole life.

HERMAN
You're a widower?

GRANDPA
That's so sad.  Bet that big heart 
of yours misses her very much.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Every day.  

GRANDPA
Must be hard to go on after 
something like that.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
(cheerful)
Way I figure, I'm still here so 
there must be a reason for it.

Grandpa slowly and pointedly looks at Herman.

CUT TO BLACK.


END OF ACT TWO26.


ACT THREE

EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - EARLY MORNING

Beautiful.  Still.  A DEER ENTERS FRAME quietly and 
cautiously sniffing at the grass before taking a bite.

The wonder of nature.  CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL we are --

INT. DUCK BLIND - REDWOOD FOREST - EARLY MORNING

Marilyn, Grandpa and Eddie sit in a camouflaged hut, watching 
the deer feed on the tall grass.  They speak in hushed tones:

MARILYN
The deer eats the plants and 
someday, when the deer dies, he'll 
fertilize the ground so more grass 
will grow so more deer can eat.

EDDIE
That's considerate.

MARILYN
It's the circle of life.

GRANDPA
There's an important intermediary 
step we're forgetting.  The deer 
eats the plants and then is itself 
eaten and the thing that ate it 
dies and it fertilizes the ground 
so more grass will grow so more 
deer can eat.  And then be eaten.

MARILYN
But some deer can live long lives.

To dispute that fact, A MOUNTAIN LION launches out of the 
shrubs and devours the Deer eating grass.  Eddie's eyes widen 
in terror, but Marilyn places a hand on his shoulder:

MARILYN (CONT D)
Circle of life.

GRANDPA
That's nature.  

MARILYN
Mountain lions are so tidy.

GRANDPA
Hard to fault a tidy predator.



(CONTINUED)27.

CONTINUED:

MARILYN
(to Eddie)
Also as an intermediary step, 
sometimes deer want to be eaten.  
They're depressed and lonely.  So 
that lion's doing the deer a favor.

EDDIE
That deer didn't look depressed.

Marilyn can't bring herself to argue her point.

MARILYN
I know.  I thought I saw it smile.

EDDIE
Does anything eat the lion?

A giant, terrifying WOLF LEAPS ATOP THE LION, digging in.

MARILYN
Grandpa.

Eddie realizes Grandpa is no longer sitting next to him.  The 
WOLF, now transformed into naked, bloody-mouthed Grandpa, 
looks up and smiles sweetly over the partially devoured lion.

GRANDPA
It's nature.

OFF Eddie's slack jawed horror...

CUT TO:

A DRESSER CHEST

A drawer slides open REVEALING EDDIE tucked inside.  We are --

INT. MOCKINGBIRD LANE - HERMAN & LILY'S ROOM - DAY

Lily sits on her bed and waits for Eddie to climb out of the 
dresser drawer.  He crawls onto the bed next to his mother 
and buries his face in her shoulder.

EDDIE
I think something's wrong with 
Grandpa.  He took off all of his 
clothes and then he ate a lion.

LILY
You weren't at the zoo, were you?




(CONTINUED)28.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE
The forest.  Grandpa and Marilyn 
were teaching me about the Circle 
of Life and suicidal deer.

LILY
Circle of Life is a violent shape.

EDDIE 
It is when Grandpa's drawing it.  

LILY
Your Grandpa's just trying to help 
you understand there's an order to 
life so you don't... hate the baby 
bears when they attack.

EDDIE
I don't hate that baby bear.  It 
was probably hungry and confused.  

LILY
That's exactly right.  That baby 
bear was so confused it couldn't 
possibly know what it was doing.

EDDIE
It's not like it wandered into a 
populated area.  Which reminds me.  
If Grandpa's going to start eating 
people again, don't you think we 
should warn the neighbors?

Lily stares, blinks, then:

LILY
What makes you think Grandpa is 
going to start eating people?

EDDIE
What makes you think he's not?

LILY
Because he's your grandfather.
(off his look)
Marilyn told you.

EDDIE
No.  Grandpa told me when he ate a 
lion.  I think he wanted me to see 
him eat that lion so I could get 
used to him eating something big.




(CONTINUED)29.

CONTINUED: (2)

LILY
The thing Grandpa wants you to see 
about the Circle of Life is, as a 
Munster, he's standing outside of it.

It takes a moment, but Eddie wraps his head around it.

EDDIE
As a Munster? 

LILY
Well, as a Munster, our duty in 
nature is to eat.  Not be eaten. 

EDDIE
Unless you have a condition.  Like 
Marilyn.  Like me.

LILY
Unless you have a condition.  

EDDIE
You wouldn't ever eat somebody, 
would you, mom?

Lily scoffs and dismisses with near expert-avoidance.

LILY 
There's a difference between being 
a Munster and being a monster.

EDDIE
Would you?

Her long silence is an admission and young Eddie knows it.

LILY
It would be natural, if I did.

Eddie stiffens, moving almost imperceptibly away from his 
mother.  Almost.  He takes this in a sad, somber moment.  

EDDIE
I'm so glad I'm not like you.

OFF that penetrating Lily like a wooden stake...

EXT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - DAY

Grandpa sits in a lawn chair beneath a parasol, glass of 
lemonade, a fresh batch of heart cookies beside him.  
Neighbor Tim stands on a ladder leaning against the house, 
sweating furiously as he paints the eaves. 



(CONTINUED)30.

CONTINUED:

Herman stomps out the front door, barely noticing laboring 
Tim, and charges across the lawn toward Grandpa.  

QUICK POP TO:

HERMAN'S HEART

His stapled, stitched and steam-punked HEART PUMPS and BEATS 
LABORIOUSLY in fits and starts, already over-excited.

RIGHT BACK TO:

HERMAN   

He stops and winces at his chest pain, then takes a deep 
breath and continues across the lawn very, very calmly.  

HERMAN
Why is that man painting the house?

GRANDPA
What people will do for a cookie.

HERMAN
What did you put in that cookie?

GRANDPA
I may have cut myself while baking.

HERMAN
Please don't turn the neighbors 
into your blood slaves.

CAMERA SWIVELS OFF Herman and Grandpa, RACES ACROSS THE YARD, 
UP THE HOUSE, PAST Eddie's eyes peeking over the lip of a 
second story window ledge, watching Herman and Grandpa argue, 
FINDING Neighbor Tim is high on a ladder happily painting.  

ON HERMAN AND GRANDPA

Herman speaks to Grandpa in a steady manner as to not upset 
himself.  His tone is pleasant, like a warm "how do you do:"

HERMAN (CONT D)
What I'm about to say I will say 
calmly with even-tempered civility.  
However, you should interpret my 
politeness as severe disapproval.

Herman takes a long, soothing breath as Tim climbs down the 
ladder and collects a BUCKET OF PAINT, then climbs back up.




(CONTINUED)31.

CONTINUED:

GRANDPA
You disapprove of an open, honest 
dialogue with my grandson about the 
changes his body is going through?  

HERMAN
I disapprove of you freaking him out.

GRANDPA
Only one I see freaking out is you.  
Frankly, your heart can't take it.

Another deep, cleansing breath for Herman.

HERMAN
Eddie is a sensitive little boy.

GRANDPA
Don't be too hard on yourself for 
raising him that way.  You didn't 
know.  How could you?  After 
Marilyn, we all assumed the worst.  

HERMAN
Eddie was born pink and chubby and 
was raised accordingly.

GRANDPA
Not so pink anymore.  He finally 
has the genetic license he needs to 
be the Munster he was meant to be.

HERMAN
I issued his genetic license.

GRANDPA
You weren't a Munster until I made 
you a Munster.  Eddie was born one 
and not a thing you've done or can 
do as a parent will change that.

Herman is momentarily stunned by the blunt trauma of that 
statement.  He searches for a response, but instead finds:

GRANDPA (CONT D)
Careful.  You're one popped stitch 
from a full coronary.  And since 
that heart and I have a difference 
of opinion, I wouldn't count on me 
putting it back together again when 
fresher options are available.




(CONTINUED)32.

CONTINUED: (2)

HERMAN
What would you tell Eddie?  

GRANDPA
The truth.

HERMAN
That you exsanguinated his Scout 
Master and I took his heart?

GRANDPA
Yes.  I'm curious what he'd have to 
say on the subject.  I honestly 
don't know what you're waiting for.  
Hearts don't just fall off trees.

PLUNK.  A PAINT CAN falls in the dirt.

ON THE SECOND STORY WINDOW

Neighbor Tim falls from atop the ladder, a FRESH STREAK OF 
PAINT across the Second Story Window and down the exterior 
wall charts his descent.  He lands with a heavy WOMPF.

TIME CUT TO:

MOMENTS LATER

Herman has a comforting arm around Eddie's shoulder as they 
watch PARAMEDICS pull a sheet over Neighbor Tim's dead body 
then load him into the back of their AMBULANCE.  CAMERA FINDS 
Grandpa comforting Tim's SHRILL, SOBBING WIFE, DOT.

DOT
I don't understand any of this.  I 
couldn't get him to sweep the front 
porch and he works himself to death 
painting the neighbor's house.

Dot nibbles on a cookie as Grandpa comforts her.

GRANDPA
It's a testament to his character.

Her sobs begin to thin as she falls under Grandpa's spell.

DOT
These cookies are really good.

GRANDPA
It may be presumptuous of me to 
say, but you don't seem quite as 
upset as you thought you were.



(CONTINUED)33.

CONTINUED:

Considering that, Dot realizes she isn't terribly upset.

DOT
No, I'm not.  Not anymore.

GRANDPA
The strangest thing about grieving 
is realizing your loved one's death 
isn't all that big of a deal.

DOT
It does seem like a silly thing to 
get upset about, doesn't it?

GRANDPA
Have another cookie.

CAMERA FINDS Eddie and Herman as Eddie asks a Paramedic:

EDDIE
How did he die?

PARAMEDIC
Heart attack.

Herman turns to see Grandpa now standing next to him.

GRANDPA
Your options are dwindling.

Herman's eyes narrow.

CLOSE ON - DOORBELL

A FINGER ENTERS FRAME and rings the bell.  BINGBONG.  

We are --

EXT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - FRONT PORCH

Scout Master Steve stands on the well-worn door mat, testing 
an odd creek in the floorboards, as Grandpa OPENS THE DOOR.

ACT FOUR

CLOSE ON - A COVERED SILVER FOOD PLATTER

The hauntingly distorted image of the Munster house against 
the misty, starry night is reflected on the silver dome as 
CAMERA REVEALS Dot, wearing an apron, carrying the platter.

Then CAMERA REVEALS a SMALL PARADE OF NEIGHBORS, six in 
total, following immediately behind Dot, all carrying dishes.

DOT0
I hope you like it bloody!

This serves as Dot's enthusiastic greeting as she approaches:

EXT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Grandpa and Scout Master Steve sit on the porch swing, gently 
rocking back and forth.  Grandpa's old-fashioned 
sensibilities combine with the Victorian house to give a very 
classic "Meet Me in St. Louis" feeling to the scene.  

GRANDPA
Dot recently lost her husband.

Dot climbs the stairs and stops briefly before going inside, 
causing a few drops of blood to spill off the platter.  

DOT
Very recently.  But I'm feeling 
better about it by the minute.  I'm 
gonna put this beef on the table.

The Small Parade of Neighbors continues into the house with 
trays of food, smiling and nodding to a pleasant Grandpa.

VARIOUS NEIGHBORSGRANDPA
Evening.  Evening!  Evening.Evening.

The last of the parading neighbors passes through the front 
door as Grandpa turns back to Scout Master Steve.

GRANDPA
Marriage and mortality.  "'Till 
death us do part."

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Death wasn't strong enough to part 
the sea of love I swam with my wife.





(CONTINUED)35.

CONTINUED:

GRANDPA
I've had countless brides.  They're 
all dead now, but we keep in touch.

Steve feels a kinship with Grandpa, who seems to understand.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
I feel Wendie Jo with me every day.

GRANDPA
As lovely a sentiment as that is, 
and it really is just so nice, have 
you thought about opening your 
heart to new possibilities?

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Oh, no.  I couldn't.

GRANDPA
Wendie Jo isn't going to claw her 
way out of the grave to stop you 
from loving and being loved.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
She was cremated.  And entombed.

GRANDPA
Steve, I've not been entirely 
honest with you.  I had an ulterior 
motive for inviting you to dinner.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
(good-natured)
Uh-oh!

GRANDPA
Of all my scores of children, my 
daughter Lily is the only one who 
actually loves me.  And I fear she 
may be without love herself. 

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
What about Herman?

GRANDPA
Herman's dying.  It's his heart.  
He's inconsolable at the thought of 
leaving Lily and Eddie without a 
husband and father, respectively.  
He's enlisted me to find a man with 
a good heart his family can love.  




(CONTINUED)36.

CONTINUED: (2)

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Poor Herman.  

GRANDPA
Yes, but we're talking about Lily.  
You're a widower and she's soon to 
be a widow.  Please don't hate me 
for being so wicked and conniving.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Seems awfully sudden.  Since her 
husband is still alive.

GRANDPA
He could go at any moment.  I'm 
simply asking you to open your 
heart to a kindred spirit.  Give a 
dying man and his tormented family 
a little hope for the future.

Scout Master Steve considers that, then:

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
I look forward to meeting your 
daughter, sir.

Grandpa waves his hand in front of Scout Master Steve's face 
planting the seeds of suggestion in his mind:

GRANDPA
You're going to love Lily.

As the underlying charm of Grandpa's words sinks in, Dot and 
the Parade of Neighbors file out of the house with a simple:

DOT
Bon appetite!

SMASH CUT TO:

HERMAN'S HEART

BDUM-FFFFF-BDUM-FFFFF-BDUM-FFFFF.  The steam-punked tissue 
RACES in fits and starts, straining against the mechanics 
holding it together.  CAMERA PULLS OUT to find Herman is --

INT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CAMERA CONTINUES PULLING BACK REVEALING Herman is sitting 
with the entire family.  He eyes Grandpa at the head of the 
grand table, terrified what he is plotting.  Lily is flanked 
by Steve and Herman.  Marilyn and Eddie flank Grandpa.  




(CONTINUED)37.

CONTINUED:

HERMAN
(winces at his heart)
This is so exciting.  An unexpected 
guest.  What could happen next.

The rhetorical question is clearly directed at Grandpa across 
a table littered with MEAT DISHES.  Pork, duck, chicken, 
venison, rabbit -- all beautifully prepared -- to Eddie's 
chagrin.  Herman notices Steve cannot take his eyes off Lily.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
I didn't mean to be a surprise.

GRANDPA
I meant for you to be a surprise.

LILY
Grandpa's surprises make me nervous.

Scout Master Steve puts a comforting hand on her shoulder.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
It's okay if you're nervous.  
Mealtime anxiety is common, 
especially during times of loss.  

GRANDPA
Upsetting to think someone at the 
table could be having their last meal.

Scout Master Steve nods while the others stare at Grandpa, 
who is clearly up to something nefarious.  Lily notices:

LILY
(to Herman)
Is your heart making that noise?

Herman swerves around the question and asks the Scout Master:

HERMAN
Did Grandpa happen to say what his 
intentions were for you tonight?

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Just opening my heart to new 
possibilities.
(then, to Lily)
Let me serve you.

Scout Master Steve stares, charmed, at Lily as he cuts meat 
off the pig's rump roast and places it on her plate.  




(CONTINUED)38.

CONTINUED: (2)

MARILYN
Steve, are you depressed or lonely?  
Maybe feeling so-so about life?  I 
don't understand why you're here.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Not feeling so-so, I'm feeling gung-
ho.  Feels like I'm sitting down 
sharing a meal with my own family.

GRANDPA
Part of you is.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
(to Lily)
You certainly make me feel at home.

GRANDPA
"Home is where the heart is."  
Isn't that right, Herman?

HERMAN
(quietly to himself)
Ohmygod.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Eddie, you ever make a family tree?

EDDIE
Our family tree would just be a 
stump.  Only goes back to Grandpa 
and he's been alive forever.

Lily saws off bite-size pieces of meat, raises them to her 
mouth and allows SPIDERS to snatch them into the rafters when 
Scout Master Steve isn't looking.  Then she fake chews.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
We could make a family stump then.  
Or shrubbery.  It's a real nice way 
to earn a Genealogy merit badge and 
remember everyone who's ever been a 
branch on that stump or shrubbery, 
even though they may be gone.  

Herman realizes Scout Master Steve is talking about him.

HERMAN
My branch is still here.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Your branch will always be here on 
the family stump or shrubbery.



(CONTINUED)39.

CONTINUED: (3)

Then he squeezes Lily's hand and she turns to Herman:

LILY
Can I see you in the kitchen?

INT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Lily and Herman mid-discussion:

LILY
To be clear, I don't want you or 
Grandpa murdering your son's Scout 
Master.  Set a better example than 
that.  What would Eddie think?

HERMAN 
He would think horrible things. 

LILY
Then what are you thinking?

Herman unbuttons his shirt, pops off his sternum plate and 
shows his wife his wheezing steam-punk heart.

LILY (CONT D)
What did you do to it?

HERMAN
I broke it.

LILY
I think you love too much.

HERMAN
I know I love too much.  Now my 
heart's going to explode.  My brain 
will lose oxygen and Grandpa will 
shove the nearest replacement into 
the hole in my chest and I'll be a 
reanimated reanimated man with 
brain damage and a strange heart.

Herman can't being sentimental over his failing heart.

HERMAN (CONT D)
This is Eddie's dad's heart.  The 
heart that fell in love with you.  

LILY
The Scout Master falling in love 
with me isn't going to make his 
heart feel any more like yours.




(CONTINUED)40.

CONTINUED:

HERMAN
That is all your father's doing.  I 
don't want Scout Master Steve's 
heart.  I don't want any heart 
except the heart I already have.  

LILY
Next heart will fall in love with 
me, too, and the one after that.

HERMAN
I'm going to miss how this feels.

LILY
If you miss it, Eddie has the same 
one beating in his chest.  He is 
still your son.  You don't need a 
broken heart to tell you that.


INT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

In the absence of Lily and Herman, Scout Master Steve takes 
stock of the empty plate in front of Eddie. 

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Easy to lose your appetite when 
you're worried about your dad, huh?

EDDIE
I don't eat meat.

It's as if he just told his Catholic Grandmother he doesn't 
believe in God.  Grandpa sits up, unwilling to let this pass.

GRANDPA
Since when?

EDDIE
Since whenever the last time I ate 
meat was, which will be the last 
time I will ever eat meat.  

The mood has gotten tense between Grandpa and a very willful 
Eddie.  Marilyn and Scout Master Steve observe the volley.

GRANDPA
I would never reach across this 
table and slap you.  But I will 
think about it hard enough that 
you'll feel like you got slapped.




(CONTINUED)41.

CONTINUED:

Grandpa removes the silver cover to Dot's platter revealing a 
big, bloody loaf of delicious Beef Wellington.  The steam 
rolling off the beef crosses to Eddie's flaring nostrils. 

GRANDPA (CONT D)
It's the temperature it would be if 
it were walking around.

MARILYN
Not appetizing to anyone but you.

A single bead of sweat creeps out of Eddie's hairline and 
streaks down his cheek as Grandpa drops a bloody slice of 
Beef Wellington on the plate in front of him.

EDDIE
I'm not eating it.

GRANDPA
You're not getting up from this 
table until you do.

Grandpa notices Eddie has pushed the Wellington around, 
arranging the meat and crust to resemble a frowning cow.

GRANDPA (CONT D)
Stop playing with your food.

EDDIE
(re: Scout Master Steve)
I will if you will.

GRANDPA
That's a gross cliche.  You're 
better than that.

Eddie glances at Scout Master Steve and simply says:

EDDIE
Grandpa wants to eat you.

MARILYN
Right now?  

The confused Scout Master doesn't know how to take any of it.

GRANDPA
(shrugs)
Kids.
CUT TO BLACK.


END OF ACT FOUR42.


ACT FIVE

INT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Bboth Eddie and Grandpa stare stubbornly into middle-
distance, refusing to look at each other.  Scout Master Steve 
politely listens to Marilyn as she tries to assert herself:

MARILYN
I'm going to campaign against 
eating in or around the house 
certain food groups.  I have a few 
arguments I've been preparing.

Dot and the Parade of Neighbors ENTER and begin bussing the 
table and freshening napkins, unaware of the tension.

DOT
Let us just get some of these 
plates out of the way.

Dot clears the table of the large meat dishes, handing the 
awkward Parade of Neighbors each a platter of food.

MARILYN
I know --

GRANDPA
Don t say you know cause you don t.  

MARILYN
I know some things.

GRANDPA
 going to be the same person You re
 tomorrow you are today and that s
 never going to change.  Nothing s
ever going to be different for you.  

MARILYN
 you have to say it like that?Why d

GRANDPA
To clarify how much you don't know 
so you wouldn't interrupt me again.

Dot knows when it is time for her to leave.

DOT
We can come back later.

Dot quickly ushers the Parade of Neighbors out the door as 
Lily and Herman ENTER from the Kitchen.



(CONTINUED)43.

CONTINUED:

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Eddie, you don't really think your 
Grandpa is going to eat me, do you?

EDDIE
Yes.

GRANDPA
These fantasies occur to a child 
living in a hobo murder house.

EDDIE
Please don't let Grandpa eat Steve.

LILY
Nobody is eating Steve.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
(touched)
Awww.  Thank you.

HERMAN
Steve, this has been a lovely 
evening, but I'm afraid we have 
some family matters to attend to.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
I completely understand.  Have to 
get to those things while you can.

Eddie pushes himself away from the table and stomps off.

LILY
Eddie...

He doesn't stop.

HERMAN
Marilyn, would you show Steve the 
way out.  To safety.  Steve, we'll 
see you at the next Troop meeting.

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
If you're still with us, I would 
love to see you there.
(then)
Lily. 

Before Lily can protest Scout Master Steve gives her a warm 
embrace usually reserved for the closest friends and lovers.

LILY
Good night, Steve.  And good luck.

THE FOYER

Marilyn helps Scout Master Steve on with his coat.

MARILYN
So nice to meet you.

Marilyn smiles politely as she opens the door for Scout 
Master Steve, whispering briefly as she shoves him out:

MARILYN (CONT D)
Run.

EXT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

The door SHUTS CURTLY on Scout Master Steve's heels.  The 
floor boards under the welcome mat creeks peculiarly.

Scout Master Steve takes a deep breath and sighs, smitten:

SCOUT MASTER STEVE
Lily.

Then THE WELCOME MAT DROPS OUT BENEATH HIM.  Scout Master 
Steve PLUNGES INTO THE BOWELS OF 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE.

INT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - BETWEEN THE WALLS - NIGHT

Scout Master Steve falls down a jagged, craggy chute lined 
with thin wood slats calked together decades ago.

He lands with a BOUNCE on a mattress suspended over an open 
POOL OF ACID.  It dips briefly into the pool before it tosses 
Scout Master Steve back into the air even as the ACID EATS AN 
EXPANDING HOLE through the center of the mattress.

Scout Master Steve sails over a PIT OF QUICKLIME and lands 
with a WOMPF and a dust cloud on Grandpa's OPERATING TABLE.

We are --

INT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - GRANDPA'S DUNGEON LAB - NIGHT

Grandpa waves away the dissipating cloud of dust as Scout 
Master Steve tries to get his bearings, still on the slab.

GRANDPA
I'm so grateful you missed the pit 
of quicklime and the pool of acid.  
That would have been a disaster.

SMASH CUT TO:45.


EXT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

CAMERA FINDS Herman and Eddie sitting side by side on the 
highest pitch near the chimney, under the lightning rod.

EDDIE
Grandpa is not a gentleman.

HERMAN
I know he isn't.  And I know you 
spent the last 10 years growing 
into a perfect little gentleman but 
the sad truth of it is, your 
hormones are going to throw that 
little gentleman under a bus.

EDDIE
Are you talking about puberty?

HERMAN
And then some.  

EDDIE
I know about embarrassing dreams 
and growing hair in strange places.

HERMAN
What about growing hair everywhere.

EDDIE
Where else does it grow?

Herman's mind reels, looking for somewhere to go that isn't 
the conversation he's about to have.  He takes the leap:

HERMAN
There was no baby bear.

EDDIE
What was it?

HERMAN
You.

EDDIE
What?

HERMAN
You're the baby bear.

It hangs there a moment as Eddie's world drops out under him.




(CONTINUED)46.

CONTINUED:

EDDIE
I thought I was ravaged and tossed 
naked into the shrubs.

HERMAN
That wasn't you.  You ravaged and 
ran naked through the shrubs.  

Eddie starts to breath hard, trying to keep from passing out.

HERMAN (CONT D)
You are a Munster.  You are not a 
monster.  Eddie.  Look at me.

Eddie finally, reluctantly raises his head, eyes near tears.

EDDIE
Did I hurt anybody?

HERMAN
There were a few scratches.  Worth 
the price of the camp fire 
anecdote.  You didn't do anything 
worse than turn into a werewolf.

EDDIE
There isn't anything worse.

HERMAN
I love you, Eddie.  You have 
nothing to be ashamed of.  You have 
something to be careful of.  You 
also have me and your mom.

EDDIE
Mom says Munsters eat meat.  I 
don't want to eat meat.  

HERMAN
You don't have to be like any 
Munster there is.  Except Eddie 
Munster, who doesn't eat meat.

EDDIE
I can't be a vegetarian werewolf.

HERMAN
You can be a vegetarian when you 
can help it, and when you can't, 
that problem we'll solve together.

Eddie nods his head solemnly, not convinced.  Unfortunately, 
his father Herman isn't any more convinced.  



(CONTINUED)47.

CONTINUED: (2)

HERMAN (CONT D)
Go get ready for bed.

Eddie allows his father to kiss him on the forehead, then 
walks balance-beam style OUT OF FRAME, leaving Herman alone.

A moment as Herman looks out at the foggy night and considers 
the road ahead and raising a teenage werewolf.  Then...

HERMAN'S HEART

PLUPT!  Herman's weathered, worn, stapled, stitched and steam-
punked heart EXPLODES IN HIS CHEST.

THE ROOF

Herman's face goes slack and he tumbles backward, sliding 
down the cobbled slope of tiles and off the roof.

ON HERMAN

He soars past the rain gutter in SLOW MOTION and over the 
edge.  CAMERA FOLLOWS Herman's descent on his sad, bewildered 
expression of a man whose life was suddenly stolen away.

The ground rushes up at Herman and as he's about to hit...

CUT TO BLACK.

INT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - GRANDPA'S DUNGEON LAB - NIGHT

Herman, affixed to Grandpa's slab, slowly comes to. 

HERMAN
I was dreaming there was this 
horrible car accident.  It felt 
like I was on a shopping spree.

His eyes drift to Scout Master Steve's neatly folded clothes, 
resting next to his neatly folded sack of skin, resting 
beside a tidy pile of broken bones, marrow neatly sucked out.  

HERMAN (CONT D)
Oh, Grandpa.  How could you.

Grandpa turns around REVEALING Scout Master Steve's fresh 
blood transformed him into a handsome, dapper, younger man.  
He finishes politely sucking the marrow from a bone, then:

YOUTHFUL GRANDPA
You're good as new.
CUT TO BLACK.
END OF ACT FIVE48.


ACT SIX

EXT. 1313 MOCKINGBIRD LANE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

Herman and Eddie are both wearing age-appropriate Boy Scouts 
of America uniforms, Lily dressed in a spider-silk dress.

LILY
What's the Boy Scout motto?

EDDIE
"Be prepared."

HERMAN
Consider yourself prepared.

EDDIE
For what?

HERMAN
Vegetarianism.  

LILY
You don't have to worry about 
eating anything or anyone ever 
again.  Not "ever again" because 
"again" means it happened before.

HERMAN
And it didn't.

EDDIE
Are you going to kennel me?

HERMAN
We got you something from a kennel.

LILY
Think of it like that dog at your 
last school who could smell seizures.

EDDIE
That kid had a condition.

LILY
You have a condition.

EDDIE
A dog with a vest tells everybody I 
have a condition.





(CONTINUED)49.

CONTINUED:

HERMAN
Nobody has a dog like this.  You'll 
be the envy of all your everyone.

EDDIE
That's like telling a disabled 
person their wheelchair looks fun.

LILY
You have a disability.  Next time 
you have an episode, before you even 
sprout one hair, you've got a friend 
who can get you to a place you won't 
hurt yourself or anybody else.

EDDIE
A dog can't stop a werewolf from 
eating somebody.

HERMAN
No, but a dragon can.

He WHISTLES and calls as though calling a dog from the sky:

HERMAN (CONT D)
Spot!  

He directs Eddie's attention to the sky, where:  A SHADOW 
GROWS DARKER as whatever LARGE WINGED THING casting it is 
 a WHOOSH about to descend out of the MORNING FOG.  There s
from above as a FLEETING BEAST emerges.  We get only a 
 SCALES SHIFT TEXTURE AND glimpse of the DRAGON before it s
COLOR IRIDESCENTLY like an oil slick before it becomes 99.9% 
INVISIBLE.  The tissue of its scales are bending light but we 
still FEEL the WOMPF as it lands in the backyard.

ON EDDIE

He is appropriately awestruck at the massive beast.  Eddie 
reaches up and strokes Spot's snout as it disappears.

Although the rest of Spot is 99.9% invisible, its EYES 
affectionately FLICKER as TWIN FLAMES erupt from its snout, 
spraying out safely above Eddie's head, illuminating rows of 
JAGGED DEADLY TEETH with reflective light.

Eddie turns to his parents:

EDDIE
Do I get to keep him?
