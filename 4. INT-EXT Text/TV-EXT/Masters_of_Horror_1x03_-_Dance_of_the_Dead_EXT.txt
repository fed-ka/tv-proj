      Clear. OVER we HEAR the laughter of three little girls and 
      two mothers. CAMERA descends from the blue sky. Now 
      everything is in dreamy, stylized fragments:

      The five in the back yard of a simple house. Sisters PEGGY 
      (7) and ANNA (10), their mother KATE. MARIEL (9) and her 
      mother GERRI. Having fun.

      The sky darkens a little. Black flakes begin to gently fall.

      One lands softly on Mariel s face. Starts to burn the skin; 
      bore into it.  She SCREAMS. So do Peggy and Anna; terrified.

      More black flakes silently falls.  Mariel is being eaten, to 
      the bone, by it.  Shrieking; helpless.  The mother s SCREAM. 
      It is nightmarish. OVER we HEAR a woman's SUFFERING GROAN

                                                              CUT TO:


      Peggy walks to Gerri a half block from the diner.  She has a 
      sandwich wrapped up in a napkin.

                                  PEGGY
                    Gerri?
                          (as Gerri turns)
                    It's Peggy.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    7A.



      Peggy offers her the wrapped-up sandwich.  Gerri hesitantly 
      takes it.

                                  GERRI
                            (appreciatively)
                    You were always the good one.

                                  PEGGY
                    I gotta go.

      Peggy walks, quickly, back to the diner.

      GERRI

      Brings the sandwich up under the veil.  As she chews, we see 
      her jaw is exposed bone, her muscles like something from a 
      medical-book.  The sight of her eating is horrible.


      Driving in Muskeet.  It turns down a deserted, crapped-out 
      alley.  Parks beside a dumpster.  The driver and another man 
      get out.  Both are large, wear dark coveralls, gloves.  They 
      go around to the back of the van.  Place breathing masks 
      (filters) over mouths.  Unlock and open the door.

      ANGLE- INSIDE VAN

      They pull away a tarp to reveal a tangle of

      FIVE DEAD BODIES

      All young women.  Pale, naked.  Wearing lurid make-up.  A 
      ghastly weave of limbs and curves.  Their lean bodies are 
      faintly bruised, unmarred by obvious wounds.  They might be 
      murder victims but it's hard to discern how they died.

      THE TWO MEN

      Grab the slender corpses, pull them, one by one, from the 
      van.  Toss them into the dumpster.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    11.



      As they move them, one woman's pale fingers suddenly clutch 
      onto the driver's arm.  She seems to look at him with 
      pleading eyes, mascara and lipstick smeared.

                                  ONE MAN
                          (to the other)
                      ...fuckin' believe this?

      They both chuckle under their breathing masks.  He prys her 
      hand away, tosses her into the pile inside the dumpster with 
      the others.  Her fingers continue to work; clutching at 
      nothing.


      Oily smoke seeps at its seam.  The driver goes to shut it.  
      The lid opens a bit more, as the bodies inside contort, keep 
      pressing it upward.  The woman who clutched the driver's arm 
      can be seen, staring from flames which gobble her.

      The driver watches as her mouth widens and her face melts.  
      Her mouth emits a hideous humming noise.  Her lips melt away, 
      further, to show teeth and the humming gets louder; more 
      ghastly.

                                                              CUT TO:


      Peggy comes down the back stairs and exits.


      Peggy is on foot.  Fearful of the empty streets.  Nearing the 
      CLOSED diner.  The streets are empty except for a few cars 
      that pass.  Streetlights flicker; unrepaired.

      Rusted police cars roam, unnerving cop faces glaring from 
      inside.  They bleach her with their searchlight.  Move on.

      Septic winds rake night; streets.

      Peggy hears a noise: in the diner.  Something is inside.  It 
      scares her.  She gets closer; confused.  Didn't she lock it?

      She sees a small orange light inside.  It moves.

      She gathers her courage.  Uses her key, unlocks the diner.  
      Cautiously enters.


      Boxx behind the wheel.  Celia beside him, looking cheap; 
      succulent.  Expendable.  Boxx knobs-down the brain-melt 
      music.  Smiles cobra charm at Jak and Peggy.

                                  BOXX
                    Aren't you tots out a little late?

                                  JAK
                    Not yet.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    22.



                                  CELIA
                          (studies her)
                    Mommy let you out?  Doesn't your 
                    Bible get lonely.

                                  PEGGY
                    I should go home, Jak.

                                  BOXX
                    Fuck her, man.  We got places to 
                    be, Jak.  More things to sell...

      Peggy turns.  Re-locks the diner.  Jak gets close; speaks 
      with calm; reassurance.

                                  JAK
                    ...hey, I won't let anything happen 
                    to you.  Except what you want.

                                  PEGGY
                      I shouldn't even be out.  My Mother 
                    will be worried sick.

      Peggy doesn't want to tell him everything.  Has to:

                                  PEGGY (CONT'D)
                    I'm all she has.

      He looks at her.  Understands.  Breaks it to her:

                                  JAK
                    Then, you're in a prison.  And 
                    you're never getting out.  See ya.

      He walks toward Boxx and Celia.  Peggy finishes locking the 
      diner door.  Walks away in the opposite direction.



      Jak hops in back.  Stares at stars.

                                  BOXX
                    So.  We good?

      Jak is disappointed, a little pissed.

                                  JAK
                    Not even close.

                                  CELIA
                    She's a spoiled little fuck, Jak.  
                    Too young for you.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    23.



                                  JAK
                    ...maybe I'm too old for me.

                                  BOXX
                    Deep.  What's your fuckin' problem?

                                  JAK
                    What isn't?

                                  BOXX
                    Know what we need?  WE NEED TO HAVE 
                    SOME SHITKICKING FUN!!

      An unamused smile from Jak.


      MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE2323

      Roars away.  Screeches to a stop, half a block down.  Peggy 
      is suddenly in it's headlights.  She stares at them.  Jak 
      reacts to her as she looks into his eyes.

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

      P.O.V.- MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE2424

      Rocketing toward Muskeet.  OVER we HEAR Boxx singing a song 
      he seems to make-up and yell/sing.

                      STRUGGLE!"


      This is Peggy's 7th birthday party, in Kate s backyard. The 
      sequence is the full version of Kate s earlier nightmare.  

      Present beneath the bright balloons are Peggy, her little 
      birthday friend Mariel and Mariel s mother, GERRI who hums 
      and fusses with sandwiches for the girls.  Kate is happy, 
      young.  Taking care of everything.  Even the sun shines more 
      brightly.

      Also present is Peggy's older sister ANNA; a pretty girl of 
      10.

      VARIOUS

      The little girls are laughing, dancing, having an impromptu 
      Silly String fight.

                                  KATE (V.O.)
                    Girrrlss!  You're making a mess.  
                    Ruining the backyard.  I'd really 
                    like to get a close-up!

      KATE

      Videotapes the party.  Having lots of fun.  Swings the camera 
      over to Anna for a moment.

                                  KATE (V.O.) (CONT'D)

      Through the lens.  Placing candles on the cake and starting 
      to light them.  Anna tries to sneak a fingertip of frosting.

                                  KATE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Anna!

      The way she said it was a little too firm.  It hurts Anna's 
      feelings.

                                  ANNA
                    You would've let Peggy do it.

                                  KATE (V.O.)
                      Sweetheart,it's Peggy's  birthday.  
                    You're 7 years old today, isn't

                                  PEGGY
                    Peggy.  Not Peg.

                                  ANNA
                    You wouldn't've let me do it even 
                    if it was my birthday.  I wish 
                    Daddy was here.  He'd be on my 
                    side.

                                  KATE (V.O.)
                    Your sister is tired of all your 
                      complaining.

                                  ANNA
                    It's you.  What did I do to you?

                                  KATE (V.O.)
                            (pleasantly)
                    You're just a little willful, 
                    honey.  That's all.

      Anna frowns.  Looks upward.

                                  ANNA
                    What's wrong with the sky?

      Suddenly Mariel cries out in pain.

      The VIDCAM POV swings over to her.  Her cheek has an open 
      blister.

      Both mothers look up at the sky.  It has gotten a bit darker, 
      as if a cloud covers the sun.  And thin, grey flakes are 
      falling.

                                  KATE
                    It's "BLIZZ"...everybody take 
                    cover.  For Godsake!

      The VIDCAM is dropped, it's POV tumbling.

      Is getting covered by the gently-falling BLIZZ as she tries 
      to shield her screaming daughter, covering her eyes and face.





      Gerri and Mariel are screaming, pleading to be let in.  Being 
      burned to the bone by BLIZZ.  They SCREAM in helpless terror, 
      faces melting from the BLIZZ.  OVER we HEAR Boxx's HOWLING 
      AND HOOTING laughter

        PEGGY-CLOSE3434

      Coming out of the drug-induced nightmare/flashback.  She's

      PEGGY

      Manages to sit up.  Her hair blows in chill air as the 
      Mustang Convertible races through night.  Jak smiles at her.

                                  PEGGY

                    I saw bad things.  BLIZZ.  They 
                    dropped some during my birthday 
                    party when I was seven. I watched 
                    my friends burn to death.

                                  JAK
                    BLIZZ got a lot of people.  My

      He says nothing more.  Peggy sees his pain.

      CELIA

      Is taking the same stuff they snorted and putting it into a 
      syringe.  Mixing it with spit she dribbles into the syringe.  
      She shakes it up.  It turns amber-colored.  To Peggy:

      Boxx waggles eyebrows at them in the rearview.  Peggy is 
      lost; uneasy.  Boxx goes, again, into his official Academic

                    That was one fucking busy war.

      He rolls up sleeve.  Celia moves the syringe to his forearm,

      SYRINGE

      The amber drug inside shimmers and quivers.  OVER we HEAR

                                  PEGGY (V.O.)
                    Jak where are we going?

      ALL

      Peggy is nervous.  Boxx passes back the syringe.  Jak quickly 
      jabs himself.  Boxx howls and beeps the horn.  Swerves 
      wildly, headlights zagging.

      Jak offers the syringe to Peggy.  She doesn't want any.  Boxx 
      laughs like a twisted banshee.

                                  CELIA
                    Ever see the loopys dance, Bambi?

                                  JAK
                    Shut up, Celia.

                                  BOXX
                    Oh, she's got to see that.  Got to 
                    give Bambi a thrill.

      Peggy looks at a passing roadsign.


      PASSING ROADSIGN3535

      It reads "MUSKEET": 9 MILES. (Production Note: MUSKEET is 50 
      miles away. An hour s drive.)



      Kate goes to her car.

      OMIT3939




      The sick viscera of a half-devastated U.S. city; WWIII tore 
      down most of the country and world in 2007.

      Cities are re-building.  But MUSKEET just gets worse; a bad 
      place.  Rabid gangs roam.  Cars burn.  Howls echo from 
      abandoned buildings. Bleakness has overtaken everything.

      Frightening looking, skeletal figures rim the roadsides; 
      looking for a ride, a hand-out.  Their fleshless faces watch 
      the cars go by.


      Kate races toward Muskeet.*


      Kate rockets to Muskeet.*


      Downtown MUSKEET.  Even more dangerous and brutal up close.  
      Lethal denizens drift.  Businesses are illicit; faces that 
      run them pure predator.


      MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE5151

      Parks.  A CREEP approaches.  Checks out the MUSTANG.

                                  BOXX
                    Like it?

                                  CREEP
                    I wanna fuck it.

      Boxx tosses the CREEP the keys.

                                  BOXX
                    Watch out for the airbag.

      The Creep is in love.

      BOX, JAK, CELIA, PEGGY

      Walk on blood-soaked sidewalks, avoiding more Creeps.

                                  PEGGY
                    ...you just gave him your car.

                                  BOXX
                    Wasn't mine.  When we leave, we 
                    steal another one.



                                  JAK
                    Follow me.

      Jak leads.  Peggy hesitates; Muskeet is scaring her.  He 
      looks into her eyes, sees it.  She smiles, nervously.

                                  PEGGY
                    ...I'm okay.

                                  JAK
                    I won't let anything happen to you.

                                  PEGGY
                    Except what I want.

      They both remember that earlier promise he'd made to her.

        ALLEYS-BOXX, JAK, CELIA, PEGGY5454

      Moving through a succession of alleys and grimy corridors.  
      They finally reach a heavy metal door which is guarded by two 
      DOOR MEN.  Frenetic dancing music pounds from inside.  



                                                                              (CONTINUED)              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    36.


      The shrieks of a wasted crowd.  The door buckles out a bit as 
      someone bumps against it hard from inside.

                                  JAK
                    Here to see him.

                                  GIANT DOOR GUY
                    Second time today.  You guys are 
                    good, eh?

                                  BOXX
                    Fuckin great.

      Boxx shows him the package they've brought.  One of the DOOR 
      GUYS nods.  The door is opened.


      Kate arrives.*



      Kate parks her car. Gets out. She instantly has a knife to 
      her throat. ADJUST to reveal the CREEP from earlier, spinning 
      the keys to the car in his hand. She stares at him without 
      fear.

                                  CREEP
                    Whattya doin  in our cesspool lady?

                                  KATE
                    I m looking for someone.

                                  CREEP
                    Oh, yeah?

                                  KATE
                    A girl.

                                  CREEP
                    What s her name?

                                  KATE
                    Doesn t matter.

                                  CREEP
                    ...that s a fucked-up name.

      He cups her breasts. Tears her blouse open. Starts to slide 
      hand into her pants.

                                  CREEP
                    Let s go for a ride in my new car.

      Looks at his hungry eyes. Slams her boot onto his insole. He 
      drops the knife. She instantly runs.

      THE CREEP

      Laughs at her.

                                  CREEP
                    AIN T NO WAY OUT, CUNT! IT S FUCKIN

                    THIS IS MY FUCKIN CAR!!!

      He pounds it harder and harder.



      Kate runs as fast as she can. Looks back to make sure she 
      isn t being followed.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Kate walks cautiously.  Seems to know where she's going.              "Dance of the Dead", Yellow Revision, 07/19/05    43.




      Stark cameos, on an ashen rise.  Patting down the dirt on a 
      fresh grave.

      PEGGY

      Lost in sadness; grief.

                                  PEGGY
                    I'm alone now.

      He watches her.

                                  JAK
                    You don't have to be.

      She looks at him.  He's serious.  She slowly decides to trust 
      him.  Nods.  Takes his offered hand.  HOLD.

                                                              CUT TO:
