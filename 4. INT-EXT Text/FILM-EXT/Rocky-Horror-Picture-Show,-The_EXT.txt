CHORUS (Cont)
To the late night double feature
Picture Show.
The SONG ends with church bells ringing joyously as the IMAGE EXPANDS TO
WIDE-SCREEN.
The STILL FRAME bursts to life as the doors of the Denton
Catholic Church are flung open and Mendelssohn's wedding march resounds
from the church organ.
The young married couple, RALPH and BETTY HAPSCHATT appear followed by a
crowd of friends and well-wishers throwing confetti and shouting
excitedly.
The MINISTER shakes RALPH by the hand while RALPH slips him a $20 bill.
PHOTOGRAPHERS take pictures.
BRAD MAJORS, a young slightly awkward, clean-cut American in his mid-
twenties, comes over the congratulate RALPH.
BRAD and RALPH shake
hands.
RALPH
Well Brad, I guess we made it huh!
BRAD
Well I don't think there was any doubt
about that - You and Betty have been
almost inseparable ever since you sat
in on Dr Scott's refresher lectures.
RALPH
Tell you the truth Brad, she was the
only reason I came in the first place.
Science was never one of my favourite
subjects but I sure with Dr Scott
could have made it today.
BRAD
Yes, Janet and I are both fond of him.
We drove over to see him last vacation.
It's a shame his new job took him away
from Denton.
BETTY, the bride, throws the bouquet.
JANET catches it.
She squeals with delight.
The GUESTS cheer.
RALPH
Hey fella.
It looks like it could be
your turn next.
BRAD
Who knows...ha ha.
RALPH & BETTY drive off.
GUESTS wave and shout, BRAD & JANET with great
enthusiasm.
GUESTS begin to disperse.
JANET & BRAD linger outside the church.
So do a strange FAMILY :
An
old man with a pitchfork and his wife and daughter.
They resemble the
Quaker family in "American Gothic", a painting.
The MOTHER (MAGENTA) and FATHER (RIFF RAFF) stand outside the church
doors.
Their DAUGHTER (COLUMBIA) goes inside.
The FAMILY, and the
MINISTER (FRANK N. FURTER), and the GUESTS all resemble characters we
shall meet later at the Frank N. Furter place.
JANET (who is holding the bouquet)
Oh Brad, wasn't it wonderful. Didn't
Betty look radiantly beautiful.
Just an hour ago she was plain old
Betty Monroe.
Now she's Mrs.
Ralph Hapschatt.
BRAD (Still looking after the car)
Er...yes, Janet.......Ralph's a
lucky guy.
(They start to move d.s.)
JANET
Yes.
BRAD
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful
little cook.
JANET
Yes.
BRAD
And Ralph himself will be in line for
promotion in a year or so.
JANET
Yes.
FIRST CHORD OF "WEDDING SONG"
"WEDDING SONG" (Silent playback for dialogue)
With great decision BRAD turns on JANET
BRAD (spoken)
Hey Janet.
JANET
Yes Brad.
BRAD
I've got something to say.
JANET
Uh huh.
BRAD
I really loved the skilful way
You beat the other girls
To the bride's bouquet.
JANET
Oh Brad.
(Singing begins)
BRAD
The river was deep but I swam it.
FAMILY (Riff & Magenta)
Janet.
BRAD
The future is ours so let's plan it.
FAMILY (R & M)
Janet.
BRAD
So please don't tell me to can it.
FAMILY (R & M)
Janet.
BRAD
I've one thing to say and that's
Dammit, Janet.
I love you.
The road was long but I ran it.
(He runs backwards towards church doors)
FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
Janet.
BRAD (Climbing onto fence)
There's a fire in my heart
And you fan it.
(Jumps off)
FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
Janet.
BRAD
If there's one fool for you
Then I am it.
FAMILY (Riff and Magenta)
Janet.
BRAD (Getting chalk from pocket)
I've one thing to say and that's,
Dammit, Janet.
He chalks a heart and arrow on the church door, which Riff Raff proceeds
to wipe off.
BRAD
I love you.
JANET runs to him, he kneels and produces a ring.
BRAD
Here's a ring to prove that
I'm not joker.
CHURCH BELLS Peal out.
RIFF & MAGENTA open doors and solemnly enter the
church, door closes behind them.
BRAD
There's three ways that love can grow.
That's good bad or mediocre.
JANET grabs the ring as BRAD rises.
She throws down the bouquet and
would fall into BRAD's arms but he goes to the door to chalk on it
again.
BRAD
Oh - J - A - N - E - T
I love you so.
JANET, transfixed, bursts into the church.
A windscreen wiper working under strain.
Torrential rain on the
windscreen.
BRAD concentrating on visibility.
JANET eating chocolates
and listening to the car radio playing an Orson Welles serial - The
Shadow.
A motorcycle roars past them.
JANET
Gosh.
That's the third motorcyclist
that's passed us.
They certainly take
their lives in their hands.
What with
the weather and all.
BRAD
Yes, Janet.
Life's pretty cheap to
that type.
JANET takes another stick of gum.
Offers BRAD some.
He declines.
The car slows to a halt.
JANET
What's the matter Brad, darling?
Headlights on sign reading: "DEAD END".
BRAD
I think we took the wrong fork a few
miles back.
JANET
Oh dear!
But then where did the
motorcyclists come from?
BRAD
Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have
to turn back.
CUT TO
Car reverses.
BRAD puts his foot on the accelerator.
The wheel skids and explodes.
CUT TO
A bolt of lighting strikes a tree.

SONG:		"OVER AT THE FRANKENSTEIN PLACE"
The rain pours off the newspaper down JANET's face.
She walks along,
catching up with BRAD.
She sing plaintively.
JANET
In the velvet darkness
Of the blackest night
Burning bright.
We see the two of them - BRAD striding ahead, JANET nearly catching up
with him.
Behind them on the side of the road, sparse trees and rock formations.
JANET
There's a guiding star
No matter what or who you are.
They have passed a row of trees.
A rock formation in the shape of a
castle is silhouetted against the sky.
It has a flag flying from the
turret.
Lightning strikes.
A glow of light appears in a window.
It illuminates a path to the
castle.
BRAD and JANET turn.
The castle is in the distance between the two of them.
BRAD & JANET
There's a light
The castle looms in the distance.
PHANTOM VOICES
Over at the Frankenstein place.
BRAD stares hard.
BRAD
There's a light.
The castle looms closer.
PHANTOM VOICES
Burning in the fireplace.
JANET
(looks to Brad)
There's a light, a light
In the darkness of everybody's life
Taking JANET by the hand, BRAD moves off the roadway towards the house.
BRAD
I can see the flag fly
I can see the rain
Just the same
There has got to be
Something better here
For you and me.
Lighting strikes.
JANET jumps towards BRAD.
BRAD & JANET
There's a light.
The castle seems to move forward.
PHANTOM VOICES
Burning in the fireplace.
BRAD
There's a light.
CUT TO
A motorcycle convoy roars by revealing a hidden road to the castle.
BRAD
A light
In the darkness of everybody's life.
The convoy drives up and disappears into a secret entrance in the rock.
CUT TO
We see a cell-like window near a massive lighted window.
A tortured
face appears squinting into the darkness.
RIFF RAFF
The darkness must go
Down the river of nights dreaming
Flow morphia slow
Let the sun and light come streaming
Into my life.
CUT TO
Lightning strikes.
CUT TO
28	CASTLE FACADE	NIGHT
RIFF RAFF moves to the lighted window where his hunchbacked shape
becomes a giant shadow.
RIFF RAFF
Into my life.
CUT TO
BRAD and JANET start moving down the driveway.
BRAD & JANET
There's a light.
CUT TO
30	CASTLE FACADE	NIGHT
Shadow turns in the window.
PHANTOM VOICES
Over at the Frankenstein place.
CUT TO
BRAD and JANET approach the gateway to the castle.
BRAD & JANET
There's a light.
CUT TO
32	CASTLE FACADE	NIGHT
The shadow slowly covers the whole window.
PHANTOM VOICES
Burning in the fireplace.
CUT TO
PHANTOM VOICES
There's a light, a light.
BRAD and JANET are at the gate.
There is a rusted sign.
BRAD & JANET
In the darkness of everybody's life.
A bolt of lighting illuminates the sign which reads:
FRANK N. FURTER -
SCIENTIST.
WIPE TO
BRAD rings the doorbell.
It makes a strange sound.
JANET
Oh, Brad.
Let's go back.
I'm cold
and I'm frightened.
BRAD
Just a moment, Janet.
They may have
a telephone.
The door opens.
Throbbing music is heard in the background as if there
is a party going on in the distance.
The figure we have seen at the window emerges.
He is a hunch-backed
servant, RIFF RAFF.
RIFF RAFF
Hello.
BRAD
Uh - oh - Hi!
My name is Brad Majors.
And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.
I -
ah - wondered if you could help us.
Our
car has broken down about two miles up the
road.
Do you have a phone we might use?
RIFF RAFF
You're wet.
JANET
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
BRAD
Yes.
RIFF RAFF
Yes.
A bolt of lighting illuminates a row of vehicles parked by the castle.
BRAD sees them and reacts with surprise.
RIFF RAFF realises BRAD has seen them.
RIFF RAFF
I think you had better both come inside.
JANET
You're too kind.
They enter apprehensively.
DISSOLVE
A shot of pack of huge alsations careereing around the castle grounds.
They are chasing a bewildered Rocky.
WIPE TO.
We see DR SCOTT's wheelchair screaming through corridors, rooms and
doors and ends up clamped to the electro magnet in the laboratory.
CUT TO
There is a huge explosion.
We see the entire castle surrounded by a giant beam of light and then
vanish into space.
During the explosion sequence the film reverts optically to black and
white.
DISSOLVE TO
SONG:		"SUPER-HEROES"
BRAD, JANET, and DR SCOTT's bodies are scattered on three sides
surrounding a crater where the castle once was.
The scene is arid and deserted.
There are remnants of DR SCOTT's
wheelchair, EDDIE's coffin and broken objects from the laboratory.
BRAD, tattered and bleeding, lifts himself up.
BRAD
I've done a lot
God knows I've tried
To find the truth I've even lied
But all I know is down inside.
DR SCOTT drags himself to his knees.
BRAD & DR SCOTT
I'm bleeding.
JANET
(revives)
And super heroes
Come to feast
To taste the flesh
Not yet deceased
And al I know
Is still the beast
TRIO
Is feeding.
The three of them stand shakily on the perimeter of the crater.
All that is left is dust and sand and wind and the sun.
The CAMERA PANS from face to face in a circular movement getting faster
and faster as the trio sing a chorale of hopelessness.
