      GRACE sleeping.  A picture of innocence.  Like something out 
    of a children s book.  When-- plink.  A computer sound.  
      Grace s eyes open.  Early morning.  She glances toward...

      ...her desktop.  A blinking g-mail sign.  She goes to it, 
      hits a computer key.  Her newest e-mail subject line reads...  
       Web Alert for: news on Peter Florrick. 

      Okay, Grace clicks on the e-mail, blase, nothing surprising 
      about this, when-- plink-- it opens, overflowing with links.  
      Hundreds of them.  No, more.  

      Uh-oh, Grace pauses, not what she expected.  She hits the 
      scroll button, and the page goes on and on and... on.  
      Concerned now, she stops scrolling, reads one random link... 
       Florrick wanted Threesome Insists Amber. Grace stares at 
    it, as...


      ...ZACH, dressing, getting his homework together, keeps one 
    eye on his computer playing  Chelsea Lately  with CHELSEA 
      interviewing AMBER MADISON (28), high class call girl, sexy, 
      young, loving the attention.    

                                  CHELSEA HANDLER
                    So this D.A., didhe--?

                                  CHELSEA HANDLER
                    Right, so did this D.A. suckyour 
                    toes all the time or was this just 
                    a one-time thing? 

      A laughing, encouraging audience.  Amber laughs too.

                                  AMBER
                    Well, a... two-time thing. 

                                  CHELSEA HANDLER
                    Of course, because you do a

                    Yeah, when I finish it.

                    you to do?  The most disgusting?  
                    Come on, not just routine 
                      disgusting.  Really disgusting.

                      disgusting, but he-- 

    The screen freezes--  Rebuffering. Zach sighs, waits, as a 
      computer gear icon turns.  A yell comes from off:

                                  ALICIA (O.S.)
                    Kids!  Breakfast!


      Zach and Grace stand at the butcher block, eyeing a very 
      happy ALICIA doling out food:

                                  ALICIA
                    This is a new thing I found at the 
                    market.  It s called fruit.  I 
                    thought we d give it a try this 
                    morning.

      Zach and Grace trade a look.  Both surprisingly quiet.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    And how is school?

                                  ZACH
                    Good.

                                  GRACE
                    You re really happy this morning.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, I ve started drinking earlier.  
                    Work is going well.  I feel like 
                    I ve turned some kind of corner.  

      Zach and Grace trade a look.  Alicia notices the look:

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Something is going on here?  

      Zach looks at Grace-- which way to go with this?  

                                  GRACE
                    We just have to get to school.

                                  ZACH

                    Miss Poole.  He s not in court.  I 
                    put him in the jury room. 


    The jury room.  More refined than  12 Angry Men .  Kya thanks 
    the Bailiff as he lets her in.  She finds a tense PETER and 
      DANIEL GOLDEN.  She offers:

                                  KYA
                    I don t think we ll need damage 
                    control.  It s just gossip page 
                    fodder.  I m not getting political 
                    calls. 

    But Peter turns away and we see he s waiting on a cellphone.  
    Out of ear shot.  Kya nods toward him...

                    I had a married client who had a 
                    girlfriend who wouldn t go away, 
                    kept making trouble at inopportune 
                    times.  We offered her money, a 
                    singing contract, everything.  It 
                    turns out she wanted something we 
                    couldn t offer.  Our client.  She 
                    was in love, and she was bitter.  Is 
                    that a... possibility here?

                                  GOLDEN
                    Why don t you ask him.  

      A bit of spikinessfrom Golden.  Tension between these two?  
      Peter finally gets somebody on the line:

                                  PETER
                    This is her husband.  Have her 
                    phone me as quickly as possible.  

      Peter hangs up, upset.  Hands the cell back to Golden.  It 
      surprises Kya.  She hasn t seen this level of concern before.   

                                  KYA
                    Are you okay?

                                  PETER

                    Good.  The genuine is important 
                    right now.  You need--

                    touch with my wife, I think you *

    Kya nods, quickly gets on her cell, dialing, as...


      ...a smiling Alicia starts toward her office, feels her 
      cellphone buzz, takes it out, checks the number:  Unknown 
      Caller.   No, she puts it away again, passes her assistant s 
      desk, COURTNEY.

                                  COURTNEY
                    Your husband phoned.

                                  ALICIA
                    My--?  Did he say what it was 
                    about?

      Courtney pauses only a second, clearly up-to-date on the 
      newest Amber business, but sees Alicia is not.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      5.

                    No, but I think he thought you d 
                    know what it was about.

      Alicia nods, continues toward her office as Courtney follows.


                                  COURTNEY
                    And someone from Page Six.  He 
                    phoned wanting comment. 

                                  ALICIA
                    On?

                                  COURTNEY
                          (still circumspect)
                    He didn t say.  I don t think it 
                    was about a case.

      Alicia looks up, sees she knows something.  CARY calls from 
    his office:

                                  CARY
                    Courtney.  Do you have a minute?

      Courtney pauses there, still staring at Alicia.

                                  ALICIA
                    What s going on?

                                  CARY
                    Courtney.

      Courtney considers it, raises a finger toward Cary: one 
      second.  She enters Alicia s office, closes the door, crosses 
    to her laptop, quickly hits some keys, and...


      ...time cut-- Courtney is back at her desk.  Looking in at 
      Alicia in her fishbowl, watching her computer.  Trying not to 
      look, but looking.  She sees Alicia visibly affected.  Pale.  
    As an impatient Cary comes up to her desk...

                                  CARY
                    Courtney, I needed you 5 minutes ago.

                                  COURTNEY
                    Yes, sorry.

    He follows her gaze to Alicia.  Realizes...

                                  CARY
                    Oh, is that about all that crap?

                                  CARY
                    Tell her not to worry.  It s old 
                    news.  No one cares about it 
                    anymore. 

                                  COURTNEY
                    I think she does.  


      Alicia stares at her computer screen again, watching the 
       Chelsea Lately  footage...

                                  CHELSEA HANDLER
                    See, now we re getting to a 
                      comfortable place.  So what kind of

                    after one ring, then he d know the 
                    next call was from me...

      Alicia stares at the screen.  Can t drag her eyes from it.  A 
      nightmare returned.

                                  CHELSEA HANDLER
                    Aren t you a call girl?  That s 
                    like something a 14-year-oldwould 
                    do? So about this threesome...

    The audience laughs at Chelsea steering it back...

                                  AMBER
                    It was nothing.  He just said 
                    that s why he came to me in the 
                    first place; his wife wouldn t 
                    agree to a threesome.  I think he 
                    thought she was a bit...

                                  CHELSEA HANDLER
                    Frigid?  Come on, say it, that s the 
                    word.  Hey, I think she looked it.

      Laughter.  Alicia s eyes close for a second.  She sees 
      Courtney outside signaling to her, pointing to a phone.

      Alicia stands, swallows the depth of emotion she s feeling 
      right now and starts out.  We follow her toward... 


      ...the stairs.  She sees two PARALEGALS laughing, then 
      shooting a look toward her.  Then a LAWYER nodding as he 
      passes.  Something in the nod?  Alicia isn t sure.  This 
      could just be the way people act.  She continues up the 
      stairs, and...


      ...edges toward Diane s office, the door open...

      Will waves Alicia over so she can see the monitor.  A news

      A street scene.  A wrecked car, rammed into a lightpost.

                    Jonas Stern first gained notoriety 
                    crusading against police brutality 
                    in the 1970 s, and catapulted to

                    of constitutional freedoms.  But he

    The modern art on the wall.  He reaches up, takes it down.


      Stern has two more paintings in his hand as he starts down 
    the hall, a trail of lawyers and partners behind him.

                                        ACT ONE


    An uncomfortable Zach and Grace staring at their mom.

                                  ALICIA
                    This will only take a minute.

                                  ZACH
                    It s okay, mom, really.

                                  GRACE
                    No one s saying anything.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Then listen for my sake.  I want 
                    you to know what s true and what s 
                    not.  I don t know what your dad 
                    said to this woman, but I doknow 
                    what I said to your dad.  And none 
                    of this is true.  

      Zach and Grace trade a look, truly uncomfortable.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    I can t stop her from saying what 
                    she s saying, but I can always tell 
                    you the truth.

      Zach and Grace nod: actually that s not bad.

                                  ZACH
                    Thanks, mom.

                                  GRACE
                    What does dad say is true?

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t know.

                                  GRACE
                    He hasn t talked to you?

                                  ALICIA
                    He... 
                          (trying to be honest)
                    He s tried to, but I... I haven t 
                    returned his call.  

                                  ZACH
                          (very interested)
                    Why?

                                  ALICIA
                    I-- I don t know.  I ve been angry.

                    But if it s untrue.

                                  GRACE
                    It s still true that he slept with 
                    her.

                                  ZACH
                    But Dad s already apologized for 
                    that.  

                                  GRACE
                    It doesn t make it any less wrong.

                          (enough of this)
                    Okay, look, I will admit to being 
                    inconsistent here.  I will talk to 
                    your dad.

                                  ZACH
                    Maybe we should talk to him.  Ask 
                    him everything.

                                  GRACE
                    What?  If he had a three-way?

                                  ALICIA
                    Okay-- okay--

                                  ZACH
                    It s not a three-way; it s a 
                      threesome--

                                  GRACE
                    Yeah, but you can say three-way--

      Bang-- we slam through doors entering a courtroom.  Smaller, 
      more pedestrian.  DEFENDANTS, some in prison jumpsuits, await 
      hearings.  As we find in the front gallery row Stern staring 
    at Alicia sorting nervously through paperwork...

                                  STERN
                    It s a plea, that s all.  

      Alicia nods, continues to sort through the paperwork until 
      Stern reaches over, takes it.  Takes her briefcase.  Crams 
    the papers in.  Fastens the briefcase again.  Looks at her.

                                  STERN (CONT D)
                    You ll be fine, Mrs. Florrick.  I ll 
                    tell you exactly what to say.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Can you just tell me now?

                                  STERN
                    Nope, the best arguments are 
                    spontaneous.  Know who told me that?

                                  ALICIA
                    Justice Powell-- the oral arguments 
                    for Ricardo vs. Ohio?
                          (off Stern s look)
                    I did my law review on Ricardo.  

                                  STERN
                    I was brilliant on Ricardo, wasn t I?

                                  ALICIA
                    You were.

                                  STERN
                    It s harder to be great these days.  
                    Fewer opportunities.

      Alicia smiles as Stern studies her.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, thank you.

      Stern grins.  Likes that.  

                                  STERN
                    The first time a DUI has trumped a 
                    threesome.  Your husband said some 
                    mean things about me:  a scourge on 
                    the legal profession.    A 
                    throwback to 60s radicalism.   I 
                    think it got him elected twice.  

                                  ALICIA
                    It wasn t bad for you either.   

                                  STERN
                    I still cried into my pillow at night.

      Alicia smiles, looks up, sees Deputy States Attorney MATAN 
      BRODY making his way to the bench.  

                                  STERN (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  ALICIA
                    The Deputy States Attorney.  What s 
                    he doing down here?

      Stern watches as Matan approaches JUDGE FRANKLIN YEE (40s, 
      wooden as a deck chair), finishing up a case.

                                  MATAN
                    Your Honor, Matan Brody for the 
                    State s Attorney s Office.

                                  JUDGE YEE
                          (surprised)
                    Mr. Stern, you may want in on this. 

                                  MATAN
                    The People have added a charge to

                                  STERN
                    That s ridiculous-- you re tacking 
                    it on as payback.   


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      19.

                                  MATAN
                    Mr. Stern, are you representing 
                    yourself here?

      Stern shoots a look toward Alicia who jumps in:

                                  ALICIA
                    Your honor, this is payback.  It s 
                    clearly unorthodox, clearly--

                                  STERN
                          (quietly feeding)

                                  ALICIA
                          (she was going there)
                      --selective prosecution in direct--

                    --contradiction of the 14th amendment--

                                  ALICIA
                          (talking over him)
                    --of the 14th Amendment right

                                  MATAN
                    You hit a cop, Mr. Stern.  You 
                    can t hit a cop.

                                  ALICIA
                    Speak to me, not my client, sir--

    But it sounds weak as Matan continues with the Judge:

                                  MATAN
                    Aggravated Battery is a felony, 
                    your honor, carrying a prison term 
                    of two to five years.  As such, 
                    both this charge and the DUI now 
                    have to be heard in felony court.

                                  JUDGE YEE
                    That s too bad, Mr. Stern.  I was 
                    looking forward to this.  Next.

      A gavel bang.  Alicia shoots a look toward Stern.  Oh shit.

    The discovery packet from the prosecutor s office.  It sits 
    on Stern s desk.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      20.

    His office is grand, eccentric, yet not unstylish.  This is 
      someone with an eye, or someone whose third wife has an eye.  
      Stern enters, reaches for his jeans folded over a chair...

                                  STERN
                    Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.  I can 
                    take it from here.

      Alicia nods, starts to go, pauses at the door...

                                  ALICIA
                    Is that the discovery packet?

                                  STERN
                    It is.   

      Alicia nods, clearly still dismissed.  And yet she pauses, 
      sees Stern is starting to take off his suit pants, put on his 
      jeans.  Oy.  Alicia turns away slightly.

                                  ALICIA
                    Sir, if I m representing you, I 
                    think I should look at the 
                    discovery too.

      Stern doesn t reply, still changing, yelling out:

                                  STERN
                    Brenda, dinner at Gibson s.

                                  BRENDA (O.S.)
                    Got it.

      Alicia still feels like she shouldn t go as Stern sits down 
    at the desk, starts looking at the packet.  

                                  ALICIA 
                    Mr. Stern, I heard you speak at 
                    Georgetown once.  You said even the 
                    best legal mind requires the Socratic 
                    method to keep itself sharp.  So... 
                    here I am.

      Stern reads, doesn t look up.  Alicia starts to turn to go when 
      Stern reaches a hand out, slides half the packet across his desk 
      toward her.  Nothing sentimental about it.  All in silence.  
      Alicia nods, goes to the chair across the desk, starts to read.


      A legal pad in front of Alicia.  She takes notes:

                                  ALICIA
                    So you had a few drinks at the 
                    party beforethe accident--?

                                  ALICIA
                    Because after the accident, you had 
                    a few more.

                                  STERN
                    That s perfectly legal.

      Alicia picks up a document: the results of the breathalyzer.

                    You blew a .15 on the breathalyzer 
                    at the police station: that s 
                    almost twice the legal limit.  
                    They re going to argue--

                                  STERN
                     --three drinks wouldn t be enough 
                    to get me there.   And you argue 
                    traumatic experience-- I was in an 
                    accident.  That can increase the 
                    effects of alcohol dramatically. 

                                  ALICIA
                    And the battery against the officer?

                                  STERN
                    There s no mention in the police 
                    report--

                                  ALICIA
                          (reads)
                     At this point suspect became 
                    highly agitated and abusive... 

                                  STERN
                    And in a police state, yes, that 
                    might be considered battery.  
                          (a new thought)
                    Police cars have video cameras on 
                    their dash.  Recordings are saved up 
                    to six days.  Subpoena the recordings 
                    before they can erase them.   

      Alicia nods, writes it down.

                    And get the dispatch tape.  Ten to 
                    one my name s on it.  They knew it 
                    was my car-- they couldn t wait to 
                    arrest me-- 
                          (looks off)
                    Let the plotting begin.  

      Alicia follows Stern s gaze to a parade of PARTNERS emerging 
      from a meeting.  Will, Diane, a dozen equity partners.  Will 
      sees Cary passing by, stops to speak with him...

                    We re concerned a disgruntled client 
                    might sue us for malpractice, on the 
                    theory he had a drinking problem...

                                  CARY
                    You want me to go over Stern s cases?

                                  WILL
                    Just for the last two years. 

      Cary nods, seeing where Will s going with this-- 

                                  CARY
                    I ll get on it.
                          (before Will can leave)
                    Mr. Gardner... I just want to say: 
                    thanks for the opportunity.  It s 
                    important for me to show you what I 
                    can do.

                                  WILL
                    Okay.   

    And Cary starts off.  Will smiles.  He was probably that way 
    in his first few months.  As he starts to move off...


    We move down the quiet hallway of Alicia s apartment, pushing 
    in on Zach s door.  It s closed.  And...


      ...we re inside now.  Zach sitting on the floor, reading a 
      library book, studying.  Two book bags on his bed.  One 
      masculine, one feminine.

                                  BECCA
                    Here it is.  Look.

      Sitting at Zach s computer is BECCA (16), an older classmate: 
      pretty, fast-talking, edgy, knowing.  She dresses like a good 
      girl-- and easily cons adults into thinking she s a good 
      girl - but she s an interesting mix of alternative rock, 
      cheerleading, and Suicide Girls.  She s not a villain.

                                  ZACH
                    I thought we were studying Martin 
                    Luther King.

                                  BECCA
                    Youwere studying Martin Luther 
                    King.  See, there s your mother.

      A graph of some kind on the screen.  A poll.

                                  ZACH
                    I don t get it.

                                  BECCA
                    It s a web site you can bet on.  You 
                    know, celebrity stuff--  What Disney 
                    star will die first?  Things like 
                    that.

                                  ZACH
                    They re betting on my mom?

                                  BECCA
                    If she ll get a divorce.

                                  ZACH
                    That s... awful.

      Becca laughs, likes Zach, thinks he s impossibly innocent.

                                  BECCA
                    So, what should I bet?

                                  ZACH
                    You wanna know whether they re 
                    gonna divorce?

                                  BECCA
                    Yeah, it s like insider information.  
                    Like having somebody inside Exxon.  
                    See--
                          (pointing at the screen)
                    --after this threesome thing, the 
                    betting is moving 75%  for  
                    divorce.  And I got $50.  So?

      Zach studies Becca.  Intimidated by her, and yet she s pretty 
      great just sitting there.

                                  ZACH
                    She s not gonna divorce.

                                  BECCA
                    You re sure?

                                  ZACH
                    I m sure.

      Becca types on his computer while talking:

                                  BECCA
                    So is it true, your dad asked her 
                    for a threesome?



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      24.

                          (that s crazy)
                    No.  

                                  BECCA
                    But they wouldn t tell you if he 
                    did, right?    

      Zach considers it, shrugs.  Becca turns in Zach s chair 
      toward him sitting on the bed.

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                     Cuz I think it s pretty cool.  Did 
                    you hear what she said to Howard 
                    Stern?

                                  ZACH
                    Who? 

                                  BECCA
                    Your dad s hooker.  She said they 
                    had sex in your bed.

                                  ZACH
                    She did not!

                                  BECCA
                    She did!  That s what somebody said 
                    in Chemistry.  Just think about 
                    it... right there.

    The bed.  Becca stares at it, then at him.  Quiet for a second.  

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    That bed.    

    She puts her feet up on it.  Her left foot on one side of Zach.  
      Then...  after a second, her right foot the other side of Zach.  

                                  BECCA (CONT D)
                    Pretty cool.  

                                  ZACH
                    This isn t the same bed.  I had a 
                    different one.

      Zach finds his heart beating.  Very fast.  Face blushing.  
      Becca just keeps smiling at him.

                                  BECCA
                    So you re what, fourteen? 

                                  ZACH
                    Yeah.

                    I m sixteen.

      Zach nods: he knows.  Becca looks toward the bedroom door.  
      Closed.  Zach looks toward it too.  Intimidated, but...

                                  JACKIE (O.S.)
                    I m back, kids.  Hello.

      Shit.  Zach jumps up from the bed, shoves Becca s foot aside, 
      goes to the door, opens it, as Becca doesn t move, eyes him, 
      loves his nervousness.

                                  ZACH
                    I d better... help my grandma.

    He winces.  Sounds like he s eight.  Becca smiles, reaches 
      into her bookbag.

                                  BECCA
                    I m gonna give you something.  If 
                    you re having problems with your 
                    parents, and you want something-- 
                    some space, a car-- play this.

      A CD.  Becca pops open his stereo, pops it in.

                                  ZACH
                    What is it, rap?

                                  BECCA
                    Better.  It makes parents do 
                    whatever you want.  You need a 
                    little rebellion in your life.  

    And with that, Becca grabs her backpack, starts out the door, 
      passing...


      ...JACKIE in the kitchen, unloading groceries.  Becca puts on 
    her best good girl smile...

                                  BECCA
                    Nice to meet you, Mrs. Florrick.  
                    Zachary and I were just studying.

      Jackie looks up, startled.  But Becca is already out the front 
      door.  Jackie stands there with her mouth open, carton of milk 
    in her hand.  She looks toward Zach s closed door, and hears...

      ...an Islamic call to prayer start up.  The Adhan.  Jackie 
      turns to the sound, appalled.

      A DVD is dropped onto Alicia s desk by Kalinda.

                                  KALINDA
                    The video from the dashboard camera.

                                  ALICIA
                    Thanks.  Good or bad?

                                  KALINDA
                    You should watch.  So is Stern 
                    still treating you like a puppet?

                                  ALICIA

      Kalinda smiles when-- knock-knock-- Courtney at the door...

                                  COURTNEY
                    Alicia, it s...

                    Who?

                                  COURTNEY
                    Amber Madison.  

      Alicia pauses, startled at the name.  Kalinda turns to 
      Alicia: what the fuck?

                                  COURTNEY (CONT D)
                    She says she-- she has a question 
                    for you.

                                  ALICIA
                    Take a message.

      Courtney nods, leaves.  Kalinda eyes Alicia.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Why s she phoning?

                                  ALICIA
                    I don t know.  She s trying to cause a 
                    scene.  For attention.  I don t know...    

      Alicia shrugs, at wit s end.  Kalinda eyes her, takes a 
      second.  Goes to Alicia s door.  Closes it.

                                  KALINDA
                    Want me to talk to her?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      27.

      Alicia looks up at Kalinda...

                                  ALICIA
                    Talk to her?
                          (Kalinda nods)
                    What would that... entail?

                                  KALINDA
                    Talk.  

      Alicia eyes Kalinda.  Kalinda s eyes firm.

                                  ALICIA
                    No, I m fine.  Really.  

                                  KALINDA
                    Contact me if that changes.

                                  ALICIA
                    Okay.

      Kalinda nods, leaves.  Alicia watches her go, looks down at 
    the DVD, and...


      ...the video now plays on a monitor, grainy in that police

                    Sir, you need to calm down.  Don t 
                    make me put the cuffs back on you--

                                  STERN (ON SCREEN)
                    Dammit, let go of me--

    The Cop tries to cuff him, but Stern takes a wild swing, 
      landing a glancing blow on the officer s shoulder, as... 

      ...Alicia sighs, watching, looks over at Stern, confident as 
      always.  Both are at the defense table.  Mid-hearing.  She 
      leans over, whispers:

                                  ALICIA
                    Why did wesubpoena this again?

                    Don t worry about it.

    But Alicia eyes him, definitely worrying, as Matan stops the 
      video, turns to the cop, on the stand: OFFICER NEIL SUTTON.  
      30 s, soft-spoken, quietly competent.

                    Is this an accurate depiction of 
                    the events, Officer Sutton?

                                  MATAN
                    Your Honor, as you can see the 
                    video is clearly relevant--

                                  ALICIA
                    It may be relevant, but it s 
                      unnecessary when they have the 
                    Officer s testimony.  And given...  

      Alicia hesitates, distracted by the fact that JUDGE CARMELLA 
      ROMANO doesn t seem to be paying attention, jotting something 
      down with a pencil.  Taking notes?  Sketching?  

                                  JUDGE ROMANO
                    Yes, Ms. Florrick?

                                  STERN
                    Given the Illinois Supreme Court--

      Alicia frowns, irritated by Stern s help behind her...

                                  ALICIA
                    The Illinois Court s ruling in 
                    People vs. Harriman, we believe--

                    Yes, your Honor, it was.

                                  JUDGE ROMANO
                    That case dealt with a video from 
                    an outside source.  This is video 
                    from the officer s dashboard--

                                  STERN
                    We would argue the underlying 
                    principle is the same, your Honor--

      Alicia stares: who s litigating this case, anyway? 

                                  JUDGE ROMANO
                    That might work with the Illinois 
                    Supreme Court, Mr. Stern, but not 
                    here.  Anything else?  

      With no answer, she nods--

                    lunch.

    All rise as Judge Romano exits the bench.  Stern turns to 
      Alicia, annoyed, whispering:

                                  STERN
                    What was that?  You re hesitating.

    And Stern starts out.  Alicia watches him go, frustrated.

      Alicia, still frustrated, waits in the jury room.  Just her 
    and Kya.  Kya smiles.  Alicia offers a smile back.

      Jackie.  She stands in the hall.  Staring at Zach s door.  
      Closed.  She looks behind her.  The apartment empty.  She 
      reaches for the knob, opens the door.


      Jackie looks at the room.  A normal kid s room.  She exits.  
      Comes back with a laundry hamper.  Clearly an excuse.  She 
      puts it on the bed.  Grabs a few pieces of Zach s clothing, 
      throws it in.  Looks toward...

      ...his side table.  Goes to it.  Opens the drawer.  Homework 
      inside.   A  on a test on top.  She flips to the next one.  
       A.   Another  A-   Jackie smiles-- what a good kid.  What am 
      I doing?  She flips one more and finds...

      ...a health pamphlet.   You and Your Sexuality.   Jackie 
      stares at it.  Takes it.  Reaches for his garbage pail.  
      Drops it in.  Checks his...

      ...other drawers.  Pulling one out after another.  Homework.  
      Papers.  Nothing much more.  She crosses toward the door with 
    the pail when she pauses, sees...

      ...a manila envelope peering out from under one of the 
      paintings.  She studies it.  Reaches out.  Peels the large 
      manila envelope and its masking tape from behind the painting.  

      Clearly some kind of secret stash.

    She opens the envelope.  Pulls out... PHOTOS.  A naked woman.  
      Jackie frowns when she...

      ...pauses.  Sees the man she s with.  It s her son.  Peter.  
    She gasps, startled.  Jackie pauses for a second.  Her mind 
      grinding.  No idea how this could get here.  She reaches 
      deeper into the envelope, pulls out...

      ...a DVD too.  Studies it.  She grabs her pail.  Drops the 
      whole lot in.  The photos.  The DVD.  And...  THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      32.




      ...Jackie goes to a garbage chute in the building lobby.  
      Opens it.  Pauses a second over the photos, the DVD, and...

      ...dumps it all into the chute.  Gone.  Feels better already 
    as she starts away from the chute.

      Flipping through photos from the cop dashboard video.

    She stops on a photo of: Officer Sutton, reaching out to cuff 
      Stern.  She studies it.  Stares closer.  Considering.  As...

      Stern rises, along with everyone else.  Judge Romano taking 
    the bench.  Officer Sutton already back on the stand.  

      Alicia stands, a growing determination on her face.  She

                    cause-- the mere fact that there 
                    was an accident doesn t mean a 
                    crime had been committed.  So 
                    everything that follows is tainted-- 
                    the sobriety tests, the video.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      34.

      Silence.  Stern peers up, seeing Judge Romano considering it, 
      seriously.  Matan sees this too, and jumps up... 

                                  MATAN
                    Your Honor, the video captures the 
                    commission of a subsequent crime-- 
                    a battery upon a police officer.  

                                  STERN
                    Yes, except it--

                                  ALICIA
                    Mr. Stern, please sit down.

      Stern turns to Alicia, her authoritative tone.  He nods, 
      sits.  Alicia now in control...

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Except it occurred during the  
                    sobriety tests.  If the sobriety 
                    tests are disqualified, the video 
                    must be disqualified.  

      Judge Romano considers it for a moment.  Then:

                                  JUDGE ROMANO
                    Motion granted.  The video is 
                    hereby excluded. 
                          (before Matan can jump up)
                    I ll save you the time, Mr. 
                    Brody...  No.  We re adjourned 
                    until tomorrow.

    She rises from the bench.  As Alicia begins to gather her 
      things, Stern turns to her, a whole different tone now.

                                  STERN
                    Well, well, the best arguments 
                    really do sound spontaneous.

      Stern stares at her.  Smiles.

    And he starts off.  Alicia pauses, not sure if that was yes 
    or no.

      Photos of Stern s car rammed into a light post.  Alicia 
      studies them, sitting alone doing her paperwork at the dining 
      room table, dinner over.  Jackie sits down across from her.  
      Waits.  Alicia looks up at her: yes?

                                  JACKIE
                    I think you should take the kids to 
                    church more.

      Alicia just stares at Jackie: never sure what s going to pop 
    out of her mouth next.

                                  ALICIA
                      Because...?  

                                  JACKIE
                    Zach s listening to Muslim music.
                          (Alicia stares at her, smiles)
                    I m serious.  His girlfriend is 
                    Muslim.

      Alicia looks up: news to her.   

                                  ALICIA
                    His girlfriend?  Zach s girlfriend?

                                  JACKIE
                    Yes.  They were here yesterday in his 
                    room.  And they were playing that music.

                                  ALICIA
                    Where were you?

                                  JACKIE
                          (don t blame me)
                    I was out getting groceries.

      Alicia stares at her.  Gets up.


      Zach surfs a web site.   Will the Florricks divorce this 
      year? Below it:  Yes-- 63.5%  No-- 36.5%. When...

                                  ALICIA
                    You have a girlfriend?

      Alicia opening his bedroom door.  Zach turns off his computer.

                                  ZACH
                    No.

                                  ALICIA

      Grace shouting from the other room.  Zach shouts back:

                    You re right.

      Alicia goes over to the computer, unplugs it.  Unplugs the 
      separate screen.  As Zach watches stunned...

                                  ZACH
                    Mom?!  Mom, what are you doing?

      Alicia clears some space on the desk in the living room...

                    But, Mom-- I--

                    you re eighteen.  Here.  

      Zach frowns, watches as Alicia sets the computer on the desk.  
      Jackie watches from the kitchen.

                                  ZACH
                    This is--!  Nothing happened.

                                  ALICIA

                    Zach.  You are fourteen years old.  You 
                    are a freshman in high school.  A junior 
                    was in your room yesterday with the door 
                    closed.  This is called parenting.  
                    That s all.  Now go get the printer.

                                  ZACH
                    No, you trusted dad.  And he did 
                    that.  And now you think I m going to 
                    do the same.

      Alicia studies Zach.

                                  ALICIA
                    I love you, Zach.  I love you and 
                    Grace so much.  But your computer 
                    is staying here.

      Zach stares at her.  Goes to his room.  And slams the door.  
      Alicia sighs.  Sees Jackie.  And... Jackie meets Alicia s 
      eye.  Approving, connecting.  The unspoken understanding of 
      parents.  After a second...

      ...music starts up in Zach s room.  The Islamic call to 
      prayer.  Alicia sighs.  Here we go.  Teenaged rebellion.    THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      38.




    On the stand: RUSSELL TOLLIVER.  45, well-dressed, snobbish air.

                                  MATAN
                    How long did you stay at the

                                  TOLLIVER
                    About two hours.  I left around 10 
                    p.m., just after Mr. Stern left.

                                  MATAN
                    And can you tell us what you 
                    witnessed in that time?

                                  TOLLIVER
                    I saw Mr. Stern consume at least 
                    six drinks-- 

                                  MATAN
                    Six?  What kind of drinks-- are we 
                    talking white wine spritzers here?

                                  TOLLIVER
                    Scotch.  Neat.

      Alicia and Stern sitting side-by-side.  Not thrilled.  She 
      leans toward him, whispers:

                                  ALICIA
                    Do you know him?

      Stern shrugs, but stares, isn t sure.  And...

                    Because I drank afterthe accident.  

      A sexy assistant, BRENDA, knocks on the door, peers in:

                    Jonas, I checked on your case work.

      Stern looks at Brenda.  Then gets it.  Starts out of the office.


      Furious, Stern lays into Will and Diane--

                    of these things--

                                  DIANE
                    Oh, come on, Will.

                                  WILL
                    What?  You certainly don t seem 
                    inclined to do it!

                                  DIANE
                    You know, you talk a good game about 
                      liability-- but we both know it s 
                    about control.  Jonas votes with me 
                    90% of the time.  You push him out--

                                  STERN
                    Both of you, honestly-- you call 
                    yourselves lawyers?  I was winning cases 
                    when you were still in little league! 
                          (to Diane)
                    And you-- my  proteg .   The only reason 
                    I hired you is because it looked good to 
                    have a woman in the office.  

      Diane s stung, but holds her tongue, as Jonas rails on:

                                  STERN (CONT D)
                    You two, you treat the practice of law 
                    like used cars!  Well, you
                    try to get rid of me, it ll cost you 
                    every cent of that golden parachute, 
                    and that s aftera lawsuit!  I will 
                    bankrupt this firm before I let you 
                    push me out!

    And with that, he storms out, passing Alicia.

      Empty except for two men at the defense table, waiting.  
      Golden and Peter.  Golden nervous.  Peter not.  Determined.  
      A Bailiff in the background, out of earshot.  The gallery

      Amber stares at them, appalled.  A 180 degree turn.

      Golden was about to interrupt, decides to let it go.  Shoots a 
      look toward the Bailiff, but he s clearly out of earshot.  Amber 
      stands, rattled, backs up, starts out of court.  Golden exhales, 
      reaches over, offers Peter a comforting squeeze of the arm.  THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      43.




      Alicia rounds a corner... finds Stern seated, staring into 
      space.  She approaches, sits.  He looks at her, sheepishly.

                                  STERN
                    I suppose you heard that tirade 
                    back there.  I imagine people on 
                    Lakeshore Avenue heard it.

      Alicia nods.  Stern says nothing, just stares ahead.  

                                  ALICIA
                    We d better go in.

                          (confused)
                    Yes, Tolliver Industries?

      Stern looks at her blankly.  Nods.   

                                  STERN
                    Oh, right, Tolliver Industries.  I 
                    sued them once.  Civil rights 
                      violations.  We should use that.

      Alicia stares at him.  Something off there...


      Tolliver back on the stand.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Mr. Stern won an eight million dollar 
                    judgement against your family.  So 
                    you have reason to hold a grudge?

                    Mr. Tolliver, you testified you

                    Then please explain this.

    She hands a photo to Matan and another to the Judge--

                    Your Honor, this literally just 
                    came to my attention.

      Tolliver stares nervously at the photo-- it s him blowing 
      through a red light in a Porsche 911.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)

                    10 p.m. if you were running a red 
                    light four miles away at 9:48?

      Tolliver is speechless.  Alicia looks to Stern, but sees he s 
    not even paying attention.  Staring off.  What s going on?    THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      45.

                    Yep.

      Kalinda at her door.

      Through the door, we see Brenda get up from her desk and move 
      off.  As soon as she s out of sight, Kalinda moves past 
      Brenda s empty desk and enters the office.

    She closes the door behind her, crosses calmly toward Stern s 
      briefcase, on the floor by his desk.  She lays it on the 
      desk, tries the clasp.  Locked.  She takes a lock-pick kit 
      from her pocket.  Selects the proper pick, clenches it in her 
      lips as she puts the kit away, kneels on the floor in front 
    of the desk, looks toward...

      ...the door.  No one there.  She quickly picks the lock.  Stands.  
      Opens the briefcase.  Finds a pill bottle inside.  Checks the 
      label, takes out her cellphone, snaps a picture of it, and...

      Alicia takes a second.

                      I understand.

                                        ACT FOUR


      Early morning.  Alicia and Kalinda, laptops open, files 
      spread out.  Alicia s been working for a while, and it shows.

                                  KALINDA
                    Attack the breathalyzer test--

                                  ALICIA
                    It s not enough.  The machine was 
                    in working order, the certification 
                    up to date.  I ve got an hour until 
                    court-- and if I don t come up with 
                    something we re going to lose.

                                  KALINDA
                            (recounting)
                    Okay.  Stern gets into an accident-- 
                    not because he s drunk, but because 
                    he s confused.  He doesn t want to 
                    admit it, so he goes and has four 
                    drinks-- trying to make it look 
                    like he s covering up a DUI.  So 
                    what does the cop do?

                                  ALICIA
                    Sobriety tests-- 

                                  KALINDA
                    Which he fails because now he s had 
                    a few, or he s shaken up, or--

      Kalinda stops, realizing... something s missing.

                                  ALICIA
                    What?

                                  KALINDA
                    The question isn t what did the cop 
                    do?  It s: What didn tthe cop do?

                                  ALICIA
                          (thinks for a second)
                    He didn t do a preliminary 
                    breathalyzer at the scene-- but 
                    they don t always do those.  Some 
                    officers do and some don t.

                                  KALINDA
                    So what about Officer Sutton?

      Kalinda looks at her watch, gets up--

                                  ALICIA
                    Can you find out in an hour?


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      48.

                                  KALINDA
                    I can try.


      Will catches up with Alicia as she heads to the stairs...

                                  WILL
                    Alicia... where s Stern?

                                  ALICIA
                    He s meeting me at court.  Why?

                                  WILL
                    We went through his casework.  
                    Everything was great until a year 
                    ago.  He started missing filing 
                    deadlines.  Luckily they weren t 
                    important, but we could be 
                    vulnerable here.  I m not asking 
                    you to divulge any privileged 
                    communique--

                                  ALICIA
                    Good.

                                  WILL
                    I just need to know where his 
                    head s at.  Unless that blowup was 
                    his final word on the subject.
                          (off her stare)
                    Look-- all I want is for you to 
                    look after his best interests.  The 
                    firm s best interests. 

                                  ALICIA
                    The firm assigned me to represent 
                    him.  With all the confidentiality 
                    that entails.  I can t... say 
                    anymore.  

      Will stares at her.  A long pause.  Then Will nods: okay.  
      Alicia heads into the stairwell, leaving--


      Returning home with his book bag, Zach stops at the planter 
      across from his door, takes his recording purple Nano from 
    it.  He...


      ...klump-- drops his book bag on his bed, starts toward his 
      computer.  Dammit.  Forgot.  It s not there.  He starts back 
      toward...  THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      49.




      ...the card table in the living room.  Looks into the 
      kitchen.  Hears Jackie on the phone.  He goes to his 
      computer, turns the screen away from the kitchen, checks the 
      poll again.   Will the Florricks divorce this year? Below 
    it:  Yes-- 69.5%  No-- 31.5%. He attaches the Nano, then...


      ...peers into his bedroom.  Reaches behind the painting for the 
      manila envelope.  Stops.  It s not there.  He reaches again.  
      What the hell?  It takes him a second, then pissed, he...


      ...bangs into Grace s room:

                                  ZACH
                    You gave it to Mom.

                                  GRACE
                    What?  Get out of here!

                                  ZACH
                    The pictures of Dad.  You gave it 
                    to Mom.  

                                  GRACE
                    I didn t give anything to Mom.

                                  ZACH
                    It s gone.

                                  GRACE
                    Grandma.

      Zach pauses.  Stares at her.  

                                  ZACH
                    Why-- How do you know?

                                  GRACE
                    Zach.  She goes through my room when 
                    I m at school.  Throwing things away 
                    she doesn t like.  Candy and 
                    clothes.  She never does it to you 
                    because you re the  good boy.  

      Zach stares at her.  Angry.

                                  ZACH
                    I hate this.

                                  GRACE
                    Yeah. When dyou start paying attention? 


                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      50.

      Zach frowns, starts out.  


      Officer Sutton is on the stand.  

                                  ALICIA
                    Officer, what sobriety tests did 
                    you perform on Mr. Stern?

                                  MATAN
                    Objection.  Officer Sutton has 
                    already testified in detail about 
                    the tests he performed--

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, your honor, I m more interested 
                    in the one he didn t perform.  

    The Judge takes a second, as Stern peers up, interested now.

                                  JUDGE ROMANO
                    Okay.  Let s see where this is going.

                                  ALICIA
                    I see no record of you performing a 
                      preliminary breathalyzer on Mr. 
                    Stern at the scene, Officer?

                                  OFFICER SUTTON
                    I don t always do that, ma am.

      Alicia nods, takes a stack of documents from the defense table, 
      trades an appreciative nod with Kalinda in the gallery.

                                  ALICIA
                    These are reports from your last 37 
                    DUIs.You performed a preliminary 
                    breathalyzer on... would you like 
                    to guess how many?  37. 

      Officer Sutton shifts in his chair, pauses.  As Stern starts 
    to grin, sees where Alicia is going.  

                                  JUDGE ROMANO
                    Officer Sutton.

                                  OFFICER SUTTON
                    Your honor-- it s perfectly innocent.  
                    I voided the results because... the 
                    machine was malfunctioning.  It showed 
                    Mr. Stern s blood alcohol level was 
                    .03, but I could see he was drunk;

                    he was stumbling around...

                                  JUDGE ROMANO
                    So you neglected to put it in the 
                    police report?

                                  OFFICER SUTTON
                    I--  It wasn t accurate.  We got 
                    him to the station, he blew a .15--

                                  ALICIA
                    An hour later, after the drinks 
                    from the bar fully kicked in--

      Judge Romano stares at Matan who s already in ass-covering mode--

                                  MATAN
                    Your Honor, I just-- I had no idea--

                                  JUDGE ROMANO
                    Mr. Brody, I m dismissing the DUI.  
                    And unless you want me to dismiss the 
                    battery and levy sanctions, you better 
                    come up with something fast.

      Judge Romano starts out as Stern smiles, nods to Alicia.  
      Matan leans toward their table, whispers to Stern:

                                  MATAN
                      Misdemeanor assault, six months 
                    probation?

                                  STERN
                    Ask her.

      Matan sighs-- do we have to play this game?  He asks Alicia:

                                  MATAN
                      Misdemeanor assault, six months 
                    probation?

                                  ALICIA
                    Time served?

      Matan nods, starts out.  As Stern smiles over at Alicia:

                                  STERN
                    You re pretty pleased with

                    Yes, you are.

      Alicia looks at Stern--

                                  ALICIA
                    You shouldn t be driving, Mr. Stern.    
                    And unless you disclose your 
                    condition... you shouldn t be 
                    practicing law, either.  

    And Alicia starts out.  Stern watches her go.


      Diane works at her desk, when Stern knocks, enters.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      53.

                    You can repay my equity over time.  
                    That way no one has to lose their job 
                    over it.  The last thing I need is to 
                    waste time and energy here fighting 
                    people I love.

      Stern pauses, struggling with this--

                                  STERN (CONT D)
                    And I do.  What I said before-- I m 
                    sorry.  It wasn t true.

                                  DIANE
                    I know.  I was the best lawyer you 
                    had at that firm.

      Stern smiles, pleased that Diane gives as good as she gets.

                    I have to admit, I never thought I d

      Then he turns.  Literally and figuratively.

                                  STERN
                    Who said anything about retiring?  
                    I m leaving.  To start a new firm.

                    And then I m coming for the rest.  
                    But hey-- it ll be fun, right?

      Diane s speechless, but she can t help but admire the sheer 
      audacity of the man.  Finally, faced with a fait accompli:

                                  DIANE
                    Then let the best lawyer win.

    The two of them share a look, then--

                                  STERN
                    Goodbye, Diane.

      Diane pauses, surprised.  Then--

                                  DIANE
                    Goodbye, Jonas.

      Stern gives a slight nod.  Goes.  Diane watches him down the 
      hall see a last bad painting on the wall.  He takes it down, 
      throws it to the ground, disgusted.


      Stern s on the phone, as Alicia knocks-- he waves her in--

                                  STERN
                    No, bigger-- I need twenty-five

                    I want you to be one of them.

      Alicia.  Pulled up short.  Dumbstruck.  He nods.  Serious.

      Alicia pauses.  Out of nowhere.

                    What?

                                  STERN
                    Forget the sex.  Sex was just the

                    That s it, Alicia.  I m not your

                    Good-bye.  That s it.  Take care.

      Alicia stares at him, leaves.    THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      56.




      Alicia slowly drifts toward her car.  A few other employees 
      heading home too, dispersing.  Taking out her car keys, 
      Alicia beepsher car lock when she sees...

      ...Amber Madison leaning against her driver s door, waiting.

                                  AMBER
                    Don t worry.  I just wanted to tell 
                    you I m sorry.   

      Alicia takes a second, and, without saying a word, opens her 
      backseat door, drops her laptop in.

                                  AMBER (CONT D)
                    I thought your husband was in love 
                    with me.  He made me think he was 
                    in love with me.  And now I just-- 
                    I wanted to warn you.

      Alicia moves past Amber like she s not there, opens her car door.

                                  AMBER (CONT D)
                    Listen.  Peter threatened me.  If I 
                    didn t pull the book, if I didn t 
                    stop giving interviews, he would 
                    have me... hurt... 

      Alicia.  We can see she absorbs this, but she climbs into her 
      car, pulls on her seatbelt.  Amber pissed by her indifference:

                                  AMBER (CONT D)
                    Would you listen?  I don t know 
                    what he s capable of.  If he knew I 
                    was here, I don t know what he d 
                    do. 

      Bang-- Alicia closes her car door as if nobody were there.  
      Amber yells in...

                                  AMBER (CONT D)
                    Oh, go to hell!  You two deserve 
                    each other! 

    But Alicia starts the car, backs up, Amber still yelling...

                                  AMBER (CONT D)
                    You tell him if he does anything, 
                    I ll print it.  I ll give an 
                    interview he won t believe!  I ll 
                    talk about you!  I ll talk about 
                    your kids--  About--

    But Alicia is already driving away.  Amber no longer audible.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE GOOD WIFE #108   "Threesome"   GOLD COLLATED   10/27/09      57.

      Alicia doesn t even give her the courtesy of looking in the 
      rearview mirror, the sight of Amber getting smaller and 
      smaller behind her.


      Peter.  He reads a law book in the jury room.  Two knocks on 
    the door.  The Bailiff leaning in. 

                                  PETER
                    Time to go back?  

    But the Bailiff steps aside, lets a woman in.  Alicia.  Peter 
      gets up, startled... 

                                  PETER (CONT D) 
                    Alicia?  I... 

      Something about Alicia s face.  The same look from earlier.  

                                  PETER (CONT D) 
                    What s wrong?  

      Alicia crosses the room toward him.  

                                  PETER (CONT D) 
                    Are the kids alright? 

      Alicia, a foot from him, reaches her hands up, grabs his 
      head, and pulls Peter toward her, and... 

      ...kisses him.  Hard.  Passionate.  But a kiss she controls.  
    Her hands pulling him to her.  Then she lets go.  Peter 
      stares at her, startled.  A second.  Then... *

      ...Aliciaturns, starts out of the juror holding room.  *
      Leaves.  Gone.  Leaving Peter standing there, looking after 
      her.
