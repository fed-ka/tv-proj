                                              TEASER

          FADE IN:

  11EXT. BANGOR TOWN HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

          An upscale duplex on a quiet residential street.  Trees
          cast long shadows under the glare of security lights.


  22INT. TOWN HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT

          ECU of lipstick being applied as LIGHT JAZZ from a radio
          station plays in the b.g., coming from a stereo downstairs.

          Next, EYELASHES are lightly mascaraed.  The eye, a luminous
          green, blinks...

          A BRUSH is pulled through a tangle of red hair, which
          crackles with static electricity.  The owner of the hair
          whips it aside, as we reveal:*

          DANA BRIGHT, standing barefoot in a silk robe as she*
          critically appraises her face in a mirror.


          INSIDE A WALK-IN CLOSET

          Dana takes a sleek woman's suit off a rack, then a much
          racier cocktail dress, the price tag still attached, and
          compares the two.  She smiles mischievously, then puts
          the suit back and moves out of frame with the dress.


  33*INT. TOWN HOUSE - FIRST LEVEL

          A neat, well-appointed living room, dimly lit by a small
          table lamp.  Stereo components glow in a glass cabinet. 
          Under the music, we hear the KACHUNK of a lock turning.












                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - TEASER - 6/10/02 - GRN  2.


    3CONTINUED:3

          CLOSE ON THE FRONT DOOR

          as three more locks and dead bolts are opened one after
          the other from outside.  As the door eases open...


  44INT. BEDROOM

          Dana models the dress in the mirror.  She looks sexy and
            stunning.  She doesn't notice when the jazz music stops. 
          But then a NEW SONG -- the old Lenny Welch hit, "Since I
          Fell For You" -- starts up and she reacts with surprise. 
          And then trepidation.


55TOP OF THE STAIRS

          Still barefoot, Dana looks down into the shadowed living
          room.  Other than the changed music, nothing seems amiss. 
            Tentatively, she starts down the stairs, reaches the bottom
          and moves to the stereo.


          DANA'S POV - APPROACHING THE STEREO CABINET

          A disk is spinning in the CD player.  As Dana eyes it,
          her trepidation becoming genuine fear...

                                        MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Say cheese!

          Dana nearly jumps out of her skin as she turns into the
          FLASH from...


            A DIGITAL CAMERA - CLOSE ON LCD SCREEN

          as Dana's frightened face is FROZEN.  Then the camera is
          lowered, and we pivot to reveal MAX CASSIDY, a good looking
            freelance news photographer a few years older than Dana,
          who's standing in the kitchen doorway.  He laughs as he
          hits a light switch, brightening the room.  Dana tries to
          collect herself, but we sense that she's still scared.

                                        DANA
                        Max...

                                        MAX
                          Surprise.  And from the look on
                        your face, I'd say that's an
                          understatement.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - TEASER - 6/10/02 - GRN  3.


    5CONTINUED:5

                                        DANA
                        What are you doing here?

                                        MAX
                        I realized I still had your keys. 
                        And since I was back in town...

          Dana glances at a phone on a counter that divides the
          living room from the kitchen.  Max doesn't seem to notice,
          fiddling with the camera as he ambles over.

                                        DANA
                        You should've called.

                                        MAX
                        And miss a shot like this?

          He comes close to show it to her, but Dana shifts away,
          turning back to the stereo.

                                        MAX
                        Five megapixels, amazing color...
                        I may just toss my film cameras.
                                (sees what she's doing,
                                grabs her wrist)
                        Hey, let it play.

          Setting his camera down, he pulls her gently but firmly
          away from the stereo and toward him.

                                        MAX
                        It's one of your favorites, right?

                                        DANA
                        Look, Max, I've got to...

          But Max has taken her by the waist with his other hand as
          he tries to lead her into a slow dance.

                                        MAX
                        C'mon, once around the coffee
                        table, for old times sake.

          And his manner is charming, and for just a moment Dana
          thinks that if she goes along for now, it'll be easier to
          get rid of him later.  Max pulls her closer, sighs.

                                        MAX
                        Four months in Afghanistan, three
                        in the Territories.  Bad scenes
                        but great visuals.  Catch my
                          Newsweek cover?

  5CONTINUED: (2)5

                                        MAX (CONT'D)
                                (she nods)
                        I put in a word for you with the
                        New York bureau chief.

                                        DANA
                        I'm happy where I am.

                                        MAX
                        It's a big world, Dana, and you'd
                        look good in it.  Especially in
                        that dress.  Hot date?

                                        DANA
                        It's an assignment.

                                        MAX
                        What're you covering?  Governor's
                        ball or a hookers' convention?
                                (she pulls away)
                        I'm kidding...

          Dana's moving to the phone.  Max follows, turning jealous.

                                        MAX
                        Who're you calling?  This guy
                        you're "not" going out with?

                                        DANA
                        The police.

                                        MAX
                        Whoa!

          He "playfully" grabs her wrist again as he takes the phone
          away and sets it back down.

                                        MAX
                        You want me to leave, just say
                        so.

                                        DANA
                        I want you to leave.

                                        MAX
                        Hmm, now I'm confused...

          And in one quick motion, he twists her arm behind her and
          shoves her up against the kitchen counter.

                                        MAX
                        No means yes, right?  Yes means
                        no.  You get hazy on the protocols
                        when you're away too long.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - TEASER - 6/10/02 - GRN  5.


  5CONTINUED: (3)5

          His free hand gropes her thigh, pushing up the short dress.

                                        DANA
                        Max!  Stop it!

                                        MAX
                        What we need is a little honest
                          communication.  No mixed signals.

          Dana struggles against him, her free hand meanwhile groping
          across the counter... reaching past the phone...

                                        DANA
                          Please...

                                        MAX
                        You mean right here?  On the
                          counter?

          And as Dana reaches toward A SET OF KNIVES in a hardwood
          block, Max yanks at the bodice of her dress, RIPPING it. 
          (And throughout this assault, the SONG continues playing.)

                                        MAX
                        Oops.

          Dana's fingers finally curl around a knife handle.  She
          yanks the big blade from the block and wheels.  Max jumps
          back, narrowly avoiding being slashed.  And laughs.

                                        MAX
                        Yikes!  'Scuse me, "Mrs. Bates."

                                        DANA
                                (barely under control)
                        Get out.

                                        MAX
                        I was just fooling around.

                                        DANA
                        Now.

          Max backs away, turning contrite.

                                        MAX
                        Sure.  Okay.  Just relax.
                                (nodding toward kitchen)
                        Your keys are on the counter.

          Dana watches him as he picks up his camera and moves to
          the door.  He pauses as he opens it, gives her a last
          look, his voice somber and full of regret now.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - TEASER - 6/12/02 - WHT-2  6.

                        I'm sorry, Dana.  About everything. 
                          I really am.

          And he closes the door behind him, the lock clicking. 
          Dana exhales, then moves to the stereo and turns it off. 
          For a beat, she just stands there, shaking slightly in
          her torn dress.

  88INT. JOHNNY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          JOHNNY's got a cookbook open to a recipe for "Duck a
          l'Orange", various condiments and foodstuffs arrayed about,
          and a few pots and saucepans simmering on the stove. 
          Reggae music plays as he dips a wooden spoon into a
          saucepan for a taste.  But as he raises it to his lips --


99A JOHNNY FLASH - DANA'S HANDS

          come into frame, steadying Johnny's as she raises the
          spoon to her lips and tastes.

                                        DANA
                        More bitters?


  1010RESUME

          As Johnny reacts to this subtly suggestive flash; then he
          tastes the sauce himself, nods.

                                        JOHNNY
                        More bitters.  Right.

          He moves to a cabinet and, as he opens it, we BRIEFLY
          FREEZE ON HIS TOUCH, then continue as he takes out a spice
          jar.  But behind him now as he returns to the stove, BRUCE
          enters frame and opens the same cabinet.  He pulls out a
          bag of chips, then leans against the fridge, munching as
          he eyes Johnny skeptically.

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't tell me it's not a date...

          Johnny glances over his shoulder to see Bruce, then wearily
          returns to his cooking.

                                        BRUCE
                        ...because frankly it's an insult
                        to the intelligence of a Corleone.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (mutters to himself)
                        It's not a date.

                                        BRUCE
                        Let's see.  You're cooking.  She's
                        coming over to your crib.  
                                (smirks)
                        Sure sounds like a--

                                (turning, annoyed)
                        It's not a...

          Only Bruce isn't there and Johnny's words trail off.

                                        JOHNNY
                          ...date.

          And now we realize this Bruce was a vision, a replay of a
          recent visit, cued when Johnny touched the cabinet.  The
          DOOR BELL rings.


    1111INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

          As Johnny opens it to reveal Dana, now wearing the business
          suit she put aside before and looking away pensively. 
          But she quickly dons a game face as she turns to Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey.  Come on in...

                                        DANA
                        I'm sorry I'm late...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not at all...

          As he escorts her in...

                                        DANA
                        You're very nice to do this for
                        me...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey, I owed you one, remember..?

                                        DANA
                        I think this could be a cover
                        piece for the Sunday Magazine.

                                        JOHNNY
                        'My Dinner With Johnny'.

                                        DANA
                        You have to admit a date with a
                        psychic is a pretty good pitch
                        for a story.
                                (beat)
                        Not that this is a real date.

                                (understands)
                        Just a pretend date.  For your
                        story.

                                        DANA
                        Oh...
                                (takes out a wine

                        For dinner.  The "sommelier" at
                        my local liquor store says Merlot's
                        a good choice with duck.

          But as Johnny takes the bottle --


1212A JOHNNY FLASH - INT. JOHNNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          As he and Dana have passionate sex.


  1313RESUME ON JOHNNY

          staring at the bottle, as Dana eyes him suspiciously...
          she's seen him have flashes before...

                                        DANA
                        Okay, here we go.  Look, let's
                          establish some ground rules for
                        our "date".  It's not fair for
                        you to see into my life if I can't
                        see into yours.  Which means when
                        you have a vision -- like right
                        now -- you've got to fill me in.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Fill you in.  Right.

                                        DANA
                        So?  What'd you see?

          And Johnny may be a psychic, but he's also a gentleman in
          a quandary.  He eyes the wine bottle in his hands, then
          rotates it a quarter turn.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bunch of old guys in berets turning
                          bottles.  A quarter turn, a quarter
                        turn, a quarter turn...
                                (shakes out his wrist)
                        Hell on your wrists.

          Dana eyes him as if she doesn't quite buy this.

          FADE IN:

  1414INT. KITCHEN - CLOSE ON A BIG KNIFE

          as Johnny uses it to deftly slice some carrots.  PULL
          BACK to show Dana eyeing the knife as he works, unable to
          escape its recent associations.

                                        DANA
                        So, when did you become a cook?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Around the time I ordered take-
                        out and flashed on someone in a
                        kitchen sneezing in my Kung Pao.

                                        DANA
                                (picks up a tomato)
                        No "bad vibes" from raw veggies?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Only that primal scream when
                        they're torn from the vine.  

          He's about to taste his Orange sauce again.

                                        DANA
                        May I?

          As in his earlier flash, she steadies his hands as she
          sips from the spoon.  And as they both react subtly to
          the unexpected intimacy of this moment...

                                        DANA
                        You got the bitters just right.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.

          But he's a little uncomfortable, and quickly moves away
          to put the bitters back in the spice cabinet.

            intruding on Johnny's side of the date... all of these
          are bits and pieces of past conversations that seem to be
          commenting on the action... Johnny does not interact with
          these visitors but he is constantly aware of them.  In
          essence, we are trying to show the audience what it's
          like to be in Johnny's skin on this date.  It serves as a
          metaphor for the baggage any of us bring to a date.

          We'll discuss specific execution but in general, I think
          the visitors are in Johnny's coverage and angles favoring
          his pov and are not seen in other angles.)

                                        JOHNNY
                        So... job keeping you busy?

                                        DANA
                        Oh yeah.  All news.  All the time. 
                        That's me.


  1515ANGLE - FINDING BRUCE MUNCHING CHIPS

                                        BRUCE
                          Whatever you do... don't get her
                        talking about work.

          Bruce crushes a large chip into his mouth.  And even though
          Dana can't see Bruce, she notices Johnny's brief
            distraction...

                                        DANA
                        You've got that look again.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bruce was just telling me -- I
                        mean he was telling me yesterday --
                        not to ask about your job...

                                        DANA
                          Because?

                                        BRUCE
                        It's a turn-off.  A one way ticket
                        to good-nightsville: handshake
                        instead of tongue.

          Johnny moves next to Dana, who's leaning against a counter,
          as he rinses off a few dishes that have been soaking.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        He just wanted this to feel like
                        a real date... as much as
                          possible... for the article.

    15CONTINUED:15

          And Dana nods, accepting this and even a little chagrined.

                                        DANA
                        He's right.  The last thing I
                        want to talk about on a date is
                        work.  But the truth is I hear it
                        all the time from guys I go out
                        with...


  1616ANGLE TO FIND SARAH DRYING DISHES

          beside Johnny from a recent occasion... 

                                        SARAH
                        She's a slut.  Walt says she's
                        slept with half the county.

          Johnny covers his reaction.  Dana picks up a cloth...

                                        DANA
                        Can I help?  This is my specialty
                        in the kitchen, sad to say...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sure.

          She begins to dry dishes too.  And now both of Johnny's
          women are doing the same action on both sides of him.

                                        SARAH
                        I mean, I suppose she's
                          attractive... but really you should
                        hear Walt talk about her...  

          Finding --

                                        WALT

                          A carnivore.  Certain animals are

                                        JOHNNY
                        You getting hungry?

                                        DANA
                          A little.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't we start with the soup
                        while we're waiting for the duck
                        to finish...  

          She lifts the lid and looks into the pot...

                                        DANA
                        Hmmm.  Tomato?

                                        JOHNNY
                        With basmati rice grown in the
                          foothills of the Himalayas and
                          nurtured by the famous five rivers
                        of Punjab.

          Johnny starts to ladle the soup into bowls...

                                        DANA
                        Do I detect a hint of curry?

          Johnny nods...

                                        SARAH
                        She's just not worthy of you. 
                        Trust me.  I know you.

                        Hey, who cares what Sarah says.

          Finding Bruce is back... and in a sense it's like the
          devil and angel on his shoulder...

                        about Dana, she's one hot-looking
                        white girl.  I say go for it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm going for it.

                        wine.

            Searching drawers...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gosh, I hope I have...

          He looks up to see Dana holding up a corkscrew from her
          bag...

                                        DANA
                        Brought one just in case.   

          But as he takes it from her, ramp to Johnny and we do a
          180 degree turn into...          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - ACT ONE - 6/10/02 - GRN  15.


  1717INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          ...to find REVEREND PURDY opening another bottle of wine
          with the same corkscrew... we lose Dana for an instant
          during the effect and when we find her, in roughly the
          same proximity to Johnny as before, she's in a different
          dress... she moves into the scene with Purdy... 

                                        PURDY
                        Well, if he's serving duck, then
                          I suggest a good Merlot.  Of
                        course, depending on the sauce, a
                          Cabernet Sauvignon or Syrah might
                        also be appropriate.

                                        DANA
                        Still teaching me?

                                        PURDY
                                (pops the cork)
                        You still have a lot to learn. 
                        For example, you're entirely wrong
                        for Johnny.

            Intercutting Johnny still in his kitchen, turning the
            corkscrew into the wine bottle as he observes...

                                        DANA
                                  (surprised)
                          I explained to you it's just...

                                        PURDY
                        ...an "interview," not an actual
                        date, yes, of course.
                                (pouring)
                        I know him, Dana, and more
                          importantly, I know you.

          And this line has a clearly intimate implication, which
          Dana's expression reluctantly acknowledges, and which
          Johnny, watching from the sidelines, remarks as well.

                                        PURDY
                        You make a habit of picking the
                        wrong men because it isolates you
                        and, truth be known, you prefer
                          isolation to intimacy.  Whereas
                        Johnny needs to end his seclusion
                        and make a genuine connection.

                                        DANA
                        Let me guess:  You've added a
                        psychology degree to your list of
                        "honorary" accomplishments.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - ACT ONE - 6/11/02 - GOLD  16.


    17CONTINUED:17

                                        PURDY
                                (unfazed)
                        Tell me, Dana.  Do you still hear
                        the key turning in the lock at
                        night, then wake up in the dark,
                          stifling a scream?

          And this cryptic reference effectively silences her. 
          Smiling pleasantly, Purdy raises his glass.

                                        PURDY
                        Cheers.

          Reverse the 180 turn back into...


  1818INT. JOHNNY'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny's kitchen as he pops the cork and the vision ends...
          she's staring at him, as she taps on her wine glass with
          a knife.

                                        DANA
                          Remember "It's a Wonderful Life"?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (pouring wine)
                        Sure.

                        "Every time a bell rings, another
                        angel gets his wings."
                                (off his bemused look)
                        I think we're going to have to
                          institute a bell system for you --
                        only it'll mean that a psychic's
                        had a vision, and he has to share.

                        Why don't we get out of the
                          kitchen; it's getting stuffy in
                        here.

          And as they take their soup and wine glasses into the
          other room...

                                                                          TIME CUT TO:

          Johnny and Dana sit at a gracefully set table, tall candles
          flickering as they sip their soup...

                        a psychic.  And you're not playing
                        by the rules.  What did you see
                        in the kitchen?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure you'll like it.

                        This is part and parcel of the
                        Johnny Smith Dating Experience. 
                        I knew it when I signed on.

          Johnny sighs and lets fly, embarrassed...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I didn't realize you knew Reverend
                          Purdy... so well.

                                        DANA
                        Oh.

          Dana reacts, her cheeks might flush a tad but she smiles,
          intrigued.  

                                        DANA
                        You know, this is actually kind
                        of... liberating.  It's not as if
                        I can be dishonest with someone
                        who can literally see through me.

                        for a while.  But we're still...
                        well, "friends" may not be the
                        best word, but we've always found
                        it... enlightening to spend time
                          together...

          And now that she's all but challenged Johnny to
            disapprove... we move to reveal Johnny's mother Vera Smith

          disappears before it lands.  Now a DING DING DING brings
          him back to Dana, who's tapping on her wine glass again.

                        I got the same advice.  Which is

                                (off his uneasy silence)
                        My story is a profile on Johnny
                        Smith.  Johnny Smith lost the
                        woman he loved when he was in a
                        coma for six years.  And yet he
                        finds a way to keep her a part of
                        his life.  Can't leave that out,
                        Johnny.  Can I?

          A long beat as Johnny considers this, still uneasy and
          not sure how to even begin.

          Mills High, 1995 -- opens it to a bookmarked page, and

                        1995, the year of the accident


          INSERT - YEARBOOK

            A centerfold spread of "casual" shots of high school kids
          and teachers, dominated by a photo of Johnny and Sarah, 
          Sarah's and Johnny's signatures are beneath the photo.


  2323RESUME - ON JOHNNY

          As he looks up from the photo.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ever been in love, Dana?

                        No.  Maybe not.

          Johnny touches Sarah's signature.  And we turn 180 degrees
          and reveal --

  2525FINDING JOHNNY (INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE)

          moving to the side of the car, watching himself and Sarah
          in the back seat... but in his coverage we can see his
          home and Dana at the dinner table...

                                        SARAH
                        Two, three, come on, give me a
                        number.  Don't you have any feeling
                        at all when we're like this?

                                        PAST JOHNNY
                        Yeah, I have all sorts of very
                        nice feelings...

          As he nuzzles her, she laughs...

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, I want to know... how
                        many kids are we going to have?

                                (to Dana)
                        Sarah was my first... the only
                        woman I've ever really loved.

                                        PAST JOHNNY
                        I see ten, no, no, fifteen... our
                        own family hockey team...

                        Don't put your money on that one,
                        pal.

          She giggles and kisses him playfully.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Dana)
                        We had our lives mapped out.  It
                        wasn't hard.  All we wanted was
                        each other.

                        why don't we just elope...

          She smiles, liking the sound of it...

                                        PAST JOHNNY
                        Think of it - in thirty years,
                        I'll be the funny old biology
                          teacher, you'll be headlining the

          Sarah looks into Past Johnny's eyes with love... Johnny
          turns back to Dana... and the vision's over... he's back

                        We still share each others' lives,
                        but she has a husband now, a
                        family, while I've got memories...
                        and "visions."  And if they
                          sometimes seem more real to me
                        than my actual life, it's because
                        I wish they were.

          Dana studies him, jealous of this woman who haunts him,
          sorry that she had to ask.

                          I should check on the duck.  

          And as he reaches for her soup bowl, she touches his wrist. 
          Suddenly every door in the room SLAMS SHUT, one after the
          other.  Then the LOCKS TURN and Johnny reacts to the sound
          of a battery of small fists POUNDING on the other side of
          the doors, wrenching the doorknobs, as from behind each
          he also hears a little girl crying "Let me out!  Please! 
          Let me out!" and just as suddenly, the vision ends.


          NEW ANGLE

          The room is back to normal, the doors are open, Dana still
          looking up at Johnny.  And as he takes her bowl and steps
          back, still reacting to the strange vision...

  2727INT. COUNTRY & WESTERN BAR - NIGHT

          Dwight Yoakam is on the jukebox and Max Cassidy is at the
          bar with a new friend, a gangly but pretty young woman
          named SAUNDRA.  They've already had a few, and Saundra
          giggles as the bartender finishes pouring two fresh shots.

                                        MAX*
                        Know what happens when you play a
                        country song backwards?
                                (she shakes her head)
                        You get back your farm, your pickup
                        and your girl.  In that order.

          Saundra laughs into her shot glass, almost spitting out*
          her booze.*

                                        SAUNDRA
                        You're funny.  You know that?*

                                        MAX
                        Yeah, about as funny as this music.*

                                        SAUNDRA*
                        You don't like country?*

                                        MAX
                        Hate it worse than disco.  And
                        disco almost killed me.

                                        SAUNDRA
                        Then for God's sake, what are you
                        doing here?

                                        SAUNDRA
                        Aww, c'mon, cowboy, what did you*
                        lose?  Your farm?  Your pickup?
                                (beat)
                        Your girl.

          Max clutches his heart, makes a gagging sound.  She's
          pegged him.

                                        SAUNDRA
                        Poor baby.  Well, you know there's*
                        only one way to forget a woman.
                                (leans boozily toward
                                him)
                        Find another.

          They look at each other solemnly for a beat, then burst
          out laughing.

                                        MAX
                        My God, she's found the cure for
                        the honky tonk blues!  Barkeep,
                        two more shots and a coupula beers
                        to wash 'em down.

          And as the bartender sets up two more shots, CUT TO:


  2828INT. JOHNNY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - TWO WINE GLASSES

          PULL BACK to find Johnny by the open stove, prodding the
          duck with a fork.  Dana sips from her glass of wine. (Note:
          they are not tipsy.)

                        This Long Island's taking longer
                        than expected.

                                        DANA
                          Fortunately, your guest has the
                          patience of a saint.

          He closes the oven...

                                        JOHNNY
                        So what's the next phase of this,
                        um, "interview?"

                                        DANA
                                  (correcting)
                        The next phase of this 'date'. 
                        What would you do on a normal
                        date?

                                        JOHNNY
                        There are no normal dates around
                        here... which is why there aren't
                        many dates.

                                        DANA
                        Must get lonely.

          And that's right at the heart of Johnny Smith but he tries
          to deflect it with a joke.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You'd be surprised how far
                          satellite television has come in
                        seven years.  I like the old game
                        show network.  Charles Nelson
                        Reilly in his prime.

          But she's not laughing, she knows he's covering... a smile
          grows on her lips as an idea hatches...

                                        DANA
                        I know how we can pass the time...


  2929INT. JOHNNY'S LIVING ROOM - CLOSE ON A TURNTABLE - NIGHT

          Dana, her suit jacket off now, is putting a vinyl platter
          on the turntable... one of Vera's old records...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't think this is a good idea.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - ACT TWO - 6/14/02 - PINK-2  27.


    29CONTINUED:29

                                        DANA
                        It's a great idea.  But you might
                        want to take off your shoes.  I'd
                        like to spare my toes.

                                        JOHNNY
                        How about sparing me?

          But as the music starts, Dana just slips out of her own
          shoes, then crooks a finger at Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Really, I don't dance.  I've never
                        danced, and now I've got this
                        cane and... well, maybe you've
                          noticed, but I've also got this
                        little thing about being touched...
                        for obvious reasons.

          Dana eyes him, and perhaps she remembers Purdy's admonition
          about Johnny needing someone who's not afraid to make a
          "genuine connection," because she stands firm.

                                        DANA
                        I want you to dance with me. 
                          Consider it part of the story.
                                (beat)
                        Resistance is futile.

          Johnny sighs, then pulls off his shoes and walks over to
          her.  But he's unsure what to do with his hands, or for
          that matter his cane.  But Dana just takes the cane and
          throws it aside, looks in his eyes.

                                        DANA
                        I won't let you fall, Johnny. 
                                (beat)
                        Just give me your left hand...

          And as she takes his left hand with her right, we FREEZE
          briefly on their touch, then Johnny sees over her shoulder
          Purdy taking the hand of another Dana.

                                        DANA
                        ...Put your other hand on my waist,
                        like this...

          Again, a little FREEZE on the moment of contact, as Johnny

          sees a third Dana taking the waist of ANOTHER MAN; he's
          well dressed, slightly older than she is. 

                                        DANA
                        ...and just feel the music, and
                        follow me.

          And as all three couples start dancing, Johnny turns to
          look Dana in the eyes as she smiles at him.

                                        DANA
                        See, you're a natural.

          And now Johnny sees a fourth Dana dancing with Max.  (And
          as they continue to talk and dance, more couples will
          join them, most of the men older than Dana and radiating
          success and self-confidence, until all the couples turn
          the living room into a small crowded ballroom.)

                                        JOHNNY
                        And you've done this before.

                                        DANA
                        Once or twice.
                                (sees him looking
                                away)
                        Hey.  It's important to make eye
                        contact with your "date."

                                        JOHNNY
                        Like I said, I'm out of practice.
                                (beat)
                          Anything else I should know?

                                        DANA
                        If you want to hold me closer, I
                        won't consider it a proposal.

          And so he does.  And it seems quite natural, to both of
          them, as they move more easily together.

                                        JOHNNY
                        So this sort of thing really sells
                        papers?

                                        DANA
                          Absolutely.  People like to get
                        the personal perspective.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And are you getting one?  A
                          personal perspective, I mean.

                                        DANA
                        I'm definitely seeing a different
                        side of you.  I mean, up until
                        now it's been...
                                (gruff Johnny voice)
                        ..."No questions right now, Dana." 
                        "Sorry, Dana, but I can't do an
                          interview."

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry.  I guess I was a little
                        brusque at times.  Then again...
                                (but now he smiles
                                and imitates her)
                        ..."A good reporter and her subject
                        can be a team, Johnny... like
                        Cosell and Ali."

          And now it's Dana who has to laugh at herself, puts both
          arms around his neck, as she pulls back a bit to look him
          in the eye.  And meanwhile both of Johnny's arms now
          encircle her waist, and they're dancing quite close.(

                                        DANA
                        I guess I came on a little strong
                        too.  But now look at us... we
                        are a team.  A dance team, at
                        least.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Like Astaire and Rogers.

                                        DANA

                                        JOHNNY
                        Abbott and Costello.

          And they both laugh, but meanwhile the physical attraction
          between them is palpable and electric.

          Though there's still the distraction of all those other
          "couples," for Johnny at least.  As he glances away...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Too bad we don't have more room
                        here.

          Suddenly he sees one of the other men -- Max -- haul off
          and SLAP his Dana hard!  As Johnny stops and reacts...

                                        DANA
                        What is it?


          NEW ANGLE

          As Johnny turns to her, then looks away again, but now
          all the other couples are gone.  They continue dancing
          but Johnny's preoccupied now...

                                        DANA
                        Rules are rules.  Tell me what
                        you saw.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Another man was dancing with you. 
                        And then he hit you.

          Her face falls on the revelation.  Then she pulls it back
          in with a defensive smile...

                                        DANA
                        Ah, so, you've met Max. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Max?

                                        DANA
                          A mistake I made once...
                                (beat)
                        Or twice...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Twice?  A guy like that?

                                        DANA
                        It's hard to explain... maybe
                        because I don't really know myself.

          The song has taken on a darker context.  She pulls away,
          and at the moment their fingertips part company, the SCENE
          PIVOTS 180 DEGREES and now the half of the living room
          where the turntable was has become --          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - ACT TWO - 6/19/02 - GRN-2  31.

  3232INT. DANA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - VISION

          which Dana walks into, heading now for her own stereo.
          where the same song is playing.

                                        DANA
                        We lived together for about a
                        year.  He was the nicest guy you*
                        could imagine... talented and*
                          funny...

          She switches off the stereo and turns back to Johnny, but
          she stays in her "apartment," as though what we're seeing
          isn't just a setting, but a metaphor for a part of her
          mind, and her memory, that she's still trapped in.  And*
          at this moment, Max walks into Dana's living room, livid
          with rage.

                                        MAX
                        Where the hell have you been?

          And as Dana turns to him (and though she'll interact*
          physically with "Max" in this scene, she speaks only to
          Johnny, who we understand is seeing a memory that she's 
          reliving in her mind), Max SLAPS her, hard enough to send
          her to her knees!  Dana holds her stinging face, as she
          turns back to Johnny.

                                        DANA
                        ...And he liked to hit women..  *

          Max crouches in front of her, gripping her chin with one*
          hand.

                                        MAX
                        Don't lie to me.  I can smell him
                        on you.   

          And this time, Max throws her head backwards like a
            baseball, sending her hard to the floor.  He exits.  After*
          a beat, Dana struggles to a sitting position and turns to*
          Johnny, her face streaked with tears.

                                        DANA
                        After he hit me enough, I got a
                          restraining order... not that it
                        stopped him from coming by tonight
                        and letting himself in with some
                        keys I didn't think he had.
                                (beat)
                        Max was the worst, but you could
                        say I've got a talent for picking
                        the wrong men.

          But by now, Johnny has walked into her side of the set,
          and stretched out his hand to her...into his vision to
          take her away from it.  She looks up at him, then at his
          hand -- held out resolutely; at this moment not the hand
          of a man who's afraid of being touched, but a man who wants
          to touch this woman, and ease her pain.

          And Dana takes his hand and he helps her to her feet and
          walks her back to his side of the living room, at which
          point Dana's apartment fades away. 

          It's a short journey but a momentous one; we sense that
          they've both crossed a personal boundary.  Dana looks up
          at him.

                                        DANA
                        I was saying something.  What was
                          I saying?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You have a talent for picking the
                        wrong men.

                                        DANA
                        Yes.  Until maybe, just maybe,
                          tonight.

          And the two of them move into a tentative, heartfelt kiss,
          a kiss that grows steadily more passionate as we:          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - ACT TWO - 6/10/02 - GRN  33.


    3333INTERCUT: INT. JOHNNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - VISION

          Johnny and Dana making love.  Just brief FLASHES at first --
          hands removing clothes; hands touching a naked shoulder,
            a breast, the curve of a waist; lips kissing a neck, a
          cheek, a shoulder, and lips.  But soon their passion
            intensifies, building to the flash of Dana atop Johnny
          seen earlier.

          And meanwhile, in the living room, Johnny breaks off the
          kiss and takes Dana by the hand and leads her around the
          corner to the stairs, then slowly up...

                        You don't want me to write about

                        I guess we're about to find out.

          That stops her, she breaks the clinch and leans up on one

                        Well, I do have a very active

                        getting back on a bicycle, but

            reacts... when we cut back, it's Dana again...

                                        DANA
                        Uh oh.  What was that...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Housekeeper.  Had a flash of the
                          housekeeper making the bed
                          tomorrow.

                                        DANA
                        How distracting.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just a little...

                                        SARAH
                          Johnny...

          Johnny looks to his other side... and sees Sarah (pre-
          coma) lying on her back, dressed only in one of his shirts,
          one knee provocatively bent to show a lot of leg...
          meanwhile, Dana stands before him as she takes her dress
          and slip off in one motion...

                                        DANA
                        Let's see if I can get your
                          attention back.

                                        SARAH
                          Remember when I used to sleep
                        over at your house when I was
                        six?

          Dana is in bra, panties and garter belt attached to her
          stockings.  She puts one leg up on the bed.

                                        DANA
                                (re: stockings)
                        Wanna help me with these?

          Johnny eyes that leg... only now Sarah's arms wrap around
          him from behind.  At first he tries to ignore her as she
          whispers in his ear...

                                        SARAH
                        What would your mom say if she
                        could she see us now?

          Johnny rolls down one stocking... and then another... as
          one of Sarah's legs wraps around his mid-section from
          behind, then another...  Dana moves in beside him, kissing
          him hungrily, and now Johnny is in the middle of the two
          women... and in a way he's kind of getting into this...
          as the kiss with Dana ends...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know, this isn't half bad.

                                        DANA
                        You ain't seen nothing yet.

                                        PURDY
                        Make room for Daddy...

          And Purdy slides into the increasingly crowded bed in a
            nightshirt... the mood is broken...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay, that's it...

                                        DANA
                        What... is something wrong?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  Yes.

          Vera enters...

                                        VERA
                        Johnny, honey, time to get up for
                        school.

                        It's me, I was too aggressive,
                        wasn't I... I do that all the...

                        You're right, this was a mistake;
                        I'll be going now...

                        He's never even been in my bedroom.

          Now finding DR. TRAN there, a clipboard of test results

                        Sexual arousal could certainly
                        pump more endorphins into your
                        Dead Zone, Johnny.  That's probably
                        what caused those cascading
                        visions...

                        Dr. Tran was just trying to explain
                        why.  At my next appointment with
                        him, I guess.

                                        DANA
                        And his conclusion?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You wanted The Johnny Smith Dating

                                (beat)
                          Sometimes it means sharing a bed
                        with everyone you've ever slept
                        with and everyone they've ever
                        slept with.  It's like six degrees
                        of separation minus five.

                                        DANA
                        That many people, huh?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We're lucky it's a king-size bed.

          She drapes her arms around his shoulders.

                                        DANA
                        I'm sorry.

          He looks over to see Bruce wearing Johnny's old softball
          glove as he packs a ball into it... sitting on the edge
          of the bed...

                                        BRUCE
                        You rule your visions, they don't

                        Bruce says it's simply mind over
                        matter.

                                        DANA
                        With all due respect to you, Bruce,
                        I say we leave the mind out of
                        this.  The mind is what's getting
                        you into trouble.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're right.

          She pulls off his pants... Tran briefly unfreezes to say --

                        In point of fact, Johnny, these

                        visual sensory abilities in real
                        time... they can't "watch" anything

  3636EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - NIGHT

          Country music filters through a grill in a wall as camera
          pans to find Max and Saundra somewhat drunkenly and roughly
          making out.  He has her up against the wall, while her
          hands are under his shirt, pinching his nipples.  He
          groans, comes up for air.

                                        SAUNDRA
                        Like that, don't ya, cowboy?

    36CONTINUED:36

                                        MAX
                        You're a bad girl, and I'm gonna
                        do bad things to you.

                                        SAUNDRA*
                        You mean right here, right now?*

                                        MAX*
                        Well, I'd invite you back to my
                        farm but...

          And they both laugh -- it's already an old joke -- as
          Saundra finishes for him:

                                        SAUNDRA
                        ...the bank repossessed it.

          Back to the rough making out.  And in breaths in between:

                                        SAUNDRA
                        At least you're not thinking of*
                        your girl anymore, hmm?  'Course,*
                        who knows what she's up to.

          And she's just teasing, but Max reacts -- a subtle shift
          in tone.

                                        MAX
                        What do you mean?

          Saundra heedlessly plows on.

                                        SAUNDRA
                        Maybe we're not the only ones
                        being bad tonight.  Could be she's
                        getting her revenge on you, too,
                        you know.

          And suddenly Max has one hand pinning her throat to the
          wall, though his tone is still almost mild, and scarier
          for it.

                                        MAX
                        No.  All I know is you're a cheap
                        little whore who'll turn a trick
                        for a coupula shots of bourbon.

                        You're hurting me.

          And he slaps her like we saw him slap Dana in his visions,
          only this time while holding Saundra against the wall
          with his other hand.  And then slaps her again.  And again. 
          Harder and harder.

                        Stop it!  No!  Please...

          But he's choking her at the same time and the words are
          strangled.  And then his hand draws back farther...


          ANGLE ON HIS HAND

          as it comes back into frame... and closes into a fist! 
          And as the fist flies forward out of frame --


          BLACK SCREEN

            A disorienting beat as camera pans from an area of deep
          shadow to a bed and we realize we're back in:


  3737INT. JOHNNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Dana is on her side asleep, facing away from Johnny, who's
          propped up on an elbow studying her: the curve of her
            shoulder, inward curve of her waist.  He reaches out and
          lightly glides his hand over her shoulder and down her
          arm.  And INTERCUT with this motion is a startling --


  3838JOHNNY FLASH - TWO BRIGHT BLINDING LIGHTS

          coming at us filling the screen... (in fact, though we
          can't tell for sure now, these are headlights on a car.)


  3939RESUME JOHNNY

          as he reacts, we RACK FOCUS from his face to Dana's.  Her
          eyes are open, her expression uneasy; she's already begun
          to disconnect.

                                        DANA
                        Rules are rules.

    39CONTINUED:39

          It's become the signature line of the evening, but coming
          from "sleeping beauty," it startles Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I thought you were asleep.

          She rolls over to face Johnny, and the short distance
          between them seems like a gulf; we sense they both have
          qualms about where their "pretend date" has brought them.

                                        DANA
                        I'm a very light sleeper.  What
                        did you see?  
                                (beat)
                        Was it about us?  The "future"
                          perhaps?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure.  I was blinded by
                        the light.

                                        DANA
                        Light?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Two lights actually.

                                        DANA
                        Well, don't let it bother you.  

          She smiles but it is not the smile of an intimate lover...

                                        DANA
                        Cause I'll tell you the future. 
                        We're going to be the best of
                        friends from now on.  This was so
                        much fun.  Thank you.

          Wow, what a cold compliment.  Shutting him out with good
          cheer.  As she pecks him impersonally on the cheek...


  4040ANGLE - A VISION

            Suddenly, as before, every door in the room SLAMS SHUT,
          one after the other.

    40CONTINUED:40

          Then the LOCKS TURN and Johnny reacts again to the sound
          of a battery of small fists POUNDING on the other side of
          the doors, wrenching the doorknobs, as from behind each
          he also hears a little girl crying, "Let me out!  Please! 
          Let me out!" and just as suddenly, the vision ends.


          NEW ANGLE

          The room is back to normal, the doors are open.  Dana has  
          her skirt on and is briskly buttoning her blouse as she
          sits on the edge of the bed.  Johnny's look shows concern,
          for both of them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Dana, I--

                                        DANA
                        Your poor duck.  We should rescue
                        it before it's burned to a crisp.  

          He reaches for her arm, but she's already standing...

                                        DANA
                        See you downstairs.

          And off Johnny as she exits, 

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                      END OF ACT THREE          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - ACT FOUR - 6/11/02 - GOLD  44.


                                            ACT FOUR

          FADE IN:

    4141DARKNESS, TINGED BY PULSES OF RED AND BLUE LIGHT

            A crackle of walkie-talkie static, followed by:

                                        WALT (O.S.)
                        That's affirmative.  Suspect is a
                        white male, age thirty-five to
                          forty...

          During which, camera tilts down to find two EMS WORKERS
          tending to a woman on a stretcher -- Saundra.  We're:


  4242INT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - NIGHT

            Saundra's head and neck are in a stabilizing brace and
          her eyes are closed above heavy bandages, already seeping
          blood.  Another unintelligible crackle of walkie-talkie
          static as we pull back to reveal Walt in foreground,
          talking into his hand-held as he watches the EMS workers
          carry the stretcher to an ambulance, which is parked in
          the alley, its lights flashing.  Other police, crime scene
          and sheriff's department personnel and vehicles as needed.

                                        WALT
                        Witness got a partial license,
                        Maine plates, 322...

          And as he continues...


  4343EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

            A nondescript SEDAN rounds a corner, and heads down the
          street (and while at first we may not recognize this street
          from the Teaser, we'll eventually realize it's Dana's).

                                        WALT (V.O.)
                        Car is a dark-colored, late-model
                        sedan, possibly Ford Taurus or
                          Chevrolet Caprice...

          And the description matches the car we're watching, as it
          parks by the curb (and we may also see the license plate,
          which also matches, as it pulls to a stop), across the
          street and about fifty yards from Dana's building.

          The static from Walt's walkie-talkie now becomes static
          on a CAR STEREO inside:          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - ACT FOUR - 6/12/02 - WHT-2  45.


  4444INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

          As a HAND with bloody, scraped knuckles repeatedly punches
          a button on the stereo, zipping the radio from Top 40 to
          Rap to Metal and finally to country.  The HAND pauses for
          a beat, then turns up the volume.


          REVEAL MAX

          his cheek sporting several fingernail gouges, as he stares
          through the windshield at Dana's townhouse.  Max's hands
          tighten on the steering wheel as he waits, letting the
          country music "rub salt in his wounds" -- a timebomb
          waiting to explode again...


  4545EXT. SMITH HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING


  4646INT. JOHNNY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny and Dana sit finishing dinner, the candles burnt
          low now.  Dana's talking cheerfully as she eats, Johnny
          sitting back, sipping his wine as he watches her intently,
          thinking about the locked door visions, trying to figure
          out what's going on with her.

                                        DANA
                        So we'll send the photographer by
                        Monday, get some shots of you
                          cooking, or some candids around
                        the house.  

          And both of them know that something has gone out of the
          evening and that she's deliberately taken it out and she's
          hoping he'll just allow it to happen... and leave her
          alone so she can get the hell out of there unscathed and
            untouched... so she fills the space up with words...

                                        DANA (CONT'D)
                        I have a feeling your life may
                        open up a bit after this story
                        runs.

                        Why's that?

                                        DANA

          Dana knows she's being busted...

                        That's not fair.
                                (looks at him, trying
                                to reclaim control)
                          Johnny... it was wonderful, if
                        that's what you're asking.

          He just studies her evenly...

                                        DANA
                        Please.  Please.  Please.  Please. 
                        Please let's not ruin this lovely
                        evening with empty promises about
                          a future even you can't see
                        tonight... I think there's a reason
                        those lights are blocking your
                          vision... I put those lights there,
                          Johnny... I like those lights...
                        let me have my lights...

          She laughs... making a joke out of it... but it doesn't
          play.  She sighs, puts down her silverware to indicate
          she's finished with dinner...

                                        DANA
                        This was a mistake... Gene Purdy
                        was right, you need to make a
                        connection with someone... and
                        I...

                                        JOHNNY

                        I'd be happy to just have a

                        You're way too nice.  It takes a

          And damn if she doesn't wear her own self-loathing as a
          badge of honor.  Dana knows she's made a shambles of
          this... smiles and sighs.

                        I've overstayed my welcome.

          She takes out her cell phone and dials.

                        and remember what came before?

          She rises... as does Johnny.  She moves to him, part little
          girl, part hardened criminal -- a little remorseful, a
          little seductive and completely disconnected... she puts

                        What?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The bedroom.  When you were a
                        child.

          Dana understands what he's talking about - but unlike the
          child's voice we've been hearing, there is no fear, no
          horrid memories... instead she smiles...

                                        DANA
                        It was nothing... I don't know
                        why you'd even care about...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Rules are rules.

          She looks at him, she shakes her head, smiles again...
          moves into the child's bedroom... and moves to the door
          and tries the handle... it's locked... she looks back at
          Johnny who is still in the Smith House in his cutaways...
          she laughs...

                                        DANA
                        My dad used to lock me in my room
                        if he had to leave the house,
                        that's all.  To keep me out of
                          trouble.  Like any kid, you know.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Like any kid.

                                        DANA
                        It was nothing, believe me.

          She tries the lock again...

                                        DANA
                        Oh wait, is this where I'm supposed
                        to admit that I was abused or
                        something.  And that explains
                          everything?  Sorry to disappoint
                        but he didn't.  He didn't hit me.
                        He didn't lay a hand on me.

                        He didn't even like me all that
                        much.  I think I reminded him too
                        much of my mom who was about to
                        dump him.

          She shakes the door handle now with growing intensity...

                                        DANA (CONT'D)
                        I mean I hated it, sure.  What
                        little girl wouldn't.  But in the
                        big scheme of life's events, it's
                        really pretty small potatoes; in
                        fact, it's just plain stupid.

                        your father takes your little
                        sister out for ice cream.  

          She moves away from the door, frustrated angry, stares at
          it like an enemy...

                                        DANA (CONT'D)
                                (looking at the door)
                        Barely worth a second thought let
                        alone a Johnny Smith vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (evenly)
                          Sometimes the visions seem to
                        have a life of their own.

                                        DANA
                          I really have to be going...

          She tries the door again but it's still locked... and
          slams an angry fist on the door at the same time...

                                        DANA
                        I have an early interview tomorrow.

          ...and now she bangs continuously on the door... and in
          the words of the little girl she was once...

                        Let me out!  Please!  Let me out!

          And her face is panicked and red and tears are streaking
          down her face... as we reverse the 180 degree turn and

          we're back with Johnny in the Smith house, the bedroom is
          gone... and Dana is in the same proximity to Johnny as
          she was before the vision...

          Despite the interior chaos of the vision, her face is
          placid, controlled, remote.  This is the Dana Bright she
          wants to present to the world.

          She may sense that Johnny sees the real her.  But she
          doesn't want to go anywhere near it.  They look at each
          other a beat... she takes a deep breath and smiles
            easily...

                                        DANA
                          I hereby declare "My Date With
                        Johnny" over.

          Johnny gives her an unsettled half grin...


    4848INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

          As he opens the door for her...

                                        DANA
                        I'm sorry.

                        For what.

                        Just a general, cover-all-bases
                          apology.  Apply to all affected

          She touches his elbow with the only intimacy she has left
          to muster... and as she does...


4949A JOHNNY FLASH - THOSE TWO BRIGHT BLINDING LIGHTS


  5050RESUME

          Johnny reacts and she notices.

                                        DANA
                        Don't tell me.

          Dana leaves...

                        Good night, Dana.

          He watches her for a beat, then closes the door.  He walks
          back through...


  5151INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

          Where a mantle clock ticks quietly, then into:


  5252INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          He eyes the dirty dishes, the candles sputtering.  He
          blows them out, picks up his dish with one hand and hers
          with the other but when he does... Ramp to his face...


5353A JOHNNY FLASH - THE BRIGHT LIGHTS

          even closer, brighter than before...


  5454CLOSE ANGLE - DANA'S DISH

          falls from his hand, shatters on the floor...


          JOHNNY

          reacts still confused by the vision but as he starts to
          pick up the broken shards of the bowl, he's hit by --

          turns on the engine...

          - DANA shuts the door to a cab that's pulled up across
          the street from her building.  The cab drives off, Dana
          starts to cross... then turns and raises her hand as two
          bright headlights hit her...

          - CLOSER ON MAX, intent, eyes murderous as he shifts into
          drive...

          - CLOSER ON DANA, trying to see past the glaring
            headlights...          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - ACT FOUR - 6/11/02 - GOLD  52.


  5656RESUME - ANGLE ON JOHNNY'S HANDS

            Clutching the shards so tightly they're cutting into his
          palms, blood flowing... as now camera SWINGS AROUND HIM
          180 DEGREES and he finds himself in a full-on vision:


  5757EXT. DANA'S STREET - NIGHT - VISION

          Johnny finds himself standing in the middle of the street
          as Max guns his car right at him.  Johnny's briefly
            paralyzed... and Max drives right through him, as if he
          were a ghost.  Johnny whips around just as there's the
          SOUND of a car raking alongside parked cars, an ugly
          THUMP... turns to see the car speeding away and Dana lying
          on the street... as the vision ends...


  5858RESUME - JOHNNY - INT. SMITH HOUSE

          Push to a close-up as he reacts...


  5959EXT. DANA'S STREET - NIGHT - DANA'S CAB

          Rounds the same corner Max's did, and continues up the
          street, passing Max's car.  As it does, we match shots
          from Johnny's 'shard' flashes plus --


  6060INT. MAX'S CAR - NIGHT

          Max sees Dana in the cab, then turns off the country music
          and watches as the cab pulls over.


  6161INT. CAB - NIGHT

          Dana just sits in the back for a long beat, still depressed
          at the way the night ended.  (And we INTERCUT with Max as
          needed for tension.)  Then she takes some bills out of
          her purse...


  6262INT. MAX'S CAR - NIGHT

          Max sees Dana getting out, turns on his engine.  The cab
          pulls away, and Max pulls out his headlight switch.


  6363EXT. STREET - DANA

          Turns and shields her eyes as the headlights hit her,
          just as Johnny saw in his vision.          DEAD ZONE: SEX, THUGS, AND... - ACT FOUR - 6/19/02 - GRN-2  53.


  6464INT. MAX'S CAR - MAX'S FOOT

          stomps the gas.


  6565EXT. STREET - MAX'S CAR

          Surges forward.  But before he's gone more than ten yards,
          Walt's Cruiser, lights flashing, skids to a stop in front
          of him.  Max stomps on the brakes, skidding to a stop as
          well, and before he can do anything else, Walt is at his
          window, gun out and leveled at Max's head.

                                        WALT
                        Turn off the ignition, then get
                        out real slow, hands where I can
                        see 'em.


          ANGLE ON DANA

          as she watches all this from a distance... a beat later...


    6666JOHNNY'S JEEP

          roars around the corner... comes to a stop by Walt... who
          has Max out of the car and is cuffing him, as he glances
          over at Johnny in his Jeep.  (Note: Johnny's cut hand has*
          been hastily wrapped in a cloth napkin.)*

                                        WALT
                          Everything's under control.  Thanks
                        for the call.

          Johnny acknowledges, looks over at Dana who is shaken. 
          Her eyes connect with his.  She realizes that Johnny
          probably just saved her life.  Johnny drives over and
          parks behind her car.


          CLOSER ON THEM

          He's still behind the wheel. For once in her life, she
          doesn't quite know what to say.  Off her silent look...

                                        JOHNNY
                        You left before desert.

                                  meaning, as she
                                  studies him)
                        I'm watching my figure.

                        Naw, what kind of dinner would it
                        be without desert?

          Johnny gets out of the jeep.  Dana looks over to where
          Walt is shoving Max in the back of his cruiser.

                                        DANA
                        The lights...

                                        DANA
                        You were throwing plates after I
                        left?*

                                        JOHNNY
                          Dropping not throwing.

                                        DANA
                        Better.

          Max gives Dana a last angry look before Walt shuts the
          door.

                                        DANA
                        He scares me.  But in a way, you
                        know, you scare me more.

          And we're going to choose not to explain that line to the
          audience aloud but what she means by it that he's someone
          that might break through her defenses, touch her - to use
          the Johnny metaphor - in an intimate way and that scares
          the hell out of her.  But she's willing to take the risk...

                                        DANA
                        C'mon.  I've got a pint of Ben &
                        Jerry's in my freezer.  Desert's
                        on me.

          She holds out her hand.  And as Johnny takes it, and they
          walk away... we pull back and up to see Walt's car taking
          Max away... maybe hear some radio traffic about getting a
          tow truck out there to tow Max's car away... and as Johnny
          and Dana go inside...

                                                                              FADE OUT.
