Smoke plumes hang from a recent skirmish. KABLE climbs over
burning debris, gun raised, as SANDRA and the other soldiers

... a DESTROYED CITY - PHILLY? DETROIT? NY? Seemingly out
of character, he LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR SLO-MO and lands in an
OVERDRAMATIC, ROCKSTAR POSE (Nine Inch Nails, Coachella
2005).
In sequence, multicolored LEDs on his weapon COME TO LIFE -
accompanied by a low frequency hum that seems to pierce
somewhere below human hearing. The MULTIPLE TURRETS spin,
then snap into place. GO TIME.

Other BROWN SOLDIERS emerge like SNAKES out of DIRT HOLES and
INTO THE LIGHT. They crouch and spread out.

SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1

What appear like BUZZING FLIES swarm thru the grey air - at a
closer look, they are like tiny BALL BEARINGS that move like
hummingbirds, magnetically controlled. The swarm splits
apart - each FLY connects with a different SOLDIER - they
hover one foot above and two feet behind the SOLDIER'S head.

SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - COVER

KABLE slides behind a shredded telephone pole and TAKES
COVER. The sound of trains, weapons, soldiers all fade
away... until...
NOTHING.
DEAD QUIET.
SUDDENLY - A BULLET WHIZZES by KABLE's face - a pause - THEN
we hear a GUNSHOT.
Another BULLET WHIRS by his leg and another by his shoulder -
after the bullets pass, we hear the GUNSHOTS. See the
lightning, wait for the thunder.
In the peripheral a SOLDIER in DEEP BLUE CAMO runs from
behind an old car to a brick staircase.
Then another BLUE
runs the opposite way, closer in the foreground. BROWNS VS.
BLUES?? The SILENCE is crawling, deafening, and then...
BOOM.
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Suddenly we are in IRAQ TIMES TEN...
KABLE'S eyes glance down at his WEAPON - the turrets quickly
shift and rotate - he whips it up in a flash and RETURNS FIRE
into the mist:
THOOM! THOOM!
The shells puncture air and connect
distantly...

The air ripples all around him, his world closing in... he

fire.

SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - OPEN STREET
8
A couple of PEDESTRIANS walk across the street, totally
IGNORING THE VIOLENCE. KABLE makes a perfect 90 degree cut
and wraps around a street-lamp and into the alley. A BUM
holds out a can with a couple of coins and SHAKES it.
From an aerial POV we see the area swarming with BROWN & BLUE
combatants and a dozen CIVILIANS.
In the top right corner
of our frame we see the DULL REFLECTION of a FACE, somewhat
transparent, watching the battle, tungsten red (similar to
your own reflection on a TV).
We SNAP BACK to the ground - the whole area is a BATTLEZONE.
KABLE lines up another BLUE climbing the fire-escape to the
third floor window - and then, coming from the REAR SURROUND
SPEAKERS, behind us:
A VOICE - almost a whisper, too clean and distinct to be
outdoors in this environment... and TOO YOUNG to possibly
belong to KABLE.
VOICE (O.S.)
(clean, disconnected)
Eat shit please.
THWIPPP!! The BLUE drops like a sack. KABLE perfectly cuts
back another 90 degrees and runs for an old store front.
Inside a CLERK "air" bags groceries for an empty store.
A BROWN SOLDIER sets up a TRIPOD MACHINE GUN and aims for a
bunker a hundred yards north. The distant BLUE targets seem
almost robotically unaware. The BROWN SOLDIER plants his
left hand on the ground for stability, right hand twisting
the grip-lock - and squeezing the trigger: TAT TAT TAT TAT
TAT TAT!!!! TATATATATATATATATA TAT!! The BLUES fall, some
clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to the
ground, dead.
Another team of BLUES rock their heads around to focus on
him. Uh oh...
BOOOOOSH!!!! The BROWN TRIPOD GUNNER is vaporized from the
knees up... the FOREARM that supported him is standing
straight up, cleanly severed at the elbow. It slowly wobbles
over and connects with the TWO LEGS severed at the knees.
The THREE LIMBS fall into each other, forming a flesh and
bone TRIPOD.

flesh. It moves fast and vanishes into the smoke clouds.

SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - STREET

Down the road, KABLE saves an EAST-INDIAN WOMAN from getting
obliterated by shoving her out of the way of the blazing
truck. As KABLE turns to waste another BLUE, the EAST-INDIAN
WOMAN gets right back up... walking into and getting
obliterated by another TRUCK.
It's creepy - robotic, but
violent and too real - like a programmed suicide.
VOICE (O.S.)
Can't say I didn't try...
We sense emotion in KABLE'S cold eyes - then they flicker to
the peripheral.

SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - 2ND FLOOR BUILDING

Tracking along a row of blown out windows a BLUE is taking
aim; we SNAP ZOOM in...
SUPERIMPOSED OVER THE IMAGE:
The transparent GHOST OF A FACE, as though projected on
glass. The LIPS MOVE in sync with:
VOICE (O.S.)
Shit! Shit!
KABLE spins, TOO LATE -
BUT: from the level directly below the SNIPER - through an
open doorway - we see a BROWN SOLDIER, BLASTING STRAIGHT UP
THROUGH THE CEILING! The BLUE is BLOWN TO CHUNKS.
11
SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - STREET
11
The BROWN runs out and hits the curb; CONCRETE AND MEAT
collapse on the spot where she stood... it's SANDRA.
KABLE gives her covering fire as she heads his way. They
bolt for a corner - KABLE reaches protection first. He stops
to let SANDRA catch up, and in that instant -
HER BRAINS GET BLOWN TO JELL-O.
Blood and particles splatter
over KABLE's gear.

Suckage.

Without hesitation KABLE turns and wastes two more BLUES.
Up ahead HE SEES IT: an OCTAGON STEEL SHED with small
GLOWING EMERALD GREEN WINDOWS. He makes for it.
The little FLY following him is picked out of the air by a
stray shot - PLINK!
VOICE (O.S.) (cont'd)
... what the...!
Bullets and shells chop up everything around KABLE, but he's
QUICK...
A SHELL smacks his shoulder HARD, almost knocking him off his
feet - shredding the BROWN CAMO and revealing the FLEXIBLE
BODY ARMOR UNDERNEATH.
He scrambles to the octagon's entrance and BAILS IN.

KABLE steps out.
The LEDS on his weapon blink off in
sequence...
ARMED GUARDS are EVERYWHERE, rounding up the I-Con's.
[I-CONs (I-Convicts) are the combatants -- death row
inmates/lifers, of which there are never a shortage.
GENERI-CON's (Generic Convicts) are the street traffic that
lend unpredictability and realism to the battlefield... they
are computer controlled NPCs (non player characters)... petty
thiefs and criminals who are risking their lives by
participating to commute their sentences]
A DOZEN GUARDS collect weapons - TWO approach KABLE. His
eyes are pure MURDER; SANDRA'S brain matter still drips from
him.
HE WHIPS UP THE WEAPON, POINTS IT AT A GUARD'S HEAD AND PULLS
THE TRIGGER -

FADE TO BLACK.

A PRISONER - shirtless, his upper body smeared with WHITE
POWDER, screaming, SLAMS HIS FIST DOWN INTO FACE. Blood
sprays on white.
We see that he is beating down a uniformed GUARD. The GUARD
wears a black gas mask, shattered and pouring blood. Other
prisoners, shackled together, stand by watching, forming a
half circle around the fight. They are shirtless, covered in
the same white powder - they look like tribesmen.
One of the prisoners, very distinctive, nods grimly, clearly
*
enjoying the show.
DISTINCTIVE PRISONER

Fuck him up.
The prison yard is a vast expanse of white - it could be a
chalk mine, or the surface of a strange planet. Distant
towers mark the perimeter.

Other groups of shackled prisoners can be seen in the
distance, trotting along in lines. Trails of thick magenta
smoke snake across the yard, sucked by the wind.
The ROGUE PRISONER stomps down on the GUARD'S face one last
time - his shoes are made of cloth. CRUNCH. The GUARD stops
moving.
The PRISONER starts to run for it across the white terrain.
A group of GUARDS appear to round up the remaining prisoners.
They club them down with the butts of rifles but pay no mind
to the fleeing ROGUE... they merely watch him go, impassive.
In a moment, we see why - when the ROGUE PRISONER crosses
between the two distant towers he is jerked to the ground by
an invisible field. Sound? Light? Magnetism? His body
goes into spasms; blood foams from his ears, mouth, eyes.
CUT TO:

Fingers run through white powder, making patterns.
A black shadow crosses the frame, accompanied by a low hum;
some sort of aircraft.
KABLE looks up as the shadow tracks across him; we never see
the craft. He looks out across the yard.
KABLE is sitting in what seems to be a minimal REC AREA cut
out of the white terrain. He sits by himself wearing a white
cloth hoodie, eyes dark, head down, silent. Across the yard
a group of prisoners are playing basketball; EVERY SINGLE
PLAYER is SKYING for dunks.
We focus in on KABLE'S TATTOO: I Am Right Here With You...
In the yard a CRIPPLE, his two legs stiff with braces, walks
ROBOTICALLY along on crutches. KABLE watches him,
expressionless. It triggers a memory...

A LITTLE GIRL, no more than two, walks along on her DADDY'S

Kable. Kable.
We see that KABLE has drawn the pattern in his tattoo with
his finger in the white powder; at the sound of the voice he
runs his hand through it, wiping it away.
A wiry, jittery dude of indeterminate age is sitting next to
KABLE. KABLE doesn't even turn to look.
KABLE
My name is Tillman, freak.

the field is empty but for ONE MAN: KABLE.
He's busting ass around the track, pouring sweat. We're

We're cruising along with a group of YOUNG, BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE,
skating like ROBOTS through a CITY PARK... Roller-Dolly
follows HOT GIRLS in DAISY DUKES, knee socks and tube tops,
belly rings and tatoos in the small of their backs...
ATHLETIC DUDES, shirtless, gun racks and six packs...
They SWING THEIR ARMS mechanically, identically... synced
with each other and the beat of the soundtrack... each face
plastered with an absurd, exaggerated GRIN... let's FUCKING
PARTY!!!
We are in a super-saturated world... NOT virtual/animated,
but absolutely real - yet the color and immediacy of it is
heightened, off-kilter.
On the GRASS, a gang of TOKYO POP PUNK ROCKERS are having a
WATER BATTLE, blasting and soaking each other with big
plastic WATER CANNONS like something out of SLAYERS...
A REDHEAD, soaking wet, is FEELING UP HER OWN BREASTS,
totally OBLIVIOUS to her surroundings... One of the SKATERS,
out of control, PLOWS RIGHT INTO HER at full speed... The
SKATER takes a ride on concrete, grinding flesh off her bare
legs... she wobbles to her feet, EYES STREAMING TEARS but
STILL GRINNING ecstatically...
A guy in a PRIEST OUTFIT holding brightly colored helium
balloons looks on impassively; then spots something of

People are DANCING - the corniest moves ever... MAKING OUT on

This is ANGIE: 25, BLONDE/black roots... micro mini skirt,
fishnets, boots... green-eyes, haunted, with sadness behind
them; pretty - the clothes don't quite match her; it's like
someone dressed her up as a hooker.... She doesn't seem to

She strikes the same FLIRTY POSE for the second time.
DALE/GUY
We are somewhere.
He WINKS; reaches out and puts a hand on her WAIST. They
start to make out like TEENAGERS at the PROM. DALE/GUY LIFTS
UP HER SKIRT with one hand and SQUEEZES A BOOB with the
other.
He turns her around and presses ANGIE'S back up against the
base of the sculpture, ROUGH, hands all over her/inside her;
SLOBBERING down her neck and shoulders...
ANGIE just looks straight ahead... her EYES move to a nearby
building - the side is an ANIMATED BILLBOARD that has
switched to a promo for SLAYERS, with KABLE featured

She watches KABLE'S face move... she lets out an involuntary

KABLE and the GUARD are ANT-SIZED in what looks like a
massive driving range. VIRTUAL TARGETS are holographically
projected in mid-air at various heights and distances. Other
PRISONERS are there too, a ways off; well out of earshot.
KABLE looks over a Swarmer cartridge, slams it into his
weapon; switches turrets, takes a bead on a VIRTUAL TARGET...
We see him intentionally PAN THE SIGHT OFF to the left of
target; he pulls the trigger - CLICK. The TARGET - and
several others close by - turns RED, BLINKS - a HIT. This
thing doesn't just take out individuals; it takes out
VICINITIES.

KABLE

KABLE narrows his eyes, focuses across the field, where other

They spot another BROWN advancing toward a group of

Two more BLUES POP OUT of a DITCH on the OPPOSITE SIDE,

walks across the street.
FREEK

Gotta keep my holes down... keep

off a few shots - FREEK is chopped up by incoming gunfire -

hand; it skitters across the concrete.
SIMON is completely freaked - it's happening too fast, no
time to react... he tries to engage HAND-TO-HAND but every
move pings a step late...
KABLE swings a fist; HACKMAN dodges easily. HACKMAN is
moving too naturally - as if he's under his own control.
HACKMAN slams the
pipe off the side of KABLE'S head, DROPPING
HIM - then tosses
the pipe away... and pulls out a nasty,
high tech-looking
SHOTGUN. He stands over KABLE and points
the barrel at his
FACE.
HACKMAN
(friendly)
Bye Kable.
He SQUEEZES the TRIGGER...
The SUBMARINE ALARM SOUNDS.
FLOODLIGHTS CRANK UP.
The LEDs on HACKMAN'S gun POWER DOWN with an audible down-
cycle... a shell, undetonated, drops from the barrel and
plops onto KABLE'S FOREHEAD.
HACKMAN (cont'd)
What happened?

KABLE seizes the opportunity to jam a foot up into HACKMAN'S
BALLS, buckling him. He twists HACKMAN'S LEGS into a pretzel
and throws him off.
KABLE
(to himself)
Kid's gonna get me killed.
SIMON (O.S.)
(offended)
Hey.
KABLE sees GUARDS appearing and BLUES hurrying away from
ambush positions - including the one who likely fired the
mortar... session complete.
KABLE cups a hand over his mouth, conspiratorially, and
speaks directly into SIMON'S ear:
KABLE
Listen to me. I don't know who's
behind it, or why, but I was
supposed to die today. They're
gunning for us. I can beat them,
but not with you controlling me.
SIMON
What the hell...?
This is unthinkable, dangerous talk.
KABLE
Turn me loose, kid.
You want to
win, turn me loose.
SIMON
But-
KABLE
Find a way.
A GUARD grabs KABLE and the LINK BREAKS - we...
SMASH TO BLACK:

... the CAMERA pulls away, continuing the motion: we are on a
wide view of the outside of the building, a rundown
brownstone on a rundown street - animated advertising covers
half the side of the structure...
An ad for slayers is running - KABLE, in cinematic slo-mo,
and superimposed in wall-height block letters:

KABLE breaks the DAYLIGHT - but without a smooth LEAP AND
ROLL, and no ROCKSTAR POSE - instead, he TRIPS and tumbles
ASS OVER END down an embankment, landing in a heap at the
bottom.
SIMON (O.S.)
(sarcastic)
I can see turning you loose was a
great idea.
KABLE
(woozy)
What happened.
SIMON (O.S.)
YOU happened, jackass. You wanted
control, you got it.
KABLE tests his hands, clenching and unclenching - THE KID
WASN'T LYING ... while starting to trip hard on the VODKA,
which is kicking in INSTANTLY...
KABLE
No shit...
SIMON (O.S.)
Yeah, that's right. So please don't
fuck up...
An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE DIRT just a few feet away, BLINDING,
DEAFENING - and KABLE shifts into ANOTHER WORLD...
91
91
He's MOVING FAST... SOUND is just an idea, disconnected from
reality... BODIES AND BULLETS drift by without gravity... his
vision doubles and bleeds...
SIMON (O.S.)
What's the matter with you Kable?
Kill something!
BLUES. Lots of them.
KABLE starts shooting wildly - HITTING
NOTHING.

KABLE is running erratically at least... hard to HIT... but
definitely HEADED SOMEWHERE.
A SHELL SMACKS KABLE'S shoulder, knocking him off his feet;
the armor absorbs it, but he's out of time... he's shooting
air...
SIMON (O.S.)
(frustrated)
Fuck it.
We see SIMON'S fingers glide, dial up the SWARMER...
KABLE is still firing randomly as the turret shifts - the
SWARMER goes STRAIGHT UP, then locks on BLUE and swerves down
on them like HELL FROM THE SKY, turning skulls to swiss
cheese.
Too close.
SIMON (O.S.) (cont'd)
(the voice of reason)
Kable. Listen: it's the last game.
You're going to be dead and I'm
going to look like a total asshole
if you don't pull your balls
together!
KABLE
Blow me.
He scrambles to his feet and charges for the entrance to the
UNDERGROUND GARAGE.
SIMON (O.S.)
Dammit!

KABLE DRIFTS the F-250 onto the street, sideways, tires
shrieking... wiping out two unlucky BLUES... pops it and
TAKES OFF...
He is headed STRAIGHT INTO THE RESTRICTED AREA.
95

The FLY CAM is right there, taking the hot turn right on the
truck's tail, giving SIMON the POV of a classic 3D DRIVING
GAME. He activates DYNAMIC CAMERA CONTROL with a gesture -
now he can manually choose his view... he pushes the CAMERA
forward, next to the driver's window...
The CAMERA looks to the side at KABLE, driving like he's on a
mission to HELL. SIMON barks in his head.
SIMON (O.S.)
Kable, PLEASE... get back in the
game! YOU'RE SCREWING MY ASS,
KABLE!!!
KABLE ignores him; he picks up his WEAPON, points it out the
window at the FLY and FIRES... the FLY jukes out of the way,
barely... it spins off OUT OF CONTROL and SMASHES through the
window of a building. Bye, FLY.

The SUBMARINE ALARM is sounding across the BATTLEGROUND.
KABLE is heading deep into RESTRICTED TERRITORY, slamming
through and swerving around obstacles.
98

WITHOUT WARNING: a SNOWPLOW comes blasting out of nowhere
going 80, trying to ram the driver's side... it's a tick
late, clipping the back end instead, sending KABLE into a
SPIN... KABLE is knocked around in the cab and PUKES all over
the passenger seat. He recovers, straightens out and keeps
going.
KABLE
(relieved)
Ughh, that was the one.

The CAMERA is mounted on a SNOWPLOW, one of a pair gaining on
KABLE, slamming through rubble and debris.

In KABLE'S REAR VIEW: The LEAD SNOWPLOW SPINS OUT,
hemorrhaging black smoke; then SLAMS into the SECOND, sending
it into the side of a building.

105
A LOW CONCRETE WALL surrounds the perimeter, and it's COMING
UP FAST; beyond it: more abandoned urban wasteland.
KABLE has got too much speed at this point to do anything but
slam the thing SIDEWAYS into a SICK POWER SLIDE - the TRUCK
hits the barrier and FLIPS OVER IT, CORKSCREWING four times
before GRINDING TO A STOP on it's hood. The AIRBAGS DEPLOY,
smashing KABLE into his seat...
106

KABLE scrambles out of the vehicle; he spots a half collapsed
SUBWAY ENTRANCE and runs for it...
107

Behind him, two SMART MISSILES are streaking high across the
grey sky... they change direction and DOUBLE THEIR SPEED -
it's fucking HORRIFIC... and CONVERGE on the downed TRUCK in
an EYEBLINK.
BOOM.

KABLE is LIFTED OFF HIS FEET and blown into the SUBWAY
ENTRANCE, which COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.
FADE TO BLACK.

To recap: initial reports are that
Kable, the most recognizable face
of the Slayers phenomenon next to
Ken Castle himself - is officially
listed as fragged...

That's bullshit.

KABLE is standing across the street from a BEAT DOWN
BROWNSTONE, watching the second floor window.
A funky OFF-ROAD MOTOCROSS BIKE buzzes by him and up onto the
sidewalk, FARTING SMOKE. KABLE IGNORES the RIDER, who parks,
gets off, loses the brain bucket and steps up to his side.
TRACE
She's not home.
KABLE turns - the RIDER is a green-eyed 22 year-old girl w/
black rimmed WEEZER glasses; SMART AND CUTE as hell... this
is TRACE.
TRACE (cont'd)
But Castle's personal security will
be, soon enough - trust me, you
don't want to meet them.

You know, it's pretty obvious that
you'd come here first.
KABLE
Who are you?
TRACE smiles.
TRACE
You asked me that once before.

KABLE considers his options...
They TAKE OFF on the MOTO, TRACE driving.

TRACE darts nimbly thru traffic and pedestrians, finally

ANGIE is on the sidewalk, a little unsteady on high heels -
wearing the outfit GORGE CHOSE.
OTHER PEOPLE are wandering around everywhere. A DEBUTANTE-
type in a pink ensemble has a poofy SHITZU on a leash; the
SHITZU is PISSING ON IT'S OWNER'S LEG, but she doesn't seem
to notice. A TAXI speeds by with FOUR PEOPLE crushed in the
back seat having CRAZY ANIMAL SEX. ANGIE starts walking.
She passes a FAMILIAR FACE, who turns to watch her go,
without expression - is that GINA PARKER SMITH?
ANGIE walks around the corner to a BAR and goes in.

KABLE and ANGIE hit WHITE HOT DAYLIGHT. A BLUE SLAYER breaks
the corner of the building and KABLE FRAGS HIM.
KABLE grabs ANGIE by the shoulders and yells directly at
GORGE:

A SCOOBY DOO-looking VAN pulls up to the CURB in front of
them; the back doors SWING OPEN.
GINA PARKER SMITH
I can get you out.
Not much choice. KABLE and ANGIE climb in. The ELECTRIC VAN
drives quietly away, attracting no attention.

KABLE slams through CROWDS - he's on a mission. The ALLEY
leading to the UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS is right around the
corner.
GINA PARKER SMITH
Tillman!
GINA fights to catch up to him. She gets a hand on his
shoulder... he SPINS.
GINA PARKER SMITH (cont'd)
(out of breath)
Wait. I want to come with you.
KABLE'S eyes leave no room for doubt: not a chance.

That's all the story you're going

FEET from where she stands.
CASTLE'S GEEK SQUAD piles out... GINA sees them, recognizes
them from the interview with CASTLE; she TURNS AWAY just in
time to avoid being recognized by a GEEK as he scans the
crowd.
But they're not after her... they head straight for the
ALLEY.

CASTLE'S ESTATE is like a DESERTED CITY.
Balconies, underlit DOMES, lush landscaping, abstract
statues, waterfalls... tiny cameras everywhere... and not a
soul in sight.
KABLE drops over a wall and onto grass.
Wind in the leaves,
cricket music - otherwise DEAD SILENCE.
He keeps to the trees, making his way toward the central
MANSION.
THEN: the sound of DOGS... they come in a PACK, loping across
the lawn - grey, more like WOLVES...
KABLE readies his gun to take them out - but the DOGS run
RIGHT PAST HIM. They round a corner and DISAPPEAR. Weird.
KABLE looks up, spots a CAMERA... and another, and another...
stands to reason he's been MARKED already.
He walks out INTO THE OPEN.
