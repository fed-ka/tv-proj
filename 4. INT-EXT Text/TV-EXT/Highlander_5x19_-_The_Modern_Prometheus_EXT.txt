      A crowd of rock FANS mill impatiently outside the stage door. 
      Some of them wear tour t-shirts with "LORD BYRON AND THE
      UNDEAD" emblazoned in blood red.

      The stage door opens, the fans surge forward.  Two SECURITY
      GUYS move them back as

      LORD BYRON emerges, primed to brave the gauntlet.  Early
      30's, he carries a gold-handled CANE to ease his lame right
      foot.  His brooding eyes blaze with adrenalin, his slim body
      glistens with sweat.  TWO GROUPIES, rabid with excitement,
      shriek his name...

                                      GROUPIES
                    Byron!  Byron!

      He whirls, stares right at them -- they GASP, awe-struck by
      his presence.  More than a man, he's a force of nature.

      Suddenly, one young man, JERRY, breaks through the security
      cordon.  He rushes up to Byron, breathless with excitement. 
      He holds a cassette tape in his hands.

                                      JERRY
                    Did you get my tape?
                          (beat)
                    I'm Jerry.  Jerry Garrity.

      Two muscled Security Guards quickly step in and pull Jerry
      back.

                                      JERRY (CONT'D)
                          (as he's pulled away)
                    "End your confusion, love a man, not
                    an illusion."

                                      BYRON
                          (finishing the lyric)
                    "I could never be all that you dream. 
                          (to the Guards)
                    It's okay.

      They release Jerry.

                                      JERRY
                    You listened to it.

                                      BYRON
                    I thought it was great.

      His voice is deep-throated, hypnotic.  His arm wraps around
      Jerry's shoulder, draws him closer.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    C'mon, Jerry.  Let's go for a ride.

                                      JERRY
                    This is for real.

      Byron guides him to his limo.  One of the Security guys opens
      the door.

                                      BYRON
                    As real as it, gets.

      They get in the limo, pull out into the Paris night.


      Silhouetted against the deep blue-black sky, a FIGURE balances
        tightrope-style along a rain-slicked rooftop.

      It's Lord Byron.  The wind whips his hair around like an
      angry demented thing.  He raises a whiskey bottle, tips his
      head back, drenches his face in alcohol.

                                      BYRON
                    The pause that refreshes.

      He turns, offers the bottle to

      JERRY

      clutching white-knuckled onto a chimney top behind him. 
      Jerry's had a few and tries to focus.

                                      BYRON
                    Come and get it.

      Jerry gulps.

                                      JERRY
                          (beat)
                    Okay.

      He pushes off, teeters slowly towards Byron.

      WHOOSH!  A startled flock of pigeons swoop across the roof. 
      Jerry slips, loses his balance, slides towards the edge.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96517  "The Modern Prometheus"   3.  Final Shooting Script 1/7/97

1702CONTINUED:1702

      A HAND shoots out, grabs him by the arm.  Byron pulls him
      back up to safety.  Jerry's shaken, grateful, hanging on to
      Byron for dear life.

                                      JERRY (CONT'D)
                    You saved my life.

      They sit down oh the roof ledge, legs dangling over the edge. 
      Jerry looks down into the abyss... five stories to the ground. 
      Byron hands him the whiskey.

                                      BYRON
                    That's what it s about.  Living close
                    to the edge.
                          (beat)
                    Drink.

      Jerry does as ordered.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Better?

                                      JERRY
                    Sure.  Great.  Can we talk about the
                    music?

                                      BYRON
                          (not hearing him)
                    You ready?

                                      JERRY
                    Huh?

      A dark gleam in his eyes, Byron points across the alley to
      another rooftop, several yards away.

                                      BYRON
                    Let's jump.  Then we'll go lay down
                    some tracks.
                          (beat)
                    You and me.  Damon and Pythias.
                          (Jerry doesn't get it)
                    Batman and Robin.

      Jerry gets it, but hesitates.  Looks across, gauging the
      distance, then looks back to Byron, who sighs his
        disappointment.  He stands up.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    If you're not living, you're dying.

      Jerry looks up at Byron, then over the edge again.

                                      JERRY
                    I'm cool.  Really.

      Byron extends his hand.  Jerry slowly reaches out and takes
      it.

      Next thing he knows, he's on his feet looking up at the man
      he so desperately admires.  Byron's eyes, his wicked smile,
      they blast through his fear, through his doubt.

      Jerry swallows hard.  He nods, almost imperceptibly -- an
      acknowledgment of Byron's power, and a surrender of his own. 
      Byron saw it.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Good.

                                      BYRON
                    No guts, no glory.

      Byron leads him a few steps back.  Then with a running start,
      they...

      JUMP.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Geronimo!

      Jerry SCREAMS as they fly through the night air...

      LEGS KICKING, searching for a foothold,

      HANDS FLAILING, desperate for purchase,

      FINGERS REACHING OUT, straining for something solid to grab
      hold of...

      Something please God something anything...

      Nothing.  They both fall short, plummeting to the pavement
      five stories below.


      THWUNK.  Two crumpled bodies kiss the concrete.

      After a moment, Byron COUGHS back to life.  He gets up, dusts
      himself off.  He looks down at Jerry's lifeless body like a
      child looks at a broken toy.

                                      BYRON
                    That was a very good try.

      Byron picks up his cane and disappears into the evening mist.

      FADE IN:


      Byron rides along in an open carriage with his lover, CLAIRE
      CLAIRMONT.  They kiss deeply, lustily.

      Methos (known then as DOCTOR BENJAMIN ADAMS) YAWNS
        ostentatiously.  Claire GIGGLES.  Byron comes up for air.

                                      BYRON
                    I fear the good Doctor grows weary
                    of our entertainments.

                                      METHOS
                    As spectator, surely.  As participant,
                    never.

      Claire SQUEALS with mock horror, swats Methos playfully with
      her fan.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Doctor Adams!  Your effrontery shocks
                    me.

                                      BYRON
                    Shocked, are you?  You would be more
                    so if you saw him at his labors.

      Byron snuggles up to Claire again, breathes down her neck.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Cutting open corpses, up to his elbows
                    in rotting flesh and maggoty entrails.

                          (recoils)
                    No!  Truly!?

      Methos nods matter of factly.

                                      METHOS
                    There are certain questions about
                    life only the dead can answer.

                                      BYRON
                    Only the dead... and poets!

                                      METHOS
                    Then I shall have my answers when
                    the Shelleys arrive.

                                      BYRON
                    Rather, Percy Shelley and that woman-
                    child, Mary, he calls wife that you
                    seem so interested in seducing.

      They pass a couple of YOUNG GIRLS walking on the road.  The
      Young Girls recognize Byron, call out his name.

                                      YOUNG GIRLS
                    Byron!  Lord Byron!

      Byron rises to the occasion, takes the reins in one hand,
      rips off his cravat with the other, shouts...

                    "This Band, which bound thy yellow
                    hair, Is mine, sweet girl!  Thy pledge
                    of love; It claims my warmest, dearest
                    care, Like relics left of saints
                    above."

      He flings the cravat to the excited Girls and WHIPS the horses
      to a canter.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Hah!

      Suddenly, Methos and Byron get the BUZZ as

      ANOTHER COACH

      races up behind them.

      HANS KERSHNER

      a tall, powerful Immortal, is at the reins.

                                      METHOS
                          (to Byron)
                    You know him?

                                      BYRON
                    Hans Kershner.  He thinks I slept
                    with his wife.

                                      CLAIRE
                    Did you?

                                      BYRON
                          (with laughter)
                    of course!

      Byron looks to Methos.  He smiles wickedly.

                                      METHOS
                          (to Claire)
                    Hold on.

      Byron whips his horses.  They take off.  Meanwhile, in the
      other carriage

      KERSHNER

      takes the challenge and WHIPS his team up to match Byron's
      speed.  The race is on!

      Claire SCREAMS in delight, holding fast to her bonnet as the
      carriages buck and sway dangerously.

      BYRON

      is clearly thrilled by the chase as

      KERSHNER

      races up along side him, scowling.

      BYRON

      slows just a little, then drives his carriage into Kershner's.

      WHEEL HUBS knock and GRIND against each other on the narrow
      lane.  Kirshner desperately tries to hold his ground, but
      fails.  His carriage is driven off the road and crashes. 
      Kershner jumps at the last minute to safety.

      As Byron's carriage madly races in the distance, his mad
      laughter echoes.


      The carriage races up at a gallop.  Claire's voice screams
      its excitement.  Finally, the carriage halts.

      Byron, Claire and Methos tumble out of the carriage, shaken,
      breathless -- and pumped with excitement.

                                      BYRON
                    Am I as dangerous as my reputation,
                    Doctor?

                                      METHOS
                          (laughing)
                    You are mad.
                          (a significant glance
                          at Claire)
                    Are you trying to get us killed?

      Byron's eyes sparkle, his body quivering in a kind of
      exquisite ecstasy.  A mad, brilliant smile.

                                      BYRON
                    You speak of death.

      He taps the head of his cane on Methos' chest.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Yet note how quickly your heart beats. 
                    You seem more alive than ever!

      Byron draws the delighted Claire to him, kisses her roughly. 
      He pulls Claire into a passionate embrace, then they run
      laughing into the villa.96517  "The Modern Prometheus"   13.  Final Shooting Script 1/7/97



17061706OMITTED


      A dramatic sky overhangs the stone cornices of the old villa. 
      A storm is approaching, bringing distant thunder.

                                      BYRON
                          (dramatic reading)
                    The bloated mass of flesh that was
                    his body stumbled toward me.  His
                    shrill and piercing voice screaming
                    my name.  I ran in terror until my
                    legs were leaden.

      Scattered about on various chaises, Lord Byron, Claire
      Clairmont, and Methos are joined by PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY,
      small, delicate of frame, with a consumptive complexion, and
      beautiful MARY SHELLEY, listening intently, her intelligent
      eyes darting excitedly around, recording every detail.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    And I could run no more.  I turned
                    and looked into the lifeless eyes
                    and the bloodless face that was my
                    own.  I screamed.  I was already
                    dead.

      Claire applauds happily; Byron shoots her a disgusted look.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    What drivel.
                          (beat)
                    God, I bore even myself!

      Byron tosses the handwritten sheets aside.

                                      SHELLEY
                    I thought it was wonderful.  And for
                    the evening's entertainment...

      Shelley starts to pass Byron a pipe filled with opium.  Byron
      waves it away.

                                      BYRON
                    It will take more than Morpheus'
                    smoke to quiet me tonight.

      Mary turns to Methos in an attempt to change the subject.

                                    MARY
                    I trust you had a pleasant journey
                    this afternoon, sir.

                    Only if one like to dance near the
                    halls of death.

      Claire stands and pirouettes.

                                      CLAIRE
                    I love to dance.

                                      BYRON
                          (to Shelley)
                    What have you to cure a troubled
                    spirit?  For mine has been wounded
                    in life's battles.

      Claire giggles.

                                      CLAIRE
                    You cannot wound a spirit.

      Byron pulls a pistol from a desk.  In a flash he's across
      the patio, the barrel of the pistol pressed against Claire.

                                      BYRON
                    Shall we test your theory, my little
                    nymph?  Shall I kill you here and
                    now?

      Claire gasps.  Methos jumps to his feet.

                                      METHOS
                    I think we've taken this game a little
                    far.

                                      BYRON
                          (to Claire)
                    Shall I see your spirit rise up before
                    me?  And pluck it from the air?

                                      METHOS
                    Enough!

                                      CLAIRE
                    I only meant... I only...

      Under Methos' glare, Byron relents and lowers the pistol. 
      Claire breaks down, sobbing.  Mary rushes to her side, holds
      her.

                                      CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                    I do not know what I meant.

                                      BYRON
                    Shelley, the laudunum.

      Shelley produces a vial of laudanum, passes it to Claire who
      sips delicately.  Her sobbing quiets.  Byron is manic with
      energy.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Next time, preserve your ignorance
                    for one more deserving than I.

      He raises his pistol and fires.  A small statue SHATTERS.


      Lightning clashes.  Wind howls.  The old Villa looks like a
      castle against the stormy sky.

                                      BYRON (O.S.)
                    Every one, come!  Come!


      The place is closing down, everyone s coming out.  Mike tags
      along with Dawson, Methos and MacLeod, still brimming with
      excitement.

                    When I was up there, it was like
                    Clapton was in my head and I was
                    playing along.

                                      DAWSON
                    Listen, you wanna open for us tomorrow
                    night?  It's okay with Maurice.

                                    MIKE
                    Are you kidding?  I'd do anything. 
                    Whatever it takes.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (a smile)
                    I think you already did what it takes.

                                      DAWSON
                    Come on by in the morning, we'll run
                    some tunes, see how it feels.

      Mike's enthusiastic response is cut off as the club door
      opens again and Byron and the Girls emerge, heading for their
      waiting limo.

                                      BYRON
                    Hey, Mike... Wanna come jam?

                                    MIKE
                    You're serious?!

                                      BYRON
                    I'm only asking once.

                                    MIKE
                    Sure!

      As Mike moves to follow Byron --

                                      DAWSON
                    See you in the morning.

                                    MIKE
                    I'll be there.
                          (head spinning)
                    I can t believe this is all happening.

                                      DAWSON
                          (a little concerned)
                    One thing at a time, okay?  Don't
                    get crazy.

                                    MIKE
                    Sure, yeah.

      Byron starts to leave.

                                      BYRON
                    Now or never, Mike.

                                    MIKE
                          (to Dawson)
                    I gotta go.

      He hurries off after Byron, gets in the limo.  MacLeod looks
      to Methos.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Arrogant son-of-a-bitch.

                                      METHOS
                    Most geniuses are.
                          (a shrug)
                    He's connected.  He could make Mike's
                    career with one phone call.

      Dawson watches the limo pull out into traffic, unable to
      conceal a touch of concern.

                                      DAWSON
                    Yeah, kid's in the big time now.


      Byron and Mike balance along a slippery railing.

      The Girls stand nearby, champagne in hand.

                                      BYRON;
                    How do you like it?

      Wide-eyed Mike looks down.

                                    MIKE
                    I'm too scared to tell.

                                      BYRON
                    Hah!  Of course you are!  Scared...
                    to... DEATH!

      He flings his arms wide like some giant leather bird of prey.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Suck it in, man!  Savor the fear!

      Mike hesitates.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    You can do this.

                    Look deep.  Let it fly.

      Mike gets caught up in the moment.  He mimics Byron, arms
      outstretched, head thrown back.  The wind whips his hair.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)

      Mike lives a moment of sweet ecstasy...

                    Feel it.

      Then, Mike slips.  Loses his footing, topples off the rail --

      Byron catches him by his belt, pulls him back to safety.  He
      spins Mike around, grips his face, locks on with those tractor
      beam eyes of his.  A voice like dark thunder...

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    You were there.

      Mike nods excitedly.

                                    MIKE
                    What a rush!  What s next?

                    Now you are alive.  Now we play!


      The patio stones are slippery under the falling rain.  Byron
      and Kershner struggle for footing as they dodge and parry. 
      Methos watches from the front steps.

      ANGLE ON THE FRENCH DOORS

      where MARY watches secretly.

      BACK TO SCENE

      as Byron presses Kershner to his knees.  He struggles to get
      up, loses his balance...

      BYRON

      knocks KERSHNER S SWORD from his hands and presses the point
      of his sword to Kershner's throat.

      Mary GASPS in wide-eyed horror.

      METHOS

      hears her, sees her watching.  He calls to Byron:

                    My Lord!

      Byron looks up, sees Mary, potential witness.

      A BEAT.  Then, through clenched teeth, to Kershner...

                    I give you your head.  Leave now,
                    and live.

      Byron relaxes his stance, turns his back on Kershner and
      heads for the patio doors.  But Kershner's no man of honor. 
      He scrambles over to where his SWORD lies...

      Mary watches Byron approach.  Over his shoulder, she sees
      something FLASH in the moonlight.  Steel.  Suddenly, her
      hand flies to her mouth as...

                                      KERSHNER (O.S.)
                      Arggggghhhhhh!

      Byron arches his back as Kershner s SWORD strikes a mortal
      wound.

      Mary makes as though to run forward.  Methos grabs her, holds
      her back.

      Kershner withdraws his sword.  Raises it for the killing
      blow.

      BYRON

      using every last ounce of life left, swivels around, brings
      his sword up with both hands,

      WHOOSH!

      and takes KERSHNER'S HEAD.

      BYRON falls dead.

      ANGLE ON

      a horrified MARY, struggling to pull away from Methos as he
      tries to drag her away

      ZAP!

      A LIGHTNING FLASH freezes her in her tracks.  Another FLASH
      illuminates the carnage before her as the awesome power of
      the QUICKENING twists and contorts Byron's lifeless body
      like a dancing dead thing.

      And then, it's over.  The lightning ends.  The thunder stops. 
      Only the wind and the rain remain.

      Mary stands stunned, having seen it all, Methos still holding
      her.

      FADE IN:


      Methos kneels by Byron.  Mary s blanched face, stares at
      them, stunned beyond belief.

                                    MARY
                    How...

      Byron stirs weakly.  Mary stares at the wound in his chest,
      now healed.

      Methos takes her hand.  She recoils from his touch.

                                    MARY (CONT'D)
                    He lives.  Yet I saw...

                    A trick of the storm.

                                    MARY
                    I am not Claire!  Do not speak to me
                    like a fool!

      He nods his acknowledgment.  No lies.

                                    MARY (CONT'D)
                    I saw him die, and live again.  While
                    my little Clara lies buried in her
                    grave.

                    How can he live!  While my flesh and
                    blood turns to dust!  Explain this!

      Methos grabs her hands, speaks earnestly.

                                      METHOS
                    There is no explanation.
                          (the best he can do)
                    He is not governed by the laws of
                    mortal flesh.  His kind is different.

                                    MARY
                    How do you know this?  How can you
                    know this?

      He looks in her eyes, cannot deny her the truth.

      Mary looks from the recovering Byron to Methos.  Sees the
      truth in his eyes.  Her anger gives way to tentative wonder.

                                      METHOS (CONT'D)
                    I beseech you, tell no one.  We must
                    live in secret.

                                    MARY
                            (understanding)
                    Or you would be hunted.

                                      METHOS
                    For the perversion of nature that we
                    are.

                                    MARY
                    How many years have you walked this
                    earth?

                                      METHOS
                      Centuries.
                          (beat)
                    Too many centuries.

      Mary meets his gaze.

                                    MARY
                    Poor, tormented creature.  The sad
                    hero of a never ending story. 
                      Resurrected by lightning to eternal
                    life and eternal loneliness.

      She reaches out to touch his face, to comfort him.

      Before Methos can speak, Byron coughs back to life,
        interrupting the moment.  He sits up, taking in the scene.

                                      BYRON
                    An interesting bit of entertainment
                    this was, I wager.

      He rises, does his best to brush off his sodden clothes.

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Come, there is a fire inside, and
                    stories to tell.
                          (to Mary)
                    If you have one.

                                    MARY
                    I do.  Mine will be about the anguish
                    of immortality.

                    And what, Mary Shelley, will you

                                    MARY

      MacLeod and Methos buy a couple of crepes from a street corner
      vendor, walk and talk.

                                      METHOS
                    Didn't think you two would hit it
                    off.  Matter and anti-matter.  Put
                    'em in the same room... kaboom!

                    Your friend is a mess.

                    He's pathetic.

                                      METHOS
                    It would be easy to think so.

                    Do you remember what it's like to be
                    so hungry it hurts?
                          (off MacLeod's nod)
                    Byron feels like that all the time. 
                    Twenty thousand people screaming his
                    name, and it's not enough to fill
                    that hole inside him.
                          (beat; you'd almost
                            think he'd been there)
                    Always wanting more.  Always needing
                    more.

                    No thanks.

      Methos pauses, searches his memory quickly, recites...

                    At what price?


      Pouring RAIN.  Booming THUNDER.  Dazzling FLASHES Of
      lightning.  But the most dramatics element of all is

      LORD BYRON

      naked to the waist, hugging a lightning rod anchored to the
      roof.  Byron tosses his head back, lets out a PRIMAL HOWL
      like a wolf from hell.

                                      BYRON
                      Ahhhhhhhh!  C'mon, old man!  Come
                    get me!  Are you there?!

      Another FLASH of lightning streaks across the sky.  Over the
      noise of the rain and thunder Byron SHRIEKS to the heavens...

                                      BYRON (CONT'D)
                    Coward!

      He runs his TONGUE along the wet lightning rod.

      He turns his scowling face to

      MIKE

      standing off to one side, drenched and miserable.

                                      BYRON
                    "Daddy" doesn't like you playing in
                    my sandbox.

                                    MIKE
                    I didn't tell them to come.  I swear.

                                      BYRON
                    Details, kid.  I don't need the
                      aggravation, know what I mean?

                                    MIKE
                    But they don't understand.

                                      BYRON
                    Of course they don t.  They never
                    will.  Because they're dead and they

                    What do you want, Mike?

                    Are you ready to grab onto life with

                                    MIKE
                    I'm ready!

      Byron lets go of him, shoves him away.

                                      BYRON
                    I don't think so.  You want to play
                    in the big time, gotta be a big boy.
                          (beat)
                    Go home, kid.

      A brilliant FLASH of lightning directly overhead.  Byron
      SCREAMS to the thunder, to the heavens.

      Mike watches for a moment, then leaves.


      MacLeod and Dawson are approaching the club together.  As
      they reach it, Mike Paladino peels out of the doorway.  He's
      pissed.

                                    MIKE
                    Thanks for nothing, you guys.

      MacLeod knows Dawson doesn't deserve that tone of voice.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You have a problem?

                                    MIKE

                    life playing in dives like this,
                    that's fine.  But I don't.

      He turns to storm away.  A HAND reaches out, grabs him roughly
      by the arm, spins him around.  It's MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD

                    Let go.

                    You think Byron gives a damn about

      His face conflicted, Mike doesn't answer.  He turns and walks
      off.  Dawson calls after him.

                                      DAWSON (CONT'D)
                    Hey.

      Mike looks back.

                    You're still opening tonight.

      Mike hesitates, then keeps on walking.


      Mid-scene, Dawson talks to MacLeod.

                    Mike never showed up?

                    What the hell.  Maybe I shoulda
                    figured.  Who'd choose my life over

                    He wouldn't be here if it wasn't for

                    You think all this is about right
                    and wrong.  It's not nearly that
                      significant.
                          (beat)
                    In the end, this --
                          (pointing his sword
                          at MacLeod)
                    Is all that matters.

      Byron lunges, MacLeod deflects the blow, knocks Byron a bit
      off balance.  But years of compensating for his lame right
      foot have made Byron extremely dexterous.  He twists in the
      air, comes back ready to attack.

      MacLeod puts his back into it, goes at him with a series of
      rapid swings.  CLANG!

      Byron's SWORD is knocked out of his hands, goes flying through
      a car window.  Glass SHATTERS.

      MacLeod swings, takes Byron's head.

      The QUICKENING begins.

      LIGHTNING dances overhead.

      FLOODLIGHTS Pop And EXPLODE in the electrical storm.

      B.g., the excited crowd CHEERS at the spectacular LIGHT SHOW
      high in the sky above the stadium.

      Back on the ground,

      MACLEOD convulses in a paroxysm of ecstasy as he receives
      the strange wild sacrament that was Byron's essence.

      All the brooding, flamboyant intensity of one of the world's
      great artists... and all the despair and melancholy inherent
      within.
