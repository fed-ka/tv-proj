      A swell of manicured lawn borders an ornamental garden. 
      Bulrushes grow along the edges of a man-made lily pond. 
      On the shore, two men, swords clanging, flashing, clashing.

      MacLeod is battling GRAHAM ASHE, a dashing swashbuckler,
      an Immortal Errol Flynn.  The best swordsman MacLeod's
      ever seen.  MacLeod is struggling, sweating.  He's
      frustrated and tiring but he's not going to give up.  Never
      give up.

      MacLeod feints, and follows up with a QUICK STRIKE... that
      Ashe easily slips -- with a smile to make matters worse.

                                            ASHE
                        A very nice effort, young Duncan
                        MacLeod of the Clan MacLeod.

      MacLeod turns and comes back at him.  Ashe deflects him,
      causing MacLeod to lose his balance and go tumbling.

                                            ASHE
                          Personally?  I'd never use the
                          Thracian Attack on terrain like this. 
                        It was meant only for an uphill
                        strike.

      MacLeod engages in the conversation only because he needs
      a moment to recover and regain his fighting composure.

                                            MACLEOD
                        It is meant for whenever it works.

                                            ASHE
                        Well, it doesn't on level ground,
                        now does it?

                                            MACLEOD
                        I slipped.

                                            ASHE
                          Precisely my point.

201CONTINUED:201

                                            MACLEOD
                        How do you know what it was meant
                        for?
                              (getting it)
                        Ah.  You're the one who meant it. 
                        You invented it.

      Ashe takes a gracious, elaborate bow.

      MacLeod takes advantage of the lapse to attack and moves
      in quickly.

      Ashe counters with a single swipe that sends MacLeod's
      sword flying.  Disarmed, there is nothing MacLeod can do
      as

      ASHE

      Brings his great sword SLASHING through to MacLeod's neck --

      AND STOPS

      A hair's breadth short of skin.

      There is a moment of genuine suspense and then Ashe bursts
      out LAUGHING and MacLeod joins in.  We see now that these
      two are friends and MacLeod is here learning, not fighting
      for his head.

                                            ASHE
                        It was really Juan Ramirez who
                          perfected it.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (impressed)
                        You knew Ramirez?  Juan Sanchez Villa
                        Lobos Ramirez, Connor's teacher?
                            (off Ashe's nod)
                        I hear there was nothing he couldn't
                        do with a sword.

                                            ASHE
                        Or with the ladies.
                            (a smile)
                        He was one of my better students.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You were his teacher?
                              (blown away)
                        No wonder I'm losing here.

      Ashe flips MacLeod's sword back to him, then kneels to his
      sack and hauls out a wine flask, bread and other goodies
      as they sit on the grass to relax a little.

201CONTINUED: (2)201

                                            ASHE
                        I'm good, my friend, but trust me,
                        there are better than me out there.
                              (beat)
                        As the Kurgan was better than Ramirez.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Great.  Just my luck, I'll run into
                        them.

                                            ASHE
                        Cheer up, the sword is not what you
                        live for, it's just what keeps you
                        alive for the good stuff.

      He tosses MacLeod some  bread.  As they sit to eat --

                                            MACLEOD
                        Which is?

                                            ASHE
                        There are worlds out there for you
                        to discover, Duncan.  Music.  Art. 
                          Philosophy.

                                            MACLEOD
                        What good is philosophy in a fight?

                                            ASHE
                        We fight to stay alive -- don't forget
                        to live.  Imagine what you can see
                        in a thousand years.  Imagine what
                        you can learn.  The ideas, the
                        questions, the meaning.  It's all
                        there for us, Duncan, because we are
                          blessed.  Blessed beyond reason with
                        the gift of eternal life.  It is
                          something to be cherished not for
                        what it is, but for what it can be.

      He hands MacLeod the wine.

                                            ASHE (cont'd)
                        And every year brings something new --
                        a new vintage, a new fighting move...
                        or a new pattern of flowers on an
                        Italian hillside.  Open your eyes,
                        see it.  Cherish it.

      MacLeod is thoughtful as he swigs the wine, Ashe's message
      sinking in as he savors the flavor, the spring wind across
      his sweated shoulders, the smell of the day.

      Suddenly, they pick up a BUZZ.

      ASHE

      moves up into a crouch to scan the area and spots --

      TWO HORSEMEN

        Approaching.  The first is HARESH CLAY, a turbaned Moor,
      riding tall and strong on charger, an exotic cloak doing
      little to conceal the regal and imposing figure underneath. 
      Beside him rides CARTER WELLAN, his squire, a younger
      Immortal, a pale Briton with straw-colored hair.  He carries
      Clay's standard.

                                            CLAY
                        When the Duke challenges you to a
                        game of darts, your job is to lose.

                                            WELLAN
                        But he was half blind.

                                            CLAY
                              (laughing)
                        But he is still the Duke.

      They laugh.

                                            WELIAN
                              (looking around)
                        My lord.

                                            CLAY
                        I know.

                                            WELLAN
                        We found him.

                                            CLAY
                          Perhaps, my impatient friend.

      ASHE

      Freezes and all the humor is suddenly gone from his face.

                                            ASHE
                        Dear God.  Haresh Clay.

      He signals MacLeod to be silent.  MacLeod is confused. 
      This hardly seems like a courageous command.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Who?

                                            ASHE
                              (urgent)
                        Shhh!  We have to get out of here. 
                        Find some holy ground.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96502  "The End of Innocence"  5.    Final Shooting Script 7/11/96



201CONTINUED: (4)201

      He slinks off.

      MacLeod, confused, hesitates.

      Ashe grabs his arm and pulls him along.

                                            ASHE
                        Now!

      MacLeod is astonished to see Ashe fearful, but if Ashe is
      scared, that's clue enough for him.



      MACLEOD AND ASHE

      Hurrying.  They look back over their shoulders for some
      sign of pursuit but there is none.

                                            ASHE
                        Damn.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I don't see him.

                                            ASHE
                        That's what bothers me.

      MACLEOD AND ASHE

      Come over the small rise just a short distance from church
      grounds and safety.

                                            ASHE
                        We're safe.  It's going to be all
                        right.

      But it's not.  There in front of them, are Clay and Wellan. 
      Ashe stops suddenly.

                                            CLAY
                        Graham Ashe?

                                            ASHE
                        Who?

      MacLeod is stunned by this response.  Ashe sees it.

                                            ASHE
                              (wearily)
                        I am Graham Ashe.

                                            CLAY
                            (to Ashe)
                        I've been looking for you.  There
                        can be only one.
                              (beat)
                        We were destined to meet one day.

                                            ASHE
                        The best day is always the one you're
                        in.

      Clay couldn't agree more.  He dismounts, a picture of grace,
      his movements bespeaking a quiet grace and power.  He holds
      out a hand toward Wellan.  Wellan pulls Clay's sword and
      hands it to him.  Clay holds it at the ready.

                                            ASHE
                              (pushing MacLeod)
                        Go!
                              (urgent)
                        Get to the church yard and stay there. 
                        And don't come out.

      He shoves MacLeod to get him moving, then draws his sword
      and turns to face Clay.  MacLeod hesitates.

                                            ASHE
                        GO!

      MACLEOD

      Obviously upset and confused, stumbles reluctantly to Holy
      Ground --

      THE CHURCH GROUNDS

      Are hardly more than a gesture.  All that remains is a
      couple of walls and the cemetery.  Just enough to take
      refuge.

      ASHE AND CLAY

      Engage and it is immediately apparent that this is truly a
      contest of masters.

      They exchange blows, testing each other.  It's Ashe who
      finds himself moving backwards, pressed by the attack.

      ASHE

      Is cut, a deep gash on his balance arm.

      MACLEOD

      Is beside himself at the church.  To see someone better
      than Ashe with a sword is astonishing.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96502  "The End of Innocence"  7.    Final Shooting Script 7/11/96



202CONTINUED: (2)202

      ASHE

      Tries a desperate thrust and Clay disarms him.  He falls
      to his knees, defeated.

      MACLEOD

      Is paralyzed at the church.

      CLAY

      Raises his sword to take Ashe's head.

      ASHE

      Cries out.

                                            ASHE
                        Spare me!

      Clay is startled.  He stays his sword a moment.  He puts
      his sword to Ashe's neck, lifts him, forces him to speak
      louder.

                                            ASHE
                        Yes... please spare me.

                                            CLAY
                              (astonished)
                        You'd beg for your life?

      MACLEOD

      Can't believe what he is witness to.  It is utterly
      shattering to him.

      Ashe swallows any pride, any honor he has left.  He wants
      to live.

                                            ASHE
                            (from the heart)
                        I don't want to die.
                              (desperate)
                          Anything I have to give, I swear it. 
                        Just let me walk away.  I beg you to
                        let me live.

      MACLEOD

      Reels in dismay.  His hero, begging.  It looks for a moment
      like Clay might spare him.  Then --

      swings, silencing Ashe's pleas.

      MACLEOD

      Presses against the church wall as Ashe's Quickening lights
      the sky behind him.

      CLAY

      Suddenly comes around the wall, Ashe's sword in his hand. 
      Wellan is a few paces behind, holding Clay's horse.

                        Don't worry boy.  I came for Ashe.

      MacLeod stares at him, still stunned by what he's seen,
      unable to react -- and, in truth, scared to death.

                                            CLAY (cont'd)
                        But I have something for you.

      With utter contempt, Clay takes a huge swing with the sword
      he's holding.

      With no sword drawn to defend himself, MacLeod calls out:

      Comes smashing down into the huge wooden beam Clay is aiming
      for.

      above him.

      MacLeod and Coltec face off.  Instead of their dialogue,
      we continue to hear V.0. the dialogue from Joe's.

                                            MACLEOD (V.O.)
                        When we take heads, we take the
                        Immortal's power.  You take in too

      Coltec circles, looking for an opening.  MacLeod slips
      past Coltec's guard -- and takes his head.

      REFRAME

      As the Dark Quickening hits MacLeod.


      Somewhere down the road.  The station's been forsaken ever
      since the freeway got built several miles to the south.

      RED JEEP WRANGLER

      in mint condition pulls in.  Wellan guns the engine and
      steps out, waiting.

      Seconds later, Richie arrives on his bike.  He too guns
      his engine before shutting down.

                                            RICHIE
                              (gesturing)
                        After you.

      Richie is simmering and Wellan wary.  They make their way
      around to the field behind the station.

      Wellan is still reluctant as Richie draws his sword.

                                            WELLAN
                        Is it worth losing your head over a
                        Bad joke?  We don't have to do this.

                                            RICHIE
                        Yes, we do.

      He attacks and they close with a great clash of swords.



      Immortal HARESH CLAY pulls up to Delila's and heads inside. 
      This is an updated Clay, sporting a close-cropped fade,
      gold-hoop in one ear.  Still with the manner and bearing
      of a king.

      Richie and Carter Wellan are going at it with a vengeance. 
      It's a nasty, no holds barred fight to the death.

      They're locked in a death struggle, face to face, hands
      locked on one another's swordarms, muscles straining to
      gain the advantage.

      WELLAN

      Wrenches a knee into Richie's groin and Richie splits away,
      gasping for breath.

      WELLAN

      Lunges but Richie sidesteps him and hammers the passing
      Wellan hard in the kidneys as he goes by.

      The blow straightens Wellan up and leaves him completely
      exposed as Richie turns back and rams the sword home.

      WELLAN

      Slumps to his knees.

      RICHIE

      Raises his sword for the final blow.

      DOWN THE HIGHWAY

      Haresh Clay is running this way when he sees --

      THE SKY ERUPT with a QUICKENING.

                        Carter!

      Unsure, agonizing over the outcome, he draws his sword as
      RICHIE thunders by on his screaming bike.

      Furious and horrified by his friend's death, Clay watches
      Richie disappear down the road, and SCREAMS his rage to
      the wind.

      The BUZZ gets stronger.  He's ready for anything, except
      what he finds there --

      MACLEOD

      Waiting for him.  Richie is freaked.  He wasn't expecting

      As he laughs, the two ride off, leaving MacLeod with his
      shame.

      It's very early morning.  Barely dawn and the quiet
      dominates everything.  The street is deserted.

      There is nothing going on except for the man trying to
      pick the lock at one of the doors.  A banner at the entrance
      reads:

      THE LOCK-PICKER

      Is Richie and it turns out he's good at it.  A jiggle here,
      a poke there, and he's in.



      The back door flies open and Richie comes racing out into
      the alley.

      He turns right and runs like hell.

      A COP CAR, lights flashing, turns into the alley just up
      ahead.

      Richie stops.  He looks at the cops.

      He turns back to see:

      RICHIE'S POV - CLAY

      standing at the far end of the alley.

      BACK TO SCENE

      Richie makes absolutely the right choice.  As the cops
      step from their car, he turns back to the cops and raises
      his arms.

                                            RICHIE
                        You got me.

      As the cops push Richie into the car, he turns back and
      blows Clay a kiss.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        ACT THREE

      FADE IN:



      MacLeod is on the street, leaning up against his car.  He
      has stood bail for Richie and is waiting for him.

      When Richie comes out he's a little... conflicted.

                                            RICHIE
                              (grudging)
                        Thanks for standing my bail.

                                            MACLEOD
                        You're welcome.

                                            RICHIE
                        I'll pay you back.

                                            MACLEOD
                            (with a forced smile)
                        You bet you will.

      This is not easy.  It's uncomfortable for both of them.

                                            RICHIE
                        So... alright.  Guess I'll see you.

      MacLeod isn't willing to let it go at that.

                                            MACLEOD
                        I was thinking we might go for a
                        drive.

                                            RICHIE
                        I don't think so.

                        I... I can't.  I got things to do.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Richie, please.
                              (beat)
                        There are things you need to know.

                        Hey, if the bail comes with a lecture
                        I'd just as soon wait it out in a
                        cell.

      He starts to walk away.  MacLeod stops him.

                                            MACLEOD
                        The guy who's after you.  Haresh
                        Clay.  I met him once before.

      That does pique Richie's interest.

                                            RICHIE
                        Then how come you're both still alive?



      MacLeod and Richie are off in the distance, walking along
      the beach.  We hear their-conversation in V.0.

                                            RICHIE
                        So, your friend was good.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Graham Ashe was a master.  I never
                        saw anyone like him before.  I thought
                        he was the best.  I thought he'd
                        live forever.
                            (a beat)
                        Until Clay showed up and took his
                        head.

      ANGLE MAC AND RICHIE

      as we catch up to their conversation.

                                            RICHIE

                              (beat)
                        It was unbelievable.  Impossible.

                                            RICHIE
                        You never went after him?

                                            MACLEOD
                              (tight)
                        No.

                                            RICHIE
                        Why?

                                            MACLEOD
                              (avoiding)
                        He would have killed me then, and
                        he'll kill you now.

                        Maybe Ashe wasn't as good as you
                        thought he was.

                                            MACLEOD

                        But Clay was better.  Richie, you
                        can't win.

                                            RICHIE
                        Everyone's entitled to his own
                          opinion.

                                            RICHIE
                        Forget it Mac, the days of you
                        protecting me are long gone.

                                            MACLEOD
                        This is not about protecting you,
                        Richie, it's about me.
                              (beat)
                        I have to finish this.

                        Then you better find him before I
                        do.

      The conversation ends as they find themselves back at
      MacLeod's car.

      MACLEOD

      Hesitates a moment.  Then he opens the trunk and takes out

      ASHE'S SWORD.

      He turns to Richie.

                                            MACLEOD
                        If you get there first... you'll be
                        needing this.

                        It used to belong to Graham Ashe.

      RICHIE

      Hesitates -- this is a problem, it gets him right in the
      heart.  His knee-jerk reaction is to reject the sword.

                                            RICHIE
                        I can take care of myself, Mac.

                        Take it.  Please.

      That stops Richie.  This isn't a command, it's a request,
      man to man.  Richie looks at MacLeod, looks at the sword --
      it's a beauty -- and finds the strength to accept it.

                                            RICHIE

      Immaculate, a variety of new and used cycles lined up for
      display.

      The owner, RAYMOND FAIRCHILD, looks more like a surgeon
      than a cycle mechanic as he works on the guts of a bike
      laid up on a stainless steel table.

                        I want to buy my bike back.

      Raymond looks at him, unimpressed.  Turns back to his work
      with a shrug.

                        Twenty four hundred.

      Richie slaps some cash on the counter.

                        There's the eighteen you gave me.
                        Give me the keys.

      Raymond looks at the money, looks at Richie.

                        This isn't a pawn shop, kid.  The

      He points to one of the beat-up bikes in the line.

                        the busted transmission.  Three
                        hundred more to get her running.

      Richie looks at him for a beat.  Raymond's bent over his
      work, doesn't see Richie's expression.  Big mistake.

                                            RICHIE
                        Maybe you didn't hear me.

      As he speaks, Richie moves along the line of bikes, ending
      up at the gas pump.

                        I said I want to buy my bike back.

                        kid.

      He pulls the nozzle off the pump, clicks it on, and swings
      it in an arc.

      Gasoline sprays over the line of motorcycles, puddles around
      them.  Puddles around Richie.

                                            RAYMOND
                        What the hell are you doing?

      Richie pulls out a Zippo.

                        Got a light?

      He clicks the flint.  A spark, a flame.  Raymond's eyes go
      wide.  He backs up a step.

                                            RAYMOND
                        You're not gonna throw that.

      Richie holds the lighter, ready to toss it into the pool
      of gas.

                                            RICHIE
                        You think so?

      He's got him.  Raymond pulls out the keys, tosses them to
      Richie.

      Richie nonchalantly tosses him the still-flaming lighter
      and turns to go.

      Raymond scrambles for the lighter and catches it just before
      it hits the ground.96502  "The End of Innocence"  38.    Final Shooting Script 7/11/96

      away to hear what's going on.

      IN THE FOREGROUND

      MacLeod's car screeches to a halt right behind Richie's
      bike.  MacLeod jumps out and catches up to Richie as he
      starts to head across the grass.

                            (in his face)
                        You want to know what I thought when
                        Ashe went down like that?  How could
                        he do that to me?  He was supposed
                        to be stronger than that.  He was
                          supposed to be invulnerable.

      Gone is the reasonable, placating tone; gone is trying to
      convince Richie.  This is MacLeod on the warpath.

                                            MACLEOD
                        If he could be broken like that,
                        what did that mean for me?  You know
                        what that feels like?

                                            RICHIE
                        Like you can't trust anything anymore. 
                        Like your best friend trying to kill
                        you.
                              (beat)
                        Get out of my way, Mac.

                                            MACLEOD
                            (over him)
                        You think this is about protecting
                        you?  It's not about you.
                              (beat)
                        You want to fight Clay, get in line.

      MacLeod turns away from Richie and moves purposefully across
      the grass to where

      CLAY

      Kneels beside a fresh grave.  The monument above it reads
      "CARTER WELLAN BELOVED FRIEND." He is a man in deep and
      solemn sorrow.

      He turns as he gets the BUZZ, sees MacLeod and Richie
        approaching.

                                            CLAY
                        Duncan MacLeod.  I heard you were
                        around here.
                            (a beat)
                        You've come a ways since we last
                        met.

                                            MACLEOD
                        We have unfinished business.

                                            CLAY
                        My fight is with your friend here.
                            (to Richie)
                        You had no quarrel with Carter Wellan.

231CONTINUED: (2)231

                                            MACLEOD
                        And you had no quarrel with Graham
                        Ashe.

                                            CLAY
                        You're condoning what he did?

                                            MACLEOD
                        He hasn't done anything we haven't
                        all done.  He fought to the death.

      Clay shakes his head.  Turns to the grave.

                                            CLAY
                        You know what it's like to have a
                        friend for nine hundred years,
                          MacLeod?
                              (choking up)
                        I'd known Carter longer than you've
                        been alive.  He was my squire and my
                          companion on a hundred campaigns on
                        five continents.  We swore to stand
                          together forever.
                            (to Richie)
                        And now he's gone, because of you.

                                            RICHIE
                        If you want a fight, you've got it. 
                        Crater or no Carter.

                                            CLAY
                              (inclines his head)
                        When you're ready.
                              (beat)
                        Either of you.

      He turns and walks away from the grave, off holy ground. 
      Richie starts to follow.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Richie.

      MacLeod hesitates.  This isn't easy.

                                            MACLEOD
                        He shamed me.  I watched Clay kill a
                        good friend.  I watched Graham Ashe
                        beg for his life... and die.  And
                        afterwards I did nothing.
                              (beat)
                          Nothing.
                            (man to man)
                        I'm not telling you to let me do
                        this.  I'm asking you.



                                                                (CONTINUED)96502  "The End of Innocence"  48.    Final Shooting Script 7/11/96

      They look at each other a long beat.  It is the moment in
      which they can both feel the bond return, and the trust.

                                            RICHIE
                              (makes this his gift)
                        After you.

      MacLeod is touched.  Grateful.

                                            MACLEOD
                        Thank you.
                              (beat)
                        You'd be safe here.  On holy ground.

      Richie just shakes his head.  Uh-uh.

                                            MACLEOD
                              (resigned)
                        If he takes me, he'll take you.

                                            RICHIE
                        Then you better not let him.

      Macleod turns and walks after Clay.



      MacLeod and Clay emerge from the cemetery and cross through
      a stand of trees into the privacy of a fairly secluded
      clearing.

      They face each other and draw their swords.

                                            CLAY
                        You think today is the day to do
                        what you couldn't do 350 years ago?

                                            MACLEOD
                              (quoting Ashe)
                        The best day is always the day you're
                        in.

      They close and engage.

      Clay comes right at him.  Powerful.  Aggressive. 
      Determined.  And it's not enough.

      MacLeod parries every blow, slips every charge, and remains
      absolutely cool and in control.

      Clay backs off, and MacLeod domes at him.  Slicing. 
      Slashing.  Dominating.

      Backing away, Clay starts up the small hill at the edge of
      the clearing.


                                                                (CONTINUED)96502  "The End of Innocence"  49.    Final Shooting Script 7/11/96

      MacLeod comes after him.

      Suddenly, Clay realizes the superiority of his position. 
      Fighting from the uphill position restores his confidence
      and he resumes his aggression.

      And MacLeod welcomes him.  Lures Clay into a charge and
      responds with Ashe's Thracian Attack.

      He buries his sword deep in Clay's belly.

      Clay drops his sword.

      MacLeod pulls his free, and Clay stumbles down the incline
      and falls to his knees.

      CLOSE ON MACLEOD

      MacLeod hesitates.  He looks at Clay on his knees.  He
      wants to give him an out.

                                            MACLEOD
                        We've both lost someone.

      CLOSE ON CLAY

      as he looks up.

                                            CLAY
                        But there can be only one.

      MacLeod finishes it.  A moment later it begins, a stunning
      Quickening that ends in RUMBLE and LIGHTNING.  The world
      goes dark.  It's as if night has fallen.  Finally, it is
      over, and MacLeod is left standing, exhausted.  And free.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
