Valiant emerges from the stage onto a bustling Hollywood
studio lot where CARTOON CHARACTERS (TOONS) and humans are
comingling as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
Valiant stops by an Acme Novelty truck which is unloading
Toon props.
There are bombs, rockets, flattened pocket
watches, anvils, giant slingshots, etcetera.
The license
plate is California 1946.
He fishes out a pack of
Chesterfields and taps out a half a butt that had been
stubbed out.
As he lights it, Valiant regards a chubby,
balding man wearing a three-piece suit and a worried
expression coming towards him.
He is R.K. MAROON, studio
boss.
Maroon is leading an entourage of ASSISTANTS trying to
keep up.
MAROON
Starting tomorrow there'll be no more
roast beef lunches.
What happened to
cheese sandwiches?
I was raised on
cheese sandwiches.
As the Assistants dutifully record his thoughts, Maroon sees
a GUY taking a nap in the shade of a palm tree.
MAROON
(continuing)
And tell that guy sleepin' over there
he's fired!
ASSISTANT
It's your wife's brother, R.K.
MAROON
(reconsiders)
Oh... tell him he's promoted.
But get
him out of my sight.
As the Assistants disperse, Maroon approaches Valiant.
MAROON
Valiant, did you see the rabbit?
VALIANT
He was blowin' his lines, all right.
So what?
MAROON
So what?
He's already put me three
weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
Now an EDITH HEAD-TYPE hustles up to show Maroon several
costume designs.
COSTUMER
Your reaction, R.K.?
Maroon quickly checks out the drawing.
MAROON
No!
That's not funny.
She flips another drawing.
MAROON
(continuing)
That's funny.
Put a homburg on him
it'll even be funnier.
Huh, Valiant?
He grabs the pad and shows Valiant.
The rendering is of a
hippo in a pink polka-dot tu-tu.
VALIANT
(deadpan)
Yeah, that'd be a riot.
Maroon responds to Valiant's sarcasm with raised eyebrows.
MAROON
Boy, I hope what you have ain't
contagious or I'll be out of business.
He hands the pad back to the designer, who departs.
MAROON
(continuing)
How much do you know about show
business, Valiant?
VALIANT
Only there's no business like it, no
business I know.
Valiant watches an ALLIGATOR in a rebel uniform dragging a
brace of cannons and several TOADSTOOLS parade by.
MAROON
Yeah, and there's no business as
expensive.
I'm twenty-five grand over
budget on the latest Bunnysitter
cartoon and it's all because that
rabbit can't keep his mind on his work.
And you know why?
VALIANT
One too many safes dropped on his head?
MAROON
Nah, that goes with the territory.
He's a stunt bunny.
Maroon takes a copy of the "Hollywood Tattler" out of his
pocket.
MAROON
(continuing)
Here's the problem...
(reads)
"Seen cooing over calamari with
notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica
Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".
(looks up)
His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's
Betty Crocker.
The doubt's eatin' him
up.
VALIANT
So what do you want me to do?
MAROON
Get me a couple juicy pictures.
Somethin' I can wise the rabbit up
with.
VALIANT
I don't work in Toontown.
MAROON
You don't have to.
The rabbit's wife
sings at an underground Toon revue
joint called The Ink & Paint Club.
You
can catch her in action there.
VALIANT
The job's gonna cost you a hundred
bucks.
MAROON
A hundred bucks?
That's ridiculous.
VALIANT
So's the job.
Valiant starts to walk away.
MAROON
All right, all right... You got your
hundred bucks.
Maroon turns, snaps his fingers.
His Assistant appears out
of nowhere with Maroon's checkbook and a pen.
The Assistant
turns and stoops so that Maroon can write the check on his
back.
MAROON
(continuing)
Fifty now, fifty when you deliver the
pictures.
Maroon tears the check off and hands it to Valiant.
Suddenly
Valiant ducks in reflex to a large shadow that passes
overhead.
MAROON
(continuing;
chuckles)
Kinda jumpy aren't you, Valiant?
It's
just Dumbo.
ABOVE THEIR HEADS - DUMBO
swoops back and forth, then hovers, ears flapping like a
hummingbird.
MAROON
I got him on loan from Disney.
VALIANT
Aren't you the lucky one...
Valiant grabs the check from Maroon and starts for the gate.
MAROON
When will I hear from you?
VALIANT
As soon as is humanly possible.
We FOLLOW Valiant out the gate under a wrought iron sign that
reads "Maroon Cartoon Studios".
As he starts across the road
he's almost run over by a Toon roadster that ROARS out of the
gates.
When it BLASTS ITS HORN, it's the FIRST FIVE NOTES
from the WOODY WOODPECKER SONG:
"HA-HA-HA-HA-HA".
Valiant
jumps back as the roadster passes.
WOODY THE WOODPECKER'S
behind the wheel with a self-important smile on his face.
Valiant angrily waves the cloud of Toon dust away.
VALIANT
(coughs)
Damn Toons.
ACROSS THE STREET - A TROLLEY CAR
is slowing to a stop in front of the studio.
It's a Pacific
and Electric "Red Car", part of a vast system of electric
trollies that once criss-crossed the L.A. Basin.
Valiant
steps onto the "Red Car".
He reaches into his pocket to give
the CONDUCTOR his nickel fare.
But he comes up with a
handful of lint.
He holds out the check.
CONDUCTOR
What do I look like, a bank?
The Conductor jerks his thumb toward the door.
Valiant
suffers the public humiliation,of having to step down past
the rest of the boarding passengers.
He walks around to the
back of the Red Car where a gang of TEN-YEAR-OLDS are
loitering.
When the BELL SOUNDS and the Red Car starts to
pull away, the Kids make a dash for a place on the cow
catcher.
Valiant joins them.
We HOLD as the Red Car moves
away and the street urchins regard their older partner in
crime with curiosity.
DISSOLVE TO:
A BILLBOARD SIGN
It reads:
"L.A.'s Pacific and Electric Red Car -- America's
Finest Public Transportation System".
PAN DOWN to see that
the sign is on the roof of the trolley terminal.
Red Cars
are going in and out of the shed.
MOVE IN on one car
approaching the terminal from down the street.
As it passes
by...
VALIANT
hops off his freeloader's seat on the back,
KID
So long, mister.
Valiant waves laconically.
VALIANT
Thanks for the cigarettes.
We FOLLOW Valiant as he crosses the street to a seedy
bungalow.
A note is push-pinned to the door.
CLOSE - NOTE
It says:
"Tomorrow's Friday... Well?
Dolores".
VALIANT
takes the note and walks back across the street toward the
terminal.
He climbs up a flight of stairs, heading for a bar
on the mezzanine.
The bar sports a red neon sign that used
to blink, "The Terminal Station Bar".
But now it just says,
"Terminal".
Valiant knocks on the door of, a non-descript building in a
run-down factory area.
A speakeasy style peephole slides
open REVEALING the face of a TOON GORILLA.
Valiant offers
the password.
VALIANT
Walt sent me.
The peephole slides closed and after a beat the door swings
open.
Valiant comes flying out the door and CRASHES into a bunch of
garbage cans in the alley.
The Gorilla stands in the doorvay
regarding the dazed Valiant.
GORILLA
And don't lemme catch your peepin' face
around here again.
Got it?
VALIANT
Ooga-booga.
The Gorilla slams the door.
Valiant picks himself up out of
the garbage.
He brushes himself off, then starts down the
alley toward the rear of the building.
We FOLLOW him around
the corner where he stops under Jessica's dressing room
window.
He drags over a milk crate to stand on, takes a
small camera out of his pocket and opens the bellows.
He
stands on the crate and aims the camera through the corner of
the window, as we HEAR the MUFFLED CONVERSATION from within.
ACME (O.S.)
Are we going to play pattycake tonight?
JESSICA RABBIT (0.5.)
Marvin, I have a headache...
ACME (O.S.)
(hurt)
But you promised...
JESSICA RABBIT (O.S.)
Oh, all right.
But this time take that
hand buzzer off...
Valiant's eyes widen in disgust.
VALIANT
Jesus Christ...
As he starts CLICKING pictures...
CUT TO:
There's one light on in the Administration building.
An L.A. police car turns into the yard of the Acme factory
and pulls up in front of the old factory building.
There's
all kinds of official activity in the yard... cop cars, a
Coroner's truck, etcetera.
Valiant and Santino get out of the police car.
Santino
starts into the factory.
But he realizes Valiant's not
following him.
He turns to see Valiant looking over the wall
behind the factory, transfixed.
LT. SANTINO
Now what?
VALIANT
Just haven't been this close to
Toontown for awhile.
VALIANT'S POV
The sky above the wall is a different color, a little bit
more vibrant, a "Toon Blue", you might call it.
SANTINO
walks back and takes Valiant's arm.
LT. SANTINO
Let's go, somebody wants to see you.
Santino leads Valiant into the factory.
Doom leads them outside and indicates a window.
DOOM
... then stood out here waiting for his
prey.
After he cold-bloodedly
accomplished his task, he went home.
He was almost apprehended there by my
men.
Doom nods his head toward a group of sinister WEASLES (a la
Disney's "Wind In The Willows").
They're loitering by a
dogcatcher's wagon with "Toontown Control" on the side,
cleaning their fingernails with switchblades and polishing
Toon revolvers.
VALIANT
Men?
They look more like weasles to
me.
DOOM
Yes, I find that weasles have a special
gift for the work.
(turns back to
Valiant)
The rabbit didn't contact you by any
chance, did he?
VALIANT
Why would he contact me?
I just took
some lousy pictures.
DOOM
So you wouldn't have any idea where he
might be?
VALIANT
Have you tried Walla Walla?
Kokomo's
very nice this time of year.
Doom steps into Valiant's face.
DOOM
I'm surprised you aren't more
cooperative, Mr. Valiant.
A human has
been murdered by a Toon.
Don't you
appreciate the magnitude of that?
My
goal as Judge of Toontown, has been to
rein in the insanity.
To bring a
semblance of law and order to a place
where no civilized person has ever been
able to step foot.
The only way to do that is to make the
Toons respect the law.
Suddenly a "YA-HA-HOOEY" interrupts his pontification, as a
scruffy little TOON GOPHER comes hurtling over the wall from
the Toontown side.
He's holding his blackened rear end...
apparently the result of a run-in with a stick of dynamite.
BONK!
The Gopher hits Doom in the back of the head, sending
them both sprawling.
The Gopher picks himself up and shakes
off the effects of the concusion.
When he sees who he's
knocked down, he panics.
GOPHER
(petrified)
Judge Doom!
Here, let me get that for
ya.
He whips a clothes brush out of his back pocket and furiously
tries to clean the Judge's cloak.
Doom picks up the Gopher
by the scruff of the neck and gets to his feet.
DOOM
Why, you filthy little vagrant, you've
soiled my robe!
GOPHER
It's cleanin' up real good. Judge.
DOOM
You've defiled a symbol of justice.
As Doom carries the Gopher to the "Toontown Control" wagon,
Valiant shoots a look to Santino.
VALIANT
(aside)
Where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
LT. SANTINO
No one knows.
He bought the election
a few years back.
He's been rulin'
Toontown ever since.
When Doom gets to the wagon, the Weasles open up the back.
In place of steel bars is a stream of fluid.
A Weasle turns
a key and the flow of liquid stops.
The Gopher starts
kicking furiously, trying to avoid the lock-up.
GOPHER
Oh, no, Judge, please, please, lemme
go.
I think I hear my mother callin'
me.
Finally, the Gopher breaks free and makes a desperate dash
for the wall.
Doom watches him run and calmly turns to where
his car is parked.
It's a black Lincoln touring car with an
ugly bird-like hood ornament.
DOOM
Voltaire... the Gopher!
Suddenly. the hood ornament SQUAWKS to life.
It's a hideous
TOON VULTURE.
The Vulture flaps into flight.
Just as the Gopher is about to make it over the top of the
wall the Vulture's talons sink into his rear end and lift him
airborne.
The Vulture drops the Gopher off with the Weasles.
They pin him down.
GOPHER
Hey, don't I have any rights?
DOOM
Yes, you do... to a swift and speedy
trial.
One of the Weasles retrieves a briefcase from the sedan, puts
it on the hood and snaps it open.
Twelve TOON KANGAROOS pop
up, arranged in a jury box.
DOOM
(continuing)
Court is now in session.
He raps the Gopher on the head with the gavel end of his
cane.
DOOM
(continuing)
The defendant is charged with vagrancy,
assault and resisting arrest.
How do
you find him?
The Kangaroo court delivers the verdict instantly. Twelve
LITTLE KANGAROOS pop up out of their Momma's pouches, holding
up small cards, each with a letter spelling Y-O-U A-R-E
G-U-I-L-T-Y.
DOOM
(continuing)
Guilty as charged.
Case closed!
Doom slams the briefcase shut.
He turns his attention back
to the Gopher.
DOOM
(continuing)
I hereby sentence you to the dip!
GOPHER
Oh no, not the dip!
Anything but the
dip!
I'm too young to die...
As the Judge pulls on a black rubber glove, the Weasles take
out a stainless steel tub WHEEZING with sadistic glee.
They
fill it from a spigot on the truck.
VALIANT
What's with the dip?
LT. SANTINO
That's how he gets rid of the
troublemakers.
It's a combination of
acetone, turpentine and paint remover.
He calls it the...
Final Solution.
THE GOPHER
is wriggling and SCREAMING bloody murder as Doom lifts him up
and holds him over the tub.
Then, as he's lowered into the
solution, he starts to disappear. His pathetic SCREAMS are
snuffed MID-YELP.
GOPHER
Help!
Help!
He...
The Gopher's gone.
All that's left of him is a paint slick
on the surface of the liquid.
VALIANT
Jesus.
Doom pulls off the black rubber gloves finger by finger and
hands them to a Weasle.
He turns to Valiant.
DOOM
They're not kid gloves, Mr. Valiant.
but that's how we handle things in
Toontown.
I would think you'd
appreciate that.
He gets into his car, he pauses and looks back at Valiant.
DOOM
(continuing)
After all, didn't a Toon kill your
brother?
The Weasles are filing up the walk to the front door.
The
leader pounds on the front door.
WEASLE
Police...
The Weasles open the violin cases and take out real tommy guns
and shoulder them in teams of two.
Suddenly they unleash a
torrent of MACHINE GUN FIRE, making the outline of a weasle
in the door with BULLETS.
The leader blows on the cut-out
and it falls in.
The Weasles file through one by one.
Eddie and Roger, handcuffed together, are beating it down the
alley.
Roger, being a rabbit, is beating it a lot faster.
He's kicking up dust, his legs are blur.
Valiant stumbles
trying to keep up.
When they round the corner, Roger slams
on the brakes, Toon style.
Valiant goes skidding past him and
is jerked to a stop like a dog on a short leash.
VALIANT
Hey!
What do you think you're doin'?
ROGER RABBIT
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a
Toon.
VALIANT
Don't ever forget that.
come piling out the window.
They start sniffing the ground.
Suddenly one of them freezes on point, like a dog.
Another
blows a HUNTER'S HORN and they're off on the trail.
emerge from the alley.
They pause momentarily to
reconnoiter.
Eddie decides to go left, Roger right.
When
they get to the end of the cuffs, they snap back into a pile.
Valiant gets back to his feet and hauls Roger up angrily.
VALIANT
This way, goof...
They start across the street.
But Roger goes on one side of
the Street sign, Eddie the other.
Roger coils around it like
a tether ball.
Valiant yanks Roger off the sign and they
duck across the street just as a trolley car passes.
THE WEASLES
come bloodhounding around the corner.
They search the street
for signs of the fugitive.
But when they get to the trolley
tracks, they stop, bewildered.
WEASLE #1
Scent's cold.
WEASLE #2
Pssst.
He points toward the trolley car pulling into the Terminal
Station.
They fall all over themselves scurrying over to the
trolley.
They surround it and jump aboard, tommy-gun at the
ready.
as it pulls away.
The Weasles look around perplexed.
WEASLE #1
Funny... I could swear I smelled
rabbit.
ANGLE FROM ABOVE
Eddie and Roger are balanced on the trolley wire above the
Weasles' heads.
As the Weasles sniff around the barn, Eddie
and Roger ease along the wire, using the wall of the Terminal
Bar to lean on.
A CARHOP wheels a yellow Packard up in front.
Maroon climbs
in and ROARS off.
Valiant ENTERS THE FRAME.
He looks after
Maroon, then calmly starts walking down the driveway.
A Red Car pulls up.
Valiant climbs off.
He calmly crosses
the street and ducks behind the cemetery entranceway as
Maroon's Packard ROARS through.
VALIANT
(impressed)
Love that Red Car.
As Valiant starts to walk up the hill...
CUT TO:
THE ACME FUNERAL SITE - LONG SHOT - DAY
A hearse, and a line of black limos are parked in the lane.
Nearby, Marvin Acme's funeral is in progress.
Clustered
around a gravesite are the mourners... TOONS of every stripe.
There's MICKEY MOUSE comforting MINNIE.
TOM AND JERRY.
HECKLE AND JECKLE.
CHIP 'N DALE.
Everyone from the famous
to the not so famous is in attendance.
The eulogy is being
delivered in a familiar blustery Southern VOICE.
It's
FOGHORN LEGHORN.
FOGHORN LEGHORN
Today we commit the body of brother
Acme to the cold, I say cold, cold
ground.
We shed no tears for we know
that Marvin is going to a better place.
That high, high, I say that
high-larious place up in the sky.
Foghorn Leghorn dramatically points skyward.
TOONS
(in unison)
A-men!
NEW ANGLE - VALIANT
is leaning up against a palm tree on the hill.
We have been
watching the proceedings from his POV.
Now he sees Maroon's
car pull up.
He moves around to the other side of the tree
as Maroon passes and starts wending his way through the
crowd.
AT THE GRAVESITE
Foghorn Leghorn nods to the funeral DIRECTOR, a pasty-faced
human in a black mourning coat.
The Director starts to turn
the crank lowering the coffin into the grave.
FOGHORN LEGHORN
Give us a sign, brother Herman, that
you've arrived...
Much to the funeral Director's amazement, the crank starts
PLINKING Out the tune to "POP GOES THE WEASLE".
Now the Toon
mourners pick up on it and join in.
TOONS
(singing)
Round and round the mullberry bush, The
monkey chased the weasle...
The crank and SONG start going FASTER AND FASTER.
TOONS
(continuing;
singing)
The monkey raid it all was in fun.
POP!
Goes the weasle.
Suddenly half of the lid to Acme's coffin flies open and a
harlequin CLOWN BOI-YOI-YOINGS out.
The funeral Director
faints dead away as the Toon SOBS turn to LAUGHTER.
The
Toons turn and head away from the grave comforted by a
funeral befitting a gag king.
They climb into their cars and
SCREECH off like the start of the Indy 500.
One mourner is
left at the gravesite.
Sitting in a chair dabbing at her
eyes with a handkerchief is Jessica Rabbit.
Maroon walks up
behind her.
MAROON
So... trying to pull a fast one on me,
huh?
Jessica turns, startled.
She stands and faces Maroon.
VALIANT
smiles and leans in.
This is the moment he's been waiting
for.
Now just as the conversation begins, it is drowned out
by the NOISE from a LAWN MOWER.
Valiant turns to see a
GARDENER riding around on a small tractor cutting the grass.
Valiant tries to flag him down as he watches Maroon and
Jessica having an arguement.
There's accusatory finger
pointing.
In pantomime, Maroon gestures into his pocket as
if describing the position of Acme's will.
Jessica tries to leave.
He grabs her arm.
They're screaming
at each other but we don't hear a word.
Valiant waves
frantically for the Gardener to cut the machine.
But the
Gardener misconstrues it as a friendly greeting and waves
back.
Valiant turns in time to see Jessica kick Maroon in
the groin and stomp off to a red Auburn Speedster.
She jumps
in and speeds away as Maroon staggers back to his car.
The
Gardener stops the tractor next to Valiant.
He SHUTS OFF THE
ENGINE.
The cemetery is completely still again.
GARDENER
Somethin' you want, mister?
VALIANT
Not anymore...
A Steinway piano truck is parked next to the stage door.
TWO
husky PIANO MOVERS are rolling a baby grand up the ramp to
the stage door.
They knock on the door.
The Gorilla opens
it and they muscle the piano inside.
After a moment, they
reemerge.
We FOLLOW them back to the truck where a second
baby grand stands ready to be moved.
MOVER #1
I don't know about you, but it makes me
sick to think of these beautiful pianos
gettin' chopped into match sticks every
night by those screwy ducks.
Struggling, they push this second piano into the club.
The Toon Control Wagon streaks along with the cat SIREN
WAILING.
It flashes by then slams on the brakes at the
entrance to an eerie tunnel.
A sign next to the tunnel says:
"Toontown".
The wagon disappears into the murky darkness.
PAN UP to the
night sky.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE SKY - MORNING
PAN DOWN to the tunnel.
We can't see into the darkness but
we HEAR HOOTING and HOLLERING from within.
GUNS going off,
FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING, WHIPS CRACKING, all accompanied by
the WHEEZING LAUGHTER of the Weasles.
WEASLE #1 (O.S.)
Soo-eey!
Soo-eey!
WEASLE #2 (O.S.)
Let him go, boys.
I think he's got the
message.
After a beat, Valiant comes staggering out of the tunnel.
He's got a burlap sack over his head tied around his waist.
Behind him, the Weasles emerge holding paint cans and
brushes.
They watch as he trips and falls by the side of the
road.
The Weasles GIGGLE victoriously and head back inside.
Valiant lies there for a moment, catching his breath.
Then
he struggles to free his hands.
Finally he rips the sack off
his head and sits up.
CLOSE - VALIANT
We see he's got a huge Toon pig with a goofy grin painted
over his head.
Valiant pulls and tugs on it, but this is a
costume that won't come off.
Valiant curses, gets to his
feet and stumbles down the road.
Valiant gets in the back of the line of PASSENGERS boarding
the Red Car.
Eddie and Roger race down the stairs and toward the Toon
Control Wagon which is parked in front of Doom's Lincoln,
ROGER RABBIT
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'.
Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the
noodle, the grey matter...
VALIANT
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin'
from the law with a Toon?
Valiant opens the door of the Toon Control wagon, and flings
Roger inside roughly.
Eddie and Roger come racing around the side of the wagon.
Valiant searches the back of the truck for the on/off switch.
He finds it and turns off the flow of acetone.
The Roadster
zips out of the truck and lands on the pavement, already
flexing and limbering.
Behind him, a comical number of other
TOON DETAINEES hop out like midgets out of a Volkswagon.
They all head for the hills.
ROADSTER
Well... what're we waitin' for, the
William Tell Overture?
ANGLE ON TERMINAL BAR - THE WEASLES
come piling out.
They stack up like an Indian totem pole
searching every direction.
One of them spots Eddie and
Roger.
The Weasles stumble all over themselves in a mad
scramble down the stairs.
EDDIE AND ROGER
hop into the sleek two-seater.
Valiant looks at the myriad
of goofy cartoon gauges and switches on the Roadster's
dashboard.
VALIANT
What do I do?
ROADSTER
You don't have to do nothin'...
With a ferocious RUBBER BURNING SQUEAL, the Roadster ROARS
off in "no frames".
The exit is so fast that Eddie and Roger
are left behind, hanging mid-air.
But before they hit the
ground, the Roadster zips back INTO FRAME.
Eddie and Roger
fall back into their seats.
The Roadster bends around so his
grill is facing them.
ROADSTER
(continuing)
Uh... except hang onto your hat.
The Roadster ROARS off again in a cloud of Toon dust.
Santino's car does a 180 degree spin, and goes after the
Roadster.
The second squad car follows.
The Weasles pile
into the Toon Control wagon and join the chase.
Benny is leading a merry chase up and down the hills.
Beside
the two Motorcycles, there are half a dozen squad cars.
But
as Benny comes over the last rise, we see the road deadends
at Echo Park Lake.
The police have blocked off the
perpendicular streets with squad cars.
Eddie and Roger see
the deadend fast approaching.
Roger covers his eyes with his
ears.
Valiant braces himself.
VALIANT
The brakes!
The brakes!
Benny hits the brakes.
Smoke pours out as they burn up and
the momentum is barely broken.
ROADSTER
Forget the brakes, who brought the
water wings?
The Roadster SMASHES through the wooden guard rail and sails
out over the water.
KERPLOP!
It splashes down in the lake.
THE POLICE CARS
SCREECH to a stop at the edge of the lake.
Santino jumps out
and regards the floating Roadster.
He turns to the other
cops with a smirk.
When he turns back again, the smirk
disappears from his face.
ANGLE ON LAKE
Benny is calmly swimming away using his fenders to do the
crawl.
Now they pass a spooning COUPLE in a rowboat.
The
couple regard them open-mouthed.
THE EDGE OF THE LAKE
Benny nears the shoreline, touches bottom and wades out.
When they hit dry land, Benny shakes off like a dog.
He REVS
HIS ENGINE.
ROADSTER
Maybe it's my imagination, but I always
seem to run better after I've had a
wash.
(turns)
Now where can I drop you cats?
As Benny ROARS off...
CUT TO:
Benny peeks around the corner, then tip-toes into view. down
the alley until he stops in front of a back door.
Eddie and
Roger climb out.
VALIANT
Thanks, Benny.
ROADSTER
If you ever need me, just stick out
your thumb.
WHOOSH!
Benny is gone.
Valiant goes to the door and unlocks
it.
As he and Roger head up the back stairs...
CUT TO:
The lot is dark and deserted.
Now headlights cut through the
darkness as Maroon's Packard pulls up in front of the
Administration building.
Valiant hops into Maroon's Packard.
He hits the starter
button and takes off after Jessica.
NEW ANGLE
as the car pulls away, the trunk lid lifts.
Roger Rabbit
peers out, disoriented.
Then closes it.
Jessica's car speeds along.
Valiant is in close pursuit in
the Packard.
He's about to catch up on the straightaway when
Jessica's car disappears into a tunnel.
VALIANT
slams on his brakes.
The Packard goes fishtailing, finally
spinning to a stop at the foot of the "Toontown" sign.
Valiant gets out of the car.
He looks down the tunnel.
He's
sweating.
He loosens his necktie.
He paces back and forth
at the tunnel mouth.
He looks up at the Toontown sign and
suddenly smashes it with his fist.
It spins around like a
weathervane.
Valiant walks to the Packard with purpose.
He grabs the
black bag and puts it on the hood.
He opens it and takes out
the wooden box.
CLOSE - BOX
as the clasp is popped and the box opened, REVEAL a stunning
presentation model TOON .38 resting on crushed velvet.
It's
everything a real gun could be... and more.
Each feature is
exaggerated... the barrel, the cylinder, the ivory grips are
all Toon-sized.
VALIANT
picks the gun up and hefts it respectfully.
Then he opens an
ammo section in the wooden box. SIX TOON .38 DUM-DUM BULLETS
are in velvet creases.
The Toon Bullets blink to life as if
awakening from a long sleep.
DUM-DUM #l
(rubbing eyes)
Eddie... is that really you?
VALIANT
Uh-huh.
DUM-DUM #2
What year is it?
VALIANT
'46.
DUM-DUM #3
Who won the war?
DUM-DUM #4
Who do you think, dummy?
DUM-DUM #5
Welcome back, Eddie.
DUM-DUM #6
Where you been the last five years?
VALIANT
Drunk.
He opens the cylinder.
VALIANT
(continuing)
Feelin' frisky tonight, boys?
DUM-DUMS
Yeah!
The Bullets eagerly dive into their respective chambers.
He
snaps the cylinder closed, reaches into his shoulder holster
and takes out the pint bottle.
He unscrews the cap and pours
the rest of the booze onto the ground.
When it's drained, he
flings the bottle in the air and FIRES the Toon .38.
KA-POW!
It makes a SOUND like a CANNON.
THE TOON BULLET
climbs like a rocket into the dark sky.
It SCREECHES up to
the bottle, puts on the brakes.
The Bullet puts on a
jeweler's eyepiece, then it whips out a little hammer and
chisel acd delivers one delicate tap.
VALIANT
watches as a cut glass chandelier falls out of the sky and
CRASHES at his feet.
Valiant holsters his weapon and climbs
into the Packard.
He puts it in gear and pulls into the
tunnel.
IN THE TUNNEL - DRIVING
As Valiant heads toward the proverbial light at the end of
the tunnel, suddenly the CAR RADIO COMES ON.
RADIO ANNOUNCER
... From the tippy tip top of
Toontown's Tip Top Club, this is Mellow
Melody Matinee.
Here's our favorite
cricket, Jimmy, with 'Give A Little
Whistle'.
JIMINY CRICKET
(on radio)
'When you get in trouble, and you don't
know right from wrong...'
Valiant turns the on/off switch, then punches all the buttons
but to no avail.
The SONG PLAYS ON anyway.
JIMINY CRICKET
(continuing)
'... Give a little whistle
Give a little whistle...'
VALIANT
I hate Toontown...
As Jimmy croons on, Valiant emerges from the tunnel.
VALIANT'S FOV
Through the windshield we see we have arrived in Toontown,
where it's a beautiful sunny day.
Eddie is now driving down
a phantasmagorical boulevard in a completely animated world.
It's a Max Fleischer version of a city neighborhood.
The
trees and buildings are swaying in time with the MUSIC.
Eddie looks to his left and sees a huge Aphrodite-like hood
ornament on the front of a TOON CAR.
Then as the car starts
to pass him he sees hood... hood... hood... more hood then a
CHAUFFEUR, then more car, and finally the Wolf we remember
from the Ink & Paint Club.
He's in top hat and tails, a TOON
LAMB in the passenger seat.
He tips his hat.
WOLF
Helloooo, cousin.
Now he drives past a Toon building under construction.
Like
everything else in Toontown. the construction company sports
the name "Acme".
The sign out frontsays:
WATCH OUR
PROGRESS.
Eddie looks up, and before he can drive by, the
building gets built floor by floor with accompanying SFX in
about two seconds.
Up ahead, the street is clear for blocks.
Then suddenly cars
pour out of all side streets at once, clogging the boulevard
like arteriosclerosis.
There is mad HONKING in this cartoon
traffic jam.
Eddie shakes his head.
He pulls over, parks
and gets out.
Valiant pulls out his Toon .38.
Suddenly, the street empties
in the blink of an eye.
Shutters close, and the sidewalk
rolls up like window shades.
It's so quiet you could hear a
pin drop.
In fact, a PIN DROPS from a second story window,
landing with the CLANG! of a manhole cover.
All is quiet
again.
Valiant starts across the street -- there is a CREAK
behind him.
Valiant whirls around, levelling his pistol at
the sound.
ANGLE ON PACKARD - ROGER
peeks out of the trunk of Maroon's car.
ROGER RABBIT
Don't shoot, Eddie.
It's me.
Valiant lowers the gun as Roger emerges.
VALIANT
What the hell are you doin' in there?
ROGER RABBIT
I followed you to the Maroon Studios.
When I heard those shots, I thought I'd
help you and investigate the inside of
this trunk.
Valiant reaches into the black bag in the car.
He comes out
with a pair of TOON HANDCUFFS.
He slaps one on Roger's
wrist.
ROGER RA13BIT
(continuing)
Hey, what're you doin'?
Valiant drags Roger to the steering wheel.
VALIANT
I'm making sure you don't help me
anymore.
He locks the cuff to it, and heads across the street.
AROUND THE CORNER - VALIANT
stops at a street sign.
The post is bristling with fingers
pointing in different directions; i.e., Poughkeepsie,
Transylvania, Walla Walla, South Pole (the finger points down
of course), and finally a finger which says:
The Dame.
Eddie follows the finger down the side street to a high rise
building.
He catches a glimpse of Jessica darting into the elevators.
Valiant hustles inside after her.
Valiant goes to the elevators, and watches the floor
indicator spinning round and Round, finally stopping with a
BING at the 125th floor.
The elevator doors open and Valiant
steps on.
IN THE ELEVATOR
Valiant punches 125.
Suddenly the elevator takes out with
such velocity that Valiant is thrown to the floor.
After a
moment, it stops so fast that he hits the ceiling.
Then
bounces back to the floor as the doors open.
He picks
himself up and steps off the elevator.
He's in a foyer with four doors.
Valiant opens the first and
steps inside.
He disappears.
NEW ANGLE
Valiant is on the outside of the building hanging onto a
flagpole for dear life.
He looks down at the street which
looks miles below.
Valiant inches back along the flagpole to
the door and pulls himself to safety.
INSIDE - VALIANT
tries the next door.
This time more carefully.
A SPEEDING
TRAIN is coming right at him.
He slams the door.
He tries
the next one.
A homely OLD TOON LADY is in a bathtub.
She
lets out a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM.
Valiant closes that door
quickly, and turns to the last.
When he opens this one, we
HEAR FOREBODING MUSIC.
We see...
A DARK ALLEY
Warily, Valiant walks into the alley, gun drawn.
There's a
NOISE behind the garbage cans.
Valiant turns as a DEAD BODY
with a knife in his back falls out of the shadows at
Valiant's feet.
A SQUEAKY VOICE comes from behind Valiant.
VOICE
I guess they didn't clean up after the
last moider.
Valiant whips around to see a TOON RAT perched on a skull
picking his teeth.
Valiant kicks the skull.
The rat
scrambles for cover.
As Valiant continues on, we see...
JESSICA RABBIT
Steps out of the shadows behind him and aim the gun at his
back.
JESSICA RABBIT
Don't move, Valiant.
Valiant turns slowly to see Jessica's got a bead on him with
her revolver.
VALIANT
Well... I always figured I'd get it in
Toontown.
BLAM!
She fires.
But Valiant's still standing.
We HEAR a
CRASH behind Eddie as a figure falls into some boxes from a
fire escape above.
JESSICA RABBIT
I think I got him.
Jessica runs past Valiant to the figure.
He follows,
bewildered.
ANGLE ON GROUND
We can see two rabbit ears sticking out from behind a box
VALIANT
You shot Roger.
JESSICA RABBIT
That's not Roger.
It's one of Doom's
men.
He killed R.K. Maroon.
Jessica moves the box aside and tugs on the rabbit ears.
The
rabbit head pops off.
Underneath is a Weasle.
In his hand
is the Colt .45 Buntline.
VALIANT
Lady, I guess I had you pegged wrong.
JESSICA RABBIT
Don't worry, you're not the first.
We
better get out of here.
As they run down the alley...
CUT TO:
THE PACKARD - ROGER
is behind the wheel making ENGINE NOISES like a little kid.
He pushes all the buttons, windshield wipers, convertible
top, etcetera, until he accidentally hits the starter button.
VROOM!
The Packard fires to life.
Roger's startled for a
moment, but quickly regains his composure.
ROGER RABBIT
Hmmm... What would be the harm if I
took her for a spin?
He throws it into gear.
The Packard bucks into the car in
front of it.
Then Roger shifts again.
The same process is
repeated in reverse.
He SMASHES back and forth.
BANG!
BANG!
ROGER RABBIT
(continuing)
Ah... the open road.
AROUND THE CORNER - EDDIE AND JESSICA
come racing down the street.
JESSICA RABBIT
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
VALIANT
Why didn't you tell me?
JESSICA RABBIT
I didn't know who I could trust.
VALIANT
We're even.
By the way, I did find
your husband.
JESSICA RABBIT
(excited)
Where is he?
VALIANT
He's right here in the...
Valiant rounds the corner and points toward the spot where
the car used to be.
But all that remains is a crumpled
bumper.
VALIANT
(continuing)
... car.
He shakes his head and looks around for signs of Roger.
INTERCUT TO:
THE PACKARD
is careening down Toon streets totally out of control.
Panicked, Roger is spinning the wheel as if it were a
motorboat.
He drives in one side of Mother Goose's Shoe and
out the other, diapers all over the windshield.
Unable to
see, Roger steers right off the road.
The car hurtles
through space.
As it starts to fall, we see it's Toon
Monument Valley.
The Packard passes a promontory on which
WILE E. COYOTE is perched.
As Roger passes, he waves to the
Coyote.
ROGER RABBIT
Hi, Roger Rabbit.
Love your work.
INTERCUT TO:
EDDIE AND JESSICA
who are now facing a squad of TEN Toon Control Weasles.
They
unleash a fusilade of bullets.
Valiant knocks Jessica to the ground.
The bullets pass
harmlessly overhead going into the window of the Acme Cheese
Shop, riddling a round of cheese.
The CHEESEMAKER'S hand
comes INTO FRAME changing the sign that says "Gouda" to
"Swiss".
Valiant rolls and FIRES his Toon .38 Special.
The Toon
Bullet turns into a cannonball, which rolls down the street
busting up the Weasle squad like a bowling ball through ten
pins.
As Eddie pulls Jessica to her feet, two more Weasles descend
on them.
They fling Toon knives, which pin Eddie to a wooden
fence.
Valiant rips one hand free, and BLASTS two shots at
them.
The Toon Bullets get to the Weasles, and open their nose
cones.
Two frying pans emerge and BONK the Weasles on the
head.
Jessica starts to pull the knives out, releasing Eddie.
VALIANT
How did you get onto Doom?
JESSICA RABBIT
Marvin told me.
Doom was after his
land.
Ne was afraid.
That's why he
brought me his will.
Valiant sees a Weasle skulking at them with a tommygun.
BLAM!
Valiant fires at him.
The Weasle ducks back around
the corner.
But Valiant's Dum-Dum SCREECHES to a stop and
goes around the corner, too.
We HEAR an EXPLOSION.
The
Weasle come staggering out and falls in the street.
VALIANT
So where is it?
JESSICA RABBIT
When I opened up the blue envelope, all
that was inside was a blank piece of
paper.
VALIANT
A joker to the end.
Now Weasles are coming at them from every direction.
Valiant
aims the Toon .38 at a Toon tank rolling their way.
But when
he pulls the trigger, the gun just CLICKS.
Empty.
JESSICA RABBIT
Looks like our goose is cooked, our
hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
VALIANT
Lemme guess where you got that from.
Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see
in that guy anyway?
JESSICA RABBIT
He made me laugh.
Valiant shakes his head.
Now they are completely surrounded
by Weasles.
The situation looks bleak.
VALIANT
Well, do you prefer to die this way or
that way?
Valiant jerks his thumb indicating the direction behind him.
Suddenly, there's a rubber-burning SCREECH as Benny the
Roadster arrives next to Valiant's hitchhiker-posed thumb.
ROADSTER
Need a lift?
Valiant does a take.
VALIANT
Benny.
The Roadster looks back approvingly as Jessica climbs in with
Eddie.
ROADSTER
Mr. Valiant, you've made a vast
improvement in the company you keep.
Benny blasts through a couple of Weasles.
They swing back
and forth like tavern doors, then topple.
He takes a hard right into the next block which is the Toon
Arctic.
His tires turn into skis.
He slaloms back and forth
between trees.
The Weasles pursue on dogsled.
Benny grabs a striped barber's pole -- the North Pole -- and
slides down it.
They land in the Toon Sahara.
Benny crawls
up a large sand dune, his tongue hanging out of his radiator.
He glances back at the Weasles who are mounted on camels,
waving scimitars.
When they reach the top of the sand dune,
we see they're on the precipice of a bottomless chasm.
ROADSTER
Look, the drawbridge -- we're gonna
make it.
VALIANT
I don't see any bridge.
ROADSTER
That's because you gotta draw it first.
Benny takes a pencil hanging from a post lettered "Draw
Bridge".
He wets the pencil point and in a flash draws a
bridge.
It's a rickety rope bridge.
Using the pencil as a
balancing pole, Benny starts to tiptoe across.
The Weasles jump off t'heir camels and start filing onto the
bridge after them.
When Benny finally reaches the other side, Valiant grabs the
pencil from him and gets out of the car.
VALIANT
Hold on a second.
JESSICA RABBIT
Eddie, come on.
But Valiant stands facing the Weasles, who are charging at
him, swords raised.
With a sly smile, Valiant holds up the
eraser end of the pencil.
This freezes the Weasles.
But as
Valiant starts to erase a rope support, the eraser breaks off
the pencil and falls down into the chasm.
The Weasles WHEEZE
with relief and advance for the kill.
At the last second,
Valiant takes the business end of the pencil and scribbles a
handsaw.
He grabs it by the handle and saws the rope.
The
bridge swings away, smacking the Weasles into the opposite
canyon wall.
One by one, they slide off and disappear into
the abyss.
VALIANT
climbs back into Benny.
The Roadster takes off again, making
a skidding left turn onto the main drag.
As they make their
break into the Toontown tunnel...
A ten gallon drum is sitting by the side of the road under
the Toontown sign.
From in the tunnel we hear the SOUND of
Benny's ENGINE coming closer.
Now a foot comes out of the
shadows and rests on the ten gallon drum.
As the SOUND of
the ROADSTER gets VERY LOUD, the foot kicks the drum over,
spilling a clear liquid across the road.
NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT
belongs to Judge Doom.
Doom smiles sadistically as the
Roadster with Eddie and Jessica aboard comes shooting out of
the tunnel.
When Benny hits the liquid, he starts to skid.
ROADSTER
Uh-oh... whoaaa...!
Look out!
His tires smoke, then disappear. It's a dip slick.
Without
tires, Benny spins out of control, finally ending up in the
bushes roadside.
Before Eddie and Jessica can make a move, they are surrounded
by a horde of Weasles pointing what looks like a hundred guns
at them.
DOOM
Are you two all right?
Doom opens one of the Roadster's doors and helps Jessica out.
Valiant climbs out after her.
The Weasles quickly relieve
him of his Toon pistol.
DOOM
(continuing)
These roads can be very treacherous at
night, especially in a maniacal Toon
vehicle.
VALIANT
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
DOOM
I've had enough of your insolence!
(to Weasles)
Put him in my car.
I think they'll
enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at
the Acme factory.
The Weasles prod Valiant and Jessica into Doom's Lincoln.
A
Weasle refers to Benny WHIMPERING in the bushes.
WEASLE
What about him?
DOOM
He's not going anywhere.
We'll send
the mobile unit after him.
Doom climbs into the car and it zooms off, Weasles jumping
onto the running boards.
BENNY
crawls out of the bushes on his axles.
ROADSTER
The boinin', the boinin'...
He makes it down into the drainage ditch, dipping his
tootsies one by one.
There's a HISS as they hit the water
and the chemicals from the dip are extinguished.
ROADSTER
(continuing)
Oh, yeah... that's better.
Now Benny hears the SOUND of another VEHICLE COMING out of
the Toontown Tunnel.
He ducks down and peeks over the ditch
to see...
ROGER IN THE PACKARD
come SCREAMING out of the tunnel backwards.
Maroon's Packard
looks like the winner of a demolition derby.
Benny stands and waves to him.
ROADSTER
Roger!
Roger sees him and slams on the brakes, skidding the Packard
into the Toontown sign.
ROGER RABBIT
Benny?
Benny hobbles over to the Packard.
He pops his trunk and
rummages around.
He comes out with Toon boltcutters.
He
clips Roger's cuffs off.
ROADSTER
Doom's got your wife and Valiant.
He
took them to the Acme factory,
ROGER RABBIT
Let's go!
Benny nudges Roger to the passenger side.
ROADSTER
Slide over, son.
It looks like you've
done enough drivin' for tonight.
Now the Toon Roadster gingerly gets behind the wheel of the
Packard.
He hits the gas and the Packard lurches down the
road.
have been watching the proceedings through a window.
They
turn to each other stunned.
BENNY/ROGER RABBIT
Dip Toontown?
ROGER RABBIT
We gotta do something!
Roger scurries back to the Packard hidden outside the gates.
He opens Valiant's black bag and comes out holding Eddie's
real pistol.
Benny comes tenderfooting up.
ROADSTER
Roger, what're you gonna do with that
gun?
ROGER RABBIT
I'm gonna save them, of course.
You go
for help.
Find Dolores at the Terminal
Bar.
She'll know what to do.
ROADSTER
Well... all right...
Reluctantly, Benny gets behind the wheel of the Packard.
ROADSTER
(continuing)
But you be careful now with that gun.
This ain't no cartoon.
Benny pulls away.
Roger turns with determination and zips
back to the window
is trying to jimmy open a window using his whole body for
leverage.
He finally pops the window open.
Gun drawn, he
climbs over the sill.
And falls head first.
