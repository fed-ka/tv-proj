      A long winding street somewhere in small town, USA.  The road 
      is empty when a car FLIES by.  Florida plates.   


      Cassie gets out, looks to her front tire.  It s flat.  Cassie 
      groans in frustration.  Looks around.  Lots of trees.  Houses 
      in the distance.  Not a lot of options.  But then--

      She sees a car IDLING half a block up the road.  The same one 
      that passed her.  It just sits there.  As if watching.  She 
      can t make out who s behind the wheel.  She calls out.

                                  CASSIE
                    Hey... Can I get a...?

      The car quickly speeds away.  Fuck you very much.  Cassie 
      goes back to her car, reaches in for her cell phone.  


      A modest house in a modest neighborhood.  Lights burn within.                                                                                      2.



      Cassie pulls a spare from her trunk.  A self-sufficient girl.

                                  CASSIE
                    Three blocks away.  

                                  AMELIA
                    Who said you could take the car? 

                                  CASSIE
                    That s really not relevant right 
                    now. 

                                  AMELIA
                    Are you okay?  Did you call AAA?  

                                  CASSIE
                    I can change a tire, mom. 

                                  AMELIA
                    You have to ask me before you take 
                    the car, Cassie.


      A car pulls up and comes to a stop in front of the house.  
      It s the same car that passed Cassie in the road.  Beat.  


      The car continues to IDLE.  The driver s door opens.  A MAN 
      gets out.  He s mid-30 s.  Pale skin.  Piercing blue eyes.  
      Eerie beautiful.  He stares at the house, eyes transfixed.

      He drinks from a bottle of water.  Takes a sip and then 
      proceeds to pour the rest of it out.  Onto the road.


      An AERIAL SHOT flies over the ocean coming upon land.  An 
      amazing vista of cliff, rocks, and crashing ocean below.  

      The CAMERA finds a lone car making its way down the winding 
      road that traces the edge of the cliff.

      SUPER: ONE MONTH LATER


      Cassie s car drives through an impossibly charming town.  She 
      passes quaint, family-owned stores on MAIN STREET, a 
      picturesque MARINA, a LUSH FOREST, and beautifully maintained 
      COLONIAL HOMES.


      Cassie pulls up to an old two-story colonial house and parks.  
      She checks the address, makes sure it s the right one.   She 
      gets out.  Looks around.  Takes it all in.  This is her new 
      home.  

      She sees a NEIGHBOR working in the yard nearby.  She smiles 
      and waves.  But the NEIGHBOR just stares.  Odd.

      She hears a window open.  Looks to the house next door.  

      From an upstairs window, she sees someone -- a FIGURE --  
      staring at her.  She can t make out a face.  It s eerie.  
      Just then--

                                  JANE 
                    Cassie!  You re here.

      Cassie turns to see her grandmother, JANE BLAKE, come down 
      the porch steps to greet her.  Jane is a proper, New England 
      dame in her 50 s.  She wraps Cassie in her arms and squeezes 
      tight.  Beat.  As they both fight back their tears.  When 
      they finally break, Jane is composed and cheery.                                                                                        6.

      CONTINUED:

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    How was your trip?  I wish you 
                    would have let me drive with you.

      They go to Cassie s car and start to unload.  

                                  CASSIE
                    You do not want to be in the car 
                    with me for that long, Grandma.  I 
                    have road rage.

                                  JANE
                    I was worried.  I felt like I was 
                      abandoning you after the service.  
                    How ya doing?

                                  CASSIE
                    At the moment.  Good.  Five minutes 
                    from now.  Who knows?

      And Cassie means this.  It s moment to moment with her.  Jane 
      smiles.  They share another moment, connected by sadness and 
      love and longing.  

                                  JANE
                    I m really glad you re here. 


      Time has passed.  It s night.  The light is on in the 
      upstairs bedroom.                                                                                      8.



      A new day begins.  Newspapers are delivered.  Fishermen ready 
      their boats.  Crossing guards help kids to school.


        Establishing shot of a small town high school.


      Cassie s car pulls up to the marina and parks in front of the 
      BOATHOUSE BAR & GRILL.  She gets out and heads inside.  As 
      Cassie sees Diana through the window and waves, we re --


      Cassie exits the tavern.  


      Cassie approaches her car.  BEEPS the lock.  Gets inside.

      INSIDE THE CAR

      She starts the engine when -- it just turns over.  She tries 
      it again.  Nothing.  Then again.  This time something SPARKS.  
      Under the hood.  Then--

      SMOKE BEGINS to blow out her AC VENTS.  What the...?                                                                                    17.

      CONTINUED:

      Cassie reaches for the door.  When the CAR S DOORS LOCK BY 
      THEMSELVES.  

      Suddenly, FLAMES IGNITE from under the hood.  They seep out, 
      rising up.  Instant fear.  Cassie loses it, begins to panic.  


      The hood of Cassie s car is completely engulfed in flames.  
      Others have taken notice.  Patrons come racing out of the 
      tavern.  A WOMAN yells --

                                  WOMAN
                    Oh my God!!!  Help!!!


      The car is no longer on fire.  Some lingering smoke.

      A CROWD surrounds Cassie.  The handsome guy who saved her is 
      still there too.  ADAM CONANT, 19.  Cassie tries to stand.  
      Diana is there.

                                  ADAM
                    Let me help you.

                                  DIANA
                    Are you okay?  

      He takes her, helps her up.  She s taken with this guy.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Thank you.  I don t know what 
                    happened.  

                                  ADAM
                    Your car caught on fire.  

                                  CASSIE
                    I got that part.  

      Diana looks to FAYE and MELISSA who hang back from the crowd  
      with DOUG and NICK.  She s really unhappy with them.  
      Admonishing them with her stare.  

                                  DIANA
                    Your engine must have gone kaput.  

                                  CASSIE
                    But the doors wouldn t open.

                                  ADAM
                    Maybe you panicked and locked the 
                    doors when you were trying to 
                    unlock them.  

                                  CASSIE
                    No.  They wouldn t open.  And who 
                    put the fire out?

                                  DIANA
                    It went out by itself.  Thank God 
                    you re okay.  But at least you met 
                    Adam.  

      Cassie looks at Adam.  Smiles.  Hi.                                                                                    19.

      CONTINUED:

                                  ADAM
                    Diana told me about you.  

                                  DIANA
                    Adam s my boyfriend.  

      Oh.  Not what she wanted to hear.  Cassie visibly deflates.     


      Diana s car pulls up in front of Cassie s house.  


      The center of the town.  Where the town dock and boardwalk, 
      and marina create the heart of the town.

      A CELEBRATION is in the works.  A tent is being erected.  A 
      small stage built.  A small town fair.  A sign reads LOBSTER 
      FESTIVAL.  A yearly event.  

      Faye and Melissa are exiting the coffee shop with their 
      caffeine fix when Diana approaches.  

                                  DIANA
                    What was up with that little stunt 
                    last night? 

                                    MELISSA
                    Hi, Diana.  Nice to see you too.

                                  FAYE
                    Why do you just assume I was the 
                    one who did it?

                                    MELISSA
                    Yeah, how do you know it wasn t me?

      Faye rolls her eyes.

                                  FAYE
                    Because you can t flat iron your 
                    own hair.

                                  DIANA
                          (to Faye)
                    Did you do it?                                                                                    25.

      CONTINUED:

      Faye shrugs and smiles.  Kind of smugly. 

                                  DIANA (CONT D)
                    It was stupid and reckless.

                                  FAYE
                    We all wanted to know, Diana.  I 
                    cut to the chase.  What s the big 
                    deal?  No one got hurt.  That s the 
                    rule, right?

                                  DIANA
                    The rule is we don t act alone.  We 
                    don t do anything that could risk 
                    exposure.   

                                  FAYE
                    That s a lot to remember.

      She s fucking with Diana who s not amused.

                                  DIANA
                    Are we going to have a problem?   

                                  FAYE
                    We ve had a problem since the third 
                    grade, why stop now?  

                                  DIANA
                    We all made a pact and if you break 
                    the pact--

                                  FAYE
                    What Diana?  If I break the pact-- 
                    what are you going to do?

      Faye and Diana face off.  It s intense.  

                                  DIANA
                    Don t push it, Faye.

      Off Faye as Diana walks off.   


      Adam chases Cassie out the door.  

                                  ADAM
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa... why would you 
                    say that?

                                  CASSIE
                    Why would you chase me out the door 
                    after I said it?  I can play this 
                    game all day.

                                  ADAM
                    I just wanna know why you would go 
                    there.

      Cassie stops.  Turns to him.  She s done talking in circles.

                                  CASSIE
                    And I just wanna know why you re 
                    not being straight with me.  

      Beat.  As Adam studies her face.  

                                  ADAM
                    What is it you think you know?  

      Finally, Cassie unleashes.  

                                  CASSIE
                    The car last night... and other 
                    things.  Something is going on 
                    around here. 

      Adam s not sure how to respond.  Cassie digs in her bag and 
      pulls out her MOTHER S BOOK.                                                                                     30.

                                  CASSIE (CONT D)
                    I found a book that belonged to my 
                    mom.  About witchcraft.  A spell 
                    book.  She wrote about a secret 
                    circle.  Listed their family names.  
                    Conant, that would be you.  Meade, 
                    that would be Diana, and Faye s 
                    family and Melissa... 

      Adam grabs the book, covers it up, looks around, makes sure 
      no one is watching.  They re alone.  He hands it back to her.

                                  ADAM
                    Put it away.  Before someone sees 
                    it.  

      He s deadly serious.  Cassie s tough wall comes down.  She s 
      at a loss.  This is all too real for her.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Please.  I don t understand.

      Adam sees her fear.  How confused she is.   

                                  ADAM
                    Okay, but not here.

      He starts off, motioning for her to follow him.


      Adam leads Cassie down a path in the forest.  Rich and lush.  
      The sun breaks perfectly through the trees, bathing them in 
      shafts of light.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Where are we going?

                                  ADAM
                    Is everything a question with you?

                                  CASSIE
                    Around questionable people. 

                                  ADAM
                    Here we are.

      He leads her to a small clearing.   

                                  CASSIE
                    What s special about this place?                                                                                    31.

                    Us?  Are you going to start talking 
                    in creepy  we  speak?  Like a cult?

      He smiles.  Understands her trepidation.

                                  CASSIE
                    The Salem witch trials.

                                  ADAM
                    The practice of witchcraft was 
                    passed down through the years. 

                                  CASSIE
                    You re saying I m a witch.  My mom 
                    was a witch.

                                  ADAM
                    Crazy, huh?

                                  CASSIE
                    Oh yeah.

                                  ADAM
                    We just try to keep a straight face 
                    about it all.

                                  CASSIE
                    A real witch?  

                                  ADAM
                    Yep.

                                  CASSIE
                    Diana, Faye, Melissa...

                                  ADAM
                    There re six of us.  You would be 
                    seven.

      Cassie catches his implication.                                                                                      32.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    But we have to keep it secret, 
                    Cassie.  It s forbidden.  Things 
                    got out of hand in the past and the 
                    families decided to abolish all 
                      witchcraft.  They feared modern 
                    times.  Discovery.  Persecution.  
                    Hurting others, themselves.  That s 
                    why you can t tell anyone, Cassie.  
                    Not your grandmother, friends, no 
                    one can know about us.

                                  CASSIE
                    Who would believe me?  I don t 
                    believe it. 

                                  ADAM
                    Sure you do.

                                  CASSIE
                    No, I don t.

      Adam smiles.  Knows better.  

                                  ADAM
                    Yes, you do.  You re already 
                      awakening.  Inside.  You feel it.

      Cassie goes silent.  Yes, she senses something.   

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Come here.  It s okay.  Don t be 
                    afraid.

      She joins him in the center of the field.  Where he has 
      picked up a leaf.  He opens her palms and SETS DOWN THE LEAF.  
      There's water in it and he's careful not to spill any. 

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Close your eyes.
                          (she does)
                      Concentrate on how your hand 
                    connects with the leaf, then how 
                    the leaf connects with the water.

      She tries.  

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Say "a drop of water, as light as 
                    air" and keep repeating it.

                                  CASSIE
                    Shouldn't it rhyme or something?                                                                                    33.

      CONTINUED: (3)

                                  ADAM
                    It's a way to get your brain 
                    focused on what you're trying to 
                    do.  But yes, sometimes it's easier 
                    to remember if it rhymes.  Try it. 

      She closes her eyes again.

                                  CASSIE
                    A drop of water, as light as air.  
                    A drop of water, as light as air.
                          (beat)
                    I can't feel anything.

      He puts his hands under hers.  She can feel his warmth.

                                  ADAM
                    Can you feel tingling where my hand 
                    is touching yours?  It's your 
                    energy connecting to mine. 

      Cassie lets his words sink in.  She concentrates on what 
      she's actually feeling.  She begins to FEEL SOMETHING.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    A drop of water, as light as air...

                                    CASSIE/ADAM
                    A drop of water, as light as air.

      Their voices melt into each other.  Their bodies draw closer 
      together.  The INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM IS INTENSE.  Incredibly, 
      the WATER IN THE LEAF BEGINS TO RISE IN THE AIR.

                                  ADAM
                    Open your eyes.

      She does.  And is AWESTRUCK WHEN SHE SEES THE WATER.  She 
      looks at Adam.  They LOCK EYES and the rest of the world 
      becomes a blur.

      Then all around them, HUNDREDS OF WATER DROPS START TO RISE 
      IN THE AIR.  From the tops of branches and rocks, tree tops 
      and grass.  LIKE FLOATING DIAMONDS, they reflect the orange 
      and red light from the sun.  It's like Cassie and Adam are in 
      a CRYSTAL FOREST.  It's breathtaking.

      CASSIE'S STUNNED.  Her expression is full of wonder.  Tears 
      well up in her eyes.  It could quite possibly be the most 
      beautiful thing she s ever seen.  


                                  END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    34.


                                        ACT FOUR


      Deep in the woods -- sits a huge abandoned house.  Decaying.  
      Overgrown yard.  Ominous.  Adam leads Cassie up the steps.  

                                  CASSIE
                    You re kidding me, right?  You 
                    think I m going in there?

                                  ADAM
                    It just looks creepy.  We usually 
                    meet during the day... since 
                    there s no electricity.

                                  CASSIE
                    There s no lights?  

                                  ADAM
                    Just rats and snakes.  

      Cassie heads the head other way.  He stops her, LAUGHS. 

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    I m joking.

      She can t help but smile.  

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    I like that.  Keep smiling.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Why?

                                  ADAM
                    It s important to keep this all 
                    balanced.  With some humor.  It can 
                    get overwhelming sometimes.  
                          (then)
                    And you have a nice smile.

      Beat.  They look at each other.  They have a connection.  
      It s innocent... but it s there.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    C mon, they re waiting for us.  

      He leads her up the porch steps.                                                                                      35.



      The Festival is underway.  The entire town of New Salem has 
      turned out for it.  PEOPLE line the streets and sidewalks.  
      Lights have been strung from building to building.  

      Carnival games and food stands line the wharf as PEOPLE dance 
      in the street to a LIVE BAND.


      Vice-Principal Dawn Chamberlain is manning the CLAM CHOWDER 
      TENT when Jane Blake approaches.  

                                  JANE
                    Hello, Dawn.

                                  DAWN
                    Jane.  How are you?

                                  JANE
                    A little concerned, actually.

      Dawn moves closer.  So they can talk privately.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    It s Cassie.  Her car caught fire 
                    last night.  

      Dawn pauses upon hearing this.  It s news to her.

                                  DAWN
                    Is she okay?

                                  JANE
                    She s fine.  It s what caused the 
                    fire I m concerned about.

                                  DAWN
                    What did?

                                  JANE
                    We don t know.  
                          (beat)
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    40.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I seem to recall a similar thing 
                    happening years ago.  Some 
                    teenagers having fun.  You 
                    included.

      Dawn sees where she s going with this.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Are the children practicing?  

      Dawn s face falls some.

                                  DAWN
                    It s impossible.  They don t even 
                    know the history.  It s too buried. 

                                  JANE
                    They re teenagers, Dawn.  You 
                    better than anyone, would know how 
                      resourceful they can be. 

      Dawn takes this extremely serious.

                                  DAWN
                    I m the Vice Principal, I m around 
                    these kids every day.  If they were 
                      practicing, I would know.

                                  JANE
                    Would you?  Maybe, we ve gotten too 
                    lax.  It is conceivable.  They 
                    could be doing it in secret.

                                  DAWN
                    How would they know what to do?  
                    They wouldn t even know where to 
                    start. 

                                  JANE
                    Cassie s an innocent.  Amelia told 
                    her nothing.  I want to keep it 
                    that way. 

                                  DAWN
                    I ll keep my eyes open, but it s 
                    not possible.  I assure you.  

      But Dawn can t help but be suspicious.  She shares Jane s 
      concern.                                                                                      41.



      The road has been blocked off for a street dance.  A band 
      plays.  As a crowd dances and parties under the stars. 

      Through the crowd, the CIRCLE appears.  Diana, Adam, Faye, 
      Melissa, Nick, Doug -- they lock eyes on Cassie who is 
      walking through the sights with Jane.  


      Cassie and Jane.  

                                  JANE
                    So what do you think of our town?  
                    Are you making friends? 

                                  CASSIE
                    A few.  It takes time. 

                                  JANE
                    If I leave early will you be okay?  

      Cassie smiles.  Of course, she can.  Just then, Faye comes up 
      behind Cassie and steals her away.

                                  FAYE
                    She s in good hands, Mrs. Blake.  
                    I ll get her home safely.  

      Faye pulls Cassie away, playfully.


      Adam steals Diana away from the others for a private moment.

                                  DIANA
                    Where are we going?

                                  ADAM
                    There s something I need to tell 
                    you.

      Diana eyes him.  Yes?

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    In the woods.  When I showed Cassie 
                    the spell.  I felt her energy.  

                                  DIANA
                    And?                                                                                    42.

      CONTINUED:

                                  ADAM
                    She s different, Diana.  Stronger.  
                    Unlike anything I ve felt.  There s 
                    something special about her.  

                                  DIANA
                    What do you mean?  

                                  ADAM
                    I don t know what I mean.  I just 
                    thought I should tell you.  

      Diana nods, of course.  But it only confuses her.  


      At the FOOTBALL TOSS, Nick and Doug toss balls.  Melissa, 
      Faye, and Cassie watch.  Doug keeps winning.  Finally, Nick 
      steps aside.  He sidles up next to Cassie, all friendly.

                                  NICK
                    I get your resistance, Cassie.  I 
                    hold the loner crown.  But this 
                    little group works for me.  And I 
                    don t even like  em. 
                          (smiles, then)
                    You don t wanna be in it alone.  

      Faye pulls Cassie away.  Enough.

                    Way to sell it.  There s a car 
                      dealership in your future. 
                          (to Cassie)
                    Let s just have some fun.

      Faye leads Cassie off alone.  They stop and peruse a stand of 
      HAND CRAFTED JEWELRY.  Faye places several pieces on Cassie.   

                                  FAYE (CONT D)
                    Dreck.  Dreck.  This too.  Arts and 
                    crafts should be outlawed.

      They LAUGH.  Faye is being her most  endearing  self.  

                                  CASSIE
                    I know what you guys are doing.  

                                  FAYE
                    Is it working?

                                  CASSIE
                    Maybe... a little.                                                                                    43.

                    The night s young.

      Cassie holds up a bulky turquoise necklace.

                                  CASSIE
                    What about this?

                                  FAYE
                    If you re going for hideous. 

                                  SALLY (V.O.)
                    I made that one.

      They turn to find Sally behind them.  Stone-faced.  It s her 
      booth.  Cassie removes it, doesn t want to be rude.

                                  CASSIE
                    Hi, Sally.  It s nice, just too big 
                    for my neck.  

                                  FAYE
                    It s okay, Cassie, she knows it s 
                    ugly.  It s obvious, right?  

                                  SALLY
                    I had you in mind when I made it.

                                  FAYE
                    Ouch.  Almost.

      Faye walks away, tugs at Cassie to join her.  Who does so, 
        apologetically.  They move through the crowd, coming upon--

      Diana and Adam -- and an OLDER MAN who is now with them.   

                                  DIANA
                    Hey, there you are.  I want you to 
                    meet my Dad.    

      Diana s father, THOMAS MEADE, 40, greets Cassie. 

                                  THOMAS
                    Hi, Cassie, welcome to New Salem.  

      Thomas is an attractive man.  With piercing blue eyes.  Pale 
      skin.  Eerie beautiful.  He looks extremely familiar.  But 
      not to Cassie.  She has no idea THIS IS THE MAN WHO KILLED 
      HER MOTHER.

                                        ACT FIVE


      Right where we left off.  Diana s father.  

                                  THOMAS
                    Are you kids having fun?  How about 
                    you, Cassie?   Are they treating 
                    you okay? 

                                  CASSIE
                    Yes, sir. 

                                  THOMAS
                    And I m sorry about your loss.  I 
                    knew your mom growing up.  She was 
                    a great woman.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Thank you, Mr. Meade.

                                  THOMAS
                    You kids stay out of trouble.  

      Diana s father walks off into the crowd.  Cassie turns to the 
      others -- says her good-byes.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Well, I think I m gonna go.  Seeya 
                    around, guys.  

                                  DIANA
                    I ll give you a ride.

                                  CASSIE
                    It s okay, I can get home.  

      Cassie walks away.  Faye looks at Diana.  

                                  FAYE
                    Well, you handled that well.  

      Faye walks off.  


      Faye pushes through the crowd when Nick approaches.   

                                  NICK
                    Hey, wanna get drunk?                                                                                     45.

                    Go away.

                                  NICK
                    Why are you so angry?

                                  FAYE
                      Disgruntled youth.  No father 
                    figure, domineering mother, bad sex 
                    life, take your pick.  

                                  NICK
                    Thanks for getting me in there.

                                  FAYE
                    Anytime.

      Faye turns to go and CRASHES into Sally.  

                                  SALLY
                    Excuse you.  

      Sally s a little snotty for Faye s taste.  Sally walks on.  
      Faye turns and watches her go, quietly WHISPERING something 
      to herself.  It s inaudible.  

      ON SALLY as she moves through the crowd.  Suddenly, a WOMAN 
      BUMPS into her.  Then, a MAN does the same thing. 

                                  WOMAN
                    Excuse you.

                                  MAN
                    Excuse you. 

      Then, a TEENAGED BOY does it.  Then, a SMALL GIRL.  It 
      happens repeatedly as Sally makes her way all the way through 
      the crowd.  Faye can t help but smile.  Until she sees Diana 
      watching her.  

      Their eye lock says it all.  Finally, Faye turns and walks 
      away.  But Diana catches up to her.  

                                  DIANA
                    Are you just asking to get found 
                    out? 

                                  FAYE
                    Screw you.

                                  DIANA
                    I m done.  You re out.                                                                                      46.

      CONTINUED: (2)

                                  FAYE
                    You can t kick me out. 

                                  DIANA
                    I just did. 

                                  FAYE
                    You don t own the circle.

      Diana starts to walk past her, but Faye blocks her.

                                  DIANA
                    You don t want to pick a fight with 
                    me, Faye.  I m stronger than you.

                                  FAYE
                    Why?  Because you have a precious 
                    Book of Shadows?  Well, I ve been 
                      practicing, Diana, on my own.  
                    You d be surprised at what I can 
                    do.

                                  DIANA
                    You re out of control.  

                                  FAYE
                    You haven t seen out of control.  

      Faye turns and marches off.  Diana stares after her, worried.  
      Slowly, the CAMERA RACKS FOCUS to REVEAL Dawn Chamberlain 
      watching from a distance.  Suspicious of what just 
      transpired.


      There s a beer tent where the adults hang and drink.  Cassie 
      walks around it, to avoid the crowd when a FIGURE STUMBLES 
      from behind the tent.  It s Ethan (Adam s Dad).  Cassie 
      jumps, startled.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Hey, Mr. Conant.

      He looks at her drunkenly, stumbling some more.

                                  ETHAN
                    It s... Amelia s girl.

      Cassie nods.

                                  CASSIE
                    Hi, Mr. Conant.  You okay?                                                                                    47.

      CONTINUED:

                                  ETHAN
                    I haven t been okay in many years.  
                    Not since I lost your mother.  

                                  CASSIE
                    What do you mean?

      Ethan gets lost in a drunken memory.  As he talks THOMAS 
      MEADE appears behind Cassie -- he OVERHEARS Ethan.

                                  ETHAN
                    Our families are aligned in the 
                    stars.  We were meant to love each 
                    other.  Just like you and Adam...

      Cassie pauses.  She s not sure she heard correctly.

                                  ETHAN (CONT D)
                    But then your father came along... 
                    just swept her off her feet.

                                  CASSIE
                    You knew my father?

      Ethan bends down, reaches for his drink.

                                  ETHAN
                    Oh yeah, I knew your father--

                                  THOMAS
                    Evening, Ethan.  

      Thomas quickly injects himself.  

                                  THOMAS (CONT D)
                    You need some help home?

                                  ETHAN
                    I can get there, Tommy.  

      He waves Thomas off and starts out.  Cassie doesn t want him 
      to go but also knows he s extremely drunk.  

                                  CASSIE
                    I ll see you soon, Mr. Conant.

      Ethan MUMBLES as he disappears.  Thomas looks at Cassie.  

                                  THOMAS
                    That man can sure drink.                                                                                    48.



      Faye moves down to the end of the dock.  She looks out at the 
      dark horizon.  She looks up to the sky.  

                                  FAYE
                    Please sky, quench my thirst.  
                    Please sky, quench my thirst.

      Faye stands there, CHANTING... 

      As RAINDROPS begin to hit the water around the dock.  

      As CLOUDS FORM IN THE SKY ABOVE.  In moments, a light shower 
      becomes a steady pour of rain.

      Faye OPENS HER EYES and looks around.  Stunned by her own 
      power.


      As it begins to RAIN DOWN on the Festival.  Everyone begins 
      to run for cover.  It s a full on DOWN POUR.  

      Cassie races for cover when she looks to the water -- sees 
      Faye standing at the end of the dock -- in a trance.  


      As PEOPLE duck for cover, Diana comes upon Adam.  

                                  ADAM
                    What s going on?

                                  DIANA
                    I don t know.  

      Off their worried faces--


      Cassie races down the dock, shielding herself from the rain.  
      She reaches Faye -- she s almost trance-like.  Cassie begins 
      to realize what s happening.  It frightens her.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Faye... Faye...
                          (beat)
                    Are you doing this?  

      Faye turns to Cassie -- full of wonder and disbelief.  She 
      smiles.  Yes, I am.  This frightens Cassie.                                                                                      49.

      CONTINUED:

                                  FAYE
                    Don t be afraid.  It s beautiful.  
                    Here.  Gimme your hand.

      Faye GRABS Cassie s hand.  Cassie can t help but feel the 
      energy move through her.

      A CRACKLING OF THUNDER.  Followed by LIGHTNING illuminating 
      the sky.  Both girls watch in amazement -- as the rain pours 
      down, drenching them.

      ON THE HORIZON

      Lightning STRIKES DOWN in the distance.  Both beautiful and 
        frightening.

      Cassie gets scared -- she tries to break her grip but Faye 
      holds her close.  

      Just then, Diana battles the rain and races down the dock.

                                  DIANA
                    Faye -- stop it.  

      Diana grabs Faye -- shakes her.  

                                  DIANA (CONT D)
                    Stop it.  

      Faye looks at her--

      Suddenly, a BOLT OF LIGHTNING STRIKES A BOAT TIED TO THE 
      DOCK.

      It CRACKS the mast -- it comes SMASHING DOWN ON THE DOCK.  

      RIGHT AT DIANA -- KNOCKING HER INTO THE WATER.  

      Cassie SCREAMS, pulling away from Faye -- breaking her from 
      her spell.  She goes for Diana -- but Adam is there.  He 
      dives in and quickly helps Diana to the docks.

      As Faye SNAPS out of her spell, terrified at what she s done.

      OFF CASSIE -- even more so.


                                  END OF ACT FIVE                                                                                    50.


                                        ACT SIX


      The RAIN has subsided.  And so has the Festival.  The CROWD 
      has thinned out.  The MUSIC has stopped.  

      Cassie and Adam sit with a wet and shivering Diana.  

                                  CASSIE
                    Are you going to be okay?

      Faye approaches, hesitantly.  Tears in her eyes.  

                                  FAYE
                    I m sorry, Diana.  I would never 
                    hurt you.

      Diana cuts her a look of raw anger.

                                  FAYE (CONT D)
                    I don t know what happened.  It got 
                    out of control.  I touched Cassie.  
                    The energy got too big.

      Adam cuts a look at Diana.  Cassie?  

                                  DIANA
                    Let s talk about this tomorrow.  I 
                    just wanna get home.  

      Adam helps her up. 

                                  ADAM
                    C mon, I ll take you.  

      They all gather to leave, except Faye -- she s unable to 
      move.  She s too full of regret.  


      Jane s house looks peaceful in the moonlight.


      Faye stands at the dock where Diana was hit.  Still stunned 
      by the havoc she unleashed.  She gets a TEXT MESSAGE.

                                  AMELIA (V.O.)
                    As daunting as the truth may be, 
                    hiding from it is far more 
                      dangerous. 


      A camp fire BURNS in the night.  The surf rages in the 
      distance.  FIGURES comes into view.  Melissa, Doug, Nick, 
      Adam, Faye, Diana -- they take their place around the fire.

                                  AMELIA (V.O.)
                    I hope you find someone who can.

      As they begin to CHANT... 

                                  ALL
                    Take the flame into the night, take 
                    the flame into the night...

      Over and over again -- until the FLAMES of the campfire 
      EXPLODE into the sky -- at least twenty feet.  

      The FLICKERING FLAMES illuminate their surprised faces.  
      CASSIE APPEARS on the edge of the circle. 

                                  AMELIA (V.O.)
                    I ran.  Don t make the same 
                    mistake.  Find a place where you 
                    belong.  A place that gives you the 
                    strength to believe in yourself.  

      CLOSE ON CASSIE

      As she takes her place amongst them, completing the CIRCLE.
