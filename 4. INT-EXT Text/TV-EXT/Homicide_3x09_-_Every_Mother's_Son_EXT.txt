               Packed stands. Pre-game. The BAND is PLAYING. CHEERLEADERS 
               bounce from one end of the field to the other. The Baltimore 
               Canadian Football League TEAM stands along one sideline. The 
               Las Vegas POSSE of the CFL stands on the sideline across the 
               field. A couple of huge Baltimore LINEMEN look down the 
               sidelines, shaking their heads at KAY HOWARD, BEAU FELTON, 
               STANLEY BOLANDER, JOHN MUNCH, MELDRICK LEWIS, FRANK PEMBLETON, 
               TIM BAYLISS and AL GIARDELLO. A DOZEN UNIFORMS stand nearby 
               as well.

                                     HOWARD
                         Gee, what the hell are we doing here? 
                         We're Murder Police for crying out 
                         loud. This is ridiculous.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         Detective Howard, this is the City's 
                         way of recognizing the hard working 
                         men and women of the Baltimore City 
                         Police Department. It's an honor 
                         really.

                                     LEWIS
                         It's a joke. A photo-op and a joke.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         It's a chance for the taxpayers to 
                         see their law enforcement personnel 
                         face-to-face.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Face-to-face? With what? An eight 
                         million power telescope? Those folks 
                         in the nose-bleeds can't tell me 
                         from Adam.

                                     GIARDELLO
                         All right. Enough. We were ordered 
                         here. Now go with the flow.

               MUNCH walks behind the PLAYERS, tapping them on the shoulders 
               and handing out business cards.

                                     MUNCH
                         Hey, fellas. I just wanted to invite 
                         you and your friends to a great new 
                         bar. The Waterfront. We don't short 
                         pour and our wings are hotter than 
                         the cheerleaders. Come on down.

               FELTON stands next to a huge LINEMAN, smiling.

                                     FELTON
                         Hi. How are you?

               The LINEMAN ignores FELTON.

                                     FELTON
                         You know I played a little high school 
                         ball. Linebacker.

               The LINEMAN gives FELTON a disdainful look, walks away. 
               BOLANDER sits on the end of the bench, elbows on knees, face 
               in his hands, thick with sad memories. He doesn't even look 
               up as BAYLISS sits down next to him with a water bottle. 
               BAYLISS squirts some water in his mouth, splattering the 
               front of his suit.

                                     BOLANDER
                         Look at that grass.

                                     BAYLISS
                         What? The grass?

                                     BOLANDER
                         This soil is soaked with the sweat 
                         and blood of... Johnny Unitas... 
                         Alan Ameche... Tom Matte. Gino 
                         Marchetti used to flatten Elroy "Crazy 
                         Legs" Hirsch right there on the forty-
                         yard line.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Stan, these guys play for us just 
                         like all your old Baltimore Colt 
                         heroes. Same city, same stadium, 
                         same game.

                                     BOLANDER
                              (looks at BAYLISS for 
                              a moment)
                         So young... So ignorant.

               BOLANDER reaches down and pulls a few blades of grass from 
               the hallowed field and puts them in his pocket. Suddenly, 
               the PA Announcer's VOICE BOOMS through the Stadium.

                                     PA ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         Ladies and gentlemen, in the Baltimore 
                         CFL's continuing tribute to the 
                         special people who serve our city so 
                         well... We are tonight honoring those 
                         who keep Charm City safe. Would you 
                         please stand and give a big hand to 
                         the representatives of the men and 
                         women of the Baltimore City Police 
                         Department.

               GIARDELLO leads his PEOPLE in a home run trot through a 
               channel of CHEERLEADERS. BAYLISS runs, smiling at EACH YOUNG 
               LADY. The OTHERS follow behind, waving at the CROWD. Then 
               there's BOLANDER, who trots out last in line, his hands in 
               pockets, unable to forget his beloved Colts. As the CROWD 
               roars its approval,

                                                                   FADE TO:

               SERIES OF SHOTS: PEMBLETON and BAYLISS interviewing WITNESSES. 
               PEMBLETON with YOUNG GIRL #1.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         He came out nowhere?

                                     YOUNG GIRL #1
                         Uh-huh.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         What's "nowhere?"

                                     YOUNG GIRL #1
                         He just walked in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BAYLISS with YOUNG MALE.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You saw the shooter walk in?

                                     YOUNG MALE
                         Just by himself. And he pulls out 
                         this bad ass piece from his waist.

               YOUNG MALE demonstrates pulling a gun from beneath his jacket 
               at his waistband.

                                     BAYLISS
                         He say anything to this Darryl kid?

                                     YOUNG MALE
                         Nope. Just strolls up, pulls his 
                         piece out and Zip-Zip-Zip right into 
                         the kid's head. Right in his ear. 
                         Like an assassination or something, 
                         y'know. He was cold.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               PEMBLETON and BAYLISS with YOUNG GIRL #2, who is teary-eyed.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         He was cold, huh?
                              (beat)
                         But this dead kid, Darryl, didn't 
                         have any enemies? You don't know 
                         anyone who was out to get him?

                                     YOUNG GIRL #2
                         We come here every Friday after school 
                         'cause Darryl was teaching me how to 
                         bowl.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Darryl didn't run with any gang?

                                     YOUNG GIRL #2
                         Darryl ain't down with that stuff. 
                         He likes being himself, y'know. In 
                         the library with his stories. He 
                         liked to write stories.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         He wrote stories?

                                     YOUNG GIRL #2
                         'Bout how he's gonna get himself out 
                         of East Baltimore.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You never saw the kid who shot him 
                         before?

                                     YOUNG GIRL #2
                         Oh, yeah, I seen him before. Name's 
                         Ronny Sayers.

               On PEMBLETON and BAYLISS, exchanging glances, as PEMBLETON 
               writes down the name,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               MUNCH and LEWIS exit, each carrying a cup of coffee. They 
               head toward The Waterfront. LEWIS has a folder of papers 
               tucked under his armpit. MUNCH furiously stirs his coffee.

                                     LEWIS
                         You musta dumped half a pound of 
                         sugar into that cup. I thought you 
                         hated sugar.

                                     MUNCH
                         I need a glucose boost.

                                     LEWIS
                         You're gonna end up with the sugar 
                         blues, John.

                                     MUNCH
                         I'm gonna end up with a coronary if 
                         we don't get some decent beverage 
                         servers for our bar hired today.

               MUNCH pauses, drains half his cup of coffee, grimaces at the 
               sweetness. He and LEWIS continue walking.

                                     MUNCH
                         It's a watershed moment, Meldrick. 
                         We're taking on enormous 
                         responsibilities. We are on the 
                         threshold of becoming what I never 
                         imagined in my wildest dreams. We 
                         are about to become bosses.

                                     LEWIS
                         We're hiring a couple of waitresses, 
                         John. What are you getting all wired 
                         out about?

               They arrive at the entrance of The Waterfront.


               BAYLISS and PEMBLETON approach a tiny rowhouse, BAYLISS 
               holding the dead boy's wallet. FOUR LITTLE GIRLS, ranging in 
               age from seven to ten, skip double-dutch on the sidewalk. 
               BAYLISS RINGS the doorbell. The GIRLS stop and stare at 
               BAYLISS. BAYLISS RINGS doorbell again, turns to take in the 
               stares from the GIRLS.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Howdy.

               GIRLS stand mute, staring holes into BAYLISS. PEMBLETON stands 
               tiptoe and looks into front window of rowhouse.

               HIS POV: A small, battered color TV showing cartoons.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Somebody's home.

               PEMBLETON RAPS lightly on the window.

               HIS POV: JASON NAWLS, small ten year old boy, leans into 
               view, stares at PEMBLETON for a beat, leans out quickly.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Someone there?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         A little kid.

               The door opens. JASON stands in the threshold.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Hi.

               The little BOY stands mute, staring hard, puzzled at BAYLISS.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Is anyone else home?

                                     JASON
                         No.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Your Mom or Dad here?

                                     JASON
                         No.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Do you know where they are?

               No response.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Where can we find your Mom? We need 
                         to talk to her about Darryl.

                                     JASON
                         She's at work.

                                     BAYLISS
                         How about your Dad?

               No response.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         What's your name?

                                     JASON
                         Jason.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Mine's Frank. This is my partner 
                         Tim.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Hi, Jason.

               JASON stares at BAYLISS.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         How can I talk to your Mom or Dad?

                                     JASON
                         There ain't no Dad here.

               On PEMBLETON and BAYLISS, gazing at JASON,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               PEMBLETON and BAYLISS exit the Cavalier. BAYLISS opens the 
               rear door. JASON tumbles out of the rear seat, goes running 
               for the entrance.


               SONG CONTINUES. PEMBLETON, BAYLISS and UNIFORMS in Kevlar 
               vests, shotguns, sidearms drawn move quickly around the front 
               and back of a rowhouse. Other UNIFORMS move to cordon off 
               the area, redirect traffic, move PEDESTRIANS out of the way. 
               NEIGHBORS stick their heads out of their windows to see what's 
               going on. PEMBLETON crouches into a shooting position, KNOCKS 
               on the door.

               PEMBLETON's POV: A PRESENCE throws a shadow across the window 
               of the front door. A pair of eyes peek out of the front door's 
               window. The door opens slowly.

               PEMBLETON leads the charge into the rowhouse. BAYLISS and 
               UNIFORMS follow.


               An abandoned warehouse area next to the Proctor and Gamble 
               Company. A dozen HOMELESS are clustered around a garbage can 
               burning wood scraps. RONNY SAYERS, a small, skinny Black 
               kid, dressed in a Starter's Jacket, rests fitfully against a 
               wall, out of the wind. A hand reaches down to rouse RONNY. 
               PULL BACK to REVEAL PEMBLETON hovering over him. BAYLISS 
               stands to the side, a couple of UNIFORMS in the background, 
               HENRY, another young Black teenager dressed in a winter parka, 
               in their grasp.

                                     RONNY
                         What do you want?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Ronny, we're police.

               RONNY sees BAYLISS blocking him in. RONNY scrambles to his 
               feet, sees other UNIFORMS coming from all sides, encircling 
               him. He then sees HENRY.

                                     RONNY
                         Henry?

               HENRY shakes his head, looks to the ground.

                                     RONNY
                         Henry, you gave me up?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         C'mon, Ronny, let's go.

                                     RONNY
                         Go where? I'm not going anywhere.

               RONNY pulls out a twenty-two caliber semi-automatic handgun 
               from beneath his jacket. PEMBLETON and BAYLISS back away, 
               reaching for their guns.

                                     RONNY
                         What'd'ya gonna do, shoot me? Go 
                         'head, shoot me.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Easy, Ronny. No one's shooting anyone 
                         here.

               RONNY waving the gun around, yells at HENRY.

                                     RONNY
                         How come you did this to me, man? 
                         You're my friend.

                                     PEMBLETON
                              (his gun raised halfway)
                         Ronny, you have to put the gun down.

                                     RONNY
                         No.

                                     BAYLISS
                         Please.

                                     RONNY
                         What, you think I'm gonna shoot you? 
                         Okay, back up then.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         No one's backing up.

               RONNY begins to wave his gun around at the UNIFORMS.

                                     RONNY
                         What'd'ya want, huh?

               HOMELESS STRAGGLERS rouse themselves from their places watch 
               transfixed for a moment, then move away as the UNIFORMS take 
               cover.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         No one needs to get hurt here, son.

                                     RONNY
                         Is that right?

               RONNY puts the gun to his own head.

                                     RONNY
                         I ain't going with you.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Whoa, whoa, easy.

                                     RONNY
                         I can't go. You can't take me.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Put the gun down.

                                     RONNY
                         Why? Cause I'm gonna hurt myself? 
                         What'd'ya care?
                              (to HENRY)
                         Henry, you turned me out, man. You 
                         ain't my friend.

                                     PEMBLETON
                              (to RONNY)
                         Tell us about Darryl.

                                     RONNY
                         Who's Darryl?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You know.

                                     RONNY
                         I don't know any Darryl.

                                     BAYLISS
                         That's the kid who got hurt in the 
                         bowling alley.

                                     RONNY
                              (pausing)
                         His name is Basil.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Who?

                                     RONNY
                         Basil. Some punk who said he was 
                         going to get me.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         The kid who got hurt, his name is 
                         Darryl.

                                     RONNY
                         I know who got hurt. Basil.

                                     BAYLISS
                              (pausing)
                         His name wasn't Basil.

                                     RONNY
                         It wasn't?

               RONNY slowly lowers his gun, confused. PEMBLETON and BAYLISS 
               rush in and grab the gun from RONNY and wrestle him to the 
               ground. On RONNY, offering no resistance,


               MUNCH and LEWIS stand with SMITH-HADDON, looking at 
               architecture of building.

                                     MUNCH
                         Let me get this straight. We own 
                         this bar. But we're not allowed to 
                         renovate.

                                     SMITH-HADDON
                         Renovate, yes. Preserve, yes. What 
                         you cannot do is anything that would 
                         destroy the historical value.

                                     LEWIS
                         It's old. You want to keep it old.

                                     SMITH-HADDON
                         Your restaurant is a piece of 
                         Baltimore history, Mr. Munch. It's 
                         assumed to be the second brick 
                         structure built in the City. It's 
                         over two-hundred years old.

                                     LEWIS
                         If these bricks could talk, huh?

                                     SMITH-HADDON
                         Surely you can understand our desire 
                         to protect that history, especially 
                         in connection to George Washington.

                                     MUNCH
                         George Washington?

                                     SMITH-HADDON
                         George Washington... In 1793, he was 
                         traveling from Mount Vernon to 
                         Philadelphia. He stopped here.

                                     MUNCH
                         He stopped here?

                                     SMITH-HADDON
                         Of course, it was a residence at the 
                         time...

                                     LEWIS
                         George Washington slept here?

                                     SMITH-HADDON
                         Well, no...

                                     MUNCH
                         He had dinner?

                                     SMITH-HADDON
                         No.

                                     LEWIS
                         So what did he do here?

                                     SMITH-HADDON
                         Apparently the President, just coming 
                         from a dinner party where he had 
                         consumed quite a bit of wine, was in 
                         something of a bind. He had no time 
                         to seek out a public chamber pot.

                                     MUNCH
                         Are you telling us the reason we 
                         can't tear down the bathroom is that 
                         it's where George Washington once 
                         took a whizz?

               SMITH-HADDON, embarrassed, can only nod.

                                     LEWIS
                         I guess when you gotta go, you gotta 
                         go... Even if you're the Father of 
                         our Country.

               On MUNCH and LEWIS, looking at The Waterfront with new 
               respect,

                                                                    CUT TO:


               PEMBLETON and BAYLISS walk down the front stairs.

                                     BAYLISS
                         We should find out when Darryl's 
                         funeral is.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         You know, the wife and I were talking 
                         the other day about children. About 
                         maybe having a kid.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You, a father?

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Something wrong with that?

                                     BAYLISS
                         No. No, I think it'd be great.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         How do I bring a child into this 
                         world when we have to charge children 
                         with first-degree murder?

                                     BAYLISS
                         Ah, but it'd be different for you.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Different?

                                     BAYLISS
                         Yeah. You... y'know...

                                     PEMBLETON
                         What?

               They head off toward the parking lot. BAYLISS shrugs.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You know...

                                     PEMBLETON
                         Spit it out, Tim.

                                     BAYLISS
                         You know what I'm saying.

                                     PEMBLETON
                         But let me hear you say it.

                         It would just be different. You have 
                         different... circumstances.

                         Because I don't live in the ghetto? 
                         'Cause I'm not living in Ronny's 
                         neighborhood?

                         Well, don't you have the means to 
                         give a child a better chance?

                         AIDS came along, same thing. It won't 
                         happen in my neighborhood.

               the courthouse, a line of PRISONERS in County Jail jumpsuits 
               boarding. They're locked down in hand and leg irons and 
               attached to a chain. A County Jail OFFICER pushes RONNY onto 
               the bus. SAYERS watches from the side entrance.

                         That ain't a school bus Ronny's going 
                         on.
