WOODS - DAY
A mural of leafless trees beneath an overcast sky.
Rain
continues to fall.
Maybe now we begin to notice a strange quality to the light
(or is it the sky?).
Something vaguely unsettling.
CUT TO:
ROAD - DAY
Less like a road and more like a path that you maneuver a
vehicle through.
The Man, dressed in rain gear, walks down the middle.
He is
accompanied by a medium-sized LABRADOR, and seems in no
particular hurry.
The sound of tires appear and grow in intensity.
The Man,
without saying an actual word, instructs the dog to heal.
The dog obeys as the Man moves off the road.
The vehicle
hurtles past him -- its engine quiet, its windows darkened --
spraying muddy debris in its wake.
Seconds later, the car brakes abruptly and skids to a stop.
THE MAN
Stops walking and stares at the car, which seems ominously
still.
The car then reverses direction and begins to move toward the
Man, who remains motionless.
When the car is alongside him, a darkened window turns
transparent and we see a WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT in the rear
seat.
His demeanor is pleasant and professional.
WELL-DRESSED BUREAUCRAT
Dr. Kelvin?
The Man he is addressing, who we now understand is CHRIS
KELVIN, stares back at him.
CUT TO:
SPACE
The Athena 7, sporting a DBA logo, advances toward the
Prometheus.
CUT TO:
SPACE
Solaris.
Quiet, but still active somehow.
KELVIN (V.O.)
The Prometheus, as far as I can
tell, is functionally intact.
Crew
status: One dead, Gibarian.
Cause
of death appears to be suicide.
CUT TO:
SPACE
A shot hovering over the surface of Solaris.
SOLARIS
Turning, slowly.
CUT TO:
SOLARIS
The fog-shrouded surface, shifting and turning like an ocean.
CUT TO:
SOLARIS
Turning slowly.
CUT TO:
SOLARIS
Turning, slowly.
CUT TO:
STREET CORNER - DAY
Ten years ago.
Kelvin and Rheya standing on a street corner.
They seem to be pausing in the midst of a very serious
conversation.
It is raining.
CUT TO:
STREET
Kelvin moving down a crowded sidewalk, in slow motion.
KELVIN (V.O.)
I am home now.
(beat)
I try to find the rhythm of the
world where I used to live... but I
feel completely and continually out
of-sync.
I am separate.
Why did I
return to Earth and lie about what
happened?
Lie about having contact
with something like Solaris?
I
knew something else was out there,
and didn't tell a soul.
I left
them in the dark.
We all did.
CUT TO:
KELVIN'S CABIN - DAY
Kelvin returns.
He stops and looks around before entering
his front door.
KELVIN (V.O.)
So why come back at all?
To see if
she comes here?
KEVIN'S POV
Of the woods.
But there are strange incongruities in the image -- pieces of
the Prometheus breaking through; for instance, a few of the
AUTOMATED TASKMASTERS are crawling along the ground.
KELVIN
Looking from the doorway, notes this.
He doesn't seem
surprised, though.
KELVIN (V.O.)
I don't believe it will happen.
SOLARIS
Still turning, slowly.
But something about its appearance is different.
SPACE
Silence.
The Prometheus moves away from Solaris.
CLOSER ON SOLARIS
After the ship has gone.
A soft black spot begins to form in the center of the planet.
Slowly, inexorably, this black spot begins to expand.
Within a minute Solaris has disappeared.
CUT TO:
STREET CORNER - DAY
Kelvin, back on Earth.
Silent and still.
And the rain
continues.
He watches the activity; the cars, buses, and people moving
to and fro.
KELVIN (V.O.)
Earth.
(beat)
What did that word mean to me?
(beat)
I have returned.
Finally.
Kelvin begins to walk.
KELVIN (V.O.)
I work in the city now.
After work
I wander and lose myself.
I am
silent and attentive.
I follow the
current.
I make a conscious effort
to smile, nod, stand, and perform
the millions of gestures that
constitute life on Earth.
ROAD - DAY
Kelvin makes his way toward his cabin.
As he nears, his
LABRODOR recognizes him and approaches.
Kelvin pats the dog's coat.
KELVIN (V.O.)
I will not... give myself.
I will
not give myself to anything or
anyone, because I am haunted by the
idea that I remembered her wrong.
That I shaded my memory of her to
suit myself.
That I was unfair to
her and caused her destruction.
What if I was wrong about
everything?
(beat)
I've come to believe that memory is
a curse.
CABIN - DAY
Kelvin is near the front door, dog at his heel.
He looks in
as he brings his key to the lock and his face FREEZES.
RHEYA
Is in the living room, waiting for him.
She is sitting on the sofa, looking toward the other side of
the room.
Sensing someone, she turns to see Kelvin, and her
face melts into a smile.
KELVIN
Opens the door.
He cannot speak.
RHEYA
Rises and moves toward him.
They embrace.
He breathes her in.
She squeezes him.
After a long beat:
KELVIN
How can you be here...
RHEYA
(whispering)
Shhhh.
Just stay with me.
(beat)
Stay with me.
Everything is
forgiven.
Everything.
She sways with him, gently.
His body relaxes.
KELVIN
I love you.
CABIN - DAY
A tableau of the cabin.
The dog is on the front step,
seemingly content despite the light rain.
As fog drifts in, we RISE, and soon the mist has nearly
obscured the house.
The fog turns into clouds and we get
fleeting glimpses of the cabin, as we move farther and
farther away.
We stay in a translucent white stage for a few moments, until
gradually the edges of a circle become apparent in the
corners of the frame.
Still there is a light rain sound.
These dark, rounded edges penetrate further until they are
forming the shape of a circle.
The misty consistency begins to gain some color and body.
And we realize we are now looking at the surface of Solaris.
FADE OUT.
