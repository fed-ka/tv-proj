Four flights up: Frank and Larry climbing rotting steps,
gray-yellow painted walls, red doors with three locks each,
Larry, out of breath, his stomach rolling around like a
bowling ball in a bag.
CUT TO:
They enter 5A. MRS. BURKE, 55, her eyes run dry, standing in
the center of the room, surrounded by neighbors. Someone
leads them to the BEDROOM where Mr. Burke, 60, lies unmoving,
stretched on the bed. A young woman, MARY BURKE, 24, kneels
over the old man, pressing her lips to his flaccid mouth.
JOHN BURKE, 30, grabs Franks arm:
JOHN
We were just watching TV and Dad
yelled out and started punching his
chest, next thing he locked himself
in the bathroom. I said we were gonna
call you guys and he said not to.
He was crying, I never heard him
crying before, then he sorta stopped.
We pulled him out and put him on the
bed.
Frank and Larry moving the body to the floor:
FRANK
How long ago did he stop breathing?
JOHN
Maybe ten minutes. Woman on the phone
tried to tell us how to do CPR.
Please, you gotta do something.
FRANK
We'll do all we can.
Larry ripping open Mr. Burke's shirt, prepping electrode
patches, hooking wires, Frank opening Burke's mouth, feeling
a puff of gas escape; Larry calling for backup. Burke's EKG
rhythm on the monitor a flat green line.
Frank's training takes over: he injects the long steel
laryngoscope down Burke's throat, he finds a vein, injects
epinephrine, followed by atrophine, followed by another epi:
no response on the monitor. Larry pulls out the paddles:
FRANK (CONT'D)
Clear! Clear!
Larry activates defibrillator, shock--Burke's body heaves.
Sweat drips from Larry's nose onto Burke's chest.
MARY
No more, please don't!
They shock him again. This time the body moves less. Frank
glances up: Mr. and Mrs. Burke's wedding photo sits on the
nightstand. Other pictures: a day at the beach, a young
serviceman, happy parents. Frank's mind drifts:
FRANK (V.O.)
In the last year I had come to believe
in such things as spirits leaving
the body and not wanting to be put
back, spirits angry at the awkward
places death had left them.
I
understood how crazy it was to think
this way, but I was convinced if I
turned around, I'd see Old Man Burke
standing at the window, watching,
waiting for us to finish.
Frank feels Burke's heart beneath cracked ribs. The EEG
remains flat. He's dead. It's time to quit.
FRANK (CONT'D)
(to Larry)
I'll take over. Call ER and ask for
an eighty-three.
(to Mrs. Burke)
Sorry.
Larry stands, breathing heavy, looks for a phone. Frank turns
to notice relatives and neighbors standing around.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Do you have any music?
MARY
What?
FRANK
Music. I think it helps if you play
something he liked.
MARY
John, play the Sinatra.
John enters crying. Mary repeats softly:
MARY
Play the Sinatra.
John exits. Frank notices Mary for the first time: blond
hair dyed black, cut short, loose fitting tank dress, black
makeup running down her cheeks. He notices her prom picture,
glances back to Mary: it seems she hasn't smiled since that
day eight years before. Something special about her, that
something that hits you right away.
"September of My Years" plays from the other room. Frank
continues massaging Mr. Burke's chest (now to Sinatra beat),
even though it's hopeless. Larry returns:
LARRY
It's OK, Frank. We can call it. Eighty-
three.
Frank feels something strange, looks into Burke's pupils,
checks his neck pulse, wrist pulse. His eyes go to Larry:
FRANK
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
LARRY
No shit.
Larry checks the monitor: the green line up and down. Mary
senses a change in status:
MARY
Is he going to be alright?
FRANK
(not encouraging)
His heart's beating.
A distant siren signals the arrival of backup. Frank turns
to Larry:
FRANK (CONT'D)
Have 'em bring up a stretcher.
He looks from Mary back to Mr. Burke--breathing but comatose.
CUT TO:
Larry climbing through the back doors, sitting in the jumpseat
at the stretcher's head as Frank hangs IV bags, replugs EKG
wires that have come loose.
Frank looks up, sees Mary entering; he takes her arm, turns
her toward the rear doors:
FRANK
Help your family. Ride with your
mother and brother.
(she hesitates)
Help your family. They need you more.
Help yourself.
Mary steps out, stands in the red flashing light as Larry
closes the door, Frank climbs in the driver's seat.
CUT TO:
Every large city has a hospital Emergency Room so replete
with trauma, violence and suffering it picks up the sobriquet
"Knife and Gun Club." On Manhattan's Lower East Side it's
our Lady Of Mercy, aka, Our Lady of Misery.
ER: a white-lit cement box painted yellow and decorated with
old framed Playbills. Four rows of six plastic chairs face a
TV bolted and chained to the ceiling. The seats are filled
with backed-up drunks, assault victims and "regulars,"
bleeding and spilling over against the walls and the floor,
getting up to ask their status or going out to throw up and
have a smoke.
Larry and Frank wheeling Burke in, two IV lines, each
connected to an elbow, tangled in EKG cables. Two LACERATED
RUSSIANS scramble out of their way as they approach GRISS,
the large black sunglassed security guard. He looks up from
his television guide:
GRISS
Hey partner. Your man does not look
well. They're not gonna appreciate
you inside.
FRANK
(pumping Ambu-bag)
Griss, let us in.
GRISS
Things are backing up.
Griss pushes a button, activating the automatic door, striking
the bandaged leg of a man lying down on a stretcher in the
hall. Larry and Frank wheel Burke inside. A pleading family
tries to follow. Griss stretches out his hand:
GRISS (CONT'D)
You can't go in there, folks.
Mary, John and Mrs. Burke rush in from the street, hoping
some miracle has occurred during the drive to the hospital,
approach the sign-in desk.
Frank and Larry pass four stretchers lined against the wall--
a passage nicknamed "Skid Row" leading past triage NURSE
CONSTANCE's station.
NURSE CONSTANCE
Just keep moving. Don't even slow
down.
Nurse Constance turns back to the nervous man seated beside
her:
NURSE CONSTANCE (CONT'D)
Sir, you say you've been snorting
cocaine for three days and now you
feel your heart is beating too fast
and you would like us to help you.
To tell the truth, I don't see why I
should. If I'm mistaken, correct me.
Did we sell you the cocaine? Did we
push it up your nose?
Larry and Frank slow at the last Skid Row stretchers. On
one, NOEL, a young dark-skinned man with chaotic mess of
dreadlocks, pulls feverishly at his restraints:
NOEL
For God's sake, give me some water.
From the next stretcher a man with feet swollen purple like
prize eggplants replies:
BIG FEET
Shut up! Goddamn civilians.
NOEL
Give me some water!
NURSE CRUPP stops Frank and Larry as they approach the
Critical care room. inside, the staff appears as if under
siege by a battalion of shriveled men and women lying on a
field of white sheets.
NURSE CRUPP
Don't take another step. We're on
diversion. Can't accept any more
patients. Your dispatcher should
have told you.
FRANK
We got him at Eighteen and Second.
You're closest.
NURSE CRUPP
Where will I put him, Frank? Look.
Tell me.
FRANK
He wanted to come here. Said the
nurses at Misery were the best.
NURSE CRUPP
(acquiesces)
All right, give me a minute. I'll
kick someone out of slot three.
Larry unravels himself from the IV lines as nurse walks over,
takes Burke's pulse.
NOEL
(to Frank)
Excuse me. You are a very kind man.
I can see that. A man like you could
not refuse a poor sick dying helpless
man a small cup of water.
FRANK
I can't. I have to stay with my
patient.
BIG FEET
Shut the fuck up! If it wasn't for
these dun feet I'd get up and kick
your ass!
DR. HAZMAT, 30, steps over.
HAZMAT
Godammit, guys, what are you doing
to me? We're all backed up in here.
Christ, would you look at him? He's
gonna need the works. What's wrong
with him?
LARRY
You should know. You pronounced him.
HAZMAT
You told me he was dead. Flatline.
FRANK
He got better.
HAZMAT
I hate pronouncing people dead over
the phone.
(flashes light in
Burke's eyes)
Better, huh? They're fixed and
dilated. He's plant food.
NURSE CRUPP
(returning)
We stole a stretcher from X-ray. No
pad on it, but I don't think he'll
mind. Put him in three, next to the
overdose.
HAZMAT
He's our lowest priority now. He
shouldn't even be here. All this
technology. What a waste.
Back at SECURITY, the Burkes confront Griss.
GRISS
Please folks, step back.
(they hesitate)
Don't make me take off my sunglasses.
In CRITICAL CARE, Larry wheels Burke into unit three as Dr.
Hazmat turns Frank to face the room, explaining:
HAZMAT
First-time heart attack, age 45.
Should have gone to the CCU ten hours
ago. There's three bodies up there
Mike the one you just brought in.
over there, two AIDS patients, one
in twelve filling up with liquid.
I'm gonna hafta intubate because the
kid's mother won't sign the Do Not
Resuscitate. Mercy killing doesn't
translate well in Spanish. It's a
sin to tube this kid. Three more ODs
from some new killer junk. They call
it Red Death.
Hazmat pulls out a vial marked with a red skull and
crossbones, shows it to Frank.
NOEL
Water, water, water, doctor man,
water.
HAZMAT
A mix of heroin and I don't know
what else, some kind of amino acid
maybe. Stuff so strong they're
drinking it with grain alcohol. You
have to use ten times the usual amount
of Narcan and watch out when they
wake up, liable to go nuts on you.
FRANK
(about Noel)
He one of them?
HAZMAT
No, that's Noel. Used to be a regular
off and on, hasn't been in in a while.
He seized and almost coded--I gave
him a hypertonic solution. He drank
so much the kidneys were taking out
salt. One for the textbooks.
NOEL
Oh doctor, you are the greatest. You
must help me.
BIG FEET
For God's sake, give him a drink of
water.
HAZMAT
I am helping you, Noel. You could
die if you drink more water.
Nurse Crupp pulls on Hazmat's arm.
HAZMAT (CONT'D)
What is it?
She points to Burke. His monitor is ringing like a fire alarm.
Hazmat and Crupp rush over, wave to others:
HAZMAT (CONT'D)
Crupp, start CPR. Milagros, get me
an epi. Odette wake up Dr. Stark.
Tell him I need a blood gas, stat.
As the staff crowds around Burke, pulling the paddles from
off the monitor, Frank, pushing his stretcher away, notices
Big Feet climb onto his infected feet, hobble over, work to
untie Noel.
NOEL
Bless you sir, bless you.
BIG FEET
Shut up.
Frank heads down Skid Row pushing the stretcher, passing
Nurse Constance speaking with a man with a gash over his
eye:
NURSE CONSTANCE
... so you get drunk every day and
you fall down. Tell me why we should
help you when you're going to get
drunk tomorrow and fall down again?
Frank pushes the automatic door button--and is suddenly hit
from behind by Noel. The stretcher spins sideways. Noel
dives out the doors for the water fountain, snorting up water
like a bull. Mary Burke, standing with her family, looks at
Frank.
FRANK
(stock reply)
He's very very sick.
MARY
I know him. That's Noel.
FRANK
We'd better go outside. Quickly.
Frank and Mary step out into the humid night.
CUT TO:
Griss holding up his hand:
GRISS
Get that stinky-assed motherfucking
bug-ridden skell out of my face.
Frank and Larry stand beside Oh slumped in his wheelchair.
Fellow drunks welcome their comrade from plastic chairs.
Nurse Constance escorts a young man from the triage area:
NURSE CONSTANCE
I would have to register you to give
you something to eat and my conscience
just will not allow that. Griss,
the gentleman wants to leave.
(looks at Oh)
He looks pale. You're not eating
enough. You need more fiber.
Griss shows young man the door.
LARRY
(holds up his report)
He's wasted. That's my diagnosis:
shit-faced.
NURSE CONSTANCE
He just needs a bath and some food.
Take him in back and see if you can
find a stretcher.
LARRY
(to Frank)
She's nuts. That's why he comes here.
She encourages him.
Griss returns as Crupp calls from critical care area:
NURSE CRUPP
Don't you dare! That's my last
stretcher. This is not a homeless
shelter. He'll have to wait in the
lobby.
GRISS
No way man. Not even in the corner.
Griss cannot abide the funk tonight.
Larry and Frank turn, secretly pleased, and wheel Mr. Oh
outside.
CUT TO:
Larry charging through the night while, in back, Frank,
stethoscope in his ears, wrapping a tourniquet around the
Drug Dealer's arm: he's dying fast.
FRANK
You're gonna feel a stick in your
arm. Don't move.
DRUG DEALER
I don't want to die.
NOEL
I want to die. I'm the one.
DRUG DEALER
Oh Jesus, I don't want to die.
FRANK
You're not going to die.
NOEL
What did you say?
FRANK
(to Noel)
Shut up. You're going to die and
he's not. Got it.
DRUG DEALER
(weak)
Hold my hand.
FRANK
I can't. I got to do the other arm.
DRUG DEALER
Please.
FRANK
(to Noel)
Hold this--right there. If you let
go, I swear, I won't kill you.
Noel holds IV bag as Frank searches for a vein, inserts second
IV needle.
CUT TO:
Frank finishes his report, hands a copy to the clerk, looks
around the now almost empty waiting area. John Burke sleeps
slumped in one of the chairs. Griss stands at his post.
Pulling out a pack of cigarettes, Frank steps outside.
CUT TO:
Frank's studio apartment betrays a minimal existence: single
bed, table, fridge and stove, loveseat, bookshelf, television.
The bookshelf contains a CD player, medical texts, old
schoolbooks ("Romantic Poetry"), paperback novels and,
incongruously, a picture book of women's fashion.
A framed commendation from the New York Fire Department hangs
beside and open closet of work clothes, corduroy jacket, two
ties on a hook. Remnants of a fast food breakfast on the
table. Aluminum foil covers the windows, blocking out the
sunlight.
Frank stands bareback at the single open window, smoking,
drinking from a glass of whiskey, looking across the gray
cityscape of high rises and water tanks: winding down from
the night's work:
FRANK (V.O.)
Saving someone's life is like falling
in love, the best drug in the world.
For days, sometimes weeks afterwards,
you walk the street making infinite
whatever you see. Once, for weeks I
couldn't feel the earth. Everything
I touched became light. Horns played
in my shoes; flowers fell from my
pockets ...
TIME DISSOLVES: Frank paces the room. Pours himself another
drink.
FRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
You wonder if you've become immortal,
as if you saved your own life as
well. What was once criminal and
happenstance suddenly makes sense.
God has passed through you, why deny
it, that for a moment there, God was
you.
TIME DISSOLVE: window is closed. Frank tosses in his sleep.
Nightstand alarm buzzes. Frank sits up, looks at the clock.
Stretching his neck, he walks over to the sink, runs water
on his hands and face.
CUT TO:
Frank standing on one foot before the desk of CAPTAIN BARNEY,
50, ex-paramedic and lifetime civil servant.
FRANK
Good morning, Captain.
Capt. Barney looks over to MISS WILLIAMS, his secretary,
seated at a desk perpendicular to his:
CAPT. BARNEY
What am I going to to do with this
guy?
(to Frank)
Pierce, I was just on the phone with
Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts
this month, you've been late for
nine, sick four and that includes
the shift where you came late and
went home early.
FRANK
I'm sick. That's what I've been
telling you.
CAPT. BARNEY
You're killing me, you know that?
You got no sick time according to
Command. I've been told to terminate.
FRANK
It's okay. I'll just get my things
out of the locker.
CAPT. BARNEY
I've never fired anyone in my life.
FRANK
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too
hard.
CAPT. BARNEY
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I
told them: shove it up the big one.
(looks at Miss Williams)
Sorry.
(back to Frank)
I said, you want to fire him, come
over and do it yourself.
FRANK
You know they won't do it. It's up
to you. You gotta be strong.
CAPT. BARNEY
I feel for you, but we got an
emergency here. It's a weekend of
full moons.
Everyone's called in
sick. Larry, Veeber, Stanley too.
We need bodies out there. I had to
put Marcus on Twelve Young. You know
he's not supposed to work two nights
in a row.
FRANK
You swore you'd fire me if I came in
late again.
CAPT. BARNEY
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better
than that, I'll forward you some
sick time. A week, two weeks off--
how about that?
FRANK
I don't think a week's gonna do it.
CAPT. BARNEY
I'm sorry, Pierce.
(hands Frank keys)
You're going out with Marcus. Duty
calls. The City needs you.
CUT TO:
Marcus grabs the yellow airway bag, leaving Frank to lug the
three heavier pieces as they push their way through the crowd
toward a black jacketed DOORMAN holding a walkie-talkie:
MARCUS
(to crowd)
I hope we're not late from you guys
holding us up here.
CUT TO:
The Doorman leads Frank and Marcus through the smoky graffiti-
covered backstage ante-rooms to a cubicle where a knot of
club types and band members hover around IB BANGIN, 18 year-
old white rapper, face up, blank-eyed and breathless on dirt-
impacted carpet. Hip-hop music echoes from the club PA.
Frank kneels beside IB Bangin, taking a pulse, realizing
it's the gray and black stage makeup making him seem DOA. He
pulls up IB Bangin's eyelid, shines a light into the pupil.
MARCUS
Okay, what happened?
DRUMMER
He's going to be all right, right?
MARCUS
No. He's dead.
DRUMMER
No way, man.
MARCUS
He's dead and there's nothing we can
do. Come on, Frank, that's it.
FRANK
(whispers)
He's not dead. It's a heroin overdose.
Break out the Narcon.
MARCUS
(announcing)
He's dead unless you folks want to
stop bullshitting me and tell it
straight. Then, Lord willing, we'll
try to bring him back.
BYSTANDER
He broke up with his old lady.
GIRLFRIEND
We didn't break up. We were just
seeing other people.
MARCUS
I'm still waiting and this young man
is still dead.
BYSTANDER
She broke his heart.
The Girlfriend shoots a look at the Bystander. Marcus just
stands, hands on hips, silent. Frank opens the drug box.
The Drummer relents:
DRUMMER
All right, all right, he's been
snorting that Red Death stuff. Been
going for four days.
MARCUS
(brings hands together)
What's his name?
DRUMMER
IB Bangin.
MARCUS
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind
of name is IB Bangin?
GIRLFRIEND
(Hesitant)
It's Frederick. Frederick Smith.
MARCUS
(to body)
Okay, Freddy.
GIRLFRIEND
It's Frederick.
MARCUS
Okay, IB Bangin, we're gonna bring
you back. Every person here grab the
hand of the person next to you.
Marcus assists them as Frank breaks the cellophane off a
syringe, locates a vial of Narcon. Frank gives Marcus the
high sign--Marcus raises his hands:
MARCUS (CONT'D)
Oh Lord, here I am again to ask one
more chance for a sinner. Bring back
IB Bangin, Lord. You have the power,
the might, the super light, to spare
this worthless man.
Frank injects IB Bangin: he responds to the Narcon with a
jolt, opening his eyes, raising his hands.
GIRLFRIEND
(kneeling)
Frederick!
BYSTANDER
Oh wow, man. Oh wow.
IB BANGIN
(sick)
What happened?
GIRLFRIEND
You died, you stupid bastard. I warned
you.
DRUMMER
You guys are awesome.
FRANK
(to IB Bangin)
C'mon.
Frank and the Girlfriend guide IB Bangin to the door as Marcus
collects the gear.
MARCUS
Not us. The first step is Love. The
second is Mercy.
He follows Frank, IB Bangin and Girlfriend out, calling for
the crowd to clear.
CUT TO:
IB Bangin sitting with Nurse Constance in triage. Past Griss,
Frank talks with Dr. Hazmat:
FRANK
That guy I brought in yesterday,
post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
HAZMAT
Burke. You won't believe it. He's
showing cognitive signs. He started
with spontaneous respiration, now
he's fighting to pull out the tube.
Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT
scan. I'm giving him every test I
can: thromboytics, steroids,
nitrodrips, heparin.
FRANK
What do you think?
HAZMAT
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem-
activity. The heart refuses to
stabilize--he's coded eleven times
since he got here. This guy's a
fighter. Every time the Valium wears
off he starts yanking those
restraints.
FRANK
The family know?
HAZMAT
I wanted to bring them in, to see if
he'd respond to voices, but they
weren't in the waiting room. The
guy's daughter was in my face all
last night and when I finally have
something positive to tell her, she's
gone.
Frank nods, walks down Skid Row, passing Nurse Constance
lecturing IB Bangin:
NURSE CONSTANCE
... you put poison in your veins and
now that you're breathing again you
can't wait to say thank you and go
back to poison shopping. Well, since
we saved your life, maybe you could
do us a favor and stop breathing in
another city next time ...
CUT TO:
Frank and Mary walking past the triage station toward the
curtained corner where her father lies. Next to Burke, Dr.
Hazmat assists an AIDS patient amid a forest of IV tubing.
Mr. Burke lies prone, two IV lines hung from poles, intubated
by a hose running to the ventilator, a NG tube covering his
nose. His eyes are permanently half open. Burke's hands and
feet are tied by white nylon restraints. Mary takes her
father's hand as Frank pulls the curtain.
MARY
Dad, can you hear me?
(beat)
Open your eyes if you can hear me.
A nearby patient SCREAMS. Mary Burke SCREAMS too:
MARY (CONT'D)
He squeezed my hand!
Dr. Hazmat and MILAGROS, an intern, walk over.
MARY (CONT'D)
He's moving, Doctor. He grabbed my
hand. Move your hand, Dad, one more
time.
(Burke's hand twitches))
See. See.
HAZMAT
I'll be damned.
(check's Burke's pupils)
It's movement, but I'm not sure how
voluntary.
MARY
He hears me. Open your eyes, Dad.
Burke's eyes fully open. His cheeks ripple and his lips smack
against the tube between them. His back arches, his body
shakes, his arms yank at their restraints as if reaching to
pull out the wires and tubes. Green lights dance across the
EKG screen, ALARMS sound: first the cardiac monitor, next
the ventilator.
HAZMAT
Nurse Crupp, I need ten milligrams
of Valium.
Hazmat and Milagros hold down Burke's arms as Crupp prepares
the Valium. Mary backs away.
FRANK
Why don't we go outside for a little
while, wait until this passes.
They step away.
CUT TO:
Passing Griss (reading anti-white agitprop) and waiting room
regulars, Frank leads Mary to a small rectangular paramedic
locker area: sofa, desk, two banks of gray lockers, walls
decorated with hospital rules and regulations.
FRANK
He wants to pull that tube out. It's
pretty painful--that's why they keep
him sedated--but it's a good sign.
MARY
You sure? I know my father would
hate to be tied down. He wouldn't
even go to the dentist.
He sits across from her, wishing he could be in three seats
at once, each to watch her from a different angle.
FRANK
That's how it's done. You have to
keep the body going until the brain
and heart recover enough to go on
their own.
MARY
He's better, though, right?
FRANK
(reluctant)
He's better.
MARY
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important
to me. I mean, a week ago I was
wishing he was dead. And now I want
hear his voice again, just once more--
you know what I mean?
Marcus enters with a small pizza and two cokes.
MARCUS
Went over to Sal's got this. There
must be some place in Hell for a guy
who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I
call you if anything comes up.
FRANK
Thanks.
Marcus exits.
MARY
I'm not really hungry.
She says as she picks up a slice of cheese pizza.
MARY (CONT'D)
My father was a great man, you know.
There was nobody he wouldn't help.
You know that crazy guy Noel who I
gave water to last night? He lived
in our house for almost a year. A
total stranger he'd do anything for,
his own family though ...
FRANK
It's best not to ...
(off her look)
It's good pizza, huh?
MARY
Not as good as Nino's.
FRANK
You remember that pizza place, Joe's
on Tenth Street maybe fifteen years
ago?
When you ordered a pie it came
with a little plastic madonna in the
middle?
MARY
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the
neighborhood?
FRANK
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to
Blessed Sacrament.
MARY
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd
you go to high school?
FRANK
We moved out after that. Upstate.
MARY
Like everybody else--except us. Always
standing on the sidewalk waving
goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents
... ?
FRANK
They're fine. My old man was a bus
driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of
born to it, I guess.
MARY
You married?
FRANK
Ah, no. I was.
(beat)
It's hard to explain. She had a hard
time adjusting to, well, maybe it
was my fault too.
Pause.
This thought hangs in the air. From outside: a
BELLICOSE DRUNK is escorted into the ER.
DRUNK (O.S.)
White cocksuckers! Get your--Ow!
MARY
Is it always this bad in here? I
mean, how does anyone survive?
FRANK
It's been bad lately, but it's always
bad.
MARY
How long you been doing this?
FRANK
Five years.
MARY
Wow, you musta seen some things,
huh? What's the worst thing you ever
seen?
FRANK
You learn to sort of block it out,
you know, like cops fence off a crime
scene. But then something good will
happen and everything will just glow.
MARY
You must get a lot of overdoses. I
bet you picked me up a couple of
times.
FRANK
I think I'd remember that.
MARY
Maybe not. I was a different person
then. Does everybody you meet spill
their problems on you like this?
FRANK
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother
always said I looked like a priest.
MARY
(wipes her mouth)
I better go check on my father. Thanks
for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe
when he gets better, you know, when
we're done with all this.
FRANK
Sure.
Frank puts his hand out but she's already on her feet. He
grabs the last slice of pizza, hands it to Griss as she heads
back to Critical Care.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Look after her, Griss, okay?
Griss nods.
CUT TO:
Frank and Marcus standing in a no-income apartment with their
cardiac equipment. MARIA, a 17 year-old Hispanic girl, lies
moaning and breathing shallow on a ratty sofa. CARLOS, her
equally young boyfriend, watches anxiously, holding a candle
for light.
MARCUS
Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a
first.
FRANK
(to Maria)
What's wrong.
Carlos speaks broken English:
CARLOS
No English. She has terrible pain in
her belly.
FRANK
(hands on stomach)
Pregnant.
CARLOS
No, no, that's impossible.
FRANK
Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
Maria shakes her head, looks away.
FRANK (CONT'D)
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
CARLOS
She say she in great pain.
FRANK
Thanks for the translation.
(to Maria)
What's your name? Nombre?
MARIA
Maria.
FRANK
Let's have a look.
MARCUS
(to Carlos)
You know each other a long time?
CARLOS
Two years. Ever since we left island.
MARCUS
In that time, you ever have sex?
CARLOS
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no
booze.
MARCUS
No underwear?
CARLOS
We are virgins.
FRANK
(inspecting Maria)
Oh Jesus, we'd better go. Call for
backup.
Marcus radioing for assistance.
FRANK (CONT'D)
It's coming.
(to Carlos)
Hold her down.
MARCUS
What's that, Frank?
FRANK
Three legs.
MARCUS
That's too many.
FRANK
Backup?
MARCUS
It's coming.
CARLOS
Is she dying?
FRANK
She's having a baby. Twins.
CARLOS
Es impossible.
FRANK
You can trust me on this one.
CARLOS
It's a miracle.
Maria SCREAMS. Marcus kneels beside Frank as a distant EMS
siren grows louder.
FRANK
You take the first one.
Frank looks up at the screaming mother: it's not her face.
It's Rose. The Rose face.
CUT TO:
Frank rushing past Nurse Constance, carrying a newborn in
thermal wrap, passing Noel restrained on a gurney:
FRANK
She had a pulse.
NURSE CONSTANCE
Code! Code Blue!
Hazmat rushing over:
HAZMAT
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor.
Where's the pediatric code cart?
(Odette arriving with
cart)
Odette give me that tube. All right,
flatline--let's do CPR. step back,
Frank. How many months?
FRANK
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins.
The other one seems okay, though.
Marcus is taking him and the mother
to Maternity.
Across the room an obscenity-spouting FEMALE CRACKHEAD being
restrained by a patrolman and hospital security--adding to
the sense of emergency and chaos. DR. MISHRA, 50, Pediatric
MD, and nurses squeeze toward newborn edging Frank back.
Mishra takes an osteocatheter out of the cart, forces it
into the now obscured baby as Nurse Constance massages the
infant's chest.
Hazmat steps over to the now restrained Crackhead.
CRACKHEAD
I'm a mother! I got a daughter! I
got rights!
HAZMAT
(to nurse)
10 mil Valium, stat.
Mishra, worried, checks with Nurse Constance--they're losing
the newborn:
MISHRA
Status.
NURSE CONSTANCE
I think there's a pulse. I think.
Frank looking at the EKG monitor--a green flatline--backs
away.
MISHRA
Fuck.
NURSE CONSTANCE
Nothing.
Frank walking away, not looking where he's going, backs into
Noel's gurney.
NOEL
Excuse me, sir, excuse me, I would
please trouble you for one cup of
water. The smallest thing in the
world to ask for, water. A man is
dying and that is me.
Noel, his face battered from his encounter with Walls, pulls
at his restraints, howls:
NOEL (CONT'D)
For days I've eaten nothing but sand,
O Lord, I waited so long.
Hazmat looks over:
HAZMAT
Christ. Who the hell woke him up?
CUT TO:
The dinged metal doors shudder shut as Frank follows Mary
into the graffittied elevator. It jumps three feet upwards,
stops, then continues, metal scraping concrete at each passing
floor.
MARY
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
FRANK
You asked me not to come.
MARY
Promise you won't go inside.
FRANK
Fifteen minutes.
MARY
I just have to relax a little. Not
feel so guilty all the time.
FRANK
We can still go back. I'll walk you
home. You sleep a couple of hours,
watch some TV, take a bath.
MARY
Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts
about this, it's my fault.
The elevator jerks to a stop; the doors open.
CUT TO:
Mary turns to Frank:
MARY
You go on home, okay. I'm fine,
really. I don't need you. Thanks.
Mary pushes the bell at 16M. KANITA, 25, wearing a paisley
robe, opens the doors and says:
KANITA
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
COATES (O.S.)
Mary ...
The elevator doors close on Frank.
CUT TO:
Frank paces past the sleeping security guard, checks his
watch.
He presses the elevator button.
CUT TO:
The door to 16M opens:
KANITA
Can I help you?
FRANK
Mary Burke. She's a friend.
KANITA
She's not here.
Frank pushes past her.
KANITA (CONT'D)
Wait a minute. You can't go in.
CY COATES, 45, light-skinned black, stands in the smoky room.
Dark curtained windows block the sunlight; a dirty fish tank
casts a green glow across the beat-up furniture.
A large framed photo of a volcano hangs over the couch.
COATES
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
KANITA
He looks like a cop.
COATES
He's not a cop, he's a medic.
(extends hand)
I'm CY Coates.
FRANK
Frank Pierce.
COATES
Mary said you might be coming.
FRANK
Where is she?
COATES
Sleeping in the back.
FRANK
She asked me to pick her up.
COATES
I know, but she told me to tell you
she wants to crash here a few hours.
Terrible about her father, isn't it?
FRANK
I better just go in and see her.
Kanita sits on the sofa next to an unshaven sleeping man.
Coates gestures:
COATES
I call this the Oasis. Refuge from
the world out there. Did you know
two people were shot in this building
last week?
Frank heads down the hall toward the rear of the apartment;
Coates follows. They pass an open door where inside TIGER, a
fat man with dried blood running down the corner of his mouth,
sits punching computer keys at a desk.
COATES (CONT'D)
Careful. That's the Tiger. The lady's
down the hall. Welcome to Sunrise
Enterprises, Frank, the stress-free
factory.
In the NEXT ROOM Mary lies on a mattress on the floor, yellow
sheet pulled up to her neck. Frank leans over her:
FRANK
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
MARY
(groggy)
No, no.
COATES
She wanted something to help her
sleep.
FRANK
Mary, we really have to go.
Mary blindly swings her fist at him, collapses unconscious
back to the mattress.
COATES
Frank, she's suffered enough. She's
okay, I promise.
(puts hand on Frank's
shoulder)
C'mon, Frank.
Coates escorts Frank back to the LIVING ROOM.
COATES (CONT'D)
I'm always interested in people in
stressful occupations and being a
paramedic is about as stressful as I
can imagine. Here, sit down. What's
it like? Tell me some war stories.
FRANK
(sits)
Got a beer?
Cy sits across from him, pulls out a pin-sized joint, lights
it:
COATES
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't
drink alcohol here. What you need is
one of these.
FRANK
Did you give Mary something called
Red Death?
COATES
Red Death?
(passes joint to Kanita)
Tell me something, Frank--does killing
your clients make good business sense
to you? The kids selling that shit
have no sense. They'll be taken care
of, don't worry about that.
FRANK
I should be going. I just quit.
COATES
Sleep is all stress reduction. Here.
(offers white pill)
You take one of these, sleep two
hours, that's all you need.
(Frank hesitates)
Why do you think I'm telling you
this, Frank--for my health?
You
ought to look at yourself in the
mirror, man. Kanita, get him a glass
of water.
Frank watches as Kanita gets up, walks to the kitchen. Coates
places the pill in his hand.
FRANK
Is this what you gave Mary?
COATES
That's the stuff. I call it the Red
Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
No language, only brute power. You can't believe how relaxing
it is.
Kanita returns with a glass of water, gives it to Frank;
Coates stands, feeds the fish.
COATES (CONT'D)
Frank, I'm trying to help you.
Drink
up.
Frank swallows the white pill, drinks the water. He places
his arms on the chair:
FRANK
I guess I'll be going.
COATES
Just take it easy.
Frank looks around the smoke-filled room. Kanita walks over,
extends her hand.
KANITA
Take my pulse.
(he does)
It's good, isn't it?
FRANK
Perfect.
KANITA
I knew it. I was wrong about you.
You're not so bad.
Kanita runs her hand across his shoulders. Frank starts to
nod. The room getting warm and dark. His eyelids lower: sleep,
precious sleep.
CUT TO:
FRANK'S ROSE DREAM
Voices and sounds echo through the purple haze as Frank's
mind drifts in time and space. Action and sounds slow, speed
up, distort--intermix with the Oasis--as Frank goes back:
This is how it begins: the last time, the first time ...
Larry exits 13 Zebra as Rose, 18, wearing a yellow rain
slicker, falls to her knees in the miasmic dream stank, onto
the sidewalk, then onto her back. From forty feet away Frank,
seeing her reach for a parking meter, grabbing the tube kit,
running.
Rose gasping for breath, Frank falling to his knees, lifting
her tongue, prying her teeth apart, slipping the blade between
her lips--Rose not breathing: waiting for her to inhale,
shooting the tube down her vocal cords. Larry listening to
lung sounds, belly sounds:
LARRY
You're in the stomach!
FRANK
You sure?
ROSE
Rose!
FRANK
Huh?
ROSE
My name. Rose.
LARRY
You're in the stomach, man.
Frank pulling the tube out, trying again.
Somewhere: CY Coates laughs.
LARRY (CONT'D)
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
FRANK
One more time!
Rose going blue, pulse rate dropping, EKG Slowing: Jim
Morrison singing.
LARRY
Stomach again.
FRANK
No way!
Larry ripping the tube from Frank's hands, taking over,
pushing Frank aside, trying CPR, intubating Rose, air moving
into her lungs--it doesn't matter. Rose is gone.
Frank hears a SCREAM: it's his own voice.
CUT TO:
Frank standing screaming in the living room. CY walking over,
Kanita standing, the sleeping man awaking.
COATES
Frank, take it easy. what happened?
KANITA
He flipped out.
Frank bends over in pain.
COATES
Be cool, man. You're having a
paradoxical reaction. It can happen.
(to Kanita)
Didn't I tell you this guy was
stressed out?
KANITA
Stressed? He's psycho.
Frank heads to where Mary sleeps.
COATES
Frank, where you going?
In the BACK BEDROOM, Frank picks up Mary, hoists her over
his shoulder fireman-style and heads out.
COATES (CONT'D)
You're making a mistake. Sit down
and relax a minute.
Frank opens the front door--no one stops him--exits.
COATES (CONT'D)
(calling)
She'll be back. And, by the way, you
owe me ten bucks.
CUT TO:
The elevator doors open. Frank sets Mary on her feet.
MARY
I can walk.
She says weaving out of the front doors.
CUT TO:
Mary grabs the railing, heads up the stairs.
MARY
What is it? You want to help me, you
feel sorry for me? Keep it to
yourself.
FRANK
I need to sit down a minute.
MARY
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone
else has.
Mary opens the door to her first floor apartment; Frank
follows. The room is clean and feminine. Unframed water colors
stacked against the wall atop a desk. A black lab greets
Mary, she pets him. Frank slumps on the sofa.
MARY (CONT'D)
I've been clean two years now. I got
a job. I paint when I'm home. Don't
bother anybody. Then all this shit
happens.
Frank keels over onto his side, his head hitting a cushion,
eyes closed, dog licking his cheek.
MARY (CONT'D)
Oh no you don't. You can't stay here.
He's asleep, the sound of her crying fading in his head.
FADE OUT:
FADE IN: a passing siren wakes Frank. He thinks back, looking
around the darkened room, realizes where he is. The dog comes
over, licks his hand.
FRANK
Hello, I'm Frank. Mary's friend. A
very close friend who loves animals.
He removes the blanket Mary has laid over him, stands:
FRANK (CONT'D)
Hello?
Frank walks cautiously through the dark, finds a bathroom
lit by a glowing Mickey Mouse switch. He flips on the switch:
a string of green and red Christmas lights glow. Three types
of soap sit on the sink. He turns on the faucet:
FRANK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I washed my face with three kinds of
soap, each smelling like a different
season. It felt good to be in a
woman's room again, especially a
woman who wasn't comatose or severely
disabled. I felt that perhaps I had
turned a corner, like I saved someone,
though I didn't know who.
CUT TO:
Frank standing at Captain Barney's desk.
CAPT. BARNEY
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I
can't fire you. I've got nobody to
work sixteen XRay with Walls.
FRANK
No ...
CAPT. BARNEY
I got some forms here to fill out
about that accident when you get the
time.
(hands him keys)
I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
FRANK
What if there is no tomorrow?
CAPT. BARNEY
Go on, get outta here, Pierce, before
I give you a big hug.
(to Miss Williams)
I love this guy.
CUT TO:
Saturday night at the Knife and Gun Club: the joint is
hopping, the sound system blaring.
Frank passing Griss holding back an angry Hispanic man with
a bleeding arm:
GRISS
Don't make me take off my sunglasses.
FRANK
Morning, Griss.
NURSE CONSTANCE
We're full up tonight, Frank.
Frank walks over to unit three, Mr. Burke's cubicle, pulls
back the curtain. Burke lies sedated, wired and tubed. Frank
leans over, feels Burke's pulse.
Frank's expression changes--he looks at the EKG monitor:
green lines seem to be at war, normal beats marching in
formation against wild-looking rhythms, the heart working
hard and not getting much done.
Burke's face twitches. Burke's voice speaks in Frank's head:
BURKE'S VOICE
Go to the bank, boy, take out
everything you can.
Frank turns up the EKG amplitude:
FRANK
Mr. Burke?
BURKE'S VOICE
I'm going. I've had enough.
The alarms start to ring: EKG first, followed by the bells
off the oxygen saturation monitor and low drone of ventilator.
Intern Milagros pulling open the curtain behind Frank, shaking
her head, reaching for the defribilator paddles, handing
them to Frank. He steps back:
FRANK
You do it.
MILAGROS
Can't reach. You're taller.
BURKE'S VOICE
Don't do it.
FRANK
I thought he was getting better.
MILAGROS
Technically, yeah. I suppose. It
doesn't matter.
FRANK
Why not?
MILAGROS
Tha family wants us to do everything
to save him--so, that's it. They
want to keep him alive, they want to
believe in miracles, we keep him
alive. Shock him, Frank. He'll come
back. He always comes back.
FRANK
(takes paddles)
Clear!
Frank shocks Burke: his body convulses.
BURKE'S VOICE
Ow!
The heartbeats on monitor return to regular formation.
BURKE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
You son of a bitch.
MILAGROS
Should I increase the lidocaine?
Frank, despondent, not listening, walks away.
CUT TO:
Frank smoking at a formica table, his walkie-talkie upright
next to an ashtray. Walls returns with two espressos as the
Dispatcher rattles on.
WALLS
(sits)
Sounds like they're trying to clean
up the bus terminal tonight,
Frank doesn't answer. Tom shines his mini-flashlight in
Frank's eyes:
WALLS (CONT'D)
Hello, hello. Major Tom to Frank,
time to come home.
Frank watches a hooker on the sidewalk. Two street punks
dripping gold and attitude head the opposite direction: one
turns his head, looks at Frank--it's Rose. The Rose face.
Frank getting up, grabbing his walkie and coffee, heading
out.
WALLS (CONT'D)
Where you going?
FRANK
C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
CUT TO:
Frank and Tom, lugging their equipment, meet up with cops,
firemen and their rescue equipment.
FRANK
The elevator's fucked. We'd never
all fit anyway. Let's go.
FIREMAN
That's thirteen flights.
WALLS
The news guys just pulled up.
POLICE SERGEANT
The stairs, men, the stairs.
The Sergeant leads a half dozen cops and firemen up the stairs
as the elevator doors open. Tom, Frank and two COPS squeeze
inside.
WALLS
This guy a jumper?
COP
We got a call for shots fired on
the sixteenth floor. The jumper
called right after.
FRANK
(to Walls)
I'm going to sixteen.
As the elevator doors close.
CUT TO:
Frank steps out with the officers. The door to 16M is open:
Kanita lies half in, half out the door, a perfectly round
hole above her eye, splinters of bone and blood down the
side of her nose.
The carpet is soaked with water; shards of glass lie amid
dying fish. A cop returns from the rear hall of the apartment,
stands before photo of volcano:
COP
That's it, nobody else home.
Frank, looking over the balcony, sees Cy three floors below.
FRANK
I'm going to thirteen.
Frank heads clown the stairs.
CUT TO:
Frank emerges on thirteen: Walls, the panting Police Sergeant
and team have overturned the furniture in 13M: the absent
owners would have trouble recognizing it. The floor is covered
with gas-powered metal cutters, acetylene torches, ropes,
harnesses.
A trail of blood leads to where Walls stands, Tiger's prone
body behind him:
WALLS
Get this, Frank--we got two patients.
Number one, the scarecrow outside.
Number two misses the railing but
breaks both legs on the balcony,
then throws himself through a glass
window, heads to the bedroom, where
he's now passed out.
FRANK
(about Coates)
Well, he's the steakhead of the night,
then.
WALLS
I don't think the fire people can
touch him out there.
FRANK
How's he doing?
WALLS
I haven't had a chance to see him
yet. I'm going to take care of
sleeping beauty.
Frank goes over to Coates as two cops strap on harnesses. CY
hangs impaled on the railing, a steel spike passing through
his hip. Glowing in spotlights from thirteen floors below,
Frank takes Coates' vital signs, gently presses his abdomen:
FRANK
Does that hurt?
COATES
(screams)
No!
Frank, IV bag in his teeth, putting an oxygen mask on Coates:
FRANK
I don't think you've hurt any major
organs.
(sets IV line)
We got to get you off this thing
without setting off bleeding.
Cops behind click on harnesses ("You in?" "Yeah" "You in?")
attach straps to pitons they've hammered into the brick wall,
bring out metal cutters and torches.
FRANK (CONT'D)
They're gonna torch the fence. You're
gonna feel the metal getting warm,
maybe very warm.
COATES
I can't hold up my head anymore.
Frank passes the IV bag to one of the cops, holds Coates,
head. CY relaxes his neck as SPARKS splay like fireworks
beneath him, fall to the concrete.
COATES (CONT'D)
So, Frank, am I going to live?
FRANK
You're going to live.
COATES
I've been thinking about things.
Meditating on my financial future.
You guys gave me plenty of time to
meditate on the future. Whatja do,
stop for Chinese on the way over?
There's plenty of food in my place.
FRANK
I was tired. I needed a coffee.
COATES
What about Kanita?
FRANK
Dead.
COATES
That's too bad. Get some money, a
nice looking girl on your arm, and
everyone wants to take a piece. Some
kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes
is in my house, shooting at me. Damn,
I thought I could make it onto the
balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's
why, falls faster. I'm trying to
watch my weight, and look what
happens. Am I shot, Frank?
FRANK
No.
COATES
Boy can't shoot for shit, either.
Goddamn that's hot.
Frank looks: the spike in Coates' hip starting to glow red.
CY stretches his hand toward the skyline, his face backlit
by raining acetylene sparks:
COATES (CONT'D)
Isn't it beautiful? When the fires
start to fall, then the strongest
rule it all. I love this city.
The torch breaks the spike free: Frank and Coates FREE FALL
three feet, jerk to a stop. Cy yelps. The crowd cheers from
below.
Frank now grabbing, holding Coates tightly--Frank's hands
the only thing keeping Coates from falling--as the cops hoist
them up.
COP
(to Frank)
Good thing we buckled you in, huh?
COATES
What about me? Who's supposed to
buckle me?
COP
(to 2nd cop)
I thought you did.
2ND COP
I thought you did.
COP
(to Coates)
I'm so sorry, sir.
The cops lift Frank and Coates onto the balcony.
CUT TO:
Frank walking out of the restroom wiping water off his face,
looking at the gurney where Coates lies on his side, metal
spike still sticking through his hip, IV line running to his
arm, eyes closed. Nurses walk past Coates: he's stabilized,
waiting his turn. CY, take a number.
Frank spots Hazmat at Burke's cubicle, walks over.
HAZMAT
Nurse Crupp, we're going to need
some Valium here. He's waking up
again.
The ventilator alarm goes off as Burke pulls at his
restraints.
HAZMAT (CONT'D)
(urgent)
Where's that Valium?
Nurse Crupp walks briskly over, injects needle into one of
Burke's IV bags.
Burke's voice speaks in Frank's head:
BURKE'S VOICE
Don't. Don't do it.
HAZMAT
Give me a hand, Frank. I've got to
get something between those teeth.
Frank helps Hazmat force in a bite stick. The monitor alarm
cuts off, the ventilator starts up again, pumping air in,
pulling air out.
HAZMAT (CONT'D)
You can't believe how much he's
improved.
FRANK
How many times have you shocked him
tonight?
HAZMAT
Fourteen. We finally got him a room
upstairs. Should be up there in a
couple of hours.
FRANK
What do you do, just have someone
follow him around with a defribilator?
HAZMAT
(laughs)
That's good, Frank. No, but they
might surgically implant one, about
the size of my thumb. It goes near
the shoulder here, with two electrodes
connected to the heart. It sends a
shock whenever it senses a drop in
blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
FRANK
A medical miracle.
CUT TO:
Frank notices Mary Burke in waiting area with her brother,
mother and several others. Gone is the lost daughter, the
scared junkie. Tonight she's dressed for strength: leather
jacket, blue jeans, black work boots.
MARY
Everyone, this is the medic who
brought my father in. Frank, these
are some of my father's friends.
Frank greets them.
FAMILY FRIEND
We live out an the Island now, but
we used to live right down the block
from Pat. He was like a saint to us.
Came as soon as we heard.
FRANK
(to Mary)
I'm going out for a smoke.
Mary whispers something to her mother, joins him.
CUT TO:
Mini-flashlight leading the way, Frank steps gingerly down
the refuse-strewn alley. Ahead: footsteps.
He kicks something, thinking it's trash, looks down; a body
rustles, pair of sleeping eyes look up.
Suddenly everything seems silent. He passes a row of glowing
red doors. Shadows flash in the distance. He hears a woman
crying, shoots his flashlight her direction: nothing.
Frank hears the voice again: Rose's voice:
ROSE'S VOICE
Why did you kill me, Frank?
FRANK
I didn't mean to.
ROSE'S VOICE
You should have helped me.
FRANK
I tried to help. I wanted to.
Shadows like hands extend against the wall ahead.
ROSE'S VOICE
Don't you love me?
Frank moves toward the reaching arms. The shadows swing like
baseball bats. Noel SCREAMS.
Suddenly, before him, a blurry mass of bloody dreadlocks--
Noel goes flying to the ground, Walls standing over him
swinging the bat, hitting him, killing him.
WALLS
I got him, Frank!
Frank stands back, watching Walls and Noel like some static
black and white TV screen from his childhood. Noel, trying
to protect himself, cries out.
WALLS (CONT'D)
(swinging bat)
To the moon, Alice! You little
motherfucker!
Frank charges forward into Walls, sending Tom, the baseball
bat flying. Walls on the ground. Frank bends over Noel: Noel's
face covered with blood, gasping for air, blowing red bubbles,
convulsing.
FRANK
(to Walls)
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
WALLS
Frank!
FRANK
Do it!
WALLS
(standing)
Frank!
FRANK
(to Noel)
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're
gonna be all right.
(to Walls)
Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking
backup, I swear!
WALLS
You're crazy.
Noel unconscious: Tom hurries down the alley toward the
ambulance as Frank opens Noel's mouth.
FRANK
You're going to make it! You're going
to make it!
Pressing Noel's chest, Frank lowers his mouth, starts CPR.
His mouth to Noel's. In the distance: Walls' footsteps
returning.
CUT TO:
Frank and Tom, their shirts blood-stained, pushing Noel down
Skid Row, past Griss, past Nurse Constance. Tom wheels, Frank
carries the IV bag.
NURSE CONSTANCE
Take him straight through.
GRISS
Who got that funky motherfucker this
time?
FRANK
(to Nurse Constance)
Last show of the night.
HAZMAT
(arriving)
Jesus Christ. Nurse Crupp!
(to Frank)
Anybody else hurt?
FRANK
No.
HAZMAT
Crazy fucker.
Walls pushes Noel into unit one. Frank looks over to unit
three--Burke's cubicle is empty.
FRANK
Where's Burke?
HAZMAT
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice
more.
Frank nods, walks out. Behind, Walls helps Hazmat and Crupp
place Noel on a bed.
CUT TO:
Frank Pierce walks down the hospital corridor, steps into
room 212.
Burke lies, tubed, wired and tied to life support. Blue light
comes through the window. On the EKG monitor: a slow steady
green endless line: up, down.
Frank takes a moment, exhales.
One by one, Frank flips off the machines. The clanging EKG
ALARM is followed by the bass honking of the respirator alarm
and two tweetering IV-drip alarms.
Frank, holding Burke's pulse, watches the life go out of
him. Hearing commotion outside, Frank flips the machines
back on: the EKG monitor is flatline.
A FLOOR NURSE rushes in, feels for Burke's pulse.
FLOOR NURSE
What happened?
(calling out)
Code!
Frank steps back as the Nurse hits the emergency switch.
FLOOR NURSE (CONT'D)
Are we doing CPR?
Dr. Hazmat, out of breath, enters:
FLOOR NURSE (CONT'D)
He coded.
HAZMAT
Christ, what a way to start the day.
He's in V-fib. Shock him.
Frank pulls out the paddles, applies them to Burke's chest:
FLOOR NURSE
Clear!
Frank, knowing it's futile, shocks Burke: no result.
HAZMAT
Zap him again.
Frank goes through the motions, pretending to shock Burke.
The flatline doesn't waver.
HAZMAT (CONT'D)
Nothing. Get the cart, start
compressions, get an epinephrine in.
Frank backs out the door as a nurse and intern enter.
In the corridor Frank listens as the activity becomes less
urgent.
Hazmat steps out:
HAZMAT (CONT'D)
That's enough. I called it. Let's
get some coffee.
(to Frank)
You gonna tell the family?
Frank nods.
CUT TO:
Mary, wearing a burgundy robe, opens the door. Frank says
nothing. Her expression darkens.
Frank looks at her again: it's not Mary, it's Rose. Mary has
Rose's face.
FRANK
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
ROSE/MARY
How can that be? He was getting
better.
FRANK
He coded. They shocked him one too
many times. I'm sorry.
ROSE/MARY
He was tough. You did all you could.
FRANK
I'm sorry.
ROSE/MARY
You have to keep the body going until
the brain and heart recover enough
to go on their own.
Frank nods.
ROSE/MARY (CONT'D)
Would you like to come in?
FRANK
Yes.
Rose/Mary opens the door wider, closes it behind Frank.
CUT TO:
Rose is Mary again: she and Frank lie clothed on her bed. He
leans his head against her breast as she holds him. His eyes
close: sleep.
