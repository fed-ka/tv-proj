      A warm glow from the windows of a beautiful home on a gated 
      two acre lot in the Brentwood section of Nashville. From 
      somewhere in the house, the SOUND OF THE TV turned up loud, 
      the Vandy/Alabama game.



      A CHAUFFEUR opens the door to a black SUV in front of  where 
      two black-suited SECURITY GUARDS and an EVENT GIRL wait. 
      Rayna, late, runs quickly up the steps.

                                  MAYOR (V.O.)
                    In my two terms as Mayor, Lamar 
                    Wyatt has been more than a friend 
                    and a captain of industry-- he has 
                    been a titan of philanthropy. The 
                    countless charitable causes, the 
                    cultural and intellectual 
                      enrichment brought to Nashville 
                    through his benefaction to our 
                    Symphony and to our many great 
                      Universities-- has been monumental.



      The event is over and Tandy walks Rayna to her waiting car.

                                  TANDY
                    Thank you for coming. He won t say 
                    it, but it means a lot to him.

                                  RAYNA
                    You know I didn t come for him. I 
                    came for you.

                                  TANDY
                    Well, then, it means a lot to me. 
                    But still I m sorry I had to ask. I 
                    tried to talk him out of it, but 
                    you know how it is with him. You 
                    win one, you lose ten.

                                  RAYNA
                    Funny thing about Daddy. He s 
                    always there when he needs me. 
                    Don t ask me again for a while, 
                    okay? I ve got enough problems.



                                  RAYNA (O.S.)*
                    I am sick to death of talking about 
                    money.



      The former future of country music sits in traffic.*

                                    MADDIE*
                    Mama, when do you leave?

                    Are you trying to get rid of me?*

                                    DAPHNE*
                    Maddie s gonna be in the talent 
                    show.

                                  RAYNA
                    You are? Maybe I can fly back for 
                    it. Do we know what day of the week 
                    it is?

                                  MADDIE
                    It s a Friday.

      Maddie is already dealing with the disappointment.*

                                  RAYNA
                    Maybe we could move something.

                                  MADDIE
                    You can t. It costs too much money. 
                    You missed it last year, too.

                                  RAYNA
                    But Daddy sent me the video. I 
                    watched it over and over on the 
                    bus. I thought you were great.

      Rayna checks the rear view mirror. Both girls are silent, 
      staring out their respective windows. She turns the radio on.  
      Juliette Barnes  MEAN GIRL is playing. The girls perk up.

                                  MADDIE
                    Turn it up!

      Rayna turns it up and endures as long as she can, four more 
      seconds, then snaps the radio off. The girls wail.

                                  DAPHNE
                    Nooo! Why?

                                  RAYNA
                    Mama s got a headache.

      Rayna looks out the window and something catches her eye.*

                                  RAYNA (CONT D)*
                    There s the first place I ever*
                    played.*

      From Rayna s POV, we see the Bluebird Cafe.*



      Deacon opens the car door and puts his guitar on the back 
      seat. When he turns back around, Juliette is standing there.

                                  DEACON
                    Well! Hello.

      Juliette s posse waits outside her Escalade on the other side 
      of the parking lot.

                                  JULIETTE
                    That last song you did. Has that 
                    ever been recorded?

      She stands close to Deacon, gazing up at him.

                                  DEACON
                    Only by me, so that pretty much 
                    damns it to obscurity.

                                  JULIETTE
                    I want to record it. 

                                  DEACON
                    You do.

                                  JULIETTE
                    I do. This week. Will you come play 
                    on it?

      Deacon is a little unnerved by this show of attention. 

                                  DEACON
                    Well, I could, depending. I m 
                      rehearsing with Rayna all week.

                                  JULIETTE
                    I heard that tour might be off.

                                  DEACON
                    What? No. Not to my knowledge. I 
                    haven t heard anything like that.

                                  JULIETTE
                    Maybe I m wrong then.

      Now she s just smiling at him. He s a little at a loss.

                                  JULIETTE (CONT D)
                    Why don t you come take over for

                    His wife s baby is due two weeks 
                    into the tour. I have to replace 
                    him anyway.

                                  DEACON
                    I can t.

                                  JULIETTE
                    Why not?

                                  DEACON
                    I can t do that to Rayna.

                                  JULIETTE
                    I ll pay double whatever she pays.

                                  DEACON
                    And why would you do that?

                    I want the best. You re the best.

      Deacon is trying to figure her out her angle.

                                  JULIETTE (CONT D)
                    We could write together. 

      Now he s interested, but doesn t let it show.

                    of fun on the road.

      Her white Escalade comes rolling up.

                                  JULIETTE (CONT D)
                    I ll schedule the session around 
                    you. Think about it.

      The car stops.

                                  JULIETTE (CONT D)
                    Rayna s not the only woman in the

                                  JULIETTE

      The back door opens and she climbs in and is gone.

      The early morning sun rises over Nashville.

      In a wide open, overgrown expanse of land, Lamar, Tandy, 
      HENRY, ALBERT and DENNIS stand in the stiff breeze. *

                                  HENRY 
                    One civil servant making twenty 
                    grand a year can deny a permit and 
                    hold up a billion dollar ballpark. 

                                  TANDY
                    It s not gonna get any better when 
                    Coleman Carlisle s the mayor.*

                                  LAMAR
                    Then I ll run my own candidate. I m 
                    done throwing good money after bad.

      Everyone looks at Lamar. Is he serious? He is.

                                  TANDY
                    It s not an idea without merit. If 
                    we found someone business friendly, 
                    who fits nicely in your pocket--

                                    DENNIS*
                    How  bout Michael McDaniel? He s 
                    already on Metro Council and ready 
                    to move up.

                                  LAMAR
                    Teddy Conrad.

      Tandy shoots a look to Lamar. Bad idea.

                                  HENRY
                      Son-in-law Teddy?

                                  TANDY
                    Let s stay within the realm of 
                      possibility.

                                  LAMAR
                    I just put it in the realm of 
                      possibility. Albert, what about it?

                                  ALBERT
                    Well, maybe we say-- it skipped a 
                      generation. Ted, Sr. was a rake, 
                    but Teddy got it together. I mean, 
                    after he blew through his trust 
                    fund.  But his grandfather was 
                    mayor, then congressman. Great 
                      grandfather was a judge and a four-
                    term senator. He s smart, great 
                    people skills and photogenic as 
                    hell.

                                  HENRY
                    How the hell do you know so much 
                    about Teddy Conrad?

                                  ALBERT
                    I was his big brother when he 
                    pledged Kappa Sig.

                                  HENRY
                    You don t think it looks a little 
                    sketchy if he pushes a deal through 
                    for his father-in-law?

                                  ALBERT
                    Lamar Wyatt is nobody s father-in-
                    law. No one s gonna question how he 
                    gets things done. 

                                  TANDY
                    Except Rayna.

                                  ALBERT
                    A beloved star of Country Music for 
                    a wife sure as hell doesn t hurt.

      They all check each other, then Lamar.  Tandy s look to Lamar 
      is unequivocal. It s a bad idea.

                                  LAMAR
                    Run it up the flagpole.

      They head to the waiting cars, Lamar quietly asks Tandy--

                                  LAMAR (CONT D)
                    How bad do you expect Rayna s gonna 
                    try to screw this up for us?

                                  TANDY
                    She s gonna lose it. She s going to 
                      absolutely lose it.



      Rayna has told Deacon everything. Almost.

                                  RAYNA
                    I mean, I feel like I m in my prime. I 
                    don t think I ve ever sounded better. 
                    But the way they say  forty  makes it 
                    sound like I should be in a 
                      wheelchair. If I m such an old hag, 
                    then why would I open for Juliette 
                    Barnes? What is she, fifteen? 

                                  DEACON
                    Nineteen. And don t talk crazy.

                                  RAYNA
                    Am I crazy? Do you understand why I 
                    can t do it? 

                                  DEACON

                    one years. Can you believe that?

      This makes her laugh.

                                  RAYNA
                    No. That s absolutely impossible. 

                                  DEACON
                    You ve been sayin  for a while you 
                    don t want to do as many dates now 
                    that the girls are in school--

                    Yeah, but I want it to be my

      She smiles, but isn t going there.

                                  RAYNA
                    I m just not ready to hang up the 
                      rhinestones. And all the guys and 
                    the crew, they ve planned their 
                    whole year around the tour. I can t 
                    leave everybody hanging. Especially 
                    not you.

      Deacon realizes that he has to tell her, now.

                                  DEACON
                    In that vein, here s something kind 
                    of strange that happened. Juliette 
                    Barnes asked me if I wanted a job.

                                  RAYNA
                    She asked you? As what? 

                                  DEACON
                    Lead guitar. Band leader. Her guy 
                    is leaving in a few weeks.

      Rayna looks like she s been punched in the stomach.

                                  RAYNA
                    Oh. What did you say?

                                  DEACON
                    Nothing. I mean, I m not available 
                    until otherwise notified.

                                  RAYNA
                    Randy s doing her record, she wants 
                    you in her band, what, is she 
                    comin  for my house next?

                                  DEACON
                    She wants to write with me.

                                  RAYNA
                    Wow. She went straight for your 
                    soft spot.

      He acknowledges that it s his weakness.

                                  DEACON
                    I ve always wondered why you never 
                    cut more of my songs.

                                  RAYNA
                    I don t know. Felt weird, like they 
                    were all about me.

                                  DEACON
                    They are. I guess. 

      Rayna nods. He knows this is pure pain for her. She is far 
      away.

                      Sometimes, I wish I could go back 
                    and do the whole thing over again.

                                  DEACON
                    What would you change?

                                  RAYNA
                      Everything. I d do it all 
                      different.

                                  DEACON
                    That makes two of us.

      A moment. They want to kiss each other but don t.

                                  RAYNA
                    I need a drink. Walk with me to Tootsies?

                                  DEACON
                    Ha, can t. Got a meeting.

      Really? Then she gets it.

                                  RAYNA
                    Oh, that kind of a meeting. Ever 
                    miss the wild old days?

                                  DEACON
                    Everyday. Except the headaches. I 
                    don t miss the headaches.

      She smiles.

                                  RAYNA
                    You were the headache. I d never 
                    stand in your way, you know. I want 
                    you to be happy.

                                  DEACON
                    Babe, you know good and well 
                    there s only one thing that could 
                    have made me happy and I lost that 
                    a long time ago.

      Not much to say after that.

      Over helicopter shots of Nashville, we hear the radio.

                                  TAMMY WYNETTE (V.O.)
                          (singing)
                    KEEP GIVING ALL THE LOVE YOU CAN, 
                    STAND BY YOUR MAN.



      A once beautiful face, ravaged by drugs and poverty, with 
      trembling hands, holds the payphone handset for dear life. 
      JULIETTE S METH-TWEAKED MOM (34) begs, lies and cries.

                                  MOM
                    I m not, though. I ve stopped. I 
                    told you that. 

      A greasy, hollow eyed man watches her, full of hope and 
      chemical desperation.



      A gleaming high rise glass monument to the boom years of 
      country music.



      Rayna s car in the huge driveway.



      Rayna sits in her car, high on a hill overlooking Nashville. 
      Storm clouds are piled over the city. Lamar's words continue--

                                  LAMAR (V.O.)
                    But don t be foolish enough to make 
                    that a two way street. My enemies 
                    do not fare well--

      A crack of lightning. Rain begins to pound the windshield.      "NASHVILLE" PILOT-Production Draft, Full BLUE 3/11/12   46.



      The rain continues. A security guard waves Randy Roberts 
      through the gates to Juliette's starter mansion. 



      The door opens. Juliette is surprised to see him. 

                                  RANDY
                    Hey, doll.

      He reaches out to touch her face. 

                                  JULIETTE
                    What are you doin  here?

                                  RANDY
                    What do you mean?

      Randy doesn't know how to react. She s ice cold.

                                  JULIETTE
                    Don't come here without calling.

      She closes the door in his face.
