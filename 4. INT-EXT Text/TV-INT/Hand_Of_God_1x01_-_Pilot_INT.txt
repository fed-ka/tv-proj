The shabby common room of a halfway house. Walls dotted with 
signs about the rules, and posters encouraging non-criminal 
behavior. A half dozen chairs are set up in a semi-circle 
around a folding table. KD (30 s), a tightly muscled, heavily 
tattooed ex-con, sets the table with snacks: a jug of punch 
and packs of stale pastries from the 99-Cents store. 

Only one of the chairs is occupied. TICO, gaunt, meth head, 
sits, twitching. KD checks his watch. He looks out the door, 
down the hallway. Empty. He turns back. Tico has a pastry. He 
takes a huge bite. KD gives him a look.

KD
Those are for after.

Tico puts the half-eaten pastry back. Nods to the clock.

TICO
I thought it started at five.

KD has to accept this is it. He checks his handwritten notes.

Tico realizes KD wants to hold hands. He awkwardly obliges.

KD (CONT D)
Heavenly Father, we ask you to 
bless this bible study. We know we 
are not worthy of your love or 
protections, but yet you give it to 
us unconditionally. We pray that 
you sit amongst us and guide us 
while we study your words. In the 
name of Jesus, we pray. Amen.

He opens his eyes and waits for Tico.

TICO
Oh. Amen.

KD

Tico just sits there.

TICO

KD sighs, turns his bible to the page, hands it to Tico.20.


KD
This is like a checklist from David 
on how good the Lord is. People 
 so say... People might say, what s
good about God? And you can...

MONTGOMERY, a large, scary looking ex-con, enters the room. 
KD brightens for a moment. 

KD (CONT D)
Hey, Montgomery. You here for Bible 
study?

MONTGOMERY
Game time.

He walks right by him, plops down on a couch and turns the TV 
on. Sounds of a basketball game fill the room.

KD
Would you mind turning that off, 
please?

MONTGOMERY
Playoffs, homie.

KD calmly walks over, picks up the remote and turns the TV 
off. His smile is warm, but with a hint of tension...

KD

 He goes back to Tico, but before he can sit down, the TV s
back on. KD walks back over, reaches for the remote. 
Montgomery snatches it away. 

MONTGOMERY

only showed up for the donuts.

You can pray all you want, preacher 
boy, but the game is staying on.

A face-off. Two hardened ex-cons ready to put it in 
overdrive, until... KD backs down. He heads back to Tico.

KD
Tico, can you please start with 
reading verse eight?21.


TICO
(not a great reader)
 The Lord is gracious and merciful, 
slow to anger and abounding in 
steadfast love...

As Tico reads, Montgomery talks to the TV. KD struggles to 
stay focused on Tico.

TICO (CONT D)
The Lord is good to all, and his 
mercy is over all he has made. 

Suddenly, KD spins around, grabs the back of his chair, 
raises it high, and... CRACK! Smashes it across Montgomery s 
head. Montgomery hits the floor. KD whacks him again. Harder.

MONTGOMERY
AHHHHH! What the fuck?!

Dazed, he scrambles to get to his feet. KD drops the chair 
and grabs Montgomery by the throat. He throws him over a 
coffee table, then picks him up again.

He punches him in the face. Montgomery falls. KD kicks him 
flush in the face. Montgomery crumples, unconscious. KD gives 
him two more vicious stomps for good measure.

KD
s time! gonna respect God You re

KD stands there, drenched in sweat. He turns the TV off, and 
now the room is eerily silent except for his heavy breathing.

He turns to see Tico backed up against a wall, one pastry in 
his mouth, another in his hand. KD glares at him, pissed.

Pernell is stunned. Bobo walks out.


Pernell, Bobo and Toby cluster in the hallway. Toby holds a 
case report, a transponder record and a dispatch log.

Pernell holds the papers, reeling.57.


BOBO
Now are we done here?

PERNELL
No!

BOBO
What more do you want, Pernell?


Shane trembles with rage and shock.

SHANE
No fucking way! I want my rep.

Toby nods, takes out his phone. But before he dials, he leans 
close to Shane. Speaks with a gentle, grandfatherly voice.

TOBY

Shane nods, on the verge of tears.

A long beat. Shane looks at his chief with fear and contempt, 
then shakes his head.


Pernell is riveted. Bobo is sick to his stomach. Jocelyn

Shane slowly walks forward, stands in front of the glass. He 
unbuttons his pants, lets them fall around his ankles.

On the other side of the glass, Jocelyn fights back nausea, 
tries to break away. Pernell holds tight.

JOCELYN
Let go of me!

PERNELL
That man raped you. He made PJ 
watch. Look at him! He needs to 
face justice for what he did to you 
and PJ. 

He forces her to face Shane. Jocelyn sobs, closes her eyes

PERNELL (CONT D)
Look at him! Look! I have to know. 
Please, Jocelyn. Help me. Help PJ.

Finally, Jocelyn stops struggling. She knows the only way 
Pernell lets her go, is if she looks. She opens her eyes. Her 
 on the other side. But tears flow freely, matching Shane s
her voice is strong and resilient.

She turns to Pernell with a cold, hard look.

JOCELYN (CONT D)
Does that help?

Finally defeated, Pernell relaxes his grip. Jocelyn pulls 
away, then slaps him. Then spits on him. Then slaps him 
again. And walks out. Bobo puts the eminent domain order on 
the table in front of Pernell. Gives him a pen. 

PERNELL

Pernell signs. Bobo takes the order and walks out.


Toby pats Shane on the shoulder, feeling like shit.

He walks out. Shane stands there, exposed. He looks at his 
reflection, not recognizing himself.

On the other side of the glass, Pernell stares at Shane. 
Confused. Stunned. Defeated.

Pernell chews on that for a moment. He looks up at Paul, a 
resolve setting in.


Pernell and KD ride through the streets of San Vicente.

PERNELL

At night, with the lights just right, and a full house 
singing with all their might, the place feels like a real 
church. Origami doves hang from the ceiling by the tiniest of 
threads. They seem to float above the packed house. 

 in his light   Paul stands on the small stage in front. He s

Shane lies, covered in stab wounds, struggling to breathe. KD 
stands over him.

KD
You can still go to Heaven, Shane. 
Do you want to?

Shane gurgles blood. Feels the sensation leaving his body.

SHANE
Yes.

KD kneels down next to him. Sympathy in his eyes.

KD
Do you accept Jesus as your lord 
and saviour?

SHANE
Okay.

KD
Say I do.

SHANE
I do.

KD

A look of peace comes over Shane, as life begins to leave. KD 
violently shakes him and screams...

Shane tries to answer, but instead, takes his last breath.
