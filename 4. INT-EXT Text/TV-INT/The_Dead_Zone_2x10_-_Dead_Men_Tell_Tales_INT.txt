          as Walt enters.  Johnny looks up.  Walt is frustrated
          with Johnny, and is tough on him here even though he never
          forgets they're friends, maybe even overcompensating for
          that friendship.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Have you talked to the hospital?

                                        WALT
                                (re: the girl who is
                                in the hospital)
                        Is this about the girl?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I only asked if...

                                        WALT
                        Is that why you're blocking a
                        major C-I-D investigation?  Because
                        you've got some soft spot for the
                        girl? 

                                        JOHNNY
                                (beat)
                        I met her once, Walt.  I barely
                        know her.

                                        WALT
                        Yeah except when John Smith barely
                        knows a girl, he knows her past,
                          present, future.  None of it being
                        very pretty in this case.

          Johnny stares at Walt, stonewalls...

                                (low-key)
                        You gonna charge me with something,
                        Walt?  Charge me.  Otherwise, let
                        me go, cause I've got nothing
                        else to say...

                        You're not going anywhere.  You're
                        into this up to your neck, John. 
                        And don't think I won't cut it
                        off if I have to.

          Damn, what the hell is going on here?  Walt threatening
          Johnny?  Johnny doesn't back down an inch either.

                                        WALT
                                (beat, calmer)
                        We're gonna go through it all
                        again.  From the top... starting
                        with the murder.

                                (beat, evenly)
                        I told you -- it wasn't murder,
                        it was self defense.

                                        WALT
                        Yeah.  Yeah.  I have the crime

                        named Mickey Doyle walks into the
                        store with a gun and Cathan
                        Donnegal's wiseguys shoot and
                        kill him.

          Slow push to Johnny as his tired mind tries to wrap itself
          again around the reality of what happened...

                                        JOHNNY

          The slow push continues for another beat before we begin

            dissolve) non-vision transition into it...          DEAD ZONE: DEAD MEN TELL TALES - TEASER - 1/14/03 PINK  4.


          JOHNNY

                                        JOHNNY
                        A man is going to come in here
                        with a gun.

          REVERSE ANGLE to see the reaction of CATHAN DONNEGAL, 40,
          doesn't look terribly out of place in a plumbing fixture
          shop (and a rather tony shop it is too, these are designer
          models)... he's a few years past an athletic build but
          not much, a very Irish face, not handsome but arresting,
          eyes you remember after seeing them once.  He's cordial
          if not friendly.  He's just sold Johnny new bathroom
          fixtures among other items.

                                        JOHNNY (V.O.)
                        It started like they all start.  
                        He was in danger.  I saw it.  I
                        warned him.  It's what I do.

          FAST REVERSE ACTION

          to about twenty seconds earlier...

                                        DONNEGAL
                          I definitely recommend the extended
                          warranty.  Covers everything. 
                        Full replacement, no questions
                        asked.

          He hands the warranty paperwork to Johnny.  As Johnny
          takes the paper to look at the policy -- he HEARS TWO
          POPS... and...


  55DONNEGAL

          suddenly has holes in his chest... and blood running out...
          he falls to the floor dead... and Johnny turns to see a
          small time hood named MICKEY DOYLE, 39, short,
            unattractive, the kind of role Elisha Cook Jr. would play
          in a forties movie... he's holding the gun...


66THE VISION ENDS - RESUME JOHNNY

                                        DONNEGAL
                        Cash or credit?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (urgent)
                        Listen to me.  A man is going to
                        come in here with a gun.

    6CONTINUED:6

          REVERSE ANGLE to see the reaction of Donnegal as before. 
          A long shocked beat then...

                                        DONNEGAL
                        I'm sorry...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He might be a robber, I'm not
                        sure.  About five foot nine,
                          balding, deep set blue eyes,
                          goatee... he'll be wearing a black
                        fedora.

          Donnegal glances at a couple of other workers who move
          slowly over to observe the exchange...  FITZ -- hollow
          cheeks, suspicious eyes -- and MANNY, heavy set - both
          could be installation guys who work with their hands.

                                        DONNEGAL
                                (measured)
                        Who are you?  Why would you be
                        telling me this?

                                        JOHNNY
                        My name is Smith, John Smith.  I
                        have psychic abilities.

          Donnegal eyes Johnny as though for the first time.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        Psychic... abilities...

                                        FITZ
                                  (recognizing him)
                        You're the... 
                                (then to Donnegal)
                        ...I read about him in The Star...  
                        He predicted the whole JLo-Ben
                        Affleck thing. 

                                        DONNEGAL
                                (eyes never leaving
                                  Johnny)
                        Shut up.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know it's hard to believe but...
                        this man, he could very well shoot
                        you... you really need to call
                        the police...

                                        DONNEGAL
                        Yes, I'll be sure to do that.

                        He threw in the extended warranty
                        for free.  Said 'have a nice day'. 
                        And said the new fixtures would
                        be delivered in a week.  And Mr.
                          Donnegal is a man of his word.  



          Johnny working in his Stillson pit... watching a video of
          a Stillson campaign appearance...

                                        REPORTER (V.O.)

                          Penobscot County, Stillson took a
                        moment to call for the defeat
                        Prop 151, the Indian casino
                          initiative.  

          During the above, Johnny's eyes narrow as he sees Sarah

                        to take a hard look at this
                        measure... and listen to Sheriff
                          Bannerman on the subject... I
                        know I do and not only because

                        its midst has also invited crime
                        and moral decay.

                        This measure rolls the dice on
                        the lives of our children, and
                        frankly I don't like the odds, I
                        don't like the stakes, and I don't
                        like Prop. 151.

          During the above, the doorbell rings and Johnny moves
          upstairs without turning off the computer.  We stay on
          the screen to hear the last of Stillson's statement.



          Johnny moves to the security system... looks out to see
          the security cam looking at Fitz and Manny from the fixture
          store in a van with the "Ensuite Bath & Kitchen" logo on
          the side.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes?

                        We have your fixtures for you,
                        Mr. Smith.

          Johnny buzzes them in.



          As Johnny opens the door, Fitz grabs him hard... and Manny
          checks him over for a wire...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hey... what...

                                        FITZ
                        Please excuse the inconvenience.

                        He's clean.

                                        FITZ
                        I need you to come outside with
                        us, Mr, Smith.  You got a jacket?  
                        You'll need a jacket.  It's chilly
                        out.

                                                                          HARD CUT TO:          DEAD ZONE: DEAD MEN TELL TALES - TEASER - 1/13/03 BLUE  8.



          Fitz leads Johnny inside a depressingly spare railroad
          flat: couch, TV set, bookshelf.

                                        FITZ
                        It's not much, but Mickey called
                        it home.

          He looks at Johnny to do something... Johnny reacts, goes

                        Maybe the phone.  Who was the
                        last person he talked to?

          Johnny takes the cue and moves to the phone... as he does -
          RAMP TO HIS FACE...

                        don't feel like goin' out
                        tonight... just gonna watch
                          something on TV... they're doing
                        the Knights of the Round Table on

                        I will.  I promise.  I love you
                        too.

          As he hangs up, we might feel this lonely, single man

          heel shoes, wearing a spring dress that blows in the ocean
          breeze revealing her legs, a scarf around her hair...
          she's wearing sunglasses here and she's not smiling...
          she's almost melancholy... and she's absolutely
            breathtaking.  Although the shots are all wide, Johnny's
          vision takes him into close-ups but they are blurry as
          they might be in a close-up of a cheap photo...  still
          the blur can't disguise that this is an unforgettable
          woman.  The sequence barely lasts fifteen seconds, if
          that long... but adds to the mystery of the woman.

          Johnny's been saying... after a beat, Donnegal moves beside
            Johnny... they continue to walk... without pleasantries,
          Donnegal gets to the point --

                                        DONNEGAL
                        My first thought was you got a
                        tip from your friend the Sheriff
                        that Mickey was coming for me...
                                (off Johnny's look)
                        Guys like me know how to use the
                          internet too...

                                        JOHNNY
                        If that were true, why would I
                        warn you?

                                        DONNEGAL
                        To set me up.  Or gain my trust. 
                        Or both.  It's an old police trick. 
                        Maybe you're just the newest twist. 
                        If you are, I promise you'll regret
                        it, Mr. Smith.

          A beat as he makes sure Johnny gets the message.  

                                        DONNEGAL
                        Now, I don't read minds but I can
                        read faces.  You saw something
                        when you touched Nina, didn't
                        you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        To be honest, I saw her in bed
                        with someone.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        I hope it wasn't me.  That would
                        be uncomfortable.  

          Johnny thinks a beat and then looks Donnegal straight in

          the eye and tells him straight out because more than
          anything else, he wants to know if there's the possibility
          that he's tripped over something that might bring Stillson
          down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She was with Greg Stillson.

          Donnegal's eyes narrow... a beat... and he's not going to
          be forthcoming with Johnny, a man he barely knows, so he
          frames his responses carefully.

                                        DONNEGAL
                          I believe Nina is acquainted with
                        Mr. Stillson.  You believe he
                        might be involved in what happened?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        What if he was?

                                        DONNEGAL
                                (understatement, murder)
                        It would be the end of a promising
                          political career.

          Johnny considers the temptation of the moment.  A lie
          might end Armageddon.  But he's Johnny and he can't do
          it.  He sighs as he realizes that himself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know yet.

          Donnegal studies him, mind working.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        There are certain business matters -
                        ours, for example - that I would
                        never share with Nina.  But I do
                        trust her.  As much as I trust
                        anyone.  But then I trusted Mickey
                        too.  Stillson?  He's a politician. 
                        Last guy on earth you want to
                        trust.  But I don't know why he
                        would want to kill me.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's your relationship with
                        him?

                                        DONNEGAL
                                (suddenly cold)
                        Now when I hear questions like
                        that, I worry about you again. 



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: DEAD MEN TELL TALES - ACT TWO - 1/13/03 BLUE  23.

          Johnny understands - this man is not his friend.  Will
          never be his friend.  He feels Donnegal's eyes on him...
          as though the man is measuring him for a suit.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        You just worry about answers. 
                        I'll ask the questions.  



          Nina's in the back.  Suddenly the door opposite her opens
          and Cathan looks in.

                                        DONNEGAL
                          Johnny's going to go along with
                        you, Nina.  I hope that's okay.

                                        NINA
                        Of course.   

          Johnny gets into the limo.

                                        DONNEGAL
                          I expect to hear from you later,
                        John... don't be a stranger...

          That's a warning even though it isn't spoken as one. 
          Donnegal shuts the door and signals to the driver to take
          off.



          Johnny and Nina.  Nina is a smart lady and knows that
          Cathan Donnegal doesn't put a man in the back seat with
          her for no reason.  So she's curious about him.  Is he a
          player or a worker?  He isn't dressed like a player.  
          Nina is remote but not too far out of reach for a man who
          can afford to reach out for her...

                                        NINA
                        Mind if I smoke?

                                        JOHNNY
                        As a matter of fact...
                                (he would mind)

          Too late for objections - she already has lit the cigarette
          and holds it provocatively between two black gloved
          fingers...

                                        NINA
                        Forgive me.  It's not my fault,
                        it's the cigarette companies. 
                        They knew I'd become addicted.

          She lets a smooth wind of smoke escape between her lips...
          wonders about Johnny.

                                        NINA
                        How'd you know Mickey?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'd just met him.  I didn't know
                        him very well.

                                        NINA
                                (the truth)
                        Neither did I. 

          But of course, that doesn't click with the kiss that Johnny
          saw...

                                        NINA
                        Until somebody told me he was
                        dead, I didn't even know his last
                        name.  He was just... Mickey.  Do
                        you work for Cathan?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually he works for me.

                                        NINA
                                (reacts, huh?)
                        Cathan Donnegal works for you.  

                                        JOHNNY
                          I bought some bathroom fixtures
                        from him... he's doing all the
                          installation work for me.

          She looks at him evenly.  Puts out her cigarette in the
          ashtray as she considers the wealth implied in the next
          line:

                                        NINA
                        A hotel chain?

                        Nope, just an old leaky sink at
                        the house.  Thanks...

          She studies him a beat.

                                        NINA
                        Pour me a drink?

                        Vodka and ice.

          Johnny reaches over to the bar...

                                        NINA
                        I'm curious.  Why did Cathan put
                        you in the car with me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hmm?  Oh, they were just a little
                        short of limo space... I think
                        Mr. Donnegal just picked this car
                        by chance.

          He returns with her drink.  

                                        NINA
                        Cathan Donnegal never does anything
                        by chance.  

          As he hands her the glass of vodka, RAMP TO JOHNNY'S FACE. 
          And we are:



          A cocktail party in progress -- a crowd that seems to
          consist mostly of GORGEOUS GIRLS in tight dresses and
          CAPTAINS OF INDUSTRY enjoying some roguish, slightly
          illicit fun.  A group gathers around a piano player at an
          upright, playing gentle stride jazz.  Nina hangs on
          Cathan's arm, chatting up guests, sipping the last drops
          of champagne from her glass.

                                        JOHNNY/MICKEY
                        Let me get you refill, Nina.

          He didn't even seem to be there before his line.  She
            certainly was unaware of him.  But she smiles and hands
          him her glass.  He moves off toward the bar on his mission. 
          Glances toward...

          THE DOOR

          as Greg Stillson enters the party, followed by SONNY
          ELLIMAN.  The celebrated face brings quick attention from
          the crowd... murmurs of recognition, smiles across the
          room... Greg smiles back, plays the room with his eyes...

                                        STILLSON
                        My kind of party.  More girls
                        than boys.

          A LOVELY GIRL takes Greg's jacket.

                                        STILLSON
                        You're good at that sweet-heart. 
                        You could do that professionally.

                                        GIRL
                        What?

                                        STILLSON
                        Remove my clothes.

          The girl laughs and walks off with Greg's gaze planted
          firmly on her backside.  Greg is like a kid in a candy-
          store, but Elliman quickly takes him in tow to join
          Donnegal and Nina.  Johnny/Mickey watches from the bar as
          a bartender pours two fresh glasses of champagne.


          NEW ANGLE - FINDING JOHNNY/MICKEY 

          picking up two glasses of champagne from the bar, careful
          not to spill them...


          HIS MOVING POV - STILLSON, DONNEGAL, ELLIMAN, NINA

                                        ELLIMAN
                                  (mid-conversation)
                        ...Greg has the confidence of the
                        tribal leaders, we've got the
                        regulatory chair sewn up.  Be in
                          a perfect position to run
                          interference after prop 151 passes.

          But as Johnny approaches, a waiter with glasses of
            champagne passes and Stillson grabs a couple - one for
          him and another for Nina.  Johnny/Mickey stops dead in
          his tracks with his glass, thwarted in his mission and
          turns back.  Nina never even notices him.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        Why don't we talk business later,
                        Mr. Elliman.  It's a party.  Have
                        a good time. 

                                        STILLSON
                        Cathan, you are obviously a man
                        with the right priorities in life.

            Laughter.  But the line was directed as much at the
            incomparable Nina as to Cathan.


          WITH JOHNNY/MICKEY 

          as he awkwardly retraces his steps to the bar, sits alone
          with the champagne.  He chugs a glass of champagne as
          though it were Scotch instead of Crystal.  Then he turns
          his gaze to a strategic piece of mirror behind the bar.


          THE MIRROR -- JOHNNY/MICKEY'S POV

          Reflecting Nina as she lifts her lovely neck in laughter.  


          THE FOURSOME

          Drinking and laughing.  And ever so subtly Johnny/Mickey
          sees Donnegal hand off Nina to Stillson... it comes after
          a look from Donnegal to Nina, just a look is enough for
          her to know what she has to do; and after the briefest
          flicker of humiliation in her eyes, she exchanges Cathan's
          arm for Greg's.  Greg is delighted.  Glances back at
            Donnegal.  Donnegal nods his approval.  Stillson nods his
            appreciation as the gangster moves away from the newly
          joined couple.

          OUR VIEW moves yet again across the mirror to find
            Johnny/Mickey staring vacantly at the image of Mickey in
          the mirror: a self-portrait in disappointment.  A cell
          phone rings breaking the vision.

          as Johnny finishes handing off the drink and grabs his
          phone...

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (answering)
                        Hello.          DEAD ZONE: DEAD MEN TELL TALES - ACT TWO - 1/13/03 BLUE  28.



                                        WALT
                        What the hell are you doing in a
                        limo with a hooker in a funeral
                        procession for a mob guy?  Are
                        you okay?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, hi... yeah, everything's
                          great... maybe I'll see you
                          later...
                                (beat)
                        Mom...

                                        WALT
                        We have to talk.

          He hangs up.

                                        NINA
                        Talking to your mother.  Now you
                        sound like Mickey.  Are you the
                        new Mickey, John Smith?

                                        JOHNNY
                        The new Mickey?

                                        NINA
                        Mickey looked after me now and
                        then for Cathan.  Maybe that's
                        why Cathan put you in the car.   

                                        JOHNNY
                        He didn't mentioned it.

                                        NINA
                        He wouldn't.  Somehow it just
                        happens when Cathan wants it to
                        happen.

          The driver parks the car and gets out...



          Johnny is very uncomfortable with Walt being there... 
          Walt couldn't care less that Johnny feels uncomfortable..
          he needs to know what's going on... he follows him around
          the house as Johnny wants nothing to do with him... this
          is not light banter - there's a genuine conflict at play
          here...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I suppose you're going to promise
                        to protect me... like you protected
                        Mickey Doyle.

                                        WALT
                        I never promised to protect Mickey
                        Doyle.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But you can protect me.

                                        WALT
                        No, but Sarah and I will throw
                        you a helluva funeral.

          Johnny gives him a look.

                                        WALT
                        Let's not forget how Mickey Doyle
                        bought the big casino.

                                        JOHNNY
                        'The big casino'.  You know you're
                        a very different guy out on the
                        street, Walt.

                                        WALT
                        It's a job.  And I need my
                          snitches.  And thanks to you, I
                        lost my best snitch.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Your 'best snitch'.  Mickey   
                        never told you a thing.

                                        WALT
                        He would've before I was done
                        with him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was playing you, Walt.  He
                          would've gone to jail before he
                        gave you anything.

                                        WALT
                        Spilled milk and I'm not crying
                        now that I have you on the inside.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't have me on the inside.  
                          Donnegal knows about us... you
                          shouldn't even be here...

          Walt is tired of moving... he grabs Johnny, not rough and
          tough like he did with Mickey, but we have to recall that
          scene as he presses Johnny...

                                        WALT
                        John, I'm not playing games here. 
                        I need your help and eventually
                        you'll need mine to get out of
                        this thing.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (dry)
                        You can get me into the psychic
                        witness relocation program?

                                        WALT
                        We got a gangland shooting here. 
                        In my county.  I don't like that.
                        At the same time, someone is
                          marrying the mob to the Indians. 
                        I don't like that either.  If you
                        know anything...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Ask your wife about her boss.

                          Stillson?

                        Maybe. 

                                        WALT
                        You're telling me Greg Stillson
                        is involved with Cathan Donnegal.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There's a relationship there.
                        I saw them at a party together.

                                        WALT
                        You saw them or you saw them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mickey saw them.

                                        WALT
                        How am I supposed to use that in
                        a court of law?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're not.   

          Johnny is out the door.  Then returns...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wait a few minutes before you
                        leave, okay?



          Sarah is at a file cabinet pulling out clippings when
          Johnny enters... she reacts...

                                        SARAH
                          I assume you're not here to
                        volunteer.

                          Stillson around?

          She nods toward Stillson's office door... moves back into
          her small cubicle... as they move into it...

                                        SARAH
                        He's in with Sonny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Oh, on a first name basis, now.

                        Yes, and I call Mr. Stillson,
                        'Greg' too. 
                                (beat, frustrated
                                with him)
                        What is it you have against him?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        I just wish you weren't here
                        helping him get elected.

                                        SARAH
                                  (ironically)
                        No one's helped him more than you
                        have... getting Harrison Fisher
                        to withdraw from the race.

          Johnny knows that irony... and wonders why fate plays
          with him the way it does.  Sighs to himself --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, well, I'm still trying to
                        make up for that.

                                        SARAH
                        Greg thinks you've seen things
                        about his past... he's made
                          mistakes, he admits that...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm more worried about the mistakes
                        he hasn't made yet.

                                        SARAH
                                (reacts)
                        You've seen something in the
                        future.

          Johnny looks at her... all but confirming it...

                                        SARAH (CONT'D)
                        And you don't want to tell me
                        about it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah.  No.  I'm hoping it will
                        just... go away... so I don't
                        have to tell you or anyone else.

          She studies him... can't begin to guess the extraordinary
          nature of the vision that Johnny has had.  She takes his
          visions seriously but she's thinking about much smaller
          kinds of mistakes.

                        Greg in the hands of someone like
                        Sonny Elliman.  I feel like I'm

                        You're assuming he has one.

                        He could be a good congressman

                        At least, we agree on one thing.

          Johnny has to stop and consider the possibility that even
          Sarah has a role to play in the ultimate destiny that
          Johnny has foreseen.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe you're right, Sarah.  Maybe
                        you shouldn't quit.  Maybe you're
                        not supposed to quit.

                        Quit?  Not while I have any say
                        in the matter.

          Greg comes in... behind him is Sonny Elliman, who has a
          bruise on his cheek from a fight...

                                        STILLSON
                        Sarah's my conscience.  Every
                          candidate needs a conscience.
                        Isn't that right, Sonny?

          Sonny doesn't smile.

                                        STILLSON
                        Sonny doesn't do the conscience
                        thing.  But that's my secret.

                                        STILLSON (CONT'D)
                        To win, you need both a Sonny
                        Elliman and a Sarah Bannerman on
                        your side.  I'd be lost without
                        her.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I believe you.

          Stillson looks at Johnny, choosing to keep his distance.

                                        STILLSON
                        Excuse me for not shaking your
                        hand in a proper greeting, John,
                        I've been eating barbecue chicken
                        sent over from the Ladies Who
                        Lunch League.  Sticky fingers. 
                        What brings you over this way?

          Johnny decides to throw it out there for a reaction...

                                        JOHNNY
                        It turns out we have mutual friend.
                        Mickey Doyle?

                                        STILLSON
                        Sorry, John, your famous second
                        sight failed you this time --
                        never heard of the fellow.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No?  Used to work for Cathan
                          Donnegal.

          Stillson's easy grin never wavers but maybe there's a
          look in his eye and a glance toward Sonny.  He sees he
          needs to move this out of here, looks to Sarah.

                                        STILLSON
                        It's hard when old friends find
                        themselves on opposite sides of
                        the fence.  You've known John
                        longer than you've known me.  But
                        we're adults, right?  Reasonable
                        people can agree to disagree.

                                        SARAH
                        I'm not quitting.

                                        STILLSON
                        Good.  

          But then he adds with a grin, first pointing to John --

          Smiles then motions for Johnny to follow...

                        Come on, John.   Try some of that
                        sticky chicken in my office.



          as they enter and Elliman shuts the door.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Greg)
                        Does your 'conscience' know  
                        where you stand on the Indian
                        casino proposition?

                                        ELLIMAN
                        He's against it.

          But Stillson is wiser, knows Johnny knows what he knows,
          and isn't afraid of it.

                                        STILLSON
                        Now, Sonny, we can run but we
                        can't hide from Johnny Smith, we
                        all know that.  That's what I
                        love about you, John.  I'm always
                        on my toes when you're around.

          And he's all politician as he explains in the most natural
          of tones --

                                        STILLSON
                        This is politics.  Plain and
                        simple.  Publicly, I'd never say
                        it but privately, I happen to
                        think the casino initiative would
                        be an economic boon to this region
                        and I don't mind quietly promoting
                        it.

                          Donnegal is an established local
                          community leader and businessman
                        who supports my campaign and I
                        welcome his support. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mr. Donnegal asked me to find out
                        who sent a low level hood named
                        Mickey Doyle to kill him.  Maybe
                        someone involved with the casino
                          initiative.

          He looks to Stillson for a reaction... Stillson volleys
          well...

                                        STILLSON
                        I don't generally try to kill
                        people who help finance my
                          campaign, John.  

          Johnny studies him evenly.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mr. Donnegal apparently isn't so
                        sure of that.

          For the first time, Stillson's even demeanor drops for a
          beat, and fear flickers across his eyes.  Elliman is far
          less under control... he moves threateningly toward
            Johnny...

          Donnegal hesitates a moment, then pulls the keys out of a
          drawer.

            Johnny/Mickey glances at the rear-view mirror.  The mirror

                          I haven't been asked that since I
                        was ten.  What's next?  My favorite
                        color?

                        Didn't mean to pry.

          Nina smiles indulgently.  And she's barely engaged in
          this conversation - at least at the beginning - talking
          to Mickey for her is like having the easy listening station
          on in the car... she lights a cigarette...

                        Nah, a baby only really begins to
                        see the world when he's three
                        months old.  That's when he smiles
                        for the first time.  By then it
                        was winter.

          Nina laughs at Mickey's logic.

                        Snow still makes me smile.  It's
                        funny stuff.

                          Stockbridge, Massachusetts.  We
                        were driving to the Menenaki Indian
                          Reservation and one of the biggest
                        casinos in the Northeast.

          The vision ends cutting back to --



          He turns the key in the ignition and begins to drive...



          The Cadillac passes and as we follow, reveal the same
          sign we saw earlier:

          "Exit 29 -- Stockbridge, Hollow Horn Resort."

          Like he did in "What It Seems", he is following the

          Johnny considers his options.  Before him lies the whole

          as maybe a dozen shots are fired...

          -- WIDER TO SEE FITZ AND MANNY FIRING AND JOHNNY/MICKEY
          DYING A GANGSTER'S DEATH 

          -- JOHNNY

          moves aggresively to Donnegal and grabs him with one hand,
          hard by the arm, turning him... as he does, we hear a
          slight DZ sound effect...

                                        DONNEGAL
                        The hell you think you're... 

          Clicks and reveal Fitz and Manny holding guns on Johnny...

          But Johnny's face shows that he's seen something on
          contact... and he's already relaxed his grip... it was
          barely a matter of seconds before he regained control.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (realizing)
                        You didn't do it.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        Since I don't know what it is,
                          probably not.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Somebody tried to kill Nina.

                                        DONNEGAL
                                (beat)
                        She runs with some heavy hitters. 
                        Is she okay?

                                        JOHNNY
                        She was on her way to the hospital
                        when I left her.

          Donnegal looks at his men, motions for them to put away
          their weapons.

                                        DONNEGAL
                                (to Fitz)
                        Who would do this?

                                        FITZ
                        Same somebody who sent Mickey to
                        kill you, maybe?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

                                        DONNEGAL
                                (studies him)
                        But you know, don't you?  You
                        know who got to Mickey.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mickey did this on his own.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        Mickey never did anything on his
                        own.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was in love with her.

                                        DONNEGAL
                                (beat, incredulous)
                        He could have had her.  All he
                        had to do was ask.  Why'd he think
                        he had to kill me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's one of those questions I
                        can't answer if you don't already
                        know.

          Donnegal puzzles over this but doesn't tax himself.  He
          stares a beat at Johnny and determines that he is telling
          the truth.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        That's it.  You're sure.

          Johnny nods.  Donnegal thinks about it, shakes his head
          at man's folly... glances at his colleagues... sighs --

                                        DONNEGAL
                        Poor dumb Mickey.

          Shrugs, okay that's over.  Reaches into a drawer and starts
          counting out cash.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        You did good, John.  Ten thousand
                        dollars for your time.  Enough?  

                                        JOHNNY
                        What I do isn't for sale and I
                        want to keep it that way.

                        I have a problem with that.  If I
                        don't pay for something, it's not
                        mine, and I gotta own your work
                        here, John.  

                                        JOHNNY
                        Give me the girl.

                                        DONNEGAL
                        Nina?  For services rendered?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Free and clear.  No further
                          obligations to you.  Put out the
                        word that nothing else is ever to
                        happen to her again.

                                        DONNEGAL
                                (laughs)
                          Everybody wants Nina.  
                                (beat)
                        Why not?  She's yours.  Hell, I
                        can find another Nina for less
                        than ten thousand bucks.  Just
                        out of curiosity, what are you
                        going to do with her?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Bring her to St. Paul, Minnesota.

          Off Donnegal's reaction...



          Walt knows in his gut that Johnny's not telling him
          everything.  Pacing, growing anger with Johnny...

                                        WALT
                        And you're telling me you didn't
                        make any deals with Donnegal not
                        to talk.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (lying)
                        That's right.  

                                        WALT
                        You're afraid of him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not afraid of him.

          In his face, furious.

                                        WALT
                                (angry)
                        Well, maybe you should be -  he's
                          a dangerous guy, John.  Not the
                        kind of a guy you want to make
                        your friend.  Cause his friends
                        wind up dead or barely alive lying
                        in the hospital.  And you're giving
                        me squat. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I told you what I know... 

                                        WALT
                                (overlapping)
                        You swear on J-J's life you're
                        not lying.

          Johnny studies him a long beat.  Then he gets up, finished
          with this...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Go to hell, Walt. 

          And walks out... in effect challenging Walt to stop him.



          Nina lies on her back, unconscious, hooked up to a glucose
          drip.  In sleep, her expression is serene and peaceful,
          and she is most beautiful.  Johnny sits beside her,
          watching over her.

          He takes her hand in his and squeezes gently.  Nina stirs,
            a fractional smile appears on her face and her eyes crack
          open.

                                        NINA
                        Mickey?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm here, Nina.

                                                                              FADE OUT:
