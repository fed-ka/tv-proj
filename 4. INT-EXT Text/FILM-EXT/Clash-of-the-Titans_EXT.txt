Gloomy, last light. From out of the shadows comes
--
A DOG. A dog of war. Big, mangy, muscular, scary. As
he moves down the alley, the way becomes increasingly
choked with fallen structures. and signs of tumult.
TRACKING WITH THE DOG as he comes onto a battlefield.
The hellish scene is REVEALED TO US SLOWLY --
SERIES OF SHOTS
as the Dog traverses a landscape of --
BODIES, frozen in contorted death poses. This was
furious, hand-to-hand fighting between human SOLDIERS and
nightmare CREATURES, their corpses now in piles to the
horizon.
The Dog climbs a mound of casualties. At the top, the
Dog looks back across the battlefield. The Dog's eyes
are sad, his expression weary and disgusted.
DISSOLVE TO:
The entrance is patrolled by a dozen PALACE GUARDS. They
don't see the Dog pad silently to a fissure in the palace
wall and disappear inside.
HARDENED COUNTENANCE - DAY
staring at --
ANOTHER ANGLE
Queen Danae, PREGNANT NOW, and weeping. Her arms are
bound.
A ROYAL ENTOURAGE is gathered. The women weep, the men
agonize.
Palace Guards lift the Queen into a chest and chain it
closed. On the King's signal, the Guards carry the chest
to the edge and drop it into the rough sea. We HEAR a
SCREAM from within.
Some members of the Royal Entourage look with scorn at
their King, outraged by this double murder. Acrisius
registers their disapproving looks and angrily turns to
leave the promontory.
WE SEE in his face what the others do not -- shame and
doubt.
IN THE WATER BELOW, the chest rights itself and rides out
on the tide.
Two HORSEMEN gallop in the moonlight. The first Rider
sways in the saddle and falls from his mount. He
staggers to his feet, a skin of ale in his hands. It is
King Acrisius, very drunk.
The second Rider, the King's STEWARD, dismounts to give
aid, though he's also drunk.

CONTINUED:
KING ACRISIUS
(RAGING)
My own subjects condemn me! They
dare judge me? And what emboldens
this treachery?...
STEWARD
You are mistaken, my King. None
would risk your anger --
KING ACRISIUS
(oblivious to him)
It is Zeus who warps my
kinadom!... Zeus the ungodly, Zeus
the defiler...
This talk sobers the Steward instantly; he looks about
fearlessly.
STEWARD
Please, speak not these things
--
Acrisius spins on him, out of control --
KING ACRISIUS
He cuckolds me in my castle, rapes
my precious Queen! This is a low,
conniving God... But I have bested
him on this day and humbled the
great Prime.
(SWIGS ALE)
Tell me, Panos, who rivals Zeus on
Olympos? Who does the Fearless
One fear?
STEWARD
I beg you, Your Highness --
Acrisius pulls a dagger and holds it to the Steward's
throat.
KING ACRISIUS
Tell me what the Priests say!
STEWARD
(terrified, halting)
Tiamat... Tiamat, Queen of the
Deep.
(WHISPERING)
Those who dare, whisper she covets
Zeus' throne and schemes to
achieve it, the ambitious Goddess
of the Dark Oceans...
(CONTINUED)
5.
CONTINUED:
KING ACRISIUS
Yes, Tiamat! And today I have
honored her.
The King whirls and staggers up the crest of the dune.
KING ACRISIUS
I've taken Zeus' whore and the
bastard she grows in her belly and
thrown them to Tiamat in her rough
sea!
(toward the moonlit
OCEAN)
I honor Zeus' rival with all that
was dear to me --
(falters, ashamed)
-- and commit double murder in her
honor...
About to go to pieces, rage seizes him again --
KING ACRISIUS
so that Zeus will know I
despise and disdain him and spit
on his foul name!
The Steward shrinks from this blasphemy, eyes darting in
fear.
ON THE CREST the King is silhouetted in the moonlight,
arms raised defiantly toward the heavens, when suddenly --
-- his figure is seized by some violent force, shaking
his being. A HORRIBLE SOUND
(MUSCLE TEARS, BONES CRACK)
and THE KING'S BODY GROWS LARGER AS IT DISTORTS IN
MISSHAPEN DISFIGUREMENT.
And thus, KING ACRISIUS BECOMES... KALIBOS!
The Steward SEES what we now cannot. An INHUMAN ROAR and
the shadow of this new being falls upon the Steward. He
SCREAMS, but it's too late -- the huge CREATURE grabs him
by the neck and LIFTS HIM OUT OF FRAME. From the empty,
moonlit dunes, we...
DISSOLVE TO:
Queen Danae's coffin/chest tossing in the rough water.
Through the ROAR of the waves, we HEAR a BABY CRY.
FADE TO BLACK.
6.
SUPERIMPOSE: TWENTY-FIVE YEARS LATER
FADE IN:
A LITTLE BOY leads a blind OLD MAN along a road.
Abruptly, the Old Man halts. Puzzled, the Boy scans
ahead, SEES --
-- a SPRAY OF DUST, moving fast, behind a blurred BLACK
FORM --
-- in an instant, the apparition blows past them -- wind
and dust whip at them. In awe and fear --
OLD MAN
Thoth the Quick...
(sensing the boy's
CONFUSION)
Messenger of the Gods. Bound for
Olympos.
The rushing Black Form crosses a field, leaving a
violent wave in the long grass and suddenly --
WE ARE IN THAT RUSHING POV: the landscape is just a
blur. But up ahead is a mountain: OLYMPOS. WE ZOOM UP
TO the summit --
-- INTO the clouds above the peak. THROUGH the mist --
villas, classical facades: THE ABODE OF THE GODS. The
polished stone of the grandest villa reflects THOTH'S
dark form touching down.
(MARKETPLACE) OF JOPPA - DAY
The long war with the Gods has wounded this city, but
life goes stubbornly on. Among the war-torn buildings is
a bustling market. CITIZENS eye the wares. MERCHANTS,
PERFORMERS, noise, and MUSIC.
SUPERIMPOSE: JOPPA, CAPITAL OF THE DOMINION OF ILLYRIA
Suddenly the market falls SILENT. Fear grips the crowd.
An occurrence rare in the world of Men -- AN OLYMPIAN
APPROACHES.
The clouds stop dead. The crowd stops. TIME STOPS. A
PRESENCE WE DO NOT SEE moves to the BASILICA, the royal
residence and assembly hall.
The market, now quiet, tries to return to normalcy. But
the crowd watches the Basilica, worried by the God's
presence.
- DAY
Perfectly blue, sunlight shafting from the surface.
A GREAT WHITE SHARK appears, ensnared in a fisherman's
net. Panicked, the shark is diving as fast as it can.
As the net passes we see --
ANTEROS, a hapless young fisherman, his legs entangled in
the net, desperately trying to hold his breath. When
they have disappeared, we see a FIGURE appear through the
blue in pursuit. As he passes, we get our first look
AT --
PERSEUS,
25, wiry, bronzed from the sun, a stubbled jaw,
a knife in his teeth. He swims with the power and grace
of a porpoise -- beyond the ability of any normal man.
The shark thrashes about, jaws snapping close to Anteros.
(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED:
Perseus swims INTO VIEW and uses his knife to cut the net
near the shark's snout. The shark tries to swim through
the hole, but instead drags the net upwards. Perseus
hangs on.
One more slice and the shark zooms out of the net,
bumping the young hero as it swims away. Perseus pulls
Anteros toward the surface.
A CREW of FISHERMEN wait desperately at the rail.
SPYROS, the oldest and toughest, watches in agony.
Perseus breaks the surface, gasping, his lifeless friend
in his arms. Five crewmen dive in to help, but Perseus
is mad with despair. They have to pull him away.
Spyros watches sadly. But also, relieved to see the one
survivor.
Spyros makes his way to the bow, where Perseus sits
alone, downcast, in pain. Spyros watches in silence.
Then, gruffly --
SPYROS
Your grieving does Anteros no
good. It comforts only you.
PERSEUS
It's my fault he's gone.
SPYROS
He was careless with the net.
Perseus gives him a hard look.
PERSEUS
So it's his fault. Not mine, not
fate, not the Gods?
SPYROS
(DISDAINFULLY)
The Gods delude themselves about
their power and watch in envy
while we act. We make our own
history.
(CONTINUED)
15.
CONTINUED:
PERSEUS
(breaks down, crying)
Now my history is I let my friend
die in my arms. I made it back,
why couldn't he?
SPYROS
What you do, no other man can do.
Have you not noticed?
PERSEUS
To what purpose? I failed him.
SPYROS
(SCOFFS)
Purpose! Looking for purpose is
what ensnares men in the
superstition of the Gods, as
surely as your friend was caught
in that net. And all the
searching leads down to the same
place.
The trawler is approaching its home island, Seriphos.
Perseus looks off at the rocky coast. Collects himself,
QUIETLY --
PERSEUS
You always say that my abilities
are greater than other men's. But
they were not enough to save him.
SPYROS
You are still a man, confined by
man's limits. You are just as
likely to fail as succeed.
PERSEUS
How is that greater than other
men?
SPYROS
Ordinary men fail most of the
time.
The trawler rounds a point on the island.
Perseus spies a beautiful girl on the cliff. A closer
LOOK --
A huntress; a pagan leather bandeau hugs her lithe
figure. Flowers in her golden hair -- wilted dahlias.
Young yet ancient. THE WILTING GIRL.
(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED:
She watches Perseus intently as the boat passes. He
turns to see if Spyros or his friends have seen her, but
no one has. When he looks back, she's gone.
Perseus sits looking sadly at the sea that killed his
friend. TEKLA,
14, Perseus' adoptive sister, runs up
from the modest stone dwelling. She sees his mood and
touches his arm gently.
TEKLA
Mother wants you to come in for
supper.
(as he is
UNRESPONSIVE)
Perseus, why are you so sad?
This breaks his spell. He looks at Tekla warmly, gets up
and puts a reassuring arm around her shoulders as they
head inside.
(OPEN SEA)
- DAY
A white sail, swollen with wind, draws the small boat
swiftly across the sea. The Wilting Girl, alone, sits
quietly at the stern, effortlessly steering.
CLOSER
We SEE that she is also watching Perseus, who is sleeping
in a makeshift bed in the bottom of the boat. Her eyes
slowly travel over his bronzed, muscled frame. There are
bite marks on his legs and arms, but they seem to be
healing as we look at them.
Perseus stirs and wakes, squinting up at the Wilting
Girl.
PERSEUS
How long have I been out?
(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED:
WILTING GIRL
This time? Only a few hours. The
time before, almost a day. How
was your rest?
PERSEUS
I had a dream. I fell into a dark
pit. I thought I would never stop
falling. But a beam of light
formed a soft net, caught me and
tossed me back.
TheWilting Girl watches him.
PERSEUS
When I came back up to the world,
a beautiful woman appeared and
spoke to me. But as she spoke she
would sometimes disappear into the
whiteness with a strange sound.
PERSEUS' POV
The Wilting Girl listens to his story.
BACK TO SCENE
PERSEUS
When I could hear her, she spoke
nonsense. She said that my father
was a God and my mother a --
At that moment the blinding-white sail swings between
them as she tacks, obscuring his view of her for a
moment. The wind makes a LOUD SNAPPING SOUND in the
cloth. Then she reappears, the sail on her other side.
PERSEUS' FACE
as he realizes she is his vision.
WILTING GIRL
You are special, Perseus. Your
birth was ordained for this very
purpose.
PERSEUS
I am an ordinary man.
WILTING GIRL
Do you ever lie awake during a
storm and listen to the thunder?
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
21.
CONTINUED:
WILTING GIRL
(CONT'D)
And it sounds as though it matches
the beating of your heart?
He doesn't have to answer; it's written on his face.
WILTING GIRL
How long can you hold your breath?
Longer than the others? Are there
times when you know you should
feel pain, but you don't?
PERSEUS
None of that means anything.
WILTING GIRL
Look at your arms, Perseus.
Perseus watches the bites on his arm heal visibly.
PERSEUS
A good trick. You must be the
demigod, not me.
WILTING GIRL
("NO")
I'm a Chthonian.
PERSEUS
A Chthonian?
WILTING GIRL
An Earth Goddess.
(OFF PERSEUS'
CONFUSION)
The Gods have a caste system just
as men do. The Olympians are our
nobility -- few but cosmic. The
Chthonians are the peasants. Our
abode is this earth, and we exist
as long as men worship us.
PERSEUS
And when none worship you?
Sadness flickers through her extraordinary eyes.
WILTING GIRL
(SOFTLY)
We fade away.
This touches Perseus deeply. His tone changes.
PERSEUS
And demigods, where do they stand
in your hierarchy?
(CONTINUED)
22.
CONTINUED:
WILTING GIRL
Nowhere. Sorry.
PERSEUS
If demigods rank so low, why do
you need me?
WILTING GIRL
For a marriage.
PERSEUS
What!
WILTING GIRL
Zeus, God of Gods, has proposed a
treaty to end the war. At the
center is the marriage of a mortal
with a demigod.
PERSEUS
Who, me?
WILTING GIRL
Zeus himself has chosen you. A
demigod may be less than a God,
but he's more than a Man. One
foot in Humanity, the other in
Divinity. Your marriage will be a
symbol of accord between our
races.
PERSEUS
Forget it.
WILTING GIRL
Such a union could save millions
of souls.
Perseus is struck by that. He looks off across the sea.
PERSEUS
And just who exactly am I supposed
to marry?
A NIMBLE GIRL hurries past SERVANTS hanging laundry in
the atrium.
She's PESHET, handmaid to Princessa Andromeda. She has a
feline quality -- eyes, grace, agility. She raps on the
scullery door.
PESHET
Princess... Princess!
ANDROMEDA (O.S.)
(muffled from inside)
The Princess is not here.
(A SQUEAL)
Find another... Princess.
PESHET
The Queen approaches!
ANDROMEDA (O.S.)
I don't care!
PESHET
Andromeda! You'll care enough if
you're caught! Remember last
time...
From inside we HEAR complaining, more kissing and
moaning.
CASSIOPEIA
(O.S.)
Peshet!
Startled, Peshet spins to see the Queen approach.
(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:
CASSIOPEIA
Where is the Princess?
Peshet faces the Queen.
PESHET
Is she not in her chambers, ma'am?
CASSIOPEIA
She is not. You are expected to
know her --
A SQUEAL and WHISPERING from the closet stops Cassiopeia.
She throws a perturbed glance at the door. Peshet looks
guilty.
CASSIOPEIA
(LOUDLY)
Tell the Princess -- should you
find her -- her father and I want
to see her at once.
She stalks away. Urgently, through the door --
PESHET
Princess, it's the King as well!
(COAST OF JOPPA)
- DAY
Perseus can't take his eyes off the Wilting Girl, who
steers. She tries not to be self-conscious; she would
blush were she not so pale.
WILTING GIRL
You're looking in the wrong
direction.
PERSEUS
I don't think so.
WILTING GIRL
Perhaps you should give some
thought to your immediate future.
PERSEUS
(laughs, flirtatious)
That's what I'm doing.
WILTING GIRL
Maybe you should take another
look...
She indicates the view behind him. Perseus turns, jaw
dropping.
HIS POV
A breathtaking view of Joppa -- a city in two parts.
At sea level, tangled hovels, boats, and docks crowd the
working-class area -- the LOWER WHARF.
Above, twisting stone stairs climb the cliffs to the
ACROPOLIS with its gleaming villas, temples, statues, and
colonnaded towers, hugging the precipice.
(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
The Wilting Girl leads Perseus through the city. He's
never seen anything like it. He rubbernecks, awestruck
as he passes a BLACKSMITH who takes a dragon skin from
the coals and fashions armor by pounding the white-hot
scales over a mold.
WILTING GIRL
All the goods, armies, and culture
of Man's dominion flow through
this port. He who reigns in
Joppa, rules the world.
Amidst the exotic chaos, Perseus is struck by
the
homeless refugees on the street and the ruins
of once-
proud buildings.
PERSEUS
The war has badly scarred this
place.
WILTING GIRL
It is the war you have the power
to end.
He throws her an angry look, grim.
PERSEUS
Don't joke about such things. I'd
be useless before such a huge
responsibility.
WILTING GIRL
Perhaps you would be...
(TO HERSELF)
... as you are now.
They pass an evangelist
(FANTASOS) haranguing a crowd.
FANTASOS
(MID-SPEECH)
-- one true God is not Zeus but
she called the Deep -- Tiamat!
(quoting from his
GOSPEL)
'Before the first dawn, the eyes
of the Deep watched the earth.'
(to the crowd)
Bow down to the Goddess of Chaos
or know despair, for Tiamat will
rule the heavens and the earth.
Perseus is mystified by this talk. He turns to Vidalia
for explanation, but she seems disturbed by the preacher
L
and does not return Perseus' gaze.
(CONTINUED)
27.
CONTINUED:
Perseus and Vidalia round a corner and see the regal
Basilica. WORKMEN hang banners and decorations,
preparing for a big event.
PERSEUS
What are they celebrating?
WILTING GIRL
You.
The Wilting Girl slips into the dusk like a thief.
The Wilting Girl steals down the dark, narrow alley,
headed toward the outskirts of town.
Suddenly, a heavy wall shoots up from the cobblestones,
blocking her way. She startles, but does not stop. She
goes up to the wall, turns at an angle and slides right
through the stone, like a ghost.
On the other side, she emerges from the stone, breathing
hard. She looks around and hurries down an intersecting
passageway.
She's gone only a few steps, when just ahead of her,
thick vines shoot out and form a dense barrier. She
takes a breath and dives into the surging growth.
She almost makes it through, but at the last moment,
vines wrap her arms and legs, holding her prisoner. She
gives up, with a sigh. We HEAR the LAUGHTER of a God.
WILTING GIRL
Zeus?
Zeus' rumbling voice is held low, talking to her in an
intimate way -- a beautiful sound.
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
ZEUS
(V.O.)
Why do we have to play these
games, my lovely girl? You know
you cannot leave.
The vines retract, freeing her. She rubs where they
gripped her.
WILTING GIRL
My part is finished.
ZEUS
(V.0.)
It has just begun. Have you
forgotten your place in this?
WILTING GIRL
As I've lost my believers, the
future has become dimmer to me.
ZEUS
(V.O.)
I still believe in you. Close
your eyes and see your tomorrow.
She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. A single
tear runs along her cheek. She opens her eyes.
WILTING GIRL
It's too painful. I can't involve
myself.
ZEUS
(V.O.)
You you already involved. Such is
fate. We cannot hide from the
.trials of our future... no matter
how dark the alleyway.
She looks back at the Basilica with profound sadness.
Perseus roams, taking in the city with interest. Rich
and poor mix in the crowded streets. As always, the poor
have suffered the most from the conflict.
Perseus follows the MUSIC and the sound of LAUGHTER to a
crowded terrace overlooking the sea. Upper class YOUNG
PEOPLE are partying en masse.
Perseus moves through the revelry, looking at every girl,
testing his instincts. Suddenly, he stops in his tracks,
looking off --
(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED:
Andromeda is dancing at the center of attention, her
sheer gown enhancing her sensuality. The MUSIC ends.
Andromeda laughs and tosses her curly mane.
A HANDSOME YOUNG NOBLEMAN embraces her. She gives him a
deep kiss, causing a sensation, then breaks away into the
crush.
Andromeda glides to the balustrade to watch the sunset.
The Young Nobleman approaches, but her imperious gesture
stops him cold.
PERSEUS
(O.S.)
Very beautiful.
Andromeda spins, petulant.
ANDROMEDA
Will you please give me some
PEACE --
The sight of the handsome stranger gives her pause.
ANDROMEDA
What did you say?
PERSEUS
I said, 'Very beautiful.'
ANDROMEDA
Do you think just anyone can make
intimate judgements on the royal
family?
PERSEUS
I meant the sunset.
She regards Perseus over her glistening bare shoulder.
ANDROMEDA
Do you always start a seduction
with an insult?
Perseus moves to the rail, very close to her, and looks
at the sea.
PERSEUS
I know nothing of seduction. I'm
a simple fisherman. My home is
across that water.
(CONTINUED)
34.
CONTINUED:
ANDROMEDA
What brings you here?
PERSEUS
To Joppa? I was kidnapped.
ANDROMEDA
I mean here, tonight.
He looks over at her a long moment.
PERSEUS
I've come to see my future wife.
Startled, Andromeda suddenly realizes who he is. A mad
mix of emotions crosses her face.
Perseus and Andromeda walk in moonlit gardens. She stays
close, attracted to him.
ANDROMEDA
It's not personal. You're not a
bad-looking boy.
(as Perseus laughs)
I'm too young. I don't want to be
married.
PERSEUS
Me either.
ANDROMEDA
Then why are you doing it?
PERSEUS
No one asked me. And now that
I've met you, I don't know if I
can go through with it.
(off her look)
It's not personal. Seeing you
makes it real. I think a man
should make his own decisions. I
won't be the pawn of a King or a
God.
She looks at him with new interest.
ANDROMEDA
Since we agree, it's settled. No
marriage.
(CONTINUED)
35.
CONTINUED:
PERSEUS
I don't think it's going to be
that simple.
Ignoring that, she takes his arm, moving even closer.
ANDROMEDA
That doesn't mean we can't be
friends. Get to know each other.
I want to show you something.
She leads him into a tall, hedged garden maze.
Beautiful in the moonlight. She hurries him quickly
around one turn, then another, and another. He laughs at
her excitement.
PERSEUS
I'm already lost.
ANDROMEDA
I'll take care of you.
They take two more jogs and find themselves in an odd
sylvan chamber. Soft plants have been stacked in what
could be mistaken for a bed.
ANDROMEDA
This is my special place. No one
can see or hear or even find us
now.
PERSEUS
(looks around the
CHAMBER)
I don't suppose I could escape
without your aid.
ANDROMEDA
Do you want to?
When he turns back to her, she melts into his arms and
gives him a long deep kiss. He's surprised, but handles
it well. When she tries to continue, he slows things
down, holding her at bay.
ANDROMEDA
Do you not find me attractive?
PERSEUS
One of the most beautiful women
I've ever seen.
(CONTINUED)
36.
CONTINUED:
ANDROMEDA
Of course, you haven't been much
in the world.
PERSEUS
True. Maybe a lot of girls look
like you.
ANDROMEDA
Don't you want to make love to
your almost-wife? Maybe we'll
find we're not compatible.
PERSEUS
What if we find we're very compat--
She stops him with another kiss. He starts to surrender
to his desire, but again, he stops. Her voice is a low
PURR --
ANDROMEDA
Is it true you're a demigod?
PERSEUS
(makes a face)
It seems what everyone wants to
believe.
Her face is inches from his. She looks into his eyes.
SEXY --
ANDROMEDA
I don't see it.
(as Perseus laughs)
But let's find out for sure...
She kisses him yet again, pulling him toward the bed of
foliage. He can no longer resist. Together they fall
into the softness. He kisses her passionately as their
bodies begin to move together. She breaks the kiss for
only a moment, her voice husky --
ANDROMEDA
I think I'm becoming a believer...
They start to make love.
SPEEDING OVER moonlit ocean TOWARD a dark castle on a
cliff. WE begin to HEAR the VOICES of Tiamat and Set.
(CONTINUED)
37.
CONTINUED:
SET
(V.0.)
Tiamat, I know this place, but I
know not why.
The chamber, deserted for 25 years, is in decay, dead
vermin everywhere.
TIAMAT (V.0.)
In this chamber Zeus defiled the
Queen Danae and begat the anointed
demigod, who would facilitate this
foul truce.
Perseus wakes on the bed of foliage, looks around.
Andromeda is gone. He thinks, smiles. Then he remembers
his situation. The smile fades.
An immense school of fish is SUDDENLY SPOOKED. An EERIE
GLOW swells in the gloom -- Tiamat glides TOWARD us,
stops and raises her palm. The silt SWIRLS and RIPPLES.
A VAST PRIMORDIAL SHAPE SLOWLY RISES in clouds of ocean
mud. It's impossible to see what this creature looks
like, but it is big. We hear a deafening ROAR, which
drives a SHOCKWAVE across the silt.
The sea bulges and a TSUNAMI rolls toward the shores of
Joppa.
Dark docks and shanties under the cliffs, populace
asleep.
A lone FISHERMAN unloads nets from his boat. Suddenly,
the water under his boat is sucked out to sea. A deep
RUMBLE shakes the ground.
The fisherman is mesmerized as the horizon CLIMBS higher
and higher, a WALL OF WATER. In seconds, the colossal
wave breaks and falls, obliterating the boat, the docks
and the low-lying shanties.
MUSIC SWELLS as we see THE FULL EXPEDITION on horseback,
on the main road north. As they come over a rise, Amoun
IDENTIFIES THEM:
First, two fearsome Mongols, MONGKE and TAMBURLANE.
(CONTINUED)
48.
CONTINUED:
AMOUN (V.0.)
Our guides will be Mongke and
Tamburlane, father and son monster
hunters from the Kingdom of the
Iron Horde.
Next, THE PRAETORIAN GUARD, commanded by a square-jawed
old soldier, DRACO. His men, in heavy armor: KOSMO,
Draco's lieutenant, and the soldiers ABAS, ICOS, THAD,
BOREAS, KRIKOR, and POLLUC.
AMOUN (V.0.)
Our escort will be a detachment of
the Praetorian Guard, led by
Commander Draco -- the staunchest
security force in Joppa.
Next, on a stunning pale horse, a pale rider -- the
Wilting Girl.
PERSEUS
(V.0.)
Why do we bring the Earth Goddess
into this danger?
AMOUN (V.0.)
I thank the stars we have her.
Besides, she takes her orders from
an authority much greater than I.
Next, Spyros; horseback riding is not one of his many
skills. Behind him, Perseus and Amoun ride talking --
PERSEUS
Amoun, it seems an odd coincidence
you came into my life as tutor, so
long ago, and now, once again you
instruct me.
AMOUN
(LAUGHS)
No matter what you believe,
Porpoise, some things are fated.
I've been looking forward to this
journey for a long, long time.
He spurs his horse, riding ahead. Spyros drops back
beside Perseus.
SPYROS
Who would have thought we'd be on
a journey like this? Two simple
fishermen.
(CONTINUED)
49.
CONTINUED:
PERSEUS
I'm afraid I've dragged you into
real danger, Father, when I have
little idea of what I'm doing.
SPYROS
Living at the mercy of the sea so
long has convinced me some
adventures are unexpected and some
dangers unavoidable. It's all in
your attitude.
PERSEUS
What's our attitude about
destroying Leviathan?
SPYROS
The Kraken is just another big
fish.
Perseus smiles, but is not as sanguine.
(OCEAN)
- PROW - NIGHT
Tiamat's Palace-Galleon is bigger than anything man can
construct. Tiamat is at the prow of the vessel, using
all her godly power to STIR THE ELEMENTS. With great
effort, she sends a hurricane down on Joppa.
Set the Void approaches the prow.
TIAMAT
The demigod and his retinue are
joined. They march for the
counsel of the Norn Sisters, to
seek the frailty of my Leviathan.
SET
(CONCERNED)
The Sisters...
TIAMAT
Yes. I beseech you, track the
expedition.
SET
To plainly thwart them would
betray our intentions and draw the
wrath of Zeus and the others.
(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:
TIAMAT
That, we cannot have. I merely
suggest that the road to Skolothia
is hazardous.
SET
I take your meaning. And your
loyal brute, he is fixed upon the
hunt?
TIAMAT
Fear not, he is about and he will
do his share of damage.
Set leaves. Tiamat resumes stirring the storm clouds.
The sound of that same DISTANT THUNDER as the Expedition
follows the road. To the south behind them, LIGHTNING
FLASHES over faraway Joppa.
SUPERIMPOSE: THE VIA DAHLIA, NORTH OF JOPPA...
28
DAYS REMAINING
Perseus and the Wilting Girl ride side by side. Perseus
looks back at the distant storm.
PERSEUS
Joppa is pummelled by the Dark
Goddess.
WILTING GIRL
(WITHOUT LOOKING)
It will not stop. Tiamat knows no
mercy.
The moonlight illuminates a crumbling, limestone arch on
which time-worn letters read: "VIA DAHLIA."
PERSEUS
By what name may mortals call you?
WILTING GIRL
I have no name.
PERSEUS
Who do your worshippers pray to?
WILTING GIRL
I can't remember.
PERSEUS
Perhaps that is why they are
falling in number?
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
The Wilting Girl flinches, and Perseus feels guilty about
his jest.
PERSEUS
I have to call you something...
(THINKING)
Since we're naming you on this
road, what about 'Via Dahlia'?
She gives him a sharp look. Is he mocking her? He's
defensive.
PERSEUS
That's a pretty name. Wait,
better yet -- 'Vidalia'? How's
that... 'Vidalia'? That's more
than pretty, beautiful really,
just as you are.
She is pleased, self-conscious, concentrating on the road
ahead.
PERSEUS
You don't like it?
(as she murmurs)
What's that? I missed it --
WILTING GIRL
(just loud enough to
HEAR)
I do not object.
She picks up the pace, moving her horse a little ahead.
He smiles.
They've camped for the night in a clearing. A fire
burns, food cooks.
Mongke and Tamburlane emerge from the woods with armfuls
of timber and kindling. Draco glances up from striking
his flintstone. Gruffly --
DRACO
More.
The Mongols stare -- either not comprehending or ready to
fight.
DRACO
It must last all night. Get some
more.
(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:
PERSEUS
(SUDDENLY BETWEEN
THEM)
I'll find some more.
ABAS
Commander, I'll get some, too.
Perseus and Abas head off into the woods in different
directions.
Perseus hacks branches and picks up deadwood. He slashes
at a tree -- TING! Under the vines is a stone column.
He climbs mossy steps.
The ruins of a public bath, its marble pool fed by a
stream.
Perseus sees Vidalia on the far side, her back turned.
Perseus freezes as she drops her garment. He peers
through the vines.
HIS POV
The leaves offer tantalizing cover to her naked body.
She dives in with a quiet SPLASH.
BACK TO SCENE
PERSEUS
Now is when an honorable man would
turn around and walk away...
(DOESN'T MOVE)
. but they say I am not really a
man.
Vidalia surfaces and drifts on her back, looking sadly
into the sky.
Perseus fixates on the sadness in her eyes. His
expression changes, and the tenor of this stolen vigil is
altered.
RAINDROPS fall as the SKY OPENS and a CLOUDBURST pelts
the pool. Vidalia opens her lips to taste the rain and
smiles. LIGHTNING.
(CONTINUED)
54.
CONTINUED:
Perseus' HEART POUNDS in his ears as he watches. KRA-
KOOM! The ROLLING THUNDER hits exactly on his
heartbeat -- BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!
Vidalia instantly knows he is nearby. She looks around
quickly and huddles in the water.
Perseus retreats. After a few yards, he stops, face
flushed with the awareness of a whole new dilemma.
PERSEUS
Vidalia...
Abas uses his sword to HACK at dried wood. He bends to
pick up a branch when he HEARS the CRACK of wood. He
whirls, sword at ready. But there is nothing there.
Embarrassed, he picks up the firewood. Now he HEARS
something unidentifiable -- is that BREATHING? Spooked,
he turns to head back to camp --
A DARK FIGURE is standing behind him, larger than a man,
grotesquely misshapen. Abas raises his sword, but a
twisted PAW swats it away with a ROAR. Abas tries to
raise the sword again and realizes his arm is gone. He
looks up in horror as the Creature envelops him --
-- KALIBOS!
Only a few streaks of sunlight penetrate the canopy of
tall cedars.
SUPERIMPOSE: THE CEDAR FOREST OF THE ILLYRIAN BORDER...
24 DAYS REMAINING
Here slumbers an enormous hybrid creature with human
features and a leathery, scaled hide -- HUMBABA.
Suddenly, Set the Void appears. The evil God strokes the
sleeping monster's head, then reaches inside Humbaba's
skull. The animal goes stiff; its leg twitches.
SET
Hear me, my pet. Let my
instructions be seared to your
primal mind as natural law.
L
The monster's eyes shoot open; its pupils shrink to
pinpoints.
(CONTINUED)
55.
CONTINUED:
SET
You are starving. Your gut says
you'll soon perish. No earthly
meat will still that hunger. What
you need, what you ache for, is
the flesh of... a demigod!
Nearby, the Expedition (minus Abas) rests. Not here:
Perseus, Draco, Icos, and Boreas.
A herd of winged horses, PEGASSI, graze.
Draco, Boreas, Icos and Perseus
-- thrilled -- hide in a
thicket.
DRACO
Pegassi, stallions of the Gods.
ICOS
Perseus. How long do you think
you could stay on one of those?
Icos and Boreas exchange a sly look.
BOREAS
Don't goad the boy, Icos. No Man
can ride a Pegasus.
ICOS
Did not Bellerophon tame the Great
White Pegasus?
BOREAS
You're right. But he was a
demigod...
PERSEUS
(EAGER)
Then this will be a good way to
find out just what I am.
DRACO
Stop it, rogues. One of our own
has disappeared without a trace
and all you can think is to cause
mischief. What if Perseus is
bucked to his death from a
thousand feet up?
(CONTINUED)
56.
CONTINUED:
BOREAS
Don't worry, Commander, the boy
won't even get on its back.
With a "watch this" grin, Perseus rises. Draco pulls him
back down.
DRACO
Don't do this. If we go back to
camp right now, we can avoid
trouble and keep our goal in
sight. A true leader will not be
distracted.
PERSEUS
I'm not the leader, Draco, Amoun
is. I'm too young to start
avoiding trouble.
Perseus jumps up and approaches a roan Pegasus, speaking
soothingly. It WHINNIES and threshes its wings,
buffeting Perseus with gusts.
The Pegasus rears up, and leaps over Perseus' head. It
lands behind him, bucks its hind legs, and kicks Perseus
face-first into the dirt.
Icos and Boreas are laughing, but when Draco gives them a
dark look, Boreas jumps up, sobered, and heads into the
clearing.
BOREAS
I'll collect him right now,
Commander.
Suddenly, Humbaba erupts from the thicket with a HOWL.
The Pegassi take flight, but the Humbaba grabs one and
swallows it whole. Humbaba turns and SNIFFS the air,
homing in on Perseus.
DRACO
Perseus, get out of there! Icos,
fetch the others.
Icos bolts. Draco and Boreas leap into the clearing with
swords drawn to draw the monster's attention. Perseus
does the same.
DRACO
I told you to run, boy. You'll
make things worse.
57.
Hearing the ROARS, the Expedition is already up. Icos
arrives.
ICOS
A Humbaba!
Mongke and Tamburlane fly into the woods; the others
follow.
The reinforcements arrive to see Humbaba pin Boreas with
its talons.
DRACO
Boreas!
Draco hacks at the monster's leg, to no avail. it rips
off Boreas' head and swallows his body.
Perseus CRIES OUT and leaps at the creature, sword
swinging.
AMOUN
No, Perseus!
VIDALIA
Get back!
Vidalia spins her shepherd's sling to pitch lead sling-
bullets. Spyros leaps between Perseus and the monster
and thrusts his weapon -- a VICIOUS-LOOKING HARPOON/BOAT
HOOK.
Tamburlane hoists an ancient BAZOOKA. Mongke lights the
fuse and backs away. KA-BOOM! The weapon belches fire
and metal.
The Humbaba staggers from the shot, but lunges and
swallows Mongke whole. Spyros sinks his harpoon in one
leg, but has it ripped from his hands.
VIDALIA
A delusion is planted in its mind.
It thinks it's starving and it
wants to feed on --
(SUDDENLY
UNDERSTANDING)
-- YOU!
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
The Humbaba's eyes bulge with surprise as a saber pierces
its nose. From inside, Mongke pries open the beast's
mouth with his saber.
VIDALIA
I can't reverse the powerful
curse. But if the monster's
hungry, I can feed it.
Vidalia raises her arms and shuts her eyes. A cyclone of
CAWING RAVENS descends from the sky and dives straight
into the monster's mouth. As the Humbaba tries to shake
them away, Mongke is thrown clear.
VIDALIA
(TO DRACO)
Now! The belly! Slash the belly!
Draco moves to do that when Perseus leaps forward, lunges
and sweeps his blade up Humbaba's belly at the same
moment Draco sweeps down. The two blades barely miss
each other, opening a huge X in the belly. The others
are shocked and impressed by Perseus. Steaming purple
entrails spill over Perseus and Draco. HUMBABA CRASHES
TO THE GROUND.
The flock of ravens, liberated from Humbaba's gut, shake
the viscera from their feathers and take flight.
Perseus, somber, washes the creature's guts from his arms
and legs. He turns to find Vidalia standing above him,
furious.
L-
VIDALIA
I should cast a spell upon you and
leave you forever a stone upon
this stream.
PERSEUS
I didn't beckon the Humbaba.
VIDALIA
You did, with your childish
recklessness, and Boreas has paid
the price!
Perseus, already rife with guilt, is stung by the truth.
VIDALIA
Your safety is entrusted to me by
the mightiest power on Olympos.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
59.

VIDALIA (CONT'D)
But without a thought, you risk
life and limb, your own and your
fellows'.
PERSEUS
The monster killed my friend. I
could not contain my rage. But
you, Goddess, are aloof from the
emotions of Men.
Vidalia's eyes narrow, enraged.
VIDALIA
Yes, a tyrannical Goddess, who
dares question your mad rush to
annihilation.
(QUIETLY INTENSE)
The hopes of multitudes reside
with you. You're late in learning
you cannot act upon every impulse.
She whirls and walks away. Perseus is left with the
weight of his culpability... and the beginning of
knowledge.
Amoun smokes his pipe by the dying campfire. Perseus
approaches.
PERSEUS
Master Amoun... You knew about me,
didn't you? When you came to our
village?
AMOUN
Your birth was written in the
stars. I sought you out and took
it as my cause to teach you.
PERSEUS
You chose a poor student. I have
learned little and my mistakes
cost dearly.
AMOUN
Understanding that is the first
step toward knowledge.
(CONTINUED)

PERSEUS
R
It won't do Boreas any good.
AMOUN
You can honor Boreas by the way
you act from this moment forward.
PERSEUS
I'm no demigod, Tutor. I'm not
even much of a human.
AMOUN
It is not your choice. You are
what you are. Amor fati, Perseus.
'Love thy fate.'
PERSEUS
I do not believe my fate is to be
half a God. No demigod could feel
as confused as I do tonight.
AMOUN
Concentrate on the task before
you. All answers will come with
that.
PERSEUS
Tell me of the Cleon Desert
Legion.
AMOUN
A fierce group. Trained to
fight...
Amoun's DESCRIPTION CONTINUES as we --
CUT TO:
SUPERIMPOSE: CLEON DESERT LEGION BIVOUAC, THE DISPUTED
TERRITORIES
The desert camp of the Legion is lit by torches. The
LEGION SOLDIERS are handsome, powerful career warriors,
going about their evening business -- eating, cleaning
weapons, washing.
AMOUN (V.0.)
. behind enemy lines.
A LOOKOUT peers into the dark desert, listening. Now he
HEARS something, turns and shouts to another SENTRY:
(CONTINUED)
62.
CONTINUED:
LOOKOUT
The Night Patrol returns on the
Gorge Road!
That message is shouted along from Sentries to Guards in
the camp.
OUT IN THE DARKNESS on the dusty Gorge Road, a dozen
Soldiers gallop in GROUND-SHAKING FORMATION toward the
firelit encampment.
AMOUN
(V.0.)
. They've been chasing Djinn
Raiders in the mountains for
years.
PERSEUS
(V.0.)
Djinn Raiders?
AMOUN (V.0.)
Yes, Godly zealots, supposedly
insane. They fight like Hades
himself is keeping score...
From the dark SURROUNDING DESERT, WE SEE the Night Patrol
ride into camp and dismount.
AMOUN
(V.0.)
.. That's how the Desert Legion
came to be called 'God-slayers.'
I'm not ashamed to say I'll be
relieved to have their protection
the rest of the way...
Amoun's Voice FADES. TILT DOWN TO the barren, desert
flats. Suddenly, a miracle transforms the moonlit
SCRUB --
Strange, beautiful MAGENTA FLOWERS sprout magically where
there had been only dirt and cacti. The LOTUS BLOSSOMS
surround the camp.
The Cleon camp is just twinkling lights from here on the
mountain. Startlingly, a huge DEFORMED PAW/CLAW/HOOF
scrapes onto a boulder. Pulling himself INTO VIEW in
repulsive CLOSEUP -- Kalibos. (There, within his
frightening visage, is the distinctive crooked scar we
noticed on the jaw of Acrisius in his human form.)
When his twisted body has gained purchase, he looks up
the mountain. AN EERIE LIGHT illuminates his awestruck
countenance. Above him --
(CONTINUED)
63.
CONTINUED:
-- Tiamat, ensconced in a natural throne of rock.
Turning a Lotus blossom in her hand, she smiles on
Kalibos, like a benevolent mother.
TIAMAT
My loyal friend. it is beneath
you to stalk this band of infidels
one by one. Events demand more
decisive action.
Kalibos' SPEECH is as tortured and deformed as his body --
KALIBOS
Grorashnrd... I to be... ruler...
rhodirs... made whole...
sovfrenty... kingdom mine...
TIAMAT
Yes, Kalibos, the time is nigh
when I restore you to your
rightful form -- proud Acrisius.
With me, your protector, on the
throne of Olympos... the violator
Zeus deposed.
Kalibos reacts, with what must be satisfaction.
TIAMAT
Go down into this valley. See
what I am building for you -- an
army dangerous and fearless as
you, their leader.
Several Soldiers have been drawn from camp by the
IRRESISTIBLE FRAGRANCE of the Lotus flowers. They pluck
petals and chew them.
The rest of the Legion filters out between the tents to
take their fill of the drug.
Kalibos watches the handsome, powerful warriors from
across the field of Lotus blossoms.
Peshet sprints through the RAIN, dodging the REFUGEES and
CITIZENS like a cat, peering under each hood, searching
for her mistress.
On the plaza, a rabid throng of Refugees. Fantasos, the
Revolutionary leader, exhorts the mob, surrounded by
BODYGUARDS, including Agenor. As before, Fantasos seems
to have actual hypnotic powers.
FANTASOS
How much are we meant to suffer?
Where is your mighty King? Safely
cloistered above the flood... on
the high ground, with the high-
born -- the privileged gentry!...
The angry crowd responds, fists shaking. Peshet moves
through the throng, desperately looking for Andromeda.
She passes close to the rostrum and Fantasos registers
her presence.
FANTASOS
. Does Kepheus worry about you?
No! Only the Princessa... And
still, the Kraken comes! Does the
King build his defenses at the
water's edge?
"NO!" cries the crowd. Peshet is shocked to find herself
replying with them -- "NO1" Fantasos motions for Agenor
to continue the harangue, while Fantasos hurries off the
stage.
AGENOR
No! He makes his stand at his
daughter's chamber door!... We
will show Kepheus we're not
sacrificial fodder. We will
tremble the walls of his Basilica!
RABID SUPPORT from the mob. Peshet stops suddenly,
peering ahead.
HER POV
at the fringe of the crowd, Andromeda herself watches
from the anonymity of a hooded cloak, terrified.

AGENOR (O.S.)
Andromeda is the one Tiamat wants!
We die so she may live...
As the crowd EXPLODES, Andromeda hurries away in tears.
Peshet fights through the crush to follow her.
Peshet rounds a corner, frustrated. Andromeda is gone.
A hand grabs Peshet's shoulder, startling her. It is
Fantasos.
FANTASOS
Peshet, you've come at the right
time.
Fantasos engages her with hypnotic power. Peshet nods,
trance-like.
FANTASOS
One night soon, a gong will sound
three times. When you hear it,
unlock the back gate of the
Basilica. Then go to Andromeda's
chambers...
(hands her a dagger)
. and bring the Princess out.
My men will take her to Leviathan.
Peshet just stares at the dagger, hands trembling.
FANTASOS
Do you understand me?
(harshly, off her non-
RESPONSE)
Peshet, do you understand how
important your part is?
She nods, horrified by her predicament.

SUPERIMPOSE: THE SIROQUE MOUNTAINS, THE DISPUTED
TERRITORIES...
19 DAYS REMAINING
The Expedition moves through a mountain pass. Perseus
eyes a cliff. Amoun and Draco stop. Glimpses of CLOAKED
FIGURES in the boulders.
AMOUN
You wanted to know about Djinn
Raiders. Here they are.

weapon ready.

Spyros comes out.

SPYROS
Draco, tell me what this --
Everyone is standing perfectly still.
DARK FIGURES surround them. The transformed Cleon Legion
lurches INTO VIEW. The only resemblance to the soldiers
they were is their armor.. Now they're monstrous
creatures: LOTOPHAGI.
CLOSE ON A DEFORMED FOOT
as it plants in the dust. The companion foot lands
beside it -- completely different. TILT UP TO: Kalibos.
Perseus stands by Vidalia, watching the monsters.
Kalibos immediately focuses on the demigod. He sniffs
the air around Perseus.
VIDALIA
(WHISPERING)
Lotophagi. Lotus-eaters. We
should leave... now.
PERSEUS
I won't do anything rash. I've
learned my lesson.
VIDALIA
This time you must do something
rash. We all must.
Kalibos leans close to Perseus.
KALIBOS
Tosharicana... demigod...
expulsotat... Zeusl
PERSEUS
No... Perseus.
PERSEUS WHIPS OUT HIS SWORD. The whole Expedition comes
to life as
--
THE LOTOPHAGI ATTACK, swift and brutal. Long arms thrash
and rip at the Praetorians.
Mongke and Tamburlane BLAST the swarm with HANDGONNES.
Spyros lobotomizes one with his harpoon. Amoun opens a
leather sack of sand.
AMOUN
Muster to me!
(CONTINUED)
68.
CONTINUED:
Thad, Krikor and Perseus are the first there. Amoun
tosses an arc of the black sand around them all. The
ring of sand transforms into a dense, swirling swarm of
insects. Amoun shouts to the others, still fighting.
AMOUN
Come on! You can pass through!
Draco bolts for the barrier. A Lotophagi spears Kosmo,
killing him. Draco slides inside the swarm. He looks
back at Kosmo in horror.
Polluc slashes zombies and runs toward the swarm. He's
almost there when one of the Lotophagi lands on him,
sinking fangs into his skull. Polluc sticks his sword
into the creature; they both fall over dead. Icos and
Spyros fight their way to the swarm and jump inside.
Mongke and Tamburlane kill a Lotus-eater and leap over
the corpse into the protected circle.
The tide of HOWLING and SHRIEKING Lotophagi claw at the
barrier of insects to no avail.
AMOUN
Only humans can penetrate the
shield!
Perseus takes quick stock of the group inside the swarm,
thinking.
PERSEUS
Only humans...
He looks over the Lotophagi and sees Vidalia out there,
alone, flinging sling-bullets as she fights her way
toward the barrier.
PERSEUS
Drop the barrier!
r
AMOUN
No! It's too late for her!
PERSEUS
Drop it, Amoun!
At that moment, Kalibos grabs Vidalia and drags her to
the top of an outcrop. At the top, he turns, LOOKS
DIRECTLY AT PERSEUS and HOWLS, his message clear: "If
you want to save her, come and get her." He hungrily
rips her leather bandeau. Perseus turns to Amoun.
(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED:
PERSEUS
Take the barrier down or I'll go
through it!
AMOUN
Have you learned nothing? If you
break out now, we're all at risk.
On the boulder, Kalibos grabs Vidalia's white flesh.
Perseus is anguished; he knows he's in love.
PERSEUS
I've learned one thing for
certain!
Perseus shouts at Thad, the massive Praetorian.
PERSEUS
Get down!
Perseus backs away three steps. To the others
--
PERSEUS
Get ready to defend yourselves!
Perseus runs, plants a foot on Thad's back and leaps out
through the swarm, which immediately dissipates around
the humans. They have only a moment to react as the
stunned Lotophagi come to their senses.
DRACO
Let's kill these freks!
Perseus runs over the backs of the Lotophagi. Hurtling
off them, he scrambles up and knocks Kalibos off Vidalia.
Ralibos rolls, flips onto his feet and gives Perseus a
look: "You're the one that I want."
They face off, looking for an opening. Perseus lunges,
thrusting his sword. Kalibos dodges, springing up the
rocks and then down toward Perseus, acrobatic as an ape.
Perseus rolls out of the way.
Perseus sweeps his sword at Kalibos' head. The monster
catches the blade in his jaws and SNAPS IT IN TWO!
Bloody spittle flies from his tongue.
Kalibos pounces, pins Perseus. He opens his jaw and
sinks his teeth into Perseus' shoulder. Vidalia cracks a
rock into Kalibos' head. The creature whirls on Vidalia
and careens toward her, head bloody.
Perseus leaps in the air and catches Kalibos in the back
with both feet, knocking him over the edge.
(CONTINUED)
70.
CONTINUED:
Kalibos slams down on the jagged boulders and ricochets
off, pinwheeling through the air. The grotesque figure
hits the lower rocks head-first and his neck CRUNCHES.
He slams into the dust, dead.
Perseus lands on his back, weak from the bite. When he
tries to rise, his legs are rubbery. Vidalia catches him
as he falls forward and lowers him gently, looking at the
bloody puncture wounds.
VIDALIA
(SOOTHING)
Okay... sshh... I've got you.
A THUNDEROUS SOUND SURGES in the distance. Vidalia scans
the horizon.
DOWN BELOW
Draco, Spyros, Amoun and the others hack away, fending
off the Lotophagi. Outnumbered, they won't last long.
The earth VIBRATES. The Lotophagi are distracted,
looking around nervously.
Over a rise stampede SCORPIOCHS, rhino-sized scorpions.
Riding them, DJINN RAIDERS, flowing black silk masking
all but their blue eyes.
They lay into the Lotophagi. The Scorpiochs skewer the
beasts with HUGE PINCERS. The Djinn use flashing
SCIMITARS to cut them down.
ATOP THE ROCKS
in Vidalia's arms, the fading Perseus watches as the
Djinn turn and surround the Expedition members, closing
in.
PERSEUS
Vidalia... we need to help them...
He blacks out. Vidalia cranes to look over the edge of
the cliff where Kalibos fell. She is mystified by what
SHE SEES:
The deformed monster Kalibos is gone. In his place, neck
broken, lies a handsome, aging noble, finally at peace --
King Acrisius.
71.
A STRING OF LIGHTS, each a lantern hanging from a
Scorpioch's tail. The Expedition members ride on the
Scorpioch with the Djinn. Some of the huge scorpions
carry small box/rooms (palanquins) on their backs.
Surviving Lotophagi chew on the bones of the fallen. One
reaches hungrily for an Alkali Lotus in the sand, but
suddenly the petals blacken and curl. The creature,
spooked, sniffs the air.
All at once, the Lotophagi age years in seconds and keel
over, dead. The cause: Set the Void glides over,
surveying the battlefield.
The Expedition rides through a war-ravaged village of
stucco and thatch. DOORS and SHUTTERS CREAK shut as they
pass, UNSEEN INHABITANTS skitter about.
SUPERIMPOSE: FRONTIER OF SKOLOTHIA... 15
DAYS REMAINING
DRACO
The Skolothians have suffered more
than their share in this war. The
Legions of the Gods have battered
them.
SPYROS
It's no wonder they shy away from
all strangers.
Perseus looks ahead, where the Expedition is parting
company with the Djinn Raiders. only one of the Djinn is
staying -- SHAIKH SULEIMAN, a veiled priest.
PERSEUS

PERSEUS
I thought they didn't speak.
AMOUN
They have no mouths. That doesn't
mean they do not speak.
DISSOLVE TO:
The Expedition climbs through rugged country. At a turn,
Amoun looks up. Dead ahead, wreathed in fog -- sheer
granite pinnacles, one towering above the others.
AMOUN
The Pillar of Moirai. Lair of the
Norn Sisters.
PERSEUS
Tell me of them.
AMOUN
They're witches in the form of
Strix. Not a pleasant sight, a
Strix. They have powerful magic
and dreadful habits. Baby-eaters,
among other things.
(off Perseus' shock)
But they owe me a favor. When the
war broke out, they lent their
power to men against the Gods in
exchange for infant sacrifice.
Tiamat struck them blind for their
treachery. When they came for
help, I fashioned them an
artificial eye, for their Second
Sight.
PERSEUS
You made only one eye?

grotesque.

- NIGHT
The Expedition sleeps in a drizzle.
WHISPERS. Shaikh Suleiman moves toward Perseus. The
WHISPERING comes from behind his veil. He pulls a
GLEAMING BRONZE SICKLE from his cloak. The priest, blade
poised, stands over the sleeping Perseus.
OUT OF THE DARKNESS runs Spyros, his harpoon raised for a
strike.
SPYROS
Stay away from my boy!
Without touching him, the Shaikh throws the fisherman
over his head, where he lands hard with an "UMPH!"
Perseus jolts awake. He reaches for his sword, but has
none. Spyros struggles to his feet to start another
charge.
Suleiman raises his hand and freezes Spyros in his
position. The Shaikh's veil has fallen, revealing his
frightening countenance: scaled skin of charred wood;
eyes like slots in a furnace. Perseus listens to the
WHISPERING.
PERSEUS
Spyros, he means me no harm.
The Shaikh lowers his hand: Spyros falls into the dirt.
The Shaikh pulls his veil over his face. He kneels
before Perseus, head bowed.
PERSEUS
I hear you and I understand you.
But I don't know how.
SHAIKH SULEIMAN
Moi ne epos ae'prositi, mene
daeva.
(CONTINUED)
75.
CONTINUED:
PERSEUS
You are praying to me? There must
be a mistake.
The Shaikh proffers the gleaming bronze sickle which has
a zig-zag, LIGHTNING BOLT PATTERN engraved on the blade,
honoring Zeus.
PERSEUS
An offering'? I thank you and
take it humbly, as agift from a
friend, not an offering.
He takes the weapon and bows his head, surprising the
Shaikh.
SHAIKH SULEIMAN
Tuj patir esti ho theos kosmosr.
PERSEUS
You honor my father? You honor
Spyros?
SHAIKH SULEIMAN
Ho Zeus Patir... Zeus...
Perseus reacts, taken aback to hear it from this
mysterious stranger.
The Expedition ascends the sheer pinnacle via rain-slick
stairs and GROANING ROPE BRIDGES.
In a morning fog, the Expedition enters a circle of FREE-
STANDING MONOLITHS white with bird crap. All around:
regurgitated food, shredded garments and tiny human baby
bones.
A FLAP of WINGS and suddenly perched atop the stones are
the NORN SISTERS: URD, VERDANDI, and SKULD -- human-
sized owls with the gray faces of old crones
(Strix).
Each has one central EYE SOCKET; they share one
ARTIFICIAL ORB. The Strix toss the Eye between them and
pop it in to study the arrivals.
URD
(low, hoot-owl)
Amoun... So sorry to see you
again.
(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED:
AMOUN
Likewise, Urd. I seek your
counsel.
VERDANDI
(SHRIEKING)
You want us to tell you about
Leviathan.
AMOUN
You know already... of course.
VERDANDI
We know this -- the Kraken cannot
be defeated.
SKULD
(PIERCING)
You've wasted a journey. I trust
it was not a taxing one.
The Sisters CACKLE HORRIBLY. Skuld SWOOSHES down. Icos
and Krikor, terrified, hit the deck. Skuld tosses the
Eye back to Urd. Perseus watches with growing
irritation.
AMOUN
Surely the beast from the sea has
some weakness. You owe me this
answer at least.
URD
The Sisters owe nothing to you or
any Man!
She tosses the Eye to Verdandi, who focuses her attention
on Perseus.
VERDANDI
There's something wrong with that
one. I don't like having him
here.
SKULD
Let me take a look.
Verdandi tosses the Eye to Skuld. Perseus leaps and
snags the Eye out of mid-air. The Strix SCREECH.
Perseus goes to the precipice.
PERSEUS
Tell us what we want to know or
your Eye has seen its last.
(CONTINUED)
77.
CONTINUED:
The Norns flap their wings and puff up their feathers.
TO AMOUN:
VERDANDI
You've brought a thief into our
nest!
URD
A villain!
SKULD
Scum!
AMOUN
No, good Sisters... the son of
Zeus.
The Strix react in horror and all land on the same
monolith.
PERSEUS
Since you cannot see, let me tell
you what's about to happen. I'm
about to throw this evil Eye to
the rocks far below. I fear its
journey will be a taxing one.
The members of the Expedition are impressed; Vidalia,
too: the young demigod shows growing leadership. The
Strix are panicked --
URD
We can't tell you. We don't dare
betray Tiamat again.
VERDANDI
She sees all! Her touch is felt
in every evil thing!
SKULD
A second offense and she will
DESTROY USL
PERSEUS
You don't have to tell us the
secret. But you will have to live
as blind as she made you.
SKULD
No! Give us the Eye and we'll
tell.
PERSEUS
Tell me first. If I like the
answer, you get your Eye.
(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED:
VERDANDI
We need the Eye to see the answer!
AMOUN
You know the answer sure as you
already knew the question.
The Norn Sisters confer, enclosed in a curtain of wings.
THEN --
SKULD
Leviathan can be destroyed...
VERDANDI
The beast has one weakness.
SPYROS
Tell us now!
The Strix are torn, frightened. Finally --
URD
The stare of Medusa. No creature
can look directly in her eyes and
still survive.
The answer hangs in the silence of the stunned
Expedition.
AMOUN
They're lying, Perseus.
Perseus studies the Sisters, weighing his response.
PERSEUS
I believe them.
(tosses the Eye high)
Here's your second sight.
Verdandi launches and catches it in her beak, pops it in
her socket.
PERSEUS
(to the Norns)
And Medusa! Where does she abide?
SKULD
In Tartaros, beyond the frozen
Tethys Sea. Only Charon's ferry
dare challenge the ice.
PERSEUS
How can she be slain?
(CONTINUED)
79.
CONTINUED:
VERDANDI
With extraordinary cunning and
unimaginable luck.
Skuld flaps to the pitch-black portal to an UNDERGROUND
VAULT.
SKULD
And the proper tools. Explore our
cache of spoils. You may find
such a tool.
Perseus stares into the black entrance.
DRACO
Don't go in there, Perseus. It's
a trap.
VERDANDI
No. We have guaranteed the rage
of Tiamat with this revelation...
SKULD
. we ask only that the young God
mention our aid...
URD
... to his Father.
PERSEUS
(NODS)
If ever I should meet him.
(turns toward the
VAULT)
I need a light.
The Shaikh holds a branch near his eyes until the end
bursts into flame and hands it to Perseus, who disappears
into the blackness.
The STORM RAGES around a FLEET OF SHIPS, manned by
armored CREWMEN, that rises and falls on hundred-foot
mountains of water.
The FIRST MATE shouts to the stalwart CAPTAIN.
FIRST MATE
Captain, the storm is too great!
CAPTAIN
Joppa is under siege! King
Kepheus needs these supplies!
Something huge breaches the surface. The captain squints
through the rain... and sees the GIGANTIC SCUTED TAIL of
Leviathan. IT GOES RIGHT PAST THEM, miraculously leaving
the fleet untouched.
But then -- they HEAR a sound BIGGER than the typhoon.
The dark sky gets darker as an ENORMOUS BLACK SHAPE
appears behind the Fleet, bearing down on them at
impossible speed --
TIAMAT'S PALACE-GALLEON so dwarfs the Fleet that it PLOWS
THROUGH the other ships without noticing, obliterating
them in seconds, sending all hands to the depths.
FRIGHTENING VISAGE - NIGHT
Lit by FLASHES OF LIGHTNING. The Goddess smiles in
satisfaction at the devastation.
A bleak shore. A boulder jetty juts into the cold pewter
sea and fades into the fog. Chunks of ice bob on the
lapping waves.
SUPERIMPOSE: THE TETHYS SEA...
12 DAYS REMAINING
The Expedition, miserably wet, waits for passage around a
campfire on the frigid beach. Perseus, polishing the
shield he got from the Norns, looks to Amoun, who sits
smoking.
PERSEUS
Tell of the Gorgoneion.
(CONTINUED)
81.
CONTINUED:
AMOUN
The Rape of Medusa?
Everyone falls silent. The soldiers shift, suddenly
nervous.
THAD
With respect, Magi, do not recite
that black tale. You'll bring the
sky down upon us.
SPYROS
Does a fairy tale frighten you,
soldier?
Thad looks at him, sharply.
DRACO
Tell the story, sir. My men fear
only one thing -- to let fear in
their hearts.
Mongke says something that means, "Go ahead already."
AMOUN
Medusa was a tender young woman
once -- a mortal creature of such
rare beauty as to tempt even the
Gods. One night, on the road
home, she caught the eye of the
God of Deserts and Entropy -- Set
the Void.
A stunning beauty, YOUNG MEDUSA, carries a water pitcher.
Suddenly, frightened, she turns, sees something, drops
the pitcher and runs.
AMOUN (V.0.)
She hastened to hallowed ground,
thinking the Goddess Tiamat would
protect her in her temple. But
the God Set followed.
A SHADOW passes swiftly over the shattered pitcher, in
pursuit.
(PRESENT)
The Expedition all hang on Amoun's every word.
AMOUN
.. and cursed her with a hateful
stare that petrifies to stone all
that look upon her.
Grave silence. Draco realizes he's burned his dinner on
the fire. Spyros shakes his head. Perseus just stares,
a believer.
NOISES come from the fog: SPLINTERING ICE; SLOSHING
OARS. A SHAPE emerges -- an ice-cutting THREE-TIERED
GALLEY, oars moving with precision.
(CONTINUED)
83.
CONTINUED:
AMOUN
Charon's ferry.
The prow of the galley cuts through ice. Rows of oars
slice the frigid water, pulling the boat through at a
steady clip.
-- an icy, slick deck, snow. The Expedition huddle
around stoves, miserable. We HEAR the OARS BEAT, the
HULL GROAN, the ICE CRACKING. Charon CHORTLES, his VOICE
deeper than the sea --
CHARON
Better stoke those fires, boys,
it's going to get cold soon.
Spyros is at the rail, looking over the ocean of ice.
Perseus, troubled, arrives. Spyros looks at him closely.
PERSEUS
What?
SPYROS
Nothing.
PERSEUS
What do you see?
SPYROS
A look I know well.
PERSEUS
From me?
SPYROS
Never before.
PERSEUS
Then where?
Spyros smiles, puts his huge, calloused hand on Perseus'
shoulder.
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED:
SPYROS
In my own mirror, son.
PERSEUS
When does it go away?
SPYROS
If we're lucky... never.
A landscape of volcanic rock. Lava pouring into the sea
raises VEILS OF STEAM, through which the Expedition
disembarks from the galley.
SUPERIMPOSE: COAST OF TARTAROS...
10
DAYS REMAINING
The Expedition crosses the black terrain, lava vents here
or there.
In the distance, dark ruins -- an ominous tilted facade,
half-sunk in the dried lava flow.
SHAIKH SULEIMAN
Jaggous temploi Tartaros de
Gorgoneion maitress.
AMOUN
The Temple of Tartaros... Medusa's
lair.
Mongke and Tamburlane exchange words and point. They all
LOOK --
TWO STONE STATUES flank the entrance: a pair of enormous
CENTAURS -- NESSUS and IXION, their eyelids sewn shut.
Icos and Krikor exchange distressed looks.
AMOUN
Medusa must have turned them to
stone.
Perseus swings his sickle, measuring its balance, and
adjusts his shield. He checks a canvas sack on his belt.
PERSEUS
I'm going into the Temple.
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:
DRACO
I am with you.
SPYROS
(STEPS FORWARD)
I go with my boy.
Perseus, Spyros, and Draco split off toward the temple.
Suddenly, the two "statues," Nessus and Ixion, shake off
their dusty skins and COME TO LIFE. They GALLOP down the
ridge, hooves shaking the ground. They raise fearsome
spiky maces of jagged iron.
Vidalia readies her sling. The Shaikh draws his
scimitar. Mongke and Tamburlane load their handgonnes,
the others draw swords.
The Temple group arrives at the steps. Draco speaks to
PERSEUS
DRACO
Are you afraid?
PERSEUS
Of what?
DRACO
Good boy.
PERSEUS
Yes. You?
DRACO
(NODS)
Stay close and I'll steer us
through.
They tie on blindfolds and feel their way into the
Temple.
Nessus and Ixion arrive. Ixion's mace catches Krikor,
flinging him to his death in an open lava vent. Icos
CRIES OUT for his friend and charges in. Ixion smashes
him to oblivion.
Thad, enraged, races at Nessus, but the Centaur dodges
the massive Praetorian and kicks him in the chest,
killing him.
(CONTINUED)
88.
CONTINUED:
Nessus charges Amoun. Amoun throws a handful of sand,
which becomes a hail of STEEL-BARBED DARTS in midair,
C
which lash the Centaur's flesh.
Tamburlane rolls under the beast and fires his weapon.
Nessus hurls the monster-hunter against a boulder and
goes for him when --
-- Shaikh Suleiman jumps between them. His scimitar
slashes but is ripped from his hands. The Shaikh BOWS
HIS HEAD.
Nessus' mace shatters Shaikh Suleiman's head of charred
wood. BLUE FIRE shoots out his neck, ENVELOPING THE
CENTAUR. The burning Centaur crumples, dead.
Ixion SLAMS his mace down, just missing Amoun. Suddenly,
Vidalia's sling-bullets slice his flesh. Ixion turns and
leaps at Vidalia.
THE AFTERMATH: the survivors -- Vidalia, Amoun, Mongke,
and Tamburlane -- take mournful stock of their losses.
Mongke sees something, smiles and SWEARS in his language.
They all turn to see:
Perseus and Spyros, spent and saddened, stand at the top
of the Temple steps. Perseus grasps the canvas sack.
Now it holds Medusa's head, which bloodies the whole bag
and sends a crimson drip to the stones. There is still
movement in there -- squirming serpents.
91.
Rain and waves pound the Lower Wharf, the water choked
with debris and rotting corpses.
- HIGH PARAPET - NIGHT
Kepheus stands in the rain with his MINISTER OF DEFENSE
and GENERALS at his side. A massive tent town has been
pitched in the piazza. VOICES -- frequent and angry --
SHOUT CURSES at the Basilica.
KEPHEUS
The relief fleet is lost.
Monsters gather outside our walls.
Soon I won't be able to keep my
own people at bay. And still, no
word from the Expedition.
Kepheus raises a spyglass to survey the view beyond the
city walls.
SPYGLASS POV - TIAMAT'S ARMY
on the plain outside the city. BONFIRES RAGE, monster
regiments assemble. Siege towers roll toward the city.
BACK TO SCENE
KEPHEUS
Tiamat commands a massive horde.
How many days remain?
MINISTER OF DEFENSE
Four, Majesty...
Kepheus lowers the glass, looking grim.
GENERAL ANDOR
Our forces prepare. We have cards
yet to play. We'll buy the time
we need until...
KEPHEUS
Until the Expedition perhaps
returns?... Until we're saved by
the fisherman's son?
MINISTER OF DEFENSE
My king, remember and take hope...
he is not truly the son of a
fisherman.

92.

KEPHEUS
(SKEPTICAL)
From your lips, I pray, to his
true father's ear.
Andromeda has appeared. All are shocked to see her. She
addresses the others with an authority we've never seen.
ANDROMEDA
I would speak with the King in
private.
MINISTER OF DEFENSE
Princess, let us find a protected
PLACE --
ANDROMEDA
We can speak here, in the elements
our subjects endure.
The King's men exchange looks, then bow discreetly away,
leaving father and daughter alone. Andromeda looks down
at the tent city.
KEPHEUS
They take refuge from the Lower
Wharf. A sight I wish you'd never
seen.
ANDROMEDA
You've sheltered me too long from
the hard things in this world.
KEPHEUS
I would have it no other way.
ANDROMEDA
And I thank you for the gift of my
cosseted youth. But now, with
Mother so...
(turns to him)
It's time I shared this burden
you've carried so long.
Filled with emotion, he puts an arm around her.
KEPHEUS
You make me proud, but you are
only a child... my little one.
ANDROMEDA
No, no longer. Your protection of
me has brought hardship to our
people...
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
93.
CONTINUED:
ANDROMEDA (CONT'D)
and to me, perhaps, new
understanding. I must ask you
something, Father.
She turns away from his gaze and looks down at the city.
ANDROMEDA
If you could end this siege with
just one unselfish act, would you
do it?
KEPHEUS
To save my people, yes, of course.
ANDROMEDA
Such an act is within my power.
He studies her a moment, then becomes alarmed.
KEPH EUS
Stop itl I forbid you to
entertain such thoughts.
ANDROMEDA
Perseus and the others were
willing to give everything.
KEPHEUS
(turns her to him)
Listen to me. By the time this is
over, your mother and I may well
be gone. But I guarantee the day
is coming when Joppa will know
glory under Queen Andromeda.
She embraces him, head upon his shoulder, where he can't
see her resolve.
ANDROMEDA
Be at peace, Father, I will not
cause you any more sadness than I
already have.
- MILESTONE - DAY
An ancient walled road curves over the pastoral orchard
hills.
SUPERIMPOSE: MILESTONE, HILLS OF ILLYRIA... 3 DAYS
REMAINING
The exhausted Expedition is now six: Perseus, Vidalia,
Amoun, Spyros, Mongke, and Tamburlane. They've stopped
at a well beside a MILESTONE.
(CONTINUED)
94.
CONTINUED:
Spyros studies the ancient words carved into the
milestone: "Polis of JOVE PATER : XI stadia S."
SPYROS
Eleven stadia to the South... What
is 'Polis of Jove Pater'? I'm
ignorant of this.
AMOUN
Jove the Father is another name by
which Zeus was known. This
milestone dates from when city
states were named for their patron
deities.
Perseus, filling his canteen, peers at the marker as
Amoun uses one hand to cover the letters "-VE" and the
other the letters "-TER."
AMOUN
'The Polis of Jove Pater' is the
ancient name of --
PERSEUS
-- Joppa.
AMOUN
Yes, Joppa... once the most sacred
site in the worship of Jove.
PERSEUS
(dawning on him)
Tiamat chooses the city of Zeus to
take hostage.
(as Amoun confirms
THIS)
She compels the people to make
human sacrifice of the Princess
Andromeda...
AMOUN
. and transforms Joppa into the
new church of Tiamat. The ancient
abode of Zeus...
VIDALIA
(QUIETLY)
becomes the new home of
Tiamat, granting her sway to
supplant him as the God of Gods.
(urgently to Perseus)
You can't allow Tiamat to rule
Olympos.
(CONTINUED)
95.
CONTINUED:
Perseus holds her look. "No," he won't let that happen.
But in his eyes are fear and doubt.
- MAGIC HOUR
The Expedition passes through deep woods. Spyros and
Perseus ride side by side.
PERSEUS
Father, we've seen much on this
journey we cannot hold in our
hands. Yet these things are real
enough. At each turn, we find
monsters and Gods.
SPYROS
Yes, the evidence is everywhere
once we leave our island. That's
why I so rarely leave. These
Gods, what do you make of them?
PERSEUS
As you always said, they're petty,
vengeful... and dangerous.
SPYROS
Yes, as bad as men.
(as Perseus smiles)
And would you have that sort guide
your life?
PERSEUS
No. Men must be accountable to
themselves. Otherwise we serve
poor masters.
SPYROS
That's my boy.
Amoun rides up.
AMOUN
We should stop for the night.
PERSEUS
We must keep moving. Time is
running out.
SPYROS
If we don't rest the horses, they
won't make it to Joppa.
(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED:
AMOUN
(TO PERSEUS)
We all need rest. If you don't
save yourself, you'll have nothing
left when you face the Kraken.
Riding behind them, Vidalia (paler and more ephemeral
than ever) is suddenly alert. She peers into the woods,
agitated. Then she EXCLAIMS SOFTLY, dismounts and runs
into the woods.
PERSEUS
Vidalia!
Perseus slides from his horse and follows her. Mongke
says something to Tamburlane; they LAUGH. Amoun to
SPYROS:
AMOUN
Why don't we stop here tonight?
Spyros smiles, looking off after Perseus.
(ILLYRIA)
- DARK GROVE - MAGIC HOUR
Vidalia darts through the trees. She stops, closes her
eyes, moves off again.
THROUGH A STAND OF TREES, Vidalia appears again, and
stops, searching her senses. Perseus arrives and watches
her.
VIDALIA
I know this place...
Suddenly, she hurries to the trunk of an ancient tree.
She probes the foliage, steps forward... and descends
into the ground, out of sight.
Following, Perseus pulls away greenery, revealing an
opening in the tree's massive roots.
The GONG sounds a THIRD TIME. Peshet opens a lock and
sets the heavy gate ajar. She looks at the dagger in her
palm and hurries inside.
After a moment, four CLOAKED REBELS slip through the open
gate.
104.
Peshet leads Andromeda out.
ANDROMEDA
We must get to my mother and
father.
A VOICE from the darkness:
AGENOR (O.S.)
Your father is dead and your
mother has been relieved of her
suffering.
The four Cloaked Rebels step into the light. Agenor
wipes his bloody dagger on his cloak as all four advance.
AGENOR
The Princessa is coming with us.
She has a rendezvous to keep.
Peshet WHIPS HER DAGGER through the air; it THUDS into
the neck of the First Rebel, killing him on his feet.
Before he can fall, Peshet leaps to him and pulls out her
knife. She plants herself in front of Andromeda.
PESHET
Come and get her.
Agenor and the other two circle Peshet. She moves with
feline agility, but is separated from the Princess. To
the Second Rebel --
AGENOR
Take the Princess -- alive!
The Second Rebel circles around Peshet toward Andromeda.
PESHET
Run, Princess! Save yourself.
Peshet leaps on the Third Rebel.
Andromeda runs away from the Second Rebel, who easily
closes the gap.
(CONTINUED)
106.
CONTINUED:
SECOND REBEL
You're not going anywhere, Your
Highness.
He grabs her in a bear hug from behind. She spins, tiny
within his massive arms, and is suddenly facing him. He
JOLTS in surprise, Andromeda's knife in his belly. He
falls on her, dead.
Peshet wins her struggle with the Third Rebel, sinking
her dagger in him. She GASPS. Agenor has thrust his
blade into her ribs. She totters and COUGHS -- deep and
bloody. Peshet falls against the wall.
Andromeda WAILS at the sight. She is pinned beneath the
dead weight of the Second Rebel, unable to move. Agenor
finishes off Peshet and turns to the Princess.
The survivors -- Perseus, Vidalia, Spyros, Mongke, and
Tamburlane -- crest a hill in the RAINY DAWN LIGHT.
Vidalia is almost transparent. The Expedition reacts in
shock to what they see.
FROM BEHIND THE GROUP
They're on a shelf above the wide, flat basin that lies
outside Joppa. A limitless INHUMAN ARMY -- Centaurs,
Minotaurs, Monsters of every stripe -- fills the plain,
right up to the city walls.
Among the regiments of Joppans waiting nervously for the
battle are ranks of fifteen-foot AUTOMATA (CLOCKWORK
SOLDIERS). OPERATORS feverishly work the mechanisms of
the steel soldiers, which flex their artificial limbs and
weigh their massive weapons.
Mongke and Tamburlane exchange words. For the first
time, they look impressed -- but also delighted. This is
what they live for.
Spyros looks over at his adopted son.
(CONTINUED)
107.
CONTINUED:
SPYROS
If it should come to pass, tell
your mother and sister I loved
them much.
Perseus reaches out and touches his foster father warmly.
PERSEUS
You'll have to tell them yourself.
Vidalia's voice has become weaker.
VIDALIA
The people are frightened. But
they can triumph.. They need only
one thing.
Perseus turns to her, a question on his face -- "Tell
me...

VIDALIA
A hero. They're waiting for you,
Perseus.
Perseus looks back toward the city. At last, there is no
uncertainty in Perseus --
PERSEUS
I will not fail them.
He turns toward the Goddess, but Vidalia is gone.
PERSEUS
Vidalia?
(realizing,
ANGUISHED)
No.
It's too late. She's disappeared.
PELTING RAIN. HUNDREDS OF ONLOOKERS have gathered.
An IRON WINCH sits on a GRANITE PLATFORM on the cliff's
edge. Fantasos and his cohorts wait beside a huge BRONZE
GONG.
Agenor brings Andromeda barefoot through the mud. The
onlookers jostle for a better view, some spiteful, some
sad, all curious.

Agenor removes Andromeda's cloak, revealing her tattered
nightgown. Fantasos inspects the MYSTERIOUS SYMBOLS
inked on her naked back, streaked by rain.
Agenor's thugs chain her to the winch at the precipice,
hundreds of feet above the raging sea. As the winch is
cranked, the chain lifts Andromeda upside down from the
ground.
Agenor pulls Andromeda close and flashes a cruel grin.
She spits in his eye. He wipes his eyes and lets go of
the chain.

As she RISES: The cliff drops straight down the jagged
wall to the churning waves.

FANTASOS

O Leviathan, firstborn of the
Deep, accept this offering of
mortal flesh... for the exaltation

OFF THE COAST OF JOPPA, a dark shape emerges from the
squall -- Tiamat's enormous Palace-Galleon.
The Goddess is at the prow, looking toward the cliffs of
Joppa expectantly.

As the huge GONG IS STRUCK --
CUT TO:
THE FACES OF THE ONLOOKERS
Then... GONG! Fantasos continuing his incantations,
then... GONG! Andromeda's face, her frightened eyes
searching the ocean. Everyone looks out to sea, waiting.
109.
Perseus, Spyros, Mongke, and Tamburlane hear the far-off
GONG, GONG, GONG. The Mongols speak to Perseus in their
language, worried.
SPYROS
The sacrifice has begun.
PERSEUS
I must get to the cliffs!
SPYROS
How?
They all look at what separates them from the city --
The MONSTER ARMY OF TIAMAT surges forward with savage
BATTLE CRIES.
The GATES OF THE CITY swing open. Out march the giant
mechanical AUTOMATA, followed by streaming legions of
JOPPAN INFANTRY. The two armies slam together --
The battle is joined. THEY FIGHT.
GONG! The wind rocks Andromeda on her CREAKING CHAIN.
She watches...
A mile offshore, a BULGE OF WATER SWELLS and plows toward
the coast.
The Onlookers watch in terrified awe as the swell races
closer.
Leviathan explodes from the surface, too huge to be seen
whole. It shoots straight up, up, up the three-hundred-
foot cliffs.
The Kraken's jaws hurtle up at Andromeda. Onlookers
recoil. Fantasos stumbles in panicked retreat. The
creature's BELLOW is deafening.
At the apex of its surge, it SNAPS ITS JAWS SHUT with a
booming THUNDERCRACK... just millimeters from Andromeda's
dangling head -- and FALLS BACK. Churning surf surrounds
its endless SLIDE back down.
110.
ANDROMEDA'S POV
The Kraken slips underwater and its vast shadow
immediately begins to circle wide for another attempt.
- DAY
Spyros, Mongke and Tamburlane mount their nervous horses.
PUSH IN ON Perseus, who does not mount up. From his
saddle, he takes the bloody canvas bag with Medusa's head
inside and slaps his horse away. Be MURMURS the
INCANTATION Vidalia planted in his mind.
FLASHES OF WHAT PERSEUS SEES
A white lid opens to a black eye... Feathered WINGS beat
the air... The rippled flanks of a WHITE CREATURE.
BACK TO SCENE
Perseus HEARS the BEATING OF THE WINGS and looks toward
the forest.
PEGASUS WHOOSHES over the treetops, BANKS and LANDS in
front of Perseus. It bows, inviting Perseus aboard.
Perseus climbs on and rides up to the others, who are
flabbergasted.
PERSEUS
May we all have a good ride today!
He spurs Pegasus. it beats its wings, launching from the
ridge with astounding power.
MONGKE AND TAMBURLANE
Qi chin yang hung xian!
SPYROS
No shit.
They raise their weapons and spur their horses down the
slope to war.
CLICK-CLACK-CLICK-CLACK. The chain lowers Andromeda
toward the sea.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:
Andromeda manages to get herself swinging back and forth
until she builds enough momentum to reach up and grasp
the links above her. With effort, she climbs the very
chain she dangles from, leaving a slack loop beneath.
Leviathan's eyes break the surface below, watching
Andromeda. With a HOWL, Leviathan HURTLES UPWARDS, jaws
wide.
FROM ABOVE - ANDROMEDA
Leviathan grows huge as it leaps for her. UP, UP, UP.
The JAWS SNAP CLOSED... just below her climbing feet. So
close, it BITES ON THE DROOPING SLACK OF CHAIN!
The monster slides back down, clutching the chain in its
jaws. The Princessa plummets with it.
UP ON THE PLATFORM
The chain unreels wildly, pulls tight... and rips the
platform from its anchors. It careens over the edge,
taking Fantasos, Agenor and their Thugs to their
screaming death.
A SHADOW glides over the shocked onlookers. One by one,
they tear their gaze from the sea and look up, GASPING
AT --
PERSEUS AND PEGASUS descending. Perseus sees Andromeda
splash down and get pulled under.
The winch platform SLAMS into the cliff face, pulled by
Leviathan.
PERSEUS' DIVING POV
Exactly the image he saw when Vidalia first planted the
spell in his mind -- down, down toward the dark sea.
BACK TO SCENE
Perseus and Pegasus arrive a moment before the crashing
winch. Perseus dives off with the bloody Medusa bag in
hand. With his free hand, he catches the chain just
ahead of the winch and goes under.
112.
Leviathan hurtles downward. Andromeda flails, bound to
the chain.
FAR ABOVE
Perseus grips both the chain and the bag in his hand.
Leviathan spirals on, but THE WINCH CATCHES ON A REEF and
the chain SNAPS! Andromeda, suddenly separated from the
monster, sinks, weighted by her shackles.
Perseus, swimming with the raw power of a porpoise, dives
after her, but loses his grip on the bag. Desperate, he
looks back and forth: Andromeda, the sack -- both
sinking. Perseus goes after the sack.
Leviathan realizes it has lost the Princess. Huge eyes
darting, it spots Andromeda and surges down after her.
Andromeda, drowning, passes out. Tiny bubbles leak from
her nose. Leviathan swims down to her, eye as big as her
entire body.
The wreck of a SUNKEN WHALER rests on the ocean floor.
The Medusa sack FALLS INTO VIEW and catches on a harpoon
wedged in the deck. Perseus appears, snags the sack and
is about to kick upward. On impulse, he grabs the
harpoon.
Leviathan opens its huge jaws. Andromeda is sucked
toward the maw.
Perseus swims upward toward Leviathan's tail. Perseus
concentrates -- a sparking BURST OF WHITE ENERGY shoots
through his forearm to the harpoon in his grip.
LIGHTNING CRACKLES and BOILS the water. He plunges the
harpoon in the Kraken's tail --
-- at the same moment Leviathan inhales the unconscious
Andromeda.
Contact -- an ELECTRIC FLASH-POINT FLARES and a charge
races up Leviathan's spine. Jolted, the monster spits
Andromeda out.
The Kraken twists to lock its enraged gaze on Perseus.
Perseus shuts his eyes and yanks Medusa's head from the
sack. Medusa's hellish eyes ignite channels of boiling
energy into Leviathan's enormous eyeballs -- hardening
them to boiled eggs, then rocky spheres.
(CONTINUED)
113.
CONTINUED:
The monster thrashes, tries to turn -- but unbending
stone races its length, freezing the gargantuan curves --
the scuted tail locks mid-flail into a final, permanent
hook.
Dead in the water, the grotesque mass sinks like a
mountain range, picking up speed as it plunges into the
ABYSS
--
Perseus must swim like a God to snatch Andromeda from the
downward tug. The stone Kraken barely misses them as it
DROPS --
-- and CRASHES in a cloud of silt, SHAKING THE OCEAN
FLOOR like an earthquake. A CRACK opens in the seabed
and sucks back the silt. The trench deepens and streaks
away across the seabed, swallowing all the water above
it, creating a giant opening to the sky.
(OCEAN)
- PROW - DAY
Tiamat's face contorts, sensing her beloved Leviathan is
dead. She turns at the sound of GHASTLY CREAKING -- the
immense length of the galleon buckles into a hole in the
ocean. As the towering masts drop below wave-level,
Tiamat raises her arms to the sky --
TIAMAT
I damn you, Zeus! You will hear
my curses forever in the crash of
SURF
--
Walls of water collapse, burying the Goddess, her ship,
and her malediction deep in her realm. We HEAR a world-
rocking ROAR, which booms off toward --
Tiamat's Monster Army is DEAFENED by the BOOM, losing all
spirit with the unmistakable certainty that their Goddess
is gone.
THE TIDE TURNS IN THE BATTLE as the Joppans and their
steel allies, the Automata, wade into the ranks of
creatures.
Mongke and Tamburlane, in the center of the battle, find
the opposition turning tail. They roar and lift their
weapons high, surviving yet another fight. Spyros,
bloodied but unbowed, smiles wide and sits down in the
mud, exhausted.
114.
The water stills. The sea calms. No sign of Perseus or
Andromeda. WIND and QUIET...
CHOOM! Perseus surfaces with Andromeda in his arms,
GASPING FOR AIR.
The onlookers rejoice.
BACK WITH Perseus and Andromeda. He looks at her
lifeless countenance in agony -- has he failed again as
he did with Anteros the fisherman??
Distraught, his muscles go taut around Andromeda, and a
short powerful burst of electric energy shoots from his
arms into her still body -- SHE JOLTS TO LIFE!
Movement! Breath! Color returns to her face. Perseus,
too, breathes again, relieved.
For the first time since the start of the adventure, they
find themselves alone, holding each other.
PERSEUS
Hello.
(as she smiles,
RELIEVED)
Are you all right?
She takes a moment, doing an inventory. Finally, she
nods.
ANDROMEDA
I think I am.
He smiles. She'll never know how close they came to
oblivion.
ANDROMEDA
Are you ready to become a king?
His expression is kind, but unmistakable. "No." She
accepts that, rueful.
PERSEUS
Are you ready to become a queen?
(CONTINUED)
115.
CONTINUED:
She thinks about it, her face beginning to light with
confidence.
ANDROMEDA
Yes. Yes, I am.
PERSEUS
Then you're ready to go home.
Perseus raises one arm. The-AIR reverberates to a LOUD
BEATING OF WINGS. Andromeda looks up in wonder.
Pegasus appears out of the sun's glare, gracefully
alighting on the water. Perseus helps Andromeda up and
then climbs on behind her.
Pegasus takes off. TILT UP WITH them until they are lost
from sight.
DISSOLVE TO:
Black smoke RISES to dirty the perfect sky. TILT DOWN
TO:
The Sacred Ground of Joppa in the verdant hills, above
the sea, is so beautiful it might be mistaken for
Olympos.
TWO FUNERAL PYRES burn. The citizens of Joppa, by the
thousands, commend King Kepheus and Queen Cassiopeia to
the afterlife.
MOVING OVER THE CROWD, WE PUSH THROUGH the flame to find
the new ruler of Joppa. Mournful, but cloaked in regal
dignity and strength -- QUEEN ANDROMEDA.
CUT TO:
A DISTANT POV OF THE QUEEN
The ceremony and the heavenly setting.
PERSEUS
Perseus views the scene from a nearby hill. Behind him,
Pegasus waits patiently, grazing the grass. Until --
(CONTINUED)
116.
CONTINUED:
-- the equine suddenly WHINNIES and REARS UP. Just as
quickly, Pegasus goes silent and BOWS DOWN. Perseus
looks in that direction, to find --
ZEUS the Prime, God of Gods, an eagle perched on his arm.
He couldn't look more imposing.
ZEUS
Am I to understand you do not
intend to make this union with the
Queen Andromeda?
PERSEUS
Yes.
ZEUS
Despite my will and intention that
you do so?
PERSEUS
Yes.
ZEUS
Would you choose to condemn Men,
your own people, to suffer more of
this devastating War?
PERSEUS
I have no people. You have
stranded me between realms,
neither man nor God.
ZEUS
(STERNLY)
Do you reproach Zeus?
PERSEUS
No. I thank you... Father.
Zeus, mighty God, reacts to the word. His expression
softens and he looks on Perseus with growing pride.
PERSEUS
You have freed me. I will not be
a pawn for Men or Gods.
ZEUS
Does that absolve you suddenly of
your responsibilities?
PERSEUS
You've made me understand that my
responsibility is to myself. So
it is with us all.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
117.
CONTINUED:
PERSEUS
(INTIMATELY)
You've put me to a great test. In
the midst of it, I found the
courage in my heart to defy Gods.
I do not know how much of that
comes from you, Father... and how
much from my Mother, who I never
knew.
Zeus starts, subtly, at the mention of Queen Danae.
PERSEUS
It matters not. Whatever the
source, I are only grateful.
He looks off toward the funeral pyres and the human
throng.
PERSEUS
This war will end the moment you
choose for it to end... and Men
agree. I think, perhaps, that is
the free will that all realms
share.
Zeus looks at him, proud, yet wistful -- what an
offspring, what a creation!
ZEUS
What will you do, Man of free
will?
Perseus motions Pegasus forward, and swings up onto his
back.
PERSEUS
I'm going to find Vidalia.
ZEUS
So... my Son, you will be a pawn
for love?
PERSEUS
(LAUGHS)
Yes, Father, gladly.
Perseus spurs Pegasus and launches into the sky. And
soars away.
FADE OUT.
