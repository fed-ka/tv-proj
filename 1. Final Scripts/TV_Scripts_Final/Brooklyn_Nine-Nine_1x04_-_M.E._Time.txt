  INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT (N1)11

  AMY, in a nice dress, is on a date with a handsome guy, GABE.

                              AMY
                I m so glad we could finally do this.  

                              GABE
                I know, Kylie says you re always stuck at 
                the precinct.

  Amy s phone BUZZES.  She looks at the caller ID.

                              AMY
                Speaking of.  This is work right now.

                What s up, Peralta?

  INTERCUT with JAKE, who is on his phone, in A HALLWAY.

                              JAKE 
                Captain just called.  He wants everybody 
                back here.  We got a lead on the 
                  Nightingale Strangler.  He s in Brooklyn.

  She holds up a  one second  finger to her date.

                              JAKE (ON PHONE) (CONT D)
                We re looking for a white male.  Five 
                ten.  Brown hair.  Medium build.  Small 
                scar on his right cheek.  

  Amy looks over at Gabe.  He s five-ten.  He has brown hair.  
  There s a small scar on his cheek.  

                              AMY
                ...Oh.  Okay.

  Reveal Jake is actually in the restaurant, nearby, looking at

                fitting lettuce into his mouth --

                              AMY
                      (annoyed)
                Okay.  Where are you?

  As Jake walks up to Amy...

                              JAKE
                  Apparently, he has the world s smallest 
                penis and he doesn t know how to use it --
                      (then instantly, to Gabe)
                Hi there, Jake Peralta, I m Amy s boss.

                              AMY
                That s not true.  What are you doing 
                here?

                              JAKE
                I m just here with my date --
                      (looks around)
                -- who is now leaving.  Worth it.  Okay, 
                have a great night!

  Jake leaves.

                              GABE
                Your boss seems really nice.

                              AMY

  Scully, and Hitchcock watch.

  Jake wipes his forehead and licks his finger.

                              JAKE
                Mmmm.  That s the sugary sweet taste of 
                triumph.

                              ROSA
                You should shower more.

                Updates on open cases?

                              JAKE
                Don t have any, because I closed all 
                mine.  Did you guys hear about my five 
                felonies in one week?

                  Detectives.  Our monthly crime statistics 
                are due.  I want all paperwork on your

                can just write,  I didn t close any,  on 
                a piece of paper.

                                SCULLY
                You got it.

                              AMY
                  I already got my paperwork in, Captain.

                Then I guess this reminder isn t for you. 

  Jake whispers to Amy.

                              JAKE
                Yikes.  I think he hates you more than 
                me.

                              AMY
                No, he doesn t.  We have a good 
                  relationship.  We re on the same page.

  People filter back to their desks.

                              AMY
                Hey Boyle, I know you haven t had Peralta 
                as a secondary in a while.  Be careful: 
                it can be rough.

                              JAKE
                What?!  I m a great secondary.

                What do you want, Quasimodo?  I gotta go 
                meet Boyle and Peralta.

                              AMY
                Is there something wrong with the 
                captain?  Seems like he s in a bad mood.

                I went to Barbados with my husband.  It 
                was glorious.  We wove hats out of palm

  INT. PATTERSON S APARTMENT - LATER (D2)1313

  Jake, Charles and Rosa enter the apartment.  On the floor is 
  the body of a morbidly OBESE MAN (Frank Patterson) under a 
  sheet -- all we see is the mountainous arc of his belly.

                              JAKE
                Well, I think we have some idea what 
                killed him.  Spoiler alert: it was not 
                  starvation.

  A UNIFORMED COP approaches.

                no children.  Wife found him this morning

                              CHARLES
                Any signs of forced entry or a struggle?

                cardiac wing of Brooklyn Methodist.  This 
                case is open-and-shut.  Like his mouth 
                was, constantly.  Sorry, that was my last 
                fat joke.
                      (then, more serious)
                Diaz, check the bathroom for more meds.  
                Boyle, see what you can find in the 
                bedroom.  I ll take the kitchen.

  Jake heads off.  Rosa looks at Charles.

                              CHARLES
                Yep.  That s exactly what I was going to 
                say to do.  It s like he s so good at 
                  following my orders, he s saying them 
                first.  Weird.

  Charles smiles weakly.

                I know you think you re complimenting me,

                  refrigerator contents, but it turned out

                To you, and to the enormous dead fat man 
                who brought us together.

  They clink glasses.  Jake takes a sip of water.

                              ROSSI
                  A surprising number of people die every 
                year from choking on sips of water.

                              JAKE
                That is surprising.  Seems so easy to 
                swallow.  Maybe just for me.
                      (re: Rossi s food)
                  Everything okay?

  REVEAL: Rossi has dissected her chicken like it s a cadaver, 
  and pinned it open using two forks. 

                              ROSSI
                More than okay.  Look at the way the 
                tendons cling to the bone.  The striated 
                muscle tissue structure is gorgeous.  
                Total yum.

                              JAKE
                Well, this place is known for their 
                clinging tendons and striated muscle.

  She giggles.

                              ROSSI
                I m really glad you were able to sneak 
                away from your case.

                              JAKE
                It s not technically my case.  I got all 
                the time in the world.

                  lemon-infused madelleines, dusted with

                              JAKE
                That s weird.  Maybe probably a ton of 
                other people died and she got busy.  
                That s what definitely happened.

                              CHARLES
                Just let me know when she calls.

  Jake closes his eyes.  She takes an ice cube out of her 
  whiskey, and rubs it on Jake s lips.

                It shouldn t matter.  I m your primary 
                and I asked you to do something.  And if 
                it s okay, I d like to be upset with you.

                              JAKE
                Well, if this might be murder, let s not 
                waste time on how this is my fault, or 
                how bad a secondary I am, or why I m 
                suddenly turned on by formaldehyde.

  They all look grossed out, except for Rossi.

                              JAKE (CONT D)
                  Maya...Dr. Rossi, can you perform the 
                autopsy right now?

                              ROSSI
                With a body that size, I need my 
                  assistant.  And I gave him the rest of 
                the day off when Jake showed up here. 

  They all turn to look accusingly at Jake.

                              JAKE
                Fine.  I will assist you.  Because I am 
                an amazing secondary.  Anyway, how gross 
                could it be?

                              ROSSI
                It s not gross at all.  It s hot.  Now 
                gown up and put on some waterproof boots.

                Sir, I don t think you realize how good 
                 flat numbers  are.  I went back 12 years 
                -- a precinct's numbers almost always get 
                worse under new leadership.  But ours

                      (smiles)
                God, it feels so good to say that.
                      (to Mrs. Patterson)
                Sorry -- probably not for you.Brooklyn Nine-Nine    M.E. Time     Pink Revised Pages    9/8/13   31.

                              MRS. PATTERSON
                It s okay.  I shouldn t have killed 
                anyone.

  Jake clasps Charles s shoulder proudly.

  INT. BULLPEN - TERRY S DESK - END OF SHIFT (N3)4343

  Terry, Amy, Rosa, Scully, Hitchcock.  They re admiring 
  Terry s painting.

                              ROSA
                Sarge, that painting is tight.

                It s terrible.  The brushwork is sloppy.  
                Poor use of negative space.  I m a fraud.

  Holt walks up.

                              HOLT
                Not at all.  It s incredibly well 
                  executed.  I d like to take it home for 
                my husband.   He ll be glad you made me 
                look so happy.

  He leaves.

                              TERRY
                I was trying to make him look serious.  I 
                still can t read him.

                              ROSA
                No one can.

                              AMY
                I can.  He likes it.

  Jake sits with Charles and Rosa and a ROUND of BEERS.

                              ROSA
                Nice job, Boyle, you nailed it.

                              JAKE
                Of course he did.  He s a great primary.  
                I m sorry I was such a bad number two.  
                      (sincere)
                For the first time in my life, I may have 
                been a jerk.

  Jake is taken aback.  Charles smiles.

                              CHARLES (CONT D)
                You ve still never been a jerk.

                              JAKE
                No, Charles, I was.  And I m sorry.

  Jake puts his arm on Charles  shoulders.

                              CHARLES
                What a wonderful moment!
                      (looking at his phone)
                Ugh.  The DA wants to set bail for 
                  Patterson s wife.  They need me to send 
                them all the files. 

  Jake looks from Charles to Rosa.

                              JAKE
                I m secondary -- let me take care of that
