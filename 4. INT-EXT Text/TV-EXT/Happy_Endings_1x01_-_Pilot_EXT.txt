      Hot Guy BURSTS out -- JUMPS in his car -- and PEELS OUT!



      Hot Guy RACES through the streets of Chicago like the END OF 
      A SHITTY ROMCOM!  He WHIPS around a corner and -- GRIDLOCK!  
      He s TRAPPED in traffic!  He looks around FRANTICALLY -- then 
      spots his ROLLERBLADES on the floor.  Beat.



      Brad, Jane, Penny and Max (all in loosened/rumpled wedding 
      clothes) sit around a table, SHOCKED, SILENT.  Long beat.

                                  BRAD
                    Wow.  I mean...wow.  You just don t 
                    see that everyday.  

                                  JANE
                    Who was that guy?  Does anyone know 
                    who that was?

      They all shake their heads no.

                                  PENNY
                    I don t know what s more shocking, 
                    that Alex ran out on her wedding, 
                    or that she did it with a guy who 
                      rollerblades.

                                  MAX
                    Even I think rollerblades are gay 
                    and I had sex with a man last night.

                                  BRAD
                    Has anyone talked to either of 
                    them?  Both their phones are off.

                                  PENNY
                    Dave texted me that he s fine, he 
                    just doesn t wanna talk for awhile.  
                    But he said he s okay.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      Dave CRIES HYSTERICALLY as he drives!  As CARS pass him, the 
      DRIVERS HONK/SMILE/WAVE at Dave enthusiastically!  

      A SHOT of the back of Dave s car reveals a big SIGN:  HONK! 
      WE JUST GOT MARRIED! 

                                                                      CUT BACK TO:


      Dave/Max/Brad load the boxes into Dave s car.

                                  DAVE
                          (trying to be nonchalant)
                    So...do you know if Alex is gonna 
                    be there, though?  
                          (faux tough)
                    Not that I care at all. 

                                  BRAD
                          (sensing Dave s reluctance)
                    I don t know, man.  But...hey, 
                    everyone would really understand if 
                    you can t handle going.

                                  DAVE
                          (scoffs, slams the trunk)
                    You kidding me?  Alex can t handle 
                    going.  I can totally handle it.  
                    I m gonna handle it like an adult.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Todd and Penny talk by his car.

                                  PENNY
                      So...crazy night, right?  Sorry.  
                    Do...you still wanna come over?

                                  TODD
                      I actually have an early morning, so... 

      Beat.  Todd sorta BRO-HUGS her, then gets in his car and 
      goes.  Penny s SAD.  She turns around to -- Brad/Jane/Max/ 
      Alex/Dave there.  They don t know what to say.  Beat.  Then 
      they all TALK SIMULTANEOUSLY (Max trails in at the end). 

                                      JANE/DAVE/ALEX/BRAD
                        Sorry./Loser./Forget him./His loss.                                                                                    32.


                                  MAX
                      Guaranteed small peen.

                                  BRAD
                          (rolls his eyes, then)
                    No Pen, it s my fault.  I m the one 
                    that brought the walker.  I m just 
                    ...not the funny gift guy.  Sorry.

      They all look to Penny, scared for her reaction.  Long beat.

                                  PENNY
                    It s not your fault.  It s mine.  I 
                    was never this...psycho.  Guys used 
                    to lie to have sex with me.  Guys a 
                    lot cooler than Todd.  Something 
                    about getting close to 30 turned me 
                    into a Sex and the City character.  
                    It s embarrassing.  And I m sure 
                    I ve probably been driving you guys 
                    crazy.  So...I m sorry.    

      They re all TAKEN ABACK by her mature reaction.  Beat.

                                  MAX
                    We forgive you.

                                  PENNY
                    Uh, you re still an asshole for 
                    hitting on him all night.

                                  ALEX
                    Guys c mon, all this fighting is 
                    really just cause of me and Dave.  Or 
                    me, I guess.  I mean, Jane - You ve 
                    wanted to be a soccer mom since you 
                    were 6.  What s really changed?  And 
                    Brad might be the most uncool black 
                    guy on the planet, but he just wants 
                    what s best for you guys.
                          (Jane laughs/SMILES at Brad)
                    And Pen - Max was just trying to 
                    break up the tension that we caused.  
                      And...he s an idiot.  

                                  MAX
                    I really am a moron.

                                  PENNY
                          (finally laughs/smiles)
                    It s cool.  There s always tons of 
                    hot guys in Mammoth.  I d rather be 
                    single there anyway.    
                          (realizes something)
                    I mean, if anyone still wants to do 
                    the trip this year.

      Awkward beat as they all look at each other.                                                                                    33.


                                  BRAD
                    Yeah, we need to decide who s in.  
                    If we re gonna get a smaller house 
                    this time, we gotta get on that.

      Everyone looks to Alex/Dave, HOPEFUL.  They exchange a look.

                                  DAVE
                    Of course we re all in.  

      Alex SMILES/NODS.  Everyone SMILES, HAPPY.  Beat.  

                                  JANE
                      But...then do we actually need a 
                    bigger house though?  Cause... 
                    don t we need an extra room now?

                                  ALEX
                    Oh.  Yeah, I guess we do.

      Beat.  EVERYONE REALIZES THINGS HAVE CHANGED.  

                                  MAX
                    Why Al?  Are you gonna bring the 
                      rollerblade guy?
                          (off everyone s GLARES)
                    What?  Too soon?

      They all look to Dave, AWAITING his reaction.  Beat.  Then --

                                  DAVE
                      Well...he ll probably just show up 
                    at the last second.

      Everyone laughs, RELIEVED.  The weight is lifting...

                                  JANE
                    You should bring Jackie.  If she 
                    doesn t have too much homework.

                                  BRAD
                    Oh!  Le-no!

      Everyone LAUGHS HARD.  BRAD PUTS HIS ARM AROUND JANE -- SHE 
      SMILES.  Awkward beat.  What now...?  Penny checks her watch.  

                                  PENNY
                      Well...it s still my birthday for 
                    six more minutes.  Who needs a 
                    drink?  Alex, you re buying.

      Alex smiles/nods.  Dave puts his arm around Penny, KISSES HER 
      HEAD PLATONICALLY -- SHE SMILES UP AT HIM, BLUSHING WITH SECRET 
      LOVE.  They all walk back in.  CAMERA STAYS OUT ON THE WINDOW: 
      They belly up to the bar.  Max makes a joke.  They all LAUGH.

      END OF ACT THREE                                                                                    34.
