      FADE IN:

      EXT. STREET. DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO - DAY (D/1)11

      Morning.  Everyone s heading to work, ready or not.  On the 
      sidewalks a sea of corporate drones, tight-skirted 
      assistants, power-suited attorneys --

      And CARL RESNICK, late 20 s, a schlub with a please-don t-
      hurt-me air.  But today, a determined schlub, a schlub with a 
      mission.  He plows through the crowd dragging something heavy 
      -- maybe he s got a large suitcase, maybe his bike lost a 
      tire, we can t tell.  Carl s puffing a self-help mantra --

                                  CARL
                    ...Self isn t something you find, 
                    it s something you create.  The 
                    more action you take, the more 
                    progress you make...

      Mostly no one s paying attention to Carl -- he s that kind of 
      guy -- but one Woman scurries out of his way, does a 
      horrified double-take --

      But Carl s gone, lost in the crowd.

      INT. LOBBY. CBI HQ - DAY22

      JANE, CHO and LISBON in the shorter, cops-only security line, 
      suffering the usual pre-coffee office boredom.  A looooong 
      beat... Jane points to a Woman in a red dress in the civilian 
      line --

                                  JANE
                    Red dress.  Go.  Guess.

      A game they play sometimes.  Cho eyes the Woman carefully --

                                  CHO
                    She s... allergic to perfume?  
                          (off them; defensive)
                    It s a good guess.  She just 
                    sneezed.

                                  JANE
                    She s having an affair.  Next?

                                  LISBON
                    Hang on.  An affair?  You just made 
                    that up.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       2.
      CONTINUED:22

      Jane points to others in line in quick succession --

                                  JANE
                    Hiding a terminal illness, about to 
                    propose to her girlfriend, and... 
                    about to quit his job.  That or 
                    kill his boss.

                                  LISBON
                    Made.  Up.

                                  JANE
                    Not at all.  You see, the woman in 
                    the red dress has a peculiar --

      But we ll never know how Jane knew, because just then --

      ANGLE - NEAR THE BIG GLASS DOORS

      Carl Resnick pushes through the entrance doors, still 
      dragging something, making a ruckus, still determinedly 
      muttering self-help jargon --  

                                  CARL
                    My attitude toward life determines 
                    life s attitude toward me, got a 
                    job to do, ya gotta do it right...

      Whatever he s dragging gets stuck as the doors close.  He has 
      to yank it free.  Thunk, thunk.  

                                  LISBON (O.S.)
                    Stop!

      ANGLE - NEAR THE METAL DETECTORS

      Jane watches as Lisbon, Cho and a couple of other agents draw 
      their guns on Carl because --

                    Let me see your hands, NOW.

      There s a trail of smeared BLOOD behind Carl.  Leading up to 
      the thing he s dragging:  a knotted-up blanket with something 
      heavy in it.  An ARM has popped out.  It s a YOUNG WOMAN, 
      gunshot wound.  Carl blinks.  And oddly, laughs.

                                  CARL
                    Whoa!  Make a federal case out of 
                    it, why don t you?

      Jane eyeing this apparent madman with interest as --

      ANGLE - THE DOORS BEHIND JANE

      RIGSBY and VAN PELT quietly enter, guns drawn --

      To join Lisbon, Cho, and the other agents, their guns still 
      trained on Carl.  He holds the blanket end in one hand and 
      the other is suspiciously thrust in a pocket.  Jane watches, 
      intrigued, as the situation escalates --

                                  CHO
                    Drop it!  Drop the blanket --

                                  VAN PELT
                    -- Show us your hands, sir, we have 
                    to see your hands --

                                  RIGSBY
                    -- Show us your hands or we ll 
                    shoot.

                                  CARL
                    Wow, that s gratitude for you.

                                  LISBON
                    Put it down, let go now and put 
                    your hands above your head.

      A calm voice, controlled.  Lisbon inches forward, her eyes 
      never leaving Carl s hand in his pocket.  Carl is miffed.

                                  CARL
                    I bring you a gift and this is how 
                    I m treated?

                                  RIGSBY

      Jane clocks -- CARL S EYES (slightly red, pupils dilated), 
      CHEST (steady breathing).

                                  JANE
                    What gift?

                                  LISBON
                          (ignoring Jane)
                    Sir, you don t want to die today, 
                    do you?  Put your hands up, now.

                                  CARL
                    I dragged this for three blocks, 
                    Lady!  

      Now Carl s mad.  His hand making a fist in his pocket.  A 
      fist around a gun?... Proper procedure is to --

                                  RIGSBY
                          (softly)
                    Take the shot, Boss.  Take it...

                                  LISBON
                    Show me your damn hands.  Hands!

                                  CARL
                    A man stands up for himself.  I 
                    will not be walked all over!

      Carl takes a step forward, Lisbon has no choice but to fire --

      And Jane steps toward Carl.  From this angle, he s blocking 
      everyone s shot.

                                  LISBON
                    Jane!

      Jane examines Carl s face -- 

                                  JANE
                    Red eyes, dilated pupils -- you on 
                    drugs, Mr...?

                                  CARL
                    Resnick.  Carl Resnick. 
                          (insulted)
                    I don t do drugs.  Crack is wack.

                                  JANE
                    Hey.  Look over there.

      Carl looks where Jane points and Jane takes Carl s wrist.  
      Carl absently drops the blanket. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)  THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       5.

                    Steady pulse.  Rock steady after 
                    dragging a body three blocks.

                                  CARL
                          (turning back)
                    Huh?  Hey.

                                  LISBON
                    Jane, you need to move away.

                                  JANE
                    So Carl -- she s a gift?  That s 
                    why you brought her here to us?

                                  CARL
                    Her?  Them.

                                  JANE
                    There s more than one?

                                  CARL
                    It s a whole bagful, fella.  You 
                    need glasses?

      Jane eyes the woman s body, then Carl, puzzled.

                                  JANE
                    A bagful of what, exactly?

                                  CARL
                          (as to the impaired)
                    Potatoes.

                                  JANE
                    Potatoes.

                                  CARL
                    I m supposed to deliver them to the 
                    police.  You are police, right?

      Jane s tone is soothing.

                                  JANE
                    Near enough. 

      Jane waves his hand in front of Carl s face twice, quickly, 
      studying how his pupils react.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Hmmm, very good subject.

                    Given that the girl he dragged in 
                    here dead is not actually a bag of 
                    spuds like he says, yes.

                    It s not a lie if he believes it.

      INT. INTERROGATION. CBI HQ - SAME TIME66

      Carl is trying his best to help Cho.

                                  CHO
                    So, Carl.  Why would you bring a 
                    bag of potatoes to the police?

      Carl pauses.  He can t remember.  An embarrassed grin --

                                  CARL
                    Uh, I don t... I can t...

                    Potatoes to cops, potatoes.  Not 
                      doughnuts, but potatoes... Did 
                    someone tell you to do it?

                                  CARL

                                  JANE
                    Hypnosis is just a way to connect 
                    to the imagination rather than the 
                    conscious mind.  The mind will 
                    accept whatever the imagination 
                    creates, however bizarre.

                                  LISBON
                    Hypnosis is what you use -- against 
                    my explicit orders -- to get 
                    witnesses to tell the truth.  
                    That s a little different from 
                    getting someone to see a dead girl 
                    as a sack of vegetables.

                                  RIGSBY
                    But he doesn t look like he s in a

                                  JANE
                    Neither did Minelli, when I 
                      hypnotized him to stop smoking.  
                    A subject acts normally, except 
                    inside the suggestion.  Carl s 
                      suggestion was to have this very 
                    powerful hallucination.  And to 
                    forget who did it.  Whoever did 
                    this is very good, I must admit.

                                  LISBON
                    Good enough to hypnotize Carl into 
                    killing the girl?

      Jane is thoughtful.  

                                  JANE
                    Depends on whether Carl, deep down, 
                    wanted to kill the girl.  

                                  LISBON
                    But if he s hypnotized --

                                  JANE
                    -- No suggestion in the world can 
                    make you do something against your 
                    moral character, against your true 
                    will.  A hypnotized saint is still 
                    a saint.

                                  LISBON
                    So if Carl s a killer, he can be 
                      hypnotized to kill.  Otherwise...

                                  RIGSBY
                    Otherwise the hypnotist must have 
                    killed the girl and framed Carl for 
                    it.

                      Neuro-linguistic programming is not 
                    a scam.  It s the science of 
                    willpower and persuasion and 
                      communicating more deeply.  A way

      Prompted by APPLAUSE O.S., Jane opens the door and goes 
      inside...

      INT. AUDITORIUM. MODEL LIFE CENTRE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER1414

      JANE S POV:  Interested if not wild applause from the crowd 
      as a distinguished MAN, 50 s, professorial, walks out ON 
      STAGE.  Takes the mic with an almost zenlike air.  

      OUT OF POV as Jane, intrigued, enters the auditorium.  Lisbon 
      motions to Rigsby to watch Carl, then follows.

                                    DISTINGUISHED MAN 
                    Good afternoon.  My name is Dr.

                    And I m here to teach you the 
                    secrets of neuro-linguistic 
                      programming.  Some of you may not 
                    fully believe in the power of 
                    trance, but I promise -- you will.

      Lisbon s intrigued; some audience members nod significantly 
      to each other, knowing what s coming.  Behind the man, a 
      YOUNGER MAN walks out, 30 s, hipper clothes, charismatic.  

                                    DISTINGUISHED MAN (CONT D)
                    Excuse me, young man.  This is not 
                    the moment.  I m speaking. 

      Jane watches as the Younger Man leans into the Older Man, 
      briskly pats his hand twice.  Which apparently is a signal, 
      because --

      The Older Man blinks, coming out of his trance.  He stares at 
      the crowd, puzzled.

                    Where... Where am I?

      He eyes the Younger Man.

                    Dr. Daniel, what happened?

      An amazed GASP from the crowd, then applause.  Even Lisbon is 
      somewhat impressed.  The Younger Man -- DR. ROYSTON DANIEL -- 
      puts his arm around the Older Man as they face the audience.

                                  DANIEL
                    Ladies and gentlemen, give a round 
                    of applause to Mike here for being 
                    such a good sport.  As you may 
                    know, I am Dr. Royston Daniel.  

      The audience applauds enthusiastically.  Daniel grins.  He 
      got `em.  Jane goes down to the front.

                    Jane...

      Jane keeps going.  Lisbon sighs, but waits to see what he ll 
      do.  He  walks up the steps to the edge of the stage, and 
      beckons to Daniel.  Lisbon follows him down to the front.

                                  DANIEL 
                    Hello?

                    I d love a quick word in private if 
                    I may. 

      Daniel plays to the audience.

                                  DANIEL
                    I m kind of in the middle of 
                    something here.

      The audience thinks this is more of the routine and laughs.

                                  JANE 
                    It s important.  Your boat is on 
                    fire.

                                  DANIEL
                    My boat?  I don t have a boat.

                                  JANE
                    No, not any more.

      Daniel looks to RICK TIEGLER, 20 s, slick, in the front row.

                                  DANIEL 
                    Rick, page security, would you?
                          (tough, to Jane)
                    Sir, I don t know what your issue 
                    is but --

      Looking daggers at Jane, Lisbon moves him aside to show her 
      badge to Daniel.

                                  LISBON
                    Sir...

      Jane throws up his hands.

                                  JANE
                    All right, all right.  I was trying 
                    to avoid upsetting everybody.  Your 
                    assistant Mary Beth has been 
                    murdered. 

      Daniel looks stunned.  The audience gasps and murmurs.  
      Lisbon comes to the front and shows her badge.

                    to see you all again soon. 

      Daniel hands the mike to Rick, who is flustered, but recovers 
      fast.  Bounds up onstage as Daniel gets down offstage and 
      follows Jane and Lisbon out of the auditorium.

                                  RICK
                          (to audience)
                    Wow.  Well, as Dr. Daniel showed 
                    you, trance is incredibly powerful.  
                    And we re going to teach you how to 
                    unleash that power for yourselves.  

      The audience rustles with interest.

                    Let s start by relaxing with a few 
                    simple breathing exercises, then 
                    I ll show you how to supercharge 
                    your life.  How s that sound?

      The audience thinks that sounds good.

      INT. FOYER - MODEL LIFE CENTRE - DAY1515

      Jane, Lisbon and Daniel emerge from the auditorium and join 
      Carl and Rigsby.  Daniel shows no recognition of Carl.  

                                  CARL
                          (sheepish)

      INT. DR. DANIEL S OFFICE. MODEL LIFE CENTRE - DAY1616

      Opulent but tasteful.  Dr. Daniel with Rigsby and Jane.  
      Daniel is trying to hide his upset.

                                  DANIEL
                    This is terrible.  Poor kid.  I had 
                    a bad feeling -- when I couldn t 
                    reach her last night.  Not like her 
                    to disappear.

                    She have problems with anyone 
                    lately?  Bad breakup, anyone who 
                    might want to hurt her?

                      I wouldn t know.  Mary Beth s  
                    personal life was her own.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    She was brought to us by Carl 
                    Resnick out there.  He was 
                      hypnotized to think she was a big 
                    old bag of potatoes.  

      Daniel is impressed.

                    Oh, very few people have the talent 
                    to create a trance that powerful.  
                    Very few.

                                  JANE

      A standoff, two alphas locking horns.  Rigsby breaks through 
      the tension.

                    Dr. Daniel, how about you tell me

                    Royston, I have those files you

                    seminar in San Francisco.  

      Lindsay Hendrix is at the door.  Daniel is surprised.

                    What?

      She seems a little lost.  Daniel uses a gentle tone to mask 
      the harsh words.

      A beat.  Lindsay s emotional, embarrassed.

                    Sorry... Sorry... You re right, 
                    this was a bad idea... Sorry...

      Lindsay exits, tearful.  Jane is admiring.

                     Take care of you.   That s the

      INT. AUDITORIUM. MODEL LIFE CENTRE - DAY1717

      Lisbon and Carl seated in the back of the auditorium 
      listening to Rick Tiegler in mid spiel.  Carl is watching 
      Tiegler like a hawk, but then so is Lisbon...

                                  RICK
                    Are you feeling it?  Are you all 
                    feeling it?

      All in the audience say or at least murmur  YES.   Lisbon 
      almost does, but stops herself.  

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    Good, good.  Now I m going to talk 
                    to you individually, and invite one 
                    or two of you to come and help me 
                    up onstage.  Will you do that?  
                    Will you help me if I ask you? 

      Again all in the audience say  Yes.  

      Rick gets down off the stage and prowls up the aisle, looking 
      for good soft targets.  He starts in a alarm when he sees 
      Carl in back.

                                  RICK (CONT D)
                    Wh -- why are you --?

                                  CARL
                    What do you want me to do here?

      Too late, Tiegler realizes that the woman next to Carl is a 
      cop.  Lisbon eyes Carl, sees his mesmerized expression, looks 
      back to Tiegler, suspicion in her eyes...

                                  RICK 
                          (smiles at Carl)
                    Oh, sorry, I thought you were 
                    someone else...

      Tiegler tries to move on...

                                  LISBON
                    Hang on a minute, sir...

                                  RICK
                    Kinda busy right now.

      Lisbon stands up.  Tiegler runs to the door.  Lisbon quickly 
      cuffs Carl s handcuffs to his chair and sprints after 
      Tiegler.

                                  LISBON
                    Stop!

      INT. NEAR FOYER - MODEL LIFE CENTRE - CONTINUOUS1818

      BOOM!  Lisbon and Tiegler come tumbling through the 
      auditorium doors, pound toward the grand stairway.  Like an 
      expert calf roper, Lisbon swiftly subdues Tiegler --

      Just as Jane comes down the stairs.

                                  JANE 
                    You didn t like the class?

                    I think we found our mystery 
                      hypnotist.

      She handcuffs Tiegler (with a second set of handcuffs).    
      Jane smiles at Tiegler on the ground...

                                  JANE
                    What do you know, I got what I want 
                    from who I want.  This NLP stuff 
                    really works.

      Off his smile --

                    something happened when you were 
                    drunk, that means you had

                    gun in my hand, I could smell the

      Late afternoon shadows.  At the big table, Rigsby and Carl 
      sit near each other.  Lisbon pops her head in just as a  *
      Teacher exits.  Rigsby s just scribbling a final note -- *

                    Tiegler s place yet? *

      Lisbon plops into the seat next to Rigsby.  (NOTE:  During 
      the following, Rigsby will be mirroring Lisbon s movements -- 
      the way she sits, crosses her legs, touches her face, etc.)

      She crosses her legs.  Rigsby follows suit.

                    Couple more teachers to go.  So 
                    far, nobody knows much about

                    What?  Nothing.

      She sits back.  Rigsby sits back.

                    works at all.

      Carl smiles, and as we ll remember later, snaps his fingers 
    and points at Rigsby.

                                  CARL
                    You will.

      And he exits.  Another Teacher enters and Rigsby starts the

      INT. BULLPEN. CBI HQ - DAY (D/2)2222

      Cho takes a pizza box around to Lisbon, Van Pelt and Jane.  
      Lisbon and Van Pelt take a slice.  Jane refuses, troubled by 
      something. 

                                  JANE
                    No thanks.

                                  CHO
                    You have to.

                                  VAN PELT
                    It s tradition.  The case is 
                    closed.

                                  JANE
                    Hmmm.

                    Hmmm?  There s no hmmm here.  An 
                    hour ago we found the gun that 
                    killed Mary Beth, in Tiegler s 
                      apartment, with Tiegler s prints.  

                                  CHO
                    Plus, you know, the confession.  

      Van Pelt does a victory fist-bump with Cho without looking up 
      from her pizza.

                    Rick Tiegler s black-out.  Didn t 
                    strike you as odd?

      Rigsby approaches (we see Carl exit in the b.g.) --

                                  RIGSBY
                    He got drunk, he blacked out, killed 
                    somebody.  Who hasn t been there?  
                          (off them)
                    Kidding.

                                  JANE
                    Tiegler came out of a drunken 
                    stupor standing upright over a body 
                    instead of lying facedown in a pool 
                    of vomit?  Almost sounds more like 
                    a trance than a blackout.

                                  CHO
                    Somebody hypnotized Tiegler into 
                    killing Mary Beth and hypnotizing 
                    Carl.  

                                  JANE
                    Something like that.

                                  LISBON
                    I didn t eat all this cheese and 
                    grease for nothing.  The case is

                       suggestion  everywhere, Jane. 
                          (teasing)
                    You re too suggestible.

                                  JANE
                    Ha ha.  

                                  LISBON
                    Oh, right, too much of a control 
                    freak for that.

                    Pot?  Meet kettle.  Kettle?  Pot.

      But Lisbon hears him, gives him a hard look.  Just then 
      Lindsay Hendrix enters, timid.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Um, hi, Agent Lisbon.  I m here for my

                    Sure.  Agent Rigsby will help you. 

      Rigsby, about to take a huge bite of pizza, puts it down, 
      gravely disappointed.  Lindsay turns to go with Rigsby.  Jane 
      calls after her.

                                  JANE
                    Ms. Hendrix.  A question: do you believe 
                    Rick Tiegler killed your sister?

                                  LISBON
                    Jane.

      But Lindsay turns, puzzlement and relief mixed.

                                    LINDSAY
                      Actually... I kind of don t.  I was 
                    going to talk to you about it. 
                    How did you know?

      Lisbon doesn t want Jane to have quite such a swift victory.  
      She steers Lindsay away --

                    Well, there s no way he broke in.

                    She and Dr. Daniel were a couple.

                    You re ambitious, more than you ll 
                    let anyone see.  A girl from 
                      Nowheresville desperate to make it 
                    big.  But you worry you ll always 
                    be small-town, small-time, that you

                    why you re so shut down to 
                      everything but your job.

      He looks to see if he s hurt her.  She holds him with a look.

                    Dr. Daniel?  No offense.  But I ve 
                    been working with Patrick Jane for 
                    nine months.  You want to get under

      Damn.  As Daniel gives her an admiring look, they re out.

      INT. OBSERVATION. CBI HQ - DAY2626

      Rigsby, Jane and Van Pelt watch as IN OBSERVATION, Cho 
      questions Dr. Daniel.  As Lisbon enters the room --THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       31.

      Cho and Dr. Daniel.  Daniel is calm, collected.  A resonant 
      voice, charismatic.

                                  DANIEL
                    I ll tell you again, Agent Cho.  I

                    Then she s lying or misled somehow. 

                                  CHO
                    You didn t take Mary Beth to Maui?

                    Maybe he s telling the truth.  Maybe 
                    it s Lindsay Hendrix who s lying.

                                  JANE

      Rigsby exits.  The others are a little puzzled.

      Cho is solemn.  Disappointed.

                                  CHO
                    I think that s not true, Doctor.

                    courtesy.  If there s nothing new,

      Rigsby enters.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Hey, Cho, may I?  

      Cho s puzzled too, but hey, it s Rigsby.

                                  CHO
                    Uh, sure.

                                  DANIEL
                    I d like to go now.

      Without warning, Rigsby smashes Daniel s face into the table.  
      Turning his nose to bloody pulp.  Oddly, Rigsby s voice is 
      calm, reasonable, like nothing s happened --

                                  RIGSBY

      Cho rushes to Rigsby as Jane, Van Pelt and Lisbon rush in.

                    All right!  All right!  We were

      Cho and Lisbon wrestle Rigsby away.  But he offers no 
      resistance.  A satisfied grin on his face.

                    Now that feels better, doesn t it?

      Van Pelt stares at the nonchalant Rigsby, horrified.  Daniel 
      grips his bloody nose, moaning.

                    You broke my nose!  You crazy 
                      bastard!...

      Jane eyes Rigsby s face as Lisbon hisses in Rigsby s ear --

                    Agent Rigsby, step outside.

      Jane, Lisbon, Van Pelt with Rigsby.  (Cho is Interrogation

      Jane waves his hand in front of the Rigsby, just as he did 
      with Carl in Act One.  Lisbon remembers it, too.

      INT. BULLPEN. CBI HQ - DAY (D/2 CONT D)3232

      The gang follows Rigsby toward his desk.  Rigsby is skeptical 
      but mightily amused.  (Note:  he no longer has a sidearm.)

                                  RIGSBY

      Jane and a worried Lisbon step aside into the HALLWAY...

                                  LISBON
                    Could this be something 
                      psychological?  A psychotic break 
                    or something?

                                  JANE
                    No.  Hypnosis, that s all.

                                  JANE
                    Rigsby has a brutal streak.  If you

      Rigsby rises from his chair, goes to Van Pelt, takes her in 
      his arms, and gives her the longest and sexiest kiss in the 
      history of CBS television.

      Lisbon shakes her head.  Rigsby and Van Pelt come up for air.  
      Van Pelt is upset, embarrassed and aroused all at once, and 
      takes a beat before wrenching herself away.  

                                  LISBON
                    Okay, he s hypnotized.

                    Are you sure?  

      Van Pelt punches Jane on the shoulder.

                    Do it.

                    I can t.  The hypnotist used a 
                    specific trigger to induce trance.

                    Rigsby didn t talk to Tiegler, did

                    Nope.

                                  LISBON
                    So Tiegler didn t do this.
                    Maybe Tiegler didn t kill Mary Beth 
                    either. 
                          (eyes Jane)
                    Looks like you were right.  Rick 
                    Tiegler was put in a trance by the 
                    real killer and just thought he 
                    blacked out.

                                  CHO
                    And the same person put Rigsby

                    Has to be Dr. Daniel, right?  He s

                    this.

                    My guess, that punch was the

                      hypnotized by the person who killed 
                    Mary Beth.

      A beat.  Tiegler bursts out laughing.

                    I have to get out of here.

      He shoves Jane, hard.

      He takes off.

                    Wayne!  Stop!

      She starts to run after him, but Jane stops her.

                                  JANE
                    He s in too deep.  He might hurt 
                    you if you try and stop him.

      Rigsby is already across the street, tossing a last glance 
      over his shoulder as he dodges between HONKING cars to get to 
      wherever the hell he s going...

      Dark, empty, spooky.  The doors open... It s Rigsby.  Looking 
      for someone...

      INT. DR. DANIEL S OFFICE. MODEL LIFE CENTRE - NIGHT3535

      Dr. Daniel (black eye, bandaged nose) sits behinds his desk.  
      Rigsby enters.  (Note:  Rigsby seems normal in tone and 
      attitude.  And everything he does seems reasonable to him.)

                                  RIGSBY
                    Hullo, Dr. Daniel.

                                  DANIEL
                    Agent Rigsby?  Thank God you re

                    Oh, shut up, Royston.

      Lindsay Hendrix steps from the corner, her gun trained on 
      Daniel.  Now we see Daniel is handcuffed to the chair.  
      Lindsay s tone to Rigsby is gentle, vulnerable (and she s 
      using it to reinforce Rigsby s trance).

                                    LINDSAY (CONT D)
                    Thank you, Wayne.  Thanks for

                    I had to come.

      Rigsby sits down next to Lindsay.

                    Royston wouldn t hurt Mary Beth, if 
                    that s what you re thinking.  Not 
                    in a million years.  He loved her.

                    This is just routine.  Relax, we ll 
                    be done in no time.

      CLOSE ON:  Lindsay s hand as it touches Rigsby s shoulder 
      once, quickly.  (This is the trigger.)  Then she leaves her 
      hand on his arm.  Establishing rapport.  Matching Rigsby s 
      breathing, his blinking...

                                    LINDSAY
                    I will, I ll relax.  I feel safe 
                    with you, Wayne.  Very safe.

      HER EYES seem kind.  Rigsby has to lean close to hear her low 
      voice.  Her voice is alive with inflection now --

                                    LINDSAY (CONT D)
                    I feel safe and relaxed, very

                    all.  Let me tell you about Dr.

      Lindsay takes his other hand in hers.  Rigsby doesn t resist.  
      Off him --

      A RIIIIIIP! SOUND and then a piece of duct tape is plastered

      EXT. ROOF. MODEL LIFE CENTRE - NIGHT3939

      A dark night, city lights are far away.  The big  LIFE  sign 
      glows in the BG.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       45.

      Lindsay and Rigsby drag Daniel, still handcuffed to the 
      chair, across the flat roof.  Lindsay glares at Daniel.

                                    LINDSAY
                    I was in love with you, you 
                    arrogant bastard.  Like I ve never 
                    loved anyone.  But you only wanted 
                    Mary Beth.  That cow.  I thought if 
                    she were gone, you would finally 
                    see me, and love me for who I am. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    But you were in San Francisco when 
                    Mary Beth was murdered.

                                    LINDSAY
                    They have these things called 
                    rental cars.  I drove up here, did 
                    the deed, hypnotized that skeeze-
                    bag Rick to take the blame, then 
                    got back just in time to catch my 
                    flight.  Got off that plane here 
                    thinking finally Royston and I can 
                    be together.  Finally he ll really 
                    see me.  And the gifts I have.

                                  RIGSBY
                    But he didn t see you.
                          (quietly)
                    It s hard, when they don t see you.

                                    LINDSAY
                          (bitter; to Daniel)
                    What a moron I was.  When I came to 
                    you, you said,   It s not 
                      important.  We ll do fine without 
                    you.  Go home.   And in that moment 
                    I knew -- you d never love me.  
                    Never.  So now you re going to die.

      Daniel  mmmph! s in protest.  Lindsay turns to Rigsby, 
      vulnerable eyes --

                                    LINDSAY (CONT D)
                    He hurt me, Rigsby.  He hurt me.

      Rigsby frowns, and BAM, socks Daniel across the jaw so hard 
      he knocks the chair over.  Daniel hits the deck, unconscious.

      Lindsay faces Rigsby and touches his shoulder once, quickly -- 
      the trigger -- then holds his hands, re-establishing rapport, 
      anchoring him in a trance state.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       46.

                                    LINDSAY
                    Well, now I need your protection, 
                    Wayne.  Your help with a special

                    Hello, Rigsby.  Hey, is that Venus 
                    up there, or Mercury?

      Rigsby turns, startled.  It s Jane, smiling cheerfully.  
      Lindsay aims the gun and he raises his hands.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Hansel and Gretel used bread 
                    crumbs, we had Rigsby.  

      Jane holds up his cellphone, shows her a GPS readout.

                    I knew Rigsby would lead us to the 
                    guilty one.  So we put a tracking 
                    device in his pocket. 

                                    LINDSAY
                    Smart.  Except for the part where I 
                    have a gun.  

                                  JANE
                    Oh, I have a gun, too.  Lisbon?

      Lisbon emerges from darkness and levels a gun at Lindsay.

                                  LISBON
                    Drop the weapon, Lindsay.

                    So predictable.  Rick!

      Rick Tiegler appears behind Lisbon, aiming a SHOTGUN at her 
      head.

                                  RICK
                    You should put the gun down, ma am.

                    I am impressed, Lindsay.  There 
                    aren t three people in the world 
                    who could have done an induction on 
                    a cop.  But Rigsby s guard was up 
                    when he was with Dr. Daniel and 
                    Carl.  You, however, slipped right 
                    in, you bad little mouse.

                                    LINDSAY
                    I was never the sparkling, 
                    vivacious one.  That was Mary Beth.  
                    All the boys loved her.  Never me. 
                    But when I started working for Dr. 
                    Daniel, I realized I had a talent 
                    to reach people s unconscious.  
                    People trust me.  They let down 
                    their defenses.  Finally I was 
                    worth something.  Finally I was in 
                    control.

                                  JANE
                    Look around you.  Are you in 
                    control now?  Everybody here, you 
                    have to kill.  That s madness.  
                    That s not control.  You re having 
                    a nervous breakdown, Lindsay.  You 
                    need help.  We can help you. 

      This last said with tremendous confidence Jane doesn t feel.  
      A beat, is Lindsay wavering?...

                                  LISBON
                      Rigsby!...

      But Rigsby shoves Daniel near the edge and firmly takes 
      Jane s arm.  Lisbon starts forward, but stops when Tiegler 
      brandishes the shotgun.

                                  RIGSBY
                    C mon, Jane, let s go swimming, 
                    man.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       49.

                                  JANE
                    Rigsby, it s not water down there, 
                    it s cement.

      Rigsby and Jane approach the building s edge.  He pauses...

                                    LINDSAY
                    The water s gorgeous, isn t it?  
                    Mr. Jane loves the water just like 
                    you do.  

                                  JANE
                    Rigsby, don t!

                                    LINDSAY
                    Go ahead.  Let him go for a swim.  
                    Help him in, then help Royston.  
                    The water is so warm, healing...

      Rigsby prepares to push Jane over the edge... Jane points 
      urgently.

                                  JANE
                    Sharks!  Right there!  Look!    

      Rigsby pauses and looks.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    There!  See that?  There s great 
                    whites down there.  Tear your arm 
                    off soon as look at you.

                                  RIGSBY
                          (confused)
                    Sharks?  Where, dude?

                                    LINDSAY
                    There s no sharks, they re all 
                    gone.  They re gone, Wayne.  You 
                    can go in the water now...

                                  JANE
                    No, she s lying.  She wants you to 
                    get eaten.  Who is this woman?  

      Rigsby hesitates.  Lindsay waves her gun at Jane to shut him 
      up, moves closer, impatient --

                                    LINDSAY
                    Just get in the damn water!  Throw 
                    Jane in the water!




                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       50.
      CONTINUED: (6)3939

      And she starts to grab Rigsby by the shoulder and spin him 
      around, but suddenly moves her hand, clumsily clutching his 
      arm instead.  An odd, clumsy move.  Jane s eyes narrow.

                                  JANE
                    Why not touch his shoulder, 
                    Lindsay?

                                    LINDSAY
                          (to Rigsby)
                    Throw Jane in the water!  Do it!

                                  JANE
                    Don t bother.

      And he briskly taps Rigsby on the shoulder.  The trigger.  
      It s enough to interrupt the trance state.  Jane leans close 
      to Rigsby s ear, commanding --

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Wake up.

                                    LINDSAY
                    No, Rigsby --

      But Rigsby turns, sees Lindsay with the --

                                  RIGSBY
                    Gun!

      Instinctively he knocks the gun out of her hand and kicks her 
      legs out from under her in one smooth motion.  

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  Gun.  Thank you, Rigsby.

      Without Lindsay to command him, Tiegler just stands there 
      with the shotgun, perplexed.  Lisbon snatches the gun from 
      him, and cuffs him.  Meanwhile...

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    You ve been in a trance state. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Get out of here.

                                  JANE
                    Lindsay killed her sister to get to 
                    Daniel.  When Daniel spurned her, 
                    she tried to make you kill him.  
                    And have it look like you both died 
                    during an attempted arrest.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       51.

                                  RIGSBY
                      Seriously, get out of here.

      Lisbon goes to Lindsay sitting disconsolately on the ground.      

                                  LISBON
                    Lindsay Hendrix, you are under 
                    arrest for the murder of Mary Beth 
                    Hendrix and the kidnapping of 
                    Royston Daniel...

      Lisbon starts handcuffing her.  Jane is happy to be alive.  
      Off him --

                                                                            FADE TO:

      INT. BULLPEN. CBI HQ - DAY (D/3)4040

      Rigsby and Cho walk away from their desks.  Rigsby s modest 
      but pleased.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    ...I don t know, I just suddenly 
                    came out of it.  I knew I had to 
                    take her down.  Bam. 

      They go to...

      INT. KITCHEN CBI HQ - CONTINUOUS4141

      At a table, Jane is enjoying some tea.  Lisbon is fixing her 
      fourth coffee.  Van Pelt is burrowing in the fridge when 
      Rigsby and Cho enter.  

                                  CHO
                    Yes, you  took down  a 100-pound 
                    woman, but in that context, you did 
                    good. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    What d you mean, in that context?

                                  LISBON
                    Oh, in the context of someone who 
                    let himself get hypnotized and 
                    nearly threw his colleague off a 
                    building, and finally managed to 
                    overpower a small crazy woman to 
                    retrieve the situation, you did 
                    good.  

      She smiles to take the sting out of it.  Rigsby knows he s 
      owed a ribbing, so he s good-natured about it.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)THE MENTALIST       "Russet Potatoes"       GRAY 3/13/09       52.

                    Be fair, a small crazy woman with a 
                    gun.  A gun is a gun.   

                                  JANE
                    And anyone can be hypnotized.  And 
                    she was extremely good.  Better 
                    than, well no, not better than me, 
                    but close.  Close-ish.

                          (hands Rigsby his gun)
                    Which is why the Professional 
                    Standards Unit cleared you for 
                      assaulting Dr. Daniel.  You weren t 
                    yourself.  
                          (to Jane)
                    But he is now, right?  Himself?  
                      Completely unprogrammed.

                                  JANE
                    Yes, he is. 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Last two days are gone, but other 
                    than that I m good to go...

                                  VAN PELT
                    Oh.  So you don t remember anything 
                    from when you were hypnotized?

                                  RIGSBY
                    You know, fragments, but not 
                    really.  Thank goodness, right?  

                                  VAN PELT
                    Yeah.

      Mixed emotions in the  yeah.   Rigsby laughs, not noticing.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Oh lord, did I make a fool of 
                    myself?  Cluck like a chicken?
                          (beat)
                    I didn t do Tina Turner, did I?

      Lisbon and Jane exchange a look with Cho.  Van Pelt gives 
      them a warning glare.

                                  VAN PELT
                    No.  You were perfectly normal.

                    Well, good.  That s a relief.

      She moves off.  Rigsby studiously avoids watching her go.  

                                  JANE

      Cho exits.  Lisbon follows.

                    Remember what?

      Jane rests a hand on his shoulder.
