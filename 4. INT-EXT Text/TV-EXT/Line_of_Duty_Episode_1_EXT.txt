        BRACKLEY SPOV:

      In a bedroom doorway a young Muslim man (KARIM ALI, 20s) 
      stands with his back to Brackley spov, tightening thick 
      black straps that run over his shoulders and loop round his 
      back and waist.

      They look very wary but all it takes is a nod from Brackley. 

      They detonate the plastic explosive. The door blows off its 
      hinges.

        Brackleyleads the squad through a curtain of smoke. The 
      smoke shows us the red laser target beams from their weapons.

      Red laser dots mottle Karim s head. The squad squeeze their 
      triggers just as Karim turns in terror --

      -- revealing a baby strapped to his front -- 

      -- the straps are a baby sling. 

      But it s too late for Brackley-- he s already pulled the 
      trigger. Karim drops, blood spatters against the back window 
      and the glass shatters. Karim s wife screams and she appears 
      from out of view -- AALIYAH, Asian, 20s-- but the police 
      start to cable-tie her hands behind her back.

      The squad are stunned, paralyzed. Aaliyah is screaming. The 
      baby -- unhurt but splattered with its father s blood -- is 
      crying. And Karim is dead, blood leaking from what s left of 
      his head all over the cheap carpet. There are shouts from 
      outside -- alarmed residents panicking.

        Brackleyshakes, hyperventilating while other members of the

      lights flashing. A uniformed Traffic officer takes a 
      statement from a distressed late-middle-aged middle-class 
      woman holding a dog on a lead; a female Traffic Officer, PC 
      Powers, approaches Gates.

                    There was a Range Rover abandoned 
                    in a lay-by about half a mile down 
                    the road. The owner reported it 
                      stolen last night. Signs at the 
                      property suggest they put a rod 
                      through the window to fish up the 
                    keys.

                    We got a tip-off it might be 
                      connected to one of our

                    Is it?

      Gates hasn t made up his mind yet.

                                                                              CUT TO:



      Traffic whips by on a busy dual carriageway. Gates s car 
      pulls up behind Jackie s parked roadster. She gets out as he 
      does. He pulls her quickly away from the road, into the 
      shadows.

                                    GATES
                    What the hell are you playing at?

                                    JACKIE
                    The woman seemed so convinced. She 
                    made it impossible to change the 
                      story.

                                    GATES
                    You don t change, do you? Look 
                    after number one. Wreck my life and 
                    leave me to pick up the pieces. 
                    Same old Jackie, played me for a 
                    mug.

                                    JACKIE
                    No, Tony, no. I ll fix it. I ll 
                    find a way. 

                                    GATES
                    What, like today?

      He pushes her off and heads back towards his car.

                                    JACKIE
                    I ll take the blame. I ll go to 
                      prison if that s what you want.

      The last line hits him, makes him pull up.

      We keep looking at them on a long lens from the other side of 
      the road, as traffic speeds in between, two people who care 
      about each other but caught up in a terrible dilemma. They 
      want to move towards each other, then apart, their conflicts 
      playing out.

      Arnott and Hastings head into a busy city centre station.

      Arnott and Hastings stroll into reception. Straight ahead is 
      public access to a secure desk; to the right is police access 
      to a security entrance.

      Hastings  phone rings.

                        Superintendent Hastings.

      Hastings steps back out to take the call. A fraction of a 
      second later, Fleming comes out of the police door. 

      Arnott checks her out.

                                    ARNOTT

                    Okay. 

      Fleming leads him towards the police access door.

      She tries her fob but it doesn t work first time.

                                    FLEMING
                    They said they were getting this 
                      fixed.

      She tries the fob again and this time the door releases.

      From his parked car, Arnott watches Gates pull up. Arnott 
      gets out. Gates wants nothing to do with him. He walks 
      briskly through the car park with Arnott in pursuit.

                                    ARNOTT
                    Wait, sir, listen.

                      I can t believe you re stuck-on for 
                    this. 

      That makes Gates pause.

                                    ARNOTT
                      Hastings gives a toss about you

                      don t. I just want to make the 
                      yellow notice go away so we can 
                    both get on with investigating real 
                      crime.

      The lighter touch convinces Gates. He warms up.

                    Why didn t you log the gratuity,

      Arnott nods. 

      Gates nods briskly in return then hurries into the station. 
      Arnott contemplates his bargain with some trepidation.

      Loyal and professional, both Cottan and Morton give nods of

      Kapoor points away from the bar and Fleming follows his 
      finger to Gates, Morton and Cottan. They make room for her

      She takes one half, and the boys make a noise of being 
        underwhelmed. She takes the second, one in each fist, and the 
      boys give her due acknowledgement.

      Meanwhile Gates sticks a yellow Post-it note on his forehead.

      Hastings and Arnott emerge onto the roof. A figure framed

                    All this just to bring down Gates?

      THAT NIGHT. NIGHT 7. 

      This is the red-light area -- pretty run-down, women on the 
      streets, cars kerb-crawling.

      A drug dealer we ll meet again later -- WESLEY DUKE (20s) -- 
      slips one of the street-walkers a wrap of crack in exchange 
      for a few fivers. The girl has the starved, anaemic look of a 
      junkie.

      In an unmarked car, Cottan snaps a photo on a very long lens, 
      Morton at his side watching through binoculars.

                                                                              CUT TO:

      LONG LENS PHOTO MONTAGE:

      Wesley goes up to the door of a little semi-detached house in 
      a rundown street, carrying an empty rucksack. The door opens, 
      Wesley goes in.

      Wesley comes out, rucksack full.

                    big fat rucksack full of crack

                    back to this address --

      Further pictures repeat the images of Wesley at the semi; in 
      the doorway are two figures who are almost impossible to make 
      out except they re dark-skinned and wear hoodies.

                    new, large-scale supply he s tapped 
                    into. Next stage would be to pick 
                    up Wesley and turn him.

                    What if he blabs? We don t want to 
                    alert the Green Lane mob to us 
                      watching them.

                                    GATES
                      I agree. Keep up the surveillance 
                    for now. Let s see who else comes 
                    and goes from this address.
                          (To Morton.)
                    Tah, Nige.

      Morton starts to turn off the visual aids.

                                    GATES
                    Leave them, Nige.

      The team disperses but Gates remains in the room, troubled, 
      pensive. He keys the remote control and goes back to the only 
      image that shows the shadowy figures in the doorway of the 
      semi. Fleming is last to exit.

                                    GATES
                    Oh, Fleming, I ll talk to the Fifth

                      Thanks, sir. I won t let you down.

      Exit Fleming. Gates glances at the photos again, intrigued by 
      these new kids on the block.

                                                                              CUT TO:

                       Pulling us off.  Best I got at 
                      Hillside Lane was a pint after 
                    work.

      They both laugh hard. Cottan guns the engine.

                                    KAPOOR
                      Shouldn t we wait for the next

      Crime scene tape cordons off the house. A crowd of scraggy 
      locals -- adults, teenagers and kids - stand around gawping. 
      Forensic Scene Investigators comb the scene. Gates arrives,

                    Move the pond life further away and

                    to school, the ones who aren t 
                      excluded.

      Gates slips covers over his shoes and then walks in through 
      the front door of No. 161.

      In the hallway, well back from the living room, are Morton, 
      Cottan and Fleming, covers over their clothes.

                      Morning, boss.

      Gates doesn t answer, peers into the living room grimly -- 
      two dead Asian men, tied to chairs, dead from multiple stab 
      wounds. There s a lot of blood. Both men have had all their 
      fingers cut off, which lie on the carpet round them, being 
      bagged one by one by FSI sin white suits.

      Cottan looks very, very sheepish.

                                    COTTAN
                    Tone, I don t know what to say,

                      Later, Dot, alright.

      Cottan nods, hangs his head sheepishly.

                                    FLEMING
                    From the blood spatter both men 
                    were alive when the fingers were 
                      amputated. Looks like whoever 
                      killed them wanted to know 
                      something, and didn t find out.

                                    GATES
                    The finger amputations are clean. 
                    Each one done with a single stroke. 
                    Most likely with a bolt-cutter. 
                    Dot, go through the files back at 
                    the station, see if there s a
