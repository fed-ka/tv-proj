      It s a Midwestern town of Friday night football and the 4H 
      club, Applebee s and Wal-Mart.  But we find ourselves at an 
      outdated stucco motel that sits nestled along a bad ass 
      stretch of bars, cheap apartment buildings, used car lots, 
      and liquor stores off Highway 80 outside Davis, California.  
      ANGLE ON: A POLICE CRUISER skids to a stop in the parking 
      lot.  Davis County Police Officer, SAM BLAKELY (22), climbs 
      out of his vehicle as the frazzled motel MANAGER approaches.

                                    MANAGER
                    There was screaming, then gunshots.  
                    Upstairs.  Room 222.


      The Manager peers around a corner, watching Sam Blakely climb 
      the stairs, pulling his gun as he nears the room.  He 
      hesitates.  Looks terrified.  He bangs on the door.

                                  SAM BLAKELY
                    POLICE!  OPEN UP!

      Nothing.  Sam tests the door.  Unlocked.  He opens it 
      carefully.  Lights are off.  Shades drawn.  In the shadows, 
      TWO BODIES, a man and a young woman, brutally shot to death, 
      lying in a pool of blood.  


      JANE, LISBON, VAN PELT and MINELLI climb the motel stairs to 
      Room 222, entering past UNIFORM COPS on the door.

                                    MINELLI
                    We have a young female, Patrice 
                    Matigan, and Joseph Purcell, who 
                    was going to be the star witness in 
                      California Versus Carris...


      Jane scans the motel s forecourt and the street, and the back 
      alley behind the place.  Lisbon steps out.

                                  VAN PELT
                    What are you looking for?

                                  JANE
                    The girl had her keys in her hand.  
                    She was only planning on stopping 
                    by.

      Jane sees what he s looking for and hurries away.  Minelli 
      exits Room 222 in time to look puzzled again, as Lisbon and 
      Van Pelt follow Jane.


      Jane crosses the lot to an early nineties hatchback.        
      He opens the door with Patrice s key.

      There s a pack of diapers on the front passenger seat, which 
      he folds forward to reveal, strapped into her carseat -- a 
      BABY GIRL OF ABOUT SEVEN MONTHS OLD.  She smiles and gurgles 
      happily at sight of Jane. 


                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      Jane holding the baby girl.  Van Pelt trying to make her 
      smile.  Lisbon and a SOCIAL SERVICES LADY waiting.  In BG a 
      pair of PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES confer with Minelli.  

                                  JANE
                    What happens to her?

                                  LISBON 
                    Social Services has foster moms who 
                      specialize in babies.  She ll be 
                    okay until they find Patrice s 
                    family.   

                                  JANE
                    If she has family.

      Van Pelt looks to Lisbon at this.

                                  LISBON
                    Yes.

        Reluctantly, Jane hands the baby to the Social Services lady.   
      Everyone stops to watch the baby be taken away, crying as she 
      goes. 

      Also watching the baby go is Minelli, accompanied by  
      DETECTIVE BLAKELY and DETECTIVE PRECIADO of the Davis PD.  
      (Both 40 s), Blakely is a big, sad, bullish man.  Preciado, 
      an intense skinny triathlete type.  Both in classic cop 
      business suits.   

      They approach Jane, Lisbon and Van Pelt. 

                                    MINELLI
                    Lisbon, Jane, Van Pelt, Detectives 
                    Blakely and Preciado, Davis

                    with the Davis PD.  I speak for 
                    myself and your Chief when I urge 
                    you to work harmoniously.   

      Nods and appraising glances all around.

                                    MINELLI (CONT D)
                    Keep me posted.

      Minelli gets in the passenger seat of his car and is driven 
      away.

                                  JANE
                    Blakely s your name?  The first 
                    responder was a Blakely.

                                    BLAKELY

                    Poor kid.  First time coming up on 
                    a body.  Puked his guts up later.

                                    BLAKELY
                          (dismissing the subject)
                    He ll be okay.  Listen, just so 
                    we re clear.  You can call us 
                    liaisons if you like, but this is a 
                    Davis PD case.  Our narcotics unit 
                    has been trying to bust Rick Carris 
                    for years. 

      Lisbon ignores Blakely s rudeness, seeking harmony.

                                  LISBON
                      I appreciate your position. 
                    Has anyone checked the liquor store 
                    there?  For security cameras?     

      QUICK ANGLE ON - A LIQUOR STORE near the entrance to the 
      motel.

                                  PRECIADO
                    Not yet.

      Lisbon nods to Van Pelt.

                                  VAN PELT
                    I ll get on it. 

      Van Pelt peels off.

                                  JANE
                    So, dumb question, how come you let 
                    Purcell slip away?  

      Lisbon gives Jane a cool it look.

                                  LISBON
                    Stuff happens, right?

                    You re confident it s Carris who 
                    did this?  Purcell looks like the 
                    kind of man had more than a few 
                    enemies.

                                  PRECIADO
                    Yeah.  We re confident.

                                  JANE
                    What if Purcell wasn t even the 
                    target?  What if the girl was the 
                    target? 

      Blakely gives Jane a long look.

                                    BLAKELY
                    What makes you think that?

                    Either way, she s the place to 
                    start the investigation.  She was  
                    only here a moment, so the Shooter 
                    came in right after she arrived.  
                    Which suggests he or they followed 
                    her here.  So let s retrace her 
                    steps.  What s Patrice Matigan s 
                    current address?  

                                    BLAKELY
                    We don t know.  We checked the 
                    address listed on her licence and 
                      registration, but she hasn t lived 
                    there for several months.

                                  PRECIADO
                    You re making this more difficult 
                    than it needs to be.  We know 
                    whodunit.  This was a hit ordered 
                    by Rick Carris.  If he s still in 
                    town, we ll round him up.  You guys 
                    relax.  See the sights.  We ll call 
                    you when we have any news.   

      Blakely and Preciado walk away.

                    This is real police work, sonny.  
                    People get hurt.  Go push some 
                    paper.  

      Blakely and Preciado push past Rigsby and stride toward the 
      duplex with the other two Davis PD Cops close behind.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Real police work?  You mean like 
                      protecting a State s witness?

      Preciado turns back to Rigsby; coming right at him.  Rigsby 
      makes a move toward him, and Cho has to physically grab hold 
      and haul him to a stop.

                                  CHO
                    -- Rigsby!  Walk away.  Look at me!  
                    Walk away.  We told them not to go 
                    in.  This goes South now, it s 
                    their necks.  We don t want to be 
                    involved in any way.

                    Be smart.  Leave it. 

      Right then, Lisbon and Jane pull up in a CBI car.  Lisbon 
      comes hustling over when she sees Blakely et al already 
      entering the duplex grounds...

                                  LISBON
                    What s going on?  What are they

                    Blakely and Preciado refused to

                    to stop them.  They wouldn t 
                    listen.

                    They re out for blood.

      Lisbon starts to go after Blakely, but fifty yards ahead, 
      Blakely and his crew are at the duplex door, kicking it in 
      and rushing inside.  GUNSHOTS ring out.

      Seconds later RICK CARRIS makes a run for it after bursting 
      through a back door.  He takes out an out-of-shape Davis PD 
      Officer.  Blakely and Preciado are after him, but Carris is 
      fast, breezing through an open fence as they struggle to keep 
      up.

      Jane looks up to see Carris and his pursuers heading right 
      toward him.

      JANE S POV: A gate in the side of the yard swings open in the 
      breeze.  A large stone sits on the ground nearby, remnants of 
        a half-finished construction job.

      Jane heads over, nonchalantly sliding the stone just a few 
      inches over so it now wedges in front of the gate, blocking 
      it.  Then he stands back to watch.

      Davis PD s running after Carris, guns drawn.  Lisbon s 
      yelling for Carris to stop.  Carris nears the fence, headed 
      for the street.  But instead of flying through the gate, he 
      smashes into it hard, knocking himself onto the concrete.

      Lisbon, Rigsby and Cho jump in to make the arrest.  As Lisbon 
      pulls Carris up off the ground, Jane walks over and casually 
      moves the stone back into place.

      The CBI team are around Carris before Blakely, Preciado and 
      their men get there.  Lions robbed of their kill.

                                  PRECIADO

                    The hell we will.  Walk away. 

        A stand-off.  Blakely pulls Preciado away.  Lisbon and the 
      team lead away their prize capture. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.

      Jane approaches the front door of the house in a suburban cop 
      neighborhood.  Pristine lawns.  Lots of shiny American-made 
      cars and boats and other motorized leisure craft in the 
      driveways.

      Sam Blakely -- in unbuttoned police uniform -- answers the 
      door to Jane.  He looks like he s still in shock.

      just make out the figure of A MAN sitting in the driver s

                    Blakely, drop the gun.

      From the cover of their car, Rigsby and Van Pelt have their 
      guns trained on Sam.  There s Cho on the other side, also 
      with a gun trained on Sam.

                    Drop it!!

      Sam drops his gun.  It s over...


      Sam gets out of his patrol car, tosses his hat, and puts a 
      plain windcheater over his uniform shirt.

                    She went to the store and then to 
                    this motel.

                    I thought for sure she was going to 
                    meet Dad.  
                          (laughs bitterly)
                      I thought, ah-ha!  I got him now.  


      Sam creeps stealthily along the balcony to Room 222.  The 
      door s open, people are talking inside.  Sam girds himself 
      for an emotional scene and shoves the door open.


      A quiet weekday afternoon.  Lawn sprinklers hissing.     
      Jane s car pulls up outside the Blakely house.
