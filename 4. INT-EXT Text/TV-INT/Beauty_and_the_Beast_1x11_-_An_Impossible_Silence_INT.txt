  This is one of several communication junctions, where hundreds of pipes of
    varying diameters run along the walls and ceiling   even the floor.  Where
  the metallic tapping is constant, creating an incredible, echoing symphony.
  Where messages from various parts of the tunnel world converge and are
    relayed to their proper destinations.  It is in this room that CHARLIE PASCAL
  spends most of his time   monitoring, sending, and receiving.  Armed with
    foot-and-a-half long rods in each hand, Pascal moves from one pipe to another
  with a dancer's grace and a neurosurgeon's intensity.

                                              CHARLIE
                        See?  I worked out this abbreviation for
                        express stuff.

  He taps a staccatti code.

                                              CHARLIE
                        You wouldn't believe how much we cut down
                        on congestion.

  ANGLE TO INCLUDE VINCENT

    watching Charlie from the chamber entrance, amused.

                                              VINCENT
                        Oh, I believe it.  But don't you ever get
                        tired, Charlie?

                                              CHARLIE
                                            (deadpan)
                        Only when I stop.

    Vincent smiles.  Then he turns at the sound of running footsteps, and:

20 ANOTHER ANGLE

  as Laura rounds the corner, crying, gasping for air, and flies into Vincent's
  arms.  He holds her with soothing firmness.  She continues sobbing, choked
  and breathless.  Charlie is visible in b.g., concerned, but bound to the
  pipes.  And on Vincent's deeply trouble face, we:

                                                                          CUT TO:                                                                                            7


    Maxwell checks himself out in front of the mirror.  He combs his hair,
    patting it into place, and straightens his tie.  he takes a deep breath,
    marshalling his cool before marching out into the:


22 CORRIDOR22

  where Cathy is waiting for him.  MOVING WITH THEM as they wend their way
    through office traffic to the Press Briefing Room.  Unconsciously his hand
    wanders up to check his tie again.  And, as he catches a reflection of
    himself in a glass cabinet, he runs his hand through his hair.

                                              CATHY
                        You look fine, Joe.

    Maxwell shoots her a gimme-a-break look.  Then:

                                              MAXWELL
                        I hate these guys.  They move in packs,
                        like wolves... or sharks.

                                              CATHY
                                            (amused)
                        It's only a roomful of
                          reporters ...

                                              MAXWELL
                        Easy for you to say.

                                              CATHY
                        Relax.  It's not like you're running for
                        office.

    Maxwell's sideways-look at her betrays the political aspirations he hides
    beneath his easy smile and manner.

                                              CATHY
                        Or are you?

  They stop before a door.  Maxwell's tone is serious.                                                                                            8



                                              MAXWELL
                        Let's just say that putting a copkiller
                        away won't hurt my career any.
                                            (then)
                        Wish me luck.

  Cathy smiles as she follows Maxwell into the room.

                                                                          CUT TO:



  Cathy leans against the wall beside the door, as Maxwell approaches a small
  podium to face a battery of microphones and mini-cams.  Twenty reporters sit
  in fold-up chairs, waiting for him to say something.  Maxwell pulls out a
  sheet of paper from his coat pocket, flattens it against the podium.  he's
    holding two contrasting emotions in his heart   nervous but happy to be
  there.

                                              MAXWELL
                        I'm going to read a statement.  After
                        that, I'm not at liberty to answer
                        questions.
                                          (looks up)
                        I'm sorry.
                                        (then; reading)
                        Last night Curtis Jackson was arrested
                        and charged with the murder of Vice Squad
                          Detective Nicholas Perotta.  Ballistics
                        has confirmed that the handgun found in h
                        is car was the murder weapon.  The
                        District Attorney has set a preliminary
                        hearing date, and we have every reason to
                        believe that justice will be served in a
                        fair but expeditious fashion.
                                    (looking up; all charm)
                        That's all folks.

  As Maxwell makes his way out, the reporters hurl a few questions at him (e.g.
  Will you be handling the ccase personally?  Is it true that Curtis Jackson
  had threatened Detective Perotta on numerous occasions?) which he brushes off
  with a wave of his hand.

                                              MAXWELL
                        Excuse me ...

  He and Cathy exit back into the                                                                                            9

  where they head back to their offices.  After a couple of steps, Joe finally
  asks:

                                              MAXWELL
                        Well... how was I?

                                              CATHY
                                    (veering away; ironic)
                        Look out City Hall.

  ON Joe's indignant face, as he watches her go.

                                                                          CUT TO:


  As JACK DAVIS wedges himself between LAINE KELLER and Yates, who look as
  though they might kill one another.  Davis is Yate's longtime partner, early
    forties, black.  Keller looks older than his fifty-three years: he's tough,
  but his time on the force has taken a visible toll.

                                            KELLER
                        How the hell could you do it, Danny?

                                              YATES
                                          (right back)
                        You should be thanking me for doing your
                        dirty work.

                                            KELLER
                        That's bull!

                                              DAVIS
                        Back off.  Both of you.                                                                                            10



  The force of Davis' baritone eases the tension a little.  Keller takes a few
  steps away

  WIDER ANGLE

  The walls and shelves are cluttered with pictures of the kids at day camp, an
    assortment of trophies, as well as several NYPD service commendations   which
  should tell us (in case we haven't already figured it out) that these guys
  are cops.  New York cops.  There's also a pool table, several bicycles, dart
  board, work bench with tools, and a small, adjacent boiler room that has no
  door, visible in b.g.

                                              DAVIS
                                  (to Keller; conciliatory)
                        Look.  I'm sorry, Laine.  But Danny only
                        did what he had to.  You know how Nick
                        was, especially the last couple of weeks.
                        he would've blown it   for all of us.

  Keller is deeply troubled.  he knows Davis is right.  This knowledge cools
  him down considerably.

                                              DAVIS
                        Anyway, it's done with.  And if you're
                        gonna blame Danny, you may as well blame
                        me, too.

                                            KELLER
                        What about Jackson?

                                              DAVIS
                        They got him cold.  Murder weapon,
                        motive.  We just sit tight and let the
                        system do its thing.  Anyway, he's a
                        punk.  Whatever he gets, he deserves.

  Yates rubs a thoughtful hand over his mouth.  He's the only one who knows
  it's not that simple; that there's a witness somewhere out there.

                                              YATES
                        Listen  

  Keller and Davis regard him.  He can't tell them.                                                                                            11

                                              YATES
                                          (to Laine)
                        I want you to know, Laine.  I only did
                        what was necessary.

  Keller nods: it is at once a compliance and an apology.  Yates moves to a
    frosted light fixture, which he begins to unscrew from its base  

                                              YATES
                        Nick was a good man.

  From the fixture he removes two plastic bagged kilos of cocaine.  As he hefts
  these in his hands, a kind of awe spreads over his face

                                              YATES
                        But we are talking about a half a million
                        dollars ...

  The power and the possibilities represented in this white powder are
    undeniable to the three men.  For the first time, they are unanimous.  Their
  trance is interrupted by a sound:  FOTSTEPS descending the stairs.  Yates
    quickly hides the puches into a toolbox, closing the lid, just as

  MAGGIE YATES

    enters, carrying a tray with three Budweisers.  She's in her early thirties,
    pretty, and knows her place as dutiful wife and mother.  She sets down the
  tray, and after a quick look exchanged with her husband, approaches Keller,
    regarding him sympathetically.

                                              MAGGIE
                        I'm sorry about Nick ...

  as she gives him a condolent hug

                                              KELLER
                        Yeah, thanks Maggie.

  Yates cracks open a beer in b.g., and on Keller's profoundly troubled face,
  we:

                                                                          CUT TO:

    LAURA'S HANDS

    signing passionately in American Sign Language (ASL), shaping the very air
  with her words.

                                        VINCENT (O.S.)
                        I'm listening ...

  WIDEN

  to find Vincent, who has just signed "I'm listening ..." (NOTE: in this
  scene, Vincent signs only where indicated and his signing should be slow and
    graceful, mirroring his speech.)  He stands before Laura, whose expressive
  face reflects the passion of her silent language, and the anguish of her
    message.  And we now understand the cause of her shy silence; she's been deaf
  from birth.  As Laura continues to sign, Vincent overlaps.

                                              VINCENT
                                    (repeating to himself)
                        ... the wrong man.

  Laura touches the newspaper: which lays on a table before Vincent, folded
  over to the top of the fifth page.

  the two-column headline "COPKILLER CAUGHT".  Included in this article is a
    picture of a young black man, CURTIS JACKSON.

  as Laura regards Vincent expectantly.

                                              VINCENT
                                    (signing and speaking)
                        Are you sure?

  Laura nods vigorously.  Then:

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        I have eyes.  I saw him.  I saw
                          everything... clearly.  The man, the
                        killer, was white   not black.

                                              VINCENT
                                        (echoing softly)
                        ... a white man.                                                                                            13



  Laura nods, regarding Vincent, at once relieved of the burden she's been
    carrying around and frightened by its implications.  Vincent's face reflects
  her concern   which is now their concern.  Then:

                                              VINCENT
                        I am sorry you've seen the worst of their
                        world.  But it's good that you came to me
                        ...

                                              LAURA
                                            (sighing)
                        You've always helped me... from the
                        beginning.

                                              VINCENT
                        That won't change, Laura.  Ever.  I'll
                        always be here for you.

  She signs   and you don't have to be an expert to understand her fear and
    confusion.  Laura's eyes start welling, at which point she looks down.  Beat.
    Vincent gently touches her shoulder.  She looks up, regards him.  Vincent
  shakes his head reassuringly.

                                              VINCENT
                        Don't be afraid.  You're not alone.  I
                        promise.

  Laura nods.  And as she wipes a tear, we:

                                                                          CUT TO:


  At first we HEAR Vincent's voice -- timber and bass -- as the CAMERA PANS the
    sweating walls, CROSSES a tunnel opening leading into the gloom ...

                                        VINCENT (O.S.)
                        When Laura first came to live with us,
                        she was only a child.  Alone and
                          frightened.  Her parents ...

  and finally FINDS Vincent and Cathy together again.                                                                                            14

                                              VINCENT
                        ... they wanted... a normal daughter.
                        But there was a friend, a helper -- and
                        he brought her down here... to where it
                        was safe... to where she could know love.
                                            (beat)
                          I remember, in the beginning she used to
                        collect things... keep them on her
                        bedside table.  Alarm clocks... bells...
                        buzzers.  And she would hold them close
                        to her ear... feeling the vibrations...
                        trying to hear the stolen sounds...
                                              (then)
                        It broke my heart.

  Long beat.

                                              CATHY
                        And you became her teacher.

                                              VINCENT
                        I became her friend.

                                              CATHY
                        Vincent... can... she speak at all?

                                              VINCENT
                        She speaks with her hands... a beautiful
                          language.

    Cathy's concern grows as she becomes aware of Vincent's powerful connection
  to the girl, of how important she is to him.

                                              CATHY
                        And she told you that she saw this
                        murder?

                                    Vincent nods gravely.

                                              CATHY
                        How can she be sure it's not the same
                        man.

                                              VINCENT
                        The man Laura saw... was not a black man.

  Cathy considers this.  Then:                                                                                            15

                                              CATHY
                        Vincent... the evidence they have is
                          overwhelming.  Is she positive?

                                              VINCENT
                        She is not mistaken.
                                              (beat)
                        She knows what this might mean.

                                              CATHY
                        Coming forward to tell her story...

                                              VINCENT
                                              Yes.

                                              CATHY
                        I'll do everything I can to make that
                        unnecessary.  But, Vincent...
                                              (beat)
                        ... I don't think there's any other way.

  she moves to another pipe and "listens" -- her face reflecting an almost
    meditative serenity as she monitors the very pulse of her world.

  FADE IN:


  CAMERA PANS the book-lined room.

                                          FATHER (O.S.)
                        I won't allow it.  The problem isn't
                        ours, Vincent.

  and finds Father addressing Vincent, who shakes his head in heated
    disagreement.

                                              VINCENT
                        Does our world exempt its people from
                        moral responsibility?

                                            FATHER
                        No.  It offers them sanctuary from an
                        impossible madness.  Especially those who
                        most need protection.  Like the girl.

                                              VINCENT
                        Laura is no longer a girl.

                                            FATHER
                        She's still vulnerable.  Exposing her
                        like that...
                              (Father breaks off; exhales his
                                frustration; shakes his head)
                        Vincent: here, we've given her the chance
                        to heal.

                                              VINCENT
                        And to hide...

                                            FATHER
                        If she were simply hard of hearing, that
                        would be one thing.  But she's
                        congenitally deaf.

                                              VINCENT
                        I know Laura's pain.  When she came to
                        us, her soul was broken, and our love
                        helped it to mend.  But we've become a
                        crutch, and the tunnels a shell.  Some
                        day, she'll need to grow beyond all of
                        this... beyond us.                                                                                            17

                                            FATHER
                        And you think that day is now?

                                              VINCENT
                        Without Laura's word, Catherine has no
                        case.  An innocent man will go to prison.
                                        (beat; emphatic)
                        That should mean something to you.

  It does.  Still, Father's resolve remains firm.

                                            FATHER
                        Our priority is still to Laura.

                                              VINCENT
                                      (turning to Father)
                        Before, you said that the problem is not
                        ours.
                                            (beat)
                        Neither is the decision.

  Father considers this in silence.  Then:

                                            FATHER
                        So, what do you propose?

                                              VINCENT
                        That we allow Laura herself to choose.

                                            FATHER
                        Without the benefit of our guidance?

                                              VINCENT
                          Father... what benefit could she possibly
                        derive from our debate.  It would serve
                        only to confuse her...

                                            FATHER
                                          (understanding)
                        ... to divide her loyalties between us.

                                              VINCENT
                                              Yes.                                                                                            18

                                            FATHER
                        Perhaps you're right.
                                        (then; deciding)
                        Very well.  We'll do as you say.

  ON Vincent's agreement, we:
                                                                          CUT TO:


  Cathy meets with CURTIS JACKSON, 36, a black and facetious ex-con, through
  the wire-mesh of the visiting room.

                                              JACKSON
                                            (laughing)
                        That's a new one on me.  Since when does
                        the D.A.'s office go around trying to get
                        people off.
                                        (figuring it out)
                        I know, it's some kind of new psychology,
                        right?

                                              CATHY
                                        (all business)
                        How long were you out of prison?

                                              JACKSON
                        Almost a year.

                                              CATHY
                        Your parole officer tells me that you've
                        been meeting regularly.

    Jackson gives her a look out of the corner of his eye.  Then, unsure of what
  she's driving at, he reverts to sarcasm:

                                              JACKSON
                        Every week, ma'am.  And I've also been
                        helpin' little old ladies 'cross the
                        street, and going to Confession every
                        Sunday -- repent my sins.

  The heat rises in Cathy's throat and face.  She remembers what a man like
  this once did to her.                                                                                            19

                                              CATHY
                        Let's get this straight.  As far as I'm
                        concerned, you're a piece of dirt... A
                        man who sells drugs to kids doesn't
                        deserve to see the light of day... ever.
                        They say you're rehabilitated.
                          Congratulations.  But if it were up to
                        me, I would've buried you.
                                              (beat)
                        Now I'm here because I don't think you
                        killed Detective Perotta, and I want to
                        find out who did.  And you're going to
                        help me.

    Jackson looks put upon, rearranges himself in the chair.

                                              JACKSON
                        Lotta good it'll do...

                                              CATHY
                                              (beat)
                        Tell me about these threats you were
                        supposed to have made against Perotta.

                                              JACKSON
                        Man... that was a long time ago.  It was
                          stupid... He was the cop that busted me.
                        I was pissed off... said some stupid
                        things, you know.

                                              CATHY
                        What was that gun doing in your car?

                                              JACKSON
                        How the hell do I know?  Somebody put it
                        there.

                                              CATHY
                        Any ideas who?

                                              JACKSON
                        What you want, a list?

                                              CATHY
                                      (cold stare; then)
                        Yeah, that's exactly what I want.

  ON Jackson, reacting to this ballsy lady, we:

  Cathy is at the tall front desk, scrambling among several people trying to
  get the attention of SERGEANT JESSICA COOPER.  A mounted bulletin board
  reads: Memorial service for Lt. Nicolas Perotta -- 3:00 Tuesday -- St.
    Marry's".

    (PRODUCTION NOTE: In this and all following precinct scenes, there should be
    a gritty, almost stylized look and sound of chaotic activity -- in extreme
    contrast to the romantic lyricism to the world below.)

                                            COOPER
                                            (pointing)
                        Third desk on the right.

  Amid the cacophony of voices, ringing telephones, and computer printers,
  Cathy wends her way through teh various desks and booking areas to Keller's
  desk.

                                              CATHY
                          Detective Keller.

  Keller loops up from a thick sheaf of papers, and puts down his pen.

                                            KELLER
                        Whatta you want?

                                              CATHY
                                      (extending her hand)
                        I'm Catherine Chandler, from the D.A.'s
                        office.

  They shake.

                                              CATHY
                        I'm sorry about Lieutenant Perotta.

                                            KELLER
                        Yeah.  Me too.  Eight years is a long
                        time.
                                            (then)
                        You have anything to do with nailing
                        Jackson?                                                                                            21

                                              CATHY
                        -- Yes...

                                              KELLER
                        I appreciate it.  We all do.  Believe me:
                        it's no small consolation.

                                              CATHY
                          Detective Keller --
                                    (braces herself, then)
                        I don't think Curtis Jackson killed your
                        partner.

                                              KELLER
                        What're you talking about?

                                              CATHY
                        We may have an eyewitness.

                                              KELLER
                        What eye witness?
                        (when Cathy doesn't answer immediately)
                        C'mon tell me: who?  Who says Jackson
                        didn't do it?

                                              CATHY
                        I can't disclose that information yet.

                                              KELLER
                                            (flashing)
                        Jackson killed my partner.  He had it out
                        for Nicky.  Everyone knows it.
                          Chrisssake, they just about caught him in
                        the act.

                                              CATHY
                        He claims he was set up.  I think the
                        only thing Jackson's guilty of recently
                        is stupidity.

  Keller doesn't have to pretend: this is definitely news to him.  he runs his
    fingers through his hair, regains his composure.  Then:

                                              KELLER
                        Look.  I'm sorry I flew off.                                                                                            22



                                              CATHY
                                (her heart goes out to him)
                          I understand.

                                              KELLER
                        It's just, you come here and drop this on
                        me like a ton of bricks.  Now I don't
                        know what to think.

                                              CATHY
                        If you have a few minutes, I'd like to
                        ask you some questions about recent
                        cases, who else might have had a motive.
                        Just preliminary, but it might give me a
                        place to start.

                                              KELLER
                                          (nods, then)
                        Sure: I got a couple minutes...

  He puts on an I'll-do-what's-best face, but in his eyes there's an acute
  dread.  He's wondering what the hell he's going to do.

                                                                          CUT TO:


  CAMERA FINDS Vincent, Father, and Laura intimately gathered in the golden
  light of the chamber.  Laura's manner continues to be hesitant and shy.
    Sometimes when she signs too quickly, Vincent must translate for Father's
    benefit.

                                              VINCENT
                        Father and I have talked a long time.
                        The decision ... will have to be yours,
                        Laura.

  A part of Laura is terrified by the responsibility, and her eyes wander away
  from the reality of the conversation.  After a moment, Father leans over and
    touches her shoulder, so that she can read his lips as he speaks.                                                                                            23

                                            FATHER
                        Laura ... our laws say nothing about
                        those who want to return to the world
                        above.  That's because this place means
                          different things to different people.
                        For some, it's a place of healing and
                        safety -- a way station between difficult
                        events in their lives.
                        For others ...
                                      (indicating himself)
                        ... it's a permanent home.
                                            (beat)
                        But all of us reach a point -- a moment
                        in time -- when we must define for
                          ourselves what this place means to us.
                        Perhaps now is your time.

  Laura considers this.  Then:

                                              LAURA
                                      (signing, to Father)
                        If I do decide to go, may I come back?

  Father smiles.  Then, compassionately:

                                            FATHER
                        Of course you can come back ...
                                            (then)
                        ... if you decide to go.

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        And if I want to stay above?

  Father looks to Vincent, preferring that Vincent answer this one.

                                              VINCENT
                        If you want to stay above... one of the
                        helpers will look after you, and teach
                        you what you need to know... until the
                        time comes when you can survive on your
                        own.

  Laura looks down into her lap.  She grasps her hands tightly together.  The
  weight of the decision and the subtle tension in the air between Father and
    Vincent combine to make her uneasy.                                                                                            24

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        I don't know what to do.
                                          (to Father)
                        What do you think I should do, Father?

  Father hesitates.  he knows that by answering this question, he threatens to
    violate the course of action he and Vincent agreed to follow.  So he treads
  slowly and carefully... until he just can't help himself.

                                              FATHER
                        I think you should remember what you've
                        seen of the world above, and ask yourself
                        it that's a world you want to rejoin.
                        The violence and the injustice --

                                              VINCENT
                                  (overriding; admonishing)
                        Father, we agreed.

                                              FATHER
                        I'm sorry.

  But Laura persists.

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        Is that all there is?  Violence and
                        injustice.

  This is too complicated for Father's ASL vocabulary. He turns to Vincent.

                                              FATHER
                        It's too quick for me.  I didn't
                          understand.

                                              VINCENT
                        She wants to know whether that's all
                        there is in the world... violence and
                        injustice?

                                              FATHER
                                          (to Laura)
                        Of course not.  There is also much
                        beauty.  it's just harder to find.                                                                                            25

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        Because I'm deaf?

                                              FATHER
                        No, not because you're deaf.  It's harder
                        to find for everyone.

  She regards Father for a moment, and then turns to Vincent.

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        Tell me what to do, Vincent.

                                              VINCENT
                        I can't tell you what to do.
                                              (beat)
                        But you are strong, Laura.  Your life...
                        has made you powerful... in ways you
                        can't even begin to imagine...

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        If I can't imagine, how do I know it's
                        true?

  Again, Father doesn't understand.

                                              FATHER
                        Vincent?

                                              VINCENT
                        If she can't imagine her strength, how
                        does she know it's true?
                                          (to Laura)
                        Laura... you know by learning... by
                          following what your heart tells you is
                        right... by going... where you have to
                        go.

  Laura takes a long moment to consider this.  Then:

                                              LAURA
                                        (beat; signing)
                        And there's an innocent man's life at
                        stake?

    Vincent looks to Father before answering.

                                              VINCENT
                        Yes, Laura, there's an innocent man's
                        life at stake.                                                                                            26



  ON Laura, understanding that this is the primary issue on which she should
  base her decision.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                                              CATHY
                                            (hopeful)
                        Tomorrow morning?
                                            (beat)
                        Afternoon?

  As Edie makes a face:

                                        MAXWELL (O.S.)
                        Hey, Radcliffe.  Got a sec?

37 ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAXWELL 37

    standing in the doorway.  Seething.  In fact, we've never seen him so cold-
  ass made.

                                              CATHY
                                          (to Edie)
                        Be right back.

                                              EDIE
                                        (re: Maxwell)
                        Don't bet on it.

  Cathy goes to join Maxwell, who holds the door open for her, following her
    outside with laser-intensity:


  with Cathy and Maxwell, as he ushers her by the arm in tense silence to a a
  quiet corner, away from the human traffic.  Then:                                                                                            27

                                              MAXWELL
                        What the hell do you think you're doing?

                                              CATHY
                        Let go of me.

                                              MAXWELL
                        Answer me.

                                              CATHY
                                            (firm)
                        First let go.

    Maxwell releases his grip.  Momentary remorse.  Then he exhales some of his
  anger.  But only some.

                                              MAXWELL
                        I don't understand you, Radcliffe.
                          Yesterday everything's beautiful.  We
                        close a major investigation like in a
                          textbook.  Today I find out you've been
                        sniffing around behind my back.

                                              CATHY
                        I just wanted to have something solid
                        before I came to you.
                                            (beat)
                        I had second thoughts.

                                              MAXWELL
                        Why didn't you tell me about this
                        yesterday?

                                              CATHY
                        Because yesterday I didn't know there was
                        a witness.

                                              MAXWELL
                        Whoa -- back up.

                                              CATHY
                        There was a witness, Joe.

                                              MAXWELL
                                            (sceptical)
                        Can you produce this witness?

                                              CATHY
                                        (beat; troubled)
                        Not yet.

  Which only confirms Maxwell's doubts.  He shakes his head.                                                                                            28


                                              MAXWELL
                        I've been playing this game a little
                        longer than you.  Half the secret is
                        knowing the rules cold, and the other
                        half is knowing when to sit out.
                                            (emphatic)
                        You're blowing it on both counts.

                                              CATHY
                                              (angry)
                        What about due process, Joe?  And
                        reasonable doubt?  Or do you just want me
                        to go out and hang Jackson now and save
                        you the trouble?

                                              MAXWELL
                        You still don't get it...
                                      (the bottom line)
                        Jackson killed a cop.

                                              CATHY
                        If he's innocent what difference does
                        that make?

                                              MAXWELL
                                            (imperative)
                        Leave it alone.  For your sake.

                                              CATHY
                        My sake?  Isn't there a hidden agenda
                        here we're not talking about?  Like how
                        the truth might make for an embarrassing
                        press conference --

                                              MAXWELL
                        Low blow, Radcliffe.

  Cathy knows she's out of line.  And Maxwell's anger has passed into a deeper
  realm.  He speaks slowly.

                                              MAXWELL
                        You know my father was a cop.  Up in
                        Harlem.  Fifty-second precinct.  He was
                        just getting off one morning when two
                        guys jumped him.  Took his gun and his
                        watch, slit his throat, and left him to
                        bleed to death.  There was no arrest.
                        Nobody went to trial.  They were fourteen
                        years old.
                                            (beat)
                        So was I.
  He regards Cathy for a moment before starting away.                                                                                            29

                                              CATHY
                                      (calling after him)
                        Joe.

  But Maxwell is already gone.

                                              CATHY
                              (to herself; wistful remorse)
                        Joe...

  On Cathy, powerfully disturbed by what has just happened, we:

                                                                  CUT TO:

39 A WORLD GLOBE39

  circa 1900, on a wooden floor stand.  CAMERA PANS to find Laura, seated
  before her dressing table mirror, staring intently at her reflection.  And we
  are:


  About the size of Vincent's chamber, decorated in much the same way as any
  young girl's bedroom might be.  Laura takes a long time there, trying to
    reconcile the face staring back at her in the looking glass with what she
  feels about herself.  She is a child, but what she regards in the mirror is a
  woman emerging...

  She leans closer to herself.  Gently touches her mouth.  Something bubbles
    tentatively on her lips before they go still again.  She exhales.  Then a
  sound -- a soul-deep utterance issues from her lips, incomprehensible to us.
  After a moment she tries again -- the syllable OUW -- then again, until we
  can understand what she is trying to say.

                                              LAURA
                        Laura...

  It is an affirmation of her identity, tentative yet somehow bold.  And as the
  edges of her mouth sneak up into a smile, we:

                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                            30


  As they whoosh open and Cathy steps out into the corridor.  She heads for her
    apartment door.  Balancing her briefcase on her knee, she fishes for her key
  and finally manages to open the door.  She reaches inside to switch on the
    lights.  But as soon as they go on, A GLOVED HAND kills them and then grabs
    Cathy's wrist, yanking her into:


  Where she is spun into another man's arms, slamming face first into a wall,
  and pinned there.  Both are stocking-faced -- and Yates crosses through a
  shaft of liquid moonlight and approaches her in the deep shadow.

                                              YATES
                                (to the man holding Cathy)
                        Turn her around.

  The man puts Cathy in a full nelson and roughly turns her around the face
  Yates.

                                              YATES
                        The only thing worse than a cop killer is
                        somebody who covers for one...

  as he backhands Cathy across the face.  Cathy sags at the blow and would drop
  to the floor if it weren't for the man holding her up.  She recovers and
  raises her head to face her attacker, spitting out the words:

                                              CATHY
                        If you think this is going to stop me...

  but before she gets out the next syllable, Yates drives a powerful fist into
  her stomach.  Now the man holding her lets go, and Cathy sinks to her knees,
    doubling over, groping for breath.                                                                                            31

43 ANOTHER ANGLE43

  of Yates from the waist up.  We understand but don't see him viciously kick
  Cathy -- before stealing out, leaving Cathy unconscious, moaning on the
  floor.

                                                                    TIME LAPSE DISSOLVE:

44 VINCENT44

    minutes later, surges through the balcony doors.  He rushes to Cathy's fallen
    figure, bends down to her.  His voice trembles with concern.

                                              VINCENT
                        Catherine...

  She rolls her head to look up at him.

                                              CATHY
                                            (weakly)
                        I'm all right.  I think.

  She tries to move, but the pain overwhelms her, and she sags.  Vincent slides
  his arms under her body, and with no visible effort lifts her up.  he carries
  her across the darkened living room and into her bedroom...

  where he lays her on the bed.  Here, too, the moonlight seeps in, making
    everything seem ghostly transparent.

                                                                    TIME LAPSE DISSOVE:

    Vincent gently presses a cool, deep cloth to Cathy's forehead.  he removes it
  and listens for a beat.  Thinking she's finally asleep, he begins to back
  away.

                                              CATHY
                                        (barely audible)
                        Vincent...

  He bends over her to listen.

                                              CATHY
                        Please stay... I need you close.

                                              VINCENT
                        I'll watch over you... don t worry.  Just
                        sleep.

  Cathy, now comforted, closes her eyes.  Vincent retreats to sit -- facing her
  -- on the two steps leading to the balcony.

                                                                    TIME LAPSE DISSOLVE                                                                                            32

  her in the moonlight, keeping her safe.

                                          ACT THREE

  FADE IN:


    walking toward an earth-orange light at tunnel's end, and:


  as Laura crosses the threshold into Vincent's Chamber, Vincent turns his
    attention from the book he's reading, to her.

                                              VINCENT
                        Come in.

  Laura moves toward Vincent.  Her tentative demeanor has given way to some new
  kind of self-determination, evident in her carriage and in the quality of her
    signing.

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        I've been thinking a lot... about
                          everything.  And I've decided: I want to
                        go above.

                                              VINCENT
                        You've decided to go above...

  Laura nods and smiles proudly.  But Vincent's momentary elation is troubled
  by a thought.  He rises to face her, as:

                                              VINCENT
                        Since we last spoke, much has happened.
                        The woman I told you about...

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        Catherine...

                                              VINCENT
                        Yes, Catherine.  She was attacked last
                        night.                                                                                            34

                                              LAURA
                                        (upset; signing)
                        Is she all right?

                                              VINCENT
                        She'll be fine.  The damage was greater
                        to her pride than to her body.

  Laura is relieved, although still troubled.

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        But why?  Why would anyone do that?

                                              VINCENT
                        Because there are people who want the
                        truth to be kept hidden.
                                              (then)
                        You should understand the risks, the
                        dangers, if you decide to go up.

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                          I understand...

                                              VINCENT
                        You can still change your mind.

    Determined, Laura shakes her head.

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        I want to go...

  Beat.  Then Vincent accepts Laura's decision with a single, distinctly proud
  nod.  The emotional connection between these two has never been more
    apparent.

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        Vincent, there's so much I have to thank
                        you for.                                                                                            35

                                              VINCENT
                        You have only yourself to thank... and to
                        be proud of.
                                            (beat)
                        Sometimes, events in our lives show us
                        what we've known all along.  This last
                        year... I've felt it in you: a need... to
                        see a life beyond our tunnels and
                          chambers.
                                            (then)
                        You knew inside yourself that it was
                        time...

  Laura is grateful for the understanding.  Then:

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        Until we see each other, I will miss you.

                                              VINCENT
                        Until we see each other, I will miss you,
                        too.

  And they embrace.  After a moment, Vincent pulls back.

                                              VINCENT
                        I'll send word to Catherine.  And when
                        you prepare yourself, we'll go.

  Laura nods, as we:

                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

  As MUSIC PLAYS OVER, Laura walks with Vincent down a long stretch of tunnel.
  They are silhouettes against the bright light glowing at tunnel's end.

                                        VINCENT'S VOICE
                        This is where you go out...

  Laura hesitates for a moment, looking back over her shoulder, before she and
    Vincent merge into the light.  And as the MUSIC CONTINUES, we:

                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                            36


  Cathy is waiting for them at the jagged entrance, wearing the evidence of the
    previous night's attack: discoloration under one eye, a cut lip.  which makes
    Laura's passage all the poignant.  Cathy extends her hand to Laura, smiling.

                                              CATHY
                                          (to Laura)
                        Laura.  I'm Catherine.

  Laura smiles and takes Cathy's hand.

                                              CATHY
                                          (to Laura)
                        Are you ready?

  Laura nods.  Then Cathy regards Vincent with deep gratitude.  What he has
  done means a great deal to her.

                                              CATHY
                        Thank you, Vincent.

  She turns and walks with Laura, who looks back once, leaving Vincent to watch
  them disappear into the light of a world he can never join.

                                                                  CUT TO:


  Cathy removes a blue dress from her closet and holds it up to Laura.  They
  turn together toward a full length mirror, as Cathy addresses Laura's
    reflection.

                                              CATHY
                        I think this will fit you better than me.
                        Do you like it?

  Laura nods, pleased by what she sees in the mirror.

                                              CATHY
                        Tomorrow you give your statement to the
                        police -- so I thought we'd dress you up
                        for the occasion.

  Laura blushes a little, as Cathy makes the "okay" sign.

                                              CATHY
                        Definitely a knockout.

  Laura lowers the dress and turns to regard Cathy: something is bothering her.
  Cathy senses this, and tries to comfort her.

                                              CATHY
                        What you're doing is very brave.

  Laura shakes her head and points to Cathy.

                                              CATHY
                        Me? I'm not so brave.  A little crazy
                        maybe, but I'm just doing my job.

                                              LAURA
                                    (beat; then, signing)
                        I'm sorry...

  and she tentatively reaches out to touch the bruises on Cathy's face, as if
  she shares Cathy's pain.  And Cathy is touched even deeper by Laura's great
    empathy.

                                              CATHY
                        This has been a real tough time for me.
                        I was very much alone on this case --
                        until now.  But I really believe we're
                        doing the right thing.  Both of us.

  Laura nods.  Then something occurs to her: an idea.  She lays the dress down
  on Cathy's bed, and turns, suddenly very animated, toward Cathy.                                                                                            38


                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        Would you like to learn how to sign?

                                              CATHY
                                    (trying to translate)
                        I'm...
                            (shakes her head; frustrated laugh)
                        I don't know what you're saying.

  Laura scratches her palm with her forefinger.  Cathy understands, and digs
  out a note pad and pen from the night table drawer.  She hands these to
  Laura, who scribbles something, then turns the note pad toward Catherine.

  as Cathy smiles and nods.  Laura's enthusiasm is infectious.

                                              CATHY
                        Yes, I'd --

  But Laura shakes her head vigorously, cutting Cathy off.  Already assuming
  the role of teacher, Laura shakes her fist up and down: ASL for "yes."  Cathy
  picks up on it quickly, mirrors the sign, and:

                                              CATHY
                                            (smiles)
                        Yes.  I'd love to learn how to sign.

  On the shared look of satisfaction we:
                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


  where Cathy and Laura sit facing one another on the couch.  They are now
    wearing nightgowns.  A bowl of popcorn sits on the coffee table before them.
  Cathy reaches for a handful, when Laura slaps her hand and shoots Cathy a
  look of mock-consternation.                                                                                            39

                                              CATHY

                        To show a thought coming forward?

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        Yes.  You're a good student.

                                              CATHY
                              (speaking and signing haltingly)
                        And you're... a good... teacher.

  Laura smiles and is suddenly seized by a yawn.  Cathy glances down at her
  watch.

                                              CATHY
                        It's late.  We'd both better get some
                        sleep.

                                              LAURA
                            (signing slowly for Cathy's benefit)
                        Sleep... is a good idea.

                                              CATHY
                                    (signing and speaking)

                        I'll make up the couch for you, okay?

  Laura nods, but she continues to regard Cathy.  Her mouth opens, as if she's
  about to speak.

                                              CATHY
                                            (sensing)
                        -- you want to say something...

  Laura picks up the pen and notepad from the coffee table.  Words are scrawled
  all over the page: evidence of the hard work that's been achieved here.
  Laura flips to a fresh page and writes something, which she hands to Cathy.                                                                                            40

    a melange of cops, crooks, and victims, whose voices and movements combine to
  create a white noise over which occasional words can be discerned.  From this
  human salad, Cathy and Laura emerge: Laura now in a knee-length blue dress.
  Cathy is evidently known here -- perhaps by the bruises on her face: the cops
  at these desks lookup at her, one by one.

  Cathy holds her own and stares him down, until he passes.  Cathy looks at
  Laura, who affirms her support with a look.  Cathy takes a deep breath as
  they continue, proceeding down

  that's mustard-yellow and narrow.  They stop at the third door on the right.
    Stencilled on the thick frosted glass are the words DEPOSITION ROOM 5.  Cathy
  and Laura exchange a last look before Cathy opens the door and:


  as Cathy and Laura enter the small, sterile room which, behind the closed
  door, offers some quiet refuge from the constant chaos outside.  A long
    rectangular table is centered here, at which two men (GRIGGS and Homocide
    Detective LENNY MESSINA) and one woman are seated.  Griggs has several papers
  fanned out before him, a pen at the ready.  At one end of the table stands a
    tripoded video camera, hooked up to a monitor which frames the empty chair at
  the other end of the table.

  Joe Maxwell brings his chair down on all fours, stands, and approaches Cathy
  and Laura.  His manner is cool and detached.  Exaggeratedly professional.

                                              MAXWELL
                        Miss Chandler, this is Detective Messina
                        -- he'll be conducting the interrogation
                        -- Sergeant Griggs, and Sharon Hall, from
                        Social Services.  She's here to interpret
                        for the witness.

                                    (signing and speaking)
                        Please have a seat, Laura.

  Laura looks at Cathy who gives her a nod of quiet strength and silent
    assurance.  Laura sits in the empty chair.  Messina, the hard-assed veteran
  in charge of the case, now rises and circles around Laura.  Griggs stands and
  moves to the video camera.

                                              MESSINA
                            (turning away from Laura; to Griggs)
                        We ready to go?

                          Before Griggs has a chance to respond,
                                      Cathy interjects.

                                              CATHY
                        Detective.

                          Messina angles his head toward Cathy.

                                              CATHY
                        Laura's deaf --

                                              MESSINA
                                          (overlapping)
                        We know that...

                                              CATHY
                                          (overlapping)
                        ... and no one speaks in here without
                        facing her first.

    Messina glares at Cathy, but complies with her demand.

                                              MESSINA
                        All set, Larry?

                                            GRIGGS
                        You can start anytime.

    Messina half-sits on the table.

                                              MESSINA
                        Okay, Laura.  Why don't you start by
                        telling us what you saw... in your own
                        words.

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        I saw somebody kill a man.                                                                                            43

                                            SHARON
                        I saw somebody kill a man.

    Messina waits for more, but Laura is still nervous and her hands remain
  still.  Messina shoots a sceptical look to Maxwell.  Then, his attention
    returns to Laura.

                                              MESSINA
                        And where did you see this happen?

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        It was on Midwood Street, near the corner
                        of Rogers.

                                            SHARON
                        It was on Midwood Street... near the
                        corner of Rogers.

                                              MESSINA
                          Would you describe for us what you saw?

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        There were two men.  One had a gun.  And
                        I saw him reach inside a car and shoot
                        the other man.

                                            SHARON
                        There were two men.  one had a gun.  I
                        saw him reach inside the car and shoot
                        the other man.

    Messina straightens -- Laura's just given a crucial piece of testimony.

                                              MESSINA
                        I'm sorry would you repeat the last
                        part... about the car.

  Laura doesn't quite understand and looks to Sharon, who signs her Messina's
    question.  Laura nods and starts again.

                                              LAURA
                                            (signing)
                        The man who was shot... was sitting in a
                        car.

                                            SHARON
                        The man who was shot was sitting in a
                        car.                                                                                            44

    Messina exhales sharply and addresses Maxwell in a low urgent tone.

                                              MESSINA
                        Joe, that information hasn't been made
                        public yet.  There's no way she could
                        have known that Perotta was killed in his
                        car.
                                            (beat)
                        I think we got the real thing here.

    Maxwell stirs in his chair and gives Cathy an acknowledging look.  Now, with
  more respect than before.

                                              MESSINA
                        Okay, Laura, let's start at the
                        beginning.

  as Laura's image appears on the screen, looking off at the detective.  Even
  here, rendered in two-dimensional blue light, Laura's fear is almost
    palpable.  But so is her strength.  And as she musters the courage to start
  at the beginning, we:

                                                                  CUT TO:


  From the relative sanctuary and sanity of the deposition room, Cathy and
  Laura reenter the chaos of the squad room jungle.  Cathy is charged by
    Laura's convincing performance and by the stamina and courage of her new
    friend.  As soon as the door to the deposition room closes behind them, she
  takes Laura by the shoulders.

                                              CATHY
                        You did great.

  Laura isn't so sure.

                                              CATHY
                        Really.  No jury in the world could
                        discount that testimony.

    Cathy's genuine enthusiasm convinces Laura, and her eyes shine deeply when
  she smiles.  Cathy squeezes Laura's shoulders and gives her an affectionate
    push-and-pull before they start through the human traffic for the station
    exit...                                                                                            45


60 ANOTHER ANGLE60

  shows Cathy and Laura as they round a section of booking tables, pass by the
  Desk Sergeant, and are on the home stretch... when a young UNIFORMED COP
    catches up with them.

                                            COP #2
                                          (to Cathy)
                        Excuse me.

  He positions himself between them and the station entrance.

                                            COP #2
                        Are you Catherine Chandler?

                                              CATHY
                        Yes I am.

                                            COP #2
                        There's a call for you.

    Cathy's first instinct is to glance protectively at Laura.  Then:

                                              CATHY
                                            (to cop)
                        Who is it?

                                            COP #2
                        I don't know.
                                            (shrugs)
                        Sorry.

  He points to an empty desk way across the squad room.

                                            COP #2
                        Take it over there, if you want.  Line
                        five.

  Cathy turns her attention to Laura, guiding her to a low-backed benc against
    a wall.

                                              CATHY
                        Here.  You sit here.  I'll be right back,
                        okay?

  Laura nods and sits down.  When Cathy turns away, the cop is still there.

                                            COP #2
                                            (smiling)
                        Come on, follow me...                                                                                            46


  which Cathy does... the length of the squad room... to the unoccupied desk
  and the blinking phone.

                                            COP #2
                        Line five.

                                              CATHY
                        Thanks.

  Cathy punches the line and picks up the receiver.

                                              CATHY
                                          (into phone)
                        Hello...

    Nothing.  She puts a finger in her ear to block the bustling sound.

                                              CATHY
                                          (into phone)
                        Hello...

  Still nothing.  She holds the receiver away from her ear and calls after the
    retreating backside of the cop:

                                              CATHY
                        Excuse me.

  He pivots to face her.

                                              CATHY
                                  (holding the receiver out)
                        There's nobody there.

                                            COP #2
                            (moving toward her; apologetically)
                        Must be busted.

  He takes the receiver from her and hangs it up.  Then, indicating an adjacent
  row of cubicles:

                                            COP #2
                        Try the luxury boxes...

  Cathy begins to move in that direction, as we go:

61 BACK TO LAURA61

    sitting straight-backed on the bench, her eyes in her lap.  A sixth-sense is
    operating in her head.  She knows she's being watched.  She doesn't want
  to... she tries not to... but she has to look up.                                                                                            47


62 HER POV   ACROSS THE CONGESTED SQUAD ROOM   MOS 62

  (Post Production Note:  All Laura's POV shots should be accompanied by
    silence to exaggerate her sense of alienation and to convey her heightened
    terror.)

    A man's face, a pair of eyes boring into her.

63 RESUME LAURA63

    quickly dropping her gaze.  And then... slowly... in her face, we see the
    terrifying connection made: the eyes looking at her are the eyes of the
    killer, and they are also the eyes of a policeman.  The fear heaves up in her
    stomach and throat like a nausea.  She forces herself to look again, and this
  time the eye contact with Yates is laser-intense.  Shakily, she rises to her
  feet and scans the room for Cathy.  No sign of her.  She looks back at Yates.

63AA HER POV63A

  Yates has started toward her.

63B LAURA63B

    backpedals slowly, her instinct to run sweeping over her.  Then she turns and
  bolts for the double doors.  She bursts through and out into the:

63C CORRIDOR63C

  when she runs smack into Davis' arms.  She looks up at him, the complete fear
    evident in her face.  And he holds her fact, as we:

64 RESUME CATHY   IN THE CUBICLE 64

    holding the receiver to her ear with her shoulder, jotting something down in
  her calendar.

                                              CATHY
                        ... and the new hearing date is set for
                        Thursday at five.  No, I got it.  Thanks,
                        Mary.

  and she hangs up the phone.  She steps out into the squad room, starting back
    towards Laura.  As she grows near, we catch glimpses -- through the ebb and
  flow of the human tide -- of:                                                                                            48


65 HER POV65

  The empty bench.

66 RESUME CATHY66

  as her pace quickens, the first sparks of panic firing in her breast.  She
    reaches the bench, her eyes scanning the surrounding area for a sign of
  Laura.  She wheels around... looking.  Then, she flags a MAN passing by.

                                              CATHY
                        Did you see a young woman?  Dark hair.
                        She was sitting right there.

  The man doesn't break stride, just shakes his head and moves on.  Cathy
  pivots and finds two BLACK MEN leaning against a wall by the precinct
    entrance.  She rushes to them.

                                              CATHY
                        Did you see a young woman leave?  She was
                        sitting right over there.  Tall, thin,
                        dark hair.

  The men glance at each other and shrug.  Cathy half-turns away and then
  swings back.

                                              CATHY
                        She was wearing a blue dress.

  But the men just look at her blankly.  Cathy's panic begins to war with her
  reason and cool.  She backpedals... and then pushes through the squad room's
  double doors into the:


  Five or six women are in there, as Cathy quickly searches the place... She
  stoops down to check under an occupied stall, etc.  Then she's out again.

                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                            49




  Cathy bursts back into the squad room.  The panic has consumed her, and she
  turns a small, tight circle in the middle of the precinct confusion, as the
  CAMERA CRANES BACK to show her bewildered and enraged in this place of
    supposed safety and order.  And we:

                                                                    FADE OUT

    Catherine sits at the edge of Vincent's bed, wrapped in a blanked, numb from
    crying.  She stares off into herself, her face drained, her body wracked.
    Vincent stands several feet away.

                                              VINCENT
                        Stop blaming yourself, Catherine.

                                            CATHERINE
                        But you blame me.  I can tell from your
                        voice, from the way you're looking at
                        me...

    Vincent shakes his head and regards her squarely.

                                              VINCENT
                        I share your pain.  But what you think
                        you feel from me comes from a part of
                        yourself you must release.

                                              CATHY
                        It's so hard.

                                              VINCENT
                        It's necessary.
                              (simple, yet an implicit threat)
                        The blame, Catherine, rests only on those
                        who have Laura.

  Cathy nods, acknowledging all that Vincent has said.  But the weight of the
  past few days and of Laura's abduction is still too heavy a burden.  Tears
  start rolling down her face.  She turns away.

                                              CATHY
                        I don't know what to do.  I've never felt
                        so helpless.

                                              VINCENT
                        You've told the police.  It's all you can
                        do for now.

                                              CATHY
                        How can they find her?  They have no idea
                        where to even start looking.  She could
                        be anywhere.  She could be --                                                                                            51



  Cathy breaks off.  This last possibility is unutterable.

                                              VINCENT
                        Rest, Catherine.

                                              CATHY
                                        (wiping tears)
                        No.  I have to go back.
                                (off Vincent's reluctance)
                        Please, Vincent.  Take me back.

  Beat.  Then Vincent nods.  Knows he has no choice, as we:

                                                                  CUT TO:


    Vincent escorts Cathy in silence along a narrow and dark stretch of tunnel.
  Beside them, a cluster of pipes snake along the dark walls.  All is quiet as
    Vincent and Cathy proceed upward.  Then, gently, a rhythmic and ordered
    CLANKING comes over the pipes, growing in urgency and volume.  Vincent stops
  dead in his tracks to listen.

                                              CATHY
                        Vincent... what is it?

                                              VINCENT
                        Shh...

    Vincent continues to listen.

                                              VINCENT
                        There's a message... from Pascal.
                                            (then)
                        Come with me, quickly.

  They turn on their heels and run together, back the way they came, into the
  bowels of the earth.


  Yates and Davis are seated, listening to Keller, who's pacing...

                                            KELLER
                        I don't believe this.  What are we doing?                                                                                            52


                                              YATES
                        Only what's necessary.  Nothing more and
                        nothing less.

  Over this, we HEAR a metallic clanking.  The noise only sharpens the fine
  edge that they're already on.

                                              KELLER
                                    (to Yates; flashing)
                        Why didn't you tell us there was a
                        witness --

                                              YATES
                                          (fight back)
                        What difference would that've made?
                                    (off Keller's silence)
                        I'll tell you: zip.

  As the CLANKING continues o.s....

                                              YATES
                        We'd be right where we are now.
                                    (to Davis, snapping)
                        Will you tell her to shut the hell up!

                                              DAVIS
                                    (with quiet strength)
                        Hey, don't talk to me like that.

  Beat.  Yates nods.  And Davis rises and moves.

73 THE BOILER ROOM73

  where Laura sits in shadow, each wrist hand-cuffed to a pipe.  She
    concentrates, tapping out a message... striking the pipes with her steel-
  bound wrists.

  DAVIS (O.S.)
  Hey, shut up.

  But Laura doesn't hear... until Davis' legs ENTER FRAME and he squats down to
  catch her wrist.  She looks up, terrified.

                                              DAVIS
                                      (as if to a dog)
                        No.

  Laura stops, but her eyes turn cold and defiant, as we:

                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                            53


74 OMITTED74


    Vincent and Cathy enter the organ-like pipe chamber.  Pascal is huddled in a
    corner, his ear pressed to a pipe.  The room is absolutely still, SILENT --
  no one is sending any messages.

                                              VINCENT
                          Pascal...

    Pascal turns to face him.

                                            PASCAL
                        I've put out an emergency all-quiet.

                                              VINCENT
                        Was it Laura?

                                            PASCAL
                                            (nodding)
                        We think so.  It was Outpost Six that
                        picked up her S.O.S. when the tapping
                        stopped.

                                              CATHY
                        Isn't there anything we can do?

                                            PASCAL
                                            (shrugs)
                        Wait...
                                  (off her disappointment)
                        But we're all waiting together, trying to
                        get a fix on her location.

                                                                  CUT TO:

75B A COLT .38 PYTHON 75B

  is unwrapped from an oil cloth, and we are:                                                                                            54



  Yates screws on a silencer with cold determination -- while Keller shakes his
  head.

                                            KELLER
                        No way.  I can't let you do this.

  Yates ignores him as he loads the gun, a bullet at a time.
  So Keller turns to Davis.

                                            KELLER
                                      (indicating Laura)
                        Jack, look at her.  She's just a girl.
                        What is she, a year older than Nancy?
                        Two?

  Davis reacts with a pang of remorse.

                                              YATES
                                            (exploding)
                        Shut up!

  As Yates moves threatening to Keller...

                                              YATES
                        I'm getting a little damn sick of having
                        to sugar coat everything for you.  That's
                        not my responsibility.

76A ANGLE   LAURA76A

    watching the heated argument.

                                              YATES
                        You wanted in on at the beginning, just
                        like the rest of us, for all the same
                        reasons: you gotta wife, car, kids,
                        mortgage payments -- all starting to
                        weigh heavy on a cop's salary.

  Laura taps once -- then again, glancing furtively toward the outer room.

76B LAURA'S POV76B

  where Yates and Keller argue MOS, leaving Laura's tapping unheeded.                                                                                            55


76C RESUME LAURA76C

  as she continues tapping.

                                                                  CUT TO:


  as one of the waiting denizens reacts to the faint TAPPING, and immediately
  begins tapping on another pipe.

                                                                  CUT TO:


  as another denizen picks up the message and passes it on...

                                                                  CUT TO:


  as one of the pipes come alive.  Pascal moves closer to listen as the tapping
    continues:

                                            PASCAL
                        That's it.  They've found her.  She's
                        in...
                                        (surprised look)
                        Brooklyn --?  We'll have the coordinates
                        in a minute.

  Cathy turns hopefully to Vincent, as we:

                                                                  CUT TO:


                                            KELLER
                        If you kill that girl, the blood's on
                        your hands.

                                              YATES
                        You know the law as well as me.  It's on
                        all of our hands.

  Long, hard beat.  Keller shakes his head.

                                            KELLER
                        No.  Not this time.  I'm leaving.                                                                                            56


                                              YATES
                        You're not going anywhere.

                                              KELLER
                        Stop me.

  He turns his back on Yates and starts for the door.  Slowly, Yates raises the
    silenced pistol and aims at the retreating Keller.

77 KELLER77

    glances at Laura as he goes.  When he reaches the door, he puts his hand on
  the knob and squeezes his eyes shut... expecting the bullet in his back, and:

78 YATES78

  holds the gun steady.  Davis moves INTO FRAME and grasps Yates' forearm,
    shaking his head.

                                              DAVIS
                                          (low, even)
                        Forget it, man.

79 KELLER79

  opens his eyes.  He turns the knob and exits the basement alive.

                                                                  CUT TO:


    running at great speed...

                                                                  CUT TO:


                                              YATES
                        You should've let me...                                                                                            57


                                              DAVIS
                                            (overriding)
                        C'mon man, you're talking crazy.

                                              YATES
                        Yeah?  Whatta you think he's gonna do
                        now?  Go to confession?

  Yates shakes his head, disgusted that he allowed Keller to leave.  And Davis'
  face reveals that Yates' argument, however grim, makes perfect sense.

                                              DAVIS
                        You want me to go after him?

                                              YATES
                                              (beat)
                        No. I'll get him as soon as I'm done
                        here.

                                                                  CUT TO:


  Yates is standing at the entrance to the boiler room, his gun pointed at
  Laura, when the lights go off.  Black water darkness.  Davis is next to him,
  his face averted...

                                              YATES
                        Keller!

                        What the --

                                              YATES
                        Don't worry, the emergency system'll kick
                        in.

  Just then, the emergency lights do go on -- two spots from a metal box
    mounted above the door.                                                                                            58


                                              DAVIS
                                            (nervous)
                        Get it over with, man.

  Yates is raising the gun, when...

83 VINCENT83

    roaring, vaults in through the transom window -- glass cascading around him,
  like drops of water.

84 YATES84

  wheels and fires a wild shot over Vincent's shoulder.

85 ANGLE   LAURA85

    looking away in fear.

86 VINCENT86

    charges and catches Yates in full stride plowing him back into the boiler
  room container.  On impact the gun SPITS again... the bullet slamming into:

87 DAVIS'87
  chest.

88 RESUME SCENE88

    Stunned, Yates tries to level the gun at Vincent, but Vincent seizes the
  cop's wrist, breaks it, and then drives his claw into the smaller man's mid-
    section.  Yates' lifeless body slumps out of Vincent's grasp, to the
    ground...

    Vincent moves toward Laura, who now turns to see.  Vincent kneels before her,
  and wraps her free arm around his neck.  As SIRENS begin to wail in the
    distance, fast approaching, we:

                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                            59



    drinking from a water fountain.  She straightens and turns, when:

90 ANOTHER ANGLE90

  as she nearly bumps into Maxwell.

                                              CATHY
                                            (startled)
                        Joe --

    There's an awkward moment between them.  They both want to say something.
    Maxwell breaks the ice.

                                              MAXWELL
                                          Look, I'm...
                                  (re: her healing bruises)
                        I'm sorry about what happened.  I know
                        it's been tough on you, and I didn't make
                        it any easier.

                                              CATHY
                        No, you didn't.

                                              MAXWELL
                                    (taking it on the chin)
                        I let it get personal.  I was stubborn --
                        and I was wrong...

                                              CATHY
                                  (smiles, extends her hand)
                        Apology accepted.

                                              MAXWELL
                        Good.

  They shake hands.  But something disturbing occurs to Cathy.  She regards
    Maxwell a bit apprehensively, as:

                                              CATHY
                        Joe.  About your father --

                                              MAXWELL
                                  (overriding; dismissive)
                        No.  I had no right bringing that up when
                        I did.

                                              CATHY
                        You had every right.  And I'm glad you
                        told me.                                                                                            60


                                              MAXWELL
                        Yeah...

  But Maxwell isn't at all comfortable with this kind of intimacy.  Reading
  this Cathy changes the subject.

                                              CATHY
                        Listen: why don't you walk me to Moreno's
                        office?  It's time for my weekly progress
                        report.

    Maxwell nods and:

91 MOVING WITH THEM91

    through the busy office.

                                              MAXWELL
                        You might wanna know.  Jackson's being
                        released today.
                                  (a bitter afterthought)
                        I just hope he doesn't ram it down our
                        throats.

  Cathy smiles as Maxwell's paranoia, then:

                                              CATHY
                        How'd the Keller interrogation go this
                        morning?

                                              MAXWELL
                        Guy's pretty shaken up, but he sang.  The
                        two keys we recovered from Yates'
                        basement came from the Ricardo bust last
                        month -- which both sets of partners were
                        on.

                                              CATHY
                        So when Perotta started getting nervous,
                        Yates killed him and set up Jackson.
                                            (beat)
                        Simple enough.

                                              MAXWELL
                        Only Yates didn't count on your witness
                        being there.

    They've come to Moreno's door, before which Cathy pauses.                                                                                            61


                                              MAXWELL
                        Speaking of which: where on earth did you
                        find that witness?

                                              CATHY
                          I didn't.
                                    (smile; innocent shrug)
                        She found me.

  With which Cathy pushes open the door, and enters Moreno's office.

                                                                  CUT TO:
