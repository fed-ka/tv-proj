      Holy fuck.  It s even worse in here.  Furniture is stacked on 
      top of each other.  The floor is littered with pizza boxes, 
      two kegs, empty liquor bottles and the ping-pong table has a 
      jigsaw left in it, after carving out various shapes.  We find 
      DERS sleeping under the table, wearing a speedo over his 
      clothes, goggles, and swim cap on his head.         

      As he wakes up and heads outside, the camera leads him... 


      The guys approach the kitchen.  Blake is dripping wet, Ders 
      still sporting swim gear, Adam, forty-oz hands, weight belt.

                                  ADAM
                    God this house reeks. 

                                  DERS
                    Maybe it s your upper lip.

                                  ADAM
                    Ohhh, good one.  Burrrrrn.  I m 
                    burnt.  You re burning me.

                                  BLAKE
                    No seriously.  Do you not remember 
                    giving yourself a poop mustache and 
                    running around calling yourself 
                    Adolf Shitler?

                                  ADAM
                    I do.  That was early.  Weirdly 
                    early.  Everything after that, no 
                    clue.

                                  DERS
                    So what time did everything end?

                                  CREEPY GUY (O.S.)
                    Who said it s over?

      REVEAL a 45 y/o CREEPY GUY, ratty jeans, walking middle 
      finger tattoo, no shirt, cooking eggs and drinking a tall 
      boy.

      FADE IN:


      Anders escorts the Creepy Guy out, starts to close the door. 

                                  CREEPY GUY
                    What s the rush?  There s beer left

                    Your omelettes are spectacular, but

                    That s the hangover talking.  It s 
                    not just a funny movie starring 
                    Mike Tyson.  Let s down a couple 
                    beers and we ll be fine.

      Adam grabs three beers from nearby. 

                                  BLAKE
                    No, no, no.  We re not sixteen.  We 
                    can t drink like this anymore.

                    Come on, Blake, it s the only way

                                                                              (CONTINUED)              Workaholics - Dry Guys - Network Draft - 1/21/11            10.

      CONTINUED: (3)

      Everyone unearths A LOT of stupid alcohol from their desks 
      and hidden spots in the cubicle (including under the fake 
      plant Adam revealed earlier).  Bottles of Kahlua, a sixer of 
      Ed Hardy Beer, ridiculously giant bottles of cheap gin, etc.  
      Ders takes a handle of nice gin on some Mad Men steeze.  They 
      pile it all into a trash can in the middle of the cubicle.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                    OK, that s everything?  Nothing 
                    left?

      The guys nod.  Blake hands the basket of booze to HOME GIRL.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                    This is for you.

      Home Girl checks it out.

                                  HOME GIRL
                    Oh fuck yes.  Jehovah shines on me.


      The guys are on calls.  Adam eats cold turkey.  Suddenly Ders 
      notices Adam licking his headset mic.  

                                  DERS
                    What s up with your headset?

                                  ADAM
                    What s up with... your oldness?  
                    God you re so old, Blon-Ders.  

      Adam tries to hi-five Blake, who leaves him hanging.  Ders 
      slides towards Adam.

                                  DERS
                    You just licked your mic.

      Adam turns away. 

                                  ADAM
                    Dude, get out of my area.  This is 
                    my office.  

                                  BLAKE
                    Is that...?  

      Blake reaches out to touch Adam s headset. 

                                  ADAM
                    Stop!  Get out of my office!




                                                                              (CONTINUED)              Workaholics - Dry Guys - Network Draft - 1/21/11            11.

                    That s booze isn t it?

      Blake grabs Adam s headset off his head.   

                                  ADAM
                    Gimme that! 

      Adam tries to grab it, but Blake throws it to Ders, who holds 
      it above him.   

                                  DERS
                          (to Blake)
                    Would ya lookie here.  This dude 
                    rigged a mini bottle into his 
                    headset. 

      WE SEE that Adam has rigged his headset so that the 
      microphone is actually a small straw (that he s sharpie d 
      black) which is attached to a tiny bottle of alcohol which is 
      cleverly attached to his earpiece.   

                                  BLAKE
                    I have to admire your ingenuity, 
                    but Ders...
                          (as Alan Rickman)
                    ...Crush zee prototype.

      Ders smashes it!

                                  ADAM
                    What the fuck?  It took me many 
                    nights of tinkering to make that!

                                  BLAKE
                    We took an oath, remember?  

                                  DERS
                    Why do you think you re special?

                                  ADAM
                    Because my Mom told me I am and 
                    Penny DeMamp is a truth teller, on 
                    some real levels.  Why do you think 
                    you can boss me around, Slim Shady?

                                  BLAKE
                    Guys, guys come on--

      Adam grabs Ders  poster and RIPS IT.  

                                  ADAM
                    Bam.  Boss move.

      As Adam and Ders approach each other, Blake steps in.

                                  BLAKE
                    Hey!  
                          (they stop)
                    I know we re all on edge.  This is 
                    hard.  Really hard.  But I think I 
                    know one thing that might cool us 
                    out.  

      Blake takes a BAG OF WEED out of his pocket.

                                  BLAKE (CONT D)
                    Dank Williams Junior.  Just got it 
                    from Karl.  

                                  DERS
                    Weed?  Sober means sober.  No beer, 
                    no weed, no nothing.  

      Adam snatches the weed and starts to dump it out.

                                  BLAKE
                    Adam.  Wait, no, don t...

                    We took an oath, remember!  

      Adam dumps all the weed into the garbage.  

                                  BLAKE
                      NOOOOOOOO!!!!  You dump my 
                    property.  I dump yours!

      The guys start putting each others belongings into the trash 
      as it escalates from pen holders and headsets to phones and 
      keyboards.  They look up and...

      REVEAL ALICE watching them.  

                                  ALICE
                    Hi.  

      OFF the guys...

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Alice sits in her chair.  The guys stand.  Busted.

                                  ADAM
                    Before you say anything, just know 
                    that we are pretty severe 
                      alcoholics and we re trying to go 
                    sober.

                                  DERS
                    It s been hard, it s caused some 
                    friction between us, but we re 
                    trying.

      Alice softens. 

                                  ALICE
                    Really?  I didn t realize that.  
                    How long has it been since you had 
                    your last drink?

                                  BLAKE
                          (calculating)
                    Just... over... fifteen hours.  
                    Hold the applause.

                                  ALICE
                      I understand what you re going 
                    through.  I m three years sober 
                    myself.

                                  THE GUYS
                    WHOA!

                                  ADAM
                    Sounds like you had a real problem.

                                  DERS
                    We re not looking to go sober-
                    sober.  That s weird.

                                  BLAKE
                    Yeah, we re just pumping the 
                    brakes.  Doing the Hollywood 
                    cleanse.

                    OK, here s the deal.  Go see Eric 
                    in HR.  He runs a substance abuse 
                    course.  Once you do that, you can 
                    clock back in.  

                                  ADAM
                    I m not sure we need a course--

                                  ALICE
                    Or I can fire you.


      Guys walk and talk. 

                                  DERS
                    Wow.  We re lucky to be alive.

                                  ADAM
                    She mos def could have axed the 
                    Brothers McMuffins.  That s us.

                                  BLAKE
                    I like that.  But I don t have a 
                        sub-whatever-she-said problem.

                                  DERS
                    I don t know, maybe we do.

                                  ADAM
                    Maybe we do, maybe we don t.  It s 
                    all up in the air.  I think I ll go 
                    pinch out a growler and meet you 
                    nerds at the headshrinkers  office.

                                  DERS
                    Hurry up, we re supposed to go over 
                    there right now. 

                                  ADAM
                    Oh okay, yeah I ll speed up my 
                    bowel movements so I m not two 
                    minutes late to some meeting. 

      And Adam walks off, tearing stuff off the hallway corkboard.


      Ders and Blake take their seats.  There s a MEXICAN DUDE 
      sitting in the corner.  




                                                                              (CONTINUED)              Workaholics - Dry Guys - Network Draft - 1/21/11            15.

                    Guess this is it.  Adam better 
                    hurry up.  It s like the guy never

                    I m gonna sock you in the mouth in 
                    like two seconds if you don t stop

                    It s not crap, it s FARTS!

      Then COOL ERIC the HR Rep and Substance Abuse supervisor 
      enters in full crotch-rocket riding gear; helmet, Teflon 
      jumpsuit with back-brace, booties, etc.  He overheard Ders 
      chew Blake out.  As he pulls off his riding gear...

                    Whoa, TMI, I don t even wanna know.

                    I was just--

      Eric tosses his helmet, spins a chair around, and sits down

                    No, relax, it happens to the best

      Ders and Blake realize what s up, but Cool Eric is oblivious 
      as he goes into his bag.

                                  COOL ERIC
                    Well, I hope you re hungry Adam 
                     cause I ve got sandwiches for 
                    everyone.  Ham.  Turkey.  You guys 
                    like Tuna?
                          (tosses Tuna to Blake and 
                            Ders)
                    Tuna Brothers.

      Cool Eric turns the lights off and throws the DVD in.  Ders 
      and Blake whisper.

                                  DERS
                    Where is he?

                    pissed.  He loves this movie.

      Ders looks at the Mexican Dude, then realizes.  He sneaks a 
      peek out the window to see...


      Adam playing pick-up soccer with some construction workers.

                                  ADAM

      FADE IN:


      Anders is still looking out the window, he turns, nudges 
      Blake and signals him to look.  Blake spots Adam too.

                                  BLAKE
                    He just bailed on us?  What s that 
                    about?  I mean, it s a brilliant 
                    idea, but--

                                  DERS
                    But he could have brought us in on 
                    it.  That s Adam though.  Maybe he 
                    can be friends with those guys from 
                    now on.

                                  BLAKE
                          (jealous, then...)
                    They do look cool.  Hard hats and 
                    jeans, that s  bout to be my next 
                    look.  With the hair going out the 
                    sides?  Ooooooh.  But yeah, this 
                    Adam situation is bullshit.


      Ders and Blake see the offering.  The Mexican Dude is really 
      laughing at the movie in the BG.              Workaholics - Dry Guys - Network Draft - 1/21/11            19.



      Ders and Blake see Adam with the beer, jump to their feet, 
      and run out the door.

                                  COOL ERIC
                    Whoa, guys.  You want me to pause it?
                          (to Mexican Dude)
                    Must ve been the tuna, right.

                                    MEXICAN DUDE
                    I am Adam.


      Cool Eric has lost his cool.  He ices his face.  The guys sit 
      in front of him, looking guilty.

                                  COOL ERIC
                    Guys, I gotta be square with ya. 
                    You got me really confused right 
                    now.  One minute we re laughing at 
                    the  Don t Touch My Drums  scene, 
                    where he puts his nuts on the 
                    snare, next thing I know, I got a 
                    Tecate Light in my face.  What the 
                    F, dudes?  Do you not like Step 
                    Brothers?

                                  DERS/BLAKE
                    It s funny. / Love it.

                                  ADAM
                          (disappointed)
                    You guys watched Step Brothers?  I 
                    love that movie.

                                  COOL ERIC
                    Me too, but now the movie s off and 
                    you can forget about the deleted 
                    scenes too.  Instead we re doing 
                    the workbook.  The whole thing.

      Blake holds up his Drawing; A beer with lighting bolts behind 
      it.  Ders adds finishing touches, then reveals his Drawing; 
      It s a bottle of vodka.  Adam s Drawing; It s a soccer shin-

      CUT TO:  Blake reads his letter.

                                  BLAKE
                    And I want a Super Nintendo, with

                    cravings.  So let s stand across 
                    from each other and get our 
                    breathing and movements in sync.  I 
                    want you to mirror each other. 
                    Create the calm.

      The guys slip into aggressive HUFFING and PUFFING and 
      sneaking F YOU gestures behind Cool Eric s back.  He catches 
      them.

                    Alright, next exercise is Role 
                    Playing with Sock Puppets.  I know 
                    it sounds a little kooky, but with 
                    the right attitude, it can work.  
                    Ball s in your court, gentlemen.

      Cool Eric hands out socks, markers, yarn, googly eyes and 
      other crafts and the guys get to making their socks.

      CUT TO:  We see each of the guys really cool socks that 
      resemble themselves.  Blake has used his shoe laces to make 
      his hair and mustache, Adam drew six-pack abs on the body of 
      his, and Ders pasted a cut-out of Ryan Phillippe s face on 
      his.

                    He s right, Blake.  You need to put

                    something that s as real as it

                    because I know that the day I  grow

                    He s right.  I m sorry too.  I know 
                    I can be a little self-centered 
                      sometimes, but I never heard  no  
                    growing up and now that I ve 
                    clocked 10,000 hours of being a 
                    brat, I m a total self-serving 
                    Outlier and that s not how Adam 
                     The Main Attraction  DeMamp wants 
                    to live.

      Now all the guys are heard sniffling, holding back sobs.

                                  DERS PUPPET
                    Hey, man, it s hard to say no to 
                    that face.  For real.  And I m 
                    sorry that I can be so controlling.  
                    I worry about you guys and want the 
                    best for you.  I need to 
                      acknowledge that sometimes I don t 
                    know what s best, but that scares 
                    me.

                                  BLAKE PUPPET
                    Life is scary.

                                  ADAM PUPPET
                    I m glad we ve got each other to 
                    get through it.  And I ll go right 
                    ahead and say it...
                          (pours heart)
                    ...I will always like you guys.

                                  DERS PUPPET
                    I like you too man.  I like both of 
                    you a lot.

                                  BLAKE PUPPET
                    I like you guys so much and I m not 
                    ashamed of it.  I.  Like.  You 
                    guys.

      The guys ad-lib saying  I like you  as their puppets hug.

      ANGLE ON:  Cool Eric, astonished.  He slowly stands.

                                  COOL ERIC
                    Wow.  That was intense.  I think 
                    you made some real progress there.  
                    You focused on what s really 
                    happening beneath the surface and 
                    what s gotten in the way of that 
                      realization, i.e. alcohol.  
                    Congrats, guys.  You pass. 

      Cool Eric gives a sideways Peace Sign.  The guys are finished 
      talking behind the puppets and rub their reddened eyes dry.

                                  COOL ERIC (CONT D)
                    Here s your release and you can set 
                    the puppets down on the way out.

                          (sentimental)
                    Actually I d like to keep mine, if 
                    you don t mind.

                                  ADAM/DERS
                    Yeah me too. / Same.

                                  COOL ERIC
                    I keep all puppets.

      Weird guy.  The guys set the puppets down and exit.


      Same stripper as before, but the guys couldn t be happier.  
      She is now the most gorgeous woman on Earth (to them).  

      Blake holds out some cash for another STRIPPER.

                                  BLAKE
                    FWOOP!  That means, Thank you.  I m 
                    making an App that translates your 
                    farts.

                                  STRIPPER
                    Baby, that sounds amazing.  Now, 
                    give big mama some money.

      Ders helps Blake put the money into her thong the right way.

                                  DERS
                    Come on, you gotta graze her skin 
                    then put it under.  See the goose 
                    bumps?  She s feeling you, dude.

      Blake smiles with Ders.

                                  ADAM
                    Yeah she is.  I don t even mind her 
                    pregnancy scar.  

                                  DERS
                    Shit I like it!

                                  BLAKE
                    These chicks get it!

      They toast drinks and the DJ comes over the loudspeakers...

                                  DJ (O.C.)
                    Let s hear it for Eunice.  Coming 
                    to the stage now, the seductive 
                    Karen.  And private dances are half-

      ANGLE ON:  The DJ in his booth.  It s the Creepy Dude who was 
      cooking them eggs at the beginning of the episode.  

                                  ADAM
                    That guy is awesome!

      Adam goes over.

                                  ADAM (CONT D)
                    Hey, buddy, my name is Adam.  You 
                    should definitely roll back to our 
                    place to party and bring Eunice and 
                    co.

                                  CREEPY GUY

                    Heil Shitler.

      Adam gives him a smile, but he s confused because he has no 
      idea that Creepy Guy knows him as Adolf Shitler from the week 
      before.

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:
