          We're tracking along with a young boy who's wearing a
            miniature motorcycle cop's helmet as he furiously peddles
          a "Big Wheel"-style tricycle along a stretch of sidewalk.

          There's a tongue-in-cheek echo of the Big Wheel sequence
          in "The Shining" as plastic wheels thrum over sidewalk
          cracks, dip and rise across driveway aprons, until our
          rider spots an obstacle up ahead:


          BIG WHEEL RIDER'S POV - TWO HAPLESS GUYS

          walking along and none too fast.  One's even got a cane.


          CLOSE ON BIG WHEEL RIDER

          Steely eyes squint, then a little hand reaches for an
          impressive apparatus on the handlebars.  There's a sudden
          siren burst -- WHOOP!  WHOOP!  WHOOP!


          JOHNNY AND BRUCE

          jump aside as the police-themed Big Wheel plows by.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jeez!
                                (they resume walking)
                        Didn't think I was going fast
                        enough to get pulled over.

                                        BRUCE
                        Believe me, you ain't.

                                        JOHNNY
                        C'mon, I'm smokin' here.

          Now a speed-walking 70-YEAR-OLD WOMAN wearing headphones
          and carrying hand weights breezes past.  Johnny sighs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay.  The summer Olympics are
                        out.

          He looks up ahead and his expression darkens.


          JOHNNY'S APPROACHING POV - A MAILBOX

          looms at the end of his driveway, leaning slightly on its
          post like some ominous totem.  (Note: The PT Cruiser should
          be parked in the driveway).


          RESUME JOHNNY & BRUCE

                                        JOHNNY
                        Wonder what'll it be today.

                                        BRUCE
                                (teasing)
                        Another rubber rattlesnake... or
                        maybe a live one.

          They come to a stop by the mailbox and a recycling bin.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (catching his breath)
                        I'd settle for snakes.  It's those
                          bubble-wrapped "offerings" that
                        creep me out.
                                (mock shudder)
                        "Can you touch this chew toy and
                        find my Kathy's poodle?..."

          During the above, Bruce has opened the mailbox, pulling
          out a slim stack of mail.

                                        BRUCE
                        No bubble wrap.  You're in luck.

                        Bill.  Bill.  Credit card.

          He holds up a colorful "Publisher's Clearing House"-type
          sweepstakes envelope, reads off it.

                                        BRUCE
                        "You may have just won ten million
                          dollars!"

          He makes like "The Great Karnak," closing his eyes and

          holding the envelope to his forehead for a studied beat.

                                        BRUCE
                        Nope.

          Johnny opens the recycling bin and Bruce tosses it in.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not bad, Karnak.

                                        BRUCE
                        Beginner's luck.

                        County Courthouse.  Any overdue
                          tickets?

          Johnny shrugs, gives him a little nod.  Bruce opens it,
          pulls out a PINK SUMMONS, scans it and reacts.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's a jury summons.
                                (off Johnny's surprise)
                        Don't worry, I'll write you a
                          doctor's note.  "Still recovering
                        from coma."

          Johnny smiles, reaches for the summons.  But as his hand
          closes on it...

                                        WOMAN JUROR (O.S.)
                        Guilty.

          Johnny turns toward the sound, only now he's in:





          A red brick and colonnaded edifice that harks back to
          colonial times.



          A quick shot of Feather being held from behind by one
          young Male Assailant -- her eyes wide in fear above the
          hand clamped over her mouth -- while a Second Assailant
          rips her blouse.


  1818RESUME - JURY ROOM

          Johnny looks after her, reacting to this far more
          disturbing flash, as they each take their seats.

                                        NIGHT SCHOOL
                        Well, anyone actually want the
                        job?

          Martha clears her throat, but before she can speak...

                                        FAN MAN
                        I don't know if he's interested,
                        but I nominate Mister Smith.

                                (off surprised looks, 
                                  Johnny's included)
                        Well, I think it makes sense to
                        put a certified psychic in charge.

                                        BRASSY

                                (to Johnny)
                        No offense.

          This gets some chuckles, but the uneasiness with Johnny's
          presence is palpable.  Leading Citizen seems particularly
          annoyed by this foolishness.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        Look, can we please be serious
                        here...

          Martha sees her opening.

                        Not to slight Mister Smith's
                          "credentials," but I am the

                        Sister, if you want it, you can
                        have it.

          A murmur of assent seals the deal as meanwhile...


          JOHNNY

          finds his eyes drawn to...


          THE EVIDENCE EXHIBITS ON THE TABLE 

          Idly, he reaches out and starts to sift through them...

                                        SPORTS NUT
                                  (impatient)

  1919RESUME

                                        MARTHA
                                (beat)
                        Guilty.

          She looks to her right, toward Juror #2, Feather, who
          takes a beat and then, very quietly:

                                        FEATHER
                        Guilty.

          The CAMERA now begins PANNING around the table, framing
          the other jurors as they also vote "Guilty" in the same
          sequence as in Johnny's original vision.  We INTERCUT
          with Johnny as he realizes this.  At about the same time,
          he picks up the DEFENDANT'S KEYCHAIN and as he does...


          CAMERA PIVOTS 180 DEGREES INTO A SPLIT REALITY

          At one end of the table, the "guilty" vote continues; but
          on Johnny's end -- as if the table is a pier protruding
          into another reality -- a NEW SETTING takes shape:



            A CONVICT in a BRIGHT ORANGE JUMPSUIT moves behind Carl
          Winters and knifes him in the back with a shiv.  He goes
          down.  (Note: the prison garb should be notably different
          than the earlier prison shot involving Vic.) 

                                        MARTHA
                        Number Twelve...?


          NEW ANGLE

          as Johnny turns to her.  Only now the prison is gone and
          the other jurors are looking at him expectantly.

                                        MARTHA
                        Mister Smith?  Your vote?

          A beat as Johnny makes a difficult decision.  Then:

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not guilty.

          As the others react with surprise and suspicion...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          clothes, is walking a TINY DOG along the edge of the
          parking lot when an OLD CONVERTIBLE tricked out with
          chromed rims and a bright paint job barrels into the lot. 
          Winters is at the wheel, a tough-looking teen-aged buddy
          riding shotgun, another in the back.  RAP MUSIC BOOMS
          from multiple speakers, overwhelming the faint strains of
            CLASSICAL MUSIC coming from an old transistor RADIO clipped
          to the breast of Johnny's jacket.

          Irritated, Johnny watches the convertible pull up in front
          of the convenience store, passing a parked econo car. 
          The three boys spill out and rambunctiously enter the
          store.

          Johnny's about to walk away when he notices a third 
          vehicle -- an old Chrysler SEDAN -- idling in a far corner
          of the lot.  The car has a subtle "Christine" vibe -- an
          ominous feeling we can pick up on.  Johnny eyes it
          curiously, trying to see if anyone's at the wheel, but
          it's too dark.  Then his dog tugs on the leash and he
          walks on.


  22A22ACLOSE ON JOHNNY

          As he turns... revealing we're back in the jury room... 
          only a second has passed in real time.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There were three cars.

          A beat as the others fall silent, puzzled by the non
            sequitur.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        Three cars?  What do you mean,
                        three cars?

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (repeating)
                        There's a discrepancy in the
                        witness testimony. 
                                (beat)
                        Both witnesses said there were
                        just two cars in the parking lot,
                        but one of them -- the Old Man --
                          actually saw three.

                                        NIGHT SCHOOL
                        Two, three, what's the difference?

          Johnny's doubt is largely instinctive, a response to that
          ominous car, but Agatha Christy immediately understands
          what it means:



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: UNREASONABLE DOUBT - ACT TWO - 04/29/02 - YELLOW  23.

                                        AGATHA CHRISTY
                        The difference, if it's true, is
                        there could've been another witness
                        who didn't come forward... or
                        even another suspect.  

                                        GOTH GUY
                                (puzzled, to Johnny)
                        Wait a second.  I heard the old
                        guy say in court there were two
                        cars, didn't I?

                        I heard it too.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We all did.  But it's not what he
                        told the police in his affidavit.

          And he puts the document back onto the table.  A beat of
            surprise, then Agatha Christy skeptically picks up the
            document, dons her reading glasses and starts turning the
          pages, using her index finger to guide her through the
          text...


          HER POV - CLOSE ON THE AFFIDAVIT

          As seen through the magnifying lenses: the text ENLARGED,
          the field of view slightly distorted around the edges. 
          The tip of Agatha Christy's index finger moves down a
            paragraph describing the Old Man's account -- and stops
          on the word "three."


          RESUME

          as she looks up, surprised.

                                        AGATHA CHRISTY
                        Why, he's right.  The witness did

                        when he testified?

          They all look at him, incredulous... Johnny notes Fan Man
          staring at him; he tries to avoid the look but it's
            impossible...

                        If it was so important, the defense
                        would have said something about
                        it in court.

                        Is this part of your nightclub
                        act?  If so, pick another venue
                        next time, will you?

          Johnny sighs.  If the others are going to make an issue
          over this -- over him -- then he's going to at least put
          the emphasis where he believes it belongs.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We're here to find out the truth. 
                        I can't just ignore what I know.

          Now, for the first, Leading Citizen begins to lose a little
          of that rigid self-control...

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        What you "know?"

                        Do you believe that?  "What he

                                (growing frustration)
                        That kid Winters is guilty.  We
                        have to find him guilty.  And no
                          sideshow "medium" is going to
                          convince me otherwise.

                          disembodied spirits.  Mister
                        Smith's visions, as I understand
                        them, are touch-initiated and
                        involve abilities such as
                          "psychometry," or sensing images,
                          histories and impressions from
                          objects; "clairvoyance:" sensing
                        events in the past and future;
                        some "clairsentience" perhaps...

          He realizes the others are staring at him as if he just
          grew a third eyeball.  Even Johnny's taken aback.

          A long beat as he stares down at the table.

          Then Leading Citizen rises, barely able to contain his
          disgust at the direction these deliberations have taken.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        Fine.

          He stands and crosses to the small evidence table...

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        If you think that Carl Winters
                        didn't kill that man, then
                          please...

          He picks up the gun, SMACKS it down in front of Johnny.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                        ...tell us who did.

          He steps back a bit and eyes Johnny.  An odd, expectant
          beat as Johnny studies the gun in front of him, and then,
          somewhat gingerly, picks it up...  SUDDENLY THE SCENE
          PIVOTS AROUND JOHNNY AND CHANGES TO...





          as Johnny/Female Witness -- terrified, humiliated -- rushes
          from the store.  'She' gets to her car, fumbles frantically
          trying to unlock the door, as she sees Kid One and Kid
          Two exit and get into the convertible.  Finally, she gets
          the door open -- just as there's a muffled "popping" SOUND
          from inside the store.  (We've heard the sound of the
          beer bottles breaking in Johnny's prior vision and that's
          what we're hearing here.)

            Johnny/Female Witness is behind the wheel now, trying to
          start the engine as Winters exits, jumps in the driver's
          seat and high-five Kid One.  He starts up his car -- and
          the RAP MUSIC BLASTS AGAIN (and this would presumably
          cover the sound of the real gunshot, which will happen in
          the next moment) -- before he backs up and ROARS out of
          the lot.  And as we rotate into a dual reality -- to see
          the jury sitting at their table, seemingly in the parking
          lot, looking at --


          JOHNNY

          who turns to see - in a rack focus - the face of Feather...
          and we're back --



          As before, we see Leading Citizen, in a youth league
          coach's jacket, as he soundlessly shouts encouragement at
          a young boy going for a lay-up -- until his eyes go past
          him to the tricked-out SUV slowly rounding the corner, a
            passenger window powering down as a young gangbanger with
          a GUN leans out.  Moving to find Johnny standing there,
          watching as --


          ANGLE - LEADING CITIZEN

          is rushing toward the basket, shouting again soundlessly,

          the boy with the ball turning to him, puzzled, while the
          teen-agers on the sidewalk behind him duck for cover. 
          And then Leading Citizen is gathering up the wounded body
          of the boy, overwhelmed with shock and despair... carrying
          him in his arms to find help... as the vision ends.


  4343RESUME - JURY ROOM

          As Leading Citizen continues to confront Johnny.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN (CONT'D)
                        ...The man is guilty.  Guilty.

                        Who's guilty?  Winters, or the
                        gangbanger who almost killed your
                        son?

          And this time Leading Citizen just stares at Johnny for a
          stunned instant -- and then lashes out, SHOVING him hard! 
          The others react with alarm and concern, the men rising
          to restrain Leading Citizen.  Johnny waves them off.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's okay.  Leave him alone.

          He picks up his cane, then steps forward again, silently
          facing Leading Citizen.  A long look between the two men
          as Leading Citizen absorbs what he's done... a gamut of
          emotions playing across his face as anger gives way to
          grief, and the realization that Johnny's right - he's
          brought his own distinct bias into these deliberations. 
          He turns, takes in the faces of the other jurors -- not
          judging him, most showing sympathy for what he's going
          through -- then he sags into his chair, drained.

                                        LEADING CITIZEN
                                (hoarse)
                        Is it possible?  Am I judging the
                        wrong man?

                        We all enter this room with our
                        pasts, Mr. Cartwright.  Every one
                        of us.    

          A beat, then he nods almost imperceptibly -- an admission
          less of defeat than of acceptance.
