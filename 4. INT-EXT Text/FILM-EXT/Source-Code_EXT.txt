The train hurls straight at us.
NEW ANGLE -- Skimming alongside as the train twists and
turns, sucking up track -- feet, yards, miles of it.
Beneath it, the curving rails, which the rushing train barely
seems to touch. They vibrate with an eerie, dulcimer HUM.
2.
Fuel lines explode in the other cars in a horrendous chain
reaction. The fire is spectacularly bright, lighting up the
windows of the rowhouse apartments facing the tracks.
Nearby TREES INCINERATE, mere matchsticks amid sheets of
flames.
On the rowhouses, a ALUMINUM DOOR MOLDINGS begin to MELT in
the intense heat.
One of the FREIGHT CARS, loaded down with coal, shuddering
from the blast, wobbles a few yards then PITCHES OVER --
ROLLING off the rails, tipping right off the elevated
tracks...
It FALLS through the air and SMASHES into the middle of an
traffic intersection below with a shattering force.
The cascade of EXPLOSIONS continues. Large portions of BOTH
TRAINS are ANNIHILATED, while the heat reduces the heavy-
gauge steel rails back to elemental, molten ore.
And then...
An odd sound, like a BALLOON loosing air or MACHINERY winding
down as we
DISSOLVE TO:
BRILLIANT WHITE. All sounds cease.
For exactly 1/3 OF A SECOND, a mysterious PATTERN OF LINES
appears. Like METAL RODS, maybe. RADIATING OUTWARDS. It
makes no sense. An abstract pattern.
Then it's gone. Many will not even see it.
12.
Now there is only darkness. Nothingness. Seconds pass.
The CLICK of an INTERCOM switching on.
GOODWIN (V.O.)
This is Beleaguered Castle.
The doors slide open.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Newark Station.
The Old Man, Derek and the College Kid get off. Guzman
hurries past them towards the station house.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
All aboard. Doors are closing.
Just before the doors close, Colter steps out onto the
platform. Eyes locked on Guzman -- who disappears inside the
station house.
The train PULLS OFF, leaving Colter behind. Did he make the
right move?
As he goes to pursue Guzman, Colter is struck by more sensory
IMPRESSIONS:
The STATION CLOCK. Its digital numerals flash 7:50 a.m.,
hurting Colter's eyes with their brightness.
The dying HISS of the rails as the train recedes down the
track.
The super-sharp glint of a PENNY embedded down in the gravel
of the tracks.
The melancholy SIGH of trees in the wind.
Pushing it all aside, he hurries after Guzman.
Guzman sits on a bench. Colter stops nearby him.
GUZMAN
I resent this. This is harassment.
You obviously work for someone.
FBI. CIA.
(BITTER)
I expected this reception in your
country.
COLTER
How are you going to pull this off?
That bomb has a cell phone
detonator. And I don't see a pay
phone around here. So I'm betting
you got a phone on you with the
number already programmed in.
GUZMAN
I have no idea what you're talking
about. I am an international
business man. An executive.
The tracks begin to VIBRATE. In the distance comes the HORN
of an EXPRESS TRAIN approaching.
COLTER
Open your briefcase. Prove to me
there's no phone in there.
27.
GUZMAN
(STANDS UP)
I will prove nothing to you. Leave
me alone.
WHAM! Colter PUNCHES Guzman with tremendous force, sending
Guzman sprawling to the ground.
Colter's hand throbs from the force of the punch. The
simulation's reality stuns Colter all over again.
Crouching down, Colter pops open Guzman's briefcase. Inside
is a corporate IDENTIFICATION BADGE with Guzman's name and
photograph on it. The company is Shell Oil.
COLTER
(READING)
"Hasnan Guzman, Vice President,
Shell Oil." Must be a cover.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Philadelphia train now approaching.
Guzman groans in pain. Colter rifles through his briefcase.
COLTER
Where the hell's your phone?
Another look at HIS WATCH -- 20 SECONDS.
Grabbing Guzman, Colter goes through his suit pockets. He
triumphantly pulls out GUZMAN'S CELL PHONE and steps back.
Guzman looks up at him, eyes moist with humiliation and
malice.
COLTER
I thought so. Now let's see you
try to --
A distant THUD rattles the station windows. Colter pivots,
looks down the tracks. The first thing he sees is
THE EXPRESS TRAIN
Closing in on the station.
The second thing he sees, far beyond it, miles further down
the tracks, is the RISING PLUME of a HUGE EXPLOSION.
Colter looks back at Guzman in shock. Then down at Guzman's
cell phone. Which has remained off.
28.
COLTER
You didn't do it.
Disbelief. As the din of the distant explosion is drowned
out by the ROAR of
THE ARRIVING EXPRESS TRAIN
With a cry of rage Guzman SPRINGS UP and PUSHES COLTER INTO
THE PATH OF THE ON-COMING EXPRESS TRAIN -- with a blast of
its horn, THE TRAIN RUNS HIM OVER.
Everything stops.
Like film celluloid catching fire in a projector, the world
itself BLISTERS AND BURNS INTO SEARING WHITE... into
smothering, forgetful SILENCE...
For exactly 2/3 of a second (1/3 of a second longer than
before), the same flickering after-image appears:
THIN LINES -- RADIATING OUTWARD --
This time they all connect into
THE SPOKES OF A WHEEL. A BICYCLE WHEEL.
THE TRAIN hurls down the tracks.
The disembarking passengers exit the platform.
Black smoke. Boots crunching on sand as we are borne,
P.O.V., a victim on a jostling stretcher.
The train pulls to a stop. Passengers begin to get off.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Newark Station.
The train doors shut. Colter is now out on the platform.
Christina is not there. Concerned, walking quickly forward,
Colter looks through the windows...
And finds her staring back at him. Still on the train. A
strange moment between the two of them.
Once again he's failed to save her.
They watch each other for as long as possible, until the
train pulls away.
The train comes to a halt. Unlike before, the doors stay
shut for SEVERAL SECONDS LONGER than usual. Derek waits
quietly at the doors.
Finally they open. Derek steps out onto the platform,
together with the Old Man, the College Kid and Guzman.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Newark Station.
Colter remains on board, standing in the exit area, watching.
As usual, Derek quickly flips his wallet onto the next car
and starts toward the station house. Guzman is ahead of him,
already pushing open the doors to the station.
All is quiet. Perhaps too quiet. Derek approaches the
station and sees
112.
THROUGH THE OPEN DOORS
In station lobby are POLICE OFFICERS.
Derek's jaw tightens. He changes course, heading instead for
an outdoor stairwell.
Coming UP the stairs, however, are more POLICE OFFICERS.
Wheeling around, Derek heads the other way. Walking faster,
but keeping his head. Not running, not panicking.
The train, oddly, is still sitting there.
As he nears the other end of the platform, MORE OFFICERS
appear from behind columns, cutting off his escape. The
police are coming from all sides, converging on the platform.
Yet no one panics. No one runs. Finally --
POLICE COMMANDER
(CALLING OUT)
Derek Frost.
Derek goes to get back on the train. The doors, however,
SLIDE SHUT in his face. Through the closed doors, Derek
looks in at Colter, still on the train. They stare at one
another through the window.
POLICE COMMANDER
Mr. Frost. Please turn to face us.
An entire PHALANX OF POLICE OFFICERS is on the platform.
DEREK
Of course. What's this about?
Unseen by the officers, Derek has taken out his CELL PHONE
and is DIALING IT as he turns around.
The police approach, cautiously.
POLICE COMMANDER
Place your hands in the air.
DEREK
My pleasure.
Raising his hands, he pushes SEND on his phone.
On board the train there's a RINGING.
113.
The train has been evacuated as police investigators search
the rest of the cars. Hoards of passengers fill the platform
as conductors try to herd them towards the station.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Ladies and gentlemen, rail service
has been cancelled. Please clear
the platform and proceed into the
station. New Jersey Transit
apologizes for the inconvenience.
Police cars parked everywhere. Two DETECTIVES are
questioning the Computer Engineer.
DETECTIVE
So you have no idea how your cell
phone was used to call in the tip?
115.
COMPUTER ENGINEER
No!
People mill about waiting for the buses, groaning and
complaining. Christina accosts a passing transit employee.
CHRISTINA
What now? How do we get to work?
You guys have some busses or
something?
The transit employee ignores her and walks away.
CHRISTINA
Hey! I'm talking to you!
She stands there in exasperation. This whole thing has been
designed to thwart her. Nearby, Colter sits on a bench.
COLTER
Ain't life grand?
Looking over, she notices him.
CHRISTINA
Yeah. Now I'm going get fired for
being late.
COLTER
Maybe that's a good thing.
She gives him a sharp look.
CLOSE ON - COLTER'S WATCH
It also reads 52 seconds.
His work is done. He's saved her. Saved them all. At least
this one time.
Only she doesn't know that. Christina stands there, arms
crossed, scowling at the parking lot.
CHRISTINA
Could this day get any worse?
COLTER
That train was taking you to a
place you didn't want to be. But
then you got off. And maybe that's
a sign.
117.
CHRISTINA
Yeah. If only.
She takes out her cell phone. The stress of her day.
CHRISTINA
I'm calling a cab. Maybe I'll only
be somewhat late for work.
Colter watches her, a quiet ache inside. Maybe some people
don't want to be saved.
Christina on the phone, waiting as it dials.
COLTER
Hey.
She turns. Colter gets up.
COLTER
You can do anything you want with
your life. Starting right now.
She's taken aback. He starts walking off.
CAB DISPATCH (V.O.)
Metro Cab Dispatch.
A long beat as she watches him.
118.
CAB DISPATCH (V.O.)
Hello...?
Click. She shuts her phone.
Beat. Is she crazy? She's baffled by her own action. And
by this unusual guy here.
CHRISTINA
Wait.
Colter turns. She crosses her arms archly.
CHRISTINA
You can't just expect someone to
change her life just like that. At
the very least... you'd have to buy
that person coffee and explain your
reasons.
She waits for his response. Uneasy at putting herself out
there.
Colter's watch ticks down to the final seconds. His last
moments in this world. He has only time enough for a final
look of reassurance.
COLTER
Maybe some other time.
Disappointment flickers on her face. She turns to go.
Behind her is a STONE WALL. A BICYCLE is parked against it.
Colter's breath catches in his throat. This is it! This is
the mysterious scene he's been seeing!
HIS WATCH - Hits ZERO.
Christina walks past the bicycle parked against the stone
wall. She's about to enter a TUNNEL that goes under the
tracks. The same tunnel from Colter's vision.
She stops. Something tells her to turn around.
The bench where Colter sat is empty.
But three feet away... Colter is standing there. Still here.
Dumbfounded, he looks at his watch -- it remains at ZERO.
He looks all around. Trees stirring in the breeze. A bird
flies overhead. The crowd of passengers outside the station.
CHRISTINA
You okay?
Colter turns to her. How can this be? He's afraid to even
speak. As if that alone could break the enchantment.
But the world is here. It goes on. That's all he knows.
Finally he swallows. Finding his voice.
COLTER
You're right. The least I can do
is buy you coffee.
This pleases Christina, although she tries not to show it.
CHRISTINA
Okay, well, come on then.
Walking forward, he joins her. The two of them disappear
down the tunnel.
A beautiful morning.
FADE OUT.
