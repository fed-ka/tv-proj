  [NEW MATERIAL] A SWIRL OF RED fades into existence. 
  Beautiful. Mesmerizing. We PULL BACK to reveal BLOOD spewing 
  in slow motion as a ROMAN GUARD lazily flies through the 
  FRAME, dying from massive wounds.

  RAMP TO NORMAL SPEED

  as he crashes to the ground, dead. THREE MORE GUARDS rush 
  in, stepping over their fallen comrade to confront the cause 
  of his brutal end.

  SPARTACUS

  greets them, his sword drawing fresh blood. He moves with 
  deadly purpose, striking the Guards down in a gory display. 
  NOBLE ROMANS scream as they rush to flee the slaughter. 
  Spartacus ignores them, bellowing for the only man he seeks.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Batiatus!

  A threat. A challenge. A promise of impending doom...



  [MATERIAL SHOT IN SEASON 1] Batiatus hustles through the 
  carnage with Lucretia, Domitia, Numerius, and Aurelia. They 
  stumble upon a dying Guard.

                                        GUARD

                        Why would she do such a thing --

  A Gladiator surges behind her, slicing her open in an 
  eruption of blood.

                                        NUMERIUS
                        Mother!

  CONTINUED:

  Batiatus grabs the dead Guard s sword and runs the Gladiator 
  through. Batiatus rips his sword free, shouts to Lucretia 
  and the others.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Go!

                        GO!

  Batiatus hustles off, sword clenched in trembling hand.



  [NEW MATERIAL] Several NOBLE ROMANS flee from two blood-
  splattered GLADIATORS. BATIATUS appears after they exit. 
  SCREAMS echo as the Gladiators catch up to their prey OFF 
  SCREEN. Batiatus considers his options, cautiously heads in 
  the opposite direction.

  FOLLOW BATIATUS

  as he weaves through the destruction. He holds his breath as 
  a pack of Gladiators pass nearby, hooting and laughing. He 
  turns to go, but is startled by a WOUNDED ROMAN staggering 
  out of the shadows.

                                          WOUNDED ROMAN
                                  sputtering blood)(
                        Help me! Please, Batiatus!

                                        BATIATUS
                        Still yourself, you fucking --

  Too late. A BURLY GLADIATOR appears, drawn by the noise. He 
  grins as he spots Batiatus, rushing for him. Batiatus 
  whirls, shoving the Wounded Roman in his path. Wounded Roman 
  gets a sword through his chest, but Burly Gladiator is 
  knocked to the ground.

  BATIATUS POUNCES,

    decapitating Burly Gladiator before he can recover. Batiatus 
  spits on the severed head in contempt as he moves on -- and 
  runs afoul of RHASKOS and a knot of blood-drenched warriors.





                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

  BATIATUS TAKES OFF,

  running for his life. Rhaskos and the others howl in 
  delight, giving chase. They finally corner him in

  THE ATRIUM

  [MATERIAL SHOT IN SEASON 1] Bodies litter the floor. Crixus 
  and Agron glance over, both bloodied and spent. Rhaskos and 
  the Gladiators laugh and jeer, taunting their master. 
  Batiatus wields his sword, desperately trying to keep them 
  at bay.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        I am your Dominus! I will see your 
                        fucking hearts for this!

                                        LUCRETIA (O.S.)
                        Quintus...

  Batiatus freezes in horror as he spots Lucretia, clutching 
  her stomach, the wound Crixus inflicted gushing blood.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Lucretia!

  Batiatus starts to go to her as she collapses, but is 
  intercepted by Spartacus, his eyes blazing with hot desire 
  for revenge.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        What would you do? To hold your 
                        wife again? To feel the warmth of 
                        her skin? The taste of her lips? 
                        How many men would you kill? A 
                        hundred? A thousand? There stands 
                        but one, between you and her.

  Batiatus screams, attacking. Spartacus counters, driving him 
  to the ground, sword to his neck.

                                          SPARTACUS(cont'd)
                      Go to her. Tell her the gods 
                        themselves will not keep you apart. 
                        Lie. As you lied to me of my wife.

  Spartacus releases him. Batiatus rises, trembling as he 
  scans his men for mercy. His eyes fall on Doctore, entering 
  with a shell-shocked Aurelia.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Oenomaus...


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.
  CONTINUED:

  Oenomaus averts his gaze. Batiatus swells, fear giving way 
  to rage. He abandons his sword, locking eyes with Spartacus 
  in defiance.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        You were nothing before me! I gave 
                        you the fucking heavens! I gave you 
                        means to accept your fate!

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And now you are destroyed by it.

  Spartacus HACKS OPEN BATIATUS' THROAT. Batiatus sputters in 
  shock as BLOOD spews from his ruined neck. He staggers 
  towards Lucretia, collapsing on the crimson floor next to 
  her. [NEW MATERIAL FOLLOWS]

  PUSH IN ON BATIATUS

  as the life begins to fade from his eyes. OFF SCREEN we hear 
  Spartacus' voice coming through in DISTORTED WAVES as he 
  makes his rousing speech to the liberated slaves.

                                          SPARTACUS (O.S.)
                        I have done this thing... because 
                      it was just. Blood demands blood...

  CONTINUE PUSHING IN. Batiatus' EYES fill the FRAME. 
  Spartacus' voice is replaced by the cacophony of a CHEERING 
  CROWD. The sound swells to a DEAFENING ROAR, propelling us 
  to --



  Batiatus' Attending Slave weaves through the dilapidated 
  wooden chutes, maneuvering past dead and wounded Gladiators.

                                          ATTENDING SLAVE
                                (spotting someone

                        Doctore.

  REVEAL DOCTORE -- but it isn't Oenomaus. This DOCTORE is a 
  grizzled giant of a man. Skin baked a golden bronze, white 
  SCARS standing out in stark contrast. He wears the 
  chestplate that Oenomaus one day will take possession of, 
  but at this point it is merely weathered and has not been 
  patched up.

                                          ATTENDING SLAVE(cont'd)
                        Dominus orders Gannicus returned to 
                        the ludus, and seen to reward.

  OTHO, a big bearded slab of ugly, laughs as he spots 
  Gannicus returning through the chute gate.

                                        OTHO
                        Perhaps one day the pretty little 
                        bitch will fight later in the 
                        afternoon. With the rest of the 
                        men.

  The Gladiators chuckle. Gannicus grins mirthlessly.

                                        GANNICUS
                        You and your tiny cock best pray 
                        that day never comes.

  Otho GRUNTS, starts for him. Gannicus is ready to go. 
  Doctore intervenes.

                        Save blood for the fucking sands. 
                        Gannicus.

  Gannicus grins, blowing Otho a kiss as Doctore leads him 
  away. Otho spits in disgust, continues suiting up. Doctore 
  hisses at Gannicus.

                        possessed by cunts who have 
                        perished from it.

  Doctore leads Gannicus out, WIPING US TO --



  The same cell Spartacus received in episode 106 after his 
  victory over Theokoles. Gannicus fucks two BEAUTIFUL SLAVE 
  GIRLS. Everyone is drinking and laughing and having a 
  rollicking good time. Wine flows. Passions climax. Slave 
  Girl #1 writhes in ecstasy as she orgasms, SMASHING US TO --



  DIONA, a pretty young slave barely out of her teens, and her 
  best friend NAEVIA titter as they pelt the two Slave Girls 
  with questions about Gannicus' prowess. [NOTE: Naevia does 
  not have the tattoo on the back of her shoulder yet.]

                                        DIONA
                      Is it true? That his thing is large 
                      as a horse's?

                                (hesitates, to 
                                  Slave Girls)
                      Is Gannicus  really that big?

  Diona and Naevia shriek with laughter -- which they quickly 
  stifle as Melitta appears.

                                          MELITTA
                        Where is Domina?

                        Yes, Melitta.

  Diona exits, giggling with the girls. Naevia falls into step 
  with Melitta as she moves off. Melitta glances sideways at 
  Naevia.

                                          MELITTA
                      It is exciting, speaking of such 
                        things, is it not?

  Naevia isn't sure how to answer. Melitta laughs. She 
  obviously has a fondness for Naevia, as a big sister would 
  towards a younger sibling.

  Lucretia and Gaia lounge, drinking and laughing.

                        careful consideration...

  Batiatus drinks, turning the possibilities in his mind...



  Oenomaus is escorted in. He can barely contain his 
  excitement as Batiatus counts coin at his desk, not looking 
  up. He finishes, rises.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I have news to lift the heart. 
                        Vettius has made challenge.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        The coward finds his cock.

                                        BATIATUS
                                  laughs)(
                        And I would see it shriveled. My 
                        best man is to meet his dog in the 
                        marketplace come morning.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        The market?

                                        BATIATUS
                        A detail of no consequence. My 
                        question to you is plain. Is our 
                        man prepared for such a vital 
                        match?

                                        OENOMAUS
                                (swelling with 
                                  pride)
                        Yes, Dominus. I long to honor this 
                        house once again.

  Batiatus stares, laughs uncomfortably.

                                        BATIATUS
                        No, I fear you have mistaken 
                        intentions.  I speak of Gannicus.

  Oenomaus barely contains his disappointment -- and 
    embarrassment.




                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    36.

                        Gannicus. I -- The question would 
                      be better put to Doctore.

                                        BATIATUS
                        His counsel is always valued, yet 
                      he is my father's man. His 
                        judgement clouded through the haze 
                      of outdated tradition. I seek a 
                        more visceral assessment. You and I 
                        practically grew up together in 
                        this ludus. You have seen the rise 
                        and fall of a dozen champions. What 
                        now does your gut tell you of 
                        Gannicus? Is he worthy of assuming 
                        the mantle?

  Oenomaus struggles with the question.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  soft)(
                        I believe it so.

                                        BATIATUS
                      He must truly be, for you to offer 
                        support despite your own desires.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        I would not give false tongue to 
                        gain advantage.

                                        BATIATUS
                        There are few that would stand with 
                        you so.

  He clasps Oenomaus warmly on the arm.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Your wife's weekly visit. Two days 
                        hence?

  Oenomaus nods.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        I would see her to your bed tonight 
                      as well. In gratitude for honest 
                        thoughts.

  He motions to the Guard. Oenomaus is led out, WIPING US TO 
  --                                                                                    37.



  Melitta, naked, lights a candle at a makeshift altar (the 
  same seen in episode 106, season 1). She mouths a silent 
  prayer before sliding into bed with Oenomaus. He takes her 
  in his arms with a troubled frown.

                                        OENOMAUS
                      Do the gods ever answer your 
                        prayers?

                                          MELITTA
                        They often reveal their leanings, 
                        though not in words. Much like my 
                        husband.

  He forces a sad smile. Melitta knows him too well.

                                        OENOMAUS
                                  reluctantly)(
                        Dominus summoned me. To ask of 
                        Gannicus.

                                          MELITTA
                        Gannicus?

                                        OENOMAUS
                      He has chosen him as champion, to 
                        face Vettius' man in the 
                        marketplace tomorrow.

                                          MELITTA
                        And this is why you sulk? The 
                        streets are no place for the mighty 
                        Oenomaus to make his return. The 
                        arena will be home to your 
                        triumphs, when the time comes. And 
                        I will be there to witness it...

  Her lips devour him, hungrily, passionately. Oenomaus 
  responds in kind, her words and her touch dispelling doubt 
  --for the moment...



  Naked Gladiators cheer and laugh, welcoming a victorious 
  Gannicus back into the fold (his wounds tended to by 
  Medicus). Crixus, Ashur, Dagan, and Indus, battered from the 
  day's training, look on from the sideline.

                                        AUCTUS
                        Only mad Gannicus could win contest 
                        fucking blindfolded!

  The Gladiators ROAR. Barca laughs in mock scorn.

                                        BARCA
                        Barca could do the same!

                        fool.

  Auctus laughs, roughly grabbing Barca and kissing him hard 
  in warning. Oenomaus appears. The din dies down. Oenomaus 
  still commands much respect among the men.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Auctus speaks truth. Facing 
                        Vettius' man absent sight was 
                        beyond foolish. The gods must have 
                        taken pity on your addled brain, to 
                        see you yet among us.

                                        GANNICUS
                        The gods had shit to do with it. 
                        Otho grunts like a stuck pig before 
                        each attack. His squeals gave way 
                        position!

  The men roar in approval. Oenomaus joins them, clasping 
  forearms with his friend. Oenomaus' approval obviously means 
  a lot to him.

                                        OENOMAUS
                        Your victory lifts the heart.

                        brothers!

  The men ROAR. Gannicus tosses the Recruits a wry grin as he 
  exits with the Gladiators in tow.

  Batiatus roars with excitement as Naevia and Diona dress him 
  in his finest robes. Gaia and Lucretia sip wine, enraptured.

                        Gannicus' victory forges path to

                        support, we will finally gain 
                        proper position in the games!

                                        BATIATUS
                                  taking wine)(
                        May they always find the taste 
                        pleasing.

  Batiatus drinks. Tullius laughs, joins him.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Everyone clamors to see your man 
                        again. With exception of poor 
                        Vettius. He is fit for seizure from 
                        the ordeal.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Unfortunate. That he could not 
                        produce more worthy opponent. Yet 
                        his stock is well known to be of 
                        inferior quality, as the boy 
                        himself. The manner in which he 
                        tends his ludus. The child has no 
                        fucking talent for it.

  Tullius eyes Batiatus, a faint smile bending his lips.

                                          TULLIUS
                        You surprise me, Batiatus. Your 
                        disposition towards business is 
                        much more... aggressive. Than your 
                        father's.

                                        BATIATUS
                      We are of diverging temperament. 
                        And desires.

                                          TULLIUS
                        How does he fare in Sicilia?

                                        BATIATUS
                        The clime is more agreeable with 
                        various conditions brought about by 
                        the passing of years.
                                  back to business)(
                        How did the Magistrate find 
                        Gannicus' display?

                                          TULLIUS
                        Ignited by it, as was the crowd.

  Tullius refills Batiatus cup.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

                      He even broached subject of 
                        retaining the man. For the opening 
                        games of the new arena.

  Batiatus lights up.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Gannicus in the opening games? If 
                        you could aid in such a thing, I 
                        would forever be in your debt.

                                          TULLIUS
                      It merely requires a word in the 
                        proper ear. All that remains is to 
                        agree upon a price.

  Batiatus' mirth falters. Ah, here it comes. The shakedown. 
  He forces a smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                      Of course. I would be happy to see 
                        coin to your hands in exchange for 
                        your assistance. What sum did you 
                        have in mind?

  Tullius stares in surprise, then laughs.

                                          TULLIUS
                        You misunderstand, Batiatus. I do 
                        not offer to broker arrangement. I 
                        offer to purchase your man.

  The bottom drops out of Batiatus' world.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Purchase? But --
                                  laughs)(
                        Why would you want a gladiator? You 
                        are not a lanista.

                                          TULLIUS
                                  laughs)(
                        Jupiter's cock, no. Yet I do have 
                        many vested interests. In shipping. 
                        Goods and services. This very shop.
                                  pointedly)(
                        And young Vettius' ludus.

  Vettius appears behind Tullius, a nasty smile cracking his 
  face. With him are several large, brutish GLADIATORS. Acco's 
  eyes flick nervously to the Gladiators. Batiatus tenses.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    52.

                                          VETTIUS
                                  laughs)(
                        Look at the little fuck now. About 
                      to shit himself.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Still your tongue. The grownups are 
                        talking.

  He levels his gaze at Batiatus, all pretenses of warmth and 
  friendship vanishing. He sets a heavy purse of coins on the 
  table between them.

                                          TULLIUS(cont'd)
                        Two hundred denarii. A generous 
                        offer.  In respect of your father.

  Batiatus hardens. Wrong thing to say.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Apologies. I would not part with 
                        the man.

  Tullius considers that, has a sip of wine.

                                          TULLIUS
                        I allowed you to purchase one of my 
                        slaves. Yet now you deny me the 
                        same opportunity?

  Batiatus' eyes flick to Vettius and his men. He licks his 
  lips, musters the courage to stand his ground.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Gannicus is not for sale.

                                          TULLIUS
                        Everything is for sale, Batiatus. 
                        The question is but price.

  He smiles warmly, his eyes flicking to his man Theron. 
  Theron erupts, sinking a meat cleaver into Acco's skull. 
  Batiatus overturns the table, using the distraction to 
  scramble out of the room. Vettius and his men rush after 
  him.



  TIGHT ON the little clay bottle, the remainder of its 
  powdered contents spilling out onto a side table. ADJUST TO 
  FIND Lucretia sprawled on her bed, eyes glazed in opium 
  bliss. Gaia appears next to her, gently stroking her hair. 
  She kisses Lucretia. Lucretia half smiles, too out of it to 
  even care. Gaia's hands crawl over Lucretia's body, slowly 
  undressing her.

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:



  A naked Gaia kisses her way down an equally exposed 
  Lucretia. Lucretia writhes in absent pleasure, her eyes hazy 
  and unfocused. Gaia disappears OUT OF FRAME as she goes down 
  on her. Lucretia gasps in ecstasy.

                                                                  MATCH CUT WITH:
