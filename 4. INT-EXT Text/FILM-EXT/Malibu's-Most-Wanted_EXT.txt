Tec hangs up; as he looks over, Brad is pulled from the
trunk by two I-9s, his mouth still taped. Tec almost
feels sorry for him.
TEC
That's cold.
(to crew)
Lose the tape.
Tec's homie rips the tape off Brad's mouth.
BRAD
God damn that hurts!!! I get out

TEC
Your daddy ain't payin'.
BRAD
Yeah, yeah, tell me somethin' I

TEC

BRAD

Tec cocks his nine and aims at Brad.
BRAD

Oh what, you gonna do me like

Tec is stunned -- the white boy isn't showing any fear.
Brad steps forward, puts the gun to his own heart, and
places his thumb on the trigger.
BRAD
That gat's real, right?
Then do

TEC
(unnerved)
Brotha straight-up crazy, and I
cannot deal with that shit.
Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts as Tech's car is HIT with a
BARRAGE of BULLETS. Brad, the crew, Sean and PJ drop to
the street and roll under the car. Tec has to dive
behind a nearby dumpster.
ACROSS STREET
Snuffy and three Rollin' G's are crouched behind their
low rider, FIRING away.
UNDER CAR
The I-9s RETURN FIRE. PJ and Sean are in the fetal
position, freaking out. Brad, thinking it's all fake, is
laughing, having a great time.
TEC
Lay down some cover, fool!
Tec's pinned down behind the dumpster. He's without
a weapon, and Rollin' G's are FOCUSING their FIRE on
him.
8-BALL
We're tryin', man, but they're too
strapped.

The Rollin' G's try to respond, but Brad's fire is too
intense.
SNUFFY
Devil's got some balls.

Let's dip!
They all hop in their convertible and tear-ass out of
there as Brad jumps off the cars and follows on foot,
FIRING after them as they turn the corner and SQUEAL
away.
BRAD
It's safe now, y'all.
Tec emerges from behind the dumpster. The crew rolls out
from under the car, followed by Sean and PJ. They look
at Brad in awe. They're impressed.
TEC
That was ill!
Y'all definitely

He offers his fist to Brad.
They pound.
