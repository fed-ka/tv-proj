THE SQUARE. SHOWS THE MEXICAN/SPANISH INFLUENCE AND.IS CROWDED
with weekend visitors. Men,. women and children are. milling
about, shopping and idly trading gossip.. The town.has the
look of turn of the century Americana along with its.Spanisn
heritage. The group of soldiers enter almost unnoticed.-
Riding downethe street they pass:
A LARGE TENT IN FRONT OF WHICH IS A BANNER ANNOUNCING a
W.C.T.U. meeting, which, according to the SOUNDS of the bass
drum and a sermon denouncing rum, is presently going on
inside.
SPEAKER (OS)
Leviticus. 10.9. Do not drink wine or
strong drink thou,nor thy sons with
thee least ye die. It shall be a
statute forever. Look. not though. upon.
the. wine when it. is red when it giveth
his color in the cup when it moveth
itself aright at the last it biteth
like a serpent and stingeth like an
adder.

SPEAKER (OS) (CONTID)
(THEN)
That is in the good book.. but here in
this town, it is five cents a glass.
Five cents a glass, does anyone think
that that is really the price of a
----drink? The price of a drink let him
decide who has lost his courage and his
pride and who lies a govelling heap
of clay not far removed from a beast
today.-
CONGREGATION (OS)
I hereby solemnly procaise, God helping
me, to abstain from all di stilled, fer-
mented and malt ligi34rs3 including wine,
beer and cider, and to employ all proper
means to discourage the Ilse of and.
traffic in the same.
AS THE GROUP RIDES AROUND THE SQUARE,. THREE. SOLDIERS,
ABE,. PHIL AND BURT, at the hitching rail on one side of the
street,. turn and keep pace with the group on horseback.
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE THREE OTHER SOLDIERS,
BUCK, FRANK AND CRAZY LEE, DO THE SAME.
10 PIKE AND HIS GROUP RIDE PAST THE GENERAL STORE AND THE
SALOON. AT T- END OF THE STREET, THEY DISMOUNT ACROSS FROM
THE YELLOW AND BROWN RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION BUILDING. As
they swing out of the saddle the other ' soldiers' join them.
1l.' PIKE AND HIS COMPANIONS REMOVE EMPTY SADDLE BAGS FROM their
horses and step onto the boardwalk or sidewalk that surrounds
the'square. Some passersby look curiously.
PIKE

Pike looks at the horses, then at:
13, THE SIGN OVER THE ENTRANCE OF A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET
It reads: PECOS AND SOUTH TEXAS R.R.
14. PIKE PAUSES. FOR A MINUTE and behind him the men surreptitious-
ly touch their holstered forty-five automatics. Pike leaves
the boardwalk, crossing toward. the railroad office. Tector
and Phil stay with the horses.

ACCIDENTALLY BUMP INTO A LADY SHOPPER, WHO DROPS HER PACIKAGE.
PIKE

Beg pardon, Ma'am.
DUTCH

Let. me, Ma'am.
Dutch picks up the package, Pike offers the lady his arm.
She hesitates, accepts. Pike and Dutch, followed by the
others, lead her across the 'street.
16. ON THE ROOF OF THE BUILDING OPPOSITE THE RAILROAD OFFICE ARE
TEN. MEN STRETCHED OUT BEHIND THE FALSE FRONT T_DLY WATCHING
THE CROWD BELOW, THEIR RIFLES AT THEIR SIDES Behind them.
on the flat of the roof are open bedrolls, and the remains of
at least three meals. It is hot., they have been there a -long
time, and they are tired.
17., PAT HARRIGAN, A DAPPER, SELF-IMPORTANT, BACK=SHOOTING RAIL-
ROAD EXECUTIVE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MEN -- ALL RAGGED
HARDCASES -- frowns a little as he watches the soldiers in
the street below. It is. hotter than hell on the tin roof and
he is sweating heavily. He turns, edges forward, then nudges:
18, DEKE THORNTON SITTING NEXT TO HIM, his back against the wall,
Thornton is a hard-bodied, quiet-spoken man, with a lined
face and the embittered manner of someone who has changed
sides to stay alive and while part of his life has gone out
of him with the change, the personal integrity by which he
has lived is still. intact.

The bounty hunters react and prepare to fire. Over this shot

No, sir -- we divide just as you

contents onto the spread-out poncho watching as:

Hey, gringo; You take my share.
125 TECTOR WHIRLS, HIS HAND FLASHING FOR HIS GUN.

126 BEFORE HE CAN DRAW ANGEL'S. EXPRESSION TURNS serious and a
gun is suddenly in his hand covering the big outlaw. Angel
smiles again...then pleads mockingly.
ANGEL
Don't kill me, gringo ...por favor...
Take my share of the 'silver' -- but
--
don't kill me, please.
Tector tenses, almost snarling with rage..
PIKE

Tector-, looking at Angel's gun, half turns to Pike.
PIKE:

Go on, fall apart!
Lyle and Tector hesitate, their hands on their guns -- Dutch
moves back into the shadows of the firelight, his rifle
drifting across Tector.
127 ANGEL SMILES AND SLOWLY replaces his gun.

Let's walk soft, boys...

129 TECTOR LOOKS AT PIKE, DUTCH, ANGEL, T.HEN slaps his gun into
his holster -- and moves away, but his hand is never far
from the weapon..
130 THE GROUP STANDS MOTIONLESS FOR A MOMENT, THEN SYKES REACHES
INTO HIS COAT, LIFTS OUT A BOTTLE,. SITS BY THE FIRE and
hands'it to Dutch.
Dutch sits by Sykes, takes a drink, offers the bottle to
Tector, Tector hesitates, then hunkers down and drinks.
Slowly the others.follow suit.

For a moment, it looks like he'll get a smart answer in

Lyle drinks and lifts the bottle to Angel who.crosses to.the
fire,. drinks and passes it to Sykes.
PIKE

.We got to start thinking beyond

All your fancy planning and talk

Now this was goin.' to be our last

You spent your time and money running

PULLING THE FIVE HORSES DOWN WITH HIM.. Unable to

DUTCH
Only five left -- didn't figure

PIKE

BARE FOOT IN A SMALL CLUMP OF CHOLLA -- He. jumps at the fiery
pain and nearly falls, and for an instant:
429 HIS RIFLE CAN BE SEEN OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE.
430 SYKES TENSES FOR A BRIEF INSTANT AS . THE SUN HITS THE BARREL
OF THE RIFLE and he catches the reflection in his- eye.
Then he has spurred his horse into the brush at the side of
the trail.
431 THORNTON CURSES AND RUNS TO HIS HORSE as the bandits open
fire.
432 PIKE AND THE OTHERS WATCH SYKES SPUR INTO THE BRUSH. TINY
PINPOINTS OF LIGHT APPEAR IN THE ROCKS ABOVE HIM. After a

The others look at him silently. Finally:
DUTCH
We take our gold?
PIKE
We take one sack to pay our way.
Bury the rest -- together.
They think this over, then nod.
437 THE BOUNTY HUNTERS CRASH through the brush into a small
clearing, then split up, looking for tracks. The country
around them is a maze of rocks and thick mesquite and
chaparral. Sykes' horse, blood running. down its flanks,
is standing in the clearing,-grazing.
T.,C.
He can't be far.
COFFER
Lots of blood over here -- then
it stops and no tracks.

THORNTON
(softly, bitterly)
Jess, you come back tomorrow and
watch the buzzards. They'll show
you where he is -- you might even
get a pair of. boots.
Jess thinks this over and grins, then the smile fades.
JESS
But what if he ain't dead?
THORNTON
Your problem..
He turns his horse and rides away,. the others following,
439 SYKES, HIDDEN IN THE ROCKS and brush above them,slowly
lowers his rifle and sags back. His leg is dark with dried
blood and he's weak. Around the wound is a crude bandage
made from his shirt -- with a tourniquet twisted tightly
above it. After a moment, there is a noise and he looks
away at:
440 THE FIGURE OF A MEXICAN PEON -- BLURRED AND INDISTINCT
AGAINST THE RAYS of the late afternoon sun, a machete
dangling from his hand.
PIKE AND THE OTHERS NOW MOUNTED, look over the camp.

445 MAPACHE, ZAMORRA AND THE GERMANS are sitting at the table..
446 TWO SOLDIERS LEAD ANGEL (who has been badly beaten) down into
the courtyard. His hands are tied, and he is, stumbling with
fatigue. They tie a long rope from his neck to. the pack

a million flies and the walls lined with waiting vultures.
There is no sign of soldiers anywhere.. A few of the bodies
have been dragged into the courtyard. Most, including Pike,
Dutch and the others, including Mapache, lie where they fell.
507 THE BOUNTY HUNTERS, LED BY THORNTON, RIDE UP TO THE ARCHES
AND DISMOUNT, their horses snorting nervously at the smell of
blood and the stench of death. At-the end of the courtyard
where five corpses are heaped in a small Di13, a lone vulture
stands. patiently near them.
As the bounty hunters approach and the-.bird labors reluctantly
into flight, the men dismount.
