      FADE IN:

      INT. WHITTEMORE HOME/JACKSON S ROOM - NIGHT - FLASHBACK11

      Out of the haze of VIDEO STATIC, the face of Jackson 
      Whittemore comes into focus. Peering into the lens of Matt s 
      camera, he makes one last adjustment to its position.

      Lying back on his bed, a smile creeps over his face in 
        anticipation of his glorious transformation into a werewolf.

      A BLAST OF STATIC jumps the video to hours later. Now asleep, 
      Jackson stirs, slowly turning over.

      ANOTHER BURST OF STATIC jumps the footage further into the 
      night. Jackson sits up in bed. With a robotic stiffness, he 
      turns to face the camera as his eyes begin to GLOW.

      Lurching off the bed, his head snaps back, mouth falling open 
      to reveal a set of double-rowed teeth.

      It happens quickly and violently. Jackson s hands hit the 
      floor, body twisting and limbs wrenching, he transforms into 
      a reptilian shapeshifter now known as the Kanima.

      Launching up, he charges toward the video camera and then 
      right past it. The image cuts to BLACK.

      A NEW SCREEN appears and a message begins to type out 
      character by character: Ur video s done restoring. Call me.

      EXT. STREET - NIGHT22

      Danny taps a command on his TABLET and the message vanishes 
      from the screen, sent off to Jackson. Tossing the tablet into 
      the trunk of his car, Danny slams it shut while--

      EXT. BEACON HILLS/INDUSTRIAL SECTOR - NIGHT33

      Derek Hale runs as fast as he can. Leaping over a chain link 
      fence with an acrobatic flip, he drops to the other side, 
      landing on all fours. When he lifts his head--

      He's now a werewolf. A RED-EYED ALPHA.

      In the distance, he spots the glowing eyes of the Kanima 
      peering back at him, almost challenging him to catch up.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/122.

        CONTINUED:33

      Derek lopes after it, hands and feet pounding the pavement. 
      As the Kanima bounds up the side of a building, a VOICE calls 
      out.

                                  SCOTT (O.S.)
                    There he is!

      Stiles s Jeep SOARS into view. Gripping the wheel, he 
      struggles around a turn while Scott tracks the Kanima s 
      movement from the passenger side.

      Just as they re closing in, however, Stiles SLAMS on the 
      brakes. They SCREECH to a stop at a parking lot entrance 
      where severe tire damage SPIKES jut up from the pavement.

                                  STILES
                    What do we do--

      But Scott is already out the door and running for it.

      INT. ALLISON S CAR - NIGHT44

      Allison pulls her car to the curb in front of the Martin home 
      and turns to Lydia.

                                    ALLISON
                    I need you to promise you won t say 
                    anything about what just happened.

                                  LYDIA
                    I ll promise not to say anything 
                    about what just happened if you can 
                    tell me what the hell just *
                      happened.*

                                    ALLISON
                    It s kind of complicated.

                                  LYDIA
                    How about you start with why Derek 
                    was there? Where Jackson went? What 
                    was wrong with Erica?

      Allison struggles in silence.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Need a minute to come up with a 
                    plausible lie?

                                    ALLISON
                    Part of the reason I m asking is 
                    because Scott and I aren t supposed 
                    to be seeing each other. Okay?

        CONTINUED:44
                                    ALLISON (CONT'D)
                    So it s better if you keep what you 
                    know to yourself.

                                  LYDIA
                    Fine. I ll keep what I know about 
                    you and your boyfriend--which is 
                      nothing--to myself.

      Opening the door, she tries to get out, but Allison grabs 
      her, pulling her back.

                                    ALLISON
                    He s not just my boyfriend. You get 
                    that, right?

                                  LYDIA
                    Let me go.

                                    ALLISON
                    Can you try for one second to 
                      remember--

                                  LYDIA
                    Remember what?

                                    ALLISON
                    What it feels like. All the times 
                    in school when you see him down the 
                    hall and you can t breathe until 
                    you re with him. Or in class when 
                    you can t stop looking at the clock 
                    because you know he s standing out 
                    there waiting. Don t you remember 
                    how that feels?

                                  LYDIA
                    No.

                                    ALLISON
                    What do you mean no? You ve had 
                      boyfriends.

                                  LYDIA
                    None like that.

      She pulls free. Without another look back, she gets out and 
      slams the door shut as--

      EXT. BEACON HILLS/INDUSTRIAL SECTOR/ALLEYWAY - NIGHT55

      RAINWATER SPLASHES up beneath Derek s boots. Landing on the 
      puddle-strewn pavement, he closes the distance between 
      himself and the Kanima.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/124.

        CONTINUED:55

      He charges forward, feet leaving the ground as the creature 
      bounds up in retreat. Hand swiping out, he grabs it by the 
      ankle and--

      SLAMS it down to the pavement. 

      But the thing whirls up, instantly back on its feet, 
      SHRIEKING in defiance.

      Fangs bared, Derek ROARS a response.

      They circle each other. One a monster of brute force. The 
      other a slippery creature, moving with a fluidity that 
      borders on elegance.

      Derek swings a fist which it easily dodges. Punch after punch 
      fly out, Derek SMASHING through brick walls, sending DUST and 
      DEBRIS flying.

      The Kanima, however, ducks and parries each blow, whipping 
      its talon-like claws toward Derek.

      DROPS OF VENOM leap from the tips of the creature s claws as 
      Derek ducks back. The paralytic DROPLETS just miss his head 
      as he bends back, head almost touching the ground.

      When Derek comes up, however, the Kanima flips around and 
      KICKS him right in the chest. He splashes down, tumbling flat 
      on his back in a puddle.

      The creature turns to run. Until GUNSHOTS literally take it 
      off its feet. Two direct hits from a Desert Eagle gripped in 
      the hands of--

      Argent.

      LIGHTS from his SUV blazing out from behind him, he steps 
      into the alleyway and into the fight. 

      Stunned, the Kanima slowly rights itself but--

      Argent FIRES again, one shot after the next. Shells dropping 
      to the pavement around his boots, he presses relentlessly 
      forward.

      The Kanima takes each hit, finally collapsing to the wet 
      pavement.

      Argent swings the gun back to aim for Derek. But there s no *
      sign of him. Head turned, Argent doesn t notice the Kanima 
      slowly rising to its feet.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/125.

        CONTINUED:55

      When he hears the scrape of claws, Argent whips the gun up 
      and pulls the trigger again.

      But he s out of ammunition.

      The empty clip clatters to the pavement. He yanks a new one 
      from his coat, but not fast enough.

      The Kanima surges toward him and with one precise hit, sends 
      him CRASHING to the pavement.

      Argent blinks, bordering on unconscious as the Kanima turns 
      to face--

      Gerard.

      Unarmed, the senior Argent holds still as the creature 
      surveys him. Claws TICKING against the pavement, it carefully 
      approaches the fearless Gerard.

      The Kanima cocks its head to look at him, almost like a cobra 
      judging its prey. Gerard simply stares back, holding his 
      hands to his sides, palms out.

      Fingers grasping for his gun, Argent tries to blink his 
      blurry vision back to normal while the TWO DARK SHAPES 
      inspect each other, almost blending together until--

      SOMETHING HITS the Kanima from behind, sending it tumbling 
      back. The attacker--Scott McCall--lands on his feet.

      As the Kanima sets off in retreat, Scott gives a momentary 
      glance to the quietly pleased Gerard and then--

      Charges forward in pursuit.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MAIN TITLE: TEEN WOLF

      EXT. NIGHT CLUB/FRONT - NIGHT66

      Turning a corner, Scott slides to a halt when he hears 
      VOICES. A crowd of people gather outside the neon lit facade 
      of a building. It s a NIGHT CLUB.

      Scott turns, trying to find the creature. But it s Stiles who 
      races out of the darkness, gasping for air.

                                  STILES
                    You see where he went?                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/126.

        CONTINUED:66

                                  SCOTT
                    Lost him.

      They glance about, trying to stay out of view of the club.

                                  STILES
                    You couldn t catch a scent?

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t think it has one.

                                  STILES
                    Any clue where he s going?

                                  SCOTT
                    To kill someone.

                                  STILES
                    Right, that s what the claws and 
                    fangs are for. Now it all makes 
                    sense.
                          (off Scott s look)
                    Sorry. I m a hundred and forty-
                    seven pounds of pale skin and 
                    fragile bone. Sarcasm s my only 
                    defense.

                                  SCOTT
                    Can you just help me find it?

                                  STILES
                    Not it. Jackson.

                                  SCOTT
                    I know, I know.

                                  STILES
                    But does he know? And did anyone 
                    else see him back at your house?

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t think so. And he already 
                    passed Derek s test anyway.

                                  STILES
                    Yeah, but that s the thing. How did 
                    he pass the test?

                                  SCOTT
                    I don t know.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/127.

        CONTINUED:66

                                  STILES
                    Maybe it s an either/or thing. 
                    Derek said a snake can t be 
                    poisoned by its own venom, right? 
                    So when s the Kanima not the 
                    Kanima?

                                  SCOTT
                    When it s Jackson.

      Scott looks to him for confirmation, but Stiles s gaze is 
      focused on something else.

                                  STILES
                    Dude...

      He nods to THE ROOF OF THE CLUB where A TAIL arcs into the 
      moonlight. The Kanima s body glides into view and then darts 
      down through an air conditioning vent.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    You see that?

                                  SCOTT
                    He s inside.

                                  STILES
                    What the hell s he going to do in 
                    there?

      With a quick breath, Scott snaps his head toward the line. 
      He s caught a scent.

                                  SCOTT
                    I think I know who he s after.

                                  STILES
                    What? How? Did you smell something?

                                  SCOTT
                    Armani.

      They both turn to the entrance where they see a familiar face 
      using a fake ID to get into the club. Jackson s best friend-- 

      Danny.

      Slipping around to the back alley behind the club, Scott and 
      Stiles locate the rear door. But when Stiles tries the 
      handle, it s locked.

                                  STILES
                          (glancing up)
                    Maybe there s a window we could 
                    climb through--

      A METALLIC CRUNCH interrupts him. Stiles peers down to see 
      the handle--no longer attached to the door--in Scott s hand.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Or a handle we could rip off with 
                    super human strength. How did I not 
                    think of that?

      Scott yanks the door open and they hurry inside.

      INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT88

      Under the PULSING BOOM of house music and the flash of LASER 
      LIGHTS, Scott and Stiles try to blend in. Looking around, 
      however, Scott begins to notice something.

                                  SCOTT
                    Dude... Everyone in here is a dude. 
                    I think this is a gay club.

      He looks to Stiles who stands between two very tall DRAG *
      QUEENS.*

                                  STILES
                    Nothing gets past those keen 
                    werewolf senses, does it?

      Only a few feet away, Danny takes a drink from the Bartender,  *
      NICK, and turns to survey the crowd. But the sight of his EX-*
      BOYFRIEND sends him turning back to the bar. Unable to *
      resist, he looks again and finds his Ex on the dance floor. 
      With someone else.

                                  NICK*
                    You re better off without him.

      Danny glances over. Nick gives an encouraging nod. So Danny *
      grabs his drink and walks off just as--

      Stiles and Scott push their way to the front of the bar.

                                  STILES
                    Two beers.

                                  NICK*

      Scott and Stiles drop down on the bar two of the worst

      Nick motions to a GUY down the bar, raising his drink in *
      cheers. Scott turns to Stiles, smiling with pride.

                                  STILES
                    Shut up.

                    I didn t say anything.

                                  STILES
                    Your face did.

      Stiles brings the soda to his lips, but pauses when he spots 
      someone in the crowd.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    I found Danny.

      Perched among light fixtures above, the Kanima moves like a 
      spider across the ceiling, stealthily making its way toward 
      the dance floor.

      And toward Danny.

      EXT. MARTIN HOME - NIGHT99

      The back door to the Martin home clicks open. Barefoot, Lydia 
      lets the family dog, a well-coiffed terrier named PRADA, out 
      into the yard. While it disappears into the shadows, Lydia 
      waits, hugging herself in the cold.

                                  LYDIA
                          (calling out)
                    Let s go, Prada. You re all of 
                    twenty pounds. There s only so much 
                    that can come out of you.

      BARKING echoes from the darkness, low and distant.

                    Prada? Let s go!

      The BARKING rises and then abruptly STOPS.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Prada?

      Stepping into the yard, Lydia approaches the edge of the 
      woods. After a moment of ominous silence, she s no longer 
      irritated. She's frightened.

      Beginning a cautious retreat back to the house, a SOUND makes 
      her pause. FOOTSTEPS crushing leaves. But not the patter of 
      four paws. It's the one-two rhythm of a person.

      Breath caught in her throat, Lydia takes a fearful step back 
      as SOMEONE walks right out of the darkness.

      offers Lydia his most charming smile.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1211.


      INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT1010

      All humor gone, a now fearful Stiles shakily sets his drink 
      back on the bar next to Scott, who keeps his gaze on the 
      ceiling and the BLACK SHAPE perched there.

                                  SCOTT
                    Get Danny.

                                  STILES
                    What are you going to do?

      Without averting his eyes, Scott flicks open his fist, 
      unsheathing his CLAWS.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Works for me.*

      Scott steps into the crowd. The pounding MUSIC intensifies, *
      bodies twisting toward him while the Kanima creeps amid the 
      light fixtures above.

      Stiles presses through toward Danny, but quickly loses sight 
      of him.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Danny? Danny.

      Hearing Stiles, Scott takes his eyes off the ceiling to see 
      his friend struggling through the crowd. When he looks back 
      up--

      The creature is gone.

      Scott glances about the ceiling, searching every corner. But 
      he can t find it. As he begins to panic--

      Someone dancing bumps into him. Then another elbow jabs him 
      in the lower back, pushing him forward. The crowd packs 
      tighter, moving faster and faster with the beat of the music.

      PLUMES OF FOG BLAST out from a smoke machine, obscuring 
      Scott s view. STROBING LIGHTS create an almost nightmare 
      quality to the dancing bodies as--

      THE KANIMA S FACE appears, teeth bared. And then is gone just 
      as quickly. Scott whips around, trying to find it again. 

      In a FLASH of LIGHT he sees Danny. And with another FLASH - 
      the Kanima, right near him.

      IN ANOTHER FLASH - Derek appears, RED EYES blazing and fangs 
      bared.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1212.

                    Derek--

      But he s gone in the next flash. Scott blinks, trying to find 
      him when SMOKE BILLOWS OUT again, laying a gray cloud over 
      the floor.

      Unable to see, Scott squeezes his eyes shut. When he opens 
      them they're GLOWING YELLOW. 

      Seeing now with the eyes of a WOLF, he focuses on HEAT 
      SIGNATURES coming off the dancing bodies. All except for 
      one...

      A sinewy, cold-blooded SILHOUETTE moving stealthily through 
      the crowd. Scott tries to push toward it, but the crowd edges 
      him back again. 

      Fog clearing, Stiles turns to see through the dancing crowd 
        as--one-by-one, people begin dropping.

      Bodies fall paralyzed to the floor in a path leading right 
      toward Danny. 

      Now elbowing back, Scott shoves through when--Danny s head 
      snaps forward. He falls. Blinking, not knowing what's 
      happening to his body as he collapses to the floor. 

      The Kanima rises, baring its fangs--

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    Jackson.

      The creature blinks, hearing its name under the pulsing 
      music. For a brief second, its EYES return to those of 
      Jackson's HUMAN EYES, gazing on Scott in confusion. And then 
      looking at--

      Derek. 

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                      No--don t!

      But he swipes out with his claws, delivering a RUTHLESS SLASH 
      to the creature s throat. Staggering back, its hands clasp 
      over its throat as BLACK BLOOD spills across its fingers.

      People stop dancing amid the prostrate bodies on the floor. 
      The music stops. Witnesses look about, confused, shouts of 
      panic rising over the crowd.

                                  VOICE

                    I can t move!

      In the escalating panic, Scott can no longer see the Kanima 
      or Derek. But he does find--

      DROPS OF GLISTENING BLOOD on the dance floor, leading to an 
      open EXIT DOOR.

      EXT. NIGHT CLUB/PARKING LOT - NIGHT1111

      Racing into the parking lot, Scott follows the shimmering 
      BLOOD DROPS on the ground. Behind a row of cars and SUV's he *
      spots--

      A FIGURE collapsing to the pavement.

      It s Jackson, returned to his human self. Slipping into 
        unconsciousness, the wounds across his throat appear to be 
      healing, but there are puddles of blood all around him.*

      Another pair of feet race past the parked cars--Stiles 
      catching up. He finds Scott knelt down, holding Jackson s 
      shivering and naked body off the wet pavement.

      The sound of SIRENS approach from the distance. Scott looks 
      up to Stiles.

      EXT. MARTIN HOME - NIGHT1212

      Under the trellis at the back door of her house, Lydia swats 
      her terrier, Prada, back inside and returns her attention to 
      the Junior.

      shuts the door.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1216.

                                  DANNY (CONT D)
                    Then I m great.

      Smiling back at him, Scott steps away to allow the EMTs to 
      lift him into the ambulance.

      INT. STILES S JEEP - NIGHT1414

      Scott jumps into the passenger side while Stiles uses a 
      blanket to cover an unconscious Jackson in the backseat.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1217.

                    Couldn t get anything out of Danny.

                                  STILES
                    Then can we get out of here now 
                    before one of my dad s deputies 
                    sees me?

      Off Scott s nod, Stiles hits the gas and heads for the exit. 
      But a SHERIFF S CAR swerves in to block them. As Scott and 
      Stiles stare in horror, the door clicks open and Sheriff 
      Stilinski gets out.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    Could this get any worse?

      Jackson lets out a MOAN from the back, beginning to wake up.

                                  STILES (CONT D)
                    That was rhetorical!

                                  STILES
                    Get rid of him? We re at a crime

                                  SCOTT
                    Well, do something.

      Stiles jumps out of the Jeep to face his father while Scott 
      turns to the backseat and a rapidly reviving Jackson.

                                    JACKSON
                    What the... what s...

                    Jackson, be quiet.

      But he starts pushing up, becoming more and more lucid.

      EXT. NIGHT CLUB/PARKING LOT - NIGHT1515

      Stiles talks fast, trying to hold Stilinski s attention.

      Stilinski moves for the Jeep, but Stiles whips in front of 
      him just as Jackson sits up inside.

      Fist clenched, Scott NAILS Jackson in the cheek, knocking him 
      into oblivion. He yanks the blanket back over him as--

      EXT. NIGHT CLUB/PARKING LOT - NIGHT1717

      Stilinski peers over to the Jeep. Scott waves, smiling 
      innocently. Stilinski turns his glare back to Stiles.

                                  GERARD
                    Very good. Know what it means?

                                    ALLISON
                    In order to win a battle you need 
                    to know everything you can about 
                    your enemy.

                                  GERARD
                    Right again. Your father and I 
                    happen to be having that very 
                    problem. We ve got an enemy about 
                    which we know next to nothing. And 
                    it killed one of our own, among 
                    others.

                                    ALLISON
                    I heard.

                                  GERARD
                    Did you hear Jackson Whittemore 
                    didn t show up to school today?

      Allison takes a noticeable pause before responding.

                                    ALLISON
                    He didn t?

                                  GERARD
                    His parents called. So did the 
                    police. You wouldn t know anything 
                    about that, would you?

      Allison shakes her head.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Let me tell you what I know. I know 
                    that a first instinct for a 
                    teenager is to protect their 
                    friends.

      He gets up, walking around her chair. His hands fall gently 
      onto her shoulders.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    I believe my granddaughter would 
                    always want to protect her friends. 
                    Even if it meant lying. So I want 
                    to ask you another question. This 
                    time with a small advantage.

      Gerard's finger glides up over the carotid artery in her 
      neck. She flinches, but he tightens his grip.                 TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1225.

                    I m not going to hurt you. I just 
                    want to get a sense of your pulse. 
                    Think of it as a game. All you have 
                    to do is tell the truth.

      But as he stands behind her, Allison s breath tightens, hands 
      nervously clutching at the arms of the chair.

                                  GERARD (CONT D)
                    Do you know anything about Jackson 
                    being missing?

                                    ALLISON
                    No.

                                  GERARD
                    Is he in trouble?

                                    ALLISON
                      I don t--I don t know.

                                  GERARD
                    Does this have anything to do with 
                    Scott?

                                    ALLISON
                    No--I mean, I don t know.

      Allison tries to get up, but Gerard pushes her down, fingers 
      pressed into her shoulder.

                                  GERARD
                    Your pulse jumped.

                                    ALLISON
                    Because you re scaring me.

      Shoving his hands off, Allison gets up to face him. Almost 
      instantly, Gerard is all smiles again.

                                  GERARD
                    I m sorry, sweetheart. That was 
                      definitely going too far.

                                    ALLISON
                    No kidding.

                                  GERARD
                    It wasn t right for me to use 
                    tactics like that. I m sorry. You 
                    can go back to class now.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1226.

      He stands perfectly, pleasantly still. Watching her back out 
      of the office.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL S OFFICE/WAITING AREA - DAY2525

      Shaken, Allison slips through the outer office area. She 
      pauses when she notices a WORKER putting up a SURVEILLANCE 
      CAMERA. As she eases out into the hall--

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CORRIDOR - DAY2626

      Another new SURVEILLANCE CAMERA hangs visible from the 
      ceiling. Allison slowly steps down the empty corridor to find 
      yet another. 

      And then another and another.

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL/CLASSROOM - DAY2727

      Scott takes his seat at the start of English class and throws 
      a glance across the room to find Allison already there. He 
      looks away too quickly to notice she s trying to get his 
      attention.

                                    ALLISON
                            (whispering)
                    Scott... Scott.

      When he doesn t hear, she begins to rise from her desk. But 
      then the classroom door SLAMS shut.

      Allison s mother, Victoria, steps in front of the board.

                                  VICTORIA
                    I m afraid your teacher was feeling 
                    ill and had to leave early today. 
                    So, unfortunately, you re stuck 
                    with me as a substitute.

      She aims an unsettling gaze at both Scott and Allison.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    Now, can someone bring me up to 
                    speed on where you are? Mr. McCall, 
                    how about you?

      Defeated, Allison slumps back in her seat while Scott begins 
      rifling through notes to respond.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1227.

      Jackson glares at Stiles across the van.

                                    JACKSON
                    Scales. Like a fish?

      METALLIC CLINKING of the chains on his wrists and ankles.

      parents another text message: Going to be home late. Don't 
      wait up.

      Lowering the phone, he pauses, listening to the quiet of the 
      woods. Then... the sound of leaves being CRUSHED underfoot. 
      Someone running. Coming right toward him. 

      Backing away, Stiles whirls around and--

      Breathes in relief when he sees Allison coming toward him.

                    Jackson s always kind of at a four. 
                    But we re good. I was actually 
                    doing him a favor.

                                  SCOTT
                    What favor?

                                  DANNY
                    I was recovering a video for him. I

                    Which is in the trunk of my car.

      Scott gives a defeated nod. But then...

      INT. HOSPITAL/RECEPTION - DAY3535

      Bolting out of the patient room, Scott hurries for the doors. 
      But his mother, Melissa, steps in to block his exit. 

                                    MELISSA

      EXT. NIGHT CLUB/PARKING LOT - DAY3636

      Bike skidding to a halt, Scott jumps off and hops the POLICE 
      TAPE surrounding the parking lot. Spotting Danny's car, he 
      hurries toward it. But slows when he gets a closer look. 

      THE TRUNK lies partially open, metal around the lock bent and 
      twisted as if someone had pried it with a crowbar. Scott 
      slowly pushes the lid up to confirm what he already 
      suspects...

      The trunk is empty.

      EXT. BEACON HILLS/LOOKOUT POINT - DAY3737

      The Prison Transport Van now sits parked at Lookout Point. 
      Gathered just a few yards from the van, Scott, Stiles and 
      Allison discuss his latest discoveries.

                                  SCOTT
                    If Jackson doesn t remember being 
                    the Kanima he definitely won t 
                    remember stealing Danny s tablet.

                                  STILES
                    But why would he steal it if he 
                    doesn t even know what s on it?

                    Okay, hold on. Someone saw Jackson 
                    made a video of himself turning 
                    into the Kanima. Then erased part *

                    actually true?

                                  STILES
                    It can t be. It s tried to kill all 
                    of us. You, me, Allison. I don t 
                    know about you two, but I haven t

                    him, we have to try.

      Jackson rests back against the wall of the van. A weariness

      someone actually fighting to save him. Until he notices 
      something strange on his forearm...

                    Thanks. I felt like I was going to 
                    fall asleep in your arms.

                                  SCOTT
                    I like it when you fall asleep in 
                    my arms.

                                    ALLISON
                    I don t. When I wake up you re 
                    always gone.

                                  SCOTT
                    I only do that because I don t want 
                    to wake you.

                                    ALLISON
                    I d rather just wake up with you.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1239.

                    You will. High school s only two *

                    Which is hard enough for normal *

      He nods, thinking for a moment.

                    What if there was a way I could be 
                    normal?

      INT. PRISON TRANSPORT VAN/HOLDING AREA - NIGHT4646

      Shackles pulled taut, Jackson stands, teeth clenched. He 
      opens his mouth as if trying to shout for help, but then his 
      head snaps up in a violent jerk.

      INT. ALLISON S CAR - NIGHT4747

      Allison sits up to listen to Scott s explanation.

                                  SCOTT
                    I ve been thinking about this since *
                    we saw her in the hospital. Lydia *
                    was bitten by an Alpha, right? And *
                    Peter told Stiles if the bite 
                    doesn t turn you it ll kill you. 
                    But nothing happened to Lydia.*

                                    ALLISON
                    Meaning what? She s immune?*

                                  SCOTT
                    If she is, doesn t immunity mean 
                    you could be cured? Would you want 
                    that? If I could be cured?

                                    ALLISON
                    I want anything that lets me be 
                    with you. And not just for the rest 
                    of high school.

                    too good of a college. My grades *

      She pulls back so that he can clearly see her expression.

                    I m serious.

                                  SCOTT
                    I know.

      Gently, he reaches up and brings her lips to his. They begin 
      kissing. But there s a difference this time. The kisses 
      aren t broken with smiles or moments of soft laughter typical 
      to young romance. It s urgent, serious.

      They pull each other closer and tighter, almost like two *
      people who know this might be the last time they ll be this 
      close. And as Scott s grip tightens around Allison s waist--

      The tendons in Jackson s neck press taut against the skin, 
      jaws snapping open as a second row of teeth pushes through 
      the gums in his mouth.

      His head wrenches to the side as--

      INT. ALLISON S CAR - NIGHT4949

      Allison's body presses against Scott s, each sensual and *
      perfect moment between them visually matched by a moment of 
      agonized, violent transformation for Jackson. Until finally--

      EXT. BEACON HILLS/LOOKOUT POINT - NIGHT5050

      The doors of the Prison Transport Van SMASH OPEN. Eyes 
      burning with a murderous GLOW, the Kanima pushes off the 
      floor of the van and launches up into the moonlit sky.

      INT. ALLISON S CAR - NIGHT5151

      Half naked in the car, Allison and Scott sleep in perfect 
      peace. Until a HAND POUNDS against the window, jolting them 
      both awake.

      It s Stiles. Panic in his eyes.

      EXT. BEACON HILLS/LOOKOUT POINT - NIGHT5252

      Scott, Allison and Stiles peer through the open doors of the 
      Prison Transport Van. The chains lie twisted and broken on 
      the floor amid Jackson s torn clothes.                TEEN WOLF "Episode 206" BLUE2/13/1241.

                    I don t need someone to hang out 
                    with. I need someone to talk to.

      Allison turns back and now really sees her. Not the Lydia she 
      knows, but a vulnerable teenage girl, waiting for a friend.

                                    ALLISON
                    Okay. I know it s important. But if 
                    it can just wait.

                                  LYDIA
                    Why is everyone always asking me to 
                    wait? Why can t anyone have right

                    Someone who can read five pages of 
                    Archaic Latin. Obviously, that s

      Jackson looks up from his seat inside Sheriff Stilinski s 
      office. Stunned, Stiles and Scott stand there blinking until 
      both Stilinski and Jackson s father peer out at them.
