      NICK BURCKHARDT, 28, suit and tie, enters, looks around,*
      sees JULIETTE LAMBERT, 26, a bundle of beauty and energy,*
      serving croissants and coffee to young urban professionals
      and university students.  The place is bustling.  Juliette
      sees Nick.  Picks up two bags of pastries off the counter:

                                      JULIETTE
                    Got you right here.

      Nick takes the bags, leans in for a kiss.

                                    NICK
                    You sure do.
                          (glances around)
                    You're packed.

                                      JULIETTE
                    We're kickin' some early mornin'
                    butt.

                                    NICK
                    You're gonna be home tonight for
                    dinner, right?

                                      JULIETTE
                    Why wouldn't I be.

                                    NICK
                    Just making sure you don't have yoga
                    or something.

                                      JULIETTE
                    No, why, you got something in mind.

      She smiles.  He smiles back.

                                    NICK
                    I always have something in mind.                                                                                        3.*


      Nick gets in as Hanks starts up the car.*

                    They couldn't tell.

      Rear window POLICE LIGHTS start FLASHING.  Car speeds off*
      down the street, SIREN BLASTING.*


      MARIE BRANNIGAN, 49, a weathered beauty, is behind the wheel. *
      She's pale and determined.  AND SHE'S BALD.  She keeps*
      glancing in the side view mirrors as if she's being followed.*


      Behind the wheel is a slightly chubby middle aged man with a

                    or ours.

      Hank and Nick start back up the ravine to the trail.

                                    NICK
                    This sounds like what happened a
                    month ago, at Munson Creek Falls.

                                    HANK
                    Same deal.  Hiker and a bobcat.

                                    NICK
                    But the bobcat wasn't wearing boots.

                                    HANK
                    Ever try putting cuffs on a bobcat?*

                                    NICK
                          (stops)
                    You hear that?

                                    HANK
                    What?

                                    NICK
                    Music.

      Nick moves off, searches in the brush, discovers something.

                                    NICK (CONT'D)
                    Hank, there's an iPod over here.

      Without touching it, Nick leans in, checks the iPod screen. 
      Name of the song (Your Wildest Dreams) scrolls past.


      Nick and Hank head for their desks.

                                    NICK
                    Until we get the DNA results, I'll
                    run a database on violent predators
                    in the area...

      Nick glances at an ANGRY PERP, a tatted up young man
      handcuffed to a desk, being interviewed by a detective.

                                    NICK (CONT'D)
                    We should also take another look at
                    the Munson Creek Falls attack.

                                    HANK
                    Sounds like you'll be busy.  I'll
                    take the iPod down for prints...                                                                                        8.

      Angry Perp looks at Nick as they pass.  His face suddenly
      MORPHS into the face of an OWL.  But just for an instant. 
      Then he's Angry Perp again.  And turns away.

      Nick's so startled he collides with an older UNIFORM SERGEANT
      BLAKNIKOFF carrying coffee.  Coffee spills.

                                      SERGEANT BLAKNIKOFF
                    Hey!  Watch where you're goin',

                                    NICK
                    Sorry.

      Nick glances back at Perp.  Who is still just an Angry Perp.*


      Marie checks her side view mirrors.  Satisfied she's not
      being followed, she drives down the street to a --


      Marie pries open a small pill box, washes down a handful of

      Nick and Hank at their desks, staring at computer screens. 
      Hank's phone rings.  He picks up as:

                    rise to the kind of violence we saw
                    out there this morning.

                    she could be really hurt.  *

      Nick sees a photo-magnet on the refrigerator.

                                    HANK
                    D'ya know what kind of running shoes

                    Hank.

      Nick shows the photo magnet to Hank.  Sylvie and the roommate,
      arms around each other, beer cans in hand.  BOTH OF THEM
      WEAR THE RED HOODED UNIVERSITY SWEATSHIRTS.*


      Juliette lets herself in.  Flicks on the lights and GASPS
      when she sees Marie standing right next to her.

      Nick lets himself in.  All is quiet.  He looks around.

                                    NICK
                    Juliette?

      He HEARS LAUGHTER coming from the kitchen.  He heads for:


      Juliette and Marie are at the kitchen table laughing, bottle
      of wine open between them.  Nick enters.

                    She was here when I got home.

                    Sorry for the short notice.

                                    NICK
                    What notice?

                    You didn't know she was coming?

                    to do something I usually assume I

                    How are you doing?  Are you okay?

                    Give us a hug.

      He does, exchanging a look with Juliette.

                                      JULIETTE
                    She was telling me some pretty funny
                    stories about when you were little.

                          (looks at Marie)

                    Among others.

      Nick starts to pull away but Marie holds tight and whispers
      in his ear:

                                      MARIE
                    We need to talk.

      She lets go, staring intently at him.  He's a little unnerved
      by her tone.

                                    NICK
                    I'm going to take a walk with Marie.*

                                      JULIETTE
                    Okay.  I'll make some dinner. 
                    Anything special?

                                      MARIE
                    Anything is fine, dear.


      Nick is seated, absentmindedly doodling in his police
      notebook.  He pauses and stares at what he's been drawing,
      surprised to discover --

      His drawing looks remarkably like the TROLL version of Mr.
      Hulda.  He rips it out, crumples it up and throws it away as*
      a young FEMALE DOCTOR enters.

                                      DOCTOR LEVY
                    She's conscious now.  You can see
                    her for a few minutes but then I'll
                    need to run some tests.


      Nick enters.  Marie is hooked up to I.V. and monitors.  She
      looks up weakly.

                                      MARIE
                    God I'm sick of hospitals.                                                                                      17.

      He moves up, takes her hand.

                                      MARIE (CONT'D)
                    You saw him, didn't you.  You saw
                    who Mr. Hulda really was.*

                                    NICK
                    I don't know what I saw, I don't
                    know what's happening.

                                      MARIE
                    That's why I came.  I knew the
                      transition was starting.

                                    NICK
                    I don't understand...

                    We have the ability to see what others
                    can't.  When they lose control, they*
                    can't hide, we see them for who they*
                    are.  The stories are real.  What*
                    they wrote really happened.  You're*
                    one of the last descendants. 

                                    NICK
                    This isn't possible.

                                      MARIE
                    We didn't move all the time because
                    of my job, we moved because we had
                    to.  I know it's a lot and I wish I
                    had more time, but everything is in
                    my trailer.  Sweetie, there's so
                    much you still don't know...
                          (caresses his cheek)
                    I love you, if there's a way I could
                    have stopped this I would have...
                    but none of us have ever been able
                    to escape it... you're vulnerable
                    now, you have to be careful...

      Marie suddenly stops, HEARING a NOISE in the hallway.  She
      turns, watches a couple of ORDERLIES run past with a CRASH*
      CART. She turns back to Nick, pulling him even closer.*

                    Your parents didn't die in the
                    crash...

                                    NICK
                    Marie, you need to rest --

                                      MARIE
                    -- they were murdered.                                                                                      18.*

      She presses something into his hand, a small, circular crystal*
      in the shape of a CAT'S EYE with a bright green center.  *

      Nick stares at Marie in disbelief.*

                                      MARIE (CONT'D)*
                    Don't ever lose it.  If you do --*

      Doctor Levy enters, interrupting Marie.*

                                      DOCTOR LEVY
                    Sorry Mr. Burckhardt...

      Nick looks at Marie, so many unanswered questions.

                                      DOCTOR LEVY (CONT'D)
                    You can see her again tomorrow.

        Reluctantly, Nick exits.


      Nick walks down the long hallway, emotions churning, hears a*
      COMMOTION in a room as he passes.*

      Nick's POV of the orderlies with the crash cart and a doctor*
      trying to revive a patient under cardiac arrest.*

                                      DOCTOR*
                    Clear!*

      Electricity JOLTS through the body of the patient and for a*
      moment Nick sees GREEN SKIN, BULGING EYES, HUGE WARTS - the*
      face of a frog. *

      Off Nick --*

                                      END OF ACT ONE*                                                                                      19.

                                          ACT TWO


      Nick, emotionally drained, is on the other side of the table
      from two DETECTIVES in suits.

                                    NICK
                    We were attacked from behind.  I
                    tried to stop him, but he knocked me
                    down and went after my aunt.  I pulled
                    my weapon and fired.  I hit him in
                    the neck.  It should have dropped
                    him but it didn't.  He came at me.

                                      DETECTIVE # 1
                    Then you shot him again.

                                    NICK
                    Yes.

                                      DETECTIVE # 2
                    You emptied your clip.

                                    NICK
                    I did what was necessary under the
                      circumstances.

                                      DETECTIVE # 2
                    Do you know what the relationship
                    was between your aunt and this Mr.
                    Hulda?*

                                    NICK
                    ...all I know is she recognized him.

                                      DETECTIVE # 1
                    But you'd never seen him before
                    tonight.

                                    NICK
                    No.

                                      DETECTIVE # 2
                    And she'd never mentioned him before?

                                    NICK
                    No.

      KNOCK on the door.  Hank peers in.

                                    HANK
                          (to detectives)
                    Sorry to bother you guys, but I got
                    a line on Hulda.  Turns out he's*
                    from Boise, Idaho.  Worked there as
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      20.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    an accountant three years ago.  But
                    when I ran his prints, it came back
                    as a Mr. Lindo, who lived in Chicago
                    and was wanted for assault, rape and
                    murder.  There's also warrants
                    matching those prints in Florida and
                    Alabama, under the name Roberts.

      Lets that sink in.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    Captain wants to see him.  You good?

                                      DETECTIVE # 1
                    Yeah, good for now.

      Hank and Nick exit, head towards their desks.

                                    NICK
                    He was wanted for assault, rape and
                    murder?

                                    HANK
                    Don't let the comb-over throw you,
                    this was a bad guy...

      They've arrived at the Captain's office.*

                                    NICK
                    Am I in trouble?

                                    HANK
                    Guess you'll find out.


      CAPTAIN ERICSON, 50, is behind his desk studying Hulda's*
      file folder, wanted posters, etc. Nick enters.  Hank stays
      out, pulling the door shut.

                                    NICK
                    You wanted to see me sir?

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                          (looks up)
                    If you had to shoot somebody, you
                    sure picked the right guy.  I just
                    got off the phone with the F.B.I.
                    There were seventeen warrants out on
                    him.  How you doin', you holding up?

                                    NICK
                    Yes sir.                                                                                      21.

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                    First shooting is no small thing. 
                    You'll be required to see the police
                      psychologist.*

                                    NICK
                    Okay.

      Ericson eyes Nick for a moment, trying to read his mental
      state.

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                    Make sure you do.

      Nick exits.


      Nick sees Juliette across the room.  She crosses to him,
      goes into his arms.

                                    NICK
                    You okay?

                                      JULIETTE
                    Yeah, I'm fine.  How's Marie?

                                    NICK
                    As well as can be expected I guess.

                                      JULIETTE
                    How 'bout you?

                                    NICK
                    I don't know... I'm too tired to
                    know.

      They just cling to each other.


      Juliette is asleep in Nick's arms.  He's staring at the
      ceiling.  He looks over at her, carefully disengages himself
      without waking her, goes to the window and looks out at the
      trailer parked in the back yard.                                                                                      22.*


      The door opens, Nick enters, looks at the amazing, tricked*
      out interior hidden from prying eyes by the brightly colored*
      curtains.  Bedroom, kitchen, living room area.  Shelves of*
      books and vials filled with strange objects and colorful*
      liquids.  A couple of them have the skull and crossbones on*
      them.  Nearby are some very oddly shaped skulls, not quite*
      human, not quite animal.  The trailer is an odd cross between*
      a library and a laboratory. 

      Nick opens a cabinet.  Full of unusual weapons, cross bow,*
      short sword, black jack, cat o'nine tails, and a few things*
      we have no names for.

      On a table is a large open portfolio-sized book, handwritten*
      words scrawled across one page, on the opposite page sketches
      of a beautiful looking woman, next to her in the same
      clothing, a hideous looking witch-like CRONE.

      Neatly printed beneath each drawing are the important stats: 
      DOB, WT, HT, LAST KNOWN RESIDENCE, ETC. Almost like a police
      report.  He flips through the book, revealing page after
      page with various humans opposite their fairy tale creature
        counterpart.  Each with the STATS listed below.

      Behind a cushion Nick finds a WORK IN PROGRESS -- another*
      sketching: Mr. Hulda in his human form and Mr. Hulda as the*
      grotesque troll-like monster that attacked him.

      Nick stares hard at Hulda.  Then he notices on the table an*
      odd sculpture -- the face of a black cat with a wide open*
      mouth, one closed eye and one empty eye socket.  Nick stares*
      at the cat face, then suddenly reaches into his pocked and*
      pulls out the crystal cat's eye that Marie gave him.  It*
      looks to be about the right size for the empty eye socket.*

      He very tentatively reaches forward and places the cat's eye*
      in the socket.  Doesn't quite fit.  He puts his thumb on the*
      eyeball and pushes down.  It CLICKS into place.  And the*
      wide open mouth slowly begins to fill with a glowing liquid.*

                                      NICK*
                    What the hell...*

      The cat's mouth fills with liquid and in the liquid Nick*
      sees a vision start to coalesce.  He leans closer, he's seeing*
      some kind of warrior fighting a mythical beast.  The warrior*
      is a woman, wielding a sword in one hand and a multi-bladed*
      dagger in the other.  Nick is fascinated by what he's seeing. *
      Almost as if he's watching some strange video game.  The*
      female warrior destroys the beast, lopping off its head with*
      her sword.  For the first time she turns towards us and we*
      realize we are watching Marie, younger by twenty years. *
      She's about to speak, to whoever might be watching, when --*

      Suddenly the trailer door is flung open behind him.*                                                                                      23.

                                    NICK (CONT'D)
                    Ahh!

      Startled, Nick spins, knocking into the table -- the cat*
      face falls to the floor --*

      THE EYE dislodges and rolls under the table.  The eye rolls*
      to a stop and MAGICALLY VANISHES from SIGHT.*

      Expecting the worst, Nick sees Juliette in her robe and*
      slippers in the doorway.

                                      JULIETTE
                    How long have you been down here?

                                    NICK
                      I couldn't sleep.

      She looks around at the interior.

                                    NICK (CONT'D)*
                    I'm sorry, let's go back to bed.*

      Trying to keep her from seeing anything, Nick moves to the*
      door and hustles her out.*

                                      JULIETTE*
                    What is all that stuff?*

                                      NICK*
                    I don't know, I'll deal with it later. *


      Hank is on the phone.

                                    HANK
                    Send me the picture, I need a*
                      picture... now would be better.*

      Hank hangs up as Nick approaches, envelope in hand,*

                                      NICK*
                    Take a look at the lab report, DNA
                    of the attacker is inconclusive. 
                    Still don't know if we're lookin'
                    for man or beast.

      Hank pulls a photo out of the printer.*

                                    HANK
                    Well we got a lead if it wears boots.*

      Shows PHOTO of a HIKING BOOT to Nick.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    Based on the plaster cast, this is
                    the boot we're lookin' for.


      CLOSE ON BOOTS in Nick's hands.  A nice new pair.  Exact
      match for the ones we saw on the Postman.

      Nick and Hank face the STORE MANAGER who is referring to
      data on his iPad.

                                      MANAGER
                    ... we sold forty-two pair in the*
                    last six months, you're looking for*
                    size ten... we sold a dozen.

                                    NICK
                    You keep a data base on customers?

                                      MANAGER
                    On credit cards, yes, but not on
                    cash transactions.

                                    HANK
                    We'll take what you got.

                                      MANAGER
                    We're not the only store in town
                    that sells these, you know.

                                    HANK
                          (referring to his
                            list)
                    Yeah, we know.

      Nick's cell RINGS.  He moves off to answer.

                                    HANK (CONT'D)
                    Can you print us out a list?

                                      MANAGER
                    Yeah, but don't you need a warrant
                    or something?

                                    HANK
                    If I needed a warrant, I'd have a
                    warrant.  Don't ya' think?

      Manager moves off.  Hank looks to Nick on his cell.  Nick
      hangs up.

                                    NICK
                    I gotta go to the hospital.  Marie's
                    in a coma.                                                                                      26.


      Nick walks down a hall with Doctor Levy.

                                      DOCTOR LEVY
                    About an hour ago the nurse went to
                    check on her and discovered she
                    couldn't wake her.  There was a sudden
                    spike at ten thirty this morning on
                    the EKG.  We're still examining that
                    event, but I have nothing definitive
                    to tell you right now.  We've moved
                    her to I.C.U. and she's stable.

      Dr. Levy leads Nick to the I.C.U unit.  Through the window
      we can see Marie, oxygen mask over her face in the I.C.U.,
      tubed and monitored.

                                    NICK
                    Is there anyway to know if she'll
                    come out of this?

                                    DR. LEVY
                    All we can do is wait... did you
                    know about the scars?

                                    NICK
                    What scars?


      Dr. Levy pulls aside the sheet, revealing Marie's body. 
      Scars of all sizes and shapes.

                                    DR. LEVY
                    A lot of these look like knife wounds.

      Dr. Levy looks up at Nick who is stunned.

                                    DR. LEVY (CONT'D)
                    What line of work was she in?

                                    NICK
                    She was a... librarian.

      Nick just stares down at Marie and the scars.  There's so
      much he didn't know.*


      Room full of cops, including Nick and Hank.  Captain Ericson
      is running the kidnap task force.

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                    She's missing now for four hours and
                    fifteen minutes.  We don't know what
                    we got, pedophile, ransom, but we
                    know we gotta move fast.

      A MAP is now projected on the wall, showing the Robin Howell's*
      usual route from school to grandpa's house.*

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON (CONT'D)
                    We split into teams.  Section off
                    the path she would have taken from
                    school.*
                          (pointing at map)
                    It's a mile and four tenths from
                    school to the house.
                          (turns back to cops)
                    Make sure you have copies of the
                    photo and the map.  You all know
                    your sections, let's get out there.

      Cops hustle out.  Nick stops in front of Capt. Ericson.

                                    NICK
                    Captain, the university student was
                    wearing a red sweatshirt with a hood
                    when she was attacked.

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                    The one that was torn to pieces?

                                    HANK
                    Yeah.

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                    Then let's hope it's not the same
                    guy.


      The blood-spattered boot on the pedal is a familiar one.                                                                                      29.

      In the BACK OF THE TRUCK, several large mail bags on the
      floor.  All empty except for one.  The one that's kicking
      and moving.  We HEAR a muffled WHIMPER.


      Nick takes the man to the floor as Hank comes in behind, gun
      drawn.  The guy tries to get up, Nick slams him down.

                                    NICK
                    Don't move!

      Nick whips out handcuffs, slapping them on the guy.

                                    NICK (CONT'D)
                    Where is she?!  WHERE IS SHE?!

      Guy looks up, terrified.  By the way, his name is EDDY MONROE.                                                                                      32.

                                      END OF ACT TWO                                                                                      33.

                                        ACT THREE


      Also crawling with cops, searching every square inch:

      INSIDE THE ATTIC -- flashlights sweep over the dusty cobwebs,
      trunks are opened, contents strewn about.

      BEDROOMS - are searched.

      GARAGE - ditto.


      Nick tears apart a closet, clothes are already strewn
      everywhere but Nick's looking for the boots.

      He throws a pair of boots aside, wrong kind.


      Nick enters, frustrated.  Cops pry open a chest.  Empty.

                                    NICK
                    I know she's here somewhere.

                                      SERGEANT BLAKNIKOFF
                    If you got another place to look,
                    we'll look.  But we've torn this
                    place apart.

      Hank grabs Nick by the arm and pulling him outside.

                                    HANK
                    What are we doin' here?


      Hank stands next to Nick facing --

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                    With the attack on your Aunt and the
                    shooting, you've been under a lot of
                    pressure.  It's probably my fault
                    for not giving you some time off.*

                                    NICK
                    I thought I had him.

                                      CAPTAIN ERICSON
                    I know you did, but it cost us a lot
                    of resources and valuable time, we
                    can't afford to make mistakes right
                    now.  Look, all I want you to do is
                    forget about this, go home and get a
                    good night's sleep.
                          (to Hank)
                    Okay.

                                    HANK
                    Copy that.


      Door opens, hands reach in, grab the bulky mailbag, we hear
      a MUFFLED SCREAM as the hands drag the mail bag out.  The
      door slams shut.


      Juliette, hair wet, towel wrapped around her, changes into
      her bedclothes.  She HEARS a car drive up, moves to the*
      window.*

      Sees Nick getting out of his car.  But instead of coming to*
      the house, he heads for the trailer.  Puzzled, she watches*
      him enter the trailer.*


      Door opens, Nick enters.  He goes right to the cat sculpture*
      on the floor.  But the crystal cat's eye is missing.  He*
      gets down on his hands and knees, searching the floor for*
      it.  He can't find it anywhere.  He suddenly gets up.*


      Juliette comes down the stairs as Nick enters, one of Marie's
      large portfolios in one hand, and the cat faced sculpture in*
      the other.*

                                      JULIETTE
                    Hi, honey.

      She sees the serious look on his face.

                                      JULIETTE (CONT'D)
                    What's wrong?

                                    NICK
                    We're gonna need something to drink.


      Marie's PORTFOLIO is on the table next to an empty bottle of
      wine.  Juliette holds her nearly empty glass, staring at
      Nick who is holding the cat sculpture.  Nick is amped and*
      frazzled, as he tries to explain --*

                                      NICK*
                    ...and then I put the eye in and it*
                    filled with some kind of glowing*
                    liquid and then I could see this*
                    woman warrior fighting a sort of*

                                    NICK (CONT'D)
                      beast/thing.  And she killed it and*
                    she turned and it was Marie.

                                      JULIETTE*
                    Your aunt?*

                                      NICK*
                    Yes.  Only she was a lot younger,*
                    like when she was taking care of me.*

                                      JULIETTE*
                    Okaayyy.  So why don't you put the*
                    eye in now so I can see... what you*
                    saw.*

                                      NICK*
                    I would, that's what I was going to*
                    do, but I couldn't find it.*

                                      JULIETTE*
                    Nick, you're not making sense.

                                    NICK
                    Because it doesn't make sense.  All*
                    right forget the cat and the eye,*
                    look at the book.*

      Nick flips through the book.*

                                    NICK (CONT'D)
                    The man I shot was not a man.*

                                      JULIETTE
                    I saw him.  The police saw him.*

      Nick finds the page with Hulda's drawing on it.*

                                      NICK*
                          (re: troll)
                    This is what I shot.

      She stares at the sketch of the troll like figure.

                                      JULIETTE
                    You were upset, the mind can really
                    twist up reality --

                                    NICK
                    It wasn't like that.  I know what I
                    saw.  And he's not the only one.

                                      JULIETTE
                          (beat)
                    What do you mean he's not the only
                    one...?                                                                                      37.*

                                    NICK
                    I saw this beautiful young woman
                    turn into a, I don't know, an old...*
                    like hag.  And then there was this
                    guy in the police station, under
                    arrest, and he looked at me and he
                    had a face that looked like an owl.

                                      JULIETTE
                          (evenly)
                    Somebody arrested an owl?

                                    NICK
                    I know how this sounds, Juli, I know
                    what you must be thinking.  I'm not*
                    going to even get into the frog guy. *
                    You must be thinking I'm absolutely*
                    out of my mind crazy.  How do you*
                    think I feel telling you this stuff?! *
                    I don't want to tell this to anybody,*
                    but I have to tell you.  You're the*
                    only one I can trust.

                                      JULIETTE
                    Nick, sit down, look at me.

      Nick stares at her for a moment, then sits.*

                                      JULIETTE (CONT'D)*
                    Your Aunt was almost killed, and you*
                    shot the man who attacked her --
                          (re: book)
                    Then you found all her strange
                    drawings, and this cat thing, I mean,*
                    no wonder you're having trouble making*
                    sense of it all.  Sometimes things*
                    don't make sense.  Your aunt is sick,*
                    dying and delusional.*

      They both stare at each other.  He looks back down at the*
      book, frustrated.*

                                      JULIETTE (CONT'D)
                    Remember when my mom died?  I couldn't
                    get out of bed, I couldn't think
                    straight, I couldn't sleep, I was
                    putting the milk in the dryer.
                          (beat)
                    I never told you this but... I thought
                    I saw her -- more than once.  And it
                    really freaked me out.  You haven't
                    slept in two days.
                          (gets up)
                    I think it's time we stopped talking
                    so you can get some rest.
                          (takes his hand)
                    I love you.                                                                                      38.

      Nick takes her hand; she pulls him up.  They stare at each
      other for a moment.

                                    NICK
                    I love you, too.

                                      JULIETTE
                    It's gonna be okay.

      He nods but he's not feeling any better.  As they head
      upstairs, CAMERA PUSHES IN ON one of the scarier drawings. 
      Half man, half wolf CREATURES.

                                      JULIETTE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Marie's drawings are just things she
                    imagined.  They were in her head. 
                    They're not real.


      Juliette is asleep in bed.  Alone.  PAN TO NICK dressed in*
      black, watching her.  He quietly slips out.*


      Monroe pulls a couple a beers from the fridge, hands one to
      Nick who is still shook up, has no idea what to expect now.

      Monroe stares hard at Nick, then:

                                      MONROE
                    You know I've never seen one of you
                    before.*

                                      NICK*
                    What the hell are you talking about?*

                                      MONROE
                    Heard about you guys all my life. *
                    Never thought I'd see one up close.
                          (drinks)
                    A Grimm.  What d'ya' know.

                                    NICK
                    You know about me?

                                      MONROE

      The Postman enters the dark house.  Flicks on a light.  The
      home is surprisingly cheery, neat and tidy; window treatments,
      throw rugs, puffy pillows on the furniture.  An astoundingly
      large collection of Hummel figurines line the shelves.                                                                                      45.

      Postman pushes aside a table careful not to knock over the
      vase of fresh flowers; he pulls aside a throw rug, revealing
      a trap door.


      The trap door opens.  Postman carries the sack down the trap
      door stairs, flicks on a light.

      Once again we are surprised to discover a charming little
      girl's room with a canopied bed, a dresser, side tables,
      somewhat Germanic.

      Continuing to HUM, the Postman puts the bag on the bed, unties
      it and dumps Robin out of it, surprisingly gently.  She's*
      wearing her red hoodie.  She's terrified.

                    What do you say we hang this up.

      He takes off her red hoody.  Whistling the TUNE, he goes to
      a wooden armoire, adorned with hand-carved bears.  Opens the
      doors.

      We see several other RED HOODIES, many of them ripped and
      torn.  He stares at them and closes the door.

      Monroe drives, his window down, his head halfway out.  Nick

      Postman pulls off his boots, hesitates, staring at the dried
      blood on them.


      CLOSE ON blood-stained BOOTS.  Postman tries to clean off
      the dried blood with peroxide and cotton balls.  He rubs and
      rubs and rubs, but when he pulls the cotton away, the stain
      is still there.  Just like in Macbeth.

                                    HANK
                    Nick?

                                    NICK
                    I need back up.  Now.

                                    HANK
                          (throws back the covers)
                    Where are you?                                                                                      50.


      The Postman, now wearing house slippers, a bright yellow
      cardigan and a bow tie, whistles "Once Upon a Time in Your
      Wildest Dreams" as he carries the boots to a fire place.

      He opens the glass doors and places the boots in the roaring
      fire.  Shuts the glass doors.  Stares at the fire, satisfied.

      He HEARS something in the distance from outside.  Pauses. 
      Sniffs the air.  Moves to the PICTURE WINDOW.  Looks out
      into the dark night.

      Then he HEARS a TAPPING from inside.  Robin's knocking on*
      the trap door from below.  Postman turns away from the window
      JUST AS -- we see --

      NICK - eighty yards in the distance, dashing back towards
      the stream.

      THE POSTMAN - bends over the trap door.  Hearing:

                                      ROBIN'S VOICE*
                    I want to go home...

      He flings open the trap door, revealing the scared little
      girl.  Staring up at him.

                                      POSTMAN
                    I told you.  You ARE home.


      The Postman straightens the rug over the trap door and puts
      the table with the flower vase back on it, rearranging the*
      flowers to his liking.*

      He stiffens, sensing something.  Postman turns slowly.  Looks*
      at the door.  Expression darkening as his eyes narrow and*
      his nostrils flare. *

      The doorbell RINGS.*

      Postman takes a deep breath, calming and controlling himself. *
      Putting on a smile.  A subtle transformation from evil to*
      benign.*


      Robin, bound and gagged on the bed, hears FOOTSTEPS and*
      MUFFLED voices above.  She looks up, terrified.


      The quaint and charming cottage.  They glance at the Hummel
      figurines, the fire crackling in the fire place.

                                      POSTMAN
                    Would you like some coffee or hot
                      chocolate?  It's all fair trade.

                                    HANK
                    No thanks.

                                      POSTMAN
                    We can sit in the living room...

      Postman motions to a love seat with elaborately crocheted
      pillows.  Woodsy scenes, happy German children, etc.

                                    HANK
                    Nice pillows.

                                      POSTMAN
                      I crocheted them myself.
                          (leans in)
                    Not that I tell everyone.

      We HEAR a DING from the kitchen.

                                      POSTMAN (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, pot pie's done.  Just give me
                    a second.

      The Postman heads for the kitchen.  Hank shoots Nick a look,
      then moves to study the incredible wall of Hummel figurines. 
      Nick moves up.  Hank looks over.

                                    HANK
                          (quietly)
                    Are you kidding me?

                                    NICK
                    Hank, I really believe this is the
                    right guy...
                          (off Hank' look)
                    I think.  This time.                                                                                      54.

      Nick looks around a little desperately.  Sees a secretary
      desk.  He quickly pulls down the top, revealing a pile of
      papers and mail.  Nick shuffles through the papers.

      Hank glances toward the kitchen door.

                                    HANK
                          (quietly)
                    What are you -- we don't have a
                    warrant.

                                    NICK
                    Got it!
                          (closes secretary
                            desk)
                    His name is Ditmarsch.  Errol
                      Ditmarsch.

                                    HANK
                    Great.  Case solved.

      Hank shoots Nick a look and then heads for the kitchen,
      walking right ACROSS THE THROW RUG, PAST THE TABLE WITH THE
      VASE FULL OF FLOWERS.


      Robin watches the ceiling, following the SOUND of the*
      FOOTSTEPS with her eyes.


      The Postman who is now wearing a plaid apron and oven mitts,
      is bending over the oven, pulling out a perfectly browned
      chicken pot pie. *

                                    HANK
                    Mr. Ditmarsch.

      Caught off guard, the Postman's face darkens briefly as Hank*
      and Nick enter the kitchen.  Postman quickly controls his*
      emotions.*

                                      POSTMAN
                    Sorry this is taking so long, but
                    you know how delicate crusts are.

      Nick looks around at the Old World kitchen.  Bronze pots
      hang from the rafters, German sausages dangle from wooden
      pegs.  Large sharp knives on display next to a meat grinder,
      and a sausage stuffer.

      Postman puts pot pie on butcher block to cool, pulling off
      oven mitts and apron.  Turns and studies Nick for a moment. 
      Something about Nick disturbs him.  But he can't let on.                                                                                      55.

                                    HANK
                    What kind of work do you do?

                                      POSTMAN
                    I work for the government, like you.
                          (then)
                    I'm a Postman.  Not the most glamorous
                    job but I like it.  Keeps me outdoors,
                    I love nature.

                                    NICK
                    Where were you today between two and
                    four o'clock?

                                      POSTMAN
                    On my route.  All day.  I know Postmen
                    get blamed for a lot of things, but
                    we're not all bad.  I'd love to be
                    helpful, but I'd like to know what
                    this is about.

      Nick shows him a PHOTO of Robin Howell.*

                                    NICK
                    This little girl went missing earlier
                    today.

                                      POSTMAN
                    Oh my god, that's awful... you don't
                    think I had anything to do with this,
                    do you?

                                    HANK
                    We just have to run down every
                      possibility.

                                      POSTMAN
                    What possibility could have led you
                    to me?

                                    NICK
                    We're looking for some boots.

      The Postman just looks at Nick, smiles, and:

                                      POSTMAN
                    Feel free to look anywhere you want.

                                    HANK
                    I don't think that's necessary, we've
                    wasted enough of your time.

                                    NICK
                    No, no, I want to check the bedroom.

                                      POSTMAN
                    Be my guest.                                                                                      56.


      Nick flings open the closet, revealing a neat row of shoes,
      no boots.  Nick, frustrated, opens a chest at the foot of
      the bed, filled with blankets.

      Hank leans against the doorway, watching as Nick goes down
      on the floor and looks under the bed.

                                    HANK
                    Nick.  If this guy had something to
                    hide, he would have thrown us out of
                    here.  I'm leaving.  I want to keep
                    my job.

      Hank heads out, Nick looks around the room one more time,
      then dejectedly follows.


      Robin's eyes continue to follow the sounds of more footsteps,*
      crossing the floor above her.  Tears in her eyes.


      Nick and Hank move to the front door.  They HEAR whistling
      just before the Postman appears from the kitchen.  He stops
      whistling when he sees them.

                                      POSTMAN
                    Anything else?

                                    HANK
                    No.  Thanks for your time.

      Hank opens the door, exits.  Nick glances back at the Postman,
      then follows Hank out.  The door shuts.  The Postman moves
      to the window, watching them walk away.


      Dark except for the flickering fireplace.

      Hank and Nick kick open the door and enter.  Guns drawn.  No
      Postman in sight.  Hank reaches for the wall switch, flicks
      it, but no light.  Hank silently signals Nick to search one
      part of the house while he searches another.


      Nick enters the dark kitchen.  Tries the light.  No luck. 
      Looks around at all the knives glistening in the moonlight. 
      The largest one missing.

      Meanwhile Hank moves past the Hummel collection which looks
      oddly menacing in the dancing firelight.

                                    NICK
                    Hank!  He's got a knife!

      As Hank turns, the Postman leaps from the shadows.  Before
      he can fire, Hank is knocked to the floor.

      Hank moves his head just in time to avoid the blade which is
      coming down at him.

      The blade slams into the floor with such force that it is
      buried up to the hilt.

      Hank struggles for his feet, is picked off the ground and
      hurled into the Hummel collection which crashes to the floor --


      Robin stares up at the ceiling HEARING the horrendous fight*
      above.  She closes her eyes, scared to death.


      NICK - runs in, trying to get a shot off as the Postman lunges
      at him.  From Nick's POV THE POSTMAN IS IN FULL BLUTBAD FACE.

      Nick's gun fires, hitting the Postman but not slowing him
      down.  Nick is knocked off his feet into the table, knocking
      it over as he crashes to the floor, flower vase shattering.

      THE POSTMAN - tears out the door.                                                                                      58.

      HANK - is on his knees, gun in hand.

      The POSTMAN - running FAST.  Inhumanly fast.  Hank empties
      his gun.

      THE POSTMAN - crumples as the bullets tear into him.


      CLOSE ON BREAKER BOX - Nick's hand flicks on the master
      switch.

      The LIGHTS come on in the house.

      Hank and Nick search the house, opening closets, hope chests,
      calling the girl's name -- "Robin!  Robin!"*


      Robin hears her name being called.  She struggles to get*
      loose from the brightly colored ropes that bind her hands
      and feet.


      They move back into the living room.  Frustrated.

                                    HANK
                    Damn it, she's not here.
                          (pulls his cell phone)
                    We have to call it in.

      Nick stops, sees the WATER FROM THE BROKEN VASE puddled on
      the floor.  Draining slowing into a crack in the floor.                                                                                      59.

      Nick flings aside the rug, revealing the trap door.

                                    NICK
                    Hank!

      Nick rips open the trap door.


      Robin sees the trap door open, and Nick scramble down, not*
      sure what to expect.

      Nick sees her.

                                    NICK
                    Hank!  She's here!

      He moves to the bed.  Starts untying her, reassures her as
      Hank comes clattering down the stairs:

                                    NICK (CONT'D)
                    It's okay, honey.  We're police.

      Hank sees her, relieved, moving to help.

                                    HANK
                    I don't how you did it, but you did
                    it.


      CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER - "Little Girl Found - Kidnapper Killed
      by Police".  File PHOTOS of Hank and Nick.

      Monroe is having his morning coffee, looking at the paper. 
      His house is now cleaned up.  KNOCK at the door.                                                                                      60.

      He gets up, opens the front door, revealing Nick.

                                      MONROE
                    Didn't expect to see you again - at
                    least not in one piece.

                                    NICK
                    I just wanted to say thanks.

                                      MONROE
                    He knew I helped you, didn't he.

                                    NICK
                    I don't know.

                                      MONROE
                    At least he's dead.  Otherwise he'd
                    be looking for me.  He was my cousin. 
                    Father's side.  We never got along
                          (stares at Nick, hard)
                    He had a lot of family... who loved
                    him.  Too bad you got your picture
                    in the paper.  Gonna make it easier
                    to find you.

      Beat.

                                    NICK
                    My aunt told me my parents were
                    murdered.

                                      MONROE
                    What's that got to do with me.

                                    NICK
                    I might need your help again sometime.

                                      MONROE
                    ...we'll see.

      He shuts the door on Nick who stares at the closed door then
      walks away.


      Nick sits holding Marie's hand.  She is still unconscious.*

      He touches a jagged scar on the back of her hand.  Her hand*
      moves, taking him by surprise.  He looks up, her eyes are*
      open, staring at him.*

                                      MARIE*
                    It isn't lost, you just have to stop*
                    looking for it... so it can find*
                    you.

      Her smile fades.*

                                      NICK*
                    Marie...*

      But the light has gone out of her eyes and the medical alarms*
      go off as she flatlines.  Nick stands up suddenly, staggers,*
      as some powerful surge knocks him to his knees.  He falls to*
      the floor as orderlies and nurses run in.*

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK:*
