 
     Organ music emanates from inside as PARISHIONERS walk into 
     the church.  An USHER passes out programs. 
 
                         NARRATOR (V.O.) 
               People go to church for a lot of different 
               reasons.  Some for community, some for 
               appearances.  For others, and it may be 
               very few, it's a matter of true faith. 
               The simple fact is, life is hard for most 
               people.  By the end of a long week, the 
               soul can be as devoid of spirit as 
               Everwood's Taggart Mine is empty of ore. 
               Only, if you're lucky, when you come here, 
               you leave with something more than you 
               came in with. 
 
     The last of the parishioners hurry up the stairs as the music 
     finishes.  DELIA and ANDY are among them. 
 
                         DELIA 
               See?  I told you.  Everyone else is 
               wearing a hat. 
 
     They take their programs and walk inside. 
 
 
     Delia and EPHRAM eat cereal nearby, while Andy packs Delia's 
     lunch and a coat-wearing NINA looks on. 
 
                         NINA 
               Poor Reverend Keyes.  It's just 
               mortifying. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               He didn't come back out for twenty 
               minutes.  And when he did, he was covered 
               in ointment. 
 
                         DELIA 
               It was fun.  We got to sing extra songs. 
 
                         NINA 
               So are you two going to make this church 
               thing a regular event? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
                   (shaking his head) 
               Delia asked me to take her.  It was more 
               of an exploratory mission. 
 
                         NINA 
               You're going next week though, right? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Oh, you don't want too much of a good 
               thing, now do you... 
 
                         NINA 
               I meant for the "Hope Service." 
                   (off Brown) 
               Once a year Reverend Keyes makes what's 
               known as his Hope speech.  The town fills 
               the place.  No matter their denomination. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Must be pretty inspirational. 
 
                         NINA 
               It can be.  But that's not why every one 
               really goes. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               I don't get it. 
 
 
 
     Everwood - "Till Death Do Us Part"   9/11/02   Full White   5. 
 
 
 
 
                         NINA 
               The reverend picks the person whom he 
               feels best exemplifies hope within the 
               community.  Everyone wants to get picked. 
               Or at least see who else is gonna get 
               picked. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Ah, competitiveness springs eternal. 
 
                         NINA 
               Something like that.  There's not too much 
               suspense though, Irv Harper's won it three 
               years running. 
 
     Ephram rises, handing Andy a slip of paper. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Could you sign this? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               What am I signing? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Permission slip.  For a field trip to a 
               mine. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Sounds educational. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Yes.  What kind of future will I have 
               without knowing how a mine operates? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               C'mon, Ephram.  You don't wanna be the 
               only kid in your school who doesn't know 
               where coal comes from? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
                   (takes back the slip) 
               Silver, dad.  In Colorado it's silver. 
 
                         NINA 
               Okay, the good ship Feeney is shoving 
               off... 
 
     Delia, coat on, approaches.  Andy hands her a lunch. 
 
                         DELIA 
               Bye, Daddy. 
 
 
 
     Everwood - "Till Death Do Us Part"   9/11/02   Full White   6. 
 
 
 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               See ya, kiddo.  Thanks, Nina.  I'll take 
               Sam and her one day this week. 
 
                         NINA 
               No problem. 
 
     They leave.  Ephram looks down at his form and hesitates. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Hey, Dad.  Y'know, I don't... have to go 
               on this. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Why wouldn't you? 
 
                         EPHRAM 
                   (treading lightly) 
               I don't know. I figured tomorrow... I 
               know it's your anniversary... 
 
     Andy doesn't seem to flinch.  But we can tell he knows very 
     well what tomorrow is. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Don't worry about that. Your mother never 
               liked to make a big deal out of our 
               anniversary anyway. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Since when?  Last year you guys flew off 
               to Hawaii. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Yeah, well.  It was one of the... smaller 
               islands.  We had a coupon. 
                   (off Ephram) 
               Your concern is appreciated, Ephram, but 
               I'm fine.  Now stop loitering.  Get to 
               school. 
 
     Andy starts clearing the table.  Ephram hesistates, but goes. 
     Off Brown, not quite as sanguine as he just pretended to be. 
 
 
     Not your typical bright, sunny Everwood day.  A block of rain 
     clouds fills the town's air space.  Hovering. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN (O.S.) 
               ... So this has happened before? 
 
 
     The humble place of worship shudders in the evening storm. 
     The rain and thunder can't help but remind us of the storm 
     that took Julia's life. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     Everwood - "Till Death Do Us Part"   9/11/02   Full White   42. 
 
 
 
 
 
     The sun shines.  People rush in, ORGAN MUSIC rushes out. 
 
 
     The service now over, the PARISHIONERS stream out of church, 
     shaking hands with the Reverend, etc.  We find Davenport on 
     the church steps, interviewing Irv who is clearly not 
     enjoying this interview as much.  Edna, however, loves it. 
 
                         IRV 
               I'm happy for Doctor Brown.  Really I am. 
 
                         DAVENPORT 
               What do you think your chances are for 
               making a comeback next year?  Or is this 
               is it for Irv Harper? 
 
                         IRV 
               Next year, who knows?  I plan to stay 
               positive, keep doing the work-- 
 
     Davenport sees Andy coming down the stairs and immediately 
     rushes to him, cutting Irv off. 
 
                         DAVENPORT 
               Doctor Brown!  Doctor Brown could I get a 
               quote, please? 
 
     As soon as he's gone. 
 
                         EDNA 
               C'mon, honey.  Let's go home.  I'll make 
               you a bowl of 'hope' chili.  Then maybe 
               we can snuggle up on the couch and watch 
               Hope Floats... 
 
                         IRV 
               You're loving this, aren't you? 
 
                         EDNA 
               A little bit.

     CAMERA pans over to Doctor Brown, as Davenport takes his 
     picture.  Delia and Ephram wait behind him. 
 
                         DAVENPORT 
               ... thanks, Doc.  Oh, and could you tell 
               me who you are wearing? 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Men's Warehouse. 
 
     Davenport jots that down and goes.  Delia takes Andy's hand. 
 
                         DELIA 
               I'm hungry. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Twelve hours of church will do that. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Mama Joy's sound good to anyone? 
 
     The Abbotts (minus Bright) walk down the stairs.   Amy and 
     Ephram still have lingering "mine" awkwardness between them. 
 
                         ROSE 
               Congratulations, Doctor Brown.  I think 
               the Reverend made a fine choice. 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               Thank you, Mayor. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
                   (to Amy) 
               Where's Bright? 
 
                         AMY 
               Oh, he had football practice.  He's not 
               real big on church, anyway. 
 
                         EPHRAM 
               Well, that's one thing we have in common. 
                   (then) 
               So, did you get to see--? 
 
                         AMY 
                   (quickly, to her dad) 
               Are we going to eat?  I'm starved. 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Your mother will be picking the 
               restaurant today.  Right, dear? 
 
 
 
     Everwood - "Till Death Do Us Part"   9/11/02   Full White   56. 
 
 
 
 
     Rose smiles, appreciating the gesture. 
 
                         ROSE 
               How about Mama Joy's? 
 
                         DELIA 
               That's where we're going! 
 
                         DOCTOR BROWN 
               We could share a table. 
 
     Abbott sighs, then: 
 
                         DOCTOR ABBOTT 
               Oh, why not? 
 
     As the two families head down the church steps, 
 
                         NARRATOR (V.O.) 
               The Browns and the Abbotts left church 
               that day with each other to lean on and 
               what more could any parishioner expect of 
               a Sunday?  Not counting of course the 
               brunch at Mama Joy's, which even the most 
               reverential of churchgoers will secretly 
               admit is their favorite part. 
 
     The CAMERA pulls up and away from Everwood's Hope Church and 
     it's last exiting PARISHIONERS.  All of them, and us, leaving 
     the service with something more then they we came in with. 
 
                                                          FADE OUT.
