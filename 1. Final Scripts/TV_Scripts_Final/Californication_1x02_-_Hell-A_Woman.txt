      EXT. MAIN ST. - DAY11

      A familiar dirty black Porsche cruises down Main St. in 
      Venice... a charmingly bedraggled HANK MOODY at the wheel.  
      He stops at the light where Main meets Rose.

      He stares up the giant ballerina clown atop the building 
      there, contemplative.

      He feels a hand on his thigh.  He looks -- Karen is next to 
      him.  Smiling.  The ray of sunshine to his dark cloud.

                                  KAREN
                    What are you thinking about?

                                  HANK
                    How much I absolutely fucking 
                    loathe this city.

                                  KAREN
                    Just as I was thinking about how 
                    much I absolutely love it.

                                  HANK
                      Meanwhile, I haven t written a 
                    goddamn word since we got here.

                                  KAREN
                    Relax.  Blame it on the weather.

                                  HANK
                    That s how it starts:  with the 
                    weather.  Then, before you know it, 
                    you re smoking the Hollywood crack 
                    pipe and sucking dick to support 
                    your habit.

                                  KAREN
                    Well, at least you re not being 
                    dramatic about it.

                                  HANK
                    What can I say?  I miss New York.

                                  KAREN
                    And I miss you.  Because you re 
                    still there.  In that big, thick 
                    head of yours.  Come back to us, 
                    Hank.  Your girls miss you...




                                                                              (CONTINUED)          CALIFORNICATION EP102  FINAL DRAFT - GOLD 6/14/07      2.

      She smiles.  Which makes it impossible for Hank not to kiss 
      her.  A car horn HONKS, napalming the moment.  Hank is yanked 
      from his reverie.  He s alone in the car.  

      He looks -- sees a gorgeous California blonde in the 
      convertible next to him.  Smiling.  The postcard-worthy 
      promise of a better day.  She s been watching, bemused.

                                  THE BLONDE
                    Who are you talking to?

                                  HANK
                    Sorry.  Professional hazard.

                                  THE BLONDE
                    What do you do?

                                  HANK
                    Me?  I m a writer.  Non-practicing.*

                                  THE BLONDE
                    Who isn t?  Here, maybe you could *
                    read something of mine.

      She flies a paper airplane into his car.  Zips off.  Hank 
      unfolds the paper:   CALL ME.   Followed by a phone number.

      Hank smiles, shakes his head.

      As he drives off, we cut to MAIN TITLES.

      EXT./INT. KAREN & BILL S PLACE - DAY22

      Hank pulls up in front of the cover of Dwell magazine.

      Today is a day he would very much prefer to honk the horn, 
      but he decides to suck it up and ring the doorbell.

      And so he does, bracing himself for the very real possibility 
      that a certain comely 16-year-old might answer.

      The door opens, revealing not Mia but her sire, BILL, an 
      annoyingly handsome and seemingly decent fellow who also just 
      happens to be Hank s nemesis.

                                  BILL
                    Hank.

                                  HANK
                    Bob.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)        CALIFORNICATION EP102  FINAL DRAFT - GOLD 6/14/07      2A.

                                  BILL
                    Bill.

                                  HANK
                    Really?

                                  BILL
                    Becca doesn t want to see you.

                                  HANK
                    Are you looking for a cock punch?  
                    Let me talk to her.

                                  BILL
                    Hank, trust me, as the father of a 
                    teenage daughter, just give her 
                    some space.  She ll come around.

        CONTINUED:22


      Hank shakes his head, starts to walk away, turns back.  Walks 
      past Bill, into the house...

                                  HANK
                    You know... Bill, is it?

                                  BILL
                    Yep -- still Bill.

                                  HANK
                      I appreciate the parenting advice, 
                    but maybe -- just maybe -- it s not 
                    such a great idea to give your kid 
                    too much space.  Maybe too much 
                    space is what gets them in trouble.

                                  BILL
                    Hank.  Please.  My daughter is 
                    sixteen.  She s an angel.  Clearly 
                    I m doing something right.

                                  HANK
                    You poor bastard.

                                  BILL
                    Excuse me?

                                  HANK
                    Homo says what?

                                  BILL
                    What?

                                  HANK
                    Gotcha.

      Bill is stunned by the inanity of it all.  Hank notices a 
      recently unpacked painting leaning somewhere nearby.  It s 
      hideous -- absurdly expensive and completely pretentious.

                                  HANK
                    What the fuck is that?

                                  BILL
                    What do you think?  I could ve 
                    bought a new car instead.

                                  HANK
                    I think you should still buy the 
                    car.  And run over whoever painted 
                    this.  It s fucking hideous.  
                    H.I.D. Positive.

      Karen appears.  

                                  KAREN
                      Everything okay out here, boys?

                                  BILL
                    It s all good.

                                  HANK
                     It s all good ?  Really?  Not 
                    exactly the King s English there, 
                    fella.

      Hank moves in to give Karen a kiss hello.  As is his wont.  
      But Karen dodges the kiss.  As is her wont.  Bill, in turn, 
      kisses Karen, eyeballing Hank the whole time.

      Becca appears.  Deadpans Hank.

                                  BECCA
                    I still hate you.

                                  HANK
                      Naturally.

                                  BECCA
                    But I do want to see your movie.

                                  HANK
                    My book.  Not my movie.

                                  BECCA
                    Not my problem.  I like your movie.

                                  HANK
                    How is that even possible?

                                  BECCA
                    Because it proves you re not the 
                    asshole they say you are.

      Hank holds out his palm.  Becca produces a dollar bill.  
      Which Hank quickly pockets.

                                  HANK
                    Now who says I m an asshole? 

      An awkward moment as looks are exchanged.  Becca deadpans.  
      Hank is forced to give her the dollar back.  Hank starts to 
      lead Becca away, but Karen interjects:

                                  KAREN
                          (to Hank)
                    Hey, can we swap nights this

                          (sighs)
                    Thank you, sweetie.

                                  BECCA
                    Dad should come.  They re his 
                    friends too, you know.  And Uncle 
                    Charlie s his agent.  Maybe he has 
                    an offer for him.

      Karen and Bill exchange looks.  Much to Hank s amusement.  
      Bill, nothing if not a decent guy, summons the decency:

                                  BILL
                    You re welcome to come, Hank.

                                  KAREN
                      Absolutely.  Bring a date.

                    Earbuds.

      Becca dutifully inserts the earbuds, cranks her iPod.

                          (to Karen)
                    First of all, you could never

                    someone right in front of you.

                    I ll do my best.

                                  HANK
                    I guess this means the answer is 
                    no.  You re not going to marry me.  
                    I have to say -- I m disappointed.

                    might be nice for Becca to see us 
                    all getting along for a change?

      INT. CHARLIE S OFFICE - DAY44

      Outside Charlie s office, his assistant, DANI, answers calls.  
      She s quiet, fragile and oddly beautiful.  Maggie Gyllenhaal 
      in  Secretary  meets a pierced, tattooed Suicide Girl.

                                  DANI
                    Charlie Runkle s office.  He s in a 
                    meeting.  We ll try you back....

      WE MOVE INSIDE...

      ...and find Hank reclined on the sofa as Charlie finishes up 
      a call and answers an e-mail.

                                  HANK
                    Your assistant makes me want to 
                    touch myself in a bad place.

                                    CHARLIE
                    That s nice -- because my assistant 
                    makes we want to hang myself.

                                  HANK
                    While masturbating?

                    Really?

                                  HANK
                    I have no idea.  I just wanted to 
                    say pooper.  But I have found the 
                    back-tat to be a watermark of the 
                      promiscuous.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Good for you.  Doesn t change the 
                    fact that she s the world s worst 
                      assistant.  Drops calls, loses 
                      manuscripts -- she can t even get 
                    my fucking macchiato right.

                                  HANK
                    But she does seem to have a nipple 
                    ring.  Quite possibly two.  
                    Seriously -- something very cool is 
                    going on in that area.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Enough already.  Move on.  How s

                                  HANK
                    Now there s a hostile question.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Hank.  You ve owed a book to your 
                    publisher since Becca was breast-
                    feeding.  I remember because I 
                    liked to watch Karen do that.

                                  HANK
                    You re supposed to be my agent -- I 
                    need your encouragement, support, 
                      nurturing.  Not some creepy comment 
                    about your lactating-lady fetish.

                    You need a fucking job.

                    the fucking meeting already.

      Dani walks in with a grande something from Starbucks and a 
      pile of manuscripts.  Charlie drinks, curses.

                                  HANK
                    Let s ask Dani California.

                    Anywhere else?

      She smiles, walks out.  Hank gives Charlie a knowing look.

                                  HANK
                    Nose ring too.  You know what

                    What does that even mean?  Are you

                    Well, let me help you find it.

      She proceeds to go down on him.  Sucking and slurping like a 
      vacuum cleaner on steroids.  Gagging and spitting with glee.

      As Hank s eyes adjust to the apartment, he notices a 
      collection of porn DVD s.  He picks one up.  It s a parody of 
      his own movie:   Crazy Little Thing Called Anal.   

      Then he realizes that the girl blowing him is the same as the 
      one on the box.  Pretty much the same angle and everything.

      All of a sudden, there s the sound of a KID CRYING from a 
      BABY MONITOR.  Followed by a  Mommy!  or two.  Hank freezes.

                    That would be my daughter.

      But the kid continues to cry.  Overcome with great sadness, 
      Hank gently guides The Blonde s head up and away from his 
      southern hemisphere.  Gives her a kiss on the cheek.

                                  HANK
                    Go be with your kid.

      He collects his stuff and leaves.

      INT. HANK S PLACE - NIGHT77

      Hank lies awake in bed.  Grabs his pants off the floor and 
      fishes for the card Nora gave him.  He picks up his shitty PC 
      laptop, launches the browser, types in the address for the 
      Hell-A website.

      The site is instantly appealing -- a cross between Rolling 
      Stone, Salon.com, and Suicide Girls.com.  The content covers 
      art, music, film, politics -- with a narrow focus on L.A. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)        CALIFORNICATION EP102  FINAL DRAFT - GOLD 6/14/07      13.

      being the very edge of Western Civilization and the epicenter 
      of everything right and wrong with the world as we know it.

      Hank is instantly sucked into the raw, cool, unfiltered 
      aesthetic.  We get the sense he sees a kindred spirit in 
      there somewhere.  And then -- his computer dies.

      He hurls it across the room.  Gets out of bed.

      INT. APPLE STORE - NIGHT88

      Hank stands in the middle of the sleek, ultra-tech space, 
      writing on one of the Macs.  We see a portion of the display, 
      the top of which reads:   HANK HATES YOU ALL. 

      As Hank s voice-over kicks in...

                                  HANK (V.O.)
                    A few things I ve learned in my 
                    travels through this crazy little 
                    thing called life:  One:  a morning 
                    of awkwardness is far better than a 
                    night of loneliness.  Two:  I 
                    probably won t go down in history, 
                    but I will go down on your sister.  
                    And three:  while I m down there, 
                    it might be a nice to see a hint of 
                    pubis.  I m not talking about a 
                    huge 70 s Playboy bush or 
                      anything... just something that 
                    reminds me that I m performing 
                      cunnilingus on an adult...

      ...words, phrases and images from Hank s manifesto are 
      projected onto the walls and other computer displays. 

      Things like:   breast implants, bikini wax, vaginal 
      rejuvenation. 

      Pictures of 1950 s pin-up girls transforming over the decades 
      into the alien life forms that L.A. Women have become today.

      The whole store becomes Hank s private office and a 
      heightened, stylized manifestation of what s going on inside 
      his head.

                                  HANK (V.O.)
                    But I guess the larger question 
                    is... why is the City of Angels so 
                    hell-bent on destroying its female 
                      population...?        CALIFORNICATION EP102  FINAL DRAFT - GOLD 6/14/07      14.



      EXT. KAREN & BILL S PLACE - DAY99

      Hank pulls up in front.  Gets out with a bottle of Glenlivet.  
      Walks the walk.  Hearing signs of life from the --

      POOL AREA

      Where he finds a lone swimmer in the pool:

      It s MIA, of course.

      She pulls herself up and out of the pool, dripping wet, 
      string bikini, more naked than not.  All that s missing is a 
      pair of heart-shaped glasses.

                    Are you okay?  You look a little 
                    pale.  You re not going to have a 
                    heart attack, are you?  You are 
                    getting on in years.

                                  HANK
                    Hey, being older than you doesn t 
                      necessarily make me old.

                                  MIA
                    Well, I am sixteen, you know.

                                  HANK
                    So I ve been told.

                                  MIA
                    What s the word for that again?  
                    Let me check the books.  Oh, here 
                    it is.  Right here.  Statutory 
                    rape.

                                  HANK
                    That s two words.

      Bill emerges from the house, breaking the spell.  He clears 
      his throat, clearly uncomfortable.  

                                  BILL
                    Honey, go put some clothes on,

      An uncomfortable beat.  She walks off.  It takes everything 
      Hank s got not to watch as she goes.  Bill appraises Hank.

                                  BILL

                                  BILL
                    You know, I think this is an 
                    important step we re taking here 
                    tonight.

                                  HANK
                    What step is that, Bill?  The one 
                    where I stand by and let you steal 
                    my family out from under me?  I 
                    don t think so.  Game on, broheme.

      Bill sighs, reaches out to take the bottle of booze...

                                  BILL
                    You didn t have to do that.

      ...but Hank pulls away.

                                  HANK
                    I didn t.  This is for me.

      At the same time, Karen walks out with a 40ish friend and 
      neighbor.  SONJA.  Hank goes in for his customary kiss and 
      gets his usual rebuke.

                                  KAREN

                    Cuz I ll double it for the truth.

                    Ah, yes.  The salad days.  There I 
                    was, across from the man of my

                    you look back, he s gone, replaced 
                    by some hack imposter.  Yet you 
                    still sleep with him because he s

      Hank opens the medicine cabinet, finds a bottle of Percocet.  
      Pops one.  Closes the cabinet.  Looks in the mirror.  Doesn t 
      like what he sees.  Gives himself a quick pep talk.

                                  HANK
                    Nobody likes you.  You re ugly and

      An infinitely more relaxed Hank finds everyone gathered at 
      the table.  Bill at one end -- Karen at the other.  Charlie, 
      Marcy and Becca lined up on one side.

      Hank finds himself forced to slide between Sonja and Mia on 
      the other.  Almost immediately, he feels a hand on his leg.  
      He looks -- it s Sonja.  He looks at her.  She s smiling.

      He looks away, catches Karen s gaze.  Somehow she 
      instinctively senses the chemistry between Hank and Sonja.  
      Hank can t help but smile.  And then he feels something.  
      Another hand on his leg.  Looks down...

      It s Mia s.  He looks at her.  She s smiling too.  He looks 
      away, catches Bill staring at him.  Becca pipes in:

      Everyone drinks up.  Hank drains his entire glass, squirming 
      in his seat as Mia grinds him hard.  Sonja continues to 
      stroke Hank s inner thigh, oblivious to the tugjob action.

                    Mom was going to art school and 
                    playing bass in this downtown noise 
                    band.  Dad had just published his 
                    first novel.  They met cute at...
                          (to Hank)
                    What was it called again?

                    CBGB s.

                                  BECCA
                    Right.  He thought she was 
                      pretentious, and she thought he was 
                    way too pleased with himself.  But 
                    they had sex anyway.  In the 
                    morning, he made her breakfast and 
                    she talked about her plan to move 
                    to Seattle so she could stalk and 
                    marry...

                                  BECCA
                    Right.  But then she read Dad s 
                    writing.  And that was it.  Nine 
                    months later, I was born.  They 
                    never got married, of course.  But 
                    they stayed together a long time.  
                    A lot longer than most people do.

      No one knows what to say.  Hank smiles sweetly at Becca.  
      Looks at Karen, who is dodging both his look and Bill s.  
      Marcy feels like it s her civic duty to change the tone.

                    One day, this obnoxious agent 
                    walked into my salon for a facial.    
                    And boy did he need it.

                    unibrow.  Sitting there like a big, 
                    giant moustache over his eyes.

      Mia gives Hank s cock a final squeeze and gets up from the 
      table.  She kisses Bill goodbye.  And so she goes.

                    while very much an exercise in

      scotch right where he left it -- by the door.  Takes a swig.  
      Just as Sonja is coming out of a nearby bathroom.

                    a man who actually likes women.  Is 
                    that okay with you?

                                  HANK
                    Well, I d be lying if I said I 
                    never wondered what it would be 
                    like to bang a Scientologist.

      A beat.  And then she jumps his bones.

                    You haven t been in for a wax in 
                    months.  Either you ve taken your

                    sporting a ginormous hippie bush

                    I m sorry... but I just came to

                    Well, I am.  Thanks for asking.

                                  MARCY
                    Good.  And you re sure you re not

                    but I m not speaking in tongues.  
                    Are you absolutely sure you want to

      INT. KAREN & BILL S PLACE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT1616

      Where Hank teases an uber-enthused Sonja from behind.

                                  SONJA
                    Come on... just put it in...

                                  HANK
                    I don t think Tom and Katie would 
                    approve of your behavior right now.

                                  SONJA
                    Oh shut the fuck up already...

                                  HANK
                    Are you clear yet?

                                  SONJA
                    Shut up and fuck me!

                                  HANK
                    You are one kinky thetan.

      As Hank accommodates her, Sonja s ardor grows...  and 
      grows... until finally... after a particularly forceful 
      series of thrusts from Hank... she BUCKS against him... and 
      BRONCOS him...

      In the process, Hank is thrown backward, against the wall.  
      Taking down the absurdly modern painting that hangs there.







                                                                              (CONTINUED)        CALIFORNICATION EP102  FINAL DRAFT - GOLD 6/14/07      28.

      Off the bed he falls, SMASHING his head against the edge of 
      the night stand on the way down.  Landing on the floor like a 
      sack of grain.

                                  SONJA
                    Oh my God -- are you okay?!

      A beat later, Hank staggers to his feet.  He touches his 
      head, comes away with bloody fingers.  He sees the painting.  
      Tries to put it back up on the wall.

      Getting blood all over it in the process.

      Suddenly, he s not feeling so good.  The combination of pot, 
      Percocet and single malt Scotch whisky is taking its toll.

      A moment later, he VOMITS all over the painting.

      And that s precisely when Karen, Bill, Charlie and Marcy all 
      pile into the room, drawn by the commotion.

      A horribly embarrassing moment as Hank stands there -- naked, 
      bloody and dazed.  Suddenly feeling vulnerable, Hank picks up 
      the painting and holds it in front of his genitalia.

                                  HANK
                    It s all good...

      As Hank exits and walks to his car, another car pulls up, 
      depositing Mia.  She slams the door and the car roars off.  
      Mia sees Hank.  Takes in his disheveled state, very amused.

                                  MIA

      Hank reclines in the Porsche, looking up the sky, the top 
      down, parked somewhere near LAX.

      He feels a hand on his thigh.  Looks:  Karen is next to him.  

      She mouths something... something that sounds like...
