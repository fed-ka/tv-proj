      Open on a montage of deserted streets, streaked with early
      morning sun, in an upscale Capital Hill neighborhood of well-
      maintained Federal and late Victorian row houses.  We see a
      newspaper deliveryman pitching plastic-wrapped copies of the
      Washington Post onto stoops.  Over the montage, we hear NPR's
      Morning Edition (taped from an actual show as close to air
      date as possible)pop on mid-sentence. The hosts are discussing
      the upcoming presidential election.


      ROBERT and AARON emerging from the hotel.  The senator is
      worried.

                                      ROBERT
                    How's this going down, Aaron?

                                      AARON
                    Legally, you should be fine for now. 
                    No way they empanel a jury until
                    after the election.  But the ethics
                    committee will have to convene.

                                      ROBERT
                    But those are closed sessions, right?

                                      AARON
                    Yeah, but you can expect the
                      Democratic staffers to leak like
                    crazy.

                                      ROBERT
                    There's nothing to leak.  There was
                    no kickback.

                                      AARON
                    Well, then, maybe someone will leak
                    the lack of evidence.  You know Gil
                    John's on that committee, right?

                                      ROBERT
                    Christ, that's right...
                          (after a moment)
                    Okay, we need to change the subject
                    when this breaks.  Get me on that
                    CONDEL.                                                                                        31.

                                      AARON
                    You want to leave the country?

                                      ROBERT
                    You got a better idea?

      While they stand on the corner, a limousine glides up to the
      curb.  The window lowers, and ANDY, black tie, grins out at
      them.

                                    ANDY
                    Ready when you are, boss.

                                                                                  CUT TO:


      A cab, pulling up in front of the house.  LOUIS emerges and
      trudges slowly up the stairs to the brownstone and fumbles
      with his keys.

                                                                                  CUT TO:
