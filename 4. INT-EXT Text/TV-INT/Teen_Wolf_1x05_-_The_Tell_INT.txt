        A FLORESCENT LIGHT flickers with an irritating BUZZ. Two 
      hands reach up to twist the BULB out of its socket in the 
      ceiling of a quiet video store.

      Standing on a ladder, THE CLERK gently places the old bulb on 
      the shelf while reaching for a new one. He screws it in, but 
      it continues its irritating blinking.


      Lydia s car pulls up. Jackson gets out in mid-conversation *
      with Lydia, arguing with her through the open window.

                                    JACKSON
                    Hoosiers is not only the best 
                      basketball movie ever made, it s 
                    the best sports movie--

                                  LYDIA
                    No.

                    It s got Gene Hackman and Dennis 
                    Hopper--

                                  LYDIA
                    No.

                                    JACKSON
                    I swear to God you ll like it.

                                  LYDIA
                    No.

                                    JACKSON
                    I m not watching The Notebook 
                    again.

      She hits the window button closing it on him with a smile 
      behind the glass.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/102.



      A fuming Jackson enters the store, searching for The 
      Notebook. But going row to row and passing by the now empty 
      ladder and replacement bulbs, he can t seem to find it.   

                                    JACKSON
                    Can somebody help me find The 
                    Notebook?

      He glances around. No response. No one at the cash register.

                                    JACKSON (CONT D)
                    Hello? Anybody working here? 
                    Anybody at all?

      It seems there s not a single other person in the store. 
      Turning back to the shelves, he begins thumbing the DVD s 
      when he spots something...

      THROUGH THE WIRE FRAME of the shelf, Jackson sees TWO SHOES 
      on the floor, toes pointed upward.

      He lets the DVD s fall back. Hand now trembling, he slowly 
      steps left. Inching around the corner of the shelf, he sees 
      the two shoes and now just a bit of the legs.

      Someone is lying on the floor on the other side of the shelf.

      Chest rising with ever shortening breathes, Jackson takes 
      another step. And then another, finally discovering--

      The Clerk lies dead on the floor. Blood everywhere.

      Jackson staggers back and tumbles right into the LADDER. It 
      goes down, wires snapping with it as--

      A SPARK flies from the light fixture. With an ELECTRIC 
      CRACKLING, all of the lights flicker and die, plunging the 
      store into--

      DARKNESS.

      THE SOUND OF MOVEMENT spins Jackson around. A shelf RATTLES, 
      DVD cases trembling as something LARGE moves behind it. 
      Whatever it is, it s between him and the exit.


      In the driver s seat, Lydia gazes into her camera phone, *
      pursing her lips. Then flips it around to watch the video of 
      herself.              TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/103.



      Jackson crouches behind a shelf, trying to steady his near-
        hyperventilating breaths. Slowly, he peers up above the 
      stacks of DVD s when--

      ONE OF THE SHELVES ROCKS FORWARD. Like dominoes, they begin 
      falling toward him, DVD s flying through the air.

      Jackson moves to dart out of the way, but one of the shelves 
      slams down on his back, pinning his body to the floor. As he 
      tries to push himself up--A shadow falls over him. 

      Jackson holds still as the store becomes ominously quiet and--
      SOMETHING GROWLS mere inches from the back of his head. A 
      clawed hand reaches over the nape of his neck where--

      The MARKS from when Derek punctured his skin are still 
      visible. Yellowish and scabbed, they look infected. Jackson 
      shudders as the tips of the Alpha s claws graze his skin, 
      pulling back and lifting up as if preparing to strike.


      Lydia raises her camera phone, still recording video of 
      herself when--

      THE STORE S PLATE GLASS WINDOW EXPLODES.

      Fragments shower the lot as a BLACK SHAPE hurtles past 
      Jackson s car.

      Lydia spins around with the camera phone still clutched in 
      her hand, her wide eyes staring off through the window.


      Lydia steps past DVD cases strewn across the floor.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    Jackson?

      Then she sees a HAND jutting out from underneath an 
      overturned shelf. Terrified, she approaches. Slowly reaching 
      out, her own fingers trembling--              TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/104.

      Lydia SHRIEKS, spinning around to see Jackson just standing 
      there, staring out the broken window.

      With an ELECTRIC CRACKLE, the LIGHTS flicker back on. Lydia 
      looks down to a BLOOD-SOAKED carpet. 

      Now she starts screaming.

      Stiles looks up while stuffing a handful of his father s

      He hurries out to confer with his Deputies. Stiles sits 
      impatiently while taking in the store s shattered window, the

                    Let s try not to think about that.


      Taking his seat, Stiles looks for Scott, but there s no sign 
      of him. Mr. Harris, lights the ACETYLENE TORCH at his desk.

                                  MR. HARRIS
                    Just a friendly reminder: 
                      Parent/Teacher conferences are 
                    tonight. Students below a C average 
                    are required to attend. I won t 
                    name you since the shame and self-
                    disgust should be more than enough 
                      punishment. And has anyone seen 
                    Scott McCall?

      No one responds. The door opens and in comes Jackson, 
      something slightly off about him. Everyone watches. Harris 
      crosses to him.

                                  MR. HARRIS (CONT'D)
                    Jackson, if you need to leave early 
                    for any reason... You let me know.

      The boy just glares at him, annoyed by the pity.            TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/1013.

                    Nine. And Mr. Stilinski try putting 
                    the highlighter down between 
                      paragraphs. It s Chemistry. Not a 
                    coloring book.

      Capping his highlighter, Stiles leans toward Danny who is 
      sitting in front of him.

                                  STILES
                    Danny? Can I ask you a question?

      Finally, she FIRES up the engine, swerving out of the lot. 
      With a breath, Scott leans back in his seat and relaxes.


      Steam pours into the locker room from the showers post gym 
      class while the boys get ready for next period. 

      Jackson heads from the showers to his locker. Only when he 
      begins to pull his things out does he notice that the room is 
      now empty.

      Dripping faucets and clanging pipes accompany a thick steam 
      billowing from the shower room.

      Shutting his locker, Jackson pauses. Slowly, he gazes back to 
      find TWO GLOWING RED EYES coming toward him through the 
      steam.             TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/1015.

      He steps back, hand moving to his neck where the PUNCTURE 
      MARKS from Derek are still visible.  

      THE GLOWING EYES come closer and closer to Jackson and just 
      as he s about to bolt--

      A STUDENT steps through the steam, revealing the two red eyes 
      are illuminated headphones stuck in his ears. As the Student 
      exits, Jackson lets out a relieved breath and turns back to 
      his locker when--

      DEREK ENTERS.

      Jackson stumbles back, almost falling over the bench.

                                    JACKSON
                    Okay, all right, I don t know where 
                    Scott is. I haven t seen him--

      He flinches at the sound of his own name, retreating until 
      his back hits the wall.

                    Me? Why me? I didn t do anything.

      SOUND fades until all Derek can hear is the rhythmic rise and 
      fall of JACKSON S HEARTBEAT.

      He puts his hand on top of Jackson s head. The boy squeezes 
      his eyes shut as if waiting for his neck to be snapped. But 
      Derek simply turns Jackson s head around to get a look at the 
      INFECTED CLAW MARKS on his neck.

                    You should really get that checked

      Jackson lets out a gasp. His eyes flutter open. And once 
      again... 

      He s alone in the locker room.

      FADE IN:


      A bare and very muscular torso moves up and down. It s Derek 
      doing chin-ups from an exposed beam on the ceiling. He drops 
      down and starts pumping out push-ups and then--

      STOPS. Halfway between a push-up, with his muscles tensed, 
      his down-turned head slowly peers up.

      THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN.

      Kate calmly walks in, followed by Leveque and Ulrich. The 
      space where Derek was just working out is now empty.

      Derek hurtles out of the darkness with a GROWL OF RAGE.

      Ulrich draws a gun, but in the blink of an eye, it s out of 
      his hand and he s tumbling to the floor.

      Kate watches with a slight smile at her lips, enjoying it.

      Derek looks up with teeth fully FANGED and leaps toward 
      Leveque. A moment later, the man s unconscious body drops to 
      the floor, rolling to Kate s feet.

      Now Derek goes for her. She stands still as if waiting to be 
      pummeled. And then with a flick of her wrist she has 
      something in her hands--

      A TELESCOPING STUN BATON which crackles with an electric 
      spark. She spins it up and touches it to Derek s skin as he 
      hurtles toward her.

      Derek CRASHES to the floor, muscles flinching and trembling 
      out of control. Kate slowly walks over.

      As she waves the baton over his eyes, Derek stares at her 
      with absolute hatred. Seething at her playful smile.


      Stiles paces in his room while his cell phone is pressed to

      Stiles holds up Lydia s phone, struggling with a decision.

      ON THE DISPLAY - Are you sure you want to delete?

      His thumb hovers over the selection. But then he sets the 
      phone down. Then almost immediately picks it up again. And

      Stilinski puts a photo down. It shows a BLURRY DARK SHAPE on 
      all fours bounding toward Jackson s car.

                                  STILINSKI (CONT D)
                    Here s another.

      He puts down a second photo of the shape charging up.

                                  DEATON
                      Interesting.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Actually, this one is the 
                      interesting one.

      He sets down a new photo. Deaton purses his lips, looking at 
      it. Staring at it.

                                  DEATON
                    I see what you mean.

      He slowly lifts the picture up to bring it closer to his 
      eyes. The photo shows the dark shape. Except it s now running 
      on two legs instead of four.

                                  STILINSKI
                    I ve never seen a mountain lion do 
                    that.

                                  DEATON
                    Can t say I have either. You ve got 
                    a problem here.

                                  STILINSKI
                    What am I looking at? My first 
                    instinct was a bear. But bears 
                    don t run on two legs.

                                  DEATON
                    No, they drop to all fours.            TEEN WOLF "Episode 105" SALMON DRAFT12/16/1032.

      A DOG IN THE BACK begins to BAY. Deaton looks back. A very 
      different quality about him now. Nervous. He won t look 
      Stilinski in the eye.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    Like I said. You need a real expert 
                    here.

                                  STILINSKI
                    Could it still be a mountain lion? 

      The dogs continue to howl. Deaton turns back.

                                  DEATON
                    I m sorry but I ve got a sick 
                    Doberman that needs my attention.

      Stilinski nods, picking up the photos.  

                                  STILINSKI
                    No other ideas? 

                                  DEATON
                    I m sorry.

      The dogs in the kennel HOWL, volume and intensity rising.

                                  DEATON (CONT D)
                    Really, I wish I could help you.

                    Dog. I hear them. And thanks. For 
                    humoring me again.

      Stilinski closes the folder.


      Scott and Allison get into her car. She cranks up the heat. 
      They rub their hands in front of the heater.

      Scott touches her eyebrow gently with his thumb. She takes 
      his hand in hers, keeping it at her cheek.

                    needs a little more attention. A 
                    guiding hand through this crucial 
                    stage in his development.

      The lights of passing cars flash over Scott s face. One after 
      another. In one quick moment, however, his eyes flash back, 
      becoming REFLECTIVE as he turns his head up.

                    Allison Argent...


      Mr. and Mrs. Argent sit with a concerned Ms. Ramsey.

                                  MS. RAMSEY
                    An incredibly sweet girl. Very 
                    quick to adjust despite the moving 
                    around.

                                  ARGENT
                    We know it s hard on her. But it s 
                      a necessary evil. I have to go 
                    where the work takes me.

                                  MS. RAMSEY
                    Necessary or not, I d be prepared 
                    for some... How do I put this...

                                  MRS. ARGENT
                    We appreciate your concern but we 
                    have a great relationship with our 
                    daughter. Very open and honest.

                                  MS. RAMSEY
                    I m happy to hear that. And please 
                    let her know I hope she s feeling 
                    better.

      She gives a smile as the Argents share a surprised look.

                                  ARGENT
                    She wasn t in class?

                                  MS. RAMSEY
                    She wasn t in school. I checked 
                    with the office.

      Conference over. Argent gets up, his wife following.


      Allison pulls into the school parking lot. They see the crowd 
      of PARENTS heading out.

                                    ALLISON
                    I doubt it ll be as bad as you 
                    think.

      One of the DOORS SLAMS open, turning several heads. It s 
      Melissa McCall, fuming.

                                    ALLISON (CONT D)
                    Your Mom?

      As he slinks down in the seat--

                                  SCOTT
                    I m dead.

                                                                          FADE OUT.
