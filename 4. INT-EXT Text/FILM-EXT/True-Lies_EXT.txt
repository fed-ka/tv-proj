The snow covered Alps stand out clearly in the light of a full
moon.
A fortress-like CHATEAU is situated in a flat saddle of
forest partway up the mountain, next to a frozen lake.
The
property is surrounded by high stone walls, and the stately
grounds are bathed in floodlights and patrolled by armed guards
with dogs.
2
The driveway and motorcourt are filled with cars.
A formal-
dress party is in progress... a private reception for a middle-
eastern dignitary.
Tuxedoes men escort their diamond-encrusted
ladies through the huge front doors, where they doff their
overcoats and are politely scanned with hand-held metal
detectors by white gloved security staffers.
The walled perimeter of the house runs along the lake, forming
a kind of rampart.
There is an opening, to a kind of waterway
or canal, which connects to the private docks inside the
grounds.
There is a steel grating across the opening.
The
bars disappear down into the thin ice of early winter.
With the house visible BG, we CRANE DOWN below the parapet wall
along which a guard is a white exposure-suit is walking... down
along the dark wall to the grating... TILTING DOWN to see a
glow pulsing under the ice.

Camera moving toward:
A FIGURE in diving gear working at the
metal bars with an oxygen arc cutting torch.
One bar has
already been cut out.
Two quick cuts and a second bar falls to
the muddy bottom.
Lit now only from the floodlights filtering
down through the ice, the figure slips through the bars and
swims powerfully along the stone canal wall.
Seem from below, the figure is a black shadow moving against
the rippled-glass of the ice above.
4
A dock extends into the frozen canal, just behind a large
boathouse.
There is a faint chipping sound.
The ice breaks
quietly, and the pieces are slid back.
A head appears, in a
rubber drysuit hood.
The DIVER slips the regulator out of his
mouth and turns slowly, scanning...
revealing:
HARRY TASKER.
Our hero.
Harry floats with just his eyes above
the surface, silent as a water snake, as a guard passes on a
footpath nearby.
After a few beats Harry slips out of his tanks and fins,
letting them sink, and climbs the frozen ladder onto the dock.
He moves like a ninja into the shadows of the boathouse.
Opening a WATERPROOF BAG, he pulls out a walky talky.
HARRY
Honey, I'm home.
5
Meet Harry's partner, ALBERT "GIB" GIBSON, an overweight twenty-
year-man with a lived in looking face.
Gib answers Harry via
his headset.
GIB
Roger that.
(he covers the mike and
turns)
Hey, Fize!
Get your butt in
here.
Harry's inside.
Outside, FAST FAISIL, an Iranian-American, finishes making
yellow snow and hurries back to the van.
They are parked on a
winding mountain road a half-mile from the chateau, whose
lights are visible through the trees.
Faisil jumps in and goes to the eyepiece of a huge telephoto
nightvision scope.
The eerie green image lurches as he sweeps
the grounds, locating the boathouse.
6
Concealed in the shadows, Harry is shucking out of his drysuit.
Underneath is he is wearing black tux pants, suspenders,
cummerbund and a formal shirt.
He puts a tiny plug, like a
hearing aid, deep in his ear canal.
A SUB-VOCAL TRANSCEIVER.
Very advanced.
HARRY
Switching to sub-vocal.
Gib, you
copy?
GIB (OVER)
It's Talkradio.
You're on the
air.
Harry slips into his shoulder harness... holster on one side,
containing his .45 auto Glock-22, and the transmitter pack for
the ear-piece slung on the other.
He slips on a formal jacket,
concealing the rig.
Then a final touch.
A little aftershave
from a tiny plastic vial.
Harry adjusts his bow-tie and strides confidently out of the
shadows, crossing quickly to the main house.
He looks
ultrasharp in his black tux with the white silk cummerbund and
his hair slicked back.
He enters the main house through a back
service entrance.

*
Harry goes onto the terrace, and in a display of acrobatic
*
prowess, he pulls himself up onto the third floor balcony
*
directly above.
He lets himself into--
*
12
Seen through the starlight scope, we see one of the guards
shining his light on the hole in the ice and then on Harry's
footprints leading to the boathouse.
He calls to one of the
other guards, who comes running over.
20
Harry nods to the security men at the door as he strides
confidently through.
He goes down the steps to the broad
terrace above the motor court.
Behind Harry, a GUARD lowers
his walky talky and starts after him.
GUARD
May I see your invitation, sir?
Without turning, Harry slips a small flat box out of his breast
pocket.
A REMOTE DETONATOR.
HARRY
*
Here's my invitation.
*
He pushes the button and--
*
KABOOM!
The
second floor office windows blow out in a fiery
explosion.
Using the diversion, Harry leaps off the terrace
before the guard can open fire.
25
Gib sees the rising fireball a half-mile away.
He starts the
van.
GIB
Aw, shit.
Here we go--
26
Harry sprints across the snow-covered lawn, through the trees.
Guards with automatic weapons run after him, firing.
The snow
explodes around him with bullet hits.
TWO DOBERMANS pelt toward Harry, leaping at him in perfect
unison.
He waits... and knocks their heads together in mid-
leap with a crack like a baseball bat.
The dogs drop to the
snow, wobbling around like they're drunk.
As Harry sprints on, ANOTHER DOBERMAN lunges out of the bushes
ahead, leaping directly for his throat.
Harry grabs the dog
and shot-puts him up into a tree without breaking stride.
Dog
Fu.
The dog yelps and scrambles to hold onto an icy branch,
looking down in amazement.
27
Harry leaps down on the outside of the wall, hitting a snow
bank and sliding downhill.
He sprints down the gentle slope
toward the highway.
Harry looks back as TWO GUARDS ON SKIS come out of a guard
station beside the main entrance.
TRACKING WITH THE SKI-GUARDS, searching through the trees with
lights.
They have lost Harry.
They stop.
A snowbank behind
them EXPLODES as Harry leaps out.
He disables them both with
vicious street-fighter moves.
Harry looks upslope as--
A service gate opens in the perimeter wall and TEAMS OF
SECURITY MEN in white snow-suits pour out, some on skis, some
on SNOWMOBILES.
A HELICOPTER rises over the wall in a blast of
swirling snow.
Its xenon lights rake through the trees,
casting lurid wheeling shadows on the snow.
ON Harry, snapping closed the ski boots he has stolen from one
of the disabled guards.
He pops the boots quickly into the
bindings and takes off downhill with one of the guard's FN FAL
rifles slung across his back.
The helicopter swoops downhill, its searchlight blazing through
the forest.
Snowmobile headlights illuminate the ski-patrols
zig-zagging among the trees.
Harry slashes expertly downhill.
He cuts a distinguished
figure in his black tux.
Automatic weapons fire rips through
the trees from behind him.
Harry is going flat-out.
The xenon
light hits him.
A 7.62 mm machine gun in the chopper rips the
*
slope into white clouds around him.
Harry slashes, turns,
weaving among the trees at breakneck speed.
A snowmobile is
closing in, outflanking him.
He turns toward it, suddenly.
Hits a mogul.
Uses the air to slash his skis right across the
rider's face.
The snowmobile crashes and tumbles into the
night.
28
GIB'S VAN takes an icy turn in a hairy slide.
INSIDE Gib is peering upslope, trying to see what's going on.
All he can see are lights and gunfire.
GIB
Harry, what's your twenty?
I
need a position, buddy--
Suddenly a skier in a black tux launches across the road from
the slope above, RIGHT OVER THE VAN, and lands deftly
downslope.
GIB
Uh... right!
I'll catch you on
the next bend.
Behind the van, pursuing guards leap across the road.
Only
about half can make the jump.
The rest crash horribly.
The
helicopter thunders overhead.
29
Harry sees the chopper start an attack run.
He comes out into
the open, going straight downhill like a rocket.
The chopper
gets suckered in...
trying to hit him, getting right down
behind him... and suddenly-- Harry slides to a stop in an
explosion of powder and whips up the rifle.
P-P-P-POW!
He
rakes a burst across the windshield.
The startled pilot
swerves and-- Suddenly two tall pine trees are right in front
of him.
K-WHACK!
The main-rotor blade snaps clean off and the chopper
drops into the snow, plowing into a snowbank.
It slides right
to the edge of a steep ridge and stops, teetering.
Firing from a snowmobile, one of the guards puts a burst right
across Harry's path.
Harry's skis are hit and he tumbles,
comes out of it...
running down the hill like a juggernaut in
his heavy boots.
He has lost the rifle somewhere in the snow.
Harry takes cover behind the burning wreck of the downed
chopper, which still has its engine running.
The ski patrol
opens fire from upslope.
Rounds whacking against the disabled
helicopter.
Harry looks down the slope and gets an idea.
He jerks the
unconscious pilot out and pushes on the fuselage, rocking it.
It slips over the edge.
He leaps inside as it topples forward
and slides down the slope.
30
Harry adds throttle and works the footpedals, using the tail-
rotor to steer.
The chopper had snow-skids, and Harry is
skiing the damn thing down the mountain.
The copter is burning as it rockets down the slope on its
*
skids.
Bullets are hitting the fuselage, and everything around
it.
Skiers are wiping out, hitting trees.
A snowmobile hits
a rock and flies spectacularly into a ravine.
GIB (OVER)
Harry!
Where are you!
HARRY
In the helicopter.
31
Gib slides the van around a curve.
GIB
(deadpan, to Faisil)
He's in the helicopter.
Big is scanning above for the chopper.
Then upslope he sees
the burning fuselage skiing expertly among the trees.
The chopper hits a jump and launches into the air-- It crashes
through trees, still soaring and-- Gib looks up, screaming as--
The chopper drops right toward him-- He hits the brakes and--
BLAMMO!
It drops onto the road ten feet in front of the
skidding van...
then slides over the edge and tumbles into a
rocky canyon where is BLOWS UP!
The fireball lights up the
night.
Gib and Faisil jump out of the van.
They look downslope at the
burning wreckage.
GIB
Harry?
HARRY?!
HARRY
What?
Gib and Faisil spin to look behind them.
Harry is lodged in
tree-branches hanging over the road.
Gib hands his MP-5K
*
machine gun to Faisil and reaches up to Harry, who grabs his
*
hand and pulls.
Harry tumbles down into the snowbank.
He
stands, brushing snow off his tux, and clomps toward the van in
his ski-boots.
He is completely unruffled.
HARRY
Let's go.
We can still make our
flight.
As Faisil is getting into the van behind Harry, TWO GUARD TEAMS
ON SNOWMOBILES roar around the bend behind them, fish-tailing
on the ice.
Faisil OPENS FIRE.
One snowmobile swerves over
the embankment.
The other pulls up broadside, and the guards
duck behind it.
Gib floors it and the van roars down the
mountain.
Faisil is still Ramboing on full-auto.
FAISIL
This is GREAT!!
I never get to
shoot!
CUT TO:
32
An American Airlines 747 touches down amid puffs of tire smoke.
33
A NON-DESCRIPT SEDAN pulls to the curb in a neighborhood of
modest middle-income tract homes.
The street is deserted.
It
is 4 A.M.
Gib is at the wheel, dropping Harry off at his
house.
34
Dana comes out the front door, letting it slam behind her, and
runs to her boyfriend, TRENT, who is waiting for her in the
driveway on his idling YAMAHA.
Trent is 16, dressed in grunge-
rock style, trying to look tough.
Harry comes out the front
door as Trent revs the motor.
HARRY
Dana!!
She waves from the back of the bike as Trent pops the clutch
and they shoot down the driveway.
DANA
(yelling over the
engine)
Can't stop, I'm late.
Bye, Dad!
43
They are driving through D.C.
Harry is still shocked by his
*
daughter's behavior.
GIB
Kids.
Ten seconds of joy.
Thirty years of misery.
HARRY
She knows not to steal.
I've
taught her better than that.
GIB
Yeah, but you're not her parents,
anymore, you and Helen.
Her
parents are Axl Rose and Madonna.
The five minutes you spend a day
with her can't compete with that
kind of constant bombardment.
You're outgunned, amigo.
Gib and Harry turn onto Pennsylvania Avenue, heading toward
Lafayette Square.
Capital Hill is behind them.
44
A basketball hoop is bolted to the garage and Dana is shooting
baskets in the driveway.
Moths orbit the outside floodlights.
She sinks one, dribbled back to the foul line.
Harry comes up
behind her and lifts the ball out of her hands as she stands
poised to shoot.
She turns.
HARRY
Dana, Mr. Hardy called.
Why
weren't you in class today?
DANA
He lies!
I was there!
I was in
the nurse's office, cause I had
a headache.
HARRY
You seem fine now.
DANA
Great!
You're going to believe
that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over
your own daughter.
HARRY
I'm not sure what to believe
anymore, young lady.
You never
used to lie to me.
But lately
you don't seem to know the
difference between right and
wrong.
Dana studies something really fascinating at the end of a
fingernail.
HARRY
Dana, are you listening to me?
DANA
Yeah, Dad.
HARRY
You know you can always talk to
me.
Right?
Whatever is going on
in your life, your mom and I'll
understand.
DANA
Okay, Dad.
HARRY
You'd tell me if there was
something wrong, wouldn't you,
pumpkin?
DANA
I'm not a pumpkin!
Okay?!!
Do
I look even remotely like a
pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a
cupcake or a honeybear either!
And you don't understand anything
Dad...
Dana runs into the house, agent.
Hold on Harry, superagent,
*
unable to comprehend the mind of a 14-year-old.
He looks up to
*
see Helen at the backdoor.

HELEN

(macho voice)
"I'll handle it".

A BLACK LIMO cruises through a morning fill of bright promise.
INSIDE, Gib is at the wheel in a chauffeur's uniform.
He talks
to Harry, riding in the back, without turning.
GIB
It's all set up...
ghost phones
and fax, all the usual stuff.
You have a suite at the Marquis
Hotel under Renquist.
Okay,
reality check.
Go.
HARRY
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.
I own a--
56
Harry is changing clothes, getting ready to be Harry Tasker
*
again, as Gib drives through evening traffic.
Gib keeps
checking the rearview.
GIB
We have a friend.
Five cars
back, inside lane.
They've been
*
on us since we left Juno's.
*
Harry adjusts the passenger side mirror.
HARRY
Station wagon?
GIB
Uh huh.
Want me to lose them?
HARRY
*
No.
We need this lead.
*
(into his Rover)
*
Unit Seven.
*
UNIT SEVEN (FAISIL)
*
Seven here.
HARRY
(into Rover)
*
I need you at the Georgetown mall
*
in three minutes.
*
SEVEN
Copy that.
We're rolling.
GIB
Helen's going to be pissed.
HARRY
See, that's the problem with
terrorists.
They're really
inconsiderate when it comes to
people's schedules.
72
Harry puts his SUB-VOCAL TRANSCEIVER into his ear canal.
HARRY
Test two three.
(Gib nods, receiving)
Pull over here.
Gib pulls the car to the curb near the mall entrance.
Half a
block behind them the station wagon does the same.
Harry slips
on the virtual-image sunglasses and gets out of the car.
75
Harry pauses on the sidewalk a moment to light a cigarette.
He
coughs slightly.
GIB
(in his ear)
You don't smoke, dickhead.
Harry lets his hand drop to his side, holding the pack of
cigarettes casually.
He turns his hand.
The tiny lens in the
cigarette pack glints.
POV VIDEO SCREEN --inside the left lens of the glasses.
The
camera in the cigarette pack reveals Yusif and Mahmoud getting
out of their cars, crossing the street half a block away.
HARRY strolls into the mall.
It is an open promenade design,
with a moderate crowd of shoppers and movie-goers.
Harry
watches in the glasses as Mahmoud and Yusif slip through the
crowd behind him.
GIB (VO)
What's the plan?
HARRY
(apparently mumbling to
himself)
Gonna try to get a closer shot of
*
Beavis & Butthead.
*
76
Gib looks in the rearview, studying the car behind him.
GIB
There's another guy, still in the
car.
HARRY
(on radio)
Stay on him.
All Gib can see is a silhouette in the car.
A soft cherry
glow, the tip of a cigarette in the dark.
No features.
77
Harry turns off the main concourse, into a narrower walkway
between shops.
In the video-glasses he watches Yusif and
Mahmoud, who have split up to look less conspicuous, as they
track him through the pedestrian traffic.
78
Gib in on the cellular phone.
GIB
Helen?
Hi, it's Gib.
Harry
remembered something he left at
the office.
You know Harry.
As he is talking he sees that a bus has blocked his view of the
station wagon.
79
Yusif sees Harry, up ahead, enter a public restroom.
He
signals Mahmoud with his eyes and the two of them close in on
the restroom.
81
Gib hangs up the car-phone.
Ten the bus blocking his view
finally pulls away and Gib see that the station wagon is
empty.
No silhouette.
GIB
Oh shit.
(into his headset)
Harry, I lost the third guy.
Harry?
82
Gib is running full out, drawing his gun.
He has one finger
jammed in his ear.
His gut is doing the rumba as he runs.
GIB
Harry?
Harry, you copy?!
Shit!
84
MOVING WITH MALIK, who backs rapidly away from the restroom,
reloading.
GIB (OFF)
FREEZE!!!
Malik spins to see Gib nearby, going into a firing stance
behind a light-standard.
The terrorist doesn't hesitate.
His
Beretta ROARS at 900 rounds per minute.
Gib tries to hide behind the light-standard, which is about
half as wide as he is.
Shots hit all around him, shattering
window glass behind him.
His stomach sticks out from behind
the pole.
He sucks it in. Now his butt is sticking out on the
other side.
Shots clang into the steel column, and riddle
everything behind him.
GIB
WRONG!
THIS IS NOT GOOD!
Just when it looks like Gib is going to get a 9mm tummy tuck,
Malik turns and sprints away, through shocked pedestrians.
Harry runs out of the restroom, trying for a shot, but there
are too many people in the line of fire and Malik knows it.
HARRY
Get back to the car!
Gib nods and heads the other way as Harry takes off after
Malik.
Malik is fast and vicious.
He hurls people out of the
way, sending shoppers sprawling.
Harry is ruthless in his
pursuit.
They pound through the mall and out onto the street--
86
Malik sprints straight into traffic.
A car screeches, not
stopping in time... Malik goes right over the hood.
Harry
leaps over the hoods of cars after him.
Malik sees Harry
coming after him like a juggernaut.
He turns and sees a MOTORCYCLIST coming down the street,
accelerating from a right-turn.
Malik runs at him, clothes-
lining him right off the bike.
The terrorist picks up the
nimble little Kawasaki 250, which is still running, and leaps
on.
He pops the clutch and takes off.
Harry pounds after him
like a locomotive.
He sees Malik turn, taking the bike path
into a large PARK.
Harry cuts into the park on a diagonal.
87
ON HARRY, running.
Ahead is a MOUNTED COP.
Harry doesn't
break stride, heading right for the cop on the horse.
The cop
turns, surprised, a split second before-- Harry pulls him off
the horse and slams him to the ground (he's wearing a helmet).
HARRY
Federal Officer in pursuit of
suspect!
Sorry.
Harry is in the saddle and galloping after Malik before the cop
can get his gut out of the holster to stop him.
MALIK roars through the park on the Kawasaki.
He looks back,
amazed to see Harry charging after him on a horse.
They
scatter joggers and bicyclists, people walking their dogs.
TRACKING WITH THEM as they rocket through the park.
Malik
leaves the winding path and goes straight through the trees.
Harry charges through some rollerbladers who go sprawling.
Malik fires his Beretta straight back at Harry, emptying it.
He drops the pistol and crouches over the bike, twisting the
last bit of throttle out of it.
They are going flat out,
through the trees, in a kinetic blur.
88
Gib, panting and heaving, pulls his car into traffic.
The Unit
Seven car pulls out as well, up the block.
GIB
Harry, what's your twenty?
89
Harry is legging the police horse hard.
He has his reigns in
one hand, his Glock in the other.
It's the wild west.
HARRY
Westbound in the park... suspect
is on a motorcycle... he's going
to
come out on Franklin.
Hang
on--
Harry leaps a park bench like he's in a steeple chase.
HARRY (CONT'D)
I want you on 14th in case he
turns south.
And I need Seven on
the north side to box him in.
90
Gib is weaving furiously through traffic.
He slides into a
turn.
GIB
Copy that.
HARRY
And make it fast.
My horse is
getting tired.
ON GIB, mouthing "Your horse?"
91
Malik explodes through the bushes and out onto the street.
Cars skid around him, out of control.
He turns south.
Weaving
through traffic.
Harry leaps the hedgerow behind Malik and
gallops among the spun-out cars.
He goes right over the hood
on one which is blocking his path.
The driver ducks as the
horse's hoof cracks the windshield.
92
Up ahead traffic is stopped, jammed tight at a light.
Malik
goes into the oncoming traffic lanes, which are empty.
Gib's
car slides around the corner in a blare of horns and comes
barrelling down the street toward him.
Gib cranks the wheel
the slides the car broadside, blocking both lanes.
Malik locks
up the brakes and the bike slides to a stop.
Then the
terrorist pops the clutch and wheels the bike around-- Jumping
the curb and going straight at the entrance of THE HYATT
REGENCY HOTEL.
Bellmen and guests scatter as the bike roars right at them.
The sliding doors and opening for a bellman coming out with
bags and Malik blasts past him into the lobby.
HARRY ducks, galloping through the doors after him.
93
Harry has slid off the horse to get next to the control panel.
He can look up at an angle and see Malik in the car above him.
His thumb hovers over the emergency stop button.
If Malik gets
out at any floor, Harry will have a moment to react and stop.
Malik can look down and see this.
He knows Harry's got him.
He just keeps going, floor after floor, using the time to
think.
The older woman is still just staring, trying not to breathe.
The horse flicks her in the face with his tail.
99
*
The rooftop has a spectacular view of the city.
TRACKING WITH
*
Malik as he comes out of the elevator, rides to the far edge of
*
the roof and slides to a stop.
He looks
down twenty stories.
THE SECOND ELEVATOR
arrives.
The doors part and Harry comes
*
out, with his Glock poised and ready.
He sees Malik revving
*
his bike.
The terrorist brodies the bike into a fast one-
eighty and speeds back toward the edge of the roof.
Amazingly,
he increases speed, ROARING RIGHT OFF THE EDGE,
ARCING THE
BIKE SUICIDALLY OUT INTO SPACE!
Harry rides to the edge in time to see Malik, on his bike,
CLEAR A 60 FOOT JUMP and SPLASH INTO THE ROOFTOP POOL of a
*
LOWER BUILDING next to the hotel!
Harry is out of control now, seeing the guy setting away.
He
wheels his mount and charges across the roof to get some
running space.
Then he turns again, back toward the edge Malik
jumped from.
He kicks the horse's flanks and yells HAAHH!!
The horse's hoofs thunder on the roof as they go full tilt
toward the edge.
But a horse is not a motorcycle.
It is slightly smarter.
It
slams its front hoofs down together, stopping suddenly.
Harry
goes right over its head.
He flies forward, almost going right
off the roof.
He slams to the edge, with his legs dangling
over, holding onto a piece of pipe with one hand.
His Glock
tumbles down into darkness.
Harry sees Malik far below, climb out of the pool, running to
the roof door of the other building.
Getting away.
Harry
clambers up onto his own roof, breathing hard.
He walks over
to the horse.
HARRY
What the hell were you thinking?
We had the guy and you let him
get away.
He looks into the horse's innocent brown eyes.
Pats its neck
fondly.
HARRY
What kind of
cop are you?
100
It is the following morning.
Harry and Gib are staked out
watching the front of Dana's school.
Actually, Harry is staked
out, scanning the crowds of kids with binoculars.
Gib just keeps looking at his watch.
He picks up a cellular
phone and pretends to call the office.
GIB
Hey, did that guy Harry chased
last night call in to give
himself up yet?
Cause apparently
that's the only way we're going
to catch the son of a bitch --
HARRY
(not listening)
Okay.
Here she comes.
103
HARRY'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS - We see Dana come out to the
curb and meet Trent, who pulls up on his bike.
She gets on
behind him, adjusts her walkman headphones over her ears and he
launches out into traffic.
104
ON DANA AND TRENT as she looks back and sees Harry following
her.
She is mortified that her father is actually tailing her
DANA
Oh my God!
I think that's my
dad!
TRENT
Hang on!
Trent downshifts and punches it.
The nimble little bike
screams as it zips between cars.
106
BACK ON TRENT, who's actually a really good rider.
He zig-zags
through the cars, cutting between them at the next light where
Gib and Harry get blocked.
He cuts a sharp right turn and
disappears.
108
Harry and Gib pull to the curb in front of the building.
GIB
What's going on?
Harry gets out of the car and turns back, leaning in the door
to talk to Gib.
HARRY
Look, uh... I've got to talk to
Helen about this thing with Dana.
I'm just going to run in and see
if she can get away for lunch.
GIB
You want me to just hang-- ?
HARRY
Just hang a minute.
GIB
I'll just hang then, shall I?
113
Gib sees Harry crossing the street, holding his stomach.
He
seems dazed.
He is not so much walking to the car as wandering
in its general direction.
He stops, in the street.
Gib gets
out of the car and rushes to him.
He pulls him out of the path
of a bus which is HONKING irritably.
GIB
You look like you got gut-kicked.
What's the matter?
You sick?
Harry leans against the car for support.
HARRY
(barely audible)
He-- Helen.
Helen-- it's Helen.
It's Helen, Gib.
GIB
Something to do with Helen, is
what I'm getting.
HARRY
She's having an affair.
Harry's best friend in the world brightens with the news.
He
slaps him on the back.
GIB
Congratulations.
Welcome to the
club.
HARRY
It can't be.
Not Helen.
GIB
Nobody believes it can happen to
them.
HARRY
It can't be.
GIB
Same thing happened to me with
wife two.
I had no idea until I
came home and the house was
empty.
I mean empty.
She even
took the ice-cube trays from the
fridge.
What kind of person
would think of that?
HARRY
(not listening)
I still don't believe it.
GIB
Relax.
Helen still loves you.
She just wants this guy to bang
her.
It's nothing serious.
You'll get used to it after a --
Harry wheels around on Gib, grabbing him by the lapels, and
slams him against the car.
HARRY
STOP.
CHEERING.
ME.
UP.
We see in Harry's rage, frustration, and hurt confusion a
vulnerability we never expected to see.
GIB
What'dya expect Harry?
She's a
flesh and blood woman.
And
you're never there.
It was only
a matter of time.
Harry sags.
His friend is right.
Gib opens the car door and
helps him in like an invalid, talking soothingly the whole time--
GIB
I say we concentrate on work.
That's how I always got through
it whenever my life turned to
dogshit.
Let's catch some
terrorists and then you can beat
the crap out of them.
You'll
feel better.
Gib gets in and starts the car, full of stoic cheer for Harry.
GIB
Women.
Can't live with 'em.
Can't kill 'em.

THE FRONT DOOR OPENS and Harry comes out, walking Gizmo on a

leash.
Harry walks briskly along the sidewalk, jerking the
poor dog along twice as fast as his little legs will go.
*
127
He reaches Gib's car, half a block up, and hands him Helen's
*
purse.
Gib eyes the dog warily.
He growls at it.
Gizmo hides

behind Harry's legs.
GIB
Look, Harry.
I know this is
rough.
I felt the same way the
first time it happened to--
Harry holds up one finger.
His eyes and expression are so
intense, Gib just soft of trails off.

TIGHT ON THE PURSE sitting on the seat next to her as Helen
drives through the city.
131
Harry drives while Gib watches--
132
GIB
Okay, she's turning on
Seventeenth.
Make a left, you
should see her.
Harry makes the turn.
HARRY
There she is.
134
Up ahead they see Helen's RED ACCORD pulling into a parking low
next to a CAFE.
Harry parks the car a block away and gets out
his binoculars.
135
HARRY'S POV through the scope.
Helen gets out of her car and
looks around as she walks to the cafe.
It is not a nervous
look, but it is clear she is making sure she is not followed.
She goes inside.
136
Simon is cruising in the Corvette with the radio blasting.
Thinking he is supercool.
157
Simon pulls into a used car lot, which is a run-down place.
A
hodge-podge of makes and models, a few that might aspire to be
classics.
Simon backs the Vette into an open space on the front line.
He
reaches into the back seat and pulls out a dayglo sign showing
the SALE PRICE of the car.
He sticks it back on the dash.
The
car doesn't even belong to him!
158
Harry and Gib pull up.
They watch as Simon jumps out of the
Vette and goes into the sales office.
GIB
(laughing)
He's a goddamn used car salesman.
This just gets better.
(catching himself)
Sorry Harry, I know this is
painful.
Harry's eyes are slitted down lethally as he stares across the
street.
159
Simon bounces jauntily up to Harry, talking before he's even
reached him.
SIMON
It wants you too.
Feel it
vibrate?
How about a little
spin?
Simon opens the passenger door and sits Harry inside, then runs
around the car.
He leaps over the closed door into the
driver's seat and starts the car.
SIMON
You gotta jump in.
That's rule
number one.
It takes a little
practice, but there's no way
around it.
161
Simon swings the car out onto the boulevard, kicking back.
SIMON
See, it's not just the car, it's
a total image.
An identity you
have to go for.
This isn't some
high-tech sports car...
it
doesn't even handle that great.
But that's not the idea, is it.
Simon gives Harry a big grin.
Harry returns a knowing chuckle.
Ha ha.
SIMON
What're we talking about here?
Pussy, right?
HARRY
Absolutely.
Simon laughs.
Harry laughs.
A big lusty, male-bonding kind of
laugh.
SIMON
Well then this is a vital piece
of equipment.
Used properly, it
can change your life.
See, you
cruise.
No racing.
This ain't
a Ferrari.
You check out the
scenery, let the scenery check
you out.
You got to take it
slow.
Old cars are like good
women... they heat up fast.
How do you grin warmly while your eyes are so cold?
Ask Harry.
HARRY
Keep talking.
CUT TO:
162
Simon is holding court.
Over tacos, he waxes eloquent on his
greatest area of expertise.
We see Harry laughing, going along
with the guy.
Pretending to bond.
SIMON
Let's face it, Harry, the Vette
gets 'em wet.
But it's not
enough.
If you want to really
close escrow, you gotta have an
angle.
HARRY
And you've got one.
SIMON
It's killer.
Look at me-- I'm
not that much to look at.
No
really.
I can be honest.
But I
got 'em lining up, and not just
skanks, either.
Some are.
HARRY
So what's your angle?
SIMON
Sorry.
Trade secret.
HARRY
(grinning)
Sure.
Set me up and then don't
tell me.
Simon leans forward, conspiratorially.
SIMON
Okay, just ask yourself.
What do
women really want?
You take
these bored housewives, married
to the same guy for years.
Stuck
in a rut.
They need some
release.
The promise of
adventure.
A hint of danger.
I
create that for them.
HARRY
So you're basically lying your
ass off the whole time?
I
couldn't do it.
SIMON
Well, think of it as playing a
role.
It's fantasy.
You have to
work on their dreams.
Get them
out of their daily suburban grind
for a few hours.
HARRY
Isn't that hard to keep up, in
the long run?
SIMON
Doesn't matter.
I like change.
You know, constant turnover.
As
soon as I close the deal, it's
one of two more times, then
adios.
HARRY
Use 'em and lose 'em.
SIMON
Exactly.
The trick is, you gotta
pick your target.
They have to
be nice little housewife types.
School-teachers.
But, I'm
telling you, you get their pilot
lit, these babes, they can suck-
start a leaf-blower.
HARRY
What about the husbands?
SIMON
Dickless.
If they took care of
*
business, I'd be out of business,
know what I mean?
HARRY
Those idiots.
163
They are cruising along, with Harry driving this time.
HARRY
You working on someone right now?
SIMON
I always have a couple on the
hook.
You know.
There's one
right now, I've got her panting
like a dog.
It's great.
Unconsciously, Harry's hands clench the wheel tighter.
HARRY
What does she do?
SIMON
Some kinda legal secretary of
something.
Married to some
boring jerk.
Harry takes a corner too fast.
The tires squealing.
SIMON
And she could be so hot, if she
wanted to be.
She's like a dying
plant that just needs a little
water.
When Simon is looking, Harry is open and encouraging...
they
laugh together... then when he looks away Harry goes snake-
eyed.
He could kill Simon with one punch.
He's visualizing
his wife getting porked by this guy.
HARRY
But with you, she gets to be hot,
right?
SIMON
Red hot.
Her thighs steam.
They laugh together.
Harry's laugh is getting a bit brittle.
He speeds up, his knuckles white on the wheel.
Now for the big
question: HAVE THEY OR HAVEN'T THEY?
HARRY
Sooooo... she's pretty good in
bed, then?
SIMON
(yelling suddenly)
Hey, slow down you're gonna miss
the turn!
164
Harry comes barrelling into the lot at forty.
He cranks the
wheel and hits the emergency brake, slewing the car into a
smoking bootlegger-180.
It screeches backward, sliding right
into its parking space perfectly.
Simon is bugeyed.
But he is non-plussed for only about two
seconds.
Then he's back to selling.
He scrambles out and goes
around to Harry, coughing in the cloud of tire smoke.
SIMON
See.
You and this car were meant
for each other.
Why fight it?
Sure, I have a couple other
buyers lined up, but I like your
style.
Whattya say?
Should we
start on the paperwork?
HARRY
Let me think about it.
Hold it
a day for me?
Simon grins and winks.
SIMON
Because it's you.
165
Harry is driving.
Gib pulls a sheaf of pages out of his
briefcase and hands them to him.
GIB
Here's today's transcripts.
There's nothing interesting.
SIMON
Nothing from Simon?
Keeping one eye on the road, Harry riffles through the sheets.
He glances at the top of the last couple of sheets.
He scowls.
Then SUDDENLY SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.
The car dives to the curb,
bumping one wheel.
Harry gets out and charges around to Gib's
side.
Gib gets out, his expression blank.
HARRY
Give me the page.
GIB
What are you talking about?
HARRY
It skips from page nine to
eleven.
Where's page ten?
GIB
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
HARRY
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
Harry hammers his fist against the car-window right next to
Gib.
It explodes inward in a shower of glass.
GIB
(shrugging)
Okay.
Here.
He fishes a crumples sheet of paper out of his pocket.
Harry
grabs it from him, straightening it.
GIB
Jeez, Harry.
Seek help.
As Harry begins to read, we go into FLASHBACK.
169
BACK TO THE PRESENT.
Harry checks his watch.
*
HARRY
Shit!
It's almost eight.
*
He jumps back in the car and activates the GPS locator.
Helen's purse-blip flashes on the grid map.
HARRY
She's still at my house.
*
GIB
The purse is still at the house.
172
Helen pulls
her car under the bridge.
She checks her watch.
Helen notices that her hand is shaking.
She looks around and
*
the place seems deserted.
She is about to leave when she sees
headlights flash briefly in the shadows.
A red-and-white Vette emerges from the darkness and pulls up
next to her.
Simon motions for her to get in quickly.
174
LONGSHOT
on Simon and Helen in the Vette, coming out of the
parking low under the bridge.
We are watching them through a
sophisticated telephoto night-vision device.
175
Simon makes a show of checking the mirrors.
SIMON
Now don't be alarmed... but if
I'm spotter, it would be best if
they don't see you.
You should
keep your head down until we're
out of the city.
He pushes her head down onto his lap.
She crouches there, with
her cheek against his thigh.
He's cruising along, loving it.
176
It is a highway heading away from the city.
IN A LONG LENS
SHOT, the Vette appears over the brow of a hill.
A moment
later A HELICOPTER rises up behind them, A DRAMATIC REVEAL.
It
follows the Vette.
CONDOR (VOICE OVER/RADIO)
This is Condor.
We have the
ball, repeat... we have a good
lock-up on I.R.

The headlights of the Vette light up a ratty single-wide
mobile home, on the outskirts of a TRAILER PARK off the
highway.
Simon and Helen get out of the car.
SIMON
My place in the city is too
hot right now.
So is the
penthouse in New York.
But
this place is secure.
He takes her inside.

The agents have gathered behind a billboard.
Harry, Gib and
*
the other three agents have donned black jumpsuits.
They
finish fitting battle-harnesses, then they grab black ski-
*
masks.
They don them in perfect unison.
Commando precision.
Harry leads off and they quick-time from behind the billboard,
closing in on Simon's trailer.
192
KABOOM!!
The back wall of the trailer is blown outward by tiny
shaped-charges.
The concussion throws Simon forward on top of
her.
Five BLACK-SUITED FIGURES swarm in, carrying machine
pistols and flashlights.
194
WHAT SIMON SEES -- Five demonic figures, backlit by the XENON
LIGHT from a helicopter.
Smoke and dust swirling in the rotor-
wash.
The figures lunge toward them, grabbing them both.
Helen struggles fiercely as Gib (disguised) pulls her up.
Harry yanks Simon to his feet.
197
Gib comes out first with Helen.
She struggles like a wildcat,
frankly surprising the hell out of Harry.
Simon is brought
out, dazed and compliant.
Helen whips around, KNEEING GIB
right in the balls.
Gib OOPHS and doubles over, and Helen runs
for it.
Harry leaves Simon with the other agents and runs after Helen.
She sprints through the trees, Harry pounding after her.
He
grabs her and gets her in a headlock.
She bites the hell out
of his arm.
Harry yells and lets her go, just as-- Keough runs
up and matter-of-factly clips her on the head with his weapon.
Standard operating procedure.
Which is why he can't understand
why Harry punches him, knocking him down.
Harry supports a sagging Helen, gesturing sharply to the other
agents and going RRRRR-RRRR to make his point (since he can't
talk without her recognizing his voice).
They head for the
cars.
CUT TO:

Helen walks back to her office building, carrying the
briefcase.
She keeps looking over her shoulder.
204
Through the trees is a sweeping view across the Potomac to
Georgetown and Embassy Row.
Helen is sitting on a park bench
when Simon shows up, sitting beside her.
She hands him the
briefcase.
SIMON
Thank you.
You saved my life.
What's your name?
HELEN
Helen.
SIMON
You can call me Simon.
(he touches her hand)
You're very brave to do this...
(then notices the locks
have been opened)
You opened it.
HELEN
I just glances inside.
207
CLOSE ON SIMON, looking right into her eyes.
SIMON
(solemn)
Then you know.
208
The unit-seven van pulls up in the spooky shadows under the
bridge, stopping next to Helen's red Accord.
The door slides
open and Helen gets out, helped my black-garbed hands.
She is
wearing her hood, which is whisked off by one of the hands.
She whirls in time to see the door slide shut and the van speed
off.
She watches it drive off into the night.
213
The van pulls up near the edge of a large quarry.
The door
opens and Simon is pushed out, followed by Harry, who is in his
black jumpsuit and wearing a ski-mask.
Gib follows as Harry
guides Simon to the edge of a sheer drop.
Harry whips off the
hood and Simon takes in his surroundings.
SIMON
Yeeaoowww!!
HARRY
You son of a bitch.
Did you
really think you could elude us
forever, Carlos?
SIMON
Wait!
You got the wrong guy.
My
name's Simon.
Look, just let me
go.
There's no need to kill me.
I haven't seen your--
Harry whips off his ski-mask.
SIMON
-- face.
Shit!
Shit!!
Simon has ducked his head and won't look at Harry.
Then it
dawns...
He looks up, brightening hopefully.
SIMON
It's you!
Hey, you still
interested in that Vette at all?
GIB
You can drop it now, Carlos.
The
game is over.
Your career as an
inter-national terrorist is too
well documented.
SIMON
No... I sell cars.
That's all!
Not even foreign cars.
Nothing
international, I swear.
I'm no
terrorist.
Everything I said was
a lie... you have to believe me.
I'm actually a complete coward.
If I ever even saw a gun I'd--
Harry whips his pistol out in one liquid motion and snaps the
muzzle right in front of Simon's eyes.
SIMON
-- faint.
Aahhh!
Don't kill me.
I'm not a spy.
I'm nothing.
I'm
navel lint.
I have to lie to
women to get laid.
And I don't
score much.
It's pathetic.
(he looks down)
See, look... would a spy pee
himself?
Harry is finally sickened by his grovelling.
He pulls Simon
away from the edge, then gestures with his gun.
HARRY
Beat it.
SIMON
No.
Soon as I turn you'll shoot
me.
Harry starts back to the truck.
Simon stays right with him,
facing him, terrified to turn away.
Like a dog following him.
SIMON
Please don't.
You can have the
car for free--
GIB
Take off, dipshit!
Gib finally shoves Simon back and Harry contemptuously cranks
THREE ROUNDS into the ground by his feet, forcing him to dance
backward.
The two agents get into the van and tear off in a
cloud of dust.
Leaving Simon alone in the moonlight, miles
from nowhere.
CUT TO:
214
TIGHT ON LOCATOR SCREEN as a blip moves across the grid of city
streets.
Gib drives while Harry watches the screen.
HARRY
We should pick up visual at the
next light.
The scrambler phone in Harry's briefcase rings.
He picks it
up.
HARRY
Morning, boss.
215
HARRY
Absolutely.
But can it wait?
I'm on a critical surveillance
right now.
Harry spots something up ahead.
He snaps his fingers and
points, then whips a pair of gyro-stabilized binoculars to his
eyes.
HARRY'S POV THROUGH SCOPE:
Trent, on the Yamaha with Dana on
the back, rides through the intersection up ahead.
Dana bops
to the sound coming over her walkman headphones as Trent zips
between cars.
Gib makes the turn, pulling in behind them at a
distance.
TRILBY
Harry.
Is there anything you
want to tell me?
HARRY
(innocently)
No.
Not that I can think of.
THE CAMERA PUSHES IN ominously on Spencer Trilby.
TRILBY
Harry?
You know we never fire
anybody.
Click.
Harry hangs up the phone slowly.
GIB
We're dead, right?
So...
where'd you put the transmitter?
HARRY
In her Walkman.
It's the one
thing I knew she'd be taking.
217
Harry walks toward the closed warehouse doors, past Trent's
parked Yamaha.
We hear MUSIC from inside.
218
Harry appears through the doors, marching Dana by the arm.
He
walks her over to some industrial junk nearby, overgrown with
weeds, and sits her down for a talk.
She is sullen, still mortified from getting dragged out in
front of her friends.
HARRY
There are going to be some
changes Dana.
You're going to
start following some rules.
And
I'm going to be there to see that
you do.
DANA
Yeah, right.
HARRY
You're going to stay in school.
Do you understand?
DANA
Why?
So I can wind up like you?
What's the point?
You think Harry's going to really rain on her parade.
But he
doesn't.
He becomes very tender.
He pushes the hair back from
her face.
HARRY
Did I tell you about the time we
first met?
She looks up at him, puzzled?
HARRY
You were quite young at the time.
All wet and still attached to
your mom by a cord.
You opened
your eyes and looked right at me.
And I knew then I would always
love you with all my heart.
Dana stares at her father with a dawning awareness.
This is
not just some chump that she has to put up with.
This is her
father.
He is a part of her.
No matter what happens they are
in this thing together.
Tears start to run down her cheeks.
HARRY
Somewhere along the way I got
lost, honey.
I forgot about what
was really important.
I'm sorry
pump-- I mean--
She grabs his in a fierce hug.
Harry closes his eyes, letting
the moment purify him.
HARRY
Dana, regarding this singing--
She pulls back, suddenly wary.
Oh shit.
HARRY
(grinning)
You were pretty good.
222
Dana sits wedged into the front seat between Gib and Harry.
Father and daughter are singing raucously loud, with the
windows down.
HARRY/ DANA
I've been waiting so long To be
where I'm going In the sunshine

They crack up after the long sustain.
They are both suffused
with a glow of rediscovery.
Harry pulls the car to the curb in
front of Dana's school.
DANA
Dad, how come you know the words?
HARRY
Honey that song came out in 1968,
when I was exactly your age.
DANA
Unbelievable!
Trent told me he
wrote it.
He's history.
223
The rental van pulls up to a G-3 JET warming up outside a
private hanger.
The van doors open and the hostages are
brought out.
Harry sees a long black LIMO pulling up behind
the van.
The driver, an enormous man names AKBAR, hurries to
open the passenger door.
A slender pair of ankles emerge,
followed by the rest of Juno Skinner, looking devastatingly
beautiful but now quite sinister.
To Helen it is like a living James Bond film, with the jet, the
limo, the terrorists, and now an exotic femme fatale, dressed
to kill, approaching them.
JUNO
(with a wry smile)
Hello, Harry.
HARRY
Juno.
I wish I could say it's a
pleasure to see you again.
HELEN
You know her?
Juno signals with her eyes and the terrorists march the
prisoners toward the plane.
JUNO
Who's your little friend?
HELEN
I'm Helen Tasker.
Harry's my
husband.
And you are?
JUNO
(to Harry)
So now it's Tasker?
Not
Renquist?
239
The G-3 lifts into the night sky, turning south.
241
A small FREIGHTER is tied up to a half-crumbling pier.
Next to
the pier is a dilapidated corrugated-metal warehouse building,
two stories high.
There are floodlights on the dock but beyond
is black night, with the ghostly shapes of mangroves and palms.
It is an abandoned facility on what appears to be a tiny island
in the Caribbean.
There is a lot of activity.
Three U-RENT TRUCKS are parked by
the warehouse, as well as some other vehicles.
About thirty
men, clearly CRIMSON JIHAD TERRORISTS are busy at various
activities.
Many of them carry AK47 assault rifles.
MALIK is supervizing them as they finish unloading a tarp-
covered object about 15 feet high from the ship.
A rusting
gantry crane trundles it into the warehouse.
Malik looks up as
an AEROSPATIALE HELICOPTER thunders toward them over the black
Caribbean water.
The helicopter lands and Juno steps down from the front door.
The sliding door is opened and Akbar and the others pull a
groggy Harry and Helen out of the aircraft.
They are covered
by hoods.
Malik walks up to them and pulls their hoods off.
Harry takes
in his surroundings and looks back into the eyes of Malik.
Lethal energy flows between them.
MALIK
Who is this woman?
JUNO
His wife.
MALIK
(seeing the
possibilities)
His wife?
Good.
Bring them.
242
Harry and Helen emerge from the building, creeping through the
shadows.
She stops him for a second.
Gets very close to him,
whispering, crouched in the shadows.
HELEN
Tell me something before this
stuff wears off and you start
lying again.
HARRY
What?
HELEN
Do you still love me?
HARRY
Yes.
HELEN
As much as you used to?
HARRY
No.
(she deflates)
Much more.
She looks into his eyes, and knows he is telling the truth.
HELEN

It wore off.
At that moment, they hear yelling from the cinder-block
building.
HARRY
They found the bodies.
Come on--
249
Harry takes her hand and they sprint for cover at the edge of
the mangrove swamp.
A LIGHT HITS THEM.
TWO TERRORISTS,
running around the corner, open fire with AK47s just as Harry
and Helen reach a cluster of palm trees.
The trunks explode
*
with bullet hits as they run through the darkness.
*
As the two terrorists move through the trees, Harry lunges from
*
the shadows and grabs one from behind.
He wrests his rifle
*
away and swings it at the other, knocking his AK down.
The
*
first terrorist draws a knife and slashes at him, but Harry
grabs his knife arm and swings the blade into his partner.
Then he elbow smashes the first guy and seizes him in a two-
hand neck-breaker-- SNAP.
Two more run around the corner of a building.
Harry stomps his
*
foot down on one of the AKs, which is lying across a log.
It
*
flips into the air and he catches it in firing position .
.
*
.
and takes them out with two well-aimed bursts.
Helen comes
*
out of the shadows staring at Harry in amazement.
His shirt is
ripped, he is scratched and bleeding, holding an assault rifle
*
expertly and scanning the brush like a feral animal.

HELEN
I married Rambo.

He grabs her and kisses her passionately.

Not a good place.
He is pinned down by automatic
weapons fire.
He looks around for Helen, who is--
261
50 yards away.
She is unarmed and unable to help.
262
HARRY cranks up the pump on the refueling truck and grabs the
nozzle of the hose.
He opens the flow and-- A stream of JET-
FUEL blasts out of the nozzle and-- Harry fires his AK right
across the nozzle-- The muzzle-blast ignites the av-gas and he
has a flame thrower with a 70 foot reach.
Harry, lit demonically by the inferno, paints the whole area,
setting vehicles afire, and scattering the terrorists.
263
Through the flames and smoke he sees one of the men hand Malik
a LAW rocket.
Malik snaps it to his shoulder, preparing to
fire.
264
Harry runs toward the edge of the dock thirty feet away as--
MALIK fires.
The rocket shoots toward the truck and-- Harry
leaps toward the dark water as-- KABOOOM!
Behind him the gas
truck EXPLODES IN A HUGE FIREBALL.
265
ANGLE LOOKING UP, UNDERWATER, AS HARRY HITS THE WATER AND
dives down.
An instant later a sheet of fire sweeps across the
surface above him.
Harry kicks hard, trying to swim beyond the
inferno above him so he can surface.

Its muzzle taps the back of her head.
She gasps and turns to see-- JUNO, holding the weapon expertly.
JUNO
My condolences to the window.
*
Juno grabs her and yanks her to her feet.
Helen SLAPS JUNO
*
HARD.
Juno has a slash across her cheek.
Blood trickles down.
*
She grabs Helen's hand and viciously turns it, seeing the
*
wedding ring turned inward, the diamond on the palm-side.
Her
*
face darkens with fury and she points the gun at Helen's face,
*
preparing to kill her .
.
.
*
And Malik's hand grabs her wrist, stopping her.
*
MALIK
*
Not now.
We may need a hostage.
*
Juno grabs her and twists her around, pushing her toward the
*
limo nearby.
*
JUNO
Let's go, Suzy Homemaker.
267
Harry is still swimming.
He reaches the edge of the fire and
surfaces, gasping for breath.
Treading water he scans the
dock.
268
Amid the fire and smoke, he sees Juno walking Helen at gun
point toward a LIMO.
269
TRACKING WITH JUNO, approaching the car.
Malik passes, jumping
*
into the Aerospatiale with his few remaining men.
The fourth
*
bomb is clearly visible as the sliding door is closed.
The
*
copter pulls pitch, fanning the flames of the inferno below as
*
it arcs away.
AKBAR, the 300 pound terrorist/chauffeur opens the door and
*
Juno gets into the limo with Helen.
Akbar scrunches into the
front seat and starts the car.
270
There is just enough light to see some geography.
The island
is very tiny.
Running right over it and to the horizon in both
directions is the OVERSEAS HIGHWAY.
The terrorists' trucks
rumble up an on-ramp past a sign that says MIAMI - 110.
The
limo is the last member of the convoy.
The Aerospatiale passes
overhead, hugging the deck, headed for Miami at 150 knots.
271
It looks like the aftermath of a battle... burning wreckage,
black smoke, bodies.
Not a living soul around.
The smoke
swirls as two big BELL 206 HELICOPTERS settle on the middle of
the dock.
GIB jumps out of the nearest with an AR-15, scanning
the wreckage.
Several of his men, and a couple of DEA agents,
spread out.
Gib breaks into a grin as he sees--
HARRY, materializing out of the swirling smoke.
Dripping wet,
clothes ripped and bloody.
But okay.
GIB
I thought this look like your
work.
HARRY
Let's go.
I'll brief you in the
air.
GIB
You're welcome.
272
TRAFFIC on the two causeways is almost non-existent this early
in the morning.
The three rental trucks, followed by the limo
about a mile back, are almost the only vehicles.
274
The terrorists see the Harriers approaching on a low attack
run, and scramble to get out their Stingers.
The Harriers open fire with cannons and rocket pods on the
trucks below.
The 20mm cannons rip the ocean on either side of
the causeway into plumes of spray.
278
One of the Bomb trucks is hit.
It explodes and flies off the
*
bridge into the water.
The terrorists on one of the other
trucks fire a Stinger missile.
279
It arrows up, blowing one wing off the lead Harrier.
The pilot
ejects as the plane cartwheels into the sea and explodes.
280
The two remaining Harriers make an attack run, launching four
*
Maverick missiles at the bridge.
*
282
The missiles hit the support trestles ahead of the trucks and
*
.
.
.
K-BOOOOM!!
A whole section of the concrete span
*
collapses into the water.
283
The first truck is consumed in the blast.
The last truck
*
slides to the edge of the gap and stops.
*
284
Juno is trying to see what's going on ahead.
All they can see
is smoke and explosions.
Akbar is speaking heatedly (in
Arabic) into a walky talky and getting no answer.
Helen uses this moment of distraction to lunge forward,
grabbing the gun.
Juno fires wildly as they struggle for
control of the weapon.
The sound is deafening in the tiny
space.
The second shot catches Akbar behind the ear, and he
slumps forward.
His foot mashes down on the accelerator pedal
and the car surges faster.
285
The third Harrier fires its 2.75 Rockets and blows the
*
remaining truck into tinfoil.
Battle over.
Two bombs down.
286
*
THE LIMO tracks lazily back and forth across the lanes from one
guardrail to the other, throwing sheets of sparks where it
hits.
In is funneling along the causeway, unslowed, like an out-
of-control-train.
288
THE BELL 206 COPTER, descending rapidly.
Harry is climbing out
onto the skids.
He hooks on arm and leg over the skid and
hangs down as low as he can.
HELEN stands up in the opening
and waves her arms.
290
Gib is yelling at the DEA pilot, who's not thrilled with this
idea.
GIB
Get lower, goddamnit!
Right now!
Harry strains downward with one hand.
Helen reaches up toward
him.
The car screeches along the guard-rail, slamming against
it, throwing her from side to side in the sunroof.
Their
fingers touch, then separate.
She looks-- the limo is almost
on the precipice.
291
HARRY'S HAND grabs Helen's.
He pulls her out of the car just
as the limo clears the edge.
She is jerked through the
sunroof, screaming.
The car falls away, arcing gracefully to
the ocean below.
It hits with an enormous explosion of water.
293
HARRY PULLS HELEN up onto the skid with him, getting her
stable.
She is gasping, holding on for dear life.
She looks
down at the ocean, the burning wreckage on the bridge, the
whole unbelievable panorama.
Then she looks at Harry and-- Grins.
She's alive!
And so is
he.
And not only that, this is the biggest rush of her life.
Harry grins back.
Surprised and pleased that she is more of a
soul-mate than he ever knew.
CUT TO:
294
ANGLE ON A HARRIER, landing in full-hover on the causeway.
The
shriek of the jet engine is enormous.
It bounces down onto its
wheels like a big inscect.
The other remaining Harrier is
already down, behind it.
295
TRACKING past burning wreckage to Harry's Bell 206 just
settling on the highway.
B.G.
the other DEA Bell 206 is
landing with the Harrier pilot who ejected hanging in a sling.
Harry jumps out of the open door, followed by Helen and Gib.
*
Harry looks at his watch.
*
HARRY
Any minute now.
GIB
(with a megaphone/ to
everybody)
It's show time.
Don't look at
*
the flash.
Do not look at the
flash.
HARRY
*
(to Helen)
*
We're safe here.
*
296
Helen and Harry move away from the agents.
They are safe and
together.
They look at each other, and there is nothing to
say.
Harry removes her wedding band from the wrong hand and
*
slips it back onto its rightful finger.
*
He leans forward to kiss her.
She reaches for him.
Their lips
*
meet.
297
And they are locked together in that position when the sky
lights up behind them.
Talk about fireworks.
Harry covers her
*
eyes and they stay in the kiss.
*
They are in no danger, but the effect is stunning.
The classic
*
mushroom cloud appears at the horizon.
Helen watches, awed,
the most glorious and terrifying sight of our age.
HELEN
*
That was some kiss.
*
The two young Harrier pilots stand nearby, watching the
mushroom disperse.
Gib is with the other Omega agents, his
finger pressed in his ear, listening to his headset.
He waves
to Harry to come to him.
Harry detaches from Helen and walks over to him.
Helen watches
him go... back to work.
She glances over at the two Harrier
pilots.
HELEN
(to the pilots)
That's my husband.
HARRY goes into the huddle with Gib and the others.
GIB
Malik's copter landed twenty
minutes ago in Miami.
He's on
the top of a high-rise downtown.
SWAT's on the scene, and I got
the cops sealing off the area.
*
He renezvous'd there with about
*
a dozen more faction members.
*
They're barricaded on the
*
twentieth floor.
(he gets very serious)
*
Harry, they have a hostage.
It's
*
Dana.
*
HARRY
*
My Dana!?
GIB
They must have grabbed her during
the night... we didn't know.
Sorry, Harry, I--
298
But Harry is already moving.
He sprints toward the nearest
Harrier, witch is idling nearby.
Gib runs after him.
GIB
Harry!
We'll get her out!
We
*
have a man inside already .
.
*
.
Harry!!
Aw, shit... here we
go.
Harry walks up to the young pilot...
HARRY
I need to borrow this thing for
a few minutes.
He pushes past the pilot before the guy can react.
PILOT
Excuse me .
.
.
sir?!
*
GIB
*
Force Comm cleared you to give us
*
total cooperation, right?
*
PILOT
*
Yessir, but .
.
.
*
GIB
*
That's coming right from the
*
President, Captain.
*
PILOT
*
Yessir.
Uh .
.
.
sir?
You're
*
going to have to sign for the
*
aircraft.
*
GIB
*
I'll sign for it.
You got a pen?
*
(one of the agents
*
pulls out a pen)
*
Here, he'll sign for it.
*
Harry is in the cockpit by now.
Gib climbs up.
*
GIB
I'd like to remind you that it
has been ten years since you were
actually in one of these.
HARRY
If I break it they can take it
out of my pay.
299
Gib is standing, watching Harry go.
He never believes this
guy.
Harry's voice comes over the walky...
HARRY
Tell Helen what's going on.
Tell
her I love her.
And ask the
pilot where the button for the
20mm cannon is-- never mind.
I
found it.
The plane disappears toward Miami.
301
AN AERIAL SHOT, circling the building.
It is an unfinished
building in the high rise district.
The Aerospatiale sits on
the roof, its rotor turning slowly.
The street below is jammed
with cars.
Honking horns echo up the glass canyons.
302
ANGLE AT STREETLEVEL as cops use bullhorns and bad attitudes to
clear the street around the building, setting up a perimeter
two blocks away.
303
ON THE ROOF, Malik bursts through the stairwell door.
His TWO
MEN have followed him.
Malik stops suddenly when he sees--
Dana standing at the edge of the roof.
She is holding the
ARMING KEY by its chain.
Dangling it over the edge.
He
signals to his men not to fire.
DANA
(terrified, but
thinking)
You shoot me, this'll fall.
Malik advances slowly, his eyes glistening ferally.
She backs
up a step with each of his, moving along the edge of the roof.
Malik keeps his pistol aimed at her chest.
DANA
Don't come any closer.
I'll drop
it!
I swear to God.
MALIK
If you drop it, I will have no
reason not to kill you.
He advances, calling her bluff.
She backs away from him along
the edge.
MALIK
Come on, child.
Give me the key.
(smiling)
Don't you want to live?
I give
you my word.
DANA
No way you whacko.
She reaches the corner of the building.
Her back touches
something.
it is the boom of a small crane, used for lifting
building supplies.
Careful to keep the key dangling over open
space, Dana climbs up on the lattice-work boom and moves out
beyond the edge of the building, never taking her eyes off
Malik.
She is hyperventilating, terrified, but thinking
clearly.
Malik steps up on the crane, crawling out after her.
He knows
she will not drop the key as long as he has the gun.
It is a
game which will end when she reaches the end of the boom.
Dana
puts the key between her teeth so she can hang on better.
It
is windy and the boom is swinging.
306
RISING INTO VIEW, LIKE A GARGOYLE FROM HELL, IS THE HARRIER.
It fills the windows completely, hovering only a few feet
outside.
The terrorists raise their AK-47s to fire just as
Harry hits the 20mm nose-cannon.
308
Glass explodes into glittering mist, and terrorists explodes
into bloody spray as Harry pivots the plane and the cannon
sweeps the floor clear from side to side.
The Crimson Jihad is
vaporized.
309
Malik hears the thunder of the jet and the firing, but from
where he is he can't see what's going on.
He focuses on the
key.
He must have that key.
310
Malik's TWO REMAINING MEN run to the helicopter, gesticulating
to the pilot to get ready to take off.
The pilot revs the
turbine and the rotor whirls faster.
The two men jump in,
picking up M-60 machine guns.
311
MALIK IS STILL ADVANCING out the crane boom.
Dana slips as she
backs up, toppling off the boom.
She is hanging now by her
hands over a 20 story drop.
Malik is almost to her.
He needs a hand free to grab her.
He
sets his gun down on the girder.
He grabs for her wrist.
312
ANGLE LOOKING DOWN.
Malik, Dana, the street far below.
With
an unbelievable roar the Harrier sweeps in beneath Dana,
FILLING FRAME.
313
Harry has the canopy up.
Malik sees Harry, ten feet below.
His eyes narrow with an all-consuming rage.
He glances at the
pistol on the beam.
Back at the girl, the key in her teeth--
So close.
Harry maneuvers the cockpit directly under Dana.
HARRY
(shouting)
Let go baby!
I've got you!
Daddy's got you!
314
Malik lunges for her wrist.
She screams and lets go-- Dana
drops and hits the windshield of the hovering jet-- Harry grabs
her with his left hand, right hand still on the stick-- He
holds her until she can get a grip.
She is lying across the
nose of the plane.
Harry starts to bank away and--
315
Malik shrieks in rage.
He grabs his 9mm pistol and leaps off
the crane--
316
Onto the back of the plane.
He starts crawling toward the
cockpit.
Dana screams and Harry looks back, but just then--
317
The Aerospatiale swings around the building right in front of
them-- The door-gunner OPENS FIRE.
318
Harry banks hard, taking the hits under the wing.
He pivots
and slides sideways around the building, playing tag with the
copter.
He can't do anything radical enough to dislodge Malik without
tossing off his own daughter.
319
The helicopter appears around the corner, guns blazing in the
doors.
Harry pivots the plane and FIRES THE NOSE CANNON.
The
helicopter is riddled.
It tilts and plummets, auto-rotating
out of control.
320
As the copter hits the ground and explodes.
Fortunately the
police had created a cleared perimeter.
321
THE HARRIER dips and slews, half out of control.
Malik is
taking aim with the pistol, right at Harry's head.
Harry grabs
his daughter with his left hand, holding her with all his
strength and he-- Jinks the stick hard, just as-- Malik opens
fire, but-- The plane tilts wildly and Malik topples, screaming--
He slides along the wing, and falls over the leading edge--
Only to catch himself on the only available hand-hold-- The
last Sidewinder missile.
322
Harry and Malik lock eyes for one long second.
Then Harry hits
the FIRING STUD.
The Sidewinder drops away and ignites.
Carrying Malik out over Miami Beach.
It explodes a mile out to
sea.
323
