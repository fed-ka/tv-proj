          FADE IN:

  11EXT. SARAH'S APARTMENT (1995) PREDAWN (FROM PILOT)

          A steady rain falls on JOHN SMITH and SARAH BRACKNELL. 
          He's holding his jacket over her so she won't get too
            soaked...they study each others' faces for a beat... he
          kisses her on her raindropped nose, smiles gently...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't I go rent us some old
                        movies for a rainy afternoon...?

          As he moves away, she watches him with love... he glances
          back and sees her one last time - she waves good-bye...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Love you.

          He gets in his car and drives away.


  22INT./EXT. TRUCK CAB/WINDING ROAD - MOVING - NIGHT - 1995

          P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD

          The frantic THUP-THUP-THUP of windshield wipers is no
          match for the MACHINE-GUN RAIN punishing the cab roof on
          this epic night; nor for THE MACARENA, which BLASTS at
          top volume from a tinny A.M. radio.

          Then, abruptly, the screen goes DARK and SILENT.  But
          only for a second or two; then --


          P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD

          The same view a little further down the same road, and
          the same sounds: WIPERS.  RAIN.  MACARENA.  And then --
          BLACKNESS.  SILENCE.  Just for a beat.  Then we see --


          THE DRIVER

          IN SILENCE.  Late twenties.  Friendly face.  Five-o'clock
          shadow.  And, oh, he's ASLEEP.  A BUMP in the road awakens
          him and we hear WIPERS, RAIN, MACARENA again.  He grabs
          the wheel, straightens out the truck and, and then the
          driver--



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: COLLISION - TEASER - 2/13/04 - YELLOW       2.


    2CONTINUED:2

          WINKS OUT AGAIN, just for a second this time, to SILENCE --
          his audio P.O.V., so to speak; then he AWAKENS and we
          hear WIPERS, RAIN, MACARENA.


  33EXT. WINDING ROAD - NIGHT (1995)

          The truck hauls ass, going screen right to screen left,
          past a yellow sign with a black squiggle and the legend
          SLOW CURVES NEXT 8 MILES.

          SUPERTITLE: June 6 1995.


  44EXT. WINDING ROAD - NIGHT (1995) (FROM PILOT)

            A classic seventies Eldorado drives through the same deluge
          on the same night.  It goes screen left to screen right.


  55INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT (1995) (FROM PILOT)

          Johnny Smith at the wheel.  He's in high spirits, and why
          not?  He's young.  He's in love.  He's a popular teacher. 
          He's listening to Art Bell Coast to Coast on the radio:

                                        ART BELL (RADIO)
                        -- and this comet, they call it
                        Hale-Bopp, the experts are saying
                        it has a second blip behind it,
                        that Dr. Burns believes may be a
                        space ship.  Hale Bopp will reach
                        closest approach in March, 1997,
                        just a few months from now --

          Johnny smiles; he's listening "ironically." (Remember
          irony?)  Then, BRIGHT TRUCK LIGHTS bear down on him. 
            Milliseconds before the vehicles collide --

                                                                                  CUT TO:


  66INT. RACHEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT (2004)

          Johnny and REBECCA CALDWELL pack up Rachel's belongings;
          moving boxes are scattered across the floor.  A couple
            well-worn funeral bouquets grace the mantel.  Johnny holds
          a couple of books, and hesitates --

                                        JOHNNY
                          Rebecca?
                                (she looks up)
                        Rachel had all these religious
                        studies books.
                                        (MORE)

                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: COLLISION - TEASER - 2/20/04 - GOLD-2       3.


    6CONTINUED:6

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Do you want to save them?  Or
                        should I put them in the Goodwill
                        box?

          Rebecca, her back to Johnny as she goes through a different
          box, answers without looking up from the pictures she has
          found.

                                        REBECCA
                          Goodwill.  I'm not going to haul
                        all those back to D.C. 

          Johnny adds the books to the goodwill box, then looks to
          Rebecca, seeing that she has started to cry.


          REBECCA

          Has found some of the pictures of her and Rachel as little
          girls (from episode one and two).  She fights back tears. 
          Johnny puts a supportive hand on her shoulder. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        You okay?

          After a beat, she pulls herself together.

  6CONTINUED: (2)6

                                        REBECCA
                                (nods yes)
                        Yeah... yeah I'm okay.
                              (a beat)
                        I just can't believe she's gone.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know.

          She gives him a long look.

                                        REBECCA
                          Johnny... I've been meaning to
                        say 'thanks.'  You've been great
                        these last few weeks.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't we take a break, get
                          something to eat?

                                        REBECCA
                        I'd like that.

          FLASHING RED LIGHTS flicker across the window.  There's a
          KNOCK at the door.  Rebecca answers to find Roscoe standing
          outside --

                                        REBECCA
                        Hello?

                                        ROSCOE
                          Evening, Ms. Caldwell.  I saw
                        Johnny Smith's car outside. 
                        Sheriff Bannerman's been looking
                        for him.

                                        REBECCA
                                (worried)
                          Johnny...

          Johnny leans out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's up, Roscoe?

                                        ROSCOE
                        An eleven year old girl went
                        missing this morning.  Katy Mercer,
                        lives out by Winnetka Farms. 
                        We've already got an Amber Alert
                        going -- but Walt sent this --
                        Thought you might be able to help.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: COLLISION - TEASER - 2/18/04 - YEL-2        5.


  6CONTINUED: (3)6

          Roscoe unwraps a handkerchief revealing an earring. 
          Rebecca watches, intrigued --

                                        ROSCOE
                        Said it's Katy's favorite.  The
                        mother said she's probably wearing
                        the other one.  Here's a picture.

          Johnny looks at the photo; Katy's a pretty eleven-year-
          old girl.  Rebecca takes the picture.

                                        REBECCA
                        Her parents must be worried sick.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let me see what I can do.

          Johnny takes the earring, triggering:


77A VISION - MATCH MOVE MORPH

          The room melts away.  Johnny is engulfed in a sea of FIRE;
          its origin indistinct, but Johnny reels from the heat.


  88RESUME - INT. RACHEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Johnny, still in the grip of the vision, eyes closed tight,
          pulls his arms around himself, as if he is burning alive --

                                        REBECCA
                        What's happening?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Fire.  Everywhere... I'm burning.

          Rebecca pries the earring out of Johnny's hand.  Johnny's
          body relaxes and he regains his bearings, collapsing
          against the wall for support.  Roscoe helps steady him. 

                                        REBECCA
                        Johnny.  Are you okay?

    8CONTINUED:8

                                        JOHNNY
                          I think.  Yes. 

                                        REBECCA
                        What happened?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  I felt like I was
                        on fire.

          Johnny straightens up, a bit dazed.

                                        ROSCOE
                        What about the girl?  Do you know
                        where she is?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.

  99EXT. FARMHOUSE -- DAY

          Idealized, overbright rural splendor.  KATY MERCER, 11,
          pretty, swings on a rope swing in front of the picturesque
          Mercer farmhouse.  Each arc of the swing takes her just
          high enough to see -- but not to hear -- her parents,
          JANET, 30, and WAYNE, 33, a mechanic.

          CLOSER.  We see that the parents are arguing.

                                        JANET
                        Just because you're gone doesn't
                        mean the rent went down.

                                        WAYNE
                        I'll have it in a couple days --

                                        JANET
                        And what do I tell the landlord
                        while you're getting your act
                          together?

          REVEAL JOHNNY SMITH, standing there, but not interacting:
          we are, and have been, in a VISION. 

          Johnny watches as Wayne stomps to his car.  (Johnny sees
          that he drives away alone.)

          Johnny looks up to where Katy was; the swing is empty
          now, but still swinging; she's just gone.  He looks in
          the dirt and sees --

          A GIRL'S HELLO KITTY DIARY, dropped below the swing. 

          Day becomes night, and we return to reality --


  1010EXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT

          Johnny leans on the frame of the swing set (now illuminated
          by police floodlights) and stares at the ground.  Walt,
          Janet and Rebecca stand closest; half a dozen others watch
          from a polite distance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        There was a diary here.

                                        JANET
                        Katy's diary?  It's in the house. 
                        I found it here earlier.

                                        WALT
                        We'll need to see that.

                        Okay.  I'll get it.

          Janet heads into the house.

                        Johnny, you don't have to do this.
                                (off Johnny's look)
                        Roscoe told me what happened when
                        you touched the earring.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not a problem.

                        Bangor P.D. and the Highway Patrol
                        are working with us.  We have a
                          statewide A.P.B. for the girl,
                        and her father.  The National
                        Guard even loaned us a chopper
                        with infrared.  What I'm saying
                        is, if you're not feeling up to
                        this --

                                (end of discussion)
                        Walt -- I'm fine.

                                        WALT
                                (to Rebecca)
                        Ms. Caldwell, you're a child
                          psychologist, right?

                        I'm a therapist for the juvenile

                                        WALT
                        Maybe you could take a look at
                        the diary, see what you make of
                        it.

                        Of course.  Anything I can do to
                        help. 


  1111INT. FARMHOUSE / DEN -- A FEW MINUTES LATER -- NIGHT

          Rebecca flips through the diary as Janet and Walt watch.
          Johnny meanwhile looks around the room.

                                        REBECCA
                        Katy's a bright girl Mrs. Mercer. 
                        She has a talent for writing.

                                        JANET
                        Yes, ma'am.  But please don't
                        believe everything you read in
                        there.

                                        REBECCA
                        I can tell you love Katy.

                                        JANET
                        She's my whole world.

                                        REBECCA
                        You and your husband are separated?

                                        JANET
                        Yes.

                                        REBECCA
                        I'm sorry.  I know how stressful
                        that can be.

                                        JANET
                        It's the right decision.  But
                        it's been hard on Katy.

                                        WALT
                        And you're absolutely sure Katy's
                        not with your husband?

                                        JANET
                        She wasn't in the car with him
                        when he left.  Wayne and I have
                        our differences, but he'd never
                        do this.

          Rebecca puts a supportive hand on Janet's shoulder.

                                        WALT
                        We're trying to track him down. 
                        He's driving back to Portland.

                                        REBECCA
                        Katy writes several times about
                        wanting to run away, has she ever
                        done anything like that?

                                        JANET
                        No.  Never.  She's a good girl.

          out of his reverie, and turns to Janet.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Mrs. Mercer, would you mind giving
                        us a minute?

                                        JANET
                              (a little worried)
                        Of course.  I'll go make another
                        pot of coffee.

          They wait till she exits.

                        What do you think?

                                        REBECCA
                        Katy's a bright kid, going through
                        a tough time.  She does mention
                        missing her father, but that's
                        normal considering their recent
                          separation.

                                        WALT

                        Why'd you ask her to leave?

                        After the earring, I wasn't sure
                        what would happen when I touch
                        the diary.  I didn't want to scare
                        her.

                                        WALT
                        I was afraid of that.

                        You ready?

          Johnny nods yes.  Rebecca watches, concern on her face as
          Walt hands Johnny the diary; triggering --


    1212FIRST-PERSON VISION: INT. HOSPITAL (1995) - NIGHT

          Johnny stands in the corridor of a hospital as paramedics
          (including RICK FANULI, shaggy hair, late twenties) rush
          past him with a badly injured patient -- JOHNNY HIMSELF.

                        I don't think he's going to make
                        it.

          Johnny begins to follow the paramedics, but is distracted
          by...

          KATY

          standing at the end of the hallway, silent, eyes wide,
          staring straight through Johnny.  Nurses and Doctors rush
          past, ignoring her as they descend on the room the
          Paramedics went into.  As Johnny walks toward Katy, an
          incongruous sound begins to grow louder in the background,
            a distinctive KLAXON, blasting a pattern, two short - one
          long - two short - one long.

          Just as Johnny is about to reach Katy, he feels something
          hot.  He looks down at himself seeing:

          HIS HAND

          Burned badly, but still holding the charred diary.  He
          drops the diary and the VISION ENDS.


  1313INT. FARMHOUSE / DEN - NIGHT

          Walt and Rebecca watch as Johnny drops the diary; flapping
          his hand in the air as if it were on fire.  He recovers
          almost instantly, but the phantom pain from his vision-
          burn lingers.

                        But the pain was real.

          Rebecca looks at Johnny askance; then steps closer.  She
          takes Johnny's hand and looks it over.

                        We've alerted everybody on staff
                        to keep an eye out for Katy and
                        I've got a couple of deputies
                        going room to room just in case.

                          Couldn't tell.  Maybe another car
                          accident.  Maybe fire.  Either
                        way it didn't look good.

          Walt and Rebecca exchange a look of concern.

                        What about the girl?

          Johnny is lost in thought, remembering something else.

                        I saw my hand burned in a vision,
                        but I felt real pain.  Gone now
                        though.

          On the present-day side of the split reality, Rebecca
          watches as Johnny's face lights up; overcome with emotion. 

          On the 1995 side of the vision, Johnny approaches a woman
          seated in the corner, distraught --

          VERA SMITH doesn't hear or see Johnny. She is being
          consoled by a younger REVEREND PURDY:

                          I talked to the doctor, and they're

                        My mom... she's here, in my

                        years ago... but...

          WHAT JOHNNY IS LOOKING AT

          Katy is walking among the people in the waiting room,
          passing right by Vera, Purdy and Sarah.  Johnny follows
          her, looking down at the floor where he sees:

          Katy's footprints are a trail of damp impressions, as if
          the linoleum were made of mud; and then her last several
          steps leave watery traces before her trail disappears
          around a corner.  He bends down to touch one of the wet
          footprints, FIRE SUDDENLY SHOOTING UP HIS ARM.  He jumps
          up and the VISION ENDS.

                        Walked right through the waiting

                        of wet footprints.

          the spot where Katy seemed to have left wet footprints;
          it's perfectly dry.

  1919INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          Johnny and Rebecca puzzle through the vision he had --

                                        REBECCA
                        I want to help you figure this
                        out... Part of your vision is
                          straightforward --

                                        JOHNNY
                        - the night of my accident --

                                        REBECCA
                        Right.  1995.  Set that aside for
                          a minute.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay.

                                        REBECCA
                        The other part, the Katy Mercer
                        part -- it's not something that
                        really happened?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not something that could
                        ever happen.

                                        REBECCA
                        So it's more like dream imagery?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Could be.  But that's not how my
                        visions normally work.

                                        REBECCA
                        You said yourself this was
                        different.  Sometimes our dreams
                        are a way for the the unconscious
                        mind to tell us something.  Maybe
                        your visions are sending you some
                        kind of message.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But what does Katy have to do
                        with the night of my accident?

                                        REBECCA
                          Something about her situation
                          resonates for you.  Even for
                        myself, searching for this girl
                        keeps making me think of Rachel.

                        So my visions of Katy are
                        triggering visions of the night
                        of my accident.

                                        REBECCA
                        And visions of your accident evoke
                        Katy.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (considers this)
                        And this could be my Dead Zone
                        trying to tell me something?  But
                        what?

                                        REBECCA
                        What else stood out about the
                        vision?

                                        JOHNNY
                        When she was walking... she left
                        wet footprints.

                                        REBECCA
                        Water?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Maybe...

          Johnny starts to dial his cell phone.  Announcements in
          the hospital P.A. indicate a trauma patient is arriving
          by ambulance.

                                        REBECCA
                        Who are you calling?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt.  Maybe it means Katy's near
                        a body of water.  It's a stretch
                        but...
                                (in phone)
                        Walt.  It's Johnny.  I think the
                        fire might start near a body of
                          water... I don't know what kind
                        of water: river?  lake?  pool?

          While he's on the phone a team of paramedics rush by,
          with a badly-injured woman; among them is E.M.T. Rick
          Fanuli, nine years older, and with shorter hair.

                                (then, seeing Fanuli)
                        Walt, I have to go.

          Johnny hangs up and runs after the gurney; at the door to
          the E.R. the paramedics hand off the patient to waiting
          doctors, who take her into the emergency room.  After the
          hand-off Rick walks to the counter.  Johnny stops him --

                        Excuse me.  Sir?

                        Yeah?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hi, my name's Johnny Smith.  Can
                        I ask you a couple questions?

                                        RICK
                                (slightly in awe)
                        I know who you are, Mr. Smith. 
                        I've been following your story in
                        the news for years.  I was the
                        first guy at your accident scene. 
                        I'm Rick Fanuli.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nice to meet you, Rick.

          Johnny reaches out to shake Rick's hand, triggering --


  2020VISION: INT. BACK OF RESCUE VEHICLE (1995) - NIGHT

          We're back to the night of the accident; Johnny-2004 sits
          in the back of a rescue vehicle.  Johnny babbles.

                                          JOHNNY-1995
                        ...Save many many lives...

                                        RICK
                        That's my job.

                        ...Too much to do...

                                        RICK
                        Don't worry about a thing.  I'll
                        take care of you.  Relax now.          DEAD ZONE: COLLISION - ACT TWO - 2/20/04 - GOLD-2     19.


  2121INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (1995) - NIGHT

          URGENT PAGES for doctors are broadcast on the intercom;
          distant SIRENS whine; and Johnny-2004 watches as Rick-
          1995 and other paramedics speed past, pushing a gurney
          carrying a very bloodied Johnny-1995. 

          Then, all sound drops out; and the corridor is suddenly
          empty, except for Johnny-2004.  He turns around and sees --


          KATY

          At the far end of the corridor, shivering, seeming to
          look right through Johnny.  He walks toward her; she steps
          through a door.  Johnny follows.


  2222INT. SURGERY PREP ROOM (1995) - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)

          Katy is gone; what Johnny-2004 sees instead is Johnny-
          1995's broken, bloodied body; all around him doctors and
          nurses prep for surgery.

          In an omniscient wide view, Sarah pushes through, ducking
          around an orderly who tries to stop her; she takes Johnny-
          1995's broken hand in her own --

                                        SARAH
                        Oh, Johnny. 

          Johnny-1995 opens his eyes a sliver; it's unclear if he
          knows where he is.  He barely is able to whisper something
          to Sarah, and she bends close to listen, BUT WE DO NOT
          HEAR WHAT HE SAYS.

                                        SARAH
                        What Johnny?  ...Yes.
                                (listens more)
                        Yes.  We'll find him.  Don't worry
                        about that now.

          DR. McDOUGALL, 40's, a surgeon, interrupts --

                                        DR. MCDOUGALL
                        Ma'am.  You can't be back here --

          Johnny-1995 is struggling to say something; Sarah leans

    22CONTINUED:22

          down to listen -- neither we, nor Johnny-2004 can hear
          what he says.  The doctors block her and an orderly starts
          to pull her away --

                                        SARAH
                        I'll always love you, Johnny. 

          The orderly pulls Sarah away, into the hall.  Johnny-2004
          stays behind; when there are no more civilians in the
          room, Fanuli leans to one of the nurses and whispers --

                                        RICK
                                  (whispering)
                        Best thing that could happen to
                        this guy is if he could let go.

          The doctors rush Johnny-1995 into the O.R. and the vision
          ends.


    22A22ARESUME - INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          Johnny and Rick are still shaking hands; Johnny's right
          forearm and hand are charred black.  Johnny pulls his
            blackened hand away from Rick, startled --

                                        RICK
                        What's the matter?
                                (no reply)
                        You just had some kind of psychic
                          premonition or something didn't
                        you?

          Johnny examines his hand; it's perfectly normal, now.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Or something.

                                        RICK
                        Cool.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Rick, were you the one who pulled
                        me from my car?

                                        RICK
                        No one pulled you out of the car. 
                        You were already clear of the
                        wreck when I got there.  You must
                        have crawled out on your own.

                        An old lady driving past, called
                        from the gas station up the road.   
                        I'm positive I was the first guy

                        greatness: I'm the guy who saved
                        Johnny Smith's life.

                        a fire with them right now.

                        Is it near water?

                        Yes.  South shore of Fieldstone
                        Pond.


  2525RESUME HOSPITAL - JOHNNY, REBECCA, RICK

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll meet you there.
                                (then to Rebecca)
                        The siren I heard in my vision
                        was for a volunteer fire
                          department.  They've got a fire
                        near Fieldstone pond.  This could
                        be it.

                                        RICK
                        I just got the call.  You can
                        ride with me.


  2626EXT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

          Strobing red lights illuminate the spray of firehoses
            extinguishing the last flames of a fire that has nearly
            destroyed a mobile home; thick white smoke billows into
          the night.

          A second building on the same property is unscathed; a
            firetruck and several patrol cars are parked nearby. 
          Rick's rescue vehicle pulls up and Johnny and Rebecca get
          out, just in time to see --

          Rush into the smoldering mobile home.

                        We don't know yet.


  2727INT. SMOLDERING MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

          Steam and smoke fill the air of the tiny, charred mobile
          home; Walt uses his gloved hands and the ax to rip open
          every cupboard and closet, but it's all so burned,  and
          the smoke so thick, it's impossible to tell if anyone is
          in amongst the wreckage.


  2828EXT. MOBILE HOME - NIGHT

          Walt staggers out; soot clings to his face and his clothes. 
          Several hopeful fire fighters look to him for an answer;
          he shakes his head back and forth; he didn't find her.

                                        WALT
                        I couldn't see anything.

          Johnny approaches the smoking wreckage and lays a hand on
          a beam.  Nothing: no hit, no whoosh.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She's not in there.

                                        WALT
                        Thank God.  I was afraid we were
                        too late.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What now?

                        why my visions keep taking me

                        Hi.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (re: Rebecca's presence)
                        I was helping Rebecca pack when
                        Roscoe came and got me, she's
                        been a huge help.

                        Walt told me... that poor girl. 
                        What can I do to help?

                        I have to ask you something.  I
                        need you to help me remember
                          something about the worst night
                        of my life...

                        You were the last person I spoke
                        to that night.

                        Yes.  After we... were together
                        at the carnival.  What does this
                        have to do with the missing girl?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure yet.  But in my
                        vision, we talked again, later,
                        here at the hospital, what did I
                        say to you?

                                        SARAH
                        Oh, Johnny... It was so chaotic. 
                        I was terrified... I thought you
                        were going to die... you were so
                        out of it... It's been nine
                          years...

          Rebecca is watching this, surprised to find out the full
          extent of Johnny and Sarah's relationship.

                          Sometimes our memories can be
                          merciful... we forget painful
                        moments... at least consciously.

                                (to Sarah)
                        That's why I asked you to meet me

                        here might help your memory... or
                        my visions... maybe I can see

          Johnny finds himself standing beside Sarah-2004 seeing 
          Sarah-1995 in his vision, as she was the night of the
            accident, pacing nervously.  Nearby are Vera and Reverend
          Purdy. 

          Sarah-2004, in the reality side of the vision tries to
          think what happened next:

                        I sat out here, with your mother
                        and Reverend Purdy, almost all
                        night.  It felt like forever.

          On the vision side of the split-reality, Sarah-1995 sees
          the doctor gesture to Vera and Reverend Purdy; she walks
          over to join them.

          Sarah-1995 puts a supportive hand on Vera's shoulder to
          comfort her.  Purdy-1995 listens intently.  The doctor
          speaks quietly.

                        Mrs. Smith?  Do you want to sit

                        No.  Just tell me about my son.

                                        DR. MCDOUGALL
                        The impact of the crash was quite
                          substantial.  His femur suffered
                        two fractures; we put several
                        pins into his left foot. 
                                (the really bad news)
                        He suffered extensive contusions
                        to the brain.  We're still trying
                        to relieve some of the swelling
                        but he hasn't regained
                          consciousness.  Unfortunately
                        with the severity of his injuries
                        its likely he never will.

          Sarah reacts.

          The doctor chooses his words carefully.

          dodges an orderly as she rushes into the prep room,
          ignoring the busy doctors and nurses that move around
          her.  (This scene covers the same action as sc. 22, but
          is tighter, more from Sarah's perspective.)  She takes
          Johnny's hand, looking into his face.  This time in the
          vision, we see their eyes meet.

                                going with that line)
                        -- No!  No matter what -- I want
                        you to do everything.  Everything
                        to keep my boy alive.

                        You don't have to decide right
                        now.  You need to consider the
                        quality of life in his condition --

                                        PURDY
                        Mrs. Smith has made up her mind. 
                        If there's even the smallest
                          possibility that Johnny will pull
                          through, you have to take every
                        measure to keep him alive.

          Sarah slowly sits down, a state of shock gripping her as
          she begins to realize her life, and Johnny's, will never
          be the same.


    31E31EVISION - SARAH AND JOHNNY - SURGERY PREP ROOM

          (Again a closer version of Sc. 22) As the orderlies prepare
          to wheel Johnny into surgery, he keeps trying to speak to
          Sarah, and she leans in close to hear the last words he
          will say for six years.

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...tell the man... I'm just a
                        school teacher...

          And then Sarah tells Johnny the last words he'll hear for
          six years...

                                        SARAH
                        I'll always love you Johnny.

          Johnny-2004 watches as Sarah is pried away from Johnny
          95, a doctor gently keeping her from following as Johnny
          is wheeled into surgery.

          As Sarah is taken out one direction, and Johnny 95 is
          taken out the other, Johnny-2004 finds himself alone in
          the prep room.

          Behind him something moves.  Johnny turns around to see:


3232A DOORWAY

          Blue light arcing from some unseen source inside the room. 
          Johnny walks toward the light, not sure what he'll find
          inside the room.  As he reaches the threshold of the room
          the blue light illuminates his face and he reacts with a
          mixture of awe and horror to what he sees --

          JOHNNY'S POV: POST OP RECOVERY ROOM

          Johnny-1995 lies near death, his battered head held
          together by bandages, a tangle of tubes and wires helping
          him cling to life. 

          Next to his bed stands Katy, looking impassively at Johnny-
          1995 as a cascade of 10,000 volt blue sparks shower the
          room.

          As Johnny-2004 watches, the sparks suddenly touch off an
          explosion, the room suddenly replaced by a WALL OF FIRE
          that surrounds Johnny-2004 as the VISION ENDS.


  3333INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny pulls his hand off of Sarah; he's back in the
          waiting room.  He looks at Sarah; looks at Rebecca; then
          looks --


          AT HIS REFLECTION

          In a glass window; Johnny's face is deeply scarred with
            third-degree burns.


          BACK TO SCENE

          Johnny backs up, horrified; he puts his hands to his face;
          then he looks again --

          IN THE REFLECTION

          He's fine now; no burns at all.

                        Johnny --

          He's disoriented and blacks out for a second.  Johnny
          leans on Rebecca and Sarah for support.  Off Johnny's
          stunned look...

  3434INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny leans on Rebecca as she steers him to a chair in
          the waiting room.  Sarah notices the gesture; she may
          realize there's more between Johnny and Rebecca than even
          they know.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, what happened?  Are you
                        okay?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw an explosion.  I was burned. 
                        My face...

          Rebecca touches his face.  Sarah notices.

                                        REBECCA
                        Are you in pain now?

                        No. The pain fades with the vision.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, you've got to be careful. 
                        You can't keep doing this to
                          yourself.

          Rick notices Johnny's distress; rushes across the room --

          Rick steps back and pulls out his emergency radio to make
          the call.  As Rebecca comforts Johnny, he turns his
            attention to Sarah --

                        just relax now, buddy.

          A look of terrible pain crosses Johnny's bruised face as
          he's hoisted into the Rescue Vehicle, the doors slamming
          behind him.

          Johnny-2004 watches as the other paramedic stands and
          opens one of the medical supply cabinets --


          IN THE CABINET

          is Katy; she's crammed in and just barely fits inside;
          she looks scared and uncomfortable.  When the medical
          supply door closes, Johnny sees himself reflected in the
          glass --again horribly burned.

          Johnny, holding his head, blacks out momentarily, Rebecca
          catching him before he tips over.

                        Hey -- Johnny, you okay?

          Johnny shakes off the vision, pulling himself together.

                                        REBECCA

    38CONTINUED:38

          Johnny winces, in severe pain; a rivulet of blood trickles
          down from Johnny's eardrum onto his neck; just like a
          head trauma patient.  Rebecca finds a tissue and wipes
          off the blood.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My head feels like it's going to
                          explode.

                                        REBECCA
                        I'm worried about you.  Every
                        time you have a vision of that
                        night, it's taking more out of
                        you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have to keep going.  I have to.

                                        REBECCA
                          Johnny... I know how you must
                        feel.  You can't lose this little
                        girl.  You feel like you're the
                        only one who can save her.  Just
                        like you felt you could save
                        Rachel. 

          This lands with Johnny.  He knows she's right.  But it
          doesn't matter.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I should have saved her...

                                        REBECCA
                        You think you're alone in that
                          feeling?  You think a day goes by
                        that I don't beat myself up because
                          I wasn't there for her?  But the
                        truth is, despite your abilities,
                        you're just one man.  Maybe it's
                        not your visions causing these
                          symptoms, maybe it's this burden
                        you carry around with you.  This
                          enormous responsibility you've
                        taken on.  You can't save everyone
                        Johnny.

                        I just got off the phone with
                        Sarah.  She's very worried about

                        Thanks Walt, but it's not just
                        about Katy.  I have to find out
                        what happened that night for

  4040EXT. JOHNNY'S CRASH SITE - NIGHT

          The ambulance pulls to a stop by the side of the road;
          Johnny and Rebecca are exit the rear of the vehicle. 
          Rick joins them.

          It's an eerie night; anything could happen; a light fog
          hanging in the air evokes strangeness and uncertainty.

          Johnny is trepidatious: this is, after all, where the
          worst thing that ever happened to him, happened.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is it?

                        This is it.

          Just seeing the place, even nine years later, sends a
          chill through Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I never drive this way anymore.

                        three or four times after impact. 
                        It didn't look like anybody could
                          possibly have survived...

          Johnny tentatively walks to where Rick is pointing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Right here?

                        I'm sure of it.

          Johnny takes a beat to collect himself, looks to Rebecca
          for a dose of strength, then jabs his cane into the ground.

          his body as he tries to fight the flames consuming his
          flesh, but it's no use, the fire is too hot.  He tries to
          run, but falls to the ground, still on fire.          DEAD ZONE: COLLISION - ACT THREE - 2/16/04 - WHT-2    36.

          Rebecca and Rick watch as Johnny suffers from the unseen
          flames, then topples to the ground in a heap.  (Repeating
          the action of himself on fire so we can pick a cut point.)
          Once he collapses to the ground, Johnny lies perfectly
          still; no smoke, no flames, as if he never burned at all.

  4444EXT. JOHNNY'S CRASH SITE - 2004 - NIGHT

          Seconds after we left them last.  Johnny lies on the ground
            unconscious, with Rebecca kneeling at his side.  She feels
          for a pulse.

                                        REBECCA
                        I'm not feeling a pulse.

          Rebecca tips Johnny's head back to clear his airway, then
          begins CPR, first with two breaths, then chest
            compressions.

          She cradles Johnny's face, pausing before the next breath,
          their lips almost touching as she tries to communicate
          with whatever is left of Johnny's consciousness.

          abruptly comes to, eyes popping open, startling Rebecca
          as he suddenly sits up, coughing for air.  Rebecca
          reflexively throws her arms around him.

          Johnny soaks in the hug for a beat, getting his bearings. 
          Rick returns with his kit and a portable defibrillator.

                                        RICK

                        My whole body was on fire.

          Rick takes Johnny's pulse, checks his pupils.

                        No.  It's the vision.  I keep
                          reliving that night, but I can't

                        Maybe I can help you see what you
                        need to see without the pain.

                        How?

                                        REBECCA
                        Sometimes, the kids I work with
                        are crippled emotionally, stuck
                        from moving forward with their
                        lives by some trauma they've
                          repressed...  I try to help them
                          remember what happened, relive
                        the experience in a safe
                          environment so they can get past
                        it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can you help me remember that
                        night?  Guide me through it
                          somehow?

                        I don't know.  I can try.  First
                        let's get you back to the hospital.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  The answer is here.  I know
                        it.

                                        REBECCA
                        Fine.  I'll do it.  But first
                        sign of trouble and we go back.

          Off Johnny's nod...

                                                                                  CUT TO:

                        No.  I'm just giving you a

          Johnny takes one long last look into Rebecca's eyes, then
          closes his eyes.

                        you can, ignore your surroundings.

          Johnny nods yes.  Rebecca and Rick exchange a quick glance. 
          Rick has the defib paddles fired up -- he's ready too.

          Sitting together.  Rick is gone, it's as if they're the

                        I can tell you love her very much.

          Johnny suddenly reacts to something he sees, squeezing

          2004 leans down and peers into the wreck.

                                          JOHNNY-1995
                        Help me!
                                (then seeing Johnny-
                                2004)
                        Oh my God, I'm dead.  I've left
                        my body, I'm dead.

                                          JOHNNY-2004
                          No-no-no, you're not dead...
                        Wait... You can see me?

                                          JOHNNY-1995
                        I can't move my legs...

          Rebecca and Rick react, confused, watching Johnny on his
          knees, talking to his unseen self.

          Johnny-1995 starts to black out.

                                          JOHNNY-2004
                        It's okay.  I'm here now... You've
                        got to get out.  There isn't much
                        time.  The car's going to blow
                        up.  Unbuckle your seat belt.

          Johnny-1995 struggles to stay conscious -- to stay alive --
          He unbuckles his seat belt and drops the last few inches
          to the ground, but is still stuck.

                          I can't.  You have to do it
                          yourself.

                                          JOHNNY-1995
                        I can't move.  God it hurts.

                        Your left arm is still good. 
                        Pull it out. 

          Johnny-1995 struggles; extends his arm; pulls himself
          forward, letting out a ROAR of pain as he rips his injured
          leg free -- Johnny 2004 grabs his own leg, as if he too
          can feel the pain.

                                          JOHNNY-1995
                        My leg... I can't do this...

                                          JOHNNY-2004
                        Yes you can.   You have too much
                        to do.  Many lives are depending
                        on you.

                                          JOHNNY-2004
                        I can't do that... God knows I
                        wish I could... but it's just not
                        meant to be.

                                          JOHNNY-2004
                        Sorry, can't do that either...
                        but it's going to be okay.  We
                        have a huge job ahead of us. 
                        More than you and I could ever
                          imagine.  But, if you don't get
                        out of this car, you're going to
                        die, and me with you, and all the
                        people we're destined to save are
                        going to die, including a little
                        girl named Katy... So come on...

          Johnny-2004 reaches into the car --

          Johnny-1995 pulls his hand away from Johnny-2004.  Thick
          black smoke pours out of the hood of the Caddy; it's almost
          ready to blow.

                                          JOHNNY-2004

                        much to do.

            Johnny-1995, his leg crushed, uses every drop of strength
          left in his broken body to crawl away from the smoldering
            Cadillac; Johnny-2004 remains just out of reach -- yelling,
          coaching him every inch of the way.

                                          JOHNNY-2004

          gas tank and pools below.

          Johnny sees Katy's DAD hanging upside-down behind the
          wheel, unconscious.

          draws Johnny to the trunk.  He can hear Katy inside and
          sees her fingers clawing at a small opening.

  7777EXT. MILLIMAGASSET SOUTH DOCKS - DAWN

          Half a dozen rescue vehicles gather around the aftermath. 
          As Johnny and Rebecca watch the firemen mopping up from a
          safe distance, they fall silent, wondering what all this
          means.  After a beat an exhausted Walt approaches.

                                        WALT
                        Just heard from the hospital. 
                        Katy and her Dad are going to be
                          alright.

                                        REBECCA
                        So why was she in the trunk?  Was
                        he kidnapping her?

                                        WALT
                        No... she was mad at her mom and
                        wanted to go live with her dad,
                        so she climbed in the trunk when
                        they were arguing.  He never knew
                        she was there.

          Somebody calls Walt from off screen.

                                        WALT
                        I've got to go... Johnny?

          Johnny gets a bear hug from Walt.

                                        WALT
                        Another good day's work.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll send you my bill.

                                        WALT
                        Ms. Caldwell...

                                        REBECCA
                        Good night Sheriff.  Get some
                        rest.

          Johnny and Rebecca watch Walt go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        By the way, thanks.

                                        REBECCA
                        For what?

                                        JOHNNY
                        For saving my life... twice.

                                        REBECCA
                        Twice?  I only performed CPR once.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: COLLISION - ACT FOUR - 2/16/04 - WHT-2     55.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That was the first time.  The
                        second time was when you gave me
                        the strength to save myself.

                                        REBECCA
                        So you were the man you saw the
                        night of your accident?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I guess my first vision was of
                        myself.

                                        REBECCA
                                (what do you say?)
                          ...that's ...wow...
                                (thinks more)
                        How does...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're asking the wrong guy.

          Their eyes meet.  On an impulse, Rebecca kisses Johnny. 
          It's a small kiss, but it means a lot, and it catches
          Johnny off guard.

                                        REBECCA
                        Thank you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        For what?

                                        REBECCA
                        For being who you are.  For showing
                        me that good things can still
                        happen. 
                              (a beat)
                        After Rachel died, I wasn't sure
                        that was possible.

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (empathetic)
                        Come here.

          Their defenses long since abandoned to exhaustion, Rebecca
          puts her head against Johnny's chest as he wraps her in
          protective hug.  They watch the sun start to come up across
          the lake, neither of them knowing what lies ahead.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                        END OF ACT FOUR
