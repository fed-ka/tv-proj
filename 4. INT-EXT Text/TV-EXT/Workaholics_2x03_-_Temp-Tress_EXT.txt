      Anders tosses a book in the air and Blake chops at it with a 
      samurai sword.  This throws us into...

      QUICK POPS OF THE GUYS BEING  ENTERTAINED  BY BOOKS:

      1.  The guys jump-kick tall stacks of books.

      2.  Adam tries to rip a book in half with his bare hands.

      3.  Blake pitches Ders a book.  Ders hits it with a bat.

      4.  The guys strap fire-crackers to books.  A neighbor sees.

      5.  Adam tosses a flaming  book grenade  into a burning stack.

      END MONTAGE.

      Ders grabs a book. 

                                  DERS
                    I wanna do a book grenade!

      Adam torches the book and it accidentally catches onto 
      Blake s hair.  His hair LIGHTS ON FIRE.  He freaks out and 
      JUMPS OFF THE ROOF into the pool, extinguishing the fire.

                                  BLAKE
                    I m OK! 

                        DERSADAM
      We have to get a TV.That was awesome, I m next--

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      The guys are in the car.  Ders in the driver s seat, Adam in 
      shotgun, Blake in the back.  They hang jackets in the windows 
      and staple Ders  swim towels to create dividers for privacy. 

                                  DERS
                    OK, that should hold.  Let s make 
                    this quick.  I m pretty sure we can 
                    go to jail for this.

      Ders UNZIPS his pants to get ready.  Adam s got his shirt 
      behind his head like a shoulder yolk and is already cranking.

                                  ADAM
                    Yeah, Ders keep talking.   I need 
                    some sounds.  It s too quiet in 
                    here.

                                  DERS
                    I m not giving sounds.

                                  ADAM
                    That s perfect.

                                  DERS
                    SHHH!  

      Blake s foot jams through to the front as he pulls his pants 
      off.

                                  ADAM
                    Hey, stay in your space, dude!  We 
                    have designated Crank Zones.              Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         14.


      Blake s now completely naked, clothes hanging neatly behind 
      him.

                                  BLAKE
                    OK, sorry.  I ll stay in my Crank 
                    Zone.

      Ders starts to get in the mood when Adam s hand creeps in.

                                  ADAM
                          (fucking with Ders)
                    Ders, lemme get a handful of moob.  
                    Where them nips at?

                                  DERS
                    Dude, honestly, back off my 
                    titties!  Get back in your Zone!

                                  ADAM
                    I hate my Zone.  Blake can I come 
                    into your zone?

                                  BLAKE
                    No one s coming in my Zone except 
                    for me, muchacho.

                                  ADAM
                    Ders, are you done?  Pretty quiet 
                    in there?  What s happening?  Talk 
                    to me.  Want some of my lube, bro?

                                  DERS
                    I m fine.

                                  BLAKE
                    You got lube?  Pass me some.

                                  ADAM
                    Actually, it s Turtle Wax from the 
                    glove compartment.

      Adam passes the Wax.

                                  DERS
                    Just go dry.

                                  ADAM
                    Eww, you re a Dry Guy.  Did you 
                    also kill animals as a kid, Dexter?

                                  DERS
                    I just don t think jerking off 
                    should be some grand ritual.  It 
                    should be spontaneous.  A treat.              Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         15.


                                  BLAKE
                    Oh boy, this lube burnin  mah dick.  
                    Totally went in the pee hole.  Ders 
                    are you finished with this Gatorade 
                    back here?  Daddy s got to put out 
                    a fire.

                                  ADAM
                    Here we go.  So close.  Oh yeah.

      In the throes of passion Adam grips the curtain and pulls it 
      down.  All three guys are now visible to each other.  

                                  DERS
                    That s it!  I m outta here.

      Ders bolts out of the car covering himself and slams his door 
      into the neighboring car, setting the alarm off.  Smokers in 
      the parking lot stare.

      Adam s focus is lost.  He sees the smokers and gets out 
      buttoning his pants and belt.  Blake joins him, does the 
      same.

                                  ADAM
                    Well, there Ders goes again.  
                    Ruining our good time.

                                  BLAKE
                      Ruuuuuude!

      They pass the smokers.

                                  ADAM
                    Oh so you can take ten minutes to 
                    smoke, but we can t take ten 
                    minutes to stroke.  Crank down.

                                  BLAKE
                          (to a smoker)
                    That s a disgusting habit.

      FADE IN:


      Employees exit the building, leaving for the day.  Naomi 
      appears, heads to her car where the guys are posing-all-sexy-
      like with the fridge.

                                  NAOMI
                    Congrats on the fridge.                Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         28.


                                  BLAKE
                    Yeah, it s pretty...  cool.     

      Ders and Adam set the fridge up next to her car.

                                  DERS
                    Ummm... so like you like 
                      refrigerators, right?

                                  NAOMI
                    Yeah.   

                                  ADAM
                    Great.  Because we wanted to give 
                    this to you.  As a gift.  

                                  NAOMI
                          (confused but kinda 
                            excited)
                    Really?  Why?

                                  ADAM
                    Because you ve been throwing out 
                    super sex appeal all day and we saw 
                    that you date normal dudes, like us 
                    and Greg.

                                  BLAKE
                          (then, super sweet)
                    And we thought that maybe you liked 
                    one of us?

                                  DERS
                    So who do you choose? 

      They all make their sexiest faces and poses.  She s weirded 
      out. 

                                  NAOMI
                    I m sorry, I don t understand.

                                  BLAKE
                    Go ahead and pick one of us to be 
                    your boyfriend, so we can start 
                    planning for the Wrestlemania Party 
                    at your house.  

                                  DERS
                    I ll just need your neighbors  e-
                    mails to send them a heads up.  Let 
                    them know we ll be done by 10:30, 
                    so they don t freak out.              Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         29.


                                  BLAKE
                    We ve got some loud friends.

                                  NAOMI
                    What the hell are you talking 
                    about?    

      Suddenly Jillian enters, filled with rage.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Hey!  
                          (holding up frame)
                    I found this in the trash.  If you 
                    didn t want to be friends, you 
                    could have just been honest.

                                  NAOMI
                    I didn t put that in the trash. 

                                    JILLIAN
                    You put one thing in the trash:  
                    Our friendship. 

                                  NAOMI
                    We re not friends, Jill. 

                                    JILLIAN
                    It s Jillian.  
                          (re: fridge)
                    Are you guys giving this to her?  
                     Cause she ll just throw it in the 
                    trash because that s what she does 
                    with gifts!  So why don t I just 
                    trash it for her!

      Jillian furiously tips the fridge over on it s side, crushing 
      the TV.

                                  NAOMI
                    God I hate temping.

      Naomi climbs into her VW Bug and pulls out.  The guys and 
      Jillian watch her go.  Blake turns the fridge to reveal the 
      TV is shattered.

                                    JILLIAN
                    Drama queen.

                                  BLAKE
                    Thanks, Jillian.  Now what are we 
                    gonna do for Wrestlemania?              Workaholics - Temp-Tress - Network Draft - 1/6/11         30.



      The  Wrestlemania  party is going down.  People stand around 
      a makeshift wrestling ring where the dudes, wearing the same 
      homemade outfits as before, are wrestling each other using 
      found objects like folding chairs, lasagne tins, the broken 
      TV, books, and at the center - The Fridge/TV.  

      The dudes are in their own world.  The crowd is growing 
      tired.  Adam slams Blake and starts to climb the fridge.

      KARL comes from the crowd and taps Ders.

                                  KARL
                    Where s the TV?  I thought we were 
                    watching Wrestlemania.

                                  DERS
                    Don t you have a tape worm you 
                    could be pulling from your ass 
                      somewhere?

      Adam reaches the top of the fridge and slaps his arms (like 
      Randy The Ram in The Wrestler) and in mid-Ram Jam we...

                                                                   CUT TO BLACK.
