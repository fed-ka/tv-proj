      A silent, frozen night. We are drawn as in a nightmare - down 
      a lane signposted to: DEVIL S DITCH... Past half-built houses 
      and dormant earth moving vehicles. Everything iced over... A 
      white feather flutters on the ground... Down into the 
      building site... 

      To the black trough of the foundations. We glimpse: in the 
      very bottom amongst the rusting rods embedded in concrete - 
      the lovely head, shoulders and wing of A DEAD ANGEL.

      Rain sluices across the windscreen. Sparks on the radio:

      A stuffed holdall on the back seat. A black jacket sways from 
      a hook. 5 inch lapels. An old wrist watch on the dash. Fag

      Eddie gets out at the foot of the embankment. The black sky 
      beyond the embankment is filled with orange smoke and 
      sparks... 

      Eddie clambers to the top of the embankment. He looks down 
      into the basin of Hunslet Carr. He looks down into hell. 1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      16
                   


      Below, a gypsy camp is on fire. Caravans and trailers blaze. 
      GYPSY MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN are trapped amongst the flames, 
      ringed by POLICE IN RIOT GEAR. Screams of terror, engine 
      roars and heat. The police rhythmically bang their shields 
      with truncheons. They move in on the trapped gypsies. They 
      charge. Bones are broken. Flesh ripped. 

      A tiny 10 YEAR OLD GYPSY GIRL stands screaming amid the 
      satanic fury.

      Eddie hides again in bushes. He sees: OFFICERS - including 
      SERGEANT BOB CRAVEN - ginger bearded and carnivorous - and a 
      short arse - CONSTABLE TOM DOUGLAS. Also DETECTIVE SERGEANTS *
      JIM PRENTICE and DICK ALDERMAN - greased blonde hair, *
      moustache and sideburns. All smoking and drinking and 
      laughing. Illuminated by the flames of hell. At their centre 
      is Detective Chief Superintendent Bill Molloy. Molloy looks 
      up. Eddie buries his face in the mud. 



      Eddie driving. Heater and radio on - the missing girl story 
      growing on National. Peering out at the dark world: PEOPLE

      Britain?  

      Eddie pauses at the traffic lights. Across the street is 
      MORLEY GRANGE JUNIOR AND INFANTS SCHOOL. KIDS come out, 
      laughing and screeching. Eddie stares...

      He sees CLARE KEMPLAY. Red kagool, red Wellington boots, Co-

      at him across the street.

      Clare begins to skip along the road. Going home. Eddie drives 
      slowly - keeping pace with her. Traffic horns blare. Clare 
      pauses on the corner, waving at Eddie. 

      Eddie signals to turn up the road. A car angrily roars past 
      him. Screamed abuse. Clare s little figure vanished.



      Eddie drives up Winterbourne Avenue. A cul-de-sac of mixed 
      old and new semis. He pauses - looks across to: A POLICEMAN 
      stands on duty outside number 3. Mrs. Kemplay is at the 
      window, staring vacantly out, waiting in vain for her 
      daughter to return home. She never will. 



      Eddie drives the Viva - exits the motorway and into Rochdale.

      Eddie leaves his car. It s a quiet street. Over the road are 
      spanking new houses: A DAWSON UK DEVELOPMENT. Eddie goes to 
      the front door of a semi opposite. Rings the bell... 

      An ancient missing poster of Susan Ridyard - smiling against 
      blue skies and fluffy clouds - is taped inside the window. 
      Eddie s drawn by her smiling eyes... A NEIGHBOUR looks out.

      Eddie drives the Viva through the rundown mining town - under 
      the daubed iron bridge: FUCK FITZWILLIAM, FUCK THE IRA. Into 
      the rundown mining town. The pit wheel, terraced houses, 
      burned out bus stops and closed-down shops...

      Standing at the road side, a car exhaust pipe in his hands, 
      is a SIMPLE MAN in overalls. He stares at Eddie as he passes. *
      His name is JOHN MYSHKIN.*

      Off Newstead View is a cul-de-sac that ends at the foot of a 
      great grassed-over slag heap. Netherton Close. Allotments, 
      abandoned cars, sheds and caravans dot the slope. Ponies, 
      rusting tractors, white vans, packs of dogs. KIDS play 
      amongst the piles of scrap metal. Beyond are the bleak Moors.



      Eddie looks around. A GANG OF BOYS watch him whilst absently 
      smashing an abandoned car. Eddie heads for number 7. A neat 
      lawn. Empty garage. 

      The door is opened by a hard beauty in her late 30s.

      A gentle, commanding voice from inside the dark house:

                    Mary. It s all right. Go fetch your 
                    son.

      MARTIN LAWS. A tough, lean man in his early 40s. Shirt 
      sleeves, muddy boots and dog collar. Watchful and 
        uncompromising.

      Eddie and Leonard tramp through a dense drizzle to stand on 
      the rim of the building foundations. No work going on. 
      WORKMEN watching from the shelter of a half-built house. 
      Martin Laws and Mrs. Cole stand together a little way off,

      Eddie crouches and picks up a single white feather. He stares

      They drive up a dark, leafy lane lined with high walls. Fairy 
      lights are strung in the trees... 

      A big house comes into view. Uber 70s bungalow chic. A sign:

      Eddie goes to a red door in a row of pre-war houses. A woman 
      in her early 30s answers - thin, bruised-beautiful. PAULA 
      GARLAND. She takes Eddie s breath for a second.

                    Jeanette.



      The red door is slammed in Eddie s face. Eddie turns to the 
      street. Opposite are more recent semis and a sign: A DAWSON 
      UK DEVELOPMENT. He senses everyone watching him. A WOMAN with 
      a pram gawps. Eddie grabs his crotch at her. 



      Eddie and Barry head across the car park.

                    Dawson did his National Service in

                    taped the screams. For fun.

      A screech of tyres. Eddie turns: A police car comes racing 
      off the road and swerves to a halt in the car park. TWO 
      POLICEMEN get out. Tommy Douglas and Bob Craven.

      Craven grabs Eddie. Spins him round. Slams his face against 
      the Viva. Holds him by his neck. 

                                  EDDIE

      Craven runs his finger between Eddie s cheeks and pushes it 
      up his arse.

                    It s not nice, is it.

      Craven kisses Eddie on the cheek.



      Paula Garland walks through the deserted streets like a 
      ghost. Everything around her is frozen and silent. 



      Eddie smokes and waits in his car opposite Paula s house. No 
      lights on. Then in the mirror he sees Paula s figure emerge 
      out of the dark. He ditches the fag. 

      Paula pauses - as if sensing the air. Eddie scrunches himself 
      down in the seat... 

      Paula turns lets herself in through the red door.

      No lights come on. But Eddie watches her come to stand at the 
      window, smoking a cigarette. Very blonde. Very pale. 

      Does she know he s watching her?1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      37
                   



      Eddie crosses to the house. He can see Paula inside. The glow 
      of her cigarette... She turns to look at him through the 
      glass... He puts his hand against the front door. It s off 
      the catch...



      Eddie drives slowly down Victoria Road. He slows as he 
      approaches the junction. Police tape streams from the lamp 
      post. A sign: FATAL ACCIDENT. A plea for information. Smashed 
      green glass has been swept into a heap.



      Eddie stares at pile of smashed glass. A young, very friendly 
      sergeant - BOB FRASER - comes up to him - shakes hands. Eddie 
      is immediately suspicious.

                                  BOB FRASER
                    Sergeant Bob Fraser. Thanks for 
                    coming, Mr. Dunford... I know you 
                    were friends.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      39
                   


                                  EDDIE
                    Yeah. Is it true the van was 
                    carrying plates of glass?

                                  BOB FRASER 
                    Yes.

                                  EDDIE
                    And one went through the 
                      windscreen...?

                                  BOB FRASER
                    Yes. 

                                  EDDIE
                    So, you reckon it was 
                      instantaneous?

                                  BOB FRASER
                    I d say so, sir, yes.

                                  EDDIE
                    Fuck.

                                  BOB FRASER
                    Yeah... I understand you last saw 
                    Mr. Gannon in the Shakespeare 
                    Public House... Would you say he 
                    was drinking heavily?

                                  EDDIE
                    I think he had a half. Pint at the 
                    most.

                                  BOB FRASER
                    And you ve no idea where he went 
                    from there?

                                  EDDIE
                    No.

                                  BOB FRASER
                    No idea why he might have come to 
                    Morley?

                                  EDDIE
                    None... It s a strange one...

                                  BOB FRASER 
                    I see... We almost have all the 
                    details, sir. There ll be an 
                    inquest tomorrow...

                                  EDDIE
                    Bit quick, isn t it?1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      40
                   


                                  BOB FRASER
                    I think the family are keen to, you 
                    know, get it all sorted... 

                                  EDDIE
                    Right.

                                  BOB FRASER
                    If anything occurs to you, I can be 
                    reached through the Morley police 
                    station.

                                  EDDIE
                    Thanks... 
                          (appraises Fraser)
                    You re one of the good ones, aren t 
                    you, sergeant?

                                  BOB FRASER
                    I do my best, sir. Not good copy, 
                    is it.

                                  EDDIE
                    Not really.

      Eddie stares across the street, the world fading. Through the 
      traffic:

      Clare Kemplay in her red kagool waves at Eddie...

      Eddie s car is parked on the hard shoulder, door open, radio 
      on. The radio plays.  What Becomes of the Broken Hearted? . *
      The same music Eddie heard when he was approaching the *
      burning Gypsy camp earlier: *1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      41
                   


       As I walk this land with broken dreams / I have visions of *
      many things...  *

      Eddie stands on the embankment. The busy motorway on one 
      side, the wasteland on the other. Like a sentinel. Caught 
      between worlds. Below him is the circle of burned out *
      caravans and scorched earth where the encampment was razed. 
      SURVEYORS in hard hats measure out the land. Above Eddie is a 
      hoarding: A DAWSON UK DEVELOPMENT. A SHOPPING CENTRE FOR 
      HUNSLET CARR. 

                                  BARRY V/O
                      Everything s linked... Show me two 
                    things that aren t...



      Eddie watches through a long lensed camera. He s across from 
         Shangrila . Eddie snaps; the front door, a figure at a 
      window, the red Jaguar in the drive. A curtain twitches at a 
      window... 

      A second, then the Jason King Moustache comes out down the 
      drive with a cricket bat in his hand. The gates open... 

      Eddie spins the wheel and is out of there fast.  



      Crash! The Nursing Manager slams the front door. Eddie 
      dragged backwards by his hair. Shoes coming off. Hands 
      scraped on the gravel. 

      Eddie twists round. Ribs and hips scraping across the ground 
      now. His Vauxhall Viva rapidly approaching his face. Crack! 
      Straight into it.

      The Viva s door is swung open. His arm held out. His grasping 
      hand. The door slammed on it. Fuck! And again. Eddie s watch 
      smashes to smithereens.

      Blackness.



      Eddie pulls up beside a lorry in the forecourt of the new, 
      long red brick building with pitched roof. 

      Eddie gets out. Looks around. Quiet. He pulls his black bin 
      liners out of the car and heads for the motel...  



      Eddie drifts towards "Shangrila . Candles burn at the 
      windows. The door opens for him. 



      Eddie smokes outside the Chapel of Rest. MOURNERS file out, 
      draw coats round themselves, put up umbrellas, spark up. 

                                  GEORGE GREAVES
                    Good piece by Hadley, wasn t it? 

                                  EDDIE
                    Bit on the panegyric side I 
                    thought.

                                  GEORGE GREAVES
                    Oh, aye... s pose... Barry would ve 
                      appreciated it...

                                  EDDIE
                    I doubt it.

      Eddie sees BJ s skinny figure. He s watching from a long way 
      off. BJ clocks Eddie watching him, turns away and vanishes 
      from sight...

      Eddie heads for his Viva... He stops short. Leaning against a 
      red Jaguar parked alongside is Dawson s henchman, Jason King *
      Moustache. Trouble. Jason pulls Eddie s hand off his car door *
      handle. A big solid man emerges from the red Jag. JOHN 
      DAWSON.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Come for a spin in the Jag, Mr. 
                    Dunford?

                                  EDDIE
                    And why would I want to do that?1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      55
                   


                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    I was a great admirer of your late 
                      colleague. Such a waste...
                          (sticks out a paw)
                    John Dawson. 

      Eddie glances back at the SUITS emerging from the chapel.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Fuck the Press Club wake, eh?
                          (Eddie shakes his paw)
                    Champion.



      Eddie sits in the back of the Jag with John Dawson. Jason 
      King drives. DAWSON S DRIVER follows in Eddie s car. Down the 
      Bradford Road: black bricks, saris, BROWN BOYS playing 
      cricket in the cold. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    This nation s in fucking chaos with 
                    it s hung parliaments. A year ago 
                    they were going to bring back 
                      rationing. Now we got inflation at 
                    fucking 25 per cent! The country s 
                    at war, Mr. Dunford. 

      Everything run-down, closed, obsolete. John Dawson sighs at 
      it all - continues his running commentary on the world of 
      Yorkshire 1974 that drifts past.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    The government and the unions, the 
                    Left and the Right, the rich and 
                    the poor. Then you got your enemies 
                    within; your Paddys, your wogs, 
                    your niggers, your Gypos, the puffs 
                    and the perverts, even the bloody 
                    women. They re all out for what 
                    they can get. Soon there ll be nowt 
                    left for us lot. Time to turn the 
                    tide...

                                  EDDIE
                    Not a Labour man, then.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Course I bloody am! Tory cunts have 
                      out-priced themselves. Your Labour 
                    man will always do a deal. 

                                  EDDIE
                    Like the West Yorkshire Police...

      Eddie, playing poker. Dawson calling his bluff.1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      56
                   


                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Trouble with your generation is you 
                    know nowt. You lot never fought a 
                    bloody war. I did my National 
                    Service protecting fat cunts like 
                    what I am now fighting the fucking 
                    Mau Maus! 

                                  EDDIE
                    I heard the stories. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Yeah? Well they re all true. 
                    Including the bit about cutting off 
                    cocks. It was Cowboys and Indians. 
                    Like now. 



      The red Jag followed by Eddie s Viva approaches a large 
      detached building. A sign over the former textile factory: 
      THE KARACHI SOCIAL CLUB. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Do you know the Karachi? It s a 
                    place where men can talk. A 
                      businessman like myself and an 
                    officer of the law can get together 
                    in a less formal setting so to 
                    speak. 

      They pull over opposite the Karachi Club with Eddie s car 
      behind. They get out. 

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    You going to continue our late 
                    friend s crusade against local 
                      corruption, Mr. Dunford?

                                  EDDIE
                    What makes you ask that?

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    Me and Barry had a very special 
                      relationship most of the time. 
                    Mutually beneficial it was.  

                                  EDDIE
                    In what way?

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    I m in the fortunate position to be 
                    able to occasionally pass on 
                      information that comes my way. 
                    Certain officials sticking their

                    Like the cut?

      Dawson shows him the label:  Dunford s .

                    Top man, your father. Knew how to 
                    cut his cloth. Solid. Dependable. 
                    Earned bugger all, mind... 

      Dawson puts his big mitt on Eddie s shoulder.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    That s not you, is it, Mr. Dunford? 
                    You re more like me. We like to 
                    fuck and make a buck and we re not 
                    right choosey how. Isn t that 
                    right? Drop by Saturday lunchtime. 
                    I got something might interest you.

      Dawson heads towards the Karachi Club with Jason King. He *
      pauses - turns back.

                                  JOHN DAWSON
                    And, Mr. Dunford? My wife is a very 
                    unwell woman. Speak to her again 
                    and it won t be your hand that gets 
                    smashed.

      The driver who took Eddie s car tosses the keys at him and 
      follows the big man and Jason King. Eddie is left with his *
      Viva.



      Eddie out into the evening. Lights coming on. Shadows filling *
      corners. He hears a light voice singing  Ashes to Ashes . He *
      sees a slight figure waiting in the alley. It s BJ clutching *
      a Hillard s carrier bag.*

      Eddie, under the iron bridge - through the crumbling mining 
      town. 



      Eddie pulls over. He walks down the gloomy road. Past closed, 
      cramped front rooms. Black moors stretch beyond. Number 66 
      has been wrecked. Eddie heads through the rubbish strewn 
      garden. 



      Eddie gets to the doorway. A THIRD BOY blocks his way, 
      playing with a washing line noose. Behind him, the first boy 
      starts hacking at the wall with his hammer. 

                                  BOY 3

                    That s enough, boys.

      Martin Laws heads for Eddie from across the street. A TIRED 
      MUM is with him.

      The tired mum grabs one of the boys.

                    his life. Who s to say how he d 
                    turn out...

      They look off across the allotments and the Moors beyond into 
      the gathering darkness. Laws takes Eddie by the arm.

      Eddie emerges into the silent street. Far away down the road, 
      Paula s figure dissolves into the darkness...1974.TG.170808                      Locked Draft - 1st Revision      70
                   



      Paula walks through the night. Expressionless, moving like a 
      sleepwalker...

      Eddie following. An oncoming car s headlights illumines her 
      up ahead. A ghostly white figure that flits away down a 
      lane...

      Eddie knows this place...



      Eddie follows Paula s figure up a dark, leafy lane lined with 
      high walls. Fairy lights are strung in the trees... 

      Eddie watches Paula buzz the gated grounds of the luxurious 
      bungalow.  Shangrila ... He watches her slip through and head 
    up to the house. The gates swing closed after her. 



      Eddie parks up outside: THE KARACHI SOCIAL CLUB. He gets out - 
      heads for the restaurant and club.



      Eddie in the fast lane. Putting distance between him and 
      Dawson. Radio full up:  Tubular Bells . The Castleford 
      turning looms out of the murky day. Eddie swerves across 
      three lanes of traffic. Horns blare. 



      Eddie pulls up. Gets out. The house is in darkness. 
      Something s wrong...

      Eddie tries the door. No one answers. It s locked.



      Eddie cruises up the dark, leafy lane. He rounds a bend. 
      Glimmering lights loom ahead. 



      Eddie parks up amongst the Jags and Mercs and BMWs. He gets 
      out and heads for the illuminated facade of "Shangrila".

      Eddie waves Paula s invite at the TWO FLUNKIES on the gates 
      and walks up the floodlit drive. Ice underfoot. The windows 
      are ablaze with golden light. WOMEN IN EVENING GOWNS and MEN 
      IN TUXEDOS drift around inside. Drinking. Laughing. Chatting. 
      Strains of Johnny Mathis.



      Eddie is dragged out of the house, down the drive towards the 
      gates. Fireworks explode in the sky.

      A black police van and an unmarked car roar to a halt at the 
      end of the drive. TEN POLICEMEN emerge. Some armed. Including 
      Dick Alderman and Jim Prentice. Hands reach out for Eddie... 
      The police hurl him into the black van, then jump in with 
      him. The doors slam to.

    A black sack is pulled off Eddie s head. He s kneeling at the 
      open back doors of the van. Craven and Douglas hold him. The 
      van tears down the country road. Craven takes out a Smith and *
      Wesson handgun. Douglas hands him bullets.*

      Craven checks the gun. He points it at Eddie s head again. 
      Eddie pisses himself. There s a huge explosion. Eddie opens 
      his eyes. It was a blank. Craven and Douglas guffaw. Then 
      Craven gives him a big hug.

      loads the Smith and Wesson. Then he shoves the gun into *
      Eddie s pocket. The smiles vanish.

      They kick him out. And Eddie falls... and falls...



      CRACK! Eddie s head hits the tarmac. The van disappears off.

      Eddie lies in the road in a heap. His legs move. He starts to 
      stand. Falls over. Stands again. Like a broken puppet. A car 
      heads for him - swerves to a halt inches away. 

      A WOMAN DRIVER leans down to Eddie. He looks at her hair *
