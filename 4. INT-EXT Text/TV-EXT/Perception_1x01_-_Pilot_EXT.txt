A crisp fall day.  Ivied walls.  Students hustling to class.

PIERCE (V.O.)
What is reality?


Pierce moves across the quad at a clip, oblivious to the path 
ahead.  Lewicki, with an armful of textbooks and newspapers, 
tries to keep up.  Lewicki makes Pierce nuts... or keeps him 
from going nuts.  Whichever it is, Pierce couldn t live 
without Lewicki.  But he d never admit it.

LEWICKI
Faculty meeting s at noon, book 
signing at two, so I ll pick you up 
one of those veggie wraps you like. 
You can scarf it down in between. 
You know how you get when you don t 
eat --

PIERCE
Lewicki.  

LEWICKI
Yeah?

PIERCE
Room and board in exchange for some 
light housekeeping does not make 
you my mother. 

LEWICKI
Just trying to look out for you, 
Doc.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/094.    


PIERCE
Do you have my puzzles?

As Lewicki fumbles with his stack of materials --

LEWICKI
Trib, Chronicle, Daily Mail --

STIMULUS PACKAGE (O.S.)
Professor Pierce?

They turn to see Stimulus Package and a FEMALE CLASSMATE 
catching up.  Stimulus Package smiles, flirty.

STIMULUS PACKAGE (CONT D)
I was wondering if I could buy you 
a latte.

And now we may notice something else about Pierce.  Unlike 
when he s in his classroom element, he s a little 
uncomfortable around people one-on-one and avoids making 
direct eye contact.  

PIERCE
I don t drink coffee.

STIMULUS PACKAGE
Oh.  Well, it doesn t have to be 
coffee.  I just want to, you 
know... pick your brain... about my 
thesis topic.

A beat.  Pierce forces himself to glance up at her.  

PIERCE
Here s the thing, Miss...?

STIMULUS PACKAGE
Karyn.

Pierce looks down again, takes a deep breath.  Though he is 
compulsively, brutally blunt, he s trying, without much 
success, to sound polite. 

PIERCE
 Discussing your thesis topic  is 
obviously code for sex.  And while 
we might both enjoy that very 
much... it could also get me fired.  
So I m going to regretfully decline 
your invitation.

And with that, Pierce walks away. 

FEMALE CLASSMATE
Pig.

CLASSICAL MUSIC takes us...

CLOSE ON A NEWSPAPER       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/095.    


Folded open to a half-finished CROSSWORD PUZZLE.  A pen flies 
across the page, filling in squares as fast as a human hand 
can write.  We are...


...where Pierce sits on a bench, his right hand filling in 
the puzzle while his left  conducts  the symphony he s 
listening to through old school headphones... attached to a 
WALKMAN, that cassette-playing relic of the Reagan era.  
Pierce fills in the last square, slides another puzzle into 
his lap and goes to work on it without missing a beat.  

ROSSI (O.S.)
Geoffrey.

But he can t hear the voice.  A HAND taps Pierce on the 
shoulder.  Slightly startled, he looks up to see 

KATE ROSSI,

early 30s, sexy without trying, sharp-tongued, street smarts 
backed up by a first rate education.  Pierce recognizes her, 
takes off his headphones, says simply:

PIERCE
Kate Rossi.

ROSSI
You d be a lot easier to find if 
you carried a cell phone. 

PIERCE
If I carried a cell phone, the 
government could track me.

ROSSI
I am the government.

PIERCE
My point exactly.

She smiles, but he s not really joking.  As we ll come to 
learn, Pierce is also something of a conspiracy theorist. 

PIERCE (CONT D)
I thought you were at Quantico.

ROSSI
Got my old desk back.  

PIERCE
Isn t that a demotion?

Kate knows him well enough to understand he s not trying to 
be rude, just genuinely curious.  But she doesn t answer.

ROSSI
Do you have a few minutes?       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/096.    


CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH

of a DEAD MAN, 40s, eyes open, lying in a pool of BLOOD.

ROSSI (O.S.) (CONT D)
His name is Bob Weilman...


The glass and steel nerve center of Big Pharma. 


An N.D. GOVERNMENT SEDAN pulls up to the curb.


He grabs onto the telescoping LADDER, SLAMS the latch, hangs 
on as it RATCHETS DOWN, drops the last foot, stumbles, falls.

ABOVE HIM

Kate is now out on the landing and sees May scrambling to his 
feet, getting ready to run.  And she realizes there s only 
one way to close the distance -- she LEAPS off the balcony!  

IN THE N.D SEDAN

Pierce sees Kate hurtle out of the sky and SLAM Timothy hard 
to the ground.  What the fuck?   He scrambles out of the car, 
hurries over to where Kate is now cuffing her suspect, pulls 
off his headphones. 

PIERCE
Are you alright?

ROSSI
Fine.

PIERCE
If you want my professional 
diagnosis, jumping off a second 
story fire escape is what we 
commonly call  crazy. 

Kate hauls the suspect to his feet, smiles at Pierce.

ROSSI
I guess that makes two of us.

OFF Pierce --


END OF ACT ONE       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0918.    


ACT TWO


Police lights FLASH.  Valerie Nelson, hooked to oxygen and an 
IV, is loaded into the back of an AMBULANCE.  Agent Probert 
exchanges a few quick words with a PARAMEDIC, who then pulls 
the ambulance doors closed as Rossi and Pierce approach.

PROBERT
Vicious blow like that to the back 
of the head.  She might not even 
have seen her attacker.

ROSSI
They think she s going to make it?

PROBERT
Too early to say.
(rankled)
Why are we still on this case?  
Chicago PD should be handling it.

Rossi ignores that, hands him a plastic evidence bag 
containing a CELL PHONE.

ROSSI
Find out who s she been talking to.


Valerie greets Bob Weilman with a passionate kiss, slips him 
the tablets.  Bryant watches from his car down the street.

BRYANT (V.O.)
...she brought them to Bob.  She 
goes to a lawyer, instead of me?


As Hammond helps the handcuffed Bryant into the back of a 
SQUAD CAR --

PIERCE (O.S.)
Doctor Bryant!

Bryant turns.  Hammond is exasperated --

DETECTIVE HAMMOND
What now?

But Pierce ignores him, eyes Bryant.

PIERCE
You said you figured out why 
Insulprin was causing heart 
attacks.  What was it?

Bryant looks at him a beat.  Why s he asking this?

BRYANT
The drug depleted patients  
thiamine levels...  

As the light bulb goes on for Pierce, Rossi catches up.

ROSSI
Geoffrey, what s going on?

He turns to her, and says simply:

PIERCE
There s another victim. 
CUT TO BLACK:


END OF ACT FOUR       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0951.    


ACT FIVE


A gorgeous afternoon.  Pierce and Natalie sit in on the bench 
talking and laughing.

PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
And if we re able to treat the 
people who suffer from these 
neurological disorders... 

Consumed by his conversation with Natalie, Pierce doesn t 
notice Lewicki approaching.  At the sight of Pierce, Lewicki 
stops, smiles to himself, shakes his head.  

PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
...restore them to quote normalcy, 
are we only doing them good? 

And now from LEWICKI S POV we see that in actuality,

PIERCE IS SITTING ALONE,

animatedly talking to himself... because NATALIE IS NOT REAL.

PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
Or might we sometimes also be 
stripping away what makes them 
unique...   

As students pass by, paying no mind to the idiosyncratic 
professor, Lewicki approaches, sits in THE EMPTY SPOT next to 
Pierce.  As Pierce reacts to that, Lewicki reaches into his 
satchel, hands Pierce a cassette.  And as they exchange a few 
words --

PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
...robbing them of an essential 
part of who they are?

Pierce puts the cassette in his Walkman.  And as Lewicki gets 
up and walks away, CAMERA CRANES UP on Pierce, alone, 
listening to his music --

FADE TO BLACK.
