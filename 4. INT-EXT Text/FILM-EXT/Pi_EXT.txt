Max watches people bustle through the busy intersections of
Chinatown. The streets are clogged with people.
MAX (V.O.)
Somewhere in there.
Somewhere. I know it's right
in front of me. The pattern.
They say it's chaos, it can't
be understood, too much
complexity.
Max scavenges electronic parts as he carefully navigates an
endless dump for old and rotting computers.
MAX (V.O.)
History it's there.
Lurking, shaping.
structuring, hiding, right
beneath the surface.
He unscrews a random IBM Board from a keyboard and slides it
into his pocket.

bench.
MAX (V.0.)
The cycling of disease epidemics,
the wax and wane of Caribou populations

the rise and fall of the

Bright stock quotes drift across the screen.
MAX (V.O.)
I'll find this structure,
this order, this perfection.
door.
A few moments pass, and then SOL ROBESON opens the door.
Sol is a wise-looking man in his early 70's. He walks with
difficulty, leaning out of breath on a wooden cane.
His arms are covered with faded Russian prison tattoos and he
speaks with a thick Eastern European accent, He's happy to see
Max.
S0L
Max! How are you7
Max is happy to see Sol, but he's a bit bashful and
intimidated.
MAX Okay.
TIGHT ON the Japanese game of Go being played. Sol is white
and Max is black. Sol's moves are secure and controlled while
Max is hesitant.
SOL
Stop thinking, Max, just
feel. Use your intuition.
It's the only way to get into
the flow.
(Beat)
What did you think of Hamlet?
MAX
I didn't get to it.
SOL
It's been a month.
(Knowingly)
You haven't taken
a single break.
MAX
I'm so close, Sol. I'm
so close but I just can't
grab it.
Sol changes the subject. He feeds his goldfish and points to
one of them.
SOL
Have you met the new
fish my niece bought me? I
named her Icarus. After you.
My renegade pupil. You fly
too high, you'll get burned.
Max looks up at Sol.
SOL
The more I see you, the
more I see myself thirty
years ago. My greatest pupil.
Published at 16, Ph.D. at 20.
MAX
We'll see.
SOL
But life isn't just
mathematics. I spent forty
years looking for patterns in
Pi, I found nothing.
MAX
You found things...
SOL
I found things, but not a
pattern.
TIGHT ON a tree branch shaking manically in the wind.
Max sits on a park bench watching the branch shake. It
terrifies him.
He pulls out the printout of his picks and examines them.
MAX (V.0.)
Wednesday, September third,
seven-fifteen. Results: AAR
at fourteen and a halflow,
very low. ABR at six and a
halfjeez. Six and a half, ABR
hasn't been beneath twenty in
ten years. Conclusion:
Simple. There is no pattern.
No pattern. Chaos, chaos, all
chaos.
He crumples up his picks and tosses them into a public trash
can.
He seems to have lost him, when he notices a business-woman
with a pretty face heading right toward him. It is MARCY
DAWSON.
MARCY DAWSON
Mr. Cohen! Perfect timing.
Marcy sticks out her hand. Max, not knowing what else to do,
shakes it.
MARCY DAWSON
I was just waiting for you.
I thought you stood me up,
so I was going to head home.
MAX
Who are you?
MARCY DAWSON
Oh...Marcy Dawson. From
Lancet Percy. We were
supposed to meet at three.
MAX
I'm sorry, I don't...
Marcy hasn't let go of Max's hand.
She guides him toward a large black street limo that's just
pulled up.
MARCY DAWSON
I can't tell you what a
pleasure it is to finally
meet you. I've studied
your papers for years.
MARCY DAWSON
I have something
you won't be able to say no
to. Why don't we take a spin
in the limo?
MAX
No, no, no, really, I
can't.
MARCY DAWSON
We're excited by your work.
We can't wait to discuss...
Max attempts to pull away but Marcy is firm on leading him to
the car. Meanwhile, the Shinny man is heading right at them.
The CHAUFFEUR reaches out to him. Max yanks his arm free and
runs away. He whips around a corner.
Max scouts his front door. The coast is clear.
Max sifts through the trash can where he threw his picks from
yesterday. Frustrated, he dumps the trash onto the sidewalk
and starts looking through it Mrs. Ovadia watches him.
Max sees her and is embarrassed for a moment.
MAX
I just threw out something.
I didn't realize I needed it.
MRS. OVADIA
Humph.
MAX
Just a printout. I, uh,
lost my data...
Max looks back at the trash And forgets about Mrs. Ovadia.
Soon, Max gets up and kicks the trashcan. He heads home.
IN FRONT OF MAX'S APARTMENT BUILDING
Max watches Marcy get out of the limo and call to Mrs. Ovadia.
Max backs away when he smacks into someone.
It's Lenny Meyer - the young Jewish man.
Max jumps back in fear.
LENNY MEYER
Max! How you doing? Lenny
Meyer.
MAX
Oh, hey...
Max tries to quickly pass him.
LENNY MEYER
Hey, where you going? You
got a few moments to do Tefillin?
Max turns around and notices Marcy talking to Mrs. Ovadia.
Mrs. Ovadia points up the street
toward him.
LENNY MEYER
I gotta car, we can cruise
over to my...
MAX
You gotta car?
LENNY MEYER
Yeah, right there. That's
Ephraim, my friend.
We swing around with Max and see a station wagon.
EPHRAIM sits in the passenger Seat. He's a big-boned, bearded,
Orthodox Jew.
MAX
All tight, lets go.
LENNY MEYER
Great...
They head for the station wagon.
Max firmly rings SOL's bell.
In a few moments, Sol answers the door in his pajamas.
SOL
Max?
MAX
What's going on, Sol!?
SOL
Relax, it's early.
Max rushes to the subway when a honking horn stops him. A limo
pulls up next to him. Marcy Dawson jumps out of the car
MARCY DAWSON
Mr. Cohen? Mr.
Cohen? Please stop for a
second Mr. Cohen?
Max stops and faces Marcy.
MAX
Damn it already! Stop
following me. I'm not
interested in your money. I'm
searching for a way to
understand our world. I'm
searching for perfection. I
don't deal with mediocre
materialistic people like
you!
MARCY DAWSON
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
I admit I've been a bit too
aggressive. But all I ask is
for five minutes of your time.
Here...
Marcy hands Max a metal stopwatch.
MARCY DAWSON
...a stopwatch.
Already ticking. Allow me the
four and a half minutes left
Let me tell you what I want.
Let me tell you what I can
offer you. Afterwards, if you
don't want to talk to me, then
fine, we part as friends and
I promise that you will never
see me again. That's fair,
isn't it?
MAX
(After a moment, he looks at the stopwatch)
Go.
MARCY DAWSON
Good. It's funny,
even though we have different
aims and different goals
we're actually incredibly
alike. We both seek the same
thingperfection. I know...
clearly we're seeking
different types of
perfection, but that is what
makes us perfect candidates
for a fruitful partnership.
If you let me, I can be your
greatest ally. Take the
acacia tree...in East
Africa. It is the most
prevalent plant in all of
Kenya because it has managed
to secure its niche by
defeating its major predator,
the giraffe. To accomplish
this, the tree has made a contract
with a highly specialized red ant.
The tree has evolved giant spores which
act as housing for the ants
In return for shelter, the
ants supply defense. When a
giraffe starts to eat the
tree's leaves, the shaking
branch acts like an alarm. The
ants charge out and secrete an
acid onto the giraffe's
tongue. The giraffe learns its
lesson and never returns.
Without each other, the tree
would be picked dry and the
ants would have no shade from
the brutal African sun Both
would die. But with each
other, they succeed, they survive,
they surpass. They have
different aims, different
goals but they work together.
Max, we would like to establish
a mutually benefiting alliance
with you.
MAX
(handing back the stopwatch)
I'm not interested.
MARCY DAWSON
Allow me to dose.
The chauffeur pulls a black suitcase out of the limo and
brings it over.
MARCY DAWSON
As a sign of good faith we
wish to offer you this.
MAX
I told you I don't want money.
MARCY DAWSON
The suitcase isn't filled with
fifties or gold or diamonds. Just
silicon. A Ming Mecca chip.
MAX
(Yeah right!)
Ming Mecca. They're not declassified.
Max starts to move away.
MARCY DAWSON
You're right. They're not. But
Lancet-Percy has many friends.
Come here, take a look.
MAX
(Stuttering)
What do...do...
But then, Max notices that his thumb is twitching.
MARCY DAWSON
Beautiful, isn't it? You know
how rare...are you okay?
MAX
Yeah, I got to go.
MARCY DAWSON
But what about...
MAX
Let me think about it...
Max trots off.
MARCY DAWSON
What? Mr. Cohen!?
Max sits on a boulder on a Coney Island jetty. He watches the
sea.
Then Max sees an old man dressed like KING NEPTUNE scanning
the shore with a rusty metal detector. The old man picks up
something. He admires it for a moment before gently setting it
back on the ground. Then Neptune continues his search.
Max wanders over to the place where the old man exam
Max wanders through the crowded streets of Chinatown.
MAX (V.O.)
If we're built from
spirals, while living within
a giant spiral, is it
possible that all of human
behavior, if it could be
quantified, is in the form of
a spiral. Then, maybe,
extensions of our behavior
like the stock market. maybe
even the writing of The
Torah, is infused with the
spiral pattern.
DISSOLVE TO
PAN ACROSS NEW EUCLID
We start on the stock ticker and pull out to reveal a leaner,
meaner and more exciting machine.
MAX (V.O.)
Friday, September
fifth. Seven twelve. It's
fair to say, I'm stepping out onto a
limb. But I'm on the edge and
that's where it happens.
He holds two wires apart from each other as he contemplates
what will connect them.
Max wanders helplessly through the dump. There's nothing but
junk and more junk.
Max eyes Marcy Dawson's business card, suspiciously He dials
the number. A man answers on the other line.
MAN'S VOICE (OS.)
Three, eight, two.
MAX
Marcy Dawson.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Who's calling?
MAX
Max Cohen.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Hold on.
Max is put on hold. He notices a man in a business suit
watching him. Max turns away.
MARCY DAWSON
Mr. Cohen? I'm so
Happy...
MAX
Look what do you want for the chip?
MARCY DAWSON
You tech guys. I think you
know what we want.
MAX
No, I don't.
MARCY DAWSON
C'mon, Mr. Cohen. We can work
together We can both profit
from this information. We both
need each other to get it, so why
not work with us?
MAX
I don't know if I'll find
anything useful.
MARCY DAWSON
We're willing to take the risk.
MAX
Okay. First, I want you
to call off the surveillance.
MARCY DAWSON
(Beat)
Done. Anything else?
MAX
Yeah, I'm a very private
person. Knock on my door and
leave the suitcase outside.
I don't want to talk to Anyone.
MARCY DAWSON
How do I know you're home?
MAX
I'll knock back.
MARCY DAWSON
Fair enough.
Max marches into his foyer when he's suddenly ambushed by
Devi's boyfriend, Farrouhk. Farrouhk is a little guy with a
big sadistic smile.
He grabs Max by the collar and slams him against the wall. His
fist butts up against Max's chin.
FARROUHK
There you go, dork.
Been thinking about my
girlfriend. Haven't you?
MAX
Wha...
FARROUHK
You want to fuck her, don't you?
MAX
No, no..
FARROUHK
You calling my girlfriend
ugly!? Why don't you want
to fuck her? You think she's
ugly?
MAX
No, no, I just. It's that
she's your girl...
FARROUHK
So you do want to
fuck her. You think about
fucking her in the mouth,
don't you?
MAX
No, no, sir, please. I've
never touched Devi...I
never will.
FARROUHK
Give the fucking
genius a Mars bar. Stay away,
or I'll slice off your balls.
Farrouhk tosses Max against the wall. Max whimpers off to his
apartment. Farrouhk has enjoyed this and to end his game be
gives Max a small slap on the butt.
INSIDE HIS APARTMENT Max bolts the front door.
At his desk he rips open the envelope Lenny Meyer gave him. He
pulls out a BLACK DISK and eyes it expectantly.
Next door, he hears Farrouhk and Devi talking.
FARROUHK (O.S.)
Damn dork.
DEVI (O.S.)
He's just a bit unique.
FARROUHK(0.S.)
Unique?! Unique?! He's a dork!
Then, Max carefully slips the DISK into Euclid's drive. Hebrew
characters pop onto Euclid's screen. Max pounds in several
strings of code lightning fast.
The Hebrew letters suddenly switch to their numerical
counterparts. Max toggles between Hebrew and numbers a few
timesimpressed.
Max nods. Then there's a knock at the door.
MAX
(To himself)
Okay.
Max peeks through the peephole. Two well-dressed large men,
BRAD and ABE THE BABE, wait for the signal. MAX knocks and the
suits leave.
Then Max shyly opens up his front door and quickly grabs the
black attach case in front of his door
Donning a surgical mask and latex gloves, Max opens the black
attach case. Sitting in foam is a tiny but beautiful chip.
Max studies it with awe.
MAX (V.O.)
Friday, September
fifth? Lots of work to be
done. But I'm close, so
close. Today is the day Might
have cost me my soul, but
down the line I'll work it
out. Just keep them in the
dark, let them beg. A damn
Ming Mecca chip. It's like
giving a desperate junkie a
syringe filled with junk.
Defense uses them to nun
nuclear sub reactors. Me? I'm
going to dissect the market.
Max carefully carries the chip over to the new leaner Euclid.
He welds it into Euclid's waiting wires.
MAX
Happy birthday, Euclid.
Then he lifts his hand to slap the RETURN button, but a sudden
wave of fear stops him.
He gets up and grabs a Ginseng soda from the fridge He drops
eight pills in the can. He calmly takes a sip from the soda
and places it on the counter.
Max can hear Devi and Farrouhk starting to make love. Their
gentle sounds
drift through the wall.
MAX (V.O.)
Eighteen thirty. Press return...
Max darts over and smacks
the RETURN. Moments later we
see what Max sees
ON THE SCREEN is a long string of zeros.
At the bottom of the screen Euclid's cursor blinks, waiting
for instructions.
He smacks RETURN again Max gets the same empty result.
Euclid's cursor blinks, waiting. Max starts to laugh. He
laughs and laughs and laughs.
MAX
Oh God. Damn religious
freaks.
(Sarcastic)
The holy Torah...
But then he notices his thumb twitching. He rubs his scar.
MAX
Ah God...
His neighbor's love sounds start to get rough. They're having
fun.
Max almost throws up.
THE BATHROOM
Max dry heaves in the sink. Then he forces himself to stand in
front of the mirror.
MAX
Too much...too soon.
He grabs the gun and tries to roll up his sleeve. He can't get
it to roll up. Suddenly he's overwhelmed by pain. He quickly
rips his shirt and fires the gun into his arm.
Nothing happens. He checks the barrelits empty
MAX
Ohh...
He grabs a bottle of medicine but knocks them an into the
sink.
He cuts his finger as be grabs one of the broken bottles. He
loads the gun and fires the medicine into his arm. A wave of
pain and nausea floods in. He grabs another bottle and fires
it into his arm. Then he fires another and another.
Frustrated he collapses into the mirror.
MAX
Stop, please, stop.
Slightly sobbing he examines his scalp pulling his hair apart.
He sees something.
MAX
What the?
So he takes out a scissors and starts removing some hair.
Meanwhile his neighbors' lovemaking gets more intense. Their
screams carry into Max's head.
Max finishes removing a patch of hair from the right side
of his head. He has uncovered a light scar on his head. He
examines it in the mirror.
MAX
What is it!? What is it!?
Then his neighbors' lovemaking turns outright evil. It
sounds like Sodom and Gomorrah next door and Max
can barely stand it.
A jolt of pain surges into his head. He grabs his scar as he
vomits blood into the sink.
He starts banging his head against the mirror. He bangs
his head again and again until the mirror CRACKS!
His neighbors are cumming and their cries of joy are twisted
and agonizing.
The mathematician looks at himself and begins to sob. He
reloads the gun and fires it right into the scar on his head,
where the pain is coming from.
Max collapses to the ground in complete agony until the bare
bulb in the bathroom starts blinking on and off.
Suddenly the pain is gone.
Then he hears something. It's Euclid, buzzing with life. He
gets to his feet and head's into Euclid.
The main monitor is screaming with numbers. The lights in the
room flicker on and off like on a disco dance floor. A
filo substance billows out of Euclid.
And then a number pops onto the screen. Max estimates how many
digits are on the screen.
MAX
Two...two hundred. That's it! That's it!
Max grabs a piece of paper and a pencil. He starts writing
down the number. He mumbles each digit as he sees it.
But then be stops writing. Power surge! He stares at the
number. Something clicks in his head. His eyes go wide. He
barely musters a
MAX
Oh...
We move closer and closer into the number, deeper and deeper
into the screen. Until finally a single pixel fills the screen
and we're in the
BLINDING WHITE VOID where we hear several deep peaceful
breaths.
Then, a fuse blows and we cut to:
BLACK
A phone ringing...once...
twice...then we hear
MRS. OVADIA(O.S.)
He's alive. His eyes are moving.
DEVI (0.S.)
Yes, hello?
FADE BACK INTO THE MAIN ROOM Max's eyes slowly open.
DEVI (0.S)
(On the phone)
He's busy right now I'm sorry.
Max is sprawled out in front
of Euclid. A large amount of
blood, from his nose, is
semi-dried on his chin and
chest. Devi hangs up the phone.
The landlady, Mrs. Ovadia, and Farrouhk, brandishing a
crowbar, stand over him.
MAX
What happened?
DEVI
You were screaming...
MRS. OVADIA
Who told you you can put extra
locks on the door.
FARROUHK
(To Mrs. OVADIA)
Shhh!
MAX
(Suddenly jolting up and remembering)
The number, the number.
Max looks at Euclid. The screen is blank. He looks at the
mainframe. It is covered with the filo substance. Then be
looks at the piece of paper he wrote the number on. Only a few
dozen numbers are on the page. The last number be wrote is
barely a scribble.
MRS. OVADIA
You're out, you hear me, you're out.
I've had enough of you. Look at all
this junk.
He starts reciting the numbers. Then Max suddenly realizes
something. He continues reciting the numbers from memory.
MAX
Four...zero...
seven...It's in my head,
it's in my head. Somehow I
memorized it. I got it up
here!
He points to his head.
MAX
But what is it?
Mrs. Ovadia starts looking at all the junk in the room.
DEVI
Are you okay?
MRS. OVADIA
What is this stuff? What does it do?
Max finally realizes that all these strangers are in his womb.
He flips.
MAX
0ut, out, you have to get
out. Get out, get out it's my
room!
FARROUHK
(To Devi)
Let's go.
The phone starts ringing again.
MRS. OVADIA
That's it, no way. You're
the one out of here, mister.
MAX
Out! 0utt
The three neighbors retreat to the front door.
DEVI
Are you okay?
MAX
Out! Get out!
Max slams the door in their faces.
Max rubs his chin and looks around the room. He starts
saying the number to himself He gets more and more
excited as he reads each digit.
In the heart of New York, Max spins around searching for his
foe.
His frustration mounts until out of the comer of his eye he
sees a strange reflection. Not knowing what it's of, he turns
around to see the source The reflection is from a giant,
brilliant stock ticker - 50 yards long and luminous.
Max stares at the quotes They are hypnotizing and Max is
suddenly calm.
Then, Max has a premonition. He turns and spots the
Photographer in front of a porn shop on Eighth and 42nd.
Max whacks the Photographer against a back-lit image of a
Hustler Centerfold. The man screams.
MAX
Who are you working for?
PHOTOGRAPHER
Here, here.
The photographer hands Max his wallet.
MAX
I don't want your wallet. Who sent you?
Max grabs the kid's camera.
MAX
Who the hell sent you!?
PHOTOGRAPHER
Wha...I'm sorry...
MAX
Who are you?!
PHOTOGRAPHER
I'm...a...student I've got
an assignment for class.
The Photographer pulls out his student ID. Max looks at it.
Then he rips out the film-exposing it.
MAX
Leave me alone, damn it.
Leave me alone.
Max hands the man back his camera and leaves.
Max heads home in a furious state. Suddenly, he sees two of
Marcy's men blocking his path. It's Brad and Jake, yet another
tough guy, and they don't look happy. Max spins around and
sees Marcy Dawson blocking his exit.
MAX
Marcy? What's up?
Max retreats.
MARCY DAWSON
Let's take a ride, Max.
MAX
I can't, I got work...
Max looks back at the tough guys who are almost on top of him.
MARCY DAWSON
We had a deal! NOW get in the limo!
Marcy releases a vicious slap that nearly knocks Max down. Max
whimpers.
MAX
Don't ever hit...
He pushes Marcy aside and darts.
Max flees. Jake and Brad charge after him. They're right on
him - he has a meter or so on them.
He scurries through a construction site and over a footbridge.
Then, he runs into an all-night
BODEGA
The tough guys chase after him and he gets a bit of a
lead in the narrow aisles. He pleads with the owners for
help - nothing doing.
Jake heads him off and uses his body to block the aisle. But
Max grabs a can of beans and slams it down on the tough guy's
nose. The guy goes down and Max shoots out the exit.
Max dives under a car and crawls for terror. He sees two sets
of feet nun by. Max starts to relax when he notices a pair of
heels on the other side of the car. Marcy bends down and looks
at him.
MARCY DAWSON
Enough, Max, c'mon out.
MAX
Leave me alone. I don't
know anything.
Max retreats in the opposite direction. Suddenly Jake and Brad
grab him and drag him out.
MAX
Hey! Hey! Hey!
They search him, taking his wallet, keys, everything.
Marcy looks at the guys, who shake their heads. She walks over
to Max and shows Max the front page of the Wall Street
Journal. It reads, "MARKET CRACHES"
MARCY DAWSON
You're responsible for this.
MAX
I didn't do anything. I
didn't play the market.
MARCY DAWSON
But we did.
Marcy pulls out a folded, worn piece of paper. She opens it.
It's Max's stock pick that he threw out. Part of THE number is
on the page
MARCY DAWSON
You have to be careful
where you throw out your trash.
MAX
How could you do that?
MARCY DAWSON
You gave us faulty information.
You gave us the carrot, the right
picks, but then you only gave us
part of the code.
MAX
You selfish, irresponsible
cretins. How could you be so
stupid!?
Marcy jabs Max in his stomach. Max falls to the ground. The
tough guys sit on him.
MARCY DAWSON
C'mon, Max. This isn't a
game anymore. We're playing
on a global scale. We used
your code. Foolish...I admit.
But we can fix things if we
make some careful picks. Give
us the rest of the code so
we can set things right.
MAX
C'mon! I know who you are.
You're not gonna save the world.
MARCY DAWSON
Look, Max...
Marcy nods to Jake, who pulls out a gun and points it at Max's
head.
MAX
My God, what are you doing?
MARCY DAWSON
Information is
the private language
of Capital. We tried to
establish a symbiotic
relationship but if
you choose to compete and
enter our niche we are forced
to comply with the laws of
nature.
Max thinks for a second. Max thinks hard. He realizes be
can't give them the number.
MAX
You can't kill me!
MARCY DAWSON
C'mon, Max. You
don't get it. I don't
give a shit about you. I only
care about what's in your
fucking head. If you won't help
us help yourself, then I'll
have only one choice. Destroy the
competition. I'll take you
out of the game. Survival of the
fittest, Max. And we've got
the gun.
Jake cocks the gun. Max starts to cry.
MAX
You bastards! You stupid
bastards!
Suddenly, Jake is whacked with a sawed-off baseball bat.
He smashes into the sidewalk.
It is Farrouhk, Max's neighbor, who's just pulled up in his
taxicab.
MAX
(Spotting his savior)
Farrouhk!
Farroukh threatens Marcy and the other tough guy, who
retreat in fear. Farroubk is afraid as well, so he doesn't
quite leap on them. He just keeps swinging the bat.
FARROUHK
He's sick! He's sick!
Max gets to his feet and runs behind Farrouhk.
Just then a station wagon screeches up to the curb. Lenny
Meyer, Ephraim, and a bunch of other his burly Jews jump out.
LENNY MEYER
Max!
Max looks at Farrouhk and then he looks at Lenny. Ephraim
grabs Max and pulls him toward the station wagon.
MAX
(To Farrouhk)
C'mon...
Farrouhk heads for his cab. Ephraim helps Max into the
backseat of the wagon and climbs in after him.
Lenny Meyer jumps into the passenger seat and the gray-bearded
YISRAEL slams on the gas Pedal.
Farrouhk jumps into his cab.
Max races through the streets of New York. He is wide-eyed.
MAX (V.0.)
Suddenly, it's all there.
It all makes sense. I
can crack it. I can know it.
I know what it is. Sol knows,
too. I need to tell him. I
need to show him. I need to
bring him with me.
People fly by. Max in a spiraling whirlwind.
A pumped and excited Max paces the hall as he rings the bell.
The door opens. But it isn't Sol. It's a young, beautiful
woman wearing a simple black dress. Her name is JENNY ROBESON
and she is Sol's niece.
JENNY ROBESON
Can I help you?
MAX
(Confused)
Sol?
JENNY ROBESON
Were you a friend?
MAX
What do you mean?
JENNY ROBESON
He had a second stroke.
MAX
Where is he?
Jenny's eyes drop.
MAX
No.
Max rushes into Sol s study. The room is covered with Sol's P,
research books. It seems Sol had recently come out of
retirement. Max looks at a few of Sol's books. Then he finds a
