                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

1INT.  BAR - NIGHT1

      A Washington DC bar.  Upscale.  Young and intense in that
      way that means everyone is holding a martini and scanning
      the room for people more important than they are.  It's not
      drinks, it's a competition.  And the winner is HARRISON (late
      20s).  At least, he ACTS like the winner.  Right now, he's
    at a table, drink in hand.  QUINN (20s) comes in.  Quinn
      hates the fact that people assume that because she is pretty,
      she is not smart.  Because she is.  Smart.

                                      QUINN
                    Harrison Jones?

                                      HARRISON
                    Quinn Rielly.

                                      QUINN
                    I can't stay.

                                      HARRISON
                    What are you drinking?

                                      QUINN
                    I can't stay.  I'm sorry.  I only
                    came because Lori said she didn't
                    have your number and couldn't cancel
                    and I didn't want you to be waiting
                    here because getting stood up in
                    this particular bar is like falling
                    face down on a runway and even though
                    I don't know you, Lori's got this
                    annoying habit of meddling and it
                    seemed only decent to-

                                      HARRISON
                    What are you drinking?

                                      QUINN
                    I can't stay, is what I am saying. 
                    I don't do blind dates.

                                      HARRISON
                    My parents met on a blind date. 
                    Been inseparable ever since.


                                                                (CONTINUED)      UNTITLED SHONDA RHIMES PILOT (2010)     12-17-10   2

                                      QUINN
                    I'm happy for your parents.  And for
                    you because it means you exist.  But
                    I-

                                      HARRISON
                    This isn't a blind date.

                                      QUINN
                    What?

                                      HARRISON
                    It's a job interview.  What are you
                    drinking?

      He's flagged down a waiter.  Quinn hesitates, then sits.  

                                      QUINN
                    Dirty martini. --  What do you mean
                    this is a job interview?

      Harrison waits until the waiter goes then turns back to Quinn.  

                                      HARRISON
                    This is a job interview.

                                      QUINN
                    You're a baby lawyer.  You're 12
                    years old.

                                      HARRISON
                    I'm 28 years old.

                                      QUINN
                    Why aren't we sitting in an office
                    in a law firm?

                                      HARRISON
                    Because that's not how we do job
                      interviews.

                                      QUINN
                    I didn't apply for a job with you.  

                                      HARRISON
                    You did.

                                      QUINN
                    I didn't.

                                      HARRISON
                    You did.

      Quinn stands.  She's no longer amused.

                                      QUINN
                    Okay, you know what?  This has
                      been...whatever, but I don't do blind
                    dates so-

                                      HARRISON
                    Ask me who I work for.

                                      QUINN
                    What?

                                      HARRISON
                    You really wanna ask me who I work
                    for.

                                      QUINN
                    Fine.  Who do you work for?

                                      HARRISON
                    Olivia Price.

      Quinn sits back down.  Stunned.

                                      QUINN
                    Olivia Price?  THE Olivia Price?
                          (glee to insanity to
                            despair)
                    Wait.  Shut up.  Wait.  
                          (don't fuck with me)
                    Is this some kind of ploy to make me
                    stay on this date?

      Harrison reels in his fish.

                                      HARRISON
                    Quinn, this is not a blind date.  On
                    blind dates, I like to buy a woman 
                    dinner because it makes her more
                    likely to either sleep with me or
                    give me a second date.  When I buy
                    you dinner, you'll know I'm
                      interested.  You did apply for a job
                    with me.  The way I know you applied
                    for a job with me is that I have
                    your resume on my iPad.  The way I
                    know you would kill puppies to get
                    this job is that you stopped breathing
                    when I said the name Olivia Price.

                                      HARRISON (CONT'D)
                    Which is a tell, your tell, and you
                    should look at that because I'm going
                    to offer you a crap salary and you'll
                    have to take it because you never
                    learned to breathe in and out without
                    stopping.  But don't feel bad about
                    it because we all get paid crap
                    salaries because we're the good guys. 
                    I'm a good guy which means I don't
                    generally lie but I did to you. 
                    This is not a job interview.

                                      QUINN
                    Wait.  I don't...I'm confused.

                                      HARRISON
                    Olivia already told me to hire you. 
                    The job is yours.  If you want it.
                    It's the best job you'll ever have. 
                    You will change lives, you will slay
                    dragons, you will love the hunt more
                    than you ever dreamed.  Because Olivia
                    Price is as amazing as they say. 
                    And I am not a baby lawyer, I am a
                    gladiator in a suit.  Because that's
                    what you are when you work for Olivia. 
                      A gladiator in a suit.  You wanna be
                      a gladiator in a suit?

      His enthusiasm is mesmerizing.  And true.  Quinn nods.

                                      HARRISON (CONT'D)
                    You gotta say it.

      And Quinn takes a deep breath...

                                      QUINN
                    I wanna be a gladiator in a suit.

2EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT2

      It's dirty and abandoned down here.  An SUV pulls up and
      OLIVIA (30s) steps out.  Stylish but weary, too smart for
      her own good.  People tend to underestimate her.  That's a
      mistake.  STEPHEN (30s) is waiting for her.   STEPHEN's
      handsome and male and brilliant in a way that makes you
      worried you'll do something inappropriate like lick him. 
      The minute she's out of the car, they head for the warehouse. 
      All business, intense.

                    How many guys in the room?

                                      STEPHEN
                    Just the two of them.  Two insane
                    morons.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Hey, did you propose?  Weren't you
                    going to ask her marry you tonight?

                                      STEPHEN
                    I was doing this tonight. 

                                      OLIVIA
                    So you bailed. -- Did you give them
                    the money?

                                      STEPHEN
                    Yes.  Which is when the problem
                    started. -- And I did not bail.  I'm
                    working.  For you.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Did you at least buy the engagement
                    ring?

                                      STEPHEN
                    Olivia.  What's going on in that
                    warehouse?  Is not good.  Is, in
                    fact, the opposite of good.  So
                    bugging me about proposing to my
                      girlfriend?  Not on point.  There's
                      a situation in there.  Focus.  Do
                    what you do.

      A beat.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You really should have proposed...

      And Olivia and Stephen swing into the warehouse...

3INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS3

      Where two men in expensive suits stand.  They look like
      businessmen.  Or stockbrokers.  Except for the fact that
      they are currently holding guns on one another.  Let's call
      them OSKAR (40s) and VLAD (50s).  They're Russian, nervous;
      there's a basket and an ENORMOUS pile of money wrapped in
      neat stacks on the table.  Even so, Olivia is calm, confident.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Is there some way I can expedite the
                    proceedings, gentlemen?

                                      OSKAR
                    I'm gonna kill him!  I swear to God,
                    I'll blow his brains on the carpet!

                                    VLAD
                    Not if I shoot you first!

                                      OLIVIA
                    No one is shooting anyone.  Put the
                    guns down.

                                    VLAD
                    He puts down his, I'll put down mine.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Oskar, that's your name?  Oskar, put
                    your gun down.

                                      OSKAR
                    So he can shoot me?  Hell no.

      Olivia looks Stephen.  Sighs.  Then she steps between the
      two men.  So that both guns are now pointed directly at her.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Okay?  Now the only person who gets
                    shot is me.  

                                      STEPHEN
                    Liv-

                                      OLIVIA
                    Stephen.  I have this.
                          (to Oskar and Vlad)
                    Now, guns down.

      But neither man moves.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Okay.  What seems to be the problem?

                                      OSKAR
                    He's gonna blow me on the deal.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Vlad, are you gonna blow Oskar?

                                    VLAD
                    ...No...

                    I wanted us to go 50/50.  He wants
                    70/30.  I did all the work!

                                      OLIVIA
                    Oskar, will you consider 60/40 if
                    Vlad promises not to blow you?  

      Oskar thinks.  Then:

                                      OSKAR
                    I keep the car.

                                      OLIVIA
                    What car?  You know what, forget I
                    asked.  I don't need to know.  Vlad,
                    can Oskar keep the car?

                                    VLAD
                    I suppose that's okay.  Yes.

                                      OLIVIA
                    So no one blows anyone, we have a
                    60/40 split and Oskar keeps the car. 
                    Any other deal points either of you
                    would like to negotiate at this time?

                                      VLAD/OSKAR
                    No.  /I'm good.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Guns down.  GUNS DOWN.

      Reluctantly, Vlad and Oskar lower their guns. 

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Now shake hands.

      They look at her.  Is she fucking kidding them?

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    We have a verbal contract.  Shake
                    hands to seal the deal.  Do it.  Go
                    on.

      And reluctant, Oskar and Vlad step forward and shake hands.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Good boys.

                    Now I'm gonna take what we paid for
                    and I'm going to go.  I do not want
                    to hear any gunfire when I leave
                    this building, is that clear?

      They nod.  Olivia steps forward, gently picks up the basket. 

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    It was a pleasure doing business

                    thank you.  I hope to never see you

      And she and Stephen back out the door with the basket.

4EXT.  WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS4

      Stephen and Olivia head for their cars with the basket.

                                      STEPHEN
                    God, I love this job.

5INT. PRICE AND ASSOCIATES LOBBY - NIGHT5

      The office is small but elegant.  A lot of steel and glass. 
    We can see the Washington Monument through the window. 
      Harrison and Quinn step off the elevator.

                                      QUINN
                    Do I look okay?

                                      HARRISON
                    Your skirt is too short.  Olivia
                    will talk about you.  Just take it
                    in.

                                      QUINN
                    Are you sure she's even here?  It's
                    after midnight.

                                      HARRISON
                    She's here.  She's always here.

      They round a corner and inside the glass walls of the
      conference room, Olivia, Stephen and ABBY (30s) are visible. 
      They're eating Chinese food, Olivia's sitting on the table,
      shoes kicked off, the basket beside her.  ABBY is round and
      warm and bubbly, the kind of woman who has cats and knits
      things.  But don't get too comfortable -- she'll stab you
      with her knitting needle if you fuck with her.

                    That's Stephen and that's Abby. 
                    He's a litigator, she's an
                      investigator.  And that's...

                    Olivia Price.
                          (awestruck)
                    She's taller on TV.

      Which makes no sense because Olivia is sitting down.  But
      Quinn's a little overwhelmed...

                                      QUINN (CONT'D)
                    Wait.  Why did she wanna hire me?  

                                      HARRISON
                    Business is growing, we needed another
                    smart set of hands.

                                      QUINN
                    No.  I mean, me?

                    Come on.

6INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS6

      Olivia has one hand inside the basket.  We can't see why.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I'm not doing it.

                                    ABBY
                    Well, I'm not doing it either.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Whoa.  Don't look at me.

      Harrison and Quinn enter.  

                                      HARRISON
                    How'd it go?

                                      OLIVIA
                    We gave them three million, they
                    gave us the package.

                    Two guns to her head, the woman
                    doesn't flinch.

                    the White House, it's an honor to

      She's nervous, gushing.

                                      OLIVIA
                    We're not a law firm.  We're lawyers
                    but this is not a law firm.  

                                      STEPHEN
                    Law firms are for pansies.

                    We...solve problems.  Manage crises.

                                      QUINN
                    Of course.  Right.  Still...an honor.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Harrison feed you a line about being

      Olivia reaches into the basket.  And pulls out a baby.  An
      actual live baby.  Holds it like a grenade.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    You know how to gladiate a diaper
                    change?

      Quinn stares at the baby, stunned.  Then the elevator dings
      and three Arab men in suits rush in followed by a MAN IN A
      TURBAN and his modestly dressed WIFE.  When she sees the
      baby...  

                                    WIFE
                    AHMAD!

      She's crying, moving forward, pulling the baby from Olivia's
      hands into her arms.  The Man in a Turban turns to Olivia.

                                    MAN
                    Thank you, thank you.  When the
                    kidnappers took him, I thought...but
                    you've returned my son to me.  Thank
                    you.

      And he pulls her in for a hug.  One of the men in suits
      discreetly hands Stephen a check.  He checks the amount,
      smiles.  The man in the turban is still hugging Olivia.

                                    MAN (CONT'D)
                    Anything I can do for you.  Anything.

                    If you have a second child, Olivia
                    is a beautiful name.

                    Stephen.  -- Mr.  Ambassador, you
                    can take your son back to your

                    you can never tell anyone about this. 
                    Ever.  The FBI is sick of me.

                    Of course.  Thank you, thank you.

      And they go.  Passing HUCK (20s), the lone paralegal, as he
      comes in.

      Olivia heads out.  Everyone follows her.

7INT.  PRICE AND ASSOCIATES LOBBY - CONTINUOUS7

      Olivia and the others enter.  There's a MAN (32) there. 
      Handsome and charismatic in a John Edwards way.  His left
      arm doesn't work -- a war injury that only makes him seem
      more heroic.  Right now, though, his shirt and part of his
      face are covered in blood.  He eyes them panicked and lost.

      Through the glass we can see Sully sitting in the conference
      room.  Someone's given him a towel and he uses it to wipe
      the blood from his face.  Outside the glass, Harrison,
      Stephen, Quinn and Olivia watch him.  Abby arrives, hands
      out a sheath of papers.

                    gives expensive speeches.  Makes a
                    fortune.  He's anti-choice, pro-gun,
                    hates the gays and likes it when
                    kids pray in school.

                    I'm just saying he sickens me
                    politically, I'm not saying we
                    shouldn't help him.  From what I
                    could find, Sully's a straight
                    shooter, no dirty laundry.

      Abby hands Olivia a photo.  The dead girl smiles out at us,
      happier times.

                    Well, she's got a silver spoon in
                    her mouth. 

                                      QUINN
                    How can you tell?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Her teeth.  They're capped.

                    Rich kids get their teeth fixed.  

      And Quinn subtly puts a hand up to check her teeth.  Olivia
      clocks it.  No one else notices.  But we do.  Huck arrives.

                                    HUCK
                    It's on the police scanners.  Girl
                    was found dead in her apartment,
                    three shots to the head.  Sully called
                    911 but took off before the police
                    arrived.    

                                      HARRISON
                    Three?  That's not an accident.

     Quinn raises her hand.  They look at her.

9INT. PRICE AND ASSOCIATES CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT9

      Our team (Olivia, Abby, Stephen, Quinn, and Harrison) are
      with Sully.  Stephen paces the room -- he's not a sitter. 
      Quinn follows Harrison's lead and takes notes.

                                      OLIVIA  (V.O.)
                    We interview Sully.  

      Sully's emotional, trying for composure.

                                      SULLY
                    I was gonna propose.  We were gonna
                    get married.  She was...Paige was
                    everything to me...she was my best
                    friend...

                                      OLIVIA  (V.O.)
                    We listen to him.  We watch him.  In
                    this moment, we are the judge and we
                    are the jury.  This is the moment
                    when we decide who he is.   

      Quinn's watching, moved.  But everyone else is just watching.  

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Did you kill her?

                                      SULLY
                    No!  No, I would never...I loved
                    her.

                                      HARRISON
                    Where'd the blood come from?

                                      SULLY
                    I went to her apartment.  I...I found
                    her like that.  I held her.  She
                      was...there was so much blood.  I
                    called the police.  And I was waiting
                    for them and then I just...I don't
                    know, I panicked.  I'm on TV, you
                    know?  I didn't know what to...I
                    thought they would think I did it. 
                      I panicked...I'm sorry, I should
                    know how to handle this, I should be
                    better at this...

                                      SULLY
                    I was...I don't sleep good.  After
                    the war...my arm hurts, I don't wanna

                    I'm going to need the key.

      Sully nods.

                    I never even thought...she's gone,

                    I don't think he did it.  He's a
                    soldier, a government issue trained
                    killing machine, he'd have to be an
                    idiot to get her blood all over
                    himself, to call 911 and then run. 
                    But I still vote no.  The press is
                    gonna eat this up  By dawn, the

                    I don't wanna take it because it's
                    too messy, too much work.  And I
                    hate Republicans. 

      Olivia stares in at Sully.  Shaking, covered in blood, lost.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I vote we take it.

                    My gut says he's innocent.  We're

                    Which is why I don't like to vote!  

      Stephen glares at Olivia.  She snuggles into him, plants a

                    now's your chance.

      Sully ducks his head.  And we wait, nervous.  But when he
      raises his head, we see that his face is streaked with tears.

17EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE - NIGHT17

      A middle class house in Virginia.  Olivia rings the doorbell. 
      Insistent.  Never stopping until it is yanked open.  DAVID
      (40s) glares at her, bleary-eyed.  

                                      DAVID
                    Why am I not surprised that you're
                    on this?  

                                      OLIVIA
                    You have to give me 48 hours before
                    you arrest or charge Sully Sinclair.

                                      DAVID
                    I was sleeping.

                    The US Attorney's Office never sleeps. 
                    You told me that once.

                                      DAVID
                    I was being ironic.

                    Olivia, you don't have the muscle of
                    the White House behind you anymore. 
                    You're just a private citizen who

                    Do you actually have the naive belief
                    that waking me up in the middle of
                    the night and threatening me is the
                    correct path to getting your way?

                    I wasn't threatening you.  He didn't
                    kill her.  My gut says he didn't.

    He starts to shut the door.  Olivia wedges her body in the
      door's path, keeping it open.

                    So what happens now?

                                      HARRISON
                    She wants more.  We get more.

27EXT. LAFAYETTE SQUARE PARK - DAY27

      Olivia walks through the park directly across from the White
      House.  Reaches CYRUS (late 50s), his face betraying
      exhaustion in only the way someone who works too hard can. 
      A few steps away, a man with an earpiece waits for Cyrus. 
      Cyrus and Olivia have the ease of old comrades.

                                      OLIVIA
                    What.

                                      CYRUS
                          (chiding)
                    Hi.  Hello.  How are you.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Hi, hello, how are you.  What.

                                      CYRUS
                    You working the Sully Sinclair thing?

                                      OLIVIA
                    We're not going public, making no
                    comments yet.  I'm trying to see if
                    I can stamp out the flames before it
                    becomes a wildfire.  If you guys
                    could refrain from commenting...

                                      CYRUS
                    We'll stay quiet.  What's your gut
                    say?

                                      OLIVIA
                    He didn't do it.

                                      CYRUS
                    Your gut's never wrong.

      Olivia studies him.  Gentle.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You look tired.  Too tired.  What.

                                      CYRUS
                          (reluctant)
                    He needs a favor.

      And Olivia's face closes down.  Not liking this.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I don't work for him anymore.

                                      CYRUS
                    He trusts you.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I don't work for him anymore.

                                      CYRUS
                    And yet you came when I called.

      A beat.  Then Olivia puts her arm through his, leans on him. 
      Giving in.  But guarded.  Sorry for him, protecting herself.

                    There's a girl, an aide.  Going around
                    saying she's sleeping with him.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Is she?

                    No.  You know him, he's not that
                    guy...I need you to shut her down.

      And we're on Olivia as she takes this in.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    I need to see him.

                    I need to look him in the eye and
                    know he's not lying.

                                      CYRUS
                    He's not... Look, the man's schedule
                    is insane.  He has no time to see
                    you.

      Olivia hardens.

                    He wants the favor, he wants my

                    anymore.  So you tell the President
                    of the United States to make time.

      And she walks away.

28EXT. PRICE AND ASSOCIATES OFFICE BUILDING - DAY28

      Olivia heads out of the building, a cup of takeout coffee in
      hand.  Abby and Stephen follow her.  

                                      STEPHEN
                    You're going?

                                      OLIVIA
                    I'm going.

                                      STEPHEN
                    To Camp David.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I won't be gone long.

                                      STEPHEN
                    You're going to Camp David to meet
                    with the President...why?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Meeting in the White House is too
                    official.  Press is there. 

                                    ABBY
                    He wants you to take your old job
                    back, doesn't he?  He's wooing you.

                                      OLIVIA
                    He's not wooing me.  We're friends.  

                                      STEPHEN
                    You and I are friends.  He's the
                    leader of the free world.  -- Your
                    life makes me feel unsuccessful. 

                                    ABBY
                    You get weird.  After you see him,
                    you get weird.  He makes you weird.

                                      OLIVIA
                    He doesn't make me weird.  We have
                    less than 12 hours left on Sully
                    Sinclair so stay on it, text me if
                    anything happens.  I'll be back soon. 

      Olivia reaches her car.  Abby holds out her hand.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    No.

                    You know you're not allowed to have
                    coffee in the car.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    I spilled once.

                                      STEPHEN
                    That time in Dallas.  That time in
                    Boston.  Election night.  Ten minutes
                    before you had to be on the dais to
                    watch the President of the United
                    States take the oath of office...

                                      OLIVIA
                    Leave me alone. 

      Abby rolls her eyes.

                                    ABBY
                    Same reason why no one's allowed to
                    give you gum...

                                      STEPHEN
                    Hey.  Should I really do it?

      And Abby keeps curiously quiet during the following:

                                      OLIVIA
                    Yes.

                                      STEPHEN
                    I'm talking about asking Georgia to
                    marry me.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Yes.  

                                      STEPHEN
                    Because I was thinking I'd buy a
                    ring today but now with Sully...

                                      OLIVIA
                    Stephen, do you want me to talk you
                    into it or out of it?

                                      STEPHEN
                    Into it.  Out of it.  No.  Into it.

                    I said it's the dream, not the

      Quinn rounds the corner.  Races to them.  A little breathless.

                    Huck finally managed to hack Paige's
                    emails.  I've been reading them and
                    I think I found something.  Paige
                    sent an email to a friend, Ariel
                    Masse.  On the night of the murder,
                    they were supposed to meet and attend
                    an embassy party.

      She's proud of herself.  Until:

                                      OLIVIA
                    So how come she didn't go?

                          (to Quinn)
                    Go away.

      Disappointed to be dismissed, Quinn takes off.

29INT. SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM - DAY29

      Abby talks to ARIEL MASSE (26), a museum docent. 

                                      ARIEL
                    Yeah, Paige and I had plans to go
                    the French Consulate dinner.  Usually
                    she goes to those things with Sully
                    but my father got me on the invite
                    list and it was just a plus one so...

                                    ABBY
                    What happened?

                                      ARIEL
                    She called at the last minute and
                    canceled.  No big deal.

      But Ariel's shifting back and forth, eager to get away.

                                    ABBY
                    Ariel.  Paige is dead.  You know
                    that.  So if there's something you're
                    not telling me...

      Ariel hesitates.  

                                      ARIEL
                    You have to get this.  Understand
                    it.  Paige loved Sully.  She used to
                    be, we both used to be, you know,
                    party girls.  Always out, always
                    with a different guy.  We did stuff.
                    Drugs. But then Paige met Sully and
                    she just...settled down with him. 
                    It made her family really happy. 
                    They were amazing together...
                          (emotional, crying)
                    I just can't believe she's dead.  

                                    ABBY
                    Ariel, you can cry.  That's
                    understandable.  But it's not going

30EXT.  CAMP DAVID - DAY30

      Two MARINES stand guard at the gates of Camp David.  Olivia's
      SUV pulls up.  She rolls down her window.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Olivia Price.

      She gets out.  Hands one Marine her driver's license.  Pops
      the back of the SUV so the other Marine can search her car
      and peer under it with one of those mirrors on a pole thingies
      they use.  There's a conspicuous coffee stain on her blouse. 
      She takes off her blouse, puts her suit jacket on over just
      her bra.  Looks at the Marine who eyes her, confused.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    I spilled.

31INT.  CAMP DAVID MAIN HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY31

      Olivia is shown in by an aide.  Cyrus is waiting.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Hi, hello, how are you.

      They share a grin.

                                      CYRUS
                    Better.  They're here, they'll be
                    out in a moment.

                                      OLIVIA
                    The First Lady came too?  She knows
                    about this?

                                      CYRUS
                    It's not like during the Election,
                    Liv.  The rigors of the White House
                    have bonded them, the marriage is
                    stronger than ever.

      And then MELLIE GRANT (50s) enters the room.  Mellie's
      everything we'd want in a First Lady -- warm, strong and
      funny.  Casual in capris and a sweater.  The every woman. 

                                      MELLIE

                                      OLIVIA
                    Mellie.

      They hug.  They genuinely like one another.

                    You're a little busy.  How're the
                    kids?

                    How are you?  Are you dating anybody? 
                    Because there's a guy over at the

                    I'm good.  Really.  Thanks.

      And then her attention is diverted because PRESIDENT
      FITZGERALD GRANT (50s) is striding into the room.  Fitz is
      handsome, charismatic, brilliant and humble.  Kennedy-esque. 
    We like him immediately.

                    Mr. President.  

      And under the watchful eyes of Mellie and Cyrus, they shake
      hands.  Warm but formal.  

32EXT. CAMP DAVID - DAY32

      Fitz, Cyrus and Olivia stroll the grounds, two Secret Service
      agents following not far behind.

                                    FITZ
                    I can't thank you enough for taking
                    this on.

      Cyrus hands Olivia a packet of papers.

                                      CYRUS
                    Her name is Julia Tannen.  She's 27. 
                    And she's speaking to anyone in the
                    West Wing who'll listen.

                                      OLIVIA
                    And you can't fire her.

                    Look, she's yet to go the press. 
                    I'd like to put a stop to it before
                    she does.

                                    FITZ
                    It's not right.  It makes me look
                    like some dirty old man.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    I have to ask...

      And Fitz stops walking.

                                    FITZ
                    No.  I never.  I would never.  No.  

      And she looks at him a long beat.  Judging.

                                    FITZ (CONT'D)
                    You've known me for a long time. 
                    Longer than most.  And you've seen
                    me at my best and my worst.  You
                    know I did not fall for some young
                    girl.  You know there's only one
                    person I love.  

      He's earnest.  Needing her to see that he's telling the truth.  

                                      CYRUS
                    Mellie and Fitz are happy together. 
                    He'd have no reason to cheat.  Liv...

      She hasn't taken her eyes off Fitz, weighing him.  But now: 

                                      OLIVIA
                    I'll handle it.  Consider it handled.

      She smiles.  Fitz smiles back.

                                    FITZ
                    You should come back to the White
                    House.  We need you on our side.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I like working for myself.  But I've
                    never left your side.  

      And she means it.  Cyrus claps them both on the back.

33INT. PRICE AND ASSOCIATES OFFICE - DAY33

      Harrison and Quinn work on their computers.  Olivia moves
      past the door, turns and comes back.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Where are we?

                    Waiting for forensics on the gun to
                    come in.

      Abby flies in.  She does a little dance.

                                    ABBY
                    Paige is a whore!  She was screwing
                    some guy named Tom Pierson!  She
                    canceled on the embassy party to
                    meet up with him.  We have another
                    viable suspect!  Cause Paige is a
                    whore!
                          (off their looks)
                    And now I realize that calling a
                    dead person a whore is inappropriate. 
                    I'm just gonna...run down Pierson,
                    see if I can make something stick.

      And she goes.  Olivia looks at Quinn.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Quinn.  I need you find out everything

                    have 30 minutes and then I need you
                    to come with me.  

      And Olivia's gone.  Quinn looks at Harrison.

                                      HARRISON

      And Quinn is off.

34EXT. PARK - DAY34

      Quinn stands in the park with Olivia.  Olivia's watching
      people walk their dogs.  Looking for someone.  

                                      QUINN

                    You are acting as my witness.  Just
                    stay by my side, don't say anything.

      Finally, she spots a young woman walking a puppy.  JULIA
      TANNEN (27).  She walks up to her, Quinn close behind.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Cute dog.  A Lab?

                                      JULIA
                    Yeah.  His name's Thomas Jefferson. 
                    Which is lame, I know, but he's very
                      Presidential.  Aren't you, TJ?

      Julia beams at the puppy.  Olivia's voice is even,
      professional and devoid of any warmth. 

                                      OLIVIA
                    Julia.  It would be a mistake to
                    think that there will be no
                    consequences to you telling lies
                    about the President.

      Julia stiffens.  Quinn looks at Olivia, surprised.

                                      JULIA
                    Who are you?  

                                      OLIVIA
                    My name is Olivia Price.  And I want
                    to be clear that I'm not here in any
                    official capacity.  I'm here as a
                    concerned citizen.  

                                      JULIA

                                      OLIVIA
                    I want to warn you.  Because you
                    seem like a fine person.  So you
                    should know what could happen.  It
                    could become hard for you to find
                      employment, your face would be
                      everywhere, people would associate
                    you with a sex scandal.  All kinds
                    of information about you could easily
                    become available to the press.  For
                    example, you've had 22 sexual
                    partners?  That we know of.  Also
                    there's that ugly bout of gonorrhea. 
                    And your family...Your mother's mental
                    illness.  A psychotic break?  2 years
                    in Bedford Hospital?  I bet that's
                    private.  She's runs a daycare now,
                    right?

      Julia's tearing up, beginning to shake.

                    He said he loved me.  He gave me
                    this dog.

                                      OLIVIA
                    See, it's those kind of lies that
                    could hurt you if you said them to
                    other people.  People not as nice as

                    done.  

                                      JULIA
                    Why are you doing this to me?  I'm a
                    good person.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You know who was also a good person? 
                    Monica Lewinsky.  And she was telling 
                    the truth.  But she still got
                    destroyed.  

      Julia grabs her dog's leash, hurries away.  Quinn stands
      there, shell-shocked.  Olivia looks at her.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    If you get subpoenaed in front of a
                    grand jury, you can testify as an

                    working on my own, I didn't blackmail
                    or threaten her.  If you don't get
                      subpoenaed, this never happened.

      And she heads out of the park.  It takes Quinn a moment to
      follow her.  Up ahead, Olivia dials her cell.

      She hangs up.  And we realize she looks sick to her stomach.

      The stall door opens.  Quinn comes out, wiping her face.  

                                      QUINN
                    Fine.  I'm crying.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Well...don't do that.

      Olivia turns to go.  And Quinn gets brave.

                                      QUINN
                    Why did you hire me?

                                      OLIVIA
                    What?

                                      QUINN
                    Why me?  What about me made you feel
                    like I was a person you wanted by
                    your side when you decimated a girl
                    walking her dog?

      Olivia examines her.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You went to Yale Law School. 

                                      QUINN
                    So?

      Quinn shifts, uncomfortable.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Before that, you were at Indiana
                    State.  And before that, you did two
                    years at Smithvile Community College. 
                    How'd you get to Yale?

                                      QUINN
                    I...I worked hard.

                                      OLIVIA
                    This is your one chance, Quinn. 
                    How'd you get to Yale?

                                      QUINN
                    Why do you keep asking me that?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Because your resume is a lie.  There
                    is a Quinn Rielly who went to Yale
                    Law but she's working in New York
                    right now.  Your name is Quinn McKee. 
                    I'm guessing you told the lie because
                    a girl like you, a girl with a state
                    school law degree, whose dad is in
                    jail, whose mother is on welfare, a
                    girl who's nobody from nowhere
                    couldn't catch a break in the high
                    powered halls of DC.  

                                      QUINN
                    And you still wanted to hire me?

                                      OLIVIA
                    It's why I hired you.  Hundreds of
                      applicants, all of them with fancy
                    pedigrees and then there's you, who
                    couldn't catch a break.  Not a rich
                    kid, not even a middle class kid. 
                    You come from trash.  -- I fix things,
                    Quinn.  It's who I am.  You?  Need
                    fixing.  And I trust my gut, my gut
                    is everything and my gut tells me
                    you're a fighter.  You walked away
                    from home and you never looked back. 
                    Your hands aren't soft.  And this
                    job, it's not for the weak and it's
                    not for the weary.  So toughen up. 
                    You don't cry here.  You don't cry
                    in this job until all is lost.  You
                    don't cry when you're in the middle
                    of this job and there's still hope. 
                    So wipe your tears and let's get
                    back to work.

      Olivia grabs some paper towels and holds them out to Quinn.

                                      QUINN
                    How did you find out?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Abby's good at her job.  And rich
                    kids get their teeth fixed.  And I
                    come from trash too.

      Quinn takes the paper towels.  Olivia leaves.  Quinn stands
      there a beat.  Then she wipes her tears and heads out.

36INT. PRICE AND ASSOCIATES/OLIVIA'S OFFICE - DAY36

      Olivia stands in front of the bank of TVs that make up one
    of her walls.  They're all on, sound off.  Except for one. 
    On one, live footage of the President plays.  He heads from
      his helicopter, waving and smiling for the press.  Holding
      Mellie's hand.  Cyrus is with them.  A REPORTER speaks.

                                      REPORTER
                    The President and the First Lady are
                    just now returning to the White House
                    where tonight they will be hosting a
                    State Dinner for President Sarkozy
                    and the French First Lady...

      She eyes the image.  Unsettled.  Grabs her cell, dials.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Put him on.  I just need a second.

      And on the TV screen, we can see Cyrus handing the President
      his cell phone.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Did you buy her a dog?

    We can see the President's lips moving on the TV but we hear
      him in Liv's phone.

                                    FITZ
                    What?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Just answer the question.

                                    FITZ
                    No.  Of course not.  Why do you ask?

                    little to the left.

      And he does.  So she can now see his full face on the TV
      screen.  She gets close to the screen, stares into his eyes.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Okay.  Sorry.  Forget I asked.

      And she hangs up.  On TV, Fitz hangs up.  Olivia nods to
      herself.  Reassured.  Stephen comes in.

                                      STEPHEN
                    How big are we?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Sully's on the crawl on the big three
                    cable news stations.  All over Drudge. 
                    Networks haven't got it but the
                    nightly news is still a few hours
                    away.   

                                      STEPHEN
                    I've had my ear to the ground.  Diane
                    Sawyer's sniffing.  Anybody give it
                    a logo yet?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Not yet.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Good.  We're not big until we're
                    logo big.

      Abby enters with Harrison.

                                    ABBY
                    I've got good, I've got bad, I've
                    got ugly.  The Good:  Paige was
                    sleeping with Tom Pierson.  Bad: he
                    has an airtight alibi.  He was working
                    as a bouncer at a club at the time
                    of the murder.  100 witnesses.  Ugly? 
                    Tom claims Sully KNEW he was sleeping
                    with his girlfriend.  Which gives
                    Sully motive.

                                      HARRISON
                    Even uglier: The ballistics on the
                    gun used in the murder match the
                    type of gun Sully owned.  Which gives
                    Sully means.

      And Olivia heads out of her office.

37INT. PRICE AND ASSOCIATES/HARRISON'S OFFICE - DAY37

      Olivia storms in, Stephen and Abby right behind her.  Sully's
      sitting on the sofa, he looks up surprised.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Did you know Paige was sleeping with
                    Tom Pierson?

                                      SULLY
                    What?

                                      OLIVIA
                    DID YOU KNOW?!

                                      SULLY
                    Hey, I hired you.  You can't yell at-

                                      STEPHEN
                    Yes, she can.  She can do whatever
                    the hell she wants because if she
                    doesn't you are definitely going to
                    jail.  You might go to jail anyway
                    but you're definitely going if you
                    don't answer her questions.  My guess
                    is 20 years but if the DA gets fancy,
                    a life sentence is a possibility. 
                    Is that what you want?

      Sully is cowed.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Did you know that Paige was sleeping
                    with Tom Pierson?

      Sully pauses a long time.  Then:

                                      SULLY
                    Yeah.  Yeah, I knew.

      And Abby and Stephen sigh, so disappointed.  Olivia looks at
      her watch.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Okay, we don't have a lot of time

                    attorneys and-

                                      SULLY
                    Wait, wait, I knew.  But I didn't
                    kill her.  I know what you think, I
                    know what it looks like.  But I did
                    not kill Paige.  Paige used to, she
                    slept around a lot before...This
                    guy, this Tom...I would have forgiven
                    her.  I did not kill her.  You have
                    to believe me.

                    Sully, there's not a lot I can-

                                      SULLY
                    I'm a soldier.  I've killed.  Dozens
                    of men.  Sometimes by tossing a
                    grenade but other times...I've looked
                    into the faces of men as I killed
                    them.  I know what it means to take
                    a life.  I couldn't do that...I don't
                    even know how a person could do that
                    to someone they loved.  I loved Paige. 
                    She was my best friend.  She knew
                    me, truly knew me like no one ever
                    has.  She was my best friend.  I
                    didn't kill her.

      And he's earnest and open and in so much pain.  Off Olivia...

                                      STEPHEN
                    What?

      And Huck produces a small velvet box.  Sets it on the desk.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Open it.

      Stephen does.  A selection of rings gleam up at him.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Three are antique, the rest are new. 
                    Clarity, cut and color are all
                    excellent.  He's offering you a
                    payment plan and a 30% discount
                    because I got him out of a bind once. 
                    You pick the one you like and we'll
                    send the rest back.

                                      STEPHEN
                    They're engagement rings.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Yes.

                                      STEPHEN
                    They're engagement rings.

                    For getting engaged.

                                      STEPHEN
                    They're engage-

                    already called Georgia, she's meeting
                    you there.  Pick a ring.  Marry the
                    girl.  Be normal.

                                      STEPHEN
                    You can't just...you're bullying me.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Georgia gave you six months to propose
                    or she was walking out. 

                                      STEPHEN
                    She was bullying me too.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    I've known you since law school. 
                    And since I met you, you've dated a
                    series of women I can only describe
                    as trashy and too young for you and
                    most of all stupid.  Georgia is funny
                    and fun and old enough and brilliant, 
                    and she loves you and your six months
                    is up and you know you want to marry
                    her, we all know you want to marry
                    her, so pick a damned ring already
                    so you can go find an alibi for Sully
                    Sinclair!

      Stephen is quiet.  Then, grudgingly, he points at a ring.

                                      STEPHEN
                    She'll like this one.

                                    HUCK
                    Excellent choice.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Your boss is a bully.

      But he's beaming.  He heads out with Huck.  Abby hangs back
      until he's gone.  Looks at Olivia, mournful.

                                    ABBY
                    I need the speech.

      Olivia comes to stand right in front of Abby.  Patient.

                                      OLIVIA
                          (the millionth time)
                    Stephen is not the man for you.  
                    Your love for him is misguided and
                    will only lead to humiliation and
                    pain.  If you were to confess your
                    love, it would only lead to
                      humiliation and pain.  If you were
                    to sleep with Stephen, it would only
                    lead to humiliation and pain.  You
                    are an amazing beautiful strong woman
                    and someday you are going to meet a
                    man who gets that.  He is the right
                    man for Georgia.  But for you? 

                                    ABBY
                      Humiliation and pain. 

                                      OLIVIA
                    Exactly.

                                    ABBY
                    Thank you.  I needed that.

      She's so sad.  Olivia hugs her.  Feeling for her.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Boys are stupid.

39INT. PRICE AND ASSOCIATES LOBBY - DAY39

      Olivia heads into the lobby.  To the sound of arguing.  A
      nervous Quinn blocks Julia who is trying to get past her.

                                      JULIA
                    I want to see her!

                                      QUINN
                    She's not available-

                                      JULIA
                    Let me through-

                                      OLIVIA
                    Julia.

      Quinn and Julia both turn to see Olivia.  Julia moves to
      her.  Desperate and emotional.

                                      JULIA
                    I want you to give him a message.

                    That's not appropriate.

                                      JULIA
                    Not appropriate?  Not appropriate? 
                    You came to me.  You came to me and
                    I know he sent you, I know you can
                    get him a message-

                                      OLIVIA
                    This conversation is over.  Please
                    leave.  

      Olivia presses the elevator button.

                                      JULIA
                    I quit my job, okay?  I did it.  Now 
                    please, give him a message-

      The elevator arrives.  Olivia holds open the door.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I will call security.

      And Julia gets on the elevator.  Olivia leans in, presses
      the button for the first floor.  As the door close...

                                      JULIA
                    I wasn't lying!  You hear me!  I
                    wasn't lying!  I wasn't-

      And the doors close.  Olivia breathes.  Then she turns to
      say something to Quinn.  But she never gets to say it because
      the other elevator dings.  Opens.  David is there, with
      homicide detective Wally and a few uniformed cops.

                                      DAVID
                    Time's up, Liv.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I have 40 minutes.

                                      DAVID
                    Fine.  Forty minutes.  And then I
                    want Sully Sinclair in handcuffs.

      Olivia sighs.  Points at the men, stern.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You stay out here.  Nobody crosses
                    that doorway.

      She turns to Quinn, speaks low.

                    been invaded.  Tell her time is up.

40EXT. MATTY'S PUB - DAY40

      Stephen waits outside the bar.  He's staring up at something. 
      Abby comes out of the bar, hanging up her cell. 

                                    ABBY
                    I showed Sully's picture to everyone
                    in the bar.  No one saw him the night
                    of the murder.  And Liv's got cops
                    in the lobby.  He's finished.

      But Stephen's staring up.  An odd smile on his face.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Maybe not.

      And he points.  Abby follows his finger.  And sees that he
    is pointing at a bank.  There's a security camera there,
      pointing down at the street.

41INT. BANK SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT41

      Stephen and Abby stand in the small office.  HOWIE (50s)
      sits with his back to a bank of video cameras.  Arms folded. 
      They're waiting.  And then Harrison hurries in.

                                      HARRISON
                    I have five hundred dollars in cash
                    and a pizza.

                                    ABBY
                    Howie, meet your five hundred dollars
                    and your pizza.

                                      HOWIE
                    Deep dish, sausage and mushroom?

                                      HARRISON
                    Yeah.

                                      HOWIE
                    Show me.

      Harrison opens the box, shows Howie the pizza.  Howie nods,
      takes the cash and counts it.  Stephen looks at his watch.

                                      STEPHEN
                    We have a ticking clock here, Howie-

      Finally Howie finishes counting the money.  Then he turns
      back to his video monitors.

                                      HOWIE (CONT'D)
                    Now, what do you wanna see?

                    towards Matty's Pub. Speed through...

      Howie does.  And then Abby points.

                    Stop!  Right there.

                    Is that...Sully?

      They stare at the monitors a beat.  A little stunned.

                                      STEPHEN
                    We're going to need a copy of that.

      Olivia nods at Abby who moves to the DVD player and pops in
      a disc.

                    We were able to verify your alibi.

                    You were.  That's good, right?

      But he looks wary.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Sully, you're the most decorated
                    soldier since the Vietnam War.  You
                    come from a family of soldiers.  You
                    make your living giving speeches for
                    the conservative right.  And you've
                    said it over and over again: Paige
                    was your best friend.  Not your lover. 
                    Your best friend.  

      Abby hits play.  And on the tape, we see security camera
      footage of Sully walking alone.  And then a man approaching
      him.  They greet each other with a long, intimate kiss and
      then head away together.  Olivia looks at Sully.  He stares
      into space.  Not wanting to watch.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Coming from where you come from,
                    being who you are, being a gay soldier
                    isn't something you feel you can
                    tell anyone.  But Paige knew, didn't
                    she?  She was your best friend.  She
                    knew you were gay, the two of you
                    had a deal.

                                      SULLY
                    You can't show that tape to anyone.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I need the name of the man you were
                    kissing.

                    No.  You can't show the tape, you
                    can't have a name.

                                      OLIVIA
                    It's your alibi.

                                      SULLY
                    No.  I'm not...you can't tell people
                    that I'm gay.  I'm a hero.

                    The police have a warrant for your
                    arrest.  All due respect, being gay
                    is no big deal compared to that. 

                                      SULLY
                    No.  I'm a hero.  I honor the uniform.

      He's intense, insistent.  Olivia leans in.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Sully?  Look at me.  This is who you

      And Sully hesitates.   Then:

                                      SULLY
                    No.

      And he gets up and heads out.

      Sully strides into the lobby.  Olivia, Abby and Stephen

47INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT47

      Quinn sits with Julia, who sleeps.  She looks up to see Olivia

                    secret room off the Oval Office where
                    they'd meet and I've read about the
                    White House, there is a little room-

                    If you read it, she read it.  People
                    are crazy, they get fixated on famous
                    people, they stalk them-

                                      QUINN
                    But I don't think she's crazy.

                    Tell me why.

                                      QUINN
                    Okay.  She tried to kill herself but
                    she didn't want to die.  She called
                    you right after she did it.  Because
                    she wanted him to find out she was
                    hurt and come see her.  She thought
                    he would do that.

      She hangs up.  Just stands there.  And then the door opens,
      Fitz strides in followed by Cyrus and two aides.  They're in
      tuxedos.  Fitz beams when he sees her.

                                    FITZ
                    Livvie!  This is a surprise.

      Olivia says nothing.  Just looks at him.  And Fitz's smile
      fades.  They stare at one another.

                    Sir, you have to give the toast to
                    the President of France in ten
                    minutes, maybe you can do this at

                                    FITZ
                    We need the room.

      And Fitz and Olivia stand frozen until Cyrus and the Aides
      have cleared the room.  When they hear the door close:

                                    FITZ (CONT'D)
                    Livvie-

      And Olivia is flying across the room at him.  Hitting his
      chest, shoving him, slapping his face.  Fury and energy
      propelling her as she hollers:

                                      OLIVIA
                    Sweet baby?  Sweet baby?  SWEET BABY?!

      And he doesn't fight her back, he just uses his hands to
      hold her off.  But finally, Olivia lands one good punch. 
      Right to Fitz's face.  His nose bloodies.  And then she runs
      out of energy.  She stands there, breathing in and out.  So
      incredibly hurt.  

                                    FITZ
                    You left me.

                                      OLIVIA
                    BECAUSE YOU ARE MARRIED!  Because
                    you said you wanted to try to dedicate
                    yourself to your marriage!

                    Because you're the leader of the
                    free world and I wanted you to be a
                    better man, I wanted you to be the
                    man I campaigned for, helped get
                    elected, VOTED FOR!

      Fitz crosses to her.  She backs away.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Don't touch me.  Don't you dare touch
                    me.  Don't you...

      But he's touching her.  Taking her face in his hands.  Kissing
      her.  She leans into him a beat.  Then she shoves him back.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Did you give her that dog? 

                                    FITZ
                    Livvie-

                                      OLIVIA
                    Did you give her that dog?  

      Fitz doesn't say anything.  He just moves in again.

                                    FITZ
                    I love you.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Shut up!  I believed you!  You clouded
                    my judgment!  You made me mistrust
                    my gut because I wanted to believe
                    you!  I destroyed that girl!  She
                    tried to kill herself! 

      The door opens, Cyrus enters.

                                      CYRUS
                    I just want to say that we can hear
                    you screaming from out-

      And he pauses.  Because Fitz has turned towards him and Cyrus
      can see his bloody nose.  Blood's now dripping onto his shirt. 
      And Cyrus goes from casual to official in an instant. 

                                      CYRUS (CONT'D)
                    Mr.  President, go to the residence
                    and change your shirt.  I'll send up
                    the medic.

                    Cy, she didn't meant to, it was an
                    accident-

                                      CYRUS
                    GO TO THE RESIDENCE AND CHANGE YOUR
                    SHIRT!

      And Fitz, with one last glance at Olivia, leaves by the
      residence door.  Olivia and Cyrus are alone.  He's staring
    at her the way you stare at a strange animal unlike any you've
      ever seen.

                                      CYRUS (CONT'D)
                    You attacked the President of the
                    United States.  You realize that's a
                    federal offense.  I could have the
                    Secret Service take you into custody.

                                      OLIVIA
                    And what will you tell the public? 
                    That the President's mistress beat
                    him up?  You do that, Cyrus.  Go
                    ahead.

                                      CYRUS
                    Mother of God. 

      And it's clear from Cyrus' face that he's shocked.  He looks
    at her, feeling sorry for her.  And she realizes...

                                      OLIVIA
                    You didn't know.  He tells you
                      everything...

                                      CYRUS
                    He didn't tell me this.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Because it didn't matter enough.

      And Olivia strides past him, out of the Oval Office.  Cyrus
      stands there.  Taking it in.

                                      CYRUS
                    Mother of God.

49INT. CHEZ HENRI - NIGHT49

    An elegant busy French restaurant.  Olivia enters, still a
      little frazzled but together.  Goes to the hostess.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Can you tell me what table-

                                      STEPHEN
                    Liv-

      Stephen's peering at her from the coat check room. 

                                      OLIVIA
                    Never mind.

      And she heads over to him.  

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    What are you...you're in a coat
                    closet.  What do you need, did you
                    forget the ring or something-

                                      STEPHEN
                    I have the ring.

      But he looks just sick with fear and panic.  So Olivia's
      tender with him.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You can do this.

                                      STEPHEN
                    I don't think I can.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Tell me.

                                      STEPHEN
                    What if...what if I mess it up? 
                    What if I marry her and I cheat or
                    she gets bored with me or...
                          (struggling)
                    What if she doesn't love me enough? 
                    I'm not a good guy, Livvie.  What if
                    she leaves me? 

      And that was incredibly hard for him to say.  Olivia takes
      his hands in hers.  Eyes on his.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    I gotta trust my gut.  And my gut's
                    what?  

                                      STEPHEN
                    Never wrong.

                    Never wrong.  And my gut tells me
                    that she's in this.  She's in this
                    with you.  And if it doesn't work,
                    it doesn't work.  But you have to
                    try.  Because if you try, if you
                    leap and you try and it doesn't work
                    out...it's not on you.  

      And he's starting to relax.

                                      STEPHEN
                    It's not on me.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You can do this.  

                                      STEPHEN
                    Okay, okay.  I can do this.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You can do this.  Go.  Be happy. 
                    Get some normal. 

    He kisses her cheek.  And then he heads out.  And Olivia
      peers out of the coat closet to watch as Stephen strides
      through the restaurant to a table where GEORGIA (30s), a
      pretty sweet woman, sits.  As Stephen gets down on one knee. 
      Pulls out a ring.  As he speaks, passionately but nervously. 
      And then Georgia squeals and kisses Stephen and he puts a
      ring on her finger.  As the whole restaurant applauds.

      And then, as Stephen beams with happiness, Olivia ducks back
      out of sight.  And then alone in the coat check room, Olivia
      starts to cry.  Really cry.  Painful gut-wrenching sobs. 
      Stephen's joy making her heartbreak so much more present. 
      She allows herself just a moment.  And then she pulls herself
      together, sucks her tears back in and heads out.

50INT. JULIA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT50

      Quinn sits by a sleeping Julia's bed.  She looks up.  Harrison
      comes in.

    He sits down.  Quinn looks at him a beat.

                                      QUINN
                    So...Sully's innocent.  He didn't
                    kill Paige?

                                      HARRISON
                    Yes.

                                      QUINN
                    Then who did?

                    Doesn't matter.  I mean, it matters. 
                    Just not to us.  All that matters to
                    us is Sully.  That's the job.

      A beat.

                                      QUINN
                    You said we were the good guys.

                    Really?  I mean...is Olivia?  Is she
                    one of the good guys?

                                      HARRISON
                    No.  
                          (off her disappointment)
                    I was a paralegal.  Olivia found me,
                    hired me and paid my way through law
                    school.  She's not one of the good
                    guys.  She's the best guy.

      Quinn takes that in.  Harrison tilts his head, measuring her
      temperature.  Then gently:

                                      HARRISON (CONT'D)
                    It's not enough to say it.  You gotta

      And they share a smile.

51INT. HOLDING CELL - NIGHT51

      Abby sits with Sully.  Sully is stone-faced, not looking at
      them.  Olivia rounds the corner and an officer lets her into
      the cell.  Abby approaches.

                                    ABBY
                    He's gone all military on us.  He
                    won't talk.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Give us a minute.

      Abby heads out.  Olivia sits down beside Sully.  He won't
      look at her.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Sully, I saw that kiss.  You love
                    that man.  Whoever he is.  You love
                    him.  You've been living with a secret
                    for really long time.  I know what
                    that's like.  I honestly do.  And
                    you think you're doing it for the
                    right reasons.  You think you're
                    doing it for your country and for
                    the people who look up to you.  But
                    the thing is, who you are, who you
                    choose to love, that shouldn't be a
                    secret.  It shouldn't have to be a
                    secret.  Should it?

      Sully doesn't say anything.  But he's listening.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    We may never know who killed Paige. 
                    But this isn't about you not going
                    to jail for Paige's murder.  This is
                    about you not living a lie.  Not
                    hiding.  This is about you standing
                    up and being who you are.  That's
                    honorable.  That's brave.  That's
                    heroic.  And that's who you are,
                    Sully.  You're a hero.  You fought a
                    war and you were braver than I can
                    ever imagine being.  This is just
                    another war.  For every gay person
                    who ever wore a uniform.  Be brave
                    now.

      just as she's standing...Sully looks up at her.

                    John Latimer.  That's his name.  And
                    I do.  Love him.  John Latimer.

      A cadre of reporters have gathered.  Cameras and lights. 
      And in front of them all stands Sully Sinclair in a full
      dress military uniform.  Calm.  Confident.  Strong.  A few
      soldiers stand with him.

                                      SULLY
                    I am honored to have served my
                    country.  I am honored to have been
                    injured serving my country.  And
                    most importantly, I am honored to be
                    a gay man who served my country.

      It's a moment.  A victory.  Flashbulbs go off.  Questions
      are shouted.  The press goes crazy.  And we move through the
      crowd to find, standing near the back...Olivia, Harrison,
      Abby, Stephen and Quinn.  Watching it all.  Proud.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Good work.

                                    ABBY
                    The other soldiers are a nice touch.

                                      STEPHEN
                    You have good ideas.

    He slings an arm around her.  And Abby breathes him in. 
      Olivia moves over to where David stands watching the press
      conference.  Hands him a thick envelope.

                                      OLIVIA
                    That's everything we gathered on
                    Paige's murder.  If it helps.

      Grudging, David takes it.  Then, a little too confident...

                                      DAVID
                    Don't worry, my guys will catch the
                    killer.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I hope so.  For Sully's sake.  

      Harrison looks at Quinn.  Checking her out.

                                      HARRISON
                    Can I buy you dinner tonight?

                                      QUINN
                    No.

      Olivia looks up.  Sees Cyrus.  Standing a little ways off
      from the crowd.  His Secret Service agent near his side. 
      She moves to him.

                                      OLIVIA
                    What.

                                      CYRUS
                    He wants to see you.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Tell him to go to hell.

                                      CYRUS
                    I'm just the messenger.

      And he starts to move away.  But Olivia stops him with:

                                      OLIVIA
                    Cyrus?  You tell him that he better
                    hope to God Julia Tannen doesn't
                    want to come forward with her story. 
                    Because she just became my client.

      Cyrus freezes.  The color draining from his face.  And Olivia
    is moving forward, disappearing into the crowd of reporters. 
      A gladiator in a suit.

                                                                              FADE OUT:
