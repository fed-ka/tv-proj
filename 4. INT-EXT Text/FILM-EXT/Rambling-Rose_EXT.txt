On a taxi arriving at the Delta terminal of Kennedy Airport.
A man in a well-tailored gray suit gets out of the taxi.
CUT TO a CLOSER SHOT of the man as he pays the cabbie. He is
WILLCOX HILLYER, the middle-aged "Buddy" of this story and
the observer through whose eyes it is seen. He has a dry,
ironic, rather agreeable manner and he should seem like
everyone's idea of a successful author, a slightly graying,
trim, still-youthful-looking fifty. The CAMERA follows him as
he walks into the terminal carrying a small travel bag.
CUT TO a shot of a big Delta jet making its final taxiing
turn and ROARING into a take-off.
CUT TO a shot of the red Ford driving from the airport.
A shot of the red Ford on Interstate 75, Atlanta skyline in
b.g.
On the red Ford as it speeds along a Georgia Interstate
through red clay hills in green springtime.
CUT TO a shot on Willcox Hillyer CLOSE ON his face in the
car. He is lost in reflection. A look of bitter sweet emotion
is on his face, an expression of sadness mixed with
amusement. As the CAMERA holds on his face, we hear again on
the track Louis Armstrong's great version of "DIXIE," or
music of comparable power, beauty and nostalgic evocation.
Now the music is stronger, much stronger than behind the
titles, we are beginning to hear it full force.

BLURRED SCREEN FLASHBACK:
A shot of a thirteen-year-old boy on the front porch of a
house in the sleepy Depression South of many years ago. He is
BUDDY, Willcox Hillyer as a boy. The MUSIC continues as he
shades his eyes to look at something far away.
CUT TO a LONG POV shot of a young and very pretty blonde girl
walking slowly up an oak-shaded driveway. A ZOOMAR LENSE
takes us TOWARD her. She is carrying a cardboard suitcase
tied with a string. Her clothes are cheap, her shoes are
dusty, runs are in her stockings. She is sweaty, tired and
seems very nervous. ROSE is a very attractive girl, but her
primary quality is not sexiness, but an innocence and
sweetness. She pauses to wipe sweat from her forehead with
the back of her hand and nervously moistens her lips as she
stares ahead uncertainly at the "nice" Southern home which to
her seems very grand. It is apparent she is badly frightened
and apprehensive about what lies ahead. She is also exhausted
from the heat and a long hot walk in the Southern sun. She
blinks at perspiration, swallows in anxiety again and forces
herself to walk on.
CUT TO a shot of Buddy on the porch. Expressionless,
unreadable, neither friendly nor hostile, he stares with an
even gaze directly into the CAMERA. He has his hands on his
hips in a distinctive way that we will later see is a
mannerism of his father's.
Buddy tries to imitate the style of his father, not always
with complete success. Unreadable as a Sphinx, he stands
there, waiting.
CUT TO a POV shot of Rose at the foot of the porch steps. A
tentative little smile is on her face. It is very plain she
is nervous and frightened.
ROSE
Hello. I'm Rose, and I've come to
live with you and your family.
Silence. The damn boy says nothing. A trifle crestfallen,
Rose moistens his lips and swallows. She ventures another
little smile and the CAMERA follows her as she walks up the
steps. The at-times-insufferable Buddy comes into the shot.
He still has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his
expression is inscrutable, neither friendly nor hostile.
ROSE (CONT'D)
What's your name? What do they call
you?
Finally, the boy speaks -- and he is not so bad. He's a child
after all.
BUDDY
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.
ROSE
(greatly reassured, a real
smile now)
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice
name, I like it. I am real pleased
to meet you.
(solemnly holds out her
hand, they shake)
Hey, look, do you think you got a
cold drink of ice water somewhere?
BUDDY
Sure. Let me take your suitcase.
A warm and beautiful smile comes on Rose's face and a little
twinkle comes into her eyes. The innocence and sweetness are
not lost, that is never lost, but this is a girl who likes
boys and men.
ROSE
You're sweet.
CUT TO a shot of Rose on the stone patio of the Hillyer
house, an attractive area with outdoor furniture and
crabapple tree limbs overhead. Rose is busy sweeping. The
CAMERA PANS to follow her and we pick up Mrs. Hillyer,
Mother. It is a nice day and she is studying out on the
patio, books and notebooks piled around. Rose glances down
curiously at her.
ROSE
What are you studying now, Mrs.
Hillyer?
MOTHER
More history, Rose.
ROSE
Are you going to get your degree
soon?
MOTHER
Well, I am working on my thesis.
ROSE
(as she busily sweeps)
It must be wonderful to be so
smart. I don't see how you do it,
reading all those books, learning
all that stuff.
MOTHER
(looks up, and gently)
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't
you go sit down somewhere and drink
a Co-Cola?
ROSE
(smiles, trusts and knows
Mother now, not at all
afraid of her)
You're so sweet.
Rose again busily sweeps.
MOTHER
Really, why don't you go sit down
somewhere?
ROSE
I like to work. I don't mind work.
It's the least I can do after all
you and Mr. Hillyer have done for
me.
(stares worshipfully at
Mother)
You're so sweet. There never was
nobody like you.
MOTHER
(gently)
Well, you run on now.
ROSE
Yes, Ma'am.
Exit Rose. Mother adjusts her notebook and turns the page of
a history book as she resumes her studies. We hear the sound
of an approaching CAR and she glances up.
CUT TO a shot of a slightly worn-out 1932 Model-A Ford as it
rolls up the driveway of the Hillyer home, Daddy at the
wheel.
ANOTHER ANGLE, on Daddy as he gets out of the Model-A. He has
his usual straw hat on the back of his head. The CAMERA
FOLLOWS him as he walks onto the patio.
DADDY
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful
day.
MOTHER
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd
work outside.
DADDY
How goes it, darlin'?
MOTHER
Slow, hon. But at least I can
concentrate now that Rose is here.
DADDY
What do you think of her, honey?
Mother doesn't answer, she writes on, head bowed over her
notebook. We see in this shot the hearing aid she wears and
hear from it a faint BUZZ.
DADDY (CONT'D)
Turn up your hearing aid.
MOTHER
What?
DADDY
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at
me like a snake.
MOTHER
(adjusts hearing aid)
Oh. Did you say something?
DADDY
I asked you what you think of
Rosebud, now that she's been here a
while.
MOTHER
Honey, she's perfect. She works all
the time and she's wonderful with
the children. And they love her,
even Brother likes her though he
won't admit it. I think she's just
perfect.
DADDY
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
MOTHER
And she's such a good-hearted
thing, there isn't an ounce of harm
or malice in her.
DADDY
Well, I'll admit I don't see any
flies on her yet.
MOTHER
There are no flies on Rose, I don't
know what you're talking about.
DADDY
Well, she must have done something
to encourage those scoundrels in
Birmingham, even if she did run
away from them.
CUT TO Mother and Daddy on the patio. Daddy stands up.
DADDY
Well, let's hope for the best,
darlin'.
MOTHER
Hope for the best? I don't
understand all this skepticism. I
thought you liked Rose.
DADDY
I love Rosebud, I am wild about
Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't
turn out to be a hidden hotcha
character, that's all. We have
growing children in the house.
MOTHER
Hotcha character. If I had to live
with your cynicism, I wouldn't want
to live at all. What you can't
understand is that the creative
forces of the universe are
positive, not negative.
DADDY
(gently, his irony is
mild)
All right, darlin', don't go off
into the fourth dimension.
MOTHER
I'm not in the fourth dimension --
(points a finger at him)
-- you are in the fourth dimension,
when you allow skepticism and doubt
to take control. As Blake said, if
God had doubt the sun would go out.
DADDY
(again gentle irony,
always courtly toward
her)
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I
don't understand these deeper
things the way you do.
MOTHER
(reaches up, takes his
hand)
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a
real home.
DADDY
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'.
As long as you're around, I'm sure
the sun wouldn't dare go out.
CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy as they walk out onto the
patio of the house. Rose walks down the steps to the flower
garden and Buddy follows.
ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose and Buddy as Rose picks a red rose and
puts it in her hair.'
ROSE
Did your Momma really give you
castor oil?
BUDDY
Yeah.
ROSE
(puts an arm around his
shoulders)
You're my sweetheart.
CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy waiting in a Model A. Rose is
smiling, happy to be going out. The red rose is prominent in
her hair, Daddy walks INTO THE SHOT, gets into the driver's
seat of the car, He glances in a wry manner at the flower in
her hair.
DADDY
What have you got in your hair,
girl?
ROSE
My rose. It's kind of like a motto.
People will say, there comes Rose
with her rose.
Daddy gives her another wry stare and starts the Model A.
CUT TO a shot of the Model A going down the driveway.
ANOTHER SHOT or two of the Model A on the quiet summer
streets of a sleepy little town in the Depression South of
years ago.
CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the car. Buddy is
in the middle. Daddy is staring expressionlessly straight
ahead. His tone is sternly neutral as he speaks.
DADDY
You were up late last night,
Brother.
BUDDY
Well, a little.
DADDY
Reading dirty comic bocks.
(glances shrewdly at him)
And you admitted it?
BUDDY
(a trifle uncomfortable)
Well, yeah.
Both Rose and Buddy begin to look increasingly tense.
Hawkshaw the Detective is on the scent. Daddy stares ahead.
DADDY
You were up late last night, too,
Rose.
ROSE
(meekly)
Yes, sir. I had to go to the
bathroom.
A long pause, as Daddy stares ahead. His expression is
inscrutable.
DADDY
(finally, "casually")
Sometimes I think I was born to be
a detective. I get a feeling about
things. I'm not always right, but
often I am.
CUT TO a shot of the Model A as it stops for a red light.
CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the car. Daddy
turns and stares sternly at Buddy.
DADDY
Son, was Rose in your room last
night?
BUDDY
(scared, but a good liar)
No. Why should Rose be in my room?
Daddy sternly scans them both. They stare back "innocently"
at him. Finally he seems to accept it.
DADDY
I can't imagine why. It was just a
thought.
Daddy shifts gears and faces front. Buddy glances upward in
relief, as if to say, "Wow, that was close."
DADDY (CONT'D)
Where do you want me to let you
out, Rose?
ROSE
Oh, anywhere downtown.
DADDY
You don't know where you're going?
ROSE
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and
there.
CUT TO a shot of the Model A as it stops off the main street
of a small sleepy Southern town.
CUT TO a shot through the side window on Rose, Buddy and
Daddy.
DADDY
Is this ill right?
ROSE
It'll do just fine.
(gets out of car)
Bye-bye, see you later.
Rose waves goodbye and walks off down the sidewalk, swinging
her hips and her pocketbook,
CUT TO a front shot of Daddy and Buddy in the car as they
stare after Rose.
CUT TO a shot of POV Daddy and Buddy of Rose walking along.
MUSIC.
CUT TO Daddy and Buddy. Daddy slowly shakes his head, shifts
gears..
CUT TO a shot of the Model A as it rolls along the main
street.
ANOTHER SHOT of the Model A as it abruptly turns a corner.
ON the Model A as it abruptly turns around corner. Evidently
it is circling the block.
CUT TO a shot of Rose as she walks along, swinging her hips
and her pocketbook and smiling at whoever she sees. She
passes a few people and she smiles cheerfully at them -- the
men stare with a flat interest at her and the women frown,
but she smiles at one and all.
CUT TO a shot of the Model A as it creeps along.
On Daddy and Buddy in the car.
DADDY
They might arrest her. I doubt it, but they might.
CUT TO a shot of Rose as she walks up to a bus stop. A fairly
WELL-DRESSED MAN with a door-to-door salesman kit is standing
there. Rose glances at him then sidles up alongside him as if
she's waiting for a bus. He glances at her for a moment with
interest, but doesn't want to stare, looks away. We see the
Model A stop in the background of the SHOT.
CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy in the car, watching Rose.
CUT TO a shot of Rose and the Young Salesman. Rose glances at
the man, glances at him again, then sighs and speaks.
ROSE
My feet sure do hurt.
YOUNG SALESMAN
(turns to her with a slow
smile)
Oh, yeah?
CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy in the car, watching.
CUT TO a LONG POV SHOT of Rose and the Young Salesman. They
are talking amiably. Both are smiling.
CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy.
DADDY
She has made contact.
CUT TO ANOTHER POV SHOT of Rose and the Young Salesman. It is
another LONG SHOT. MUSIC ON TRACK. They are smiling, talking.
The Young Salesman seems to ask Rose a question. She nods and
takes his arm and they walk off.
CUT TO Daddy and Buddy. Daddy is staring pensively at the
scene.
DADDY
I never saw anything like it. How
did she pick him up so fast?
BUDDY
I don't know.
DADDY
The girl strikes like a cobra.
Slowly shaking his head, Daddy starts the car.
A shot of Rose and the Young Salesman as they walk along. She
is holding his arm and they are smiling and talking as if the
best of friends. We hear MUSIC ON THE TRACK. The MUSIC
continues over the following MONTAGE OF SHOTS.
ON Rose as she walks down a sidewalk in late afternoon with
Buster and still another man, a tall fellow in a Coca-Cola
Delivery Man's uniform or shirt. Rose seems to be innocently
happy, but the men appear to be having a mild dispute.
ON Rose getting into Busters car as Buster holds the door for
her, smiling. The COCA-COLA DELIVERY MAN is left on the
sidewalk, disappointed.
CUT TO a shot of Rose in the car eating barbecue with Buster.
She is talking animatedly and he seems enchanted with her. It
is dusk.
CUT TO a shot of a car pulling up in the driveway of the
Hillyer house. Rose gets out, waves goodbye to Buster. It is
night. End MUSIC.
A SHOT of Mother on the patio studying. It is a sunny
afternoon. Mother looks up idly, looks back down at her
notebook, then looks up again with a frown.
CUT TO A POV SHOT of a SCRUFFY-LOOKING KAN as he darts behind
one tree to another. The Scruffy-looking Man does not seem
sinister, but he definitely is scruffy.
ON Mother. Frowning, she puts down her notebook and rises,
walks toward the door of the kitchen.
CUT TO a shot of the Scruffy-looking Man. Be is half-crouched
behind a big oak, peering at the Hillyer house. We hear the
approach of a car and the man looks over his shoulder.
CUT TO a shot of Daddy in the Model A. The TIRES SCREECH as
he puts on the brakes.
CUT TO a shot of the Scruffy-looking Man as he turns and
runs.

Come back here, sir! Come back

CUT TO a shot of Daddy running after him.
CUT TO A FINAL SHOT of the Scruffy-looking Man as he leaps a
hedge in full stride.
CUT TO a shot of a worried-looking Mother on the front porch
of the house. Buddy and a meek-looking Rose are in the
background in the doorway. A weary, out-of-breath Daddy comes
INTO THE SHOT and walks up the steps, straw hat in hand.
DADDY
I couldn't catch him. He ran like a
deer.
Daddy fixes a stern glance on Rose. As he does so, Mother and
Buddy also turn and look at her. Rose smiles wanly.
ROSE
I don't know him.
DISSOLVE TO:
CUT TO a shot of a sullen-looking young boy on the front
porch. He is poorly dressed. He rings the doorbell. This is
BILLY.
ON Mother as she opens the front door. A sullen Billy stares
at her.
MOTHER
Yes?
BILLY
Is Rose here?
MOTHER
She must have gone out for a walk
with the children.
BILLY
(sullenly)
Well, I got to see her.
MOTHER
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but
Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to
have callers during working hours.
BILLY
(sullenly)
Where is she?
MOTHER
I said she isn't here. NOW you go
home. Be a nice boy and go home.
Gently but firmly, Mother shuts the door in Billy's face.
A SHOT of Billy frustrated on the front porch. Sadly,
reluctantly, he turns and walks off the porch down the steps.
CUT TO a shot from the POV of the children, on Daddy on the
back porch as the lights blaze on. He wears his bathrobe and
has a big shotgun in his hands. Now he speaks in a loud,
clear and very angry voice.
DADDY
All right, I have got a Parker
shotgun here and it is loaded and
the trigger is cocked and wherever
you birds are and whatever you are
doing you had better get the hell
out of here goddamned quick!
A sudden total silence ensues, then a sudden CRASHING in the
bushes as the "birds" take off.
DADDY (CONT'D)
And do not come back, you sons of
bitches! Stay away from my house
and home and my wife and children
or I'll blow your goddamned heads
off!
A shot of Daddy behind the wheel of the model-A. Rose lies
pale and exhausted on Mother's shoulder on the front seat. A
trace of bloody gauze can be seen in her mouth and her eyes
are closed. Buddy is on the back seat.
ROSE
(a whisper, muffled by the
bloody gauze)
Never again, never again...
MOTHER
(with pity, gently)
I know it was bad, honey. I'm
sorry...
ROSE
No more dentists, no more
dentists...
MOTHER
It'll get better now.
CUT TO a shot of the Model-A in the driveway of the Hillyer
home. Mother helps Rose out of the car, but Rose can't stand
on her feet. Daddy has to catch her from falling. Daddy picks
her up in his arms and carries her up the steps as Buddy runs
ahead to open the front door.
DISSOLVE TO:
A shot of Mother and Daddy and Buddy on the patio. It is a
beautiful sunny morning. Mother and Daddy are seated at an
outdoor table about to have coffee. Daddy is opening mail and
Buddy, in the b.g., is gluing up a kite. Enter a smiling and
healthy Rose with orange juice, toast, cups and coffee on a
tray.
DADDY
Good morning, Rose. And how do you
feel today?
ROSE
Wonderful. Except I can touch the
place back there with my tongue, I
wouldn't even know I had that tooth
pulled.
DADDY
(dryly, as he looks at
mail)
Well, I know it, I just got the
bill for it.
ROSE
Boy, for four or five days there I
didn't think I'd live. But I'm my
old self again!
DADDY
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange
voices in the night, Rose.
ROSE
Oh, no, sir.
MOTHER
Rose has learned her lesson,
haven't you, Rose?
ROSE
Yes, ma'am.
DISSOLVE TO:
CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy in the Model-A. Daddy stares
grimly ahead. Buddy steals a worried glance at him.
CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the Model A. Daddy
stares grimly ahead, silent. Buddy looks solemn. Rose is
badly frightened and still coughing. Finally she ventures a
little smile and speaks to Daddy.
ROSE
I got an awful cold, I think I'm
sick.
Daddy is silent, his eyes fixed ahead.
CUT TO a shot of the Model A as it turns onto the Hillyer
driveway.
CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the car. She tries
again.
ROSE
I didn't mean to bite him. He was
hitting Horton with a blackjack in
the meanest way and... and I bit
him accidental.
DADDY
(stops the car, turns to
Rose)
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm
on duty at the desk and who knows a
quest might arrive. I will see you
at suppertime, Rose.
ROSE
(a feeble smile)
I didn't mean to bite him, I really
didn't.
DADDY
I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
ROSE
(feebly)
Yes, air.
CUT TO a shot of a shaky, slumped Rose going up the steps

see them shaking hands with the Minister. Rose smiles
sweetly, modestly.
CUT TO a shot of the Model A driving up in the driveway of
the Hillyer house.
ANOTHER ANGLE on them all as they get out of the car. Rose
takes Doll's hand with one hand and Waski's hand with the
other.
ROSE
All right, we'll play monopoly
then.
Mother, Daddy and Buddy watch Rose go up the steps with Doll
and Waski.
MOTHER
She's like a different person.
Being so sick made a big impression
on her. I really think she's
learned a lesson.
DADDY
Um-hmm.
(waits as Mother goes on
up steps, then turns to
Buddy and in a low tone)
Come with me, Brother. I want to
show you something.
CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy in a rose garden below the
windows of the house.
It is Hawkshaw the Detective and his Unwilling Assistant.
Daddy solemnly points to dim marks in the flower bed.
DADDY
See that, son? Now this is a heel,
see, and there, that's the ball of
a foot. Someone has been walking
here.
BUDDY
(reluctantly)
Well, it's not very plain.
DADDY
That is because it rained recently,
the rain has obscured the evidence.
But you could still take plaster
casts of these footprints, then
match up the plaster casts with
whosever shoes they are, and that
way you could catch him --
understand?
BUDDY
But how would you find him?
DADDY
Well. Well, what I mean is, you
could prove it was his shoes if you
did catch him. But look this,
Brother, it is even more
interesting. Look at this mark
here, and that mark over there. Now
wouldn't you say those marks are
the marks of a ladder?
BUDDY
Well, I don't know.
(trying to sound like a
fellow detective, but
doesn't want Rose to get
caught)
No, I don't know, Daddy, I think
the rain has obscured it.
DADDY
True, but if you look sharply you
can see that those marks are the
marks of a ladder. Now let's go
back to the garage and see if the
ladder has been tampered with.
CUT TO a POV shot of the garden below as seen by Daddy from
the window. We see lying on the ground BILLY, the Sulky Boy
who scared Mother. He wears only undershorts and is groaning,
holding his leg, which evidently he has injured in jumping
from the window.
A shot of the Model A coming up the driveway of the Hillyer
House. It is late afternoon.
CUT TO a shot of Daddy getting out of the car. He has a
triumphant little smile on his face.
A shot of Daddy as he walks onto the patio, a rolled-up copy
of the Glenville Tribune in his hand and his straw hat on the
back of his head. He definitely has a triumphant expression.
Buddy on the patio notices it.
CUT TO a shot of Buddy outside on the patio, listening
intently at the window. He leans forward with a keen
interest, eyes wide.
CUT TO a shot of Doll walking up onto the patio with
schoolbooks. The CAMERA follows her as she walks over to
Buddy, who is crouched down eavesdropping at another window.
She whispers to him.
DOLL
What's goin' on?
BUDDY
Rose says she's goin' to have a
baby and she sure looks it, but I
don't think so.
DOLL
A baby... and she isn't even
married.
BUDDY
That's the least of her troubles.
Rose had a rare tropic disease and
the little tubes in her that babies
swim down are all stopped up, she
told me all about it.
DOLL
If it isn't a baby... what is it?
DISSOLVE TO:
A shot of the Model A parked on the street outside a hospital
in a small Southern town. We see Daddy slowly pacing back and
forth in front of the hospital entrance, his head bowed and
his hands clasped behind him.
ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSER on the Model A. Buddy sits in the
middle on the front seat, Mother is at the window. Doll and
Waski are on the back seat. They all are staring with pale
worry at the pacing Daddy fifty feet away. All are
frightened, Mother is very pale. Doll has a tiny handkerchief
to her eyes and is half crying. Even Waski is very scared.
WASKI
(seems on verge of tears)
Mother... is Rose going to die?
MOTHER
(in a trembly voice)
No, Waski, she won't die, because
we are praying for her.
CUT TO a shot of Daddy from the POV of the car. He looks at
his wristwatch, frowns and walks into the entrance of the
hospital.
ANOTHER ANGLE, on them all in the car. They wait, pale and
silent. Doll sniffles in her handkerchief.
DOLL
Why is it taking so long?
BUDDY
Here comes Daddy.
CUT TO a POV shot of Daddy as he slowly walks up to the car,
his straw hat in his hand.
CUT TO a shot of Mother CLOSE on her face as she stares at
her husband as if trying to read the news on his face. A tiny
frown comes on her forehead as icy fear comes in her eyes.
ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE on Daddy as he walks up to the window of
the car, hat in hand. A trace of tears can be seen in his
eyes, but when he speaks his voice is calm.
DADDY
(philosophically)
Well, I thought I'd seen the limit,
but these are the most great, gaga
epizootics she's ever had.
ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy and them all. In pale fear, mother
stares at him, uncertain what has happened.
MOTHER
How is she?
DADDY
Fine.
As mother sighs in heartfelt relief...
DISSOLVE TO:
CUT TO a shot of Buddy on the patio. He has eight or nine
gourds on an outdoor table and is cutting round holes in them
and emptying out the seed. He glances up as Rose walks up to
him, pocketbook in hand. She seems a little sad. But she
smiles at him.
ROSE
Hi, Buddy.
(puts an arm around his
shoulders)
How's my sweetheart who never told
on me when I was bad?
BUDDY
Okay.
ROSE
(picks up a hollowed out
gourd)
Makin' homes for purple martins,
huh? We had 'em on the farm.
They're the prettiest things.
That's what I wish I was, a bird.
Just fly around catch bugs and have
a lot of fun.
BUDDY
What are you going to do, Rose?
ROSE
Take a little walk with me, huh?
CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy on a beautiful summer day
walking in the garden behind the Hillyer house. They walk up
to an empty rabbit hutch. The hutch is made of rough lumber
and chicken wire and has cubicles for about a dozen rabbits.
ROSE
(as she stares at the
empty hutch)
I guess I'll work as a waitress,
Buddy. I done that before and it
got me in worse trouble than you
could know, but I can't stay here
no more. Why did you get rid of
your rabbits, Buddy?
BUDDY
They're dumb things. I got tired of
them.
ROSE
(smiles, touches chicken
wire)
Did you know when I was a child we
had pretty near five hundred
rabbits?
BUDDY
Five hundred rabbits?
ROSE
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates
all over. It was Daddy's dream. He
was goin' to get rich raisin'
rabbits. It was what killed Daddy.
He didn't drown hisself till a long
time later after Momma and Lunette
died of typhoid, but it was them
rabbits what killed him.
BUDDY
How did the rabbits kill him?
ROSE
He thought he could sell 'em, but
nobody but country folks eat
rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got
no money. We had to eat them dern
rabbits our own selves. Every dern
one, and it took about four years
to eat 'em all up.
BUDDY
(a little smile)
Well, that doctor said you got
protein somewhere and I guess he
was right.
ROSE
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But
later on after Momma died and Daddy
wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin',
I sure would of been glad for a
little rabbit stew. You know, I
oughtn't to of told you about what
Daddy done when I was a child.
Until them rabbits ruined him, he
was a real good man, Buddy.
BUDDY
What was your mother like?
ROSE
A saint just like your own mother.
She's up in heaven right now, her
and Lunette, there ain't no doubt
about it.
ANOTHER ANGLE as Buddy and Rose walk away hand in hand away
from the rabbit hutch.
BUDDY
Maybe it was eating all those
rabbits that made you sexy, Rose.
ROSE
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to
me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito
bite.
(stops, smiles, puts an
arm around his shoulders)
I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't
want sex, Buddy, girls want love.

HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM NIGHT
A shot of Mother and Daddy in the Hillyer living room late at
night. Mother sits with a worried expression on a chair, a
kimono around her shoulders. Daddy is pacing worriedly in
pajamas and a bathrobe. He looks at his wristwatch.
DADDY
It's twenty after one.
MOTHER
I don't understand it. Even in the
wild days she was never as late as
this.
DADDY
I'm afraid it's my fault. I made
her feel guilty this morning --
(glances around, sees
something in doorway)
Brother, what are you doing up?
ANOTHER ANGLE on Buddy in pajamas as he enters the living
room.
BUDDY
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose
come in?
DADDY
No, she hasn't.
(frowns, looks around)
I think I hear a car.
CUT TO a shot of a 1930's automobile in the Hillyer driveway
at night as it drives up and stops before the front steps.
ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE on Rose and Dave Wilkie in the car. Here
DAVE is much YOUNGER, of course, and a rather handsome man in
a stolid way. Even though he is younger than when we saw him
on the plane, he is quite a bit older than Rose. Rose's eyes
are opened wide, she is a bit breathless, obviously something
important has happened. Dave stares at her as if fascinated,
almost as if awed.
DAVE
(rather stiffly)
I want to thank you for a wonderful
afternoon and evenin'. Can I see
you in the mornin'?
ROSE
(a bit breathless)
Yes. Year you can, you sure can.
CUT TO a shot of Rose on the steps. Happy as a clam, she
turns and waves at Dave in the car, then goes on up the
steps.
A shot of Rose, Dave, Buddy, Doll and Waski at a picnic
celebration outside the church by a running brook.
The scene should be beautiful in summertime. We see a
barbecue pit, homemade ice cream in the metal can, other
picnic things. A happy Rose is kissing first Buddy, then
Doll, then Waski. Dave smiles fondly, but rather stiffly at
her.
ROSE
And now Waski, are you and Buddy
and Dolly ready for some ice cream,
huh? Do you like picnics or don't
you?
WASKI
We like 'em! We love 'em!
DAVE
Well, it isn't a picnic, honey.
It's a barbecue.
ROSE
(a little smile)
Okay.
DAVE
A picnic doesn't involve roast
meat, hon. At a barbecue you have a
lot of roast meat.
CUT TO a shot CLOSE on Buddy as he stares pensively at Dave.
The CAMERA stays on him as we hear VOICES OVER. Rose is
happy, Dave phlegmatic.
ROSE (V.O.)
Well, all I know is there's ice
cream. And I'm gonna have me a
plate right now!
DAVE (V.O.)
Better wait, hon. It'll spoil your
appetite. Have some barbecue first.
The CAMERA stays on Buddy, as he stares pensively at Dave. He
has no expression on his face at all.
DISSOLVE TO:
A shot of Rose and Dave bidding goodbye to the Hillyers.
Daddy, Mother, Buddy, Doll and Waski are in the model A. Rose
is obviously on the verge of tears as Dave speaks solemnly to
Daddy.
DAVE
Well, we are off to Savannah, Mr.
Hillyer. No more police work, I'm
getting in the construction field.
DADDY
Good luck, Dave. And good luck to
you, too, Rosebud.
ROSE
(begins crying)
Oh, Mr. Hillyer! I just can't stand
to say goodbye!
Daddy starts the Model A.
ROSE (CONT'D)
I love you all! Goodbye, Buddy!
Goodbye, Dolly! Goodbye, Waski!
ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose as she weeps and waves the
handkerchief.
ROSE (CONT'D)
Goodbye! Goodbye!
DISSOLVE TO:
A shot of Daddy and Mother in the Model A as Daddy drives. We
see Doll and Waski solemn on the back seat, but Buddy is not
visible.
DADDY
Well, thank God we are rid of her
at last. And the best thing of all
is that she's happy. The little nut
is happy, she found Mr. Right in
the nick of time!
MOTHER
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course
Dave doesn't have her life force,
not at all. There isn't much
furniture in his house, just a
table and one or two chairs,
whereas Rose has furniture coming
out of the windows.
DADDY
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
MOTHER
(slowly nods)
Yes, I think so. He adores her,
it's almost pitiful the way he
worships her. I just hope she isn't
too much for him.
Mother pauses, frowning, she has her doubts, looks over her
shoulder.
MOTHER (CONT'D)
What do you think, Brother?
Mother frowns in surprise.
CUT TO a POV shot of Buddy on the back seat of the car. Now
it is clear why we couldn't see him in the other shot. Be is
lying down on the seat of the car with his Sunday coat pulled
over his head.
ANOTHER ANGLE on Mother and Buddy, Doll, Waski. Buddy lies on
the seat, motionless with his coat over his head.
MOTHER (CONT'D)
What's the matter with him?
DOLL
(seems awed, staring down
at Buddy)
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
CUT TO ANOTHER ANGLE on Mother, from the front as she slowly
turns back and stares thoughtfully ahead. The shot is also on
Daddy. They both stare ahead in pensive silence. Finally
Mother speaks.
MOTHER
(rather sadly)
Maybe Brother is right. Maybe so.

END OF FLASHBACK
ON Willcox Hillyer behind the wheel of the Hertz car. He is
staring pensively ahead, a faint trace of tears in his eyes.
It is a very faint trace, a look of mild irony and amusement
is on his face.
WILLCOX HILLYER
(dryly, to himself)
Mr. Right. Dave Wilkie.
Willcox slowly shakes his head.
CUT TO a shot of the red Ford as it takes a turn-off from an
Interstate.
CUT TO a shot of the red Ford as it drives into a rather
bustling little Southern city that does not look at all like
the "Glenville" we have seen. A lot of traffic, new roads,
filling stations, prosperity. It could be Rome, Georgia as it
is today.
ANOTHER SHOT of the red Ford going past a modern Holiday Inn
in the city.
ON the red Ford as it turns into a familiar driveway, that of
the old Hillyer home.
But insofar as possible it looks different now, like a relic
from the past.
Maybe the house needs painting, the garden is in weeds -- the
place is not exactly dilapidated, but it is marked by time.
A SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he gets out of the red Ford and
walks up the familiar steps of the front porch, travel bag in
hand.
ON Willcox Hillyer at the front door. He tries the knob,
opens the door and goes inside.
CUT TO a shot of Daddy putting out seed for birds on a table
on the patio. Daddy now is a very old man, but his
personality and style are the same as ever. He looks up with
a stern frown as Willcox Hillyer comes out on the patio.
DADDY
Well, you rascal, where'd you come
from?
WILLCOX HILLYER
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
DADDY
About as good as can be expected
with one foot in the grave. Good to
see you, son.
(they shake hands)
Did you bring any of that Yankee
whisky with you?
WILLCOX HILLYER
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's
Scotch.
DADDY
It's Yankee whisky to me.
Daddy takes him by the arm, leads him back into the kitchen.
DADDY (CONT'D)
How do you stand it up there, boy,
in all that ice and snow? What are
you, a polar bear?
CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as they walk with
their drinks out to the patio.
WILLCOX HILLYER
What's all this about Rose? What do
you mean, you heard from her in a
manner of speaking?
DADDY
Oh, I heard from her, I got a
letter from her, she's fine. But
there is some sad news.
WILLCOX HILLYER
What sad news? Did her cancer come
back?
DADDY
Oh, no, no, she got all over that.
Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
WILLCOX HILLYER
Is her husband sick or something?
DADDY
No, it's another thing. I was going
to write you about it, but since
you were coming down anyway I
thought I'd wait till you got here.
What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
ANOTHER ANGLE on Willcox Hillyer and the aged Daddy as they
sit on the patio sipping whisky. Willcox Hillyer is not
disturbed or worried about Rose, Daddy has been very casual
and offhand about it and he has no inkling of what the news
really is.
WILLCOX HILLYER
The pitiful son of a bitch said
Rose was a nymphomaniac.
DADDY
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed
you?
WILLCOX HILLYER
You're damn right it incensed me,
the miserable bastard. He also said
the kikes and the niggers have
taken over Washington. D.C.
DADDY
(nods somberly)
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's
pitiful like you say. When he lost
Rose it ruined the man, it
destroyed him totally when he lost
Rose.
WILLCOX HILLYER
He didn't lose her, he threw her
away.
DADDY
Yes, I guess he did. He threw her
away and it was the mistake of his
life.
WILLCOX HILLYER
(staring off pensively
into space)
You know, I don't know this town
any more. All this traffic, new
buildings, prosperity...
(pauses, almost as if in
pain)
Where have the years gone, Daddy?
Where is the little town I knew as
a boy?
DADDY
At rest in the creative universe
with Mother, son.
WILLCOX HILLYER
(a little smile)
That's what she would say herself.
DADDY
(simply, he is not
emoting)
A wonderful woman, boy.
WILLCOX HILLYER
It always gives me a funny feeling
to come home. Dear old Southland.
Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --
(a fond little smile)
-- except you, you're still here.
DADDY
(matter-of-factly)
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed
my welcome already.
WILLCOX HILLYER
It's funny you would mention Rose,
I was thinking about her all the
way up in the car.
(gives him a glance)
Or maybe it isn't so funny.
DADDY
(as if in previous
thought)
I'm older than hell, boy. But this
Yankee whisky is mighty fine, I'll
say that.
WILLCOX HILLYER
All right, Daddy. We have our
drink, we're out on the patio, you
have prepared me for it. Rose's
cancer has come back, hasn't it?
DADDY
(simply, quietly)
No, son, she is dead.
WILLCOX HILLYER
(numb with shock, for a
moment can't speak or
think)
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she
died?
DADDY
I am afraid so, son. About a week
ago. Her husband phoned me, she had
asked him to call me if anything
happened.
WILLCOX HILLYER
(in awful shock)
But... but how? She was young! Rose
wasn't old!
DADDY
She was fifty-six, son. Of course
she didn't look it, nowhere near
it. The cancer came back, I'm
afraid I fibbed about that. But it
was very quick, son. She was in the
hospital only two weeks, and the
last week she didn't know anything.
WILLCOX HILLYER
(in distress, a slightly
choked voice)
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
Willcox Hillyer rises with his drink in hand and walks across
the patio to the kitchen door.
