Fred and Matt are walking towards their bikes after school.
FRED
Did you videotape it?
MATT
(sarcastically)
Yeah. I took my camera to gym class with
me.
FRED
You are the biggest moron I have ever
known.
Just then, Deacon comes up to them.
DEACON
Hey, guys. Here's the money.
He hands out the proceeds from the operation, and Matt
notices that Deacon is a little out of sorts.
MATT
Something wrong?
Deacon lets out a deep breath.
DEACON
Yeah. I heard Rachael Unger did it with
John Baldwin.
FRED
Well, you had your chance. I told you to
seal that deal.
DEACON
Shut up, Fabio. I don't see you sealing
any deals.
FRED
I'm biding my time.
DEACON
Whatever. It just wasn't good timing.

FRED
It doesn't get any better than that. You
and Rachael were perfect for each other.
And naked girls don't just appear out of
thin air.
(scoffs)
"I have a math test tomorrow."
DEACON
Will you shut up already?
(beat)
Look, I've been thinking about this all
day. We're juniors now. Upperclassmen.
MATT
So?
They reach the bike rack and start unlocking their bikes.
DEACON
So we have a responsibility to ourselves
to start having fun and getting girls.
This year is our year.
(takes the chain off his bike)
There's nothing holding us back any more.
Over in the parking lot, JAKE, a studly senior, revs the
engine on his truck. Two hot girls, KELLY and WENDY, sit on
his bumper, chatting.
DEACON (CONT'D)
You see? That's exactly what I'm talking
about. That could be us.
FRED
That's not going to be us this year, or
next year, or any year, ever.
DEACON
Why not? All we have to do is follow the
simple lessons of Tony Montana in "Scar
Face."
MATT
Ooh. Good movie.
DEACON AND MATT
(with Cuban accents)
"First you get the money, then you get
the power, then you get the women."
FRED
So, we're going to become Cuban drug
lords?
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

DEACON
Listen, the porno pirating operation is
bringing in plenty of money. When I get
my new car tonight for my birthday, we'll
have the power to go wherever we want.
Then, there's nothing stopping us from
getting the girls.
Fred and Matt look at Deacon warily. Is this a plan? Then,
the hot girls and Jake drive past the guys.
JAKE
Bye, Sphincter!
They laugh, then peel out with the radio blasting.
FRED
Nothing's going to change, Deacon. You're
still going to be the kid who shit his
pants in fifth grade and no one will ever
let you forget it.
DEACON
I had a stomach virus, asshole.
Just then, a super hot CHEERLEADER drops her car keys and
bends over to pick them up.
FRED
Oh, that's just not fair.
Fred adjusts himself.

Deacon drives the DMV Tester Car under the watchful eye of
the DMV TESTER.
DEACON
And I signal exactly two hundred feet
before the turn. Rule 108-1.
The unimpressed Tester remains expressionless.
DMV TESTER
Great. Now after the right, I want you to
parallel park in the open space.
Deacon complies.
DEACON
I begin the parallel parking maneuver by
pulling within three feet of the forward
vehicle. I now shift into reverse while
turning the wheel two revolutions
clockwise...
The Tester rubs his brow.

Deacon, Fred, and Matt stand on the porch, waiting. The door
opens, and we see Coop dancing all the way to the front door.
COOP
(ad lib)
Grommets!
DEACON
Hey, Coop. Can we come in?
Coop un-pockets a tiny piece of paper with a thousand names
on it. He examines it for a long time.
COOP
Sorry, son, that dog won't hunt. Y'all
ain't on the list.
He goes to close the door. Deacon stops it with his foot.
Fred flinches.
DEACON
Coop. It's my birthday today, so cut me
some slack, all right?
Coop looks him over, then opens the door.
COOP
(ad lib)
Well, pickle my turnips, why didn't you
say so? Happy birthday, friend.
The guys look at each other, excited. They look back at
Roger, five feet behind them at the bottom of the steps.
ROGER
Little help?

Deacon wanders out back. It's
very dark and there are several
people in the pool, including
Jake's good-looking friends,
Kelly, Wendy, J.T., and MARK.
It's hard to tell in the dark
water, but it looks like they
might not be wearing any
clothes. Deacon sees this and
starts to walk away.
J.T.
Deacon. I heard it was your birthday.
Come on in the pool, man.
DEACON
No, that's okay.
MARK
No, seriously. It's cool.
KELLY
(come hither)
Come on, Deacon.
WENDY
Yeah. Come on.
Deacon thinks about it. He takes the metaphorical plunge.
DEACON
All right.
He slips off his shoes and takes off his shirt. He walks over
to the shallow end. Deacon steps in with his shorts still on.
MARK
Dude, what are you doing? Take off your
clothes.
DEACON
What?
WENDY
We're skinny dipping, Deacon.
He hesitates, not sure what to do.
DEACON
Oh. Okay. Sorry, I'll just leave you guys
alone then--
KELLY
--No, come on in. Join us.
Wendy swims into J.T.'s arms. Her shoulders rise above the
water and you can just make out the top of her breast.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

DEACON
looks at her, thinks it over, and finally... slips off his
shorts. He gets into the pool in his underwear, then slips
them off, too, and throws them on the side of pool.
DEACON
Wow. This feels amazing.
Someone splashes Kelly, she giggles, and the other kids swim
around. Kelly swims by Deacon seductively and he smiles.
JAKE (O.S.)
Coop's doing funnels. Come on.
It's Jake, by the side of the pool with Deacon's clothes. The
other people swim to the front, and get out of the pool...
...wearing clothes! Even Wendy, in a strapless bra.
J.T.
(rubbing it in)
Sorry, dude.
DEACON
Hey, give me back my clothes!
JAKE
Freakin? I can't see you. Maybe I need to
turn on the LIGHTS.
And he does. The backyard lights go on illuminating the
scene. Deacon panics. People start looking at him, laughing.
Then, the cheesy colored pool lights come on, flashing
slowly.
Deacon is humiliated. Jake bends down to whisper to Deacon.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Did you really think Naomi was into you?
Deacon doesn't respond. But it's not enough for Jake. He
picks up Deacon's underwear with a stick and examines them.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Oh my God! Skid marks. Aaaahhh, Deacon
shit his pants again!
DEACON
No, I didn't! Give them back!
Jake does a victory lap around the pool with Deacon's
underwear on the stick. Everybody is laughing.
JAKE
Sphincter boy shit his pants!

Deacon is still in the pool, shivering and shrivelled.
Finally, the lights turn off in the back yard, and Deacon
ventures out of the pool.
He grabs an inflatable elephant pool toy and slips it around
his privates. He slowly sneaks around the house.

A dog BARKS! He snarls at Deacon standing there wearing only
the pool toy. Deacon runs away into the

The Dog is right behind him. Deacon struggles with him.
DEACON
Hey, watch the nads!
But it's no use. The dog BITES the front of the pool toy and
it starts to deflate...
... just as the HEADLIGHTS of a car pull into the driveway.
Deacon FREEZES. He desperately tries to cover himself with
the rapidly diminishing toy being jerked away by the dog in a
motion that makes it look like Deacon's getting a doggie
hummer. A MAN gets out of the car.
COOP'S DAD
What the hell kind of sick shit is this?

The next day, the guys are at the bike rack, when a hot
SPORTS CAR drives by. Deacon is visibly bummed.
DEACON
You know how long it's going to take to
save up for a car selling porno tapes
twenty bucks a pop?
Fred looks down.
DEACON (CONT'D)
What?
FRED
There's a small problem.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
22.
MATT
What?
FRED
I got fired yesterday. Russ caught me and
went berserk. Some sort of sting
operation he's been planning for months.
I don't know.
DEACON
You're kidding me, right? Tell me you're
kidding.
FRED
No. And now I have to work twice a week
at my dad's office. I told you this
Scarface plan was stupid.
DEACON
Great. So now we've got no girls, no car,
and no money.
FRED
And no porn.
MATT
Tony Montana would be very disappointed.
Deacon is once again...

DORKY FRESHMAN
Is this some kind of extortion racket?
I'll pay you double if you can get me
something today.
DEACON
I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do for
a while. We don't have anything new.
DORKY FRESHMAN
I'm dying. I just need something.
Just then, Naomi walks by on her way to the parking lot.
DEACON
Hey, Naomi. What are you up to?
NAOMI
Going home to cram for midterms.
With a look, Deacon shoos away the freshman dork.
DEACON
Oh. I could help you. I mean, if you
needed any help.
NAOMI
That's okay. I'll be all right.
Deacon searches for something meaningful to say, desperate
not to let the moment pass him by. Naomi cuts him some slack
by asking,
NAOMI (CONT'D)
So where did Rachael go off to?
DEACON
She went to Paris with the French Club.
(then, taking a chance)
We're seeing other people.
She laughs at his attempt at being nonchalant. But she's
laughing with him, not at him, and Deacon can tell the
difference. He relaxes...
JAKE (O.S.)
Hey, sphincter.
... just as Jake drives up to them. Deacon is starting to
really get pissed at Jake ruining the moment with Naomi.
DEACON
Look, can you please stop calling me
that? I think we're old enough to just
let it go. All right?
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
24.
JAKE
Oh, sure. Sorry about that... Shit-pants.
He looks at Naomi.
JAKE (CONT'D)
Hi, Naomi.
NAOMI
Whatever.
She turns her back to Jake and his smile fades. He revs the
engine and peels out BACKWARDS. Deacon jumps out of the way,
but his bike is CRUSHED by the car.
JAKE
Oops. Sorry.
He shifts gears and drives over the bike again. He laughs as
he drives away. Naomi gives Deacon a pitying look and walks
away. The moment is gone. Now Deacon is...

A crowd of people (including Deacon's biology class) are
watching something in the monkey cage.
BIOLOGY TEACHER
People! People! Come quickly. Witness the
miracle of nature at its most primal.
She's videotaping it, and Deacon looks up AT HER VIDEO
VIEWFINDER. It's a monkey orgy. Masturbation and fornication
everywhere.
DEACON (V.O.)
And these monkeys are doing it. I mean,
they're going wild. And Miss Ariel is
videotaping it.

With one final thrust of his engorged

Probably to a younger, more desirable
female. One who doesn't have any
"issues." Whatever that means.
DEACON (V.O.)
That's when it hit me.
Just then, a glob of "something" shoots out towards the crowd
(SFX). Everyone ducks, except for Roger, who's can't move
quickly enough in his wheelchair. It hits him in the face,
dripping down his orthodontia.
ROGER
A little help!
DEACON (V.O.)
Well, Roger actually...

The guys ride their bikes towards the lab to deliver the
samples.
FRED
And we need porno names.
DEACON
What do you mean?
FRED
It's a basic rule of porno. All people
affiliated with the production of an
adult film have porno names so their
friends don't recognize them.
MATT
Oh, you mean like "Johnny Hardmember"?
FRED
Exactly. That's a good one. I'll be Balls
McLongcock.
MATT
Ooh, I like it.
DEACON
Guys. Those kind of names are just for
the actors.
MATT
You're just jealous that you don't have a
cool porno name like us.
DEACON
Okay, fine. Then I'm Sam ...
(searching)
Slam. Sam Slam. The Back Door Man.
Matt and Fred look at each other, then Deacon.
MATT
That name sucks.
FRED
You don't get it, do you? A porno name
needs to be a very subtle thing.
Fred gestures and DROPS the samples which SPLATTER all over
the ground.

The guys step out of the car and see for the first time the
Holy Grail of boyhood fantasies: the neon outline of a
topless woman at the entrance to this upscale strip club.
They stop and stare for a beat, before finally getting up the
nerve to walk up to a menacing BOUNCER sitting on a stool
outside the entrance, reading "The Princess Diaries."
BOUNCER
I.d.'s.
They confidently pull out the i.d.'s and hand them over.
BOUNCER (CONT'D)
Richard Runningbear from Hawaii? What
brings you guys to Cleveland?
FRED
MATT
Business.
Vacation.
DEACON
We're on business, he's on vacation.
He hands the i.d.'s back.
BOUNCER
Well, "tiki-alohi-noa-lohi."
DEACON
Sorry?
BOUNCER
That's Hawaiian for "welcome."
FRED
Right. Of course. We just moved to Hawaii
a few months ago. Haven't picked up the
local lingo yet.
They force smiles and wait for the answer...
BOUNCER
Okay. Have a good time, guys.
Deacon grabs the i.d.'s and pushes the other two forward. He
grabs the handle to the door.

Oh, and guys.

spills her latt on her shirt. People start laughing, but
Deacon instinctively rushes over to pick up her books.

Are you okay?
NAOMI
Yeah. Thanks. I'm so embarrassed.
She pats at the stain.
DEACON

Really? I didn't think you got
embarrassed about anything.

Oh.

I haven't seen you around here in a

Yeah, I'm working on this project at

When we were going out, he was so mean to
me all the time. I think he's
compensating for his little dick that
never even gets hard.
Deacon chokes on his drink.

Well at least you were smart enough to
dump him. I mean, you deserve someone who
will treat you ... I don't know. Really
well.
NAOMI
You know what you are?
Deacon gets a little nervous.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
You're a nice guy.
She kisses him on the cheek. Deacon looks at her, then steels
himself to make a decision. He kisses her!
She's surprised, but not unwilling.

I've been wanting to do that for a long

So why didn't you?
Most guys would look away at this point, with a fabulous babe
with pouty lips staring you down. But Deacon passes the test:
he stands his ground and kisses her again. She likes it.
AT A WINDOW, Jake sees them kissing. He doesn't like it.

DEACON
Yeah, pretty much.
He looks down.
DEACON (CONT'D)
So, I guess this means you're not my
girlfriend anymore.
NAOMI
Not necessarily.
She looks at him with newfound interest.
NAOMI (CONT'D)
I want to come to the set tomorrow.
DEACON
No, I don't think that's a good idea.
NAOMI
Why not? I'm curious. I've never seen a

Matt and Fred will get really mad. We're
not supposed to tell anyone.
NAOMI
Tell them I'm a ... creative consultant.
For the female point of view.

No offense, but the female point of view

Sure.
FRED
Do you think me and Matt will ever get
girlfriends?
ASHLEY
Are you kidding? Come on, guys. You have
it made. You're smart, funny, fun to be
with. In a couple of years, girls will be
dying to meet men like you.
MATT
Really?
ASHLEY
Well, no. Popular, good looking guys
always get the girls.
(off their look)
Hey, what was I supposed to say?
Then, Roger wheels by, arm in arm with his Hairdresser. No
more braces and headgear, Roger looks sharp with slicked back
hair and suave clothes.

ROGER
Hey, guys. Great party.
He wheels off. The guys and Ashley do a double take.

The Bouncer is checking off names from the invite list. A
long line of people are trying to get in, including J.T.
J.T.
I can't believe these losers are having
such a killer party.
Coop is walking by and overhears the comment.
COOP
Hey, you're not on the list, dude.
J.T.
What's with you, you pussy? Are you
joining the retard team, too?
Just then, Plantain enters and walks to the front of the
line. The high school guys stop everything to stare at her.
PLANTAIN
Coop!
COOP
Plantain.
Plantain kisses him, while nonchalantly grabbing his crotch.
PLANTAIN
Come on. You don't need to wait in this
line. Deacon and the guys are already
inside.
Coop puts his arms around her and walks away, not without
looking back over his shoulder for a second at J.T. standing
there, dumbfounded. Then, the Bouncer escorts J.T. away.

Ashley is walking by Wendy and Kelly.
WENDY
I can't believe Naomi dumped Jake for
Deacon Lewis.
Ashley stops.
ASHLEY
Let me tell you something about Deacon.
That boy is amazing in bed.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
102.
KELLY
And you are...?
ASHLEY
Ashley. Deacon's ex.
WENDY
Seriously?
ASHLEY
Seriously. Have your boyfriends ever
given you an orgasm?
WENDY
No.
KELLY
I think so.
(off Ashley's look)
No.
ASHLEY
Have you ever felt so completely
satisfied in bed that you just wanted to
sleep for a week?
KELLY AND WENDY
No.
ASHLEY
You're wasting your time giving those
Neanderthals blowjobs. I mean, they'll
probably wind up unemployed wife beaters
anyway.
KELLY
So, are Deacon's friends seeing anybody?
ASHLEY
Matt and Fred? I don't think so. But if
you're interested, you better move fast.
Those guys know how to do this thing ...
She whispers something to Wendy and Kelly. They look shocked.
Ashley walks off...

...and finds Deacon, sitting alone on a broken-down ride. She
sits down next to him.
ASHLEY
How's Naomi?
DEACON
I don't know. Good, I guess.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
103.
ASHLEY
I thought she was your fantasy girl.
DEACON
Yeah. She was.
ASHLEY
You're gonna dump her.
DEACON
I don't want to. I don't know. It's not
like it was when I was with Rachael.
Rachael and I used to talk about stuff.
We just, I don't know, connected.
ASHLEY
Very good, Deacon.
Deacon is confused.
DEACON
What do you mean?
ASHLEY
Oh, nothing. I guess I'm just glad that
you finally figured it out.
A moment of realization.
DEACON
Yeah, I guess I did.
(beat)
So I have to do this, don't I?
ASHLEY
(joking this time)
I guess. Or not. Whatever.
Deacon smiles. He finally understands that Ashley really does
care about him. Ashley kisses him on the cheek and exits off
into the horizon.

Deacon holds Naomi's hand and they walk and talk.
DEACON
There's something I want to talk to you
about.
NAOMI
What?
DEACON
I've been thinking. Maybe we should see
other people.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
104.
NAOMI
What?
DEACON
Well, I mean, we don't really have
anything in common. And we don't really
even get along.
NAOMI
You're breaking up with me?
(beat)
Can we still have sex?
DEACON
Listen to what I'm saying, Naomi.
NAOMI
The only reason I went out with you was
because I thought you were a nice guy.
And now you're breaking up with me?
DEACON
Yeah. I guess so.
NAOMI
If you tell anybody about this... I have
a reputation.
DEACON
I won't. You can tell people you dumped
me if you want.
NAOMI
Really?
DEACON
Sure. What do I care?
NAOMI
You see? You are a nice guy.
She kisses him on the cheek.
DEACON
Just don't tell anyone about the movies.
All right?
She smiles.
JAKE (O.S.)
These guys are pornographers!
It's Jake, on the bandstand with the mike. He's drunk.
JAKE (CONT'D)
They're perverts! They make porno movies
in their basement!
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
105.
But no one is paying any attention.
DEACON
No one's listening to you, Jake. Give it
a rest.
Jake gets down to confront the guys.
JAKE
Oh, really, skidmarks? I know someone who
will believe me. Your parents.
DEACON
The web site is in someone else's name.
All our records are encrypted. There's no
tracing it to us, jerk off.
JAKE
Oh, really? Well, good thing I took the
tape of Ashley masturbating in your
basement. When they see that, they'll see
what kind of movies their perfect little
Deacon is making.
DEACON
Did you make a copy of it?
JAKE
No.
DEACON
You sent the original tape to my parents?
JAKE
Yup.
NAOMI
You know, Jake, you're a real dick!
She punches him in the stomach. He doubles over and she
uppercuts him. He flies backwards, crashing through a table.
DEACON
Jesus.
MATT
You should probably avoid pissing her
off.
DEACON
Noted. Guys. We've got a problem.
102
103
The guys get into the Aerostar.
VIC (O.S.)
Not so fast, ladies.
It's Vic and Mike, and Mike points his gun at Deacon's head.
VIC (CONT'D)
Which one of you is Balls McLongcock?
Matt and Deacon give up Fred.
VIC (CONT'D)
Good name.
FRED
Thanks.
VIC
Too bad you're not going to be able to
use it any more.
DEACON
Who the hell are you?
VIC
The competition. And who the hell are
you, coming into my town, paying girls
double what I'm paying them? This stupid
After School Special shit is cutting into
my business. So now I'm putting you out
of business.

Deacon drives the minivan home and pulls in next to the brand
new convertible sports car. Deacon gets out, excited.
MR. LEWIS
What do you think?
DEACON
This is for me?
MR. LEWIS
Are you crazy? It's for me. You want a
new car, you get an after school job.
Deacon's Mom is wearing a sexy outfit and carries an
overnight bag. She's beaming.
MRS. LEWIS
But we are letting you have the Aerostar.
It may not be "cool," but it'll get you
where you're going.
DEACON
Thanks, guys. Really.
MRS. LEWIS
We're going away for the weekend. Your
father surprised me!

Deacon's parents KISS then pull out of the driveway.

Deacon pulls the minivan into the parking lot. In the
passenger seat is Fred. In the back seat are Matt, Max, and
Max's three FRIENDS. They all get out and the freshmen
scamper away. Matt is holding Deacon's driver's license.
MATT
It's not even in focus. This is really
shoddy work.
Deacon takes it back from him.
MATT (CONT'D)
So, guys. I decided I'm going to apply to
NYU next year. The film school.
FRED
Too bad we burned the film. You could
have submitted it as your sample.
MATT
Good idea, Balls.
The guys start laughing.
FRED
So, I guess we all got what we deserved.
No money, no power, no women.
MATT
Tony Montana would be pissed.
Just then, Rachael spots them and walks over.
DEACON
Speak for yourself, guys.
RACHAEL
Hey, guys. Deacon.
Deacon KISSES her. The other two guys are stunned.

... where we see a large CAR TRANSPORT, with three hot new
sports cars on it. Their license plates read "JOHNNY H," "SAM
SLAM," and "BALLS."
TRACK OVER to Mike, unloading the cars and Vic, standing
there smiling.
