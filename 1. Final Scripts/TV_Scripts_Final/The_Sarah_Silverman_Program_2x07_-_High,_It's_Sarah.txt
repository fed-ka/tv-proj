Sarah  It s  High,

ACT ONE


EXT. SARAH S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING (DAY 1)

SFX: Rooster crow.


MORNING - APARTMENT STEVE S & BRIAN INT.

Brian is on the couch, watching TV.  Steve yawns as he 
enters.  Brian offers up their bong to Steve.

BRIAN
Feel like starting your day off with a 
bowl of shredded mini-weeds?

STEVE
Tempting, but you know I m saving myself 
for the  Laser-Bowie  show tonight.  
Being off weed for three days now, man, 
this feels like my second virginity, but 
for pot.

BRIAN
You really think lowering your tolerance 
is going to make a big difference?

STEVE
If I m not ridiculously high at this 
laser light show, then I ve just wasted 
three days of my life. 

Steve puts on a baseball hat and opens the front door.

BRIAN
Where are you off to?

STEVE
Best Buy.  I wanna check out the new coax 
cables they just got in.

BRIAN
(re: bong)
What am I supposed to do?

STEVE
Can t you just smoke alone?

BRIAN
No way.  Then I d have a problem.2.



Sarah appears in their open doorway, holding a coffee mug.  

STEVE
Oh, hey Sarah.  Nice mug.

SARAH
What, this old thing?  

Steve exits.  Sarah stands in the entryway waiting for 
Brian to invite her in.  After a beat:

BRIAN 
Do you want to come in or something?

SARAH
No, no, nothing of the sort.  I just came 
by to borrow a cup of sugar.

BRIAN
Sure, what are you making? 

SARAH
Making...?

Sarah and Brian exchange confused looks.  Brian then takes 
the mug from Sarah and goes to the kitchen.  While Sarah 
waits in the doorway, she sniffs her armpit and appears 
content.  Brian returns and hands the mug to Sarah.

BRIAN
Here you go.

Sarah dips her pinkie into the mug and samples the sugar.

SARAH
pure. it s Yup,

An awkward, silent beat.  Then Sarah maintains eye contact 
with Brian as she silently closes the door on herself.

 there s couch, the onto back flop to about Brian s as Just
again. Sarah it s and up it opens He  door. the on KNOCK a

(CONT D) SARAH
Was that weird just then?

BRIAN
Very weird.  I m glad you said something 
 cause I thought maybe it was just me.

SARAH
We used to be so close, and now we live 
so close, but we re not so close.  
Remember how much fun we used to have?3.



Sarah and Brian both look upward and into a...


EXT. ALLEY - DAY - FLASHBACK

It s the early 1990 s.  Sarah stands with Brian, who s 
eating from a can of Pringles.  Sarah wears an over-sized 
hoodie, a long, sloppy skirt, and Doc Martens.

SARAH
Oh, do you like acoustics?

BRIAN
You know I do.

Sarah grabs the Pringles can and dumps out the chips.  She 
then hikes up her skirt and squats over the can.  Her face 
becomes focused as we hear the amplified TINKLING of pee.

(CONT D) BRIAN
Rad.

The loud TINKLING starts and stops again and again.  


SCENE TO BACK - APARTMENT STEVE S & BRIAN INT.

We exit this reverie to find Sarah and Brian laughing.

BRIAN
Oh man, I haven t laughed that hard in 
years.  Sure, it ruined Pringles for me, 
but I found other chips to eat. 

SARAH
That s that.  We re spending the day 
together, you and me.  
(then)
Tell me, old friend, what do you like to 
do for fun these days?

BRIAN
Well, today I was toying with the idea of 
getting high.
(re: bong)
You want me to deal you in? 

SARAH
Oh, I don t know, I ve never smoked pot 
before.  But what s the worst that could 
happen.

Sarah turns and gives a gigantic wink to the camera.  The 
CAMERA WINKS BACK.  Off Sarah s puzzled reaction...4.



EXT. BANK - DAY

A crime scene is being taped off at a bank.  Nearby, Jay is 
being interviewed by TV news reporter, GRACE BRADLEY.

GRACE BRADLEY
(into camera)
Joining me now is officer Jay McPherson, 
who used words, not bullets, to convince 
bank robbers to surrender.
(to Jay)
So, how does it feel to be a hero?

JAY
Ah, jeez... Mighty Mouse is a hero, I was 
just doing my job.

GRACE BRADLEY
Modesty.  You won t find that on 
Craigslist.  Tell me, Jay, what does a 
strapping man like you do after a big... 
bust like this--

Grace presses her cleavage in close for Jay to inspect.

JAY
Uh-oh.  I m, um, picking up some signals 
here, and they seem to be of a romantic--
(averting eyes)
Okay, I should explain that I have a 
girlfriend, so your breasts there are 
creating a bit of a--


SEQUENCE DREAM END - MORNING - BEDROOM JAY S INT.

Jay bolts awake from his dream, breathing hard.  He quickly 
lifts up the sheets and surveys the scene.  He grimaces.

JAY
Aw, for crying out loud.

As Laura begins to wake up, he whips the sheets back down.

LAURA
Morning, Puppy.

JAY
(flustered)
Hey, you...

breath. of out he s notices then Jay, to up snuggles Laura5.



LAURA
Jay, you re all hot and sweaty.  Let s 
cool you off.

Laura flings the sheets open, then spots something on Jay.

(CONT D) LAURA
Oh, Jay, I think you ve had a nocturnal 
emission here.

JAY
Wha-- noooo.  I just had a... touch of 
the groin sweats.  

LAURA
  okay. it s Sweetie,

JAY
You re not upset about this?

LAURA
Of course not.  I m totally flattered.  

JAY
Why would you be...?
(realizing)
I mean... yep.
(trying to be playful)
Got me again, you ol  rascal.  You just 
won t stay out of my dreams, will ya?

Laura beams.


EXT. PARK - LATER

Brian and Sarah are TOTALLY HIGH, hanging out on the swings.  
Sarah leans out of frame with a joint, then returns into 
frame, exhaling a huge cloud of SMOKE.  

SARAH
Seven, one, eight, five, three, two.

BRIAN
What?

SARAH
I don t know.  I couldn t think of words 
so I said numbers.

BRIAN
I think I got the gist of it.  

They both enjoy this stoner moment.6.



SARAH
Hey, you know who s the most amazing 
person in the world?

BRIAN
Wait, I think I know this one.

SARAH
Stymie.  The cook at Romanski s.  He s so 
kind, and so wise.  He nurtures us with 
each meal he prepares... and we never 
thank him!  We have to thank him, Brian!

BRIAN
Dude, you re just really high.  You won t 
believe all of this once you re sober.

SARAH
Oh, yeah?  Well believe this.

Sarah whips out her cellphone and dials on speaker-phone.

SARAH S OUTGOING MESSAGE (O.S.)
...so leave a message at the beep, or 
don t.  See if I care.

SFX: Voicemail BEEP.

SARAH
(into phone)
Sarah, it s me.  This is really 
important.  You must tell Stymie how much 
he means to you.  Yes, you re completely 
high right now, but believe yourself.  
This is real.

Sarah hangs up.  Brian is chuckling.  

BRIAN
That s goofier than peeing in a Pringles 
can.  


LATER - ROOM LIVING JAY S INT.

 on puts He  uniform. his in now door, front the at Jay s
his police cap as Laura sneaks up and hugs him from behind.

LAURA
Now don t you go dreaming about me when 
you re supposed to be fighting crime.

JAY
Uh, Roger-that.7.



Jay sighs loudly, then turns to face Laura.

JAY (CONT D)
Look, we always said we d be honest with 
each other, right?  So the truth is, my 
nocturnal emission wasn t caused by you. 

Laura, stunned, takes a step away from Jay.

LAURA
Then who was it caused by...?

JAY
Grace Bradley, WKTPU News.  

LAURA
Oh Jay, how could you?

JAY
You see, Grace Bradley s coming by the 
station today to do a story about the 
recent surge in missing pets.  That s 
gotta be why she snuck into my dream.  

LAURA
Well, I hope when you see her you can 
contain your semen.  Since that seems to 
be such a challenge for you!

Laura storms out, but has to stop to gather her things.  
 maneuver awkwardly they so leave, to trying also Jay s
around each other, grabbing keys, etc.  They tensely exit. 


LATER - ROOM LIVING SARAH S INT.

Sarah and Brian are lounging on the couch, now SOBER.  

SARAH
So that s being high, huh?  Kinda reminds 
me of puberty; the whole time I just felt 
hungry and way too aware of my body hair.

BRIAN
So you think you re still going to tell 
Stymie all that nice stuff about him?

SARAH
Nah, it was just a goofy, stoney idea.
(noticing cellphone)
Oh, I got a message.  

Sarah dials her voicemail and holds the phone to her ear.8.



SPLIT SCREEN: we see High-Sarah leaving the voicemail from 
earlier.  Sober-Sarah listens intently as she hears:

HIGH SARAH 
Sarah, it s me.  This is really 
important.  You must tell Stymie how much 
he means to you.  Yes, you re completely 
high right now, but believe yourself.  
This is real.

Sarah hangs up the phone.  Return to: NORMAL SCREEN. 

SARAH
Oh my god... she s right!  Come on, 
Brian, we ve got to go!


LATER - ROMANSKI S INT.

Steve and Laura are at the counter, eating brunch.

STEVE
So what were you guys fighting about?

LAURA
Oh... um, well... it s just that I like 
chocolate but Jay really likes vanilla.

STEVE
 It s  crazy. what s that s See,always 
the small stuff.  That stuff matters. 
Hey, we should get your mind off this 
fight.  Let s go bowling.

LAURA
Bowling is a natural distractant.  

Sarah and Brian barge through the front door, right past 
Laura and Steve.  Sarah addresses STYMIE, the scruffy cook.  

SARAH
Stymie, you beautiful bastard, I just 
want to tell you how deeply I value you.  
I appreciate everything you ve done for 
me, and for the whole community.  You are 
truly a special person.  

After a long, silent beat, Stymie bursts into HEAVING SOBS.

STYMIE
Thank you, thank you, it s just been a 
really hard year.  I ve been so depressed 
lately I was afraid for myself.  But when 
I heard you say that, everything just...9.



Stymie sobs some more.  Sarah hugs him tightly.

SARAH
Shhh... it s okay.  It s okay.  

Stymie can t stop crying from this joyful release.

STYMIE
I m sorry... you ll have to excuse me--

Stymie hustles off to the kitchen area.  

BRIAN
Wow, your voicemail to yourself just 
changed this dude s life.  Stoners always 
have genius ideas, but we never do 
anything about them.  This is huge!

SARAH
Thank you.  So are you!

Laura and Steve are in awe.

LAURA
Sarah, that was incredible.

Sarah notices Laura and Steve for the first time.

SARAH
Oh, hey guys.

STEVE
Yeah, Sarah, that was maybe the nicest 
thing I ve ever seen anyone do.  

LAURA
The world would be such a better place if 
we all just thanked the Stymies in our 
lives, yet we rarely do.  But you did. 

SARAH
  I? didn t did, I

LAURA
So why d you decide to say all that? 

SARAH
Oh, I ve been doing drugs.  

Laura and Steve share a look of surprise.  Sarah takes a 
 mouth. her in it pops and plate Laura s from stick carrot

BEGIN MONTAGE: Uplifting music plays over the following.


INT. STATE PRISON - LATER

Sarah and Brian are passing out REAL DOLLS (the ultra-
realistic looking silicone sex dolls) to PRISONERS.  The

delighted.  The little scrawny weak prisoners look FUCKING 
ECSTATIC.  All the prisoners applaud Sarah and Brian.


LATER - CITY TO ENTRANCE - CAR BRIAN S STREET/INT. EXT.

Sarah and Brian are driving by the Valley Village city 
limit, enjoying the view.  Sarah exhales a giant plume of 
smoke as Brian drives.  They spot a sign that reads: 
 WELCOME TO VALLEY VILLAGE, MAYOR ELLISON B. WITTELS 

Brian looks inspired.  Sarah hands him the phone.

BRIAN
I dunno.  Feels kinda gay to call myself.

SARAH
You know what?  It does feel kinda gay to 
make the world a better place, Brian.  
Good thing you re gay.    

Brian nods.  He s sold.  He dials on his cellphone.

BRIAN
Hey, Brian, it s you.  Listen buddy, I 
think I m onto something here...11.



EXT. STREET - ENTRANCE TO CITY - LATER

We PAN across: first to the Valley Village welcome sign 
again.  REVEAL it has been sloppily altered to read: 
 VALLEY VILLAGE SMELLS BALLS .  

We then PAN to Brian, next to the sign, beaming with pride.  
We WIDEN to include Sarah, who wears a serious expression.  

SARAH
(proud)
You did it, Brian.

Sarah pulls Brian into an earnest hug.  

BRIAN
We did it.

SARAH
No, weed did it.

END MONTAGE.


INT. FAN-TASTI-MART - LATER

Sarah and Brian are HIGH, walking down an aisle and tossing 
junk food into their cart.  

SARAH
You re a good hang, Brian.  It s like if 
Doug could carry my groceries.

Brian loads a few items into the shopping cart.

BRIAN
Huh, Fat Free Nifty Chips, toilet paper 
and diarrhea medicine.  Aisle 2B is like 
a museum of my day.

Sarah laughs... until she notices the product labels.  

SARAH
This can t be right...

CLOSE ON: the little company logo on the bag of Fat Free 
Nifty Chips.  It reads  SchaarCorp .

CLOSE ON: the toilet paper logo.  Also  SchaarCorp .

 SchaarCorp . Yup,  logo. medicine diarrhea the ON: CLOSE12.



(CONT D) SARAH
Brian, this is a blatant conspiracy!  The 
same company that sells you diarrhea 
medicine and toilet paper also sells you 
Fat Free Nifty Chips, which we all know 
causes diarrhea!  

BRIAN
Dicks! 

SARAH
It s like they ve forced us into this 
never-ending cycle of buying and pooping 
and pooping and buying.  SchaarCorp has 
put us on this... hamster wheel... of 
necessity!  

BRIAN
And we re the hamsters! 

SARAH
This is a load of hooey.  We have to stop 
these corporate wieners. 

BRIAN
Sarah, I totally agree it s a load of 
hooey, but what can we do?

SARAH
you. show I ll

Sarah pulls out her cellphone and dials.  

(CONT D) SARAH
(as she presses buttons)
Call, call, call, call, call.
(then, into phone)
Hey, it s you again.  Listen closely...


INT. POLICE STATION - LATER

A news crew sets up.  Grace Bradley greets a row of 
officers, including Jay and OFFICER PAUL.

GRACE BRADLEY
(as she shakes hands)
Grace Bradley.  Hi.  Grace Bradley.

Jay fidgets as Grace nears.  She extends her hand to Jay.

GRACE BRADLEY (CONT D)
Grace Bradley.  Thanks for having me.13.



JAY
Nice to meet you.  I feel the need to 
mention that you are not attractive.

Grace and the officers look at Jay, bewildered.


EXT. SCHAARCORP OFFICE BUILDING - LATER

Sarah and Brian, now SOBER, approach the SchaarCorp 
  tuxedo. a Brian, gown, a in Sarah s  entrance. headquarters

BRIAN
Sarah, even if we are dressed all 
business-y, SchaarCorp isn t gonna just 
let us walk in there and talk to their 
president.

SARAH
Oh yeah?  What about Ellen Brockovich?  
She was just one person with big tits.  
We re two people with big tits.   

BRIAN
You mean Erin Brockovich.

SARAH
Right, I must have been thinking about 
her sister.  So, you ready?

BRIAN
Wait, remind me again why we re so 
enraged at these guys.

SARAH
Huh.  I m a little fuzzy on the details, 
too.  Let s get our minds correct.

Sarah whips out a JOINT.


INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Grace and her crew are preparing for the live broadcast. 
Officer Paul and Jay are nearby.

OFFICER PAUL
Why d you tell Grace Bradley that she s 
unattractive?  Seemed uncalled for.

JAY
Well... last night, I had a dream about 
her that ended... biologically.14.



OFFICER PAUL
Big deal, so did I.

JAY
Yeah, well, it s caused a bit of a 
kerfuffle between Laura and me.

OFFICER PAUL
You told Laura?  Rookie mistake.  
Alright, here s what you have to do.  
Explain everything to Grace and then 
you ll feel better about Laura.

JAY
You re absolutely correct.  As far as 
policies go, honesty is right up there, 
I ve found.


INT. BOWLING ALLEY SHOE RENTAL COUNTER - DAY

Steve and Laura are at the counter with a SHOE RENTAL GUY.

SHOE RENTAL GUY
Be right back with your 6 s and 14 s.

He walks off.  Steve notices Laura is zoning out.

STEVE
Still upset about Jay, huh?

LAURA
Can we have a talk down? 

STEVE
Sure, let s have a talk down. 

They lean against the rental shoe counter.

LAURA
Jay and I didn t actually fight about 
vanilla versus chocolate... Jay had a 
dream about Grace Bradley, and... it 
caused him to release his seeds. 

STEVE
Oh, Laura. 

Steve sympathetically opens his arms.  Laura takes the hug.  

(CONT D) STEVE
That s always a tough one.  But listen: I 
know how Jay feels.  
(MORE)15.


(CONT D) STEVE
And no matter what dreams pass through 
his head, his seeds are never gonna wind 
up anywhere but on you.  You re his love 
garden.  This problem will be gone with 
the next laundry.

LAURA
You re so right, Steve.
(then)
You always give such insightful advice, 
but today you re extra eloquent.  It s 
beautiful and I appreciate it.  

STEVE
Yeah, well I haven t smoked pot in a few 
days.  But I can t promise I ll be this 
eloquent again seeing as how I m getting 
massively high for Laser-Bowie tonight.  

The Shoe Rental Guy returns with their bowling shoes.  

LAURA
Thanks for being there for me, Steve.  
I m starting to feel better about this 
whole Jay thing.

Steve notices something on a nearby TV.

STEVE
Speaking of, look who s on TV.

ANGLE ON: The TV.  Grace Bradley s reporting live.  Jay 
enters the frame, not realizing the broadcast has begun.

GRACE BRADLEY
...And that s an unusually high number of 
pets to be missing for any town-- 

JAY
(interrupting)
Listen, Ms. Bradley, I need to explain my 
behavior.  Last night, I dreamed that you 
pressed your breasts against me, and as a 
result of that image, I had a nocturnal 
emission.  You see a tailpipe isn t the 
only thing that has an emission. 
Sometimes, a, if you will, 'frontpipe' 
can have an emission of sorts.

A long beat.

GRACE BRADLEY

Back to you, John.16.



BACK ON: Laura and Steve.  Laura, stone-faced, walks out.

Sarah and Brian, both HIGH, march up to a SECRETARY.

SARAH
We demand to see your president.

SECRETARY
I m sorry.  He s in a meeting.

Sarah SWEEPS everything off her desk, onto the floor.  

SARAH
Now you re in a meeting.

As the secretary tries to gather her belongings, Sarah and 
Brian march past her into the President s office.


INT. SCHAARCORP - PRESIDENT S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Sarah and Brian storm into the office.  The PRESIDENT, who 
sits behind a large desk, is startled to see them.  Sarah 
and Brian lock the door behind them, then produce whistles 
from their pockets and ANGRILY BLOW them at the President.  

SARAH
We know what you re doing, and we hereby 
demand that you knock it off!

BRIAN
Yeah, knock it off mister!

SCHAARCORP PRESIDENT
What the hell are you talking about?

SARAH
The hamster wheel of necessity.

SCHAARCORP PRESIDENT
The what?17.



SARAH
(imitating)
 The what? 
(then)
Allow me to introduce you to my friend, 
Brian.  Thanks to your greedy company, 
he s an overweight, unemployed failure of 
a human being.  

BRIAN
Yeah!

SARAH
Brian eats your Fat Free Nifty Chips, 
which gives him diarrhea.  So he buys 
your anti-diarrhea medicine.  And guess 
whose toilet paper he s wiping his ass 
with?     
(whispering menacingly)
SchaarCorp...
(then)
So you may think you re making products, 
but you re really just making slaves.  
Slaves out of people like Brian!

SCHAARCORP PRESIDENT
Surely you must have had diarrhea before 
Fat Free Nifty Chips? 

SARAH
Yeah, I ve had diarrhea before, asshole.
(then)
You won t get away with this.

Sarah POUNDS HER FIST on the desk.  The force of it causes 
a large vase to fall from a wall shelf, CRASHING onto the 
 Sarah and Brian  cold. out knocked He s  head. President s
exchange a sheepish look.

She picks up the phone and dials on speaker.

SPLIT SCREEN: between High-Sarah and Sober-Sarah & Brian.

HIGH SARAH

that you ve gone too far.  Trust me, you 
haven t.

Return to: NORMAL SCREEN.  Sarah and Brian look relieved.

SARAH
Oh good.  I m glad my High-self is on top 
of things.

BRIAN
Yeah, for a minute there I thought we 
were in too deep.


EXT. STREET - LATER

Laura walks down the street alone, in despair.  She stops 
to read a missing pet flyer tacked to a telephone pole, 
then begins to sing.

Laura walks down the street, continuing the song.

LAURA

As Laura passes the window of an electronics store, she  
sees Jay on TV!  She ends the song.   

ANGLE ON: The TV.  A CHYRON below Jay reads:  Nocturnal Ad-
mission.   Jay s at a podium, addressing the media.

JAY
Ladies and gentlemen, I ve requested that 
WKTPU allow me to address my on-air 
comments from earlier today.  First of 
all, I would like to apologize for my 
public use of the term  nocturnal 
emission.   I didn t know the cameras 
were rolling.  I am not Meryl Streep.  
But more importantly, I want all of 
Valley Village to know that I love my 
girlfriend.  Not only because she is my 
best friend, but because she is the one 
to whom my emissions are truly dedicated.

ANGLE ON: Laura, touched.  She runs off.


EXT. POLICE STATION - A MOMENT LATER

Grace Bradley, as he continues his apology.

JAY
...to any in the food service industry 
whom I offended, to those currently--

Out of nowhere, Laura steps up to podium and stands proudly 
next to Jay.  She takes the mic.  20.



LAURA
Hello.  I m Laura, and I m Jay s 
girlfriend.  And I just want you all to 
know he s got nothing to apologize for.  
Nocturnal emissions are natural, 
biological, and not reflective of the 
real-world intentions of the dreamer.  A 
nocturnal emission doesn t mean you re in 
love.  It just means you re human.
(then)
Thank you.

Jay wraps Laura in a bear hug.  Laura spots Steve in the 
crowd and gives him a thumbs-up.

ANGLE ON: Grace Bradley and Officer Paul.

GRACE BRADLEY
(to herself, touched)
They are so sweet together.  

PAUL
(opportunistic, to Grace)
You made me cream my sheets, too.

Grace s expression sours.

ANGLE ON: Jay and Laura.  They leave the podium, signaling 
the end of the press conference.  The media disperses.   

JAY
 sorry. so I m Laura,

LAURA
It s okay.  We all have strange thoughts 
in our subconscious.  As long as we don t 
act on them, everything will be fine.

JAY
Oh, dumplin  head, I just want to squeeze 
you till your eyes pop out, then kiss 
those eyes and pop  em back in.

LAURA
That sounds wonderful, Jay.  

They hug mercilessly.  Jay s police radio SQUAWKS.

POLICE RADIO (O.S.)
All units!  Kidnapping in progress!  21.



EXT. SARAH S APARTMENT - LATER

 Sarah s outside gathered have ONLOOKERS many and Police
apartment, as a tense stand-off develops.  

OFFICER PAUL
(loudly, into megaphone)
Sarah and Brian, we have the apartment 
surrounded!  It is time to surrender!


CONTINUOUS - APARTMENT SARAH S INT./EXT.

Brian is looking out the window, then starts pacing.

BRIAN
I don t like my name being yelled over a 
megaphone, especially after I ve 
kidnapped someone.

The SchaarCorp President tries to speak, but is muffled, on 
account of the gag in his mouth.  Sarah takes the gag out.

SARAH
Whaaaaat. 

SCHAARCORP PRESIDENT
Do you two have any idea how much trouble 
you re in? 

SARAH
Uh, for being right?  Last I checked, 
that wasn t against the law.  

Sarah goes to the window and addresses the crowd below.

(CONT D) SARAH
Listen close, people outside my 
apartment.  SchaarCorp are the dicks 
here, not us.  They make potato chips and 
stuff, and it s like they re putting you 
on a hamster thingy... I mean, a wheel--

BRIAN
(panicking)
You re not explaining it right!

Brian leans out the window to address the confused crowd.

(CONT D) BRIAN
It s like when you have diarrhea... and 
the solution is slavery?

The crowd grows more perplexed.  A SWAT team sets up.22.



SCHAARCORP PRESIDENT

No really, guys, you re nailing it.

Sarah and Brian look out the window to see: the crowd of 
onlookers has grown, and now includes Steve and Laura; who 
are holding hands, truly worried for their loved ones.  Jay 
is with Paul and the other police officers. 

JAY 
(on megaphone)
Sarah and Brian!  This is Jay here.  
Guys, look, the sooner you surrender, the 
sooner you get out of prison!  

  out. freaking They re  inside. back duck Sarah and Brian

BRIAN
I don t want to go to prison!  I can t 
shower in front of other guys!  
(ramping up)
I should have never gotten high with you, 
Sarah.  This is not how I get high!

SARAH
Sorry I m not an expert stoner like you!  
All I know is we laid this out perfectly 
to President Douchebag, when we were...

SARAH AND BRIAN
(lightbulb)

exhales a huge cloud of smoke.  Now she s confident.

SARAH
Strap in, Brian.  Here we go. 

SWAT rifles are trained on Sarah, who addresses the crowd.    

(CONT D) SARAH

truth, so if you ve got sunglasses,

Oh, hey Mrs. Ramsey!  When did you go 
bald?

END OF ACT THREE23.



ACT FOUR


INT./EXT. SARAH S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

The standoff between Sarah and Brian and the police below 
is at its apex.  Among the onlookers, we see Steve 
comforting Laura.  A freshly STONED Sarah is mid-oration.   

SARAH
People, think about this.  Corporations 
are creating the problem and marketing 
the solutions.  Connect the dots... Leaky 
pens, stain removers and pocket 
protectors.  They ve created a Hamster 
Wheel of Necessity!  

Brian pokes his head through the window.

BRIAN
And we re the hamsters!

SARAH
They sell cold floors, slippery rugs, and 
no-slip pads.  Why don t they just make 
the bottom of the rugs out of no-slip 
pads?  Because then they couldn t sell 
you no-slip pads!  

The crowd starts to MURMUR in agreement.  Some ONLOOKERS 
are getting inspired.  

ONLOOKER
It s true!  They also sell marbles, 
crutches and armpit salve!   

ONLOOKER #2
Yeah, and baseballs, bats, and new 
windows!  

ONLOOKER #3
Sad movies, tears, and tissues! 

ONLOOKER #4 
Jets, airline tickets, and other places!

The crowd is starting to enjoy this.  A MAN turns to a GUY. 

MAN
What s going on here? 

GUY
I don t know.  Everyone s saying three 
things. 24.



MAN
Cool.  Mice, cats, and dogs!


CONTINUOUS - APARTMENT SARAH S INT.

From the window, Sarah and Brian see the SWAT team nearing 
the apartment entrance. 

BRIAN
Dude, I think the cops are moving in.

SCHAARCORP PRESIDENT
Oooh, you guys are bus-ted!

SARAH
It s not over.  We re high.  We can think 
of something.  Maybe I left myself a 
voicemail.

She checks her phone.  It s blinking. 

(CONT D) SARAH
Sweet!  I hope it s from me.

SPLIT SCREEN: This time it s Sober-Sarah talking, High-
Sarah and Brian listening.

SOBER SARAH 
Sarah.  It s you.  Sober you.  I need you 
to know something.  You re re-tarded when 
you re high.  Just stick to Prosecco.   
Please believe me.  This is real!  

Return to: NORMAL SCREEN.  

The DOOR BUSTS OPEN.  Paul and Jay charge in, guns drawn.  

OFFICER PAUL
Everyone freeze!

Sarah slumps.  She knows the jig is up.  

SARAH
Brian, I am so sorry for dragging you 
into this mess.  We should have never 
listened to high-me.

Brian holds Sarah s hand.

BRIAN
Don t apologize, Sarah.  I m glad we hung 
out together, no matter what the legal 
ramifications might be.
(MORE)25.


BRIAN (CONT'D)
(then)
And if I do go to prison, I ll just wear 
underpants in the shower.  What s the 
worst that can happen?  They tease me?

Paul and Jay rush to the SchaarCorp President, untying him.  

PAUL
There you go.

SCHAARCORP PRESIDENT
Oh, thank God. 

JAY
And here you are.

Jay puts the SchaarCorp President in handcuffs!  

PAUL
We just discovered that your company has 
been stealing Valley Village s pets just 
so your photocopier and telephone pole 
division could turn a profit.

SARAH
Stolen pets, photocopiers, and telephone 
poles?  Huh, that s impressive.

SCHAARCORP PRESIDENT
I knew I d get caught someday, but it was 
worth the ride.  

PAUL
(to Sarah and Brian)
And, ah, sorry I yelled at you guys over 
the megaphone.  At the time, we didn t 
know you were just citizen s-arresting 
this perp.

JAY
You can expect your  Helpful Villager  
ribbons in four to six weeks.

Paul and Jay leave, with the SchaarCorp President in 
handcuffs.  Sarah and Brian are spent.

SARAH
So I don t think I can smoke pot again.

BRIAN
Yeah, today was pretty wacko.  I might 
need to take a break from weed myself.

Hey Brian, you ready for some Laser-
Bowie?

and Steve turn and leave.  After a beat, Brian returns. 

BRIAN
Sarah, you know you re welcome to come. 

SARAH
I know, Brian... I know.  

Brian stays in the doorway for an awkward beat, then exits.   

STEVE (O.S.)
Is she coming?

BRIAN (O.S.)
Nah, it got weird again.


INT. SARAH S APARTMENT - NIGHT (NIGHT 1)

Sarah is in bed, saying good-night to Doug.

SARAH
Well, Dougie, today was strange.  I 
learned that rekindling an old friendship 
is as simple as kidnapping a corporate 
executive.  And I learned that Laura and 
Steve bowl.  Who knew?  But the most 
important thing I learned today is 
something my old pal Brian taught me: 
bacon spelled backwards is  nocab ... 
which is what black people can get.
(then)
Goodnight, Doug.  You may be half-Pug and 
half-Chihuahua, but you re all-mine. 


INT. LASERIUM - NIGHT

Colorful lights reflect off their faces.  Steve is 
impossibly happy as tears of joy tell us how high he is.
