By the time a teacher separated them, 
Luke was sitting on Manny s chest.

He keeps calling me his nephew.

MANNY
You are my nephew.

LUKE

MR. BALABAN
Okay, okay.  I m getting the sense 
that you all are related somehow.  So, 
it s probably best if you work this 
out at home so the boys can go back to 
class, okay?

Parents all AD-LIB agreements.  Luke and Manny start out.

(CONT D) BALABAN MR.
But we re not happy about this, boys.  
This is not how mature young men 
behave.

There s your note for Miss Passwater.

Hearing this, Phil starts to laugh but quickly contains it.

Gloria, we all know you d be fine *

I mean, we know it s not about that.*

No, it s about my new family which has

In fact, you re probably one of those *
women who doesn t even know it.*

GLORIA*
No, I know it.*

PHIL*
So, it s natural for Claire to wonder *
about you and her dad.  This family is *
very protective of each other.  I *
remember the first time Claire brought *
me home.  Did Jay think I was good *
enough for his little girl?  No way.  *
But over time, he realized that I *
loved Claire just as much as he did.  *
And by that time Mitch had brought Cam *
home, so I was golden.  Claire just *
needs a little time and then, trust *
me, she ll be the most loyal friend *

Well, there s kind of a lot of drama.

JAY
(with some difficulty)
Let me ask you something.  Your sister 
said Gloria would never go for someone 
who looked like me.  Now you guys are 
basically like women that way -- you 
all look at guys -- so what do you 
think?

MITCHELL
You re asking us if you re attractive?*

JAY
I know I m no Erik Estrada, I m just 
curious --

So if I was sitting in one of your *
bars and there s some Righteous *
Brothers playing, would you, I don t *

MITCHELL*
Get out of here.*

JAY*
Yeah, fine.  Whatever.*

Jay turns to walk off.*

MITCHELL*
Dad --*

CAMERON*
Okay, Jay, I think it s a little too *
weird for a son to say that to his *
father, but just for the record, you *
are smoking hot.*

Hmm.  So face, body, whole package?*

CLAIRE*
Gloria, I don t know what Phil s been *
saying or why he s covered in your *
underwear --*

Obviously I m trying to seduce him for *
his money.*

Phil laughs, nervously.  Claire glares at him.*

Because that s what I do, right?  So *
what do I have to give back so 
everyone trusts me?  These earrings?*

She takes them off.*

No.No.

This bracelet?*

She takes it off.*

PHILCLAIRE
No.No.

Okay.  Just let me ask you one thing, *
and it s okay if the answer is no.  *
Are you happy I married your father?*

CLAIRE*
Happy?*

GLORIA*
(a little bothered)*
I knew it.*

CLAIRE*
I m still getting used to it, that s *
all.  You don t expect to wake up one *
day with a new mom that looks like she *
fell off a tool calendar.  But I m *
happy you make him happy, which you *
do, in many ways --*

Oh my god, how could he fumble that?*

JAY*
The center blew the snap!  QB didn t *

CAMERON*
I hate that.  I was a center and I got *
blamed every time the quarterback was *
clumsy.*

Well, I was a quarterback and it was *

I ve blocked most of it out.  I m not *
