                                  JACK*
                    That s exactly what I want to talk *
                    to you about.  No one in corporate *
                    knows about my  cardiac event  and 
                    I intend to keep it that way.  I m 
                    back, Lemon.  I ve had the most 
                      productive summer of my life.

                      I realized that NBC owns hundreds *
                    of hours of footage of Jerry 
                    Seinfeld from his massively 
                      successful series  Seinfeld.   My *

                                  LIZ
                    Does Jerry Seinfeld know you re 
                    doing this?

                                  JACK
                    Jerry s in Europe with his family 
                    right now.  By the time he gets 
                    back,  SeinfeldVision  will already 
                    be a huge hit.  His kids ll go to 
                    school and the other kids will say, 
                     Hey, your dad was awesome on 
                     Medium  last night.   He ll love 
                    it.  

                                  LIZ
                    Uh-huh.  Well, I had a great summer, *
                    too.  I started a quilt.  I did yoga *
                    twice a week.  I wore flip-flops in *
                    public.  This is really going to be *
                    my year. *

                                  JACK*
                    What about Floyd?*

                                  LIZ*
                    We broke up.  We agreed that it was *
                    crazy to try it long distance.  And *
                    I feel great about it.*

                                  JACK*
                    How are you really?*

                                  LIZ*
                    I m fine with it.  I m great.*

          (sighs)(re: quilt)
      Ugh, Lemon, there are two *
      things I know for certain.  *
      You will never finish that *
      quilt, and you are not over  know.***I
      Floyd.*


                                  LIZ (CONT D)*
                    No, I really am, Jack.  This is my *
                    year, I m telling you.  The show s *
                    gonna be great.  I feel positive *
                    that I will meet someone else.  *

                                  JACK*
                    Probably not.  Statistically.*

                                  LIZ*
                    That s not true.  I know a woman, *
                      thirty-seven, met a guy on the *
                    internet.  Turned out he lived half *
                    a mile away, they were married *
                    within three months. *

                                  JACK*
                    That s an urban myth. *

                                  LIZ*
                    No it s not.  It happened to my *
                      friend... s cousin... in Canada.*

                                  JACK*
                    It s apocryphal.  At your age you *
                    have a better chance of being eaten 
                    by a shark than getting married.

                                  LIZ
                    Okay, bye.  Great seeing you.  I m *
                    glad we re both doing great.  *

                    Yo, Ken, I m gonna need to use this 
                    kitchen area as my bathroom.  
                    Spread the word.

                                  LIZ
                    What is this?

                                    KENNETH
                    Mr. Jordan s wife kicked him out.

                                  TRACY
                    She froze my credit cards, Liz 
                    Lemon.  She even got custody of 
                    Grizz.  Can I keep my cockatiels in 
                    your office?

                                  LIZ
                    No.  Go home and apologize to your 
                    wife.

                                  TRACY
                    I m not apologizing,  cause for 
                    once in my life I didn t do 
                    anything wrong.  Liz Lemon, how 
                    many years have you known me?

                                  LIZ
                    One.

                                  TRACY
                    So you know I like to minister to 
                      transvestite prostitutes.

                                  LIZ
                    I don t think I did know that.

                                  DOTCOM
                    It s true.  He doesn t mess with 
                    them, just tries to get them into 
                    computer school.

                                  TRACY
                    So Labor Day weekend, I see this 
                    young she-dude at the dumpster by 
                    40/40, so I pull over to say,  Hey, 
                    you don t gotta live like this.  
                    You can be a freak-a-deek and do 
                    data entry.  Or how about court

                    Oops.  So not only are you holding 
                    hands with a male prostitute, but --

                                    KENNETH
                    They confused it with Mrs. Jordan.  
                    Yes, ma am.  And they think she...

                     looks better here than she did at

                    write my blogs, and do the cooking 
                    for Taco Wednesdays?

                                  LIZ
                    Kenneth, you re in charge of 
                    helping Tracy with anything non-
                    sexual that Angie would normally do 
                    for him.

                                  TRACY
                    So he ll be, like, my office wife?

                                  LIZ
                    Sure.  

      Liz exits.  Tracy, who was already down on one knee 
      unpacking, takes off his wedding ring and holds it up to 
      Kenneth.

                                  TRACY
                    Kenneth Parcell, will you take this

                    around?
                          (off Jerry s confident

                    Okay, how about this.  Come back 
                    Thursday and let me pitch you a 
                    revamp of the whole 
                       SeinfeldVision  campaign.  I

                    Fine, I ll come back Thursday.  
                          (as if it s a threat)

                                  LIZ*
                      Bridesmaid, yes.*

      Liz looks over and sees another WOMAN trying on  her  dress.*

                          (to herself)*
                    That s my dress.*
                          (to the stranger)*
                    No.  Don t.  Don t buy that.  It s *
                    ugly on you.  You ll thank me.*

      The woman gives her a look like,  that s rude, but maybe *
      true?   She goes to take off the dress.*

                          (to saleswoman)*
                    Is that dress still on sale?*

      The saleswoman nods.*

                    You know a lot of women buy their *

                    just trust the fact that the *

      The saleswoman nods as if this makes sense.*

      Liz holds the wedding dress up to herself in the mirror on 
      the back of her office door.  It is gorgeous.  She thinks 
      about trying it on.  Just then Jack bursts in, disheveled and 
      frantic.  Liz quickly hides the dress.

                                  JACK
                    I m in crisis mode, Lemon.  I ve 
                    already sold twenty million dollars 
                    in ad time for  SeinfeldVision.   
                    Now Jerry s trying to pull the 
                    plug.  It s alright.  I thrive in 
                    crisis mode.  It brings out the 
                    best in me.  And the fact that I 
                    have not one idea of how to solve 
                    this only energizes me more.  I was 
                    up all night brainstorming.

      Jack flips through a yellow legal pad he s clearly been 
      writing on a lot.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Number one: kill Seinfeld.  Number 
                    two: kill Seinfeld, then kill 
                    myself.  Number three: kill 
                    Seinfeld, flee to Svenborgia --*

                                  LIZ
                    Jack, I m not having the best day

      He flips several pages in.

                                  JACK
                    Number seventy: you seduce 
                    Seinfeld.

                                  LIZ
                    Why is me seducing Seinfeld all the 
                    way at seventy?

                    These are terrible ideas.

                                  JACK
                          (snapping at her)
                    There are no bad ideas in 
                      brainstorming!

                    It s all right.  Something ll come 
                    to me in the eleventh hour.

                    It always does, Donaghy!  You 
                    devil!

      Jack exits as abruptly as he entered.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                    I saw the way you were staring at 
                    Seinfeld.  You used to look at me

                    I m not even gonna dignify that 
                    with an answer.  Especially after I 
                    picked out all these new throw 
                    pillows for in here and you didn t 
                    even notice!

      Kenneth storms out revealing a ridiculous amount of throw 
      pillows.  Tracy looks hen-pecked.*

                                                                            CUT TO:



      EVERYONE S around.  Jenna enters and stops all activity with 
      her ridiculous outfit.  Vertical striped top, vampire collar, 
      big upswept hairdo, lots of contour blush.  She addresses 
      Pete because he s the closest.

                                  JENNA
                    I know what you re thinking.  How 
                    did I lose twenty-five pounds in 
                    one day?  I didn t!  It s all 
                    visual trickery.  Drawing the eye 
                    up.

      Frank can t stop cracking up.  He rushes over to Liz s door.

                                  FRANK
                    Hey, Liz, you gotta see this.  
                    Jenna looks bananas --

      He throws the door open and catches Liz trying on the wedding 
      gown.

                     Cause you know what?  I don t need 
                    society s permission to buy a white 
                    dress.  Who says this is a wedding 
                    dress anyway?  In Korea, they wear 
                    white to funerals.

      By now, everyone else has crowded around her door.

                                  FRANK
                    Wow, she s further gone than we 
                    thought.  Alright, I m in charge 
                    now.  Everyone go home.

                                  LIZ
                    No.  I m not crazy, Frank.  I m 
                    making a statement.  That if need *
                    be, I will marry myself.  And I am 
                    not embarrassed that you guys are 
                    seeing me wear this.

                          (calling her bluff)
                    So you re intending to wear that 
                    all day?

                                  LIZ
                    Yeah, Toofer, maybe I am.

      Cerie pokes through the crowd with a message.

                                  CERIE
                      Seinfeld s here and Jack s not 
                    ready, so you have to give him

                      Wonderful.

      Liz pushes past them all in the dress with attempted dignity.  
      As she passes by Jenna, Frank takes a cell phone picture of 
      both of these crazy women and looks at it, delighted.

                                  JERRY SEINFELD
                    Very nice.  I d really like to see 
                    your presentation now, Jack.

      Jack stands and paces behind Jerry.

                                  JACK
                       SeinfeldVision,  giving America 
                    the shows they like, with the star 
                    they love for one incredible month *
                    of television.  When we first came *
                    up with the concept... we, uh...

      At a total loss, Jack goes to choke Jerry.  Jerry senses 
      something and jumps up.

                                  JERRY SEINFELD
                    What the hell are you doing?!

                                  JACK
                    I got nothing, Jerry.  Please!  I 
                    need this!  I already sold the ad 
                    time.

                                  JERRY SEINFELD
                    What is wrong with you people?  
                    What happened to this network?!

      Jerry opens the door to exit and Kenneth is right there, 
      staring like an idiot.  It startles Jerry.

                                  JERRY SEINFELD (CONT D)
                    Agh!  Call off your goons!

      Jack comes in close to Jerry, tenacious and swift.

                                  JACK

                    You let me do  SeinfeldVision  for 
                    three nights, I give one point five *
                    to the charity of your choice,

                    on  The Today Show,  and you tell 
                    me the name of that country you 
                    went to.

                    One night, Doctors Without Borders, 
                    Roker in a bee costume, Grenyarnia. 

      They shake hands.  It s a deal.  Jack is triumphant.

                                                                            CUT TO:



      Liz is sitting in the middle of the studio, still in the 
      wedding dress, eating from two take-out dinners at once.  
      Tracy passes through carrying bodega flowers.

                                  TRACY
                    Oh no.  Did a Korean person die?

                                  LIZ
                    No, Tracy.  It s a wedding dress.

                                  TRACY
                    Don t do it, Liz Lemon.  I know 
                    what Kenneth and I have looks 
                    perfect from the outside, but it s 
                    work, dammit.  It s work.

      He leaves.  She continues to eat.  Jack enters and finds Liz 
      looking like Miss Havisham.

                                  LIZ
                    How d it go with Seinfeld?

                                  JACK
                    I pulled it off.

      Unable to find a napkin, Liz wipes her hand on her sock.

                    My God, Lemon.  What happened?  I 
                    thought this was your year.  30 ROCK 201: "SeinfeldVision"  33.

                      I couldn t even hold it together *
                    for one week.  I m not like you, *
                    Jack.  I can t have a heart attack *
                    and act like it never happened.  I *
                    can t break up with someone and *
                      immediately recover.  I m not you.  *
                    I m just me.

                                  JACK
                          (reprimanding)
                    Don t ever say that you re just 
                    you.  You are much better than you.  
                    I ve put too much time into you for 
                    you to give up like that.  This is 
                    going to be our year, Lemon.  Give 
                    me the ham.

      She gives him the ham.  He helps her up.

                                                                            CUT TO:
