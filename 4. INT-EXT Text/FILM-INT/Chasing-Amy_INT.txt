A pile of COMIC BOOKS are on a shelf next to myriad
others. The most prominent one is called BLUNTMAN AND
CHRONIC'.
A hand reaches in and pulls one out of frame.
HOLDEN opens the comic and flips through it He shakes his
head.
BANKY looks over his shoulder.
BANKY
Felt Like this fucking day would never
come.
Issue two - on the shelf.
HOLDEN
Yippee.
BANKY
Don't start, alright!
This is a cool
moment, and I'd appreciate you not
trying to ruin it.
How often does
a guy get the opportunity to purchase
something with his name on it!
(points to name on cover)
Banky Edwards- right!
(points to the other)
Holden McNeil.
HOLDEN
I know my name.
BANKY
C'mon, sour puss.
We got the rest of
our lives to be artists.
But it's
supply and demand.
And right now,
the unwashed masses demand this.
HOLDEN
(off comic)
This is easy, alright!
And right now
it pays the bills.
Just don't forget
that we're better than this.
BANKY
I'll tell you who we're better than:
these two fags right here.
They approach the counter, where STEVE-DAVE, the store
manager, and WALT the Fan-boy, play a card game.
BANKY
(lays books on the counter)
Alright Old-Maid's - take a break from
the Crazy-8's marathon and ring us up.
STEVE-DAVE
(not looking up)
Well, well,well, Walt Did you see who
it is!
The local celebrities.
Quick -
get them to autograph one of their
books so we can sell it for triple
it's value.
WALT
I'm not that in need of fifteen cents
right now.
They snicker and high-five one another.
Holden rolls his
eyes.
BANKY
You guys operate the smallest, ladies'
bridge circle I've ever seen.
WALT
For your information, we're playing
Crimson Mystical Mages' - an
overpower card game. Not that either
of you would give a shit about
something as advanced	as this -
there are no dick or poopie jokes
involved.
BANKY
(to Holden)
I don't think they're fans.
WALT
No, we're not.
You're both a couple
of fucking no talents that got lucky.
STEVE-DAVE
And obviously your handlers or hangers-
on convinced you that your first comic
was good which it was not it was
thoroughly mediocre with a few spiky
bits of dialogue.
And when you get
your foot in the door of the business,
what do you do!
You turn out a piece
of shit like Bluntman and Chronic'.
WALT
Tell him, Steve-Dave.
STEVE-DAVE
(off comic)
Bluntman and Chronic'.
Pah.
What was that thing the little stoner
pulled on the villain in the last
issue!
WALT
The Stinky-palm.
STEVE-DAVE
Stinky-palm.
You give comics a bad
name I tell all my customers not to
buy it, to spend their money on a real
comic book.
WALT
Fucking one hit wonder, dime-store
Frank Miller's.
STEVE-DAVE
This is the reality at Comic-Toast -
you're not going to get your ass
kissed here, because both me and Walt
think you suck.
WALT
And me.
STEVE-DAVE
I said that.
Steve-Dave offers the boys his two middle fingers, then
goes back to playing his game with Walt.
Holden and
Banky stare, shocked.
Banky nudges Holden and they both
exit Steve-Dave and the Fan-boy slap hands and go back to
playing.
WALT
I've got a dragon card - forty power-
ups and twelve life points!
Ha!
I
get your elf card!
STEVE-DAVE
You're such a bitch!
But thankfully,
I've saved a dark forces Shaman card
for just such an occasion.
WALT
You suck!
Eighty six life-power
points to my twenty two!
STEVE-DAVE
I schooled their asses, now I'm
schooling your's.
Suddenly.
A trash can crashes through the front window.
Steve-Dave and Walt hit the deck like bitches, covering
one another.
They look up slowly. Steve-Dave leaps to
his feet and looks at the shattered mess.
He pulls
something off the garbage can and reads it.
WALT
You know it was those two fucks!
Let's call the cops and have them
busted!
I know where their studio is!
Or better yet, let's sue!
You can sue
them, Steve-Dave!
STEVE-DAVE
(still reading note)
That won't be necessary.
WALT
What?!
Why the hell not!
STEVE-DAVE
(holds up check)
Because this is a check for three
times what that window cost.
(reading note)
Dear critics - thanks for the
insight. But like my grandmother
always said - Fuck 'em if they can't
take a joke.. and break their window.'
Kiss it,		Banky the Hack.
P.S. - Your card game blows.
WALT
He said Kiss it!
CREDITS
A physically large FAN - sweaty brow, tote bag bursting
with comics - leans forward, smiling.
FAN
Could you sign it To a really big
fan!
Holden sits at a table.
Across from the barely-managing-
to-stand Fan.
He offers him a patronizingly kind, half-
smile in return,
HOLDEN
You bet.
We're at a Comic Book show, specifically at a book-
signing. Behind Holden hangs a large banner, heralding
HOLDEN McNEIL AND BANKY EDWARDS -
CREATORS OF BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC'. Beside it is a large
mock-up of the comic book cover which features two stoner
super-heroes who bear a
striking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly
neighborhood drug
dealers, Holden hands the book back to the Fan.
FAN
I love this book man!
This shit's
awesome.
I wish I was like these guys
- getting stoned, talking all raw
about		chicks and fighting
supervillains!
I love these guys!
They're like Cheech and Chong' meet
Bill and fed'!
HOLDEN
I like to chink of them as
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern' meet
Vladimir and Estragon'.
FAN
Yeah!
(beat)
Who!
BANKY signs the book of another COLLECTOR.
COLLECTOR
So you draw this!
BANKY
(signing the comic)
I ink it and I'm also the colorist.
The guy next to me draws it.
But we
both came up with the characters,
COLLECTOR
What's that mean - you ink it'!
BANKY
Well.
It means that Holden draws the
pictures in pencil, and then he gives
it to me to go over in ink
COLLECTOR
So you just trace!
Banky freezes up.
He composes himself and continues
signing.
BANKY
It's not tracing.
I add depth and
shading to give the image mere
definition. Only then does the drawing
really take shape.
COLLECTOR
You go over what he draws with a pen -
that's tracing.
BANKY
(hands book back to
Collector)
Not really.
(calling out)
Next!
A LITTLE KID steps up but the Collector lingers.
COLLECTOR
Hey man.
If somebody draws something
and then you draw the same thing right
on top of it, not going out-side the
designated original art what do call
that!
LITTLE KID
(shrugs)
I don't know.
Tracing?
COLLECTOR
(to Banky)
See?
BANKY
It's not tracing.
COLLECTOR
Oh, but it is.
BANKY
(to Little Kid)
Do you want Lour book signed or what?
COLLECTOR
Hey - don't get all testy with him
just because you have a problem with
your station in life.
BANKY
I'm secure with what I do.
COLLECTOR
Then say it - you're a tracer.
BANKY
(grabbing Little Kid's book)
How should I sign this?
LITTLE KID
(grabs book back)
I don't want you to sign it, I want
the guy that draws Bluntman and
Chronic to sign it.
You're just a
tracer.
COLLECTOR
Tell him, Little Shaver.
Holden accepts a comic from another Fan.
HOLDEN
(off comic)
Who do I sign it to!
Before Holden can finish, a loud crash is heard.
He
looks to his left and freaks.
Banky is throttling the Collector from across the table.
The Collector attempts to fight him off.
SECURITY GUARDS
pull them apart. Holden grabs Banky.
COLLECTOR
Jesus!
All I did was call him a
tracer!
BANKY
(to Collector)
I'LL TRACE A CHALK LINE AROUND YOUR
DEAD FUCKING BODY, YOU FUCK?!
HOLDEN
(to Security Guard)
Could you get him out of here!
The Security Guards drag the collector away.
COLLECTOR
Hey, wait a sec!
He jumped me!
And
you're dragging me away!!
(exiting)
Fucking tracer!
BANKY
(calling OC)
YOUR MOTHER'S A TRACER!!
HOLDEN
Can I explain the audience principle
to you!
If you insult and accost
them, then we have no audience.
BANKY
He started it!
Fucking cock-knocker!
He's lucky I didn't put my pen through
his thorax!
HOLDEN
Need I remind you...
(holds up watch)
Curtain's in ten minutes.
HOOPER fills the frame.
He comes off like a typical, pro-
black/anti-white homeboy.
HOOPER
For years in this industry whenever an
African-American character - hero or
villain - was introduced usually by
white artists and writers - they got
slapped with racist names that singled
them out as negroes: Black Panther,
Black Lightning, Black Goliath, Black
Mantra, Black Talon, Black Spider,
Black Hand, Black Falcon, Black Cat..
VOICE FROM CROWD
She's white.
HOOPER
She is?
(beat)
Well bust this - regardless.
We're at a panel discussion.
The room is full.
Five
creators sit at a long table, their names on placards in
front of them.
(One of them is a very striking Girl.)
The banner behind
them reads WORDS UP - MINORITY VOICES IN COMICS'.
HOOPER
(holds up comic)
Now my book, White-Hating Coon',
doesn't have any of that bullshit. The
hero's name is Maleekwa, and he's a
descendant of the black tribe that
established the first society on the
planet, while all you European mother
fuckers were still hiding in caves and
shit, all terrified of the sun. He's a
strong role model that a young black
reader can look up to, Cause I'm here
to tell you - the chickens are comin'
home to roost, ya'll: the black man's
no longer gonna play the minstrel in
the medium of comics and Sci-
Fi/Fantasy!
We're keeping it real,
and we're gonna get respect -
by any means necessary!
During the speech, Holden and Banky enter and sit up
front.
HOLDEN
(calling out)
Bullshit!
Lando Calrissian was a
black man, and he got to fly the
Millennium Falcon!
Hooper whips his head around, looking for the source of
the comment
HOOPER
Who said that?!?
HOLDEN
(standing)
I did!
Lando Calrissian is a positive
black role model in the realm of
Science Fiction/Fantasy.
HOOPER
Fuck Lando Calrissian!
Uncle Tom
nigger!
Always some white boy gotta
invoke the holy trilogy'! Bust this -
those movies are about how the white
man keeps the brother man down - even
in a galaxy far, far away.
Check
this shit.
You got cracker farm-boy
Luke Skywalker, Nazi poster boy -
blond hair, blue eyes.
And then you've got		Darth
Vader: the blackest brother in the
galaxy.
Nubian God.
BANKY
What's a Nubian?
HOOPER
Shut the fuck up!
Now Vader, he's a
spiritual brother, with the force and
all that shit.
Then this cracker
Skywalker gets his hands on a light-
saber, and the boy decides he's
gonna run the fucking universe - gets
a whole Klan of whites together, and
they're gonna bust up Vader's hood
the Death Star.
Now what the fuck do
you call that!
BANKY
Intergalactic Civil War!
HOOPER
Gentrification.
They're gonna drive
our the black element, to make the
galaxy quote, unquote safe' for white
folks.
HOLDEN
But Vader turns, out to be Luke's
father.
And in Jedi, they become
friends.
HOOPER
Don't make me bust a cap in your ass,
yo!
Jedi's the most insulting
installment, because Vader's
beautiful,		black visage is
sullied when he pulls off his mask to
reveal a feeble, crusty white man!
They're trying to tell us that deep
inside, we all want to be white!
BANKY
Well isn't that true!
Hooper explodes, He pulls a nine millimeter from his
belt, draws on Banky and fires.
Banky goes down, falling
forward into the crowd The crowd screams and starts to
scatter, Hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists
in the air.
HOOPER
BLACK RAGE! BLACK RAGE!!
I'LL KILL
ANY WHITE FOLKS I LAY MY MOTHER
FUCKIN' EYES ON!!!
The crowd-is gone.
Holden sits in his chair, laughing.
Hooper steps off the stage and picks Banky's head up off
the floor.
HOOPER
(breaking character)
What's a Nubian!'
Bitch, you almost
made me laugh!
Hooper sounds different Actually, he sounds gay.
Actually - he is.
Banky smiles.
BANKY
Well what about you!
You didn't tell
me you were going to scream Black
Rage'.
I nearly pissed myself.
HOLDEN
How do you manage to get away with
this all the time?
Shouldn't cops be
busting your head open right about
now?
BANKY
Wrong coast.
HOOPER
(off gun)
Well this right here - she full of
blanks, okay.
And Opiate gets all
sorts of legal clearances before I go
on.
HOLDEN
Your publisher condones these
theatrics!
HOOPER
Condones?
Honey, they insist.
I need
to sell the image to sell the book
Would the audience still buy the
Black Rage' angle if they found out
the book was written by a.. a...
BANKY
Faggot.
HOOPER
When you say if it sounds so sexy...
(he kisses Banky full on the
lips)
BANKY
(wipes his lips)
Hey, hey!
I'll play your victim, but
not your catcher.
VOICE
How is it that you sound like Minister
Farakhan when you're on stage..
They turn to see...
A beautiful, blonde, ruffled-haired angel swinging her
purse in a circle. Her name is ALYSSA.
She's the
striking Girl from the panel who didn't get to say much.
ALYSSA
...and the King of Pop when you're
nor.
HOOPER
Look out, boys - this kitten has a
whip.
ALYSSA
(shoves and slaps him)
Always before I get to speak!
I swear
- the next con I attend and they ask
me to be on the minority panel, if I
see your name anywhere near the List,
I'm passing.
HOOPER
(defending himself)
Holden.
Banky - this pile of P.M.S.
is Alyssa Jones.
She does that book
Idiosyncratic Routine'.
This is the
fourth panel we've been on together,
and even though she knows my publisher
sets this up and pays for the event.
She still gets mad when it ends with
my act.
ALYSSA
I just wish I was the one who gets to
shoot you.
HOOPER
That's what my father said when I came
- nay - leapt out of the closet
(off guys)
These boys do Bluntman and Chronic',
which outsells both of our books put
together, hence they're never on a
panel with the likes of us.
They
slumming right now.
BANKY
I've read your book.
It's cute.
Chick stuff, but cute.
Holden hits him.
BANKY
What?
HOLDEN
(shoots him a look; to
Alyssa)
Sorry about him.
He's dealing with
being an inker.
ALYSSA
(to Banky)
Oh. You trace!
Banky seethes.
HOLDEN
(shaking her hand)
I really enjoy your book I'm surprised
we've never met at any other Con's
before.
ALYSSA
Lose the dick or change your skin tone
and we can get to know each other on
panel after panel while the Pink Black
Panther here plays Chuck D. for the
fanboys.
HOOPER
Hey, jealousy.
(to the Boys)
I told Alyssa I'd buy her a post-rave
drink.
Do the Garden-Staters have to
sprint to the Lincoln Tunnel, or can
you stay for a round in the big, scary
city!
BANKY
We're gonna take off soon...
HOLDEN
We'll go.
Banky offers Holden a puzzled glance.
Then he nods to
Hooper.
BANKY
We'll go.
INT BAR - NIGHT
Holden, Banky, Alyssa and Hooper sir around a table
drinking, talking, and smoking.
BANKY
Archie, alright!
Archie and the
Riverdale gang were a pure and fun-
lovin' bunch.
You can't find
dysfunction in those comics, because
they were just flat out wholesome.
HOOPER
Archie and Jughead were lovers.
(sips his drink)
BANKY
Shut the fuck up.
HOOPER
It's true.
Archie was the bitch and
Jughead was the butch - that's why
Jughead wears that crown-looking hat
all the time: he the king, of queen
Archie's world.
BANKY
Man, I feel a hate-crime coming on
HOLDEN
He's got a point.
Archie never did
settle on Betty or Veronica.
BANKY
Because he wanted them both at the
same time, you assholes!
He never
chose one because he was trying to get
both of them into a three-way!
HOOPER
(pulls out a dollar and hands
it to Banky)
Here.
I want you to go down to the
corner store and buy yourself a clue.
Go on.
BANKY
Eat it.
Urkel.
HOOPER
I told you to watch it with that Urkel
shit.
Face it, girl - Archie's a
sister.
BANKY
(getting up; to Hooper)
That's it.
You.
HOOPER
Moi?
BANKY
You are marching back across the
street with me, and we're going to
pick up a shit load of Archie books, I
am going to prove to you - beyond the
shadow of a doubt that Archie was all
about pussy.
Come on.
HOOPER
(sliding out of booth)
This boy is conflicted, I shall play
mother-therapist for him.
You two sit
tight.
We shall return promptly.
Banky and Hooper exit, leaving Alyssa and Holden alone at
the table.
ALYSSA
Is he always Like that!
HOLDEN
For years now.
Started back in third
grade - a nun was teaching us about
the Blessed Trinity.
She's going on
about the three persons in one God
thing - Father, Son, Holy Spirit - and
he just goes ballistic.
I guess it
was too big for him to grasp.
They
got into this huge fight.
ALYSSA
Please.
How bad could it have been!
HOLDEN
You ever seen a nun call a small child
a fucking cunt-rag'?
Wasn't pretty,
Shit like that's bound to happen when
you make a kid wear a matching tie and
slacks everyday.
ALYSSA
And your parochial school
misadventures!
HOLDEN
Limited to wine-tasting prior to mass.
Turned me into a grade school
alcoholic altar boy.
I couldn't tell
you how many mornings after serous
benders		I'd wake up next
to strange priests.
ALYSSA
Aren't you the sharp wit!
HOLDEN
Sharp!
No.
I'm just a fan of clergy-
molestation humor.
Probably why the
extended family quit inviting me to
First Communion parties.
Alyssa laughs.
Holden smiles.
ALYSSA
(looking OC)
You play darts!
HOLDEN
Not professionally.
You know - only
in bars.
AT THE DART BOARD
A dart hits the board then, one hits the wall beside the
board.
Alyssa winds up with another dart.
Holden watches. Her's
always hit. His never do.
ALYSSA
So your new book seems to be selling
like mad.
HOLDEN
It goes back to something my
grandmother told me when I was a kid.
"Holden," she said "The big bucks are
in dick and fart jokes."
She was a
church-goer.
ALYSSA
Uh-oh - the cry from the heart of a
real artist trapped in commercial hell
- pitying his good fortune.
I'm sure
you can dry your eyes on all those fat
checks you rake in.
HOLDEN
I'm sorry - did I detect a note of
bitter envy in there!
ALYSSA
Nope.
I'm happy my stuff gets read at
all.
There's very little market for
hearts and flowers in this spandex-
clad, big pecs, big tits, big guns
field.
If I sell two issues, I feel
like John Grisham.
HOLDEN
(looking out window)
It's all about marketing.
Over- or
underweight guys who don't get laid -
they're our bread and butter.
People
like those two outside should be
yours.
Through the window, we see a COUPLE making out on the
hood of a car.
HOLDEN
And sadly, there are more of our core
audience out there than yours.
(smiles)
Look at that, though - kind of gives
you a little charge, to see two people
in love.
And all over Banky's car, no
less.
That car's seeing more action
right now than it's seen in years.
ALYSSA
Bubbly guy like that, it's hard to
figure out why.
HOLDEN
(still looking at OC Couple)
You've gotta respect that kind of
display of affection.
It's crazy,
rude, self-absorbed - but it's love.
ALYSSA
That's not love.
HOLDEN
Says you.
ALYSSA
That out there!
That's fleeting.
HOLDEN
Fleeting.
ALYSSA
Uh-huh.
You wanna hear about love!
Oh, I'll tell you about love.
HOLDEN
A story?
ALYSSA
The story.
The original love story.
HOLDEN
'Doctor Zhivago'.
ALYSSA
Nope.
My mother's uncle.
He was a
millionaire.
HOLDEN
Get out.
ALYSSA
I kid you not.
HOLDEN
Explain.
ALYSSA
All through high school, he dated this
one girl.
They
were inseparable.
And when they graduated, she went off
to Carnegie Mellon...
HOLDEN
In Pittsburgh.
ALYSSA
I'm impressed.
So he stays in the
home town, and they begin their long-
distance relationship.
The plan is,
on the
third Sunday of every month,
he'll train out, spend a week then
train back They do this for four
years.
HOLDEN
That is love.
ALYSSA
Not nearly finished.
Two months
before she's going to graduate, he's
got this job digging graves, and he
comes across...
HOLDEN
A stiff.
ALYSSA
A steamer trunk containing silver
ingots.
HOLDEN
Get out of here.
ALYSSA
Many, many silver ingots.
Now, my
mother's uncle being quite the
ingenious chap - he buries the trunk
again and heads up to the main office,
where he proceeds to purchase a
cemetery plot.
Guess which one?
HOLDEN
Clever.
ALYSSA
So now he owns the plot and all of its
contents.
Two
days later, my
mother's uncle is worth three million.
HOLDEN
At which time he marries the high
school sweetheart and lives happily
ever after.
ALYSSA
Not even close.
Inside the steamer
trunk, stenciled into the wood, or
something like that, is a curse.
HOLDEN
Someone wrote 'Fuck' inside his new
steamer trunk.
ALYSSA
Not that kind of curse.
A cryptic
curse "Great fortune means great loss"
it said.
HOLDEN
What kind of asshole writes that
inside a steamer trunk!
ALYSSA
The same kind of asshole that buries
silver ingots.
The day my mother's
uncle is heading out to see the girl,
he stops at his accountant's to grab
some cash, and winds up missing his
train.
So he has to take the next one
- which he does - and he gets there an
hour later than his usual time of
arrival, whereupon he sees lights.
HOLDEN
A hero's welcome for the new
millionaire.
ALYSSA
It seems that while she was standing
on the platform waiting that extra
hour for my mother's uncle to show up,
the girl was dragged into the bushes
by an unknown assailant, raped and
gutted.
Holden is silent Alyssa downs her drink.
ALYSSA
The assailant was never apprehended.
HOLDEN
(beat)
That's a love story!!
ALYSSA
Yes, and here's why: my mother's uncle
rode that train every day for the rest
of his life.
One day up, the next day
back.
Did that 'till the day he died.
He donated the fortune he'd acquired
to the train station in Pittsburgh, to
have a well-lit terminal built.
The train line let him ride for free
after that.
HOLDEN
I should hope so.
Jesus, that's the
saddest tale I've ever heard.
ALYSSA
That's my love story.
Alyssa tosses her last dart.
Holden seems a bit dazed.
He looks out the window.
HOLDEN
Those two aren't on the hood of
Banky's car anymore.
ALYSSA
I told you It wasn't love.
(grabs her purse)
I gotta split.
It was really nice
meeting you.
I wish you the best of
luck with your book.
(shakes his hand)
Tell Hooper I'll call him later.
And
tell your friend to calm down.
Alyssa exits to the night.
Holden stares after her.
Two
beats later, Hooper and Banky enter, holding an
'Everything's Archie' comic between them.
BANKY
You're insane.
Archie is not fucking
Mister Weatherbee!
HOOPER
Deny, deny, deny.
(to Holden)
Where's Alyssa?
HOLDEN
Huh!
Oh.
She left.
She said she'd
call you later.
BANKY
(off comic)
He's just offering to help Archie with
his homework!
HOOPER
Read between the lines.
BANKY
(shoves book at him)
Fuck this.
(to Holden)
Let's go.
Traffic.
(no response from Holden)
Holden!
HOLDEN
(shaken)
What!
BANKY
Let's go.
HOOPER
(looking out window)
D'jou see that dent in the hood of
your car!
BANKY
(looking out window)
What the...!
Son of a bitch!
Banky runs out Holden shrugs at Hooper.
HOOPER
Let me guess: you like her!
HOLDEN
Who?
HOOPER
Miss Alyssa Jones.
HOLDEN
She's alright.
HOOPER
As long as that's all.
(finishes drink)
Maybe you can convince that partner of
your's to drop me off downtown before
you scurry out the tunnel!
HOLDEN
(beat)
Mister Weatherbee wasn't really trying
to fuck Archie, was he!
They begin exiting.
HOOPER
Hell no.
Weatherbee was Reggie's
bitch.
We're in Holden and Banky's studio/apartment.
It's a
rented loft-style place with high ceilings, wood floors
and sparse furnishings.
There are posters on the walls,
a sort of kitchenette, a hockey net, a big TV. (with all
the trimmings - VCR, Laserdisc player, Sega, SNES), a
huge comfy couch, and two drawing boards with adjacent
desks (littered with pencils, pens, coloring pencils,
paints, erasers, etc.) - at which sit Holden and Banky.
They're working.
Some music plays.
C.U. OF HOLDEN PENCILING - over his shoulder, we see
Holden sketching Chronic in mid-attack of his arch-
nemesis - the Giggler.
Holden erases a line and re-
draws.
C.U. OF BANKY INKING - over his shoulder, we see Banky
outlining a pre-penciled page.
He traces Bluntman
swinging from a street light.
The two work in silence.
Then...
BANKY
(not looking up)
This is one of the best street lights
you've ever drawn.
HOLDEN
It's the one across from the post
office.
BANKY
Looks just like it.
HOLDEN
Thanks.
(beat)
What do you wanna do tonight!
BANKY
Get a pizza.
Watch 'Degrassi Junior
High'.
HOLDEN
(erases)
You got a weird thing for Canadian
melodrama.
BANKY
I've got a weird thing for girls who
say 'aboot'.
The phone starts ringing.
Holden answers it, while still
drawing.
HOLDEN
Bank-Hold-Up.
CROSSCUT between Holden and Hooper.
He's on a phone in a
CLUB.
HOOPER
Hooper here.
Listen, I know how you
burb-fiends hate the city, but there's
a club shindig going down that I think
you'd get into.
HOLDEN
Where is it?
HOOPER
Place called Her-sterectomy - I'm
tempting as bar-keep.
HOLDEN
I don't know, Hoop.
We're prepping
the next issue, and we've got our big
M-TV meeting in the morning.
HOOPER
I told her you wouldn't be interested.
HOLDEN
Told who?
HOOPER
Alyssa.
HOLDEN
Alyssa from last night Alyssa?
HOOPER
How do you begin and end a question
with the same word like that?
You got
skill.
Yes, that one.
She asked me
to invite you.
Now here's the part
where you say...
HOLDEN
I'll be there.
HOOPER
Thought so.
Ten o'clock.
Later.
(both hang up)
BANKY
Who was that?
HOLDEN
Hooper.
He invited me to a club.
BANKY
When's that faggot going to learn -
you like chicks.
HOLDEN
(getting up)
Not that kind of a club.
BANKY
So when we leaving?
HOLDEN
'We'?
You can't go.
He's setting me
up with Alyssa.
BANKY
And?
HOLDEN
And I don't want you messing it up.
BANKY
Like I care about your shit.
Maybe
I'll hook up myself.
HOLDEN
(pulling on coat)
I just told you - it's not that kind
of club.
BANKY
How does one man get to be so funny!
HOLDEN
(throws him his coat)
How are you going to get home if I
hook up!
BANKY
Like that'll happen.
HOLDEN
Let me explain something to you, my
witless chum the other night in that
bar, we two - Alyssa and I shared a
moment, alright!
BANKY
Oh, you had a moment!
HOLDEN
(brings his two pointer
fingers together)
We shared a moment.
And in that
moment, one thing was made abundantly
clear: this girl loves me, my friend.
Loves-me.
It's a club - people are mingling, a band is playing,
it's loud.
But something's fishy.
Hooper's tending bar.
He hands a GUY a drink.
The Guy sips it.
GUY
This is so watered down.
It's
terrible.
Why is it you can never get
a decent drink in these places!
Hooper looks around in a very exaggerated fashion.
GUY
What are you doing!
HOOPER
Trying to find you a tissue.
The Guy shoots Hooper an angry glare, Banky enters.
BANKY
Alright - bring on the free hootch.
HOOPER
As long as you don't bitch about how
little alcohol is in the drink.
(hands Banky a drink; to Guy)
You owe me five sixty.
GUY
(off Banky)
And I suppose you're going to make
your friend here pay for his drink
right!
BANKY
Hey, I befriended a guy in a position
of authority so I could abuse that
authority and get free shit.
You want
to do the same?
There's a lonely
Hindu works at the'7-ll' across the
street.
Get in tight with him.
The Guy angrily pulls out his money and slams it on the
bar.
GUY
I work at that '7-11'!
(storms away)
BANKY
(calling after him)
Wanna be friends!
HOOPER
Where's your better half!
BANKY
Taking a piss.
Guy's got a bladder
like an infant.
HOOPER
That's funny - he says you're hung
like an infant.
BANKY
Must his mother tell him everything!
Holden enters.
BANKY
What'd you do - fall in love?
HOLDEN
Where is she?
HOOPER
Over there...
ON THE DANCE FLOOR - in the middle of a thrall of people -
dances Alyssa.
She moves like a cat and she's looking
very sexy.
OC HOOPER
Been dancin' for an hour.
Hasn't
stopped yet.
Hooper, Holden, and Banky stare OC.
BANKY
She ain't no Denny Terrio, I'll say
that.
Holden smacks Banky and moves to exit.
HOOPER
Wait. wait, wait - there's something
you should know.
HOLDEN
She's got a boyfriend.
HOOPER
Well.. no.
HOLDEN
Then what's to know?
Holden exits; They watch him go.
Banky looks around.
BANKY
There're a lot of chicks in this
place.
HOOPER
'Chicks'.
You're such a man.
BANKY
(beat)
He didn't really say that about my
dick, did he!
ON THE DANCE FLOOR - Holden slips into the crowd and
dances up to Alyssa.
He intentionally bumps into her.
HOLDEN
(fake rage, dancing)
Hey, hey, hey - you fucked up my
cabbage-patch!
ALYSSA
Well, well, well - Bluntman himself.
Or should I call you Chronic!
HOLDEN
Call me flattered.
I heard you sent
me the invite to this little soiree'.
ALYSSA
From a former home-town girl, to
Mister Home-Town himself.
HOLDEN
You're saying you're from the 'burbs!
ALYSSA
Middletown, N.J.
HOLDEN
Get out of here!
I'm from Highlands!
ALYSSA
I know.
Hooper told me.
HOLDEN
How is it that we never ran into one
another?
ALYSSA
You graduate from Hudson?
HOLDEN
Yeah.
Eighty eight.
ALYSSA
I went to North.
Also eighty eight.
HOLDEN
What a small fucking world.
So you
know the tri-town area!
ALYSSA
Quiz me.
HOLDEN
Miller Hill?
ALYSSA
I wrote my name on the wall.
HOLDEN
Sandy Hook?
ALYSSA
Lost my virginity there.
HOLDEN
This is so cool.
The mall!
ALYSSA
Eden Prairie of Menlo Park!
HOLDEN
Wait - here's the big test: Quick
Stop!
ALYSSA
My best friend fucked a dead guy in
the back room.
HOLDEN
You know that girl!!
ALYSSA
I did.
Before she was committed.
HOLDEN
You know what this is!
This is fate.
ALYSSA
(regarding her move)
No, this is the 'Rog'.
HOLDEN
I was talking about us meeting - what
are the chances!
ALYSSA
Pretty slim.
I haven't been back to
the 'burbs since my friend's funeral.
HOLDEN
The Quick Stop girl died!
ALYSSA
Another friend - Julie Dwyer.
She
died in the..
HOLDEN
Y.M.C.A pool!
Damn!
You knew her
too!
ALYSSA
So well.
HOLDEN
One friend in an asylum, the other
friend in the grave.
You're a
dangerous person to know.
ALYSSA
But I can tap.
(does an impromptu tap dance)
That was the Buffalo Two-Step.
HOLDEN
Very solid.
ALYSSA
That's what six years of tap lessons
yields.
HOLDEN
Two towns away from each other for
years and we had to meet in New York.
The Sand stops playing. People clap.
ALYSSA
Coulda been worse - we could have not
met at all.
Holden looks at her.
OC SINGER
Thank you.
Thanks.
The SINGER on stage speaks into the microphone.
SINGER
A long time ago, we used to have this
bass player who took off one day to
draw funny books or something.
Maybe
you've seen her stuff - it's called
'Idiosyncratic Routine''
The crowd applauds.
Alyssa shakes her head, smiling.
Holden pokes her.
SINGER
But what a lot of people don't know is
that she used to harbor these
delusions that she could sing.
And
she used to subject us to these
throaty renditions of Debbie Gibson
tunes and shit, insisting that we let
her front on a few numbers.
Well, we
didn't and she quit.. and then she got
famous, the bitch.
(crowd laughs)
But she's here tonight, and I think if
we all begged, or maybe offered her
some X, she'd get up here and treat us
to some of her vocal stylings.
(crowd applauds)
What do you say, Alyssa?
Alyssa shakes her head no.
The crowd urges her.
Holden
pushes her forward.
SINGER
She's shy.
(yelling)
GET UP HERE AND SING, BITCH!!
The crowd thunders.
Alyssa offers the Singer an
embarrassed half-smile.
She looks at Holden, who claps
along with the others and nods toward the stage.
Alyssa
shakes her head and relents, heading through the crowd
Banky and Hooper stand at the bar.
BANKY
This is so queer.
(he exits)
HOOPER
(beat)
You don't know the half of it.
Alyssa jumps on stage, hugging the Singer.
She takes the
mic, shaking her head.
The crowd is applauding.
ALYSSA
She is such a twat.
The crowd cheers.
Alyssa laughs.
She turns to the band
and says something which they nod.
She turns back to the
crowd.
ALYSSA
Alright.
I should dedicate this,
right?
(thinks)
This is for that special someone our
there.
Holden smiles.
Banky joins him.
Holden glances at him.
Banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile.
The band starts playing.
Cross cutting begins.
Alyssa launches into a torchy tune.
The song is
extremely sexy - as is Alyssa who works the mic, making
direct eye contact with...
Holden.
Or does she!
Holden is smiling, being seduced,
Banky rolls his eyes.
Beside Holden, stands a pretty
GIRL with a short haircut, who's also riveted by Alyssa's
performance.
Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out
there.
The song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at.
It's more than obvious there's a seduction going on, bur
of whom!
At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but
Alyssa's preoccupied.
She points to someone in the
crowd, and curls her finger back in a 'c'mere' fashion,
urging whoever it is to join her.
She jumps off the
stage.
Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw-
shucks style.
At that moment, the Girl beside him leaps
forward.
Banky's eyes widen.
Holden looks up and is
suddenly taken aback.
Alyssa and the Girl race into each other's arms and fall
into a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss.
Holden's eyes bug.
Banky allows a smile to creep across
his face.
The crowd applauds.
Banky looks around, and
for the first time, we get the distinct impression that
this is a lesbian bar...
There are a lot of chicks in this place.
Gay chicks.
Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back.
BANKY
Now that, my friend, is a..
(brings his fingers together,
mimicing Holden)
...shared moment
Holden continues to stare - mouth agape.
Alyssa and the Girl continue to kiss.
Banky, Holden, Alyssa and the Girl from the dance floor
sit around a table.
Alyssa and the Girl continue to make
out.
Holden and Banky casually watch, wide-eyed.
Banky
stares a little harder.
Holden hits him.
BANKY
What?!
HOLDEN
(under his breath)
That's rude.
BANKY
Man, when are we ever going to get a
chance to see this kind of shit live
without paying for it?
Alyssa and the Girl break their kiss.
ALYSSA
Uh-oh - better knock it off: we're
getting a man excited.
HOLDEN
Sorry.
It's just... new to him.
BANKY
Oh, and you're an old hand at this.
ALYSSA
No, I should apologize.
I don't
usually get all mushy in public.
But
it's been awhile since I've seen Kim
here.
KIM
(formerly the Girl)
Tell me you didn't set that gross
display up with the band just so you
could nail me.
ALYSSA
Like I'd have to go through that much
effort
KIM
You know what!
I want to dance.
ALYSSA
Go ahead.
I'll watch from here.
KIM
(tugging at her arm)
No.
I want to dance with you.
ALYSSA
Don't be such a rag.
I have to sit
here and work up the desire to fuck
you later.
KIM
Please.
Kim exits.
Banky is smiling ear-to-ear.
Alyssa looks at
him.
ALYSSA
Yes?
BANKY
You said 'fuck'.
To that girl.
You
said you'd 'fuck' her.
ALYSSA
And?
BANKY
How can a girl 'fuck' another girl!
Were you talking about strap-ons or
something?
HOLDEN
(hits him)
Would you shut up!!
BANKY
What!!?
It's a valid question.
You
know the dyke stuff in the Penthouse
Letters section is written by guys -
this is our chance to get the inside
scoop.
HOLDEN
(to Alyssa)
I don't know how many times I can
apologize for him.
ALYSSA
It's okay.
Secretly, all I really
want is to be the center of attention.
(to Banky)
I've never used a snap-on.
BANKY
Then what's with saying 'fuck?
Shouldn't you say 'eat her out' or at
least modify the term 'fuck' with
something like 'fist'?
ALYSSA
Let me ask you a question - can men
'fuck' each other!
BANKY
Ask Hooper.
ALYSSA
In your estimation.
BANKY
Sure.
ALYSSA
So for you, to 'fuck' means to
penetrate.
You're used to the more
traditional definition - you inside
some girl you've duped, jack-hammering
away, not noticing that bored look in
her eyes.
BANKY
Hey - I always notice the bored look
in their eyes.
ALYSSA
(laughs)
'Fucking' is nor limited to
penetration, Banky. For me it
describes any sex when it's not
totally about love.
I don't love Kim,
but I'll fuck her.
I'm sure you don't
love every girl you sleep with.
BANKY
Some of them I downright loathe.
ALYSSA
But I'll bet it's different with the
ones you love.
I'll bet you go the
full nine when it's not just a quick
fix - like you go down on them longer
or something.
HOLDEN
Here we go.
BANKY
I don't do that.
ALYSSA
What?!?!
BANKY
I stopped dropping.
It got to be too
frustrating.
HOLDEN
As stupid as you usually come off
during this diatribe of your's, you're
going to come off ten times as stupid
on this occasion.
BANKY
What?!
I lost my tolerance for the
bullshit baggage that comes with
eating girls out.
What's the big
deal?!
ALYSSA
If you say the smell, so help me, I'll
slug you.
BANKY
Not the smell - the smell is good.
I'm talking about not being able to do
it property.
And my mother brought me
up to believe that if I can't do
something
right I shouldn't do it at all.
Of
course, my father told me she gave
lousy head, but that's beside the
point.
ALYSSA
At least you blame yourself for your
sexual inadequacies.
BANKY
No, I blame them.
Chicks never help
you out.
They never tell you what to
do.
And most of them are self-
conscious about that smell factor, and
so most of the time they just lay
there, frozen like a deer in the
headlights, right?
Not for nothing,
but when a chick goes down on me.
I
let her know where to go, and what the
status is.
You gotta handle it like
CNN and the Weather Channel - constant
updates.
HOLDEN
You're such an idiot.
ALYSSA
No, he's got a point.
That's how I
was in high school - I was nervous,
and inhibited about being eaten out.
But by the time I got to college, that
all changed.
I loosened up.
Not only
did I learn to communicate - I learned
to be bossy.
I was like one of those guys at the
airport with those big flash lights -
waving them this way, directing them
that way, telling them when to stop.
BANKY
And that's all I'm saying, it'd be
different if chicks helped out -
pointed a guy in the right direction.
Then there'd be no bullshit, no wasted
time, and no chance for permanent
injuries.
ALYSSA
Permanent injuries?
BANKY
Sure.
You wanna see something
permanent!
(pulls our front tooth)
I got this from Nina Rollins,
sophomore year.
I'm going down on
her, and out of nowhere, her cat jumps
on her stomach.
She does this big ol'
pelvic thrust - cracks my tooth in
half, sends it down my throat.
I had
to get a crown for the stub.
ALYSSA
(to Holden)
I got that beat.
(to Banky)
I got that beat.
(half-turns and lifts chin)
Sophomore year.
I'm going down on
Cynthia Slater in her dorm room after
we went club-hopping.
I'm totally
drunk, and in the middle of it, I fall
asleep - right there in her lap.
She
got so mad, she digs her heel into my
back, right there.
(points to scar)
That's permanent.
BANKY
You see this!
(moves neck slightly right)
That's the farthest I can move my neck
to the right Sophomore year, I'm going
out with Maria Bennert, and for six
months, I'm going down on her, and not
a damn thing's happening.
Then one night, I change a position,
or vary my lapping-speed, and suddenly
it's a whole new world.
She's moving
around, convulsing, breathing heavy.
And her legs are pressing against my
ears so tightly that I don't hear her
father come into the room.
He grabs
my hair...
(grabs his own hair and pulls
back)
...and he pulls me way back, hard.
ALYSSA
(throws up her leg, and rolls
up pants)
Senior year.
Spring Formal.
I'm
eating our Missy Kurt in her brother's
car.
She's laying across the back
seat, and I'm half-hanging out of the
car, my knees on the ground.
She's
flailing around, and she knocks the
parking brake off.
The car starts
rolling down the hill, and my right
knee is cut up all to shit like a
kiddy's scissor class cut it up for
paper dolls.
Banky and Alyssa laugh.
Holden looks at a small scar on
his arm and thinks better about mentioning it.
Then Kim
re-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck.
HOLDEN
(off Banky's watch)
Holy shit, is that the time.
We've
gotta beat traffic.
BANKY
What traffic - it's one thirty in the
morning!
HOLDEN
(getting up)
And rush hour starts in six hours.
Let's go.
(to Alyssa)
Thanks for inviting us out.
It was...
educational.
Alyssa waves at him as he exits.
Banky slides out of the
booth.
BANKY
(to Kim)
Since you like chicks, right..
do you just look at yourself in the
mirror all the time?
Holden reaches in and pulls Banky out.
Alyssa watches
them go, then turns and kisses Kim.
Holden looks preoccupied.
Banky flips through magazines,
biting off mini pieces of the gum he's chewing.
He
sticks them between pages, presses the mag closed, picks
up another one and then repeats the whole process.
A
Receptionist types.
BANKY
(off Holden's look)
You're still dwelling on the dyke,
aren't you?
HOLDEN
Lower your voice.
BANKY
What'd I tell you - she just needs the
right guy.
All every woman really
wants - be it mother, senator, nun -
is some serious deep-dicking.
The Receptionist stops typing and looks at Banky,
shocked.
BANKY
(off her look)
Don't give me that look - I heard Adam
Curry say worse.
The Secretary goes back to typing.
Banky shrugs at
Holden.
BANKY
That's why I can't buy lesbians.
Everyone needs dick.
See, I can buy
fags.
Bunch of guys that need dick -
just plain need it?
That I get.
Dykes?
Bullshit posturing.
But -
live and let live, I guess.
HOLDEN
I'm sure the gay community appreciates
your support.
JOHN SLOSS, the boy's lawyer, joins them.
SLOSS
Please tell me you haven't blown this
deal already.
BANKY
Sloss like a mother fucker.
(slaps his hand)
SLOSS
Hey, every mother but your's - a
shyster's gotta have his standards.
Shall we?
The EXECS are a casual couple of guys, sitting on couches
across from our trio.
EXEC 1
We just want to start off by saying
that it's a pleasure to finally meet
you.
While it's been - shall we say -
an experience dealing with Sloss here,
one of the main reasons we started
this whole thing was to meet the guys
that do 'Bluntman and Chronic'.
EXEC 2
(points at them)
'Snootchie Bootchies'.
The Execs and Sloss laugh.
Holden and Banky politely
join in.
Banky shoots Holden a 'these guys are idiots'
look.
EXEC 1
Which brings us to our proposal: we
are extremely interested in doing
twelve, half-hour 'Bluntman and
Chronic' cartoons.
The age of Beavis
is coming to a close, and we're
looking for something... something...
BANKY
Even more retarded and juvenile to
sate the voracious, intellectually-
challenged miscreants that make up
your key demographic.
The Execs laugh hard.
Sloss secretly shrugs to Banky and
gives the thumbs up.
EXEC 1
(composes himself)
So what do you say! Are we in
business!
Banky leans back into the couch, wearing a thoughtful
face.
He looks to Holden, then to Sloss.
Sloss nods in
understanding.
SLOSS
Jim, Sean - could we have a few
minutes!
EXEC 2
(looks to Exec 1)
Uh... absolutely.
We'll just..
EXEC 1
Uh...wait outside
The Exec's smile and head our, closing the door behind
then.
Sloss turns to Banky.
SLOSS
So?
Did I do good?
BANKY
You did better - you sold us out!
They clasp hands and quietly explode in ebullience.
SLOSS
Do you know how much you'll make on
merchandising alone!
BANKY
(as Simon Bar Sinister)
Money and Power, and Money and
Power...
SLOSS
(joins in)
Money dnd Power, and Money and...
HOLDEN
(interrupting)
I don't think it's a good idea.
Banky and Sloss freeze.
They stare at Holden.
BANKY
What's not a good idea!
Please don't
say the cartoon, please don't say the
cartoon...
HOLDEN
The cartoon.
SLOSS
What?!?
Are you out of your fucking
mind!
BANKY
(getting up)
John, let me handle this.
( to Holden)
You are out of your fucking mind,
aren't you!
HOLDEN
Is this how you want to be remembered!
As the guy who created Bluntman and
Chronic!
Banky sits at the Exec's desk and starts rifling through
the guy's stuff.
BANKY
No, I'd like to be remembered as the
filthy rich guy who created Bluntman
and Chronic.
HOLDEN
But it'll be all glossy and main-
stream.
We'll lose any artistic
credibility we ever had.
SLOSS
(to Banky)
Is it me!
I don't see the problem.
BANKY
(to Sloss)
He just has to get over this crush of
his.
SLOSS
Oh God - not on Carrie Fisher again!
(to Holden)
Holden - she's not really a Princess.
BANKY
(opening drawer with a letter
opener)
Not on her; on Alyssa Jones - the
chick that does that comic book
'Idiosyncratic Routine'.
You ever
seen it?
SLOSS
Please.
Like I even read your comic,
let alone anyone else's,
(to Holden)
I'm not limited to offering you legal
counsel only, my friend.
I'm also
learned in the ways of the heart, and
can offer you this advice - nail her,
get it out of your system, and move
on.
Like we say at Sloss Law - good
fences make good neighbors.
BANKY
She'd never let him in her yard.
The
chick's gay.
SLOSS
(laughing)
She's gay?
You fell for a gay, comic-
book writing chick?
Holden, you poor,
poor man!
(beat)
Wait a sec - does she have
representation!
BANKY
Always working, you.
(holds up a Polaroid of a
naked woman)
Look at this - Mrs. M-TV Exec has a
string of pearls hanging our of her
ass,
SLOSS
Would you leave his stuff alone!
(to Holden)
You can break her resolve, killer.
All it takes is one good man.
But if
it takes two good men, don't hesitate
to call me.
That being said, in
regards to the more pressing issue, I
suggest you leave art to the museums
and grab on with both hands to the
big, fat check.
HOLDEN
I'll give it some thought
BANKY
(holding up Polaroid)
I'm taking this as a precaution - just
in case they give us any shit about
pussy's decision delay.
(glaring at Holden)
You'll 'give it some thought'.
You're
so retarded
HOLDEN
I'm retarded!
This from the guy who
only forty five minutes ago paid fifty
bucks for what's supposed to be a boot-
leg of 'March of the Wooden Soldiers'
with a deleted scene of Stan Laurel
wearing a French Tickler.
SLOSS
How'd you fall for that!
BANKY
The guy who sold it to me had an
honest face.
There is a door.
There's a knock at the door.
Holden
opens it and Alyssa is standing there.
ALYSSA
Somebody told me that they make comic
books here, and I've got an idea for
this story about a guy who comes to a
club and high-tails it when he finds
out this girl is pay.
Any interest in
a story like that!
Holden smiles.
