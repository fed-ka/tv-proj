THE TEMPLE is an impressive place of worship -- tapered
columns and an ornate Egyptian facade -- at the apex of a
hilltop VILLAGE, in FLAMES, under ATTACK by a PERSIAN ARMY.
SUPERIMPOSE:
"496 B.C."
WHAM! THE STEEL PRONG of a mounted BATTERING RAM swings into
the ornate DOORS of the temple. PERSIAN SOLDIERS operate the
brutal siege engine, SLAM the doors again and again.
THE MAU settles by a SATELLITE DISH, looking down on a
present-day suburban street, a busy main drag. MARSHLAND and
WATER are visible not far away, light RAIN FALLS.

SUPERIMPOSE:
"2500 YEARS LATER."
The MAU watches as, ACROSS THE STREET, a BUS pulls away from
the curb to reveal a WOMAN in a HOODED WHITE PONCHO
-- the outfit recalls the high priestess of Bast.
The HOOD is thrown back, revealing PATIENCE PRICE, 25-35,
attractive but inclined to conceal her looks -- hair over her
face, baggy clothes under her poncho. She's cautious, eager
to please, to do what's expected of her
-- a bit of a doormat.
Patience looks up from an address scribbled on a scrap of
paper, and straight toward the cat on the roof -- almost as
if she'd sensed its presence. She smiles.
THE MAU holds her gaze for a beat, then slinks out of sight.
An eccentric, ramshackle home amongst neat, well-kept houses.
PATIENCE moves to the front door, RINGS. As she waits, she
notes the lawn GRASS grown high, CLIMBING CAT SCULPTURES on
the shingles. A SIGN by the door: "FELINE RESCUE SOCIETY."
EDNA POWERS opens the door on a chain. She's 50-70, a former
academic, intelligent, charming, but quite intimidating.
EDNA
Yes?
PATIENCE
Hi, Edna Powers?
(off her nod)
I'm Patience Price, I called about adopting a cat?
I saw your flyer at my vet's office --
EDNA
Oh yes, do come inside.
EDNA undoes the chain, opens the door for her.
-- CAMERA SWINGS UP the 40-story skyscraper in the business
district of a city mixing architecture old and new. CAMERA
PASSES a WINDOW WASHER on a cable-driven rig.
NEARING the
ROOF, we see a glowing sign which reads "AVENAL BEAUTY" --
and a PASSENGER CHOPPER coming in for a landing.
THE CHOPPER touches down on a HELIPAD atop an elevated
PENTHOUSE. GEORGES AVENAL emerges, ducking in the blade
wash. The company's CEO, Georges is charismatic, handsome,
immaculately tailored -- an exacting asshole to the core.
Getting out of the helicopter behind him, his menacing,
silent bodyguard ANGEL carries a leather suitcase or two.
LAUREL AVENAL trots toward her husband with open arms.
Laurel is 30-something, a still-gorgeous super-model but, in
person, a tad past her prime. She comes across as sweet and
well-meaning, but a bit dim and victimized.
LAUREL
Oh honey, welcome back!
She throws her arms around Georges to give him a kiss, but he
pushes her away, turns aside to SNEEZE.
(CONTINUED)
12.
CONTINUED:
LAUREL
Are you all right?
GEORGES
My allergies. I thought you were getting rid of
that vile dog of yours.
GEORGES plucks a long DOG HAIR from her clothes, holds it up
for her to see, then moves on briskly, down an external
flight of stairs from the helipad to a PENTHOUSE below.
Laurel follows after him, Angel in the rear.
LAUREL
Georges, when you're gone, Tippy is all I've got
and -- I get so lonely.
GEORGES
So get a bird or a fish, something that doesn't
shed.
(a glance at her)
Have you gained weight?
They head through glass doors into the PENTHOUSE.
START on a JEWELRY DISPLAY, a ritzy DIAMOND NECKLACE.
SALLY's face appears in the window, beaming.
SALLY
Wow... sorry, Patience, I just found a new best
friend.
PATIENCE, beside her, WHISTLES appreciatively, then moves on.
PATIENCE
I'm sick of drooling over things I'll never have.
The two are WINDOW-SHOPPING, passing a SHOE STORE, boots
and high-heels... A WESTERNWEAR SHOP, belt buckles, WHIPS...
SALLY
Oh, you're a ray of sunshine. Tell you what, let
me take you clubbing this weekend --
PATIENCE
I'm not sure I'm fit to be seen in public.
SALLY
You will be in that dress.
I've had my eye on it
for weeks.
SALLY points at a MANNEQUIN in the window of a trendy
boutique, garbed in a dramatic, sexy outfit -- a short
bodice, a tiny skirt, plenty of plastic skin showing.
PATIENCE
Sally, that is not a dress, it's a rumor of a
dress. It's barely forensic evidence of a dress.
SALLY
It's a genuine Gaultier knock-off --
PATIENCE
It's not me.
SALLY
But don't you ever wanna be somebody else?
PATIENCE
I just wish I could be ten years old again -- it
didn't matter what I wore as long as I could climb
a tree in it.
(CONTINUED)
21.
CONTINUED:
SALLY
Your tomboy days are over.
PATIENCE
That's my bus, Sal, see you later.
PATIENCE trots toward a BUS, SALLY calls after her.
SALLY
This weekend, Patience. I swear, I'm gonna make
you have fun if it kills you...
As Sally moves on, CAMERA LINGERS ON the window of A LINGERIE
STORE, scantily-clad MANNEQUINS, including one in BLACK
UNDIES and a CAT MASK.
DISSOLVE TO:
DAVE BERGER, the accountant, dressed casually, gets out of a
CAB and heads into his modest home.
KA-BOOM!
The WINDOWS BLOW OUT with a HUGE EXPLOSION.
ACROSS THE STREET, a BLACK MERCEDES pulls from the curb,
HEADLIGHTS OFF, and ACCELERATES away.
CUT TO:
Patience reaches the window just in time to see --
MIDNIGHT make a SPECTACULAR LEAP across the alleyway
and --
-- LAND ON TOM LONE'S BALCONY.
PATIENCE is annoyed, but also impressed, in spite of herself.
PATIENCE
Hell of a jump...
Patience clumsily CLAMBERS up Lone's RATTLING FIRE ESCAPE,
reaches the level Midnight is on, moves toward the cat.
(CONTINUED)
23.
CONTINUED:
PATIENCE
You are not worth the trouble --
Suddenly, a WINDOW FLIES OPEN, just a foot away, a GUN points
in her face. Patience lets out a CRY, jumps
back --
LONE
Freeze!
It's TOM LONE.
But Patience loses her balance, FALLS --
-- and LANDS in an open DUMPSTER.
LONE darts from the window, alarmed, realizing his error.
ANGEL emerges, shaking his head and shrugging toward the
unseen driver of the BLACK MERCEDES, then he climbs in the
passenger door. As the car pulls away --
-- LONE hurries from the building next-door toward the alley.
PATIENCE painfully gets upright, slipping in the trash, as
LONE appears; he's a no-nonsense, gruff cop with a dry wit.
LONE
You all right?
He clambers onto the dumpster's edge to help her out, she
slips and slides, almost pulls him in after her.
LONE
I'm really sorry -- I'm a police officer, I heard
the noise and just assumed... here, grab my arm.
He manages to hoist Patience to the lip, she's able to climb
to the ground. She's drenched in GOOEY GARBAGE, just stares
at Lone, a bit dazed from the fall. She can't believe she's
face to face with the man of her dreams. Lone thinks a beat.
LONE
Habla espanol?
(CONTINUED)
24.
CONTINUED:
She blinks at him, confused, then he tentatively flashes a
few HAND SIGNS for the deaf. She waves this off.
PATIENCE
No, I -- see, my cat got out --
MIDNIGHT MEWS, rubs against Patience's leg.
She picks the
cat up, nods toward her window.
PATIENCE
I live right up there --
LONE
I know.
PATIENCE
You do?
LONE
I mean, I -- I've seen you.
Around.
PATIENCE
Really.
Actually, I've seen you too.
Around, that
is.
(a nod at the
dumpster)
Thanks for helping me out.
LONE
Don't mention it. I can't resist a damsel in
distress.
PATIENCE smiles and cocks her head... flirtatious body
language. She runs a hand through her hair, pulls out some
sticky TISSUE PAPER, looks at it with disgust.
PATIENCE
Oh God, what -- what is that?!
He looks over her shoulder, winces.
LONE
I could run it over to the lab...
She tosses it in the dumpster, finally registering that she's
drenched in WET GARBAGE.
PATIENCE
I'm sorry, it was nice talking to you, but -- I'm
completely disgusting.
(CONTINUED)
25.
CONTINUED:
Mortified, she hurries back to the entrance to her building.
Lone looks after her, amused.
CUT TO:
SPOTLIGHTS before a NIGHTCLUB, a CROWD behind a VELVET ROPE.
A HANDSOME BOUNCER stands guard. SALLY AND PATIENCE are near
the front of the line. Sally has transformed herself, with
heavy make-up, a revealing skin-tight outfit that shows
plenty of cleavage. Patience is in a conservative dress, one
she might wear to work. Sally HOWLS with LAUGHTER at
something Patience has just said. Patience looks grim.
PATIENCE
It isn't funny.
SALLY
(still chuckling)
Yes it is. All this time you've spent mooning over
that hottie neighbor and he points a gun at you --
PATIENCE
At least it broke the ice --
SALLY
I told you men go for trashy women.
Patience rolls her eyes, looks over Sally's clothes.
PATIENCE
Speaking of which -- how do you even stay in that
outfit?
SALLY
With any luck, I won't need to.
PATIENCE
I hardly recognize you.
SALLY
That's the idea. I go out at night, I leave
daytime Sally behind, become a different person.
All women do. Except you, of course.
(CONTINUED)
26.
CONTINUED:
PATIENCE
(shrugs, checks
her watch)
How long have we been here, an hour?
We're never
getting in...
A TRENDY COUPLE -- call them RANDY and SANDY -- push their
way past PATIENCE, almost knocking her over. Randy's ELBOW
gets her in the gut, Sandy's SPIKE HEEL drives into her foot.
PATIENCE
Ow!
SANDY looks at her blankly as PATIENCE hops, injured.
PATIENCE
You could say I'm sorry?
RANDY
Okay, you're sorry.
He and Sandy laugh as the BOUNCER unhooks the rope, steps
aside for them to enter.
PATIENCE
God, people are so rude.
SALLY
Yes!
Sally has just gotten the NOD, hurries forward. Patience
follows, limping a bit. The BOUNCER blocks Patience's path,
looking her over from head to toe, disapproving.
SALLY
She's with me.
BOUNCER
Then you can stay out here too.
SALLY
She happens to be a very fine human being --
BOUNCER
Like I said, she don't belong inside.
PATIENCE
Sally, just -- go in without me --
SALLY
See, you shoulda bought the dress.
PATIENCE bolts, humiliated; SALLY looks after her sadly.
27.
PATIENCE walks toward her building, the bus kiosk behind her,
the BUS MOVING AWAY. The street is deserted at this hour.
Patience feels very alone, until she looks up to see --
-- MIDNIGHT, perched in her window, awaiting her arrival.
A smile appears on Patience's face. She quickens her step,
crossing the empty street, almost to the sidewalk when --
-- AN ENGINE ROARS behind her.
Patience spins just as --
-- THE MERCEDES, LIGHTS OFF, barrels out of the darkness and
--
WHAM!
Hits her full-on.
MIDNIGHT at the WINDOW -- the cat lets out a HOWL.
ANGLE DOWN, the MERCEDES has stopped, Patience lies a short
distance behind... in bad shape. The PASSENGER DOOR OPENS.
WITH PATIENCE, barely conscious. ANGEL approaches, studies
her, turns her over with his foot. He nods, a job well done.
SLOW MOTION as MIDNIGHT LAUNCHES HERSELF AT THE GLASS --
SMASH!
CUT TO:
28.
SPLASH! A BODY (we don't get a good look) hits DARK WATER
hard and vanishes below. MOVE UP TO REVEAL we're at a bridge
over a river, CITY LIGHTS in the distance. ON THE ROADWAY,
CAR DOORS CLOSE and the MERCEDES SEDAN SCREECHES away.
CLOSER ON THE SKYLINE. A HOWL rises -- FIND MIDNIGHT, CRYING
from a rooftop. Unseen CATS join in, a feline TELEGRAPH.
The CAT CRY, just audible, far off. Then -- a CAT squeezes
out a WINDOW at the gap in the sill... more CATS SCRAMBLE out
dormers... yet MORE SHOOT OUT the flapping CAT DOOR.
EDNA'S CATS scramble through alleyways, joined by STRAYS
converging from all directions, picking up the CHORUS. It's
like a flowing RIVER OF CATS.
ON MURKY MOONLIT WATER -- CAMERA MOVES past floating TRASH, a
CAR TIRE, BOTTLES and CANS. We hear the CRIES of the CATS
from nearby, approaching. LIGHTS of the CITY further away,
the BRIDGE visible.
CAMERA FINDS a nylon-encased FOOT... PAN OVER a woman's
CORPSE, her clothes TORN, SOAKED and MUDDY, strewn with RIVER
WEEDS. The body bobs amidst REEDS by this soggy shoreline.
We reach the woman's FACE -- unnaturally pale, eyes fixed...
it's PATIENCE PRICE. Dead.
THE HOWLING is CLOSE now... THE CATS have gathered here,
parting for MIDNIGHT, a feline VIP. The Mau steps
tentatively out onto Patience's corpse, careful not to get
too wet. She crouches on her chest, and --
CLOSE, BREATHES audibly into her parted lips. A brief,
barely visible GLOW flickers at Patience's mouth.
THE CAT shudders, then moves aside, BLINKS as if drugged.
ANOTHER CAT climbs out onto Patience to take Midnight's place
and perform the same ritual.
(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:
HIGH ANGLE. The crowd of CATS waiting in the reeds, more
arriving by the minute, ready to take turns.
CAMERA ROCKETS DOWN AT PATIENCE'S FACE, into one DEAD EYE...
-- PATIENCE sits up INTO FRAME with a SCREAM.
She thrashes in the shallows of the marsh, gasping for air,
disoriented... reborn. There's no sign of the cats.
PATIENCE crawls onto shore amidst the reeds, slightly clumsy
at first, almost like a newborn kitten. Her ragged, wet
clothes cling to her body.
TIGHT on her terrified expression. She has no idea what
she's doing here -- or who, or what she is. She opens her
mouth to speak -- all that comes out is a strangled CAT CRY.
She works her jaw, but can't produce human speech. She darts
her head, seems disoriented and overwhelmed.
HER POV -- SOUNDS AMPLIFIED, IMAGE perhaps SOLARIZED, the
darkness BRIGHTENED, objects of interest HIGHLIGHTED as she
takes in the marshland. The EYES of any creature in sight
GLOW. We'll call this CATVISION.
(CONTINUED)
30.
CONTINUED:
WHIP
PAN TO a nearby CRICKET perched on a blade of grass --
then
UP TO an OWL in the distance, soaring over the park.
WHIP
DOWN TO its prey, a SCURRYING MOUSE. THE OWL swoops
with
a SCREECH, nailing the MOUSE, we hear its SQUEAL.
PATIENCE, frightened at first, becomes increasingly delighted
by her heightened senses. She spots --
MIDNIGHT in the tall grass. The cat turns, looks over her
shoulder once -- her EYES catch moonlight and GLOW. Patience
is clearly meant to follow.
PATIENCE follows MIDNIGHT on all fours, tenuously at first.
But as she proceeds, her shoulders and hips roll in
distinctly feline fashion. Her body seems slimmer, more
muscular. She rises on two legs, moving in a slinky crouch.
MIDNIGHT pauses to sharpen her claws on the bark of a gnarled
old TREE. PATIENCE follows Midnight's lead, leans forward
against the trunk, arms straight out, head arched back. She
stretches her neck, her back -- her every movement is
graceful, sensual, the awkwardness gone.
She tries to pull her hands from the tree -- but can't for a
moment, finding her FINGER-NAILS stuck into the bark (like a
cat at a scratching post).
A DOG BARKS -- without thinking about it, PATIENCE scrambles
up the side of the tree like a streak.
HER POV FROM TREE -- A LARGE DOG tugs on its OWNER'S leash,
some distance away. The dog walker yanks the dog onward.
PATIENCE takes this in, hears a MEOW --
MIDNIGHT is perched above her, very Cheshire Cat-like.
PATIENCE looks around, self-conscious for a moment -- what is
she doing up a tree? Bad idea to think. She loses her
balance, clutching at branches, tumbles out of the tree --
IN MIDAIR for an instant, she flails spastically, letting out
a SHRIEK -- then her body instinctively TWISTS and --
PATIENCE LANDS on all fours, one leg kicked out, haunches
low. MIDNIGHT lands beside her, nods approvingly at her
landing. Then the cat darts away again, Patience pursues.
31.
MIDNIGHT leaps to the top of a FENCE, staring down at
Patience -- "come on." Patience hesitates, then crouches and
SPRINGS UP (with more than human ability), lands triumphantly
on the fence -- then teeters and TUMBLES to the other side.
MIDNIGHT looks disappointed. Patience jumps up again
quickly, as if pretending this never happened, this time
managing to hold her balance.
MIDNIGHT gives her a look and leads onward. At first she's
like a tightrope walker, careful of falling, but her steps
become more confident. Soon she's moving as quickly and
smoothly as the cat.
MIDNIGHT leaps off the fence and darts across a road,
PATIENCE follows.
A tall wrought-iron FENCE surrounds greenery and distant
cages in an urban area. A SIGN: "ARBORETUM - ZOO."
MIDNIGHT squeezes through a gap between the uprights.
PATIENCE hesitates -- this is too narrow for a normal human.
MIDNIGHT waits impatiently on the other side, tail twitching.
PATIENCE makes a dubious SOUND, but manages to slip a foot --
then a leg -- into the opening, twisting and contorting.
Amazingly, she's succeeding, her torso ripples and contracts
as she insinuates herself between the bars. Finally only her
head is on the wrong side. With a final TUG, she's through.
MIDNIGHT crouches low, stalking. PATIENCE copies the
behavior. MIDNIGHT slowly approaches --
A MOTH, fluttering near a FLOWER in this botanical garden.
MIDNIGHT sneaks up close, then POUNCES, but the MOTH flies
out of the cat's grasp.
PATIENCE GIGGLES, MIDNIGHT turns on her and HISSES. The
woman and the cat roll together in this neat BOTANICAL
GARDEN, playing and batting at each other. CAMERA MOVES TO a
small sign nearby, which labels this planting as "CATNIP."
MIDNIGHT HURTLES a CONCRETE MOAT, PATIENCE follows, still
high, giggly. She suddenly finds herself face to face with:
A BENGAL TIGER.
He lets out a small ROAR.
(CONTINUED)
32.
CONTINUED:
PATIENCE blinks, crouches -- and ROARS back, unafraid. The
tiger springs forward... and LICKS HER. She wrestles with
him playfully, he's just a bigger version of Midnight.
DISSOLVE TO:
EDNA emerges in a bathrobe, crossing her overgrown lawn,
MIDNIGHT bounding ahead of her. A Martha Stewarty NEIGHBOR,
weeding an immaculate garden, throws Edna a sour look.
NEIGHBOR
Edna, your cats have been using my garden as a
litter box again.
EDNA
(gravely)
You can't change their nature.
The neighbor scowls and returns to her weeding. As EDNA
bends down for her newspaper, she hears a MEOW and
sees --
-- Midnight licking a HAND, which protrudes from under a
bush.
Edna GASPS, moves closer, crouching to get a better look.
It's PATIENCE, sound asleep, body twisted sideways in an
unnatural position. Quietly:
EDNA
Hello...?
Patience starts awake, looking around, confused.
(CONTINUED)
33.
CONTINUED:
EDNA
What are you doing in my hedge?
Patience rolls out from under the bushes, crouches on her
haunches now, a panicky look in her eyes. Leaves and dirt
cling to her clothes. She has no idea how she got here.
LAUREL'S SMILING FACE on a BILLBOARD. It's only there for a
moment, quickly plastered over with --
A NEW BILLBOARD featuring DRINA'S FACE. We're outside a
dramatic, gated industrial COMPLEX, TRUCKS with the AVENAL
LOGO, a sprawling CHEMICAL FACTORY at the center.
A HOMELESS CAMP -- tents, boxes, etc. -- nearby. BAG LADIES
stand in a line near MAKE-UP STOOLS, AVENAL GIRLS are busy
painting their faces, doing their best.
LAUREL (O.S.)
...or maybe it's the other way around...
FIND LAUREL AVENAL at a TABLE with a BANNER: "AVENAL CARES."
VIDEO CAMERAS are trained on her as she signs POSTERS,
PERFUME BOXES, etc. while talking into a MIC.
LAUREL
The point is, everyone deserves to look in the
mirror and feel good about themselves. Be we rich
or poor, we all must strive to be more beautiful
than we can be...
A PROCESS SERVER in a suit with a briefcase reaches Laurel,
places a stack of papers in front of her. She starts to sign
automatically, then stops, turns off the mic.
LAUREL
What is this?
PROCESS SERVER
Laurel Avenal, I am hereby serving you with a
restraining order.
LAUREL
What?
PROCESS SERVER
You are not to set foot within one hundred yards of
any property owned or occupied by Avenal Beauty
Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or
affiliates.
LAUREL
I -- this must be some sort of mistake --
PROCESS SERVER
You will, however, have sixty days to remain in
residence at the Avenal estate, at the end of which
time you and all your personal property must be --

LAUREL
(a desperate cry)
Georges Avenal is my husband!
The man pulls another document from his briefcase.
PROCESS SERVER
That brings me to this petition for divorce...
LAUREL looks shell-shocked. A CAMERA FLASHES. She turns and
manages to force a stiff, trembling smile for the
photographer. CAMERA FLASHES again, WHITING OUT the frame --
IRIS DOWN TO:
MULTIPLE ALARMS RING.
QUICK CUTS of STOREFRONTS, WINDOWS SMASHED -- the SHOE STORE,
the LINGERIE STORE, the WESTERN WEAR SHOP, the TRENDY
BOUTIQUE. The MANNEQUIN that had displayed the Gaultier
knock-off is now NAKED.
CUT TO:
THRONGS out front behind the velvet ropes. All eyes turn
toward an approaching FIGURE whom we don't see at first...
LOW ANGLE -- a sleek pair of black patent leather BOOTS
appears. A purring rendition of a familiar children's tune:
CATWOMAN
And the cat came back, the very next day...
MOVE UP SLOWLY to reveal the rest of the ensemble -- long
legs in BLACK TIGHTS, the short SKIRT and bodice TOP of the
dress. A WHIP is wrapped around her waist, the tip dangles
almost like a tail. Her stride is confident, sexy.
(CONTINUED)
47.
CONTINUED:
CATWOMAN
The cat came back, they thought she was a goner...
Her arms are encased in long, satiny BLACK GLOVES. A half
MASK with eyeholes and subtle cat's ears covers the top half
of her face, her hair falls free like a mane behind.
CATWOMAN
But the cat came back, she just wouldn't stay awa-
a-ay...
CATWOMAN -- the former PATIENCE PRICE -- comes to a stop in
front of the slack-jawed BOUNCER.
CATWOMAN
What's the word I'm looking for?
Oh yes... Meow.
So saying, she strokes a finger under the bouncer's chin --
CLOSE, the CLAW emerges from a SLIT in the glove's fingertip,
but doesn't draw blood.
THE BOUNCER recovers himself, unhooking the rope and stepping
aside. Catwoman strides past him into the club.
CATWOMAN hurls open the front doors, kicks aside the velvet
rope. She addresses the impatient CROWD:
CATWOMAN
C'mon in, wanna-bes! Free drinks!
THE CROWD stampedes the door. Catwoman struts away down the
sidewalk, recoiling the whip around her waist.
A couple of CLUB GOONS make it past the throng. CATWOMAN,
moving onto a highway OVERPASS, notes she's being pursued.
She puts a hand on the railing, and casually VAULTS OVER --
THE GOONS rush to the side, look out to see --
CATWOMAN strutting confidently down the narrow GUARDRAIL
between the two directions of SPEEDING TRAFFIC.
(CONTINUED)
50.
CONTINUED:
She could be out for an evening stroll, ignoring the
SCREECHING BRAKES, HORNS, and STARTLED DRIVERS. She gives
them a wave without bothering to look over her shoulder.
A CHICKEN-WIRE DOOR explodes open and a FLOCK OF PIGEONS
ROCKETS OUT of a COOP AT CAMERA.
CATWOMAN emerges in a CLOUD OF FEATHERS, brushing a few stray
ones off her outfit, with a cat-that-ate-the-canary smile.
She cocks her head, listening in different directions for a
new source of amusement -- snippets of VOICES, MUSIC,
PLUMBING SFX, passing VEHICLES... it's like tuning a radio.
Then she picks up a distant TINKLE of breaking GLASS --
CATWOMAN bounds out the exit, leaps atop BOXES, onto a window
A/C UNIT, which totters with her weight, just
as --
(CONTINUED)
52.
CONTINUED:
AN UNMARKED SEDAN screeches to a halt, and TOM LONE leaps
out, GUN ready. He trains it on CATWOMAN --
LONE
Freeze!
CATWOMAN freezes. She blinks down at LONE, he's got a clean
shot at her. She cocks her head, licks her lips.
CATWOMAN
You are cute.
LONE blinks at this uncommon response to a pointed weapon,
continues to play it by the book.
LONE
I'm a police officer!
CATWOMAN
Bet you look sweet in uniform.
And such a big
gun...
LONE
I, I -- Come down here, now!
CATWOMAN
Obviously you don't know much about cats.
I come
when I want, not when I'm told.
With that, she SPRINGS to the rooftop -- the force of her
leap knocks the A/C free of the window, LONE has to dive out
of the way as it CRASHES to the ground.
CATWOMAN, silhouetted against the sky, is having a great
time, leaping from building to building, scrambling across
rooftops. POLICE SIRENS recede in the distance.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE SUN is rising. PAN OVER a couple of GLITTERING JEWELS in
the dirt. FIND CATWOMAN in the GOLDEN MORNING LIGHT, curled
against what looks like a TIGER-SKIN PILLOW. She stirs and
groans in her sleep, like someone waking with a hangover.
(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:
She blinks and frowns at the SUNLIGHT. Where am I? She sits
up and realizes -- she was sleeping against the belly of the
BENGAL TIGER, lying on his side in his sunken ENCLOSURE.
CATWOMAN SHRIEKS and leaps to her feet, terrified, yanks OFF
HER MASK. With the daylight, she's back to being plain old
PATIENCE. She looks down in shock at her revealing outfit;
the swag bag is looped into the whip around her waist.
She's awakened the TIGER. Patience lets out another
frightened CRY as he eyes her, no longer recognizing her as a
friend. The tiger GROWLS, gets to his feet menacingly,
starts moving in for the kill.
PATIENCE scrambles for a heavily LATCHED DOOR, which she
frantically wrestles to open, getting through and SLAMMING IT
just as the TIGER LUNGES --
CUT TO:
POLICE TAPE across the entrance to the storefront. PATIENCE
approaches warily, looking around to make sure no one's
watching, nervous as hell. She sees an elderly JEWELER and a
UNIFORM COP through the window.
Patience withdraws a PAPER BAG from under her coat. She
drops this beyond the police tape, KNOCKS on the door and
RUNS. THE JEWELER comes out, looks down on the ground. He
picks up the bag -- and sees the word "SORRY!" written on the
paper. Opening the bag, he finds --
THE DIAMONDS AND JEWELS that Catwoman stole.
58.
PATIENCE comes out of a back door of her building with a
GARBAGE BAG, still looking around nervously, moving toward
the dumpster in the alley. She tosses in the bag --
ANGLE IN DUMPSTER, the BAG spills open to reveal pieces of
the CATWOMAN OUTFIT.
PATIENCE moves back for the door --
LONE (O.S.)
We've got to stop meeting like this.
She spins to see TOM LONE approaching from his sedan, parked
in a LOT off the alley. PATIENCE is wary of him now, but he
seems casual, smiling. She glances at the dumpster
anxiously, he follows her sight-line, snooping as always.
LONE
Doing some spring cleaning?
PATIENCE
Emptying the catbox, actually.
LONE quickly takes a step back from the dumpster.
LONE
So -- that was a... surprising message you left for
me.
PATIENCE
(embarrassed)
Oh, well, uh -- musta been my cold medication
talking.
She sniffles and coughs unconvincingly.
LONE
Well anyway, if you still wanted to get together --
maybe we could get a bite to eat Friday night?
PATIENCE pretends to think it over.
PATIENCE
Yeah, maybe...
A GLOVED HAND grips the edge of the DUMPSTER -- then CATWOMAN
vaults over the side, lands on her haunches, ready to rumble.
Her outfit has a banana peel stuck to it. She wrinkles her
nose, plucks this off, CLUCKING her tongue. She turns to
MIDNIGHT, prowling nearby.
CATWOMAN
That girl has got to go.
She glances up toward Lone's WINDOW -- lets out a sexy GROWL
-- and SPRINGS UP the fire escape.
A sprawling MANSION,
dark for the night, an "A" in iron
scroll-work over the
gate. FIND a SECURITY CAMERA, trained
on the area in front
of a ten-foot WALL. MIDNIGHT suddenly
leaps onto the wall,
blocking and batting at the CAMERA LENS.
WIDER, CATWOMAN, now out of the camera's view, LEAPS up the
side of the wall and lands on all fours atop it.
(CONTINUED)
64.
CONTINUED:
AT THE SIDE OF THE MANSION -- CATWOMAN scrambles up a trellis
toward a second-story window. She leaps to the ledge,
crouches, peering in.
CLOSE as a razor-sharp CLAW emerges and CUTS a CIRCLE into a
PANE OF GLASS.
Neatly kept, colorful architecture. CATWOMAN moves down
sloping eaves and swings into a turret window.
A FREIGHT ELEVATOR rises to reveal MANY CANISTERS of
YP-3.
(CONTINUED)
76.
CONTINUED:
WESLEY waves to ANGEL at the controls of a FORKLIFT -- Angel
still has dried flecks of MAKE-UP on his skin. He pulls
forward, ready to load the YP-3 into a waiting TRUCK.
WESLEY (V.O.)
(on phone)
It'll be eliminated, like the others.
We just
don't want to take any chances.
CUT TO:
LONE and PATIENCE walk close together, near the water.
LONE
Gonna have to get back to the station, I'm working
nights.
PATIENCE
Catwoman again?
LONE
Afraid so. But I have a feeling she'll be in
custody within the week.
PATIENCE
(alarmed)
Why do you say that?
LONE
Individuals who feel compelled to act out through
an animal alter-ego -- bats, birds, bugs, there
have been a number of cases in other cities -- they
catch themselves. Take too many risks, think they
can play with the cops. See, they like to be
watched...
He's staring right at her now.
Patience looks away.
HER POV -- THE SUN GETTING LOW, vanishing behind a cloud.
CLOSE, PATIENCE'S PUPILS become ELLIPTICAL for a blink.
LONE pauses, standing close.
LONE
Sorry.
Seems like all I can do is talk about work.
PATIENCE spins on him, a glint in her eye.
PATIENCE
So stop talking.
So saying, she throws her arm around his neck, the other
around his back, pulls him close for a KISS. Lone takes only
a moment to respond -- it's a good one -- until --
CLOSE ON LONE'S BACK as her CLAWS involuntarily emerge,
tearing right through his shirt and an inch down his
back --
(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:
LONE jerks away, looking back over his shoulder --
LONE
Ow!
PATIENCE clutches her hands to her face, horrified at what
she's done, starts backing away --
PATIENCE
I'm really sorry, I don't know what
got into me, I -- I've got to go.
She's on the run. A moment later, the surprised Lone
pursues, rounding a corner...
LONE
Patience, wait --
But she's already vanished.
EDNA stands in the opening of the angled storm cellar
doorway, looking down the stairs sadly.
EDNA
Sure you don't need a blanket, dear?
ON PATIENCE, at the foot of the stairs in this cold, dank
space, hugging herself, rocking back and forth.
PATIENCE
Just... lock... the door.
Edna quickly CLOSES the door, throws a BOLT.
It's extremely DARK down below. Patience starts to pace. We
see her features contort with pain as she fights this
interior battle. During this monologue, her voice becomes
huskier, more Catwoman-like.
PATIENCE
I'm not a bad person... I'm not a killer... I'm not
evil... not like Georges Aaavenal...
His name becomes a harsh GROWL.
She fights to get a grip.
PATIENCE
He's a murderer... he did this to me... it's all
his fault.
Her eyes FLICKER, elliptical for a moment --
PATIENCE/CATWOMAN
He has to die.
The sour NEIGHBOR pokes her head out an OPEN WINDOW.
NEIGHBOR
Edna, I've had it with your damn cats!
I'm calling
the cops!
She SLAMS the window SHUT.
CAMERA MOVES to find --
-- THE STORM DOORS, bolted shut. MIDNIGHT ENTERS FRAME,
begins to CLAW at the metal, slowly working the BOLT free.
EDNA emerges, sees what's happening, dashes over.
She
carries a PADLOCK.
EDNA
Midnight!
Shoo!
Midnight HISSES, but retreats sulkily. Edna reaches the
nearly free bolt, is about to replace it and lock it when she
hears a small, timid VOICE from below, through the door:
PATIENCE (O.S.)
Edna?
Edna, is that you?
EDNA
Yes, dear, I'm here.
PATIENCE (O.S.)
Edna, it worked. I think... I think I've beaten
her. I'm Patience again. I've won.
EDNA
Oh, I'm so glad...
Edna looks terribly relieved as she throws aside the bolt and
begins to open the cellar door. But before she
can --
-- THE DOOR FLIES OPEN, knocking her off her feet.
A FIGURE
STREAKS PAST. We hear her voice as she retreats:
CATWOMAN
Sucker.
CUT TO:
85.
BALLET MUSIC CONTINUES OVER. A CITY BUS passes, an AD FOR
AVENAL on the side -- it's been VANDALIZED, CLAW MARKS across
the length of it.
CRANE UP to find CATWOMAN crouched on the roof of the bus.
She leaps off from the still-moving bus --
-- onto the ROOF of a TAXI passing the other way --
-- and finally landing at the curb near --
A classical-looking CONCERT HALL, FOUNTAINS in front.
CATWOMAN creeps amongst bushes, approaching the building.
Numerous COPS patrol the entrance -- no way to get past them.
CATWOMAN creeps around the perimeter, looking for another way
in. By the curb she spots --
ANGEL, alone, near a parked LIMOUSINE, lighting a cigarette.
CATWOMAN
Those things'll kill you.
She SMACKS the cigarette out of his hand, BOOTS him into the
BUSHES and leaps on top of him.
(CONTINUED)
86.
CONTINUED:
IN THE BUSHES, CATWOMAN straddles ANGEL, bangs his head
against a cement curb.
CATWOMAN
YP-3 -- the plague -- what's it for?
ANGEL
I have no idea what you're --
BANG!
She whams his head again.
CATWOMAN
Tell me about Xavier Bartok.
ANGEL
How do you know --
She BANGS his head again.
CATWOMAN
I'm asking the questions.
ANGEL
I -- I can't tell you --
She bares her CLAWS over his eyes.
CATWOMAN
Then it's time to brush up on your Braille.
ANGEL
No, no, not my eyes!
Xavier, he's the one who's
buying the stuff!
CATWOMAN
When?
ANGEL
The deal goes down tomorrow night -- at the Avenal
offices --
CATWOMAN
Wrong.
Your boss won't live to see it.
She BANGS his head hard again, ANGEL loses consciousness.
CATWOMAN
Thanks for your help.
(CONTINUED)
87.
CONTINUED:
CATWOMAN moves around the side of the building, keeping low,
ducking behind parked cars. Fewer COPS here, but the place
looks impregnable, no way to scale the walls. She tries an
EMERGENCY DOOR -- locked, no good. She hisses in
frustration, starts to move on when --
THE DOOR OPENS behind her.
CATWOMAN spins to see --
LAUREL, her face hidden with dark glasses and a wide-brimmed
hat. She gestures frantically. Catwoman darts inside.
A SIDE DOOR swings open and CATWOMAN darts out.
She's almost
home free when SHOTS RING OUT behind her --
ANGEL, staggering out from the bushes where she clocked him,
FIRES his handgun after her.
CATWOMAN stumbles and rolls, but keeps moving.
CUT TO:
PATIENCE, in borrowed clothes, moves toward the entrance of
her building, limping and tired. She climbs the steps.
LONE
Patience.
TOM LONE, wearing SUNGLASSES, approaches tentatively.
PATIENCE
Oh!
Hi.
Listen-- about last night...
LONE
Forget it.
I, um... listen, I'm sorry about this.
(CONTINUED)
96.
CONTINUED:
He takes a few steps back as --
-- a PAIR OF PATROL CARS SCREECH to a halt, coming up on the
sidewalk in front of Patience's building. COPS armed with
SHOTGUNS leap out, train their weapons on her.
PATROL COP
Hands in the air!
TWO MORE COPS throw open the entrance door behind her,
HANDGUNS ready. PATIENCE, cornered, looks shocked and
betrayed. She raises her hands timidly.
LONE removes his shades -- we now see he has a nasty BLACK
EYE, his face swollen. Still, a hint of regret in his voice:
LONE
Patience Price, AKA Catwoman, you're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent...
ON Patience's stunned expression --
CUT TO:
Grim-looking ANIMAL CONTROL WORKERS methodically ferry CAT
CAGES from Edna's open front door to a VAN in front. EDNA
scurries helplessly from cage to cage, saying goodbye,
fighting back tears.
MIDNIGHT slashes at a WORKER and escapes. But a KITTEN, less
agile, is shoved into a CAGE. As the DOOR SLAMS SHUT --
CUT TO:
THE FULL MOON just above the rooftops. CATWOMAN rises INTO
FRAME in full regalia, silhouetted, then LEAPS away.
THE DARK MERCEDES, with only ONE HEADLIGHT, and a DENTED
FRONT END, weaves quickly around slower traffic.
LONE moves outside, past FILM TRUCKS outside this urban
church, still on the phone.
LONE
(on phone)
Nah, couldn't have been Price after all, musta been
a lab error. You better cut her loose right away
or she's gonna have a hell of a lawsuit on her
hands... yeah, be there soon, I just gotta tie up a
couple loose ends.
He climbs in his sedan and moves off.
LONE'S SEDAN pulls up near the entrance to the office tower.
As he gets out, he hears a CHOPPER coming in overhead and
looks up to see --
The AVENAL BEAUTY sign high above, a TWIN-ROTOR CHOPPER
approaching the helipad.
(CONTINUED)
104.
CONTINUED:
LONE moves toward the showroom entrance, tries the door --
locked. He sees the entrance to the PARKING GARAGE, moves
down the ramp.
THE MILITARY CARGO CHOPPER touches down. XAVIER and FOUR
MERCENARIES emerge. Two mercs carry ALUMINUM SUITCASES, all
are armed with AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. In addition to chopper
SOUNDS, there's a WHISTLING WIND up here and the WHITE NOISE
ROAR of A.C. DUCTS.
LAUREL, still in the cat suit but without the mask, is
waiting. XAVIER approaches, a small BRIEFCASE in hand.
Laurel's manner is cold, professional, all business -- she
couldn't be more different from the victimized female we met
up here at the outset.
XAVIER
Your husband?
LAUREL
He won't be a problem.
Ever again.
And I'm not
even a suspect.
She gestures to her outfit.
Xavier nods.
XAVIER
American women. I'm always impressed.
LAUREL
Let's do some business.
They head down the stairs. CAMERA MOVES, off the roof, to
the roof of an adjacent, lower SKYSCRAPER -- and finds --
THE REAL CATWOMAN. She paces, breathing hard, steeling
herself for something, looking toward the Avenal building.
A WINDOW WASHER RIG hangs halfway down the building, but it's
quite a distance from this roof edge.
CATWOMAN
I can do this... right?
(CONTINUED)
105.
CONTINUED:
She's addressing MIDNIGHT, who non-commitally licks a paw.
CATWOMAN moves to the far end of the roof and sprints toward
the edge, leaps for all she's worth --
CATWOMAN sails through the air in a perfect arc, toward the
window-washer rig... but she's going to fall short and plunge
twenty stories. At the last second, she pulls out her whip
and snaps it out around --
-- the cables of the rig.
CATWOMAN SLAMS HARD against the side of the building,
dangling from the whip.
CATWOMAN
Ow.
She struggles to pull herself upward.
AT THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING, CATWOMAN holds a button on the
WINDOW WASHER'S RIG, which rises toward the roof.
107.
THE MERCS methodically move canisters from the penthouse, up
the stairs, to the CHOPPER on the helipad, where a PILOT
waits at the controls -- the ROTOR BLADES spin lazily.
MERCENARY #1, winded, calls to the PILOT, who's absorbed in a
copy of SOLDIER OF FORTUNE:
MERCENARY #1
Wanna pitch in?
PILOT
(not looking up)
Not my job.
MERCENARY #1 exchanges a look with MERCENARY #2, shakes his
head, deposits his canister in the chopper. As he moves back
for the stairs he hears moving HYDRAULICS. He heads toward
the far edge of the helipad, WEAPON ready. He sees the
MOVING CABLES of the window washing rig come to a STOP, he
looks cautiously over the edge...
HIS POV -- the PLATFORM has come to a stop just a few feet
below the rooftop. But it's empty.
ANOTHER ANGLE -- CATWOMAN is clawing her way around the
corner of the building, just below a narrow CORNICE. She's
dangling precipitously over a forty story fall.
She approaches a WINDOW into the PENTHOUSE below the helipad.
CATWOMAN POV -- on LAUREL in the CATWOMAN suit, chatting with
XAVIER while the MERCS ferry YP-3.
ON CATWOMAN, her eyes widen with the realization -- Laurel?!
CATWOMAN
You cow...
MERCENARIES #3 and #4 are in the back of the chopper,
securing the canisters. #1 and #2 head toward the stairs,
for another load.
MERCENARY #1, in the rear, passes a low A.C. DUCT. THE
WHIP LASHES out from behind him, wraps around his throat
-- he can't cry out as it YANKS him back behind the duct.
We
hear a nasty THUNK. One down.
ON THE STAIRS, MERCENARY #2 turns around.
MERCENARY #2
Tony...?
No sign of his buddy.
He moves back up the stairs and --
-- GETS HIT IN THE FACE with Merc #1's GUN BUTT.
He rolls
down the stairs.
XAVIER and LAUREL have their backs to the stairs, SMOKING
their CIGARS, as the unconscious MERCENARY hits the ground a
short distance behind them. They don't notice. Laurel
stretches her arms luxuriously, enjoying the feel of the
wind. Xavier studies Laurel, a bit lasciviously.
LAUREL
Free at last... to eat what I want, wear what I
want, look like a slob if I want... You have no
idea how good it feels.
XAVIER
I was thinking after this business is over, you
might spend some time with me on my island --
LAUREL
Thanks, no.
I'm through with men.
109.
MERCENARIES #3 and #4 emerge from the chopper, looking around
for the others. As they start to circle the chopper --
-- CATWOMAN swings around from behind them, hanging from the
slowly spinning ROTOR BLADE, she KICKS THEM BOTH from behind
and sends them flying head-first to the asphalt.
Merc #3 is knocked cold, Merc #4 rolls over on the ground,
FIRING A BURST behind him. But when the blade comes around
again, she's gone. He has no idea what hit them.
LAUREL and XAVIER both react to the GUNFIRE, dropping their
cigars, hurrying for the stairs.
THE PILOT leaps out, a HANDGUN ready.
PILOT
What the hell are you shooting at?
MERCENARY #4
I don't know!
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHOPPER, CATWOMAN clings to the
FUSELAGE. Seeing a FUEL TANK --
CLOSE -- her CLAW pierces the ALUMINUM SKIN and FUEL starts
to spurt out.
WESLEY and ANGEL have emerged from the penthouse, alarmed,
just as LAUREL and XAVIER nearly trip over the groaning
MERCENARY #2.
XAVIER
What the hell --?
Xavier takes the man's AUTOMATIC WEAPON, he and Laurel hurry
up to the helipad.
LAUREL and XAVIER reach the top of the stairs, followed by
WESLEY and ANGEL, just as --
(CONTINUED)
110.
CONTINUED:
CATWOMAN leaps down to the penthouse level from the helipad.
The group is stunned to see the injured men. MERCENARY #1 is
crawling out from behind the A.C. DUCT. LAUREL angrily grabs
a MACHINE GUN from the dazed MERCENARY #3. To Xavier:
LAUREL
Where did you find these clowns?!
MERCENARY #4 and ANGEL scout the helipad's perimeter, guns at
the ready. WESLEY nervously backs toward the stairs.
WESLEY
If it's all right with you, Laurel, I'd just as
soon be going...
Xavier is looking around frantically.
XAVIER
These are good soldiers.
It would take a team of
men --
LAUREL
(realizing)
Or one woman.
CATWOMAN (O.S.)
Look what I found!
All spin to see --
CATWOMAN standing at the edge of the helipad, above the sheer
drop, holding THE TWO SUITCASES out to either side of her.
She has a lit CIGAR clenched between her teeth. Behind her,
the SKY is LIGHTENING with approaching dawn.
ALL GUNS are trained on Catwoman, except Laurel's.
LAUREL
Don't shoot, you idiots!
She'll drop the money--
They don't lower their guns.
Catwoman narrows her eyes,
speaks around the cigar.
CATWOMAN
Henchmen, Laurel? How tacky.
(CONTINUED)
111.
CONTINUED:
She jerks one of the cases -- the latch has been loosened, it
POPS OPEN and CASH GOES FLYING into the wind --
DRIFTING from the rooftop to the city streets below.
LAUREL reacts in agony.
LAUREL
No, please-- don't do that again!
CATWOMAN drops the emptied case and pulls the cigar from her
mouth with a distasteful expression. Eying Laurel:
CATWOMAN
Don't you hate it when somebody shows up at a party
wearing the same dress?
LAUREL advances on Catwoman.
LAUREL
Let's face it -- we're alike, you and me.
Catwoman ignores her, shouts to XAVIER and his men:
CATWOMAN
You guys gotta be careful with this YP-3 stuff.
It's a living thing, you know, a bacteria. If it
gets too hot -- it dies.
XAVIER looks from Catwoman to the FUEL pooling on the
helipad, putting two and two together. He jerks his head at
his mercs -- they start backing away toward the stairs.
LAUREL is still focused on the money.
LAUREL
Let's split the rest of the money -- and there's
more where that came from --
CATWOMAN
Tempting offer... We would make a pretty good team.
Beyond the law, fighting the yoke of male
oppression, sisters under the skin...
LAUREL nods hopefully.
CATWOMAN looks thoughtfully at the
cigar in her hand.
(CONTINUED)
112.
CONTINUED:
CATWOMAN
Nah, I still have to live with myself.
So saying, she flicks the LIT CIGAR to the helipad --
IGNITING the spreading pool of gasoline --
XAVIER ET AL. sprint to LEAP OFF THE HELIPAD or CHARGE DOWN
THE STAIRS as --
THE HELICOPTER EXPLODES in a glorious FIREBALL.
LAUREL is thrown across the helipad by the BLAST, showered
with CHOPPER DEBRIS. The men are hightailing it out of
there, but Laurel gets slowly to her feet, machine gun
ready, bent on revenge.
Spotting CATWOMAN darting through the SMOKE and FLAMES toward
the stairs, LAUREL FIRES a volley with a SCREAM of rage and
charges after her in pursuit.
LAUREL hurries down the stairs to the garden, FIRING at --
CATWOMAN, as she darts into the penthouse.
Catwoman's nearly
hit, showered with broken glass.
OBJECTIVE SHOT, ANGEL near Patience's body. CAMERA MOVES TO
the MERCEDES. The DRIVER'S DOOR opens and LAUREL steps out,
looking at Patience's body on the ground with disgust.
PATIENCE (V.O.)
You were behind the wheel that night...
POLICE charge into the building from a number of COP CARS.
As they do so, we see the ARMY OF CATS fleeing.
118.
OVERHEAD ANGLE as COPS hustle XAVIER and the OTHERS into
police vehicles. CAMERA KEEPS PULLING UP, until we see the
ruined ROOF of the building, IN FLAMES. The "A" in "AVENAL
BEAUTY" has been knocked out by the conflagration ... for a
few moments the sign reads "VENAL BEAUTY," until the whole
thing EXPLODES and SPARKS OUT.
DISSOLVE TO:
