          FADE IN:

    1INT - FATHER'S CHAMBER - DAY1

        We open VERY TIGHT on Father's face and begin to PULL BACK
          SLOWLY as he speaks.

                                        FATHER
                        You've broken our rules, not once
                        but time and time again. Your
                        repeated forays above put all of us
                        at risk. We cannot close our eyes
                        any longer.

        The ANGLE WIDENS to reveal other members of the subterranean
          society standing beside Father. MARY, the gentle matronly
          woman who works with the children, stands to his left, eyes
          downcast, looking distraught. WINSLOW, a huge three-hundred
          pound black man, is on his right, his face stern, arms
          crossed against his chest.

                                        FATHER
                                  (continuous)
                        You've been warned again and
                        again. Yet still you've persisted
                        in this wilful course of action

        The ANGLE CONTINUES TO WIDEN, and we establish other
            subterraneans standing beside Mary and Winslow, and others
          beside them, all looking at the unseen accused. Some faces
        are uneasy, some sad, some angry, some rapt. The adults line
        the walls of Father's chamber in a ragged circle; some of the
          underground children form a second, smaller, concentric
          circle inside the first. Others crowd the stairs and the
          upper level of the chamber.

                                        FATHER
                        Do you have anything to say in
                        your own defense?


    2REVERSE ANGLE2

        We ANGLE PAST FATHER to reveal the accused, WEED, standing in
          the center of the circle. He's a short, slight, pale young
          man with mobile, expressive features, dressed entirely in
          shades of grey, much of it soft, well-worn leathers. On his
          shoulder, at the end of a fine silver chain fastened to
          Weed's lapel, is ARTHUR, a ferret. As Weed speaks, one finger
          idly strokes the ferret, plays with him.


                                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                                        2.


    2CONTINUED:2

                                      WEED
                        Why's everyone getting so upset?


    3ANGLE ON VINCENT3

        in b.g. behind Weed, near the entrance to Father's
        chamber. He watches the proceedings with a concerned,
          melancholy look on his face.


    4BACK. TO THE SCENE4

                                      FATHER
                                (frustrated)
                        Weed, you've been stealing.

                                      WEED
                      Not stealing. Taking.
                                (shrugs)
                        Just stuff. Needed it, found it,
                        took it...

                                      WINSLOW
                        ...from a warehouse!

                                      WEED
                                (pleasantly)
                        That's where the stuff was.
                        Lots there, won't even miss it.
                        Left plenty too.

                                      FATHER
                        That's not the issue.

                                      WINSLOW
                        You set off a burglar alarm.

                                      WEED
                        Very noisy. New kind, tricked me,
                        won't happen again.

                                      WINSLOW
                                (hard)
                        We're here to make sure that it
                        doesn't.

                                      WEED
                                (pets ferret)
                        Been teaching Arthur to find the
                        wires, chew' em up. He's small,
                        sneaks in easy.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        3.


    4CONTINUED:4

        There's a general CHORUS OF DISMAY from the crowded
        chamber. Mary looks sad and worried, Father frustrated.

                                      WINSLOW
                              (to Father)
                      He hasn't heard a thing we've
                        said...

                                    WEED
                      Heard everything. Lot of silly
                      noise. Everyone takes stuff from up
                      top. That's what up top is there
                      for...

                                      FATHER
                      Weed, there's a difference between
                        foraging and stealing. We take those
                        things the world above has cast
                        off... we accept what is given to us
                        freely by our helpers above... but we
                      do not steal.

                                      WEED
                              (stubborn, annoyed)
                      Not stealing. Taking. Couldn't
                      wait. Needed elevator cable,
                        hydraulics, ratchets, gears,-all
                      kinds of stuff. Big project.

                                      WINSLOW
                      What big project? No one was told
                        anything about a big project...
                              (to Father)
                      This is a waste of time.

                                      WEED
                              (to Arthur)
                        Winslow's mad... no one got his
                        permission.

                                      FATHER
                              (gently)
                      Weed, we live down heretoo. .It
                      would have been nice toconsult
                      us, don't you think?

                                      WEED
                        Would have ruined the surprise.

        SARAH, an attractive young woman of twenty-five, with long
        dark hair, STEPS FORWARD and speaks up nervously.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)


I                                                                                        4.


  4CONTINUED:(2)4

                                      SARAH
                      It's all my fault, Father... Weed was
                      just trying to help.
                              (beat)
                      You know that old iron ladder down by
                      the ice stream? You've got
                      to climb down to get from the pipe
                      junction to the north tunnel...
                      sometimes, if you're carrying
                      something, it's hard ...I just asked
                      Weed if there wasn't some way he
                      could fix something, you know? To
                      make the climb easier... I thought
                      maybe a chute or something...


                                    WEED
                      Chutes! Chutes are boring. Had
                      a better idea... you'll see, a moving
                      ladder, run it off the water power,
                      all hyrdaulic... just hop on, grab
                      hold, ride it down, ride it up...
                      like an escalator, only with a
                      ladder...

                                      FATHER
                      That's all very clever, but it
                      still doesn't excuse stealing.

                                    WEED
                      Not stealing. Taking.
                              (scornful)
                      Nobody was going to give me
                      that stuff. Right, Arthur?

        There's a moment of awkward silence. They aren't getting
        through, and everyone in the circle knows it. The moment
        that everyone has dreaded is coming closer and closer.
        Father looks around the circle.

                                    FATHER
                      Does anyone have anything to add
                      before we vote?

                                    MARY
                      Can't we give him one more chance?
                      He won't do it again.
                              (looks at Weed)
                      You won't do it again, Weed?


                                      WINSLOW
                      Mary, we've heard his promises
                      before. He never learns.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        5.


    4CONTINUED:4
                        (3)

      We PAN around the circle of faces. Most of the onlookers
      shift nervously, shake their heads, look away. A few STEP
        FORWARD to speak their piece. The first one is Pascal, the
        maestro of the pipe chamber.

                                      PASCAL
                      We've given him one more chance a
                      dozen times... I have to side with
                      Winslow.

        He's followed by JAMIE, an eighteen-year-old girl with a
        slim, boyish figure and a cute tomboy's face.

                                      JAMIE
                      Weed has helped all of us& built
                      us things, fixed whatever got
                      broken... we can't to him.


        A very very old man, tiny and wizened, dressed in dusty,
        outdated formalwear from the thirties, follows Jamie. This
      is JUDGE, the oldest man in the world below. He leans
        heavily on his cane, his voice thin, wheezing.

                                      JUDGE .
                      Laws are laws... I know, I was
                      a judge up top once... stealing is
                      stealing, yes sir!
                              (stamps cane)
                      Wink at the laws... chaos, that's
                      what you'll have... I know, I was a
                      judge... chaos, that's a terrible
                      thing...

        He breaks off his speech in a fit of coughing, and is
        helped back to his place in the circle. One of the
          underground children, KIPPER, stands up.

                                      KIPPER
                      If you send Weed away, who's going to
                      fix the broken toys?

                                      FATHER
                              (gently)
                      No one wants to send Weed away,
                      Kipper.

                                      KIPPER
                      Winslow does...

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.


4CONTINUED:(4)4

                                WINSLOW
                  No, boy. Maybe you think I'm just a
                  hard-case, but all we're trying to do
                  here is teach him a
                  lesson... so we won't have to send
                  him away. Understand?

    Kipper finally NODS slowly, sits down again.

                                FATHER
                          (sighs)
                  I suppose it's time, then. Weed has
                  admitted the charge. Those who favor
                  imposing the punishment, please... so
                  indicate.


5CLOSE ON THE FACES5

  as we begin to PAN SLOWLY around the circle, starting with
    Winslow, his face resolute as he TURNS AWAY from the
    camera, showing Weed his back. One by one the other
    subterraneans hesitate, and then vote for or against
    punishment, by turning away or facing forward,
    respectively. Sarah, Jamie, Vincent, and Mary are among those
  who do not turn. Pascal, Kipper, and the Judge vote with
    Winslow, as do a majority of the others. Finally
  we swing all the way around, back to Father, whose pain is
  plain on his face. He hesitates for a long, agonized moment,
  then TURNS AWAY.


6 ANGLE ON WEED6

  In the center of the circle, stunned, turning first one way
  and then the other. Even those still facing forward can't
    bear to meet his eyes. Two-thirds of the subterraneans have
    their backs turned.

    The voting done, Father faces Weed once again, sadness in
    his eyes as he performs his painful duty.

                                      FATHER
                      Weed, I'm sorry... but since you
                      refuse to listen, perhaps our
                      silence will teach you the lesson
                      our words could not. For one month,
                      no man, woman, or child among us
                      will speak to you. The sentence will
                      begin...
                              (downcast eyes, soft)
                      . . . now.

        The spectators begin to talk quietly among themselves as
        they file out, and we HEAR snatches of their conversation
        -- "A whole month, that's rough, I didn't think he'd do it,
        you know Weed has been asking for it," etc. They
          conspicuously ignore Weed as they exit.


  8ANGLE ON WEED8

      as he rises slowly to his feet, stunned and confused.

                                    WEED
                      Joke, right? Okay good, okay
                      fine. Hah hah.
                              (as Sarah passes)
                      Sarah, hey...

        Sarah averts her eyes, breaks free, and pushes out of the
        chamber. Weed looks at the others as they pass.

                                    WEED
                      Alys... Michael... say
                        something... this is so dumb.
                      Jamie! What a laugh, huh? At
                      least you were on my side.

        But even Jamie tries to push past. Weed grabs her arm. She
        struggles to free herself, and suddenly Vincent appears and
        very gently pries them apart. Weed turns all his attention
        and hope to Vincent.

                                    WEED
                        Vincent... Vincent breaks their
                      stupid rules too... How's your Lady
                        Catherine, Vincent?
                              (stares hopefully)
                      She's good, right? Pretty, like you
                      said... tell me how pretty she is,

This is sheer agony for Vincent. He hesitates, sensing
Weed's fear and confusion, horribly torn, but finally
shakes his head, and looks away in silence.

looks as though he's been slapped.

                              WEED
              Vincent too.

Hurt and furious, Weed whirls on his heels and EXITS;

11INT - DA'S OFFICE - DAY11

  Catherine opens the door to Maxwell's office. Maxwell is
behind his desk, feet up, lobbing darts at the picture of
George Steinbrenner tacked up on his dartboard. When
  Catherine enters, he sits up, a serious look on his face.

                              CATHERINE
              You wanted to see me?

                              JOE
                      (awkward, glum)
              Yeah. Come in and close the door.
                      (she does)

                              CATHERINE
              What is it?

                              JOE
              The Avery case. Kickbacks and
                corruption in the construction
                racket. . .

He rises, restless, and begins to pace -- glum, unhappy
with what he's about to ask her.

                              JOE
                Avery's as dirty as they come.
                I know it, you know it, the guy that
              sells the hotdogs across the street
              knows it, but nobody can prove it.
              We've talked to Waldrop, Gunther,
                Mertens, a dozen others that we know
              damn well have paid off to keep their
                buildings going. Want to know what we
              got?

  He sits on the edge of his desk, makes a "zip" sign with
  his thumb and forefinger.

                              JOE
                        (glum, awkward)
                Moreno thinks you... well, there's
                one major developer who hasn't said
                no...

  Catherine is one step ahead of Joe, suddenly suspicious, on
  edge. She shakes her head.

                                CATHERINE
                No. Don't ask it, Joe.
                Don t even think it.

                                JOE
                Gimme a break, Radcliffe. You think
                I want to do this? I just work
                here.
                        (beat)
                Just have a little talk with Elliot
                  Burch...

                                CATHERINE
                My relationship with Elliot was
                  private... not to mention painful.
                And it's past tense.

                                JOE
                  Take it easy. We're asking you to
                  interview the guy, not have his
                  children. If Burch talks, we can
                put Avery away.

                                CATHERINE
                  Then subpoena him.

                                JOE
                  He's got an army of lawyers, he
                can stonewall and tie us up for
                  years...but he'll talk to you.

                                CATHERINE
                  How do you know that?

                                JOE
                          (sigh)
                  He told us so.
                          (beat)
                  Personally, I think it stinks,
                  but there it is.

12INT - WEED'S CHAMBER - DAY12

        We PAN slowly across the wonders of the chamber that Weed has
        made his home, a place that is equal parts laboratory,
        machine shop, junkyard, playpen, and Victorian bordello. Weed
        seems to have found every surviving lava lamp in Manhattan;
        dozens of them fill niches in the rocky walls, burbling and
        churning in a myriad of colors.
        Here and there, man-made stalagmites rise from the floor,
          painstakingly pieced together from multi-colored chunks
        of broken glass, like the Watts Towers; some are taller
        than Weed himself. Rube Goldbergish devices occupy the
        dusty corners o  the room, some blinking and whirring, others
        dark and covered with cobwebs. A massive four-poster bed sits
        in the center of the chamber, piled high with plush velvet
        cushions; above it, we glimpse a large square HOLE in the
        rock wall, filled with darkness.
        The bric-a-brac is distinctly less classical than Vincent's;
        toy robots, Disney figurines, an expresso machine, broken
        plastic models of airplanes, trains, and custom cars,
        anything bright and shiny.
        Weed is the ultimate packrat. As we pan across his treasures,
        we HEAR Weed talking to himself, complaining. .


                                      WEED (O.S.)
                      Nice and quiet. It's good, the
                        quiet. Isn't it good, Arthur?
                              (Arthur SQUEAKS)
                      They won't talk, okay good, okay
                        fine, they can't bother me all
                      the time.
                              (mocking singsong)
                      Weed fix this, Weed can you help
                      me, Weed don't go there, Weed
                        that's dangerous. Yap yap yap...

        The camera FINDS Weed sitting at a long work table up against
          a wall. A large pachinko machine is open in front of him, and
        he's tinkering with it, his fingers moving deftly as he
        talks. In b.g., a large cement-and-glass SANDCASTLE sits
          against the wall, and Weed's pet ferret is visible high on
        one of its parapets, peering down. Weed closes up the back of
        the machine, stands it up.
        We MOVE IN CLOSE as he sets a ball in motion, and it rolls
        and tings down the complex pathway. For a moment, Weed grins
        with delight.

                                                                  CUT TO:


  13INSERT - KALEIDOSCOPE13

        Colors and shapes twist, shatter, and reform as a
          kaleidoscope is slowly turned.                                                                                11.


14INT.- FATHER'S CHAMBER - DAY14

  Vincent enters, and finds Father behind his desk, peering
into a large, ornate brass kaleidoscope. He seems unaware of
  Vincent's presence at first.

                              VINCENT
                        (softly)
                Father...

Father lowers the kaleidoscope.

                              VINCENT
              Am I disturbing you?

Father sighs sadly, sets the kaleidoscope aside.

                              FATHER
                No.I was just...just...

  Vincent lightly touches the kaleidoscope.

                              VINCENT
                I remember when Weed made this for
                you... his tube of colors... all
                the colors we lacked... the colors
                of the world above...

                              FATHER
                I was afraid he'd stolen it. He
                promised me solemnly that he'd made
                it himself. He was only ten. I was
                very touched.
                        (rueful smile)
                ...then I found out that he'd stolen
                the parts.
                        (beat)
                You were silent in the circle
                today...

                              VINCENT
                I had nothing to say.
                        (beat)
                The problem is a grave one, I
                agree, but how can I of all
                people presume to judge Weed?

                                FATHER
                You disagree with what we did?

                              VINCENT
                It troubles me. The silence can be
                terrible.

                                                            (CONTINUED)                                                                                      12.


  14CONTINUED:14

                                    FATHER
                      Not half so terrible as what he'd
                      suffer if he were ever caught up top.
                      I've seen the inside of their
                      prisons.
                              (wearily)
                      We did the right thing... but that
                      does not make it any easier to live
                      with.

                                    VINCENT
                      In Catherine's world, men who
                      stand accused of wrongdoing are
                      judged by strangers.

        Mention of Catherine and her world hardens Father's
        attitude. He shakes his head vehemently.

                                      FATHER
                              (scornful)
                      Yes... they are afraid to take
                        responsibility, so they close
                      their eyes and wash their hands
                      and let others take it for them
                      -- policemen, jailers,
                        executioners... at least we make
                      our own inconvenient moral
                        choices, difficult as it might
                      be at times.

        Before Vincent can reply, we HEAR the sound of running
        footsteps and a young girl, ELLIE, bursts into the
        chamber.

                                      ELLIE
                                (alarmed)

                              (very concerned)
                      Where?

                                      FATHER
                      The maze! How many times have you
                      been told to stay out of the maze?
                      It's not safe.

        Father rises, goes to get his medical bag.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      13.

        Vincent kneels before her, consoles her.

                      Eric will be fine... but there's no
                      time for tears now. Can you take us

                        Quickly, now. There's no time to
                      lose.

        The three of them set off together as we:

                                                                  CUT TO:


15INT - ELLIOT BURCH'S OFFICE - DAY15

        Elliott is seated behind his desk. The desk is bare,
        polished, gleaming -- except for a single bulging file folder
        arranged, with compulsive precision, in its center. He looks
        up and SMILES as the door opens and Catherine enters.
        Catherine does not return the smile. Her demeanor is all icy,
        controlled professionalism, but there's fury below that
        surface.

                                      ELLIOT
                              (warmly)
                        Catherine... it's so good
                      to see you again.

        He rises and begins to come around the desk to greet her,
        but Catherine deliberately seats herself in the chair
        furthest from him. The rejection is unmistakable.

                                      CATHERINE
                      Mister Burch, let's skip the
                        amenities, shall we? I'm here to
                      talk about Max Avery.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        14.

                                      ELLIOT
                        You're angry. I understand that,
                        Catherine. You may not believe it,
                        but this is as difficult for me as
                        it is for you.

                                        CATHERINE
                                (sharply)
                        Then maybe you should talk to
                        someone less... difficult.
                        That can be arranged.

                                      ELLIOT
                                  (vulnerable)
                        What did I ever do to make you
                        hate me so much?

                                        CATHERINE
                        We both know the answer to that.
                                (opens a notebook)
                        Can we get on with it?

          Elliot stares at her for a long beat, then retreats back
          behind his desk and seats himself again. He slides the file
          a few inches across his desk, toward Catherine.

                                        ELLIOT
                        It's all here. Every threat, every
                        bribe, every kickback. Dates, times,
                        amounts. The names of the go-
                          betweens. Enough to put Max Avery
                        away for twenty years.


          Catherine reaches for the file, but Burch grabs her hand.

                                        ELLIOT
                        Not yet. I have something I want
                        to say first...

          The tableau holds for a long, charged moment as Catherine
          and Elliot stare at each other.

          He releases her hand, sits back in his chair.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)                                                                                      15.

                      I've dealt with a dozen Max Averys
                      since I began. Not because I wanted
                      to. Maybe in your life the choices
                      have all been black and white, but
                      mine have been... gray.
                              (beat)
                        I wanted to build... to leave my
                      mark. It was easier and cheaper to
                      play ball with Avery than to fight
                      him.


        He swivels away from her in his chair, gazes out over the
        towers of Manhattan outside his window.

                                      ELLIOT
                      Maybe you were right to walk away
                      from me. Maybe you've never done
                        anything you had cause to regret.
                        I have. All I can say in my
                      own defense is that I've made this
                      city a better place to live...

        He swivels to face her once again, touches the file.

                                      ELLIOT
                      This file can damage me almost
                      as much as Max Avery. My attorney
                        advised me to shred it.
                              (beat)
                        I have a new attorney.


  18ANGLE PAST ELLIOT ON CATHERINE18

        as he slides the file across the desk to her. She looks
          uncertain, off-balance. Whatever she expected from him,
        this kind of honest vulnerability wasn't it.

                                      ELLIOT
                      Take it.

                                      CATHERINE
                              (she does)
                      Will you testify?

                                      ELLIOT
                      It will cost me millions of
                        dollars. Avery is in a position to
                        cripple at least four of my current
                        projects.
                              (nod)
                        Yes, I'll testify.

                      I can ask Moreno about immunity,
                      but I can't promise anything.

                                      ELLIOT
                      I realize that. I trust you. Do
                      your best.

        Catherine stands up, deeply troubled. She thought she had
        Elliot Burch pegged, but now she's not so sure.

                                      CATHERINE
                      Why, Elliot?

                                      ELLIOTT
                              (very calmly)
                      Because I'm not one of the bad
                      guys, Catherine, no matter
                      what you think.

19INT. - OUTER MAZE - DAY19

        Ellie leads Vincent and Father down a dark, twisting
        passage. The walls are rough unshaped stone, very cavelike;
        there's nothing man-made about this tunnel. The passage
        grows very narrow in one place, and the adults must
        carefully squeeze through. Further on, the way dead-ends at
        a small, low hole in the stone. Ellie ducks and scampers
        through, vanishing in the darkness. Father and Vincent
        pause, exchange looks. After a moment, Ellie's head re-
        emerges from the hole.

                                      ELLIE
                      It's this way...
                              (with childish
                                  impatience)
                        ...it's only a little crawl&

                      Only a little crawl...

        But then, very faintly, we HEAR a child's cries echoing
        through the stillness. Father turns to Vincent.

                                      FATHER
                      Will you take my bag?

                                      FATHER
                      Yes.

        Vincent accepts the doctor's bag. Awkwardly, Father gets on
        his knees and follows Ellie into the hole. Vincent, the bag
        tucked under his arm, follows.

                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:


20INT - INNER MAZE - LATER20

        ERIC, a small boy of about eight, is lying beneath a
        looming, uneven wall of rock, crying, holding his ankle.
        Pieces of broken rock litter the ground around him. Kipper
        is with him. The chamber is cavernous, gloomy; various cave
          formations (stalagmites, stalactites, columns, icicles,
        etc.) are visible around them. The walls are damp, covered
        with patches of nitre and pale white lichen, and we HEAR
        the dim sound of rushing water through the rock. In b.g., a
        huge COLUMN OF ROCK stands besides a dark passageway..

        Ellie scurries out of the dark side-tunnel, with Father and
        Vincent close behind her. Grim-faced and worried, Father
        kneels and begins to examine Eric.


                                      FATHER
                      It's all right, Eric. Here,
                      let me me have a look...
                              (to Kipper)
                      What happened here?

                      The rock broke...

        Eric winces as Father removes his shoe, gently manipulates
        his ankle.

                        These stones are not as strong
                      as they look, Eric... see how damp
                      the walls are? The same water that
                        carved the maze eats away
                      at these rocks...

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        18.

                        You're lucky. It's a very bad sprain,
                        but I don't think anything is broken.


        He takes out some bandages, begins taping up the ankle.

                                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

          Father is closing his bag.

                        I want this place sealed up.  The
                        hazards are just too --

        He's interrupted as a large rock CRASHES DOWN a few feet
        from them. Eric SHRIEKS and Vincent and Father exchange
        looks of fear and concern. Vincent looks up.

                        The roof... hurry, this whole
                        chamber is unstable...

        The children stand frozen with fear. Several more
          rocks come crashing down.

                            FATHER
                        Now! Go On! Hurry!

          Ellie and Kipper, supporting Eric between them, start
          forward, but suddenly the huge stone column beside the
        exit BEGINS TO COLLAPSE. Vincent steps beneath the falling
          column, catches it. It's immense and heavy; he struggles
        to hold it.

  Vincent ROARS at them, galvanizing the children into
  motion. They hurry out. The chamber SHAKES as more
  pieces of the ceiling rain down around Vincent and Father.
  Father looks around in alarm. Vincent groans and sinks to his
knees beneath the massive pillar.

  Father hesitates, torn by indecision. He's doesn't want to
  abandon Vincent, doesn't see how to help him. Before
he can act, the choice is taken from him, as the entire
  chamber COLLAPSES ALL AROUND THEM. A rain of rock, small and
  large, comes down around them, and we SEE Father stumble as
  a chunk hits him. Then both of them are lost to our sight as

      darkness. As it settles, we see that only a small section of
      the chamber remains intact. In the dimness, there is no
      sound, no motion. We MOVE IN slowly on the massive rock
      pillar. The exit behind the fallen pillar is choked by
      rubble, obviously impassable.

      In the dimness, there is no sound, no motion. We continue to
      MOVE IN on the rubble, and FIND Vincent's hand, curled around
      the huge stone. It is still, unmoving. We HOLD on the hand
      for a long beat, and finally, it moves. Just a twitch at
      first; then a more pronounced movement as it flexes,
      unflexes.

      Small stones and chunks of rubble are forced out of the
      way as a second hand emerges from under the pillar. The
      two hands brace against the stone, push. Nothing. They flex,
      move to a better grip, push again. Still nothing. Then, from
      beneath the fallen rock, we HEAR a ROAR of pain and
        frustration, terrifyingly loud in this small place. The hands
      brace, push again. This time the pillar shifts visibly,
      begins to lift... we glimpse Vincent straining under its
      weight, as he finally shifts it up and out of the way. Out
      from under at last, he drops the pillar with a shudder of
      relief.


24ANGLE ON VINCENT24

      as he stands in the darkness, gasping for breath. His
      clothing hangs torn and filthy. He breathes even this
      stale, dusty air gratefully, in great draughts. He looks
      right, left, groping for the walls, lost in the darkness.

                                    VINCENT
                      Father...

                                    FATHER (O.S.)
                              (very weakly)
                      Vincent...
                              (coughs)


25EXTREME CLOSE ON VINCENT'S EYE25

      Catlike, his pupil dilates wider and wider, drinking in what
      small light remains. The eye moves slowly around the
      room, searching.                                                                                      21.


26 RESUME26

      Vincent finds Father, half-buried beneath a wall of fallen
      rock, moves to him, kneels by his side. Father's eyes
      are open, but blind in this blackness. A thin line of
      blood runs down the side of his face from where he was
      hit by the falling rock.

                                    VINCENT
                      I'm here, Father.
                              (begins to dig)

      Father's head moves slowly from side to side. He reaches
      out weakly, finds Vincent's arm, grasps it.

                                    FATHER
                      The children...

                                    VINCENT
                      They were well up the tunnel...

                                    FATHER
                              (relieved)
                      Good.. .
                              (beat)
                      Vincent, can you... see anything?

                                    VINCENT
                      Dimly. Shapes and shadows...
                      pools of black, and grays of a
                      dozen different shades...

      By now, he's cleared away from the fallen rock. Gently, he
      pulls Father out from beneath the rest, and cradles him in
      his arms. Father smiles weakly, reaches up, and touches
        Vincent's face.

                                    FATHER
                              (amazed)
                      Your eyes... astonishing... in
                      this darkness, I'm good as
                      blind...

                                    VINCENT
                      How do you feel?

                                    FATHER
                              (wry, pained smile)
                      I've been better...

                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                      22.


27INT. - JOE MAXWELL'S OFFICE - DAY27

      Joe is behind his desk, looking through the file that
      Catherine received from Elliot Burch. He's nodding as he
      reads. Catherine is pacing his office. She looks drawn,
      shaken, pale, and she paces back and forth with growing
        restlessness. Somehow, some part of her senses Vincent's
      distress, and it has begun to get to her, although even
      Catherine does not yet realize why she is feeling so bad.


                                    JOE
                    If Burch will corrobate this, I'd
                    say that Max Avery is out of the
                      construction business.

                                      CATHERINE
                    It will cost him, Joe... I don't
                      think immunity would be out of
                      line.

                                    JOE
                              (raised eyebrow)
                    Am I wrong, or are you whistling a
                      different tune than when you left?


                                      CATHERINE
                              (thoughtful)
                      Elliott is doing the right thing,
                      Joe... that's got to count for
                      something.

                                    JOE
                      I'll talk to Moreno. Immunity for
                      Burch and his people is a small
                      price to pay for Avery.

        Catherine strides to the door, pauses, looks back.

                                      CATHERINE
                      Tell Moreno he owes me one.
                              (beat)
                      And tell him that if he ever tries
                    to trade on my private life again,
                    my resignation will be on his desk
                    by morning.

      Joe stares at her for a beat, then smiles slowly, and
      gives her the "thumbs up" gesture.

                                                                  CUT TO:

28INT. - OUTER MAZE - TIGHT ON JAMIE28

      as she crawls BACKWARDS out of the hole that we saw Lana
      lead Father and Vincent into last act, her legs appearing
      first. Her clothes are dusty and torn. She's wearing
      a homemade "miner's helmet" -- a motorcycle helmet with an
      oversized flashlight taped to its top. The ANGLE WIDENS to
      reveal a dozen other subterraneans gathered around the hole,
      including Mary, Winslow, Sarah, Pascal, and others we saw
      during Weed's trial. Various of the group are carrying
      lanterns, picks, shovels, etc. We PAN SLOWLY across their
      troubled faces. Everyone looks worried, scared; a few
      struggle to hold back tears.

      Winslow, the massive, powerful black man, helps pull Jamie
      out of the hole. She takes off the helmet, wipes the grime
      and sweat from her face.

                                    JAMIE
                      It's closed up solid, just like
                      Kipper said. Half the maze must
                      have come down on them.

      In b.g., one of the women begins to sob uncontrollably.
        Winslow gives her a hard look.

                                    WINSLOW
                      That won't fix nothing.
                            (to Jamie)
                      Can we clear the tunnel?

                                    JAMIE
                      I don't see how. It's twenty feet
                      down to where it's collapsed, and
                      there's barely enough room for me. No
                      room to turn around, swing a pick...


                                    MARY
                              (near panic)
                      We could... we could pass the
                      stones out... hand to hand...

                                    WINSLOW
                      One rock at a time? They'll be dead
                      for sure before we reach'em that
                      way.
                              (grim)
                      If they're not dead already...

                                    MARY
                      Don't say that! They're not dead,
                      they can't be dead!

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      24.


  28CONTINUED:28

                                    WINSLOW
                      There's got to be some other way
                      in... all these little twisty
                      tunnels... they all feed into each
                      other, a man could get lost...
                      where's Kipper with those maps?

                                      SARAH
                      Here he comes now...

      We HEAR the sound of RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. The adults part as
        Kipper comes running down the tunnel, carrying a dozen
        scrolls -- Father's maps of the tunnel system.

                                    WINSLOW
                      About time... let me have a
                      look...

        Winslow takes the maps from Kipper, unrolls one. Jamie and
        the others press around him closely. It's not the
        right map. He casts it aside, tries another. His finger
        traces a route along the parchment.

                                      KIPPER
                              (soft, scared)
                      There isn't any other way...

        Stubborn, and more than a little scared, Winslow refuses
        to accept what Kipper is telling him. .

                                      WINSLOW
                      Quiet! There's another way, and
                      I'm going to find it.

        He shakes his head, unrolls a third map, studies it
        briefly, then shakes his head angrily.

                                      WINSLOW
                      This isn't right either...
                      these aren't the right maps.

                                      KIPPER
                              (defensive)
                      Yes they are.

                                      WINSLOW
                              (shouts)
                        They're not! You hear me, these
                      aren't right!

        Furious, Winslow FLINGS the map aside. Kipper flinches
        away from him, and Mary shelters the boy.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        25.

                      Stop it!You're scaring him...

        Winslow stops... suddenly he realizes what he's doing. The
        others are staring at him. This huge, strong man is as just
        as frightened and confused as any of them.

                                      WINSLOW
                        I... my god, he's just a boy...
                      I'm sorry... Kipper, please...

          Inarticulate and ashamed, Winslow TURNS AWAY toward the
        wall, and balls his hands into massive fists.

                                      WINSLOW
                              (dull with anger)
                        Solid bedrock.

        He beats against the wall with his fist, a tremendous blow
        that POUNDS against the rock and makes Winslow WINCE with
        pain. Then, with his other fist, he hits the wall again,
        taking out all his frustration and helpless rage on the
          unyielding stone. As he pounds, he begins to shout, louder
        and more hysterical with each blow.

                                      WINSLOW
                        Twenty feet of solid bedrock.
                              (hits it)
                      What the hell... (hits)... are...

                        going... (hits)... to...
                        (hits)... do !

        The last word is almost a SCREAM of pain, and Winslow
        begins to smash wildly against the rock, over and over and
        over again, as the other subterraneans surround him and try
          unsuccessfully to pull him away, but his hysterical
        strength is overwhelming. Each blow is LOUDER than the one
          before, until they are thunderous, deafening.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


  29INT. - DA'S OFFICE - EXTREME CLOSE ON CATHERINE29

        At her desk. She winces, touches her temples. We HEAR the
          rhythmic POUNDING in her head, OVERLAPPING with the sound
        of Winslow's pounding deep below the earth. Her
          breathing is ragged, her face pale. She knows this is not
        just an ordinary headache. Something is very, very wrong.
        She leans forward, as if she were ill, closing her eyes,
          cradling her head in her hands. Then she raises up her
        head, and her eyes open wide.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      26.

30INT. - INNER MAZE - EXTREME CLOSE ON VINCENT30

      After the loud, furious POUNDING of the last two scenes, the
        profound silence down in this darkness is almost a shock.
        Vincent is moving stones from the rubble around the
        entranceway. We can see that it's a hopeless task, but he
      works methodically, untiring, with heroic strength. Father is
      a few feet away, sitting against the wall of the cave,
        staring into the darkness. Vincent suddenly stops in his
        labors, pauses, listening.

                      Through the stone... someone is
                      hammering against the rock..:

                      I can't hear a thing...

                                    VINCENT
                      It's coming from the far side of
                      the crawlspace... the children must
                      have made it out safely...

                                      FATHER
                      Yes... good...

                      They'll dig down to us then.
                      It's such a long way& How long
                      do you think...

                                    VINCENT
                      As long as it takes.

                                      FATHER
                      Vincent... there's so much I want to
                      tell you... and so little time.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                    27.

      There's something in his voice -- a heartache, a fear,
      a yearning -- that makes Vincent stop his labors and come to
      Father's side.

                                    VINCENT
                    We have all the time in the world,
                    Father.

                                    FATHER
                    It hurts... I'm not as strong as I
                    was once, Vincent...

                                    VINCENT
                    They'll be here soon. Rest.

                                    FATHER
                    No... plenty of time for rest
                      later...
                            (with black humor)
                    ... whatever happens.
                            (beat)
                    The quiet, the darkness... so
                      chilling...
                            (beat)
                    I feel so useless... blind... I
                    wish I could see your face...

      Father reaches out blindly, touches Vincent's face with
      his hand, traces its shapes as a blind man might. It's
      enough. Father SMILES.

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

      Catherine stuffs papers into her briefcase, looking harried,
      shaken. Edie approaches as Catherine is rushing off. She
      follows Catherine across the office.

                                    EDIE

                                    EDIE
                    We were supposed to do dinner,
                      remember? The Oyster Bar in Grand

                      I'm sorry, Edie. I've got to get
                      home. Tomorrow, okay?

      Edie stands looking at the door after it swings shut.

                                    EDIE
                      Hey, maybe I'm not free tomorrow.
                      Maybe I've got a hot date with
                      Darryl Strawberry!
                              (turns back, softer,

32INT. - OUTER MAZE - DAY32

      The scene is one of frantic activity, as the subterraneans
      begin to try to widen the passage and break through to Father
      and Vincent. The larger, stronger men are swinging the picks,
      while others gather up the chipped stone and carry it off.
        They've only begun to make headway, but already some of the
        workers look exhausted. This is hard labor, and these people
      are no miners. Winslow, his clothing damp with his sweat,
        cracks off a huge chunk of rocks with one formidable swing.
      It falls, shatters.
      He staggers back to where Mary has set up a tub of cold
        water, takes a drink, then sluices some over his head. Jamie
        stands near the water station, watching. She shakes her head.


                                      JAMIE
                      This won't work, Winslow. There's
                      got be a better way.

                                    WINSLOW
                      I don't hear you coming up with no
                        brainstorms.

                                      JAMIE
                              (hesitates)
                      We could...

                                      WINSLOW
                      What?Let's hear it, girl.

                                      JAMIE
                      We could tell Weed.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      29.

                                    WINSLOW
                      Break the silence, you mean?
                              (scowls)
                      Jamie, if I thought it'd do any good,
                      I'd sing him a hymn and kiss his
                      damned weasel...

                                      JAMIE
                      Arthur's a ferret, not ...

                                    WINSLOW
                      I don't want no biology lessons --
                      we're talking life and death here.
                      Weed will just get in the way, slow
                      us down with all his talk, get
                      everybody arguing again.
                      No. Leave him where he is...

                                      JAMIE
                      Winslow, he knows the tunnels
                      better than anyone... even
                      Father... maybe he knows another
                      way in.

                                    WINSLOW
                      There is no other way in. How
                      many times did I go over those
                      damned maps?

                                      JAMIE
                      Maybe Weed could build
                        something... some kind of
                      machine...

                                    WINSLOW
                      I've seen his damned machines.
                      Half of them don't work...

                                              JAMIE
                      Yeah, so half of them do.

        Winslow SIGHS HEAVILY. He likes Jamie, but his nerves are
        frayed, he's exhausted, and out of patience.

                                      WINSLOW
                      I don't have time for this. You want
                      to save Vincent and Father?
                              (points at wall)
                      Well, they're in there. If they're
                      alive we need to dig them out fast,
                      and hot air don't move no rocks.
                      Neither does Weed.
                                (disgusted)
                      The man talks to weasels...

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      30.


    32(2)CONTINUED:32

        Winslow turns away sharply and heads back to the wall. Jamie
        watches, wordless and frustrated, as he lifts his pick and
        brings it down, shattering more rock. She hesitates for a
        moment, weighing her own instincts against Winslow's
        authority. Then she takes a step backwards, whirls, and RUNS
      OFF down the tunnel.

                                                                  CUT TO:


33INT. - CATHERINE'S BASEMENT33

      as she descends the ladder. She's carrying a heavy-duty
        flashlight and wearing jeans, boots, a heavy workshirt. She
      moves to the steam pipes, BANGS on them with the end
      of the flashlight, waits a moment, BANGS again. She's
        impatient, filled with a sense of urgency, anxious and
        worried. She lifts the flashlight to signal a third time,
      then decides that there's no time for it. Instead, in haste,
      she heads for the entrance to the tunnels.


34SERIES OF SHOTS. STEAM TUNNELS34

        Catherine, alone, descends deeper and deeper into the
        underworld. INTERCUT between STOCK from our tunnel library
      and shots of Catherine's boots -- descending the rungs of a
        ladder, striding through puddles, hesitating, turning, her
        footsteps ECHOING. We should give the impression of a
        lengthy, exhausting journey through the darkness, and several
        moments of confusion and hesitation.


3535INT. - OLD TUNNEL - NIGHT

        She gropes along an unfamiliar passage, its walls covered
      with nitre. Water is dripping here. This is a very old,
        spooky section of the tunnels, and it's clear that Catherine
        has never passed this way before. Somehow she's gotten lost,
        and her face shows her alarm.

        She comes on an old brick WELL in the center of the passage,
        moves past it, and brushes against a loose brick on its rim
      as she squeezes by. The brick falls for a long beat, and
        finally we HEAR a faint, distant SPLASH.

      An old WROUGHT IRON GATE blocks her passage. Catherine pushes
      at the gate, but she can't move it. She grasps the bars,
        SHOUTS.

                                              CATHERINE
                          Hello... Vincent... is anyone
                      there? Kipper? Ellie?

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                    31.


35CONTINUED:35

      Her voice ECHOES and RE-ECHOES in the dark, but there is no
      reply. She tries the grate again -- it is solidly shut by
      some kind of heavy bolt. Catherine looks around her
      for a key, a release, anything -- and NOTICES, set in the
      stone above the gate, a bit of carving, a round, stone
      GARGOYLE's FACE leering down at her. The carved face,
      however, CANTS slightly to one side, suggesting that it might
      turn.

      Cathy sets aside her flashlight, reaches up, and tries to
      turn the circular carving. It resists. She grimaces, twists
      harder... finally, with a GRINDING NOISE, the gargoyle
      begins to revolve. Cathy only has time for a brief smile of
      triumph...

      Then -- instead of the bolt pulling back, as she'd expected
      -- a CONCEALED TRAPDOOR OPENS right beneath her feet.
      Catherine SCREAMS and plunges down into the dark.

44INT. WEED'S CHAMBER - ANGLE ON WEED'S BED - DAY44

        Catherine pops out of the square hole in the rock wall
      above the bed to land on the plush velvet cushions, a
        startled cry breaking from her lips.


45 WEED45

      is at his work bench; now he turns to SEE CATHERINE on
      his bed behind him. A smile plays across his lips as he
        strokes the pet ferret on his shoulder, both of them
        watching Catherine.

                                    WEED
                              (to Arthur)
                      She's pretty, like Vincent said.
                      I'm Weed.
                              (a courtly bow)
                      At your service, Catherine.

                                      CATHERINE
                      You know me?

                      All in the world below... know.

      ANGLE ADJUSTS as Weed crosses to offer Catherine a hand up.
      She recoils slightly at the sight of the ferret; Weed
        smiles and chucks it under the chin.

                                      CATHERINE

                      I can't explain it, but I think
                      Vincent may be in trouble. I feel it.
                      I... fear for his safety.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        33.

                                      CATHERINE
                        Please, Mister...

                                      WEED
                              (a laugh)
                        Mister Weed? Just Weed. I just grew
                      here. So that's what they call me.


                                      CATHERINE
                                (frustrated)
                        Fine. Weed. We're wasting time. Just
                      tell me where I can find him.

                                      WEED
                        Never find him. Not alone. Hundreds
                      of tunnels, chambers... you could
                        wander forever and never find .


                                      CATHERINE
                        Then help me! Be my guide!

                                      WEED
                      Come to save him, Catherine? You're
                      the danger to him. And to us. You
                        shouldn't have come.

                                      CATHERINE
                        I can't shake this feeling of
                        dread. I won't rest until I see
                      him, know that he's safe...
                              (an edge)
                      I'll find him. With or without
                      your help.

                                      WEED
                              (to the ferret)
                      She wants us to take her up,
                        Arthur.
                              (a long beat; staring
                                at her)
                      Okay good, okay fine.

        The strange little man scurries quickly OUT of the
        chamber; Catherine has to hurry to catch up.

                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                      34.

46INT. TUNNELS - WITH CATHERINE AND WEED - DAY46

      Weed leads the way up, the beam from his flashlight
        slashing the darkness. He and Catherine move like
        apparitions through the thick blue mist. Weed is
        muttering to himself under his breath as they go. Now he
        stops, listens... JAMIE comes INTO SHOT, making her way
      down the tunnel toward them.

                                    WEED
                              (to Arthur, perched on
                              his shoulder)
                      Something's wrong, something's
                      broken, needs fixing... so they
                      come to Weed. Even in The Silence.


        Jamie reaches them, out of breath; Catherine's presence
        makes her nervous and wary. She looks on the verge of
        bolting when Catherine reassures her:

                                      CATHERINE
                      My name is Catherine. I m a
                        friend of Vincent's.


                                    WEED
                              (a snicker to Arthur)
                      A friend. That's rich.
                              (to Jamie)
                      Feast your eyes. You've been
                      gossiping about her long enough.

                                      JAMIE
                              (urgently)
                      Weed, you've got to come -

                                    WEED
                                (sarcastically)
                      -- I thought you broke The Silence
                      because you missed me.

                                      JAMIE
                      Listen to me! There's been a cave in
                      -- Father and Vincent are trapped!


        This news knocks the sarcasm out of Weed... and scares
        hell out of Catherine.

                                      CATHERINE

                      My God...

                                    WEED
                        Where?!

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      35.

                      The Maze...

                                    WEED
                              (hurrying away)
                      This is bad... very bad... worse
                      than bad... worse than worse...

        Catherine and Jamie hurry up the incline after him. HOLD a
        long beat as they disappear into the dark mist, then

                                                                  CUT TO:


47INT. THE OUTER MAZE - DAY47

        Winslow and a number of tunnel dwellers (ten or twelve) are
        still laboring, trying to clear the collapsed passageway.
      They pass chunks of stone out hand-to-hand, like a bucket
        brigade. It's slow going.

        A couple of tunnel people react as Weed, Jamie, and Catherine
        come INTO SHOT; Winslow notices and follows their eyes, his
        face darkening when he sees Weed... and Catherine. Silence
        falls as the others see the newcomers.

                                    WINSLOW
                              (pissed; to Jamie)
                      You bring a stranger here?! .

                                      JAMIE
                                (helplessly)
                      Not really a stranger...
                        Catherine.

        An excited murmur as Catherine and Weed push their way
        through the crowd to the cave-in site. Catherine's face is
        dark with concern, and she's fighting building panic.

                                      CATHERINE
                      Are they alive?

                                      WINSLOW
                      You know the rules, Jamie -

                                      CATHERINE
                              (sharply)
                        --Are they alive?

                                      WINSLOW
                              (a beat; sizing her up)
                      We don't know.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      36.


  47CONTINUED:47

      Weed is investigating the cave-in area, muttering softly to
        himself as the others make way for him, watching him
        hopefully.

                                    WORKER #1
                      Can you help, Weed? Maybe with one
                      of your machines -

                                    WINSLOW
                      Remember the Silence!

                                    JAMIE
                      No! The rule isn't as important as
                      Father's and Vincent's lives!

                                    WINSLOW
                      We don't need him!

                                    WEED
                      Yes you do. So do they. Never get
                      through this way, one rock at a
                      time.

                                    WINSLOW
                      It's the only way in!
                      We can do it -

                                    WEED
                      Not in time. Run out of air in
                      there before you get through.

                                      CATHERINE
                      There must be another way -

                                    WEED
                              (nods)
                      From the other side.

                                    WINSLOW
                      That's crazy! It's solid rock!

                                    WEED
                      No.Another tunnel. I remember.


  48ANOTHER ANGLE48

        Winslow storms over to get the old maps, brings them back
      for Weed to look at.

                                    WINSLOW
                      You remember wrong! There's no
                      other tunnel. See for yourself!

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        37.

                              (looks at the maps;
                                flatly)
                      Maps are wrong. I know what I
                        know... and I know.

                                      WINSLOW
                                (disgusted)
                      I told you! He's not some magic man
                      with a bag of tricks, he's crazy!
                        Everyone back to work!

                                    WEED
                              (to the others)
                      Got a new machine, digging
                        machine, best one yet. Dig in
                      from the other side -

                                      WINSLOW
                      --Get out of here, fool! We've
                      wasted enough time with you!

                                      WEED
                      Do it your way. Waste more time. Any
                      of you coming with me?

        Looks pass around as Weed waits... and Winslow glares.
        Jamie finally steps in with Weed and Catherine, staring at
        Winslow defiantly. Now two more Tunnel workers join their
        ranks. Winslow snorts contemptuously, turns away. Weed
        leads the way out.

                                                                  CUT TO:


  4949INT. INNER MAZE - IN THE DARKNESS

        Vincent's listening; he reacts with relief as the distant
        SOUNDS of DIGGING resume from the other end of the blocked
          crawlspace! He smiles reassuringly at Father.

                                      VINCENT
                        They've not given up... Neither
                      must we. Catherine's with them. I
                      sense her presence.

                                      FATHER
                      How did she...

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      38.


  49CONTINUED:49

                                    VINCENT
                      This bond between us is stronger,
                      deeper than either of us
                        understands. It's as if... our
                      spirits have joined... that somehow,
                      we're one.

                                      FATHER
                              (after a beat)
                      A bond can become a chain,
                      Vincent.

                                    VINCENT
                      Never. She is my life.
                      And always will be.

                                      FATHER
                      Your life... is here. You know
                      that. If anything should happen to
                      me, our people will need you more
                      than Catherine ever will. Your
                        responsibility must be to our
                      society, to the world we've built.


                                    VINCENT
                              (gently)
                      All will be well, Father.
                      Rest now.

        But Father can't rest until he speaks the words he knows
        must be spoken. He waits a moment, gathering his strength,
        then:

                                      FATHER
                      You don't know what it was like
                      in the early days... the violence,
                          the discord. There was no trust
                      between us, no sense of society,
                      merely roving bands preying on
                      the weak and helpless. It's taken
                      years for our world to evolve,
                      to become a safe place... Your voice
                      will be needed, Vincent.
                      To protect what I've given my life
                      for, to insure the continuation of
                      our world.
                              (beat)
                        Nothing... no one... must threaten...


        He tries to raise up on elbow; a jolt of pain takes his
        breath as Vincent eases him gently down.

                      Mine is not the only voice,
                        Father...

                                      FATHER
                      But it is the truest, the
                        strongest... the one all listen
                      most keenly to. You've no idea how
                        proud I am of you.
                                (beat)
                        Winslow has strength, but his
                        heart is hard, unyielding...
                        Strength alone can be
                        treacherous... as can weakness.
                      Your compassion is at once your
                        greatest attribute... and most
                        dangerous flaw.

                                      VINCENT
                              (a long beat)
                        I can never leave her, Father.
                      No more than you could back your
                      back on me.

                                      FATHER.
                        I know that. All I ask
                      is that you be willing
                      to weigh both your needs
                        against your duty to our
                        society.
                                (beat)
                        I know you find fault with our
                        rules... with punishment for those
                      who break them. But without order,
                        there is only chaos. You must temper
                      your great compassion with strength.

                                      VINCENT
                        I'll use the lessons you've taught me
                        when I must.
                              (a soft smile, stroking
                                Father's forehead)
                      But that time is a long way off.
                        We'll walk out of here together,
                        I promise you.

        Father squeezes Vincent's hand gratefully, finding hope in
        his words.

                                      FATHER
                        Talk to me, Vincent. I need to
                        keep my mind off... the dark...
                                (winces)

50INT. WEED'S CHAMBER - DAY50

      Catherine watches as Weed directs Jamie and two of the
      tunnel dwellers, who are wheeling a tarp-covered
      contraption from its place in one of the jumbled corners of
    the chamber. Now he steps forward, waves them away, and
      pulls the tarpaulin off with a flourish, a proud father
      showing off one of his favorite children. It's an old lawn
      mower reworked into a compressor, mounted on a rubber-
      wheeled platform.

                                  CATHERINE
                    It's... beautiful, Weed.

  51INT. A SECTION OF TUNNELS - DAY51

        The machine is pulled slowly through the darkened, misty
          tunnel. Catherine and Weed carry torches, lighting the way.


        As they go out of shot,

                                                                  CUT TO:                                                                                      42.


52INT. DANK TUNNEL52

        A small, dank tunnel somewhere deep within the tunnel world.
        The walls are wet, covered with fungus. Catherine stands with
        Jamie and the two tunnel dwellers, all holding torches aloft
      to give Weed light as he works. The "compressor" is almost
        painfully LOUD in these cramped quarters; the air is blue
        with exhaust smoke and dust. Weed is trying to drill through
        the wall into the inner maze -- where Father and Vincent are
        trapped. The drilling rig should look patched together,
        jerry-rigged with spare parts that Weed has collected --
        hoses, an old jack hammer, etc.


        The compressor's engine lugs, coughing and sputtering, as the
        makeshift drill bit chews into the bedrock... Suddenly, the
        bit breaks, sending Weed falling onto his backside with a
        muttered oath. Catherine moves to help him up. He rips off
        the old motorcycle goggles he's using as an eye shield and
        flings them away in disgust, then gives his machine a swift
        kick. It sputters and dies.

        Catherine thinks a moment; the pieces drop into place.
        It's not a solution she likes... but the only one
          available.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      43.

        Elliot is meeting with a couple of his architects, going over
        the plans for a new condominium project. He's in his
          shirtsleeves, tie loosened and sleeves rolled up, very
          Kennedy-esque. His attitude is that of a driven visionary,
        hypnotic and compelling.

                        people should get more than a view
                      of the park. They'll feel like

        desk to answer it.

                      I said no calls!
                            (a puzzled look)
                      Of course I'll see her.

      He hangs up, his expression hard to read. A
        moment as he mulls it, then:

                      Look, something's come up.
                      We'll reconvene in the morning.

        The architects hurriedly pack up their plans, spurred into
      high gear by his urgency...


56IN ELLIOT'S OUTER OFFICE - WITH CATHERINE56

        She's pacing nervously when Elliot herds the architects
        out of his office and crosses toward her.

                                      ELLIOT
                              (a nice smile)
                      This must be my lucky day...

                      I'm sorry to barge in on you, but
                      it's very important.

                                      ELLIOT
                      I'm thankful for such a lovely
                        interruption. Please...

      GO WITH them as he shows her toward his inner sanctum...


5757IN ELLIOT'S PRIVATE OFFICE

      as they come IN...

                                      ELLIOT
                      What's this about, Catherine? Isn't
                      D.A. Moreno satisfied with what I've
                      given you on Max Avery?

                                urgency from her voice)
                      I'm not here on business. I need a
                      favor.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                        47.

                      Are you all right? Here, sit
                      down, you look a little shaky.
                      Let me get you a brandy...

        He tries to steer her toward a chair, but she won't have
        it.

                                      CATHERINE
                        I don't want a brandy!
                                (catching herself;
                                evenly)
                      What I need is your help.

        He's still carrying the torch for her, but he's also
        nursing a bad case of hurt pride. And it makes him
          hesitate...

        He crosses to the bar, splashes whiskey in a glass, sips
        it, staring at her over the rim of the glass.

        Catherine twists on his silence for a long moment; anger
        surges and pushes her toward the door.

                                      CATHERINE
                        I was a fool to think --

                        Catherine! Don't walk out on me

                              (she turns)
                      Just tell me what you want.

        Catherine opens her purse, gets out her notebook, and
        tears off a sheet of paper, crosses to hand it to him. He
        reads... and laughs.

                                      ELLIOT
                        A drill bit?! Giving up the law
                      for hard rock mining, are you?

                                        CATHERINE
                        It's no joke. The need is real, and
                        immediate, and I don't have time to
                        spar with you.

      He goes to his desk, finds a number in his rolodex and
      picks up the phone.

                    wrote. The letters were returned
                    unopened. Are you always so certain
                    you're right? Things aren't black and
                    white, Catherine. They should be, but
                    they're not.

  59INNER MAZE - DAY59INT.

        Dark, oppressive silence. The only SOUND is Father's
        labored breathing. The long hours of pain and thinning air

60INT. - A SECTION OF TUNNELS - NIGHT60

        Catherine, Weed, Jamie, and the two tunnel dwellers are
        moving along the dark, misty tunnels, towing an old flatbed
        wagon between them. The wagon is loaded with the drill bits
        and a container of plastic explosive. The drill bits look
      like giant cork screws. Their torches throw eerie shadows
        against the walls as they make their way deeper into the
        bowels of the earth.                                                                                        51.


  61CLOSER - WEED AND CATHERINE61

        Weed is rolling a ball of plastic explosive between his
        fingers like a kid with a piece of clay.

        He takes Father under the arms, gently pulls him across
        the chamber. Father groans with pain:

                      It's all right... the pain reminds me
                      I'm alive...

  63INT.63DANK TUNNEL - NIGHT

        The small narrow tunnel is filled with noise and rock dust as
        Weed bores into the bedrock...

        Catherine, Jamie, and the two other tunnel dwellers load
        the flatbed wagon with the chunks of rock that fall from
        above, wheel them out...

        Off a TIGHT SHOT of the grinding DRILL BIT chewing its
        way through the rock, we

64DANK TUNNEL - LATER64

        Weed steps back, signals Catherine to cut the compressor.
        She does. He puts down the drill, moves toward the plastic
        explosive. Catherine looks on with concern as he digs out a
        huge wad of the stuff.

                                      CATHERINE
                      That seems like a lot...

                              and puts it back)
                      Maybe.

                                      CATHERINE
                      Don't you know?

        The tunnel people trade worried looks, slowly back down the
        tunnel toward safety. Weed hefts the wad, adds a little
        more to it.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                    53.

                    holes, put the little gizmos in, set

                    gizmo.

      He holds out his hand for the detonating antennas; she
      hesitates, desperately searching for another solution... but
      there isn't one. She gets them from the box, hands them to
      him. He whistles a little tune as he plants the antennas in
      the wads of plastic explosive -- Cathy looking on, fear
      bright in her eyes...

66INT. . DANK TUNNEL. NIGHT66

        Weed is finished rigging the explosives. He takes the
          electronic detonater out of the box, then unfastens Arthur's
        chain and plucks him off his shoulder, holds him out to
          Catherine.

                        Can't we detonate it from the
                        tunnel farther down?

                              (a long beat)
                      Show me what to do, and I'll do
                      it.

                      You get killed, Vincent will kill
                      Weed anyway. Go now.

        Catherine gives him a long, heartfelt look of gratitude,
        turns and starts out...


  6767FARTHER DOWN THE CONNECTING TUNNEL

        The other tunnel dwellers are waiting around a corner when
        Catherine comes INTO SHOT

  69DEEPER IN THE TUNNEL69

        as a terrific EXPLOSION rips loose from around the corner.
        Catherine and the others, crouching behind some boulders, are
        sent sprawling by the force of the concussion... Now silence
        settles in, leaden and forbidding...


  70CATHERINE70

        slowly raises to her elbows, reorienting herself, trying to
        see through the clouds of dust billowing from the explosion
        site. She struggles to her feet, gropes her way down the
        tunnel.


71ANGLE - VINCENT AND FATHER71

          materialize in the swirling dust, Vincent carrying Father
        across his shoulders. Father is unconscious.

                                      CATHERINE
                              (rushing toward them)

                        Father's badly hurt...

        Catherine helps Vincent ease Father to the ground, cradles
        his head while Vincent checks him over for injuries.

                                      VINCENT
                              (feeling his pulse)
                      His heart is strong...
                              (looks at her with deep
                                gratitude)
                      I knew you and Weed would not
                      fail.

        Catherine looks past Vincent toward the ante-chamber with
        concern; Weed hasn't appeared.

                                      CATHERINE
                      Did you see him? He stayed behind to
                      set off the explosives...

        Vincent, obviously worried, follows her gaze down the
        tunnel... smoke still drifts in the air. Now he rises,
        starts back down. It's an anxious moment...

                                      VINCENT
                        Weed...                                                                                    56.


72ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVORING WEED72

      as he emerges from the smoke, covered head to foot with
      dust, spitting dirt and wiping his eyes.

                              smile)
                    Used a touch too much...

      Vincent embraces him roughly, thanking him without words.


73ANOTHER ANGLE73

      Catherine smiles with a thankful relief as Father begins to
      stir. Vincent and Weed hurry to kneel at his side.

                                    VINCENT
                    Father...

      Father's eyes flicker, open...

                    Weed... Catherine. Vincent said
                    you'd come... I have no words to
                    thank you...

      He reaches to grasp their hands thankfully, the gesture
      saying it all, as we

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:


74EXT. CATHERINE'S SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT74

      Vincent and Catherine approach the entry point to Catherine's
      world, both bone-weary from their long ordeal, but finding
      warmth and comfort in each other's presence.

                                    VINCENT
                    Rest well, Catherine.
                    You must be exhausted.

                      I don't think I've ever been so
                      frightened.

                      It was a desparate time. A shadow of
                      fear fell across my heart.
                      Dark and chilling... thoughts of...
                      losing the man that's given me my
                      life.
                              (beat; trying to find
                                the words)
                      Your bravery saved us, Catherine.
                        Without you...

                                      CATHERINE
                      My life would mean nothing without
                      you to share it.

        They embrace for a long moment, then Catherine starts
        toward the entry point.

                                      VINCENT
                        Catherine... though our worlds
                        separate us, we can never be
                        apart.

        as she watches Vincent disappear into his world, then
        turns, and goes back to hers...
