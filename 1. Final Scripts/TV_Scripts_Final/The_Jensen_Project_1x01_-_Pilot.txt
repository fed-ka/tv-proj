      INT. JENSEN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

      We open on BRODY MONTGOMERY. His vitals splash across the 
      glass, wall-sized monitors of the Jensen Group's high-tech 
      headquarters.   

                                  COMPUTERIZED VOICE
                    Attention Brody Montgomery. Bio-
                    System Alert: Unidentified foreign 
                    object. Location: Left Aortic 
                    Valve. 

                                  BRODY
                    Uh...Mom?  

                                  MATT
                    Don t move, son.

      A 3-D digital mock-up of the NANOBOT pops on-screen. 

      Claire hops in a work station, punches in on the nanobot. The 
      team (INGRID, SAM, GINNY, NEEVA and KENDRICK) looks on.

                                  CLAIRE 
                    It s Edwin s nanobot.

                                  BRODY 
                    What s it doing inside me?

                                  INGRID
                          (sotto)
                    Edwin, what have you done?   

                                  MATT
                    It s taken control of his system.

      Everyone s trying to wrap their head around what they re 
      seeing.

                                  CLAIRE
                    We need extraction scenarios.

                                  BRODY
                    What about magneticism?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Too small to track with an ordinary 
                    magnet--                THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   2.  


                                  MATT 
                    And there s no way to know how  
                    your body will react.

                                  KENDRICK 
                          (looks at screen)
                    He s got a remote device 
                      controlling it. Anything we do, 
                    he ll see.

                                  BRODY
                    Maybe there s a way to flush it 
                    out.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Or draw it out through tear ducts 
                    or mucus--

                                  CLAIRE 
                    Too dangerous. It s physically 
                      impossible to remove without--

                          (over speakerphone)
                    Hello Claire.

      SOUNDWAVES of Edwin's voice UNDULATE and RIPPLE on-screen.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What have you done to my son?

                                  EDWIN
                          (over speakerphone)
                    I d say congratulations are in 
                    order. It was your prototype that 
                    paved the way for this micromachine 
                    that now controls the very 
                    heartbeat of your son.

                                  INGRID
                    Edwin, please. If this is about--

                          (over speakerphone)
                    I have nothing to say to you 
                    Ingrid. Claire, you and I both know 
                    what I m capable of doing with just 
                    the click of a button.                THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   3.  


                                  CLAIRE
                    What do you want?

                                  EDWIN
                    It s simple. Return what you ve 
                    stolen or you ll leave me no 
                    choice.

      Claire locks eyes with Matt and Brody. The implications are 
      clear.    

                                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

      EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

      CHYRON: Three Days Earlier

      We fade in on a typical suburban home, just outside of 
      Baltimore, Maryland where the Montgomery's currently live.

      INT. KITCHEN - DAY

      The morning news blares from a T.V. on the counter as the 
      MICROWAVE dings. 

      CLAIRE MONTGOMERY (30 s, smart as a whip, strikingly pretty) 
      looks up from a paper she s grading, pops her mug out of the 
      micro and gulps back some coffee. 

      Camera pans from the counter to the kitchen table and finds 
      BRODY MONTGOMERY (15, boy genius with a knack for getting in 
      trouble) perusing a textbook while listening on his I-Pod and 
      texting his buddies. 

      Claire turns back to the paper, jots down a few notes.

                                  CLAIRE
                      I practically spoon fed them the 
                    answers.

                                  BRODY
                    Can t all be as smart as you mom.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (looks over, annoyed)
                    What d I tell you about waiting 
                    till the last minute to do your 
                    homework?

                                  BRODY
                    Good thing I m done then, huh?                THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   4.  


      Brody closes his textbook. Before Claire can respond, MATT 
      MONTGOMERY (30 s, handsome doctor, big heart) sweeps through.

                                  MATT
                    Anyone seen my keys?

                                  CLAIRE 
                    Try the entry way table.

                                  MATT
                    Not there.

      Matt exits.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (turns, shouts after him)
                    What about the pants you were 
                    wearing last night?

                                  MATT
                          (O.S.)
                    Good idea.

                                  BRODY
                          (to Claire)
                    I don t feel so great. Can I stay 
                    home?

                                  CLAIRE
                          (feels forehead)
                    You don t feel feverish.

                                  BRODY
                    It s more in my chest.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You stay up late playing X-Box and 
                    texting your friends and then you 
                    dial it in, last-minute when it 
                    comes to your school work. And now 
                    you re saying you re sick?
                          (beat)
                    I don t buy it.

                                  BRODY
                          (gathers his things)
                    Fine. If you want me to infect the 
                    whole school.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You just want to do what you want 
                    to do.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                    And if something doesn t register 
                     cool  on your richter scale, you 
                    do just enough to squeak by. 

                                  BRODY 
                          (sotto, rolls his eyes)
                    Here we go again.

                                  CLAIRE
                    There s a world out there beyond 
                    your computer screen. And I expect 
                    you to start applying yourself and 
                    living up to your true potential. 
                          (beat)
                    Do something beyond yourself. 

                                  BRODY
                    Can I go now?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yes. 


      Brody grabs a cereal bar and exits. Claire looks off after 
      him, concerned. Matt enters.

                                  MATT
                    What is it this time?

                                  CLAIRE
                    What is it always?

                                  MATT
                    I ll talk to him when he gets home.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t know if talking works. He 
                    needs -- a real change. 

                                  MATT
                    Don t get all tied up in knots. 
                    He s a good kid.

      Matt pulls Claire in for a hug, she sees an ENVELOPE sticking 
      out of his breast pocket. Grabs it.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What s this?

                                  MATT
                          (tries to grab it back)
                    Nothing.                THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   6.

                          (reads)
                      Reservations at a bed and 
                      breakfast?

                                  MATT
                    It was supposed to be a surprise.
                          (beat)
                    Surprise.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Honey, that s so sweet. But I can t 
                    go this weekend. 

                                  MATT
                    Why not?

                                  CLAIRE
                    It s my shift at the shelter.

                                  MATT
                    Switch out with someone. 
                          (off her look)
                    We barely have time for dinner 
                    together. We need a get-away.

                                  CLAIRE 
                    How about dinner tonight?

                                  MATT
                    Can t. Got vaccinations.

                                  CLAIRE 
                    Tomorrow night?

                                  MATT
                          (shakes his head)
                    Funding app for the clinic s due. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    We ll figure this out--

      Matt leans in for a kiss. Claire s cell rings breaking the 
      moment. She grabs it and Matt s smooch lands on her ear.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                          (into cell)
                    Claire Montgomery...No...I m on my 
                    way.
                          (clicks off, to Matt)
                    Booked some time on a satellite for 
                    my students. Can t be late.                THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   7.  


                                  MATT
                          (looks at his watch)
                    I was supposed to take the Medivan 
                    in for servicing a half hour ago.

      Claire and Matt gather their things and race out the door. 

      FROM THE WINDOW IN THE KITCHEN DOOR: We see Matt and Claire s 
      cars pull out the driveway.

      ANGLE ON: The kitchen door swings open...revealing Brody.

      Brody steps back into the house, opens up his laptop and 
      jerry-rigs audio-bits of his conversation with his mom (that 
      he recorded on his I-Pod unbeknownst to her).

      Brody works the keyboard, splices together audio from 
      Claire s conversation with Brody.

                                  CLAIRE S VOICE 
                          (on laptop)
                    You stay up late...last-
                      minute...you re saying you re 
                      sick?...you don t feel feverish.

      Brody dials a number on his cell. It rings. He puts his phone 
      on speaker, next to his laptop.

                                  VOICE (O.S.)
                    Marshall Heights High School. This 
                    is Ms. Peggy. How may I help you?

      Brody presses a button to activate the recording of his mom.

                                  CLAIRE
                    It s Claire Montgomery. Brody s 
                    mom. Sorry to call last-minute.  

                                  BRODY
                          (as Claire)
                    He stayed up late, feeling feverish 
                    so we re going to keep him home.  

                                  MS. PEGGY
                          (O.S.)
                    Thanks for call. 

      Brody clicks off. A broad smile spreads across his face -- 
      now he has a sick day to do whatever he wants.  

                                                                            CUT TO:                THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   8.  


      INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY

      Claire monitors her STUDENTS (seated at a bank of high-tech 
      computers) as they re-task satellites.

                          (to students)
                    Be careful of the frequency. Don t 
                    wanna lose the signal.

      She steps up behind JOSH (African American, late teens), 
      watches him work.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                    Nice work, Josh. 

                                  JOSH
                    This is...amazing. How d you get us 
                    in here?

                    How are the applications coming?

                                  JOSH
                    Can t afford to transfer to a four-
                    year college after this.

                                  CLAIRE
                    That s what scholarships are for. 
                    I ll write your recommendations. 

                                  JOSH
                    I know. I appreciate it. It s just--

                                  CLAIRE
                    It d be such a waste if you didn t 
                    continue with your studies. 

                                  JOSH
                    Can I ask you a personal question?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Sure.

                                  JOSH 
                    You went to MIT and graduated with

      INT. HIGH SCHOOL OFFICE - DAY (INTERCUT AS NECESSARY) 

      Brody s teacher, MS. BANKS sits at her desk on the phone.

                                  MS. BANKS
                    Hi Claire. It s Ms. Banks. I e-
                    mailed Brody his homework 
                      assignment. Sorry to hear he s sick

      EXT. WIDE OPEN SKY - DAY

      ECU on BRODY S FACE as it s pummeled by 120mph winds. 

      We pull back and see his entire BODY bouyed by the high force 
      winds. 

        Exhilarated, Brody shouts and turns flips and just when we 
      think he s free-falling, mid-skydive at a thousand feet--

      We pull back and reveal...he s in a WIND TUNNEL SIMULATOR.  

                                                                            CUT TO:

      INT. CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - DAY

      QUINT (18) sits on an exam table. His MOTHER (34) sits in a 
      chair nearby. She stands when Matt enters the room.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   10.  


                                  MOTHER
                    We been everywhere. Even took a bus 
                    to the University. They say his 
                    fever ll go away but even aspirin 
                    won t help. 

                                  QUINT
                    They all say,  It s just a virus.  
                    But it keeps coming back every few 
                    days. I can t get outta bed.  

                                  MATT
                    Let me take a look.

      Quint yanks off his shirt.  Matt takes note of his FARMERS 
      TAN - it s the middle of winter. 

      INT. CLINIC - LAB

      Small room. One Tech. Matt at a microscope. INTERCOM BUZZES.

                                  NURSE (V.O.)
                    Doc. Got a full waiting room. Neb s 
                    done in Two, and the physical s 
                    been waiting for half an hour.

      Matt sighs. Pulls out a prescription pad, starts writing.

      INT. CLINIC - EXAM ROOM

      Matt enters. Quint has his shirt on. His Mother in the chair.

                                  MATT
                          (handing him the scrip)
                    You have malaria.

                                  MOTHER
                    Isn t that a tropical disease?

                                  MATT
                    It can show up in the South 
                      sometimes. Where were you?

                                  QUINT
                      Mississippi. Visiting Grandma.

      In the doorway:  Claire appears.

                                  CLAIRE
                    It s Brody. He cut school.

                                  MATT
                          (to Nurse)
                    I ll be in my office.               THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   11.  


      The Nurse nods. Matt exits into the hallway.

      INT. CLINIC HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Matt and Claire walk down the hall to his office.

                                  MATT
                    Do you know where is he?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Not yet. I bounced a signal off a 
                    satellite to find him. 

                                  MATT
                    How d you do that?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Too hard to explain right now but 
                    I ll have his location soon. Then, 
                    we both go and confront him. 

                                  MATT
                    I have a waiting room full of 
                    patients.

                                  CLAIRE
                    This is our son. 

      INT. MATT S OFFICE - DAY

      Matt and Claire enter.

                                  CLAIRE
                    The office has us on record as 
                    writing sick notes, seven times. On 
                    your letter head. They warned him 
                    that the next time would warrant a 
                    call, so he faked my voice this 
                    morning and now, he s gone.

                                  MATT
                          (impressed)
                    Wonder how he did that?

                                  CLAIRE
                    This isn t funny. He forged your 
                      signature. And faked my voice.

                                  MATT 
                    He s a smart kid.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Too smart for his own good.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   12.  


                                  MATT
                    Maybe that s the problem. Why else 
                    would he skip school and put off 
                    doing his homework?

                                  CLAIRE
                    How  bout a lack of respect for his 
                    parents, blatant disregard for 
                    authority and an attitude that the 
                    rules don t apply to him. 

                                  MATT
                    Maybe they don t. At least not the 
                    ones we ve established.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What are you saying?

                                  MATT
                    Brody s gifted and while we thought 
                    giving him a  normal  life was best 
                    -- maybe it s not.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (defensive)
                    Are you blaming me for the decision 
                    we BOTH made over a decade ago?

                                  MATT
                    No, Claire. I m --

      Suddenly, an elegantly dressed, late fifties WOMAN appears in 
      the doorway. 

                                  MATT (CONT'D)
                          (shocked)
                    Ingrid? 

                                  INGRID
                    The receptionist said to head back 
                      straight-away. I can wait in--

                                  MATT
                    No, come in...

      Matt crosses and hugs Ingrid. Claire doesn t move an inch. 
      Her lack of warmth is not lost on Matt or Ingrid.

                                  MATT (CONT'D)
                    I can hardly believe you re here. 
                    It s been what?  Fifteen years.

      Ingrid nods.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   13.  


                                  CLAIRE
                          (icy)
                    What are you doing here?

                                  INGRID
                    Wish I could say it s purely a 
                    social visit but -- Edwin s left 
                    the Jensen Group.

                                  CLAIRE 
                    I don t understand -- Edwin is the 
                    Jensen Group.

                                  MATT
                          (shoots Claire a look, 
                            covering)
                    The two of you are the Jensen 
                    Group.

                                  INGRID
                    No, Claire s right. He s always 
                    been the brain behind the research 
                    arm and I m the heart of the 
                      administration. But this is bigger 
                    than just Edwin. He s taken his 
                    team and a half dozen others and I 
                    believe he s so desperate for  
                    approval, that he might do 
                    something profoundly stupid.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Why?

                                  INGRID
                    I urged him to take a step back.

      FLASH -- EDWIN TO INGRID: You re not tabling my research.

                                  INGRID (CONT'D)
                    But he mistook my hesitancy as a 
                    lack of belief in him. 

      FLASH -- INGRID: It s not time Edwin. We ve got to put it 
      through the same protocols as every other project.

                                  INGRID (CONT'D)
                    And then I mentioned Father. That 
                    was a mistake.

      FLASH -- INGRID: The same protocols that father put in place. 
      Edwin turns cold at the mention of his father s name.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   14.  


                                  INGRID (CONT'D)
                    He said he d heard enough. That the 
                    time for...

      FLASH -- EDWIN: Waiting is over. INGRID: I control the trust 
      that funds our work. EDWIN: But you don t control me.

                                  INGRID (CONT'D)
                    I thought he just needed time. But 
                    the next morning, he was gone.

      FLASH -- INGRID: Edwin?  Door creaks open revealing Edwin s 
      empty office.  

                                  INGRID (CONT'D)
                    Then I found out about the others. 
                    His team and six of the department 
                    heads.  

                                  MATT
                    Do you know why they left?

                                  INGRID
                    Edwin made appeals to virtually 
                    half the staff.

      FLASH -- EDWIN: Aren t you tired of never getting credit for 
      your work. No accolades, no research grants, no Nobel. We are 
      the best and the brightest. We hold the future in our hands. 
      And the time is now. Who s with me?

                                  INGRID (CONT'D)
                    In addition to his staff and a few

                                  INGRID
                    Edwin was ready to take the nanobot 
                    to the next phase of testing. He 
                    felt the rewards far outweighed the 
                    risks. I disagreed.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   15.

                    The consequences could be

                    I need you to come back to Jensen, 
                    help me find Edwin and stop him

                    I have to pick up my son.

                    I need you Claire. Not only do you 
                    know how Edwin thinks but he s 
                    trying to perfect a piece of 
                      technology that you developed--

                                  CLAIRE
                    I can t believe you have the nerve 
                    to ask me a favor. When I needed 
                    you the most, you turned your back 
                    on me.

                                  INGRID
                    This is much bigger than you or me. 
                    Or else I wouldn t be here. This

                    there could be serious consequences

      Off Claire, clearly conflicted.

      EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - DAY

      Claire s car screeches to a halt outside a private airport. 
      Matt and Claire jump out.

                                  MATT 
                    I ll search the hangars.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I ll check with the office. Maybe 
                    they ve seen him.

      INT. AIRPORT OFFICE - DAY  

      Brody crosses to the WIND TUNNEL SIMULATOR OPERATOR.

                                  BRODY
                    Thanks for squeezing me in. Between 
                    us, ok?

      Brody slips the Operator cash. He nods, pockets the cash.

      EXT. AIRPORT OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

      Brody exits, spots his mom s car and quickly turns in the 
      other direction when Claire rounds the corner.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What were you thinking?

                    Trust is earned. And you ve 
                    betrayed ours one too many times.

      Up walks Matt.

                                  MATT
                    You forged doctor s notes using my

                                  BRODY
                    I can explain.

                                  MATT
                    What are you doing here anyway?

      Brody pulls out his I-pod.

                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t want to hear it.

                    I was testing the rate of travel

                    So much for a united front.

                          (to Brody)
                    Just grab your bag and come on.

                                  BRODY
                    Where are we going?

      Brody grabs his bag. 

      Claire and Matt head towards a sleek, private HELICOPTER with 
      the Jensen Group logo emblazoned on the side. 

      Ingrid stands beside it, looking very official. Brody s 
      instantly suspicious.

                                  BRODY (CONT'D)

                    I ll change. Mom, please, can we 
                    talk about this?

                                  MATT
                    Relax. We re not sending you away.

                    Care to elaborate?

      Matt, Claire and Brody step up to the helicopter. The chopper 
      blades start to twirl. Off them...

      EXT. SKY - DAY  

      The Jensen chopper cuts through the clear blue sky.

      INT. HELICOPTER - DAY  

      Brody stares out the window. Claire leans forward, mid-
      discussion with Matt and Ingrid (seated in front). 

                                  CLAIRE
                    ...why not call the cops?

                                  INGRID
                    He s my brother.

                    Have you tried tracking his credit 
                    card or bank transactions?

                                  INGRID
                    Yes, but there s been no activity. 
                    He does have a small inheritance 
                    that I don t control and I believe 
                    that s what he s using to get by.

                                  MATT
                    Any family or friends he d stay 
                    with?

                                  INGRID 
                    The Jensen Group is our only  
                    family. That s what was so hard 
                    about losing you two.

      IN THE BACK SEAT:

      Brody watches the world whiz by. Claire leans back next to 
      him (as Matt and Ingrid continue talking up front). 

                                  BRODY
                          (to Claire)

                    I ve alerted our colleagues. If

      Dark leather interior, polished wood and brass accents. This 
      is where powerful men make deals that change the world.

      We make our way through the room and find Edwin, mid-pitch to 
      a very distinguished and impeccably dressed, Mr. Cho (Asian, 
      mid-thirties, handsome but intimidating).

                                  EDWIN
                    We re this close to a break through 
                    that could change modern medicine

                          (corrects himself)
                    Will. I mean will. 

      Edwin swigs back a mouthful of scotch. Nervous.

                                  EDWIN
                      I understand.

                    As long as I get appropriate credit 
                    and have full autonomy over my 
                    staff, the lab and our 
                      process...I m fine with that.

                                  CHO
                    Once we re in business together, 
                    there s no turning back. 
                          (leans forward)
                    Are you sure you want to do this?

      A long beat as Edwin considers.

                                  EDWIN
                    Yes.

                                  CHO
                    Then get ready to be rich.

      EXT. SKY - DAY  

      The chopper starts it s descent. Brody stares out over the 
      Jensen campus. 

      The various buildings dusted with snow, the wooded terrain of 
      the Alleghaney Mountains and an old hunting lodge smack dab 
      in the middle of all. Think Ralph Lauren winter retreat -- 
      beautiful, majestic and impressive.

                                  CLAIRE 
                          (to Brody, re: lodge)
                    That s where your father and I 
                    first met.

                                  MATT
                    Feels like coming home.


      EXT. HELIPAD - DAY  

      The four of them step out of the chopper. Matt and Claire 
      take in their surroundings. Brody is clearly blown away.

                                  BRODY
                    What is this place?

                    Welcome to the Jensen Group, Brody.  

      In a series of QUICK CUTS Ingrid brings the trio up to speed:              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   22.  


      INT. MAIN LODGE - DAY

      They sweep through the lodge. Old school meets new school 
      (wood beams, worn leather, sliding doors, light sensors).

                                  INGRID (CONT'D)
                    The Jensen Group is one of the 
                    premier think tanks and research 
                      facilities in the world.
                          (points to portrait)
                    Founded by my father, the late 
                    William Jensen, we are a collective 
                    of great minds that not only 
                    theorize about ways to improve the 
                    world -- but do it.

      INT. LAB SPACE - DAY  

      A cool experiment. The foursome walks through.

                                  INGRID
                    Fully funded and operated by the 
                    trust that my father left. Four 
                    hundred and thirty seven techs, 
                      apprentices, department heads and 
                    support staff...

      INT. GREEN HOUSE - DAY  

      Rows of hanging plants, trees and experimental crops. The 
      gang walks past.

                                  INGRID
                    On forty-three acres of land hidden 
                    in the mountains of Pennsylvania. 
                    We have our own garden, farm and 
                    water supply so if the proverbial 
                    poo ever hit the fan, we could 
                    continue our mission undeterred.

      INT. COOL ARCHITECTURAL SPACE - DAY  

      Steel beams amongst a wall of green glass windows.

                                  INGRID
                    Our sole purpose is to pioneer 
                    ground breaking technology, data 
                    and research, run it through 
                    extensive protocols and once 
                      perfected...

      INT. LODGE LOBBY - DAY  

      Back where they started in the lobby of the main lodge.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   23.  


                                  INGRID
                    We give it to the world freely and 
                      anonymously for the benefit of all 
                    mankind.

      She points to a wall of magazine covers (Time Man of the 
      Year, Inventions that Changed the World, Nobel winners).

                                  INGRID (CONT'D)
                    These are a few of our award-
                    winning distinctions.

                                  BRODY
                    But you didn t get credit. 
                          (re: photos)
                    They did.

                                  INGRID
                    At Jensen, it s about the work. We 
                    always filter our discoveries 
                    through a third party.

                                  MATT
                    So if we develop a new vaccine -- 
                    it s given to an organization like 
                    the CDC or the World Health 
                      Organization. 

                                  BRODY
                    But why?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Saves other people a lot of time 
                    and money. And since the goal is to 
                    help rather than profit, the 
                    resulting technology is pure in 
                    it s motives and objectives.

                                  INGRID
                    Which is what concerns me most 
                    about Edwin.

      KENDRICK JAMES (African American, 50 s, big bear of a man 
      with a heart of gold) walks up to the group.

                                  KENDRICK
                    You must be the Montgomerys. I m 
                    Kendrick.

                                  INGRID 
                    Kendrick this is Matt and Claire 
                    and their son Brody.

      They shake and say hellos.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   24.  


                                  INGRID (CONT'D)
                    Kendrick is the department head of  
                      Aeronautical Engineering. And our 
                    de facto chief of security.

                                  KENDRICK
                    It s a pleasure to finally meet 
                    you. Ingrid talks about y all like 
                    family.

                                  INGRID
                    That s because they are.

      Kendrick hands two KEY CARDS to Matt and Claire.

                                  KENDRICK
                    Just had these activated. They ll 
                    give you access to every department 
                    and their files.  

                                  INGRID
                          (to Matt and Claire)
                    I d like to get you both 
                      acclimated.

                                  MATT
                    Great - let s get to it.

                                  BRODY
                    What about me?

                                  INGRID
                    You, my dear, are free to roam the 
                    premises.

                                  BRODY
                    Cool.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Just about every room you could 
                    wonder into contains years and 
                    years of invaluable research.  Go 
                    straight to the main lobby, sit 
                    down, and don t touch anything.

                                  BRODY
                    Got it.

      A series of QUICK CUTS show Brody exploring Jensen.  

        --ANTHROPOLOGY: A 3-D digital projection of a T-Rex SKELETON 
      floats in the air. Brody reaches out to touch it then walks 
      through wide-eyed as bone fragments reflect off his face.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   25.  


        --ASTRO-PHYSICS: Protective GLOVES in a GLASS BOX grab at 
      gooey, clay-like balls that float weightlessly through the 
      air. The gloved HANDS mash and stretch the balls like silly 
      putty. 

      Brody listens as a Tech explains: The uses are infinite. Non-
      toxic, water soluble, can be used to heal a bloody wound 
      during battle or seal a leak on the Space Shuttle. Off Brody. 

      --MARINE BIOLOGY: A manna STING RAY floats overhead in the 
      glass encased tank. Brody looks up, fascinated.  

      INT. EDWIN S OFFICE - DAY  

      Ingrid leads Claire and Matt into Edwin s private study.

                                  INGRID
                    Edwin s entire team went with him, 
                    so all we have are a few file boxes 
                    and what s saved on the mainframe.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Has anyone gone through this stuff?

                                  INGRID
                    We tried but Edwin writes in that 
                    secret shorthand you two created. 
                    No one else can understand it. It 
                    changes.

                                  CLAIRE
                    It s based on an algorithm. 

                                  MATT
                    You two had a secret code? 

                                  CLAIRE
                          (nods)
                    I can t believe he still uses it.
                    He was paranoid someone would steal 
                    his ideas.

                                  INGRID
                    Still is. 

                                  MATT
                    Irony is, that s what he ended up 
                    doing.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (to Ingrid)
                    Can you tell me more about your 
                    last conversation. Anything he said 
                    that might help?              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   26.  


                                  INGRID
                    Not really. It was all about him.

      FLASH -- Edwin walks down the hall, frustrated. Points at 
      some framed covers. EDWIN: Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine... 
      And now it s my turn.

                                  CLAIRE
                    To do what?

                                  INGRID
                    That s the million dollar question.
                    After I take Matt to immunology, 
                    I ll be in Headquarters if you need 
                    anything. We ll have a workstation 
                    up and running for you both. Thanks 
                    again for coming.

                                  CLAIRE
                    This was Matt s idea not mine. 

      Claire turns to the boxes, starts digging. Matt shrugs, 
      ushers Ingrid out. Off Claire, searching for a clue.  

      EXT. MAIN LODGE HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      Ingrid and Matt walk and talk. 

                                  MATT
                          (re: Claire)
                    Don t worry. She ll come around.

                                  INGRID
                    She s still upset with me after all 
                    these years. I m not sure she ll 
                    ever get past it.

                                  MATT
                    She s here -- it s a start.
                          (looks around)
                    Feels good to be back.

                                  INGRID
                    Like old times.

                                  MATT
                    I m sorry about Jacob. We heard 
                    well after the funeral. You guys 
                    were a great couple.

                                  INGRID
                    In the end it was his body that 
                    gave out, not his spirit. But I 
                    know he s still with me...
                                  (MORE)              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   27.  

                                  INGRID (CONT'D)
                          (pats her heart)
                      especially during times like this.

                                  MATT
                    How are you doing?

                                  INGRID
                    Honestly, I feel betrayed and 
                      abandoned. Edwin s the only family 
                    I have left on this earth. Yet I 
                    know he felt betrayed by me, too.  

      INT. LABORATORY HALLWAY - DAY  

      Cho and Edwin walk down the corridor of a high-tech building.

                                  CHO
                    Based on the list you gave me, we 
                    made arrangements for the necessary 
                    lab equipment and installs.

                                  EDWIN
                    And the living accommodations for 
                    my staff?

                                  CHO
                    Done. 

                                  EDWIN
                    Thank you. 

                                  CHO
                      Everything and anything that you 
                    need are at your disposal. Just say 
                    the word and either myself or one 
                    of my associates will handle it.

      Edwin and Cho walk up to a set of double doors. One of Cho s 
         associates  BUD (30 s, bodyguard type) opens the door...

      INT. LAB SPACE - CONTINUOUS

      Revealing a large and ultramodern lab space. 

      Cho flicks on the lights, illuminating a glass and steel, two 
      story lab with multiple workstations. Edwin beams.

                                  CHO
                    What do you think?

                                  EDWIN
                      It s...perfect.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   28.  


                                  CHO
                    Good then -- I ll let you get 
                    started. 

      Off Edwin, as he takes in his new lab.    

      EXT. MAIN LODGE HALLWAY - DAY  

      Brody plods behind an APPRENTICE (20 s) with a beaker full of 
      liquid. The apprentice crosses into Jensen Headquarters.

      BRODY S POV: The Apprentice steps on a digitized PAD in the 
      doorway of HQ (think welcome mat). The apprentice s name pops 
      on screen: FRANCINE LEE -- Access Approved, as do her vitals.

      Brody peeks into HQ from the hallway, sees the HIGH TECH ROOM 
      with WALL-SIZED, GLASS MONITORS (think CTU s wide, open space 
      meets the bridge of Star Fleet Command)

                                  BRODY
                    Sweet.

      INT. JENSEN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

      Brody enters, but when he crosses the threshold the screen 
      reads: ALERT INTRUDER. ACCESS DENIED. Dept. Heads turn 
      annoyed.

                                  BRODY
                    My bad.    

      EXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

      Brody ducks out embarrassed. As he walks down the hall and 
      looks out the window, he notices

      OUTSIDE: A FIGURE dressed in ski gear carrying a snow board

                                  BRODY 
                    Hmmm...

      EXT. MAIN LODGE - MOMENTS LATER

      Brody looks around but the figure is gone. He looks at the 
      ground and sees a set of BOOT TRACKS so he pulls up his 
      hoodie and quickly follows the trail...

      AROUND THE LODGE, through some TREES, down a DIRT PATH until 
      he comes upon a MAINTENANCE SHED.

      EXT. MAINTENANCE SHED - MOMENTS LATER

      The Boot Tracks end at the shed door. Brody scrapes at the 
      ice on the door window, tries to peek in. Can t see anything.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   29.  


                                  BRODY
                          (knocks)
                    Hello?  

      No answer. He tries the door -- it s locked. Then Brody sees 
      a KEYPAD. Looks around. No one s in sight. 

      Brody pops the key pad cover off. Hacks it. CLICK -- the 
      unlocked door creaks open. Brody ducks in.

      INT. MAINTENANCE SHED - CONTINUOUS

      Brody walks in -- amazed to see that inside this shed lies a 
      TEEN GET-AWAY complete with a VIRTUAL REALITY ROOM.

      Projected on the walls are VIDEOS streaming X-treme sports 
      footage: SURFERS riding a rip curl, a SNOWBOARDER doing a 
      nose dive off a mountain.

      There s an X- Box, a Play Station, a Wii and a massive STEREO 
      and FLATSCREEN with surround sound. 

                                  BRODY
                    Now this...is really cool.

      Brody walks around. Unbeknownst to him, the FIGURE watches 
      from a distance then approaches from behind -- and KNOCKS OUT 
      BRODY!  Off Brody, as the figure drags him away.          


                                  END OF ACT TWO              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   30.

      It s PITCH BLACK. A SPOT LIGHT flicks on revealing Brody--

      DUCT-TAPED to a chair in the middle of the room. He squirms 
      to break free. 

                                  BRODY
                    What s going on?

      Suddenly the lights flick on revealing SAMANTHA CORTEZ aka 
      SAM (16, Latina tom boy tough and Seventeen pretty).

      Off Brody, confused.

      INT. EDWIN S OFFICE - DAY  

      Claire sits on the floor amid several empty office boxes. She 
      has their research papers pulled out and organized in stacks. 

      She picks up one page.

      EDWIN S RESEARCH PAPER

      A drawing of a prosthetic leg is surrounded by arrows and 
      cryptic jottings. But the whole page is X d out and written 
      over with:  Neeva said no.

                    I m not surprised at all that he s 
                    up and left. Good riddance.

                                  CLAIRE
                    You two butted heads on more than 
                    one occasion?

                                  NEEVA
                    Try every occasion. Edwin made it 
                    his personal goal to belittle my 
                      contributions to the team. If it 
                    weren t for Ingrid, I d have left

                      theoretical stage to a practical 
                      application without a thorough 
                      investigation from my team.

                                  NEEVA
                    Mine. I m the head of the Ethics 
                      Department. We weigh the 
                      implications of all new technology--
                    moral, ethical, and philosophical. 
                    And if we say no, it s dead in the 
                    water -- unless the board gives a 
                      provisional state of grace for 
                    further internal testing.

                    What happens if Ingrid overrules 
                    you?

                                  NEEVA
                    She rarely has.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Did she with that prosthetic 
                    project?

                                  NEEVA
                    No, she agreed with us one hundred 
                    percent. We tabled the research and 
                    Edwin was gone the next day.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   33.  


                                  CLAIRE
                    What was the problem?

                                  NEEVA
                    He wanted to use nanotechnology to 
                    control the prosthetic through an 
                    interface with the nerve remnants 
                    in the stump. But it caused too 
                    much pain for the subject. Edwin 
                    thought the ends justified the 
                    means. We didn t.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Control the prosthetic?  He could 
                    control everything.  Subject s body 
                      functions, brain functions..

                                  NEEVA
                      Precisely.  You can see why we were 
                    hesitant to put that out into the 
                    world.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Did he use my research for this?

                                  NEEVA
                          (nods)
                    He actually acknowledged your work 
                    as foundational. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    Really?

                                  NEEVA
                    He thought quite highly of you. 
                    Said you were the most promising 
                    young scientist he d encountered in 
                    decades. But then you left. Why?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Met Matt, got married, had a kid...

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Edwin and Ingrid got in a huge 
                    fight. Said he was tired of waiting 
                    so he took Jensen property, 
                    including half the staff. Not cool. 
                    So not cool. 

      Brody pops his head up at the end of a row of plants. Sees 
      nothing. Ducks down to follow Sam s voice.

                                  SAMANTHA (CONT D)
                    He betrayed the very people that 
                    trusted him. And he left his sister 
                    to clean up the mess.

                                  BRODY
                    That s why Ingrid wanted my 
                    parents? 

      Sam spots Brody s FEET. She sidles along the floor to him.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    They re the only ones she can 
                    trust. Apparently your mom is the 
                    brainiac that developed the piece 
                    of tech Edwin stole. And your dad 
                    and mom met working on that very 
                    project, so Ingrid thinks that if 
                    anyone can figure where Edwin is 
                    and what he s doing -- it s them.

                                  BRODY
                    Really?

      Brody tries to get a bead on Sam -- and just when he thinks 
      he s got her.  He sees her comm abandoned, realizes it s a 
      trap, turns--

      And Sam s upon him. She shoots. SPLAT!  NEON GREEN PAINT dead 
      center in Brody s solar plexus.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Gotcha!  

      Brody collapses, panicking.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   37.  


                                  BRODY
                    (between raspy breaths)
                    I. Can t. Breathe.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    It ll pass. I hit you in your solar 
                    plexus. Your diaphragm s in spasm 
                    from the impact. Just a nerve 
                    reflex.

      Brody gulps in air.

                                  SAMANTHA (CONT D)
                    See?

      Brody is smitten.

      EXT. STREETS - DAY  

      CHYRON: MONTREAL, CANADA

      An old Gothic cathedral stands watch as Edwin, Bud and TWO 
      HENCHMEN trot into an alley toward a back service entrance 
      labeled -- HIGHLAND LABORATORIES.

      EXT. HIGHLAND LABORATORIES - DAY

      GLASS SHATTERS. Bud pulls his gloved hand back through the 
      service door s broken window.

      INT. MONTREAL LAB - SERIES OF QUICK CUTS

      -- Henchman 1 quickly disables the alarm

      -- Bud sprays black paint on security cams

      -- They enter the second floor. Open doors and peer in.

      INT. LAB ROOM - DAY

      Edwin spots the molecular assembler. Crosses to it.

                                  EDWIN
                          (hushed, to Bud)
                    Over here.

      Bud crosses, picks up the assembler.

                                  EDWIN (CONT D)
                          (sotto)
                    Careful this time.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   38.  


      Rolling his eyes, Bud misses the arrival of the SECURITY 
      GUARD. Edwin ducks behind a counter as a flashlight beam 
      covers the spot he just left. The team darts around -- 

      -- and the Guard just misses them. The Guard clicks his 
      radio.

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    (into radio)
                    Musta been a glitch in the system. 
                    All s clear.

      The guard clicks off his flashlight and exits the room.

      INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

      The Security Guard hears FOOTSTEPS running down the stairs 
      until they re supplanted by the stairwell DOOR CLOSING. 

      He pursues.

      INT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

      The gang burst out of the stairwell. Security Guard #2 at the 
      front desk spots them and jumps up to give chase.

                                  SECURITY GUARD #2
                    Freeze!

      But they don t.

      EXT. MONTREAL STREETS - DAY  

      Edwin struggles to keep up with Bud and the henchmen as they 
      race through dark, back alleys with both Security Guards in 
      hot pursuit.  

                                  SECURITY GUARD
                    Hold it!  

      Security Guard follows, calling for back-up and the police.

      HIS POV: Edwin and team race up the stairs of the Cathedral 
      into the exiting churchgoers.

      INT. CATHEDRAL - CONTINUOUS

      Edwin, Bud and Henchmen dodge through stragglers and slide 
      past pews as the Security Guards enter the sanctuary, losing 
      ground. 

      They dash through the side hall to a door.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   39.  


      EXT. CATHEDRAL - SECONDS LATER

      Bud kicks out a side door as Edwin and the henchmen run 
      through and jump into a car and speed off.

      INT. JENSEN MAIN LODGE - IMMUNOLOGY DEPARTMENT

      Matt hovers over a microscope as Ingrid sweeps in.

                                  INGRID
                    There you are --

                                  MATT
                    I can t believe this. If I had one 
                    tenth of what s been spent on this 
                      equipment, my clinic would be state-
                      of-the-art and I d have a free 
                    pharmacy. Not to mention what your 
                    medical research will accomplish. 
                    Just think what I could do for my 
                    patients.

                                  INGRID
                    Just think what you could do for 
                    the world...if you stayed here.

                                  MATT
                    I know where this is going. Life 
                    beats at a very different pace now.

                                  INGRID
                    Doesn t have to...

      And as if on cue Brody enters with Sam in tow. Grabs his Dad 
      in a wrestling hold around the neck.

                                  BRODY
                    How come you never told me about 
                    this place?

                                  MATT
                    We did. Classic case of in one ear 
                    and out the other.

                                  BRODY
                    You made it sound like some lame-o 
                    science camp -- but this is cool.

                                  SAMANTHA
                          (reloading paintball gun)
                    That s cuz they re cool. Did you 
                    know your dad like invented the 
                    treatment for macular degeneration.

                      Blindness? Old people? Seeing 
                    again?

                                  BRODY
                    No. I get it -- I just didn t know.

                                  MATT
                          (to Sam)
                    And you are?

                                  INGRID
                    Matthew Montgomery meet Samantha 
                    Cortez, the youngest apprentice in 
                    Jensen history.

                                  SAMANTHA
                      Pleasure s all mine.

      Sam shakes Matt s hand. Brody notices Sam s reloaded gun.

                                  BRODY
                    (to Matt)
                    Hate to chat and run, but--

      Brody bolts, Sam quickly follows suit, calls back:

                                  SAMANTHA (O.S.)
                    Nice meeting you, Doc.

                                  MATT
                          (to Ingrid)
                    Where d you find her?

                                  INGRID
                      Hot-wiring my car. I caught her red-
                    handed but when I warned her that 
                    it was impossible because of its 
                      computerization, she bet me.

                                  MATT
                    And she won. You always find the 
                    good ones.

                                  INGRID
                    I found you -- didn t I? And 
                    Claire. I wonder how she s doing? 
                    Maybe I should check on her.

                                  MATT
                    Give her some space -- this is 
                    still where the battle of Wounded 
                    Pride went down.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   41.  


                                  INGRID
                    Edwin s pride was wounded, too. I 
                    don t think he ever got over her 
                    leaving.

                                  MATT
                    I ve never understood Edwin.

                                  INGRID
                    He s desperate for...validation.

                                  MATT
                    Then he should invent the cure for 
                    AIDS.

                                  INGRID
                    That s more your style.

                                  MATT
                      I suppose. And my guess is you d 
                    cure Alzheimer s?

      Ingrid nods. Claire saunters in.

                                  INGRID
                    And Claire would cure all the other 
                    brain diseases.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (catching on)
                    And Edwin -- he would manipulate 
                    gene expression.

                                  MATT
                    He d need some pretty specialized 
                    equipment for that.

                                  CLAIRE
                    If he gets up and running with 
                    funding from the wrong people...

      Ingrid stiffens to defend her brother, then doesn t respond.  
      Ginny dashes in.

                                  GINNY
                      A molecular assembler was stolen 
                    from a lab in Montreal.

      Matt and Claire lock eyes.


                                  END OF ACT THREE              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   42.  


                                        ACT FOUR

      INT. ANTI-GRAVITY CHAMBER - DAY 

      Brody floats weightless across the screen. Sam enters frame, 
      somersaults through the air.

      We pull back and find them in the ANTI-GRAVITY chamber with 
      Kendrick on the outside of the chamber manning the controls.

                                  BRODY
                    Watch this.

      Brody does a back flip -- glides past Sam. 

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Not bad for a newbie. Whadya say, 
                    Kendrick? I d give it a six.

      INT. ASTRO-PHYSICS LAB - CONTINUOUS (INTERCUT AS NECESSARY)

                                  KENDRICK
                    I give it an 8.5. Ok guys -- I 
                    gotta get you out before the team 
                    gets back from break. They need it 
                    for simulations.

      Brody and Sam float over to the door. Kendrick depressurizes 
      the chamber. They exit into the room.

                                  BRODY
                    That was amazing.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Never gets old.

                                  KENDRICK
                          (to Brody)
                    Give yourself a sec to get back 
                    your sea legs.

      Brody crosses to get his I-Pod contraption.

                                  KENDRICK (CONT'D)
                    What s that?

                                  BRODY
                    It s an experiment I m working on -- 
                    the rate sound waves travel and 
                    being able to track them.

      Kendrick pulls up a file from the server.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   43.  


                                  KENDRICK
                    This is what I ve been working on 
                    for the last few months: an 
                      eavesdropping device.

                                  BRODY
                    You mean like a bug?

                                  KENDRICK
                    More like a reverse bug. It picks 
                    up if anyone s using your frequency 
                    so you can know if their listening.

                                  BRODY
                    Sweet.

                                  KENDRICK
                    It works by uploading the sound 
                    waves into a tracking device that 
                    bounces it off the nearest 
                    satellite to find the closest 
                    match.

                                  BRODY 
                    So, in theory, if you were to track 
                    the specific sound wave of 
                    someone s voice, you could figure 
                    out their location?

                                  KENDRICK
                    Exactly. Here I can add upload the 
                    voice patterns of your parents.

      Kendrick accesses old tracks of Claire and Matt. We hear 
      their voices crackle over the attached device.

      ON KENDRICK S MONITOR. A BLIP comes on screen indicating 
      Claire s and Matt s location within Jensen HQ.

                                  BRODY
                    That s so cool.

                                  KENDRICK
                    And it s ninety-nine percent 
                    accurate. Unless, of course, the 
                    voice you re tracking is in heavy 
                    concrete or there s poor cell 
                      reception.

                    I need you down in HQ.

      INT. ASTRO-PHYSICS LAB - DAY  

      Kendrick hears the comm and pages her back.

                                  KENDRICK
                    Be right there.
                          (to Sam and Brody)
                    Make ya a deal: promise not to 
                      completely hack my system while I m 
                    gone and I ll leave the 
                      eavesdropper up and running.
                          (smiling)
                    I don t want you two creating the 
                    next gen before I get the kinks 
                    worked out of this one.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Okay. We promise to fix this one 
                    first, then make the next gen. 

      Kendrick laughs as he gets up and walks towards the door.

      INT. JENSEN HEADQUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

      Ingrid, Ginny, Matt, Kendrick and a few department heads 
      listen as Ginny explains.  

                                  GINNY
                    Got footage of the break that took 
                    place last night at the Highland 
                      Laboratories.

      Ginny pulls up the footage, punches in on a SHADOWY FIGURE.

                                  INGRID
                    Look at the profile. It s Edwin. 

                                  KENDRICK
                    I ll start tapping into security 
                    feeds at airports and the major 
                    boarder crossings.

                                  INGRID
                    Perfect.

      Kendrick flips into action.

                                  GINNY
                    Oooh, we can use the bio-passport.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   45.  


                                  MATT
                    To track Edwin?

                                  GINNY
                    Yes -- everything -- people, cars, 
                    machinery -- leaves a...

                                  CLAIRE
                    Carbon footprint?

                                  GINNY
                    Kinda but not really. Think 
                    chemical trail. I can mod the bio-
                    passport tech I developed on the 
                    Nicaragua dig to back-trace the 
                    molecular assembler.

                                  KENDRICK
                    And if you use Montreal's mass 
                    transit system--

                                  GINNY
                      Exact-a-mundo.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Mind taking that out of short-hand?

                                  KENDRICK
                    After Nine-Eleven, every major city 
                    installed chemical detectors in 
                    their public transit systems to 
                    pick up trace elements like anthrax 
                    and other materials.  

                                  GINNY
                    Combine that with the bio-passport 
                    and you can follow a chemical 
                    trail. Sooo...drum roll, what am I 
                    lookin  for?

                                  CLAIRE

                                  GINNY
                    I need something else to mix in 
                    this juju cocktail.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Solvents. Molecular assemblers use

                                  GINNY
                    Whoa, whoa whoa, you said gold?              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   46.

                    Gold is used as a conductor.

                                  GINNY
                    All I need. So I m looking for a 
                      bread-crumb trail of gold and 
                    silicon.
                          (beat)
                    There s a California joke in there

      Team gets to work. 

      INT. EDWIN S LAB - DAY  

      Edwin enters, box in hand, looking frayed. Cho follows. 

                                  CHO 
                    Status?

                                  EDWIN
                    You want a progress report? I just 
                    got off a three hour flight after 
                    stealing a piece of very expensive 
                    equipment from a lab that used to 
                    respect me. That s the status.

      Cho stares blankly, unimpressed.

                                  EDWIN (CONT'D)
                    Look. This is an extraordinarily 
                    sensitive piece of equipment. One 
                    spec of dust could ruin the 
                      calibration completely. I have to 
                    get it into a clean room and run 
                    some tests before I can tell you 
                    anything. 

      There s a tense beat as Cho considers Edwin. Finally, Cho 
      walks away without so much as a raised eyebrow. 

      OFF Edwin. 

      INT. ASTRO-PHYSICS LAB - DAY  

      Sam and Brody jigger with the Eavesdropping Device.

                                  BRODY
                    Boring.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    So if this device can find anyone, 
                    why aren t we looking for Edwin?

                                  BRODY
                    You mean besides the fact we would 
                    need a good voice sample -

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Have plenty of those.

                                  BRODY
                    And the fact it will take forever 
                    to bounce it off every satellite  
                    in the universe since we don t know

                    Not feelin  it. How bout another

                                  SAMANTHA
                    I d rather help them find Edwin.  

                                  BRODY
                    We ll just be here, listening to 
                    static. 

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Sounds like quality  Nitro  time if 
                    you ask me.

                                  BRODY
                    Fine. Pull up an audio sample of 
                    Edwin s voice and I ll load it into 
                    the tracker. 

      She hops in to Kendrick s work station and starts typing.

      Ingrid watches nervously as the team works away. In walks 
      Neeva. She hands Ingrid a mug of tea.

                                  NEEVA
                    A warm spot of tea. To calm your

                          (takes a sip)
                    I can t help but think that none of 
                    this would have happened had I 
                    listened to you sooner.

                                  NEEVA

                                  KENDRICK
                    Got something.

      Kendrick dials in on a bit of info scrawling across the glass 
      monitor. Punches in on the text as the whole team gathers.

      INT. EDWIN S LAB - DAY    

      TIGHT on Edwin s face, focused. 

      PULL OUT to reveal Edwin, in a white Hazmat-like suit, behind 
      the glass encased, sterile environment of a CLEAN ROOM. 

        ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT permeates the room.

      Edwin stands over the molecular assembler, gloved hands 
      holding the CIRCUIT BOARD (which looks like a golden-hued 
      rectangular CD).

      A HAND enters the frame and knocks on the glass. 

      INSIDE THE CLEAN ROOM: 

      Edwin looks up. Sees it s Cho. Shakes his head  no,  and 
      mouths  not now,  before looking back down at circuit board.

      OUTSIDE THE CLEAN ROOM: 

      Annoyed, Cho raps on glass again.

      INSIDE THE CLEAN ROOM: 

      Frustrated, Edwin exits to the air-locked ANTE-ROOM. He 
      quickly disrobes and crosses into the lab.

                                  EDWIN
                    What?

                    know if it works yet.

                                  CHO
                    How long until you do?

                                  EDWIN
                    Can t say. But I do know that it 
                    will be thirty minutes longer now 
                    that I have to decontaminate, suit 
                    up and start the process all over

                    I know you never worked corporate 
                      before...but deadlines matter. And 
                    I m here to make sure the investors 
                    get their return.  

      OFF Edwin, feeling the pressure. 

      INT. JENSEN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

                    Then why--

      Suddenly, the LIGHTS FLICKER.

      SFX: An alarm blares.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    What s that?

      INT. JENSEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

      Alarms blare as Ginny, Neeva, Ingrid, Kendrick and other 
      department heads look around confused. 

                                  INGRID
                          (realizes)
                    It s a lock down.

      Suddenly, the glass doors slide shut locking them in.

                                  INGRID (CONT D)
                    Everybody back up what you re 
                    working on!

      The team scrambles into action. Off the chaos and confusion.

      INT. JENSEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

      The team scrambles to make sense of it all.

                          (to Ingrid)
                    There s been a security breach.

                    Everybody can I have your 
                      attention.

      Everybody stops what they re doing and looks at her.

                                  INGRID (CONT D)
                    Our network s been compromised. 
                    Jensen protocol dictates that it go 
                    into self protect mode, meaning no 
                    outgoing or incoming communication. 
                    This is serious. If the system s 
                    been corrupted, we could lose 
                      everything.

      INT. ASTRO-PHYSICS LAB - NIGHT 

      Sam and Brody listen to Ingrid over the Emergency Intercomm.

                    And report anything out of the 
                    ordinary.

      Sam tries to comm Ingrid but...

                                  SAMANTHA
                    I can t get through. Something s 
                    not right.

                                  BRODY.
                    She just said no incoming or 
                    outgoing communication.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    But we should still be able to 
                      communicate internally.

      Sam comms again. Still nothing.               THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   60.

                    blocked.

      She gets up, crosses to the door -- it won t open.

                    What s going on?

                          (looks up)
                    What about the vents. Can we climb 
                    through them?

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Takes too long. I got a better 
                    idea.

      Sam picks up a chair and hurls it through the glass door. The 
      GLASS SHATTERS. Sam and Brody climb through.

      INT. EDWIN S LAB - NIGHT  

      Edwin at the lab. BUD is secured to a table and has been 
      injected with a nanobot. 

      Edwin monitors his vitals on the computer screen.

                    How does it work?

                                  EDWIN
                    Right now I m regulating his blood 
                    pressure and sugar levels.
                          (to Bud)
                    You have diabetes don t you.

                                  BUD
                    Yeah. Type two.

                                  EDWIN
                    With a few keystrokes, I can 
                    regulate his blood sugar level. And 
                    in the case of an emergency, I 
                    could raise his insulin to prevent 
                    him from going into diabetic shock.

      Cho nods understanding.

                                  CHO
                    Let s see it in action. Been a 
                    rough day huh, Bud? 
                          (to Edwin)
                                  (MORE)              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   61.

                    How bout giving him a shot of 
                      serotonin. Mellow him out.

                                  EDWIN
                    I can do that.

      And with the swipe of a few keystrokes, Edwin raises Bud s 
      serotonin levels. Bud s visibly relaxes.

                                  EDWIN (CONT D)
                          (to Bud)
                    How do yo feel?

                                  BUD
                    Like I m floating.

                                  EDWIN
                          (proudly)
                    It works.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Matt, Claire and the team follow the chemical path of the 
      molecular assembler down a darkened hallway, up to a doorway. 

                                  SECURITY TEAM LEADER
                    Okay, we re here.  
                          (to Matt & Claire)
                    We re going in first. You follow 
                    right behind us since you know what 
                    we re looking for.

                                  CLAIRE
                    It s a molecular assembler.  I ll 
                    know it when I see it.

                                  SECURITY TEAM LEADER
                    Once you spot it -- say so.  If 
                    there s gun fire, just keep your 
                    head down.

      The team leader gives the signal, Matt & Claire brace for the 
      worst and the team blows the door open! It s a blast of 
      shouting and smoke. 

      INt. LABORATORY - NIGHT

      Matt and Claire follow the last security team member into the 
      doorway and find themselves in an EMPTY ROOM. 

      Off their confused faces.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   62.  


      INT. LODGE - NIGHT

      Sam and Brody navigate the building lockdown. Quick cuts 
      reveal:

      --They crawl in an old DUMBWAITER. It s tight.  

      --Lower themselves down, pushed up against each other. SAM: 
      Ouch. Brody: Awkward.

      --Sam levels the dumbwaiter, raises the door, revealing...

      INT. LODGE BOWELS - NIGHT

      They re in the beast of the belly. It s creepy and dark. 

      Sam and Brody switch on FLASH LIGHTS that cut through the 
      bowels of this old lodge. They make their way down a hall.

                                  BRODY
                    Where are we?

                                  SAMANTHA
                    The basement. These tunnels--

                            corridors)
                    Are old servant passages for the 
                    lodge. Made it quicker to get 
                    around.

                                  BRODY
                    I don t understand how the chemical 
                    trail led my parents one way, and 
                    now the voice tracker tells us 
                    somewhere completely different.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    The point is we know where Edwin is 
                    even if they don t.


                                                                            CUT TO:

      Edwin presses a key. Bud s levels spike on-screen. Then he 
      visibly shakes off the rush.

                                  BUD
                    Whoa. Got chills.

                                  EDWIN
                    Seen enough?

                                  CHO
                    Can you speed up his heart rate?

                    But--

      Cho shoots him a look. Edwin presses the button again.

                                  CHO 
                    Can you make it go any faster?

                                  EDWIN
                    Any faster and his heart could 
                    explode.

                                  BUD
                    Boss--

                          (looks at keyboard)
                    This one right?

      Edwin lunges to stop Cho, but is restrained by a pair of 
      henchmen. Cho pushes the button. Bud braces himself. 

                                  EDWIN
                    Stop! You ll send him into cardiac

      Bud shudders and starts to shake.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   64.  


      ON-SCREEN: His heart rate spikes to a dangerous level.

      The entire lab (techs, researchers) falls quiet as they watch 
      in horror. Then finally, Cho stops. Laughs.  

                                  CHO
                    Just making sure everything s up to

      Edwin quickly decelerates Bud s heartbeat.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    We can t get to Ingrid, and we 
                    don t know how long Edwin will be 
                    at his current location.  If we 
                    don t go now then we might lose 
                    him. 
                          (Beat) 
                    Get in.

                                  BRODY
                    The plane?              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   66.  


      Sam nods working up the controls. Brody stands there frozen.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    This is not a good idea. Mom would 
                      definitely flog me for doing this.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Get in or jump off, but I have to 
                    go. Time is wasting and we ve got 
                    to stop Edwin!

                                  BRODY
                    (under his breath, weighs options)
                    Follow the pretty girl. Obey mom. 
                    Follow the pretty girl. Obey mom. 
                    Pretty girl, mom, pretty girl, mom.

      Then in SLO-MO (MOS):

      Brody looks up at Sam under the canopy of night s stars -- 
      the wind blows through her hair as she fiddles with the 
      craft s controls. 

      Sam shouts at Brody but he doesn t hear because he s so taken 
      with her. 

      Finally, Sam slaps Brody on the side of the head, breaks the 
      moment. 

                                  SAMANTHA
                    You comin  or what?

                                  BRODY
                          (to Sam)
                      Definitely.

      EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

      Brody climbs in, Sam fires up the engine.

      We see the CESSNA taxi for a brief moment then take off down 
      the runway.  

      INT. ULTRA MODERN CESSNA - CONTINUOUS

      Sam mans the controls. Brody straps himself in.   

                                  BRODY 
                    You sure you know how to fly this 
                    thing?

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Yeah, well...kind of.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   67.  


                                  BRODY
                    Kind of?! 

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Hold on!

      Before Brody can say anything the jolt from lift off jerks 
      his head back. Off his scream!

      EXT. RUNWAY-NIGHT

      The cessna jerks up then -- takes off. It s tiny lights 
      illuminate the blackened sky.      


                                  END OF ACT SIX              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   68.

                                  BRODY
                    The title  Captain  implies you 
                    know how to fly.

                    You look a little green.

                                  BRODY
                    You would too if you were taken 
                    hostage in a hijacked plane.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    It s Jensen property, I m a Jensen 
                    employee and we re  borrowing  it

                    I m so dead.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Not if we stop Edwin, get back the 
                    molecular assembler, and save the 
                    day. You ll go from juvenile 
                      delinquent to hero in one night.

                    Take-off is the tricky part.

                    What about landing?

                    How many flight lessons have you 
                    taken?

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Seven. But lucky for you I m a 
                    natural.

      Brody ducks out of frame.

      SFX: We hear Brody vomit.

      EXT. EDWIN S LAB - NIGHT

      Sam and Brody step up to the alarm panel.

                                  SAM
                    I got this...

      Sam pulls out a multi-tool and pulls the numbered alarm panel 
      off the wall.  She starts manipulating the wires.

                                  BRODY
                    You know what you re doing?

                    Hold the yellow wire, and tug on 
                    these two.  DO NOT let them touch 
                    the dotted wire.

      Brody squints to see which one is what in the moonlight.  Sam 
      has pulled out a circuitboard and is rewiring at lightning 
      pace.

                                  SAM (CONT D)
                    Okay - now slide over the blue 
                    wire.  (Brody squints and tries to 
                    push it over)  No, the BLUE wire. 
                    (Beat)  Okay, try to hold still...              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   72.  


      Sam twists two wires and BOOM!  Sparks fly everywhere as the 
      main door hisses open.  

      INT. EDWIN S LAB HALLWAY - NIGHT

      QUICK CUTTY MONTAGE:

      They creep up a staircase, look around -- a Henchman walks 
      out, almost sees them -- Sam and Brody race down the hall. 

      Sam and Brody peek around a corner. Sam sees someone coming 
      and pulls Brody into a janitor s closet.

      SAM S POV: Henchman walks by.

      INT. JANITOR S CLOSET - NIGHT 

      Sam peeps out. Brody tries to remain calm but Sam s so close 
      he breathes in her scent -- then before he can stop it -- he 
      sneezes. Sam closes the door, turns to him.

                                  SAM
                    What are you doing?

                                  BRODY

                    Gross. Stop being such a dork.  

      Sam creaks open the door.

                    Come on.

      INT. LAB HALLWAY - DAY  

      Sam and Brody sneak up to the lab doors -- glance in. Sam 
      sees Edwin, various members of the team from Jensen and then 
      she spots the molecular assembler.

                                  SAMANTHA
                          (whispers)
                    I see it.

                                  BRODY
                    But there s a room full of people? 
                    How do we even get to it -- let 
                    alone get it?

      Sam inches the door closed. Thinks for a beat --              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   73.

      A  fire alarm  on the wall across from them.

      OFF SAM 

      An idea hatches.

      Edwin looks up -- confused as do the other techs.

      INT. JANITOR S CLOSET - NIGHT  

      Sam peeks out, Brody peers over her shoulder. They see the 
      techs file out.

      INT. LABORATORY - MOMENTS LATER

      Sam and Brody race in. Brody points out the assembler.

                                  BRODY
                    Found it.

      Brody picks it up.

      Two Henchmen sneak up and grab Sam.  

      Brody sets down the assembler and jumps into the fray -- he 
      tackles one henchman right off her, landing a few quick jabs 
      right as they both hit the ground.  Sam seizes the 
      opportunity and is able judo her away out of Henchman 2 s 
      grip - sealing her escape with a kick to his knee. 

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    Sam -- go!

      Sam snatches up assembler and races off as Brody is subdued 
      by the henchmen.

                                  BRODY (CONT D)
                    Let me go!

      Cho and Edwin enter.

      INT. JENSEN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 

      Kendrick runs through his security checklist. Sees something 
      on screen that concerns him.

                                  KENDRICK
                          (to Ingrid)
                    I ran all the safety parameters -- 
                    Still can t put my finger on what 
                    triggered the lockdown.

                                  INGRID

                                  KENDRICK
                    Yes -- but none of the usual 
                    triggers set it off.

                                  INGRID
                    It s not just an anomaly -- I need 
                    you to get to the bottom of what 
                    happened and why.

                          (nods)
                    Will do. 

      Kendrick crosses back to his area. Matt and Claire cross the 
      threshold into HQ. Their vital signs pop up on screen.

                                  INGRID
                    Thank goodness you re back.

                                  MATT
                    Just wish it hadn t been on a wild 
                    goose chase.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Any news?

                                  GINNY
                      I rechecked the data. There were

                    This is weird.

                                  MATT
                    What?

                                  CLAIRE
                    The levels are almost double the 
                    amount used in the assembler.

                                  MATT
                    Maybe they had two.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Or maybe someone laid the trail on

                    Not sure.

      Kendrick pulls up surveillance feeds from around the complex. 
      We punch in on the various departments.

                                  KENDRICK (CONT D)
                    Maybe they re in Sam s cube.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Can you check the surveillance 
                    feed?

                                  KENDRICK
                    Isn t one. That s her personal 
                    quarters.

                                  MATT
                    They re probably just playing video 
                    games. Or  bonding. 

                                  CLAIRE

      Sam races back to the Cessna. She places the assembler inside

      Ingrid puts the call on speaker -- the team listens, 
      concerned.

                      Kendrick s eavesdropping device 
                    picked up a signal on Edwin. But it

                    Is Brody with you?

                    That s what I m trying to tell you.  
                    These guards grabbed me. Brody 
                    jumped in so I could get away --

                                  CLAIRE
                    He had to go running off...

      INT. JENSEN HEADQUARTERS - MORNING  

      Kendrick pulls Ingrid aside, out of earshot of everyone in 
      the buzzing main room.

                                  KENDRICK
                    Found something. The lockdown was 
                    triggered from the inside.

                                  INGRID
                    Why is that news?

                                  KENDRICK
                    Meaning there was no external 
                    threat. No one was trying to hack 
                    into our system. There was no 
                    security breach and it wasn t 
                    Edwin.

                                  INGRID
                    Bottom line this for me.

                                  KENDRICK
                    Only someone on the inside could 
                    have set this off. Why? I don t 
                    know but one of our own--

                    Figure out who it was and report 
                    only to me.

      Kendrick nods. They look around the room at the immediate 
      staff and then their eyes wander to the security feeds of the 
      various departments -- hundreds of techs, apprentices and 
      department heads milling about. Everyone s a suspect.

      Claire and Matt re-enter the room.

                                  MATT 
                    And there s no way to know how

                                  BRODY
                    Maybe there s a way to flush it 
                    out.

                    What have you done to my son?

                          (over speakerphone)
                    I d say congratulations are in 
                    order. It was your prototype that 
                    paved the way for this micromachine 
                    that now controls the very 
                    heartbeat of your son.

                                  INGRID
                    Edwin, please. If this is about--

                    I have nothing to say to you 
                    Ingrid. Claire, you and I both know 
                    what I m capable of doing with just 
                    the click of a button.

                                  CLAIRE
                    What do you want?

                                  EDWIN
                    It s simple. Return what you ve 
                    stolen or you ll leave me no 
                    choice.

      Claire locks eyes with Matt and Brody. The implications are 
      clear.    

      INT. CHO S OFFICE - DAY  

      Edwin disconnects. Looks to Cho.

                                  CHO
                    You think it ll work?

                                  EDWIN
                    One thing I m certain of -- Claire 
                      Montgomery will choose her child 
                    over all else. Always.

      INT. JENSEN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

      Ingrid, Claire, Matt and the team. Kendrick types in a few 
      commands -- 

      ON SCREEN

      We punch in on the NANOBOT and it s intricate parts, then 
      pull back a bit and see the rhythmic beating of Brody s heart              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   84.

                    It s linked with his blood vessels.

                                  CLAIRE
                    There must be a way to unlink it--

                                  KENDRICK
                    Won t that provoke a response?

      ACROSS THE ROOM -- SAM AND BRODY 

      Brody can t take his eyes off the screen.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Does it feel weird?

                                  BRODY
                    Honestly -- I didn t know it was in 
                    me until now.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Well, look at the bright side -- 

                                  BRODY
                    There s a bright side to all this?

                          (nods)
                    Once your mom takes control of the 
                    nanobot, she could fix just about 
                    anything wrong with you...

                                  BRODY
                    Even acne?

                                  SAMANTHA
                    Even acne. Or premature balding. Or 
                    halitosis or B.O.

                                  BRODY
                            (self-conscious)
                    And you re telling me this 
                      because...

                                  SAMANTHA 
                    If the nanobot was around just two 
                    years ago -- maybe it could have 
                    saved my mom.

      Brody doesn t know what to say. A beat, then, he grabs Sam 
      and pulls her away.

                                  BRODY 
                    Maybe we can find the answer.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   85.

                    Don t go too far.

                                  BRODY (O.S.)
                    Okay.

                                  MATT
                    It s better that he s not here 
                    while we discuss options.

                                  CLAIRE
                    We should just give him back the 
                      assembler.

      Silence.

                                  GINNY
                    Um, hello...don t want to spout the 
                    obvious, but do you want Edwin 
                    making more nanobots with that 
                    assembler and Mister Deep Pockets? 
                    We ve already seen that they re 
                    willing to kill.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Yes -- and it s my son.

                                  NEEVA
                    How can you ask her to risk her own 
                    son s life?

                                  CLAIRE
                    I can t even believe we re even 
                    having this discussion.

      Claire stomps out.

      INT. EDWIN S OLD OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 

      Claire enters. Looks through Edwin s files. She dumps them on 
      the floor, searching for anything that might help her.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (over comm)
                    Kendrick - I need you to pull up 
                    every video file you have on the 
                    server related to N.E.D and Edwin.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   86.  


                                  KENDRICK
                          (over comm)
                    Coming to you now.  You ll see it 
                    on Edwin s computer.

      Thumbnails of quicktime files start spooling up on the 
      computer screen at Edwin s station.

      She scans the labels on the videos until her eyes land on: 
       C. Montgomery Research Presentation - A/V set to record 7/19 
      @ 1100. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    1995...My NED presentation...


      Claire accesses the file. Pulls it up and plays it. 

      ON MONITOR

      It s a digital copy of a  noisy  video. Almost unwatchable.

      CLAIRE scans through it. It clears partway through. She 
      returns to the beginning to see where the watchability 
      starts.

      ON MONITOR

      Before her presentation ever started. A MAN apppears on-
      screen. Sneaks into the empty room. The person moves like --

      EDWIN. He crosses to her MACRO-NANOBOT MODEL, N.E.D., leans 
      in and twists something off. Steals away out of view.

      Claire replays it. Freezes it. She sits back to contemplate. 
      Plays it again.  Ingrid enters.

      In silence, Ingrid and Claire watch the footage replay.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    This was my prototype presentation. 
                    The macro model of the nanobot. 

      ON SCREEN: They see Edwin doing something to the model.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                          (realizes)
                    He sabotaged it.

                                  INGRID
                    Why would he do that?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Who knows.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   87.  


      Claire freezes the picture with Edwin s hand on the model.

                                  CLAIRE (CONT D)
                    But see here? He s disabling the 
                    ciliary mechanism that controls 
                    mobility.

                                  INGRID
                    Which was crucial for green-
                    lighting it to the next phase of 
                    testing. 

                                  CLAIRE
                          (nods)
                    If it can t move, it can t 
                    function.
                          (beat)
                    That s why you tabled my research.

      Claire closes the video window.

                                  INGRID
                    And I didn t give you the 
                      additional time you asked to fix it-
                          (beat, realizes)
                    based on Edwin s recommendation. 
                    I had no idea he was so spiteful. 

                                  CLAIRE
                    I don t really have time to go down 
                    memory lane with you right now, 
                    Ingrid.  My son is scared and - 

                                  INGRID
                    I m sorry, Claire. I should have 
                    known. I should have stood by you.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (accepts the apology)
                    I better get back to work.

      INT. JENSEN HEADQUARTERS - DAY  

      The gang at their stations working on the Brody problem. 
      Neeva pulls up surveillance of Brody and Sam. 

      At Kendrick s approach, she discreetly clicks off the feed.

                                  KENDRICK
                    Can you run this down to Claire? 
                    I m in the middle of something for

                    Send her a digital file. I m in the 
                    middle of my own project.

                                  KENDRICK
                    She asked for a hard copy. And you 
                    know she only trusts us with 
                    sensitive info -- or else I d give 
                    it to an apprentice.

                                  NEEVA
                    All right. I ll take care of it.

      Kendrick watches Neeva leave -- then crosses back to her 
        workstation, types in a few commands.

      INT. EDWIN S OLD OFFICE - DAY  

      Matt and Claire work on nanobot simulations.

                                  MATT
                    The algorithms don t match.

                                  CLAIRE
                    It won t move out of the heart.

                                  MATT
                    Maybe Edwin s files have a 
                    solution. He fixed what was wrong 
                    with your prototype. Obviously it 
                    moves now.

                                  CLAIRE
                    That s because it was never broken.
                          (off his look)
                    Edwin sabotaged the model just 
                    before my presentation. Saw it on a 
                      a recording earlier.

                                  MATT
                    Why would he do that?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Don t know. But I ve spent the last 
                    fifteen years thinking I was a 
                    failure. I built my life on a lie.

      Matt pulls Claire close. 

                                  MATT
                    Brody s not a lie. I m not a lie. 
                    And you re the smartest person I

                          (lightbulb)
                    Maybe we could make him pee it out.

      Matt pulls back. Catches on to her train of thought.

                                  MATT
                    Won t work. Neither will dialysis

                                  CLAIRE
                    Could work. If we got some 
                      immunoglobulin A to bind to it. 
                    That should paralyze the ciliary 
                      mechanism.

                                  MATT
                    I m sure Edwin s invented a module 
                    that neutralizes antibodies.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Probably.  But the lungs are a 
                    closer source of I.G.A. than the 
                      intestines. What happens if we send 
                    the nanobot there?


                                  MATT
                    He could cough it out.  
                      Theoretically.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    Side effects, complications?

                                  MATT
                    Both.  Yes.  It might be too 
                      dangerous.


      Neeva enters.

                                  NEEVA
                    Kendrick said you needed this.


      Hands Claire the document. Claire glances at it.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   90.

                           (to Matt)
                    It s the polarity study.

      He takes it, starts reading the document.

      ON EDWIN S MONITOR

      Neeva sees a feed of Sam and Brody.

                                  NEEVA 
                    How s he holding up?

                                  CLAIRE
                    He s a strong kid.

                                  NEEVA
                    They can be so resilient.

      Neeva glances at the HQ feed. Sees Kendrick at her 
        workstation. 

                                  NEEVA (CONT'D)
                    I ve got to get back.

                                  CLAIRE
                           (re: document)
                    Thanks.

      Neeva quickly exits.

      INT. JENSEN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

      Kendrick at Neeva s workstation. Ginny sweeps past.

                                  GINNY
                    You know what s so weird about all 
                    this?
                          (doesn t wait an answer)
                    Edwin was a pioneer in 
                      nanotechnology and now he s using 
                    one of his very own creations to 
                      booby-trap the son of his former 
                    protege. Talk about psycho.

                                  KENDRICK
                    Stranger things have happened.

      Ingrid sweeps past. Kendrick matches pace. Ginny follows.

                                  KENDRICK (CONT D)
                          (to Ingrid)
                    I have some information you re not 
                    going to like.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   91.  


                                  INGRID
                    What?

                                  KENDRICK
                    Neeva triggered the lockdown.

                                  INGRID
                    Why would she do that?

                                  KENDRICK
                    Break communication. Matt and 
                    Claire were outside the campus at 
                    the time. 

                                  GINNY
                          (pops into convo)
                    Neeva must be working with Edwin. 
                    Why else would there be a false 
                    chemical trail? If Neeva gave him a 
                    heads up him, there would have been 
                    ample time to lay one before our 
                    sweep.

                                  KENDRICK
                    Which fits with the higher levels 
                    of gold and silicon -- 

                                  GINNY
                    Exactly. They didn t want us to 
                    miss it. That way Edwin was able to 
                    throw us off his scent.

                                  INGRID
                    Are you certain?

                                  KENDRICK
                          (nods)
                    The code used to trigger the 
                    lockdown is the same one Neeva just 
                    used to pull up surveillance cams 
                    at that work station.

                                  INGRID
                    Where is she now?

      Kendrick looks up just in time to see Neeva s vital signs on 
      the main screen. He turns just as Neeva races out the room.

                                  KENDRICK
                    Neeva!

      Kendrick gives chase.               THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   92.

      INT. JENSEN HALLWAY - DAY  

      We pick up right where we left off. Kendrick pops out of HQ-- 
      spots Neeva sprinting. 

      He races after her, techs and apprentices dodging out of the 
      way. 

      EXT. JENSEN MAIN LODGE - DAY

      Neeva exits, runs toward the parking lot. 

      EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

      Neeva aims her car remote. Her BMW roars to life.

      Kendrick hits the lot just as Neeva dives into her car. 

      Kendrick jumps in her car s path to block her -- 

                                  KENDRICK
                    Neeva -- wait!

      But Neeva steps on the gas. Kendrick darts out of the way at 
      the last minute. She s gone. Off Kendrick.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Neeva cruises down the highway. Eyes the rearview often to 
      make sure she s not followed. Triggers her bluetooth. Dials.

                    I don t know what to tell you...My 
                    hands are tied.

      His CELL RINGS. Mouths  Neeva  to Cho.

                          (into phone)
                    Hello?

                                  NEEVA
                    I had to leave.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   94.  


                                  EDWIN
                    But I need you inside.

                                  NEEVA
                    Kendrick figured it out -- it was 
                    only a matter a time.

      Edwin clicks off annoyed. We see his mounting anger.

      INT. JENSEN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

      Kendrick sits surrounded by Ginny, Matt, Claire and Ingrid.

                                  KENDRICK
                    How could we have not seen that 
                    coming?

                                  INGRID
                    I always trusted her -- and Edwin. 
                    Guess I didn t know them very well.

                                  GINNY
                    She had the perfect cover -- 
                    sitting on her moral high horse. 

                                  INGRID
                    Publicly, Edwin despised her. 
                    Pretty good act.

                                  GINNY
                    And all this time she was spying on 
                    us. The ethical ethicist.

                                  CLAIRE
                    It s Edwin.

      She slides the phone into the speakerphone.

                                  EDWIN
                    You can t beat me, Claire. 

                                  CLAIRE

                                  INGRID
                    It s not too late, Edwin. Come 
                    back. We ll find a way to work 
                    through this.

                                  EDWIN
                    My dear sister. You see only what 
                    you want to see -- and that s the 
                    best in everyone. But what you fail 
                    to grasp is that not everyone s 
                    like you. Some people want credit 
                    for their efforts.

                                  CLAIRE
                    Then why don t you take credit for 
                      sabotaging my presentation and 
                    stealing my research. I know the 
                    truth now. And so does everyone 
                    else.

      Sam and Brody try to figure out how to disable the nanobot.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    We could deactivate it. Then it 
                    would detach. That s if we can get 
                    the mobility module working

                                  BRODY
                    But in order to do that we need to 
                    know how he s controlling it.

                                  SAMANTHA 
                    It s probably an app on his phone.

                                  BRODY
                    But he might have developed the app 
                    on his computer--
                          (pointing toward lodge)
                    -- and that s in his office.

                                  SAMANTHA
                    No. It would be on his computer at 
                    his new place.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   96.

                          (re: nanobot)
                    What about a using a latch method 
                    to remove it?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Too dangerous.

                                  GINNY
                    I wish we could, like, press 
                     pause  and rewind this day. And 
                    then, like, totally erase it.

      Claire looks over to her.

                                  CLAIRE
                          (to Ginny)
                    What did you just say?

                                  GINNY
                    I have no idea. It just comes out.  
                    Like verbal vomit -- I have no 
                    control over it.  

                                  CLAIRE
                    No. You said hit pause -- maybe 
                    there is a way to  pause  the 
                    program.

                                  MATT
                    Like temporarily block the signal 
                    that Edwin s using to control the 
                    nanobot?

                                  CLAIRE
                    Exactly -- 

      Sam and Brody burst in.

                                  BRODY
                    Mom -- I think he s using a phone 
                    app to control the nanobots.

      Possible. Ginny and Matt look at each other.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   97.

                    We need to get into his place to 
                    see if the software is on his 
                    computer. If it is, I can take care 
                    of it.

                                  GINNY
                    Good luck with that.

                                  CLAIRE
                    If your theory s correct, Edwin can 
                    still control you remotely with his 
                    phone. We ve been working on a way 
                    to jam his signal. 

                                  MATT

                    Of course.

      Claire pats the Cessna. Sam closes the hatch. Starts up the

                    be moving locations since Brody and 
                    Sam found them.  We don t have much 
                    time.

                                  BRODY
                    Good thing for them -- cause I ve 
                    learned a few moves since our last

      Suddenly, Matt turns, knocks the gun from Bud s hand -- it 
      skitters out of reach. 

      Brody jumps on Bud, puts him in a choke hold while Sam pops 
      Bud in the solar plex. He goes down, gasping for air. 

      Matt grabs the gun. And now the tables have turned.

      the move. They look around for Edwin s computer. 

                                  SAMANTHA
                    I saw him working on it before.

                                  MATT
                    Where?

                                  BRODY
                          (spots across the room)
                    There it is!

      Brody races over to a SLEEK LAPTOP. It s the same one we saw 
      Edwin use to control Bud s nanobot.

      EXT. CHINESE GARDEN - DAY 

      Edwin stares at his old protege. Appraising her, then snorts 
      derisively, as though she somehow, she fails to meet his 
      approval, then reaches for the bag....

                                  EDWIN
                    Give it to me.

      She doesn t move, holding his eyes with an unwavering glare.              THE SEVEN                               1/19/10   106.

                    How will I know if you ve disabled 
                    the nanobot?

      Edwin s tone is condescending.

                                  EDWIN
                    Don t waste my time, Claire. You re 
                    obviously monitoring your son s 
                    vital functions. After I ve 
                    inspected the molecular assembler, 
                    I ll send a signal...

      He holds up his cell in a gloved hand.

                                  EDWIN (CONT D)

                      husband...they ll all see the 
                    nanobot shut down.

      He curls the fingers of his out stretched palm.

                                  EDWIN (CONT D)
                    Now. If you don t mind...

      Claire and Edwin continue to face off.

                    the nanobot once I give you the

      He smiles.

                                  EDWIN
                    Nothing. 

      He studies her.

      Her voice quavers with anger as she interrupts him.

                                  CLAIRE

      She glares at him as she catches her breath. Edwin holds up 
      the cell. His face is crimson but his voice is controlled.

      Brody pulls out the hard drive of Edwin s laptop, trashes it.  

      Sam has the motherboard. She s about to crack it over her 
      knee, then she stops and takes out the RAM chips.
