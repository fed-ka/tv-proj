                                      ACT ONE


1 FADE IN:1

    PANNING CENTRAL PARK NIGHTSCAPE

  as seen through an infrared video camera. The lens gives the trees
  and grass and lamps a surreal aspect -- an orange irradiance. The
  time, measured in milliseconds, pulses in the corner of the frame.
    CAMERA HOLDS on the image of an owl, a lone sentry keeping watch
  over the park...

2 EXT. CENTRAL PARK   NIGHT 2

    A research scientist, EDWARD PIERSON, late fifties, takes his eye
  away from the viewfinder, runs a hand through his wooly
    intellectual hair, and then jots some notes in a ledger. He sits
  in a field chair, a blanket draped over his lap. Beside him, on a
  small fold-up table, is a thermos of coffee and a package of
    Malomars, his private sin, which he now indulges. A van is parked
    adjacent, the two rear doors swung open to reveal an array of
    electronic and photographic equipment inside.

3 ANOTHER ANGLE3

  finds Vincent returning from a foraging run. He carries a large
    canvas sack over his shoulder and moves with caution and skill
    through the shadows.

4 RESUME PIERSON4

  bent forward from the waist to look through the infrared camera.

5 HIS POV - THROUGH INFRARED CAMERA (MATTE) 5

  Along an area of dense foliage. Something large and hulking is
    moving there. CAMERA FOLLOWS the movement, catching various
    glimpses of Vincent s figure through holes in the brush. Then,
    suddenly -- momentously -- a flash of Vincent s tremendous head
  and shoulders... gone as quickly as it appears.                                                                                  2.

6 RESUME PIERSON6

    as he reacts, pulling away from the viewfinder to scan the area
    with his naked eye. Nothing. His hand reaches out for the focus.

7 HIS POV - THROUGH INFRARED CAMERA 7

    ZOOMING in on a section of empty space between branches.
    Vincent s shoulder and torso enter the frame. CAMERA ADJUSTS, and
    for a full second, Vincent s face is captured, staring straight
    at us...

8 RESUME PIERSON8

    who can t believe what he s just seen. He stands quickly and
    hurries in the direction of the sighting. At the top of a small
    rise, he looks down at the drainage duct. But Vincent has already
      disappeared.

                                                                  CUT TO:

9 INT. PIERSON S OFFICE - LAB 9

    Pierson is hunched over a small video monitor, replaying the
      recorded images.

10 INSERT - VIDEO MONITOR 10

    The screen fast forwards, then slows, and finally FREEZES
  on Vincent s face -- distorted, unworldly, more like an X-Ray
    image than a photograph, but unmistakably Vincent.

11 CLOSE ON PIERSON11

      studying the image in wonder. Then, as he leans back in his chair
    and begins to consider the possible explanations, we:

                                                                  CUT TO:
12 INT. MAXWELL S OFFICE - DAY 12

    CATHY stands before Maxwell s desk, while MAXWELL peruses black
    and white photographs of a young woman with a badly bruised face.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  3.

                    There were also cigarette burns
                  on her back...
                            (as concern surfaces
                            through her cool,
                              professional veneer)
                  For God s sake, they've been
                    married for fifteen years.

                                        MAXWELL
                            (nods)
                    I ll have an arrest warrant out
                    before Alberti can put down
                    another six pack.

    Maxwell closes the folder conclusively. Cathy smiles, then
    crosses to the room to leave, and:

                                        MAXWELL
                    Hey, Radcliffe --

    Cathy turns at the door.

                                        MAXWELL
                    Come in for a minute.

                                        CATHY
                    I have a deposition --

                                        MAXWELL
                              (overriding)
                  Hit the pause button for a second,
                    will you?
                            (beat)
                    There s something we need to talk
                    about.

    Cathy closes the door, approaches Maxwell with a quizzical look.
    Maxwell takes an eight-by-ten envelope from the top of a pile on
    his desk, hands it to Cathy.

                                        MAXWELL
                    Just came this morning.

                                        CATHY
                            (reading return address)
                    Providence, Rhode Island...?
                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  4.

                                        MAXWELL
                  The D.A. up there s a friend of
                    Moreno s. He s been looking for
                    someone from outside his office
                  to head up their Domestic Violence
                    Bureau.
                            (re: envelope)
                  Go ahead. Open it.

    The envelope s already been opened. Cathy takes out the letter.
    Peruses it.

                                        CATHY
                    I don t understand...

                                        MAXWELL
                    What s not to understand? You
                  got an impressive record, and
                    Moreno s word is like gold with
                  the guy. He wants you.

    Cathy looks down at the letter again, then up to Maxwell.

                                        MAXWELL
                          -- A week from yesterday.

                                        CATHY
                    A week...
                              (recovering)
                    I don t know what to say.

                                        MAXWELL
                              (facetious)
                  You don t know what to say.

                                        CATHY
                    Well, I m honored and I m
                    flattered, but it s kind of
                    sudden, isn t it?

                                        MAXWELL
                    Yeah, like everything else in
                    life.
                            (he leans forward;
                              persuasive, emphatic)
                  But we re not just talking about
                    a promotion here -- we re talking
                    about a quantum leap in your
                    career. Read the job profile.
                    You ll be coordinating everything
                    from counseling services to court
                    appearances. Right up your alley.

                    salary hike, minimum. Which I
                    know isn t exactly a top priority
                  for you, but...

    He breaks off, shakes his head. Cathy is speechless.

                                        MAXWELL
                    Listen. No one knows better than
                  me how good you've been for this
                    office. But let s be honest:
                    here, you re just another foot
                    soldier, anonymous and underpaid.

                                        CATHY

                    I still need time.

                                        MAXWELL
                    Fine. Only Moreno needs to know
                  by tomorrow.

                                        CATHY

                            (no bullshit)
                    Cathy: you don t say no to this
                    kind of job, because it doesn t
                    come up again. Not like this.
                  And if it does, it won t be for
                    a long time.

    Cathy can t deny Maxwell s conviction. Nor can she deny the
    forces Maxwell can t begin to imagine. On Cathy s torn
      expression, we:

                    celebrating at Trader Vic s over
                    duck l orange  stead of having
                  the great debate over whatever
                    this is...

    CAMERA FINDS CATHY AND EDIE sitting at a small table.

                                        CATHY
                    Edie, it s more complicated than
                    that.

                                        EDIE
                  Is it?

                                        CATHY
                    I just don t want to make the
                    wrong choice. Leaving my father s
                    firm for the D.A. was easy because
                    I knew it was right. I felt it.
                  But this time...

    She breaks off, shakes her head, frustrated.

                                        EDIE
                    Have you made a list yet?

                                        CATHY
                    A list?

                                        EDIE
                    Yeah. You know, take the issue
                  and write out the pros and cons.
                    It s a little trick my therapist
                    taught me.

                                        CATHY
                    Does it work?

                                        EDIE
                  For seventy-five dollars an hour,
                  it better work.

    Cathy laughs -- and Edie is glad to have lightened the moment.
    Then:

                                        EDIE
                  Now, since we both know it s the
                    right career move, we should
                    consider the emotional  
                      slash-romantic side of things.

                    Let s face it, Cathy. For
                    eight-million people, New York
                  is one lonely place. So who
                    knows? Maybe a new city d be good
                  for you. Give you the chance to
                    meet somebody.

    Cathy s eyes react to the truth of this, to the omnipresent,
    invisible influence of Vincent.

                                        CATHY
                            (absently)

                  The last thing I ll be doing
                    tonight is sleeping.

                                      (laughs)
                    I don t think so, Edie.

    Now Cathy regards Edie for a tender moment. Then:

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  8.

                  If I do decide to go, I am really
                    going to miss you.

    Cathy opens her arms, embraces Edie.

                                        EDIE
                    I know it. Who else re you gonna
                  get to do all your work?

    The two women laugh, acknowledging the friendship that has grown
    between them, as we:

                                                                  CUT TO:

14 PROJECTED SLIDE-SHOT OF VINCENT   14

    in Central Park, half-turned -- from Pierson s evening of
      observation.

                                  PIERSON (O.S.)
                    Next please.

    INT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - LECTURE BOWL - DAY

    The lights are out, and Pierson stands before the large screen
    upon which the slide changes. Pierson shields his eyes from the
    bright light, until the next slide drops in -- this one of
    Vincent facing at the camera. (PRODUCTION NOTE: as with the video
    tape from which these have been taken, these blown-up photos of
    Vincent should appear murky -- enough to cause skepticism as to
    their veracity.)

                                        PIERSON
                    This is the best angle.
                      Extraordinary, isn t it?
                                        (beat)
                    Lights, please.

    The lights come up, and we find Pierson addressing three
    colleagues from the Department of Anthropology. They are sitting
    on the ground level of a steep lecture bowl. There s a moment of
    awkward silence. LELAND QUINT, the head of the department, now
    speaks.

                                        QUINT
                  You have something more?

    Pierson is silent. Quint continues sympathetically:

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  9.

                  You can t seriously expect me to
                  go to the Provost with this,
                    Edward. A research team?
                    Funding? For what? Our own Loch
                    Ness monster. I d be laughed out
                  of the office.

                                        PIERSON
                  I m not asking for a grant...

                                        QUINT
                    I know you re not --

                                        PIERSON
                  I m asking for a week, maybe two,
                  at the most, in our own backyard.

    Quint considers this, looking to his colleagues, who don t care
    to venture an opinion. But their disapproval is made apparent by
    their neutral faces. Then:

                                        QUINT
                  I m sorry, Edward...

                                        PIERSON
                  But you saw the evidence.

                    A four-second video clip and some
                    inconclusive enlargements?

                    I was there, Leland. I saw the
                    creature... looked into his eyes.

                                        QUINT
                    You re wasting your time,
                    imagining things...

                  At least I m not blind to them.

    This touches Quint and the others where they are most sensitive.
    Their faces heat. Pierson backs down.

                                        PIERSON
                    Forgive me. I didn t mean that.

                                        QUINT
                              (simmering)
                    You re here largely because this
                    University has chosen to humor
                    you.

                                        PIERSON
                            (quietly; with strength)
                    This University owes me something.

                                        QUINT
                  We owe you nothing. You haven t
                    published in God knows how long.
                    You re still full of self-pity
                    because someone else received the
                    credit for your work twenty-five
                    years ago.

                                        PIERSON
                    Stole the credit...

                    Well I m sorry, Edward. But it s -
                    ancient history.

    Quint stands, and as he and the other professors file out past
      Pierson:

    HIGH SHOT (FROM TOP OF BOWL)

    of Pierson, small and lost at the podium.

15 REVERSE ANGLE - JONATHAN GOULD 15

    31, graduate student, standing on the upper rim of the bowl,
    looking down at the older man through small, round wire-rimmed
      glasses. The intensity of his gaze is alarming.

16 EXT. THRESHOLD TO TUNNEL WORLD   NIGHT 16

    Cathy stands at the iron gate, trying to find some solace in the
    stillness and quiet of the underground. She peers down the
    tunnel. Nothing. Finally, she turns to leave and sees Vincent
    against a far wall, deep in shadow.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  11.

                    Vincent... I thought you weren t
                    coming.

                                        VINCENT
                    I almost didn t...

                            (moving toward him)
                    Vincent...

                                        VINCENT
                    Please. Come no closer.

    She stops and is haloed in a shaft of light. A long beat.

                                        VINCENT
                    You re like an angel... standing
                    there...

    Cathy senses an enormous reticence in Vincent, as if it s too
    painful for him even to look at her.

                                        CATHY
                    I needed to see you.
                                        (beat)
                    I have a decision to make... and
                    I want your help...

    Vincent is silent. Cathy struggles to say what she has come to
    say.

                                        CATHY
                    I've been offered another job,
                    Vincent. With more
                    responsibility. Doing what I was
                    trained to do... helping people
                    more than I m able to now.

    Vincent remains perfectly still.

                                        CATHY
                  But it would mean leaving New
                    York.

    Long beat. Finally;

                                        VINCENT
                  No one can help you decide what
                  you feel...

                                        CATHY
                  You can help.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  12.

                  No, not even me. Part of you is
                    unhappy, Catherine. A part of
                  you I can t reach...

                                        CATHY
                    What should I do?

                    I don t have the answer...

    Vincent motions to leave. Now Cathy intercepts him, holding his
    arm.

                                        CATHY
                    Please, stay!

    Vincent halts, but he won t look at her.

                                        CATHY
                    Vincent...

    He raises his head, and their eyes lock -- complete
      understanding.

                                        CATHY
                                      (intense)
                    I care about you... but you re
                    right: part of me is unhappy, and
                    I don t know why... and that s
                    frightening to me.

    Cathy releases Vincent s arm, flushed by her own intensity.

                                        VINCENT
                    Then you have no choice...

                                        CATHY
                  But I do, Vincent. That s why
                  I m here.

    Vincent shakes his head sadly.

                                        VINCENT
                  No, Catherine. You didn t come
                    this far to turn back. I know that...
                            (beat, bowing his head;
                              disappearing into
                            shadow)
                    And I understand...

    Cathy is about to call to Vincent as he disappears down the
    tunnel, into the shadows, but she stops herself.                                                                                  13.

    opens to reveal Cathy, as she steps into the office, and closes
    the door behind her. Now Maxwell looks up from his work, and
    notices that Cathy also hasn t slept a wink.

    Maxwell reacts to the meaning of the tense. Then:

    softly.

                    I even meant it. But...

    He shakes his head, and leans back in his chair, regarding Cathy
    with more than a trace of emotion.

                                    MAXWELL
                  I m not too crazy about losing
                    you.

                                        CATHY
                          (in kind)
                    Thanks, Joe. For everything.

                                    MAXWELL
                  You made the right call,
                    Radcliffe. Congratulations.

    On Cathy, who tries to smile with the satisfaction that she s
    made the right decision, we:

19 INT. FATHER S CHAMBER - DAY 19

    Vincent moves about the chamber, deeply distraught, while
    FATHER watches him, concerned.
                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  15.

                  But I love her...

                                        FATHER
                    Which is why you must let her go.
                  Why you must forget her.

                                        VINCENT
                            (flashing)
                    I can never forget her.
                            (shakes his head)
                    Even now, the pain is
                    impossible...

                                      (gently)
                  It will lessen, in time, and
                    finally pass. Then it will be
                  as it was. Before the woman.

                                        VINCENT
                  No. Mine was another life before
                    Catherine. I am changed.

                                        FATHER
                    Then accept the change in
                    yourself. Learn from it. But
                    allow the woman to follow her own
                    path. Vincent...

      Father s tone stops Vincent, who looks away, searching within
      himself.

                                        FATHER
                    There is no other way.

                                        VINCENT

                    Those are just words, Father.
                    Shadows of feelings. They offer
                  no consolation.

    With which Vincent moves to exit...

                                        FATHER
                    Vincent ...

    But Vincent is already gone. And on Father s face, helpless
    and worried, we:

20 INT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. PIERSON S OFFICE - DAY 20

    A small cubicle lined with books, overlooking a common. Pierson
    sits behind his cluttered desk, grading papers, eating malomars
    from an open box. Over this, an andante movement of the
      Brandenberg Concerto PLAYS, interrupted by a knock at the door.

                                        PIERSON
                            (calling out; not
                            looking up)
                    Come in.

      Jonathan Gould steps into the office and stands before
    Pierson, who now looks up.

                                        PIERSON
                  Yes?

                                        GOULD
                    Professor Pierson. My name s
                    Jonathan Gould. I m a grad
                    student. I was in your section
                    last semester.

                                        PIERSON
                            (half remembering)
                    Yes...
                                        (beat)
                  How can I help you?

                                        GOULD
                  You may have that backward...

    Off Pierson s quizzical look, Gould smiles. It s a remarkably
    seductive and charming smile. Then he turns suddenly serious.

                                        GOULD
                    I was there this morning. In the
                    lecture hall. Leland Quint is
                    a fool.

    Pierson isn t sure how to take this, but his interest is
    definitely piqued. He puts down his pen.

                                        GOULD
                    Mind if I sit?

    Pierson gestures to a chair before his desk. Gould sits.

                                        PIERSON
                  You were saying?

    Gould picks up come archeological trinket from Pierson s desk.
    Fingers it as delicately as he phrases what follows:

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  17.
20 CONTINUED:20

                                        GOULD
                    Just that Quint is the head of
                  the department. He s an
                      administrator, not an academic.

                                        PIERSON
                                      (warily)
                  But you believe me...?

                                        GOULD
                                      (intense)
                    I believe you saw something, and
                  I m curious enough to find out
                    what it was. Any scientist worth
                  his salt would be.

    Pierson smiles, appreciating the young man s bravado -- seeing
    himself thirty years before. He begins to assume the role of
    master to Gould s willing apprentice.

                                        PIERSON
                  So your interest in the matter
                  is what exactly?

                                        GOULD
                  The truth. I m only interested
                  in finding out the truth.

                                        PIERSON
                    Truth is an abstraction.

                                        GOULD
                  But that creature is no
                    abstraction. It s real, isn t it?

                                        PIERSON
                  Mr. Gould, I appreciate your
                    enthusiasm. Believe me: I once
                    felt that way myself. Probably
                    before you were born. But I think
                  the wisest thing would be to
                    forget it.

                                        GOULD
                                      (vehement)
                    I can t do that.
                                        (then)
                    Think at what you saw. What it
                    would mean.


                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  18.

20 CONTINUED: (2)20

                                        PIERSON
                    I ve already jeopardized what
                    little is left of my career. Take
                  my advice: you re young, don t
                    make my same mistakes.

    Gould shakes his head, disgusted, and rises.

                                        GOULD
                    I guess I m wasting my time.

    He crosses to the door, as:

                                        PIERSON
                  You don t understand. There s
                  no support. No funding.

    This stops Gould. He turns to face Pierson, standing over him.

                                        GOULD
                       (strongly)
                    With all due respect, Professor
                    Pierson, I do understand. That s
                  why I m here.

    Pierson is affected by the almost intoxicating persuasiveness of
    Gould s argument. After a moment, he nods with interest, and we:

                                                                  CUT TO:

21 - A SMALL BIRCH TREE 21

      moonlit, inanimate -- until it is disturbed and Vincent s
      shadowed face moves INTO FRAME, visible through the thin
    branches, a mask of turmoil. And we are:

    EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MOVING WITH VINCENT - NIGHT

    who has just stepped from the drainage duct, into the mist and
    fog. He makes his way through the park for a few hundred yards,
    keeping to the shadows -- when be is suddenly illuminated by a
    flood of bright light. A staccato sibilant SOUND. Vincent s
      shoulder jerks back. He s been hit by a tranquilizer dart. He
    looks up, horrified, and:

22 VINCENT S POV22

    the blinding light of a mini-van -- modified on either side by a
    pair of mounted hand-operated search lights, both of which are
    now trained on Vincent. The silhouette of a MAN holding a gun is
    barely discernible on the driver s side.                                                                                  19.
23 VINCENT23

    pulls the dart from his arm, and takes off through the park like
    a deer.

24 CLOSER ANGLE24

    to reveal that the silhouette is Gould s. Pierson sits behind
    the wheel, visible in b.g. through the windshield. Gould reloads
    his rifle with practiced speed, then takes off after Vincent,
    as:

25 INT. VAN25

    Pierson guns the engine. A pistol rests on the seat beside him.
    The van lunges forward.

25A  GOULD   RUNNING25A

    after Vincent, who scrambles up a steep bank toward a line of
      trees. Gould kneels on one knee, aims, and fires. Vincent
      stumbles, hit in the back of the leg. He yanks out the dart and
      continues up over the bluff, under the cover of trees, before
    Gould can finish reloading his rifle. Gould scans the tree line,
    catches a glimpse of Vincent s running figure, and sprints off
      toward him.

    Gould runs, first losing, then regaining sight of Vincent, who
    slaloms among the trees through moonlight and shadow.

26 OMITTED 26

27 RESUME SCENE - INT. VAN 27

    as Pierson turns the wheel onto a path parallel to the tree
    line. With the search light he rakes the trees, and catches a
    glimpse of Gould two hundred yards away, before losing him
      again, as:

27A GOULD27A

      breathing hard, stops and scans the woods before him.

28 OMITTED28

29 HIS POV29

      nothing. He s lost Vincent.                                                                          20.

      continues cautiously forward, as:

29B ANOTHER ANGLE - VINCENT 29B

      moving through the woods, disoriented. He braces himself
      against a tree, looks around.

29C HIS POV29C

      the trees bend in the moonlight and the ground tilts up before
      levelling. The poison of the darts is affecting his
        equilibrium.

30 OMITTED30

31 INT. VAN31

      Pierson sweeps the trees with his light, but sees no one.

31A VINCENT

      stops short, ducking behind a tree as the search light sweeps
      across. Just then, be hears a SNAP nearby, and presses closer
      against the tree, and:

31B GOULD31B

      stalks carefully into the shadow of a tree, but flies backward
      several feet, as if struck by a powerful blow. Vincent steps
      from the shadow, woozy, and makes his way back past Gould,
      who s left groaning on the ground.

34 EXT. DRAINAGE DUCT - NIGHT   34

      Vincent staggers toward the duct, but turns at the sound of an
      ENGINE kicking alive. Bright light cuts through the fog,
        illuminating Vincent, who raises his arms to shield himself.

35 HIS POV35

      the lights blur, then move across his field of vision, until
      they block the entrance to the duct.                                                                                  21.

35 RESUME SCENE35A

      As Vincent stumbles toward the entrance, Pierson emerges from
      the van. He hefts the pistol. It s a little awkward in his
      hand, but Vincent is twenty yards away, and nearing. Pierson
      steadies the pistol and squeezes the trigger, hitting Vincent
      in the chest. Vincent stops, then moves forward, as Pierson
        quickly and nervously reloads a second cartridge. Vincent is
      now only ten yards from him, as Pierson squeezes off another
      shot, which flies into Vincent s abdomen. Vincent doubles over,
      then falls headlong onto the ground before Pierson, into an
        unconscious heap. Illuminated by the van s lights, Pierson
      stands silently over his quarry, greatly awed, even humbled, by
      its magnificence. Gould steps up, his face smudged with dirt
      and blood.

                                        PIERSON
                                      (quietly)
                                  Get the light.

      A moment before Gould peels his eyes from Vincent and moves to
      the van.

35C REVERSE ANGLE35C

      a lighted third story window which frames an old woman peering
      out, holding something up to her face. CAMERA MOVES
      IN on her, and we see that she is holding an antique brass

    RESUME CATHY

    confronted again with the consequences of her decision. A sad
      resignation spreads over her face before she gently closes the
    book, and places it among the others, when the doorbell RINGS.
    Cathy moves to the door.

    ANGLE - DOOR

    where Cathy finds the envelope that Bennie has left. She picks it
    up and as she opens the envelope:

                                                                  CUT TO:

47 A FLASHLIGHT BEAN - CATHY S POV 47

      sweeping past assorted debris -- a rusted bicycle, a broken
    washing machine -- finally falling upon a stack of cartons
    against the wall, and:

    INT. CATHY S BASEMENT - ON CATHY - DAY

    as she pushes aside the cardboard boxes, exposing the jagged
    entrance to the tunnel world. She steps through, and:

48 IN THE TUNNELS   48

    beneath the building s foundation, Cathy follows her flashlight,
      stepping carefully over odd-shaped hunks of concrete, brick, and
    cinder block. She is startled by a RUSTLING SOUND to her right,
    and swings her flashlight in that direction, as:

49 HER POV - A CAT49

    stares up from the ground, transfixed by the light. The cat
    meows, then trots away, up the tunnel, and:

    as she blows out a breath, relieved:

                                  FATHER (O.S.)
                  I m here.

    Cathy wheels toward the sound.

    ANGLE - TO INCLUDE FATHER

    who stands off in the shadows, his face etched with concern.
    Cathy snicks off the flashlight. Her eyes adjust to the darkness
    as she moves to Father.

                                        CATHY
                    I wasn t sure where to find you.
                            (beat)
                    Your message said it was urgent.


                                        FATHER
                    Vincent is missing.

    Cathy tries to articulate her confusion, but before she can say
    anything:

                                        FATHER
                    He s been gone since the night
                    before last.

                                        CATHY
                  But I saw him that night.

                                        FATHER
                    I know. And now the second day
                  is almost done.

                                        CATHY
                    Isn t there anywhere he might have
                    gone? To be alone?

                                        FATHER
                  No. He would never cause me such
                    undue worry.
                                      (gravely)
                    He s nowhere below.

    Cathy is silent, shocked by the full realization of the news.
    Then:

                                        FATHER
                  He was not himself after he spoke
                    with you. He was disconsolate,
                    beyond reason... The pain must
                    have made him careless... or
                    worse.

                                        CATHY
                    I though he understood. We made
                  the decision together.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  25.

                            (beat; low)
                  But it was you who decided to
                    leave. You put Vincent in an
                    impossible position. Certainly,
                  the consequences must have
                    occurred to you.

                                        CATHY
                    I only meant to do what was best.
                  For both of us.

                                        FATHER
                    Once I thought I knew the
                    answer...

                            silence)
                  We must find Vincent. Quickly.

                  Our friends above are searching
                  the city. Beyond that, I don t
                    know.
                            (turning to leave)
                  So goodbye...

                    I thought you should know.

    He then slips out of the earth-orange light, into the shadows,
    leaving Cathy alone to digest the difficult news, as we:

                                                                  CUT TO:

51 INT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. LAB - RIGH ANGLE   DAY 51

    Vincent is prostrate on a long, steel examining table -- naked
    under a white sheet. An operating light illuminates his face.
    Heavily tranquilized, be is connected to an array of equipment
    and monitoring devices.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)         26.

    Electrodes all over his body register heartbeat, body
      temperature, breathing rate, etc. Pierson and Gould stand
      adjacent at a data center, trying to make sense of the incoming
      information.

    ANOTHER ANGLE. PANNING VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS

    with Vincent s body in the foreground. HOLD on Vincent s head,
    and bring his face INTO FOCUS. Over this:

                  How long until the tranquilizer
                    wears off?

                    Twenty-one beats a minute.

    NEW ANGLE - FAVORING PIERSON

    who seems vitally rejuventated.

                                        PIERSON
                    Remarkable... and his lungs must
                  be just as powerful... the blood
                  is so highly oxygenated.

    Pierson turns toward Vincent. Gould follows. They stand over the
    creature.

                                        PIERSON
                    He s a miracle... like nothing

                  We saw him run, Jonathan...
                    complete bipedal locomotion.
                    That can only suggest one thing.

                  of equipment here.

                                        PIERSON
                  We don t need it... yet. We run

                  Why wait? Why not issue a public
                    statement right now. Tomorrow
                  we could have the scientific
                    community at our feet.

                                        PIERSON

                    What s at risk?

    Pierson moves a few steps away from the examining table -- the
    bitter taste of the past rising up in his throat.

                    Don t you see, Jonathon. It could
                    happen again. They could take
                  him away, steal what s mine.

    Gould gazes at Pierson for a long beat. Then, quietly, but with
    intensity:

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  28.

    The two men exchange a tense look. PUSH THROUGH THEM to Vincent,
      cauterized, unconscious; as we:

52 EXT. ESPLANADE - ALONG EAST RIVER - DAY 52

    The sun is setting as a tug boat chugs languidly down the river.
    CAMERA FINDS Cathy walking slowly along the strand, passed by
    joggers and young mothers pushing perambulators.

    CLOSER ANGLE - CATHY

    tired-looking and emotionally spent, she sits on a bench and
    stares vacantly out over the river. Then:

    Vincent -- whose limbs, torso, and neck are now fastened to the
    table with thick leather straps. And on Vincent s unconscious
    face, we:

53A INT. CATHY S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 53A

      Vincent stands tentatively in the empty room. Although the room
      remains dim, everything seems brightly, strangely lit
      -- the furniture, the floor -- as if glowing unto itself. There
      is a pervasive, almost surreal pristineness, even a sterility
      here (NOTE: remember the end of 2001?). On a table, Vincent
      sees the volume of sonnets. His gift to Catherine. He lifts the
      book and holds it for a moment when he bears footsteps behind
      him. He turns quickly, and:

      VINCENT S POV

      an empty doorway. No one s there.

      RESUME VINCENT

      as he reacts, curious, then moves out of the room.

      INT. BEDROOM

      The same eerie atmosphere as the livingroom. Strangely empty,
      silent, and still. Vincent looks around, then moves slowly to
      Catherine s vanity. A shrine to her beauty. The lights are on
      along the perimeter of the mirror. Vincent lifts her hairbrush,
      and holds it tenderly for a moment, before replacing it. Then
      he regards his own face in the mirror, when Catherine s
      reflected nightgown-clad figure appears behind him. Vincent
      wheels around, and:

      HIS POV

      nothing. Only the terrace curtains billowing inward from a gust
      of wind.

      RESUME VINCENT

      as he replaces the book on the table. He moves to the French
      doors, and out onto the terrace.

      EXT. TERRACE

      Cathy stands, staring out over the jeweled city, her back to
      Vincent. The wind flutters her nightgown, and her hair. Vincent
      approaches her slowly. He reaches out and touches her shoulder.
      She turns, revealing the face of an old woman. Catherine
      Chandler, half a century older. She regards Vincent with a sad
      longing in her eyes, as we:

      topped bottle.

                    I m telling you, he spoke.

55B INT. LAB - DAY55B

      Vincent remains strapped to the examining table. His eyes,
        deep-circled and angry, follow the conversation between Pierson
      and Gould.

                                        PIERSON
                    The name of a woman: Catherine.


                                        GOULD
                    Probably mimicry. He heard the
                    name somewhere, and learned to
                    reproduce it.

                                    PEIRSON
                    But the cortical areas of his
                    brain are developed enough for
                      language...

      Gould now removes the syringe from the bottle and depresses the
      plunger, forcing out several droplets of the solution.

                                        GOULD
                    If what you say is true, why
                    doesn t be speak now and explain
                      himself?

      Vincent remains mute, but stares challengingly out at Gould.

      thick leather arm restraint taut.

                    He s disoriented and afraid...

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  32.

      Gould approaches Vincent with the syringe.

      As Gould prepares to inject, Vincent s rage explodes. With
      Herculean effort be breaks the uppermost strap, freeing one
      of his arms and knocking Gould powerfully back into the bank of
      electronic and surgical equipment.

      ANGLE - PIERSON

      astounded and terrified by this tremendous display of strength.

      RESUME SCENE

      As Vincent s monumental rage grows and he succeeds in breaking
      another strap, Gould scrambles far the dart pistol, and
      shaking, loads it.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.

      fires, catching Vincent in the side. Vincent pulls out the dart
      and capsizes the examining table with a tremendous crash.
        Frantically, Gould reloads, negotiates a new angle and fires
      again hitting Vincent in the shoulder. Vincent stands for a
      moment, stunned by the poison flooding his veins. He makes a
      lunge for Gould before he staggers and falls. Recovering, Gould
      sags and then pops out the empty cartridge. He shoots Pierson a
      long look. Then:

57 INT. CATHY S APARTMENT - DAY 57

      still a mid-move mess. Edie steps into the apartment, and Cathy
      closes the door behind her.

                      thing. Decaf makes me nervous.

    Cathy smiles and moves into the kitchen, while Edie sets down her
    leather bag, half-spilling onto the floor copies of Cosmopolitan,
    Us, and The Daily Inquirer. She sits on a carton -- testing it
    first. On an adjacent carton is a half-filled mug of coffee, and
    the book of sonnets Vincent gave Cathy, open face-down. Edie
    picks it up. Begins to read -- just as Cathy ENTERS FRAME, and
    sits on an upturned mulk crate.

                                        EDIE
                            (lifting her eyes from
                            books scrutinizing
                            Cathy)
                  So who s this Vincent?

    Cathy hands Edie a steaming mug of coffee. Cathy is evasive, but
    the mention of Vincent affects her deeply. Over the following,
    Edie sips her coffee.

                                        EDIE
                    Come on, girl: out with it.

                    He s a friend...

                                        EDIE
                    A friend, huh?

    Edie closes the book, then hands it to Cathy, who continues to
    hold it, as:

                                        EDIE
                  He have anything to do with those
                     second thoughts  of yours?

                                        CATHY
                  Not especially.

    Edie shrugs a whatever s-best-for-you shrug and sips her coffee.
    Just then, Cathy s attention falls on layered magazines beside
    Edie s bag. She picks up the Daily Inquirer and reacts to one of
    the front page headlines,

58 INT. LAB - VINCENT S POV - DAY 58

    An impressionistic blur of color and sound. The bars of a cage
    are wavy lines, and everything beyond them is indistinguishable,
    formless. Voices from previous scenes echo in Vincent s brain:

                                    CATHY S VOICE
                    A part of me is unhappy, and I
                    don t know why...

                                    FATHER S VOICE
                            (overlapping)
                  ... why you must let her go. Why
                  you must forget her.

    Then, a voice from the present intrudes on Vincent s waking
    dream, and his eyes focus, bringing Gould and Pierson into clear
    view.

58A NEW ANGLE58A

    Vincent now lies prostrate in e gorilla cage, his head resting
    in the crook of his arm. Pierson and Gould continue to converse,
    unaware of Vincent s conscious state.

                  You can t possibly be that naive.

      Pierson is struck by the dawning consequences of Vincent s
      capure.

                    There won t be a choice.

      Pierson is disconcerted by Gould s assertiveness, and changes
      his tone in an attempt to reason with him.

                      not, the world s about to make
                        a circus act out of him.

      Gould looks in at Vincent in the cage and then starts for the
      door. Pierson goes after him, blocking his way.

      Gould shoves him away, hard. Pierson crashes back into a table
      of equipment and collapses to the floor. From the ground, he
      watches Gould exit. Then, panicking, he looks toward Vincent.

      modern wing, and stop before an elevator.                                                                                    38.

    As they whoosh open, and Gould and Quint emerge into another
    hallway -- this one ultra-modern. They proceed down the hallway
    and approach Pierson s lab. Gould doesn t break stride as be
    pushes throught the door. Quint is right on his heels.

                                                                  CUT TO:

    Gould scans the room, Quint stands beside him.

             QUINT
                    Well?

    The cage is gone, and so is Pierson. And on Gould, his face
    heating in anger and embarrasment:

                                                                  CUT TO:

64 INT. DAILY INQUIRER OFFICES - DAY 64

    Amid the clatter, bustle, and smoke of the newsroom, BYRON TRASK
    sits behind his desk, talking on the phone. A cigarette with an
    inch of ash dangles from the corner of his mouth. Mid-forties;
    tall and thin and attractive, if somewhat weaselish; pronounced
    English accent; suspenders and a bow-tie.

                                        TRASK
                            (angry; into phone)
                    -- Then ask the bloody doorman...
                    of course he ll tell you... for
                    two thousand dollars, he damn well
                    better tell you.

    Trask slams the phone into its cradle, drags on his cigarette one
    last time before mashing it into the already full Charles and Di
    ashtray on his desk. He returns to the article in his IBM
    Selectric, starts typing, when;

                                  CATHY (O.S.)
                    Excuse me, are you Byron Trask?

    ANGLE - TO INCLUDE CATHY

      standing before Trask, who looks up and smiles. Her beauty
      immediately elicits Trask s transparent version of charm
    -- markedly different from his telephone manner.

                                        TRASK

                    Yes I am.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                   39.

                    D.A. s office.

    Trask s smile turns to ice.

                                        TRASK
                  See my editor or my lawyer, but
                    leave me alone. I m busy.

    As be returns to his typewriter...

                                        CATHY
                              (overlapping)
                  You don t understand. I m not
                    here far anything like that.
                            (and as Trask continues
                            typing)
                    Please...

    Cathy s desperate tone stops Trask. He looks up at Cathy, then
    nods grudgingly. Cathy removes the Inquirer from her bag. It s
    been quarter-folded. She turns the paper and hands it to Trask.

                                        TRASK
                    What about it?

                                        CATHY
                  Did it happen?

                                        TRASK
                            (handing the paper back
                            to Cathy)
                    It s there in black and white,
                    isn t it?
                            (beats off her
                              skepticism)
                  Ms. Chandler, we may not be the
                  New York Times, but we are a
                    newspaper. News is our business.
                            (picks up press release)
                  Did you know that this morning,
                  an orangutan at the Bronx Zoo
                    saved his keeper from choking on
                    a bagel by using the Heimlich
                    maneuver?

    Cathy shakes her head: no, she didn t.

                                        TRASK
                  And where do you suppose the
                    orangutan learned the Neimlich maneuver?

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                     40.

    Cathy shrugs.
                                  TRASK
                            (with emphatic
                              satisfaction)
                    Television. It s the truth. The
                    whole truth and nothing but the
                    truth.

    Cathy digests this information with renewed hope. Then:

                                        CATHY
                  Did you believe the woman, the
                    grandmother you mention?

                                        TRASK
                    It s my job to believe her.

                                        CATHY
                  But what do you believe?

                            beat, then)
                    I ve come to know the old woman
                    quite well. She s what you might
                    call a voyeur. But she s no liar.

                                       CATHY
                    I have to see her...

    Trask regards Cathy, a sycophant s smile tugging at the corners
    of his mouth. Then:

                                        TRASK
                    What s it worth to you?

    As Cathy rolls her eyes, we:

65 INT. ANNA LAUSCH S APARTMENT - DAY 65

    Winnie, a pursy overfed poodle, sits at ANNA S feet as she speaks
    with Cathy. The old woman, clearly a little batty and definitely
      a character, is excited by the company -- animated and
      theatrical. The apartment is a museum of exotica and travel
      memorabilia: stuffed birds, carved ivory, Indian shields, etc.
    Anna s high-backed chair commands a spectacular corner view of
    Central Park through a large picture window, and that is where
    she now gestures grandly:

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                    42.

                  be surprised the things you see...
                  if you sit here long enough.

    She gives Winnie a gentle nudge with her tiny slippered foot.

                                        ANNA
                    Winnie knows, don t you Winnie?

    Anna rests her hand lightly on the antique telescope.

                                        ANNA
                    With this, I can see all over the
                    Park. Many different people...
                                        (beat)
                    I look down on all of them...

    She swivels the telescope on its stand toward Cathy.

                                        ANNA
                    Here, try for yourself.

    Politely, Cathy accepts it.

                                        ANNA
                  Go on.

    Cathy bends down to the telescope and makes a pretense of
    looking through it.

                                        ANNA
                  Did you know I once saw Greta
                    Garbo? She was walking...

                                    CATHY
                            (taking her eye away
                              from the viewfinder)
                    Mrs. Lausch, I need to know what
                  you saw that night.

                                        ANNA
                  The night? I watch the night,
                    too. When the noises hush like
                    children... and on come the street
                    lamps... and the people of the dark...

    Anna trails off.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      42.

    Anna s eyes narrow as she slowly brings the power of her memory
    to bear.

                  Two men running... a truck
                    following... a bright light. They
                  go down by the tunnel... and the
                  man turns and I see his face...
                    a terrible wolf face... in pain.
                  And then he comes, the other man
                  in the truck... and he...

    Anna shrugs, looks through the telescope, adjusting it.

                                        ANNA
                    There.

    Cathy bends to look through the telescope again.

68 EXT. DRAINAGE DUCT - LATER   DAY 68

    Cathy walks the area, her eyes peeled for evidence of blood,
    for... anything. She turns at the dead-end and starts back toward
    the street. Her eyes scan the wall. She kicks some grocery boxes
    out of her way, and something clatters along the ground. She
    bends down and picks up one of the tranquilizer cartridges.
    Studies it. She sees another and stoops down for that one also.
    She straightens, rolling the two cartridges in her hand,
    thinking. Then she looks up at the old woman s window.

    CATHY S POV - ANNA

    a tiny figure in her third story window, once again at her
    telescope. Cathy herself has now become another event in the old
    woman s visual history.

                                                                  CUT TO:

                    Speak to me. Please...

    Vincent looks up: his face is sallow, his feverish eyes focus
    somewhere o.c. His condition has worsened considerably.

    WIDER - TO INCLUDE PIERSON

    pacing beside the cage, haggard and anxious. In b.g. boiler pipes
    of varying diameters climb the wall, crisscross the ceiling.

                                        PIERSON
                    I know you can. I heard you.

    But Vincent stays silent, continues to regard Pierson intensely.

                                        PIERSON
                    You ve got to help me help you.

69 CONTINUED:69

    Pierson stops and regards Vincent through the bars, astonished
    anew by the creature s ability to speak. Indeed, everything that
    follows from Vincent sparks and kindles Pierson s great wonder.

                                    PIERSON
                  So you can speak...
                              (recovering)
                  And you can understand me?

                                    VINCENT
                    Yes...

                                    PIERSON
                  Why did you keep silent in front
                  of Gould?

                                  VINCENT
                  The other man means me harm. No
                    words would change that.

    Pierson looks down, suddenly ashamed. Perhaps it is Vincent s
    tone. Perhaps Pierson already knows it himself, or has known it
    all along. A secret knowledge he was willing to bear from the
    outset in exchange for the magnificent creature who is now before
    him.

                                    PIERSON
                            (troubled)
                    I never meant you harm. You must
                    believe that.

    Vincent swallows. Blinks slowly as he nods. Then:

                                    PIERSON
                  Do you have a name?

                  Who is Catherine?

    Long beat. Then Vincent lowers his eyes.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

                  She is everything... but she lives
                    only in my heart...

                                        PIERSON
                  Is she like you? Another of your
                    kind?

                                        VINCENT
                            (shakes his head)
                    There is only me...

    Pierson breathes deeply, sensitive to the fact that his is a
    difficult question.

                                        PIERSON
                  How did...
                            (he breaks off; then)
                    Vincent -- what are you?

                                        VINCENT
                    I am what I am. If you cut me,
                    I will bleed. If you strike me,
                    I will strike back. And if you
                    keep me in chains, I will die.

                                        PIERSON
                    What do you mean?

                                        VINCENT
                            (by way of explanation)
                    Look at me...

    Pierson regards Vincent: he knows Vincent is right. But the
    burden of this possibility is too much for Pierson, as he turns
    and steps away from the cage.

                                        PIERSON
                    I don t know whet to do.

                                        VINCENT
                  Let me go.

                                        PIERSON
                    I can t. Not now. Not yet.
                    There are still so many unanswered
                    questions...

                                        VINCENT
                    Pierson --

    Now Pierson turns to Vincent.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  46.

    On Vincent, whose very life seems to be draining from him, then
    on Pierson, deeply troubled by his indecision. Hold.
    Then:

                                                                  FADE OUT:

70 HIGH SHOT - A CLUSTER OF STUDENTS 70

    joking among themselves, as their peers cross on their way to
    class. RACK FOCUS, and we are:

71. INT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY. - PIERSON S OFFICE   DAY 71

    as Pierson stares out his window at the activity below. Recent
    events have exacted a visible tali an the old professor. The
    KNOCK at the door startles him. He doesn t do anything at first.
    Another KNOCK, more urgent this time. He moves apprehensively to
    the door.

                                        PIERSON
                    Leave me alone.

                                  CATHY (O.S.)
                            (through door)
                    Professor Pierson?

    Pierson reacts to this strange female voice, at once relieved and
      guarded.

                                        PIERSON
                  Who is it?

                                    CATHY (0.S.)
                            (through door)
                    It s Catherine Chandler. Please
                  -- I need to speak with you.

                                        PIERSON
                              (realizing; then sotto,
                            to himself)
                    Catherine...

      A moment of decision, and then Pierson steps back and opens the
    door. Cathy enters the room apprehensively.

                                        CATHY
                    Thank you.

                                        PIERSON
                  How can I help you?

    From her shoulder bag, Cathy fishes out the tranquilizer
    cartridge, and hands it to him.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                              48.

                                        CATHY
                    I traced the serial number through
                  the supplier in Albany, to the
                    university -- then to you.

    Pierson ponders Cathy s path to him as be fingers the cartridge.

                                        CATHY
                    He s here, isn t he?

    Pierson returns to the window, stares out. Cathy moves closer.

                                        CATHY
                            (almost afraid to ask)
                  Is he alive?

    A long beats then:

                                        PIERSON
                            (nods; still gazing out)
                    He s spoken of you.

                                        CATHY
                    Please, take me to him...

                            (faces her)
                    I can t do that. I m sorry.

                                        CATHY
                  Why not?

                                        PIERSON
                    I need time. Everything s happening too quickly.
                    There s more at stake than you think --

                                        CATHY
                              (overriding)
                  No, there s only Vincent. If
                    you ve spoken to him, then I know
                  you understand.

    Pierson shakes his head -- overwhelmed, saddened by the truth of
    this.

                                        PIERSON
                  My whole career, my reputation,

                                        CATHY
                  Can it be worth the pain he must
                  be suffering?

                                        PIERSON
                  We still have so much to learn
                    from him. So much we don t know...

                                        CATHY
                  At what expense?

                                        PIERSON
                    It s too late, don t you
                    understand? Another man has
                    already seen him.

    Pierson drops his gaze, ashamed of his own weakness. But the
    color rises very rich in Cathy s throat and face.
    .

                    Professor Pierson.

    Pierson raises his eyes.

                                        CATHY
                            (intense)
                    I don t know how to explain this
                  to you -- I ve never been able
                  to explain it to myself. But
                    Vincent end I are connected. I
                    know him. And I know that
                    whatever he is, he is also the
                    best of what it means to be human.
                            (beat)
                  And if you take away his
                    freedom... you take away that very
                    part which makes him most human.

    ON Pierson, moved by Cathy s impassioned plea, and faced with a
    monumental decisions as we:

72 INT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - SUB BASEMENT - DAY 72

    The screen is black. We HEAR a key turning in a lock. A margin of
    light appears around the door before it pushes open. Pierson
    enters and turns on the overhead lights. Cathy ENTERS FRAME --
    shock and concern spread over her face.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      50.

    HER POV - VINCENT

    curled in a fetal position on the floor of his cage. With an
    effort, he raises his head slightly to observe Cathy and Pierson,
    then lays it back down.

    RESUME SCENE

    Cathy rushes to the cage.

                                        CATHY
                    Vincent...

    She kneels down and reaches through the cage to touch him.

    ECU - VINCENT

    whose eyes come alive at her touch.

    Cathy turns to Piersom.

                    Give me the key.

                            (starting toward her)
                    Where will you take him?

                                    GOULD (O.S.)
                    He s not going anywhere.

    GOULD

    steps into the room, casting a long shadow.

                    Give me the key...  

    Standoff. With Pierson between Cathy and Gould, frozen.

                    Listen to me --

    But Gould steps toward Pierson, who backs away, toward Cathy and
    the cage, as:

                                        GOULD
                    We ve gone too far, Pierson. Both
                  Of us.

                                        PIERSON
                  You don t understand. He does
                    speak.
                            (as if this might make
                            the difference)
                  His name is Vincent.

    Pierson has almost reached the cage, when Gould rushes him and
    throws him against the wall. As Gould rifles through Pierson s
    pockets for the keys, Pierson grabs a pipe wrench off a nearby
    valve, an swings it across Gould s brow. The blow sends Gould
    staggering backward, into a glass firehose box which shatters.
    Gould falls to the floor while Pierson scrabbles to his feet, and
    moves to the cage. And as be fumbles for his keys:

                                        PIERSON
                  I m sorry, Jonathan. But I can t
                    allow you to do this. Not with
                    what we know now.

    ANGLE - GOULD

      recovering, he picks up a foot-long triangular shard of glass
    from the broken pane.

                                    PIERSON (O.S.)
                  We have no right...

    RESUME SCENE

    Gould rushes Pierson.

                                        CATHY
                  NO!

    as Pierson simultaneously pivots and steps toward Gould, who
    buries the glass knife deep into Pierson s belly. Pierson falls
    heavily against Gould, his eyes vide with disbelief. Long beat.
    Then Gould releases Pierson, who falls to the ground. The keys
    skitter several feet away from him, toward Cathy, who picks them
    up. Gould extends a bloody hands -- his voice is eerily low,
    coarse, and calm.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                      52.

                    Give me the key...

    As Gould moves threateningly toward her, Cathy clutches the key,
    looking for something to use as a weapon. Nothing. Then: an idea.
    Cathy brandishes the key so that it protrudes from her fist. She
    swipes at Gould, who deftly parries the strike and grabs her,
    and:

    VINCENT

    climbs to his feet with excruciating effort -- only to watch
    helplessly as the struggle continues, well beyond reach. Gould
    locks his arm around Cathy s throat. Cathy drops the key, and
    struggles to pry Gould s unyielding hands from her throat. But it
    becomes clear that Gould no longer wants the key, but intends to
    squeeze the very life from her. Cathy is on her last few breaths
    as she swings Gould around, smashing him into the cage. Vincent s
    arm shoots out from between the bars, and hooks Gould s head.
    Vincent lets go a resounding ROAR and yanks Gould s head toward
    him, at once twisting it and smashing it against the bars of his
    cage. Gould slumps to the ground, dead, as;

    CATHY

    gasps to fill her lungs. Recovering, she moves to Vincent, who
    clings to the bars of his cage for support.

                            (weak whispers to Cathy)
                    Pierson -- go, help him...

    But it is too late for Pierson, who lays bleeding on the floor,
    near death. Cathy kneels beside him. Takes his hand in hers. He
    regards her with a weak smile, and his words come out heavy,
    broken.

                                        PIERSON
                    Forget me. Take him away from
                    here. Far away...

                                        CATHY
                    I will.

                                        PIERSON
                             (nods)
                    I wish I could have known him
                    better
                            (beats swallowing)
                    Vincent...
                                                                  (CONTINUED)                           53.

  But Pierson s eyes close, and the words die with him.
    CAMERA PULLS BACK, then ROLLS, framing the bloody aftermath
    of this tragedy, as we:

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

73 INT. VINCENT S CHAMBER - DAY 73

    Several days have passed, and Vincent s convalescence is evident:
    he sits in a chair, reading in the soft light, when Cathy enters.
    There s a tentativeness between them.

                                        CATHY
                    Father tells me you re better.
                            (off Vincent s nod)
                  I m glad.

    She sits nearby on the edge of Vincent s bed. Something weighs
    heavily on both of them, something between them that is unspoken
    and unfinished.

                                        CATHY
                    Vincent...

                                        VINCENT
                    Please, Catherine. Don t. The
                    first goodbye was too much.
                                (bows his head)
                    Thank you far coming to see me...

                                    CATHY
                  No --

    Vincent stops, and slowly raises his eyes to her.

                                        CATHY
                    This isn t a goodbye.
                            (beat)
                    Vincent, I was wrong to think I
                    could solve anything by running
                    away.
                            (then, off Vincent s
                            look of hopeful
                              anticipation)
                  I m not leaving.

    Vincent s heart swells with joy, but caution creeps into his
    voice.

                                        VINCENT
                    I would never want to keep you
                    from fulfilling your life... your
                    dreams.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)                                                                                  54.
73 CONTINUED:73

                                        CATHY
                    Don t you see? You re part of
                  my life... and my dreams.
                                        (then)
                    I was trying to deny that.

    Vincent silently acknowledges this as the source of his hurt.

                                        VINCENT
                  And now?

                                          CATHY
                    I have to learn to accept what s
                    between us...

    After a long beat:

                                        VINCENT
                    Then welcome home...

    Cathy smiles. They regard each other tenderly in the warm light,
    as we:
