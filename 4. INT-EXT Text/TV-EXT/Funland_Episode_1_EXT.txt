        SHIRLEY and LIAM burst out of a fire-exit followed by CONNIE and 
      RUBY. LIAM is carrying IDI'S cat.  RUBY is texting as she walks. 


        SHIRLEY and LIAM head towards SHIRLEY'S big open-topped Mercedes 
      300 SEL.  They are outside Sin's nightclub. There are billing 


                                    CONNIE 
                          (to SHIRLEY) 
                      You're playing right into Mercy's 


                                    SHIRLEY 
                      You think I'm that stupid? 

        SHIRLEY reaches the car, glances back at CONNIE. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      There are rules.  They've been broken. 

                                    LIAM 
                      It's my life Dad. 

      RUBY mimics him cruelly. 

                                    RUBY 
                      Mmr mmr mmr mmr mmr... 

        SHIRLEY wrenches the car door open. 

                                    SHIRLEY 
                      Get in the car. 

      They climb in.  SHIRLEY revs the engine.                                     CONNIE 
                      Shirley... 

        SHIRLEY looks at her.  She hesitates, realises she can't stop 


                                    CONNIE 
                      Watch yourself. 

        A squeal of tyres and the car speeds off.   

                                    CONNIE 
                            (calling after) 
                      I love you. 

        SHIRLEY hasn't heard her.  A flicker of fear in her eyes.   

      RUBY holds up her phone triumphantly. 

                                    RUBY 
                      Result!  He's coming.   

                                    CONNIE 
                      Who? 

                                    RUBY 
                      My boyfriend.  He's gorgeous, hung 


                                    CONNIE 
                      You'd better get on that door. 

                                    RUBY 
                      Do I look fat in this? 

        A small roll of fat bulges alarmingly between RUBY'S crop top 
      and a too-tight skirt.  CONNIE exhales a mouthful of smoke, eyes 


                                    CONNIE 
                            (cooly) 
                      No love. You're fine.

        A gang of LADS on a stag are crossing in front of the traffic, 
        plastic tits tied round their chests, beer bottles in hand.  They 
      chant and cheer lasciviously.  One of them rides an inflatable 


      LOLA and DUDLEY walk through this crowd slightly uneasily but

        DUDLEY yawns in an exagerrated manner.

                      Are you not tired?

      They pass the top of an alleyway.   

        A fleeting glimpse of TRIXIE her skirt pulled up, eyes cast 
        heavenward, receiving it from a large gentleman.  She grunts like                                     LOLA 
                      Walk on the beach?   

        DUDLEY looks at her and takes her hand.

                            (nervous) 
                      Let's go back. 

        SHIRLEY'S car passes them and screeches to a halt. 

                                                                              CUT TO:

        A large black Limo pulls up.  The window glides down revealing 
      the fat face of the MAYOR.  His eyes narrow as he takes in the 


        Covertly, looking nervously around, BRYAN exits the club and

                            (expectant) 
                      Have you got it?

                      Mercy find out, she fucking do me in. 

      Again checking over his shoulder he withdraws something from his 
        pocket.  He hands it to THE MAYOR.  It is a tiny golden thong.  

      THE MAYOR is clearly satisfied.  He allows himself a little smile.  
      He places the thong into a brown envelope. 

                                    THE MAYOR 
                      You've done well BRYAN.

        BRYAN'S fingers are gripping the edge of the lowered window.  THE                                     THE MAYOR

      The window rises.  BRYAN scuttles off as the MAYOR's car pulls

      KEN'S pleased with himself, turns to go.  SHIRLEY, seething, 
        emerges from the club.  KEN withdraws into the shadows, 


        SHIRLEY glances around, gathering himself. His mobile rings.  
      It's CONNIE. SHIRLEY hesitates, turns off the phone. 

                                                                              CUT TO: 



        CARTER walks along the desolate seafront, the turbulent expanse 
      of the bleak sea churning behind him. 

        A lone car drives past, seemingly slowing as it does so. CARTER 
        glances at it.  He slows his pace, watching warily.  The 
        silhouette of the driver is visible as it passes.        

        CARTER comes to a halt in front of the hoarding where he arrived 


      He looks up at the huge image of the MAYOR, staring reproachfully, 


        CARTER's eyes move down to the other images: MERCY'S lapdancing

        SHIRLEY walks to the boot and springs it open.  The bloodied and

        Mercilessly he brings it down on IDI'S head.
