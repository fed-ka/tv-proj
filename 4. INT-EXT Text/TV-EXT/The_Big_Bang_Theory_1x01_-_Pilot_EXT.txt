      LEONARD CROSSES UP TO THE INTERCOM PANEL AND RINGS A BUTTON.

                                    SHELDON
                The trick is going to be how you 

                trigger nuclear Armageddon and still 

                have her see you as a nice guy.


      WE HEAR THE VOICE OF PENNY'S EX-BOYFRIEND, KURT, OVER THE 
      INTERCOM.

                                  KURT (V.O.)
                Yeah?


                                    LEONARD
                Hello, I'm Leonard and this is 

                Sheldon.


                                    SHELDON
                Hello.


                                    LEONARD
                We're here to pick up Penny's clothes.


                                  KURT (V.O.)
                Get lost.


                                    SHELDON
                Okay, we tried.  Let's go.

                                    LEONARD
                Wait.  We're not going to give up just 

                like that.


                                    SHELDON
                Leonard, the clothes are in the 

                  building.  We have been denied access 

                to the building.  We're done.


                                    LEONARD
                Excuse me, if I were to give up at the 

                first little hitch I would never have 

                been able to identify the fingerprints 

                of string theory in the aftermath of 

                the Big Bang.


                                    SHELDON
                  I apologize.  What's your plan?


      LEONARD CONSIDERS FOR A BEAT THEN CROSSES TO THE LOCKED DOOR 
      AND FUTILELY YANKS ON IT.

                                    SHELDON (CONT'D)
                It's just a privilege to watch your 

                mind at work.


                                    LEONARD
                Shut up and let me think.


      LEONARD CONSIDERS THE SITUATION AS A DEVELOPMENTALLY-
      CHALLENGED DELIVERY PERSON, BOBBY, APPROACHES WITH A STACK OF 
      MENUS.


                                  BOBBY
                Hiya.


                                    LEONARD

                I have a job and make my own money.  I 

                put one menu at every door.  I'm 

                Bobby.


                                    LEONARD/SHELDON 
                That's great. / Good for you.

                Did you see which button worked?


                                    LEONARD
                Just grab the door.

      LEONARD AND SHELDON WALK OUT OF THE BUILDING IN T-SHIRTS AND 
      BOXER SHORTS.

                                    SHELDON
                Leonard?


                                    LEONARD
                What?


                                    SHELDON
                My mom bought me those pants.


                                    LEONARD
                I'm sorry.


                                    SHELDON
                You're going to have to call her.
