WATER - MORNING LIGHT
We are at the delicate interface between ocean and
air...liquid and gas...the event horizon where molecules
evaporate.
This interchange is ethereal.
Then, low
frequencies rumble through depths...louder...closer, now...
And the ocean surface is torn by a 46-foot catamaran and the
ROAR of 2,700 horsepower, rocketing at us at 140 knots...
OFFSHORE RACER:
"BORN TO WIN"
in PROFILE.
AERIAL:
"BORN TO WIN"
...has a canopy, low like a B-1 bomber and extends a half
mile.
It launches off two-foot swells, goes airborne, pushes
to 150 knots with another 1,100 RPM left...
leads the frontrunners towards a finish line demarcated by a
couple of $10 million yachts loaded with media.
At the last
moment occurs a small power loss, and "Born to Win" gets
nosed into second place by the 46-foot Skater, "Goddess"...
CUT TO:
thunders to the dock, throttled down at low revs.
The canopy
is up.
Crockett and Tubbs' helmets are off.
Dockhands tie
it off.
It's the same crowd you catch at a Grand Prix:
nine-
figure money, tall, Northern Italian women and minor German
princesses with Swiss educations, no bimbos and no questions
about asset origins.
The exception is "Born to Win's"
sponsor, a blonde, dreadlocked, bearded 6'4" SWITEK.
He
looks like a dot-com entrepreneur who got out in time.
Next
to him is a blonde Ukranian lady with high cheekbones.
We'll
see her again.
WINNING CIRCLE - CROCKETT + TUBBS
in second position to the Japanese driver and throttle man of
"Goddess," neither of whom speak English.
The #3 boat,
"Bicardi Silver," was driven by David Scott and throttled by
John Tomlinson...
CROCKETT + TUBBS
leave the winning circle among Asian and Mexican
billionaires.
As the small crowd breaks up...
A DEEPLY-TANNED PLAYER
named NICHOLAS in Vuarnet wraparounds and buzz-cut white hair
glides by...
NICHOLAS
(low)
Burnett, what's crackin'?
CROCKETT
Nothing.
TUBBS
Maxin' and relaxin'.
NICHOLAS
(doesn't believe them)
Sure.
Change your mind; get
inclined?
Let me know...
Whatever Nicholas is soliciting, Crockett and Tubbs don't
want.
(Nicholas brokers "go-fast" runs, moving loads from
offshore into South Florida.
Among guys who pilot offshore
race boats, there are one or two who've never run a load, but
no one's found them yet.)
Meanwhile...
CUT TO:
The chopper rockets in, settles.

He's come outside to hear better.
In the background Gina shakes her head about Switek.
He blew
it.
Trudy looks at Crockett and sees Crockett's focused,
hearing...
CROCKETT
Who is this?
INTERCUT
WITH:
Nothing.
Rusting marine parts and corrugated metal fall into
weeds next on a channel of the Indian River.
It cuts through
inner-city Miami.
Distant noise.
But...
Caribbean freighters seized by US Customs rust at the bank.
MOVE IN.
Two Cadillacs are parked.
Waiting.
A door opens.
An interior light comes on.
MOVE CLOSER.
Two Russian
slickster types.
Patient.
One looks at a watch.
The other
triggers his cell phone.
A meeting is imminent.
MEANWHILE:
banks hard left and heads for north 95 towards Lauderdale.
Meanwhile...
CUT TO:
THE DEAL - NIGHT
Three Aryan Brothers in business suits get out of the rear of
the Escalade and Suburban with a driver in each.
Our two
"Russians" approach from their Cadillac with a backup
Cadillac and one driver on the other side.
CLOSER:
ARYAN BROTHERS.
Friendly.
Hip-hop culture has
invaded White Supremacist gangs.
Buzz cuts.
Goatees.
A
couple of diamond earrings.
RUSSIAN #1
...sample now is okay.
And we want
sample load when we do deal...
ARYAN BROTHER
Sure, man.
RUSSIAN #1
What inventory you can supply...?
ARYAN BROTHER #1
Meth.
Glass, ice, K's, E's,
Mitsu's, Ames, Ex...whatever you
need.
Coke?
Tonnage.
And
Colombian H.
But give us a heads
up...
The Aryan Brother pops him a couple of vials.
ARYAN BROTHER #1 (cont'd)
Ice.
Spectra-analyze that shit.
And party-on with the coke.
You
are looking at ninety-two percent
pure...none of that jumped-on
powder they sell up in New
Yorioo...
ARYAN BROTHER #2
Yeah...
(beat)
Now, let's see the green...
One of the Russians puts his hand on a weapon as the other
opens up a Nike sports bag.
RUSSIAN
Never seen money before?
This is
called "money."
Aryan Brother #1 reaches into the bag at the wrapped stacks
of hundreds.
Flips through a couple, takes one or two at
random.
Russian nods for him to go ahead.
ARYAN BROTHER #1
Okay.
You got lotsa green.
We got
all the goodies.
We party.
Larry'll call you in the AM and
talk money, quantity, time and
place...
WIDEN.
Everybody goes back to their cars.
As the two
"Russians" get into theirs, Aryan Brother #1 turns from the
running board of the Escalade with his driver's door open.
ARYAN BROTHER
Hey, Ivan!
I forgot to ask you
something, my brother...
He looks at his partner and nods, who says something into a
Nextel.
ARYAN BROTHER (cont'd)
...they have a decent death-benefit
program in the FBI?
For the Russians in the car, time freezes.
As they start
to react, they're blown up by .50 caliber rounds from the two
sniper positions.
The .50 caliber rounds go right through
car bodies, sheet metal, upholstery, glass, human flesh,
bone, more upholstery and metal and out the other end.
Another round goes through the passenger door, through the
passenger, through the driver, out the driver door and into
the night...
WIDE
The three Aryan Brothers approach the steaming cars with the
chopped-up occupants and take the gym bag full of cash.
The
Escalade driver dons night-vision goggles.
They load up and
drive off as we hear the "thump, thump" of Air Support and
some distant sirens.
Meanwhile...
CUT TO:
Tracking with Stevens' Bentley from the front.
The black Sikorsky is almost on the Bentley's hood.
Tubbs
racks the chopper sideways so that Alonzo can see Crockett in
the copilot seat...
CLOSER:
CROCKETT
has his handgun out and is waving Alonzo over to the
shoulder.
Tubbs keeps the chopper almost blocking Alonzo's
Bentley.
Alonzo pulls over.
Tubbs wheels around and lands
on the shoulder.
They approach...
ALONZO STEVENS
exits the Bentley and walks toward Crockett and Tubbs.
He
holds his hand out to keep them at a distance.
Freeway traffic roars past.
Crockett and Tubbs don't get too
close, heeding Alonzo's warning...
TUBBS
(incensed, over traffic
noise)
What the hell did you do?
STEVENS
The Feeb gig was I front a coupla
undercover, Russian-speakers to
them.
One's ATF.
And broker the
deal.
Set up the meet with the NLR
types...
Stevens takes a low-resolution E-mailed image from his pocket
and hands it to Tubbs.
Tubbs looks up, shocked, hands it to
Crockett.
Stevens' head rotates loosely on his
shoulders...his mind's elsewhere...
CROCKETT'S POV:
IMAGE
Alonzo's wife, Francine, is bound - clothes torn - to a chair
in a TV room.
On the floor are two young boys bound with
plastic ties.
Paper bags are over their heads.
Francine's
eyes are as large as saucers.
Around her neck is a necklace
of C-4 explosive connected to a detonator.
STEVENS (cont'd)
(shouts)
So I gave them up, man!
Gave up
the Feds!
Gave up everything
I knew.
Now I got to go home...
CROCKETT
How'd they get onto you?
STEVENS
How do I know?
But it was from the
get-go.
Knew the FBI had run me
into them.
(beat)
Sonny, I gotta go...!
MEANWHILE:
on police radio listens to a message from Trudy while...
STEVENS
(to Tubbs)
I gotta, I gotta go...!
TUBBS
Alonzo...
STEVENS
What...?
TUBBS
(voice cracks)
Alonzo, you don't need to go home.
Now Alonzo knows.
STEVENS
They said they wouldn't hurt them,
wouldn't hurt them if...
TUBBS
They lied.
CROCKETT
They been known to do that...
Alonzo Stevens has a strange look in his eyes.
He looks at
Crockett and Tubbs, as if to say something.
He doesn't.
Crockett and Tubbs walk towards him, to reach him...to
console him...
BUT ALONZO STEVENS
backs away.
Looks at them sadly.
And before they can stop
him, he steps out onto the freeway, opens his arms, and
embraces the front bumper of a 70 m.p.h. 18-wheeler.
BOATS - NIGHT
They're two feet out of the water on their dry dock, next to
a Marine Shed.
It's an unlikely location because derelict factories, cheap
apartments, weeds and marine scrap metal are the
neighborhood.
and a SWAT team in the weeds across the river.
They include
SGT. JEAN-LOUIS BASTIDE, a Haitian in dark sweats.
They all
are in plain clothes.
BASTIDE
Odile, she say they're pregnant...
We don't know what that means, yet.
TUBBS
Yeah?
Okay.
Only Jean-Louis and I
do the talking...
CUT TO:
approach the two deep V-hull go-fast boats with three engines
off the back.
Tubbs cracks the breech of the grenade
launcher and loads a 40-millimeter shell, while he strolls
down the dock...
CROCKETT
tosses two Willie Peters (white phosphorus grenades) into the
boats.
Tubbs fires the M-40 at a third boat, which explodes
flame, followed by...
TWO CARNATIONS OF WHITE PHOSPHORESCENCE
destroy the smuggler's Strykers, which we saw in Fujima's
video.
Crockett + Tubbs have just put Sal Maguda out of
business.
They walk away and around the side of the shed,
disregarding the curious citizens of Little Haiti, come to
watch the fireworks...
CUT TO:
Corrosion and decay.
People look coldly at us.
Malevolence
and malefaction on every corner.
No one's picked up the
garbage for a month.
Poverty in the Caribbean half-light...
CROCKETT & TUBBS

The La
Perla section was a 16th Century haven for pirates.
It's had
little civic improvements in 400 years.
They enter a nightclub - shabby neon.

It looks like a 38' deep-V

And wait.
And nothing happens.
TUBBS

Still apprehensive, concluding they're victims of a "no-

That's it.
They split.

Haitian soldiers search Crockett and
Tubbs.
They defer to the Russian-speaking security.
Mercedes pulls forward...
CROCKETT
eyes his pager; Tubbs his cell phone: no signal in an urban
area?
Blocking signal traffic is something the CIA does over
Baghdad.
It's not supposed to be happening in Haiti on a
dope deal.
CROCKETT + TUBBS
SEE a third circle of security approach.
PRIVATE-SECTOR TYPES IN BUSINESS SUITS
carrying automatic weapons, some more casually dressed, some
with night-vision goggles.
The vehicles stop.
Crockett and Tubbs are directed to get out.
They're pushed
around and searched.
A working class Glaswegion Scot, a
couple of 5'10" Brits are off to the side with short hair and
shoulders that are too deep and faces like Rugby players (ex-
SAS).
Russians are ex-KGB.
Languages overheard:
smatterings
of Russian, Hebrew and English.
Crockett and Tubbs look at
each other:
they get it.
This is the cream of private
sector security.
And it says top dollar infrastructure.
THEY + WE SEE:
Four avenues lead in.
Each avenue is blocked.
The square is
closed down to vehicles and pedestrians.
Locals have
disappeared.
In the center of the square are FOUR MATCHING
BLACK SUBURBANS.
CROCKETT
gestures to Tubbs to look up.
They see...
ROOFTOPS:
TWO-MAN TEAMS - SNIPER + SPOTTER
with night-vision goggles...
CROCKETT + TUBBS
are clean.
CROCKETT, TUBBS + ISABELLA
cross through a no-man's land.
It feels like being in the
open in Kosovo.
TUBBS
checks out the first Suburban's uplink satellite dish on a
hydraulic mast.
The rear's converted into computer equipment
sitting in ruggedized racks...
TUBBS
Subterranean alarms are going off.
Tubbs finds himself in
this small city, occupied by narcotraffickers and their
security in the middle of nowhere.
Urgency agitates Tubbs.
He controls it...
CROCKETT
in the town square, now, too.
But Isabella stayed inside
Montoya's Suburban.
Now, she lowers her window.
ROADBLOCKS
break up.
Montoya's Suburbans pull out.
The security cordon
deforms.
It all disappears around them.
It leaves only the
Mercedes, a driver, and Crockett and Tubbs...
CLOSER:
CROCKETT
looks after the caravan.
CROCKETT'S POV:
ISABELLA'S EYES
in the side-view mirror on the passenger side.
She is
looking at him.
CROCKETT
holds that look.
ISABELLA'S EYES IN THE MIRROR
holds his.
CROCKETT
Sound deadens.
His attention is on the woman in the
mirror...until it's broken by Tubbs' attention to his cell
phone.
TUBBS' CELL PHONE
Signal strength returns.
Tubbs punches in numbers.
TUBBS
(low)
...who did we just meet?
He waits.
A phone rings.
It's picked up by Gina.
GINA (O.S.)
Hello...?
Tubbs is relieved...
TUBBS
You okay?
GINA
Yeah.
TUBBS
You sure?
GINA
Yes.
What's up?
TUBBS
Nothing.
Calling to say hi...
What's up with you?
INTERCUT WITH:
TUBBS
What flowers?
GINA
The bouquet, here.
Five-hundred
dollars worth of roses...yellow.
Pause.
TUBBS
There a note?
Pause.
GINA
You mean with the flowers...?
TUBBS
What's it say?
GINA
"Salutations from the south..."
A deep chill.
GINA (cont'd)
I...I thought it was from you.
And, now, she gets it.
Gina is in the kitchen.
Alone, in
their secret safe-house location.
She and Tubbs have nothing
to say.
He looks to Crockett.
The message from Montoya-
Londono is clear:
I know you.
I can reach out and locate
you our yours.
Anytime.
YOU ARE NOT SAFE.
TUBBS
We're on our way...

He's sweating.
His shirt's off.
The cargo is ten black

Tubbs trusts nobody but himself to tie-down the load.
The

There's a plastic bladder holding a

The A-500 with its stealthiness under the
Aero Commander together like a single footprint.
AERIAL ANGLE:
TWO PLANES
piggybacked, enter US airspace and cross the coastline into
Florida.
From underneath, the Aero Commander sweeps to the right on
approach as Tubbs radically dives for the trees, hugging the
contour at 220 knots at 150 feet...having snuck this plane
and its load into the United States of America.
CUT TO:
Alone in the acid-yellow glare of the sodium vapor lights.
We wait.
We don't know why we're here.
PARKING LOT PERIMETER - SAWGRASS
MOVE IN...and we REVEAL staked-out are Crockett, Jean-Louis
and Tubbs...
CROCKETT
Neptune gonna show?
We don't know who he's talking about.
JEAN-LOUIS
Oh, he'll show.
This is his kind
of deal.
Crime on crime.
Who's
gonna call the cops?
CROCKETT
(skeptical)
Usually his thing is street
dealers.
Torture their families

This...?
JEAN-LOUIS
He's ambitious.
TUBBS
Heads up...
ESCALADE
Lights off.
Cruises through the parking lot past the U-Haul-
It to the other side and disappears.
TUBBS (cont'd)
That's slick:
Neptune's Escalade's

But no one's supposed to notice his
drive-by?
CROCKETT
Here's another incognito genius...
ANOTHER ANGLE:
MALIBU SS
cruises the other end of the parking lot.
The Escalade
returns.
All's clear.
Both converge around the U-Haul-It
truck.
Out of the Escalade steps NEPTUNE - 6'4", narrow-
shouldered and bald.
From the Malibu and back of the
Escalade, Four more Haitian ZO POUNDERS with handguns,
shotguns and shades...
NEPTUNE
pops the lock on the U-Haul-It with a crowbar.
He rolls up
the door expecting millions worth of cocaine.
Instead he
comes face to face with the barrel of a 12-gauge...
TRUDY
April Fool, motherfucker.
Trudy whips the butt end of the shotgun around, caving in
Neptune's cheekbone and nose...
WIDER - NEPTUNE
goes down for the count.
Switek - under the truck - rolls
out.
Crockett, Tubbs with shotguns, Jean-Louis and Zito with
CAR-15s emerge from the perimeter with bright lights on
shouting for the Haitians to freeze...
TUBBS
(Patois)
Arrete!
Arrete!
Freeze!
(to one)
Et vous, mo-fo!
A 250-lb. ZO POUNDER brings up his weapon.
Crockett BLOWS
the guy's legs out from under him.
Zito disarms him.
The
other two are disarmed.
NEPTUNE
is rolled over by Crockett.
He plastic-ties his wrists and
feet.
Others are manhandled...
JEAN-LOUIS
(in French)
Get the fuck in the truck...!
Zo Pounders, plastic-tied, are thrown into the truck with the
thousand kilos of cocaine.
But not Neptune.
The gate is
rolled down and padlocked.

In seven seconds they're
doing over 70 knots.
And Crockett holds it there as...
ISABELLA
The wind whips her hair behind her, now.
The two are small

Crockett hands her
wraparound shades for her eyes.
She doesn't want them...
CROCKETT
(through headset)
So where's the best place for
mojitas?
ISABELLA
Bodeguita del Medio.
It's the only
place for mojitas...
CROCKETT
Where's that?
ISABELLA
Off a little alley with
cobblestones.
Hemingway went

CROCKETT
The Keys?
ISABELLA

CROCKETT
Havana?

business...
ISABELLA
Are you afraid?

his head "no")
Good.
And you don't need a visa.
Cause you're with me.

Wind
and salt electrify Isabella.
She turns to Crockett and
smiles, putting on the glasses, now.
Crockett gestures to
her knees.
She should keep them bent.
Crockett pushes it to
75 knots...
FRONTAL:
CROCKETT + ISABELLA
in strong light, ripped by wind.
Behind them are ocean and
sky and twenty-foot plumes which jet from the props and make
a wake that vectors in diagonals to what each is leaving
behind them...where they've been...and converge to push them
to the new places where they're headed.
Behind, the skies
are leaden.
They're racing a storm.
Sunlight shafts through
a gap in thunderclouds, turning the clouds yellow.
Now, they
turn peach against the darkening open water and the grey sky
behind.
The boat vibrates, the engines scream and...
CROCKETT
waves her over to join him behind the wheel.
He holds out
his left hand to steady her.
He brings her to him.
Both
lean against his high upholstered chair.
He holds her to his
side.
Indicates the wheel...
CROCKETT
Light touch.
Everything comes to
you through the wheel.
CROCKETT
stays on the throttle, throttling back when the props are out
of the water so you don't redline the engine and forward
when reentering.
The swells are now four feet.
They launch
off each, get airborne, cut into the next...
CROCKETT (cont'd)
How do we get into Cuba?!
ISABELLA
My cousin is the harbor master.
You must not bring in drugs.
You
cannot be armed.
If you're
carrying, it has to go.
Or stow it
inside.
No one will go near your
boat...
CROCKETT
You do business in Cuba with your
husband?
ISABELLA
I never do business in Cuba.
(beat)
And nobody goes to Cuba but me.
(smiles)
And he is not my husband...
Crockett's surprised.
And he doesn't push it.
CROCKETT
Were you born in Havana?
ISABELLA
Angola.
My mother was being a
surgeon there.
She volunteered.
Mozambique and Mali, too...
(over the wind)
...those days, in those days...she
was part of Cuba's gift to the
third world.
She came from a
bourgeois family with a house in
Verdado...we still have the house.
We will go there...
CROCKETT
Where's she now?
ISABELLA
She's dead...
Crockett looks at her.
Her perspective is that of the '60's
and '70's, the politics of national liberation, the
perspective of Marcuse and Franz Fanon.
CROCKETT
Your father?
ISABELLA
Angolan Military.
Went back to the
fighting.
Disappeared.
Who
knows...?
Isabella looks at the look on Crockett's face.
ISABELLA (cont'd)
Go ahead and ask...
CROCKETT
How's he not your husband?
ISABELLA
I am no one's wife.
I live in my
own house.
I do not live in a
man's house.
He has a wife.
We
are together.
I am free.
Because
of banking and finance and travel...
(looks at him, shouts over
wind)
And I can do anything I want...
She laughs.
She has that combination of intellect, beauty
and youth.
Everything is possible...life will never
end...she can ride this crest eternally.
And Crockett knows that her confidence makes her oblivious to
peril, makes "right now" too real because she believes she
will live forever.
CROCKETT
can't help it.
He looks right at her.
She lifts her face to
the spray.
Some clouds part and light strikes her...
And Crockett wants to possess her; to protect her.
He wants
no one else to have her.
He wants no harm to come to her.
And this is an impulse that takes him over to the core of who
he is.
And, as we MOVE IN CLOSER, Crockett has to turn
away...
ISABELLA
sees this.
She's quizzical.
Crockett looks back at her.
Their eyes connect.
"BORN TO WIN"

CROCKETT

She rocks back against his body.
They rip across the seas...
CUT TO:

The paint on the outside of this house is peeling
and patinaed with stain.
The yard is overgrown.
The stucco
fence around the streamline deco facade is crumbling from
weather and time...
CROCKETT WATCHES THE OCEAN
from the balcony of the futuristic villa in Verdado...
A
futurism from 1939, peeling aqua, aging science fiction.
Wherever we are in the world, this place is out of the
stream, outside history.
And Isabella, this woman from a
different world, enters, brings him an oversized cup of
coffee.
In his trousers, Crockett drapes an arm across her
shoulders and they stand in the air.
CROCKETT
hears voices from the interior.
ISABELLA
My aunt.
She's ancient.
She looks

engines, tying it off.
Gina stands halfway up the small lawn

As Crockett approaches, he looks blankly at
Tubbs, offering no explanation...
TUBBS

The meet with Castillo and the fed

It's in 45 minutes...
Tubbs goes inside.
Crockett follows.
As he passes Gina...
GINA
What's up, Sonny...?
Crockett looks at her.
He has no answer.

Its crimson paint is peeling and it's been
stripped of everything salvageable.
They're alone.
TUBBS

What is going on...?!
CROCKETT
As in...?
TUBBS
There is "undercover."
And there
is "Which way is up?"
CROCKETT
You think I am in so deep I forgot?
TUBBS
I am asking.
You to me.
CROCKETT
Do you believe...I have forgotten I
am a cop?
TUBBS
I would never doubt you.
This is the answer Crockett needed to hear.
TUBBS (cont'd)
And do you doubt I will slot anyone
complicit in the death of Maria,
Alonzo and those children?
Anyone...whoever they are...
CROCKETT
No, I do not.
And we know that might mean Isabella.
- NIGHT
We are on a peninsula with palm trees.
A bluff dotted with a
small forest of satellite dishes.
A ribbon of white-sand and
beyond that is silver light off the water.
It is rural and

The door opens.
Isabella emerges.
CLOSER...she
searches, looking for someone as she descends the ramp.
Then...
CROCKETT
emerges from behind an SUV.
He came to meet her plane.
ISABELLA'S
expression changes, but she masks it.
Businesslike, she walks across the tarmac.
There are two
Suburbans.
One for her; one full of security.
Crockett and
her meet.
No show of affection.
Her Secretary, carrying her
briefcase, accompanies her towards the second Suburban.
NIGHT
deplaning his G-4 crosses to his armored Suburban.
with Switek and Zito.
Trudy's in a tank top.
Jos looks at
Trudy appreciatively...
TRUDY
returns the look with a stare that says, "Don't fuck with
me".
Jos raises his eyebrow and after noting the two
handguns holstered in the waistband of her hiphuggers...
CUT TO:
enter from the cargo shed onto a roadway just as...
YERO POV:
GINA
passes by, driven by Switek.
They're en route to pick up
Tubbs.
JOS YERO (CONT'D)
And put eyes on her.
Put eyes on
her twenty-four hours a day...
CUT TO:
NIGHT
Isabella hands out banana leaves wrapped and tied around
cooked rice and barbecued pork.
Gina and Tubbs walk away
down the beach towards phosphorescent waves.
ISABELLA
I forgot the napkins.
CROCKETT
And the chopsticks and fortune
cookies?
ISABELLA
What's the best fortune you ever
got?
CROCKETT
They're all the same.
"Financial
security is around the corner."
"Your friends love you."
ISABELLA
In Kowloon, once, I got one that
said, "Live now because life is
dust."
Crockett and Isabella wander down the beach, hard from the
ebb tide.
CROCKETT
Do you have assets somewhere else?
Bank accounts?
ISABELLA
Why?
CROCKETT
...to fall back on.
You know, a
fail-safe.
Insurance.
ISABELLA
Do I need it?
CROCKETT
(shrugs)
Everybody needs it.
Ask
Prudential.
Or Allstate.
ISABELLA
(laughs)
'Cause whatever can go wrong,
will...?
The Perseids make the night sky over the water look like the
Fourth of July.
CROCKETT
Something like that.
The odds
catch up with you.
The odds are
like gravity.
You can't negotiate
with them.
(then)
So...at some point, you should cash
out, take your money and run...
ISABELLA
(smiles)
Really?
CROCKETT
Sure.
As far away and as fast as
you can.
ISABELLA
When?
CROCKETT
Whenever.
Maybe later, maybe
sooner.
What is Sonny Crockett trying to say to her?
ISABELLA
Would you find me...?
CROCKETT
Of course.
ISABELLA
Where would I go?
CROCKETT
Zanzibar.
The Comoros Islands.
Somewhere in the Indian Ocean.
There's twelve-hundred islands
there...
ISABELLA
(smiles)
Is this the protective male talk?
CROCKETT
(deadly serious)
This is the talk of a man...if he
were your husband...he would never
put you at risk.
He would never
put you within a thousand miles of
anything that could hurt you.
ISABELLA
And if I were in the Comoros, in
the Indian Ocean, where would you
be...?
CROCKETT
A few more moments, still in this
business.
Then I'd find you.
ISABELLA
Would you?
Because if you
couldn't, I would be very lonely...
I would have left the only world I
know and have known since I was
seventeen.
(smiles, touches Crockett)
But none of this will happen.
So
it doesn't matter.
Because we are
on the Guajira Peninsula.
And all
you see around you...look around...
is Archangel de Jesus Montoya-
Londono.
He is my man.
And you are
a smuggler moving a load...
Her eyes say that she listened to his warnings and will
disregard them.
Life is dust.
Meaning is in the moment, and
that's right now.
The intensity is because it's impossible.
Because it's
impossible, they've been free to imagine.
And that's made
the heat of it stronger...
CROCKETT
...in the morning.
ISABELLA
I'll be on board by noon.
Crockett didn't expect that.
ISABELLA (cont'd)
What did you think?
This deal with
you is my deal.
I am responsible.
She vouched for him.
She has to stand behind it.
He puts
his arm around her waist.
CUT TO:
drives up.
Parks.
She approaches along the sidewalk, down
the walkway under the banana trees and birds of paradise.
Motion sensors trigger exterior lights.
Gina cocks her ear,
waiting to hear...
Then, offscreen, Tommy the dog barks.
Reassured, her left hand on her .380, she reaches for her
keys, opens the door...
A tall wall of planting hides the $150,000 house from the
road.
Neighbors are double-wide trailers.
The house has
some sophisticated radio antennas as well as a twelve-foot
satellite dish.
On the driveway are two Escalades and a
Bentley.
Out the back, off the dock is a two-million dollar
sports/fishing boat.
Someone's entering numbers on a cell
phone.
swung by the Honduran freighter's crane cross 10' of open
water onto freighter's deck to join 18 others already there.
It's the last of the transfer.
CAPTAIN
(loud hailer)
Me-a salama.
Ila l-liqa.
TUBBS
Yeah.
Whatever...
(waves)
separate.
lines run from the freighter to two go-fast boats.
The fuel
bladders with crampons slide down the rope into the smaller
"cigarette" boats..."dope-on-a-rope."
WIDER:
ONE STARKEY
loaded, takes off into the night, no lights.
A second one
pulls away as the third boat's being loaded; Switek and Zito
climb into a cigarette.
Meanwhile...
THE SCARAB + THE
STRYKER
jam over the swells into Government Channel, NOT SLOWING this
time, even though the limit is 15 knots.
Barely missing
sport fishing boats, slower recreational craft.
CUT TO:
over his FLIR monitor scanning trailer parks.
Nothing.
Then
he notes a double-wide with two satellite dishes.
CASTILLO (V.O.)
(to Tubbs)
Three possibles...
CUT TO:
CASTILLO (O.S.)
(radio filter)
Do you have her?!
Trudy DOESN'T answer.
She's totally focused on a clamshell
video screen connected to a fiber optic...
FOLLOW THE FIBER
OPTIC...as a SWAT technician feeds it into...
CUT TO:
And Trudy and we SEE in fish-eye a long-haired Nazi Low-Rider
and the bulked-out Brother with the Hefty garbage-bag apron.
Deeper in the trailer, her clothes torn, blindfolded, is Gina
with the C-4 necklace.
Beyond her, the woman in the house
dress and her large, retarded son.
TRUDY
(into radio, to Castillo)
Have eyes on her.
She's alive.
Moving in...
holding the bag of Chinese for the Long-Haired NLR.
He
reaches and...
TUBBS
rips Long-Hair through the door, down the stairs, where two
SWAT slam him into the ground.
He struggles.
A baton slams
twice across the back of his neck.
He's out.
Handcuffed,
and Tubbs and Trudy are in the interior...
hears.
CASTILLO
(into loud hailer)
Go!
with a .50 caliber Burrows is hit about 15 times from MPD
SWAT firing from across the bridge on a down angle towards
him.
MPD helicopters suddenly LIGHT up the sky.
CUT TO:
pulls out, racing to get away from the firefight.
But
BRIGHT LIGHT freezes it...heavy rounds slam into the engine,
crack the block, stream sprays, it seizes up.
Suburban
crashes into a car at the curb.
Yero bails out.
half out of his seat, a Galil in full auto on his shoulder,
hovering above Yero and the Suburban.
PA
(loud hailer)
Freeze!
You're under arrest.
Down
on your knees.
Put your hands on
your head...
CLOSE:
YERO
does none of that.
Enraged, he pulls up a 9mm H+K SMG to
fire up at the helicopter
ON TUBBS
aiming down at CAM.
The assault rifle unloads in three-shot
bursts.
OVER TUBBS DOWN TO YERO IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT
The pavement, the car and Yero are cratered by the 7.62mm
rounds.
Yero goes down.
Dead.
HELICOPTER
lands.
Tubbs bails, grabbing his duffle bag and the rifle and
turns down the street towards the firefight and Crockett...
CUT TO:
holding Isabella down, FIRES past a Toyota.
It's turned into
a sieve.
He tells Isabella to stay behind the engine block.
Then he ASSAULTS the ambush.
SWITEK
is shot in the calf, spins, goes down, gets up, limps to
cover, keeps firing.
...taking and returning FIRE from Crockett and Zito and from
his left flank from the SWAT team on the bridge...knows every
moment more he's here, more MPD assets are coming in.
He
wants to finish it faster.
LOW + WIDE:
COLEMAN
bails off the freighter onto the dock.
DARK-HAIRED ARYAN
BROTHER with a full auto AK is with him.
They move from
cover to cover, their heavy Kevlar body armor absorbing
rounds.
And they attack Crockett and Zito, who are
outgunned.
CROCKETT + ZITO
run for cover, fire three-shot bursts, run and cover.
But...
ISABELLA
runs from cover into the clear with her handgun firing at the
crazy whites, furious at the betrayal by Yero.
She's shouting
in Spanish.
It's insane.
CROCKETT
sees Isabella, moves.
COLEMAN
sees Isabella, swings his assault rifle onto her as...
CROCKETT
Isabella!!
CROCKETT RUNS
and sees Coleman because he's turned he's exposed his legs
and Crockett slows and blows Coleman's legs out from under
him.
Coleman's on the ground, scrambling for his rifle to
kill Isabella.
Dark-Haired NLR is pulling the trigger on
Crockett when BOOM...
TUBBS
fires the M40 grenade launcher loaded with shot.
Dark-Haired
NLR is nearly cut in half.
CROCKETT + ZITO
FIRE at the prone Coleman.
Coleman's dead.
WIDER:
THE FREIGHTERS - THE FIREFIGHT
continues as other NLR battle Miami SWAT.
Meanwhile...
CROCKETT
goes to Isabella, pulls her into the shadows away from
dockside, keeping her low, seemingly away from the police.
OK, how will they get out of here?
OVER CROCKETT + ISABELLA:
TUBBS
approaches from the left.
Tubbs and Crockett's eyes connect.
CLOSER:
TUBBS
sees his partner with this woman.
The frozen moment.
Isabella doesn't understand the changed expression on Tubbs'
face.
We do.
CROCKETT EYE TO EYE WITH HIS PARTNER
50 yards away.
All meaning is transmitted.
And Tubbs
nods...and the nod means:
"get her out of here..."
As Tubbs speaks into his radio, his right arm belted where it
was slashed, heading towards the diminished firefight, now
under MPD control, as...
CROCKETT RACES ISABELLA AWAY
through the weeds and scrap, away from the firefight, away
from the freighters, AWAY FROM THE POLICE.
Beyond them, we
hear the gunfight diminishing.
CUT TO:
enter from the rubble-filled industrial lot.
Cars have
stopped, their occupants seeking cover behind them.
Crockett
hesitates not at all.
He grabs a late '80's Mercedes left
with its door open.
Its owner, a middle-aged man at the
curb, starts to object.
Crockett raises his gun.
Owner
demurs.
Crockett steals away in it down the street into the
night, its lights off.
CUT TO:
swerves across three lanes, up on two wheels, almost rolls,
cuts off a semi, which barely recovers, and spins out onto
the shoulder, off the shoulder, down into the gravel.
It
comes to a stop and...
He floors the Mercedes.
It spins through 270 degrees,
scattering gravel and dust, and pulls back onto the freeway,
driving out of the city, away from Miami, out, into the
night.
CUT TO:
Nothing.
The cypress are silhouettes against a lighter mauve
sky.
Engine sound.
Then, the Mercedes enters and speeds
down the empty two-lane blacktop.
And at the end, the trees
open up and there's the open ocean and, beyond that, the
Florida Keys.
We see a house.
CUT TO:
