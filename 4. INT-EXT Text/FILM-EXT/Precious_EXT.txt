Blinding flashbulbs pop everywhere.
Precious walks the red carpet with Tom Cruise. They head
toward the entrance of the theatre stopping occasionally to
sign autographs. Both sport matching sunglasses. The
paparazzi is going wild.
THUNDER RUMBLES. Precious removes her sunglasses and searches
the sky.
A LIGHTENING CRACK ROARS. Rain starts to fall as ...

A young man exits the building smoking a cigarette. Mrs.
Lichenstein puts her hands together, dramatically pleads for
a smoke and gets one.
She puts it in her mouth and lights hers to his. Bouncing to
stay warm, she nods in gratitude as the man walks off.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
This bitch crazy. 'Sides, my muver
don't want to get cut off welfare
and that's what Mrs. Lichenstein
comin' to visit result in. It's
hard to believe a hoe dis retarded

The sun rises into the sky. The shadow of a tree draws

PRECIOUS' BEDROOM - DAY
22
The clock on the night stand reads 8:29.
We drift back to find Precious sitting on the side of her bed
fully dressed with neon yellow leggings and her red scarf as
she stares at the clock.
Various sheets of colored construction paper display
Precious' handprints on the wall. Their sizes increase
progressively and end beside a poster of Cyndi Lauper.
When the clock reads 8:30, Precious stands, looks in a
mirror, sees a pretty blond white girl and leaves the room.
23
24
We track with Precious as she exits her building. RUBY, A
DARK-SKINNED HEAVY-SET LITTLE GIRL WITH A "NATURAL" HAIRSTYLE
WHO COULD EASILY PASS FOR A YOUNGER PRECIOUS, trails
Precious. A naked blond armless Barbie doll dangles by it's
hair from Ruby's hand.
RUBY
Precious when we gon' play?
PRECIOUS
(without turning around)
Ain' you s'posed to be in school?
RUBY
You said we was gon' play.
PRECIOUS
See, thas jus exackly why we ain'

nuffin like it.
RUBY
Why not?
PRECIOUS
Cause you a mess. Look at ya' -no
style, no friends, no mama, no
daddy.
RUBY
So?! I ain' the only one.
Precious stops abruptly and turns around.
PRECIOUS
What you say?!
RUBY

PRECIOUS
Thas what I thought.
Precious heads away into the distance.
RUBY

Precious.
PRECIOUS (O.S.)
You do that.

Precious walks gazing upward.
Street lamps pass beneath the sky as autumn leaves fall from
nowhere.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
I'm lookin' up. Lookin' out for a
piano to fall, a desk, couch, TV,
Mama maybe? Always somethin' in the
way. Alternative. I'm gon' see all
about it.
BOY'S VOICE
Watch where you goin' Orca!
Precious looks down to find three skinny boys, each much
smaller than she, taunting her.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
Then my mind come back down to
Earf.
2ND BOY
Shut up fool, she gon' eat you.
The boys burst out in laughter slapping hands and grabbing
their crotches.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
Boyz always been little things that
laff and grab they selves -cept
for when I's real big and pregnant
wif my first baby. Then boyz don't
say nuffin. They stand out the way
real quiet like I'm Queen of
England...
Pointing at her leggings, the boys erupt some more.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
Still, I wonder...what could I wear
that boyz don't laff?
Precious crashes to the ground. The boys look surprised a
moment and then howl harder than ever.
PRECIOUS
I always be fallin like that when
my mind be wanderin. Mama say I
gonna fall to my death one day.
Wonder what that be like?

Precious walks amongst a crowd of people and stops to stare
at the Hotel Theresa, a beautiful pre-war building.

Precious walks with her hands in her pockets watching the
pavement pass beneath her.
PRECIOUS (V.O. CONT.)
...The tesses paint a picture of me
wif no brain. The tesses paint a
picture of me 'an my muver -my
whole family as less than dumb just
ugly black grease to be wiped away,
punished, caged up, kilt, changed,
finded a job for.
Precious leaves us behind.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
Sometimes I wish I was not alive. I
be O.K. I guess.

Precious walks briskly.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
The other day I cried, felt stupid.
Guess what...Fuck that other day.
Thas why God or whoever make new
days. Still hungry tho.
Precious stops and looks up at something.
Before her stands a fast food restaurant with a giant sign
atop it that says KICKIN FRIED CHICKEN.
Precious looks around, takes a deep breath and steps inside.

Precious bursts out of the restaurant with the bucket under
one arm and sprints off down the block.
A SCREAM from inside follows.
WOMAN (O.S.)
REGGIE!!! GET HER!!!
A second later, Reggie, the young man who cleaned the glass,
dashes out after Precious.
Precious looks back while sprinting and scarfing down pieces
of chicken at a remarkable rate.
Across the street, SHEILA, Reggie's pregnant girlfriend,
screams at him.
SHEILA
Reggie, where you been? I've been
paging your tired ass all night.
Reggie stops dead in his tracks. Shit! Busted. He lights up a
cigarette, about faces and prepares for her rant.
SHEILA
Nigga, I knew that was you. And who
you running after, some fat bitch.
Get your ass over here.
Precious turns the corner of 126th street and onto Clayton
Powell Jr. Boulevard still devouring chicken.
A SKINNY DISHEVELED MAN sitting on a standpipe calls out to
her.
SKINNY MAN
You gon catch indigestion Mommie.

Precious finishes off the chicken at the exact moment she
reaches the Hotel, stuffs the bones and basket into a trash
bin and dashes into the building.

Precious walks off alone still beaming from the new world she
has discovered.

RECIOUS (V.O.)
Before, I got A minus in English

The ghostly image of Ms. Rain appears on the sidewalk ahead
of Precious. It is a glimpse from back in the classroom. Her
voice ECHOES.

MS. RAIN (V.O.)
The longest journey begins with
a single step...
Ms. Rain vanishes and Precious shakes her head.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
...Whatever the fuck that spozed to

But this not Star Trek neitha'.
Precious continues into the distance.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)

Precious heads into the main entrance holding Abdul and her
bags as snowflakes start to fall.

Precious bursts out of the stairwell with blood streaming
down her nose and Abdul in her arms. Ruby dashes to intercept
them.
RUBY
Precious what happened?
Ruby places herself between Precious and the door while
moving. Precious however, is in a big hurry.
RUBY
Precious, could I see your baby now?
I just wanna see.
Precious shows no sign of slowing down. Ruby looks concerned.
RUBY
Precious, what's wro...
Precious knocks Ruby out of her way and to the floor without
losing stride.
Ruby lands hard and CRIES loudly.

Abdul still in her arms, Precious heads away from the
building under dressed.
The falling snow has thickened considerably.
As she makes her way into the distance, Precious walks into
the snowstorm carrying Abdul.

She hears the sound of a choir. She approaches the Church
Basement where the voices are coming from.
Precious stares through the window where Choir members are
praising The Lord.

Precious sits on the steps of a hospital. Snow still falling.
She looks confused.

Precious
is dressed in a hospital gown and draped in a wool
blanket.
It is still snowing. John holds an umbrella over
Precious
and a bag in one hand as he escorts her out onto the
driveway
and into a large gray van.
John places the bag in the van, hugs Precious, closes the
door and then waves as the van pulls away.
Precious turns to watch him recede into the snow through the
back window.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
Nurse John say lots of people get
out of hospital wif no place to go.
His eyes look worried tho ...Wonder
what next? Scared now.

A larger Abdul steps towards us with Precious behind him
wearing a cotton dress that looks vaguely like one Ms. Rain

Our young ladies and Ms. Rain are seated around a picnic

all at the same time. Precious has found friends.

Pouring through the "J" files, Precious stops at Jones and

Ms. Weiss steps in.
Precious is now seated on the couch again with a corner of

Ms. Weiss hands Precious her soda.
PRECIOUS

Precious, wearing her new scarf and glasses, sits in the
waiting room holding a book in her hands. Abdul plays among
the little children in the kids area behind her. Crumpled
wrapping paper lays beside her. The book's first page reads:
CONGRATULATIONS PRECIOUS! I'M SO PROUD OF YOU YET AGAIN.
LOVE, MS. RAIN
Sheila and Ruby walk in and sit down beside Precious. Ruby
has a black eye. They sit in silence for a few moments,
waiting for their turn.

Sheila heads up the stairs toward the offices. Precious
closes her book. Its cover reads: Chrystal Stair: Selected
Works by Langston Hughes.
SECRETARY

Clareece Precious Jones!
Mrs.
Weiss is ready for you.
Precious stands up and looks down at Ruby, sulking in her
chair. She leans down, gives her a big hug and tenderly
fixes Ruby's hair.
Precious walks off toward the stairs, but stops when she
passes a mirror hanging on the wall. Within the reflection,
she sees her true self for the first time.

She then reaches up and hugs Precious tightly.

frequently imagined herself as gradually transform into the
real Precious one by one.

We tilt down upon a stately pre-war building bathed in stark

Precious walks down the crowded street carrying Mongo and
