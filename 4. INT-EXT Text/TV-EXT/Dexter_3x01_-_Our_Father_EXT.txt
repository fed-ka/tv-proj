    Dexter s car comes to a stop sign in this rougher side of 
    student housing near the University of Miami.  There, 
    through shimmers of heat, is a pink bungalow at the end of 
    the street.  (This shot will be reprised later.)  He goes 
    forward and pulls up.  Grabbing a paper bag, he gets out.  A

    As Dexter heads for the pink house, he reaches into the bag 
    and comes up with an Oreo.  Twisting it apart, he scrapes 
    the white filling off with his teeth and tosses the cookies 
    into the gutter.  WENDELL (15) appears from nowhere.  He s

    Deb fumes.  She s about to speak, when -

                                        DEXTER
                        Deb, listen.  I m in a whole  nother 
                        place when it comes to Dad.  I m

    An awkward brother-sister moment.  Dexter breaks the ice.

                        By the way, sorry I didn t notice your

    Deb s still tense, suspicious.

                        ... it s beautiful.

    Deb unclenches.  Almost smiles.

                        Really?  Beautiful?  You said the word

    He lifts her shades.  Sees her reddened eyes.

                        Looks like you honored Dad for both of

    She nods to Batista.  Also wearing shades, he pops two 
    aspirin.

                        Prado case and put me on this...

    She gestures to a partially-clad female, face-down in the 
    bushes.

    They move to the inner circle.  Batista comes up.

    He gestures to two hookers being interviewed by a Uniformed 
    Cop.  A squad car slides up, its siren WHOOPING.  Batista 
    acts like his hungover brain is going to explode.

                                        BATISTA
                        Madre de dios!  Turn that thing off!

    Dexter starts toward the dead girl.

                        We ll, uh, work quietly.

    He kneels next to the body.  Masuka starts to speak.

    Deb hovers as Masuka gestures to the girl s neck.

                                        MASUKA
                        Strangled.

    Masuka turns the body over.

                        Because of this.

                        Looks like the evil-doer had an 
                        agenda.

                        Maybe it was a tattoo or something.

                                        BATISTA
                        Whatever.  Dex, we need to know if 
                        this was ante or post-mortem.

    Deb, still annoyed with Batista, moves away.  As she does, 
    Dexter s gaze shifts from the mutilated shoulder to the 
    girl s face.  He draws a quick breath of recognition.

    The victim is Teegan, Freebo s coked-out Coed girlfriend, 
    complete with the purple streak in her blonde hair.

    ON DEXTER.  Intrigued, excitement growing.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Freebo s still in Miami.

    A slight grin creases his lips.  He raises his camera to 
    hide his face, and clicks off a few shots.


    Dexter studies Teegan s crime scene photos on his laptop.   
    He taps a few keys and Freebo s image comes up.

    ON DEXTER.  Back in his comfort zone.

    He looks through the blinds, sees LaGuerta leave her office.


    Deb pulls up.  There s Yuki, perky and bright.

                                        DEBRA
                        You so have the wrong person.

                        Oh, there s a good reason Quinn s of

                        When I said you had the wrong person?  
                        I meant me.  These people aren t just 
                        badge numbers to me.  They re my 
                        friends; my family.

    And just like that, Yuki s lightness evaporates.

                                        YUKI
                        Ssh, you hear that?  That s the sound 
                        of your shield calling for help.

    She goes.  Deb looks after her, then heads for the bar.


    Dexter sits in his car, thinking.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Harry said that what was inside me 
                        would be there forever... and that I 
                        wouldn t be able to change.  

    He steps out of the car, breathes in the night air.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        He was half-right...
