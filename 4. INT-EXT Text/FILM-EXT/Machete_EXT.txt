A group of ILLEGALS hunker down in the brush, creeping in the
moonlight.
One of them coughs and seizes, obviously sick. Another points
at a WATER STATION up ahead, pulling the sick man along.
Headlights of a large TRUCK appear over a ridge. A spotlight
scans the brush, catches them. ARMED MEN ride in the bed of
the truck.

The burly driver, VON, shifts into gear and barrels down.

LUZ
He's a fat fuck, don't do nothing
and eats all day, like my last

Thank god. Why buy the pig when I

Machete takes the food, steps aside.
Men circle in an alleyway, laying money down on the ground,
placing bets on the two fighters in the makeshift ring.
One is a brawny thug with a neck like a tree trunk. The other
is strong, but not big.
Brawny Thug makes quick work of his opponent. The men cheer.
Brawny Thug's HANDLER coaxes the crowd for another opponent.
Machete walks into the alley. Brawny Thug points at him.

sunglasses steps out, still in the shadows, watching from a
distance.
Machete and the brawny thug fist fight bareknuckled. Brawny
gets in several good punches, knocking Machete about, but

his and walks off around the corner.
Machete is followed by two of Brawny's gangster friends.
Another steps in front of him.
BRUNO
Hey man, that was some good work
back there. Let me borrow some
money.
Machete walks around him. Bruno blocks his path and
sticks a Glock in Machete's face.
BRUNO (CONT'D)
Hand it over.
The two gangsters behind Machete pull switchblades.
GANGSTER ONE
Don't make us carve you up farmer.
A standoff as Machete stares. They all turn when they hear...
LUZ
I do the carving around here
pendejos.
BRUNO
(SPANISH)
What the fuck is this? Get back to
the kitchen chica.
Luz drops her apron and gives them an eyeful. Her tan body is
barely covered in cut offs and a blouse. She makes Daisy Duke
look like Jabba the Hutt.
A CLEAVER is in her manicured hand. She waves him over.
LUZ
Come to mami.
Gangster One lunges at her. Luz chops into his shoulder
Bruno is distracted, Machete grabs his gun;beats him with it.

BENZ (CONT'D)
Get in.
Luz watches Machete leave.
The Benz parks underground. They take a freight elevator up
to the office.
Machete walks past, the briefcase in one hand, rifle case in
the other. Families have gathered on the front steps after a
baptism. PADRE shakes hands with the parishioners. Seems to
recognize Machete, but when he looks again, Machete's gone.
Machete steps up to the taco truck and sets the locked
briefcase on the counter.
LUZ

You still owe me, amigo. Two tacos
y cafe. What's this?
MACHETE
Collateral.
Machete walks away.
Trucks and military surplus vehicles are lining up and moving
out.
VON, driving a big truck, prepares to leave the premises.
Shades and a cigar. MAN riding shotgun looks uncomfortable.
MAN
Maybe we shouldn't be doing this,
Von. Not with the heat we're under.
VON
"Congress shall make no law
abridging the right of the people
peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a
redress of grievances." Do you know
what that's from?
MAN
The Constitution?
VON
The First Fuckin Amendment
"Congress shall make no law
abridging the right of the people
peaceably to assemble, and to
petition the Government for a
redress of grievances." I would
like to assemble peaceably as I
have some grievances to redress.
Now is that all right with you?
Man stands down. Puts on his cap. It says "FREEDOM FORCE."
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 19.
The trucks roll out.
Machete in JANITOR uniform pushes a mop and bucket to the
elevator and steps inside.
A woman in a business suit, hair pinned back and glasses
stops the elevator door.
WOMAN
You!
Machete freezes.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
You're not Cisco. You're new here,
aren't you? Well, one of the
toilets in the ladies' is busted
again, and you need to clean it up

The citizen militia led by Von carry signs of support for
McLaughlin and other anti-immigration slogans. They wear caps
marked "FREEDOM FORCE."
Across the street, a counterprotest group assembles with
signs of their own. Luz's TACO TRUCK is there.
SPEAKER
We're at a crossroads in this great
land, and one man has the vision to
see us into the future.
MILITIA MAN
(APPLAUDING)
Our man's up next.
VON
It's a great day in America, Amen.
Benz stands among the crowd, the brim of a cowboy hat shading
his eyes.
SPEAKER
Please join me in welcoming our
great State Senator John
McLaughlin!
McLaughlin stands at the podium. Behind him hangs a banner:
LAND OF THE FREE, NOT THE FREELOADERS. The crowds punctuate
his speech with cheers.
MCLAUGHLIN
Make no mistake, my friends: We are
at WAR. Every time an illegal
sneaks across the border by dark of
night it is an act of aggression
against the United States. And I
submit to you, it is an overt act
of TERRORISM. These people are
TERRORISTS.
Cheers swell in the crowd, spiked with boos and jeers from
across the street.
Machete readies the sniper rifle and aims down at his target.
Something catches his eye-a glint of a reflection-as he spots-
...
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 21.
ANOTHER SNIPER across the way, aiming another SNIPER RIFLE
directly at HIM.
MACHETE lets off two quick rounds and the SNIPER lets off
three shots in rapid succession and one of them catches
Machete in the shoulder. He flips onto his back and out of
the other sniper's line of sight.
Down below, Machete's bullet has grazed McLaughlin's cheek.
The second bullet has shattered McLaughlin's shin. The throng
scrambles for cover as armed guards draw their weapons and
scan the skies.
Frantic down there, as a fight breaks out between Von's anti-
immigration militia and pro-immigrant protesters.

One of the cops cuffs him and shoves him into the backseat of
a patrol car.

if we don't get him out of here
now.
The patrolmen drive away; A TV CREW spots them and jumps
into their van to give chase.
TV VAN jerks to a halt and the cameraman gets footage of the
cop car wreckage and of Machete miraculously walking away.

Machete and Booth fight on the roof.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 78.
Machete and Booth roll off a roof and tumble into the pitbull
pit, fighting each other as the dogs fight. The men around
them start placing bets on Machete and Booth.
Booth cuts one of the men and the pitbulls go after him.
Booth escapes from the circle and carjacks a woman.
He kicks her out of the car and speeds towards the Armory.
BENZ
(DIALING PHONE)
Von! Von!
Machete comes out of the alleyway. His buddies in their Road
Warrior rides swing by and pick him up.
MACHETE
Follow him.
Elektra enters. Place looks deserted again.
ELEKTRA
Shit. I don't even want to know who
she's fucking now.
Militiamen guard the gate.
Booth barrels towards the gate.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 80.
He spins out and gets out of the car.
BENZ
Shut the gate quick! He's after me!
Some of the men shut the gate. Booth approaches Von.
BENZ (CONT'D)
He killed McLaughlin. He's coming
after me.
VON
And you led him right to Papa Von.
That's some kind of thank you.
BENZ
I saw to it that McLaughlin gave
you the keys to this fortress. You
owe us.
VON
The senator, maybe. But what
exactly do I owe you, turncoat?
BENZ
What are you talkin--
VON
You held the hand that held the
gun, Booth. Just as good as you
killed him.
Booth lunges for him but the other militia men hold him back.
VON (CONT'D)
Put the traitor in the brig.
They lead Booth away, kicking and spitting.
BENZ
You can't do this to me, Von! You
need me!
ROAD WARRIOR vehicles barrel towards the armory.
They're driving a semitruck --
It crashes through the front gate, then spins as --
The backdoor of the semi trailer rolls up revealing
A TRICKED OUT MOTORCYCLE
--as Machete rides it out.
Machete's army of workers stream out from their road warrior
chop shop rides.
Machete dismounts. His army behind him.
He raises his MACHETE against the sun and his army all raise
theirs.
Big battle sequence as they storm the armory. Knives and
guns... a ballet of bullets and blood.
LUZ arrives in one of the HOT RODS from the chop shop. She
has a MACHETE GUN that shoots out Machete blades like a
Machine gun.
A minuteman grabs her from behind, but..
He is STABBED in the CALF by Pancho! A METAL HARNESS onhis
back holds a sharp KNIFE that he stabs with.
The minuteman falls, Pancho stabs him in the face.
Luz leads a gang of her customers into the battle.
Minutemen and Mexicanos of all walks of life--janitors,
gardeners, laborers, gangbangers, etc.--fight it out at the
armory. Fighting it out with the implements of their trade--
knives hidden in mops, a weedwhacker attack, etc.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 82.
A wailing AMBULANCE CRASHES through a gate running down
minutemen. DOC FELIX and his sexy NURSE get out and help a
wounded Mexican. Doc flicks a SCALPEL at an approaching Goon.
Machete unveils a Gatling Gun with a special mount that
affixes to the front of the chopper.
Booth scrambles to arm himself, but he's cornered. He tries
to take cover behind thugs, but--
Machete on the motorcycle with the Gatling Gun mows down
Booth, machine gunning him in half.
Booth looks down at his own white shirt, now stained crimson
and ripped to shreds as he falls to the ground in TWO PIECES.
While the battle between chopshoppers and militia rages on--
TORREZ appears with ELEKTRA--
TORREZ
Machete!
Machete stops, turns to see Elektra, bound and gagged in
Torrez's control.
TORREZ (CONT'D)
You never learned to stay down,
pendejo. I killed you once. I can
do it again.
Machete drives his Gun Bike south.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 84.
COP LIGHTS appear behind him.
He pulls over.
The Officer walks up. His flashlight blinds him.
MACHETE
What's the problem officer?
The Officer just stands there, silent, his flashlight
blinding in Machete's eyes.
MACHETE (CONT'D)
Let me give you my ID.
Machete reaches for his knife: then he sees the cops shoes;
RED STILETTOS; It's ELEKTRA.
ELEKTRA
What's your name?
MACHETE
Machete.
ELEKTRA
I called in some favors. Look at
this. All the right papers; a real
identity. You could start over, be
a real person.
She puts the green card in his hand. Machete looks at it,
then crumbles it and drops it.
MACHETE
Why do I want to be a real
person... when I'm already a myth?
ELEKTRA
Where will you go?
MACHETE
Torrez was just an errand boy. I'm
going to find the man who sent the
message.
Elektra steps into the headlights. She's dressed in hot COP
LINGERIE.
ELEKTRA
I'll ride with you.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 85.
They kiss.
CUT TO BLACK
FADE UP
Machete and Elektra drive away on the gun bike.
The cop car abandoned on the side of the road; lights still
flashing.
FADE OUT
DISSOLVE TO:
DESERT - NIGHT.
A family of illegals crossing the border in the desert, see a
WATER STATION up ahead. They make for it, opening it up and
drinking heavily from the water supply. A BULLET brings one
of them down and the others scramble for safety but there's
someone out there, shooting at them.
MOTHER hushes the younger ones.
MOTHER
Say a prayer to El Machete to
protect you.
The younger ones start to pray.
A JEEP patrols the area and we see it's MINUTEMEN taking
potshots at the illegals.
MILITIA MAN
Did you get `em?
2ND MINUTEMAN
I don't know. They're like brown
jackrabbits. Let's see if they'll
show their little white tails.
Flicks on a highpowered light by the side mirrors on the
JEEP.
The light is on long enough to illuminate a MACHETE BLADE
coming straight for them.
MILITIA MAN
Holy shit!
His words gurgle in his throat as his head is severed from
his body. 2nd MINUTEMAN freaks and makes a run for it.
RNewman / Endeavor Draft 86.
Stumbles in the dark, in the dust. Scrambles but can't get to
his feet as he sees the outline of a DARK FIGURE above him.
Young illegals' prayers continue as the MACHETE comes down on
2nd MINUTEMAN.
Sounds of struggle, slaughter... then silence.
MACHETE
Light a candle... Say a prayer...
Young illegal opens eyes...
There's a glass candle in his hands, but no one else around.
Instead of Christ or a Virgin on the candle is a silhouette
of MACHETE...
CUT TO BLACK.
Machete
