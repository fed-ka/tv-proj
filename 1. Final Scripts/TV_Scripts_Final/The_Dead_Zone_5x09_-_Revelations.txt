  11EXT. FAITH HERITAGE - DAY

          A beautiful day.

          Reverend Purdy stands proudly on the steps of a new
            building.  A large WHITE RIBBON ties the entrance.  He
            addresses a crowd.

                                        PURDY
                          ...Today, Faith Heritage continues
                        to grow - thanks in no small part
                        to the generosity of one very
                        special person, the late Vera
                        Smith.  If you'll allow a personal
                          reflection...

          Purdy makes eye contact with Johnny, as we see how
            emotional he's becoming.

                                        PURDY
                                (emotional beat)
                        Vera wasn't simply a lover of
                        literature and art.  She was also
                        passionate about life.  She was
                        the kind of woman who brought
                        love and joy into the lives of
                          everyone close to her, and I miss
                        more with every passing day.

          Purdy smiles at Johnny who, frankly, is a little uneasy
          with such intimate comments made about his mother in such
          a public forum.  In fact, it's kind of a creepy moment
          for everyone involved.

                                        PURDY
                                (back on text)
                        I'm also honored to introduce
                        someone else who was very close
                        to Mrs. Smith.  Her only child,
                        Johnny Smith.

          Polite APPLAUSE.

          JOHNNY

          Sitting next to Bruce.

                                (aside)
                        Stand up and wave to the people.

          Johnny offers an uncomfortable smile and wave.

                                        PURDY
                        John, I know your mother is smiling
                        down on us today.  So, without
                        further to do, I am proud to
                        officially open the "Vera Smith
                          Library."  May it bring knowledge
                        and enlightenment to all who enter.

          Purdy cuts the ribbon with scissors.  More APPLAUSE.

                                        BRUCE
                        Didn't this just used to be a
                        place of worship?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What, your chapel back home doesn't
                        have instantaneous translation in
                        40 languages?

                                        BRUCE
                        The chapel back home doesn't have
                        indoor plumbing.

          People begin to surge past them towards the entrance of

          the building.  Someone in the crowd BUMPS into Johnny and -


  22INT. SOMEWHERE DARK - VISION

          Whoosh!  It's hard to decipher where we are.  Purdy's on
          his knees.  Crying.  Sweating.  Mouth crimson with blood.

                                        PURDY
                        Is this what you came to do?! 
                        Then do it!  I deserve it! 

          A woman, JESSICA, 40s, stands above him.  Stone-faced. 


  33EXT. FAITH HERITAGE - DAY

          RESUME on Johnny, concerned.  He takes a quick look around
          at the crowd.  Searching.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's wrong?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Purdy.

                                        BRUCE
                        What about him?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Someone's going to hurt him.

                                        BRUCE
                        Who?

          Johnny SPINS, anxiously looking, then --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Her.

          JESSICA, the young woman from Johnny's vision approaches
          Purdy.  Johnny squeezes quickly through the crowd,
            following her.

          ANOTHER ANGLE - PURDY

          He greets people as they enter the library.  Johnny's
          about to stop the woman when she reaches Purdy.  Johnny
          hangs back behind a hedge.

                                        PURDY
                          Welcome.

                                        JESSICA
                          Reverend Purdy.  My name is
                          Jessica.

                                        PURDY
                        It's very nice to meet you,
                          Jessica.

                                        JESSICA
                        I've been wanting to meet you for
                        a long time.

          Even Purdy begins to feel the undercurrent of something
          strange.

                                        PURDY
                              (a beat)
                        I must say, you do look slightly
                          familiar.

                                        JESSICA
                          I should.  I'm your daughter.

          Off Purdy's look of shock and Johnny's surprise, we -

                                                                              FADE OUT.

  44EXT. FAITH HERITAGE - MOMENTS LATER

          A BUBBLING FOUNTAIN

          Purdy and Jessica speak privately.  Johnny speaks with
          Bruce off to the side, keeping his eye on them.

                                        BRUCE
                        Are you sure you heard her right?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I was three feet away.  She said
                        she was his daughter.

                                        BRUCE
                        It's hard to imagine Purdy knocking
                        boots with anyone, much less having
                        a kid.  What do you think she
                        wants?

                                        JOHNNY
                          I dunno.  Money, salvation...
                        money.

                                        BRUCE
                        You said money twice.

                                        JOHNNY
                              (a knowing look)
                        Did I?

          AT THE FOUNTAIN

          Jessica clutches a piece of paper.  She's nervous.

                                        JESSICA
                          I realize this must be awkward
                        for you.  I thought about
                        writing...

          Purdy can see how nervous she is.

                                        PURDY
                        Your hands are trembling.

          Jessica tries not to cry.

                                        JESSICA
                        I promised myself I wouldn't do
                        this.  I even wrote down what I
                        was going to say.

    4CONTINUED:4

                                        JESSICA (CONT'D)
                        Pretty stupid, huh?

            Embarrassed, she rips up her speech.

                                        JESSICA
                        I don't want anything from you. 
                        I mean, I have a life.  Kind of.

          Purdy exudes empathy, as if helping a lost child.

                                        PURDY
                        Jessica... if I may be so bold?

          She nods.

                                        PURDY
                        I trust what your heart wants,
                        but what you're saying simply
                        isn't possible.

          She hesitates, then pulls out a check and hands it to
          Purdy.

                                        JESSICA
                          I receive one of these every month,
                        I have for most of my life.  They
                        come from you, don't they?

          Purdy is taken aback.

                                        JESSICA
                        And there's this.

          Jessica pulls a PHOTO out of her purse and shows it to
          Purdy.  While we don't see it, Purdy's face goes white. 
          An entire past life washes over him.

                                        JESSICA
                        You recognize it, don't you?

          His expression says he does.

                                        PURDY
                                (beat)
                        Why did you wait so long to contact
                        me?

          ON JOHNNY AND BRUCE

          Puzzled, as Purdy talks with Jessica.

                                        BRUCE
                        What are you going to do?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Only thing I can.  Tell him what
                        I saw.

                                        BRUCE
                        Good luck.

          Johnny walks over.  Purdy seems on edge as Johnny steps
          up to them.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me, Gene.  I was wondering
                        if we could talk?

                                        PURDY
                                (half stunned)
                        I'm sorry, Johnny, I'm in the
                        middle of something.  Can it wait?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Uh, actually...

          Purdy stands, awkward, between him and Jessica.

                                        PURDY
                        Where are my manners?  Jessica. 
                        Johnny Smith.  The new library is
                          dedicated to his mother.

          Johnny and Jessica size each other up.

                                        JESSICA
                        That must be very... satisfying.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yes, it is.

          An awkward PAUSE, then...

                                        PURDY
                                (to her)
                        Well, I think we should go inside
                        and continue our conversation. 
                        Excuse us.

          Purdy gestures Jessica into the building, she looks back
          at Johnny.

                                        JESSICA
                        It was nice meeting you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Right.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT ONE - 7/1/05 - BLUE 7.

          She walks away, as Purdy starts off behind her.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene?

                                        PURDY
                        I don't have time right now.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You need to make time.

          Purdy STOPS and looks back...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I had a vision.  You were in
                        danger.  And that woman was with
                        you.

                                        PURDY
                                (confused)
                        What kind of danger?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure.  You were down on
                        your knees.  You were bleeding.

          Purdy considers this, then --

                                        PURDY
                        Is that all?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is that all?  Gene, you know I'm
                        right about the things I see. 
                        Maybe you should stay away from
                        her until you get proof she's who
                        she claims to be.

          Purdy realizes Johnny overheard them talking.

                                        PURDY
                        Thank you for your concern, but I
                        can handle this.

          Purdy walks away.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene?

          He just keeps walking.  Bruce approaches.

                                        BRUCE
                        Well?

                                        JOHNNY
                        He blew me off.

                                        BRUCE
                        You told him about what you saw?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I told him.  There's something
                        very strange about this.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's 'strange' is you worrying
                        about a guy you haven't trusted
                        since you came out of your coma.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's complicated.  He helped my
                        father when he was in trouble.  I
                        can't turn my back on him.

          Johnny suddenly notices a small piece Jessica's ripped
          piece of paper on the ground.  He picks it up, holds it. 
          The letterhead says THE ANTLERS INN.

                                        JOHNNY
                        "The Antlers Inn."

                                        BRUCE
                        That's a Bed & Breakfast on the
                        East side of town.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sounds like a place to start.

                                        BRUCE
                        Start what?

                                        JOHNNY
                        To figure out if this woman really
                        is who she claims to be.


  55INT. ANTLERS BED & BREAKFAST - DAY

          A moose head adorns the wall.  Johnny RINGS a bell on the
          counter.  A studious looking young woman appears, JOANNA
          (15).  She has shiny braces on her teeth.

                        Can I help you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I hope so.  We're looking for...

          Her eyes light up as she suddenly realizes who she's
          talking to.

                                        JOANNA
                        You're John Smith.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's right.

                                        JOANNA
                        That must make you Bruce Lewis.

                        Two for two.

                        Not exactly.

                        In a way.  We're looking for a
                        woman named Jessica.

                        We think she stayed here last

          She checks the register.

                        She was here.  Paid cash and
                        checked out before breakfast.

                        Not that she wrote down.
                                (she gets an idea)
                        Hey, will you guys pose for my
                        web page?  It'll really freak out
                        the bloggers.

          She grabs a digital camera from under the desk.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gee, y'know, I'm not really
                          comfortable with that kind of
                        publicity.

          Her raw excitement is quickly replaced with a look of
          cold rejection.

                                        JOANNA
                        Oh, sure, I understand.  You want
                        to keep things on the down low.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Exactly.
                                (awkward beat)
                        So, I was wondering if we could
                        see her room?

                                        JOANNA
                        Her room?  Oh, the girl with no
                        last name.  Sounds pretty
                        important?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It could be.

          She just stares at them, as --

                                                                          HARD CUT TO:


  66INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Johnny and Bruce are blinded by a camera FLASH.  Joanna
          lowers her digital Nikon, once again filled with geeky
          excitement.

                                        JOANNA
                        Okay, one more.  This time stand
                        back to back.  And fold your arms.

          They reluctantly strike the pose.  FLASH!

                        Key?  Oh, right, sure.

          She hands them a room key and walks away checking the
          camera.

                                        JOANNA
                        Just drop it on the desk on your
                        way out!  I'm gonna run this
                        through PhotoShop and get it posted

          Johnny uses the key to open the door, as they enter --


  77INT. ANTLERS BED & BREAKFAST BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny touches around the room, then the bed and -- WHOOSH:


  88INT. ANTLERS BED & BREAKFAST - BEDROOM - LAST NIGHT

            Jessica's crying.  Her suitcase is on the bed; she packs
          her things.  The photo she showed to Purdy is about to go
          into the suitcase when FREEZE:

          Johnny takes a close look.  It's a black and white PHOTO
          of a WOMAN, 20s and a LITTLE GIRL at a carnival.  A Ferris
          Wheel behind them.  There's a town WATER TOWER in the
          background.  Stenciled on the tower is: "Lewiston, Maine."

          Johnny comes out of the vision, turns to Bruce.

                        The photograph she showed Purdy. 
                        It was a woman and a little girl
                        at a carnival.

                                        BRUCE
                        Why would that bother him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Good question. 
                              (a beat)
                        You up for a road trip?


  1010EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

          Grain silos dot the landscape.  Johnny and Bruce drive
          past acres of symmetrical fields.

                                        BRUCE (V.O.)
                        Reminds me of Indiana without the
                        corn.  And the basketball.

          They pass a sign proudly displaying:  "Lewiston, Maine."


  1111INT.  LEWISTON CITY HALL - DAY

          A small, brick building.

            A crotchety, old RECEPTIONIST, a name-tag reads:  "Mabel." 
          She's deep into a saucy romance novel.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Hello... Mabel?  My name's Johnny
                        and this is Bruce.  We're looking
                        for a woman - a local resident
                        named Jessica.

                                        MABEL
                        Last name?

                                        JOHNNY
                        We hoped you might tell us.

                                        MABEL
                                  (sarcastic)
                        No last name?  Okay, then.  Just
                        give me a minute and I'll look up
                          Jessica.  Or maybe I should try
                        Bill?  Or Bob, or Susie, or
                          Cindy...

                        Okay, we get it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What about a carnival that came
                        through town?  Would've been about
                          twenty-five years ago.

          Bruce can see that they're losing her, so he jumps in...

                                        BRUCE
                          Twenty-five years?  Dude, how's
                        she going to remember something
                        that far back?  Heck, she would
                        have only been a little girl.

          Johnny looks at Bruce and realizes what he's doing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Y'know, you're right.  What was I
                          thinking?

                                        MABEL
                        Okay, cut the crap.  I know when
                        I'm bein' played.
                                (beat)
                          Besides, I wasn't a little girl...
                        I was a teenager.

          She breaks a creepy smile, as...


  1212EXT. LEWISTON CITY HALL - DAY

          Johnny and Bruce walk back to Johnny's Range Rover.  Bruce
          holds a handwritten map.

                                        BRUCE
                        You just have to know where a
                        woman's vulnerable. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's your secret, huh?

                                        BRUCE
                        That, and basic animal magnetism.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll have to remember that.  So,
                        how far to this Desmond Farm?

                                        BRUCE
                        Looks like five miles north.

          As Bruce and Johnny get in the Rover and drive off, a
          CLEAN CUT MAN sitting in a dark sedan watches them from
          across the street.  He pulls out and follows...


  1313EXT. DESMOND FARM - DAY

          Johnny and Bruce get out of the Rover in the middle of an
          barren field.  There's a WATER TOWER with the name
          'LEWISTON' stenciled across the side of it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        This is definitely where the
                        picture was taken.

          Johnny touches the tower.  Whoosh.


  1414EXT. DESMOND FARM, SUMMER, 1964 - DAY

          A SMALL carnival now occupies the space.  A TENT SHOW
          MIDWAY.  A CARNIVAL BARKER (20's) loud and energetic.

                                        CARNIVAL BARKER
                        Come witness the extreme, bizarre,
                        terrifying display of transformed
                          humanity.  See the Illustrated
                        Man, where every picture tells a
                        story; the Bearded Lady, the Strong
                        Man and Human Pin Cushion.  If
                        you're feeling lucky, spin the
                        Wheel of Fortune...

                                        YOUNG MINISTER (O.S.)
                          God-fearing citizens of Lewiston!  

          A YOUNG MINISTER, 20s, his back to Johnny, steps up on a
          wooden barrel, he holds a RED BIBLE up in the air.  Johnny
          tries to MOVE around to see his face, but keeps getting
          crowded out.

                                        YOUNG MINISTER
                        Turn away from this haven of sin! 
                        This man is an agent of the devil! 
                        The Lord sees all, including
                          abominations of the mind and the
                        flesh!

                                        CARNIVAL BARKER
                        Take your good book and your
                          religion somewhere else, Minister! 
                        This is a place of entertainment!  
                        These folks want to be dazzled
                        and amazed!

                                        CARNIVAL BARKER (CONT'D)
                        Not frightened and scolded!

                                        YOUNG MINISTER
                        He's right, friends!  This is no
                        place to bask in the warmth of
                        the Holy scriptures!  That's why
                        I'm invitin' every person within
                        the sound of my voice to come
                        witness the glorious work of the
                        Lord!  Who'll join me in humble
                        praise of God almighty?!

          The offer hangs in the air like the smell of hot roasted
          peanuts, until a young woman (who we will later know as
          CLARA, 20), raises her hand, inspired and steps forward
          out of the crowd.

                                        CLARA
                        I'll come, Minister...

                                        YOUNG MINISTER
                        Praise Jesus, sister!

          Even from across the midway, Johnny can tell she's taken
          by the young man holding the bible high. 


  1515EXT. DESMOND FARM - DAY

          RESUME: Johnny spins out.

                                        JOHNNY
                        The woman I saw in the picture. 
                        She was here.  At the carnival. 
                        There was a young Minister...

          A sound behind them as they TURN to SEE a battered Ford F-
          150 pickup drive up.  A thick young farmer, WALLACE (20s),
          gets out of the truck.  Shotgun in hand.  The truck's
          engine remains running.

                                        WALLACE
                        You two are trespassin' on private
                          property!

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry.  We didn't see any
                        signs.

                                        WALLACE
                        Saw the barb wire fence, didn't
                        ya?

                        Look, we didn't mean any harm.

                                        WALLACE
                        Then you won't mind gettin' back
                        in your fancy truck and drivin'
                        out the way you came in!

            Suddenly, the pickup's engine SPUTTERS and begins to SMOKE.

                                        BRUCE
                        Looks like you got other problems.

          Wallace TURNS, as he slips off his baseball cap and stares
          at the truck in disbelief.

                                        WALLACE
                        I'll be damned!  I just paid four
                        hundred dollars to have that engine
                          rebuilt.

          Johnny sees an opportunity.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Looks like you might have a loose
                          cylinder head.

          Wallace looks back, now less confrontational.

                                        WALLACE
                        You know somethin' 'bout truck
                          engines?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I had a jeep I used to work on. 
                        Same thing under the hood.

                                        WALLACE
                        Think you might take a look under
                        mine?

          Johnny looks at Bruce, then back at Wallace.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (confident smile)
                        Sure, why not?


  1616EXT. DESMOND FARM - DAY - SHORT TIME LATER

          Johnny pulls his soiled hands out of the truck's engine.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Go ahead, try it now!

    16CONTINUED:16

          Wallace turns the ignition as the engine starts.  It sounds
          fine.

                                        WALLACE
                        I'll be damned.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're gonna need to replace the
                        points and plugs.  She should be
                        alright until then.

                                        WALLACE
                        I don't know what t'say.  If
                        there's anything I can do for you
                        boys.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually, we're looking for
                          information on a carnival.  It
                        came through here in the late
                          sixties.

                                        WALLACE
                        Hell, I wasn't born 'til '82.  My
                        Grandpa used to rent out the land
                        'tween plantin' seasons, s'pose a
                          carnival could'a been here.

                                        BRUCE
                        What about a tent revival?

          Wallace breaks a knowing smile.

                                        WALLACE
                        That, I can help you with.


  1717INT. RUNDOWN BARN - LATER

          Wallace digs through a barn filled with tools and junk.

                                        WALLACE
                        Never saw it myself, Daddy used
                        to talk 'bout it.  Said he
                          witnessed the Lord's power that
                        summer.  Here it is.

          Wallace pulls down a small crate filled with a few items:
          a wooden cross, an old bible, a couple of candles.

                                        WALLACE
                        Apparently the minister just drove
                        off sometime durin' the night.

                        Be my guest.

          Johnny and Bruce look through the items.  Bruce opens an
          old bible, stuck between the pages is a POSTER, yellow
          with age.

                                        BRUCE
                        Check this.

            A picture of a young Minister.  He's holding the RED BIBLE
          from Johnny's vision.  A caption reads:  "MINISTER RAYMOND
          FRANKLIN."

                                        BRUCE
                        That guy looks familiar.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He should.  It's Purdy.

          Off the faded image of a Young Gene Purdy...

  1818EXT. BARN - DAY

          Johnny and Bruce walk and talk.

                                        BRUCE
                        I don't get it.  Why would Purdy
                        preach under an assumed name?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.

          RING.  Johnny answers his cell.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hello. -- Walt.

  1919INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

          Walt's on the phone, looking over a file in his office.

                                        WALT
                        I ran a check on Raymond Franklin. 
                        Nothing came up.  At least nobody
                        that lived in Maine in the mid-
                        60's.  Closest match was an "R
                          Franklin" who operated a private
                        hedge-fund in Rochester.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Hedge fund?
                                (beat, then...)
                        What's the name of the fund?

                                        WALT
                        Bethlehem.  It's called the
                          Bethlehem Fund.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to himself)
                        I'll be damned.

                                        WALT
                        You gonna tell me what this is
                        all about?

                        Just following some bread crumbs. 
                        Talk to you later.

          Hangs up.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It seems Raymond Franklin doesn't
                        exist.  At least not one that
                          preached under a tent. 

                                        BRUCE
                        Sure he does, only his name is
                        Gene Purdy.  You saw that poster.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, I saw it.

                                        BRUCE
                        So why don't you just ask him and
                        get it over with?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You were there.  You saw the way
                        he blew me off.  I come at him, I
                        better have more than a faded
                        poster.

                                        BRUCE
                        Which leaves us where?

          As Johnny ponders their next move --


  2020INT.  LEWISTON TOWN LIBRARY - DAY

          BZZT.  A whir of articles BLUR by the screen.

          We STOP on an article.

          A PHOTO - a group of performers pose at the carnival.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's a scary lookin' bunch.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Freaks.  Carnival-type, anyway. 
                        Wait.

          Johnny recognizes someone in the photo.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Right there.  That's the guy I
                        saw arguing with Purdy.

                        I mean, Franklin.

          A tall, thin Carnival Barker leans up against the carousel. 
          Smiling a sinister smile.  Bruce scans the text -

                                        BRUCE
                        Says the carnival went out of
                          business the summer of '64.  The
                        owner opened up a restaurant just
                        north of Lewiston.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know about you, but I'm
                          suddenly starving.


  2121INT. SMALL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          The SHOT starts TIGHT on the face of a bizarre looking,
          slightly demented, oversized CLOWN.  As the SHOT PANS
          across the room we realize it's a theme restaurant
          displaying carnival relics from yesteryear --the fortune
          teller display case, the strongman muscle-o-meter, the
          Wheel of Fortune, ETC.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        He would have been a barker for
                        your midway shows.

          The SHOT FINDS Johnny and Bruce seated at the counter
          talking with the OWNER.  They show him a copy of the photo
          they found at the library.

                                        OWNER
                        I can't place the face.  There
                        were so many rounders in those
                        days.  Most of 'em were runnin'
                        away from someplace... or somebody. 
                        And most of 'em didn't want to be
                        found.

                                        BRUCE
                        What about a Minister Franklin?

          The man's expression shifts...

                        Him, I remember.  Had a second
                        class tent revival.

                          Followed us that whole summer. 
                        Real fire 'n' brimstone act.

                        Damned if I know.  One day he
                        just disappeared.  Carnival closed
                        shortly after.  I always thought
                        we'd have had a few more years,
                        if it weren't for that damn
                          preacher. 
                                (notices new customers)
                        Excuse me.

          He walks away to help another customer.

                                        BRUCE
                        That doesn't help very much.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe we need spiritual guidance?

          Johnny notices the Wheel of Fortune and walks over to it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Last time I spun one of these was
                        the night of my accident.

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe you shouldn't tempt fate.

          Johnny notices the moustached Fortune Teller, his mannequin
          bust sits quietly behind glass.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Can't hurt to check my future,
                        can it?

          He pulls out a dime, pushes it into the slot.  As he pulls
          the lever down.  WHOOSH.

                        You know, 'iffy'?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, I don't know.  That's why I
                        asked.  What does 'iffy' mean?

          Bruce stops, he can see this isn't about him.  After a
          BEAT, so does Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (beat)
                        I've known Gene Purdy my whole
                        life.  At least, all of it I
                          remember.  Now I'm starting to
                        think I never knew the man at
                        all.

          POV - ACROSS THE STREET

          Johnny notices the same CLEAN CUT MAN from earlier stamp
          out a smoke and walk away.

                                        BRUCE
                        What's wrong?

                        That guy over there.  He was
                          watching us at City Hall.

          The guy disappears around a corner. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm gonna drop you off downtown. 
                        See if there's any public record
                        of that revival.  Something with
                        Franklin's signature.

                                        BRUCE
                        Where are you goin'?

                                        JOHNNY
                        See if I can find Clara Simon.


  2525EXT.  OLD HOUSE - NIGHT

          A long driveway leads to an old, New England colonial
          home.  Once magnificent, it's now fallen into disrepair.

            A mailbox reads:  "C.  Simon."

          Johnny walks through tall iron gates to the front door. 
          KNOCKS.  The door opens, and -

          Jessica answers.

                                        JESSICA
                                (surprised to see him)
                        Mister Smith? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        C. Simon.  Clara was your mother,
                        wasn't she?

          It's obvious she doesn't want to talk about this.

                                        JESSICA
                        This isn't a good time. 

          She starts to close the door, but Johnny stops it with
          his hand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can talk to me here alone, or
                        we can do it in Gene Purdy's
                          office... it's up to you.

    25CONTINUED:25

          Off Jessica's torn look...


  2626INT. CLARA'S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER

          A dark but massive home.  There's a long family history
          here, old money.  Johnny spots the photo of Jessica and
          her mother on the mantle.

                                        JESSICA
                        If the Reverend has questions, he
                        should ask me himself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I think he's afraid of you.  At
                        least, your motives.

                                        JESSICA
                        I don't understand.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene Purdy is an important man. 
                        And wealthy.

                                        JESSICA
                        You think this is about money?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Isn't it?

                                        JESSICA
                              (a beat)
                        I want to show you something.


  2727INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

          Jessica pulls a stack of CHECK STUBS from a desk and hands
          them to Johnny.

                                        JESSICA
                        I've been getting monthly checks
                        since I was three years old.  It
                        was only recently I found out
                        who's been sending them.

          Johnny sees where they're issued from -

                                        JOHNNY
                        The Bethlehem Fund.

    27CONTINUED:27

                                        JESSICA
                        My mother is dead.  My husband
                        ran off with another woman two
                        years ago.  And I'm not able to
                        have children.  I assure you this
                        is about much more than money. 

          Johnny hands the checks back to her and -


  2828INT. SOMEWHERE DARK - DAY

          Whoosh.  We spin around Jessica.  Purdy is kneeling down
          in front of her.  Shaking.  In pain.  Mouth crimson with
          blood.  Just like before.  He looks up at her:

                                        PURDY
                        Is this what you came to do?! 
                        Then do it!  I deserve it! 

          He bows his head, closes his eyes.  Prays.

                                        PURDY
                        "Though he slay me, I shall yet
                        trust Him..."

          And a sea of GRAIN rains down, suffocating him...


  2929INT. CLARA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Johnny SPINS out, his suspicions crystal clear. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why not take a DNA test?  Settle
                        it once and for all.

                                        JESSICA
                                (cold)
                        Our conversation is over.

          Johnny notices a RED BIBLE on her coffee table.  The same
          bible from his previous vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That red bible...

                                        JESSICA
                        It belonged to my mother. 

          Johnny picks it up -          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT TWO - 7/1/05 - BLUE 28.


  3030INT. CLARA'S HOME - NIGHT - 1964

          Whoosh!  We're in the same foyer that Johnny is standing
          in.  Young Purdy drops the red bible and kneels over the
          DEAD BODY of Clara Simon.  He checks her pulse. 

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        ... she's dead. 

          Young Purdy stares down at her open eyes.  Scared.

                                        CARNIVAL BARKER (O.S.)
                        Dead?  How can she be dead?  This
                        is not what we planned.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL 

          The Carnival Barker stands next to Purdy.

                                        CARNIVAL BARKER
                        You did this...

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        What?

                                        NOLAN
                        You killed her.

          He grabs his jacket and starts away. 

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        Where are you going?  Nolan?

                                        NOLAN
                        You better pray God is as forgiving
                        as you claim. 

          Nolan exits, as Young Purdy turns his attention to Clara
          Simon's lifeless body.

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        My God... what have I done?  

          Off` his look of inner torment... 


  3131INT. CLARA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Whoosh.  Johnny, stunned by what he's just seen.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm sorry, I've taken up too much
                        of your time. 

          And he leaves.          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT TWO  - 6/21/05 - WHITE 29.

  3333EXT. CITY HALL/INT. RANGE ROVER - NIGHT

          Johnny and Bruce outside City Hall.  They head for his
          car.

                                        BRUCE
                        Nolan accused Purdy of killing
                        Clara Simon?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah, and from the look on Gene's
                        face, he might have been right. 

                                        BRUCE
                        That explains why Purdy would
                        accept Jessica as his daughter. 
                        He doesn't want anybody asking
                          questions about her mother's death. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Purdy's a lot of things, but a
                          murderer?  

                                        BRUCE
                        I found some old tax records.  It
                        seems Clara Simon was loaded. 
                        Sound familiar?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You talking about my mother?

                                        BRUCE
                        Wealthy widow taken in by a
                          charismatic man of God.  It can't
                        be a coincidence... can it?    

          Angry, Johnny puts the Range Rover into drive -

                                        BRUCE
                        Maybe you should take a minute to
                        cool off?

          Johnny notices something in the rear-view mirror.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Sonofabitch!

          Bruce looks out the back.  A DARK SEDAN follows them.

                                        BRUCE
                        Same guy from before?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've had about enough of this.

          Bruce braces himself as Johnny SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.

          As it SCREECHES TO A SKIDDING STOP.  The DARK SEDAN also

          Johnny snaps his seat belt off and throws open the door.

                        John, where you goin'?

                                        JOHNNY
                        To see what this guy wants.

          Johnny gets out.


  3838EXT. RANGE ROVER - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny walks briskly towards the sedan.  The Clean Cut
          Man tries to back-up, but is blocked. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's your problem?!

          By now, Bruce is trailing quickly behind his friend.

                        questions.  Who sent you?

          Johnny reaches into the car and GRABS THE GUY -

          Whoosh!  The Clean Cut Man is parked at the same farm
          Johnny was at earlier, holding the revival poster.

          Purdy's face on the poster, as any trace of "Minister

  4040RESUME - EXT. LEWISTON ROADS - NIGHT

          Johnny SPINS out and lets go of the guy.

                                        BRUCE
                        What is it?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have to find Purdy.

          Off Johnny's look of resolve...


  4141INT. PURDY'S OFFICE, FAITH HERITAGE - NEXT DAY

          Purdy watches as Jessica stares out the window at the
            sprawling green campus at Faith Heritage. 

                                        JESSICA
                        This place is amazing.  So many
                        unusual things to see.

          Jessica notices a small carved WOODEN IDOL.

                                        PURDY
                          I brought that back from Senegal.
                                (off her confused
                                look)
                        That's in Africa.

                                        JESSICA
                        Oh.  Wow.

                                        PURDY
                        I did my missionary work there. 
                        The idol was a gift from the
                          children of the local tribe.  It
                        symbolizes trust and love. 

          Jessica hesitates, suddenly bothered by the situation,
          then... 

                                        JESSICA
                        I don't know if this was such a
                        good idea.

                                        PURDY
                        What do you mean?

                                        JESSICA
                        I don't want to be a burden to
                        you. 

          Purdy puts a hand on her shoulder.

                                        PURDY
                        There's a reason God has brought
                        us together.  I'd like you to
                        join me for services.

                                        JESSICA
                        You mean, church?

                                        PURDY
                        It's always been my sanctuary
                        during troubled times.

                                        JESSICA
                        I'm not really dressed for the
                          occasion.

                                        PURDY
                        You look just fine.

          She forces a small smile, as...


  4242INT.  CONGREGATION, FAITH HERITAGE - SHORT TIME LATER

          A full cathedral.  

          IN THE WINGS

          A pipe organ signals the beginning of the service. 
            Suddenly, an USHER approaches.  Whispers in Purdy's ear.

                                        PURDY
                                (to Jessica)
                        Excuse me for a moment.


  4343INT. SIDE HALL, FAITH HERITAGE - DAY

          Johnny waits in the side hall, looking worse for wear. 

                                        PURDY
                        Johnny?  The service is about to
                        begin.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know about Clara Simon.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT THREE - 7/1/05 - BLUE 35.


    43CONTINUED:43

          Purdy considers the implications, then...

                                        PURDY
                          I really have to go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What's going on, Gene?  Or should
                        I call you Raymond?

          Purdy pulls the door shut separating them from the
            congregation.

                                        PURDY
                          Whatever you think you know...
                        you're mistaken.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then tell me.

                                        PURDY
                        I... can't.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm trying to help you, for God's
                        sake.

                                        PURDY
                                (angry)
                          I didn't ask for your help!

          Purdy holds his anger, then turns to leave.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Don't walk away from me, Goddammit!

          Johnny grabs Purdy by the arm as, WHOOSH.


  4444EXT. CLARA'S HOME - DAY - 1964

          Young Purdy (as Minister Franklin) KNOCKS on Clara's front
          door.  Clara answers.  There are emotional sparks flying
          all over between these two.

                                        CLARA
                          Minister Franklin?  What a pleasant
                          surprise.

    44CONTINUED:44

          Young Purdy holds his hat in hand, as he nervously
            speaks... 

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                          I apologize for showing up
                          unannounced.  The thing is, I
                        was... Well, I was taken by you...
                                (awkward smile)
                          I should say, by your interest in
                        the scriptures.

                                        CLARA
                        I see. 

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        I wondered if, perhaps, I might
                        help you to better know the Lord. 
                        Through his teachings and gospels.

          It's much like a high school boy asking a pretty girl out
          on a first date. 

                                        CLARA
                        I'm flattered.  We don't get many
                          visitors anymore.

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        "We?" 

                                        CLARA
                          Jessica?  Come say hello to
                          Minister Franklin. 

            A 3-year-old LITTLE GIRL, Jessica, appears by Clara's
          side, tugging at her mother's skirt.

                                        CLARA
                        I'm afraid she's a bit shy when
                        it comes to meeting strangers.

          Young Purdy kneels down.

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        Hello, Jessica.  My, aren't you a
                          beautiful little girl?

          Purdy gently strokes her long blonde hair and smiles up
          at Clara.           DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT THREE - 7/1/05 - BLUE 37.


  4545RESUME - INT. SIDE HALL, FAITH HERITAGE - DAY

          Whoosh.  Johnny spins out of the vision.  Shocked.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Jessica isn't your daughter.  And
                        you know it.

                                        PURDY
                        This is none of your concern.

                                        JOHNNY
                        If you continue down this path,
                          something very bad is going to
                        happen.

                                        PURDY
                        I'm prepared to take that chance.

          Purdy opens the door to the congregation. 

          A PIPE ORGAN plays.  Purdy calmly takes Jessica's hand -
          and they walk onstage, together.

          Johnny watches from just outside, as THE DOORS SLOWLY
          CLOSE in front of him.

          Johnny follows Walt down the hall.

                        Purdy had me followed, he knows I
                        know the truth, but he won't talk
                        about it.

                                        WALT
                        Why didn't you tell me about all
                        this sooner?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know, I guess I thought
                        if I didn't say it, it might not
                        be real.

                                        WALT
                        Well, it's real alright.

                        answer now.

                                        WALT
                        I doubt it, considering that

          PANNING OFF A door that reads, PAROLE OFFICER S. JACOB...

          To FIND Johnny and Bruce sitting across from Jacob.  He's
          a civil servant burn-out.  Files and papers everywhere.

                        I can't release inmate files.

                        Which could make you an accessory.

          Officer Jacob thinks, then...

                                        OFFICER JACOB
                        Even if I tell you where we placed
                        Nolan, you won't find him.

                        Why not?

                                        OFFICER JACOB
                        Because he's gone.  He jumped his
                        parole two weeks ago.

          Johnny picks up a MUG SHOT of Edward Nolan as he looks
          today, 50s.

                        There was an unopened letter. 
                        But I can't let you read it.

          and Faith Heritage.  Purdy's face is circled in every
          picture and article.


  4949INT. PAROLE OFFICE - DAY

          Johnny flashes out of the vision, as he drops the letter
          on Jacob's desk.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.

          Johnny and Bruce step to the door.

                        Nolan's going after Purdy.          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT THREE - 7/1/05 - BLUE 40.


  5050EXT. HOTEL/INT. LIMO - NIGHT

          Purdy's limousine is parked in front.  Jessica sits in
          the back, she stares out the window.  She seems different,
          less sure of herself. 

                                        PURDY
                        Did you enjoy the service?

                                        JESSICA
                        It was beautiful.
                                (beat)
                        Johnny Smith came to see me.

                                        PURDY
                                (tries to remain cool)
                        Did he? 

            A moment.  Purdy reaches into his coat pocket.

                                        PURDY
                        I'd like to give you something.

          He offers her the African idol.

                                        JESSICA
                          Reverend, I can't take this.

                                        PURDY
                        And I can't think of anyone else
                        I'd want to have it.

          She seems genuinely moved by the gesture.

                                        JESSICA
                              (a beat)
                        You're not the person I expected. 
                        The person I made up in my head.
                                (suddenly emotional)
                        I'm sorry.  This was a mistake.

          Purdy watches as Jessica leaves the limo.


  5151INT. FAITH HERITAGE, PRAYER ROOM - NIGHT

          Purdy kneels in the front of the cathedral, head bowed. 
          He is the only one here.

                                        PURDY
                        "Our Father which art in heaven,
                          Hallowed be thy name.  Thy kingdom
                        come.  Thy will be done in earth,
                        as it is in heaven.  Give us this
                        day..."           DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT THREE - 7/1/05 - BLUE 41.


  5252INT.  FAITH HERITAGE - HALLWAYS - NIGHT

          Purdy walks alone, through the grand halls of the Church.

                                        PURDY (V.O.)
                        "And forgive us our debts, as we
                        forgive our debtors..." 

          The door to Purdy's office is OPEN.  Purdy stares at it,
          puzzled.  He enters.  Flips on the lights. 


  5353INT. PURDY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          It's a MESS.  His desk has been swept off onto the floor. 

                                        PURDY (V.O.)
                        "And lead us not into temptation,
                        but deliver us from evil: for
                        thine is the kingdom and the power,
                        and the glory, for ever.  Amen."

          Then he SEES it -- African idol sits on his desk.  There's
          a NOTE attached to it.  He reads it, quietly shocked.

                                        PURDY
                                (hushed pain)
                        My God.


  5454INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Johnny walks in and flips on the lights, to FIND Purdy
          sitting in a chair.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene?

          Purdy looks up, his eyes carrying the pain in his heart.

                                        PURDY
                        She's gone, Johnny.  Jessica's
                        been taken.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:


  5555INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Purdy reads Johnny a note.  Upset. 

                                        PURDY
                        "This night thy soul shall be
                          required of thee..."  It was
                          attached to this.

          Purdy holds the African idol in his hands. 

                                        PURDY
                        I can't let anything happen to
                        her.

          Purdy lifts a black leather briefcase onto the desk.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're going to pay ransom?

                                        PURDY
                        Everything I have.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Call the police.

                                        PURDY
                        I can't take that chance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What do you want me to do?

                                        PURDY
                        Tell me who did this.  I'll never
                        ask another thing of you as long
                        as I live.  Just tell me who took
                        her.

          Johnny stares at the note.  Doesn't touch it.  He now has
          some leverage to get some answers.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Who was Raymond Franklin?

          The mention of that name stings Purdy.

                                        PURDY
                        A monster.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene...

                                        PURDY
                                (pointed)
                        Raymond Franklin is dead and
                        buried!

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did you kill Clara Simon?

                                        PURDY
                          Johnny...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did you?!

                                        PURDY
                        Why don't you see for yourself.

          He puts his hand out.  Johnny hesitates, then takes it.

            MATCH/CUT/MORPH:


  5656INT.  TENT REVIVAL - DAY - 1964

          We SPIN around Purdy as he MORPHS into Young Purdy.  His
          hands are on Clara Simon's shoulders.  She looks pale,
          sick.  Her eyes are closed.

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL

          We are onstage inside a small revival tent.  An organ
          plays, as Purdy preaches:

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        And Jesus said, "Listen carefully
                        to the voice of the Lord God, and
                        do what is right in his eyes. 
                        And I will not bring on you any
                        of the diseases I brought on the
                        Egyptians, for I am the Savior."

          Purdy places the palm of his hand flat against her forehead --

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        Dark sickness be gone from this
                        woman!

          He thrusts his hand hard against her as she falls back
          and is caught by two older men in rumpled suits.  The
          small congregation rejoices with their hands in the air
          and sporadic "Praise God!"  and "Hallelujah, Jesus!"  


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT FOUR - 7/6/05 - PINK  43A.


    56CONTINUED:56

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        I feel the power of Christ filling
                        this tent tonight.  I see the
                        Glory of his mercy in every face.

          The crowd REJOICES again.  Clara is now back at his side.

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                                (to Clara)
                        Affirm your faith and you will be
                        healed!  Do you believe, sister?!

                                        CLARA
                        I believe.

                                        YOUNG PURDY
                        Do you accept me as a messenger
                        of God?! 

          Clara is finally swept up in the moment as her emotions
          burst through and she begins to cry joyous tears. 

                                        CLARA
                        I do!  I believe!  I believe!

          She falls into Purdy's embrace as the scene builds
          intensity.  Whoosh.


  5757INT. JOHNNY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          MATCH: Purdy's sullen expression, as Johnny now sees the
          truth.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You were a faith healer?

                                        PURDY
                        More 'faith' than 'healer'.
                                (beat)
                        My partner and I went from town
                        to town, gathering information on
                        wealthy citizens and using it to
                        gain their trust.

          He stops for a second to consider the African idol, then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's when you met Clara Simon?

                                        PURDY
                                (nods)
                        When she came to me, she was pale
                        and weak.  As time passed, her
                          condition grew more serious.

                                        JOHNNY
                        She believed you'd healed her.

    57CONTINUED:57

          Purdy offers a sorrowful nod.

                                        PURDY
                        It was only later I realized she'd
                        stopped taking her medication. 
                        That her condition was much more
                        serious than I'd been led to
                          believe. 
                                (desperate tone)
                        You have to believe me, Johnny. 
                          I wasn't in it just for the money. 
                        I believed then, as I believe
                        now, that God truly does perform
                          miracles.  I'm living proof.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But you still took the money.

                                        PURDY
                        I was young, full of blind
                          ambition.  I planned to use the
                        cash to build a church.  A place
                        where anyone and everyone would
                        be welcome.  A place like Faith
                          Heritage. 
                                (beat)
                        But make no mistake, I killed
                        that woman.  Murdered her the
                        same as if I'd put a gun to her
                        head.  And there hasn't been a
                        day I haven't suffered for it.

          Johnny can see his pain.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That's why you set up the hedge
                        fund.  Why you sent Jessica money
                        every month. 

                                        PURDY
                        I need to protect her.  No matter
                        what.

          Purdy picks up the ransom note and offers it to Johnny
          again.

                                        JOHNNY

                        He was released from prison five
                        weeks ago.  He's been following
                        your career.

          The name strikes fear in Purdy.

                                        PURDY
                              (a beat)

          Johnny walks to the other room.

                        Where are you going?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm calling Walt.  This has gone
                        too far.

          Johnny moves to the door, then stops and looks back --

                        One more question.  Did you con
                        my mother, the way you conned
                        Clara Simon?

                        No.  May God strike me dead if
                        I'm lying.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (cold as ice)
                        If you're lying, it won't be God
                        that strikes you down.

          Johnny walks out, leaving Purdy alone.


  5858INT.  JOHNNY'S HOUSE - FOYER - LATER

          Johnny answers the DOORBELL.  It's Walt and Bruce.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks for comin' over so fast.

                        Nolan and Purdy used to work

            Establishing.  The sun creeps over the horizon.  Purdy
          pulls up in his Jaguar, grabs the briefcase and gets out*
          of the car.  Massive silos spread over the fields.  Purdy*
          hops over a fence and walks toward the field of silos.*


  6161EXT.  GRAIN SILO - DAWN

          Purdy walks towards a particular silo.  He looks up at
          the rusted, tall structure.  He's been here before.


  6262INT. GRAIN SILO - DAY

          Purdy walks in.  Looks around.  Seems empty.

          Purdy is knocked out as the SCREEN GOES BLACK.

          Purdy regains his senses as he realizes he's been CHAINED
          to a concrete slab inside the silo.

          He pulls on the chain, but he's trapped.

                        How's it feel to be chained up
                        like an animal?

          Nolan steps out of the darkness, holding a gun.

                        you, but I'm no longer the man
                        you knew.  I've been reborn.

          Nolan approaches Purdy, leans in, studies his face.

          prayer.

                                        PURDY
                        Give me strength, Lord, to face
                        my sins.  Give me strength to be
                          righteous in Your name.  Amen. 

          Purdy opens the door and enters.          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT FOUR - 7/6/05 - PINK  52.

          Johnny pulls on the door, but it's LOCKED.  Johnny looks*
          for Walt - he's nowhere to be found.  He's on his own. *
          Johnny goes around the side of the building looking for*
          another way in.*

                        Do what you will with me.  Just
                        let Jessica go.  She's not part
                        of this...

                                        JESSICA (O.S.)
                        You're wrong, Reverend.

          Jessica comes out of the darkness.  Unharmed.  Unbound. 
          The weight of what's happening falls on Purdy.

                                        PURDY
                        I don't understand.  You're
                          involved in this?

                                        JESSICA
                        You think a lousy check every
                        month can pay for what you stole
                        from me?  Pay for the life you
                        took?

          Nolan climbs a flight of steps as he speaks...

                                        NOLAN
                        I'm proud of you, Raymond.  You
                        took this girl in as your own. 
                        No questions asked.  Just the way
                        I knew you would.

          Purdy is on his knees, defeated.  His mouth crimson with
          blood.  Just like in Johnny's vision.  Looks up to Jessica.

                                        PURDY
                        Is this what you came to do?! 
                        Then do it!  I deserve this!

          He bows his head, closes his eyes.  Prays.

                                        PURDY
                        "Though he slay me, I shall yet
                        trust Him..."

          Nolan walks to a second level, to a conveyor belt control
          box.  And turns the key.

          Nolan BREAKS the key in the lock with his boot.

          Grain FALLS from the ceiling onto Purdy.  He pulls on the
          chains, he's trapped...


  7373*EXT. SILO OUTER BUILDING - DAY

          Outside, Johnny sees a hole in the wall covered loosely*
          by some metal sheeting.  He grabs the sheeting -- WHOOSH.*


  73A73A*INT. SILO - DAY - VISION

          Grain showers down on Purdy who is almost buried in it,*
          only his face showing.  The grain covers Purdy's face,*
          suffocating him.*


    73B73B*RESUME - EXT. SILO OUTER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny moves the sheeting aside and crawls in through the*
            opening.*


  7474INT. SILO - DAY

          Jessica looks at Nolan, horrified.  Nolan walks towards
          the exit...

                                        JESSICA
                        What are you doing?  We have the
                        money.  This wasn't what we
                          planned.

                                        NOLAN
                                (cold)

          Nolan stands directly in front of the second level door.

                        Look on the bright side, Ray.  If
                        there is a God, and you are a
                          different man, then the gates of
                        Heaven should swing wide when you

                        But we both know that's not where
                        you're going.  Don't we?

          Nolan and Purdy stare hard at each other, then...          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT FOUR - 7/6/05 - PINK  54.


  7575*INT. SILO OUTER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny crawls in.  Over the loud HUM of a motor, he hears*
          voices coming from overhead.  He creeps up the stairs*
          leading to...*


  7676*INT. SILO OUTER BUILDING - SECOND LEVEL - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny sees Nolan and Jessica whose backs are toward him*
          as they look down, watching the grain falling on Purdy*
          below.  As Johnny approaches them, Nolan turns.  Johnny*
          makes a grab for the rifle.  As he and Nolan struggle,*

          THE RIFLE

          Falls to the floor and skitters out of reach.*

          Johnny and Nolan both see it, as Johnny jumps and grabs*
          him.  A brief FIGHT ensues, as Nolan finally drops Johnny
          with a punch to the gut.

          Nolan hurries to retrieve the gun, but finds it gone.  He*
          turns to SEE Jessica holding the rifle on him.

                                        NOLAN
                        Give me the gun.

          He takes a step towards her as she quickly chambers a
          round and levels the barrel on him.

                                        JESSICA
                        Stay where you are!

          Nolan notices the money bag about twenty feet across the
          silo on the ground.  Jessica sees it, too.

                                        NOLAN
                        You were right.  Let's just take
                        the money and go.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You leave with him and you won't
                        see the sun again.

                                        NOLAN
                        I wouldn't hurt you.  You know
                        that.

          The grain builds up around Purdy like quicksand.

          Jessica is confused.  Johnny starts up towards the control
          panel.

                                        JESSICA
                        I said don't move!

          She swings the gun up towards Johnny, then back at Nolan
          and back up at Johnny.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't pretend to know you, or
                        your pain.  But you're not a
                        killer.  Don't let this man make
                        you one.

                                        NOLAN
                        He deserves to die for what he
                        did to your mother.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nolan doesn't give a damn about
                        your mother.  All he cares about
                        is the money.

          She begins to cry, the pain and suffering of her life
          bubbling to the surface in this tense moment.

                                        JESSICA
                        He lied to her.  She believed in
                        him and he lied.

          Johnny locks eyes with Purdy, the grain now covering his
          chest and climbing.  For a brief second, Johnny isn't
          sure why or if he can defend this man.  Then...

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not saying Raymond Franklin
                          deserves your mercy.  He doesn't. 
                        But Franklin isn't here.  He died
                        with your mother over forty years
                        ago.

          Purdy can only close his eyes and listen.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I can only tell you about Gene
                        Purdy.  I can tell you he's a man
                        of compassion and understanding. 
                        He's also a man blinded by greed
                        and personal ambition.  I guess
                        he's like the rest of us,
                        struggling to stay on the path. 
                        But he was willing to sacrifice
                        everything for you.  Even his
                        life.  That has to count for
                        something.

          A tear rolls down Jessica's cheek. 

          The GRAIN rises to Purdy's neck... 

          She LOWERS The gun.

          Nolan grabs the briefcase and TAKES OFF.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Let him go!

          Johnny stares at the control panel.  The key is broken
          inside the lock. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        He broke the key off.  I can't
                        shut it off from here.

          The grain won't stop.  It's under Purdy's chin.

          Johnny runs back down to the first floor.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene, hang on!

          Purdy is now muttering the Lord's prayer to himself.

          Johnny lunges in and begins to dig away the pouring grain
          away from Purdy's face.  It's a losing struggle against
          time.

                                        PURDY
                        The rifle.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (digging)
                        I'm not going to shoot you!

                        Not me... the control panel.

          Johnny realizes he's right, but if he stops digging, Purdy
          might suffocate by the time he shoots the box and gets
          back down to him.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Jessica, keep digging the grain
                        away while I go up top!  You can
                        do it!

          She takes over for Johnny, as he grabs the rifle and runs
          up the steps towards the master control panel.  Having
          smaller hands and less strength than Johnny, it's quickly
          a losing battle against the falling grain.  Purdy's face
          becomes hidden beneath the mounting grain.

                                        JESSICA

          Johnny dashes back down the steps, tossing the rifle aside
          as he lunges into the mountain of grain.  Purdy is no
          longer visible under the mound.

          For a moment we aren't sure if he's dead or alive, then
          finally Purdy coughs and spits...

                                        PURDY
                        I'll leave that up to her.  And
                        God.

                                        WALT
                        Okay.  But you should go to the
                          hospital and get checked out.

          And Walt walks off.  Bruce can tell he's in the way.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm gonna catch a ride back with
                        Walt.

          Bruce walks away.  A tense BEAT, then...

                                        PURDY
                        I don't know what to say. 
                              (a beat)
                        I know our relationship isn't
                        what I wanted it to be.  I'd like
                        to try and change that.  To make
                        it up to you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You can start by being honest
                        with me.

                                        PURDY
                        Your mother.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did you use her?  The way you
                        used Clara Simon?





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: "Revelations" - ACT FOUR  - 6/21/05 - WHITE 59.

                                        PURDY
                        No.
                              (a beat)
                        Clara was the reason I turned my
                        life to God.  Your mother was the
                        reward.

          Purdy's eyes well up, as an EMT helps Purdy into an
          ambulance.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Gene?

          Purdy TURNS...

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thank you.

          Purdy musters a weak smile as the doors are shut and the
            ambulance drives away.

          Johnny takes a BEAT to consider the surrounding, then
          grabs his jacket and walks away as the camera lingers on
          the silo.

          The SHOT PUSHES IN TIGHT on an area of the silo we have
          not seen.  An old, dusty sign that reads:

          "PURDY GRAIN COMPANY, EUGENE OREGON"

          As we realize the true birthplace where Gene Purdy was
          born....

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        END OF ACT FOUR

                                              THE END
