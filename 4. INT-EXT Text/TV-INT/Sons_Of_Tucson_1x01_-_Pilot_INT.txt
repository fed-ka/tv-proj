      behind the customer service desk, TALKING ON THE PHONE.

      A long line has formed in front of him.  DISGRUNTLED 
      CUSTOMERS clutch a variety of sporting goods.  Ron s not in 
      too much of a hurry to meet their needs.

      OVER TO THE STORE S FRONT ENTRANCE:

      GARY GUNDERSON (14) enters the store ahead of brothers ROBBY 
      GUNDERSON (8) and BRANDON GUNDERSON (16).

      Gary, their articulate leader, blazes a trail through 
      browsing CUSTOMERS as the impish Robby races to catch up.  
      Brandon wanders in slowly, captivated by the overabundance of 
      sporting goods.

      The boys move apart, trying to monitor Ron surreptitiously:

      Robby tests PUNCHING BAGS, Gary checks out TENNIS RACKETS,

                    him sitting down.  This will all be 
                    over soon.

      BACK TO THE LIVING ROOM:

      Growing frantic, Ron re-enters to find:

                                  GARY
                          (to Ethel)
                    How did he find you?  E-Bay?

                                  ETHEL
                    Oh no, I haven t been sailing in 
                    years!

                                  RON
                    Excuse me!

      He drags Gary into the kitchen. 

      IN THE KITCHEN:

      Gary and Ron stand next to the counter.

                                  RON
                    You guys are killing me!                                                                                    32.


                                  GARY
                    You re ripping off an old lady!

      OFF CAMERA: WE HEAR A CRASH IN THE LIVING ROOM, then SCREAMS 
      FROM ROBBY.

                                  ETHEL (O.C.)
                    Get your mitts out of my purse!

                                    BRANDON (O.C.)
                    Robby!  Put her checkbook back!

                                  RON
                          (grabbing Gary, desperate)
                    I ll cut you in for five percent!

                                  GARY
                    Ten percent, or I deep six this 
                    thing right now.

                                  RON
                    FINE!

      BACK TO LIVING ROOM:

      Ron and Gary re-enter.  Brandon holds Robby down with one 
      arm, stuffs things back into Ethel s purse with the other.

                                  ETHEL
                          (to Robby)
                    You re a horrible child!  I will 
                    never leave my soldiers here!

                                  GARY
                    ROBBY!

      THE RUCKUS GRINDS TO A HALT.  Ron raises an eyebrow at Gary:

                                  GARY (CONT D)
                          ( emotional )
                    Ma am, let me apologize for our 
                    behavior.  Today s the anniversary 
                    of us losing Grandpapa. (Beat)  
                    Those soldiers would mean the world 
                    to us.  The other kids can have 
                    their video games...we will gladly 
                    spend our quiet afternoons with our 
                      imaginations and with toys that 
                    really mean something.

                                  ETHEL
                          (moved)
                    You remind me so much of my brother 
                    Earl...                                                                                    33.



      The boys hang around in the kitchen.  We catch them mid-
      conversation:

                                  GARY
                    He stays in the shed. We don t want 
                    him to hear everything we talk 
                    about.

                                    BRANDON
                    Can we at least get him a new suit?  
                    He keeps wearing that one we found 
                    in the trash.

                                  GARY
                    He can buy one himself.  He just 
                    got a great job.

                                    BRANDON
                    It d be a nice thing to do for 
                    somebody who s gonna be our dad.

                                  ROBBY
                    We already have a dad!  

                                    BRANDON
                    Yeah, and what s he doing for us?

                                  RON (O.C.)
                    Hey guys.                                                                                    35.


      PAN OVER TO RON, AT AN OPEN WINDOW.  It s unclear whether or 
      not he s been listening to this conversation...

                                  RON (CONT D)
                    Just wanted to let you know: Gary, 
                    I called the school, gave my 
                      permission for you to stay late for 
                    debate team.

                                  GARY
                    Really?  Thanks.

                                  RON
                    Grabbed this for Brandon.

      He hands Brandon A HANDFUL OF THE TOY SOLDIERS.

                                    BRANDON
                          (wide-eyed)
                    Awesome.  Are you sure?  

                                  RON
                    It s just one regiment.

      Ron tosses something to Robby.

                                  RON
                    And I bought Robby here a T-shirt.

      Robby unfolds it, revealing a PINK UNICORN on the front.

                                  ROBBY
                    Jerk.

      Brandon walks over to Ron.

                                    BRANDON
                    Thanks.

      He gives Ron a CLUMSY, UNCOMFORTABLE HUG through the window.  
      Ron drops away quickly:

                                  RON
                    Yeah, well...goodnight, boys.



      Ron enters the shed.  He has transformed it into an 
         apartment : half-bachelor pad, half-warehouse jammed with 
      antique collectibles, porcelain dolls, sporting goods, etc.  
      He picks up  The Art of War  by Sun Tzu, turns on some 
      CLASSIC ROCK.                                                                                    36.


      Before he can sit down and relax, A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

      Ron opens it, revealing the NASAL NEIGHBOR from the day 
      before.  She glares at him.

                                  RON
                    Hello neighbor.  My boys take care 
                    of your window?

                                  NEIGHBOR
                    If you think for a second that I am 
                    going to let three boys with 
                    childhood arthritis perform manual 
                    labor, you re sorely mistaken.

                                  RON
                    What?

                                  NEIGHBOR
                    They told me everything, Mr. 
                    Johnson.  About your drinking, your 
                      gambling--

                                  RON
                    Who told you all that?  The middle 
                    one?  He has a vivid imagination.

                                  NEIGHBOR
                    My window still needs fixing, so 
                    I ll expect you tomorrow morning.   

      Beat.  Ron grits his teeth, decides not to fight this one.

                                  RON
                    Sounds good.  See you then.

                                  NEIGHBOR
                    And Mr. Johnson...I ll be watching 
                    you.

      As she leaves, we see Gary on the back porch, arms crossed, 
      holding back a laugh.

                                  GARY
                    Have fun with that!

      Ron shakes his head, retreats into his shed, and SLAMS THE 
      DOOR.
