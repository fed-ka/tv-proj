                    What is it?

                      A retreat.

                    That s good, right?

                                  ARGENT
                    Maybe.

      MOVEMENT catches Allison s eye. A SILHOUETTE against the 
      building. She raises her bow, aiming at a face stepping into 
      the light--Morrell. Then, just as suddenly, she s gone. 
      Argent notices Allison lowering the bow.

                                  ARGENT (CONT D)
                    You see something?

      She searches the shadows, but finally, shakes her head.

                                    ALLISON
                    Nothing.


      Isaac gets out to meet Allison and Argent, all of them 
      noticing the sound of SIRENS approaching from a distance.

                                    ALLISON
                    Where are the others?

                                  ISAAC
                    I don t know. Stiles and Scott went 
                    back for Derek and Jennifer. I had 
                    to get Cora out.

      HEADLIGHTS blaze toward them, Derek s FJ CRUISER racing out 
      of the darkness. It skids to a halt next to the RAV. Derek 
      jumps out with barely a glance to them.

                                  DEREK
                    Where is she?

      Isaac opens the back door where Cora lies. Derek carefully 
      lifts her up to transfer her to his car.

                                    ALLISON
                    Where s Scott and Stiles--

                                  DEREK
                    Stiles is back at the hospital. 
                    He s going to hold off the cops for 
                    us. We need to go--

                    What about Scott and Melissa?

                                  DEREK
                    Jennifer took Melissa.

      Now he looks at them. At their shocked expressions. The 
      hopelessness.

                                  ISAAC
                    But does that--does it mean 
                    Stiles s Dad is dead?

      He looks her in the eyes. A look that tells her everything. 
      As the SIRENS wail louder and louder--

      As night falls, BLACK BOOTS trample dead leaves underfoot. A 
      woman tears through the woods, running as fast as she can. 
      Pausing for a breath, she glances back to reveal her face--

      Morrell.

      Distant but frightening HOWLS rise from the dark of the 
      woods. Turning, Morrell takes off again while--

      NOT FAR AWAY - Ethan and Aiden burst out the shadows. They 
      flip forward, landing perfectly. Aiden lifts his head to 
      catch a scent from the air as Ethan moves closer to the 
      ground, hand on the dirt.

      The searing RED of WOLF VISION. Moving through the woods. 
      Moving fast. Until a small WHITE GLOW appears, floating 
      through the field of RED.

      With the blink of an eye, the world returns to normal and the 
      white glow is revealed to be a FIREFLY. 

      Deucalion pauses on the trail, head tilted to the glowing 
      insect which flutters through the air in front of him.

                    It s a firefly.

                    It s because of Jennifer, isn t it? 
                    Right before all this started, a 
                    deer ran into Lydia s car. All of 
                    the cats at the Animal Clinic went

                    Morrell said they were the most

                                  SCOTT

                                  DEUCALION
                    Lydia s talents make her a perfect 
                    candidate to be an Emissary. Danny 
                    has the strength of intellect and 
                    body to make a superior wolf. So I 
                    had Ethan and Aiden keep them

      The Twins close in on Morrell. She looks back--and 
          surprisingly--stops. Her hand comes up, something grasped in 
      her palm. She whirls about and sends MOUNTAIN ASH scattering 
      into the air.

      The ash whirls up in a cloud, but somehow lands in a perfect 
      circle around her. Just as the last dusting of ash falls--

      Ethan and Aiden SLAM into an invisible wall and tumble to the 
      ground.

      Kali flips out of the darkness, landing on her bare feet. She 
      rises to face Morrell. The three werewolves circle their 
      Emissary, fangs snapping.

      Deucalion s cane SOARS out of his hand into Morrell's 
      shoulder, piercing it. She stumbles, knocked out of the

      The Alphas start toward her, but Scott is the first to move,

                    You remember the part where I said 
                    it was dangerous?
                          (to Scott)
                    If it goes right, the three of you 
                    will only be dead for a few 
                    seconds. But there s something else 
                    you need to think about. This is a 
                    dangerous thing in more ways than 
                    one. You ll be giving power back to 
                    the Nemeton. A place that hasn t 
                    had power for a long time. When it 
                    did, Beacon Hills was quite 
                      different. This kind of power is 
                    like a magnet. It attracts the 
                      supernatural. The kind of things 
                    that allow a family like the 
                    Argents to fill the pages of a 
                    Bestiary. It ll draw them here. 
                    Like a beacon.

                    Doesn t sound any worse than what 
                    we ve already seen.

                                  DEATON
                    You d be surprised what you have 
                    yet to see.

                                  SCOTT
                    Is that it?

                                  DEATON
                    No. It ll also have an affect on 
                    the three of you. You won t be able 
                    to see it, but you ll feel it every 
                    day for the rest of your lives. 
                    It ll be a kind of darkness over 
                    your heart. And permanent. Like a 
                    scar.

                          (softly)
                    Like a tattoo.
