    Masuka motions to the EMTs that he s done.  They slide 
    Miguel s body onto a stretcher and gently lift him up.  

    Batista, and all the nearby Unis respectfully remove their 
    hats.  Others put their hands over their hearts.

    Batista nods toward several of the Unis, and an impromptu 
    honor line forms, stretching all the way back to the 
    Coroner s van.  All work stops, everyone is silent.  

    The EMTs carry Miguel s body down the line.  It s a somber, 
    ceremonial procession.  Dexter starts for the Coroner s van.

                        Miguel. 

    Dexter starts to reach for Miguel, to close his eyes, but a 
    hand suddenly grabs his forearm in a vise-like grip.  It s 
    Ramon, glaring at him with pure hatred.

    Ramon shoulders Dexter around to the side of the van, out of

    proudly standing with his old sheriff s partner next to a 
    table piled with a bounty of guns and drugs.  Better days.

                        Ramon s blood family doesn t know 
                        where he is.

    Dexter pulls the article out of the printer, reads the name 
    of Ramon s former partner: JESSIE WHITAKER.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Maybe his blue family does.  

    He hits the speakerphone button and dials.

                        One moment please.  

    We hear tinny MUZAK coming over the phone.  Dexter waits a 
    beat, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out the 
    envelope that Gail s card was in.

                        Speaking of partners...

    As he navigates to another WEB SITE -- Michigan Department 
    of Records -- the MUZAK stops.  The operator pops back on.

                        there any way to track him down?  

    The Operator SIGHS, the Muzak comes back up and Dexter turns 
    his attention back to the web page.

    Several options pop up: Dexter clicks on  MARRIAGE

    Dexter absorbs this information.

                        Paul Bennet wasn t her first husband.

    While Dexter considers this, he sees Debra hurrying across 
    the Bullpen towards the Briefing Room.  

    As the hold Muzak continues...


    Dexter is still on hold when suddenly the Muzak stops.

                        places he used to hang out at;  
                        basically any bar within a ten mile

                        alcoholics there are in Miami. 

    Dexter gets in, and as he drives away... a SEDAN pulls out 
    behind them...

                        I think I ll call you Dexter.

    to see who s behind the wheel, but with the sun glinting off 
    the windshield, he can t get a good look at the driver.

    speed accordingly... then he guns it and purposely runs a

    The SEDAN follows, running a red light --

    First the TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT CAMERAS FLASH twice -- 

    Then BAM!  Another car goes through the intersection and 
    hits the sedan s bumper and tire, immobilizing the sedan.

    Cody and Astor spin backward at the sound --

    Dexter makes a U-Turn in the next intersection. 

    DEXTER S POV - As they approach, we see the door of the 
    stricken car is open, the driver long gone.

                        ... Until I get a hold of him. 


    With his suit in a garment bag, Dexter makes his way to his 
    car.  He pauses to breathe in the night air.

                        The night before my wedding day.  Some 
                        men would be excited.  Others panicky.  
                        Me, I feel... okay. 

    Opening the back door of his car, Dexter hangs his suit on 
    the coat hook, but when he turns back around - there s 
    GEORGE KING.  BAM!  A mag-lite crashes into the side of 
    Dexter s head.  BLACKNESS. 


    Dexter pulls at the ropes on his wrists.  The knots are too 
    tight to slide his hand through.  He looks over at George 
    King again.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)

                        Sorry  bout that.

    King blinks.  That got his attention.  King slowly rises, 
    walks toward Dexter, studying this very different animal 
    lying on his table as --

                        I tied him up, not unlike this.  
                        Stabbed him in the left carotid 
                        artery.  Used a sixteen inch carbon

    King leans on the table -- it rocks, its legs uneven.  
    Dexter takes note.

                                        GEORGE KING

                        Why would you have done such a thing?

                        I have excuses, justifications.  But 
                        really?  I just... need to.  Like you 
                        do.  I mean, you have your flimsy 
                        excuse -- to find Freebo, get back 
                        your money -- but you know he s dead.  
                        You know there s no money -- so you re

    He leans on the table again.  It rocks again.  Dexter notes 
    it again.

                                        GEORGE KING
                        You are lying -- you know where he is.

                        He wanted me dead.  So he used you.  
                        Played on your obsession.  Wasn t that 
                        hard.  I mean, you are a little single-
                        minded --

    King pushes away from the table abruptly.

                        I hope you re this talkative once I 
                        get my tools. 

    King ascends to the catwalk and goes to his toolbox to pick 
    out a knife.  Dexter starts rocking the table from side to 
    side.

    He positions his hand along the side of the table, and 
    starts rocking it more dramatically.

                        No...

    And with one big thrust, the table TIPS ON ITS SIDE -- BAM! 
    It CRUSHES Dexter s hand!  

    He strains in agony, and immediately starts pulling his 
    limp, shattered hand through the knotted loop of rope, 
    freeing it just as --

    George King comes at him, knife in hand, lunges -- 

    Dexter dodges, manages to KICK King away, long enough to use 
    his good hand to pull the rest of the rope free.  

    A fierce fight ensues.  King is fast and wiry, Dexter 
    bigger, but injured --  

    Dexter finally manages to wrap the rope around King s neck.  
    King begins to strangle, writhing and flailing with the 
    knife --  

    He NICKS Dexter s injured arm, but Dexter holds on, fighting 
    the searing pain in his hand --

    As Dexter struggles with King, he spots three cars bursting 
    into the far end of the cavernous warehouse.  Two cop cars - 
    light bars ablaze - and Debra s car just behind.

                                        DEXTER

                        -- Alive, you have too many answers --

    Wrapping his good arm around King s neck and coupling it 
    with his injured arm, Dexter deftly snaps King s neck.  
    Killing him.

    THE CARS SCREAM CLOSER.

    The Driver starts to reach for his walkie when something 
    falls in front of his car -- GEORGE KING!  The car SLAMS 
    INTO him.  Crushing him and dragging him twenty feet.

    THE CARS ALL SKID to a stop.  Debra and the cops leap out, 
    weapons drawn.

    QUICK CUTAWAY TO DEXTER lowering himself out of an unseen 
    window.  He takes one last look at the mess he s leaving 
    behind.

    MASUKA reflexively catches it.  He glances at Tammy.  Beat.

    Rita FLINGS her bouquet over her shoulder.  

    DEBRA snags it mid-air.  Looks to Anton.

    A SERIES OF DISSOLVES as:

    Dexter separates from Rita and takes Debra into his arms.  
    Rita goes to Astor and dances with her.

    Debra then moves to Anton and Rita goes to Cody.  Dexter 
    bows and asks LaGuerta to dance.  Smiling, she joins him.  
    On her way to being whole again.

                        still... who I am.

    Other couples flow onto the dance floor.    

    Quinn passes out cigars from the box he had at the station. 

    Tammy argues with a waiter.  Masuka tries to calm her. 

    Dexter hands LaGuerta off to Quinn and finds his new wife.  
    Again putting his injured arm around her waist.  She 
    lovingly rests her head on his chest as they dance.

    He spreads his good hand, the one with the wedding ring, 
    across Rita s tummy.  Rita, moved, kisses him.

    The guests form a circle around Dexter and Rita.

    Unseen, the blood-drop lingers for a moment, then falls onto 
    the back of Rita s pristine white dress.  Nothing will ever 
    be normal in Dexter s world.

    Dexter turns Rita and there s a slight smile of satisfaction 
    creasing his face as he looks into CAMERA.
