  Spartacus and Varro dump Gnaeus on an examining table. The 
  MEDICUS comes over as Spartacus and Varro move away.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      We nearly die of thirst and yet 
                        water is withheld.

                                        VARRO
                        Batiatus lacks the coin to purchase 
                        more than a few drops. Especially 
                        since losing a fortune in the Pits.

  Spartacus darkens with guilt.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        Because of me.

                                        VARRO
                        You did what you had to. If you had 
                        died as promised, Batiatus' purse 
                        would be overflowing, but the man 
                        himself dead. And no one to find 
                        your wife.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And if he does, how will I pay to 
                        wrest her from the Syrian? I have 
                      no coin, nor favor in the arena.

                                        VARRO
                        The gods will provide.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    3.

                        I place no value in them.

                                        VARRO
                        Perhaps now's a good time to start.

  Varro grins as he moves off. Spartacus frowns, following, 
  his body WIPING US TO --



  BATIATUS stands in the middle of his empty reflecting pool, 
  his arms outstretched to the blazing sky above. Several 
  SLAVES stand in the background.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Rain! By Jupiter's cock, will you 
                        fucking rain!

                                        LUCRETIA (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

  Batiatus turns to find LUCRETIA striding up with a scroll in 
  hand. NAEVIA hustles in her wake.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Praying.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Blaspheming.

                                        BATIATUS
                        The two are narrowly separated in 
                        these trying times.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Perhaps the gap widens...

  She holds out the scroll. Batiatus steps out of the pool, 
  takes it.

                                        BATIATUS
                        More creditors, threatening action?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Something of more cheerful note, 
                        just delivered...

  Lucretia beams, barely containing herself as Batiatus scans 
  the message. Batiatus brightens.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    4.

                        Games to appease the gods and end 
                        the drought! The biggest games 
                        since Theokoles bested a hundred 
                        men in the arena!

                                        BATIATUS
                        But why come himself? Unless...

                      To secure the main event at these 
                        games... We would be the talk of 
                        the Republic.

                      He arrives within the hour.

                        Prepare food. And gather all the

                        Your robe...

  Lucretia goes to Batiatus, concerned. He glances down to see 
  BLOOD has seeped through the side of his robe where the 
  assassin slashed him in 104.

                                        BATIATUS
                        It's nothing.

                        Lucretia --

                                        LUCRETIA
                        I would have word with the 
                        Magistrate about this. Those men 
                        nearly killed you, an honest 
                        citizen.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    5.

                      In a dishonest place. No, we won't 
                        concern the Magistrate with such 
                        things, not with the Primus in the 
                        balance. I'll tend to the matter 
                        myself.

  OFF Batiatus, darkening at the thought...



  Lucretia finishes helping Batiatus into his finest robes.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    6.

                      Do they yet fit? They feel as if 
                        they've shrunk about the middle.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        You adorn them like a god.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I would be out of them... and deep 
                        into you...

  He kisses her. She laughs, but can't help feel the passion 
  rising as his hand slips down between her legs. Naevia 
  enters, breaking the moment.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Apologies. Magistrate Calavius 
                        arrives.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Our fortunes rise, along with your 
                        cock.

                        Stay wet. I'll make it rain 
                        presently...

  As they sweep out...



  Batiatus and Lucretia enter, beaming. MAGISTRATE TITUS 
  CALAVIUS stands with his back to them, speaking with someone 
  we can't see. Calavius' GUARDS wait in the background.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Magistrate! You honor us with your 
                        presence!

  Calavius turns. Batiatus' smile falters as he sees the man 
  the Magistrate was conversing with: SOLONIUS, his rival.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Good Batiatus! I was just telling 
                        Solonius how I knew your father. 
                        Now there was a true Roman.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        A great man, none of his like to 
                        follow.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    7.

  Batiatus smiles through the obvious slight, bowing slightly 
  to Calavius.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I shall attempt to fill your needs 
                      as he would have.

  Batiatus motions them towards the triclinium, filled with 
  food and water. They talk as they stroll.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                      To business then. As you well know, 
                        the drought has parched the city to 
                        near madness. We've tried 
                        everything to tempt the sky to 
                        tears, even the Hecatombe.

                                        SOLONIUS
                        A hundred cattle sacrificed, and 
                        yet not a drop.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Because the gods do not want the 
                        blood of bulls. They want the blood 
                      of men! Good Solonius has been kind 
                        enough to lend hand in organizing 
                        games to appease their appetite.

                                        SOLONIUS
                      It will be a Sine Missione. No 
                        draw. No mercy shown.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS
                        Only the finest gladiators will be 
                        invited to participate.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Only the finest are offered in the 
                        house of Batiatus. Come, examine my 
                        wares. And marvel at their 
                        superiority.

  Batiatus shoots Solonius a wry grin as he motions them out 
  to the balcony.



  Crixus glares at Spartacus as he eats his evening gruel. 
  Varro frowns as he passes by with Spartacus.

                                        VARRO
                        You two will make a fine couple.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I would rather fight without him.

                                        VARRO
                        And die the same.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        This Theokoles. The legends cannot 
                      be true.

                                        VARRO
                      He has been cut a thousand times in 
                        the arena, and has never fallen. I 
                        fear you would have been safer in 
                        the Pits.

  They sit to eat. Spartacus eyes Crixus across the mess hall, 
  considering their chances.

                                          SPARTACUS
                      If we were to win, how large would 
                      be the purse?

                                        VARRO
                        Large enough to wrest ten wives 
                        from the Syrian.

  OFF Spartacus, eyeing Crixus as he considers the 
    possibilities...



  Doctore follows Batiatus as he fumes, Lucretia at his side.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    11.

                        You send them to certain death. Let 
                      me fight in their stead.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      An excellent suggestion.

                                          DOCTORE
                        I owe Theokoles a debt of pain.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You were not requested!

  Batiatus softens.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                      No one has forgotten how bravely 
                        you fought against Theokoles, old 
                        friend.

                                          DOCTORE
                        Yet without victory.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You stand the only man ever to face 
                        him in the arena and live. That in 
                        itself is victory.

  Batiatus sees Ashur and Barca approaching.

                        death.

  Batiatus motions for Ashur and Barca to follow him. OFF 
  Lucretia, concern for Crixus welling in her eyes...



  Ashur and Barca follow Batiatus into his office chamber.

  TIGHT ON a skin of water being passed through the bars of

  She takes him in, uncertain of how she feels towards the 
  man... but feeling nonetheless.  He takes her in with 
  longing -- and something very much approaching love.

  She locks eyes with him, the air charged between them.  With 
  difficulty she pulls her gaze away from him.

  Crixus returns from the baths wrapped in a towel.  He steps 
  into his cell and freezes, tensing.  Spartacus sits half in 
  the shadows on his bed.

                                          SPARTACUS

                      We have had our differences. I own

                        And a Thracian dog undeserving the

  Spartacus' jaw tightens.

  Spartacus exits. OFF Crixus, considering his words... and 
  not caring for them.



  Batiatus follows Lucretia as she strides through the atrium. 
  Naevia follows.

                        Now is the perfect time. Her father

                        ear. If he were to place a word in 
                        it, perhaps Crixus could be 
                        replaced in the Primus.

  ILITHYIA enters from the far side of the atrium, escorted in

  Batiatus moves off, his gracious smile dropping into an 
  annoyed frown once his back is turned. Lucretia leads 
  Ilithyia to the triclinium.

  WHAM! Spartacus CLOCKS Crixus. Crixus snarls and TACKLES him 
  to the ground, pounding on him. The men erupt in laughter 
  and cheers. Suddenly two GIANT ARMS coil around Crixus' 
  neck, hauling him up. It's Doctore, pulling them apart. The 
  men go quiet. Doctore releases Crixus.

  Spartacus and Crixus stand before Ilithyia wearing only the 
  subligaria (loincloth), their hands bound in chains. 
  Lucretia hovers nearby. Naevia, Ilithyia's Body Slaves, and 
  two Guards are in the background. Ilithyia eyes Spartacus, a

                                          SPARTACUS
                        I have seen you. With Legatus 
                        Glaber.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        I am his wife. He is regrettably 
                        abroad, and will not be able to 
                        witness your death against 
                        Theokoles.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    22.

  She moves in closer, her hand touching his chest as her lips 
  move to his ear.

                        But I shall whisper of it to him, 
                        replaying the moment when we are 
                        intwined in our bed.

                                        BATIATUS (V.O.)
                        Apologies.

  Ilithyia turns to see Batiatus has entered.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I require the Thracian for a 
                        moment.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Extend it by a lifetime. I am done 
                        with him.

  Batiatus motions to a Guard, who escorts Spartacus out. 
  Spartacus glances back at Ilithyia, murder flashing in his 
  eyes.

                                        BATIATUS

  Lucretia hides her displeasure as Crixus complies. Naevia 
  can't help but steal a furtive glance before quickly 
  averting her eyes. Ilithyia, however, has no qualms, staring 
  directly at the blazing sun.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        Your champion is bold to his

  Batiatus bows slightly, exits. Ilithyia circles Crixus. Lust 
  fills her eyes as her fingers trace his skin.

                                        ILITHYIA
                        His flesh is hard as marble. Would 
                        that every man were carved so...

  Lucretia doesn't care for her pet to be stroked by another 
  hand.

                                        LUCRETIA
                      We must not keep him too long. He 
                        continues his training at first 
                        light.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      Do you think he will survive, 
                        against the Shadow?

  Lucretia looks to Crixus, worry seizing her.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Only the gods hold the answer.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      It would be pity to see such a man 
                        marred.

  Lucretia senses an opportunity, takes it regardless of 
  Batiatus' warning not to broach the subject.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        There may be a way to avoid such 
                        tragedy. A word from your father to 
                        the Magistrate, perhaps...

  Ilithyia cocks her head, not understanding.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      To what end?

                        Replacing Crixus in the games.

  Crixus tenses, shooting her a surprised look. Ilithyia 
  giggles, considering Crixus.

                                        ILITHYIA
                      Is that what you want? Do you fear 
                        entering the arena with Theokoles?

                                        CRIXUS
                        No. I long for it.

  OFF Lucretia, knowing her only chance to save Crixus has 
    evaporated...



  Spartacus stands, still in chains. Batiatus pours wine.

                                        BATIATUS
                        You survived being dragged from 
                        your homeland by Legatus fucking 
                        Glaber. You survived execution by 
                        four gladiators in the arena. You 
                        even survived the horrors of the 
                        Pits.

  He sips the wine, considers Spartacus.

                        Then find a way to unite them. You 
                        may have saved my life, but yours 
                      is yet of little worth in the 
                        arena. But to lose Crixus along 
                        with you... I fear it would be a

                      is lost.

  Ashur appears in the doorway.

                        Barca has returned, bearing gifts.

  Batiatus sweeps out with Ashur. OFF Spartacus, considering 
  his words...



  Batiatus, dagger on his belt, enters with Ashur. REMUS, the 
  slave trader, sits bound to a chair in the center of the 
  cell. Unconscious. Blood trickling from a busted lip. Barca 
  looms behind him in the shadows.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Wake him.

  Barca roughly slaps Remus. The man coughs, sputters blood.

                        Two slaves, broken by your hand,

  Batiatus catches his breath, blood DRIPPING from his rings. 
  Remus' face is a brutal display of raw, bleeding flesh. He 
  spits blood and teeth, finally croaking a name.

  Batiatus smiles warmly -- then pulls his dagger and SLITS

  Batiatus sweeps out, WIPING US TO --



  Crixus strides past in all his glory, glaring at Spartacus 
  as he passes. Varro, finishing his meager morning meal next 
  to Spartacus, frowns.

  Ashur glances at his crippled leg, the memory of the 
  betrayal fresh. Spartacus glances over to Crixus, where he 
  laughs with Barca.

                        ally?

                                        ASHUR
                        Even Barca, if he stood between him 
                        and glory. The only way to survive 
                        against Theokoles is to consider 
                        Crixus equal enemy.

  Ashur hobbles away. Spartacus shifts his attention to 
  Crixus, his eyes narrowing. OFF Crixus, catching the look 
  and returning it with an unpleasant smile...



  CLOSE ON an ornate FERTILITY CANDLE being lit.

                        How often do you engage in 
                        intercourse?

  PULL BACK to reveal THE PRIESTESS, a sensual woman draped in 
    a shimmering, gauzy gown. She glances over to Lucretia. 
  Ilithyia is in the background, lounging with a cup of wine.

                                        LUCRETIA
                        Several times a week. Sometimes 
                        more.

  The Priestess prepares a chalice.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.

                        Never.

  The Priestess nods, choosing an herb from a wide assortment 
  to add to the chalice.

                                          PRIESTESS
                        Have there been other men, besides

                                        LUCRETIA
                        What bearing does that have?

  Lucretia shoots an uncomfortable glance towards Ilithyia.

                      It will inform the correct

                        The ritual is usually a private 
                        matter. Perhaps --

                      Oh please, can I stay? I've never 
                        seen one of these. It's so 
                        intriguing.

  Lucretia musters a smile, nods.

                                          PRIESTESS
                        Other men? Have there been any?

                                  reluctantly)(
                        Yes.

  Ilithyia stifles a shocked giggle. The Priestess pours 
  goat's milk into the chalice.

                                          PRIESTESS
                        How many?

                                        LUCRETIA
                        One. Frequently.

  Ilithyia chews her lower lip, eyes dancing at the 
    salaciousness of the revelation. The Priestess chooses a 
  Pyramidal Orchid (Anacamptis Pyramidalis), about twelve 
  inches long, its bulbs exposed.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.

                        the  seed, but within the vessel.

                        You mean there's something wrong 
                        with her?

  The question is innocent, but Lucretia still feels the sting 
  of it.

                                          PRIESTESS
                        The gods have decided to withhold 
                        the joy of children. We will 
                        entreat them to reconsider...

  The Priestess culls a bulb from the orchid, kisses it, dips 
  it into the goat's milk.

                        Drink.

  Lucretia reluctantly takes the concoction. The Priestess 
  mutters a silent prayer as Lucretia drains the chalice.

                                          PRIESTESS(cont'd)

  Naevia escorts the Priestess out. Ilithyia rises.

  She kisses Lucretia and exits with a giggle. Lucretia's eyes 
  drop to the fertility candle. PUSH IN on its flame as it 
  DISSOLVES into a TORCH, TRANSITIONING US TO --



  A TORCH illuminates the oily walls of the bath. PULL BACK to 
  reveal Crixus once again scraping the dirt and blood off his 
  flesh. Spartacus sits engaged in the same. They scrape in 
  silence. A long beat passes, then:

                                          SPARTACUS
                        You were right.

  Crixus glances over.

                        I do not honor these walls.

                        you were first brought here, 
                        against your will? Your life traded 
                        for a few coins?

  A beat.

                        fight for?

  Crixus ponders the weight of Spartacus' words. A Guard 
  enters, interrupting the moment.

                                        GUARD

  Crixus rises, following the Guard. OFF Spartacus watching 
  him go, knowing he's failed to reach him...



  Lucretia stands waiting in a gorgeous see-through gown, her 
  body silhouetted by the flame of the fertility candle. 
  Naevia appears, escorting Crixus.  She lingers outside the 
  bedroom as he enters, Spartacus' words still lingering.

  Crixus complies. Lucretia drinks him in.

  Crixus goes to her. She kisses him hungrily, her hand

  chiseled chest. It dips out of frame to grip his manhood and

  Her lips kiss his neck, her tongue plying his skin with 
  sensual enticement. Naevia watches from the shadows for a 
  moment, then averts her eyes as a flood of conflicting 
  emotions wash over her.

                                          OVIDIUS(cont'd)
                        Laelia...?

  Ovidius enters the triclinium and freezes. His wife LAELIA 
  and several SLAVES lay dead in pools of blood on the floor.

  BATIATUS

  sits half in the shadows, his hand tenderly resting on 
  Ovidius' terrified eight-year-old SON's shoulder.

                                        BATIATUS
                        I owe you a debt, good Ovidius. And 
                        have come to repay.

  Ovidius looks to his petrified Son.

                                          OVIDIUS
                        Please. The boy is unstained.

                                        BATIATUS
                      No son is ever unstained by his 
                        father's deeds.



                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    38.

                        They were not my own.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Two slaves, hired from the cunt 
                        Remus to take my life. You deny 
                        giving coin to the cause?

                                          OVIDIUS
                        I hired the men, yes. But to 
                        another's purpose.

  Batiatus considers that, turning it in his mind.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Who?

  Ovidius hesitates.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)
                        Speak the name, and I swear to the 
                        gods I will not kill you.

  Ovidius glances at his son, swallows hard.

                                          OVIDIUS
                        Solonius.

  Batiatus' eyes narrow in cold fury.

                                          OVIDIUS(cont'd)
                      He paid the balance of your debt to 
                      me threefold. In exchange for 
                        arranging your death.

  Batiatus stands with a warm smile.

                                        BATIATUS
                        Gratitude for your honesty, 
                        Ovidius.

  Ovidius laughs in nervous relief.

                                          OVIDIUS
                        You're not going to kill me, then?

                                        BATIATUS
                        No.
                                  a beat)(
                      My slave is going to kill you.

  Barca emerges from behind Ovidius, still cloaked in shadow. 
  All that is visible are the whites of his eyes and his 

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    39.

  smile. SLOW PUSH IN ON Ovidius' terrified Son as we hear 
  SCREAMS and the BREAKING OF BONES OFF SCREEN. Finally, 
  Ovidius' blood soaked body falls to the ground.

                                          BATIATUS(cont'd)

                        ground. But first... attend to the 
                        child.

  Batiatus exits. Barca turns to the child. Killing him is 
  clearly something he does not want to do. OFF Ovidius' Son 
  as Barca steps towards him, WIPING US TO --



  Naevia escorts Crixus down the stairs leading to the storage 
  area adjacent to the mess hall. As they reach the landing, 
  she pauses, breaking the silence with a whisper.

                                        NAEVIA
                        You're going to die tomorrow. 
                        Aren't you?

  Crixus sees the fear in her eyes. And something else.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Only the gods divine the future.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Why didn't you let Ilithyia help 
                        you? She could have spoken to her 
                        father --

                                        CRIXUS
                      To what end? Disgrace?

                                        NAEVIA
                        Honor and glory. That's all you 
                        care about, isn't it?

                                        CRIXUS
                        No. Not all.

  He gently touches her cheek. Her heart seizes in her chest.

                                        NAEVIA
                        Still the fool.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Still.

  He leans down and softly kisses her.  Tears stain her cheeks 
  as she returns it.  Passion rises, born of the desperate 
  moment.  He pulls her into the shadows, his hand moving up 
  her thigh, lifting her dress.  Naevia stops him.

                                        NAEVIA
                        You said love drains a man.

                      Or it can fill him with hope, in 
                        the proper arms...

  He kisses her again.  She takes his hand and moves it back 
  to her thigh.  He lifts her dress.  She gasps as he slips 
  inside her.  MOVE OFF of them to find a GUARD passing on the 
  other side of the gate, unaware of their presence as he 
  WIPES US TO --



  Spartacus sits awake in the barracks, Sura's binding 
  considered between his fingers.

                                        VARRO
                        The odds do not favor you.

  Spartacus glances over to find Varro still not yet asleep.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        They seldom do.

                                        VARRO
                        I've heard Barca has laid a large 
                        amount of coin on you.  Well, more 
                        towards Crixus, but still...

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And you?

                                        VARRO
                      If I had the means, I would wager 
                        all with Barca. You're too fucking 
                        stubborn to die.

  Spartacus can't help but chuckle at that.

                                          SPARTACUS
                        And yet every man has his end.

                                        VARRO
                        I pray to the gods you have not yet 
                        reached yours.

                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    41.

                      If they do not answer, I would ask 
                        a thing of you.

  Varro's eyes shift to Sura's binding.

                                        VARRO
                        Your wife?

  Spartacus nods, emotion blocking further words.

                                          VARRO(cont'd)
                        I will do everything I can to find 
                        her. Now sleep. Tomorrow you face a 
                        legend. And may yet become one 
                        yourself.

  Varro closes his eyes. PUSH IN on Spartacus as he brings the 
  binding close to his lips, lost in thought, sleep denied 
  him... PRE-LAP: The ROAR of the CROWD and the CLASH OF 
  SWORDS rises to a deafening pitch...



  The Magistrate's VOICE echoes in the background.

                                          MAGISTRATE CALAVIUS (O.S.)
                      In the name of my forefathers, I, 
                        Titus Calavius, bestow unto you, 
                        the final event! In the tradition 
                      of gladiatorial combat, a spectacle 
                      of blood and death, a sacrifice to 
                        Ceres, the great goddess of 
                        renewal! May she wet our lands with 
                        her lips and shower us with an 
                        ocean of rain!

  Spartacus tightens Sura's binding around his wrist. Crixus 
  stands ready, muscles coiled like steel. Doctore looks out 
  through the gate across the arena, remembering that day 
  years ago when he was set against the Shadow.


                                                                          (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.

                                          DOCTORE
                        The hour of my glory is long past.
                                (to Spartacus and 
                                  Crixus)
                        Yours stands before you. Bring 
                        peace to old wounds. And kill that 
                        fucking son of a whore.

  Doctore moves away from the gate. Crixus and Spartacus step 
  forward. A beat.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Your woman.  She's the reason you 
                        refuse to die?

                                          SPARTACUS
                        She is.

  Crixus looks out across the arena, his eyes finding Naevia 
  in the pulvinus.  A beat before he responds to Spartacus, 
  not looking at the man.

                                        CRIXUS
                        Perhaps there is something beyond 
                        glory after all.

  Spartacus glances at Crixus in surprise. Has common ground 
  just been found? TRUMPETS sound. Crixus pulls on his 
  polished helmet. Spartacus follows suit. The gate grinds 
  open. Spartacus and Crixus are handed their swords and 
  shields.
