                                           TEASER

      FADE IN:

      EXT. SMALL TOWN. MAIN STREET - DAY (D/1)11

      TIGHT ON A CROW -- it swivels to stare at us.

      The crow is perched on a TV aerial on a roof in old fashioned 
      blue-collar Boonville, California.  A church spire in the 
      middle distance.  Trees, rolling hills.     

      Cody Elkins' MISSING PERSON FLYER is nailed to every 
      telephone pole on the street.  We hold a beat on Cody's face: 
      an All-American, freckle-faced sixteen-year-old posed for a 
      school photo. 

      Along with a couple local PD cruisers, two CBI vehicles are 
      parked curbside.  JANE and LISBON have just arrived.  RIGSBY 
      and VAN PELT are there to give them the rundown as they walk 
      down the street... 

                                  RIGSBY
                    Kid's name is Cody Elkins.  Sixteen 
                    years old.  Reported missing two 
                    days ago.  Turned serious enough to 
                    call us when the local police found 
                    this, two streets away in the 
                    gutter.  

      He holds up a baggy containing a boy's sneaker, close to box 
      fresh except for a big red-brown stain. 

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    It's the kid's shoe, his blood 
                    type.  We're waiting on the DNA, 
                    but we figure we got an abduction, 
                    and potential homicide, which makes 
                    it a CBI case.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    The parents are Michael and Janice, 
                    both clean.  Another son named 
                    Brad, fourteen.  They run the 
                    flower store here.  Cho's with them 
                    now.

      Van Pelt points out a FLOWER AND GIFT STORE -- a converted 
      gas station just down the street.  We see CHO with MICHAEL 
      and JANICE ELKINS inside.

      JANE'S POV:  He notes THREE LONG-HAIRED LITTLE KIDS -- eight, 
      nine and ten-years-old, all in black like hard-core skaters.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        1A.
      CONTINUED:11

      They're standing on the other side of the street staring at 
      the flower store, two bikes lying beside them.  














































                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        2.
      CONTINUED: (2)11

      They look oddly sinister.  As Lisbon and Rigsby turn to walk 
      into the Elkins' store, Jane hangs back.  

                                  JANE
                    I'll wait out here.  

      Lisbon shrugs, used to his mercurial ways.  She and Van Pelt 
      and Rigsby enter the store.

      Jane very casually picks up a billiard ball size rock off the 
      ground and strolls across the street, angling  toward the 
      three kids.  As soon as they show signs of moving off at his 
      approach, Jane stops.  He shows them the rock in his hand.  
      Throws it high up in the air.  The kids follow the rock's 
      flight up and down.  Jane catches it without looking.  Does 
      it again, higher this time.  And again, only this time, the 
      rock doesn't come down (because he dropped it in his pocket 
      and mimed throwing it), and by the time the kids look back at 
      Jane, puzzled, he's standing right next to them.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Hi.  

      They make a half-hearted attempt to go for their bikes, but 
      Jane is already there.  Holding one of the two bikes by the 
      handlebars.  It's a pink girl's BMX bike.  Complete with 
      tasseled grips.  

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Hey, nice bike. 

      The kids are well aware of the shameful appearance of the 
      bike and aggrieved by Jane drawing attention to it.  The 
      eldest of them tries to take back the bike.

                                  KID #1
                    Yeah.  Ha ha.  Give it.

      Jane doesn't give it.

                                  JANE
                    A boy's got to be anxious to get 
                    somewhere to ride a bike like this.  

                                  KID #1
                    Huh?

                                  JANE
                    You didn't ride a pink bike through 
                    town to come look at a store.  What 
                    did you come to see? 

      All three kids sense this conversation is not going well for 
      them and the younger two back away slightly.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        3.
      CONTINUED: (3)11

                                  KID #2
                    Let's go, Clyde.

                                  CLYDE (KID #1)
                    Give it!

                                  JANE
                    Where's Cody Elkins? 

      Quick anxious glances between the younger two children tell 
      Jane and us that they know something.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    I know that you know where he is.  

                                  KID #2
                    Let's go, Clyde!

                                  JANE 
                    You don't need to tell me out loud.  
                    Just look in his direction.

      The youngest of the kids, just for an instant, looks past the 
      flower shop. 

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                          (pointing)
                    That way?

      Clyde looks daggers at the little kid...

                                  CLYDE
                      Samatterwityou?

      ...Which confirms the hint.  Jane's POV:  Looking across the 
      street, to the trees seen from a distance, behind the flower 
      shop.  Which takes on a slightly sinister vibe.  A MOB OF 
      CROWS circle in the sky above treetops a quarter mile away.  

                                  JANE 
                    Thanks.

      Jane hands the bike back to the oldest kid, who replies by 
      giving him the horned devil sign with his left hand, and 
      muttering a curse under his breath.  Then the three children 
      speed away toward town, the youngest standing with easy 
      aplomb on the extended axle rods of the non-pink bike.  Jane 
      watches them go as Lisbon approaches.

                                  LISBON
                    We're bringing the Elkins back to 
                    their house.  

      In the BG, Van Pelt and Rigsby EXIT the flower shop.  Cho 
      escorts Michael and Janice Elkins to the CBI vehicle.  


                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        4.

      Lisbon gestures to the kids, disappearing on their bikes.

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    What was that about?

                                  JANE
                    I have a pretty good idea where 
                    Cody Elkins is.

                                  LISBON
                    Sharing is good.

      JANE'S POV: A copse of trees, the tops of which peek out over 
      the rooftops at the end of the street.  Crows circling.

66EXT. PINE GROVE - DAY 

      As Jane leads Lisbon, Van Pelt and Rigsby through the 
      trees...

                                  LISBON
                    What makes you think he's here?

                                  JANE
                    Because those kids gave it away.  
                         And t hey smel l ed of  pi ne.   

                                  VAN PELT
                    There's pine trees all over around 
                    here.

      Jane stops, looks up. 

                                  JANE
                    But these trees have crows.  

                                  VAN PELT
                    So?

                                  JANE
                    Crows are carrion birds.  They eat 
                    dead things.

      Jane, Lisbon, Rigsby and Van Pelt move through the trees, 
      searching, finally coming upon a dappled sunlit grove.  They 
      all look down at the dead body of CODY ELKINS.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Ah jeez...

      Cody's lying on the ground at the foot of a tree as if posed 
      in a coffin, his hands crossed over his chest.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        4A.

      There's burnt-out tea CANDLES on either side of his head, and 
      at his shoeless feet, a pentacle, made from twigs.  The crows 
      have pecked his eyes out.

                                        ACT ONE

      FADE IN:

      EXT. PINE GROVE - DAY (D/1 CONT'D)6A6A

      While Van Pelt watches a pair of CORONER'S MEN put the body 
      on a gurney, Rigsby addresses a posse of UNIFORM COPS as they 
      systematically search the area for clues.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Number one, we're looking for a 
                    murder weapon, but anything you 
                    find, anything at all, bag it and 
                    tag it.

      The dead boy's arm hangs over the side of the gurney.         
      Van Pelt gently takes the boy's hand, and places his arm 
      gently across his chest. 

77INT. LIVING ROOM. ELKINS HOUSE - DAY 

      A modest home.  Nothing fancy about it.  Lots of Cody's 
      football trophies and stuff serve as decor.  Cody's parents, 
      MICHAEL and JANICE ELKINS, (40) and Cody's brother, BRAD, 
      (14) -- a slightly nerdy, intense, emo kid are on the couch 
      together, holding hands. 

      Lisbon and CHO talk with them as Jane moves around the room, 
      touching and looking, absorbing the Elkins' vibe. 

                                  LISBON
                    When did you last see Cody?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Friday night after the game.  Cody 
                    plays wide receiver for the high 
                    school team.  They got blown out on 
                    Friday, but it's a pretty good team 
                    this year.  Nationally ranked.   

                                  LISBON
                    When exactly did you see him last 
                    on Friday?

                    When he went to bed.  We were all  
                    three of us out of the house early 
                    the next morning.  By the time we 
                    came home, around midday, Cody was 
                    gone.  He was supposed to go meet 
                    the coach for some extra practice, 
                    but he never showed up. 



                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        7.

      Janice starts crying, which makes Brad get up and ghost out 
      of the room.  Jane watches him go.

                                  LISBON
                    That Friday night, what was his 
                    state of mind?   

                                  JANICE
                    He was fine.  Fine.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Well, he was a little angry with 
                    himself about the game.  

      Janice acknowledges the truth of that.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    He had made some mental errors.  
                    Coach Dee got on him pretty good, 
                    and Cody kind of pushed back some.  

                                  LISBON
                    They had a fight?

                                    MICHAEL
                    You could say.  But you know, 
                    locker room stuff.  A lot of 
                    shouting.  Nothing serious. 
                    Cody just wanted to do better.   

                                  JANICE
                    How, how did he die?

                                  CHO
                    There were indications around the 
                    body of some kind of black magic 
                    ritual.  Did he have any friends or 
                      acquaintances who were involved in 
                    that kind of thing?

      Michael and Janice react strongly, look at each other wide-
      eyed.

                                  JANICE
                    Oh my God.  It was her.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Of course.

                    Who's her?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Tamzin Dove.  She's into all that 
                    black magic stuff.  

                                  JANICE
                    Claims she's a witch.  Says she has 
                    powers.

                                  LISBON
                    And she had some resentment toward  
                    Cody?

                                    MICHAEL
                    About a week ago, she accused him 
                    of stealing her cat.

                                  LISBON
                    Did he?

                                  JANICE 
                    No.  Of course not.  But she said 
                    she put a spell on him in revenge. 

      Jane's suddenly interested.

                                  JANE
                    A spell?  What kind of a spell?

                                  JANICE
                    I don't know.  But she actually 
                    called him and told him that she'd 
                    done it.  

                                  LISBON
                    That must have been worrisome.

                                    MICHAEL
                    At the time, Cody thought it was 
                    kind of funny.  I mean, she's a 
                    geek.  That's why we didn't think 
                    of her right away.    

                                  LISBON
                    Where can we find Tamzin Dove?

88EXT. ELKINS HOUSE - DAY 

      As Lisbon, Cho and Jane exit the Elkins house, Lisbon is on 
      her phone...




                                                                            (CONTINUED)        THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        9.

99EXT. PINE GROVE - DAY 

      Rigsby and Van Pelt walking away from the crime scene. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    Oh.  Be careful.

      INTER-CUT BETWEEN LISBON AND VAN PELT:

                                  LISBON
                          (skeptical)
                    Yeah yeah.  Find anything useful 
                    there?

                                  VAN PELT
                    Nothing.  No murder weapon, and not 
                    a lot of blood.  Looks like he was 
                    killed elsewhere.  ME estimates 
                    he's been dead since Saturday 
                    morning, cause being several blows 
                    of a heavy blunt object, like a 
                    crowbar or a pipe maybe.

                                  LISBON
                    Okay.  I want you guys to check up 
                    on Cody's school football coach.  
                    He and the kid had a disagreement 
                    Friday night, and they were 
                    supposed to meet Saturday morning.  

                                  VAN PELT 
                    Got it.

      We leave Lisbon.  Van Pelt pockets her phone.

1010EXT. TAMZIN DOVE'S HOUSE - DAY 

      An ordinary little ranch house.  

      Lisbon, Cho and Jane go to the front door.  No bell.  A 
      goat's head door knocker.  

                                  CHO
                    Look.
                          (off knocker)
                    A goat.  Goats are signs of Satan.

                                  LISBON
                    So petting zoos are like, gateways 
                    to Hell?  

                                  CHO
                    Pretty much. 

      With that, Lisbon KNOCKS.  No answer.  She looks down.  The 
      patio slab is adorned with a pentacle inside a circle.  They 
      are standing in its center.  She gestures to it.

                                  LISBON
                    Another bad sign.

      Cho steps gingerly out of the pentacle.  He peers through the 
      window.

                    BOO!

      Cho jumps.

                    about this kind of stuff.

                                  LISBON
                    Looks like nobody's home.

                    Not much security for a servant of 
                    the devil.  

      On the ground, Jane spots a rusty old PAPERCLIP.  He kneels, 
      picks it up.

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I could pick the lock with this in 
                    five seconds.

                                  LISBON
                    We'll wait.

      JANE'S POV:  the three long-haired Kids from the teaser are 
      standing on the other side of the road watching them.      
      Jane pretends not to see them, and turns to Cho and Lisbon, 
      and talks as if they were stalking deer.

                                  JANE
                    Don't look at them now, but I think 
                    those kids may know where Tamzin 
                    Dove is.  

                                  LISBON
                    What kids?

      Jane looks.  They've vanished.  There's no sign of them. 

                                  JANE
                    Damn.

                                  LISBON 
                    Same kids you saw at the Elkins?

                    For some serious fumble prevention 
                    reps.  He never showed.

                    We heard you and he had serious 
                    words Friday night.

                                  COACH
                    Yeah.  We did.  Cody had a shameful 
                    game.  Zero TDs, two fumbles, five 
                    blown routes, and a personal foul 
                    for fifteen yard penalty.  He let 
                    himself down and he let his team 
                    down.  Been his m.o. lately.  
                    That's why we were meeting Saturday 
                    morning.  Get him back on track.

1313INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 

      As Rigsby and Van Pelt move through rows of lockers, benches, 
      used towels strewn about, etc, Rigsby swipes a FOOTBALL off 
      the floor.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Hey, think fast.

      Rigsby tosses it to Van Pelt.  She stands there as Rigsby 
      goes out for a pass like a tight-end...

                                  RIGSBY (CONT D)
                    Hit me, I'm open.

      Van Pelt has a keen sense of dignity whilst on duty and 
      resists her immediate impulse to throw like the jock she 
      is...

                                  VAN PELT
                    Uh, no?

                                  RIGSBY
                    What kind of a coach's kid are you?  
                    Your daddy would be ashamed.

                                  VAN PELT
                    Fine.  Go long.

      Rigsby runs out.  Van Pelt makes the pass.  With precision.  
      And speed.  Rigsby catches it.  Impressed.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        14A.

      Rigsby examines the contents.  A bikini'd pin-up girl and 
      assorted jock stuff.  He finds a WHITE T-SHIRT with spattered 
      blood on it. Rigsby shows it to Van Pelt.

      Jane goes to the front door and uses the paperclip to pick

                    Never mind.

      Jane gestures for Cho and Lisbon to enter.  Lisbon does.  Cho 
      looks hesitant.  Lisbon stops, turns to Cho...

      Led by Jane, Lisbon and Cho enter and move through a darkly 
      pagan, but stylish Wiccan home (DECOR TBD).  

      Jane enters the LIVING ROOM, and finds Tamzin Dove -- zaftig, 
      big hair, dressed in romantic black -- sitting in an arm 
      chair, a table set with a steaming teapot, and four cups.  
      Tamzin's manner is weird, abstracted, as if she's living on a 
      different astral plane, seeing things that we can't.  It's 
      hard to tell if she's play-acting or a little nuts, maybe a 
      bit of both.

      Jane sits down.  Cho and Lisbon perforce, do the same, just a 
      little freaked out.

                                  LISBON

                    Of course.  I heard what was done 
                    to Cody Elkins.  They used a 
                    pentacle and a flame.  Made it look

      Tamzin Dove comes from the kitchen with a plate of cookies. 
      Offers them around.  Jane takes one.  Lisbon declines, as 
      does Cho.

                                  LISBON
                    Those details about the pentacle

                    care of Cody.  You can't help him.

                    True.  We can't.  What we can do is 
                    find and punish the people that

                    There's no need.  Cody deserved to

                    stole and tortured and killed my 
                    cat.  I saw him take it.

                    horned God and the triple Goddess.  
                    We're healers mostly, but we have 
                    the magic also, when needed.  
                    Spells and so forth.

                    Did you put a spell on Cody Elkins?

                                  TAMZIN
                    I did.  I put a killing spell on 
                    him. 

      Reactions all round.

                                    TAMZIN(CONT'D)
                    I've done the spell several times 
                    before, but this is the first time 
                    it's worked.

                                  JANE
                    What does this spelling involve?  
                    What do you do exactly?

      EXT. BACKYARD. TAMZIN DOVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT (N/1)1717

      Tamzin moulds a rough little paper man out of old newspapers 
      and mud, puts him on a little stone plinth.  Jane, Lisbon, 
      and Cho watch.  

                                  TAMZIN
                    Killing spells are secret.  But 
                    this is a public binding spell that 
                    I can show you, and it's similar.

      Tamzin turns to Cho and asks conversationally...

                                  TAMZIN (CONT D)
                          (to Cho)
                    What's your name?

                                  CHO
                    What's it to you?

                                  JANE
                    Kimball Cho.

                                  CHO
                    Hey. 

                                  TAMZIN
                    God and Goddess hear me.  By light 
                    of the one flame, let this mortal 
                    soul Kimball Cho be bound by my 
                    power.  So that he knows I speak 
                    truth, let him behold the Lord of 
                    Beasts and kneel before him.

                    Come on. 

      SHE LIGHTS THE PAPER DOLL ON FIRE with a candle, and as it 
      burns, she SPEAKS IN TONGUES, in Latin, in a strange cadence.  

                                  TAMZIN
                    Sententia separati vos estis,
                    iam non estis,
                    iam vos unus estis,
                    unisonum vinculum exorsum est.

      When the doll is all burnt up, she sweeps the ashes into an 
      empty jelly jar.

                                  LISBON
                          (light contempt)
                    That's it?  That's your witchcraft?    
                    You don't give them a potion to 
                    drink or anything like that?

                                  TAMZIN
                    Doesn't look like much, does it?  
                    But it's very powerful magic. 

                                  LISBON
                    Yeah, okay.  Unfortunately it looks 
                    like one of your friends helped 
                    your magical powers along with a 
                    blunt instrument.  In which case 
                    you're as unmagically guilty as 
                    they are.

                                  TAMZIN
                    If a friend of mine had done this, 
                    they wouldn't have pointed the 
                    police right to me with the 
                    pentacle and fire.  Cody's murder 
                    was staged to look like Wicca.  Any 
                    fool in this town would think of 
                    it.  It's obvious misdirection.  
                    There's a witch in town.  Duh.    

                                  LISBON
                    A witch that put a killing spell on 
                    the boy in question.

      Tamzin smiles.

                                  TAMZIN
                    Exactly.  It's perfect.

      Lisbon gives her a dry cop gaze.  



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST        "Red Rum"        SALMON 11/12/08        21.

                    Thanks for your time. 

      Lisbon walks away, Jane follows.  Cho is rooted to the spot, 
      gazing anxiously at the ashes of the doll in the jelly jar. 

                                  JANE
                    Cho...

      Cho shakes himself, follows.  Tamzin watches them go, a 
      little disappointed the fun's over.

      EXT. DRIVEWAY. TAMZIN DOVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT1818

      Jane, Lisbon and Cho walking away...

                                  JANE
                    Why didn't you bring her in?

                                  LISBON 
                    You don't think she did this do 
                    you?

                                  JANE
                    No, but she's deep in it somehow, 
                    and she's hiding something.  Or 
                    someone.

                                  LISBON
                    I agree.  And I'd bring her in, but 
                    on what charges?  She's a whackjob, 
                    she wants the attention.  Quicker 
                    and more efficient if we ignore 
                    her, and let her come to us.

                                  JANE
                    That's very astute psychology, 
                    Lisbon.  I'm impressed.

      Lisbon lightly smacks him backhanded for his patronizing 
      manner.  Cho does the same thing, harder for his own 
      reasons...

                                  CHO 
                    Why'd you give her my name?
                    She said I was going to kneel 
                    before the Lord of Beasts.  What 
                    does that even mean?

      Jane realizes Cho's serious.

                                  JANE 
                    Come on, you're not telling me you 
                    believe she's a real witch?

                                  CHO 
                    No, of course not.  But I mean,   
                    if dark forces did exist, stands to 
                    reason there could be people who 
                    control them for their own ends.

                                  JANE 
                    They're called investment bankers, 
                    and they don't live around here.  
                    There's no such thing as witches. 

                                  CHO
                    Easy for you to say.  A weird woman 
                    in black didn't burn you in effigy 
                    and bind you to her power.

                                  RIGSBY
                    So that you can explain why 
                    forensics tells us your blood is 
                    all over a T-shirt we found in

      Coach Dieter sighs, looks embarrassed.

                                  COACH
                    I told you.  We had an argument.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Now you're saying you had an actual 
                    fist fight?  He drew blood?

                                  COACH
                    Yeah.  It was no big deal.         
                    I chewed him out.  He got mad, took 
                    a couple swings at me. 

      Rigsby grins at Dieter.

                    What?  No.  I was embarrassed.  
                    People don't know the kid is a

                    got mad over a card game or some 
                    crap, and beat Danno unconscious.  
                    Had to be dragged off him.

                    You had to be there.

                      Seriously, don't sweat it.  We had 
                    a witch at my college.  It's not a 
                    satanic cult.  They're nerds in 
                    cloaks.

                    There he is.

      Cho's pointing out the window at DANIEL BROWN, (16) exiting 
      school.  A backpack hangs off his shoulder.

      Rigsby and Cho get out of the car, come up on Daniel.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Daniel Brown.

                    CBI.  We've got some questions 
                    about Cody Elkins.

      But Daniel suddenly does an about-face and in true form, 
      Daniel dodges both Rigsby and Cho, as if he's making his way 
      down the field, runs back toward the street.  

      Rigsby and Cho TAKE OFF after him, giving chase down the road 
      when a PANEL TRUCK approaches AT SPEED.  The truck brakes 
      hard, and swerves to a stop, narrowly missing Cho, forcing 
      him to jump out of the way. 

      Rigsby tackles Daniel Brown down to the neighbor's lawn.   
      Kneeling, Cho starts to help Rigsby cuff him.

      The audience sees before Cho and Rigsby do that the panel 
      truck -- large in BG -- has A PAINTED LION ALONG THE SIDE, 
      WEARING A CROWN -- and a caption that reads: KINGSLY CARPET 
      CLEANERS.

      Cho stops dead and stares at the lion.

      Cho's pointing at the truck.

      Cho gazes at the lion in something like awe.

      INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CBI HQ - DAY (D/2 CONT'D)2222

      RIGSBY walks in hard and fast, sits across the table from 
      DANIEL BROWN, trying to rattle him a little.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Tell me about your fight with Cody 
                    Elkins.  

                                  DANIEL
                    What fight?  There was no fight.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Oh?  He beat you unconscious is 
                    what we heard.  We have witnesses.

                                  DANIEL
                    Who?  No.  Wasn't that bad.  

                                  RIGSBY
                    Put you in the hospital.

                                  DANIEL
                    For a couple hours.  Observation.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Why didn't you press charges?

                                  DANIEL
                    It was a misunderstanding between 
                    friends.  Nobody's fault.

                    He keeps glancing down.  Classic 
                    sign of guilt.  Listen to the flat 
                    cadence.  Rehearsed.  He's lying.

                    Perhaps you figured to get revenge 
                    more directly.

                                  DANIEL
                    No.

                                  RIGSBY
                    How did the fight start?

                                  DANIEL
                    We were over at Roy T's place 
                    playing cards, drinking.  His mom's 
                    in rehab so he's got the run of the 
                    place.  I did some trash talking 
                    and Cody got mad.  We fought.  He 
                    won.  That's all.   

      Jane enters, pulls up a chair close, so that his knees touch 
      Daniel's.  

                                  JANE
                    Look in my eyes.

      Daniel is not keen, but obeys.  

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                          (forcefully but calm)
                    Don't look away.  What did you say 
                    that angered Cody?

                                  DANIEL
                    You know it's a card game, lot of 
                    trash talking.  I was tripping on 
                    his family, like your mama's a ho, 
                    your dad's a punk bitch...  

      Daniel's eyes drop and go back to Jane.  It's hard to keep 
      eye contact. 

                                  JANE
                    If you don't keep your eyes on me, 
                    I can't tell if you're being 
                    honest.

                                  DANIEL
                    I'm looking at you, man.  Cody went 
                    off.  Baaam.  Smashes a beer bottle 
                    over my head.  No warning.  I'm out 
                    cold, but the guys tell me he tried 
                    to seriously stomp me out.  If they 
                    hadn't of grabbed him, I could be 
                    dead. 

      Beat.

                    Please.  What are the chances?

      They go to the Elkins' front door.  

                                  JANE
                    Life is a million to one.  The 
                    universe is one big coincidence.  
                      Cosmically improbable coincidences

                                  JANE
                    She does admit to putting a spell 
                    on your son, as you said.  But that 
                    doesn't constitute a criminal 
                    offense.  It's protected free 
                    speech.     

                                  JANICE
                    So why are you here?

                                  CHO
                    It seems Cody had some violence 
                    issues that we need to speak about.

                                  JANICE
                    No!  He was a good boy.

      back of the house...

                                  CHO
                    We're not saying otherwise, ma'am, 
                    but if he had problems with his 
                    temper, that might help explain the 
                    context leading to his death.

                    Context in a pig's ear.  You're 
                    blaming Cody for his own murder.

      INT. LIVING ROOM. ELKINS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS2828

                    Alright, I gave Daniel Brown the 
                    money to keep him quiet.  Cody has, 
                    had, a real shot at a college 
                    career.  Would've been the first 
                    Elkins to have that chance.  We 
                    were so proud.  But if coaches hear

                    Tamzin, the Goddess may give you 
                    solace and hope and meaning in your 
                    life, but she can't protect you 
                    from the police out there.   

      Tamzin considers her options.  Relents...

                                  TAMZIN
                    Brad's been an apprentice in my 
                    coven since last autumn equinox. 
                    There's no crime in that.

                                  JANE
                    Kind of young to be a witch, isn't 
                    he? 

                                    TAMZIN.  
                    We're all born witch.  We're all 
                    born in magic.  It's taken from us 
                    as we grow up.   

                                  JANE
                      Interesting, if true.  So what 
                    happened when Brad's parents found 
                    out about this new direction in his 
                    life?

                                  TAMZIN
                    Brad's parents just really hate 
                    witches for some reason.  I mean 
                    like, more than most.  About a 
                    month ago, his mom threatened to 
                    kill me if I ever spoke to him 
                    again.

                    Brad came to me of his own free 
                    will.  He was drawn to Wicca.  
                      I couldn't turn him away. 

                                  JANE
                    How does he feel about the spell 
                    you put on his brother?

                                  TAMZIN
                    He's at peace with it.  That's why 
                    we were conducting the cleansing 
                    ritual.  Brad knows the difference 
                    between the world of magic and the 
                    real world.  He understands I 
                    didn't kill his brother.

                    We're sorry for any inconvenience.  

                                  JANE
                    Strange that none of you told us 
                    about his connection to Tamzin 
                    Dove. 

                                  JANICE
                    We were confused, to be honest with 
                    you.  We don't understand Brad's 
                    obsession with witchcraft.  We want 
                    to understand, we're trying, but 
                    it's, it's disturbing and a little 
                      embarrassing to tell the truth.

      Brad looks grim, but says nothing.  Michael gives him a hug.

                                    MICHAEL
                    But we're in this together, right?

                    Witches have the power of 
                      telekinesis.  She has a spell which 
                    will raise the weapon from wherever 
                    it's been concealed and reveal it

                    You don't know who did it and why?

      Lisbon gives him a deadpan look.

                                  LISBON
                    No.  But you're going to tell me. 

      Jane smiles...

                                  JANE
                    How 'bout I show you?

      He walks off with Lisbon...

      EXT. ELKINS HOUSE - NIGHT5252

      The CAR in the DRIVEWAY starts.  Headlights shine bright as 
      the vehicle pulls out and drives down the STREET...

52A52AINT. CBI VEHICLE #2. ELKINS HOUSE - NIGHT 

      ...the vehicle passing US.  Jane and Lisbon are in the front 
      seat.  They've been waiting for this.

                                  LISBON
                    Here we go.

      As Lisbon starts the engine --

                    You better call Cho.

      Lisbon dials her cell and they set off to follow the Elkins' 
      car.  

      EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT5353

      ELKINS' CAR in motion...

      EXT. BRIDGE OVER RIVER - NIGHT5454

      The Elkins' car pulls over at the bankside.  We now reveal 
      Michael, who gets out with a small bundle and walks to the 
      river's edge.  He gets set to throw the bundle into the 
      river. 

      A CAR'S HEADLIGHTS COME ON.

      Michael shields his eyes...

                                  CHO
                    Drop it, Michael!  Put it down, now!

      But Michael doesn't.  Instead, he runs in the opposite 
      direction.  Until ANOTHER BLINDING SET OF HEADLIGHTS stop him 
      in his tracks.   

                                  LISBON
                    You're not going anywhere.  Just 
                    drop it!  

      Realizing he's cornered, Michael looks around, bewildered, 
      drops the bundle...

      INSERT - The bundle on the ground is A MONKEY WRENCH, wrapped 
      in a rag.  

      Michael raises his hands in the air.  Giving in.

                                  JANE (O.S.)

5656INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CBI HQ - NIGHT 

      The monkey wrench, lies on the table.  Jane and Lisbon talk 
      with Michael...

                                  JANE 
                    Amazing, isn't it?  The murder 
                    weapon revealed.  Tamzin's spells 
                    really work.  She really is a witch 
                    I guess.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I don't know what you're talking 
                    about.

                                  LISBON 
                    I'm sure the forensics will confirm 
                    your son's blood and tissue on one 
                    end of that wrench.  Your 
                      fingerprints on the other.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I have no knowledge of that.

                                  LISBON
                    Why else would you be trying to 
                    hide it?  Tell us what happened, 
                    Michael.  Maybe there were 
                      circumstances.  Maybe you had to 
                    defend yourself.

                                    MICHAEL
                    I don't have to explain anything.

                    emergency room?  Their broken 
                    bones?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Just clumsy, I guess.  A little 
                    dense at times.

                                  JANE
                    Good thing they had you to keep 
                    them in line, eh?  Some people 
                    don't understand how lucky they 
                    have it.

                                    MICHAEL
                    That's right.

      Michael nods in agreement, until he looks up to find Jane 
      looking back at him with malice.   

      (Jane not only sees a murderer, but a man who is lucky enough 
      to have his family, yet chose to betray them.)

                                  JANE
                      I realized it was you when Brad 
                    said he liked going to Tamzin's 
                    house, because he felt safe there.  
                    Safe.  Who feels safer at a witch's 
                    house than they do at home?
                          (beat)
                    You've been beating and abusing 
                    your wife and sons for years, 
                    haven't you?

                                    MICHAEL
                    No.

                                  JANE
                    Cody finally stood up to you, 
                    didn't he?  What was it that 
                    finally set him off?
                          (beat)
                    My guess, you started smacking Brad 
                    around a little too much.  Cody 
                    wanted to protect his brother.   
                    Was that it?

                                    MICHAEL
                    No.

                                  JANE
                    No, he says.  Your wife and son are 
                    down the hallway.  They say no too.

      FLASHBACK

      INT. GARAGE - NIGHT (N/0)5757

      MOS Michael's pushing his son in the chest, haranguing him 
      about something.  Cody takes it and takes it, then pushes 
      back.  Michael is enraged.  A spittle flecked red-faced scary 
      rage.  But Cody is mad too. 

                                  JANE (V.O.)
                    And you could not hear that.  Could 
                    not hear that.

      Cody picks up a monkey wrench off the shelf.  Mistake.  
      Michael's anger finds another gear.  He snatches the wrench 
      from his son, and smashes him upside the head with it.  
      Several times.

      Jane stands abruptly.  Got the confession they need.

                    Goodbye, Michael.

      He exits.  Lisbon takes a beat, pulls her seat closer to 
      Michael...

5959INT. HALLWAY/OUTSIDE WAITING ROOM. CBI HQ - NIGHT 

      Jane walks down the hallway, passing the spartan ROOM where 
      Janice and Brad are, well, waiting.

      He passes the room quickly, deliberately avoiding their gaze; 
      walks a bit further and stops.  Thinks.  Dammit.  He goes 
      back to the    waiting room, enters.  

      INT. WAITING ROOM. CBI HQ - CONTINUOUS6060

      We see through the window as Jane closes the door behind him.  
      Sits with an anxious Janice and Brad.  We're unable to hear 
      what Jane says, but we know we're watching him tell them what 
      really happened to Cody.  

      As Jane rests his hand on Janice's knee, she deflates.  Tears 
      flow, yes, of sadness, heartbreak, what she always feared 
      could happen.  But amidst the horror, Janice grabs Brad's 
      hand, and we sense the slightest glimmer of relief, the two 
      knowing that all these years of terror and anguish have 
      finally come to an end...

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

                    place.

      Jane moves on.  Cho is mightily relieved to have possession 
      of the ashes, and clutches the jar to his bosom as if it were 
      a precious living thing. 

                                                                          FADE OUT.
