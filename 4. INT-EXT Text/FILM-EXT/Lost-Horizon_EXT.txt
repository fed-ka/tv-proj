1. LONG SHOT
The field is aflare with floodlights
- on one side is an office building
- on the other are hangars. The whole
field is filled with Chinese refugees
running around wildly. An Army transport
is in front of the office building,
motors going.
2. REVERSE SHOT
Showing in the distance, probably several
miles away, the effect of a burning
city, which is Baskul. Over the shot
we hear the steady boom-boom of gunfire.
In the f.g., we see the silhouetted
figures of Chinese running away from
Baskul and toward the Camera, their
personal packs on their backs.
3. MED. CLOSE SHOT
Toward office building. Conway comes
out of the building, followed by a small
group of white people with frightened
faces. They have to fight their way
through a horde of milling Chinese.
4. MEDIUM SHOT
As Conway and group finally reach the
plane where Conway forces the white
people in. In this he is aided by his
brother, George, a young and vigorous
Englishman. The pilot sticks his head
out of the cockpit.
? 472 ?
PILOT
Conway, we can't take more than seven!
Conway pulls a passenger out and gives
the pilot a signal to start.
CONWAY
(to passenger)
All right. I'm sorry. There will be
another plane in a minute. All right
- go on.
5. LONG SHOT
Motors roar, and the plane starts to
move, scattering those of the Chinese
who were unfortunately too close to
the ship. Conway and George rush back
into the office building.
14. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR
Conway rushing out, meets George coming
back.
GEORGE
The power house - they've blown it up!
The planes can't land without lights.
? 475 ?
CONWAY
(thinking fast)
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That
will make light for them!
He grabs a lantern and dashes off.
15. MEDIUM SHOT
As they run through the screaming mob
toward the hangar.
INTERIOR HANGAR
16. FULL SHOT
It is filled with Chinese refugees clinging
to their household goods. Conway and
George enter. Conway speaks to them
in Chinese, ordering them out. Some
hesitate, and they have to push the
terror-stricken waiting coolies out.
When they have all left, Conway opens
the spigots of several gasoline tanks,
waits for the fuel to spill on the ground,
then tosses a lantern on the fuel, igniting
a blaze. At the same moment, he and
George dash for the door.

17. LONG SHOT
Conway and George rush out of hangar.
When they are at a fairly safe distance,
the building bursts into flames.

(to George)
We go on to the next plane. Bring out
any people that are left.
GEORGE
Right, Bob.
20. REVERSE ANGLE - LONG SHOT
Shooting toward the burning city of
Baskul in the distance. We see the bandits
coming, flashing bayonets, in pursuit
of screaming refugees.
21. MED. SHOT FRONT OF OFFICE BUILDING
Conway emerges, followed by Gloria,
and an American, Barnard. CAMERA FOLLOWS
THEM to the ship just as the pilot,
Fenner, is climbing down from cockpit.
CONWAY
Hello, Fenner.
FENNER
(broad grin)
Hello, Conway. Having a little trouble?
? 476 ?
CONWAY
You never mind me. Get this gadget off
the ground.
George is pushing off Chinese.
GEORGE
Bob, these are all that are left.
CONWAY
(to George)
Come on! Quick! This way.
22. MED. SHOT AT PLANE
When Conway and others approach, George
helps Gloria Stone up, while Conway
faces the mob, punching at those who
try to wedge their way forward. Finally
one of them manages to get his foot
on the step, and Conway pushes him violently.
23. CLOSE SHOT - MAN
Who staggers back and falls, sprawling.
As he hits the ground, he yells:
MAN
You can't leave me here, you blighter.[2]
I'm a British subject!
We meet Alexander P. Lovett.
24. MEDIUM SHOT
Conway looks his surprise and lifts
him off the ground.
25. CLOSE SHOT - A CHINAMAN
Glaring off toward Conway, picks up
a board and starts toward Conway.
26. MED. CLOSE SHOT ENTRANCE TO SHIP
George emerges in time to see the Chinese
lift the board and about to clout Conway
on the head. George moves quickly, puts
out his left hand, wards off the blow
and with his right he punches the Chinese,
who reels out of the scene.
GEORGE
Look out, Bob!
27. MEDIUM SHOT
A shadowy figure materializes in the
cockpit, and clubs Fenner from behind.
He shoves Fenner aside and takes his
place.
28. MEDIUM SHOT
Conway pushes George up and starts to
mount himself. He looks off - and what
he sees startles him.
CONWAY
(yells off)
All right, Fenner! Go ahead!
? 477 ?
29. LONG SHOT
Of what Conway sees. Several trucks
loaded with bandits - in makeshift uniforms
- come tearing up the road - come to
a stop. Some fire toward plane - others
are setting up machine guns. Droves
of refugees scramble to cover.
32. LONG SHOT
As the plane swings around - taxies
crazily - and leaves the ground, accompanied
by gunfire of the bandits.
41. LONG SHOT OF PLANE
Flying at high speed against a moonlit
sky. We stay on the shot until it vanishes,
a mere speck, over the horizon.

in a sharp descent.
51. MEDIUM SHOT
Plane starting toward ground. All we

53. LONG SHOT
From angle in cabin of plane. Through

We see a swarm of strange-looking natives,
scantily attired, but bearing bayonets,
running toward the plane.
56. MEDIUM SHOT
As the plane taxies across the uninhabited
space.
INTERIOR PLANE
57. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR
Conway and George ready to get out.
As Conway turns to open the door, he
looks off and is startled by something
he sees. George follows his gaze, and
a bewildered expression comes into his
eyes, too.
EXTERIOR OF PLANE
58. LONG SHOT
Shooting through door. The strange-looking
natives have surrounded the plane and
are closing in.
INTERIOR PLANE
59. MEDIUM SHOT
Conway and George both instinctively
wheel around toward the opposite side.
But from that direction too, a horde
of natives dash toward them. Conway
hesitates a second, and like a flash
springs for the door. But he stops again,
as he opens the door.
EXTERIOR OF PLANE
60. MEDIUM SHOT
To include door of plane. Conway finds
himself staring into the threatening
mouths of half a dozen rifles, and quickly
shuts the door.
GEORGE
What are these people?
CONWAY
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
? 490 ?
EXTERIOR OF PLANE
61. MEDIUM SHOT THROUGH WINDOW
We see the pilot and several natives
in single file as they come toward the
plane, buckets in hand. In b.g., one
of them lowers a bucket into a well
in the ground.
GEORGE
Look - they're loading up with gasoline.
EXTERIOR OF PLANE
62. SEVERAL SHOTS
The gas is being loaded. Natives on
horseback dash back and forth shouting
and signalling. Camels can be glimpsed
among the horses. There is tremendous
disorder and commotion.
63. LONG SHOT
The ship leaves the ground. The natives
stand around, curiously watching.
INTERIOR PLANE
64. MEDIUM SHOT
Conway is pacing. The occupants sit
by their open windows.
CONWAY
Imagine having all that fuel there,
waiting for us!
(he sits down)
George, something tells me our journey
is just beginning.
LOVETT
Where are we going? Huh?
BARNARD
(pointing)
If you ask me, we're heading straight
for those mountains.

They are all silent - waiting prayerfully.
Conway turns to the others - his voice

They obey his command.

EXTERIOR SHOT OF PLANE
87. LONG SHOT
Just as the ship hits the ground for
the first time.
INTERIOR PLANE
88. MED. CLOSE SHOT
The occupants brace themselves for the
jolt. The ship hits and bounces several
times and finally stops. Its nose seems
to bury itself in the ground. The people
are lifted high into the air where they
remain, suspended for a few seconds,
terror-stricken. Then, accompanied by
grinding, crackling sounds, the ship
flops back and falls on its side. For
a moment there is stark silence - while
the people do not stir. A look of relief
spreads over their faces.
CONWAY
Everybody all right?
The passengers offer dazed replies:
"Okay - yeah - I think so." Meanwhile,
Conway has opened the door. A swirling
mass of snow greets them, so that they
have to force their way out.
EXTERIOR OF PLANE
89. MEDIUM SHOT
George and Conway fight their way down
from the plane in the blinding snow.
George quickly runs around to the other
side. Conway crosses to the cockpit,
and clambers aboard.
90. CLOSE SHOT IN THE COCKPIT
Lit only by the dashboard light. Conway
sticks his head in from the outside.
His eyes which have been flashing with
determination suddenly sober. CAMERA
PANS OVER to pilot, who is slumped over,
his chin resting on his chest.
91. MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
George pops into view on the opposite
side, just as Conway has found the pilot's
gun beside him on the seat.
GEORGE
What is it? Has he fainted?
CONWAY
It looks like it.
(sniffing)
Smell those fumes?
Conway hops up beside the pilot. George
follows suit.
CONWAY
(handing gun to George)
Here George, take the gun. Hold the
lights. I'm going to search him before
he comes to.
(while searching)
We might find something interesting.
(finds something)
Hello - what's this? A map!
(hands it to George)
He resumes his search enthusiastically.
Suddenly he stops. The utter limpness
of the pilot's body gives him pause.
He lifts up his chin, stares into his
face - pulls up his eyelid and then
places a hand over his heart. He turns
slowly toward George, who has been watching
his brother intently.
? 496 ?
CONWAY
He's dead.
GEORGE
Dead?
George stares unbelievingly.
CONWAY
It must have happened the moment he
hit the ground.
(a pause)
Let's take a look at this map.
Conway holds the map under the dashboard
light. He studies it painstakingly,
and his tense expression changes to
one of deep concern. George's eyes are
glued on him.
GEORGE
What is it?
CONWAY
See that spot?
GEORGE
Yes.
CONWAY
That's where we were this morning. He
had it marked. Right on the border of
Tibet. Here's where civilization ends.
We must be a thousand miles beyond it
- just a blank on the map.
GEORGE
(afraid to ask)
What's it mean?
CONWAY
It means we're in unexplored country
- country nobody ever reached.
George stares at him, wide-eyed, the
gravity of their situation slowly penetrating
his terrorized mind. Conway's thoughts
are interrupted by a knock on the panel,
and he looks up.
92. MED. CLOSE SHOT THROUGH GLASS PANEL
We see the faces of Barnard and the
others. We hear their voices inquiring
- "Hey, Conway, what's happening?" -
"What's up?" - "Where are we?" - "What'd
you find out?"
93. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY AND GEORGE
Conway turns to George.
CONWAY
George, our chances of getting out of
this are pretty slim. But it's up to
us.

We can't have three hysterical people
on our hands.
He enters the cabin through the cockpit.

122. LONG SHOT
Of the snake-like moving party. They

them.

narrow, treacherous footbridge and makes
a slow, difficult crossing in heavy
weather.
124. MED. SHOT
Of the group. They round a curve and
come upon a narrow crevice which opens
up into a passageway. One by one they
step through, assisted by the natives.
On the other side, they sigh relievedly.
Oddly, the wind has stopped, the chill
has lessened. They look up to inspect
their surroundings and a startled look
comes into their eyes.
124. MED. CLOSE SHOT
Of Conway as he glances casually around.
What he sees leaves him transfixed.
He stares unbelievingly before him for
a long time.
125. LONG SHOT
From angle at mountain top.
A sight that is both magnificent and
incredible. The eye-filling horizon
before them throws out a softness and
a warmth that is breathless. On the
left is a group of colored pavilions
that seem as if suspended on the mountainside.
Down below, in the hazy distance, is
a valley which gives one the impression
of a huge tapestry, superb in its blending
of soft colors. In every direction,

feast of strange and heavenly beauty.

Conway turns from the rare magnificence
of Shangri-La, unhampered by the wind
and storm they had just encountered,

from which they came to assure himself
he is the victim of a nightmare. Chang,
watching him, answers him before he
can express his astonishment.

Thanks.

I suppose all this comes under the heading
of adventure.
CONWAY
We've had plenty of it the last few
days.
? 512 ?
GEORGE
It's far from over, from what I can
see. This place gives me the creeps,
hidden away like this - no contact with
civilization. Bob, you don't seem concerned
at all.
CONWAY
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to
be concerned about anything.
(moodily)
I think I'm going to like it here.
GEORGE
You talk as though you intend on staying.
CONWAY
(turns to him)
Something happened to me, when we arrived
here, George, that - well - did you
ever go to a totally strange place,
and feel certain that you've been there
before?
GEORGE
What are you talking about?
CONWAY
(back to earth)
I don't know.
GEORGE
You're a strange bird. No wonder Gainsford
calls you the man who always wanted
to see what was on the other side of
the hill.
152. TWO SHOT - CONWAY AND GEORGE
Conway's point of view, studying George.
CONWAY
Don't you ever want to see what's on
the other side of the hill?
GEORGE
What could there be except just another
hill? In any event, I'm not curious.
At the moment, it seems to me we should
be concerned about getting home. I'd
give anything to be in London right
now.
CONWAY
Of course you would. If ever we get
out of this place, the thing for you
to do is to take that job with Helen's
father.
GEORGE
What do you mean if we should get out?
CONWAY
(evasively)
Did I say "if"?

GEORGE
(interrupting)
That's what you said.
CONWAY
Well - I mean
GEORGE
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as
though we're going to have trouble getting
out of here.
153. CLOSE TWO SHOT - FAVORING CONWAY
CONWAY
George, I've been putting things together.
Do you notice the resemblance between
those natives and the pilot? And why
did those clothes materialize so conveniently
when they met us at the plane? Chang
himself just said that they never venture
beyond that point. What brought them
there? Unless it was to meet us?
GEORGE
(catching on)
Chang's first question was about the
pilot.
CONWAY
Uh-huh.
GEORGE
There must be some connection between
the plane and this place. They must
have deliberately brought us here. Why,
Bob? What reason could they have for
doing a thing like that?
CONWAY
That's what's on the other side of the
hill.

They stand on a terrace of one of the
tower rooms.
CHANG
It's three thousand feet, practically
straight down to the floor of the valley.
The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call
it. There are over two thousand people

CHANG
Goodness, no!

There are some things, my dear Conway,
I deeply regret I may not discuss.
CONWAY
You know, that's the fourth time you've

stand on end. You see those hills over
there? Gold! Gold! Popping right out
of them! Tons of it!

Now look, you keep this under your hat,

notices how pale and haggard she looks.
BARNARD
Aw say, honey, you aren't feeling well,
are you? Look, don't pay too much attention
to what those doctors tell you. I've
seen an awful lot of people fool them,
and I've got a hunch that this place
is going to be good for you. Honest,
I have.
(waits for her reaction - receives none)
Come on now. Come on. You be a good
kid, and snap out of it, and I'll cut
you in on the gold deal. Look, I'm going
up and make a deal with Chang - right
now.
He enthusiastically exits scene.
180. FULL SHOT
It is a bright, cheery morning. Conway
is drinking in the beauty of his surroundings.
He comes into the area where the horses

the horses.
CONWAY

Good morning!
MEN
Good morning, Mr. Conway!
CONWAY
Oh, you speak English, do you?
MEN
Yes, sir.
ONE OF THE MEN
Would you like to take a ride, Mr. Conway?
CONWAY
No, thanks. Not just now.
Suddenly, Conway is startled by the
sound of hoof-beats and, looking up,
is in time to see 'the girl' of the
previous sequence (Sondra) fly by him
on a horse - screaming delightedly.
As she passes him, she waves.

Well, I think I will take that ride!

Showing Sondra disappearing behind a
mountain waterfall. Conway dashes up,
but she is lost from sight. He wheels
around several times - and unable to
find her, looks puzzled. Finally, giving
up, he starts slowly back. After a few
moments he is startled by her laughter,
and glances around.

189. MEDIUM SHOT - CONWAY
He has caught up to her tethered horse

out where she is.
190. CLOSE SHOT - A SQUIRREL
A squirrel, near to Sondra, chatters
excitedly.
191. CLOSE SHOT - SONDRA
She can apparently understand the squirrel's
warning. She hurries to dive back into
the water and swim to the other side.
She comes up, spots Conway and watches
him from hiding, behind some bushes.
192. MEDIUM SHOT - CONWAY
Conway has discovered her clothing and
is constructing a kind of scarecrow
on a bush out of them. As a crowning
touch, he adds a flower to the effigy,
his eyes twinkling at his little joke.
With one final glance over his shoulder,
he turns to leave.

She stifles her laughter as he vanishes

225. FULL SHOT
Of a pleasant and peaceful place. Conway
is walking along moodily, drinking in
the pastoral beauty.
226. MED. TRUCKING SHOT WITH CONWAY
As he walks along. He comes to a spot
where a man and a woman are tilling
the soil, and stops to watch them. The
man looks up and, seeing Conway, makes
a friendly bow and doffs his hat. Conway
also bows. The woman curtsies prettily
and smiles. Conway doffs his hat in
acknowledgement.
He is in a cheerful frame of mind and
continues his walk - CAMERA CONTINUING
WITH HIM. He greets several other people.
Upon seeing him, they also bow and doff
their hats. Conway does likewise.
227. FULL SHOT
Conway is walking along a street in
the valley. It is a quaint thoroughfare,
unlike anything we have ever seen before.
The small, one-story huts along its
very narrow sidewalk are of singularly
varied architecture - giving the impression
of being "homemade." As a result of
this, no two are alike. Only one characteristic
about them is similar - their cleanliness.
Something about the atmosphere is fresh
and wholesome and peaceful. In front
of several of the huts native women
sit - some weaving on a tapestry board,
some nursing babies, some asleep, and
some just sitting. The keynote is contentment.
228. MED. TRUCKING SHOT
With Conway, walking along. As he passes,
the women smile at him in the most friendly
fashion. From inside these homes, soft
and soothing music emanates. At the
end of the street, Conway finally arrives
at a garden spot. The suddenness of
this is startling, too - because of
its beauty. Sighing contentedly, Conway
throws himself at the foot of an overhanging
tree, and leans against the trunk.
? 535 ?
229. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY
He throws his head back, shuts his eyes
- in a restful and contemplative mood.
He remains this way quietly for a few
seconds, when he is attracted by the
singing of a chorus of children's voices.
He glances around.
230. LONG SHOT
From Conway's angle. In the shadow of
a row of overhanging trees which form
an arch, a group of fifteen or twenty
children sing a hymn, or nursery song
- in English. Sondra (the violin girl
of previous scenes) stands in front
of them, a baton in hand, conducting
them.
231. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY
He smiles at the sight - and springing
to his feet starts in their direction.
232. MED. SHOT
Of Sondra and the children, as Conway
saunters into the scene behind her.
He finds himself a comfortable place
under a tree and sits down. The children,
still singing, have seen his approach
and crane their necks curiously.
233. CLOSE SHOT - SONDRA
She waves her baton and sings with the
children. Then she notices they are
being distracted and casually turns
her head. She is somewhat startled at
seeing Conway, but quickly recovers
her composure, and smiles wanly.
234. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY
He smiles also.
CONWAY
Do you mind?
235. WIDER ANGLE
To include Sondra, Conway and some of
the children. They finish the song,
and Conway applauds. Sondra curtsies
prettily. She turns to the children.
SONDRA
This is Mr. Conway, children.
236. MED. SHOT
In unison the twenty children curtsey.
CHILDREN
(all together - sing-song)
Good morning, Mr. Conway.
CONWAY
How do you do?
CHILDREN
Very well, thank you.
Conway scrambles to his feet and does
an exaggerated bow. Sondra laughs delightedly.
SONDRA
All right, children. We will now sing
She lifts her baton and the thin, piping
voices fill the air.
? 536 ?
237. CLOSEUP - CONWAY
He lights a cigarette and, leaning against
a tree, studies Sondra's face - impressed
by her beauty.
238. CLOSEUP - SONDRA
She slyly glances backward, and a self-conscious
smile covers her face.
239. MED. SHOT
As a child from the ranks breaks and
comes to Sondra, who leans down to listen
to the child - who whispers in her ear.
Sondra, murmuring, "Of course, dear"
and still waving her baton is, for the
moment, uncertain what to do. Then turning
to Conway, holds out the baton to him.
SONDRA
Do you mind?
Conway snaps out of his reverie and
jumps forward.
CONWAY
Not at all.
He takes the baton from her.
SONDRA
Thank you.
And, taking the child by the hand, she
exits.
240. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY
Conducting the chorus in all seriousness
- albeit a trifle awkwardly. He turns
his head to watch Sondra, and when he
looks forward again, finds himself off-beat.
To cover his embarrassment, he smiles
foolishly.
241. MED. SHOT
They come to the end of the song, but
Conway, whose eyes are searching for
Sondra, is oblivious of this and continues
to conduct mechanically. The children
break into laughter.
242. MED. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT
With Sondra as she returns with the
child clinging to her. As she turns
a bend, she looks up, surprised.
243. CLOSE SHOT - SONDRA
As she laughs heartily.
244. CLOSE SHOT - CONWAY
CONWAY
All right, children. Now teacher is
going to be very busy this afternoon,
so school's dismissed!
The children break into squeals and
race off. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as
they cross a footbridge, gleefully doff
their clothes and with yelps and cries
leap into a stream.
245. MED. SHOT - CONWAY AND SONDRA
Favoring Conway.
CONWAY
Oh, please. I hope you're not going
to run away this time.
? 537 ?
SONDRA
(extending her hand)
My name's Sondra.
CONWAY
I hope you'll forgive me for
He hears curious, fluttering music coming
from somewhere.
CONWAY
(looking around)
You know, each time I see you, I hear
that music. What is it?
SONDRA
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
THE CAMERA SHOWS PIGEONS swirling overhead.
Sondra pulls a miniature flute from
one of her pocket.
SONDRA
(showing him)
It's these little flutes that I attached
to their tails. See? Come along with
me, and I'll show you how I put them
on.
They exit scene.
247. MEDIUM TRUCKING SHOT
Sondra and Conway, walking. This spot
is on top of a hill overlooking the
splendor of the valley below.
248. CLOSER TRUCKING SHOT
They walk along silently for a few seconds,
while Conway studies her face speculatively.
CONWAY
There are so many questions I'd like
to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.
? 539 ?
SONDRA
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd
like to know what I'm doing here. Whether
I was born here.
CONWAY
Thank you.
SONDRA
Well, I was almost born here. It took
place in that wild country beyond the
pass. My father and mother were in a
party of explorers who got lost and
wandered around for a year. When Chang
found us, only Father and I were alive.
But he was too weak to climb the pass.
He died on the way. I was brought up
here by Father Perrault himself.
CONWAY
Father Perrault! I envy you. I talked
to him last night.
SONDRA
Yes, I know.
CONWAY
Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite
get used to this age thing.
He steals a sideways glance at her.
She is greatly amused.
SONDRA
(satisfying his obvious curiosity)
I'm thirty.
CONWAY
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
249. MED. SHOT
As they arrive at a scenic overlook.
It is getting toward dusk.
CONWAY
(wonderingly)
It's inconceivable.
SONDRA
What is?
CONWAY
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent
history. This place, hidden away from
the rest of the world, with its glorious
concepts, and now you come along and
confuse me entirely.
SONDRA
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the
light. But why do I confuse you? Am
I so strange?
CONWAY
On the contrary, you're not strange.
And that in itself is confusing. I have
the same idea about Shangri-La. The
sense that I've been here before, that
I belong here.
SONDRA
I'm so glad.
? 540 ?
CONWAY
I can't quite explain it, but everything
is somehow familiar. The very air that
I breathe. The Lamasery, with its feet
rooted in the good earth of this fertile
valley, while its head explores the
eternal. All the beautiful things I
see, these cherry blossoms, you - all
somehow familiar.
(chuckles to himself)
I've been kidnapped and brought here
against my will. A crime, a great crime,
yet I accept it amiably, with the same
warm amiability one tolerates only from
a very dear and close friend. Why? Can
you tell me why?
SONDRA
Perhaps because you've always been a
part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
CONWAY
I wonder.
SONDRA
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's
a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's
heart. I have never seen the outside
world. But I understand there are millions
and millions of people who are supposed
to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know
that secretly they are all hoping to
find a garden spot where there is peace
and security, where there's beauty and
comfort, where they wouldn't have to
be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish
the whole world might come to this valley.
CONWAY
Then it wouldn't be a garden spot for
long.
She laughs as they exit scene.
250. TRUCKING SHOT
Barnard is bringing a reluctant Lovett
along on an excursion into the Valley.
They pass friendly natives and farmers
at work.
LOVETT
I don't know why I associate with you,
Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant
- or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your
name may be.
BARNARD
Just call me Barney.
LOVETT
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have
nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What
effrontery!
BARNARD
Okay, Lovey.
? 541 ?
LOVETT
And this trip to the valley. I can't
imagine why I'd allow you to drag me
down here. Why, we don't know anything
about these people. We're not even armed!
BARNARD
They're very nice people - except that
they've got horns.
LOVETT
(alarmed at first)
Horns?
Barnard points to sheepherders with
their long horns.
BARNARD
(chuckles)
Yeah. You know.
LOVETT
Horns? What kind of horns?
Lovett sees his point, starts to chuckle,
but still looks wary.
BARNARD
Here, here! Come on. They won't hurt
you.
DISSOLVE TO:
251. MEDIUM SHOT
Barnard has encountered some beautiful
native girls, and they have surrounded
him with their hospitality - plying
him with wine and food. Lovett is off
scene.
BARNARD
Okay, honey, all I want is a glass of
wine! Thanks very much.
NATIVE GIRL
Please sit down.
BARNARD
This is fine. This is swell. No, just
a drink. I've been walking and I'm a
little thirsty, you see? That's all
right. I don't just happen to be very
hungry. Say look, all I asked for was
a glass of water. Look here, I've got
to have some help with this.
(looking around anxiously)
Now, Lovey! Where is Lovey?
252. CLOSE SHOT
Of Lovett, lagging behind and missing
out on all the fun.
LOVETT
Mr. Barnard?
253. MEDIUM SHOT
Favoring Barnard as Lovett comes into
view.
BARNARD
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked
for a glass of wine and look what I
got. Come on, sit down.
? 542 ?
LOVETT
So that's where you are. I might of
known it. No wonder you couldn't hear
me.
BARNARD
You were asked to have a glass of wine.
Sit down!
LOVETT
And be poisoned out here in the open?
BARNARD
Certainly not!
NATIVE GIRL
(to Lovett)
For me, won't you please have a glass
of wine?
LOVETT
I never drink wine in the daytime.
BARNARD
(as he is poured a glass anyway)
There you are!
LOVETT
(raising the glass to his lips)
This doesn't obligate me in any way.
NATIVE GIRL
No.
DISSOLVE TO:
254. FULL SHOT
A merry Lovett has had too much to drink.
Now he is entertaining a group of native
children, who are huddled at his feet.
Other natives watch the entertainment.
Bernard, watching from one side, is
losing patience.
LOVETT
then the bears came right into the
bedroom and the little baby bear said,
"Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my
bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh
dear, somebody's been sleeping in my
bed!" And then the big papa bear, he
roared, "And somebody's been sleeping
in my bed!" Well, you have to admit
the poor little bears were in a quandary!
BARNARD
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on,
Lovey!
LOVETT
(continuing)
They were in a quandary, and
BARNARD
Come on, Lovey.
? 543 ?
LOVETT
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's
the matter? Are you going to be a fuss
budget all your life? Here, drink it
up! Aren't you having any fun? Where
was I?
BARNARD
In a quandary.
They all laugh.
LOVETT
I'm telling this story! I'm telling
it.
(continuing)
Yes, the poor little bears didn't know
what to do, you see, because somebody
had been sleeping in their bed.
A CHILD IN THE AUDIENCE
Who slept in their beds?
NATIVE GIRL
(the one who poured him a drink of wine
alluringly)
Who was it, Lovey?
LOVETT
(smitten)
Oh, you call me Lovey, eh?
(to Barnard)
Look at those eyes? There's the devil
in those eyes!
DISSOLVE TO:
256. MED. SHOT (MOVING)
With George as he disconsolately walks.
He is startled by the sound of Maria's
voice calling him. CAMERA PANS with
him as he crosses to a sheltered spot
where Maria sits on a garden bench.
? 544 ?
GEORGE
Hello, Maria.
He fumbles for a cigarette.
257. MED. CLOSE SHOT
MARIA
(a little hurt)
You promised to come for tea yesterday.
I waited for so long.
GEORGE
I'm sorry.
(chagrined to discover he has no cigarettes
left)
I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
MARIA
I'll make some for you!
(pleading)
You will come today?
GEORGE
(after a pause)
Perhaps.
MARIA
(tenderly)
Please say you will. The days are so
very long and lonely without you.
(a whisper)
Please . . .
GEORGE
All right, I'll be there.
MARIA
(happily)
Thank you.
GEORGE
(suddenly)
You'll tell me some of the things I
want to know, won't you? You'll tell
me who runs this place. And why we were
kidnapped. And what they're going to
do with us!
258. CLOSEUP - MARIA
From the moment he starts to speak,
her face clouds. George's voice continues
without interruption.
GEORGE'S VOICE
Chang's been lying about those porters,
hasn't he?
She runs off, frightened.
294. MED. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT
Conway, George and Maria on their way
out of the main building. The funeral
procession continues around them. The
two men walk together, Maria behind.
George is cheerful and buoyant.
GEORGE
It won't be long now before we're in
London. Can't you just see everyone
when we pop out of the blue!
Conway's jaw is set grimly.
295. MED. SHOT
As Conway, George and Maria continue.
GEORGE
We'll have them breathless when they
hear our story.
While he speaks, Conway turns his head
around, looking for a glimpse of Sondra.

As he hurries out of the building and
looks out at them from a roof terrace.
297. CLOSE SHOT - MOVING WITH CONWAY
As he continues to look back in Sondra's

with George.
GEORGE'S VOICE
You had me worried for a while. I thought
you were gone completely.
Conway turns his head away.
298. THREE SHOT (MOVING)
Conway, George and Maria. George glances
up at Conway.
? 565 ?
GEORGE
(sincerely - grinning)
Lucky thing for me you snapped out of
it, too. You saved my life. I never
could have made it alone.
CONWAY
What was that?
GEORGE
I was saying
CONWAY
Can't you shut up? Must you go on babbling
like an idiot?
George looks up, startled.
299. LONG SHOT
Sondra has come running out to stand
anxiously beside Chang.
300. MED. CLOSE SHOT
Sondra and Chang.
SONDRA
What's happened? Where's Bob?
CHANG
He's going, my child.
SONDRA
Going?
CHANG
But he will return.
SONDRA
Oh no! No! Bob!
Shouting, she rushes off and the CAMERA
FOLLOWS HER as she races down a long
flight of stairs, calling out Conway's
name.
301. TRUCKING CLOSEUP - SONDRA
As she runs, calling out Conway's name
and weeping.

by a dozen or more porters - as they
approach the mountain opening where
they first entered Shangri-La.
303. CLOSEUP - CONWAY
He hesitates at the opening, looks back
one more time. His eyes show confusion
and defeat. George, ahead, calls out
to him to hurry.
304. TRUCKING MEDIUM SHOT - SONDRA
As she stumbles up the trail to the
opening, minutes behind. The wind howls
on the other side. She cries and weeps,
calling out Conway's name, but he can
no longer be seen.

DISSOLVE TO:
305. A SERIES OF SHOTS
Which should be a group of portraits
- showing the group's seemingly impossible
journey back to civilization. These
pictures should be accompanied by music
in the appropriate mood.
306. NIGHT SHOT
Accompanied by the porters, they trudge
laboriously through snow-ridden plains.
DISSOLVE TO:
307. DAY
The whole caravan are seen in the distance,
clambering up a mountain-side - hoisted
by ropes.
DISSOLVE TO:
308. NIGHT
In the middle of a vast plain. They
attempt to put up tents, which proves
futile, as a raging snowstorm rips the
canvas from its moorings.
DISSOLVE TO:
309. DAY
The large group are seen lowering themselves
in single file down a ledge alongside
a ravine. The wind howls.
DISSOLVE TO:
310. DAY
A mountain pass somewhere with a hailstorm
swiping viciously across their faces.
They edge their way pre-cautiously across
a narrow ledge. Suddenly the girl loses
her bearings - slips - screams - and
is caught by Conway just in time to
save her from falling down the side
of the jagged mountain.
DISSOLVE TO:
311. MED. SHOT - NIGHT
Maria has one arm around George and
the other around Conway - limping. She
has her head down. They trudge silently.
The porters are off in the distance,
leaving them behind.
MARIA
(collapsing)
I can't stand it. I can't go on anymore!
I've got to rest.
She stumbles and they help her up. George
looks off toward the porters helplessly.
MARIA
(hysterical)
How long is this going to go on? I can't
stand it, I say.
312. MED. SHOT
Of the porters, laughing at their distress.
? 567 ?
313. MED. SHOT - THE THREE
GEORGE
Bob, can't you get them to wait for
us? They're leaving us farther behind
every day.
CONWAY
There's nothing that would suit them
better than to lose us, but we must
go on.
(to Maria - gently)
Come on.
MARIA
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to
let me rest! You've got to let me rest!
CONWAY
(calling out to the porters)
Hey!
314. MED. SHOT
Of the porters, still laughing. The
lead porter whips out a gun and fires
at them for sport.
315. MED. SHOT - THE THREE
They are in no danger. The porters are
too far off.
GEORGE
(contemptuously)
Target practice again! One of these
days they're going to hit us.
CONWAY
(wryly)
As long as they keep on aiming at us,
we're safe.
(to Maria)
Come now, child.
They start to move again.
316. MED. SHOT
Of the porters. They are still laughing,
and now others have drawn out their
guns. Firing off wildly, they trigger
an ominous thunder overhead.
317. MED. SHOT - THE THREE
Looking up, they see an avalanche beginning.
318. A SERIES OF SHOTS
Of the avalanche, picking up strength
and fury as it crashes downhill, sweeping
over the porters and crushing them to
death.

An immense silence comes over them.
Conway and George can only stare, dazed
and frightened. The only sound is Maria,
sobbing.

girl on his back. George walks behind.
The wind continues to howl.

321. CLOSEUP - GEORGE
Staring at the girl's face as it hangs
over Conway's back. Suddenly, his eyes
widen.
322. CLOSEUP - MARIA
A distorted view of her. Youth and beauty
seem to be vanishing.
323. CLOSEUP - GEORGE
His eyes are glued on her.
GEORGE
(a frightened whisper)
Bob! Bob! Look at her face, Bob! Her
face! Look at her face!
DISSOLVE TO:

On the backs of the two men, who bend
over Maria. CAMERA DRAWS BACK as they
straighten up. Both stare down aghast
at the girl, whom we do not see.
325. ANOTHER ANGLE
To include the girl.
326. MED. SHOT OF THE THREE
The only illumination comes from the
moon. We cannot get a clear view of
her face. But what we see seems to us
to be small, withered and aged. She
is dead. The men stare at her intently.
327. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO MEN
Who watch her, immobile. George looks
despairing. Slowly his head turns toward
the cliff behind him - and his eyes
become alert with an idea. His face
lights up with great determination.
He lets out a piteous howl, and breaks
away, racing out of scene.
Conway turns sharply and is horrified.
CONWAY
George! George!
328. A SERIES OF SHOTS
George stumbling toward the cliff, Conway
chasing him. George, falling head over
heels, rocking on the edge - then plummeting
over, falling down, down into the darkness.

Conway, at the end of the cliff, peering
starkly downward.

330. A SERIES OF SHOTS
As Conway soldiers on, alone, through
howling wind and snow.
DISSOLVE TO:
331. MED. SHOT - NIGHT
On Conway, struggling against a cyclonic
wind. He tops a rise, stumbles, falls
over, and rolls down the mountainside,
until finally he comes to a stop, mounded
by snow. Slowly, he begins to rise and
start again.
? 569 ?
DISSOLVE TO:
332. DAWN
As the sun comes up, Conway emerges
from the whiteness, feeling his way
forward with a walking stick. He walks
with the pain and effort of a blind
man, and just as he manages to cross
a bridge spanning a great chasm, the
bridge collapses. He stumbles on.
DISSOLVE TO:
333. DAY
Conway, looking haggard and more dead
than alive, stumbles out onto more dry
and level terrain. He collapses to the

353. LONG SHOT
Over his silhouetted back.
As he walks away from the CAMERA, and
we STAY WITH HIM a long time as he approaches
a hill.
DISSOLVE TO:
354. ANOTHER LONG SHOT
He has now ascended to the middle of
the steep hill - his gait unchanged.
THE CAMERA PANS UP to the summit of
the incline - and we see that beyond
it the horizon is filled with a strange
warm light. Conway's figure - in silhouette
- disappears over the hill - bells ring
- and as the music begins to swell[16]
FADE OUT.
