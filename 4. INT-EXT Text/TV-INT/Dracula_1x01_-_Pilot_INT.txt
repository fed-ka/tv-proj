      --that hasn t been violated for centuries except by natural 
      elements like insects and rats. Tangles of roots creep across 
      crumbling MURALS OF GREAT BATTLES and -- CLOSE on the faded 
      painted images -- Turkish soldiers IMPALED upon tall spikes. 

      And at the far end of the crypt, atop a stone dais, is an 
      enormous iron-reinforced marble SARCOPHAGUS. 

      The German s eyes glow with a treasure hunter s excitement.

                                  GERMAN MAN
                    This is it.

      Shadow-man holds up a hand: quiet. He s more cautious.

      They slowly approach the sarcophagus. Their lamp reveals that 
      it s covered by a MARBLE EFFIGY of a man in armor, limbs 
      TWISTED IN ANGUISH, CLAWED HANDS grasping at life. Further, 
      the effigy s face is frozen in a scream, its open mouth 
      containing FOUR FANGS.

                                  GERMAN MAN (CONT D)
                    Brother?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      2.

      CONTINUED:

      Shadow-man looks at the German, his eyes full of relief.

                                  SHADOW-MAN
                    Finally, after all these years of 
                      searching...

      The German whoops and throws his arms around Shadow-man, who 
      drops his carpetbag at the embrace. 

                                  GERMAN MAN
                    Should we open it now, or wait 
                    until morning?

      CLOSE on Shadow-man s eyes, something not like joy in them.

                                  SHADOW-MAN
                    Now.

      We hear the sound of a knife piercing flesh. The German, 
      still hugging him, stiffens.

                                  GERMAN MAN
                    Brother?

                                  SHADOW-MAN
                          (whispers)
                    Did you truly believe I knew not 
                    what you did?

      The German begins shaking his head in terror.

                                  GERMAN MAN
                    No, no, they weren t supposed to be 
                    there. I didn t kno--

      Shadow-man pulls a CURVED DAGGER from the German s gut. The 
      German collapses to his knees, hunched forward -- tears and 
      drool dripping from his face.

                                  GERMAN MAN (CONT D)
                    But you and I...we re family.

      Shadow-man holds up the lamp, its warm light casting his 
      masked face in dark, ominous shadows.

                                  SHADOW-MAN
                    Do not speak to me of family. I 
                    have none left.

      He turns to the sarcophagal effigy and whispers into its ear--





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      3.

                                  SHADOW-MAN (CONT D)
                    For nearly two centuries you have 
                    slept. How hungry you must be.

      He grabs the German by the hair then and, hauling him back to 
      his feet, throws him against the sarcophagus.

                                  GERMAN MAN
                          (bawling)
                    Forgive me. Forgive me, Broth--

      Shadow-man draws his dagger across the German s throat. The 
      German begins to gurgle.

                                  SHADOW-MAN
                          (as if intoning a spell)
                    The blood is the life.

      He guides the German s neck toward the effigy s fanged face--

      INSIDE THE EFFIGY S MOUTH: DARK BLOOD drips onto the fangs 
      and OOZES TOWARD US.

      INSIDE THE SARCOPHAGUS: We find the desiccated remains of a 
      human. At least a dozen IRON STAKES impale the corpse from 
      all directions, including one that sticks INTO HIS CHEST. 

      As drops of blood land on what remains of its lips--

      The stakes instantly retract.

      Almost as quickly, the body s leathery skin grows flush and 
      supple; RED EYES fill empty sockets; a nose regrows. In other 
      words, in less than three seconds, life or something like it 
      returns to the one and only COUNT DRACULA (late-30s).

      His still-grey, reanimating face lunges at the OVERHEAD 
      CAMERA as red eyes and a fang-filled mouth cry out in shock--

                                        END OF TEASER














                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      4.

      IRIS OUT ON:

      A dance floor filled with beautiful people in magnificent 
      fashions all waltzing to up-tempo music played by a 12-PIECE 
      ORCHESTRA. The  iris,  an antiquated silent-film camera 
      trick, is juxtaposed with a modern STEADI-CAM SHOT that will 
      continue unbroken until otherwise noted. We re inside--


      LUCY WESTERNA (early-20s; red hair; manufactured beauty) 
      sweeps by with her DANCE PARTNER. She screams wealth and 
      frivolity in her busty gown; a sexual creature oblivious to 
      how others think of her, she s the Kim Kardashian of her day. 

      TITLE CARD:  LONDON, 1896 

      We follow her around the dance floor, past the orchestra, 
      past PHOTOGRAPHERS with KODAK CAMERAS, past platforms where 
      CAMERAMEN crank away at Lumiere Domitor MOVIE CAMERAS. It s 
      the party of the year, we quickly realize. But when the song 
      finally ends, she pulls away from her partner.

                                  LUCY S DANCE PARTNER
                    Just one more dance, Lucy!

                                  LUCY
                    Send more than chocolates to 
                    impress me and you ll get more than 
                    one dance, Revere! 

      As another song begins, Lucy carries us to the CONFECTIONS 
      TABLE. Here waits her best friend MINA MURRAY (early-20s; 
      brunette; girl-next-door beautiful) and Mina s beau JONATHAN 
      HARKER (early-30s; neatly parted hair). The astute eye will 
      notice Harker s tux is the only used one at the party and 
      Mina s dress, while beautiful, doesn t match modern trends. 

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    And why aren t you dancing with 
                    Mina, Jonathan?

      Harker indicates Mina with his plate of sweets, as if to say 
       What do you want me to do?  Mina is mesmerized by the modern 
      upgrades of the house around her.

                                  MINA
                    Look, even the chandeliers are 
                    wired for electricity!

      She points at chandeliers glowing with electrical light.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      5.

      CONTINUED:

                                  LUCY
                      How...exciting.

      It s not for her, that s clear. Harker, more than familiar 
      with Mina s love of such science, gives her arm a loving, 
      reassuring squeeze: don t worry about her. Asks Lucy--

                                  HARKER
                    Have you already tired of Mr. 
                    Revere?

                                  LUCY
                    Oh, he s hardly worth the effort. 
                    His father s quite bankrupt, you 
                    know. 

                                  MINA
                    However do you know these things?

                                  LUCY
                    I make a point of knowing them.

      She begins to point out guests for her friends.

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    He s shagging his maid. He s 
                    shagging his butler. Who isn t she 
                    shagging? 

      She then indicates WENDY MUNRO (26; frumpy and doughy) 
      arguing, teary-eyed, with her HANDSOME DATE (40s).

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    That s Wendy Munro, the Earl of 
                    Derby s oldest daughter and that 
                      delicious-looking man is her 
                    fiance. One look at her and you can 
                    guess what he s truly after.

      The frumpy girl, in tears, defiantly storms out past 
        androgynous-looking twins SIMON and SAIORSE (23; white-gold 
      hair). Simon and Saiorse follow her with their ice-blue eyes.

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                          (shudders)
                    The Snodswick Twins. The less you 
                    know about them the better.

      She spins suddenly, thrusting a finger into Harker s chest.

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    And don t you dare put a word of 
                    this in print, Jonathan Harker.

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    Last time I took you out with me, 
                    half of what I said appeared in 
                    that filthy rag of yours.

                                  HARKER
                          (his mouth full)
                    We re a legitimate newspaper.

      Mina laughs at his mumbled words.

                                  HARKER (CONT D)
                    And what about our mysterious host? 
                    What do you know about him?

                                  LUCY
                    Allan Grayson? Only that he s an 
                    American industrialist of some 
                    variety. The nouveau-very-wealthy 
                    variety.

      Suddenly, she grabs Mina s wrist and smiles girlishly--

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    Come, Mina. Let s go see if we can 
                    find him!

      Lucy leads Mina and Harker follows past R.M. RENFIELD (late-
      30s; glasses; nebbish) -- Carfax Abbey s household manager -- 
      who s trying not to appear frustrated by an overweight, 
      blustery guest named LORD TUMBLEDON (40s).

                                  LORD TUMBLEDON
                    How can you serve wine like this?! 
                    It tastes like vinegar. Here, try 
                    it yourself.

      He thrusts his glass of wine at Renfield, spilling some of 
      it. Renfield waves away the glass.

                                  RENFIELD
                    That won t be necessary. Give me a 
                    moment and I ll show you down to 
                    the wine cellar myself. We ll find 
                    something more appropriate.

      He walks away, past Mina who smiles politely at him as she 
      follows Harker and Lucy into--


      The walls are covered in very modern IMPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS 
      by Monet, Renoir, and more. Lucy, endlessly vain, looks at 
      Mina as she fixes her hair and adjusts her bosom in her gown.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      7.

      CONTINUED:

                                  LUCY
                    How do I look?

                                  MINA
                    Lovely, as always.

      Lucy smiles widely: of course she does!

                                  LUCY
                    Do you think this Grayson could be 
                    hideously deformed? I haven t seen 
                    a mirror all night. 

      As she moves off again, Harker gives Mina a  shoot me  look. 

      Simon and Saiorse pass behind them, on either side of a 
      comically bawling Wendy Munro. Simon s hand is on Wendy s 
      back as Saiorse absently twirls a lock of Wendy s hair.

                                  SIMON
                    My name s Simon and this here is my 
                    sister Saiorse. Say hello, Saiorse.

                                    SAIORSE
                    Hello, Wendy. There s no reason to 
                    weep. All lovers have fights. 

                                  LUCY
                    This way, Mina!

      Mina follows Lucy through a door. Harker starts to follow 
      when a hand touches his shoulder. It belongs to a GENTLEMAN.

                                  GENTLEMAN
                    Pardon me, but are you Jonathan 
                    Harker? From the Inquisitor?

      Harker nods apprehensively, sensing what s about to happen.

                                  GENTLEMAN (CONT D)
                    How dare you write such filth about 
                    my son.

                                  HARKER
                    How dare your son indulge in such 
                    filth.

      The gentleman begins to fling his glass s contents at Harker, 
      but Harker grabs his wrist. Glares into the gentleman s eyes.

                                  HARKER (CONT D)
                    You re the first person to try and 
                    throw a drink in my face.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      8.

      CONTINUED:

      The gentleman withers under Harker s glare and backs away. 
      Harker lets go and follows after Mina and Lucy into--


      The only light here comes from a LUMIERE BROTHERS SILENT FILM 
      being projected onto a screen for the awed guests like Mina. 
      SIR CLIVE (60s) and the barons LORD DAVENPORT (late-40s) and 
      LORD LAURENT (mid-50s) are among these men and women.

                                  LORD DAVENPORT 
                    Motion pictures, what nonsense! If 
                    I wanted to see life in action, I d 
                    take a stroll through Hyde Park.

                                  SIR CLIVE
                    Oh, not Hyde Park. All those 
                    students protesting the Ottoman 
                      situation. You d be mauled.

                    You look dashing as always, Sir 
                    Clive.

      She says this sweetly, not flirtatiously. He almost blushes.

                                  SIR CLIVE
                    You tease an old man, my dear.

      As Lucy moves off, boundless energy driving her forward--

                                  LUCY
                    Have you met our host yet?

                                  SIR CLIVE
                    Nobody has!

      Mina stutter-steps, to enjoy the remarkable technology just a 
      moment longer, before Harker hurries her after Lucy into--


      Grand staircases sweep down both sides of the room; between 
      them, glass doors to a terrace. Another ORCHESTRA plays while 
      PHOTOGRAPHERS and CAMERAMEN wield Kodak and movie cameras.

      Lucy immediately lights up at the sight of another YOUNG 
      SOCIALITE in a garish gown. Hugs her, kisses her cheek.

                                  YOUNG SOCIALITE
                    Lucy! 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                      9.

      CONTINUED:

                                  LUCY
                      Genevieve! Wherever did you find 
                    that dress? I just must have one!

      The socialite moves away. Lucy turns to Mina and mutters--

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    Did you see that? Ghastly. I don t 
                    know how she had the nerve to leave 
                    her house.

      Mina laughs politely. Harker s laugh is far more forced. As 
      Lucy moves forward again, he whispers to Mina--

                                  HARKER
                    I wonder what she thinks of your 
                    dress.

                                  MINA
                    Hush, Jonatha-- 

      Harker suddenly grabs her arm.

                                  HARKER
                    Look, Mina! The Prime Minister.

      PRIME MINISTER ROBERT CECIL (66; beard) enters with others. 
      Harker is disgusted at the sight.

                                  HARKER (CONT D)
                    The country s crumbling around us 
                    while those loons in Parliament 
                    clamor for war in the Near East, 
                    and he s here having a jolly good 
                    time. If the people only knew--

                                  MINA
                    Don t you ever stop working, 
                    darling?

      He relaxes. Smiles lovingly back at her, knowing she s right.

                                  HARKER
                    So is this something the wealthy 
                    do? Skip their own parties? 

      Outside, the sun drops below the treeline and dusk is 
      replaced by NIGHT. As if on cue, the orchestra goes silent.

                                  HARKER (CONT D)
                    Speak of the devil.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    10.

      CONTINUED:

      At that, our STEADI-CAM SHOT FINALLY BREAKS and we CUT TO THE 
      TOP OF ONE OF THE STAIRCASES where--

      ALLAN GRAYSON (late-30s; intense eyes; dark hair combed back 
      with pomade) -- THE SAME MAN RESURRECTED IN THE TEASER -- 
      appears over his guests. He wears a dark coat trimmed with 
      violet satin, pinstripe pants, and a pink tie and carnation; 
      eccentric yes, but he knows how to pull it off.

      Mina s eyes open wider and wider still as if in recognition.

      Grayson sweeps out an arm and, with movie-star charisma and 
      an AMERICAN ACCENT, announces--

                                    GRAYSON
                    Welcome to my house! Come freely, 
                    go safely, and leave something of 
                    the happiness you bring.

      TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN (in fantastic dresses that look as if 
      they were hand-painted in the impressionism style by Edgar 
      Degas) hook their arms through Grayson s and, together, they 
      start down the stairs. 

      As guests, including Harker and Lucy, applaud, Mina watches 
      Grayson, confused by some strange sensation.

      Lord Laurent mutters to the Prime Minister--

                                  LORD LAURENT
                    The circus has arrived in London.

      At the ground floor, Grayson is greeted by Sir Clive, Lord 
      Davenport, and 1896 s equivalent of Daphne Guinness -- LADY 
      JAYNE (40; lithe and beautiful; a shock of white in her raven 
      tresses). She understood  fashion forward  a century before 
      the rest of us. 

                                    GRAYSON
                    Lord Davenport, Sir Clive, I m so 
                    glad you both could make it. 
                          (to his beautiful escorts)
                    You two minxes run along. I ll find 
                    you later. 
                          (to Davenport and Clive)
                    I have something very special to 
                    show you tonight and can t wait to 
                    see your reaction.

                                  LORD DAVENPORT
                          (smug sarcasm)
                    It s all we ve been able to think 
                    about.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    11.

      CONTINUED:

                                    GRAYSON
                    Mm, I expect that s true.

                                  LADY JAYNE
                    Some of us more so than others.

      She says this with both grace and forthright sexuality.

                                  SIR CLIVE 
                    Lady Jayne Wetherby, Mr. Allan 
                    Grayson.

      CLOSE on Grayson s hand as it wraps sensually around hers.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Lord Wetherby isn t with us this 
                    evening?

                                  LADY JAYNE
                    Oh, I wouldn t worry about him.

      Grayson smiles roguishly and kisses the back of her hand 
        now....then, spinning dramatically, raises both arms--

                                    GRAYSON
                    My friends, my friends!

      The crowd slowly hushes. Mina shakes off her odd feeling, her 
      focus sharpening as she takes Harker s hand.

      Grayson moves through the guests as he speaks, smiling at 
      many, shaking the occasional hand. Flirting with the ladies, 
      especially like Lady Jayne.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    When I was a child, my father would 
                    tell me stories about the Dark 
                    Ages. About a time when learning 
                    and culture were eclipsed by 
                    barbaric ritual and war. About a 
                    time when Europe forgot what it 
                    once was and drifted perilously 
                    close to oblivion. Over the years, 
                    I've come to believe the Dark Ages 
                    never actually ended. In fact, the 
                    ignorance and fear that drove them 
                    has spread across the whole globe. 
                    It's infected all of humanity.

      He reaches Lucy and LOCKS EYES WITH HER. His voice falters--





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    12.

      CONTINUED:

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Tonight, I...I suggest there's a 
                    way out...out of the darkness. 

      So transfixed is he, in fact, that, as Lucy smiles back at 
      him, drowning in his eyes, TIME BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN...

      We now realize the person Grayson is actually looking at is 
      MINA, just beyond Lucy who appears almost frozen like 
      everyone else. Mina doesn t understand the strange, 
        disorienting feeling that s also come over her. 

      And then TIME RETURNS TO NORMAL--

                                  PRIME MINISTER ROBERT CECIL
                    Those are all fine words, Mr. 
                    Grayson. But how do you intend to 
                      accomplish this herculean feat?

      Grayson, recovering gracefully, turns away from Lucy/Mina -- 
      neither Harker nor Lucy having noticed the moment that just 
      passed -- and heartily shakes the Prime Minister s hand.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Not in Parliament, Mr. Prime 
                    Minister. I d be stuck in committee 
                    for years!

      The crowd laughs. The Prime Minister nods: touche.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    If you'd all follow me outside.

      SERVANTS open the terrace doors for him while others begin to 
      hand out LIGHT BULBS to confused guests.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Grayson emerges from narrow stairs in the dark wine cellar. 
      Here, Renfield, scribbling in a note pad -- he ll habitually 
      do this -- watches Lord Tumbledon peruse racks of wine with 
      unbridled enthusiasm. 

                                  RENFIELD
                    This is the man I spoke of, sir.

      He exchanges a knowing look with Grayson, then starts up the 
      narrow stairs. Tumbledon spins with a bottle in his hand.

                                  LORD TUMBLEDON
                    Do you know how rare this  46 
                    Meursault Charmes is, old man? It 
                    would taste a lot better than that 
                    slop you re serving upstairs.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Your Lordship, your manners really 
                    are atrocious.

      ANGLE FROM BEHIND GRAYSON as he growls. Tumbledon, able to 
      see Grayson s face where we cannot, drops the bottle in his 
      hands -- it shatters -- and begins to scream--

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CLOSE on a wine glass filled with syrupy, crimson liquid. 

      Grayson, grinning mischievously, sips Lord Tumbledon s BLOOD 
      as he moves through guests, shaking hands and sharing smiles. 


      Grayson enters. Here, Sir Clive and Lords Davenport and 
      Laurent stand together. Snifters, cigars, or pipes in hand.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    16.

      CONTINUED:

                                  SIR CLIVE
                    An impressive demonstration 
                    tonight, Mr. Grayson. 

                                    GRAYSON
                    Thank you, Your Lordship. Speaking 
                    of which, I ve learned your Pandora 
                      Industries owns several patents 
                    that would greatly accelerate the 
                      wide-scale application of my 
                    wireless electricity project -- 
                    including one for the Dreyer 
                      electrical insulator. I wonder why 
                    the company s board isn t making 
                    better use of these.

                                  SIR CLIVE
                    The answer is simple. They belong 
                    to us. To do with as we wish.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Then how much?

                                  LORD LAURENT
                    How much what?

                                    GRAYSON
                    How much for Pandora Industries?

                                  LORD DAVENPORT
                    Offer all you like. I m confident 
                    none of the majority shareholders 
                    will do business with you.

      Grayson sips his  red wine .

                                    GRAYSON
                    I really do hope that doesn t turn 
                    out to be the case.

      His head turns slightly then, sensing something. Behind him, 
      Mina, Harker, and Lucy pass in the--


      Mina looks apologetically at Lucy. Harker at her side.

                                  MINA
                    Are you sure you don t mind?

                                  LUCY
                    You don t feel well. Of course we 
                    can go. Besides...



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    17.

      CONTINUED:

      They enter--


      The room is no less lively than the last time we saw it.

                                  LUCY
                    ...this party is dead anyway.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      From across the busy foyer, Grayson watches Mina, Harker, and 
      Lucy wait for coats and wraps. Renfield joins Grayson.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Who is that woman, Renfield?

                                  RENFIELD
                    I ll find out. The man with her, he 
                    works at the Daily Inquisitor.

                                    GRAYSON
                      A journalist? 

                                  RENFIELD
                      Scandalmonger.

                                    GRAYSON
                          (thinks a beat)
                    Offer him an interview. 

                                  RENFIELD
                      I wouldn t think that wise, sir--

                                    GRAYSON
                          (snaps in a whisper)
                    Just do it!

      Renfield nods. Departs, scribbling in his note pad. 

      Grayson watches as Harker slips Mina s shawl around her 
      shoulders and Lucy accepts her wrap from a FOOTMAN.

                                  LADY JAYNE (O.S.)
                    Which one?

      Grayson looks sideways. Is surprised to find that Lady Jayne 
      is now standing at his side, watching Mina and Lucy as well.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    18.

      CONTINUED:

      Mina glances in Grayson s direction now, not having realized 
      he was standing there. The sight of him unsettles her for 
      some inexplicable reason and she turns back to Harker.

                                  LADY JAYNE (CONT D)
                          (slowly smiles)
                    Ahhh, I see. 

      Mina, Harker, and Lucy exit then. Grayson, instantly 
      reverting to his suave persona, turns to Lady Jayne.

                                    GRAYSON
                    May I offer you a tour of my 
                    mansion?

                                  LADY JAYNE
                          (beat, laughs)
                    Does that sort of line actually 
                    work on American women?

                                    GRAYSON
                    Much more than you d ever imagine.

                                  LADY JAYNE
                    And you Americans wonder why we 
                    can t take you seriously.
                          (leans close, whispers)
                    Besides, my mansion is twice as 
                    large as yours.

      She turns and walks back into the party, giving him a casual, 
        over-the-shoulder wave without looking back.

                                  LADY JAYNE (CONT D)
                    I ll give you a tour sometime.

      Grayson sips blood as he watches her go, intrigued. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Lucy s dress drops to the ground as she prepares for bed.

                                  LUCY
                    You re an angel, Mina. I couldn t 
                    have borne going all the way back 
                    across town tonight.

      Mina speaks from behind a wardrobe screen. Her room is medium-
      sized and warmly decorated; the Murrays are educated, but 
      firmly ensconced in the middle class.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    19.

      CONTINUED:

                                  MINA
                    Lucy, may I ask you a question?

                                  LUCY
                    Oh dear, that sounds grim.

      She slips on one of Mina s sleeping gowns. One, we guess, 
      much less extravagant than what she s used to wearing.

                                  MINA
                    Do you...do you think Jonathan s 
                      affections have waned? Why hasn t 
                    he asked me to marry him yet?

      Lucy drops onto the bed, lies down on her back.

                                  LUCY
                    You should be glad he hasn t. 

                                  MINA
                    Lucy!

                                  LUCY
                    He s just so...safe. Don t you want  
                    passion in your life?

                                  MINA
                          (defensively)
                    We have passion!

      Lucy doesn t reply immediately. She s watching Mina, still 
      behind the screen, slip a nightgown over her half-naked body. 
      A smile tugs at Lucy s lips before she tears her eyes away.

                                  LUCY
                    You haven t even slept with him, 
                    Mina. What if he s a complete lump? 

      Mina emerges from behind the screen, laughing.

                                  MINA
                    If my father overheard you speaking 
                    like that... You re incorrigible! 

                                  LUCY
                    No, I m realistic. What you need is 
                    someone full of life and 
                      excitement. 
                          (dreamily)
                    Like Allan Grayson. 





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    20.

                    You ve never understood Jonathan. 
                    He is...he s my everything. He 
                    gives me the strength to be who I 
                    am, to chase dreams others would 
                    have asked me to forget. How many 
                    men would encourage a woman to 
                    pursue a degree? Cynthia Taylor--

                                  LUCY
                    The one with that unfortunate eye?

      She blinks an eye in a  twitchy  manner. Mina chuckles.

                                  MINA
                    Yes, her! She asked her husband if 
                    she could take classes at the 
                      university, and do you know what he 
                    said?  If you have so much free 
                    time, join another bridge club.  

      Lucy doesn t seem to be paying attention, thoughts elsewhere.

                                  MINA (CONT D)
                    What?

                                  LUCY
                    I was thinking about Grayson again.

      Mina sighs. But after a moment, her thoughts drift back to 
      Grayson -- and that strange feeling she had -- as well.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      En route to his home, Sir Clive tries not to nod off to 
      sleep. An ANIMAL HOWL outside snaps him fully awake.

                                                                          BACK TO:


      Mina turns and Lucy sits up suddenly, to look at the open 
      window. They ve heard the howl, too. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    21.

      CONTINUED:

                                  LUCY
                    What was that?

      Crows and then owls join the cacophonous orchestra as Mina 
      and Lucy move toward the window now, disquieted. Outside, a 
      long, DARK CLOUD seems to be undulating across the full moon.

                                  MINA
                    Are those...?

                                                                          BACK TO:


      CLOSE on a sheet of paper in a tray of chemicals -- lit by 
      red light -- as an image slowly begins to materialize. 

      Grayson removes the photo and hangs it on a line next to a 
      DOZEN OTHER PHOTOS TAKEN AT HIS PARTY -- including the Prime 
      Minister, Lords Davenport and Laurent, and Harker.

                                    GRAYSON
                    It was the right decision, 
                    Renfield. I must have that 
                      electrical insulator patent.

      He s sensed Renfield in the doorway behind him. 

                                  RENFIELD
                    If you say so, sir. Though I doubt 
                    Sir Clive's associates will prove 
                    anymore cooperative than he was.

      Grayson removes another sheet of paper from the chemicals, 
      hangs it on the line, and waits. 

                                    GRAYSON
                    Of course not. If I'm right, if my 
                    generator works on a grand scale, 
                    then all their plans for the future 
                    will collapse like a house of 
                    cards.

                    They've gambled everything on coal 
                    and petroleum being the primary 
                    energy sources of the 20th Century 
                    and, for the first time, they're 
                    realizing they could lose because 
                    of that.

                                  RENFIELD
                    Still, they won t surrender Pandora 
                    or its patents simply because 
                    you ve killed one of them. These 
                    men deal in death. It s commonplace 
                    to them.

                                  RENFIELD
                    And the Doctor? Does he approve?

                                    GRAYSON
                    Leave him to me.

      Grayson watches a figure finally appear on the hanging paper -
      - MINA. His eyes lock on her, spellbound.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Did you learn her name?

      Renfield appears hesitant.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    I know what I m doing, Renfield.

      Renfield looks at Mina s image, skeptical of Grayson s words.

                                  RENFIELD
                    Mina. Her name is Mina, sir.

      Grayson s eyes twinkle, still locked on MINA S IMAGE.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      MINA in CLOSE-UP. She listens intently as Van Helsing, at the 
      front of the 180-degree teaching theater, is asked a question 
      by one of his many MALE STUDENTS. Mina, the only female in 
      the class, sits alone and away from the others.





                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    26.

                                    STUDENT
                    Do you think such a thing could be 
                    possible, Professor Van Helsing? 

                                  VAN HELSING
                    It is an extraordinary claim this 
                    Mr. Grayson makes, I agree. 

      On his lectern is a newspaper, open to a photo of Grayson 
      holding his glowing light bulb. Students like BRUCE CAMPBELL 
      (20) and his equally privileged CRONIES have the same paper.

                                  BRUCE CAMBELL
                    It must be some sort of illusion.

                                  VAN HELSING
                    I would not be so certain. Physics 
                    is not my area of expertise, 
                      but...there are things done today 
                    in electrical science that would 
                    have been deemed unholy by the very 
                    men who discovered electricity -- 
                    who would themselves not so long 
                    before have been burned as wizards. 

                                  BRUCE CAMPBELL
                    But surely there must be limits to 
                    what God intended Man to reach for.

                                  VAN HELSING
                    That sounds like the sentiment of 
                    someone afraid of his own 
                      ignorance, Mr. Campbell.

      Campbell s cronies elbow him and snicker at his  ignorance. 

                                  VAN HELSING (CONT D)
                    God, in his wisdom, gave us the 
                    natural world to explore and 
                    inquire into. As God is infinite, 
                    so too are the mysteries he gave us 
                    to solve. 

      Mina finds the nerve to speak up, quoting Shakespeare--

                    I only meant to agree with you, 
                      Professor. That there are mysteries 
                    that men -- and women -- can only

                    know, perambulating?

      Mina simmers, frustrated that she might never fit into this 
      man s world. Van Helsing notices.

                                  VAN HELSING
                    There are, I think, more possible 
                      impossibilities in this world than 
                    we are ready to believe. Consider 
                      mesmerism.

      He looks expectantly at Mina. After a beat, she realizes--

                                  MINA
                    Or mediums. 

                                  VAN HELSING
                      Spontaneous human combustion. 

                                  MINA
                    And the Haitian zombies!

      Van Helsing nods at her, then addresses the others--

                                  VAN HELSING
                    My point: the superstitions of 
                    yesterday might yet become the 
                    science of today.

      Campbell and his cronies grouse at such heretical notions.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    28.



      Grayson enters wearing wrinkled clothes, a smoking jacket, 
      and a bow tie that hangs loose around his neck. At one end of 
      the rectangular room is a large desk and suits of armor and--

                                    GRAYSON
                    I do apologize for the wait. It was 
                    a rather long night--

      He freezes. At the other side of the room, beautiful lounge 
      chairs are set up on either side of a large window -- a 
      window with its curtains currently pulled open. An angular 
      wall of bright SUNLIGHT falls inside next to HARKER.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    You ve opened the curtains.

                                  HARKER
                    One gets so used to the smog, the 
                    sun s rare appearance shouldn t be 
                    taken for granted. Do you mind?

      After a hesitant beat, Grayson flashes his charming smile, 
      despite a faked bleariness in his eyes, and strides forward.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Not at all. It s...what time is it?

                                  HARKER
                    Three o clock.

                                    GRAYSON
                          (smiles mischievously)
                    A very long night.

      He stops on one side of the light. Another beat, then he 
      reaches his hand INTO THE SUNLIGHT. Harker shakes it.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    It s so good of you to come. Wine?

      He quickly turns away then, moving toward a dry bar.

                                  HARKER
                    Thank you.

      Grayson s hand, we now see, is SMOKING. He s using the 
      pouring of a glass of red wine to hide this.

                                  HARKER (CONT D)
                    You should know my editor thinks 
                    you re after some sort of puffery.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    29.

      CONTINUED:

                                    GRAYSON
                    A puff piece? And why would he 
                    think that?

                                  HARKER
                    Well, I don t exactly get a lot of 
                    requests for interviews from those 
                    in your, uh, position. 

                                    GRAYSON
                    The rich?

                                  HARKER
                    The privileged. Usually, they run 
                    the other way.

                                    GRAYSON
                    That s because you stand up for the 
                    man on the street. Against the same 
                    vested interests who would prefer I 
                    return to America.  

                                  HARKER
                    I didn t think anyone had noticed.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Well, I did. It s precisely why I 
                    sought you out.

      He holds the wine glass out for Harker, but on his side of 
      the wall of sunlight. Harker has to reach for it.

                                  HARKER
                    You re not drinking?

                                    GRAYSON
                    I don t drink. Not wine, at least. 

      He almost smiles at this private joke.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    So, Mr. Harker, you re free to ask 
                    me anything you d like.

      They sit in chairs on opposite sides of the wall of light. 

                                  HARKER
                    Very well.

      He pulls a pencil and note pad from his jacket.

                                  HARKER (CONT D)
                    Why England?



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    30.

                                    GRAYSON
                    This is the country of my great-
                      grandparents  birth. In that 
                    regard, it s a homecoming.

                                  HARKER
                    It has nothing to do with Edison 
                    running you out of the States?

      Grayson smiles, amused by the adversarial question. Eyes pass 
      over the room s decor; antiques collide with modern art.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Europe speaks to me in a way no 
                    other place does. We call it the 
                    Old World for a reason, and yet its 
                    people search for the new wherever 
                    they can. I understand this 
                    struggle. I come from an old family 
                    myself, but my mind is always fixed 
                    on the future. I surround myself 
                    with things that speak to this. 

                                  HARKER
                    You re full of contradictions, 
                    aren t you?

                                    GRAYSON
                          (chuckles)
                    So is the world. This is why I 
                    wanted to talk to you. We re on the 
                    precipice of great change. We have 
                    it in us to redefine our species. 

                                  HARKER
                    You say species like we re animals.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Isn t that what Darwin taught us? 
                    But as such, we can evolve. That s 
                    what I ve come here to accomplish.

      Harker scribbles in his pad: VISIONARY/DELUSIONAL EGOMANIAC?

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Tell me...do you like automobiles?

                                                                          BACK TO:


      As students shuffle out, Van Helsing, carrying  books and the 
      newspaper he discussed with his class, unlocks a door--                                                                                    31.



      Van Helsing enters. His office is a repository of SCIENCE and 
      the OCCULT. Towers of old books teeter precariously. Ghoulish 
      tribal masks, ancient imagery of monsters, and jars of 
      preserved specimens clutter shelves. GARLIC CLOVES and DRIED 
      PURPLE FLOWERS hang from the ceiling. 

                                  MINA
                      Professor.

      Mina is standing in the doorway, a satchel over her shoulder.

                                  VAN HELSING
                    Ah, Miss Murray. 

      Mina s eyes pass over the room s odd decor and then land on a 
      book entitled MANIFESTATIONS OF THE SUPERNATURAL on a filing 
      cabinet next to the door. She seems uneasy.

                                  VAN HELSING (CONT D)
                    Is something the matter, child?

                                  MINA
                    Earlier, you said that God gave us 
                    the natural world to explore. 

                                  VAN HELSING
                          (carefully)
                    That is the generally held opinion, 
                    yes.

                                  MINA
                    Campbell says you were sacked from 
                    your last university post for 
                      suggesting otherwise.

                                  VAN HELSING
                    A mistake on my part.  

                                  MINA
                    Was it? Jonathan -- he's my...well, 
                    I don't know what he is -- he 
                    thinks I need to pay more attention 
                    to the Bible than my education.

                                  VAN HELSING
                    Ah.

      He turns away to set his books and newspaper on his desk next 
      to a cylinder phonograph, then drops into his chair. When he 
      looks at Mina again, she s closing her satchel.




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    32.

                    There are those today, myself 
                    included, who think the natural and 
                      supernatural worlds are closely 
                    connected -- that there is, in 
                    fact, a scientifically observable 
                    link. 
                          (winks)
                    Of course, I would never say such 
                    things aloud, especially to a 
                    student such as yourself.

      Mina smiles, understanding, and turns to leave.

                                  VAN HELSING (CONT D)
                    Miss Murray.

      Mina looks back.

                                  VAN HELSING (CONT D)
                    If you still have any faith at all, 
                    I pray you hold onto it. The real 
                    world is much too horrific to face 
                    without such... 
                          (tries to be delicate)
                      ...stories to comfort yourself.

      Mina nods, grateful, and exits. Van Helsing turns his 
      attention to the newspaper--

      CLOSE on the headline s byline: JONATHAN HARKER. And the 
      headline: SIR CLIVE COLLINS ATTACKED BY WOLF. 

                                  VAN HELSING (CONT D)
                          (growls angrily)
                    If only.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Harker holds on for dear life as Grayson races at 12mph 
      (19kph) through London under the protection of a hood. Both 
      wear goggles and have to speak loudly over the engine; 
      Grayson also wears a stylish hat and piped gloves. 

                                  HARKER
                    This is remarkable! You re the 
                      prototypical self-made American! 
                    You came from nothing, a farm in 
                    Nebraska! Now look at you! We 
                    English aren t nearly as good at 
                    advancing our status in life!



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    33.

      CONTINUED:

      Grayson studies Harker for a long moment, understanding the 
      implication of what Harker has revealed about himself.

      An OLD GENTLEMAN leaps out of the way of the motorcar.

                                  OLD GENTLEMAN
                    Slow down!

                                    GRAYSON
                    I ll rip out your intestines and 
                    skip rope with them!

      Harker is shocked by such language. Grayson smiles at him.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    This wasn t exactly a lifelong 
                    dream, was it?!

      Harker isn t sure what Grayson means.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Being a journalist, Harker!

      Harker hesitates. This isn t a comfortable subject for him.

                                  HARKER
                    I...I studied to be a solicitor!

                                    GRAYSON
                    But things didn t work out!

                                  HARKER
                    It was for the best! The law turned 
                    out not to be for me!

                                    GRAYSON
                    Still, you re a man of ambition! 
                    Women must...how do you English put 
                    it?! Fancy that about you?!

                                  HARKER
                    As it happens, I m engaged! Well, 
                    not exactly. But soon, I hope! She 
                    waited for me, if you can believe 
                    it, since she was eight!

                                    GRAYSON
                    Mina?!

                                  HARKER
                    I don t recall telling you her 
                    name!




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    34.

      CONTINUED:

                                    GRAYSON
                    We must have met at the party!

      Harker nods as if that must be it.

                                  HARKER
                    She finds you terribly impressive! 
                    She s a...I guess you d say fanatic 
                    for the natural sciences!

      Grayson raises an eyebrow. 

                                  HARKER (CONT D)
                    She s determined to earn herself a 
                    degree! Whatever she ll do with 
                    such a thing, I have no idea! She s 
                    very modern, as you can imagine!

                                    GRAYSON
                    And that makes you uncomfortable!

      Before Harker can answer--

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Hold on!

      He turns abruptly through the gates of--


      Whereas Van Helsing s office is a claustrophobic haven of 
      study, Grayson s library is an immense personal museum of 
      scientific curiosities, artifacts, and artwork. He passes by 
      a large El Bosco-style mural of battlefield impalements, 
      arriving at an enormous, unlit fireplace. He looks up--

                                    GRAYSON
                    My love.

      Above the mantle is a 500-year-old portrait of Dracula s long-
      dead wife ILONA -- except she LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE MINA.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    Why return to me now, when I am so 
                    close to making them account for 
                    what they did to you?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      No lights on. MOVE IN on a door knob. Something CLICKS and 
      SCRAPES against metal, then the lock s TUMBLER TURNS and 
      CLINK-CLUNKS. The door slowly opens now with a long creak -- 
      revealing Kruger, who stands from picking the lock. 


      As Kruger moves into the dark parlor, PULL BACK over clusters 
      of colorful flowers and then the BODY OF SIR CLIVE. Before 
      funeral homes, this is how people were publicly mourned.

      Kruger approaches the body. Upon closer inspection, we find 
      Sir Clive has been rebuilt for public viewing. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    36.

      CONTINUED:

      Caked make-up covers stitches and part of the forehead looks 
      like it s been crushed. An ear was sewn back on.

      Kruger yanks the body s collar loose, finding a GASHED NECK 
      sewn back together with coarse thread. He probes these wounds 
      with his fingers, indifferent to the gross noises this 
      produces. Worried by what he finds, he opens his coat--

      Inside, several LARGE KNIVES, a CROSS, two STAKES, and CLOVES 
      OF GARLIC hang from a rig.

      CUT TO him stuffing garlic into Sir Clive s mouth. The jaw 
      bones pop at being forced open. 

      CUT TO him pounding a stake into Sir Clive s heart, blunting 
      the sound of the hammer striking the stake with a folded 
      piece of fabric. He knows what he s doing.

      CUT TO him sawing away at Sir Clive s neck. 

      Finally, the head comes loose and rolls away, landing O.S. on 
      the floor with a THUD.

      Kruger sighs having not meant to make any noise. He turns, 
      bloody knife in hand, and freezes at the sight of--

      A GIRL (8) in her bed clothes, standing in the doorway. 
      Confused, frightened. Kruger doesn t know what to say. After 
      several awkward, darkly comic beats-- 

                                  KRUGER
                    Years from now, when you think back 
                    on this night, trust that what was 
                    done was necessary to preserve your 
                    papa s soul.

      The girl faints. 

                                  KRUGER (CONT D)
                    Hmph.

      Kruger spins his knife in hand, sheathing it in one 
      continuous movement, and walks out -- stepping unemotionally 
      over the girl s body.

      FADE IN:


      Four men -- each dressed in priestly robes, the sort secret 
      societies love to mass-produce -- stand before a Christian 
      altar and the standard of THE ORDER OF THE DRAGON (a dragon 
      consuming its tail so that it appears like a circle). 

      Lords Davenport and Laurent are two of these men, as well as 
      the marquess LORD ROTHCRAFT (50s) and the Order s highest-
      ranking member MR. BROWNING (late-40s; stern face). Together, 
      they are the DRACONIAN HIGH COUNCIL OF ENGLAND. 

                                  LORD DAVENPORT
                    We need to reach a conclusion about 
                    how to handle the American.

                                  LORD ROTHCRAFT
                    The Order of the Dragon has spent 
                    half a century maneuvering 
                      governments and their industries 
                    toward the coming war with the 
                    Ottomans. We can t let this Grayson 
                    meddle with a plan laid out by the 
                    Almighty Himself.

                                  LORD LAURENT
                    Atop Moslem bones we will build a 
                    new empire of the Cross that will 
                    spread across the globe. Every soul 
                    on this planet is at stake.

      CONTINUED:

                                  MR. BROWNING
                    The Holy Eye has asked that we 
                    watch him--

      The others aren t happy about that.

                                  MR. BROWNING (CONT D)
                    For now. Perhaps he might even have 
                    a part to play in what's to come.

      Somewhere, a BELL TOLLS. The High Council turns as Kruger, 
      wearing white robes emblazoned with an embroidered dragon 
      wrapped around a cross, enters and kneels. 

                                  KRUGER
                      I inspected the body as instructed. 
                    Whatever attacked Sir Clive might 
                    have looked like a wolf, but it was 
                    not. Nor was it...human.

                                  MR. BROWNING
                    A vampire then?

                                  KRUGER
                      Impossible to say for certain.

                                  LORD ROTHCRAFT
                    This is not a matter where 
                      uncertainty can be accepted.

                                  KRUGER
                    Of course not, Your Eminence. That 
                    is why I cut off his head.

      Davenport and Laurent look at each other, surprised. 

                                  MR. BROWNING
                    It was necessary. If he was turned, 
                    at least now he will never rise 
                    from the dead.
                          (beat)
                    The more pressing matter is, if 
                    this is a vampire, why didn t our 
                    Seers warn Kruger here about it? 
                    Isn t that their job?

                                                                            CUT TO:


      It s a bustling post-races party inside an extravagantly 
      appointed tent. Mina and Harker stand with a group, in the 
      middle of a conversation we can t hear. 



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    44.

      CONTINUED:

      REVERSE to a CLOSE-UP of Grayson, watching Mina with a 
      brooding intensity that might pop a blood vessel...if he had 
      any blood in his blood vessels.

                                  LADY JAYNE (O.S.)
                    I didn t expect to find you here.

      Lady Jayne has joined him, also watching Mina and Harker.

                                  LADY JAYNE (CONT D)
                    You don t strike me as the 
                      equestrian sort.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I grew up with horses, actually. 

                                  LADY JAYNE
                    You ride?

                                    GRAYSON
                          (looks sideways at her)
                    Whenever I get the opportunity.

                                  LADY JAYNE
                          (smiles, pleased)
                    Much better. I was afraid you might 
                    offer me another tour.

      Meanwhile, Mina has caught sight of Lady Jayne leading 
      Grayson by the hand.

                                  LUCY (O.S.)
                    Mina!

      Mina s thoughts about Grayson are interrupted as LUCY 
      APPEARS, arms thrown out before embracing her. 

                                  HARKER
                          (dryly)
                    Lucy. It s so good to see you.

      Lucy shoots him a smirk. Mina steps back from her hug.

                                  MINA
                    I didn t know you were here.

                                  LUCY
                    I came with Count Montafia.

      The Spanish Count from the Carfax Abbey party smiles from 
      just behind her. A little lost. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    45.

                                  LUCY (CONT D)
                    He doesn t speak a word of English, 
                    but, you know, I don t mind at all.

      Mina laughs even as her gaze returns to Grayson...who s gone.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      CHEFS and SERVERS whirl about as Lady Jayne leads Grayson 
      through them.

                                  LADY JAYNE
                    This way.

      In a corner, they fall against the tent wall. He kisses her 
      hard even as she pulls him through a tent-flap into another--


      This one is royally appointed, with beautiful works of art. 

                                  LADY JAYNE
                    There s someone I want to introduce 
                    you to.

      Five or six UPPER-CRUST TYPES mingle with a woman in a simple 
      dark-grey gown, her back to us; she s clearly older, though, 
      and her body has long ago given way to thick curves.

                                  LADY JAYNE (CONT D)
                    This is the industrialist I told 
                    you about, ma am.

      The older woman turns. Grayson s eyes widen.

                                  LADY JAYNE (CONT D)
                    Mr. Grayson, meet Her Royal 
                    Majesty. Queen Victoria.

      QUEEN VICTORIA (70s; grey hair) gives Grayson a close-lipped, 
      maybe even playful smile. She knows she s the queen, and she 
      knows what impact her presence has on others.

      Off Grayson s intrigued face--

      FADE IN:


      Victoria extends her hand. Grayson, quickly masking his 
      surprise, takes it and bows so that his head tilts forward.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Your Majesty, it s an honor.

                                  QUEEN VICTORIA
                    So you re the one trying to drag my 
                    backward country into the future. 

      Lady Jayne smiles privately at Victoria s jab. Grayson lifts 
      his head, greeting Victoria with his most charming smile.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Even if she goes kicking and 
                      screaming. I enjoy a good struggle.

      Lady Jayne s smile vanishes at Grayson s lack of propriety.

                                  QUEEN VICTORIA
                    Indeed. My beloved husband, Prince 
                    Albert -- bless his soul -- was a 
                    great advocate of the sciences. 

      Grayson pauses, considering his options. 

                                    GRAYSON
                    I m sure you have a great many 
                      questions, as His Royal Highness 
                    would have. Perhaps I could answer 
                    them if you were to allow me to 
                    host you for dinner? 

                                  QUEEN VICTORIA
                          (to Lady Jayne)
                    He s awfully indecorous.

                                  LADY JAYNE
                    He s an American, ma am.

                    Forgive me. I merely don t want 
                      scandalous gossip to be all you 
                    know of my work. There are those 
                    who worry they re too progressive.

      Victoria regards him for a moment, distracted by Grayson s 
      hypnotic eyes now. Then--

                                  QUEEN VICTORIA
                    Progress is never to be feared.

                                    GRAYSON
                          (sly smile)
                    You might want to tell your 
                      Parliament that.

      Lady Jayne drops her head, trying not to look too 
        embarrassed. Victoria looks at her.

                                  QUEEN VICTORIA
                      Indecorous indeed. 
                          (to Grayson)
                    Perhaps I will take you up on your 
                    offer, young man.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I ll even let you sit at the head 
                    of my table.

      Victoria cocks an enigmatic eyebrow: annoyed or amused?

      Grayson, with a quick head bow, backs away toward the tent-
      flap. He glances at Lady Jayne, wondering if she s following. 
      Victoria leans close to Lady Jayne and whispers--

                                  QUEEN VICTORIA
                    Be cautious with that one, Jayne. 
                    He ll be the end of you.

      Lady Jayne watches Grayson leave, smiling about him.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Grayson and Lady Jayne climb into the opulent carriage, a 
      sense of urgency in every movement. He drops onto the 
      backseat as she pulls shut the door. 

                                    GRAYSON
                    Come here.

      He pulls Lady Jayne by the wrist on top of him, harder than 
      he has to. As she struggles to lift her dress and straddle 
      him properly (the dress, of course, hiding this)--

                                  LADY JAYNE
                    I've never been with an American.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    48.

      CONTINUED:

      Grayson yanks off his bow tie. This is all about primal 
        satisfaction for him.

                                    GRAYSON
                    You'll find we don't share much in 
                    common with Englishmen.

                                  LADY JAYNE
                    Hm. So far I find you every bit as 
                    rigid.

      She drops atop him, straddling him. 

                                    GRAYSON
                    And are all Englishwomen like you?

                                  LADY JAYNE
                    Only the ones who were paddled too 
                    much at boarding school.

                                    GRAYSON
                    That sounds rough.

      She kisses him, sucking on his bottom lip as she whispers--

                                  LADY JAYNE
                    I didn't mind.


      CLOSE on Lord Laurent, his head leaned back, eyes closed, as 
      he enjoys the dense steam bath.

                                  LORD LAURENT
                    I heard some chaps in the card room 
                      discussing Grayson. Apparently, 
                    he s been buying up empty factories 
                    along the Thames.

      CLOSE on Lord Davenport, head also back, eyes also closed.

                                  LORD DAVENPORT
                    No doubt for another of his absurd 
                    projects. He s an agitator, I tell 
                    you. An immodest, vulgar agitator.

      CLOSE on Grayson, head also back, eyes also closed.

                                    GRAYSON
                      I couldn t agree more.

      WIDE NOW. Davenport and Laurent s heads snap forward. 
      Grayson, in a white robe as opposed to their towels, sits 
      between them -- utterly nonchalant about his sudden presence.

                                  LORD DAVENPORT
                    Grayson! W-We didn t hear you come 
                    in.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    50.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I ve been told I have a light step. 

                                  LORD LAURENT
                    I-I didn t know you were a member 
                    at this club.

                                    GRAYSON
                          (sits up now)
                    Joined last week. I don t think 
                    they cared to let  someone from the 
                    colonies  in, but it s astounding 
                    what being disgustingly rich can do 
                    for your social career.

      Davenport and Laurent look appalled by such language.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                      Now...Pandora Industries.

                                  LORD DAVENPORT
                    We ve been over this.

                                    GRAYSON
                    I had hoped you d changed your 
                    minds, but, of course, I understand 
                    why if you haven t. You each sit on 
                    the boards of companies that have 
                    invested heavily, one might even 
                    say critically, in fossil fuels 
                    that would be made obsolete by my 
                    wireless energy technology. 

                                  LORD LAURENT
                    This conversation is pointless, 
                    Grayson. Even if the two of us sold 
                    you our shares, you still wouldn t 
                    hold a controlling stake. 

                                    GRAYSON
                    Well, that s not exactly true. At 
                    least not since this morning. Sir 
                    Clive s widow has sold me his 
                    shares. It appears Sir Clive had 
                    some considerable gambling debts, 
                    enough to ruin his estate--

                                  LORD LAURENT
                    Dear God! How could you prey on a 
                    widow not three days after her 
                    husband tragically died?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    51.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Prey? I saved her from ruin. 
                          (acts like he s thinking)
                    I wonder if the rest of the country 
                    realizes the wars that will have to 
                    be waged to control the natural 
                    resources you have such faith in.

                                  LORD LAURENT
                    Are you...threatening us, Grayson?

                                    GRAYSON
                    Quite the opposite. I applaud your 
                    business acumen. You are, after 
                    all, only in this for 
                      profit...aren t you?

      He leans back his head, closing his eyes. Time to relax.

      Off Davenport and Laurent s worried looks--

                                                                            CUT TO:


      Lords Davenport and Laurent enter. Laurent is clearly upset.

                                  LORD LAURENT
                    I m telling you, he knows more than 
                    he s letting on. This Grayson is 
                    going to be a real problem.

                                  LORD DAVENPORT
                    You heard Browning. We must wait.

                                  LORD LAURENT
                    Browning is out of his league. By 
                    God, Clive was killed by a vampire 
                    under his watch.

                                  LORD DAVENPORT
                    The Seers will find the monster, 
                    they always do. In fact, I bet 
                    Kruger is onto it even as we speak.



                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    52.

      He takes Laurent by both cheeks.

                    You must have faith.


      Mina sits in bed, reading by lamp light MANIFESTATIONS OF THE 
        SUPERNATURAL -- which she stole from Van Helsing. We see an 
        illustration of a corpse lying between what looks like two 
      electricity spitting transformers.

                                  MINA
                     The resurrection of the dead, once 
                    the work solely of necromancers, is 
                    now believed to be within the reach 
                    of human accomplishment. 

      She turns the page and a PHOTOGRAPH falls out of the book. 
      It s a partially burned portrait of VAN HELSING, HIS WIFE, 
      AND TWO CHILDREN. Something about it uneases her.

      PLINKT! A pebble bounces off the window. 




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    55.

      Mina jumps, gasping. Another pebble bounces off the glass.

      CLOSE on the back of a woman as her undergarments fall away 
      from her body -- revealing beautiful skin and, on the 
      shoulder blade, the same tattoo that Grayson has. 

                                  LADY JAYNE (V.O.)
                    We now know the worst. Or at least 
                    the beginning of it. A vampire, 
                      previously unknown to us, has taken 
                    up residence in London.

      Lady Jayne, her face still hidden from us, raises her arms 
      and a hooded white robe like Kruger wore drops over her body.

                                  LADY JAYNE (V.O.)
                    Its purpose is also unknown, but 
                    it s powerful. Old and powerful... 
                    and it killed our greatest hunter 
                    tonight. I ve just come from 
                      retrieving his body. This beast 
                    must be identified, and then 
                      destroyed. 

                                                                            CUT TO:                                                                                    57.



      The Draconian High Council stand at the head of the temple. 
      Mr. Browning addresses someone O.S.--

                                  MR. BROWNING
                    Are you up to the task?

      Across from Mr. Browning stands Lady Jayne in her hooded 
      white robes. With one hand, she flips back the hood to reveal 
      her identity now. With a smile that somehow expresses both 
      malevolence and complete confidence, she says--

                                  LADY JAYNE
                    I m way ahead of you, gentlemen.

      Her other hand, we now see, holds a leather sack. She tosses 
      it forward and it lands with an odd thud at the High 
      Council s feet. A HUMAN HEAD half rolls out of it--

      It s Kruger s!

                                  LADY JAYNE (CONT D)
                    Just in case he was turned, you 
                      understand.

      The High Council look disgusted. Except Mr. Browning, who 
      looks very, very pleased.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      The library is dark, empty. The terrace doors open then; 
      light fog rolls inside and Grayson, naked but for shadows 
      that wrap around him, enters with it. 

      ANGLE FROM BEHIND A STUFFED BEAR. Someone watches Grayson 
      take a knee-length smoking coat from a hook and slip it on. 

      Grayson then limps to a large book shelf. Here, he pulls a 
      copy of Thomas Browne s PSEUDODOXIA EPIDEMICA, which causes 
      the shelf to slide sideways. Behind the shelf--

      A HIDDEN RECESS where photos (many from Grayson s party) and 
      newspaper clippings of Draconians hang over a world map, each 
      connected by strings and notes. Amongst the faces are those 
      of Sir Clive (red X painted over it), Lords Davenport, 
      Laurent, and Marland, and, in sketch form, Kruger. 

      From behind the bear, VAN HELSING slowly emerges from the 
      shadows -- is he about to attack?




                                                                              (CONTINUED)                                                                                    58.

      CONTINUED:

      Grayson rips down the sketch of Kruger. Then, without 
      turning, says (in AN AMERICAN ACCENT again)--

                                    GRAYSON
                    I can smell that cologne of yours 
                    from a hundred yards.
                          (turns now)
                    I was wondering when you d show up.

      Van Helsing waits a beat. Then snarls--

                                  VAN HELSING
                    The plan was to use Sir Clive s 
                    gambling debts to make him sell us 
                    his shares. You weren t supposed to 
                    kill him!

      In an instant, Grayson is standing inches from Van Helsing. 
      Lips twitching, suggesting fangs could be bared. His open 
      hand, CLAWS extended, hovers over Van Helsing s cheek.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Who are you to tell me what to do? 
                    In these veins courses the blood of 
                    Attila. You are (sniffs) food.

      Van Helsing holds his breath, waiting. Trying not to flinch. 
      Finally, Grayson steps back. Van Helsing exhales.

                                    GRAYSON (CONT D)
                    I saw an opportunity and took it.

                                  VAN HELSING
                    It was impetuous and careless.

                                    GRAYSON
                    It got the job done. 

      Van Helsing pauses. He can t argue with that.

                                  VAN HELSING
                    The Order of the Dragon will will 
                    react and quickly.

                                    GRAYSON
                    Bah! They will fumble blindly, no 
                    more. Dracula, as far as they re 
                      concerned, is a best-forgotten 
                      nightmare. Their focus will be on 
                    Allan Grayson and the threat his 
                      technologies pose to their vision 
                    for the 20th Century.

                    If we deprive them of their need of 
                    oil, then the war they re trying to 
                    start with the Ottomans will be 
                    futile and, without the war, how 
                    else will they create the new world 
                    order they dream of? We ll destroy 
                    their business first, then their 
                    faith, and then their very souls.

                                                                    FLASHBACK TO:


      We re back in the crypt from the teaser. The German is 
      bleeding into the sarcophagal effigy s mouth.

                                    GRAYSON (V.O.)
                    For six years now we ve plotted and 
                    schemed and built up this empire of 
                    lies, ever since you raised me from 
                    that empty nothing.

      Shadow-man leans into a LOW ANGLE CLOSE-UP as he tugs his 
      scarf off his face -- revealing VAN HELSING.

                                                                          BACK TO:


      Grayson looks at Van Helsing.

                                    GRAYSON
                    We will finally have our vengeance 
                    on the Order for what they ve done 
                    to us, Doctor. We will have our 
                      vengeance.

                                  VAN HELSING
                    Let nothing stand in our way.

      Grayson s eyes drift to the PORTRAIT OF ILONA above the 
      fireplace. Mina, of course, was not part of the plan.

      Van Helsing glances up at the portrait now, too, registering 
      the similarity to Mina for the first time. He s suddenly very 
      afraid for her.

      And from Ilona s face, we--

                                                                      DISSOLVE TO:                                                                                    60.



      Mina s sleeping face, still puffy from crying. 

      On the night stand beside her bed, a PHOTO OF HARKER beside a 
      vase of EDELWEISS FLOWERS. 

      The battle for Mina s heart has begun.
