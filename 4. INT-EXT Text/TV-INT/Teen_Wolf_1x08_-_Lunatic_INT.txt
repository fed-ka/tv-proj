      With Kate riding shotgun, Argent peers out from behind the 
      wheel at the school. In the backseat, Allison tries to open 
      the door but the CHILD SAFETY LOCK is on.

      Scott follows the other students into the exam room. The 
      moment he steps in, however, he spots Allison already seated. 
      She gives him a brief glance, then focuses her eyes down, 
      clearly trying very hard not to look at him.

      Mr. Harris places a stack of Blue Exam Books at the first 
      desk of each row. The students begin handing them back.

      and excruciating it causes him to flinch--

      A PENCIL ERASER dragging across a sheet of paper with an

      Senses heightened, Scott can t help but focus in on the 
      nervousness around him. He looks back to the test.

      The next question: Why would a girl that pretty go out with a 
      loser like you?

      Scott gazes at the question, eyes blinking. Then looks over 
      to Allison who is busily filling in her own test.

      When Scott turns back the question on his sheet has changed 
      to: Which one of the following statements about price 
      mechanism is correct?

      Rubbing his eyes with his fingers, he marks down the answer 
      with his pen. Then looks at the next question:

      When the moon is full tonight will you kill: A: All of your 
      friends? B: Some of your friends? C: Most of your friends? 

      Scott slams his pencil back down on the desk, squeezing his 
      eyes shut. But with his eyelids closed, his heightened 
      HEARING begins to pick up the HEARTBEATS around him. 

      As the thumping becomes louder and louder, a CELL PHONE 
      VIBRATES on a desk. Someone pulls their chair forward, METAL 
      SCRAPING over the floor--

      Scott darts up from his seat, grabbing his bag.

      following Harris s curious gaze.

      picking it up.

      Stiles steps into the locker room, the RING NOW LOUDER. When 
      it stops, he listens in. One of the SHOWERS is on.

      Scott s jacket and shirt lie on the floor. Stiles slowly 
      steps past them and further into the locker room to find 
      Scott kneeling underneath one of the showers, water spraying 
      onto his torso.

      His back rises with each troubled breath. He slowly looks up 
      at Stiles.

      Watching him struggle with each gasp, Stiles quickly drops 
      Scott s bag to the floor, unzips it and begins rifling 
      inside. Finding the item he s looking for, he turns back to 
      Scott who has crawled out from the spray of water to lean 
      against the tile wall.

                    It was more than that. It was like 
                    I could feel everything in there.

                    It s got to be the full moon. So we 
                    lock you in your room later like we 
                    planned. That way the Alpha, who is

                    He s not the Alpha. And I think we 
                    need to do more than lock me in my 
                    room.

                                  STILES
                    What? You mean because if you get 
                    out you could get caught by 
                    hunters?

                                  SCOTT
                    No. Because if I get out... I think 
                    I might kill someone.

      Argent lays out a topographical map of Beacon Hills in the

                    Because, my young proteg , an Alpha 
                    is like any other werewolf on a 
                    full moon. It still struggles under 
                    its sway. Which means tonight is 
                    our best chance to catch it. When 
                    it s unfocused.

                    I just don t like surprises. You re

      A SOUND stops him. The door to the kitchen creaking open. 
      Mrs. Argent stands with a plate held in her hands.

                    Anyone want a cookie?


      Allison pulls a plastic-wrapped chocolate chip cookie from a 
      brown paper bag during lunch. She smiles at the sticky note 
      attached with a smiley face on it and the words: Love Mom. 

      Jackson sits down to join her as she takes a bite.

      Jackson turns from his locker. He spots Stiles and Scott *

      fast as Scott turns in surprise. But he reacts too late.

      With a CLICK Stiles locks one end of a pair of HANDCUFFS 
      around Scott s wrist and then hauls him down to the floor to 
      latch the other end to the RADIATOR by his bed.

      FADE IN:


      Allison walks the aisle of a small sports store, eyes 
      wandering the shelves until she finds what she s looking 
      for... THE ARCHERY SECTION.

      While checking the price on one of the fiber optic sights, 
      she glances up to notice someone on the opposite side of the 
      shelf smiling at her.

                                    JACKSON
                    What are you doing here?

                    Why do I get the feeling you could

                    Is it that obvious?

                                    JACKSON
                    Maybe because I m kind of feeling 
                    the same way.

      And she smiles, exactly what she was hoping to hear.

      Stiles comes back into Scott s room to find him still 
      struggling against the handcuffs. Stiles holds up an uncapped 
      BOTTLE OF WATER.

      He pours the bottle into a DOG BOWL and gently sets it down 
      on the floor next to the bed.


      As Stiles steps out of the bedroom, the dog bowl FLIPS into 
      the air, soaring past and bouncing off the wall.

      the handcuffs again and again until his wrist is BLOODY. But 
      then he stops when--

                    What was that?*

      Allison reaches for the door--

      He pulls her back, clearly more frightened than she is.*


      Stiles tears around the corner and SLAMS on the brakes. He 
      spots several SHERIFF S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CARS parked next to 
      an AMBULANCE just by the side of the road.

      Argent peers out from behind the wheel, Kate riding shotgun.

                    You going to tell me about that 
                    talk you had with her?

                                  KATE
                    Tell me something first. That night 
                    you came across the two Betas? One *
                    of them was smaller, right? Was he 
                    just smaller? Or could he have been 
                    younger too?

                                  ARGENT
                    You have an idea who it might be?

                    I m working on a theory.


      Derek helps an exhausted Scott to his bed. The room is a 
      disaster from his temporary imprisonment.

                                  SCOTT
                    Wait.

      Derek looks back from the door.

                                  SCOTT (CONT D)
                    I can t do this. I can t be this 
                    and be with Allison. I need you to 
                    tell me the truth. Is there a cure?        TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/1143.

                    For someone who was bitten? I ve 
                    heard of one. But I don t know if 
                    it s true.

                                  SCOTT
                    What is it?

                                  DEREK
                    You kill the one who bit you.

                    Kill the Alpha.

      His head falls at the weight of the task. But Derek steps 
      forward again, peering down at him.

                                  DEREK
                    You help me find him, Scott? And 
                    I ll help you kill him.

      Outside Scott s open window, the full moon still burns 
      brightly in the sky...


      A shaky and bewildered Jackson pulls his car into the garage 
      and gets out. But as he s closing the driver s side door, he 
      pauses...

      He spots something under the light. Something on his car... 
      He goes over to it and examines the rear windshield. 
      Something is stuck between where the glass and the roof meet.

      He plucks it out and raises it to the light.

      It s a CLAW...

      A LIGHT clicks on under a worktable. Jackson places the claw 
      down under the soft glow.        TEEN WOLF "Episode 108"GOLDENROD DRAFT1/20/1144.

      Next to it, he places a LACROSSE GLOVE he picked up on the 
      field after the end of the first game. The name written in 
      bold black letters on it: MCCALL.

      Jackson pauses, as if deciding whether he actually wants to 
      make the connection. But then he picks up the glove in one 
      hand, the claw in the other, and slowly brings them together.

      Just as the claw is about to fit into one of the fingertip 
        perforations we--          

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK.
