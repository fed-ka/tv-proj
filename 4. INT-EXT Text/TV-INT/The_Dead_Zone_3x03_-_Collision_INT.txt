          P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD

          The frantic THUP-THUP-THUP of windshield wipers is no
          match for the MACHINE-GUN RAIN punishing the cab roof on
          this epic night; nor for THE MACARENA, which BLASTS at
          top volume from a tinny A.M. radio.

          Then, abruptly, the screen goes DARK and SILENT.  But
          only for a second or two; then --


          P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD

          The same view a little further down the same road, and
          the same sounds: WIPERS.  RAIN.  MACARENA.  And then --
          BLACKNESS.  SILENCE.  Just for a beat.  Then we see --


          THE DRIVER

          IN SILENCE.  Late twenties.  Friendly face.  Five-o'clock
          shadow.  And, oh, he's ASLEEP.  A BUMP in the road awakens
          him and we hear WIPERS, RAIN, MACARENA again.  He grabs
          the wheel, straightens out the truck and, and then the
          driver--



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: COLLISION - TEASER - 2/13/04 - YELLOW       2.

          WINKS OUT AGAIN, just for a second this time, to SILENCE --
          his audio P.O.V., so to speak; then he AWAKENS and we
          hear WIPERS, RAIN, MACARENA.



          Johnny Smith at the wheel.  He's in high spirits, and why
          not?  He's young.  He's in love.  He's a popular teacher. 
          He's listening to Art Bell Coast to Coast on the radio:

                                        ART BELL (RADIO)
                        -- and this comet, they call it
                        Hale-Bopp, the experts are saying
                        it has a second blip behind it,
                        that Dr. Burns believes may be a
                        space ship.  Hale Bopp will reach
                        closest approach in March, 1997,
                        just a few months from now --

          Johnny smiles; he's listening "ironically." (Remember
          irony?)  Then, BRIGHT TRUCK LIGHTS bear down on him. 
            Milliseconds before the vehicles collide --

                                                                                  CUT TO:



          Johnny and REBECCA CALDWELL pack up Rachel's belongings;
          moving boxes are scattered across the floor.  A couple
            well-worn funeral bouquets grace the mantel.  Johnny holds
          a couple of books, and hesitates --

                                        JOHNNY
                          Rebecca?
                                (she looks up)
                        Rachel had all these religious
                        studies books.

                        Do you want to save them?  Or
                        should I put them in the Goodwill
                        box?

          Rebecca, her back to Johnny as she goes through a different
          box, answers without looking up from the pictures she has
          found.

                                        REBECCA
                          Goodwill.  I'm not going to haul
                        all those back to D.C. 

          Johnny adds the books to the goodwill box, then looks to
          Rebecca, seeing that she has started to cry.


          REBECCA

          Has found some of the pictures of her and Rachel as little
          girls (from episode one and two).  She fights back tears. 
          Johnny puts a supportive hand on her shoulder. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        You okay?

          After a beat, she pulls herself together.

                              (a beat)
                        I just can't believe she's gone.

                        I know.

          She gives him a long look.

                          Johnny... I've been meaning to
                        say 'thanks.'  You've been great
                        these last few weeks.

                        Why don't we take a break, get

          FLASHING RED LIGHTS flicker across the window.  There's a
          KNOCK at the door.  Rebecca answers to find Roscoe standing
          outside --

                        Johnny Smith's car outside. 
                        Sheriff Bannerman's been looking

          Johnny leans out.

                        lives out by Winnetka Farms. 
                        We've already got an Amber Alert
                        going -- but Walt sent this --

          Roscoe unwraps a handkerchief revealing an earring. 
          Rebecca watches, intrigued --

                                        ROSCOE
                        Said it's Katy's favorite.  The
                        mother said she's probably wearing
                        the other one.  Here's a picture.

          Johnny looks at the photo; Katy's a pretty eleven-year-
          old girl.  Rebecca takes the picture.

                                        REBECCA
                        Her parents must be worried sick.

                        Let me see what I can do.

          Johnny takes the earring, triggering:


77A VISION - MATCH MOVE MORPH

          The room melts away.  Johnny is engulfed in a sea of FIRE;
          its origin indistinct, but Johnny reels from the heat.



          Johnny, still in the grip of the vision, eyes closed tight,
          pulls his arms around himself, as if he is burning alive --

                                        REBECCA
                        What's happening?

                        Fire.  Everywhere... I'm burning.

          Rebecca pries the earring out of Johnny's hand.  Johnny's
          body relaxes and he regains his bearings, collapsing
          against the wall for support.  Roscoe helps steady him.

                        on fire.

          Johnny straightens up, a bit dazed.

          Johnny nods yes.  Rebecca watches, concern on her face as
          Walt hands Johnny the diary; triggering --



          Johnny stands in the corridor of a hospital as paramedics
          (including RICK FANULI, shaggy hair, late twenties) rush
          past him with a badly injured patient -- JOHNNY HIMSELF.

                                        FANULI
                        I don't think he's going to make
                        it.

          Johnny begins to follow the paramedics, but is distracted
          by...

          KATY

          standing at the end of the hallway, silent, eyes wide,
          staring straight through Johnny.  Nurses and Doctors rush
          past, ignoring her as they descend on the room the
          Paramedics went into.  As Johnny walks toward Katy, an
          incongruous sound begins to grow louder in the background,
            a distinctive KLAXON, blasting a pattern, two short - one
          long - two short - one long.

          Just as Johnny is about to reach Katy, he feels something
          hot.  He looks down at himself seeing:

          HIS HAND

          Burned badly, but still holding the charred diary.  He
          drops the diary and the VISION ENDS.



          Walt and Rebecca watch as Johnny drops the diary; flapping
          his hand in the air as if it were on fire.  He recovers
          almost instantly, but the phantom pain from his vision-
          burn lingers.

                        make it.

          takes Johnny's hand and looks it over.

          Vera and Reverend Purdy clasp their hands in prayer. 
          Johnny's attention turns to a lovely young woman leaning
          against the wall, trying not to cry: Sarah Bracknell. 


          IN THE REALITY HALF OF THE VISION

          Johnny turns to Rebecca:

                                        JOHNNY
                        My mom... she's here, in my
                          vision... and Sarah... it must be
                        the night of my accident nine
                        years ago... but...

          Johnny reacts to something Rebecca can't see.

                                        REBECCA
                                (worried)
                        Johnny?  You okay?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know...


          WHAT JOHNNY IS LOOKING AT

          Katy is walking among the people in the waiting room,
          passing right by Vera, Purdy and Sarah.  Johnny follows
          her, looking down at the floor where he sees:

          Katy's footprints are a trail of damp impressions, as if
          the linoleum were made of mud; and then her last several
          steps leave watery traces before her trail disappears
          around a corner.  He bends down to touch one of the wet
          footprints, FIRE SUDDENLY SHOOTING UP HIS ARM.  He jumps
          up and the VISION ENDS.



          As Johnny recoils back into Rebecca, shaking off the
          vision.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Something's wrong.

                                        REBECCA
                        What's the matter?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw my mother.

                        In your vision?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (nods)
                        And Sarah, and Reverend Purdy. 
                        The vision I had at the farmhouse. 
                        Where I'm injured?  It's not from
                        the future.  I was seeing myself
                        nine years ago... But that's not
                        what's wrong. 

                                        REBECCA
                        What is it then?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Katy Mercer was in the same vision.
                        Walked right through the waiting
                        room.  Right here.  Left a trail
                        of wet footprints.

          Johnny kneels down to the floor and runs his hand along
          the spot where Katy seemed to have left wet footprints;
          it's perfectly dry.

                                        REBECCA
                        But nine years ago, Katy would
                        have been two years old?

                                        JOHNNY
                        But there she was, looking like
                        she does today, walking through a
                        vision from 1995.  Somehow my
                        brain is confusing the two.

                                        REBECCA
                        Why would that be?

                        I don't know.

          Off their somber looks, a horrific image of Katy's fate
          flashing through their minds...

          FADE IN:


          Johnny and Rebecca puzzle through the vision he had --

                                        REBECCA
                        I want to help you figure this
                        out... Part of your vision is
                          straightforward --

                                        JOHNNY
                        - the night of my accident --

                                        REBECCA
                        Right.  1995.  Set that aside for
                          a minute.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Okay.

                                        REBECCA
                        The other part, the Katy Mercer
                        part -- it's not something that
                        really happened?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's not something that could
                        ever happen.

                                        REBECCA
                        So it's more like dream imagery?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Could be.  But that's not how my
                        visions normally work.

                                        REBECCA
                        You said yourself this was
                        different.  Sometimes our dreams
                        are a way for the the unconscious
                        mind to tell us something.  Maybe
                        your visions are sending you some
                        kind of message.

                                        JOHNNY
                        But what does Katy have to do
                        with the night of my accident?

                                        REBECCA
                          Something about her situation
                          resonates for you.  Even for
                        myself, searching for this girl
                        keeps making me think of Rachel.

                        So my visions of Katy are
                        triggering visions of the night
                        of my accident.

                                        REBECCA
                        And visions of your accident evoke
                        Katy.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (considers this)
                        And this could be my Dead Zone
                        trying to tell me something?  But
                        what?

                                        REBECCA
                        What else stood out about the
                        vision?

                                        JOHNNY
                        When she was walking... she left
                        wet footprints.

                                        REBECCA
                        Water?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Maybe...

          Johnny starts to dial his cell phone.  Announcements in
          the hospital P.A. indicate a trauma patient is arriving
          by ambulance.

                                        REBECCA
                        Who are you calling?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Walt.  Maybe it means Katy's near
                        a body of water.  It's a stretch
                        but...
                                (in phone)
                        Walt.  It's Johnny.  I think the
                        fire might start near a body of
                          water... I don't know what kind
                        of water: river?  lake?  pool?

          While he's on the phone a team of paramedics rush by,
          with a badly-injured woman; among them is E.M.T. Rick
          Fanuli, nine years older, and with shorter hair.

                                (then, seeing Fanuli)
                        Walt, I have to go.

          Johnny hangs up and runs after the gurney; at the door to
          the E.R. the paramedics hand off the patient to waiting
          doctors, who take her into the emergency room.  After the
          hand-off Rick walks to the counter.  Johnny stops him --

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me.  Sir?

                        Hi, my name's Johnny Smith.  Can
                        I ask you a couple questions?

                                        RICK
                                (slightly in awe)
                        I know who you are, Mr. Smith. 
                        I've been following your story in
                        the news for years.  I was the
                        first guy at your accident scene. 
                        I'm Rick Fanuli.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Nice to meet you, Rick.

          Johnny reaches out to shake Rick's hand, triggering --



          We're back to the night of the accident; Johnny-2004 sits
          in the back of a rescue vehicle.  Johnny babbles.

                                          JOHNNY-1995
                        ...Save many many lives...

                                        RICK
                        That's my job.

                                          JOHNNY-1995
                        ...Too much to do...

                                        RICK
                        Don't worry about a thing.  I'll
                        take care of you.  Relax now.          DEAD ZONE: COLLISION - ACT TWO - 2/20/04 - GOLD-2     19.



          URGENT PAGES for doctors are broadcast on the intercom;
          distant SIRENS whine; and Johnny-2004 watches as Rick-
          1995 and other paramedics speed past, pushing a gurney
          carrying a very bloodied Johnny-1995. 

          Then, all sound drops out; and the corridor is suddenly
          empty, except for Johnny-2004.  He turns around and sees --


          KATY

          At the far end of the corridor, shivering, seeming to
          look right through Johnny.  He walks toward her; she steps
          through a door.  Johnny follows.



          Katy is gone; what Johnny-2004 sees instead is Johnny-
          1995's broken, bloodied body; all around him doctors and
          nurses prep for surgery.

          In an omniscient wide view, Sarah pushes through, ducking
          around an orderly who tries to stop her; she takes Johnny-
          1995's broken hand in her own --

                                        SARAH
                        Oh, Johnny. 

          Johnny-1995 opens his eyes a sliver; it's unclear if he
          knows where he is.  He barely is able to whisper something
          to Sarah, and she bends close to listen, BUT WE DO NOT
          HEAR WHAT HE SAYS.

                                        SARAH
                        What Johnny?  ...Yes.
                                (listens more)
                        Yes.  We'll find him.  Don't worry
                        about that now.

          DR. McDOUGALL, 40's, a surgeon, interrupts --

                                        DR. MCDOUGALL
                        Ma'am.  You can't be back here --

          Johnny-1995 is struggling to say something; Sarah leans

          down to listen -- neither we, nor Johnny-2004 can hear
          what he says.  The doctors block her and an orderly starts
          to pull her away --

                                        SARAH
                        I'll always love you, Johnny. 

          The orderly pulls Sarah away, into the hall.  Johnny-2004
          stays behind; when there are no more civilians in the
          room, Fanuli leans to one of the nurses and whispers --

                                        RICK
                                  (whispering)

          The doctors rush Johnny-1995 into the O.R. and the vision
          ends.



          Johnny and Rick are still shaking hands; Johnny's right
          forearm and hand are charred black.  Johnny pulls his
            blackened hand away from Rick, startled --

                                        RICK
                        What's the matter?
                                (no reply)
                        You just had some kind of psychic
                          premonition or something didn't
                        you?

          Johnny examines his hand; it's perfectly normal, now.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Or something.

                                        RICK
                        Cool.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Rick, were you the one who pulled
                        me from my car?

                                        RICK
                        No one pulled you out of the car. 
                        You were already clear of the
                        wreck when I got there.  You must
                        have crawled out on your own.

                        An old lady driving past, called
                        from the gas station up the road.   
                        I'm positive I was the first guy
                        on the scene.

                        I wouldn't forget something about
                        that night.  It's my brush with
                        greatness: I'm the guy who saved
                        Johnny Smith's life. 

                                        JOHNNY
                        By the way, Rick, thanks.

                        No thanks necessary, it's my job.

          Johnny's phone rings.

          Walt holds up his phone to pick up the DISTINCTIVE SIREN
          blowing from a Klaxon inside the fire house.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll meet you there.
                                (then to Rebecca)
                        The siren I heard in my vision
                        was for a volunteer fire
                          department.  They've got a fire
                        near Fieldstone pond.  This could
                        be it.

                                        RICK
                        I just got the call.  You can
                        ride with me.



          Steam and smoke fill the air of the tiny, charred mobile
          home; Walt uses his gloved hands and the ax to rip open
          every cupboard and closet, but it's all so burned,  and
          the smoke so thick, it's impossible to tell if anyone is
          in amongst the wreckage.



          Johnny and Rebecca stand when Sarah enters the waiting
          room.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sarah.  Thanks for coming.

                        I got down here as fast as I could.

                        Hi.

                                (re: Rebecca's presence)
                        I was helping Rebecca pack when
                        Roscoe came and got me, she's
                        been a huge help.

                        Walt told me... that poor girl. 
                        What can I do to help?

                        I have to ask you something.  I
                        need you to help me remember
                          something about the worst night
                        of my life...

                        You were the last person I spoke
                        to that night.

                        Yes.  After we... were together
                        at the carnival.  What does this
                        have to do with the missing girl?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm not sure yet.  But in my
                        vision, we talked again, later,
                        here at the hospital, what did I
                        say to you?

                                        SARAH
                        Oh, Johnny... It was so chaotic. 
                        I was terrified... I thought you
                        were going to die... you were so
                        out of it... It's been nine
                          years...

          Rebecca is watching this, surprised to find out the full
          extent of Johnny and Sarah's relationship.

                          Sometimes our memories can be
                          merciful... we forget painful
                        moments... at least consciously.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (to Sarah)
                        That's why I asked you to meet me

                        my visions... maybe I can see

          Purdy.

                        and Reverend Purdy, almost all
                        night.  It felt like forever.

          On the vision side of the split-reality, Sarah-1995 sees
          the doctor gesture to Vera and Reverend Purdy; she walks
          over to join them.

          Sarah-1995 puts a supportive hand on Vera's shoulder to
          comfort her.  Purdy-1995 listens intently.  The doctor
          speaks quietly.

                        The impact of the crash was quite
                          substantial.  His femur suffered
                        two fractures; we put several
                        pins into his left foot. 
                                (the really bad news)
                        He suffered extensive contusions
                        to the brain.  We're still trying
                        to relieve some of the swelling
                        but he hasn't regained
                          consciousness.  Unfortunately
                        with the severity of his injuries
                        its likely he never will.

          is tighter, more from Sarah's perspective.)  She takes

          Vera and Sarah.

                                (then to Vera)
                        If he does not regain consciousness
                        You may be asked to --

                                        VERA
                                (she knows where he's
                                going with that line)
                        -- No!  No matter what -- I want
                        you to do everything.  Everything
                        to keep my boy alive. 

                                        DR. MCDOUGALL
                        You don't have to decide right
                        now.  You need to consider the
                        quality of life in his condition --

                                        PURDY
                        Mrs. Smith has made up her mind. 
                        If there's even the smallest
                          possibility that Johnny will pull
                          through, you have to take every
                        measure to keep him alive.

          Sarah slowly sits down, a state of shock gripping her as
          she begins to realize her life, and Johnny's, will never
          be the same.


    31E31EVISION - SARAH AND JOHNNY - SURGERY PREP ROOM

          (Again a closer version of Sc. 22) As the orderlies prepare
          to wheel Johnny into surgery, he keeps trying to speak to
          Sarah, and she leans in close to hear the last words he
          will say for six years.

                                        JOHNNY
                        ...tell the man... I'm just a
                        school teacher...

          And then Sarah tells Johnny the last words he'll hear for
          six years...

                                        SARAH
                        I'll always love you Johnny.

          Johnny-2004 watches as Sarah is pried away from Johnny
          95, a doctor gently keeping her from following as Johnny
          is wheeled into surgery.

          As Sarah is taken out one direction, and Johnny 95 is
          taken out the other, Johnny-2004 finds himself alone in
          the prep room.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: COLLISION - ACT TWO - 5/12/04 - BLUE-3    27B.

          Behind him something moves.  Johnny turns around to see:


3232A DOORWAY

          Blue light arcing from some unseen source inside the room. 
          Johnny walks toward the light, not sure what he'll find
          inside the room.  As he reaches the threshold of the room
          the blue light illuminates his face and he reacts with a
          mixture of awe and horror to what he sees --

          JOHNNY'S POV: POST OP RECOVERY ROOM

          Johnny-1995 lies near death, his battered head held
          together by bandages, a tangle of tubes and wires helping
          him cling to life. 

          Next to his bed stands Katy, looking impassively at Johnny-
          1995 as a cascade of 10,000 volt blue sparks shower the
          room.

          As Johnny-2004 watches, the sparks suddenly touch off an
          explosion, the room suddenly replaced by a WALL OF FIRE
          that surrounds Johnny-2004 as the VISION ENDS.



          Johnny pulls his hand off of Sarah; he's back in the
          waiting room.  He looks at Sarah; looks at Rebecca; then
          looks --


          AT HIS REFLECTION

          In a glass window; Johnny's face is deeply scarred with
            third-degree burns.


          BACK TO SCENE

          Johnny backs up, horrified; he puts his hands to his face;
          then he looks again --

          IN THE REFLECTION

          He's fine now; no burns at all.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny --

          He's disoriented and blacks out for a second.  Johnny
          leans on Rebecca and Sarah for support.  Off Johnny's
          stunned look...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                        END OF ACT TWO          DEAD ZONE: COLLISION - ACT THREE - 5/12/04 - BLUE-3   29.


                                            ACT THREE

          FADE IN:


          Johnny leans on Rebecca as she steers him to a chair in
          the waiting room.  Sarah notices the gesture; she may
          realize there's more between Johnny and Rebecca than even
          they know.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, what happened?  Are you
                        okay?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I saw an explosion.  I was burned. 
                        My face...

          Rebecca touches his face.  Sarah notices.

                                        REBECCA
                        Are you in pain now?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No. The pain fades with the vision.

                                        SARAH
                        Johnny, you've got to be careful. 
                        You can't keep doing this to
                          yourself.

                                        REBECCA
                        You're getting worse with every*
                        vision.

          Rick notices Johnny's distress; rushes across the room --

                                        RICK
                        Hey, Mr. Smith -- you okay?

                        to be found near a downed power
                        line.  That's where the fire will*
                        start.

                                        RICK
                        Okay.  You got it.*

          Rick steps back and pulls out his emergency radio to make
          the call.  As Rebecca comforts Johnny, he turns his
            attention to Sarah --

                                        JOHNNY
                        I keep seeing myself on the night*
                        of my accident, but I also see*
                        myself burnt.*

                        crawled out of the car before it*
                          exploded.  It doesn't make sense.*

                        But what does this have to do*
                        with Katie?*

                                        JOHNNY*
                        I saw Katie in my hospital room. *
                        There were sparks.  She looked at*
                        me, and then the room exploded. *
                        There has to be a connection*
                        between me and Katie.  I must be*
                        missing something.  Okay... in my*
                        vision, the last thing I said to*
                        you was '...there was a man, he*
                        saved me.'*

                                        SARAH
                        Yes.  Yes, I remember that now.*

                        Do you know what I meant?

                        No.  I don't know.  You were so*
                        out of it, Johnny.  I guess I*
                        just thought you were talking
                        about a Paramedic.*

                                        JOHNNY
                        Did anyone talk to me after you?

                                        SARAH
                        No.  You went straight to surgery. *

          Johnny stands, a plan of action beginning to form.  He

          Johnny and Rebecca ride in the back of the rescue vehicle,
          where paramedics or patients would ordinarily be.  It's
          pretty bumpy.  Rebecca studies Johnny, who is lost in
          thought, a worried expression on his face.

          Johnny, holding his head, blacks out momentarily, Rebecca
          catching him before he tips over.

                                        REBECCA
                        Hey -- Johnny, you okay?

          Johnny shakes off the vision, pulling himself together.

                                        REBECCA
                        You're bleeding.

          Johnny winces, in severe pain; a rivulet of blood trickles
          down from Johnny's eardrum onto his neck; just like a
          head trauma patient.  Rebecca finds a tissue and wipes
          off the blood.

                                        JOHNNY
                        My head feels like it's going to
                          explode.

                                        REBECCA
                        I'm worried about you.  Every
                        time you have a vision of that
                        night, it's taking more out of
                        you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I have to keep going.  I have to.

                                        REBECCA
                          Johnny... I know how you must
                        feel.  You can't lose this little
                        girl.  You feel like you're the
                        only one who can save her.  Just
                        like you felt you could save
                        Rachel. 

          This lands with Johnny.  He knows she's right.  But it
          doesn't matter.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I should have saved her...

                                        REBECCA
                        You think you're alone in that
                          feeling?  You think a day goes by
                        that I don't beat myself up because
                          I wasn't there for her?  But the
                        truth is, despite your abilities,
                        you're just one man.  Maybe it's
                        not your visions causing these
                          symptoms, maybe it's this burden
                        you carry around with you.  This
                          enormous responsibility you've
                        taken on.  You can't save everyone
                        Johnny.

          Johnny dials his cell phone.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I know... but I still have to
                        try.

                        I'll get that out to everybody
                        right away.  But listen, Johnny,
                        I just got off the phone with
                        Sarah.  She's very worried about
                        you.  So am I.

                        I'll be okay.  I've got Rebecca
                        looking out for me, and my own
                        private E.M.T.

                        I want you to turn around and get
                        back to the hospital.  Let Doctor
                        Gibson run some more tests.  We
                        can't afford to lose you.  I've
                        got every available resource in

                        Thanks Walt, but it's not just
                        about Katy.  I have to find out
                        what happened that night for

          Johnny-1995 behind the wheel, the rain pounding the
          windshield.

                        That night... I'm in my car...
                        It's raining... I don't want to
                        be here again...



          Johnny driving as Rebecca's voice leads him toward his
          appointment with destiny.

                                        REBECCA (O.S.)
                        Johnny.  I know this is hard. 
                        But you've got to keep driving. 
                        You can't stop.

          He looks into approaching headlights...

            JOHNNY-2004'S POV - IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR

          Katy, revealed in the cold blue light, sitting in the
          backseat of the Caddy.



          Turns back to see Katy looking straight ahead, both of
          them hurtling toward oblivion.

                                          JOHNNY-2004
                        Why didn't I go slower -- or take
                          a different route... WHY DIDN'T I
                        STAY WITH SARAH...

                        It's okay.  I'm with you, Johnny. 



          The headlights of the truck flood through the windshield
          of the Caddy, Johnny accepting his fate as we hear the
          TRUCK HORN and the SOUND OF THE IMPACT...


    55A55AMOMENT AFTER IMPACT - ULTRA SLOW MOTION

          Johnny's world explodes in a hyper-realistic expansion of
          the moment of impact.  Johnny pitches forward, three inches
          that seem like forever, a human crash test dummy as the
          car tumbles and disintegrates around him.  It's horrific
          and beautiful.
