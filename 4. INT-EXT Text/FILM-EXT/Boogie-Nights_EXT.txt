KURT LONGJOHN
-- 'cause I'm just trying to give each

shoot tomorrow, we could send Rocky down

so -- hey -- what the fuck? It's only the

JACK
I've seen you push thirteen inches, you'd be
lucky if you could manage six today -- all the coke
you got in you. You're not ready to fuck,
your dick's not getting hard today, kid.
DIRK
DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT ME LIKE THAT, JACK.

over his nose, hides his embarrassment;
DIRK
FUCK THIS, FUCK THIS, FUCK YOU.
FUCK ALL OF YOU. YOU'RE NOT MY BOSSES.
