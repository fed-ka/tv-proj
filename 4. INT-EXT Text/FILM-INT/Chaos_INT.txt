A loft apartment, scarcely furnished, except for BOOKS,
HUNDREDS OF THEM, fill stacks of shelves. Hearing but not
watching the television, METICULOUSLY preparing a GIN AND
TONIC, is...
DETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His
charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much
trouble as it gets him out of. At present a somber mood.
The shadows from the rain stream down Conners's face.
IN THE GLASS'S REFLECTION... The TV Report plays. (NOTE:
most of, if not all, of the TV report will in reflection.)
KAREN CROSS (OS)
After a two month investigation, Det.
Jason York has been relieved of duty
for his role in the Pearl Street Bridge
shooting deaths of Lisa ReAnn and John
Curtis. Key testimony against York
came from Det. Bernard Callo, who was
on scene that night. The Seattle
Police Department is handing this case
over to the King County District
Attorney's office. Criminal charges
are expected.

The IMAGE cuts to an earlier interview with... CAPTAIN
MARTIN JENKINS, 50's, chronically tired and unsympathetic.
JENKINS
In a civilized society, the men and
women entrusted with serving and
protecting the community are to be held
accountable just like everyone else.
Simply put... Just because you are a
cop, doesn't mean laws don't apply to
you. This is no longer the wild, wild
west.

RINGS OUT!
LOREN
Drop to the floor! Slowly! No sudden

(to the Tellers)
You! Hands on heads, drop to your

PATRONS and TELLERS HIT THE GROUND, TERRIFIED!
Lorenz is in
COMPLETE and UTTER CONTROL.
BLACK CLAD #4 and #3 keep watch on the tellers behind the
counters! One on one side, one on the other.
BLACK CLAD #2 ushers people out of side offices, gun-points
them into the lobby!
BLACK CLAD #1 races upstairs, gathers people from the 2nd
level, forces them downstairs.
From the corner of Lorenz's eye...
The SECURITY GUARD's hand
creeps toward his gun.
LORENZ
That... you don't want to do.
The Security Guard reluctantly obeys. BLACK CLAD #1 DISARMS
the Guard, then GUN BUTTS HIM over the head! The Guard
drops, unconscious! CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES scream out.
Black Clad #1 rips keys from the Guard's belt, tosses them to

HEATHER "TEDDY" GALLOWAY, 30's, normally a force to reckon

her.
JENKINS
Have you seen my watch?
Teddy gestures to the night stand. Jenkins retrieves the
watch. He also slides his WEDDING RING back on. This ain't
love, this is a relationship of convenience.
Jenkins slips on his jacket, secures his tie and, after one
last check in the mirror...
JENKINS
This was fun. You should get out of
bed. You'll be late for work.
And with that, Jenkins exits. Teddy waits for the door to

BLACK CLAD #4 turns just in time to see it, quickly FIRES his

Lorenz hustles over to Black Clad #4.
LORENZ
What do you think you're doing?
BLACK CLAD #4
Fucker pushed the alarm.
Lorenz GLARES DISGUSTEDLY at his accomplice.
LORENZ
It would've made more sense to shoot
him before he pushes the fucking alarm.
Not after.

Lorenz levels, very calmly, his weapon at the Eager Teller's
head and...
LORENZ

Do it right.
The Eager's Teller's body keels over, dead.

Conners crosses, opens the door for Jenkins and DETECTIVE

I need to speak to you, Quentin.
CONNERS
There's where your shit out of luck

JENKINS
It's important.
Conners and Jenkins trade serious stares. Conners finally
relents. Jenkins and Dekker enter. Dekker notices - THE

JENKINS
Quentin, this is Detective Shane Dekker.
CONNERS
Huh? You don't look like much of a

DEKKER
Funny. I was going to say the same

JENKINS
Shane just transferred in from Tacoma.

Save your breath. I really don't care.
Before Jenkins can respond, from the bedroom, a TALL, BLOND

The men WATCH as the Woman, PAYING THEM NO ATTENTION,
retrieves a bottle of water from the fridge, then returns to
the bedroom. No words spoken at all. After the moment has

You may want to put a leash on him.

Saying I did want to help... I'm still

I won't, however, unleash you alone.
CONNERS
Always a catch.

Shane, here, is your new partner.
Consider him a younger version of me,

The idea of a new partner doesn't sit well with Conners.

Don't think I endorse this. If it were

Wasting our time.
Time. The word rings in Conners's head.
He starts to put it
together.
CONNERS
Precisely. He knows police protocol,
not to mention the shit in our own
precinct. He's disguising his voice,
means he's got a record and has done
this before. He's heavily armed and
well-connected. He knows he's
surrounded. He hasn't asked for a
damned thing. He drops that hint about
sunrise, prepping us for a long wait.
He's buying time. Why?
VINCENT
(brainstorming)
To figure out his next move.
He wasn't
expecting us.
DEKKER
No, he wasn't expecting you. He said,

Probably thought it would take the

CONNERS

The hostages are in imminent danger.
They've confessed to killing someone, an
automatic murder one charge - that's a

risk. We need to go in. Now.

"Don't FUCK with me" attitude.
SWAT COMMANDER
I got snipers up top and ten soldiers

CONNERS
What's the best way in?
SWAT COMMANDER
Tear gas, blow the doors...
CONNERS
Hold on. No explosives. I got forty

SWAT COMMANDER
There's no pussy way in. The doors are
locked electronically from the inside.
We ain't getting in without force.

What if we cut the power? That will

We don't keep records. The boxes are

You're a College boy. Which one?

DEKKER

CONNERS
Not exactly Princeton, but not bad.
How did you end up on the force?
DEKKER
It's kind of the family business.
CONNERS
Family business? What, your Dad, Dad's

Dekker squirms when it comes to revealing personal info.
DEKKER

CONNERS
You don't say that with much

DEKKER
Not much to be enthusiastic about.
Conners reaches his limit.
Time to put him in place.
CONNERS
Listen, my reputation often proceeds me.
You, however, have no reputation; a fact I
need to deal with. After you've been
through the shit I have, then you can judge
me. Now... we can try to work together,

Conners, come in?
Both men hold steely stares on one another.

Conners drops a TEN DOLLAR BILL on the table.
CONNERS
Lastly... I don't like the Pac-10.

Conners gets up, heads for the door.

Detective... I didn't realize when we

You, on the other hand... I gotta bike
myself. Maybe we can go for a ride
sometime? Or maybe I can just ride

Conners looks at both of them.

She opens a LARGE DUFFEL BAG. Conners and Dekker look inside

DEKKER
Must be a fifty large there easy.
His

MARNIE
You'd think, right?
DEKKER
It's not?
MARNIE
Don't put words in my mouth, but...
Two things jump out here. First, each
bank branch has their own money bands.
This is not American National's. After
a little checking, it belongs to
Pacific Savings of Seattle.
DEKKER
That sounds familiar.
MARNIE
It should. Four months ago, a half
million dollars was stolen in an armed
robbery there. Just a smash-n-grab
job. They caught the guys a day later,
recovering about $400,000. Those guys
have been in lock up since and their
trial's still pending. Which leads us
to point number two. Do you smell
that?
DEKKER
(smells the bills; grimaces)
What is it?
MARNIE
When evidence is taken in, any physical
contact might affect the ability to
lift prints, so, to mark it, we now
spray a scented solution directly on
the bill.
CONNERS
Is that new?
MARNIE
Wave of the future.
Gotta keep up with
the times, Conners.

Conners paces around her like a CIRCLING SHARK. Dekker's in
the corner, observing.
CONNERS
We found the money.
GINA
That money was Dwayne's...
CONNERS
That money came from our evidence room.
GINA
I told you. I don't know nothing about
a bank robbery. Whatever Damon was
into, I didn't know!
CONNERS
So, where were you going?
GINA
Vacation.
CONNERS
This isn't possession or solicitation,
Gina. This is felony-murder one. You
could get life.
GINA
Me!?
I didn't do nothing!
SHOOTING SCRIPT

CONNERS
(frustrated)
It's "I didn't do anything." "Didn't
do nothing" is a double negative,
infers the positive. The grammar in
this country sucks.
GINA
Then I didn't do ANY-thing!
Conners takes a seat next to Gina.
His EYES BURN through
her.
CONNERS
This isn't going away. You want to
walk out of here, you tell me
something... now.
GINA
I swear I don't know. Now I'm done
talking. I want a lawyer.
Dekker lowers his head.
Disappointed.
CONNERS
You sure that's what you want?
GINA
Yeah.
CONNERS
Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll
make. The first will be to the public
defender's office. The second to
children's services.
GINA

Suddenly Gina's bravado disappears.
Suddenly a scared and
lonely girl.
CONNERS
It's simple... if you insist on a

Conners and Dekker scribble their signatures down.

A PIANO PLAYER recreates the sweet sounds of Italy.

Vincent and Teddy have joined Conners and Dekker. A MOUNTAIN
OF FOOD still remains. A COUPLE BOTTLES OF WINE have been
consumed, empty plates and basket rolls spread about. The
mood is happy, light. Not thinking about their day.
Conners tells an anecdote, something that Teddy and Vincent
have heard before, but don't care. Dekker watches the
Detectives, admires in their closeness.
CONNERS
Shane, what was that thing you said
back at the house about "returning to
the beginning path" or something?
DEKKER
It's a Buddhist story.
CONNERS
We're all ears.
DEKKER
One day the Buddha found his heart in
turmoil. So he retreats to the forest,
to the earth, to the base of a great
tree and, I'm paraphrasing, but... this
elephant comes up and tells Buddha he
doesn't like seeing him discouraged.
TEDDY
He can talk to an elephant?
DEKKER
He's the Buddha. He's attained the 6th

The Buddha was troubled so he went back

you hit a dead end, go back to the

something like that.
CONNERS
We have a genuine philosopher in our

VINCENT
You're a Buddhist?
DEKKER
No. Just something I picked up along

TEDDY
But you're religious?
DEKKER
Not particularly.
Conners stares curiously at his new partner.
Then excuses
himself to go to the men's room.
DEKKER
You're all pretty tight.
TEDDY
We've been through a lot together.
DEKKER
I guess I just thought... I don't

in lately, coming back from suspension,
everyone would treat him differently.
VINCENT
You can't believe what you read or see

Even when things got pretty wild today

Conners drives, Dekker reads Chris Lei's file. On top of the

Chinese-American with a "weasel factor" off the charts.
CONNERS
Prick used to work for some big-time
software company until they caught him
dipping into the company's slush fund.
They didn't want the publicity so they
didn't press charges. Couple years
later, he was busted for looting the
pension plans of retired cops. For a
genius... he's a fucking moron.
DEKKER
This was your case. You and York. You
made the bust. Why didn't it stick?
CONNERS
His lawyer put us on trial. Said we
were crooked, abusive, that we planted
evidence... We were in the midst of
the Pearl Street Bridge fallout. Jury
bought it. They let him walk and we
were the scapegoats.
DEKKER
Was it true?

Morphine. Without this stuff, I

Dekker fills a syringe with the entire bottle.

Dekker sticks the syringe needle tip into the IV bag.
DEKKER
If I were to inject this whole thing...
That would be all she wrote for Damon.
RICHARDS
You don't have the balls.
Dekker PRESSES down on the syringe, just a little, but enough
to go into the bag. Richards can't believe it.
DEKKER
This equipment malfunctions all the

Besides, I don't think the DA's going

DAX
I know what they were doing inside the
bank.
DEKKER AND DAX--
Dax flips through the huge document.
DAX
These are today's transaction records
from the bank. An average day produces
about 400 pages, give or take. Today,
there were over 3,000 pages.
DEKKER
Meaning?
DAX
We've just witnessed the largest heist
in history. Somewhere in the
neighborhood of a billion dollars.
DEKKER
Come again?
DAX
It's a computer virus. "The Computer
Virus." It randomly withdraws money
from all the accounts and deposits it
into the bad guys' account. If you
check the transactions, no two
withdrawal amounts are the same and
none of'em are over $100. Most
security systems work on the size of
the money, not number of transactions.
Wire out one million from a handful of
accounts and red flags go up. Wire out
a less than a hundred from ten million
accounts, no flags.
DEKKER
Where's the money now?
DAX
I tried following one of the
transactions. It took me an hour and
when I finally had it... It went away.
DEKKER
How is that possible?

The virus created a host of phantom
accounts where the money goes

temporarily, then transfers to another
account, then to another. It's never

accurate fix.
DEKKER
It's still moving the money around?
DAX
Yeah. Any deposit or withdrawal from
any bank doesn't usually go into affect
until the next business day. So it's
going to keep jumping around until it
clears at 9 AM tomorrow.
DEKKER
(realizes)
Or 6 AM Pacific time. Sunrise. So why
break in? If they're just wiring
money? Couldn't they do that from
anywhere?
DAX
That's the regional manager's computer
terminal. There's no outside/remote
access to it. There you have unlimited
entry to the bank's mainframe. No
passwords to work around, no "hacking"
in. It's all nice and clean.
DEKKER
A billion dollars is missing and we're
only discovering this now?
DAX
Ironically, when the power went out, it
helped hide the virus and bought it
time to work.

So they weren't trying to make
it look
like they were robbing a bank,

TEDDY
We used to spend all day
Sunday just
reading in bed. I would
read the paper
and he would read one of
his billion
books. I didn't deserve
him. I knew
that. But I still loved
him.
Teddy stares out the window...
POV OF TEDDY - Jenkins speaks to Karen Cross.
TEDDY
He's the only man I ever loved.
(beat)
Did we all get shot today?
They can't help but laugh.
DEKKER
They said in the city I'd be busy.
Every day like this?
TEDDY
Pretty much.
DEKKER
Great.
I wonder what's next?
TEDDY
For me...
a long vacation.
Teddy excuses herself to the bathroom.
Dekker goes to pay
the check.
AT THE CASHIER...
Dekker reaches for his wallet, opens it.
DEKKER
How much?
PRETTY WAITRESS
Do you think I'm going to charge you
after all that? Go on.
DEKKER
Thanks.
Dekker notices the tip jar by the register. He removes a TEN
DOLLAR BILL, about to stuff it in the jar...
That's when THE SMELL hits him. A strange, but familiar ODOR
comes from Dekker's wallet or more accurately... The TEN
DOLLAR BILL! But what is it?

Marnie explains to Dekker and Conners...
MARNIE
Do you smell that?
DEKKER
(smells the bills; grimaces)
What is it?
MARNIE
When evidence is taken in, any physical
mark might effect the ability to lift
prints, so, to mark it, we spray it
with a scented solution.
Off of Conners' LOOK.

LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT

PAPERS and BOOKS litter the floor.
Dekker trashes the place, looking for a clue of any kind. He
rifles through the bookshelves, cabinets. All to no avail.
That's when he finds... a medium-sized paperback, dog-eared
and worn. The title of the book... "CHAOS" by James Gleick.
Dekker flips through the book. Pages are marked, high-
lighted. Key words we find include, "EDWARD LORENZ, CHAOS
THEORY, BIRTH OF A NEW SCIENCE."

Dekker holds the "Chaos" book in his hand, paces...
DEKKER
(into phone)
You tried them all?/ Nothing for
Conners or Lorenz?/ I don't know.
No,
maybe he's not on a flight.
Dekker then notices - the book.
The author's name.
DEKKER
Try again.
But try Gleick.

Dekker scans the line up of people.
Nothing.
BY THE MEN'S ROOM--
A MAN, 40's, in DISGUISE (Brown Wig), SPIES Dekker.
He picks
up a CELLPHONE, DIALS... DEKKER'S CELLPHONE RINGS.
He
quickly picks it up.
CONNERS (VO)
There's a passage in the Surangama
Sutra which, roughly translated means:
"Things are not what they appear to be:
nor are they otherwise."

DEKKER
Conners?
Dekker again scans the line -- he's not there.
He scans all
the faces AGAIN, but still nothing.
CONNERS (VO)
Think about that a minute... Doesn't
that blow your mind?
(beat)
What gave me away?
DEKKER
Ten bucks.
CONNERS (VO)
At the diner. That's right...
Well,
to err is human.
Dekker SPOTS A MAN ON A CELLPHONE, he runs up to him, SPINS
HIM AROUND, BUT... It's not Conners.
CONNERS (VO)
Was it Harry that gave him up?
DEKKER
Harry and the phone call. He called
me, said Callo was insignificant.
Threw up a red flag.
CONNERS (VO)
That wasn't him. That was my mistake.
I called you.

CONNERS (VO)
York always thought "the plan" was
flawless. He was cocky. I told him
you have to leave room for error. You
can't always predict how it's all going
to play out. A random camera catches
an image of Richards, the scent on the
money... you. You were the biggest
wrench of the day. The Chaos Theory...
When you got that... I was impressed.
DEKKER
All day long, we were trying to find
out who the inside source was... it
was you.
CONNERS
The more information you gather, from
as many sources as possible, no matter
how unpleasant the methods are, the
better. And while I'd like to take
sole credit it was a team effort.
DEKKER

Teddy's pretty devastated about your
death.
CONNERS (VO)
She'll get over it.

Conners leans over Galt, a giant GASH across his head, feels

SEES THE FIRE!
Conners gets up, and reaches INTO THE BATHTUB, drags out... a
CORPSE, HOOKS HIS BADGE ONTO THE CORPSE'S BELT and lays him
on the floor.
Conners QUICKLY opens a LAUNDRY SHOOT, SHIMMIES INSIDE AND

DEKKER
So the corpse in the morgue with your
name on its toe...?
CONNERS (VO)
Scott Curtis won't be bothering anyone
again.
DEKKER
You're a serial killer.
CONNERS (VO)
Who got killed? Curtis? Harrington,
Galt, Lei. They're all hoods. The
world's safer with them gone. The kid
at the bank... that was unfortunate.
But... you live with your decisions.
You choose to take this road... there
is no half way. It's all or nothing.
That's why others fail. They don't
make the commitment. I won't make that
same mistake.
DEKKER
You said they were all hoods...
what
about, Callo?
CONNERS
Callo deserved his fate.
It's his fault.
DEKKER
This is Callo's fault?
CONNERS
If it weren't for him, York and I
would've never done this. One random
act, causes another, causes another,
and in the end... the pattern emerges.
That's the Chaos Theory.

Feds will be tracing false leads for

DEKKER
Lei... you tanked his trial on purpose.
CONNERS
They should've suspended me after I
testified. What did they expect?
DEKKER
And because the "bitch that made her
career off you" worked for Channel Two,
that's why American National was the
target.
CONNERS
Everybody who screwed us, got screwed.
Everything in its right place.
DEKKER
Why not kill me? You had plenty of
opportunities.
CONNERS
This wasn't about killing, Shane. This
was about standing up for what matters.
Besides... you kinda grew on me.
DEKKER
You're not going to get away.
CONNERS (VO)
I already have. I'm not even here now.
This is a very valuable lesson for you
to learn, and it's good to have learned
it early.
DEKKER
What's that?
CONNERS (VO)
You don't always win.
DEKKER
All your years of service for not.
You're a hypocrite.
