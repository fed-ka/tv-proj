      BLACK BOX OPENING:

      51 - Robberies 

      9 - Cloned Cell Phones 

      2 - Frienemies 

      1 - Deep Current

      INT.  SOUTHWESTERN HIGH SCHOOL - COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT11

      A high-end LAPTOP COMPUTER on a desk in the dark.  A 
       Southwestern Charter High  screensaver bounces across the 
      screen.

      BEYOND -- LAPTOPS in standby or screensaver mode. Cabled to 
      desks and tables.  A brand new and well-funded computer lab.

      SOUND of a lock breaking.  Metal on metal.  A door knob HITS 
      the floor. SNEAKERS scuffle in.  Loud WHISPERS.  A CABLE-
      CUTTER in gloved hands. SNAP.  A laptop is yanked from its 
      cords.  Another and another.  Stuffed into backpacks. 

      CLACK.  Sudden, bright, blinding LIGHT.  Like someone turned 
      on the sun.  Beaming straight into our eyes.

      FIVE TEEN BOYS (Latino, black, white) scurry to escape. DARK 
      FIGURES behind the light.  A megaphone VOICE booms --.

                                  VOICE
                    GET ON THE GROUND.  DO NOT MOVE.

      But the ROBBERS scramble to get out of the room.

      INT.  SOUTHWESTERN HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS22

      The ROBBERS escape into a dark corridor, met by BOOMING 
      EXPLOSIONS.  Flash-bangs.  Light, smoke.  They flee around a 
      corner, run into more EXPLOSIONS. They run for an OPEN DOOR. 

      INT.  SOUTHWESTERN HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - CONTINUOUS33

      The ROBBERS scurry into a vast dark space, hear the DOOR SLAM 
      behind them.  They realize too late they ve been trapped. 

      More BRIGHT LIGHTS in their eyes. Again an amplified VOICE:



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     2. 

      CONTINUED:33

                                  VOICE
                    GET ON THE FLOOR.  NOW.

      The ROBBERS reluctantly fall to the floor.

                                  VOICE (cont d)
                    HANDS ABOVE YOUR HEADS.

      The Robbers comply -- quickly DARK FIGURES move among them 
      and zip their hands and feet into plastic restraints. DUCT 
      TAPE is applied to their mouths.  ROBBER #1 cranes his head -- 
      catches a glimpse of a T-Shirt with a symbol: a circle with 
      an arrow pointing up. 

                                  ROBBER #1
                          (angry/scared)
                    You ain t cops!

      The figure in the T-shirt (CLAYTON CASWELL) answers.  

                                    VOICE/CLAYTON
                    No.  We re not cops.

                                  ROBBER #1
                    What the hell you doing?

      Clayton bends down to speak into his ear.

                                    VOICE/CLAYTON
                      Protecting the innocent.  Punishing 
                    the guilty.

      The Robbers are terrified, expecting the worst. But the DARK 
      FIGURES leave. Lights go OFF, doors slam -- locks CLACK.

      INT.  SOUTHWESTERN HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY/GYM - DAY44

      DON walks with DAVID into the gymnasium. ROBBERS still on the 
      floor, tape and restraints removed. LAPD OFFICERS stand over 
      them. A Crime Scene TECH takes a photo of a SPRAY-PAINTED 
      MESSAGE:  Crime Prevention By Vanguard.  A painted version of 
      the symbol seen on the T-shirt: circle with the arrow.

                                  DAVID
                    Now this -- I haven t seen before.

      NIKKI steps away from an LAPD officer to meet Don.

                                  DON
                    What s up?  Your friends at LAPD 
                    need help with a simple B and E?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     3. 

      CONTINUED:44

                                  NIKKI
                    B and Es they can handle just fine.  
                    But they do need help tracking down 
                    a group of vigilantes.

                                  DAVID
                      Vigilantes -- that explains the 
                    message on the wall. 

                                  NIKKI
                    Fifth incident in two months.  Similar 
                      situations, same M.O., same type of 
                    victims.  

                                  DON
                          (re: the robbers)
                    The victims are burglars. 

                                  NIKKI
                    Yeah, got seven -- subjects -- ages 
                    of 16 to 19.  White, Latino, black.  
                    No gang affiliations, found with 
                    crowbars, lock-knockers, cable 
                    cutters. Backpacks full of school 
                    computer equipment.

                                  DAVID
                    Wrapped up like Christmas presents 
                    for the police.

                                  NIKKI
                    The vigilantes ambushed them. High-
                    powered lights.  Improvised flash-
                    bangs.  Plastic restraints.  

                                  DON
                    What about this  Vanguard?   That 
                    come up in any of our data bases?

                                  NIKKI
                    Nada.

                                  DON
                      Forensics?

                                  NIKKI
                    Just this --

      Nikki holds out an evidence bag.  Inside, a state-of-the-art 
      SMART PHONE.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     4.

                                  NIKKI (cont d)
                    Found on the floor in here.

                                  DAVID
                    Maybe one of the vigilantes  -- or 
                    robbers ?

                                  DON
                    Or a student s.

      David peers at the phone -- then over at the ROBBERS.

                                  DAVID
                    If they can t tell us anything, 
                    this might. 

      INT.  FBI - TECH ROOM - DAY55

      FBI TECH MATT LI examines the insides of the SMART PHONE.

                                  MATT
                    Someone scraped out the MIN and the ESN.

                                  COLBY
                      Translation.

                                  MATT
                    The MIN is the phone number, the ESN 
                    is the electronic serial number.

                                  COLBY
                    So this wasn t dropped on the floor 
                    by a student.

                                  MATT
                    Getting rid of the phone number is 
                    easy.  Getting rid of the ESN -- is 
                    supposed to be impossible.

                                  COLBY
                    Better put a call into the FBI s 
                    favorite mathematician.

      INT.  FBI - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY66

      David stands over TWO ROBBERS.

                                  DAVID
                    You guys know math?  You can add 
                    right?  Add up the cost of the 
                    equipment you were trying to steal, 
                    it s grand larceny.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     5.

                                  ROBBER #1
                    First offense.  We won t do time.

                                  DAVID
                    Oh yeah?  Who told you that?

      No response.
                                  DAVID (cont d)
                    I m looking at you guys, I don t 
                    see masterminds.  But you knew 
                    where the computers were, you knew 
                    how to get past the alarm.  I m 
                    thinking someone helped you out. 

      Robber #2 gives him a quick furtive glance.

                                  ROBBER #1
                    Keep your mouth shut.

                          (to Robber #2)
                    Maybe you and I should have a talk.

                                  ROBBER #1
                    You know what ll happen. 

      Both kids stare at each other.  Both very scared.

                                  ROBBER #2
                          (to David)
                    I don t know nothing.

                    Third round with these guys.  Never 
                    figured the FBI couldn t get a

      INT.  CALSCI - AMITA S OFFICE - DAY88

      CLOSE ON SMART PHONE:  AMITA locates the SIM CHIP inside.  
      CHARLIE and Colby watch.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     6.

                       Cold-boot attack?  

                                    CHARLIE
                    It s also known as a  cold ghosting 
                    attack  or  iceman attack.   

                                  AMITA
                    When I shut off this phone and remove 
                    the memory chip, all the data stored 
                    on it will be lost instantly.

      Amita turns off the phone -- grabs a can of COMPRESSED AIR, 
      holds it upside down and sprays the CHIP. 

                                  AMITA (cont d)
                    But if I cool the chip first, like this, 
                    the data remains readable -- sometimes 
                    for as long as several minutes. 

      Amita extracts the SIM card with a pair of tweezers -- then 
      quickly inserts the SIM card into a CARD READER that is 
      connected to her COMPUTER.  The PHONE DATA jumps on screen. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    You got it.

      Charlie scans the data for the MIN number.

                    Wow.  That actually worked.

                                  AMITA
                    Of course.

      Charlie writes the MIN number on a post-it.

                    Have the FBI match that number with

      INT./EXT.  VALLEY STRIP MALL - DRY CLEANERS - DAY99

      A CUSTOMER leaves. A YOUNG CHINESE MAN at the counter.  He s 
      distracted by movement outside, catches sight of a GUN.  He 
      reaches beneath the counter, pulls up a bat -- just as David 
      and Nikki burst in with TWO FBI OFFICERS.  David takes a 
      quick bead on him.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     7.

      An OFFICER grabs the Man s wallet and hands it to David.

                    Where s Bai Lan?  Where is he?

                    He?  You don t know what you re

      Nikki steps forward.  Puts the Smart Phone on the counter.

                    We know Bai Lan owns this phone.

      A look of relief on the Man s face.

      Just beyond a pile of laundry, an elderly Chinese lady rises.

      EXT.  LOADING DOCK - NIGHT1010

      Don arrives at an LAPD CRIME SCENE.  A DELIVERY TRUCK at the 
      dock.  Boxes scattered.  A BLOODY BODY.  Colby approaches.  

                                  COLBY
                    Truck s stolen -- a crew was unloading

                    driver said it was a bunch of kids.  

      Colby nods toward the BODY, they go to it. WHITE MALE, early 
      20s.  Black jeans, black shoes, a hoody over a black T-shirt.  
      On the T-shirt -- a CIRCLE with an ARROW pointing up.

                                  DON
                    One of the vigilantes.

      A Grad Student, ROBERT SANTOS, comes out of a door with other 
      students -- Nikki steps in front of him.

                    Robert Santos.

                    I want to talk to you about your

                    Like I told the police, I didn t 
                    know him very well. 

                                  NIKKI
                    Though you shared a room with him 
                    for nearly a year?

                                  SANTOS
                    We didn t hang out.

                                  SANTOS
                    He was lonely. You could see it.  
                    Sometimes he tried to talk to me 
                    about stuff, his classes, something 
                    he was reading. But -- I m so busy

                    starting about three months ago, he 
                    went out a lot.

                                  NIKKI
                    He indicate where?  Maybe mention a

                                  SANTOS
                    Never said a word.  And I never 
                    asked where he was going. 

      He starts to realize how this sounds.

                                  NIKKI
                    What is it?

                    Maybe if I d tried to talk to him a 
                    little, invited him to hang with me 
                    and my friends -- he wouldn t have 
                    gotten mixed up in whatever he was 
                    doing when he died.

      He shakes off the moment.

      MARSHALL PENFIELD in front of a large group of graduate 
      students -- lecturing.  Charlie quietly slips in the back.

                                  MARSHALL
                    From set theory's inception, some  
                    have argued it s a game that 
                    includes elements of fantasy. 
                      Wittgenstein questioned how 
                      Zermelo Fraenkel set theory handled 
                      infinities. Errett Bishop dismissed 
                    it as "God's mathematics, which we 
                    should leave for God to do."

      Marshall spies Charlie in the back.




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     15.

                    These CalSci students really know 
                    how to appreciate an incisive 
                      discussion from a guest lecturer.

                                    CHARLIE
                    How could they resist your charms?

                    It really is impossible, isn t it?  
                    Speaking of which, how s Amita?  
                    You two still dating?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Yeah.

                                  MARSHALL
                    Really?  Good for you, Eppsy.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Marshall.  I m about to ask you 
                    something and if there s any way 
                    possible you can manage not to 
                    launch into your smirky world of

      INT.  FBI - BULLPEN - DAY1818

      Colby and Nikki look over crime scene photos. 

                                  COLBY
                    LAPD responded to an alarm at a 
                    auto sound shop five weeks ago -- 
                    found three teens in restraints, 
                    like at the school. Back then, they 
                    didn t know they had an ongoing

                    So maybe something got overlooked.   

      Something on a photo catches Nikki s attention.

                    Good thinking, Granger.  They did

      Colby turns to see Nikki holding a photo for him to see -- 

      ON THE PHOTO -- on a wall, what looks like gang graffiti.

                    Not immediately.  But it could be a 
                    subset within the superset.

      Charlie drops the PHOTO on his desk near Penfield -- who s 
      lazily leafing through a FBI FILE.

                    I m talking about Set Theory.

                    Say this circle represents objects

                    the robbery crews will strike?  For 
                    this to happen there must be a 
                    hidden set common to both groups.

                    That s where Marshall s Deep

                    specific areas --

      A BARRICADE appears in one area, people go around it, or turn 
      back. Making new patterns through the entire crowd.

                    Hmm?  Sorry, I drifted off in the 
                    midst of your riveting monologue. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    I was stating the problem.

                                  MARSHALL
                    Your approach to the problem. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    Using your method. 

                                  MARSHALL
                    Being as it s my method, shouldn t 
                    I be leading this inquiry?

                                    CHARLIE
                    This isn t a seminar, Marshall. 

                                  NIKKI
                    It s a criminal investigation.

                                  MARSHALL
                          (off Nikki)
                    You carry handcuffs, don t you? 
                    Grrrrrr.

      Nikki s amused this guy s trying that on a cop.

                                  NIKKI
                    Yeah, that ll get you there.

                                  MARSHALL
                    I like the sound of that.

                                  NIKKI
                    Well, don t.

      Marshall glances down, sees the PHOTO. Picks it up. 

                                   MARSHALL
                    Where did you find this?

                                  NIKKI
                    At a business where the vigilantes 
                    caught some thieves.

                                  MARSHALL
                    It s computer code.      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     20.

      Amita works the keyboard as Charlie and Penfield look on. All 
      three intense now.  Nikki watches.

                                  MARSHALL
                    Why would anyone use a few random 
                    computer code symbols?

                                    CHARLIE
                    Unless it s not random.

                                  NIKKI
                          (joking)
                    Yeah, what about that.

                                  MARSHALL
                    You need pages of code to say 
                    anything meaningful.

                                  AMITA
                    What if it s not just computer code 
                    ... but a cipher code?

                                  MARSHALL
                    If it is, could take months to 
                    figure out.

                                  NIKKI
                    They painted this on a wall -- I 
                    doubt they made it hard to crack.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Maybe a simple Vigenere cipher?

                                  MARSHALL
                    With the first 13 alphabet letters 
                    matched to these 13 code symbols --

                                  AMITA
                    And the key word is  Vanguard --

      Amita brings up a Vigenere software program on a second 
      screen -- and it translates the computer code into TEXT.  A

      Amita types, a BROWSER WINDOW opens up in the LCD screen.

      The web page uploads, embedded with large data files.  One 
      file OPENS:  A LIST of warehouses, car dealerships, delivery 
      companies -- each dated and with attached photo files.      

                                  NIKKI
                    Those are robberies stopped by the 
                      vigilantes. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    This is Vanguard s website.
                    They even have the exact time each 
                    robbery was supposed to happen.

                                  NIKKI
                    Look at that last one -- an 
                    appliance warehouse.  Downtown. And 
                    the date.  That s today. 

      A PHOTO FILE suddenly opens.  A CELL PHONE PHOTO: VIC TOONER

      Nikki reacts.

                                  MARSHALL
                    Who is that?

                                  NIKKI
                    That -- is trouble.

      Text under the photo:   Vic Tooner. Cops can t stop him.  We 
      will. 

      She steps aside, gets on her phone. Charlie, Marshall and 
      Amita stare on Tooner s photo.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Vic Tooner.

                    He does not look friendly.

      CAMERA ANGLE SHIFTS as a TRUCK pulls up near the door.  More

      Colby continues to watch through Binoculars as box after box 
      gets loaded into the truck.

                                  COLBY
                    Just the robbers. No sign of

      He motions with his head toward a crowd of onlookers drawn by 
      the SWAT action.

      Oliver goes silent, just meets his look with a calm stare. 

      A POLICE CHOPPER roars overhead. 

      IN A CROWD OF ONLOOKING WORKMEN

      A MAN in the back. He lifts his face -- it s VIC TOONER. 
      Familiar from the PHOTO.  Smiling slightly to himself. 

      He nods, and TWO MEN break away to walk with him. Casual 
      despite all the cops and FBI agents. One pulls his long coat 
      around to better hide the shotgun he s got under it.

                    You re wrong, the structure lacks 
                      originality or integrity.

                                  MARSHALL
                    It s a classic organization, based 
                    on tested and proven elements --

                                    CHARLIE
                    It s a chain, with the

                      maintaining complex matrices --

                                  MARSHALL
                    You propose that a single point 
                    mechanism provides superior output?

                                  LARRY

                    Surely eminent mathematicians can 
                    find ways to calmly discuss theory.

                                    CHARLIE
                    We re not discussing theory.

                    both undergrads working together on

                    So if we look at the supersets that

      People on porches.  A pick-up soccer game with kids.  Colby 
      and David walk.  People make them as cops, hurry away.  The 
      ball goes bounding across the street, the kids follow.  Doors 
      close shut.  Fear on every face.

                    I ve never seen people so scared.

      They pause in front of an old church. A BOY, 10, appears in 
      front of them -- holding a paper tray with two coffees.

                                  BOY
                    Hey, these are for you.

      David and Colby turn to the child. He hands them the cups.

                                  DAVID
                    Thanks -- who are they from?

      They turn, standing casually behind them is Vic Tooner. 
      Totally calm, smiling slightly.  But scary, hard eyes.

      David and Colby stiffen, Colby s close to dropping his coffee 
      to go for his gun -- he resists the impulse.

                    I was thinking that if someone in 
                    Vanguard is that familiar with 
                    computer source code, I should take 
                    a closer look at the browser code 
                    of the website.

                                  MARSHALL
                          (getting it quickly)
                      Programmers often use distinctive 
                      object-oriented symbols, statements 
                    and method calls.

                                  AMITA
                    Exactly.  My comparison analysis 
                    reveals the Vanguard code is 
                    similar to code found in an intra-
                      university astrophysics project.

                                  LARRY 
                    Note that success results not from  
                    the Eppes method nor the Penfield 
                    approach -- but the Ramanujan scan.

                    Amita, can you find the name of the 
                    person who wrote the code?  He 
                    might be the leader of Vanguard.

                    came by to see what s up.

      IN CHARLIE S HAND -- his cellphone. He subtly moves a finger 
      over its face -- PUSHES A BUTTON.

                                  TOONER
                    Yeah, think I remember that one.

      Tooner pretends to scan the shelves.

                    Hello?  Charlie, are you there?

                    all, it s your supercomputer.

      Don reacts, recognizing the voice.  He runs for the door. 
      Alan and Amita watch, startled --

      Charlie and Marshall pretend to look around. Behind them, 
      Tooner checks his watch. Motions to the kids.

      Tooner s voice goes hard.

                    Don t you want to wait around for 
                    your brother?  Professor Eppes?

      Charlie and Marshall realize Tooner s been playing them. 
      Suddenly he steps right up to Charlie --

                    Here s a math problem for you.

                    seen me at crime scenes.  Subtract 
                    the number who ve testified.   

      He gives Charlie a hard look -- then abruptly walks off.

      Sitting at the intersection are a couple cars, stopped to let 
      the emergency vehicles go by. 

      ONE VEHICLE -- a plain sedan, Tooner in the passenger seat. 
      Don s SUV goes by right in front of him. He smiles.

                    Clayton Caswell and Tooner -- they 
                    hate each other.  They want 
                      confrontation. That creates a 
                    classic game-theory scenario --

                                  MARSHALL
                    Right on, Johnny Von Neumann. It s

                    I assume that s one of your game-

      Marshall makes a pretend gun with his finger and thumb. 

      ENTER AUDIENCE VISION -- a stylized practical version of the

                    Imagine a duel between three 
                    people. I m the worst shot, I hit 
                    the target one out of three tries.  
                    One of my opponents --

                                  MARSHALL (cont d)
                    -- is better, hits the target two 
                    out of three shots. The third guy  
                    is a dead shot -- he never misses.  

      He looks to Colby.  Who looks back.

                    Each gets one shot. As the worst, I

      An industrial landscape of 10-story container cranes, cargo 
      ships, trucks and row upon row of stacked cargo containers.   

      A SEDAN appears, pulls up to a stack of containers.  Tooner 
      steps out, looking around as Machine Gun and Shotgun get out 
      as well. Tooner pulls out a cell phone.  Speed dials.

                                  TOONER
                    How does it look?

      He listens, turns to the driver of the car.  The driver 
      flashes the headlights.  A signal.

      From the other direction -- A PICK-UP TRUCK and a SEDAN drive 
      up -- in front and in back of a large BOX TRUCK -- disgorging 
      ARMED MEN.  A young ROBBERY CREW jumps out of the Box Truck.

      TWO CARS come from the sides.  Tooner pulls out a BARCODE 
      LASER READER, walks along the containers.   He finds a

                      Twenty-two hundred cell phones, 
                    eight hundred iPods.

      He smiles at Shotgun and Machine Gun.

                                  TOONER (cont d)
                    Like going to a supermarket.

      He steps to the next container.  Scans.

                    And 60 inch plasma TVs.  Thirty-two 
                    of them, to be exact.
                          (turns to crew)
                    Okay, let s get to work.

      Tooner s MEN move to the doors of the containers with 
      pneumatic crowbars.  The first one is wedged into the locking 
      mechanism and about to be turned on when --

                                  TOONER (cont d)
                    Wait!

      Everyone freezes.  Tooner points to the top corner of the 
      container door. 

      Someone puts a flashlight where he s pointing. A HOMEMADE 
      EXPLOSIVE.  He looks up at the other corner of the container.  
      Another BOMB. Tooner gives a signal. Men break for cover.

      IN THE SHADOWS -- nearby -- TWO HOODED FIGURES.  One 
      standing.  The other kneeling.  Holding a detonator.

                                    CLAYTON
                    Now!

      The kneeling FIGURE twists the switch on the detonator.

      Tooner and crew look up as BRIGHT BLUE ELECTRICAL SPARKS zap 
      the boxes.  No boom. Tooner stands up, cautious but smiling.

                                  TOONER
                    Well -- that had to be 
                      disappointing.

      IN THE SHADOWS, Clayton Caswell stares at the detonator in 
      his hand, furious. And scared.  

      WITH TOONER and crew -- he motions to his MEN to fan out.

                                  TOONER (cont d)
                    What, you re fighting us with 
                     bombs  you cooked up in chem lab?

      IN THE SHADOWS -- Clayton and other Vanguard guys. A couple 
      have pistols, some have baseball bats. 








                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     55.

                                  TOONER (O.S.) (cont d)
                    How did you think this was going to 
                    end?  You college boys could do 
                    what the LAPD and FBI can t? 

      The Vanguard guys turn to run, but find themselves looking 
      down the barrel of David and Colby s MP-5s.

                                  DAVID
                          (sotto)
                    FBI.  Put the detonator down.

      Clayton puts the detonator on the ground.  

      TOONER and his men. Tooner senses something s wrong.  
      SUDDENLY A BRIGHT BLINDING LIGHT burns into his eyes, the 
      THUDDING of POLICE HELICOPTERS. SWAT TEAMS swarm.  FBI SUVs 
      and Chargers, lights blazing. Beyond the RAYS of the blinding 
      Xeon searchlights unseen CHOPPERS blow up a furious wind.

      Tooner, stunned but impressed.  Even he has to appreciate the 
      magnitude.  Don and Nikki charge toward him -- weapons aimed.

                                  DON
                    ON THE GROUND.  NOW.

      Tooner smiles.  His mind made up.

                                  TOONER
                    Eat it.

      He lifts his gun, gets off a couple shots -- and BAMBAMBAM - 
      Nikki and Don fire. SWAT guys too. Tooner s riddled.  He 
      drops.  Don steps forward, kicks his gun away.  See David and 
      Colby with more SWAT -- and the apprehended VIGILANTES.  
      Clayton Caswell stares at Tooner s body. A crazy smile.

                                    CLAYTON
                    We killed you. Dammit. We killed 
                    you.

      Don exchanges a look with Colby and David.  

      INT.  EPPES HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT6969

      Amita, Larry, Alan and Marshall mill around the dining room  
      opening pizza boxes. Charlie puts down a tray of drinks.

                                  AMITA
                    So Marshall, how do you like your 
                    second taste of FBI work? 




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      NUMB3RS: 510/89: "Frienemies" - Rev. Goldenrod - 10/28/08     56.

                                  MARSHALL
                    Terrific.  Except for that one part 
                    when we met the psychotic killer 
                      face-to-face.  

                                    CHARLIE
                    That wasn t optimal.

                                  AMITA
                    You two don t seem to be fighting 
                    so much.

      Charlie throws Marshall a wry smile.

                                  ALAN
                    Is that on purpose, or did you just 
                    get tired of it?

                                  MARSHALL
                    Oh, it s on purpose. I never get 
                    tired of arguing. 

                                    CHARLIE
                    Marshall and I find we can actually 
                    get along. 

                                  MARSHALL
                    I should have stopped calling you 
                    Eppsy years ago.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Yeah, well I ve been called worse --

      The door opens, in comes Don, with two more boxes of pizza.

                                  DON
                    Hey everybody, hey, Chuck --  

                                    CHARLIE
                    Like that.
