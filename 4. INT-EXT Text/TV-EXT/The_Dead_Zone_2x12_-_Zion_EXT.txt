            neighborhood, with a large sign over the front door:
          "Church of the Voice of Zion."

          A small house for the Pastor is attached directly to the
          side of the church, allowing passage between.



          Bruce rushes out --  He looks wildly around for Johnny --
          but instead, his eyes find a pasteboard sign that reads:

                       Church of the Voice of Zion

          Bruce reacts, stunned.  He might as well have landed in

          Bruce is not feeling at all well... (it could be a
            lingering headache from the vision or as we will find
          out, it could also be the effects of a hangover); he puts
          some distance between himself and the people...

                                        BRUCE
                                (muttering under his
                                  breath)
                        Okay, John.  I'm hoping somehow
                        you can hear me... because I may
                        be caught in one of your visions
                        here... like our Zones have fused
                          together or something... but it's
                        a very strange vision... cause 
                        I've seen things that never
                          happened, John...  I never went
                        out the door, never left home...
                        and, and I think you may be in
                          trouble, John, cause I saw someone
                        shoot you... talk to me, John, I
                        need you...

                          Morning, Elder.

          Bruce looks over to see Dr. McCants... looks at him, still
          confused...

          Noting Bruce's jumpy disposition...

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                        Is everything all right?

                        Bruce, your momma's looking for

          Moving to reveal his father, in his sixties, current day,

                        You know she doesn't like to send
                        you out for the service without
                        giving you the once over.

                        It's... it's good to see you,

                        What are you all tongue-tied about
                        this morning?

                                        BRUCE

                        all.

          The pastor looks curiously at Bruce... McCants gives the
          father a look... the boy is acting strangely...

                                        DR. MCCANTS
                        I think the elder might do well
                        in moderating his Saturday nights
                        before his Sunday mornings.

                                        PASTOR
                        Go sit down and mind your business,
                        Doctor.

          McCants takes an affront, humphs, and goes inside...

                                        PASTOR
                        You just pull it together before
                        the service.  And use eye drops
                        before you go see your mother.

          Other PARISHIONERS including Alvin and Norma are arriving
          now, effectively ending the communication...

                          Morning.

          Nothing at all abnormal about the greeting and yet the
          Pastor looks at Norma with an extra half beat; we barely
          notice - she either doesn't notice or ignores it and moves
          inside.  Bruce has so many things he wants to say to his
            father...

                        Your mother's waiting for you.

          Bruce studies the face of the man... he almost reaches
          out and touches him... but can't... and moves inside...


          DAY - ALT REALITY

          On the street, ten or so motorcycles are riding by in an
          ad hoc parade... the riders are neat, each wearing white
          shirts and clean bluejeans... but the cycles have been
          customized beyond recognition...

          Hear a cell phone beneath the din... moving through the
          millworkers and college crowd, all of them wearing Stillson
          buttons, many waving signs... to find Johnny Smith but
          not the Johnny Smith we know and love... this is the Johnny
          Smith from the novel, the movie... this is an assassin...
          he looks for all the world like Arthur Bremer stalking
          George Wallace... neat, a little too neat, a little
          desperation in his eyes... not cheering while all the
          others cheer around him... "Go-get-'em, Greg"... people
          are looking at him because of the phone ringing which
          makes him nervous... the phone finally stops ringing...
          and he smiles uncomfortably at someone who is staring at
          him...

          A big bass drum and here's the (small) Trimbull High School
          Marching Band... Greg Stillson darting along with the
          band, slapping the tuba player on the back with glee...

          And to paraphrase Mr. King:

          "The crowd is screaming his name, chanting it: GREG...
          GREG... GREG...

          "The young guy who had billeted his family next to Johnny
          is holding his son up over his head so the kid can see. 
          A young man with a large, puckered burn scar on one side
          of his face is  waving a sign that says: "LIVE FREE OR
          DIE, HERE'S GREG IN YER EYE!"  An achingly beautiful girl
          of maybe eighteen is waving a chunk of watermelon and
          pink juice is running down her arm.  It is mass confusion. 
          Excitement is humming through the crowd like a series of
          high voltage electrical cables."

          Greg rushes over, remarkably close to Johnny - not
          recognizing him (never having seen him before).  A fat
          woman grabs him around the neck and kisses him... Stillson
            laughs...

                                        STILLSON
                        You bet I'll remember you, hon.

          SONNY ELLIMAN is directing the motorcycle riders to keep
          people at bay... pulling the fat woman away...

          Johnny gets a glimpse of SARAH in the Stillson entourage...
          and then suddenly his cell phone rings again... the sound
          brings Sarah's attention to him... and she sees who it is
          of course... and immediately turns away... genuinely
          distressed any time she sees him.

          The crowd lurches and suddenly Johnny finds himself face
          to face with Stillson who smiles at him...

                                        STILLSON
                        Hey, man, hope you're gonna support
                        us.

          And shakes his hand and RAMP TO JOHNNY'S FACE...

          And after the vision's done... the two men stare into

          a look of concern on his face.  He takes in the front of

          He puts his ear to the door -- nothing.  He looks around,
          tries the doorknob -- it's locked.  Thinks for a moment.
