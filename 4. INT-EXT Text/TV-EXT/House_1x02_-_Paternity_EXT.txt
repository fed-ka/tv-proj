      CLOSE ON a standard lacrosse stick pocket as it catches a
      ball.

      DAN

      16, who just caught the ball, runs behind the back side of
      the goal, directing the offense, taunting a HUGE DEFENSEMAN 
      who cruelly poke-checks his outstretched arm.

      DAN'S POV - As he looks at the field, he sees double.  Dan
      shakes his head to clear the webs.  Field comes back into
      correct view.

      DAN'S PARENTS, PAULA and ANDY, happy, loving, All-American,
      mid 40's, cheer their son from the PACKED STANDS.

      The DEFENSEMAN covering Dan lunges.  Dan takes advantage of
      the defenseman being off balance and darts to his left.  The
      offense is now in motion.

                                      DEFENSEMAN
                    Ball back right, ball back right!

      Dan rockets the ball to his MIDDIE #1, JAKE, who's cutting
      from the top of the key.  Jake catches the ball, then quick-
      sticks it back to Dan.  A bullet.

      DAN'S POV - SLOW MOTION: Two balls come right at him.  He
      tries to focus, but there are definitely two balls.  Which
      ball to catch?  He picks the left ball.

      As he catches the phantom ball, it vaporizes in his stick.

      SAME TIME

      The real ball hits Dan in the cage of his helmet and drops
      to the ground. 

      The crowd roars: "Oh!!!" 

      Dan, still on his feet, looks on the ground for the ball...

      Time slows way down.  We hear Dan's labored breathing and
      heartbeat as crowd noise and sounds of his teammates calling
      for Dan to get the ball all morph into one loud roaring sound.

      VFX: ZOOM right into Dan's eye and into his brain, where we
      see a synaptic lightning storm of activity.


                                                                (CONTINUED)                                                  HOUSE - Ep04 - YELLOW - 8/24/04  2.

1CONTINUED:1

      As lightning flickers across the gray matter of his brain, a
      powerful and nasty-looking lightning bolt fires right through
      the core. 

      WE ZOOM OUT of his brain just in time for:

      As time speeds back up to real time:

                                    JAKE
                    Dan!  On your left!

      But he doesn't react and a huge defenseman lays Dan out with
        a bone-crushing, illegal crosscheck to the head.  Dan's
      knocked back five yards.  On his back -- helmet knocked off
      his head.

      Another "Oh!"  From the crowd.  Dan's parents gasp. 

      The Referee quickly whistles the play dead.  Motions for
      Dan's coach to come out.

      The TRAINER rushes to Dan's side, quickly assesses the
      situation.

                                      TRAINER
                    You okay?  Dan...  Talk to me.*

      DAN'S POV - the trainer standing over him is barely visible
      or audible.

                                    DAN (O.S.)
                    I... can't see you.

                                      TRAINER
                    Get a doctor.*

      As a sickening rushing sound gets louder and louder...

                                                              SMASH TO MAIN TITLES:

                                          ACT ONE

      FADE IN:


      In his hospital gown, Dan stands behind the goal, eyeing the
      empty field.  He takes another step onto the back line.

                                      CHASE (O.S.)
                    Dan.  You okay?

      REVEAL CHASE, approaching from the sideline, the good doctor
      to talk some sense into a scared kid.

                                      CHASE (CONT'D)
                    There are experimental treatments;
                    ongoing research.

      But all is not as it seems... in fact, it's a whole lot worse:


      Everything we just saw was a hallucination.  Dan and Chase
      are in the exact same positions we just saw - relative to
      each other - but they're actually on the roof.  They're just
      a few feet apart but Dan is one step from stepping off the
      ledge and falling twenty floors to his death. 

                                      CHASE
                    Who knows what they'll discover in
                    the next year or two?

      Foreman and Cameron are about ten feet away.

                                    DAN
                          (to Chase)
                    This is where I dropped the ball.

                                      CAMERON
                    He doesn't know where he is.

      Foreman takes a step closer to Dan -- but Chase subtly waves
      him off.  Chase advances... tries to get through to him.

                                      CHASE
                    Dan?  I'm right here.  Dan, we're
                    standing on the roof of the hospital.

      Dan begins to pretend to cradle the ball (lacrosse style),
      pivoting, like he's going to throw, he's in the game, moving
      around...

                                      CHASE (CONT'D)
                    Dan.  You're not on the field.

      Dan steps forward - straight toward the edge of the roof;
      just inches from the edge.  Pump fakes.  Another step forward
      and --

                                      CAMERON
                    Dan --!*

      Chase is in a dead sprint from the side to save him.  Dives. 
      Just as Dan starts off the ledge he's blindsided by Chase --
      knocking him back, tackling him.

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                        ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      House and Wilson sit quietly eating cheeseburgers and French*
      fries.  House dips a fry into a plastic cup of ketchup. 
      Eats it.

                                      HOUSE
                    We're missing something.  This is
                    screwed up.

                                      WILSON
                    That's why you went for the 'brain
                    talking to a virus' thing.

                                      HOUSE
                      I panicked.  Sounded cool though. 
                    They bought it.
                          (then)
                    Oh crap.

      He sees Paula and Andy from a distance, heading their way. 
      He turns his head, trying to avoid being noticed.  But they
      do and as they approach:

                                      HOUSE (CONT'D)
                    Another reason I don't like meeting
                    patients.  If they don't know what
                    you look like, they can't yell at
                    you.  Here we go...

                                      PAULA
                    How can you just sit there?

      House looks up.  There are Dan's parents, Paula and Andy --
      distraught -- holding finished lunch trays.

                                      HOUSE
                    When I eat standing up, I spill.

      Wilson shoots him a look.

                    Our son is dying and you could care
                    less.  We're going through hell and
                    you're doing nothing.

                                      HOUSE
                    I'm sorry, you need to vent, I

                    right lateral ventricle.  EKG shows
                    a normal QRS but with deep wave
                      inversions throughout both limb and
                      precordial leads.  LFT's are elevated
                    but only twice the normal range.  Oh
                    yeah, and he's hearing voices.

      They're stunned into silence.

      The parents exit, leaving their half eaten lunches.  House
      zeros in on the parents' styrofoam coffee cups.

                    like this, I'm afraid I'll start to

      Off Wilson, considering...


      Two great lacrosse teams battle it out.  Music up: something
      thoughtful like Bill Evans "Peace Piece."

      SLOW MOTION.  At the midline, two defenseman race up the
      sideline passing the ball back and forth, finally clearing
      it over the line to a MIDDIE who dekes outside, then beats
      his man and charges inside towards the goal with the ball.

      REVEAL HOUSE -- off to the side of the stands... not in the
      crowd, but not a casual bystander.

      ON THE MIDDIE, #26, his legs churning.  Clumps of dirt being
      kicked up by his spikes into the air.  This guy has serious
      speed as he pulls away from his defender.

      HOUSE

                    Wheels, two-six, wheels!

      ON THE FIELD.  Midstride, the middie brings back his stick
      to shoot: sidearm.

      HOUSE holds his cane below the top -- like a lacrosse stick. 
      He mimics the middie EVER SO SUBTLY. 

      SLOW MOTION: The middie winds up.  House grips his cane. 
      Middie shoots.

      HOUSE makes the tiniest of movements.  Did House just shoot?

      FOLLOW THE BALL as it rockets over the right shoulder of the
      goalie into the top left corner of the goal.  The ball makes
      a loud SMACK as it hits the tape.  Goal!  The middie leaps
      into the arms of his teammates to celebrate.

      HOUSE shows no reaction -- looks at the stands going crazy --
      a great goal.  No one for House to celebrate with.  PUSH IN
      on House.  We see this game was once very dear to him.  Thumbs
      the top of his cane.  This is his lacrosse stick now. 

      PULL BACK TO REVEAL - the game ended a long time ago.  Stands
      are empty.  It's just House, standing there, watching an
      empty field. 

      And then there's House.  Alone.  Who hobbles away.  With his
      stick.

                                                                              FADE OUT.
