John brushes it.
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
You got it. Leaf or something.
JOHN

A leaf. On my forehead.
SEBASTIAN
Yeah, it musta had some sap on it.
They pass a cluster of CO EDS who laugh at John.

Well, okay, sometimes not so quiet.

Ordering a bunch of guys around, telling who to go where, as

Sebastian and John fill up at the coffee pot, start to move
through the office throughout...
SEBASTIAN
Well, what'd you expect? You bought a
house, man. A house with a mare

JOHN
What's wrong with a spare room?

It's empty, John. That's what's wrong

Sebastian smiles at a secretary, turns back to John.
SEBASTIAN
You want my advice? Get her a PuPPY
JOHN
A puppy.
SEBASTIAN
Something other than you she has to
take care of.

You have a kid, you're a dad. You're
not you anymore. You have a dog,
you're a master. You're still a guy.
With a life.
JOHN
And a dog...
SEBASTIAN
Whatever, man. You're still free.
You've stopped the clock.
JOHN
What clock?
SEBASTIAN
Okay... you know in movies when
there's, like, a bomb and it's ticking
down, ten seconds left, and there's
some guy with a wire cutter going, "red
wire... blue wire... which one do I
cut?" And the guy finally just makes a

Huh.
ARNIE .(O.S.)
Sebastian!
They both turn as Arnie sticks his head out of his office.
ARNIE (CONT'D)
Your travel's approved. Get outta here.
SEBASTIAN
In motion.
JOHN
Where you going?
SEBASTIAN
Colombia. I got a guy down there, says
he can put me next to Pablo Escobar--
I'm doing this piece, I follow a single
coca leaf from Colombia, to the streets
of Miami.
JOHN
Yeah, you and I once talked about doing
something like that. We were gonna call
it, "From Plant to Pusher." Remember?
SEBASTIAN
Not really.
ARNIE
HEY-- GORGAN--

JOHN
So uh, what kind of puppy?
Sebastian looks up at him.
JOHN (CONT'D)
To, y'know, cut the wire.
SEBASTIAN
Get her a lab. They're supposed to be
just like little kids. But easier to

JENNY
This isn't the ihop...
JOHN
A little surprise first...

Lori waves goodbye, check in her hand, as John and Jenny walk
to the car. Jenny carries a Polaroid of Clearance Puppy.
JENNY
You really sure about this? I mean, a
puppy's a lot of work.
JOHN
How hard could it be?
We hear A COMMOTION is coming from the woods, something
crashing through the brush, breathing heavily. They both
freeze as the sound comes their way.
JENNY
What's that?
Just then they are nearly knocked off their feet by a huge,
rampaging Labrador, soaking wet, covered with mud and burrs.
It circles them, barking WILDLY, a crazed look in its eye. It
jumps up on John, muddies his shirt, then barrels past Lori
into the house, knocking over a chair on the porch as it
goes. A beat.
JOHN
I think we just met the dad.
John kissing Jenny good-bye. They finally part...
JENNY
Call me as soon as you get him home.
Oh, hey, we need a name.
JOHN
How 'bout I just call him "Clearance
Puppy" until you get back. I only hope
he doesn't say his first word without
you.

John steps out of his car and the puppy, now twice the size
he was three weeks ago, bounds over to him. A harried Lori
follows, a rope leash and instruction. sheet in hand.
JOHN
Whoa! He got big... This is the right
one, right?
LORI
You should see him pack away the puppy

JOHN
So, what if I run into any problems?
LORI

Oh. Sure, call me. All sales are

tell that to everyone.
(QUICKLY)
You want help getting him in the car?
JOHN
No, that's okay, I'll just...
John opens the door, indicates that Marley should jump in.
Instead, the puppy runs around the car, barking, jumping up
on the bumpers. John finally catches him, lifts him up, puts
him on the front passenger seat atop some towels.

As John sets him down on the ground, steps back.
JOHN
Okay, now. Pee.
He motions with his zipper.
JOHN (CONT'D)
C'mon, man, do your thing.

Alright, I'm gonna show you this one
time...
From behind, we see John peeing.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Except you gotta lift your leg.
(lifts his leg)
See, this is how you guys do it...
Marley looks at him, squats and pees...
JOHN (CONT'D)
Or you could do it like that. Just not
in front of other guy dogs.
John gets into his car. He can hear WHIMPERING.
JOHN
Big day tomorrow! Rest up, pal!
He listens a beat; Marley quiets down. He gets in his car.
25.
John pulls up, gets out of his car. Halfway down the block,
we see a POLICE CAR, lights flashing, two OFFICERS talking to
a COUPLE. Another NEIGHBOR, in his robe, stands in the
street watching...
NEIGHBOR
Millers got robbed again.
(then, turns to John)
And that mutt of yours hasn't shut up
since you left.
John looks towards the garage where we hear WHIMPERING.

and a bunch of flowers. He gets to the car just as the rain
hits.

She nudges him. He gives her another kiss.
JOHN (CONT'D)
He's waiting for you.
John and Jenny get out of the car. We hear WHIMPERING in the
garage.
JENNY
Marley!
She takes off for the side door of the garage.
A seemingly continuous shot, except that it's now A SIX MONTH
OLD MARLEY who comes through the screen into the backyard now
clutching a set of curtains in his mouth, still attached to
the rod, and it's now JOHN who stumbles through the broken
wire mesh to chase after him...
JOHN
Marley, no!
John chases him across the backyard. Marley goes under the
fence and John starts to go over into...

And now it's a NINE MONTH OLD MARLEY who comes up from under
the fence clutching a THANKSGIVING TURKEY in his mouth. And
now it's Jenny AND John who go over the fence chasing him...

They wave to the NEIGHBOR standing on his patio watching.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Hi, Tom-- Sorry...
JENNY
Happy Thanksgiving...
Marley goes through a hedge and out onto...
Where Marley emerges into FRAME a FULL GROWN DOG, rapidly
pulling Jenny by the leash along the intercoastal waterway.

Uh, thanks.

He tried to eat one of our tires.

MS. KORNBLUT, weathered and stern, is studying John. Behind
John, eight puppies and their owners are chatting before the
class begins.
MS. KORNBLUT
Incorrigible? I don't believe in that.
All dogs want to learn. But they can't
when their owners are weak-willed.
JOHN
I'm very strong-willed.
MS. KORNBLUT
And where is your animal?
JOHN
He's over there. With my wife. He was
a little excited. He usually needs a
little time to calm down.
Ms. Kornblut looks at Jenny as she struggles up with Marley.
MS. KORNBLUT
I see. He calls the shots. Which of
you will be the trainer?
JENNY
we thought we both would, since we want
him to listen to both of us at home -
MS. KORNBLUT
A dog can only answer to one master.
Which one of you has the most natural
authority in your own relationship?
JOHN
(BEAT)
I'll watch.
MS. KORNBLUT
I thought so. We begin.
As Ms. Kornblut gestures, demonstrates the command:
MS. KORNBLUT
Sit!
35.
56
56 CONTINUED:
The students order their dogs to sit, and most of them do.
The ones that don't require only a little effort to get the
idea. Whereas:
Jenny orders Marley to sit; instead Marley jumps up on her
and puts his paws on her shoulders. She presses his butt to
the ground, and he rolls over for a belly rub. She tries to
tug him into place and he grabs the leash in his teeth,
shaking it playfully.
MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)
That, class, is an example of a dog
that has been foolishly allowed to
believe he is the alpha male of his
pack. And therefore he cannot be a
happy animal.
JOHN
(from the sidelines)
Yeah, he looks really bummed.
Kornblut hears him, death stares John.
MS. KORNBLUT
You. Joker. Rotate in.
John looks at Jenny who shrugs, holds up the leash for him to
take.
57 CUT TO: A HEAVY CHOKE CHAIN 57
As Ms. Kornblut demonstrates on her wrist.
MS. KORNBLUT
The choke chain. When your animal
walks properly by your side, there'll
be slack. If he pulls, it tightens
around his neck like a noose and
loosens as soon as he stops pulling.
JOHN
Does it hurt them?
MS. KORNBLUT
Well, it's not called a hug chain. But
they learn to like it. Go on, collar
your dogs.
Everyone else quickly, easily gets the choke chain around
their dogs' necks. Of course. Meanwhile:
John kneels down and struggles to put it. around Marley's
neck. Marley, liking its shiny jingling, tries to eat it.
36.
57 CONTINUED: 57
Much tussling, and John finally gets it around Marley's neck -
but Marley still manages to grab it in his teeth.
JOHN
He likes it.
MS. KORNBLUT
That's because he's eating it... Get it
out of his mouth. Class? Give your
dogs the sit command.
All the dogs sit; John forces Marley's butt down.
MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)
The leash is held in two places. Loop
around your right hand, left hand at
waist level. Dog always on your left,
of course.
JOHN
That means us, pal.
He rearranges Marley so he's on John's left.
MS. KORNBLUT
Now, when you give the heel command,
step off with your left foot - I don't
want to see any right foot first
steppers - and walk. If your dog gets
ahead, administer a correction by
forcefully bring your left hand down
and towards the right, and he'll
respond. Shall we? One, two, three -
now!
Just as the dogs and owners prepare to step off, Marley
lurches ahead of the pack...
JOHN
Marley, heel!
Marley takes off like a fighter jet, dragging John behind.
MS. KORNBLUT
Correct him!
John gives a mighty yank on the leash. Marley coughs,
hesitates. John loosens the leash - and Marley explodes
forward again. John yanks, Marley stops, John releases,
Marley explodes forward.
37.
57 CONTINUED: (2) 57
MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)
Rein in that dog! All right, everyone,
line up again. Demonstration. Mr.
Grogan? Pay attention.
She takes the leash from John and efficiently guides him into
line with the other dogs.
MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)
It's a simple question of confidence in
one's own authority. Shall I
demonstrate a simple walk?
JOHN
Be my guest.
MS. KORNBLUT
Class? Even an unruly dog wants to
obey his leader. Marley? Heel.
And she steps off confidently - but Marley is a bit more
confident than she is. He lunges, she pulls, he falls back
on his hind legs, then barrels up and lurches forward.
Ms. Kornblut half-stumbles, half rockets across the park.
She manages to turn Marley around, and the whole process
begins again as they make their way back to the line. Her
face is flushed with embarrassment, anger, and exertion, but
Marley, jowls frothing, is having a ball. It's like a
walking tug-of-war.
With difficulty, Ms. Kornblut manages to return Marley to
John, but not before, as a coup-de-grace, he starts humping
her leg enthusiastically. She struggles, he knocks her down,
and then he buries his face in her crotch and humps her knee.
John and Jenny rush over. John restrains Marley; Jenny helps
up Mrs. Kornblut. She's livid.
MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)
That's it! He's out!
JOHN
He usually just does this with poodles.
(looking at her bad perm)
Maybe it's the hair.
MS. KORNBLUT
He's a bad influence on the others.
Leg-humping is a virus. Once it takes
hold in a group - he has to go!
38.
58
As Jenny slows down in heavy traffic, John lunges out the
window after Marley, grabs the end of his tail with one hand
so that Marley dangles upside down, outside the car, by his
tail... He trots along the pavement with his front paws...
61
As Jenny puts on the flashers and gets out of the car, runs
around to the passenger side... a group of cars drive slowly
by in the other direction, all watching and laughing...
JOHN
(SHOUTING)
What are you looking at?! He's losing
his balls today! Cut the guy some
slack!

Live music, a sexy vibe. John and Jenny sit outside in the
hot Florida night. Dinner over, John raises his glass...
JOHN
To two years.
JENNY
That was fast.
JOHN
Good, though, right?
JENNY
Really good.
He lifts out of his chair and kisses her, a long one.
JOHN
So. What's next?
JENNY
I was thinking desert.
JOHN
No, I mean on your list.

You sure you wanna know?
JOHN
Yeah.
JENNY
well, it was between a new roof and a
baby.
He studies her for a long moment, then...
JOHN
I can probably live with a few leaks.
JENNY
Really? Because a leak can turn into
something bigger... and that can be a
big responsibility.
JOHN
I know.
JENNY
I was just thinking that we might want
everything fixed before we went to the
next step.
JOHN
Well, we've already fixed Marley.
Literally.

have one.
JOHN
If I'm following you correctly -- and I

JENNY
Bingo.

John gets out of the car. The young Girl next door gives him
a wave as she starts down the sidewalk with her boyfriend.
JOHN
Hi.
GIRL
Hi.
John watches the young couple go, arms around each other.

John grimaces in the morning sun as he watches Marley poop.
He takes a hose and squirts at the deposit until it runs into
the lawn. Nothing.
JENNY (O.S.)
Dr. Jay's sending over a laxative.
JOHN
Yay.
John hoses through Marley's huge orange iridescent poops.
JOHN
Man, you gotta lay off the mangoes.

You know, years ago, when I pictured my
life, somehow standing in my backyard
hosing down dog crap in search of my

mind.
(SUDDENLY EXCITED)
Aha! Jackpot!

John helps Jenny through the kitchen door. Marley follows
them, circles them wildly, then stops, puzzled, as he looks
at them. Jenny goes into the living room; Marley follows
her.
JOHN
You want some tea?

We can finally do that.

Take some time off. It'll be fun,

Jenny?
No answer. He goes into the living room and stops cold:
JOHN'S POV - JENNY & MARLEY
Jenny sits on the couch. Marley stands at her feet, with his
shoulders between her knees, his big head resting in her lap.
His tail hangs flat between his legs. His eyes are turned up
at her, and he whimpers softly.
Jenny strokes his head a few times and then, with no warning,
buries her face in the thick fur of his neck and begins
sobbing. They stay like that for a moment, Marley statue-
still, Jenny clutching him to her like an oversized doll.
John stands there, watching Marley take care of her. No
words, just being there. A lesson here. Her head down,
Jenny raises one arm up towards John and John goes to the
couch and wraps his arms around both of them. We then...
FADE OUT.
DEBBY (V.O.)
Oh. He's... big.
John and Jenny lug their suitcases across the front lawn to
the car, Marley running around them. Debby's glancing
through the binder.
JENNY'S VOICE
Debby. Welcome to our home! Marley is
a spirited dog who loves interaction.
We've never left him before but we're
sure he'll behave just as he does when
we're at home.
They kiss him goodbye. Get in the cab and go. Debby runs to
Marley, grabs his leash and struggles with all her might to
hold on to Marley.
85
Debby looks at the piles of orange poop everywhere.
JENNY'S VOICE
Use the red shovel and the blue bucket.
Watch your step. Don't worry about the
color. He likes mangoes.

John and Jenny enjoy the scenery. Sheep in the road surround
their car. Jenny leans out, laughing, and takes a picture.
JENNY'S VOICE
Marley's ears get a lot of wax buildup.
Once or twice while we're gone, please
use cotton balls and the blue ear-
cleaning stuff to clean them out. Wear
old clothes and try not to breathe.
88
John and Jenny stop at a bed-and-breakfast for the night.
It's raining softly.
JENNY'S VOICE
Thunderstorms are his weak point.
Well, one of his weak points. You can
give him sedatives if you think a storm
is arriving. He doesn't like them, so
push them down into his throat as far
as they go.
91
John and Jenny pull into the driveway. They see Debby, the
house sitter, on the front steps with her bag packed. She's
tired-looking, beat. She reaches for a pair of crutches.
John gets out of his car, a smile on his face.
JOHN
Hey, Debby. So how was--
-Debby hurls the binder of instructions at him.

101 CONTINUED:
DEBBY
There were eleven thunderstorms while
you were away. Eleven! And you were
right. He doesn't like thunderstorms!
JENNY
Okay, yeah, wow. Eleven, huh? That is
a lot.
DEBBY
And those goddamned dog tranquilizers
don't work!
JOHN
Did you give him four at a time?
DEBBY
I mean on humans!
She hobbles to the car, tries to get in with her crutches.
They frustrate her and she ends up beating the ground with
them until she throws them down. She's losing it.
DEBBY (CONT'D)
(as she gets in the car)
And just so you know, I am a dog
person. But that's not a dog! That's
evil with a dog face! That's also
humping your leg! Lose my number!!
And she gets into her car and guns it, splintering the
crutches as she peels out. John and Jenny, watch her go,
turn and look at the front door. Marley's face in the little
square window at the top, peeking out at them.
Jenny is tottering down the walk as John pulls out of the
garage, gets her into the passenger seat.
As John let's Marley out.
As Marley relieves himself, John yawning in the b.g.
Garbage day, and the trash piled outside the Grogan house
testifies to the change inside. Empty cartons of diapers,
the packaging from a crib, a stroller, the car seats, the
Pack'n'Play...
John sits on a bench, Marley at his feet reading "What to
Expect in the First Year." He takes a breath, looks up,
watches a COUPLE make out on a blanket.
120
John stands there letting Marley out. He looks back at the
house, watches Jenny through the window as she sets Patrick
down in his crib, shuts the light out.
As other lights come on, NEIGHBORS start to come out onto the
street. John runs to where we see THE TEENAGE GIRL NEXT DOOR
bent over, sobbing, in her driveway beside her car, driver's
door still open. John lets go of Marley and hurries to her.
GIRL
He said not to scream or he'd stab me,
but I screamed...
And John sees the blood on her shirt. He takes hold of her.
JOHN
Okay okay okay, I've got you...
(THEN)
Where's your mom?
GIRL
At work...
JOHN
Jenny'll call her...

Marley sniffs at the ground, growling more and more
intensely. We hear SHOUTING, "He went that way" as several
neighbors take off running. Marley lifts his head and he,
too, bolts into the night---
JOHN (CONT'D)
Marley! NO!
But he's gone and John has to stay with the girl. We hear
SIRENS as she slides down the car and sits down on the
ground. John sits down beside her, holding onto her...
JOHN (CONT'D)
All this time we've been living here, I
never got your name.
GIRL
Lisa.
JOHN
Well, you're gonna be alright, Lisa,
the police are on the way...
John looks off, wondering where Marley is...
A crime scene. Jenny, clutching the baby, stands on the porch
watching as an AMBULANCE pulls away. John, now in shorts and
a T-shirt, comes jogging up the walk.
JOHN
I can't find him anywhere.
JENNY
Maybe we should get in the car, drive
around.
JOHN
I'll get the keys...
John's coming into the house when a police cruiser pulls to
the curb in front of the house. A POLICEMAN gets out of the
driver's side, then opens the back and leads Marley out. He
bounds up the walk to the two of them who greet him...
JENNY
Marley!
JOHN
Where were you?

We found him outside the 76 station on
Radford. He had the guy cornered in the

JENNY
So you caught the guy?

jig caught the guy. He also gnawed the
barrel of my shotgun, and ate half my

They look at Marley wagging his tail, panting.
OFFICER (CONT'D)
Anyway, the neighbors all said he
belonged here, but none of them wanted
to drive him, so...
JOHN
Thanks for bringing him home.

John nods as The Officer heads back to his car. Jenny
crouches down and gives Marley a big hug and a back rub...

front. John pulls up. He opens the door, holds up a hand to
Marley who sits in the back--
JOHN
Stay.
--and starts to unhook Patrick from his car seat. Marley
bolts out of the car and heads straight for the house...
JOHN (CONT'D)
Marley!
75.
A MOVING VAN is parked out front. Marley runs back and forth
as the MOVERS load up the truck, John and and a very pregnant
Jenny supervising. John sees LISA, the girl next door, as she
comes out of her house. She walks over to him.
JOHN
Hey, Lisa.
LISA
Hi.
(THEN)
You're leaving.
JOHN
Yeah.
LISA
well, I don't blame you. I just
thought I'd come over and say--
But Marley comes running over and she crouches down to greet
him. She hugs him a while...
LISA (CONT'D)
I'm gonna miss you.
John watches as she holds on to him a bit longer, thanking
him as well. John turns away, starts back for the van to
give her a moment. She stands up.
LISA (CONT'D)
Where you moving to?
JOHN
Boca.
LISA
Huh.
JOHN
Huh... what?
LISA
Nothing. I just... never pictured, you
know, a guy like you moving to Boca.
JOHN
A guy like me?
LISA
Yeah, you know, young, cool, whatever.
80.
133 CONTINUED: 133
JOHN
So you think I'm young and cool. And
you're not just saying that because I
saved your life?
LISA
Actually, a paramedic named Josh saved
my life.
JOHN
Right. Well, take care, Lisa. Oh,
WAIT--
He reaches into a moving box, pulls out a chewed-up black
Converse.
JOHN (CONT'D)
I believe this belongs to you.
LISA
Thanks. I'll have to chew up the other
one to make it match.
(extends her hand)
Have fun down there.
JOHN
Yeah. It's gonna be great.
Still beautiful, but now we hear the sound of a BABY WAILING
OVER...
John pulls into his driveway, turns off the car and just sits
there.
As Jenny loads up the back of the car with bags of groceries.
Patrick, sitting in the cart, looks off and points--
PATRICK
Look!
Jenny turns and sees A BUS, with John's picture on the side,
an advertisement for his column. She watches it pass.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
Daddy!
JENNY
Uh-huh. I see him.
And she goes back to loading the car.
147
As John pulls up, gets out of his car. We hear Marley
barking in the garage.
152
The house where John and Jenny bought Marley. Lori, the
breeder, looks at Marley, sitting in the front seat, shakes
her head sadly.
90.
Marley & He Shooting Draft
155
As John posts some more flyers around the park. He drops a
flyer and Marley, walking beside him, starts to eat it...
JOHN
Smart boy.
156
"BROWARD COUNTY DOG RESCUE." A refuge for dogs. John fills
out a form...
JOHN
THE
Yeah, uh... Monday, then. Give us
weekend.
EMPLOYEE
Up to you.
John looks at the dogs in the back, all of them trying to get
his attention.
157
John walks around the yard picking up Marley's various toys,
putting them into a box.
91.
158 CONTINUED: 158
Marley follows, jumping up, trying to get the toys back out
of the box. John grabs a frisbee, looks at the dog.
JOHN
You can't lo any more of these, ok ay?
Because they s e 're not gonna keep getting
you more, and I won't be there to look
for them...
He looks at Marley standing there wagging his tail.
JOHN (CONT'D)
You're gonna be fine, alright. I'll
just be different. Maybe e
it'll, b better, nobody poking your
yanking your tail. Who knows? Could
be better.
John and Jenny and Marley and the two boys stroll. Feels
good to be out as a family again. Marley wants to greet all
the Boca mini-dogs as they are being walked or carried by
their owners. Jenny leans up against John.
JOHN
I made reservations at Sunny's.
Thought we could all sit outside.
JENNY
Sounds perfect.
(takes his arm)
Thank you.
They are seated at an outside table, shaded by a large round
umbrella. John hooks Marley's leash to two of the table legs
as a waiter brings drinks. Jenny holds up her beer.
JENNY
To a perfect day with my boys.
BEHIND THEM
A blonde Boca Trophy wife, with a poodle on a jeweled leash,
shrieks excitedly as she meets up with another woman, same
type, with another small fluffy'dog. The little dogs yip.
CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to underneath the table to Marley who has
spotted the poodles and is now locked and loaded.
ON JOHN AND JENNY
As suddenly their table suddenly leaps away from them and
starts moving down the sidewalk, crashing into other tables,
banging-into waiters with trays, making a terrible NOISE as
it scrapes over the faux Italian paving stones.
The four Grogans sit facing each other across, their drinks
suddenly in their laps.
Marley is pulling the table, like a dog with a sled, towards
the now-terrified small dogs. He is chugging forward with
every ounce of rippling muscle he has.
JENNY (CONT'D)
Marley!
John hurries after the dog; Jenny stays with the boys.
Marley & He Shooting Draft
94.
162 CONTINUED: 162
As Marley-with-table approaches the small dogs, they break
free of their leashes and run. Several innocent bystanders
are knocked off their feet.
There's a florist kiosk in the center of the plaza; Marley-
and-table take out most of the merchandise.
Security guards look around wildly. It's pandemonium, but
Marley is in heaven. He makes a circuit of the entire plaz a,
one poor poodle runs for her life.
Finally, back where Marley started, the terrified toy poodle
leaps into Jenny's arms. Marley tries to brake -
JOHN
Marley, no!
- and suddenly, he is jerked back. John has tackled the
table Marley's dragging. Marley YELPS and lands on his bac k,
then quickly rights himself, tail wagging, the happiest dog
in the world.
Everyone surrounding them on the plaza has frozen silent.
They all stare at Marley and the Grogans. The poodle jumps
out of her arms and runs to its distraught owner. Jenny's
head is in her hands, her shoulders heaving...
JOHN (CONT'D)
Jen, you okay?
(NO ANSWER)
Jenny?
And she slowly looks up, LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, her whole
body racking, tears in her eyes. Her LAUGHTER BECOMES--
--A BABY CRYING and we now go to...
John and the boys plant flowers in front of the house whilehead up like a
Marley, chained to a post, lies in the shade,
Sphynx, the baby, colleen in a portable bassinet beside him.
Jenny comes outside with some sodas for the boys...
JENNY
John, telephone.
CONOR
Mom, look what we did!
165
As John comes back out of the house, looking stunned.
JENNY
Who was on the phone?
JOHN
Philadelphia Inquirer.
She looks at him.
JOHN (CONT'D)
They're offering me a job.
(THEN)
As a reporter. I guess the editor was
down here on vacation, read my stuff.
JENNY
What'd you say?
JOHN
I said thank you very much, but I'm
happy where I am. I mean, it's a big
change, Florida to Pennsylvania.
JENNY
Yes, it is.
JOHN
Anyway.
John smiles at her, then goes to his sons...
96.
166
166 CONTINUED:
JOHN (CONT'D)
C'mon, guys, back to work...
She watches as he kneels down beside the boys, resumes
digging alongside them.
167
John pulls into the driveway, gets out.
169
The guests have gone. John sits in a lounge chair, holding
out a fork so that Marley can lick the cake off of it. Most
of the floating lights have gone out. Jenny comes out.
JENNY
Okay, tell the truth, were you really
surprised?
JOHN
Yeah. Thanks, Jen.
She sits down on his lap...
JENNY
You want your present?
JOHN
Is it what you gave me last year?
Because that was real nice--
She hands him an envelope.
JENNY
Happy Birthday.
He opens it, pulls out an AIRLINE TICKET.
JOHN
A plane ticket?
JENNY
To Philadelphia. So you can talk to
the editor of the inquirer.
99.
172
172 CONTINUED:
JOHN
That was months ago--
JENNY
I called the editor last week. They'd
still like to meet you.
JOHN
Jenny, I couldn't do that, uproot us.
We've got our friends, the schools...
JENNY
First of all, you don't even have the
job yet, it's just an interview.
Second of all, you don't have that many
friends.
JOHN
Thank you. What I was trying to say,
is that our life is here.
JENNY
Baby, I got news for you, our life is
wherever we are. And you're not happy
here anymore, doing that column.
You're restless, John. I feel it. I
feel it when you read Sebastian's
articles every day. And I feel it when
you sit out in the driveway an extra
five minutes before you come in.
(THEN)
Maybe it's time for a change.
JOHN
I'm forty, Jen. Seems kinda late for
that.
JENNY
Not so late.
She stands up in the dark, lifts her dress over her head.
JOHN
What're you doing?
JENNY
We're not old, John. We can still
surprise ourselves.
He sits there stunned as she now dives into the pool. She
surfaces and smiles at him.
100.
172
172 CONTINUED: (2)
JENNY (CONT'D)
Hey. You want your other birthday
present or not?
INTO
John can't get out of his clothes fast enough. He leaps
the pool and swims over to her, kisses her.
JENNY (CONT'D)
We're not old.
And then we hear ANOTHER splash.
JOHN
Uh-oh...
And a moment later Marley's head goes bobbing by.
173
Fall foliage. Beautiful, picture-perfect countryside. The
Grogan family car winds along the roads. Marley has his head
out the window, tongue wagging...
A two-story country house, no neighbors visible. Trees,
land, woodpile, the whole country living thing. The Grogans
pile out of the car, look at the house. Marley takes off
running...
JOHN
Marley!
Marley jumps into a pile of leaves, scatters them everywhere,
rolls over onto his back and knocks over a rake, which falls
and breaks a basement window.
JOHN (CONT'D)
And... we're home.
January. John wakes up. Marley is whimpering at him.
JOHN
What?
And then Conor and Patrick burst into the room.
PATRICK
It's here!
180
White everywhere. The family and Marley trudge into the
snow, unused to their boots and snowsuits. Marley jumps
around, barks like he's a puppy again.
181
The kids slide down the hill in a toboggan. John is at the
bottom to catch them. Up at the house, Jenny calls...
JENNY
Okay, time for lunch!
JOHN
I'll bring this in. Go on up.
The kids and Marley head up to the house. John drags the
toboggan up the hill. He pauses at the top and looks down at
the toboggan run. He gets on the toboggan.
JENNY
Honey, what're you doing?
JOHN
I can't remember the last time I rode
on a toboggan..
JENNY
Exactly.
He starts sliding down the hill. Marley runs for him as he
builds up speed...
JOHN
Marley, no!
104.
181 CONTINUED: 181
But Marley jumps onto John's lap as they get going...
ON THE TOBOGGAN
Flying down the hill. Marley is much heavier than the kids,
and they sail past the place where the kids stopped, through
the woods, barely missing trees and low-hanging branches,
TOWARDS:
JENNY
John! The creek!
The toboggan bumps over the crest of a small hill and sails
through the air, landing with a crash on the iced-over creek.
John and Marley tumble into a snow bank on the opposite side.
A moment. But then Marley jumps up and wriggles in delight.
John painfully unfolds himself, checks for injuries. Marley
comes up and romps with him.
JOHN
Hey... wanna do it again?
JENNY
John!
Early Spring. The snow has melted. Marley, still as a
statue, sits at the side of the road, waiting. Suddenly, he
stands up and starts to wag his tail.
105.
184
184 CONTINUED:
A moment later, a yellow dot appears on the horizon. As it
gets closer, Marley gets more and more excited as we now see
that the dot is a SCHOOL BUS. It pulls to a stop beside
Marley. Conor and Patrick get off and are greeted by Marley.
PATRICK
Hey, boy.
We HOLD WIDE ON THEIR BACKS as the boys start up the road
towards home, Marley bounding between them, nipping at
Patrick's backpack.
185
John pulls up as the boys now throw a football back and forth
while Marley leaps into the air, trying to intercept it. John
gets out of the car, claps his hands, holds them up...
JOHN
Hit me, I'm open!
Patrick throws the ball to John who catches it, mocks stiff-
arms his way to the front steps with the boys now hanging off
him as he gives the play-by-play...
JOHN (CONT'D)
My God, look at Grogan-- two three-
hundred pound linemen literally hanging
off him, but he won't be denied!
And now Marley jumps on them.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Ohhh, out of nowhere, a brutal hit from
the Strong Safety and the unthinkable
happens... GROGAN GOES DOWN...
And he collapses with the boys at the foot of the. steps,
Marley all over them, licking whatever faces he can get.
Colleen comes out the front door, stands at the top of the
steps...
COLLEEN
Mommy says dinner and take off your
shoes.
JOHN
Alright... c'mon guys...
They all get up, start up the steps. Marley follows, takes
one step when his hind legs buckle. John looks back at him.
106.
185
185 CONTINUED:
JOHN (CONT'D)
You okay, boy? C'mon...
Marley tries the second step and again his legs give out. He
looks up at them...
CONOR
What's wrong with him, Daddy?
PATRICK
(QUICKLY)
Nothing's wrong. He's just tired.
Right, Dad?
John sees the way Patrick is looking at him, knows he's
protecting his little brother.
JOHN
That's right. Football just took it
out of him. C'mon, let's give him a
hand.
And now the three of them go to Marley, help him up the
stairs.
186
Rain falls as John opens the door and Marley trots outside.
189
As John returns, steps outside, but Marley is nowhere to be
seen. John, claps his hand and whistles...
JOHN
Marley!
Now Jenny appears in the front door.
JENNY
What's wrong?
JOHN
He's not coming.
JENNY
Marley!
John starts off into the dark...
108.
190
190 CONTINUED:
JOHN
He can't be too far...
191
As John trudges through the rain looking for the dog.
192
Jenny looks in the barn, the garage...
193
She looks at
John comes into the kitchen - without Marley.
him with concern... he start out of the room.
JOHN
He'll show up.
194
John and Jenny run to'a tree at the edge of the property.
Marley lies on the ground, in a hollow, hidden from view from
the hill above. His belly is swollen, his face drawn. It's
clear he's very ill.
JOHN
It's okay, boy, it's okay...
197
The sun just coming up. We hear A PHONE RING OVER.
200
As John pulls up. He gets out of the SUV, walks around and
opens the back window and now Marley sits up into view.
112.
201
201 CONTINUED:
COLLEEN (O.S.)
Marley's back!
John opens the tail gate just as the kids come rushing onto
the porch, Marley's tail wagging as he's lifted out of the
car and set on the ground, the kids now surrounding him...
202
As a cab pulls away and John carries his suitcase up onto the
porch.
204
As John walks Marley off leash up a hill. At one point, John
has to stop and wait for Marley to catch up.
JOHN
Come on, boy, just a little further to
the top...
Marley comes up, panting, eyes wet and happy. John looks at
him, can see how tired he is.
JOHN (CONT'D)
You know what, this is a good spot
right here.
John looks out at the valley below, settles down onto the
damp earth beside Marley.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Let's just sit for a while.
The two of them sit there, looking out at the beautiful
countryside below. John strokes Marley for a moment. Looks
at the grey hair, the tired eyes that now look back at him.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Hey. So... you're gonna tell me,
right? When it's time? Because I
don't wanna make that decision on my
own. So you just let me know when
you're ready, okay?
Marley rests his chin on John's arm.
116.
205
205 CONTINUED:
JOHN (CONT'D)
Okay.
206
Late afternoon. John's car pulls up.
118.
John lifts Marley out of the car. Marley seems a little more
alert.
119.
212
212 CONTINUED:
JOHN
You wanna walk?
He sets him down gingerly. Hesitantly, Marley walks over to
the tree that countless dogs have peed on, sniffs it, then
looks around. John looks around, too. It's a crisp spring
night in Pennsylvania. Takes a breath...
JOHN (CONT'D)
Nice night, huh?
Marley looks around, then looks at John. There's something
in his expression. John nods, knows what he's saying.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Okay, boy.
(as Marley moves close)
Okay.
John, his heart breaking, bends down to carry Marley up the
front steps of the clinic.
213
John's on his cell phone...
JOHN
(INTO PHONE)
It's me. It's the stomach thing again.
Nothing's working. They could do
surgery, but...
120.
215
JOHN
(INTO PHONE)
I love you.
217
As the five Grogans walk across the-property. Colleen sits
on John's shoulders. They reach a clearing where we see a
small grave has been dug. John sets Colleen down...
COLLEEN
He's wrapped in his blanket...
JOHN
So he'll be warm.
JENNY
You guys want to read your letters?
COLLEEN
Mine is a picture. Of me and Marley.
And grasshoppers. And ice cream.
Mommy wrote what I said. "Dear Marley.
I will never forget you, forever." And
those are kisses.
JOHN
It's beautiful, honey. He'll like it.
Drop it in. Conor?
Conor reads his piece of paper.
CONOR
"Dear Marley. I loved you all my life.
I hope you like heaven and that there's
lots to chew on. Your brother, Conor
Richard Grogan."
John puts his hand on Conor's shoulder as Conor drops in the
letter into the grave.
JENNY
Patrick? Do you want to say anything?
225
225 CONTINUED:
PATRICK
He knows.
JENNY
I'd like to give him something.
Jenny reaches behind her neck and unclasps the gold necklace
John gave Jenny when she first got pregnant.
JENNY (CONT'D)
This little necklace has been on quite
a journey.
John smiles at her, remembering. So much shared history.
JOHN
Your dad gave this to me to celebrate
the beginning of our family. But you
know what? Our family had already
begun.
She looks into the grave, gently sets the necklace atop the
blanket, lets her hand rest there a moment, then stands up.
JENNY
Good-bye, Clearance Puppy.
DISSOLVE TO:
John puts few big stones on top of the tamped-down earth. He
sits on his haunches beside the grave, looks up at the house
across the yard.
JOHN'S POV - THE HOUSE
All lit up. We see the kids sitting by the fire while Jenny
moves about the kitchen getting dinner ready.
John sits there watching them. watching his family. The
family that both he and Marley grew up in.
He gives the fresh dirt a final, loving pat and then, as the
last bit of sun goes down, he stands up, and heads for home.
