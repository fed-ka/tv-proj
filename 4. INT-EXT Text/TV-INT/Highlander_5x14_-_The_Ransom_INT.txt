      Posh elegance, restrained charm.  People cluster around
      various GAMING TABLES, chatting, catching drinks from passing
      waiters.  As we move through the room --

                    She caught him in bed with the
                    Countess.  Or was it the Count?
                          (beat)
                    Anyway, Polanski liked them enough
                    to put them in his next film.

      ANGLE - THE ROULETTE WHEEL

      a whirling pinwheel of blurred color, as the BALL clatters
      among the slots.  Richie is sandwiched between two svelte
      YOUNG WOMEN.  They're slapping the table in excitement.

                                      RICHIE
                    Yes, yes!  Go!  Black 14!

      As with a final clatter, the ball comes to rest on

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Black, 14.

                                      RICHIE
                    Yes!  I win again!

      The WOMEN watch enviously as the Dealer shoves a large pile
      of CHIPS across to Richie.  Richie flips one to the Dealer.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Albert?  Save my place.
                          (airily)
                    This calls for champagne.

      Leaving the chips, he wades into the crowd to snag a champagne
      flute from a tray.  He turns, and bumps into --

      MARINA LEMARTIN

      spilling his drink and hers.  She's beautiful, twenties,
      clad in an elegant sleeveless black number that barely avoided
      being drenched.  Richie is mortified.

                                      RICHIE
                    Oh, man, I'm sorry...

      She watches, bemused, as he flounders, dabs at her dress
      with a napkin -- making an awkward situation worse.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                          (halting French)
                    Pardon, pardonnez moi... je suis
                    tres, tres... what's the word?

                                      MARINA
                          (teasing)
                    Clumsy?  A klutz, perhaps?
                          (a smile)
                    Don't worry.  No harm done.

                                      RICHIE
                          (relieved)
                    You speak English.

                                      MARINA
                          (a smile)
                    Yes.  At least I think so.
                          (extending her hand)
                    Marina LeMartin.

                    I'm Richie...
                          (catches himself)
                    Uh, Richard.  Richard Redstone.

                                      MARINA
                    Do you come here often, Mr. Redstone?

                                      RICHIE
                          (airily)
                    Only when the Mirage needs servicing.

                                      MARINA
                          (impressed)
                    Really.  You own a plane?

      She glances past Richie at EDOUARD CEVICHE: dark, late
      twenties, slightly shifty looking, in a waiter's jacket. 
      Edouard catches her glance and nods slightly.  Edouard grabs
      a couple of glasses of champagne from the bar.

      CLOSE - THE DRINKS

      Edouard DROPS something in one of the champagne flute.

                                      RICHIE
                    Just a little one.  The company jet.

      Edouard hands the drinks to Richie and Marina.  Richie is so
      engrossed in impressing Marina, he's oblivious.

                                      MARINA
                    Perhaps I've heard of your company?

      Richie turns back to the roulette table.  Thinking fast, he
      sees a pack of MATCHES on it.

                                      RICHIE
                    Ah... Match-Tech.  It's new...
                      Computers, modems, that sort of stuff.

      The DEALER clears his throat.

                                      MARINA
                    I think he wants you to bet.

      Richie realizes he's holding up the play, decides to impress
      Marina.  He pushes all his chips to the black.

                                      RICHIE
                          (to Dealer)
                    Let it ride on black.

      He winks at Marina, as the ball bounces, rolls --

      -- and comes up --

                                      VOICE (O.S.)
                    Red, four.

                          (repeats weakly)
                    Red four.

      Richie loses.  His face goes blank as he gulps the champagne.

                                      MARINA
                    All that money gone.

                                      RICHIE
                          (with faint bravado)
                    Pocket change.

                                      MARINA
                            (sympathetically)
                    You want to try again?

      Richie tries to compose himself, waves dismissively.

                                      RICHIE
                    No, I think I'm done.

      He puts a hand to his head -- he's feeling a little odd.

                                      MARINA
                    Something wrong?

                                      RICHIE
                    I just need a little air.

                                      MARINA
                    Why don't we go for a drive?
                          (coy)
                    You can tell me all about your
                    company.

      She bats her eyes, her tone suggestive in a sophisticated
      way.  Richie drains his champagne.


      A grand room, with a sumptuous elegance that has been let go
      a little.  Decorated with beautiful period furniture, the
      prominent feature is a large, four-poster CANOPY BED with
      velvet hangings.  Lying on it, minus his jacket --

      Richie, just regaining consciousness.  He shakes his head,
      tries to sit up -- but he can't move his wrists.  He looks --
      they're HANDCUFFED to the heavy wooden bed posters.  He yanks
      at the cuffs in frustration --

                                      MARINA (O.S.)
                    Please don't.  It scratches the wood.

      Marina enters with a water jug and a glass.

                                      MARINA (CONT'D)
                    Besides, you'll hurt your wrists.

      She smiles, more like a shy hostess than a kidnapper as she
      pours a glass of water for him, holds it out.

                                      RICHIE
                    No thanks.

                    Last time I had a drink with a girl,
                    I woke up handcuffed to a strange
                    bed.

      She sighs, puts the glass aside, anxious to please him.

                                      MARINA
                    Are you cold?  I could get a blanket. 
                    Maybe a couple of pillows.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm fine.  Nice bed, lots of
                      atmosphere... what more could I ask
                    for?

                                      MARINA
                    You don't have to be sarcastic. 
                    This is the best room in the chateau.

                                      RICHIE

                    Lady, you kidnapped me!

      She stands and moves around the room.

                                      MARINA
                    Don't yell at me... please.
                          (beat)
                    All we need is two-hundred thousand
                    francs.

      She smiles, as if that makes it reasonable.

                                      RICHIE
                    You're joking.  This is a joke, right?

                                      MARINA
                    This chateau has been in my family
                    for three hundred years.  Without
                    that money, it's gone... It can't be
                    gone.
                          (a plea)
                    You have to help us... Please, Mr.
                    Redstone.  Two-hundred thousand is
                    nothing to someone like you.

      She's heartfelt.  Richie feels a twinge of compassion.

                      Grandfather was hopeless with money.

                    He had to take out a loan against

                    No, you don't understand... mean, I
                    gotta GO!

      He rattles the cuffs uselessly, and OFF his look --


      Looking much as in the present.  The people and the clothes
      haven't changed much: tuxedos, a few long-hairs and sideburns,
      but the champagne is still flowing.

      ANGLE - THE CHEMIN DE FER TABLE

      MacLeod, changed into an elegant tux, is playing opposite a
        good-looking Englishman, JAMES.  Desiree, spilling from a
      low-cut dress, hangs on MacLeod's arm.  MacLeod is losing. 
      There are two others at the table.  Young manager CARLO
      CAPIDIMONTE watches the table for the house.  The Englishman
      deals the cards.

                                      CARLO

      He shovels the chips across the table to the Englishman.

                    you any luck tonight.

      MacLeod smiles, murmurs in her ear.

                                      JAMES
                    Bad luck, old man.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Perhaps tomorrow it will change.

                                      JAMES
                    But not against me.  I'm off to work.

      MacLeod slides his remaining chips to Desiree.

                    Here, see what you can do.  I'm going
                    to get us a drink.

      As he stands, James calls to him.

                                      JAMES
                    If you don't mind, old man?  Martini.

                      Naturally.
                          (aside, to Desiree)
                    I bet he can't tell the difference.

      As he moves away to get the drinks, we PUSH IN on Desiree's
      small pile of chips --

      THE SAME PILE rests before Desiree, but it has grown
      enormously.  She's on a winning streak, and a crowd of
      KIBITZERS watches the show as MacLeod looks on, bored.

                                      CARLO
                    Et bien.  Madame wins again.

      Desiree claps in excitement.

                                      DESIREE
                    Duncan, can you believe it?  The
                    first time I ever played!

                                      MACLEOD
                    It figures.

                          (off her look)
                    I mean, that's terrific.

      He looks at his watch, taps it.

      BARON LEMARTIN, the Casino's owner, a graceful, pleasant man
      of fifty, approaches, smiles benevolently at the scene. 
      Beside him, Carlo frowns.

                                      CARLO
                          (sotto voce)
                    It's not good for the house, Baron.

                                      BARON
                          (gently reproving)
                    Carlo, my ambitious friend.  A
                    beautiful woman is happy, and that
                    is always good for the house.
                          (a smile)
                    Money isn't everything.

      RESUME - MACLEOD AND DESIREE

      Desiree is growing nervous.

                                      DESIREE
                    Duncan... what if I lose?

                                      MACLEOD
                    If you're worried, stop playing.

                                      DESIREE
                          (eyeing the bank)
                    But I could win.  Tell me what to
                    do.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Let it ride.

                                      DESIREE
                    Easy for you to say.

      She nods at Carlo but grabs MacLeod s hand for support, biting
      her lip in growing tension as Carlo turns the cards...

                                      CARLO
                    Neuf a la banc.
                          (beat)
                    Madame wins.

      Desiree WHOOPS in delight throws herself in MacLeod's lap
      and kisses him as Carlo pushes the chips to Desiree.  It's a
      staggering amount of money.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You should play cards more often.

                                      DESIREE
                    Enough excitement for one night.
                          (giving him a look)
                    At least here in the Casino.

      MacLeod smiles.  As they rise from the table, Carlo moves
      toward them.

                                      CARLO
                    Perhaps madame wishes to leave her
                    winnings in the casino safe... ?

                                      DESIREE
                    No, madame wishes to take it with
                    her now.  In cash.

                                      CARLO
                    Cash?  A million francs?

      Desiree kisses MacLeod.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You heard the lady, Carlo.

                                      CARLO
                            (unreadable)
                    As Madame wishes.


      The hotel room is old, gorgeously appointed.  Desiree is
      spinning in the center of the room in wonder clutching
      handfuls of 500 Franc notes from a large pile on the table.

                                      DESIREE
                    Duncan?  Is this is how rich people
                    live all the time?

      MacLeod approaches carrying flutes of champagne.  As he hands
      her one --

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not if they want to stay rich.
                          (a smile)
                    You didn't have to order the most
                    expensive suite in the hotel.

                                      DESIREE
                    But I wanted to.
                          (teasing)
                    Besides, I like it.  For once, I'm
                    the one with the money.

      She moves in close, runs her hands over his chest.

                                      DESIREE (CONT'D)
                    And I can be very generous to those
                    who bring me pleasure.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You think I'm some gigolo you can
                    have for a few thousand francs?

                                      DESIREE
                    No, a million francs.

      She tucks a handful of money down his shirt.

                                      DESIREE (CONT'D)
                    What would this buy me?  Your neck? 
                    An ear?
                          (beat)
                    Your mouth, perhaps?

      She kisses each part in turn.  MacLeod is aroused, moves to
      kiss her back, but she pulls teasingly away.

                                      DESIREE
                    Ah, ah, ah... I'm not free.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then I'm in trouble.  I haven't got
                    a centime on me.

                                      DESIREE
                    I'm sure you'll think of something.

      MacLeod smiles, holds up his wrist, revealing a distinctive,
      expensive WATCH (a BREITLING, etc.).  He slips it off and
      drops it on the table.

                                      MACLEOD
                    What will this buy me?
                          (moving in)
                    This mouth?  This neck?  Maybe this
                    throat...

      She throws back her head as his lips caress her throat.

                                      DESIREE
                            (breathless)
                    I'm very expensive.  At least a
                    shirt...

      She pulls his shirt down, revealing his chest, kissing him
      all the while.  He rips the top of her gown, the spaghetti
      straps break.  They're both feeling the heat of building
      passion.

                    I think I may have to take out a
                    loan.

                                      DESIREE
                    Good.  Let's break the bank.

      She scoops up cash from the table, tosses it onto the bed,
      making a carpet of cash, and shoves MacLeod onto it, following
      him.  They're pulling at each other's clothes in eager
      passion, money and clothing flying in the air.

      She's on top of him, pulling at his clothes --

      ANGLE - THE DOOR

      as it SLAMS OPEN, and a MASKED GUNMAN stands there.

      MacLeod and Desiree break apart, Desiree holding two wads of
      CASH to cover her breasts.  MacLeod looks at the Gunman,
      then back to Desiree.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Did you order room service?

                                      GUNMAN
                          (muffled voice)
                    Shutup!  Put the money in the bag!

      He throws a bag before them.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Okay, okay, now we all stay very
                    calm.

      MacLeod slides off the bed and stuffs a wad of bills in the
      bag.

      Desiree leaps up, pulling up her dress, and yanks the money
      out again.

                                      DESIREE
                    Never!  Duncan won't let you!

      The Gunman points his gun at MacLeod.

                                      GUNMAN
                    I'll shoot him.

                                      DESIREE
                          (defiant)
                    Go ahead!  You think he cares?

                                      MACLEOD
                    I care.  Desiree, sit down.

      He grabs more money.  Desiree grabs it back.

                                      DESIREE
                    It's my money!

                                      MACLEOD
                    It's his gun.

                                      GUNMAN
                          (exasperated)
                    Fine.  I'll shoot both of you.

      MacLeod grabs her.  He speaks in a gentle voice through
      gritted teeth.

                                      MACLEOD
                      Sweetheart, it's not worth dying for
                    money... not even a million Francs.
                          (to Gunman)
                    Take it.

                                      DESIREE
                    No, you can't!

      MacLeod holds onto Desiree as the Gunman scoops money into
      the bag, then grabs MacLeod's WATCH off the table for good
      measure.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Not the watch...

                                      GUNMAN
                    Don't you start.
                          (backing out)
                    Follow me, and I'll shoot.

      He slams the door behind him.  Desiree rises to follow. 
      MacLeod takes her arm.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Desiree, it's just money...

                    And we've still got tonight.

      She grabs a blanket, wraps it around her, and heads out the
      door.  As MacLeod sits there, forlorn.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (beat; mutters)
                    Should've just let him shoot me.

      Looking much as it did in 1978.  MacLeod is idly spinning
      the roulette wheel as CARLO approaches, the Parking Attendant
      trailing behind him.  In 19 years Carlo has added weight,
      lost hair, and looks very prosperous.

                                      CARLO
                    Monsieur MacLeod!  What a pleasure! 
                    It must be twenty years!

      They shake hands warmly.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Hello Carlo.  Nineteen years.

                                      CARLO
                    Look at you.  You've hardly changed.

                                      MACLEOD

                    Is the Baron around?

                                      CARLO
                    I'm afraid not.  The old Baron went
                      a little...
                          (he taps his head
                            significantly)
                    Most regrettable.  I had to take
                    over the Casino.

                                      MACLEOD
                    A shame.  He was a good man.

      Carlo shrugs, as if burdened against his will.

                                      CARLO
                    One does what one can.

                    A young American with a Ferrari. 
                    Richard Redstone... he was supposed
                    to arrive here yesterday.

      Carlo turns to the Parking attendant.

                    The Baron's Granddaughter?

      Carlo tightens, tries to hide his annoyance from MacLeod.

                                      CARLO
                    I believe so.

                    She's a baby.  How old could she be?

                                      CARLO
                    Old enough.


      Marina is entering with a tray of food -- just as EDOUARD is
      rising from the bed where Richie lies, handcuffed.

      Edouard has a scowl on his face, and holds a covered CHAMBER-
      POT at arms-length.

                                      EDOUARD
                    I hate this.

                                      RICHIE
                    The feeling's mutual, pal.

      Edouard stalks out as Marina sets the tray down, lifts a
      forkfull of food to Richie's mouth.  Richie turns away.

                                      MARINA
                    Please, it's very good.  My
                      Grandfather made it himself.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marina, there's got to be some other
                    way.

                                      MARINA
                    No!  There isn't.

      She flops down on the bed.

                                      MARINA (CONT'D)
                    How can I expect a man who has
                      everything to know what it's like to
                    have nothing?

                    My parents are buried in the garden. 
                    I was born in this very bed.  My
                      grandfather wants to die here.  This
                    isn't just my home.  It's my life.

                    I'll do anything to keep it.

      Richie is moved by her quiet resolve.

                                      RICHIE
                    Can't you renegotiate the loan?

                                      MARINA
                    There's only one thing he wants more
                    than the money.

                    Me.  The pig wants me to marry him.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marry him?  You're not serious.

                                      MARINA
                    If you don't give us the two-hundred
                    thousand francs, it's what I'll have
                    to do.

                    So kidnapping me was your only chance.

                                      MARINA
                    It was Edward's idea.

                      Brilliant.  Your boyfriend's a real
                    criminal mastermind.

                                      MARINA
                    He's not a criminal and he's not my
                      boyfriend.  He's a painter.  My
                    family's supported artists for
                    hundreds of years.

                                      RICHIE
                    So let Rembrandt there sell some of
                    his paintings.

                                      MARINA
                    I'm afraid he's not very good.

                                      RICHIE
                      Wonderful.  The guy's not only a
                    crook and a sponge, he's a hack.

                                      MARINA
                    You can talk.
                          (defensive)
                    What kind of man leaves a casino
                    with the kind of woman who lets a
                    strange man buy her drinks?

      Richie opens his mouth, defeated by this logic -- She shovels
      food into his mouth.


      Richie is eating slowly, his eyes on Marina's as he chews.

                                      MARINA
                    You spilled.

      She takes a napkin, leans close to wipe his lips.  They're
      eye to eye, the attraction palpable.  He suddenly leans
      forward and kisses her on the lips.

      Finally Marina pulls free, and they stare at each other
      breathlessly, not knowing what to do next.

                                      MARINA (CONT'D)
                          (flustered)
                    I... I should go.

                                      RICHIE
                    No.  Marina, please... one cuff. 
                    Just one...
                          (beat)
                    I promise I won't run.

      BEAT.  She hesitates -- then reaches up and unlocks one cuff --
      then immediately drops the key DOWN HER DRESS, where he can't
      get it.  Richie slides his freed arm around her, pulls her
      close, and they kiss.96513 "Ransom of Richie Redstone" 25. Final Shooting Script 11/13/96




      Richie and Marina, still locked in a kiss, as Richie gets
      the BUZZ.  He breaks the kiss in a panic.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marina, unlock me!  Quick!  The other
                    hand!

                                      MARINA
                          (taken aback)
                    You promised!

                                      RICHIE
                    There's no time!  The key!

      He lunges, jams his free hand down her dress, fishing for
      the key.  She pulls away.

                                      MARINA
                    You pig!  I trust you, and you take
                      advantage!

      She SLAPS him hard.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marina, you don't understand! 
                    Someone's coming!

                                      MARINA
                    Now you're lying!

      She slaps him again, then turns and stamps out.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marina, come back!  I could die...
                    we could all die!

      She slams the door.  Richie pulls frantically at the cuffs,
      but it's useless.  And OFF his trapped look --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT TWO

      FADE IN:


      Richie has braced his feet against the bed post and is pulling
      with all his might, groaning with effort.

                                      RICHIE
                    Come on... give!

      Suddenly -- it does.  The POST rips free, and Richie tumbles
      onto the floor.  The entire CANOPY collapses, sending a shower
      of dust and OLD ROLLED CANVASSES from the top of the canopy
      onto Richie and the floor.

      Richie stumbles to his feet, untangles himself from the velvet
      hangings, and throws them OVER the rolled canvasses.  The
      BED POST and part of the frame is cuffed to his arm, locked
      at the narrow part of the post.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Great.

      He races to the window, pushes it open, and tries to get
      through it.  The POST jams sideways.  As he fumbles with it,
      trying to get out through the window --


      As the Old Baron -- 19 years since we saw him -- putters at
      the stove, close by a WINDOW, humming.  He's not senile, but
      definitely eccentric.   As he stirs a pot --

      ANGLE - THE WINDOW

      as a BODY plummets past the window, a faint CRY dopplering
      away, followed by a distant THUMP.

      The Baron looks up curiously -- sees nothing -- then shrugs
      and goes back to cooking, as Marina enters.

                                      BARON
                    Ah, Marina.  How is your young guest
                    doing?  Mr. Flintstone, was it?

      He kisses her fondly on the forehead.  Marina tries to hide
      her flustered state.

                                      MARINA
                          (forcing a smile)

                                      BARON
                    I'm glad.  This old Chateau needs
                    more people in it.  It's been too
                    empty the last few years.

      EDOUARD

      hisses at Marina from the doorway.  She leaves the old Baron
      and moves to him.

      MARINA AND EDOUARD

      whisper intensely.

                                      MARINA
                    What's going on?

      Edouard waves a NEWSPAPER he holds.

                                      EDOUARD
                    You tell me.
                          (waves the paper)
                    We steal an American millionaire,
                    and they don't even mention it!

                                      MARINA
                    Nothing?

                                      EDOUARD
                    And this company, this Match-Tech...
                    it's not listed in Dun and Bradstreet! 
                    Not on the stock exchange... nowhere!

                                      MARINA
                    Maybe it's too new.

                                      EDOUARD
                          (beat)
                    Or maybe Mr. Redstone isn't what he
                    seems to be.

      He turns and storms out.  Marina is right on his heels.


      Marina stands, hands over her mouth, as she and Edouard survey
      the wrecked bedroom.

                                      EDOUARD
                    I knew we couldn't trust him.  Now
                    he'll go to the police.

                                      MARINA
                    He wouldn't do that.

      The sound of the Chateau DOORBELL goes off.  They look at
      each other in horror.

      Edouard and Marina race into the foyer.

                    Remember, we never heard of Richard
                    Redstone.

      ANGLE - THE DOOR

      The OLD BARON is about to open it.

                                      EDOUARD (CONT'D)
                    Ahhh!

      Marina lunges forward, catches the Baron at the door and
      steers him quickly toward the kitchen.

                                      MARINA
                    Grandpa, hurry... the soup is burning.

                                      BARON
                    Soup?  Did I make soup?
                          (beat)
                    What kind of soup...?

      As they move OFF CAMERA into the kitchen --

      EDOUARD steels himself, and opens the door to find

      RICHIE

      standing there.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    I, uh... I was looking for the
                    bathroom.
                          (beat)
                    Can I come in?

      Edouard steps aside, and Richie steps inside.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Sorry about the bed.  No hard
                    feelings?

                                      EDOUARD
                    None.

                                      RICHIE
                    Good.  Where's Marina?

      As Richie turns -- Edouard grabs a VASE from a hall table,
      SMASHES IT over Richie's head.  Richie goes down like a sack
      of spuds, out cold.

      Marina comes in from the kitchen, sees Richie lying there in
      a pile of shattered vase glass --

                    I got him.96513 "Ransom of Richie Redstone" 31. Final Shooting Script 11/13/96




      Down some stairs close to the foyer, the cellar is a mess,
      all the racks empty of wine except for one.  Elsewhere --
      cobwebs, OLD TOOLS, lumber.  Richie is handcuffed to an empty
      wine-rack, a GAG over his mouth, pulling on his cuffs with
      no success.

                                      MARINA (O.S.)
                    You're not happy just destroying the
                    bed.

      Marina and Edouard stand at the entrance.

                                      MARINA (CONT'D)
                    You have to ruin the wine cellar
                    too?  What kind of guest are you?

      She slips off his gag.

                                      RICHIE
                    Guest?  You kidnapped me!

                                      MARINA
                    But in a civilized way.  We always
                    treated you well.

                                      EDOUARD
                    We were wrong.
                          (contemptuous)
                    Richard Redstone is a fraud.

                                      MARINA
                    Richard?  Is this true?  You're not
                    really a millionaire?

      Richie shakes his head.  He can't lie to her.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm sorry, Marina.
                          (beat)
                    I don't have any money.  I was just
                    playing the big shot.
                          (beat)
                    You kidnapped the wrong guy.

                                      MARINA
                          (stung)
                    You lied to me.

                                      RICHIE
                    But now I want to help you.
                          (earnest)
                    If you let me go, I will.

      He's sincere.  Marina chews her lip in indecision.

                                      MARINA
                    How do I know I can trust you?

                                      RICHIE
                    If I was lying, would I have escaped,
                    and then come back?

                                      EDOUARD
                    Yes!  Now I understand it all.
                          (beat)
                    He wants us to think he's poor, trying
                    to pretend he was rich, so we'll let
                    him go.
                          (beat, craftily)
                    But he's really rich, pretending to
                    be a poor, pretending he's rich, to
                    trick us into letting him go!

                                      RICHIE,
                    That's ridiculous.

                                      EDOUARD
                    See?  He denies it.

                                      RICHIE
                    Of course I deny it!

                                      MARINA
                    Quiet, both of you!

      There it is -- the DOORBELL.  They look at each other.

                                      EDOUARD
                    Keep him quiet.  I'll get the door.

      He races upstairs.  Marina throws an accusing look at Richie.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marina, I'm not lying now... I swear.


      Edouard arrives, just as the Old Baron is reaching for the
      door.  Edouard scoots forward, quickly steers the Baron away
      from the door.

                                      BARON
                    But I thought I heard the doorbell?

                          (beat)
                    It must be your soup burning.

      He steers the confused Baron toward the kitchen, straightens
      his hair, takes a breath -- and opens the door to reveal --

      MACLEOD

      standing there, all smiles.  Still grey in the temples and
      with glasses.

                                      EDOUARD
                    Yes?

                                      MACLEOD
                          (as if it's obvious)
                    I'm Duncan MacLeod.

                                      EDOUARD
                    Who?

      MacLeod slides past the baffled Edouard into the foyer.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Chief Financial Officer?  Match-Tech
                      Corporation?

                                      (beat)
                    Surely Mr. Redstone must've told you
                    I was coming?

                                      EDOUARD
                    He did?
                          (beat)
                    Of course he did.  How do you do?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Very well.
                          (winks)
                    Mr. Redstone called me.  He instructed
                    me to make sure this got to Marina
                    LeMartin.

      With a broad smile, he produces a CASHIER'S CHECK.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                      A cashier's cheque... for two-hundred
                    thousand francs.

      And as Edouard takes the check, open mouthed --96513 "Ransom of Richie Redstone" 34. Final Shooting Script 11/13/96




      As they HEAR Edouard's strangled voice:

                                      EDOUARD (V.O.)
                          (in distance)
                      Two-hundred thousand... ?

      Marina throws an accusing look at Richie.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marina, please, I can explain...

                                      MARINA
                    Don't bother.

      She quickly GAGS him, and heads up the stairs.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mgumph!  Gnyaggam!


      MacLeod looks up as Marina enters, gracefully offers him her
      hand.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Ah, you must be Marina LeMartin.

                                      MARINA
                    Yes.

      He plucks the check from Edouard, and hands it to her.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Then this must be yours.

      Compliments of Mr. Redstone.

                                      MARINA
                          (stunned)
                    Mr. Redstone is very... generous.

                                      MACLEOD
                    He can afford to be.
                          (looking around)
                    You know, this place would make a
                    wonderful hotel?  Perhaps Mr. Redstone
                    is interested in investing in such a
                    project.  If I could speak with him
                      a moment...?

      He steps forward.  Edouard quickly blocks him.

                                      MARINA (IN UNISON)
                    He's not here.

                                      EDOUARD (IN UNISON)
                    He's sleeping.

      BEAT.  They look at each other.  Then back at MacLeod.

                                      EDOUARD/MARINA
                    He's not here!

      They SLAM the door in his face.


      Richie is slumped against the wine rack as Marina enters.

      She removes his gag.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marina, please, let me explain!

                                      MARINA
                    There's nothing to explain.

      And OFF Richie's look, she pulls out the key, unlocks his
      cuffs, while Richie stares at her in surprise.

                                      RICHIE
                    I don't get it.

      She grabs him, kisses him long and hard.  Richie is melting. 
      She pulls away, leaves him breathless.

                                      MARINA
                    That's for saving me.

      She hauls back -- SLAPS him hard across the face.

                                      MARINA (CONT'D)
                    And that's for lying.

      She turns and heads up the stairs.  And OFF Richie's look,
      trying to decide how to take this --

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        ACT THREE

      FADE IN:


      Carlo sits at his desk, looks up at Marina and Richie.

                                      RICHIE
                    That's me.

                                      MARINA
                    The Richard Redstone, the millionaire. 
                    Surely you've heard of him.

                                      CARLO
                      Perhaps... but why would he interest
                    me?

                                      MARINA
                    Because he's paying off the debt on
                    the Chateau.

      She produces the cashier's check for two-hundred thousand
      francs, slaps it triumphantly on Carlo's desk.  Carlo picks
      it up with a slight smile.

                                      CARLO
                      Two-hundred thousand francs.  How
                    very nice.
                          (beat)
                    But I'm afraid I don't want it.

      He slides it back.

                                      MARINA
                    What do you mean, you don't want it?
                    You have to want it.

                                      RICHIE
                    There's two-hundred thousand francs
                    there.  That's the chateau's deed,
                    free and clear.

                                      CARLO
                    Not anymore.

                    The deadline was yesterday... and
                    you missed it.
                          (beat)
                    Chateau LeMartin is mine.

                                      MARINA
                    No!  You can't do this.

                                      RICHIE
                    Come on, Capidimonte, this isn't
                    fair.

                                      CARLO
                    So what?  It's still mine.
                          (beat)
                    Of course, I might sell it.

                                      RICHIE
                    How much?

                                      CARLO
                          (beat)
                    Ten million francs.

                                      RICHIE
                    What?

      Marina slumps against a wall, stunned.

                                      MARINA
                    I don't have that kind of money.

                                      CARLO
                    I suggest you talk to Mr. Redstone
                    here.
                          (a smile)
                    After all, he's the millionaire.

      And OFF this --


      Seated around a long table: MacLeod, Richie, Edouard, Marina,
      and the Old Baron, with barely touched glasses of wine.  The
      mood is despondent, as the truth of Marina s situation sinks
      in.  Edouard is in shock.

                                      EDOUARD
                    I don't believe it.  The Ferrari?

                                      RICHIE

                    The two-hundred thousand francs... ?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Mine.

                                      RICHIE
                    It was a fake, all of it.  Even the
                    tux was rented.

                                      EDOUARD
                    My God.
                          (beat)
                    I carried his chamber pot.

      Richie turns to Marina.

                                      RICHIE
                    I never meant to get your hopes up.

                                      MARINA
                    You never expected to be kidnapped.
                          (beat)
                    It's my fault.

      She puts her hand on the Old Baron's arm.

                                      MARINA (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry, Grandpa.

      The Old Baron shakes his head, pats her hand.

                                      BARON
                    You did what you could, my child.
                          (beat)
                    You all did.  It was an old man's
                      foolishness that caused this.
                          (to Edouard)
                    Edward, I have a request.
                          (beat)
                    Paint me a landscape of the Chateau. 
                    Something to take with us... to
                    remember the place we loved so much.

      Edouard nods with humility.

                                      EDOUARD
                    I'll get some new canvas tomorrow.

                                      RICHIE
                    Don't bother.  There's a ton of it
                    in the upstairs bedroom.

      They all turn to stare at him, wide-eyed.

                                      MACLEOD
                    A ton of what?

                                      RICHIE
                    Old canvasses.
                          (beat)
                    They were all rolled up, stuck on
                    top of the bed...

      He's cut off as everyone leaps from their chairs, races from
      the room.  Richie stares a BEAT, then follows.


      As MacLeod, Marina, Edouard come racing in, Richie on their
      heels.  MacLeod grasps the fallen canopy velvet, lifts it
      aside like a magician -- revealing stacks of rolled, very
      old canvasses.

      The group stares at them, tight with anticipation.

                                      MACLEOD
                    There must be a dozen of them.

      Edouard kneels reverently by the paintings.

                                      EDOUARD
                    You realize what could be sitting
                    there?  Monets... Matisse... Degas...
                      Picassos...

                                      MACLEOD
                    All the painters supported by the
                    LeMartins for centuries.

                                      MARINA
                    If one of them left a canvas --

                                      MACLEOD
                    If they did, then you're very rich.

      MacLeod bends to help Edouard, and they load a stack of
      canvasses on the bed.  Slowly, Edouard and MacLeod unfurl
      the first canvas, searching for the name.

                                      RICHIE
                    What if they're not any good?

                                      MACLEOD
                    It won t matter.  A bad Picasso is
                    still a Picasso... it would be worth
                    millions.

      He peers at the canvas as the Old Baron hobbles in.

                                      BARON
                    Who is it?  Picasso?  Monet?  They
                    say Van Gogh stayed here once...

                            head)
                    Albert Lemartin.
                          (turning)
                    Your ancestor.  An 18th century
                    amateur who fancied himself an artist.

      He opens another canvas, glances at it, goes white.  It's a
      bad likeness of Duncan.  He rolls it up hastily and tosses
      it aside.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    We found the life s work of a very
                      untalented man.
                          (to marina)
                    I m sorry.

                                      MARINA
                    Then that s it.
                          (beat)
                    There's only one thing left to do.

      The Old Baron straightens up with affronted Pride.

                                      BARON
                    Please, not Carlo Capodimonte!  Let
                    that nouveau riche lizard have the
                    house... but keep your honor.

                                      RICHIE
                    Marina, don't do this.

                                      MARINA
                    Richie... I have to.

      She turns and starts to walk out.  Richie calls after her.

                                      RICHIE
                    I'm falling in love with you.

      It stops her cold.  She doesn't turn for fear she won't be
      able to do what she must.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Please.

      Marina runs out, her heart breaking.


      MacLeod's memory flashes briefly back to the thief stealing
      his watch.

      RESUME PRESENT

      MacLeod is stunned for the moment and watches the Mercedes
      drive off.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            ACT FOUR

      FADE IN:


      Richie and The Old Baron are at the table, a bottle of wine
      before them.  The Baron is playing Solitaire, Richie morosely
      drinking.  Edouard is trying to spread one of the old canvases
      on an easel.

                                      EDOUARD
                          (fuming)
                    I don't need this.  I am an artist. 
                    I can go anywhere.  Rome... New
                    York... Berlin.

                                      RICHIE
                    I hear there's a train leaving in an
                    hour.

                                      EDOUARD
                    You'd like that, wouldn't you.
                    You... you...
                          (beat)
                    You petit bourgeous phoney!  You're
                    not even a millionaire!

                                      RICHIE
                          (tight)
                    Ed?  I've had about enough.  Knock
                    it off.

                                      EDOUARD
                    Or what?  You punch me, kick my ass
                    around the room?  Blacken my eyes?

                                      RICHIE
                    Sounds good to me.

      Edouard backs behind the canvas he's painting.

      MACLEOD

      enters.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                          (to Richie)
                    Sit...

      Richie slumps into his chair.  MacLeod goes to the Baron.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Baron, tell me about Carlo
                      Capodimonte.
                          (beat)
                    How did he come to own the casino?

                                      BARON
                    The same way he came to own the
                    chateau.  He came into a fortune.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Would that have been about twenty
                    years ago?

                                      BARON
                    That s right.  He invested well and
                    became a rich man.

      MacLeod's face darkens.

                                      MACLEOD:
                          (under his breath)
                    Lucky guy.

                                      BARON
                    Pardon?

                                      MACLEOD I
                    I said I'm going to see Carlo.
                          (beat)
                    I think we can work something out.
                          (grim)
                    Richie?  Get your keys.

      He heads purposefully for the door.  The Baron turns to
      Richie.

                                      BARON
                    What does he mean?

                                      RICHIE
                    I don't know.
                          (beat)
                    But if I were you, I wouldn't start
                    packing yet.
                          (beat; to Edouard)
                    You... you can pack.

      He follows MacLeod out.  And OFF the Old Baron's look --


      Richie hangs on for all he's worth as they scream along.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac, I gotta get this thing back in
                    one piece.
                          (off the silence)
                    You gonna tell me what's got you so
                    pissed?

      MacLeod takes a sharp corner, finally speaks.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Nineteen I years ago, Carlo
                      Capodimonte stole a million francs
                    from someone, a friend of mine.
                          (beat)
                    He used it to get the casino and
                    squeeze out the Baron.

                                      RICHIE
                    Now he's gonna force Marina to marry
                    him?
                          (beat)
                    The slimy bastard.  We're gonna kill
                    him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Something like that.

      He smiles nastily.


      Carlo's sitting at his desk as the door SLAMS OPEN -- MacLeod
      barges in, Richie on his heels.

                                      CARLO
                          (cold)
                    What's the meaning of this?

      MacLeod kicks the door shut, slams three LOCKED BOLTS home.

                                      CARLO (CONT'D)
                    I'll call the police!

      MacLeod turns, shoves the phone across the table at him.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Go ahead, Carlo.
                          (beat)
                    While you're at it, tell them what
                    happened nineteen years ago.
                          (beat)
                    Tell them how you held up two
                    people... How you stole a million
                    francs.

      He grabs Carlo's wrist, slides back his sleeve to show --

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    Tell them where you got that watch.

      Carlo pulls away.

                                      CARLO
                          (smug)
                    That won't prove anything.

                                      MACLEOD
                    You're right, Carlo.  But it doesn't
                    matter.
                          (beat)
                    Because I'm not taking you to court.

      He pulls a PISTOL from his pocket.  Carlo blanches and steps
      back, as Richie steps in.

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac, no!  You can't shoot him down
                    like a miserable dog!

                                      MACLEOD
                    Watch me.

      He raises the gun -- but Richie grabs him -- the gun goes
      sliding across the desk.

      Carlo quickly lunges for it.  MacLeod breaks from Richie,
      and grabs the gun at the same time as Carlo.  The two men
      grapple with it, the gun between them.  Suddenly TWO SHOTS
      ring out.  And everyone stops moving.

      Silence for a BEAT -- then MacLeod slowly steps away from
      Carlo, holding his chest, staggering.  He falls, grabs Carlo
      around the knees.

                                      MACLEOD (CONT'D)
                    You got me.

      He falls dead dramatically.  Carlo drops the gun in horror.

                    Oh my God.

      There's SHOUTING outside, POUNDING at the bolted door.

                                      VOICES (O.S.)
                    Monsieur Capodimonte!  What happened? 
                    Are you all right?

      Carlo turns a panicked look on Richie.

                                      CARLO
                    It was an accident!

                                      CARLO
                          (to the voices)
                    I'm fine.
                          (to Richie)
                    You saw... I didn't do it.

                                      RICHIE
                    That's not how it looked to me.
                          (beat)
                    Looked like he called you a thief --
                    and you killed him.

                                      CARLO
                    I didn't mean it, I swear!

                                      RICHIE
                    I'll swear you did.
                          (beat)
                    The watch... the body.  Your
                      fingerprints on the gun.  Looks like
                    prison to me Carlo.

      He moves to the door, slides back the first bolt.

                                      CARLO
                    No, please!  I'll do anything!

                                      RICHIE
                    Turn over the deed to the Chateau...
                    the deed to the Casino... and head
                    for South America.
                          (beat)
                    You never come back here, and I'll
                    forget what I saw.

                                      CARLO
                    This is extortion!  I won't do it!

                    Suit yourself.

      He slides back the SECOND BOLT.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    The deed... or the police.

      Carlo waivers.  Richie reaches for the THIRD BOLT.

                                      CARLO
                    Alright, alright!

      He turns to the desk, opens a drawer, and takes out a sheaf
      of papers.

                                      CARLO (CONT'D)
                    The deed to the chateau.

                                      RICHIE
                    Write "paid in full" and put Marina
                      LeMartin's name there.

      Carlo writes quickly, then hands it over.  Richie is surprised
      how easy it was.

                                      RICHIE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, now about the casino.

                                      CARLO
                    No.  Not the casino.  I'd rather go
                    to jail!

      He stands his ground.

                                      RICHIE
                    Too greedy?
                          (Carlo nods stiffly)
                    Okay, deal.

      He slides back the THIRD BOLT, sees the Parking Attendant
      and one or two surprised EMPLOYEES standing there.

      NOTE: MacLeod has fallen out of sight of the door but his
      feet are in sight.

                                      RICHIE
                    Nothing to worry about folks, just a
                    slight accident.
                          (beat)
                    But I think Mr. Capodimonte needs a
                    ride to the Airport.  Right, Carlo?

      He looks at Carlo.  Carlo grabs his jacket and hurries out
      the door.  Richie shuts it behind him.

      MacLeod comes back to life.

                                      MACLEOD
                    How was I?

                                      RICHIE
                    A little over the top.

                    I was an actor once.  I did
                      Shakespeare...

      As MacLeod's voice trails off.

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                          ACT : TAG

      FADE IN:


      Marina, Edouard, MacLeod and Richie are sitting at dinner,
      the Old Baron at the head of the table.  Marina is still
      dazed by her change of fortune.

                                      MARINA
                    I don't understand.  How did you get
                    him to return the chateau?

                                      RICHIE
                    Mac can be pretty convincing when he
                    wants to be.

                                      MACLEOD
                          (a smile)
                    Let's just say Carlo had more
                    important things to do.
                          (to Marina)
                    And so do you, if you're going to
                    turn the chateau into a hotel.

                                      MARINA
                    It's a wonderful idea, but it will
                    take so much work... and I can't
                    afford to pay anyone.

      Richie puts down his wine, looks earnestly at Marina.

                                      RICHIE
                    You know I don't have any money.
                          (beat)
                    But I've got skills.  I can fix
                    things, keep the books... pretty
                    much anything you need.
                          (beat)
                    If you want me.

      He holds her eyes, the offer clear.  Marina answers with a
      smile, reaches across the table and takes his hand.

                                      MACLEOD
                    I think that's a "yes."

                                      BARON
                    A bottle from the cellar.  Something
                    to celebrate.
                          (a smile)
                    I haven't felt this good since  58.

      He stands and MacLeod rises with him.96513 "Ransom of Richie Redstone" 52. Final Shooting Script 11/13/96




      MacLeod and the Baron approach the mostly-empty racks.  As
      the Baron chooses a bottle, MacLeod stares at the lumber,
      the old tools.  He runs a hand thoughtfully over the wall.

                                      MACLEOD
                    Baron?  When was this renovated?

                                      BARON
                    World War Two, I believe.  Why?

                                      MACLEOD
                    Just a hunch.
                          (beat)
                    Stand back, if you don't mind.

      He picks up a SLEDGEHAMMER from the tools, turns -- and
      HAMMERS the wall.  One blow, two, three --

      THE OTHERS

      hurry down the stairs to see what's going on, crowd in behind
      him.

                                      EDOUARD
                    He's breaking the wall!

      MacLeod hauls back for a final blow -- and the rest of the
      wall COLLAPSES, revealing --

      ANOTHER WINE CELLAR

      hidden behind a false wall.

      MacLeod and the Baron step in, followed by the others.  The
      Baron picks up a bottle, and reads in quiet awe.

                                      BARON
                    Mon Dieu.  A magnum of Chateau Latour
                      twenty-six.

      MacLeod picks up another, blows off dust.

                                      MACLEOD
                      A thirty-five Margaux.

                                      MARINA
                    How did you know?

                                      MACLEOD
                    When war broke out, families built
                    fake wine cellars for the Nazis to
                    plunder.  They hid their best bottles
                    in places like this.

      MacLeod indicates the bottle he holds.

                                      MACLEOD
                    This is worth six hundred dollars. 
                    That one's worth four thousand.

                    I'd say you're not poor anymore.

      Marina smiles, the Old Baron smiles.  He reaches for the
      bottle worth four thousand dollars.
