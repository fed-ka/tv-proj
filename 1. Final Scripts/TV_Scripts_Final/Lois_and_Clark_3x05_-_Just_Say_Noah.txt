notes:

To pop everything into place...

use Courier 10 (or 10 characters per inch)

set top margin at 0.4", bottom margin at 0.4" (or minimums)
left margin at 1", right margin at .25 (or minimum)
   (I had to tell the program I was using legal paper)

page breaks in hard copy indicated by ---page break---

regular tabs, hard returns and right flushes are used 
to position things to look as much like original as possible

sometimes the formatting changes slightly (as in the numbers at
the end of the lines), but I'm going to keep consistent because
it's easier

logo on front page will be noted when used but not included here

as this may be sent in .txt, originally underlined words will 
look like   _this_

I don't know what the (X) means; maybe it means the same thing as
the "*" in the other scripts

    FADE IN:

 1  EXT. METROPOLIS MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT #1                     1   

    LOIS comes out of a door on the right side of the ticket 
    box.  She heads for a trash can on the sidewalk to dump her
    popcorn.  CLARK appears from the left hand door and heads 
    for the same place.  As they meet:

                                    LOIS
                   What are you doing here?

                                    CLARK
                   Seeing a movie.

                                    LOIS
                   Because it's oddly coincidental 
                   that of all the movies playing in 
                   all the movie theatres we end up at 
                   the same one.  At the same time.

                                    CLARK
                   Maybe it shows we have the same
                   tastes.

    She starts walking briskly down the street.

                                    LOIS
                   Except I walked out.

                                    CLARK
                        (indicates himself)
                   Yo.

                                    LOIS
                   Well _I_ walked out because the 
                   plot was just warmed-over 'Bambi' 
                   without the political sub text.  
                   You?

                                    CLARK
                   I fell asleep!  What difference
                   does it make why I walked out?!

                                    LOIS
                   Because it shows how we look at the
                   same thing differently!

                                    CLARK
                   I think we're completely in synch!

                                    LOIS
                   Yeah, we're so 'in synch' that when 
                   you broke up with me, for 'my own 
                   good,' you figured 'Why bother 
                   talking to Lois about this 
                   life-altering decision, she 
                   probably knows it's best because 
                   we're so _in_ _synch_!!  We're 
                   about as 'in synch' as the English 
                   in a Japanese horror film.

                                    CLARK
                   Lois, I was wrong and I admit it.
                   C'mon, you can't stay mad...

                                    LOIS
                   Yes I can.  You can fly, I can stay
                   mad.  It's a gift.

    They've reached the stairs to Lois' building, out of which 
    comes a couple in their 30's, MICHELLE and ARNOLD SITKOWITZ,
    holding hands, laughing and chatting.

                                    MICHELLE
                   Hi, Lois.

                                    LOIS
                   Michelle.  Clark, meet Michelle and
                   Arnold Sitkowitz, my neighbors.

                                    MICHELLE
                   The 'Clark' I keep hearing about.              (X)
                   May you two be as happy as Arnold              (X)
                   and me.

                                    ARNOLD
                        (gazing warmly at her)
                   Ten years and never a cross word.

    Suddenly they're kissing, completely losing track of Lois 
    and Clark.  Lois and Clark stare, wait for them to stop, 
    they don't.  Clark glances at his watch.

                                    LOIS
                   It's... getting late.

                                    CLARK
                   Yeah.

    They look at each other.  Kiss?  Shake hands?  Where are we?

                   Well.  See you tomorrow.

    He smiles, nods, a bit sad, passes Arnold and Michelle, 
    still kissing.

                                    CLARK
                   Nice meeting you.

    And he's gone.  Lois glances over at Arnold and Michelle.

                   Ten _years_?

    She goes inside.  A beat, then:

                                    VOICE (O.S.)
                        (echo; with import)
                   Arnold and Michelle Sitkowitz....

    Arnold and Michelle dazedly stop kissing, look around for 
    the voice.

                                    ARNOLD
                   Where'd that come from?

    A potted bush near the stairs bursts into flames.

                                    MICHELLE
                   Look, Arnold, a burning bush.

                                    VOICE (V.0.)
                   Do not be afraid, for you have been
                   chosen.

                                    ARNOLD
                   Chosen for what?

    Dense SMOKE pours from the bush as Michelle and Arnold reel 
    and cough.  A cab pulls up with an evil, wizened Driver, and
    two Thugs in gas masks jump out and wrestle a weakened        (X)
    Arnold and Michelle into the cab.  It SCREECHES off, and

 2  INT. LOIS'S APARTMENT - ON DOOR - MORNING - DAY #2           2   

    Lois opens her door en route to work, nearly running into 
    a Cop heading down the hall.  Puzzled, Lois trails after him  (X)
    and comes upon STAR.  The Cop continues on to an open 
    doorway to speak to a distraught Woman.

                                    STAR
                   You _do_ have an alibi for where
                   you were last night.

                                    LOIS
                   Alibi?  Why do I need an alibi?

                                    STAR
                   That lady with the cop?  Michelle 
                   Sitkowitz's sister, Louise.  She 
                   lives cross town and the
                   Sitkowitz's were supposed to be at 
                   her place for poker last night.  
                   They play poker every Thursday...

                                    LOIS
                        (amused)
                   Does anything happen in this 
                   building you _don't_ find out 
                   about?

                                    STAR
                   No.  Anyway, Arnold and Michelle
                   _never_ _made_ _it_.

                                    LOIS
                   So?  Maybe they did something else
                   last night.

                                    STAR
                   Michelle and Louise are very close.
                   Michelle woulda called.  Anyway, 
                   Louise got worried, so she came 
                   over _here_ late last night.  The 
                   Sitkowitz's never came home.

                                    LOIS
                        (now concerned)
                   What?

                                    STAR
                   That's right.  Vanished.

 7  EXT. DAILY PLANET STREET - DAY                               7   

    Smoking cars are piled up on the street, with SUPERMAN 
    pulling a Man out of the rubble.  Terrified Nuns stand 
    staring at their mini-van, in the heart of the mess.  Lois 
    exits The Daily Planet.  Distant SIRENS.  Superman sits the 
    Man on the curb, makes sure he's okay, stands, as:

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Hi, where're you off to?

                                    LOIS
                   The interview.

    They both keep looking around, speaking under their breath, 
    trying not to be observed.  Superman keeps smiling, waving 
    to well-wishers who wave, give him "thumbs-up," etc.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   No, but since you're barely 
                   speaking to me, I guess this is one 
                   of the things you barely spoke to

                   Lois, I'm working... Excuse me.

    He dashes off to where smoke pours from a car, disperses it 
    with SUPER BREATH.  Meanwhile a NUN has come up to Lois.

                                    NUN
                   Oh, he's somethin', isn't he?

                   Yes.

                                    NUN
                   Thanks to him, the Sisters and I 
                   will still be able to bring our toy 
                   collection to the orphanage.  
                   Superman is a national treasure.

    Superman returns.  The Nun grabs him, gives him a kiss on 
    the cheek, goes.  A cop car and ambulance arrive.

                                    LOIS
                   You know how wonderful it feels

                   and sister-in-law vanished last 
                   month.  They were struggling 
                   artists.  Had only been married 
                   a year.  Moved here from Sweden.

                        (eying notes)
                   So in other words, they had 
                   absolutely nothing in common 
                   with the Sitkowitz's.
                        (to Hansen)
                   By any chance did they have a 
                   wonderful, seemingly perfect

                   even spoke of divorce and moving 
                   back to Sweden.

                                    LOIS

                   They said this Smiley fellow 
                   restored their relationship.  He 
                   rebuilt their trust in one another 
                   and promised them a hopeful future.

                                    LOIS

                   Michelle!! 

    Stricken, he can only stare as a second tube is wheeled from 
    the shadows.  Arnold is wrestled into the tube, locked into 
    the braces, and a clear panel slid shut.  A blue mist begins 
    filling the tube.  Stepping into the foreground is a 
    silhouetted shape, just head and a shoulder.  Arnold 
    notices, stares, his eyes filling with utter astonishment.

                        (studying desk)
                   There's one more thing in her
                   handwriting: 'Kathy. 4:30.                     (X)

                   I guess she was seeing this 'Kathy'
                   at 4:30. But who's Kathy?                      (X)

    Lois lifts the garment bag to reveal only Clark's things.

                                    LOIS
                   Wait a minute... Where's my
                   suitcase... ?
                        (turns to Clark)
                   Where's _my_ suitcase??

    She gazes severely from the ornate frame as we WIDEN, and:

                                    SMILEY
                   'Harmonicity.' Now put away your
                   Funk & Wagnalls, that ain't
                   English, it's what I call a

    The room is rustic, lodge-like, with huge bookcases on one 
    wall.  Appreciative chuckles from the couples seated all 
    around, cross-legged, on the floor.  Larry, in baseball cap, 
    is seated in an easy chair on a low platform, behind him is 
    the portrait.  Attendants move about the room, setting out
    refreshments, making name badges, etc.

                                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
                   'Harmonicity, is a blend, if you 
                   will, of complimentary desires.
                        (nod to portrait)
                   And as my dear mama would tell ya, 
                   that's what nature meant marriage 
                   to be.  How 'bout it, folks?  We 
                   got harmonicity?

    Excited nods and smiles.

                                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
                   Well heck, then take hands!  Smile
                   on yourselves!

    They hold hands, bob heads, smile like crazy.

                                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
                   Mama!  Darn if I can't feel it!  I
                   feel the harmony!  I feel the love!

                                    CLARK (O.S.)
                   It's not like I did it on purpose!

                                    LOIS (O.S.)
                   I left my bag right there on the
                   stoop!

    All eyes turn to the arched entry to a vestibule.

                                    CLARK (O.S.)
                   I thought you put it in the car!

    And they appear.  Lois wears a pair of Clark's khakis and a 
    chambray shirt.  She actually looks cute, but don't try 
    telling her.

                                    LOIS
                   Maybe subconsciously you felt the
                   need to...

    They freeze, aware everyone's staring.

    He and Lois sheepishly start to sit.

                                    SMILEY
                   No, no, stay standing, let's get 
                   right to work.  Now 'round here we 
                   speak 'Bluntspeak,' and that's a... 
                   what?...

                   Right you are, Female Lemur!

    Excited murmurs and light applause.  Lois and Clark look at 
    each other.

                                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
                   And bluntly speaking, you two have 
                   gotta stop dressin' alike!  I mean 
                   honey, look at yourself.  Do you 
                   hate your feminine side?

                                    LOIS
                   What?  No!

                                    CLARK
                   Look, she's very feminine...

                                    SMILEY
                   Ah! See, this is what I call the 
                   'Echo Pattern.' She says something 
                   and you gotta chime in.  That 
                   pretty much how it works?

                                    LOIS
                   No!

    A torch is put to the altar stand and a flame leaps up as

    Lois, in one of Clark's t-shirts, lies in bed.

                                    LOIS
                   Scared to death.  I just mentioned 
                   the Sitkowitz's names, Kathy went 
                   white as a sheet.

    PAN TO Clark, in cut-off sweatshirt, draped between two 
    wicker chairs, looking miserable.

                                    CLARK
                   Well, I scanned the place, and no 
                   sign, no sound of 'em.  Either 
                   they're not here, or they're in a 
                   lead-lined room...

                                    LOIS
                        (soberly)
                   Or they're dead.

    Clark shifts, tries to get comfortable, leaps up in a frenzy 
    of blankets and pillows, points accusingly at the chairs.

                                    CLARK
                   This is not a bed!

                                    LOIS
                        (pleasantly)
                   No, this is a bed.

                                    CLARK
                   A... kind of large bed, actually.

                                    LOIS
                   And this is business.

                                    CLARK
                   Okay, fine.  You think I can't
                   handle this?  I can handle this.

    And he stretches out in thin air as if climbing into an 
    upper bunk.  Lois sits up, stares.  He puts his hands behind 
    his head, floating, comfy.

                                    LOIS

                   Your life is so strange.

                        (facing her)
                   Lois, for me flying is a piece of 
                   cake.  I've been doing it since 
                   high school.  If I screw up, what's 
                   the worst that can happen?  Lose a 
                   little altitude?
                        (he demonstrates a bit of
                         drop)
                   But being in a relationship is new.
                   If I blow it with you... I lose
                   everything.

                                    LOIS
                        (softening)
                   Look, Clark... I'm actually not as
                   good at romance as I might look...

                   Really?

                                    LOIS
                   I mean, my life's basically been 
                   about work.  So I'm trying to 
                   figure this out, just like you are.

    He smiles, floats a little nearer.

                                    CLARK
                   So we'll... help each other...

                                    LOIS
                   I know I don't always respond

                   through.  And not expect me to just

    He floats back over by the chairs.

35  INT. LOIS AND CLARK'S CABIN - NIGHT                         35   

    Lois and Clark are both asleep. Clark floats by the open
    window.  A breeze WHISTLES through the trees, the curtains
    flutter.  It pushes Clark toward the bed until he is
    floating directly over Lois.  Clark turns in his sleep onto
    his stomach; he is now directly facing Lois.  She stirs in
    her sleep, her eyes open, she finds herself face-to-face
    with a floating man.

                                    LOIS
                   Aaaah!!!

                   scared... Let's calm down...

    A rock flies through the window, sends a lamp SMASHING to 
    the floor.  Lois screams again.

                                    CLARK
                   It's okay!  It's just a rock!

                        (gently)
                   True.  But 'I love you' does mean 
                   'I'd never hurt you on purpose.  
                   And maybe I'll make more mistakes, 
                   just as you will.  But we'll learn 
                   from them.  And move on.'

    Wild APPLAUSE as the group rises to its feet.  Lois stares 
    at him, moved.  He smiles back.

                                    SMILEY
                   Son, you pack a lotta horse sense
                   in them tight britches.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   I really do have to go.  You guys
                   keep up the good work.

    And he streaks out the vestibule in a BLUR of blue.  Clark
    immediately enters through vestibule, scratching a bit.

                                    CLARK
                   Wow, finally got that poison oak
                   under control.  How was Superman?

                   He was... wonderful.

                   I don't think that group therapy

                                    LOIS
                   I did think a standing ovation was
                   a little excessive. Here we are.

                   Yes. I think she wants to tell us
                   what she never got to tell Michelle
                   Sitkowitz.

                                    CLARK

                                    LOIS
                   I just hope she didn't get...

    A loafer suddenly falls into Lois' lap.  She looks up and
    SHOT WIDENS to reveal, in the foliage, two dangling feet.

                                    LOIS (CONT'D)
                   ... cold feet.

                   Oh boy.

    He glances around, then flies up, out of FRAME as Lois        (X)
    stares anxiously up, then glances at the shoe, pulls a
    crumpled paper from inside it.

    Outside the windows we see cop car LIGHTS.  Larry Smiley, in
    robe and baseball cap, herds three cops, along with sleepy
    campers and Attendants in night wear toward the vestibule.

                                    SMILEY
                   I always knew the girl had
                   troubles...  Many's the time her
                   little tears would splash down my
                   shoulder...  But suicide?  Who
                   woulda thought?

    Everyone's out.  Smiley takes one last look around the room,
    shuts off lights, exits, LOCKING doors.  CAMERA PANS through
    the shadows to where Lois and Clark emerge from a hiding
    place.  They click on FLASHLIGHTS.

                                    LOIS
                   Got that paper from Kathy's shoe?

                   Kathy wanted us to see it.
                        (shines light on books)
                   Which one do you think it came
                   from?

    Clark does an instant scan of the books.

                   None of 'em; they're all too new.              (X)

                                    LOIS
                   What next room?

    Clark gives a bookshelf a tug and it opens to reveal a small
    anteroom hidden on the other side.

    Lois and Clark step into the gloomy room which features a 
    collection of musty, ancient books and a desk stacked in 
    file folders and other papers.  Lois looks at the clutter 
    while Clark examines the books.

                                    LOIS
                   Smiley must work in here.  Look, 
                   these files are divided into piles 
                   marked 'rejected' and 'candidates.'
                   Candidates for what?
                        (looks closer)
                   Clark, we're in the 'rejected'
                   pile!

                                    CLARK
                   Lois, don't you think that's
                   probably a good thing?

                                    LOIS
                   But I like to at least feel wanted.
                        (reads notes on file)
                   Smiley says we're not compatible!  
                   He says I don't trust you or 
                   respect you and doesn't know _why_
                   you put up with me... !

                        (it just pours out)
                   Of course I trust you!  I respect 
                   you more than anyone I ever met!
                   And if I get angry, it's just 
                   because I never opened up to anyone 
                   so totally in my whole life and I 
                   get hurt if I think that trust 
                   isn't returned!  And you put up 
                   with me for the same reason I put 
                   up with you..!  Because I love you 
                   completely!

    She's breathing hard, realizing all she's just said.

                                    CLARK
                        (quietly)
                   And... I love you.

    The cabins are dark.  A convoy of small covered trucks and
    trailers is being readied, with the Attendants scrambling
    into the trucks with cartons of books and papers.  Smiley
    strides out, climbs into a truck, it starts off.

                   Smiley and his people are
                   abandoning the camp.  Let's go.

                                    JIMMY
                        (nervously)

    The Attendants hurry to board trucks which are starting to
    pull away.  Lois and Jimmy slither along a row of bushes
    toward the clearing.  Boxes and books are dumped into a
    small, canvas-covered trailer behind a truck, and the last
    of the Attendants leaps into the cab.  The truck starts to
    pull away, Lois and Jimmy rush out and jump into the small
    trailer, and the convoy heads off in an eerie cloud of dust.

    The tail end of the convoy is pulling up outside a run-down
    warehouse as we CRANE DOWN to the trailer where Lois and
    Jimmy hide.  They peer out of the canvas flap, watch the
    last of the Attendants go inside, then climb out and creep
    up to the huge door.  Their mouths fall open in shock.

    Mounted atop a curtained platform, lit by spotlights, is
    what appears to be an enormous... ark.  Though modern
    technology is evident, the shape is distinctly ark-like. A
    ramp leads up the curtained platform to an open door in the
    ark's side.

    the phone, along with the Aquaplus 1000 and the thin
    curtained area.

    Smiley turns and stares at the phone; the others do, too.

    He hangs up, turns beaming to the followers.

    Wild APPLAUSE, shouts, whistles. Smiley grows louder and

    Smiley yanks a lever on the device.  A horrible, THROBBING
    SOUND and a thick blue beam shoots from the machine
    straight up and explodes through a skylight in the-           (X)
    ceiling.  Smiley whirls on the narrow draped area.            (X)

    They hurry back along the curtained platform, round a corner

    Lois and Jimmy cower as lightning bolts SIZZLE in the sky
    near the rod.  Suddenly, Superman alights on the roof just
    as there's an enormous boom of THUNDER and a flash of
    LIGHTNING.  A bolt of lightning strikes the rod, Superman
    grabs it, the whole rod glows and the glowing passes down
    the rod, through Superman's arm, until his body glows and
    the lightning discharges into the roof, just missing Lois
    and Jimmy.  He quickly frees them, as:

    The Attendants have once again begun wheeling the tubes,
    which are now all clustered at the base of the ramp.  Smiley
    is looking joyfully about, when:

                                    SUPERMAN (O.S.)
                   Alright, Smiley.  Shut it off.

    As Smiley spins, spots Superman hovering near the beam.       (X)

                                    SMILEY
                   You can't stop this!  This day has

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Only by you, Smiley.  And that's
                   not enough.

    Superman flies into the beam, forcing it back down toward
    the machine.  Smiley tries turning up the power and the       (X)
    NOISE INTENSIFIES, but Superman continues forcing the beam    (X)
    down into the device, which suddenly EXPLODES in a shower of
    sparks and smoke, its THROBBING SOUND winding down to a dull
    THUD.  Outside, the THUNDER and LIGHTNING ends.  Lois and
    Jimmy rush in from outside.

                   Just brilliant!  You've ruined
                   everything!  That machine was the
                   source of all power in the New

                        (indicates tubes)

    Superman pans his eyes from cylinder to cylinder, his HEAT
    VISION making each glow with a faint HISS.  The occupants of
    each tube slowly open their eyes, begin to stretch and move.
    Finally, we come to Perry White.

                                    PERRY

    WIDEN to include Alice's tube, her face and part of her body
    hidden by a pile of crates.  One of her hands reaches out
    toward Perry, touches the side of her tube.  He smiles.

    Superman and Lois float down to the window, step inside.
    She turns to face Superman, smiles shyly.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   Smiley had pretty much given up on
                   people finding happiness together.
                   I haven't.  Have you?

                   No.

                   But we do seem to keep messing up.
                   Why is that?

                                    LOIS
                   Well, first of all, people mess up.
                   But I think adjusting to this whole
                   idea of marriage on top of...
                   everything else we're adjusting
                   to... is making us both a little
                   nuts.

                   So...

                                    LOIS
                   So maybe we should just take a 
                   little break from the idea of 
                   marriage.  Not even say the 'M' 
                   word.  And just be in love.

                                    SUPERMAN
                   I can do that.

                   It's a lot of pressure... That

                   What?

                   It's not the 'M' word that makes it
                   forever for me.
                        (beat)
                   My love's forever because... It
                   just is.

    She stares at him, swept away.  He kisses her and FLOATS off 
    into the night.
