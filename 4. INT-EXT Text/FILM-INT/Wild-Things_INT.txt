A hundred high school kids sit before a raised, hardwood stage.
The students are not unlike the campus, radiant, well-tended -- a
veritable sea of adolescent sexuality -- bronze boys who seem to
have just come from the boats or tennis courts -- girls in tight
shorts riding high up shapely thighs, as...
SAM LOMBARDO strolls out onto the stage.
The man is thirtyish,
drop-dead handsome.
Dressed not that differently from the kids,
in an Izod polo shirt, khakis and boat shoes.
His entrance has an effect upon the audience, particularly upon
the girls.
KAREN and JANELLE, 16, pretty blondes, whisper then giggle.
NICOLE, a dark-eyed beauty, 17 but going on 25, watches Sam's
walk, then turns to the girl at her side...
KELLY VAN RYAN, 17, a fully-developed knockout.
NICOLE
When we graduate the only thing I'm
going to miss is...
(with a nod to the stage)
Know what I mean?
Kelly's eyes are locked on Sam.
Nicole has to nudge her.
NICOLE (CONT'D)
Kelly?
KELLY
(still staring)
Oh yeah.
Sam is at the podium.
He looks out across the audience.
There
are a couple of flirtatious whistles, laughter.
Sam smiles,
silencing them with a wave of his hand.
SAM
We've come to the halfway point in my
senior seminars...
Cheers, applause.
Sam waits for the kids to settle.
SAM (CONT'D)
Come on.
Beats study hall, doesn't it?
JIMMY (O.S.)
No!
Boos as we FIND...
JIMMY LEACH, 18, grumge look, long hair.
He sits with a clique
of white trashy types, or at least what passes for such at Blue
Bay School.
Jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does...
SUZlE TOLLER, a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just
enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a
loner.
She studies Sam Lombardo with a dark, sullen stare.
SAM
Thank you, Jimmy.
JIMMY
Hey, man, at least in study hail I could
meditate.
KIRK (O.S.)
He means masturbate...
This remark is greeted by a chorus of laughter as we FIND...
KIRK, one of the golden boys, seated with Kelly and Nicole.
SAM
Something Kirk with which I'm sure you
have hands-on experience.
Loud laughter.
Sam quiets them again, then turns to the
blackboard, where he begins to write, in big letters -- S-E-X.
The kids start to cheer.
Sam writes another word -- C-R-I-M-E-S.
The cheering fades into silence.
SAM (CONT'D)
We've all heard the words, date rape,
sexual harassment.
We've talked about
some of these things in this room.
(beat)
Our speakers today head up the Blue Bay
Police Sex Crimes Unit -- Detectives Ray
Duquette and Gloria Perez.
(beat)
They're here to give you what we hope
will be a fresh perspective on these
subjects, and to answer any questions
you night have.
Sam turns to the wings, his hand out to welcome the visitors...
RAY DUQUETTE, mid-thirties, with the lanky build of a light
heavyweight, walks out onto the stage.
He's dressed in a dark
suit, dark hair combed straight back above steel-rimmed glasses.
GLORIA PEREZ walks at his side.
She's a good six inches shorter
than Ray, with a sweet face.
Attractive but no stunner.
About five kids applaud.
Ray takes the podium.
RAY
Thank you for having us.
We'll each
talk for ten or fifteen minutes, then
open it up to your questions...
IN THE AUDIENCE
Suzie Toller suddenly gets to her feet.
As she passes behind
Jimmy, we HEAR her VOICE, beneath her breath.
SUZIE
I'm not going to listen to this
jack-off.
She marches down the aisle and bangs out the rear door..
Ray pauses, a dark look on his face, then goes on...
RAY
Let's begin with a question.
What is a
sex crime?
A moment.
JIMMY
Not getting any.
This draws a few laughs from the kids, a couple of thin smiles
from Sam and Gloria.
And none at all from Ray Duquette.
SAM
This is one of the original buildings.
We have the offices here now.
The walls are paneled in wood, decorated with framed photographs.
Gloria stops before one of the photos.
ANGLE ON PHOTOGRAPH
An old black-and-white, with that sepia caste harkening back to
another age.
A handsome young man of perhaps 14 stands at the helm of a boat
under sail.
His hair is swept back, his eyes fixed upon an
unseen horizon.
There is something in this boy's pose, in the
line of his jaw, in the clarity of his gaze, as if what he has
fixed upon is the future itself.
GLORIA
Anybody in particular?
When no one answers, she turns to find Sam at her side.
He
stares at the picture, then looks at Gloria.
SAM
Sam Lombardo.
The first.
Class of
'Forty-Two
(beat)
My father.
Gloria does a slow double-take, looking from Sam to the photo and
back again.
VOICE (0.S.)
Can't seem to get rid of the Lombardos
around here.
Sam and the detectives turn as a professorial-looking guy in a
baggy brown suit (ART MADDOX) arrives on the scene.
SAM
Art.
Say hello to Detectives Perez and
Duquette.
(to the cops)
Art Maddox. A fellow guidance counselor.
Art and the detectives shake hands.
ART
So, did you set 'em all straight on the
ugly facts of life?
SAM
I have the feeling, they got it down
already.
They're a step ahead of us,
Artie.
Gloria seems to find this amusing.
Ray stands at her side, looks
at Sam.
Sam feels it, makes eye contact with Ray -- a beat -- at
which point, Ray puts a hand on Gloria's back.
RAY
I've got that two o'clock in town.
GLORIA
(nodding)
Back to the land of grownups.
The detectives shake hands once more with San and Art.
SAM
(to Gloria)
If old pictures interest you, come back
some time, there's quite a collection
down in the pagoda.
I'll see you get a
proper tour.
GLORIA
(smiling)
I'd like that.
Ray opens a door for her.
The detectives pass through it.
Art claps Sam on the shoulder, then walks off down the hallway.
Sam remains near the doors, watching as...
ANGLE ON THE DRIVE LEADING TO THE SCHOOL
Ray and Gloria walk past half a dozen expensive cars -- Range
Rovers, Beamers and Mercedes, to a plain, white Ford Taurus,
which they get into and drive away.
Sam and BARBARA, 28, a lean, beautiful country-clubber roll on
the bed.
Barbara is dressed for tennis.
Sam wears a baggy pair
of khaki shorts.
Barbara struggles to escape.
Sam grabs a leg,
kisses the back of her knee.
He pushes up the little white skirt, kissing her between her
thighs.
BARBARA
(getting just a little
breathless)
Sam, come on... I'm gonna be late for my
game...
Sam keeps at it.
She's starting to weaken.
BARBARA (CONT'D)
Not that I'm going to be much good after
last night...
SAM
Eat a power bar.
Barbara starts to giggle.
He's just about got her when...
The DOORBELL RINGS.
Sam lets go.
Barbara sighs.
Sam goes to the front door, opens it, to find...
Kelly and Nicole, holding plastic pails full of rags.
The girls
are dressed in Blue Bay High T-shirts, cropped to REVEAL flat
tummies, shorts and running shoes.
GIRLS
Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
Sam looks over the girls -- a small, exasperated smile.
KELLY
Look, he forgot.
I knew it.
SAM
No I didn't.
Check out the Jeep.
It's
nice and dirty for you.
(beat)
But you might want to wait a minute.
The Mercedes is leaving.
NICOLE
You mean that isn't yours too?
The girls giggle.
Sam smiles.
KELLY
Where's the hose?
We can set up.
SAM
In back of the garage.
As they walk away, he is joined by Barbara.
She watches the
girls with an appraising eye.
BARBARA
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
SAM
Kelly.
BARBARA
She's going to wash your Jeep?
SAM
Senior class fund-raising gig.
I told
'em they could hose down the Jeep.
(off Barbara's look)
Hey, come on.
It's for a good cause.
Barbara laughs at him.
BARBARA
Sam the philanthropist.
(a beat)
Tomorrow, right?
Sam nods.
Another kiss.
Sam is rummaging through drawers.
He stops when he hears the
SOUND of a CAR.
He goes to the window in time to see Nicole's
BMW headed down his street.
Sam ENTERS the room to find Kelly just inside the doorway, where
the water from her wet clothing has formed little pools on the
linoleum.
Sam looks at the water.
He looks at Kelly.
She moves a step
closer, allowing the door to SWING shut behind her.
Sam ENTERS.
The house is dark.
SAM
Barbara?
Nothing.
Me CROSSES the living room and starts down the hallway,
where a faint light issues from beneath the bedroom door.
Sam opens the door.
He hears the SOUND of RUNNING WATER.
He
walks across the room and into the bathroom.
Clouded mirrors, a shower stall full of. steam.
Behind the glass
door we SEE an indistinct shape, moving about in the hot water.
Sam opens the shower door.
The steam clears to REVEAL Barbara's
gorgeous athletic body.
BARBARA
It's hot in here, just the way you like
it.
She grabs his shirt, pulling him into the shower's flow.
They
kiss.
She pulls his shirt open, loosens his pants.
His clothes
fall away.
Sam pushes her up against the tile wall, hard.
She
holds to his shoulders, nails sinking into his flesh, wrapping
her legs around his hips as...
The water, dark with swamp mud, spirals down the drain.
Sunlight streams through open windows, mingling with loud sighs
of pleasure... Sandra Van Ryan on top of FRANKIE CONDO, a big,
buffed-out Cuban.
They're making love on the bed.
She throws
her head back -- an explosion of hair -- gasps -- an orgasm is
near, as...
A cordless PHONE RINGS on the night table.
They try to ignore
it.
No dice.
Sandra groans, finally pulling away.
SANDRA
Goddamnit!
(she answers)
Hello.
COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
Hello, this is the attendance office at
Blue Bay School.
Your son or daughter
is absent today, Monday...
SANDRA
Jesus H. Christ!
She hangs up hard.
Sits on the edge of the bed.
FRANKIE
What?
Sandra waves him off.
She pulls on a T-shirt, then grabs up the
phone once more, punching in a number.
Desk, files, a terrarium full of swamp lizards, above which a
photo of the Windward Passage decorates the wall.
There's a
Waterford bowl on the desk -- etched with "Sam Lombardo -- Blue
Bay Educator of the Year."
Sam is working on the computer.
The PHONE RINGS.
He answers.
SAM
Counseling.
XNTERCUT - SANDRA/SAM PHONE CONVERSATION
Sandra seated on the bed, one long leg tucked beneath her.
SANDRA
Sam, Sandy Van Ryan.
Frankie's eyes go cold when he hears the word "Sam."
In his office, Sam pushes himself away from the computer,
stiffening noticeably.
SAM
Sandy... What's up?
SANDRA
Listen, Kelly skipped school.
Have you
talked to her?
SAM
No.
SANDRA
Shit. Here we go again.
SAM
Didn't you see her this morning?
SANDRA
To tell you the truth, I haven't seen
her since Friday.
BOOM -- A SHOTGUN BLASTS outside Sandra's window.
She jumps.
BOOM, BOOM -- more BLASTS.
She jumps up to look outside.
SANDRA'S POV - KELLY
stands at the edge of the bay, launching skeet then blasting them
high above the water.
BACK TO SCENE
SANDRA (CONT'D)
Never mind.
I found her.
(a long beat)
Listen, Sam.
It was good seeing you the
other day.
(beat)
I haven't found anyone else can handle
the Jonathan like you can.
She glances at Frankie -- who has heard enough.
He gives her a
long hard look, then rolls from the bed to walk from the room.
Sam remains silent, watching the lizards with their blank,
unblinking eyes.
SANDRA (CONT'D)
Look.
I know you're seeing Barbara
Baxter.
So what?
SAM
So maybe I'm a one-woman man.
Sandra laughs.
SANDRA
Right.
(beat)
You really think you're gonna get one of
these Blue Bay women to marry you?
Sandra pauses to laugh once more.
SANDRA (CONT'D)
Grab a clue, Sam.
You're a hired hand
around here.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
SAM
Goodbye, Sandra.
Sam puts down the phone, looks at it -- a long moment as -- the
barest hint of a smile plays upon his face.
Sandra slams down her phone.
She looks to the bay, to the sleek
racing sloop floating beyond the private dock.
SANDRA
The nerve of some people.
PAN to REVEAL room -- the gun case, the animal trophies, the
photos -- One of a stately old gentleman in an elaborate wicker
chair, a cane at his side, a bowler on his knee.
Others of Kelly
and a handsome middle-aged man in safari gear, posing with their
rifles above slain wildebeests and bison.
Sandra and Kelly ENTER.
Kelly puts down the shotgun, turns,
tears in her eyes.
SANDRA
Okay, what's the matter?
KELLY
You notice my new jumper?
Kelly does a three-sixty, like a model on a runway.
KELLY (CONT'D)
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't
look like trash.
SANDRA
I would hardly say you look like trash.
KELLY
No thanks to you.
She sits on the bed.
Sandra moves to stand over her, angry now.
SANDRA
Come off of it.
(a beat)
You run with all these little trust fund
brats... They think money grows on
trees.
It doesn't.
Believe me.
And a
lot of your little friends are gonna
learn that one the hard way.
(beat)
I'm trying to spare you that.
Kelly goes to one shoulder on the bed, sobbing now.
Her mother
continues to stand over her, suddenly more perplexed than angry.
SANDRA (CONT'D)
Kelly.
What is it?
KELLY
I miss Dad.
SANDRA
Jesus.
(a long beat)
Well, I do too, sometimes...
KELLY
No you don't.
SANDRA
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.
He could have gone out and gotten a job.
Christ, he could've found another rich
woman... He never had a problem tucking
my friends when we were married.
She pauses as Kelly cries all the harder.
SANDRA (CONT'D)
I don't know why he did it.
I really
don't...
Her voice trails away, as meanwhile Kelly has drawn herself up
into a fetal position on the bed.
The sobbing has stopped but
her shoulders continue to shake.
Sandra sits on the edge of the
bed, reaches over to rub Kelly's back.
SANDRA (CONT'D)
Can I get you anything?
Kelly shakes her head, no.
Her mother looks at her, clearly at a loss.
At last she stands.
She is headed out of the room when Kelly says something, but the
words are indistinct, as her fists are pressed against her mouth.
SANDRA
What, honey?
I can't hear you.
There is a long beat as Kelly collects herself.
She stares at
the wall, her eyes filled with tears, but when she speaks she
enunciates each word.
KELLY
I said.
I was raped.
Sandra looks as if she has been struck.
SANDRA
What?
KELLY
I was raped.
(a long beat)
By Sam Lombardo.
Sandra moves over to the bed, sits once more.
SANDRA
He... Sam Lombardo?
KELLY
Yes.
God, Mom...
Kelly begins to cry.
Sandra pulls her upright, cradling her in
her arms, eyes on fire.
Sandra slams a fist on the conference table.
Kelly is seated between her mother and her mother's attorney, TOM
BAXTER.
Baxter sports an Italian suit and a lethal Alexander
Haig look.
Seated across from these three are Ray, Gloria and BRYCE HUNTER,
the local D.A.
Silence follows Sandra's outburst.
Baxter reaches to squeeze
Sandra's shoulder.
Kelly puts her face in her hands.
RAY
(in a quiet voice)
You're saying that Kelly was raped by
Sam Lombardo.
SANDRA
That's right.
Ray and Gloria exchange looks.
Gloria in particular looks
slightly stunned.
GLORIA
The guidance counselor at Blue Bay?
SANDRA
(sarcastically)
The guidance counselor at Blue Bay.
GLORIA
We understand your feelings, Ms. Van
Ryan.
But please, we'd like some time
with Kelly.
We'd like to take her
statement alone.
Baxter nods, yes.
Sandra looks at Kelly.
SANDRA
Are you okay for this?
Kelly nods.
SANDRA (CONT'D)
The man must be insane to think he can
do this to me...
Tom Baxter takes her by the arm as Ray CROSSES the room to open
the door.
Bryce Hunter walks out with then.
Gloria takes a seat closer to Kelly.
When she speaks, she is
very calm and quiet.
GLORIA
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to
take a break for a minute?
KELLY
(shaking her head)
I just want to get it over with.
My
mom's making me do this. I just want to
forget it.
GLORIA
I know you do.
She waits as Ray sets up a camera on a tripod.
GLORIA (CCNT'D)
We'd like to videotape the statement if
that's all right with you.
Kelly shrugs.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
I know this is not pleasant, Kelly.
But
these are serious charges and we need to
know everything that happened between
you and Mr. Lombardo.
(beat)
Are you ready?
Kelly nods.
CLOSE ON VIDEO MONITOR - KELLY'S STATEMENT
KELLY
He started rubbing my shoulders.
Said
must be sore after washing cars.
I...
let him
I mean he's a nice guy.
(beat)
I don't know... It was so fast.
I
closed my eyes.
I remember his hands
moved to my breasts.
I mean just for a
second it was nice... I forgot whore I
was.
I mean he's so gorgeous...
PULL BACK to REVEAL...
Ray, Gloria and Bryce Hunter stand at one end of the long
conference table, watching the playback of Kelly's tape.
BACK TO VIDEOTAPE
KELLY
The next thing... his hand was in my
shorts... you know, from behind.
His
fingers... his fingers...
GLORIA (O.S.)
Take your time.
KELLY
They were in me.
Both places... you
know.
GLORIA (O.S.)
I understand.
KELLY
He said something like, "Do you want it
dirty7" or something.
(beat)
I tried to turn away, but he pushed me
to the floor.
GLORIA (O.S.)
Was there penetration?
Did he put
himself inside you?
KELLY
Yes.
I said stop.
I screamed.
I mean
that's how it sounded in my head.
He
hurt me...
GLORIA (O.S.)
(as Kelly breaks into
tears)
That's okay, Kelly.
You're doing fine.
(beat)
But I have to ask you something here.
When you say it hurt.
Was this the
first time a man was inside you?
KELLY
No.
I've done it a couple of times, I
mean with guys I dated.
But this
hurt... like, he was built... you
know...
GLORIA (O.S.)
He was large?
Kelly nods, starts to break down again, then holds it off.
GLORIA (O.S., CONT'D)
Did you try to fight him?
KELLY
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me.
I remember my hands were cold.'
GLORIA (O.S.)
Then what?
KELLY
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it
happen."
Then he just stopped.
GLORIA (O.S.)
You mean he withdrew...
KELLY
Not at first.
He was still inside but
he wasn't moving or anything...
He said
we had this secret.
And that now he'd
be able to help me... because we were
close... Something like that.
I don't
know.
It's hard to remember, exactly.
GLORIA (O.S.)
Try, Kelly.
KELLY
I know one thing he said.
It was
when... when he took himself out and was
standing up.
(beat)
He said, "Don't worry, I didn't come."
I can't forget that.
He said, "No
little girl can ever make me come."
The tape is paused -- FREEZES on Kelly's face ON SCREEN.
BACK TO RAY, GLORIA & HUNTER
HUNTER
"No little girl can ever make me come."
Jesus.
Too bad.
We might have some
physical evidence.
Ray and Gloria stare at the screen.
GLORIA
I don't know.
It feels wrong.
Ray and Hunter look at her.
HUNTER
Why?
GLORIA
I think she's acting.
I think she set
it up to be alone with him because she
wanted him to come on to her.
(beat)
I think maybe she's upset that he
didn't...
RAY
Or maybe she thought that was what she
wanted and she got a little more than
she bargained for...
HUNTER
The line I get on this guy, is that he's
done half the women in Blue Bay.
GLORIA
That doesn't make him a child rapist.
(beat)
There's something else.
This girl's had
some problems.
Wrecked a couple of her
mom's cars.
Ran away...
HUNTER
Where's this coming from?
GLORIA
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for
three years.
We had a missing persons
on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe
a year ago... The family kept it out of
the papers.
RAY
That would make it about the time of her
old man's suicide.
You don't think that
could explain some erratic behavior?
GLORIA
All I'm saying is, I think we should go
slow here.
Hunter puts his hands together, thinking.
He looks from Ray to
Gloria, than back to Ray.
HUNTER
I want a full-scale investigation.
GLORIA
You know what that will mean for
Lombardo.
HUNTER
I don't care.
You heard that girl's
statement.
I think he's dirty.
Get me
a case.
Gloria and Ray watch as Hunter gets up and leaves the room.
GLORIA
Well you were a big help.
You know
what's going to happen if we go
full-bore on this.
Ray looks at the screen.
RAY
It's our job, Gloria.
GLORIA
Hunter's making it our job because
Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass.
You know that as well as I do.
(beat)
We're gonna trash this guy's life and I
keep asking myself if it's really
necessary.
Ray thinks this over.
He continues to study the screen.
CLOSE ON SCREEN - KELLY'S FACE
RAY (0.S.)
Yeah, well, maybe you're wrong about
him.
Maybe he's got it coming.
BEGIN MONTAGE - INVESTIGATION
Sam sits at his desk, toying with a pencil.
He watches students
pass -- no smiles, no waves, an occasional dark look.
Through the press of students Sam sees Art at the door of his
office.
The two men look at one another.
At which point...
Gloria, followed by Ray, steps INTO SCENE.
The detectives shake
hands with Art.
As Art turns to close the door, Sam falls within
his line of vision.
Art looks away.
The door swings shut.
Sam sits in a cramped waiting room, leafing through a magazine.
An attractive young SECRETARY sits a few feet away, behind her
desk.
Her PHONE RINGS.
She picks it up, then turns to Sam,
favoring him with a flirtatious smile.
SECRETARY
Mr. Bowden will see you now.
Ken Bowden, a slightly oily-looking young man in a nice suit and
a large, padded neck brace, rises to shake Sam's hand.
KEN
Sam, hey, it's been a while.
(beat)
Looked for you at the ten year reunion.
You missed out.
Three days at the
Disneyworld Hotel... Partied ourselves
silly.
Sam nods.
KEN (CONT'D)
Couple of your old flames were there.
You remember Jill, with the knockers.
Ken holds his hands out in front of his chest.
KEN (CONT'D)
Blew up like the Goodyear blimp.
Sam forces a smile.
KEN (CONT'D)
But check this...
SAM
(interrupting)
Ken.
I'm in some trouble.
I need an
attorney and you're the only one I know.
So I figured I'd start here.
Ken stops, puts on a serious face.
KEN
Well, I'm glad you did.
And I'm sorry.
(folding his hands before
him)
Why don't you tell me about it.
Sam looks at him.
He starts to speak, then checks himself.
SAM
What did you do to your neck?
Ken puts a hand to his throat, as if aware of the brace for the
first time.
KEN
Oh this... chiropractor did a number on
me.
He takes the brace off, tossing it on his desk.
KEN (CONT'D)
I don't really have to wear the thing
all the time.
(beat)
A guy from the insurance was here.
Ken smiles.
Sam looks slightly ill.
KEN (CONT'D)
Go ahead, Sam.
Shoot.
Let's see what
we've got here.
Sam walks across a tiled entry.
He looks tired, but smiles at
the maitre d'.
SAM
Georgie, hey.
I'm meeting Barbara.
She
here yet?
GEORGE looks stiff, maybe a little nervous.
Sam picks up on it.
He scans the room...
ANGLE ON ROOM
Dimly-lit, crowded, but we PICK OUT Barbara, stunning in a
delicate white sun dress, tanned arms resting upon a table.
Sam starts toward her.
George reaches out to touch his arm.
GEORGE
Mr. Lombardo.
Sam ignores him, threading his way among the people at a lavish
bar, then stopping short as he sees who Barbara is with -- her
father, Tom Baxter.
Tom Baxter sees Sam, gets to his feet.
BAXTER
This is not appropriate Lombardo.
Sam steps to one side, makes eye contact with Barbara.
Barbara has tears in her eyes.
She looks at Sam, then shakes her
head, looking away.
SAM
Barbara...
BAZTER
You're finished in Blue Bay, Lombardo.
You've been scratching at the door long
enough...
(as Sam faces him)
I ever see you around my daughter,
you're going to be finished, period.
The two men square off, but already we can SEE Georgie, trailed
by a pair of beefy characters in blue blazers making their way
across the room.
Sam sees them too.
He takes a final look at Barbara.
When she
refuses to meet his eye, he pushes past Baxter, through the crowd
and out of the restaurant.
The air is thick with smoke.
Locals shoot pool.
The walls are
decorated with dusty fishing nets and inflated blowfish.
An aging BARMAID -- good-looking -- once, runs a rag around a
pitcher, looks down the bar, smiles, finding...
Sam, alone, awaiting service.
BARMAID
Sam, honey... Haven't seen you in a
while.
How's life treatin' you?
(off Sam's look)
That bad, huh?
Well, you came to the
right place.
San drives -- a tired face.
Soft MUSIC on the RADIO.
Something APPEARS in the road, caught for a moment in the
headlights.
Sam swerves, whirls his head around, sees...
A GATOR sliding of the shoulder and into the murky water.
Sam lets out some air, relaxing a bit, then catches sight of
something else -- Headlights finding reflection in his rearview
mirror, coming fast.
Sam watches as the lights get closer.
He
looks back to the road -- an approaching curve...
Sam is into the curve when the lights catch him.
A black Range
Rover moves out to pass, then turns suddenly into Sam's lane,
cutting him off.
It happens quickly.
Sam swerves to avoid hitting the larger car,
but the road affords little margin for error.
The JEEP slides across a narrow shoulder, then plummets down a
steep embankment, CRASHING through cattails, rolling over to SLAM
BACK DOWN on its tires in a swampy gulch.
Sam slumps back from the steering wheel.
Somewhere over his head
he can see headlights shining into the trees.
He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM, the SOUNDS of someone scrambling down
the embankment.
Sam tries to get out of his seat harness.
Someone is
approaching, splashing through the muck.
Suddenly a hand reaches
through the broken driver's window, helping him.
MAN'S VOICE
Are you all right?
The hands get him loose.
Sam stumbles from the car.
SAM
Yeah, I'm okay.
He looks up to find -- Frankie Condo, looming over him.
FRANKIE
That's too bad.
He grabs Sam, pulling him OUT OF FRAME.
What we are left with is
the SOUND of FISTS THUDDING INTO FLESH -- then Sam, hitting the
hood of his Jeep, slumping down into the muck.
Frankie is breathing hard.
We HEAR him SLOGGING back up the
embankment.
We HEAR a DOOR SLAM, the RANGE ROVER driving away,
leaving only darkness, and the EERIE SOUNDS of the swamp.
Sam and Ken eye one another over a green plastic table -- Ken
with his neck brace, Sam with a bruised face.
KEN
I figured, you know, it would be darker
in here.
He moves a hand to his face.
SAM
Good thinking.
KEN
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van
Ryan...
SAM
Forget it.
KEN
Lady has some deep pockets.
That's all
I'm saying.
SAM
I know how deep her pockets are, Ken.
I
thought I might be able to save my
fucking house with an equity loan.
Guess who's on the board of directors at
the bank?
He pauses to look at Ken Bowden.
SAM (CONT'D)
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
KEN
Not in here.
Chiropractor comes in here
for lunch sometimes.
San sighs, slumps back in his plastic seat.
KEN (CONT'D)
You're not in bad shape, really.
I know
you think you are, but you're not.
Let
me tell you why.
(beat)
Sandra Van Ryan.
SAM
What's that supposed to mean?
KEN
For you to be getting this kind of heat,
for what they have on you... It doesn't
add up.
Sandra Van Ryan's got 'em
running scared.
(beat)
And I'll tell you something else, you
rush, you get careless.
Ken reaches into his briefcase.
He pulls out some papers, tosses
them on the table.
Sam picks one up, starts to read.
SAM
Nellie Gail Ranch...
KEN
Sound nice?
It's a fucking drug rehab
farm.
It's where Kelly Van Ryan went
when her morn fished her out of the
swamp.
(beat)
Meanwhile, you get educator of the year
I mean there's no way they can put
this thing in front of a jury.
(beat)
Shit, they haven't even taken your
statement yet.
Reason?
They're still
shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're
coming up empty.
Now tell me I'm right.
SAM
There's nothing for them to get.
KEN
Good.
So what we're going to do is
march right to Hunter's doorstep.
We're
going to insist they take a statement.
We're going to tell them to charge your
ass or get off your back.
(beat)
They're walking a fine line here.
Defamation of character, malicious
prosecution...
SAM
I just want my life back...
KEN
Fair enough.
Let's go make a statement.
Everyone's looking a little tired, with the possible exception of
Ray.
At this moment he sits back in his chair, staring at Sam.
RAY
Why don't you tell us one more time, how
Kelly came to be with you, alone in your
house.
SAM
(with growing impatience)
Story's the same, Detective...
Ken pats him on the arm.
When Sam speaks again, it is in a
calmer voice, calm but tired.
SAM (CONT'D)
I had to go look for this coupon.
RAY
The one you bought at school.
SAM
(nodding)
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to
use it.
(beat)
Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.
I
hear a car.
I look out the window.
I
see Nicole driving away.
I leave my
room, and there's Kelly.
RAY
In cutoffs, a wet T-shirt.
SAM
Yes.
RAY
And she wanted to talk.
SAM
Yes.
RAY
But you can't tell us what she wanted to
talk about.
SAM
I could, but it's confidential.
Look,
the point is, we didn't talk.
I told
her this was not an appropriate time or
place.
RAY
And she began to cry.
And you put an
arm around her.
SAM
Yes.
Mainly to turn her toward the
door.
I told her we would talk on
Monday, in the office.
GLORIA
And when you turned her toward the door,
where did you expect her to go, without
a car?
SAM
Again.
I think we covered this.
I told
her I was going to call a cab.
RAY
But she ran away.
SAM
That's right.
GLORIA
Did you call anyone?
Did you call her
house to see if she got home?
Did you
call the Masons?
SAM
No.
GLORIA
Weren't you a little worried about
her...?
SAM
There's a strip mall not half a mile
from my house.
There's phones there.
I
cruised the place, but I didn't see her.
I figured she was probably there but
that she was angry and didn't want to be
found.
I don't know... Maybe I should
have called.
But it's not like Kelly
can't take care of herself.
I figured
we'd just take it up on Monday, in the
office.
There is a moment of silence in the room.
RAY
But you do admit to touching her, to
putting your arm around her.
Isn't that
against the rules?
SAM
It is and I don't.
Ordinarily...
(beat)
But, I mean... there's this kid standing
in front of you crying...
RAY
With a thirty-five inch bustline in a
wet T-shirt with no bra...
He is cut short as Sam shoves his chair back from the table.
SAM
Fuck you.
This is bullshit.
I'm outta
here.
RAY
Sit down, Lombardo.
Sam and Ray stare at one another.
Ken puts a hand on his
client's arm.
KEN
All right, all right... Enough.
Ken stands up.
He walks to the two-way mirror set in one wall,
rapping on the glass with his knuckles.
KEN (CONT'D)
We came down here to make a statement.
We've made it.
(beat)
If you're going to charge my client, do
it now.
stares at Ken's face, about a foot away.
Ken of course can't see
him.
Hunter gives him the finger.
stares into the mirror, waiting.
KEN
I didn't think so.
(to Sam)
Let's go.
Ken opens the door.
Sam turns back to Ray and Gloria.
SAM
I've spent the last ten years of my life
working with kids.
I love what I do,
and I think I'm good at it.
(beat)
These kids trust me, and there is no
way.
No way in hell I would ever betray
that trust.
As Ken and Sam leave, Ray and Gloria are joined by Bryce Hunter.
HUNTER
Nice speech.
Either of you buying?
Ray shrugs.
RAY
Not that stuff about her running away,
him trying to find her.
That's
bullshit.
HUNTER
What about witnesses?
RAY
We've got three.
Guy mowing his yard,
couple of kids playing hoops.
HUNTER
And what do they say?
GLORIA
Same as him.
They saw her come.
They
saw her go.
They saw him follow.
RAY
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't
catch up with her.
I mean how long does
it take to put on a shirt?
At which point, a COP APPEARS in the doorway.
COP
Phone, Bryce.
It's Sandra Van Ryan.
HUNTER
Christ Almighty.
That woman's calling
me six times a day.
He starts away, then stops.
HUNTER (CONT'D)
I think you're onto something, Ray.
Stay with it.
Hunter bangs out of the room.
Gloria slumps in a chair, tired,
disgusted.
GLORIA
We failed to mention the mower guy's a
drunk, that he was after more beer and
never really saw Kelly go into the
house, so he can't say how long she was
in there.
Same with the kids.
They saw
her running down the street, but that's
it.
(beat)
With no physical evidence, what do we
have?
Her word against his.
RAY
You're telling me you believe the guy?
GLORIA
All I'm saying is, we let Sandra Van
Ryan push us too hard, we're going to
wind up looking stupid.
Ray is paged by his BEEPER.
He pulls it off his belt, looks at
the number.
RAY
I'd better return this.
Ray leaves.
Gloria pulls a cigarette from her purse and lights
up, rests her head back in the chair, blowing smoke at the
ceiling.
Gloria is grinding out the butt as Ray walks back in.
There is
something in the way he carries himself, some sense of urgency.
RAY
(off Gloria's look)
Seen any good gator wrestling lately?
Ray and Gloria drive through the Everglades, past marshlands
punctuated by thick stands of melaluca trees.
GLORIA
They say it was old man Van Ryan planted
the melalucas to dry up the swamp.
Ray nods.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
You can go up to one of those trees and
peel the bark.
You know what you get?
More bark.
And more bark.
There's no
core.
Tree's not good tar anything but
sucking up water.
And now they can't
get rid of them.
They've tried poisons.
Nothing works.
They don't die.
RAY
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.
I don't
imagine he gives a shit now.
Gloria just looks at him.
Ray stares into the dusty light of an
approaching sunset.
At last he slows, turning off the highway
and onto a narrow dirt road.
A sign pokes out from the tall grass -- "SMILIN' JACK'S FISH
CAMP."
The Taurus bounces along the washboard road.
GLORIA
You're sure we're not lost?
They are driving now at the edge of a canal.
RAY
You remember that little girl walked out
of our talk at Blue Bay?
GLORIA
The skinny brunette.
RAY
This is where she lives.
She wants to
talk.
(beat)
Beats the shit out of me why she would
call me at all.
I busted her once for
possession.
she wound up doing about
six months at Camp Nine.
GLORIA
You mean Camp Sixty-Nine.
Ray gives her a look.
Gloria shrugs.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
That's what they called it when I was in
Juvenile.
It's a pretty dismal place.
RAY
It's a shithole.
But she was dirty,
what was I gonna do?
They pass a sagging chain-link fence, entering a quarter-mile run
of shabby trailers and cheap shacks.
The squalor of the buildings is seat in contrast to the beauty of
the Glades where the waters have gone to the color of polished
brass beneath an immense, darkening sky.
Ray parks before a ramshackle building covered in vines and
peeling paint.
A sign reads:
"NIGHT CRAWLERS $1 A BUCKET."
The
jawbones of numerous gators hang beneath the eaves.
As they get out of the car, something catches Gloria's eye --
along the bank of the canal...
ANGLE ON BANK
where a tall man (WALTER) with long white hair and tattooed arms
kneels inside a pen, slapping a huge gator on its snout.
The
reptile lifts its upper body, hissing, opening its jaws.
Walter takes a stick from his hip pocket, passing it through the
gator's mouth.
The jaws snap shut, incredibly fast, with a
hollow snapping sound.
Gloria jumps instinctively, then watches, aghast, as Walter slaps
the creature once more.
This time moving round to the front of
the gator, sticking halt his arm inside its mouth.
VOICE (0.5.)
He's just showin' off for you now.
Gloria starts, then turns to find a woman (RUBY) has walked up
beside her.
The woman is in her sixties.
She's dressed in
polyester.
Her hair is piled on top of her head -- too dark to
be anything but a dye job.
A cigarette bobs from her lips.
Before Gloria can respond, Ray steps up behind than.
RAY
Evening Ruby.
(beat)
I see you still got Walter.
I was sort
of hoping something had eaten him by
now.
RUBY
(a long beat)
Can I help you with something?
Ray and the old lady look at each other.
RAY
Suzie called.
You know where we can
find her?
Ruby looks toward the store.
RUBY
You know the way.
She watches as the detectives CROSS the road, then calls to them
as they start up the steps.
RUBY (CONT'D)
You won't shoot her will you?
I don't
believe she's armed.
Gloria turns, surprised.
Ray gives the woman a long, cold stare,
then opens the door for Gloria.
It's dark inside.
The main light source is a tiny, beat-up
black-and-white TV.
Two elderly women in colored bouffant hairdos sit on a ratty old
couch watching reruns of "Family Feud."
They look up as Ray and
Gloria ENTER then EXIT through a door in the back.
Black walls.
Cheap bookshelves, filled to overflowing.
A wire
strung with dismembered doll parts runs the length of the room.
Suzie is propped on a ratty futon, an open book on her stomach,
her thin, white arms crossed behind her head.
SUZIE
Jesus.
It took you long enough.
What
if somebody was trying to strangle me?
Or fuck me in the ass, even?
(beat)
I mean, you guys are Sex Crimes.
Ray manages a thin smile.
RAY
Meet my partner, Gloria Perez.
SUZIE
I did.
At Blue Balls.
GLORIA
Seems to me you left early, before we
could meet.
But hi, Suzie.
Gloria puts out a hand.
Suzie looks at it, puts out a hand of
her own.
As the women shake, Gloria looks at the book on Suzie's stomach,
turning her head as if to read the title.
SUZIE
It's Celine.
He's okay.
He had a
pretty good line on what cheap fucks
people are.
RAY
So Suzie, you called us, remember?
Suzie takes a cigarette from a pack at her side, lights up, blows
smoke at the ceiling.
SUZIE
Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?
Ray and Gloria exchange looks.
RAY
No.
SUZIE
Will they?
RAY
It doesn't look like it.
SUZIE
Then he'll be back at Blue Balls?
Ray shrugs.
GLORIA
That bothers you?
SUZIE
(a long beat)
Yeah, maybe, a little.
GLORIA
Why is that?
Suzie lets out her breath.
She rests her head against the wall.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
You can talk to us, Suzie.
That's why
we're here...
Suzie, Gloria and Hunter sit at the conference table.
Ray
operates the video cam.
GLORIA
Okay, Suzie.
We want you to tell us
about the day Mr. Lombardo gave you and
Jimmy a ride.
Suzie stares at the three cops around her, then at the camera.
SUZIE
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me
on the fucking news.
GLORIA
We need to tape the interview, Suzie.
No one will see it but us.
(beat)
Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo
gave you the ride?
Suzie stares at the camera.
She's lost the cockiness she had on
her own turf.
She looks small, white and frail in the sterile
room, surrounded by the detectives.
SUZIE
About a year ago.
GLORIA
He dropped Jimmy off first?
SUZIE
Yeah.
GLORIA
And when he arrived at your house, was
anyone there?
SUZIE
No.
GLORIA
So you were alone.
SUZIE
Yes.
GLORIA
Did he come in with you?
SUZIE
I guess.
HUNTER
You guess?
Did he or didn't he?
SUZIE
Yeah... okay... he did
HUNTER
And then what... he touched you?
Did
you maybe flirt a little...
SUZIE
I wanna go home now.
Gloria glares at Hunter, shakes her head.
GLORIA
Suzie, look, I know you feel bad.
I
know it's harder to talk here than in
your room, but we need to get it on
tape.
(beat)
Just tell us what you told us before.
Tell us the truth.
Suzie huddles in her skinny arms, studying the detectives.
SUZIE
I didn't say a thing to him.
He just
put his arm around me.
Told me I was
pretty... I could be really pretty, he
said.
Another moment -- she looks at Ray, then at Hunter.
HUNTER
What did you do then?
SUZIE
(a long beat)
Shit, what difference does it make...
Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
HUNTER
Suzie!
Did this man rape you?
SUZIE
Okay!
He did.
He pushed me to the
floor and he did it to me.
Now, can I
go home?
She stands up.
GLORIA
At that point were you able to fight him
off?
SUZIE
No.
He stopped by himself.
Okay?
That's all.
Let me go.
Gloria gets to her feet as well; she tries to put an arm around
Suzie.
The girl jumps back as if she has been shocked.
SUZIE (CONT'D)
Don't touch me.
Gloria's hands fall to her sides.
Suzie heads for the door.
The detectives exchange looks.
At which point, Suzie stops, turns to face the room.
SUZIE (CONT'D)
He did say something.
GLORIA
What was that?
SUZIE
He said, "No little bitch can ever make
me come."
THE SLIDING BAR DOOR
of a jail SLAMS shut on Sam Lombardo.
He turns to...
TWO menacing PRISONERS.
PRISONER
So you're the new chicken licker.
CUT TO:
COURT TV IMAGE
The graphic -- "Prime Time Justice" -- then the anchor --
CYNTHIA.
CYNTHIA (TV)
Today from Superior Court in Miami,
Florida -- Dade County versus Samuel J.
Lonbardo.
PULL BACK to REVEAL...
Art, students, faculty members huddle around the TV.
CYNTHIA (TV, CONT'D)
The Lonbardo rape case has galvanized
the upscale town of Blue Bay...
Bryce Hunter confers with his team.
Ken in his neck brace, ENTERS with Sam and a bailiff.
Sam wears
a suit.
Re's clean-shaven, recovered from the car wreck and
beating.
Still, there is a weariness about him we have not seen
before.
He makes eye contact with Sandra -- a cold stare.
CYNTHIA (V.0., CONT'D)
In the end, the prosecution's case will
come down to...
Hunter in front of the jury.
HUNTER
... what happened to Kelly Lanier Van
Ryan and Susan Marie Toller that will
forever change the lives of these two
young women?
What happened in those
fifteen minutes alone with Samuel
Lombardo?
CLOSE ON SAM
The dark, seductive eyes.
Suzie, nervous, paces the floor, stops, lights a cigarette.
The other witnesses sit in chairs along the wail -- the lawn
mower man, cul-de-sac kids, Barbara, Nicole, as...
IN THE COURTROOM
Kelly Van Ryan sits in the witness box, dabbing her eyes with a
handkerchief while Bryce Hunter stands before her.
The room is
silent, the spectators riveted on the scene.
HUNTER
Do you need more time?
Kelly shakes her head, no.
HUNTER (CONT'D)
I know this is hard, Kelly, but I have
just one more question and even though
its something we've been over, I want us
all to be very clear about it.
(a long beat)
When you made the decision to stay at
Mr. Lombardo's house, after he had
offered you a ride.
When you saw that
he intended to have sex with you, what
were your exact words?
What did you
say?
KELLY
I told him, no.
I said stop, Mr.
Lombardo, please... I screamed for him
to stop...
HUNTER
And did he?
Kelly looks defiantly at the courtroom.
KELLY
No.
He raped me on the floor of his
shitty house.
CUT TO:
WITNESS WAITING ROOM - SAME - SUZIE
still pacing, as Ray and Gloria ENTER the room.
Suzie shoots them a nervous glance, drops her cigarette, bends to
pick it up, burns her fingers, drops it again.
She curses
beneath her breath, wrapping her fingers about her shoulders.
Ray and Gloria watch her, exchange glances.
Gloria picks up
Suzie's cigarette for her, puts it out in an ashtray.
GLORIA
You've got nothing to be scared of,
Suzie, just take a deep breath.
PANNING the spectators, we SEE Sandra, Baxter, Ray, Gloria.
Hunter is on the witness stand.
Suzie is in the box.
She looks pale, even more nervous.
SUZIE
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop
him... it hurt.
HUNTER
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?
Why?
SUZIE
Because... it was the biggest I've ever
seen.
And I've seen a lot on their way
through Jack's Fish Camp.
Chuckling in the courtroom.
The JUDGE glares, silencing it.
HUNTER
Ms. Toller, did Samuel Lombardo rape you
in your family's home on the 23rd of
April last year?
Suzie glances at Sam, hesitates.
HUNTER (CONT'D)
Ms. Toller?
SUZIE
I said he did.
HUNTER
Ms. Toller.
I'm asking you now, under
oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
Suzie looks around, as if for help.
The spectators stir.
Ray rubs his eyes.
Gloria's are closed.
SUZIE
This wasn't my idea.
HUNTER
I'm sorry?
Suzie looks at Sam once more.
SUZIE
Look.
I just don't want to get into any
more trouble...
Tom Baxter rises to his feet.
The Judge raises a hand, motioning
him to sit back down.
JUDGE
(to Baxter)
The Court would like to hear what Miss
Toller has to say.
(to Suzie)
Miss Toller.
SUZIE
Mr. Lombardo didn't rape me.
He didn't
rape Kelly either.
He didn't do
anything.
QUICK CUTS
Hunter slumps back against the prosecution table.
Sandra's hand covers her mouth.
Baxter mumbles a curse.
Sam hangs his head in relief.
Ken grins above his neck brace.
COURTROOM LOBBY
The press corps scrambles for cameras.
BLUE BAY HIGS
Teachers, students, Art, Jimmy -- crammed around the TV.
JIMMY
I don't believe it...
IN THE COURTROOM
Bryce Hunter and Tom Baxter are both on their feet, trying to
make themselves heard above the din.
HUNTER
Your Honor... I must object...
JUDGE
(hammering for order)
I think I made it plain that the Court
intends to near Miss Toller's story.
The Judge turns a cold eye on Suzie.
SUZIE
I'm sorry.
JUDGE
Sorry?
Just how far did you intend to
let this go?
SUZIE
I don't know.
I just wanted to hurt Mr.
Lombardo.
Sam looks up, confused.
SUZIE (CONT'D)
He was my friend at first.
Then I got
busted... he didn't even stick up for
me.
I had to go away to that hellhole.
It's like, you're his favorite, then who
cares?
You wanna know something?
When
Kelly said we should do this, I thought
cool, all these big shots screwing me
over, like that cop, Duquette.
Now
they're gonna get screwed.
HUNTER
Your Honor... Please...
JUDGE
Any more interruptions Mr. Hunter, and
the Court will hold you in contempt.
(to Suzie)
What you are telling me, Ms. Toller, is
that Kelly Van Ryan is responsible for
conceiving this entire charade...
SUZIE
Kelly's pissed at Mr. Lombardo, too.
She's in love with him.
I mean her
whole fantasy is him since her old man
died.
Then she found out that Mr.
Lombardo was doing her mom.
I mean that
was it...
Gasps in the court as --
Kelly BURSTS from the witness waiting room, trailed by a bailiff.
KELLY
You stupid little bitch...
She grabs the first thing she can get her hands on -- a glass of
water from one of the tables and hurls it toward the witness
stand before the bailiff can pin her arms against her sides.
A mob scene.
Video crews are herded to one side by bailiffs as
Sandra and Baxter, with Kelly in tow, move toward a side door.
Sam and Ken round a corner, followed by Ray and Gloria who walk
on either side of Suzie.
Kelly sees them.
She makes a run at Suzie.
For a moment the
girls shove and kick but Ray and Gloria are between them in a
hurry, pulling then apart as Baxter arrives to take charge of
Kelly, pulling her toward the door.
Ruby and Walter arrive now too.
Suzie runs to them and they lead
her through the crowd, Walter pushing people aside with his long,
tattooed arms.
Gloria heaves a sigh.
Ray pushes a hand through his hair, then
turns to find Sam looking at him.
Most of the press have run off
to follow the girls -- looking for more action.
It is a quiet
moment.
The two men lock eyes.
SAM
I've found that adolescents make the
best liars.
They're old enough to be
good at it, but you want like hell to
believe them, because they're still
children.
Ray just looks at him -- a hard stare.
top down, speeds on a highway, banana palms on one side, the blue
Atlantic on the other.
Wind buffets Ken and Sam -- who has a dazed look.
KEN
(hyped)
Come on, let loose!
SAM
I was just thinking about where I'm
gonna stay.
I lost the house.
It's
like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
KEN
You'll get over it. We've got a
knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a
lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
SAM
Just like that?
KEN
Just like that?
These people ruined
your life, bro.
Ken pauses to thump the wheel with the butt of his hand.
KEN (CONT'D)
I told you they were going overboard and
they did... They'll settle.
Believe me.
They'll be begging to settle...
At which point Ken spots something up ahead.
His smile broadens.
He swerves into the other lane, tooting his horn, waving, as...
The T-bird draws even with a sleek black limo.
SAM
You don't think you're overdoing it?
He pulls off his neck brace, dangles it in front of Sam's face,
then tosses it out the window.
Tom Baxter watches as the T-bird rockets off into the distance, a
white piece of foam rubber bouncing across the road in its wake.
A console TV is on -- news of the courthouse chaos.
Sandra is next to Baxter.
Kelly is on the opposite bench seat.
SANDRA
I hope you're going to nail his scrotum
to the nearest wall.
BAXTER
That might have been a possibility, if
little miss not-so-bright here hadn't
started throwing things.
KELLY
Fuck off.
Sandra lunges to slap Kelly.
Baxter stops it in midair.
BAXTER
See what I mean...
SANDRA
You're going to let them get away with
this... this shit?
On the word of one
little white trash bitch...
BAXTER
You like seeing your name in the papers?
Sandra glares at him.
BAXTER (CONT'D)
Leave town, Sandy.
Go to your place in
St. Barts.
Let things cool down.
Sandra concentrates on the TV.
BAXTER (CONT'D)
They'll try for twenty million.
The
cheaper the lawyer, the higher the
demand.
SANDRA
You've got to be kidding.
HAXTER
The man's life has been destroyed.
There will always be doubters, no matter
what happened in court.
SANDRA
I'm not paying any idiot twenty million
dollars.
BAXTER
I said that's what they'd ask for.
Sandra stares from the window.
At last she turns to Kelly.
SANDRA
I hope you're happy.
Kelly seems to give this a moment's thought, then, smiling.
KELLY
Ecstatic.
Ken's Secretary opens the inner office door for Baxter.
Ken rises from a desk to greet him.
KEN
Tom Baxter.
Good to see you again.
BAXTER
Let's cut the crap.
What does your
client want?
KEN
Besides an apology?
BAXTER
Unless you're planning on leaving Blue
Bay, there's gonna be other cases, other
days... You might want to keep that in
mind.
KEN
Okay Tom.
My client wants your client
to saddle up... so we can ride her ass
all the way to the bank.
working at his desk.
Sam's terrarium is behind him, his
"Educator of the Year" Waterford bowl, a storage box of files.
Art looks up at a KNOCK on the DOOR.
Sam walks into the room.
It is a slightly awkward moment.
SAM
Lizards don't seem to miss me.
The two men smile, breaking the tension.
SAM (CONT'D)
How you doing, Artie?
ART
I... You know... I...
Sam waves him off.
SAM
Take care of my lizards, Art.
Art stands up.
The two men shake hands.
OUTSIDE GUIDANCE OFFICE
Sam comes out, then stops suddenly.
Kelly waits for him.
Kirk and Nicole are with her.
A long
moment.
SAM
Kelly...
KELLY
Drop dead... You know where my mom is
trying to get the money to pay you off?
She's trying to break my trust.
How do
you like that?
I can't touch it until
she's dead and she won't give me a dime
and now she's trying to break it to pay
you...
SAM
Look, Kelly... I'm sorry... I know what
you've been through... I should've seen
something like this coning.
Art APPEARS in the door behind Sam.
Kelly cones closer.
KELLY
Why don't you start fucking her again.
You can spend it together.
Kirk tries to take Kelly's arm.
She jerks away, swings at Sam.
He ducks, dropping the Waterford BOWL, which SHATTERS upon the
floor.
Kirk bear-hugs Kelly.
She throws a notebook at Sam.
KELLY (CONT'D)
I hate you!
She starts crying.
Kirk and Nicole drag her away as a crowd
gathers.
Sam, shaken, kneels over the broken crystal.
Art bends to help
him pick up the pieces.
SAM
You see.
I couldn't stay, even if I
wanted to.
Baxter, Ken, Sandra, Frankie stand watching, as Sam signs papers.
At last Sam looks up, faces Sandra -- not a happy moment.
Sandra gives him a long, hard stare, then walks from the room.
Frankie prepares to follow her, then stops, looks at Sam.
FRANKIE
I'll be seeing you.
Sam just looks at him.
The big man leaves.
Baxter closes his
briefcase.
KEN
So long, Tom.
Come by sometime.
We'll
have lunch at the Beef Bowl.
Baxter stops, gives him a cold look, then a surprising smile.
BAXTER
I don't think you're gonna be eating at
the Beef Bowl anymore, kid.
He EXITS.
Ken goes apeshit -- whoops, dances around the desk,
drops into his chair, holds up the documents.
Sam watches, smiling, finally.
SAM
Thanks Ken, you did okay.
Both men stand, they shake hands.
Ken claps him on the arm.
KEN
(no clowning now)
Look, I know there's a part of you
wishes none of this had happened.
But
it did.
Now take the money and get out
of here.
Find a happy place.
DISSOLVE TO:
The neon's green light slashes across the dark walls through old
Venetian blinds.
Sam ENTERS, puts the file box on the floor.
Arches a sore back.
He reaches for a bedside lamp, stops, listens, decides it's
nothing, reaches again for the lamp, stops again, listening...
BZZZZZ -- the high-pitched WHINE of a MOSQUITO.
Then more -- a
flurry of BZZZZZZZZS
Sam frowns, sees...
A cloud of mosquitoes circling him.
He checks the front windows -- closed.
He goes around the bed.
The slightly ajar bathroom door with full-length mirror comes up
on his right.
Ahead is a rear window -- wide open.
Sam stops fast.
Thinks.
Lets out a breath.
SAM
Damn maid.
He steps to the window.
He looks down --
Muddy footprints.
Sam freezes.
He whirls around --
A sudden green FACE APPEARS in the big mirror -- like a nightmare
image -- lit by the neon flash, then DISAPPEARS.
Sam jumps back.
SAM
Ahhhh!
The neon green face flashes again in the mirror -- DISAPPEARS.
Now the bathroom door slowly opens all the way.
Sam backs up, hits the wall.
Kelly Van Ryan steps out of the bathroom, a long object held at
her side, wrapped in a towel.
SAM
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
KELLY
So you got my mom's money.
Sam tries to breathe, manages a nod.
KELLY (CONT'D)
How much?
Kelly prods him with the concealed object.
KELLY (CONT'D)
How much?
SAM
About six and a half million dollars.
Kelly raises the abject covered by the towel, aims it at Sam.
KELLY
Your turn to pay.
A moment -- then she yanks the towel away to REVEAL --
--
a two-foot-long novelty penis with giant balls.
Her hand
grips the acrylic scrotum like the butt of a gun.
KELLY (CONT'D)
King Dong!
That's you, Sam!
She screams with joy, vaults into his arms, wraps those perfect
thighs around him.
The dildo goes flying.
They fall on the bed.
KELLY (CONT'D)
It worked!
We screwed the bitch!
She's all over him now -- tongue kisses.
KELLY CCONT'D)
It worked just like you said it would.
He kisses her, finally gets her to sit, straddling him.
SAM
God, you scared the shit out of me.
You
must be crazy coming here.
KELLY
Of course I'm crazy.
Ask my mom.
She kisses him again, more passionately now.
He gets into it,
tears her blouse open, putting his tongue to her breasts.
A SHADOW moves on the wall, looming above them.
Sam sees it, his
eyes widen.
He tries to sit up, as...
BANG! -- an EXPLOSION.
Sam jumps, knocks Kelly to his side.
A champagne cork hits the ceiling.
Suzie Toller stands over the bed with a foaming champagne bottle.
SUZIE
How much is about six and a half million
divided by three?
SAM
Jesus.
Two million one hundred
thirty-three thousand three hundred
thirty-three and change.
Kelly screams in joy again.
SAM (CONT'D)
Now calm down.
Both of you.
The girls put on mock serious expressions.
SAM (CONT'D)
From now on, if we're seen together,
it's got to be accidental.
I thought
that was understood...
KELLY
Hey, come on... We've got to have at
least one victory party.
Kelly grabs the champagne, takes a long gulp, pours some on her
breasts as she straddles Sam once more, inviting him to lick them
clean.
SAM
Kelly, for christ's sake...
She has begun to move like a lap dancer, inviting him to take her
breasts in his mouth, putting a hand to his crotch...
SAM (CONT'D)
The only way we're gonna blow this now,
is if we do it ourselves...
KELLY
(her hand in his crotch)
Do it to ourselves?
SAM
(weakening)
We have to stick with the plan.
KELLY
Stick?
Sam gives up, lays back as Kelly undoes his pants, then moves to
get him inside her.
Suzie watches.
She takes another drink, then tosses the bottle,
pulling off her top, REVEALING her small, white breasts, a couple
of tattoos, a pierced nipple.
She slips behind Kelly, fondling
Kelly's breasts as Sam arches beneath them both -- all of them
totally into it now, losing themselves in the sex...
FADE TO:
The room is dark and empty, with the exception of a single desk
lamp, by which halo we find...
Ray Duquette, in an aloha shirt, waiting as his computer's
printer finishes a job, as suddenly...
... a new light rushes into the room.
Ray turns to find Gloria
standing in the doorway.
He stops as his printer finishes the
job.
He pulls out the paper, looks at it, smiles.
Gloria walks
to his desk.
RAY
You saw the news today?
GLORIA
Lombardo's settlement?
Ray nods.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
Yeah, well, I told you they were gonna
make us look stupid.
Ray gives her a long look.
Gloria waits a moment, shrugs.
RAY
Hey, don't back away from it, you were
right.
We did look stupid.
(beat)
What you were wrong about, is who made
us look that way.
Gloria just looks at him, puzzled.
RAY (CONT'D)
Think back, before the suit was filed,
before the trial.
Lombardo had an
affair with Sandra, right?
(Gloria nods)
So why not tell us about the affair?
I
mean it could be a hell of a motive for
Kelly to fabricate her charge in the
first place.
GLORIA
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the
affair for the trial.
RAY
I thought of that.
Then I said, come
on, you're Lombardo.
Your reputation is
getting trashed.
You want to stop the
bleeding.
You don't want to sit in jail
for three months.
Unless...
GLORIA
Unless what?
RAY
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan
for the big payday.
It is quiet in the office, save for the soft BUZZ of Ray's
COMPUTER.
RAY (CONT'D)
They chumped us, Gloria, right from the
start.
GLORIA
Why?
You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty
good already, nice job in a beautiful
setting, popular, an active social life.
(beat)
He's gonna put this all on the line for
some dicey play like what you're
describing...
RAY
(interrupting)
The job looks okay to us.
But look at
it from his point of view.
The man's
surrounded by wealth and privilege.
But
for him... it's just a reminder of what
should have been his.
Gloria gives this a moment's thought.
RAY (CONT'D)
Your old man graduates from Blue Bay
School, you're not supposed to wind up
there.
Board of Directors maybe, but
not in the lousy guidance office.
Now.
Point number two.
(he taps at the printout
on his desk)
I've run a financial on Lombardo.
Guy
was eyeball-deep in debt before this all
happened -- trying to keep up with
pricey trim like Barbara Baxter.
He passes the printout to Gloria.
She looks at it, thinking.
GLORIA
So what about the girls?
Suzie's poor,
but why would Kelly have to steal from
her own mother?
Surely her father...
RAY
(interrupting)
Her father didn't leave her squat.
The
kid's got money in trust from her
grandfather, but she can't touch that
till her mother dies and Sandra seems to
have the idea that Kelly ought to learn
the value of a buck.
Gloria looks over Lombardo's financial once more, tosses it on
the desk, then studies Ray -- long beat.
GLORIA
This one's got you working overtime,
hasn't it?
RAY
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.
He's
dirty.
And I'll tell you something
else.
You want to know how old man
Lombardo lost his money?
(beat)
He was fucked out of it by old man Van
Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt
Creek Land Deal.
(beat)
It was after the war.
Van Ryan set up a
corporation to develop swamp land, got
investors like Lombardo to put up money,
then turned around and got the state to
declare the area an ecological preserve,
on the sly, of course, but everyone knew
it was him.
The freeway went to the
coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
GLORIA
Eliminate the competition.
RAY
You got it.
The rich got richer.
While
the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in
the swamp.
Gloria looks at him a long moment.
GLORIA
Where'd you come up with this stuff,
anyway?
RAY
(a long beat; then
beneath a smile)
I net a guy in a bar.
Girls in tank suits finish laps, towel off.
As the girls begin
to walk toward the lockers, they encounter...
Ray Duquette, threading his way among the girls, his eye on...
Kelly, alone on the deck, still dripping -- a Botticelli vision.
RAY (O.S.)
Nice stroke.
Kelly, startled, turns to find Ray walking toward her across the
deck.
She snatches a towel from one of the racing platforms and
begins to dry herself, wrapping the towel around her.
KELLY
Is there some reason why you're here?
RAY
Curiosity, I guess.
KELLY
About what?
How to improve your breast
stroke?
Ray gives her a cold smile.
RAY
Actually, I was curious about how you
see things working out, for you, Sam and
Suzie.
This appears to give her pause, a moment of hesitation.
KELLY
Excuse me?
RAY
You all gonna go down to the Caribbean
together?
Kelly looks around the pool area.
A number of girls are watching
from a corner of the deck, but no one is close enough to hear.
RAY (CONT'D)
The thing about it is, threesomes so
rarely work out.
KELLY
You're out of your mind.
RAY
I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.
(beat)
It's hard enough for one person to keep
a secret, let alone three.
And then
there's the love angle.
I mean do you
and Sam really want that little
pill-head around, now that you have the
money?
Kelly starts to walk away.
Ray cuts her off.
RAY (CONT'D)
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea
right up front, of whacking Suzie?
That's murder, Kelly.
KELLY
Police -- God -- get a life.
She moves around him and walks calmly away.
RAY
(loud enough to make
himself heard)
You're good.
But you don't think that
little ditz Suzie's gonna hold together,
do you?
Kelly continues to walk, her face giving nothing away, as Ray's
WORDS ECHO over the pool.
Suzie cones in fast, grabs the phone, punches out a number.
SAM (V.0.)
(answering machine)
This is Sam.
I'm not in right now...
parked behind some cottonwoods in a small launch area where the
highway crosses both the canal and the road to the fish camp.
The skiff has been shoved into the bed.
Ray sits at the wheel.
He removes his glasses, wipes his face with a handkerchief, then
starts at the uneven 50UNDS of a tired ENGINE, looks up to see...
HEADLIGHTS
Suzie's VW bouncing along the dirt road, turning onto the
highway.
RAY'S TRUCK - RAY
watching, then starting his truck and pulling out onto the
highway, following the tiny red lights of Suzie's bug.
SXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - MAIN GATE - NIGHT
Suzie's VW idles.
She leans out the window, talks to the
intercom, the gate opens.
The VW ENTERS.
The gate closes.
Ray's pickup drives past.
He drives to a big lot where one of
the mansions has been torn down.
He drives up onto the dirt,
keeps going, right down to the water's edge where he pulls his
little skiff out of the back once more.
He walks back to the truck, pulls off his sport coat, hangs a
Hi-8 video camera over his shoulder and wades out into the calm
waters of the bay, pushing the skiff, then climbing in.
The bedside lamp is on.
Sam is on the phone.
SAM
Kelly.
Is Suzie there?
KELLY (V.O.)
Yes.
SAM
Shit.
I was afraid of that.
She left
this garbled message on my machine.
(beat)
Can you calm her down?
KELLY (V.0.)
Why can't you come...
SAM
No!
Christ.
Listen, Kelly, I'm
counting on you.
You calm her down.
I mean do whatever you have to, whatever
it takes...
KELLY (V.O.)
You know what it takes.
SAM
Then do it.
I need you on this Kelly.
Do it tonight.
We'll figure something
out... Okay?
SAM
Okay.
I want you to hear this too.
We've got to be cool.
All of us.
People think I'm rich, for Christ's
sake.
I'm doing what rich guys do.
(beat)
I'm spending my money.
It's more
suspicious if I sit around doing
nothing.
Now don't let this cop fuck
with your minds.
Gloria, Ray, Hunter watch the tape.
Hunter's seen enough.
He
slams the stop/tape.
HUNTER
Are you crazy, Ray?
RAY
You heard Kelly say "Sam."
That was
Lombardo on the phone.
And you saw the
girls...
HUNTER
Ray.
The conversation on this tape is
totally unintelligible.
(beat)
What we have here, is you on the Van
Ryan property, without a proper warrant,
shooting a porn flick...
RAY
I don't believe I'm hearing this.
A
month ago you were pulling these two
apart at the courthouse.
(beat)
They were acting.
They were all acting,
from the beginning.
And we bought it,
hook, line and sinker... And now they're
home free with six million of Sandra Van
Ryan's money.
GLORIA
Which she might have saved, if she
hadn't set out to destroy the man's
life.
RAY
(turning now on Gloria)
What?
You wouldn't go after some guy
you thought raped your daughter?
(beat)
Cone on.
She bought the same story we
did...
Ray stops as Hunter brings the palm of his hand down on the table
a loud SLAP.
HUNTER
Listen, both of you.
You're not on a
case.
There is no fucking case.
(beat)
I've had it up to here with Sandra Van
Ryan.
Ray, you keep mucking around like
this and you are going to have her suing
us for invasion of privacy.
Get out of
these people's lives.
(beat)
Am I getting through on this?
Ray walks to the door, jerks it open --
Sam, angry, sits in the corridor with a uniformed officer.
Hunter sees Sam, rolls his eyes.
HUNTER
Oh, Ray... no...
RAY
You think this is just about money,
about us looking foolish?
Question him.
You're gonna find a stone cold
manipulative psychopath.
And those
girls are going to wind up dead...
Sam lunges at Ray.
The officer and Hunter restrain him.
Gloria
looks on, taken aback by Ray's accusations, Sam's response.
HUNTER
Mr. Lombardo, please.
I'm sorry about
this.
SAM
Give this idiot something to do.
Let
him look into the Kennedy assassination.
Ray flares, grabs Sam, shoves him against the wall, before they
can be separated once again.
SAM (CCNT'D)
(to Hunter)
Next time this guy drags me down here,
I'll sue you.
You're goddamn lucky I
didn't sue you the first time!
Sam storms from the room, followed by Hunter.
Ray stares after
them, finally he turns, looks at Gloria, collecting himself.
RAY
Guess I kind of lost it there.
GLORIA
You could say that.
RAY
Were you ever in a situation where you
could see a thing coming and you didn't
do what you could to stop it?
Gloria studies Ray, clearly concerned.
GLORIA
We all have...
RAY
I mean something bad, Gloria, something
bad you saw coning, and you didn't do
anything, and then it happened.
(off Gloria's silence)
I did that once.
I don't want to do it
again.
seated at the wheel, parks, stares toward the mall entrance.
ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV
Sam and Barbara stand in the orange light, hand-in-hand.
Barbara
leans forward, kisses Sam on the lips.
CLOSE ON KELLY
lost in thought, when she is startled by a sudden CACOPHONY of
ENGINE NOISE.
She turns to find...
Suzie's BUG, SPLUTTERING and BELCHING smoke, parks next to her.
Suzie opens the door of the Rover, jumps in.
She's wearing a
black ball cap, armed with a huge straw bag.
As she settles in
the seat, she lets out a long breath.
Kelly makes a face, fans the air.
KELLY
Jesus.
What are you drinking?
Suzie laughs, pulls a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 from the bag.
KELLY (CONT'D)
(looking at the bottle)
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will
rot your brain?
SUZIE
What brain?
Suzie takes a big drink.
Kelly shakes her head, looks back
toward the entrance.
ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV
empty.
Sam and Barbara are gone.
Kelly continues to stare.
SUZIE
What are you looking at?
KELLY
(starting the car)
Nothing.
Kelly turns off the engine.
Suzie tokes on a joint, swills the
MD 20/20.
She gazes upon the sea, eyes at half-mast.
SUZIE
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
KELLY
I think we just need to get wasted.
Suzie shrugs, gets out.
Kelly gets out with her.
Suzie
staggers.
Kelly circles her with an arm, looks nervously around,
begins leading her down the beach.
SUZIE
I wanna live at the beach someday.
KELLY
Shit.
She stops walking.
Suzie takes a few more steps then turns to
look at her.
KELLY (CONT'D)
I left the keys.
I'll get 'em.
Suzie plops down on the sand, drinks from the bottle.
She
watches Kelly fading into the darkness, mumbles something beneath
her breath, then lies on her back.
SUZIE'S POV - THE NIGHT SKY
The SOUND of CRASHING WAVES.
She rolls to one side, looking down
the beach
Murky blackness.
She tries to focus, sits up.
SUZIE
Kelly?
She stands -- wobbly -- peers down the beach.
A shape EMERGES in the blackness, moving toward her.
SUZIE (CONT'D)
Kelly?
The shape gets closer and closer, until...
Sam Lombardo steps up to loom over Suzie.
She takes a step back.
Sam puts a hand on her shoulder.
He carries something in his
other hand -- hard to see on the dark beach.
SAM
Suzie, it's okay.
It's me.
Suzie steadies herself.
A face APPEARS behind Sam -- Kelly.
SAM (CONT'D)
I was worried about you, Suzie.
I
decided we should all get together, one
more time, before we split up.
SUZIE
Are you mad at me?
SAM
No, no.
Look, I probably should have
told you a little more, about the part I
intended to play.
(beat)
We'll go through it all again tonight.
Sam takes the bottle from Suzie, looks at it.
SAM (CONT'D)
This is a celebration Suzie, not a
suicide pact.
He lifts the object in his other hand -- a champagne battle.
SAM (CONT'D)
We'll chill out first, have a drink,
watch the stars.
Suzie nods.
SAM (CONT'D)
Kelly, there's a beach blanket in the
Jeep.
Could you get it for us?
Kelly nods, starts back, looks once over her shoulder as...
Sam leads Suzie toward a huge rock formation.
SAM (CONT'D)
Let me tell you about this boat I picked
out for us...
They move OUT OF SIGHT.
Kelly continues to walk, back along the
sand toward the cars.
INSERT - A SCREAM
A sickening hollow THWACK -- an arc of blood and two teeth fall
silently on dark stone.
Kelly begins to run, stumbling through the sand to Sam's Jeep,
where she pulls a big roll of clear plastic from behind the
seats.
She stuffs it under her arm, then runs back along the
beach.
As she runs, she can hear them -- more THWACKS, MOANS --
it seems like forever
Sam APPARS before her on the sand.
The champagne bottle swings
loosely at the end of one arm.
it looks shiny now, dripping with
Suzie's blood.
Kelly goes to him.
She looks at the bottle, then throws herself
against him -- a hard kiss.
SAM
I'm sorry, Kelly.
I'm sorry it had to
happen like this.
She was losing it...
KELLY
(breathless)
There was no way.
That cop would've
gotten her to tell him... everything.
She was weak and dumb...
She kisses him again, her hands moving over his body.
Sam takes
a step back, looks into Kelly's face -- the parted lips, sultry
eyes -- as if seeing her for the first time -- a long beat -- at
which point he turns, heaving the champagne bottle as far as he
can into the black waves.
Ray sits for a moment behind the wheel.
RAY
It's starting, Gloria.
This is how it
begins...
GLORIA
Ray.
We don't know anything yet.
She
could be anywhere...
Ray silences her with a look.
RAY
I'm gonna take you back to the office.
Will you put out a call on Suzie's car
for me?
GLORIA
You have someplace to be?
Ray starts the car, doesn't answer.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
If you want company...
RAY
Just check out the car.
Gloria nods.
She looks toward the camp store where the old lady
can still be SEEN standing on the porch, beneath the jawbones.
sees the light go out in Sam's room, lowers her binoculars, sits
for a moment, then begins to write something on a pad.
She's still at it when something KNOCKS at a FENDER.
She looks
up, startled, to find...
Sam in the street, still shirtless, his arms and shoulders
back-lit by the neon light of the Glades Motel.
SAM
Isn't that against the law, peeking into
windows?
GLORIA
(a long beat)
Suzie Toller is missing.
Sam lets out his breath, shakes his head.
SAM
How long?
GLORIA
She didn't cone home last night.
We
found her car at the bus terminal, but
nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
SAM
Maybe she used another name.
GLORIA
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Sam shakes his head once more.
SAM
I don't know what to say...
GLORIA
You could tell me where you were last
night.
Sam stares at her.
SAM
Goddannit... I don't have to...
He stops himself, calms down.
SAM
Come here.
I want you to see something.
Gloria hesitates, looks up at Sam, then puts down the phone and
opens her door.
Sam and Gloria walk among the boxes and suitcases.
GLORIA
Looks like goodbye.
Sam nods.
He goes to one of his cardboard filing boxes, pulls
out a file, hands it to Gloria.
As she takes it, he goes to the
closet, takes a shirt from a hanger.
SAM
Kelly's file.
Read it.
You're going to
find an angry, sexually confused girl
who's made threats on her mother's life
and a female lover she'd never identify.
GLORIA
Suzie?
Sam shrugs.
SAM
You're telling me Ray thinks Suzie was
killed.
I don't have to ask you who he
thinks did it, do I?
(beat)
All I'm saying is, read that, you'll
have a new perspective on things.
Gloria sits on the bed, the file in her hand.
She watches as Sam
pulls on the shirt.
GLORIA
Why didn't you tell us about this before
the trial?
Sam holds her eyes.
SAM
Then -- I still had ethical standards to
protect.
They meant a lot to me.
Now,
I don't care.
And no amount of money
can buy that back.
Sam is interrupted by the HONKING of a HORN.
He looks outside.
ANGLE ON LOT - SAM'S POV
A taxi waits in the glow of the green neon.
Sam looks down on Gloria, seated on his bed, her skirt short
enough to REVEAL shapely legs.
For a moment the two hold one
another's eyes.
SAM (CONT'D)
My ride.
If you're not planning on
arresting me, that is.
The PHONE RINGS.
Ray picks it up.
RAY
Ray.
What's happening?
INTERCUT - RAY/GLORIA PHONE CONVERSATION
She's still in Sam's room, the file spread across the bed.
GLORIA
I'm tired, Ray.
I'm going home.
RAY
Where's Lombardo?
GLORIA
He's leaving the country.
And I don't
give a shit.
RAY
The blood type on the rocks matches
Suzie's.
GLORIA
It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do
it.
I'll tell you something else,
there's more to this story than you
know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think
Hunter may be on the right track...
Ray clicks off his phone.
GLORIA (CONT'D)
Ray?
(nothing but dial tone)
Shit.
Ray.
A cap and gown lay strewn on the sofa.
Kelly wears jeans and a bra.
She looks up to see Ray moving
across the tile.
Her eyes go wide, then move to the gun case.
A moment of silence, save for the BUZZING of the MACHINE.
A
number of plainclothes police, Hunter and Gloria among them,
watch the tape.
RAY
I went there to protect her...
He hangs his head, then looks up, his eyes focusing.
RAY (CONT'D)
The teeth, were they...
HUNTER (0.S.)
Suzie Toller's.
And that's the only
thing saving your sorry ass.
Gloria, Baxter, a tearful Sandra, sit in seats, watch as --
Ray stands before a panel, A SUIT, A CHIEF in uniform, Hunter.
Ray wears a suit, his hair neatly trimmed.
His arm is no longer
in a sling, but one of his hands is still bandaged.
CHIEF
Detective Duquette; our investigation
concludes that this was a good shooting.
But that's irrelevant.
You were not
assigned to this case -- whatever you
imagined this case to be.
And now two
young women are dead.
You are
terminated with forfeiture of pension
and benefits.
Ray looks at the floor.
Hunter coughs.
His hands rest on a file -- we SEE the video
cassette inside -- labeled "TOLLER/VAN RYAN -- CONFIDENTIAL."
HUNTER
Suzie Toller's teeth and blood were
found near the area known as Stoner
Rocks.
Suzie's blood was found in the
Van Ryan Range Rover.
This, in
conjunction with evidence obtained by
Detectives Duquette and Perez has led
this office to the conclusion that Susan
Marie Toller was murdered by Kelly
Lanier Van Ryan...
Sandra chokes back a sob.
She gets to her feet, to be led from
the room by Tom Baxter.
Gloria Perez watches, a sad look in her eye, then turns to look
at Ray.
His back is to her -- the broad shoulders, expensive
suit.
His hands are clasped behind his back.
DISSOLVE TO:
Sam ENTERS in a room lit only by the blue light of a large
aquarium.
He listens once more, hears it -- RUNNING WATER.
He moves down a short hallway, observes the light which spills
from beneath a bedroom door.
He pushes it open, goes inside.
He CROSSES the room.
The bathroom door is ajar, the room leaking steam.
Sam steps inside, looks at the shower stall -- an indistinct
shape moves there in the steam.
San watches, then jerks open the shower door.
The steam
clears -- REVEALING a tall, athletic body, and now the face --
Ray Duquette, grinning at Sam out of the swirling steam.
RAY
Buy you a drink?
San takes a step back.
SAM
Jesus.
I wasn't expecting you 'til
tomorrow.
Ray turns off the water, steps out of the stall, wrapping himself
in a towel.
There's a fresh, raised scar across one shoulder and
Ray winces a little as he tucks the towel about his waist.
He
looks at himself in the mirror, touching the scar.
RAY
Nice girlfriend you had there.
Sam just looks at him.
SAM
Yeah, well, you fixed that.
(beat)
What the hell happened, anyway?
RAY
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Sam shakes his head, walks back into the bedroom.
Ray follows.
RAY (CCNT'D)
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
SAM
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't
teach you to disarm people, shoot them
in the leg or something?
You weren't
supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Now Ray just looks at Sam, his eyes narrowing.
RAY
Did you become squeamish about these
things before or after you bludgeoned
little Suzie Toller to death with a wine
bottle?
(off Sam's silence)
Jesus, man.
It couldn't have worked out better.
They're convinced Kelly whacked Suzie.
I can't talk 'em out of it.
(beat)
We should be celebrating.
This thing
worked out just like you said, only
better.
SAM
Kelly was supposed to be framed, not
killed.
(beat)
What I'm telling you is, I don't like
surprises.
Ray walks to a dresser where a bottle of champagne sits in a
bucket of ice.
He opens the bottle, fills two glasses.
He hands
one of the glasses to Sam.
RAY
Every cloud has a silver lining,
partner.
Here's to no loose ends.
He raises his glass in a toast.
Sam looks at it, then raises his glass as well.
Ray smiles.
Sam
doesn't.
SAM
Here's to no more surprises.
Ray shrugs.
The two men's eyes meet.
They touch glasses and
drink.
Kelly is frantically trying to unlock the gun case as Ray comes
through the French doors.
She can't get it done.
He's there in
an instant.
She screams, backs away, then watches as Ray stops, wraps a hanky
around his hand and breaks the glass.
He takes out a small caliber handgun, checks the clip, aims the
gun at his own shoulder and fires.
BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then
Kelly and Sam on the floor, naked.
He's on her from the rear.
It's getting wild.
He suddenly stops, rolls to the floor.
SAM
We gotta stop.
I'm gonna come.
Kelly laughs, straddles him.
KELLY
That never seemed to worry you at the
Glades.
SAM
That's not your line.
KELLY
Say you love me.
SAM
(a beat)
I love you.
Now give me the line.
KELLY
(a whiny voice)
No little girl can ever make me come.
BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then
Ray is at the bar.
Sam sits down next to him.
A moment of
silence, the twang of a country JUKE BOX -- then...
SAM
Buy you a drink?
BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then
ZNT. SAM'S OFFICE - BLUE BAY SCHOOL
Suzie Toller framed in the doorway.
She walks in.
SUZIE
You like bein' a caddy for rich kids'
problems?
Sam just looks at her.
SUZIE (CONT'D)
I've seen you out there in your old air
boat, thinking about what might have
been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you
out of it.
(beat)
What if I told you I had a way we could
get a big piece of it back?
SAM
We?
SUZIE
Well, I'd need the famous Lombardo
charm, not that you'd have to do
anything you haven't done already.
She takes an envelope from her notebook, tosses it in front of
Sam.
Pictures slide onto his desk -- Sam and Kelly -- in various
poses of coked-out debauchery at the Glades Motel.
SAM
(white-faced)
How...
SUZIE
Walter.
He's been aimin' that Brownie
through knotholes for years.
I saw
these, I knew he'd finally struck gold.
(beat)
I can't decide which came out better,
that little straw Kelly's got up her
nose, or that vibrator you've got up her
ass.
What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?
SAM
(a long beat)
I think there's some things you do, you
don't want to see yourself doing them.
BLACK -- MORE CREDITS -- then
Sam lounges in a booth.
He looks hot, bored.
He stirs a drink.
Kelly walks in out of the light.
She is looking a little strung
out, a big straw bag slung over one shoulder, but oh, so sexy in
skimpy cutoffs and cowboy boots -- long legs flashing as she
nears Sam's booth.
Sam looks up, as...
KELLY
I'm running away.
SAM
(a beat)
You think that's wise?
KELLY
(sitting next to him)
Um-huh.
And guess what else?
(reaching into her bag)
I have toys.
She takes out a snail bag of white powder, taps out a line on the
table top.
Sam looks at it.
He looks at Kelly.
He's had a few drinks.
SAM
(a long beat)
Well, Z guess one taste wouldn't hurt.
END CREDITS.
The seal comes up.
It's over.
They head for the lobby -- but --
