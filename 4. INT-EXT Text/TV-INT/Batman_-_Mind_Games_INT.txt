            their hats and coats, then we PAN PAST them to take in the rest
            of the room.  Every upper-crust face in Gotham City is here,
            chatting, laughing, snatching canapes and drinks from passing
            trays.

                          (laughter, party walla)

            PAN CONTINUES until it STOPS on a tall, broad-shouldered figure
            in a tuxedo, his back to us, talking casually to socialite
            VERONICA VREELAND (from episodes #406-547, "Birds of a Feather",
            and #406-565, "The Worry Men").  They stand near some French
            doors opening onto a balcony.

                                VERONICA
                      It's just been awful.  What with all
                      this crime in the streets, I haven't
                      been able to shop at my favorite
                      boutique in weeks.

            The figure turns TOWARDS CAMERA and places his empty glass on a

            tray carried by a passing WAITER.  It's BRUCE WAYNE.

                                BRUCE
                          (dryly)
                      It's stories like yours that really
                      bring home how serious this situation
                      is, Ronnie.

            ON BRUCE AND VERONICA

            She gives him a look, not sure if he's serious or not.

                                VERONICA
                      Oh, Bruce.  I can never tell when
                      you're kidding.

                                BRUCE
                      That's me -- a man of mystery.

            ON VERONICA

            Her face is reflected in the French doors as she looks up, as if
            searching the night sky for the Bat-signal, which is not there.

                                VERONICA
                      Seriously, though -- it seems like
                      everyone I know has been robbed
                      lately.
                          (beat)
                      Where's Batman?  That's what I'd like
                      to know.  He hasn't been seen in
                      weeks.

            CLOSE ON BRUCE

            Face grim, eyes narrowing.

                                BRUCE
                      I'm sure he's just waiting for the
                      right moment to strike.

            WIDE ANGLE

            On this line the French doors suddenly BURST OPEN, revealing THE
            PENGUIN, along with two or three HIRED GOONS.  The Penguin
            gestures dramatically with his umbrella.  In his other hand he
            holds a large leather carrying bag.  The goons have their Dark
            Deco guns at the ready, though they're not aiming them at
            anyone.

                                PENGUIN
                          (loudly)
                      Ladies and gentlemen, your attention
                      if you please!

                      Oh, no! / The Penguin! / I knew
                      something like this would happen! / 
                      What'll we do? (Etc.)

            FAVOR PENGUIN

            Bruce and Veronica, both looking quite distressed, are in b.g.

                                PENGUIN
                      Due to the seriousness of the recent
                      crime wave, it would behoove you all
                      to put your valuables somewhere safe.

            CLOSER ON HIM

            He smiles wickedly and holds the bag up, opening it.

                                PENGUIN (CONT'D)
                      Allow me.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            He waddles along in front of the shocked and frightened guests
            as they drop wallets, purses, necklaces, watches and so forth
            into the bag.

            ANGLE INCLUDES VERONICA

            The Penguin turns toward her.  His face lights up as he
            recognizes Veronica.

                                PENGUIN
                      Ronnie!  How splendid to see you again
                      -- especially under these
                      circumstances.

                                VERONICA
                          (frightened)
                      Oswald ... you're looking
                          (swallows)
                      ... robust ....

            She glances over at where Bruce was standing, then does a take
            as she realizes he's gone.

                                                                 CUT TO:


            The front doors suddenly SLAM open, revealing Bullock with gun
            in hand.

                                BULLOCK
                          (shouts)

                      Okay, beak-brain!  Getcher flippers
                      up!

            ANGLE INCLUDES PENGUIN AND HIS GOONS

            Surprised in the midst of their looting, they wheel about.  At
            this point Montoya comes through the open French doors behind
            them, gun leveled at the goons.

                                MONTOYA
                          (steely)
                      Prone out!

            The goons hastily DROP their guns and lie down on the floor.

            ON PENGUIN

            He scowls at Bullock.

                                PENGUIN
                      What unfortunate timing -- for you!

            He lowers his umbrella and SPRAYS a thick opaque mist from its
            tip.

            ON BULLOCK

            Taken by surprise, he begins to COUGH as he's enveloped by the
            mist.

                                BULLOCK
                          (coughs)

            WIDE ANGLE - THE FLOOR

            PANDEMONIUM, as the guests run this way and that, blinded by the
            fog.

                          (frightened shouts)

            ON MONTOYA

            Surrounded by the mist as well.  Thinking quickly, she drops to
            the floor, where there's a few inches of clear air between the
            parquet and the mist.  ANGLE ADJUSTS TO FOLLOW.

            LOW ANGLE - MONTOYA AND GOONS

            Montoya still has her gun.  The goons aren't going anywhere.

                      Relax, guys.


            In BLACK-AND-WHITE, we see SUMMER GLEASON sitting behind a news desk,
            delivering a report.  Behind her in a small INSET is some kind of
            stylized graphic:  Perhaps a silhouette of the Gotham skyline with
            images of the Joker, Harley, Two-Face, the Penguin, Rupert Thorne,
            Poison Ivy, etc. looming over it.  Across the bottom of the screen is
            the legend .
              CRIME WAVE: GOTHAM UNDER SIEGE -- DAY 8

                                SUMMER
                          (filtered)
                      ... last night's brazen robbery by the
                      Penguin at the Van Pelt estate was the
                      latest in the worst series of crimes
                      Gotham City has ever seen, made all
                      the worse by the mysterious absence of
                      Batman.

            Now the inset behind Summer suddenly becomes a shot of Batman.

                                SUMMER (CONT'D)
                      After more than a week without his
                      protective presence -- his longest
                      disappearance that anyone can recall --
                      Gotham City can only wonder, "Batman,
                      where are you?"

            PULL BACK to show that we've been watching a small TV on the
            desk of Bruce's secretary, DANA.  She reaches over to turn off
            the set.

                                DANA
                      One good question, that.

            ANGLE INCLUDES DOOR

            The door opens and ALFRED, in his chauffeur's livery, comes in.

                                ALFRED
                          (cheery)
                      Good morning, Miss Dana.

                                DANA
                      Is it?  Not with all those weirdoes
                      running amuck.  Why isn't Batman doing
                      something about it?


                                                                                                  Page 6 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            ON ALFRED

            He shrugs; "Why ask me?" and walks across the reception area
            toward Bruce's inner office.

                                ALFRED
                      I expect he has his reasons, however
                      obscure they may appear to us common
                      folk.

            ON INNER OFFICE DOOR

            It OPENS just before Alfred can reach it, and a preoccupied
            Bruce strides out, schedule book in hand, almost knocking Alfred
            aside.

                                BRUCE
                          (preoccupied)
                      Excuse me, Alfred.

            He crosses to Dana's desk.

                                BRUCE (CONT'D)
                      Dana, I'm having a problem with my
                      personal calendar.

            ON BRUCE AND DANA

            He leans over her desk, pointing out discrepancies in his
            schedule book.

                                BRUCE
                      I just can't seem to remember what I
                      was doing most evenings last month.
                          (beat)
                      I've got nearly all of my nights
                      completely blocked off -- but why?

            ON DANA

            She looks up at Bruce, a faint smile on her lips.

                                DANA
                      Too many girlfriends to count?

            Bruce gives her a look.

                                BRUCE
                      You're not helping. Just double-check
                      this and update me in the morning,
                      okay?

            ANOTHER ANGLE - BRUCE

            grabs his topcoat off a coat tree and heads for the door, Alfred
            opening it.  Dana waves good-bye.

                                DANA
                      No problem, Mr. Wayne.  Have a nice
                      evening.


                                                                                                  Page 7 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            CLOSE ON BRUCE

            He hesitates at the door, that odd feeling bothering him again.

                                BRUCE
                      Thanks. I'll ... try.

                                                                WIPE TO:


            Bruce stands by the tall windows, backlit by the full moon, as
            he talks to DICK GRAYSON, who is lounging in a chair like a
            typical teenager, reading the daily newspaper, which is angled
            so we can see its  headline which obscures
                        WHERE IS BATMAN?
            Dick's face.

                                BRUCE
                      I've never been this absent-minded
                      before.

            ON DICK

            He lowers the newspaper so we can see that he's mildly annoyed.

                                DICK
                          (not paying attention)
                      Y'know, Batman's not the only one
                      who's missing.  How come the news
                      reports never mention anything about
                      Robin?

            Dick gets up and walks across the room, casually folding the
            paper and tossing it on top of a small pile of papers in the
            corner.

                                DICK (CONT'D)
                      If I were Batman's partner I'd be
                      getting ticked off bigtime.

            ON BRUCE

            He glances out the window to see the Bat Signal shining across
            the night sky, projected against the clouds.

                                BRUCE
                      There it is again.

            Dick ENTERS SHOT, looking out the window.

                                DICK
                      Yeah.  Wonder if he's going to answer
                      it this time.


                                                                                                  Page 8 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            WIDE ANGLE

            Bruce stands looking at the logo rippling over the clouds.  Dick
            picks up a few textbooks and heads for the door.  Alfred,
            meanwhile, has ENTERED the room and is busily tidying up the
            stack of newspapers Dick has left behind.

                                DICK
                      Gotta go.  I've got a study date with
                      Cindy and I'm running late.

                                ALFRED
                      Your roadster is idling in the

            He stacks the pile of newspapers neatly while he talks to Bruce,
            who still stands looking out the window.

            FAVORING BRUCE

            Still at the window.  He turns, his expression confused, to look
            at Alfred.

                                BRUCE
                      Ever had the feeling there was
                      something wrong with your life,

                                ALFRED
                      Not actually, sir.  All in all, I must
                      say I'm quite contented with my lot.

            He looks back out the window, at the Bat-signal in the sky,
            which is reflected on the window glass, superimposed on his
            face.

            He realizes he's been dreaming, throws back his tangled covers
            and swings himself up so he's sitting on the side of his bed,
            his face in his hands.

            Unshaven, still in his pajamas, he stumbles to the door.


            Dick sits reading the morning paper while Alfred dusts.  ANGLE
            WIDENS TO INCLUDE Bruce standing framed in the doorway, one arm
            leaning against it for support.  They stop what they're doing
            and stare at him.

            Dick rises, starts toward him.

                                DICK
                      You okay?  You look like something the
                      cat tossed up.

            He runs his fingers through his tousled hair as he walks past
            Dick, over to the huge bookcase that fills one wall of the room.

            He's at the bookcase now, running his finger along the spines of
            the books like he was doing in his dream.

            Bruce pulls the book halfway out of the shelf, and something
            CLICKS.

            DRAMATIC ANGLE

            All three men react as the entire bookshelf SLIDES to either
            side, revealing a stairway hidden behind it.

            FAVOR DICK AND ALFRED

            They cross to the stairway; Dick cautiously looks down into
            darkness.  We can hear the FAINT ECHO we associate with the
            Batcave.

                      Only one way to find out.

            He starts down the steps.

            ON BRUCE AND ALFRED

            They exchange a quick surprised glance, then move quickly after
            Dick, following him down the stairs into darkness.  Bruce stops
            a few steps down, feeling the wall.

                                BRUCE
                      Wait.  I think I've found a light ...

            He CLICKS the switch.

            The lights go on O.S.  Bruce, Dick, and Alfred look O.S. down
            the stairway, stunned by what they see.

            Here we can see the Batmobile, there we catch a glimpse of the
            trophy room with the robot dinosaur and the giant penny.  In one
            corner looms the crime lab, in another the huge computer.  A
            flurry of bats SQUEAK and FLAP THROUGH SHOT.

            WIDE ANGLE - THE THREE - PANNING

            They move down the stairs and into the cave proper, looking
            around in amazement.

                      This can't be what I think it is.

                      house?  This is just too weird.

            Bruce and Dick are wearing their costumes now, but with their
            masks off.  (NOTE:  Even when they're completely costumed, we
            still won't refer to them as Batman and Robin, because they
            aren't yet.  The steely toughness and streetwise attitude --

            even their posture -- is missing.)  Dick is also not wearing his
            utility belt.  Alfred is no longer there.

            as he does a flip off the hanging rings, somersaults in mid-air,
            lands hands-first on the sidehorse, then flips again so he lands
            gracefully on his feet right in front of a much-impressed Dick.

                      Outstanding!  I didn't know you could
                      do that.

            FAVOR BRUCE

            He looks back at the gym equipment, his hand to the back of his
            head, almost surprised at what he's just done.

            He holds up his utility belt and starts investigating the
            various compartments.

            CLOSER

            He finds several of the small black gas balls, rolls them around
            in his palm like marbles, then drops them back into their
            compartment.

            WIDE ANGLE

            He takes the grappling gun out of its compartment in the belt's
            rear and looks at it.

            He snaps his head aside just enough for the grappling hook to
            narrowly miss him as it WHIZZES THROUGH SHOT.

            carefully puts everything back in the utility belt, not certain
            of what else he might accidentally set off.  Over this:

                      This is just too much! I don't even
                      know if I want to be Robin.

            CLOSE ON DICK

            worried, emotionally overwrought.

                                DICK
                      I mean, being a crime fighter is a
                      great fantasy, but the reality is
                      pretty intense.

                                BRUCE (O.S.)
                      I know exactly how you feel.

            Determined, he turns and walks over to the computer as Dick
            follows.

                      But if this is our destiny, we can't

            We look up at the computer screen where we can see the phrase
            INVALID COMMAND PARAMETER repeated down the whole length of
            the screen.  Dick steps INTO SHOT and looks at the screen.

            They look at each other, frustrated.  Looks like another dead

            He walks over and hands Bruce a large leatherbound ledger.

                      According to this ledger, we all

            Alfred is obviously pleased with himself.  Dick scratches his
            head.

            ON BRUCE

            He rises from the computer, walks across the room.

                                BRUCE
                      That's something else we've all
                      forgotten.  But at least it's a
                      starting place.

                      Come on, Dick.

            ON BATMOBILE

            Bruce climbs a bit awkwardly into the waiting Batmobile and
            pulls on his mask.  As Dick ENTERS SHOT:

                                BRUCE
                      Better put your mask on, Dick. We're
                      going to pay the good doctor a visit.

            FAVOR DICK

            He puts on his own mask and climbs into the Batmobile, looking
            nervous.

                      You sure you know how to drive this

                                BRUCE
                      It's a car.  How hard can it be?

            As one, they look down at the dashboard.

            THEIR POV - DASHBOARD

            It's the most complicated thing this side of the B-12 Bomber.

            ANGLE INCLUDES BRUCE AND DICK

            Bruce studies the complicated dash for a beat, then reaches over

                                                                                                  Page 20 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            and, feigning a confidence he doesn't feel, TOGGLES a switch.

            ON BATMOBILE'S FRONT BUMPER

            The grappling hook suddenly FIRES from the front of the car,
            narrowly missing a nearby stalagmite.  After a beat it retracts
            (SFX: WINCH WHINE).

            RESUME BRUCE AND DICK

            Dick raises an eyebrow.

                                DICK
                      You were saying ...?

                                BRUCE
                      Keep quiet or I'll make you drive.

            He tries another switch.

                                BRUCE (CONT'D)
                      Let's see what this does ...

            ON BATMOBILE'S REAR ENGINE PORT

            The afterburner suddenly IGNITES and the engine ROARS into life.

            ON BATMOBILE COCKPIT

            They look up as the canopy SLIDES shut.  We can see Bruce put
            his hands on the wheel.

                                BRUCE
                      Here goes nothing ...

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            The Batmobile ROARS up the ramp as Alfred watches, obviously
            concerned.

            ON RAMP - TRACK WITH BATMOBILE

            It ZOOMS up the winding ramp, weaving slightly, heading toward
            what appears to be a solid rock wall.


            They brace themselves for what looks sure to be a fatal
            collision.

            ON RAMP

            The Batmobile goes through an electric eye beam, breaking it.

            ON ROCK WALL

            Just before the car hits it, the hidden ramp lowers like a
            drawbridge.


            They relax.

                                                                                                  Page 21 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND



            Bruce watches the road as he drives.

                                BRUCE (CONT'D)
                      Whoever caused our amnesia must also
                      be aware of our secret identities.

            Dick shrugs.

                                DICK
                      Hey, before today I didn't even know I
                      had a secret identity.

            OTS BRUCE AND DICK - THROUGH WINDSHIELD

            Our heroes' attention is drawn to the sudden CLANGING of a
            BURGLAR ALARM ahead.  We can see two BURGLARS running out of a
            ritzy store, the sign above which proclaims it the SECOND AVENUE
            FURRIERS.  The thieves leave a trail of mink and ermine coats
            behind them as they rush to a waiting van.

                                BRUCE
                      Look!

            ON BURGLARS

            As they load the furs into the van, they are startled by the
            sudden approach of the Batmobile and freeze in their tracks. The
            FIRST BURGLAR addresses someone unseen in the van.

                                1ST BURGLAR
                      Boss!  It's the Bat-car!

            WIDER ANGLE

            The burglars watch, confused, as the Batmobile ROARS right on
            past them.

            Dick looks at Bruce in surprise.

                                DICK
                      What, you're just going to ignore
                      them?

                                BRUCE
                      They're armed.  We're not.

                                DICK
                      Do you think that'd stop Batman and
                      Robin?

            CLOSE ON BRUCE

            He considers what Dick has just said.  His eyeslits narrow and
            he cuts the steering wheel sharply.

                                BRUCE
                      You're right.

            ON BATMOBILE

            It makes a SCREAMING U-TURN in the middle of the street and
            heads back toward the startled fur thieves.

            ON THE BURGLARS

            As the Batmobile approaches, they pull hand guns and OPEN FIRE
            on our heroes.

                                1ST BURGLAR
                      Knew it was too good t' be true!  Take
                      'em down!

            ON BATMOBILE

            It SQUEALS to a halt as the slugs RICOCHET harmlessly O.S. Then
            the canopy slides open and the costumed Bruce rises.  He hurls a
            batarang O.S.

            ON BURGLARS

            They watch, astounded, as the batarang flies wide, not coming
            close to hitting any of them.  Then they OPEN FIRE again.

            ON COCKPIT

            Bruce ducks back down behind the bullet-proof windshield beside
            as several more SHOTS CRACK against it.

                                BRUCE
                      That didn't work.

                                DICK
                      Wait!  I got an idea ...

            He reaches for the dashboard.

            Bruce drops into his seat beside Dick as the canopy SLIDES shut.

            ON GORDON AND BULLOCK

            They stand watching as the Batmobile ROARS off into the night.

                                GORDON
                      I don't really care where they've
                      been. I'm just glad they're back.

            CLOSE ON BULLOCK

            He SNAPS the toothpick he's been chewing on in two.  He looks
            like a man who's just smelled something unpleasant.

                                BULLOCK
                      Yeah, well ... everyone's entitled to
                      their opinion.

            It's pretty much the kind of place you'd imagine it to be from
            the outside:  Leather chairs for waiting patients, a few framed
            diplomas hanging, a tall bookcase against an inner wall, etc.
            Bruce finishes climbing into the darkened room through a side
            window, and Dick climbs in behind him.

                                BRUCE
                      Looks like nobody's home.

            ON BRUCE

            He looks around the room, finds a framed photo on the wall.  He
            takes it down and studies it.

            OTS BRUCE - ON PHOTO

            Now we can clearly see the photo:  A black-and-white shot of DR.
            OTTO SONDERBAR accepting some award.  Sonderbar is short, squat,
            with thick glasses, a full head of graying hair and a neatly
            trimmed salt-and-pepper beard.

                                BRUCE
                      The mysterious Dr. Sonderbar, I

            A very QUICK CUT of a smiling Sonderbar approaching with an air

                                                            CUT BACK TO:


            The framed photo slips from Bruce's fingers and SHATTERS on the
            floor.  Bruce looks up from it, grim and determined.

                                BRUCE
                      It was him, Dick. I'm sure of it.  I
                      don't know why yet -- but I will.

            ANOTHER ANGLE  

            He notices something on the wall that was hidden by the picture --
            a pressure plate. He presses it. 

            WIDE ANGLE

            The wall slides back to reveal a large hidden laboratory.  Dick
            moves to join Bruce as they enter cautiously. 

                                DICK
                      What, does every place in Gotham have
                      secret rooms?


            Filled with all sorts of electronic and chemical equipment,
            including a complicated distillation apparatus -- glass tubing,
            retorts, beakers, etc. -- and a device with a rotating radar
            like dish connected to a computer monitor and keyboard. SFX: 
            SLOW BEEPS.  The device seems to be transmitting.  Dick notices
            this.

                      Oh, this doesn't look at all
                      suspicious.

            He stands at the computer keyboard and TYPES in a few commands.

            As the dish stops rotating and the BEEPING ceases, Bruce and

            from their faces and rise to their full heights.  Their body
            language is different now; no longer are they Bruce Wayne and
            Dick Grayson awkwardly wearing odd costumes.  Now, once again,
            they are BATMAN and ROBIN!

                                ROBIN
                      Wow, did that hurt.  You okay?

            CLOSE ON BATMAN

            Jaw set, eyes narrowing, once more the most dangerous man alive.

                                BATMAN
                      Never felt better.

            ON ROBIN

            He looks around the lab.

                                ROBIN
                      It's all coming back to me.  Leslie
                      Thompkins was out of town, and her


                                                                                                  Page 29 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

                      service recommended Doctor Sonderbar.

            ON BATMAN

            He picks up the explanation as he examines the air hypo
            Sonderbar used during the flashback.

                                BATMAN
                      He gave the three of us our flu shots
                      ... and after that, everything's a
                      blank.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Batman puts down the air hypo and looks at the dormant radar
            dish.

                                BATMAN
                      Alfred should have recovered too,
                      since we just deactivated his receiver
                      as well.

                                SONDERBAR (O.S.)
                      Gentlemen, I am  impressed.
                                  most
                                       
            ON BATMAN AND ROBIN

            They whip about toward the lab door to find DR. OTTO SONDERBAR
            standing there, gun in hand.

                                BATMAN
                      Sonderbar!

                                SONDERBAR
                      Even with no memory of ever having
                      been Batman and Robin, you still
                      manage to find me. Most exemplary.

            FAVOR BATMAN

            He stands his ground, ready for anything.

                                BATMAN
                      More than that -- now I know who you
                      really are.  You should have chosen a
                      better alias than "Sonderbar", Doctor ...

            CLOSER ON BATMAN

            Eyes narrowing, threatening.

                                BATMAN (CONT'D)
                      Which in German means "strange" -- as
                      in !
                  Doctor Hugo Strange

            OTS BATMAN

            "Sonderbar" reaches up to pull off his phony wig and beard and
            stands revealed as DR. HUGO STRANGE.  He CLICKS his heels
            together in a courtly manner and bows sharply from the waist.


                                                                                                  Page 30 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

                                STRANGE
                      Again I bow before your ingenuity,
                      Batman.  You are indeed a formidable
                      opponent.

            ON STRANGE

            Grinning, he steps forward, his weapon still trained on our
            heroes.

                                STRANGE
                      Since our last encounter I have
                      remained convinced of your true
                      identity -- and, by extrapolation,
                      that of your companion.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Strange almost lovingly caresses his radiopathic device.

                                STRANGE (CONT'D)
                      When I was paroled, I invested all my
                      savings and energies into building a
                      mechanism that could block various
                      memories from a distance.

            WIDE ANGLE

            Strange keeps the gun trained on them while Batman and Robin
            stand their ground.

                                BATMAN
                      So you lured us here to test it.

                                STRANGE
                      But of course.  It was a simple matter
                      to forge the necessary papers so that
                      your regular physician's service would
                      direct you here.

            ON ROBIN

            Angry.

                                ROBIN
                      Those flu shots!  You injected us all
                      with some sort of microscopic
                      broadcast receiver.

            CLOSE ON STRANGE

            Grinning malevolently.

                                STRANGE
                      Just so.  A viral microchip of my own
                      design.  It translated the commands of
                      my machine into selective amnesia.

            ON BATMAN

            Still angry, but almost incredulous as well.

                                                                                                  Page 31 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND


                                BATMAN
                      And you did all this just to prove
                      your suspicions were right?

            RESUME STRANGE

            He waves off Batman's question with a flick of his hand.

                                STRANGE
                      Not at all.  You prevented my
                      profiting from your true identity once
                      before -- this time, however, I've
                      done quite well.

            Strange moves to a safe, dials a combination and opens it.
            Inside we can see stacks of money, negotiable bonds, etc.

                                STRANGE (CONT'D)
                      All the criminals running rampant in
                      your absence are paying me ten percent
                      of their ill-gotten gains, and will
                      continue to do so as long as I can
                      guarantee no interference from Batman
                      and Robin.

            ON STRANGE AND BATMAN

            Strange closes the safe and approaches, gun held ready.  The
            Dark Knight glares at him.

                                STRANGE
                      So you see, I must insist that you
                      continue this charade ... whether you
                      wish to or not.

            ANGLE INCLUDES DOOR

            Two N.D. GOONS ENTER, machine guns held ready.  Strange puts
            away his gun.

                                STRANGE (CONT'D)
                      I could, of course, simply shoot you --
                      but that would be a waste of valuable
                      scientific knowledge.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            His goons keep Batman and Robin covered while Strange walks over
            and picks up his air hypo.

                                STRANGE (CONT'D)
                      Instead, I am curious to see what
                      might happen were I to inject you both
                      with a second viral receiver ...

            CLOSER ON STRANGE

            He loads a cartridge into his air hypo.

                                STRANGE (CONT'D)

                                                                                                  Page 32 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

                      ... and then turn up the broadcast
                      frequency to maximum.
                          (beat)
                      In theory, it should leave you both
                      complete mental vegetables.

            WIDE ANGLE

            Strange turns his device back on.  The dish begins to revolve
            and BEEP.  Strange twists a large potentiometer dial on the
            machine; in several V.U. gauges above it, needles bury
            themselves in red zones.  The BEEPS INCREASE in frequency and
            urgency.

            ON BATMAN AND ROBIN

            Strange turns back to them with his air hypo in hand.  His goons
            close in beside him.  Our heroes stand their ground, ready for
            anything.

                                STRANGE
                      Now, you will please to cooperate ...

            Batman backs up toward the distillation apparatus. Strange
            follows him. 

            CLOSE ON BATMAN

            His hand reaches behind him, finds the control on a bunsen
            burner and turns it up. The small gas flame flares up under a
            glass retort. 

            WIDE ANGLE

            A green liquid begins BUBBLING and coursing through the spiral
            tubing, filling a resevoir at the far end. The resevoir SHATTERS
            under the pressure. Strange and the two goons are momentarily
            distracted. 

                                STRANGE
                       --?!What

            ON BATMAN

            He suddenly lunges forward, grabbing a startled Strange by the
            wrist of the hand that holds the air hypo.

                                STRANGE (CONT'D)
                          (startled cry)

            FAVOR ROBIN

            As the two goons turn toward the struggling Batman and Strange,
            Robin leaps into the air and KICKS the guns out of both goons'
            hands.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Robin throws a straight jab directly at us until it FILLS FRAME.
            SFX: WHACK!


                                                                                                  Page 33 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            ON 1ST GOON

            Obviously having taken Robin's punch full on the chin O.S., he
            reels back against the wall and slumps, dazed, to the floor.

                                1ST GOON
                          (fading groan)

            ON 2ND GOON

            Robin does a back kick that catches Goon #2 full in the gut,
            sending him CRASHING into a bank of equipment.

                                2ND GOON
                          (impact grunt)

            He sags to the floor, out cold.

            ON BATMAN AND STRANGE

            With a strength born of desperation, Strange tries to press the
            air hypo to Batman's shoulder, but Batman will not let go of the
            other's wrist.

                                STRANGE
                          (straining)
                      Not -- again!  You will not ruin
                      everything again!

            CLOSER ON AIR HYPO

            As the two men struggle, its tip points first one way and then
            the other, then back again.  It's impossible to tell which man
            may take the lethal shot.

                                BATMAN
                          (straining)
                      Give it up ... Strange ...!

            FAVOR STRANGE

            With the last of his strength he twists away from Batman,
            pulling his wrist free of the Dark Knight's grip.

                                STRANGE
                          (shout of triumph)

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            But his own momentum causes Strange to stumble against the wall,
            the impact pressing the air hypo to his chest.  It fires with a
            WHOOSH OF COMPRESSED AIR.

                                STRANGE
                          (cry of fear)

            ON STRANGE

            He looks down at his chest in sheer horror, then at the
            radiopathic transmitter.  He lunges toward it, trying to shut it
            off before his racing bloodstream can carry the viral receiver

                                                                                                  Page 34 of 36file:///iBook%20HD/Desktop%20Folder/Michael's%20Docs/Website/Divisions/Teleplays/Batman/mindgames.htm GAMES3/10/03 7:43 PMMIND

            to his brain. He's almost to the cut-off switch when --

            CLOSE ON HIM

            He freezes, his mouth growing slack, his pupils becoming tiny
            pinpoints.  Strange slumps to the floor, staring blindly off
            into space -- his mind wiped completely clean by his own
            machine.

            ANOTHER ANGLE

            Robin leaps to Strange's machine and SMASHES it, but it's too
            late.

            ON BATMAN

            He kneels by Strange, checking his condition.

                                BATMAN
                          (grimly)
                      Too late.

            Batman slowly rises and turns to Robin.

                                BATMAN (CONT'D)
                      It seems our secret is finally safe.

            They stare down at the mindless idiot that was Dr. Hugo Strange
            as we

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:


            The TV shows Summer the news desk again, giving a report.  A
            still photo behind her shows Batman and Robin delivering a tied-
            up Penguin to the police.

                                SUMMER
                          (filtered)
                      ... and things have finally returned to
                      normal in Gotham City now that Batman
                      and Robin are back in action.  A
                      grateful Mayor Hill said today that --

            Suddenly Dick's hand reaches INTO FRAME and CLICKS the TV off. 

                                DICK (O.S.)
                      Love to hear more, Summer, but I've
                      got a date with Cindy tonight.

            ANGLE WIDENS TO INCLUDE Dick and Bruce, with Alfred nearby.

            ON ALFRED

            He stands by the tall window, hands behind his back.

                                ALFRED
