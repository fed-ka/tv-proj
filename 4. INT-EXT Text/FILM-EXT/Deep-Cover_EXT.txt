Rain. Christmas lights. A rusted out '56 Lincoln rattles
down the bleak boulevard. In it: JOE STEVENS, an angry, black
man in his late 20's, beside him his 10-year-old son, JOE
JR.
Joe Jr. stares out the window at passing: boarded buildings,
whores with raincoats over their heads trying to flag down a
john, a black Santa, a knot of drinkers. Breaking the silence:
JOE STEVENS
Your mother okay?
JOE JR.
Yes, sir.
They stop at a light. Joe Stevens tries to furtively snort a
little something. He spots Joe Jr. watching.
JOE STEVENS
(firm, without irony)
Don't you do this shit, boy. Don't
you ever fuckin' touch it, you hear
me?
Joe Jr. stares, silent; Joe Jr.'s about to hit him.
JOE STEVENS
(continuing)
You hear me, goddam it?
The boy nods. Satisfied, Joe Sr. draws in the stuff. It makes
him feel good, strong, worried and determined all at once.
JOE STEVENS
(continuing; charged
up)
What do you want for Christmas?
JOE JR.
I don't know.
JOE STEVENS
(light changes; he
accelerates)
You don't know?? You gotta know what
you want, boy, if you ever expect to
get it.
A sudden charm to his bravado. Joe Jr. smiles uncertainly.
Joe Sr. grins back, pulls up in front of a liquor store.
JOE STEVENS
(continuing)
Wait here. This won't take a minute.
Joe Jr. doesn't notice or doesn't remark that his father,
just before entering the store, draws a handgun from beneath
his coat.
The boy gazes dreamily at the street. The lunatic Black Santa
marches by, ranting to himself ("Then the white man say...").
The RAIN HAMMERS on the roof and windshield. Joe Jr. breathes
on the glass, fogging the scene.
From the store: MUFFLED GUNFIRE.
Joe Jr. looks that way. Another GUNSHOT, then:
His father comes out the door clutching money in one hand.
He strides toward the car with a reckless pride. He doesn't
notice:
The liquor store door opens behind him.
A SHOTGUN BLAST. Joe Stevens' guts splatter onto the car
windshield. A look of terrible amazement; he sinks to his
knees.
JOE JR.
Daddy!!
He jumps from the car, kneels by his father.
The STORE OWNER (47, Slavic) drags the gun toward them,
bleeding profusely.
STORE OWNER
(enraged, almost to
tears)
Fuckin' niggers... fuckin' niggers...
JOE STEVENS
looks at the money in his hand: two 20's, two 5's.
JOE STEVENS
Fifty bucks... fifty goddam bucks.
(looks up at his son)
I'm sorry...
He stuffs the blood-soaked bills in the boy's shirt pocket
and dies. Joe Jr. looks up at...
THE STORE OWNER
Bloody, nearly unconscious, he aims the shotgun at the boy
who is too frightened to move.
JOE JR.
Please, Mister...
The man dies on his feet. As he falls backward, he pulls the
trigger, the BLAST shattering the car windows.
Cop cars SQUEAL up. Uniformed cops leap out, guns drawn,
survey the scene. Then one notices Joe Jr., staring motionless
at his father and the store owner, dead together. ON HIS
EYES:
DISSOLVE TO:
THOSE SAME EYES
-- but older, harder, colder. They're concentrating on a
paper before him.
TITLE: 17 YEARS LATER
CLOSEUP - THE MINNESOTA MULTIPHASIC PERSONALITY INVENTORY
Hundreds of TRUE/FALSE questions...
1.) I have never indulged in any unusual sexual practices.
(T/F)
2.) I have often felt that strangers were looking at me
critically. (T/F)
3.) When I was young I occasionally stole things. (T/F)
Joe Stevens marks these TRUE, FALSE, FALSE then comes to:
4.) A person's station in life is at least partially
determined by his race. (T/F) We are:
Stevens parks outside a small, well-maintained house. As he
gets out, he spots a GROUP OF KIDS (black and Hispanic)
playing down the street. He's not pleased about that.
STEVENS
(calls to them)
Joe-J, Carmen...
A BOY, 7, and a GIRL, 5, (both light-skinned) run to him
shouting, "Daddy," jump into his arms, competing for
attention, as if they haven't seen him in ages.
STEVENS
What were you doing with those kids?
JOE-J & CARMEN
Playing...
STEVENS
(displeased)
Your mom lets you play with them?
JOE-J & CARMEN
Yes, sir... Yes, sir.
His strictness has already sobered their enthusiasm. Sensing
this, he attempts to embrace them which he can do only
awkwardly.
Meanwhile, his wife, TERRY (Southern white) has come out the
screen door. She and Stevens bristle at each other.
STEVENS
I thought we talked about this. The
older brother up there's got a sheet
with --
TERRY
Lay off it. They're just kids...
Both are ready to fight, but restrain themselves. A big
Polynesian, TITO comes out the door.
TITO
Hey, Joe.
STEVENS
Tito...
A moment of surprise, then he gets it. He looks to Terry.
She gives a little shrug, refusing to be embarrassed.
The immense sprawl, the arterial flow of the freeways, the
blinding light. We DESCEND...
Hull goes up the stairs onto a downtown street.
South L.A. neighborhood. A 13-year-old BLACK YOUTH selling
drugs through a car window. Hull walks by. He's at ease,
looking around, his manner subtly announcing that he belongs
here, just as in the train station he seemed to belong among
the commuters.
A fat BLONDE WOMAN (61, large white glasses, tiny shoes)
leads Hull down a corridor.
BLONDE WOMAN
Television mostly. I was on "Sky
King" twice, "Ramar of the Jungle."
That was a silly show. The jungle
was mostly flats...
They pass an open door where a 6-year-old boy, JAMES, a
latchkey, sits on the stoop playing Gameboy; inside, his
mother, BELINDA, a broken down whore, is doing her nails and
drinking Pepsi. She looks up, bats her lashes at Hull.
BLONDE WOMAN
(continuing)
You want my advice, I'd stay away
from that bitch.
She opens the door to the room across the hall. A dump. Hull
walks in, drops his duffle: he'll take it. The Blonde lounges
in the doorway. He closes the door.
On the seam between South-Central and USC. Lots of people
out: children, students, dealers, whores. Hull with a new
haircut.
Dealers (most in mid-teens) meeting cars, making transactions.
All this casually observed. EDDIE comes up the street,
reciting his version of an old street toast.
EDDIE
On the day of the King's castration,
all the counts and no accounts were
down on the deck with Georgia Tech
taking turns in the back seat...
Those dealers not at car windows, gather around. He never
speaks to them, goes on declaiming as he exchanges drugs for
money.
Hull watches, talking to another street person. His appearance
continues to change: clothes, posture, walk, gestures subtly
conform to the environment, a bit like Zelig. Throughout the
film his appearance shifts, depending on who he's with. We
always recognize him, but each time he's different.
He walks up to a dealer, makes a quick buy and keeps going.
But he sees them and is seen.
Hull approaches another Dealer, the 13-year-old seen earlier
(angelic face). Like Hull, he's trying to act tough.
HULL
Whatta you got?
13-YEAR-OLD DEALER
(voice just changing)
Nickel rock, dime rock. Excellent
shit.
Hull exchanges a folded twenty for two foil balls. He walks
off. He has gone twenty feet when...
RED RANGE ROVER
SQUEALS to a stop opposite the Dealer.
A huge young black man, IVY (23, all in red with a red
headband), leans out the passenger window, shouting at the
13-year-old.
IVY
What the fuck I tell you about being
here?
Everyone turns to look, but Hull's view is blocked.
13-YEAR-OLD DEALER (O.S.)
No, wait...
IVY (O.S.)
Too fuckin' late.
POPPING noises. Ivy is waving an automatic weapon. Everyone
on the street but Hull has hit the ground.
IVY
(enjoying it, shouting)
Get down, motherfuckers!
Ivy laughs and fondles a girlfriend as the car ROARS off. He
sees Hull, pretends to fire, laughs as Hull, too, ducks.
When Ivy's gone, he runs to where a CROWD has gathered
around...
THE 13-YEAR-OLD
lying in the street, a bullet hole in his head, eyes open.
He twitches and kicks, blood pulsing from the neat wound.
Then he's dead. The faces around him (young, old, many races)
watch with a variety of emotions.
CROWD
Who is he?... Why'd they shoot him?...
Ivy did him, man... He's in the wrong
fuckin' place... That poor boy...
Get his beeper...
Cops push through to the body. As the crowd disperses, Hull
can't take his eyes off the boy. When he finally does, he
sees Eddie, drink in hand. Their eyes meet, and Eddie, a
rapper, raises his eyebrows in brief acknowledgment of sorrow.
EDDIE
(sadly)
He done done, ain't he?
TITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER
A bar with a neon bird for a sign. Hull enters.
Eddie comes out the back door of a building, is immediately
collared by Taft (the cop on the videotape). He's in his mid-
40s, stocky, balding.
TAFT
(cheerful, gregarious)
Eddie Shitface! Where you been, boy?
Eddie breaks free, runs three feet before HERNANDEZ (a
muscular Mexican) knees him in the groin. Eddie crumples.
TAFT
(continuing)
Eddie, I don't think I introduced
you to my new partner, Michael
Hernandez...
HERNANDEZ
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Shitface...
Eddie folded over his wounded nuts. Hernandez and Taft sit
on crates to either side. The drugs they've taken from him
are neatly arranged on a garbage can lid.
HERNANDEZ
You have the right to remain silent...
You have the right to an attorney...
You have the right to go back to
Ontario for eight-to-ten on a second
offense...
EDDIE
(in several kinds of
pain)
Oh, man, I can't go back in there, I
just can't.
TAFT
(soothing)
'Course you can't, child, 'course
you can't. That's why you're gonna
start giving us some help.
A pleasant, Santa Monica neighborhood. Spanish style house.
Three men: FELIX BARBOSA (whose photo we saw in Carver's
office). Barbosa is a veteran of the coke business, but he's
doing too much of the drug now; he's sweating, paranoid,
unstable. With him is GOPHER, early 60s, a wizened high-voiced
old con who Barbosa keeps the way Spanish kings kept dwarfs,
for amusement and luck; like the court jester, Gopher can
say anything he wants without fear. Behind them is an Hispanic
kid, CHINO, 17, a thug.
Elias knows them all, but is not happy to see them at his
door.
ELIAS
What are you doing here?
BARBOSA
We've got a problem, David.
ELIAS
Call me on the phone.
BARBOSA
Your friend Eddie just started bending
over for the cops.
This is very bad news. Elias murmurs a shaken, "Shit..." and
steps outside, half-closing the door behind him.
BARBOSA
(continuing)
They busted him, and he's dealing to
save his ass.
GOPHER
Which is how he'll lose the skinny
little thing.
ELIAS
Did he give us up?
BARBOSA
Not yet, but he will if he has to,
and eventually he'll have to.
MIRANDA (O.S.)
Daddy! I thought we were doing my
homework.
ELIAS
I don't think he'd talk about us.
He'd try not to.
BARBOSA
If we whack him, he definitely won't.
MIRANDA (O.S.)
Daddy!!
ELIAS
(to Miranda)
Just a second.
(to Barbosa)
Not yet. Let me check on this, first.
BARBOSA
(taunting)
Nobody said you had to do the dirty
work, David. I'll take care of --
ELIAS
Felix, if he's a problem, we'll kill
him. I'll kill him myself.
He doesn't realize until it's too late that Nancy has just
then opened the front door to see where he went. They look
at each other, a terrible moment: she knows what he does,
hates it, can't bring herself to leave him, hates herself
for that.
ELIAS
(continuing)
Nancy, get out of here.
NANCY
For you; it's Eddie.
She hands him a cordless phone, goes inside closing the door.
BARBOSA
You got a tasty wife, David. No wonder
you don't want us coming here.
ELIAS
(warning him)
Don't talk about her that way.
Barbosa laughs.
GOPHER
He can't help it, David, it's his
nature.
ELIAS
(into phone, chipper)
Eddie... Sure, man, what do you need?
Taft and Hernandez, watching the gym. Hull comes out, looks
up and down the street carefully. Taft sits up, pays
attention.
TAFT
This is our collar?
Hernandez grunts.
TAFT
(continuing)
Who is he?
HERNANDEZ
Some scumbag...
But Taft clearly thinks there's something different about
Hull. He's not sure what, but it troubles him. (NOTE: Hull
makes a little move that Taft will later realize was a cop's
move. For now he can't quite place it.)
Eddie pleading his case to Elias.
EDDIE
He's no cop, David. He's an animal.
You see his eyes? You never see a
cop with those eyes. I know this
shit, man, you don't.
ELIAS
(giving him an opening)
What's going on, Eddie?
EDDIE
Twenty-six thousand cash is what. We
need it, David. We're behind.
Elias studies Eddie: is he a rat? Elias hopes not, but he's
going to find out. He hands a fat Federal Express envelope
through the window.
ELIAS
(a warning)
I want him to get it all, Eddie.
Eddie bows in gratitude, hurries off.
Hull's unlocking his door when Belinda, the hooker across
the hall, comes out to talk. Her 6-year-old, James, watches,
silent.
BELINDA
(a crackhead)
Mr. Hull... Mr. Hull...
HULL
(wearily)
What's happening, Belinda?
BELINDA
Now you know, Mr. Hull, I was to the
welfare this afternoon, but the bus,
you know what I'm saying?... the one
bus, and then the other, and when I
got there they'd gone and changed
the time on me, without notification.
They's supposed to give notification,
ain't they? They said I got a thing
in the mail, but I don't remember, I
don't think they sent it, so now I'm
off the welfare, plus I forgot to
take James for his shot... for the
school? Which otherwise they let him
go. And he's gotta learn, he's gotta
learn, don't he, Mr. Hull, you tell
him, so's he can better hisself.
Hull slouches in the doorway, fingers to his eyes.
HULL
(to James)
You had any food today, James?
JAMES
(disclaiming any need)
I had Ding-Dongs.
HULL
(sighs, gives him
money)
You go to the Mexican place over
there, and get the chicken tostada
or the beef and bean burrito or both.
And a milk.
JAMES
I don't like milk. I want a --
HULL
(an order)
You get the milk! And get something
for your mother, too.
(to Belinda)
What do you want?
BELINDA
Now, Mr. Hull, if you just --
HULL
(to James)
Two tostadas, two burritos, two milks.
Gives him another bill. The boy runs off.
BELINDA
You now, I look out for my James
best I can, Mr. Hull, but it's hard.
Now you like the boy, don't you?
Hull grunts.
BELINDA
(continuing)
I know you do. And I was thinkin' if
you wanted to take care of him, that
might be good for him. Give him a
male figure to look up to.
HULL
Look, Belinda, I can't...
BELINDA
If you could just give me something
for him. Say five thousand dollars...
(off Hull's shock)
Or maybe four thousand. I couldn't
give up my boy for less than four
thousand...
Hull is rescued from this horror by the ringing PAY PHONE.
He runs down the hall, grabs it.
HULL
It's me. I'm here... Where?... five
minutes.
He dashes past Belinda into his room.
BELINDA
Or you could just give me a part
now...
He closes the door, takes the money Carver gave him out from
behind the mirror, dashes back outside. As he rushes by:
BELINDA
(continuing)
Let me do somethin' for you, Mr.
Hull. Let me do a little somethin'
for you.
He keeps going. The Blonde Woman addresses Belinda.
BLONDE WOMAN
No solicitin' in the halls. I told
you that before.
BELINDA
(spunkier than we've
seen)
I ain't doin' shit. Bitch...
A handful of customers under a mud sky. The THROB of a distant
helicopter. Hull pulls into the lot beside Eddie's BMW.
He climbs into the BMW, tosses Eddie a brown envelope; money
spills onto his lap. Eddie does a quick count, produces the
Fed Ex envelope. The usual white stuff.
Hull's about to taste when the chopper swoops in with a sudden
blinding overhead light. A BULLHORN booms down like the voice
of God.
AMPLIFIED VOICE
This is the police. Remain inside
the vehicle. Place your open hands
against the windshield so that they
are clearly visible...
HULL
Christ...
EDDIE
(a strategy)
Spread the floor, Dudley.
(rap sound effects
with rhythmic head
spasms)
A-ga, a-ga, a-ga, a-ga...
Eddie starts the car, and Hull rolls out the passenger door
as the BMW races across the lot.
Two black-and-whites and an unmarked converge on the stand.
Hull can't reach his car. He vaults a metal rail and runs
off between two buildings.
Hernandez jumps out of an unmarked and races after him. Taft
speeds the car out onto the street.
HULL
running. Police and SIRENS pursuing. He hurls the Fed Ex
envelope into a dumpster. HELICOPTER light sweeps over him.
As he cuts around a building, Taft opens a car door right
into his face. Hull goes down hard.
TAFT
(into car radio)
Thank you kindly...
He waves at the helicopter which goes away, kneels over Hull
who is twitching spastically on the ground, gasping for air.
Hernandez arrives carrying the Fed Ex envelope.
TAFT
(continuing)
How you doin', child?...
Hull is astonished to look up and see Taft looming over him,
the man he remembers from the videotape. He tries to speak:
HULL
(barely audible)
You...
TAFT
(briefly puzzled)
Me? Of course, it's me. You know me?
Hull shakes head, winces.
TAFT
(continuing)
Hurts, huh?
Hull tries to curse.
TAFT
(continuing)
Here, I want to show you something.
You have kids?
He takes out his wallet, opens it to pictures of his two
children, a boy and a girl, seven and eight.
TAFT
(continuing)
These are mine. Aren't they the most
beautiful children you ever saw?
Hull groans, twists in pain. Taft sticks the pictures in his
face. Hull is affected by the children despite everything.
TAFT
(continuing)
Yeah, I know, they kind of leave you
speechless. So let me ask, if someone
put a gun to your baby's head,
wouldn't you kill him if you could?
Hull just looks up.
TAFT
(continuing)
Me, too. And you're the bastard with
the gun.
He takes the Fed Ex envelope from him.
HULL
(hoarse; his first
words)
You know the difference between a
nigger and a black man?
TAFT
Don't jive me, boy.
HULL
The nigger's the one covers Whitey's
ass by puttin' the brothers in jail.
Taft yanks him hard to his feet; Hull cries out in pain.
TAFT
You ain't my brother.
After hours. The place is closed. A couple of cars in the
lot. Elias's BMW pulls in.
DEALERS going up to cars as before, only now they're Hull's
dealers. A well-dressed Black businessman buys from his BMW.
CARVER (V.O.)
But you want to be of use. You want
to get drugs off the street, don't
you?
HULL (V.O.)
That's why I'm here.
Another sale: Teenagers on foot.
CARVER (V.O.)
Well, this is the cost. Pay it or go
grow flowers someplace.
He comes out of the motel talking to a Dealer we've seen
above.
HULL
You can't back down with them. You've
got to project strength, from inside,
you know?
The Dealer nods. Across the street Hull sees:
A blue sedan. Taft and Hernandez. Taft gives Hull a little
nod and grin.
Hull sitting in an aging Trans Am, making entries in a
notebook. Across the street he watches:
A PREGNANT WOMAN (19), a squawling baby in arms, buying from
one of his Dealers.
He kicks the dash in frustrated anger. Under the MUSIC:
HULL
Cocksucker...
As soon as the woman's gone. He goes over to the Dealer,
slaps his head, slaps it again. Under the MUSIC:
DEALER
(hurt, confused)
What'd you do that for?
HULL
(walking off)
'Cause I can, motherfucker, 'cause I
can.
A white housewife making a buy from a new mini-van, a baby
in the car seat.
Two USC football players (letter jackets, huge) hassling
BIJOUX, a woman dealer, pushing her, she pushes back, curses.
Suddenly Hull comes running up, shoves them apart. He's
yelling, pointing a finger in their faces. Elias comes up
behind, calmer.
Hull is smaller than either USC kid, but they back down as
he curses them. Under MUSIC:
HULL
...Touch her again, motherfuckers,
I'm gonna mess you up.
A brief scuffle. Hull decks one USC, and Elias pulls him
off. The kids leave. Elias doubles over with laughter. Hull
yells at Bijoux and walks off.
Hull (looking at written address) knocks on a door. It's
opened by a beautiful, dark-skinned black woman in a skimpy
robe. She looks at him with disarming frankness. He thinks
he must be in the wrong place.
HULL
Is David Elias here?
ELIAS (O.S.)
Momentito...
Through the door we see him emerge from a bedroom stepping
into his loafers, buttoning his shirt. He gives the woman
along, dark kiss, caressing her body.
ELIAS
Jacqueline, ho-ney...
She laughs, closes the door. As he and Hull walk to the
street, Elias sings happily to himself:
ELIAS
(continuing)
"Who's making love to your old lady...
while you're out make love...?"
(cheerful)
How come I like balling black chicks
so much?
HULL
'Cause you're a racist asshole. You
feel like you're fucking a slave,
and it gets you off.
ELIAS
Oh, don't mau mau me with the Malcolm
X shit. Tell me you're not chasin'
white pussy every chance you get.
HULL
I don't dig white women.
(knowing that's a lie)
Even if I did, it wouldn't mean the
same thing.
ELIAS
Sure, it'd be the slave fucking the
master. Hegel talks about it. Just
like me, but the other way around.
HULL
Fuck Hegel. Who the fuck is Hegel?
Some smart-ass kike that talks
backwards?
Elias laughs, gets into Hull's car. Hull's angry, takes a
beat before he gets in.
ELIAS
Everybody digs the other, John. They
dig their own, and they dig the other.
HULL
Does your wife dig black guys, David?
Did she fuck Eddie? Does she want to
fuck me?
ELIAS
(mock-terrified)
Ooo... you mean with that great big
purple dick of yours? I hope not.
She'd never be impressed with my
little thing again.
HULL
You think what impresses her now is
your dick?
ELIAS
(musing)
What does impress her?
Hull can't help laughing. He starts the car.
Elias and Hull approach. Hull's carrying a satchel and wearing
a new leather jacket.
Hull sits in the Trans Am eating a sandwich and watching the
street as a DEALER leans in the window telling his sob story.
There's an authority to Hull's manner that tells us he may
not like this job, but he knows how to do it.
DEALER
...The guy ripped me off, man, so I
don't got the money, I don't got the
stuff and --
HULL
(eyes on street)
You gotta pay anyway.
DEALER
Oh, but, man...
As he raps on, comical pathos, Hull spots in his side
mirror...
THE RED RANGE ROVER
coming slowly this way. Ivy in the passenger window, the
barrel of an automatic weapon glinting in the streetlight.
HULL
Shit...
Hull glances up: Bijoux is selling on the next corner.
The Range Rover passes the Trans Am. Ivy leans out.
Hull flings open the Trans Am door, throwing the Dealer to
the ground. He jumps from the car:
HULL
(continuing)
Bijoux!!
She turns. Sees Ivy. She puts out her hands to block the
shots. The SOUND of the gun is inaudible. The barrel bounces
slightly. Bijoux sprawls backward.
Bijoux: dead on the sidewalk, limbs askew, bleeding from
many wounds.
Hull, standing over her, covers her face.
The body has been taken away, the crowd has cleared. Elias
sits on the hood of the Trans Am. Hull stands, staring down.
ELIAS
It wasn't your fault.
(no response)
What could you have done?
HULL
She worked for me. I'm supposed to
protect her.
Elias knows that's true, and it leads to another truth.
ELIAS
We have to kill him.
Hull looks up.
ELIAS
(continuing)
Or we lose all authority with the
other dealers. And one of them'll
kill you.
Hull looks up, startled.
ELIAS
(continuing)
You've got to assert now, or you're
dead.
Hull sees the truth of that and slowly nods.
ELIAS
(continuing)
And if we kill Ivy, we control this
whole territory.
HULL
That guy who works for Barbosa can
do it, Chino.
ELIAS
No. If we use Chino, it's Barbosa
who's asserting. It'll be Barbosa's
territory.
(again: his hatred of
Barbosa)
It's gotta be us.
HULL
Right.
ELIAS
And if it's us, it's gotta be you.
Meaning he can't do it. Hull knows that. A long beat on Hull's
face as he reaches the inevitable decision.
HULL
(to himself)
Don't blow your cover.
ELIAS
What?
HULL
If I do this, we're partners. Equal
partners on everything.
Elias offers his hand. Hull stands up, a sudden resolve.
HULL
(continuing)
Let's go.
ELIAS
(afraid)
Now...?
But Hull is already moving.
Hull and Elias driving, looking for Ivy. Elias double parks
by two prostitutes.
We STAY in the car with Hull who's silent, frightened, keeps
trying to warm his hands.
Outside, Elias is talking and laughing with the prostitutes.
We see them point. He gives them money, kisses. They laugh.
He gets back in the car.
The Range Rover parked in front. Elias's car stops. MUSIC
pounds from inside. Then one CONTINUOUS SHOT:
They pass the club, other store fronts... Turn at the
corner... Turn into an alley... Down the alley past the same
buildings... The rear door of the club... To the next
street... Turn... Turn... onto the original street, back to
the front of the club. They stop again.
HULL
Go wait around back.
Elias nods. A beat. They look at each other.
ELIAS
I want to see you in that alley.
Hull's so terrified he seems calm. With an air of submitting
himself to fate, he gets out and walks into the club.
Hull on the phone. He's unusually excited, even moved.
HULL
...Carmen, it's me. It's Daddy...
Hull pressing the phone to his face, trying to master his
emotions.
GRAINY 16MM FILM - A LABORATORY MAZE
A lab rat with a metal electrode protruding from its head,
is running a maze at high speed. A VOICE explaining things.
VOICE
(young, nasal, too
smart)
The maze leads in two directions. At
one end the rat can obtain a food
pellet. At the other...
(pointer indicates
each end)
...it receives electrical stimulus
to a very specific area of the
cerebellum...
The rat reaches this second destination, pushes a bar, is
stimulated. A lab worker (white coat, gloves) picks up the
animal, replaces it at the start. It runs the same route.
VOICE
(continuing)
This rat, like 86% of the others in
the experiment, chose the electrical
stimulus repeatedly and exclusively.
It continued to do so until it died
of malnutrition.
ANOTHER SHOT -- the rat dead.
Despite the CLOSED sign, a light's on inside. Hull knocks.
No response. He keeps knocking without let-up until:
BETTY'S VOICE
(annoyed)
Nobody's home, go away.
He knocks harder. Finally she appears in the doorway, stopping
short when she sees it's him. She's immediately aware of
white streaks on her grey suit. she tries to brush them off.
MCCUTCHEON
(doesn't want to let
him in)
Look, I'm tired, why don't you...
Hull holds up the briefcase. She sighs, unlocks the door.
MUSIC pouring into the darkness.
Elias (no sleep) driving. Betty in front. Hull in back.
HULL
We shouldn't go to them. Maybe them
come to us.
ELIAS
He wouldn't.
They pull into the lot of a boarded up restaurant where
Barbosa and Chino stand outside of a limousine.
Taft and Hernandez in the same van that was outside the gym
earlier. They're watching THROUGH BINOCULARS, night scopes.
They spot Elias's car.
HERNANDEZ
(whispering into radio)
Here they are. Nobody move until we
see the green suitcase.
The two groups meeting. Barbosa gives Betty a courtly kiss.
BARBOSA
(flirtatious)
I'm sorry for dragging you out so
late, but I have to be careful.
MCCUTCHEON
It gives me confidence.
HULL
watching planes descend into the airport, nervous. He knows
what's coming, but how does he handle it?
HULL
Let's see what we've got.
Elias takes a satchel out of the rent-a-car trunk. Chino
opens the limousine's trunk. Inside is an over-sized day-glo
green plastic suitcase. He is about to pick it up.
HULL
(continuing; spotting
the police van in
the adjacent lot)
Don't touch it.
Everyone looks at him, then the direction he's looking.
BARBOSA
What is this?
HULL
Something's wrong. What's that van
doing there?
Everyone looks. They can barely see the van. Hull pulls a
gun.
HULL
(continuing)
This is a bust. The minute we take
the stuff, they'll be over us.
BARBOSA
He's crazy, David. I thought you
were the crazy one, but it's him.
Hull puts the gun to Barbosa's head, addresses Chino:
HULL
Chino, pick up the suitcase and give
it to Elias. I'll only kill him if
something goes wrong.
Chino moves to pick up the suitcase.
BARBOSA
No!!
Everyone looks at Hull amazed, even Chino.
ELIAS
(softly)
Fucking A, John...
HULL
Okay, everybody in the car.
He throws the money in the limo truck, slams the lid. He's
running the show now, and everyone knows it. He's winging
it, but confident and strangely calm.
Elias, energized by Hull's command, grabs Barbosa and throws
him toward the limo.
HERNANDEZ'S POV THROUGH NIGHT SCOPE
TAFT
We have a problem.
HERNANDEZ
Shit! Shit! Shit!
(aiming rifle; Hull
in sights)
Enough of this...
TAFT
No!
Hull shepherding everyone into the limo. He glances toward
the van. On instinct. He pulls Chino to him.
A RIFLE SHOT
Chino's head explodes. Betty screams.
BARBOSA
(screaming at van)
Don't shoot... Don't shoot...
SIRENS. GUNFIRE. Elias drags Barbosa into the limo. Hull
throws Betty into the front seat. The limo takes off.
Hull driving, Betty up front. Elias with a gun on Barbosa in
back. Hull slaloms the limo through police GUNFIRE. Windows
are blown out. Glass everywhere.
MCCUTCHEON
(weeping)
I asked for this... I asked for it...
It's my fault...
HULL
(calm, eyes on road)
Relax. We'll make it.
She looks at him, stunned yet soothed by his certainty.
BARBOSA
He's a cop. He has to be. How else
would he have known?
HULL
If I was cop, you'd be face down
back there.
MCCUTCHEON
How did you know?
HULL
The whole thing smelled. Changing
his mind about the stuff. Meeting us
way out here. And I'd seen cops in
that van before. Hernandez is dirty,
that's who he's using.
ELIAS
(to Barbosa)
Get out of the car.
He starts to open the door.
HULL
David, not now.
ELIAS
Yes, now!
The windows shot out. Hull and Betty silent, shaken. Elias
charged up, happy.
ELIAS
Everything is different. We're the
Colombians now.
(radiant)
This is the greatest night of my
life. Terrible but great. Felix was
right...
MCCUTCHEON
(appalled)
About what?
ELIAS
He said I should kill a man. He was
right.
MCCUTCHEON
My God.
ELIAS
Barbosa was a roach. Do you miss
him? Will anybody in the world miss
him?
MCCUTCHEON
Are you a roach, too?
ELIAS
(happily)
Yes. Thank God.
MCCUTCHEON
(to Hull)
What about you?
He's silent, keeps driving. She's had enough.
MCCUTCHEON
(continuing)
Stop the car.
Hull looks at her.
MCCUTCHEON
(continuing)
Stop it!
He brakes to a stop. She jumps out, leans back in.
MCCUTCHEON
(continuing)
No more laundering, no more anything.
I'm finished with this.
And she disappears into the night. Elias watches her go.
Hull resumes driving.
ELIAS
She knows too much. We have to kill
her.
HULL
No! She's with me. She's not going
to talk.
(looks at Elias)
You touch her, I'll kill you.
ELIAS
She's your responsibility then.
Hull accepts it.
ELIAS
(continuing)
We're going to get the money now,
John. Enough for the new drug. We're
going to be rich. We're going to be
so rich that we're going to leave
the world of ordinary people and
going to a higher realm. I mean that.
HULL
They're going to come after us.
ELIAS
(matter-of-fact)
It's a hardball game. We're hardball
players.
Hernandez comes out of a bodega with groceries, wine and a
woman. He nuzzles her as he lets her into his car. As he's
getting behind the wheel, Molto (Gallegos' guard) stops the
door from closing. The conversation is entirely in SPANISH.
HERNANDEZ
It wasn't my fault.
MOLTO
It never is.
He SHOOTS him in the head. Hernandez slumps against the wheel.
The woman screams. Molto walks away.
Hull finds a door, pushes the buzzer. Betty looks through
the glass. She's afraid of him.
MCCUTCHEON
Don't kill me. I'm not going to talk.
I swear. Please.
Then she looks closer and sees not murder in his face, but
need. She opens the door. Without a word, he gathers her to
him. She can't resist him now. Her mouth is everywhere on
him.
RAMON GALLEGOS lays a bouquet of white lillies on a grave.
He kneels, whispers a prayer, crosses himself.
He rises and walks to where Molto and the other guards hold
Hull and Elias. Gallegos is in his thirties, more European
than Barbosa. He has a distinctly mild manner.
ELIAS
Who's grave?
An impudent question, but Elias seems strangely bright-eyed
despite the guns held on him.
GALLEGOS
My wife's. She died of leukemia three
years ago.
(looks around)
I like to be among the dead. They
never interrupt you.
(turning to them)
Felix Barbosa started out as a skinny
fourteen-year-old fucking Yankee
businessman in Bogata hotels. He
grew up. He made himself strong and
rich, but getting there made him
sick, and that killed him. So he
lost everything for the same reason
he'd gotten it in the first place.
Now we'll see if you can do as well.
A PRIEST going by greets Gallegos who responds warmly. They
chat a minute in SPANISH. The Priest leaves.
GALLEGOS
(continuing)
Felix owed me one million eight
hundred thousand dollars.
He addresses this to Hull; Elias feels left out.
GALLEGOS
(continuing)
When you killed him, you bought the
debt; now you owe it to me; you get
to keep thirty percent, like he did.
You have three days.
Gallegos turns to leave.
HULL
Who did Barbosa collect from?
GALLEGOS
If you don't know, you shouldn't
have killed him.
He notices Hull's earring: two tiny dice, the spots made of
minuscule jewels. Unembarrassed, he fingers it.
GALLEGOS
(continuing)
Cute... Can I have that?
Without waiting for an answer, he yanks it out of Hull's ear
and walks away, leaving Hull bleeding through his fingers
before a stone cross.
A club on the corner. THROUGH A WINDOW we see a RAP ACT on
the stage, their MUSIC pumping out onto the street. Hull
pulls up in a Jaguar. He and Elias go through a door adjacent
to the club.
Hull looking into the trunk. Elias is beat.
HULL
Where the hell is all the money?
We're still a million short.
ELIAS
I gotta get laid.
HULL
David, we've got thirty-six hours.
ELIAS
(slams trunk, moves
toward door)
Pick me up at Jacqueline's in the
morning.
HULL
Sooner than that.
Elias gets in the car and drives off. Hull turns and a dark
American sedan pulls up alongside. Carver behind the wheel.
CARVER
(an order)
Get in.
NIGHT
They get out of the car. Carver takes out a flask, has a
drink, offers it to Hull who declines.
CARVER
Never have, never will.
(puts the flask away)
I want you to give me your gun. You're
coming in right now.
HULL
(doesn't understand)
Coming in where?
CARVER
Your assignment has been terminated.
You're not going out there again. If
I have to, I'll put you in custody.
HULL
(uncomprehending)
I'm going to have Gallegos in two
days.
Carver says nothing. Suddenly Hull understands.
HULL
(continuing)
You're protecting him. You're
protecting Gallegos.
Carver snorts: ridiculous.
HULL
(continuing)
No, of course. That's why you wanted
to bust Elias and Betty. I was getting
close, and you wanted to cut this
off then... What is he, the new
Noriega? Helps you fight commies, so
you let him sell drugs to the niggers.
Two birds with one stone.
CARVER
You violated orders, so you're
through. Don't make a conspiracy
theory out of it.
HULL
(laughs)
I'm through...? Then, I might as
well have a drink after all.
Surprised, Carver reaches for the flask. As he does, Hull
grabs him, pushes him out over the edge of the building,
holds him there.
HULL
(continuing)
Now tell me the truth or they're
going to decide your troubles got
the best of you.
Carver struggles. Hull pushes him out farther. Carver dangles.
CARVER
You're insane.
HULL
All the more reason to do what I
say. Jesus, Ger, I'm having trouble
holding on...
CARVER
All right!
HULL
Say it!
CARVER
It's the State Department.
Hull pulls him back in. Carver slumps against the wall, drinks
greedily. Hull lets him for a moment, then takes the flask
away.
CARVER
(continuing)
I told you, Gallegos's uncle is a
big deal down there.
HULL
Guzman.
CARVER
Guzman, right. Our government supports
Guzman because he's a moderate. That's
a right-winger who's pro-U.S.
(he doesn't like it
either)
If Gallegos got busted here, it would
hurt Guzman's political career there.
It's politics, John, not drugs.
HULL
Drugs is politics. Politics is
drugs...
(sickened)
Christ, Gerry, I dealt drugs. I killed
a man. Others died. What did I do
all this for? For nothing.
CARVER
I'm going to Washington, John. I'll
bring you with me. We'll have clout,
money...
HULL
(outraged)
I didn't do this for clout or money.
You said we were gonna do some good.
CARVER
We tried.
HULL
Trying's for college boys.
(his head on fire)
If all there is is power and money...
If all there is... then what am I
doing here? 'Cause I can get more
power and money out on the street, I
got more there already, than I'd
ever get kissing your ass in
Washington...
CARVER
But you can't do that, John. It's
not you.
HULL
Me? There is no me. We took care of
that. First I was a cop pretending
to be a dealer. Now I'm just a dealer
pretending to be a cop. Why not stop
pretending...? Quit the force. Be a
dealer.
CARVER
It's not that simple.
HULL
My assignment's already terminated.
All I have to do is quit. I hereby
quit.
(lifts the flask)
My first one.
(drinks)
Not so bad.
He slips the flask in his pocket, gets in the car, starts
engine.
CARVER
Don't blow your cover.
Hull drives off, leaving Carver alone on the roof.
The neighborhood is reminiscent of the one where Joe Stevens
Sr. was killed. The rap club still pumps MUSIC onto the 4
A.M. streets where whores, junkies, children, teenagers with
beepers and Nikes, welfare mothers roam as if it were daytime
anywhere else. Their eyes, yearning, sullen, vital, hopeless
and hoping stare at...
HULL
Everyone knows what he is: the Black Man with the Big Car.
They don't remember when he was just another hustler making
street buys. Now they hate him, revere him, want to be him,
not caring what it entails. Every eye follows as...
He and Elias cross the street toward Gopher's door. Hull's
eyes don't go right or left. He's a driven man now.
Elias driving a car we haven't seen before and snickering to
himself at some private joke.
HULL
What are you laughing at?
Elias shakes his head: nothing. He laughs. They pull into
the lot beside a movie theater.
Hull, Elias and Molto getting into their car. Molto is
recalcitrant. Elias pistol whips him. Hull stops him.
The car passes through a development of suburban homes. They
enter a driveway. Two boys play in the yard.
ELIAS
(to Molto)
Donde esta?
Molto is silent. Elias FIRES a bullet right between his feet.
Molto jumps. The boys turn. Hull grabs the gun away. We feel
the toll Elias's madness is taking on him.
HULL
What the fuck's the matter with you?
ELIAS
It works, John. It works.
And, indeed, Molto is pointing to a Winnebago parked at the
rear of the property.
Winnebago. With a tire iron, Hull snaps off the padlock that
holds the rear door closed. He opens the door. Money gushes
out. He slams it closed.
HULL
Jesus...
He, Elias and Molto are on hands and knees scooping it up.
SAME - LATER
Molto tied to a tree. Elias is giving him instructions while,
strangely, removing Molto's shoes and socks.
ELIAS
(to Molto)
Disce a Senor Guzman que...
(his Spanish isn't
good enough)
...that we have his money, and we're
willing to talk as soon as he comes
to town. We'll know how to reach
him. Okay?
Molto just glares at him. Elias smiles, takes the shoes and
socks and all the contents of Molto's into the Winnebago,
and he and Hull drive away, leaving the car behind.
The Winnebago enters the garage, Elias greeting the attendant,
"Hey, Frank." Frank waves him in.
The garage is filled with various RVs. Hull pulls the
Winnebago into an empty spot beside Elias's car and gets
out. Elias remains in the cabin making calculations.
ELIAS
Approximating the cubic capacity and
depending on the denominations of
the bills, it's somewhere between
fifty million and two hundred million
dollars. Right back there.
As he does, Hull checks his gun, walks around behind the
vehicle and prepares to shoot Elias in the back of the head
through the open window. Elias finishes his money report,
and sits there as if unaware of Hull, but:
ELIAS
(continuing; not
turning around)
Think I'm crazy?
HULL
Yes.
(blowing up, gun still
on him)
I can't believe you got us into this.
All of fucking Latin America is going
to be after our asses, including
Renaldo Guzman who's friends with
fucking George Bush.
ELIAS
I know they're coming after us. I
want them to. We'll give them the
money, but we'll make a deal for
ourselves. We'll get what we need
for the synthetic drugs. I've thought
it all out. I've been thinking it
out for years.
Hull uncocks the gun, rubs it against his burning face. Elias
turns around, embraces him.
ELIAS
(continuing)
We're going to have everything. Don't
you want everything, John?
HULL
They're going to get your family,
David. They'll kill your wife and
daughter.
ELIAS
(serene)
Nancy and Miranda left the country
two days ago.
HULL
You knew about this then?
Elias smiles.
HULL
(continuing)
What about Betty?
A car SQUEALS to a stop. Molto and three thugs smash through
the glass door. They disappear into the store where things
can be heard BREAKING. They emerge a moment later, jump into
the car.
Hull's car races up. He jumps out, dashes toward the building.
Hull hurrying Betty toward his car. She's protesting.
MCCUTCHEON
I've got to get clothes.
HULL
You can't go back.
Hull and Betty hurry toward his room carrying shopping bags,
a newly bought suitcase. They see...
COPS
They freeze, turn, ready to bolt. But more cops behind them.
A panic, yet no one's coming after them. They walk on. The
cops are going into and coming out of Belinda's room.
Hull and Betty are about to enter Hull's room. The door is
ajar.
Hull putting Betty into an airport limousine.
HULL
(to the driver)
International terminal.
(to Betty)
I'll meet you there in a week.
She kisses him. He's about to close the door. She stops it.
MCCUTCHEON
You know the first time, when I saw
you in the bar...?
HULL
(smiles at the memory)
You wouldn't even look at me.
MCCUTCHEON
'Cause I knew what you were thinking.
You were judging me.
HULL
No, I wasn't, I was...
MCCUTCHEON
You were. Your eyes were like an
angel in my heart telling me I should
be good, and I didn't want to hear
it.
This news startles Hull, yet, strangely, he senses its truth,
and the sweetness is more than he can bear.
MCCUTCHEON
(continuing)
That's you, too. Maybe this is you,
I don't know, but I know that's you.
She closes the door. The car pulls away.
In an unmarked car up the street, Taft picks up the radio.
A limousine pulls into the gate and disgorges RENALDO GUZMAN,
55, and his wife, 25. They're shown into the consulate.
The limousine pulls out onto the street and parks. Gopher
appears, knocks on the driver's window. It comes down. They
chat briefly in Spanish. Gopher opens up a cellular phone.
Gopher hands a piece of paper to the limo driver. He walks
away...
AROUND THE CORNER
As he's about to get into a car, Taft grabs him. Gopher is
surprised and not pleased.
Where Hull and Elias left the Winnebago. Guzman's limo
approaches. Frank, the attendant, waves it on.
Taft with Gopher in his car.
TAFT
Do they have money in there?
GOPHER
I don't know.
TAFT
They wouldn't meet here otherwise.
Gopher shrugs; a decision: Taft picks up his radio.
TAFT
(continuing)
Okay, everybody, here's the play...
Cars with rotating dome lights, but not many cops.
Hull and Elias emerge from a shadowy doorway and make their
way at a casual pace beyond the perimeter of police cars,
quickly mingling with other spectators. They continue down...
Strolling now. Elias elated, uncontained joy.
ELIAS
We did it. Twenty million. Twenty
fucking million. We're going to have
synthetics. We're gonna be rich.
We're gonna...
Hull stops walking and just stands there.
ELIAS
(continuing)
What's the matter, John? Be happy.
Your whole life has just been solved.
VOICE
(behind them)
Stop! Police!
In one motion, Elias draws his gun, turns and FIRES.
The figure goes down. Elias can't believe he hit him.
Hull starts toward the figure.
ELIAS
(heading the other
way)
John, where are you going?
Taft -- on the ground.
HULL
Oh, Jesus, no...
He drops to his knees. Blood oozes from Taft's chest.
ELIAS
John, what the hell are you doing?
Let's get out of here.
Hull tries to hold closed the wound. The posture duplicates
Hull with his dying father. He feels for a pulse. For breath.
HULL
(distraught)
He's dying.
ELIAS
Let him die. Let him die twice. Come
one.
He pulls at Hull who won't go. Hull does mouth-to-mouth.
Taft opens his eyes, looks up at him.
HULL
[Says to Taft whatever a CPR-trained
policeman would say in this
situation.]
(to Elias)
Get help.
ELIAS
Are you kidding me?
TAFT
(to Hull, getting it)
Oh, man, you're a cop. You're a cop,
aren't you?
HULL
(with difficulty, as
if against his will)
Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a fucking cop...
ELIAS
(laughs)
Oh, really? Where's you badge?
HULL
I don't have one. I'm undercover.
Get help, David.
ELIAS
John, that's a cop. He tried to kill
you.
HULL
He didn't know.
ELIAS
Oh, he didn't know. I don't know.
Maybe you don't know. Maybe you think
you're a cop because... because...
HULL
Drop the gun, put your hands against
the car. Spread your legs... Police!
Taft grunts once, stiffens.
HULL
(continuing)
My God! Please...
The pulse is gone. Hull begins to perform CPR.
ELIAS
Okay, let's say you're a cop. Be a
cop.
Hull keeps doing CPR.
ELIAS
(continuing)
We've still got the money. We put it
into Randy's chemistry set. In five
years we're worth five hundred million
each, minimum. You'll be one of the
richest black men in America. Richer
than Cosby. Who gives a shit how you
got it? You think the white ones
were honest?
Hull keeps working on Taft.
ELIAS
(continuing)
Is this asshole all that stands
between you and greatness? Let me do
you a favor.
He puts a gun to Taft's head and FIRES. In a reflex, Hull
draws his own gun, SHOOTS Elias in the stomach. Stunned, he
wobbles backward a few steps. Sits on the street.
ELIAS
(continuing)
Gee, John, that's kind of an extreme
reaction.
Hull is stunned he did it. And this finally attracts the
police who see a black man with a gun who just shot a white
man.
Hull goes to Elias who's dead. A POLICEMAN pulls him off,
beating him with a gun.
POLICEMAN
Fucking nigger...
Carver takes his eye from the now obscured peephole.
A funeral. Taft's wife and children (from the wallet photo)
leave the graveside with the rest of the funeral party.
When everyone is gone, Hull approaches the grave. From his
pocket, he removes the four blood-soaked bills his father
gave him, and wedges these among the stems of flowers that
already cover the plot.
He's silent a moment, then he gets up. He joins Carver who's
standing with Hull's children. The kids each take his hand,
they walk together.
CARVER
Betty walked out of court free this
morning. That's my side of the deal.
HULL
(to the children)
You two run on ahead.
They do. Hull watches them go.
CARVER
Her probation gets revoked the minute
you fuck up. I want you to stay away
from her altogether.
HULL
You know the difference between a
black man and a nigger?
Carver smiles, shakes his head. He likes a good joke. Hull
punches him so hard in the stomach that he goes to his knees.
HULL
(continuing)
The nigger's the one who'd even think
about doing what you tell him.
He walks away. Still on his knees, doubled over, Carver
whispers after him:
CARVER
Don't blow your cover.
FADE OUT.
