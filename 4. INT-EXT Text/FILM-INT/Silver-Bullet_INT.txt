NIGHT
He drops his tools, pulls on his work gloves, and trains the
light on the switch for a moment. During this:
ARNIE (sings)
It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real
frosty treat, won't you try, won't you
buy Rheingold beer...
He tries the switch. No go. It's frozen.
ARNIE
Stuck tighter'n dogshit in a deep freeze!
He takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishes
a churchkey from one of the front ones. He pops the cap and
drinks deeply. He burps. Then he screws the half-empty
bottle of beer into the cinders so it won't fall over. Then
he picks up his crowbar.
CREDITS CONTINUE.
TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE
NIGHT
a.) VIRGIL CUTTS, owner of Virgil's Texaco, is filling up a
car. We hear the HOWl... and VIRGIL looks up uneasily.
b.) In the barber shop, BILLY McCLAREN, the barber, is just
taking the apron off the Methodist minister, REV. O'BANION.
They both look around.
c.) Folks are coming out of the Gem Theater. They pause at
the sound of that HOWL and look toward the edge of town.
THE CROWD
DAY
Most of the town is here, seated on folding chairs. We're
looking particularly at three people - NAN COSLAW, her
husband BOB, and their fourteen-year-old daughter, JANE. It
is JANE - a slightly older JANE - who we have heard
speaking. She is now a bit bored with the meeting, which has
been going on for some time. As the APPLAUSE CONTINUES, she
leans toward her mother.
JANE
I'm going out for a while, 'kay?
NAN
All right. Stay close. And make sure your
brother's all right.
As JANE gets up, the applause starts to fade a bit.
NOTE: JANE is wearing a silver crucifix, and will continue
to wear it through the whole movie.
THE PODIUM
DAY
To one side is a big black-and-white photograph on an easel.
It shows a van which has been customized into an emergency
medical unit.
Behind the podium are four chairs. REV. TOM O'BANION sits in
one of them. ANDY FAIRTON sits in another, red-faced and
beaming. JOE HALLER, the town constable, is just returning
to his; LESTER LOWE is just approaching the mike as the
applause dies. LOWE'S face shines with love and goodwill.
LOWE
For the last ten years...
No amplification. He taps the mike.
JANE
She is making her way down the row to the aisle (the people
should be seated in folding chairs). She passes a GIRL of
about her own age who has overheard NAN'S parting shot.
GIRL (mocking)
"Make sure your brother's all right."
JANE (low)
Marty's a booger.
She reaches the aisle and starts out.
THE PODIUM, FEATURING FATHER LOWE
He taps the mike again.
THE CROWD, FEATURING BOB AND NAN COSLAW
BOB (good-natured)
Just pretend you're in your own church
askin' for money, father! It'll work fine!
Good-natured laughter greets this.
LOWE AT THE PODIUM
A bit flustered, he taps the mike and is rewarded by a BRIEF
SCREAM OF FEEDBACK.
LOWE
For the last ten years, I have had a
dream. A dream of a time when modern
medical care would come to this small
community, which sometimes seems so far
from Durham, with her lifesaving
hospitals. I hope that this meeting, at
which I see so many of my friends
gathered, will be the start of making my
dream come true.
SOUND: Enthusiastic applause.
THE PODIUM, WITH LOWE
LOWE
An endeavor like this seems to me to be
the very definition of community - all
of us pulling together as one, farmers
and merchants... Protestants and Catholics...
THE PODIUM, WITH REV. O'BANION
O'BANION
Let us pray.
THE TOWN HALL GATHERING
Most of them bow their heads.
REV. O'BANION, AT THE PODIUM
O'BANION
May the Grace of God shine upon those
gathered here... and lift them up... and
grant success to the endeavor to which
they have so openheartedly declared their
support. Amen.
THE GATHERING
They raise their heads. Some echo the "Amen." Others cross
themselves.
THE STATION WAGON
DAY
BOB and NAN COSLAW are sitting up front. MARTY and JANE are
in the backseat. JANE is as far from MARTY as she can get.
She's still mad as hell. Band-Aids crisscross her knees.
MARTY'S wheelchair is collapsed in the cargo area of the
wagon.
NAN turns around to look at the kids - and it's really JANE
she's mad at.
NAN
I want you two to bury the hatchet.
You're being very silly, Jane.
JANE (hot)
Did you see my knees?
MARTY
Jane, I-
NAN
I think you're being mean as well as
silly. Your brother has never had a
scraped knee in his whole life.
Well, here it is - the chief source of JANE'S animus against
her brother and the source of most of the tension in the
COSLAW family.
MARTY winces and turns away a little, embarrassed - this
always happens. He doesn't like it, but he doesn't know how
to make his parents - his mother in particular - quit it.
JANE
You always take his side because he's a
cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's
a cripple!
MARTY
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I
couldn't stop him.
JANE
Brady's a booger and so are you!
NAN
Jane Coslaw!
BOB (roars)
Stop it or I'll throw the whole bunch of
you out!
In this traditional family unit, BOB is the Voice of
Authority. They all heed, although the atmosphere remains
thundery.
THE STATION WAGON
DAY
Train tracks run near the road.
THE STATION WAGON, ENSEMBLE
DAY
BOB (points)
That's where poor old Arnie Westrum
pitched his last drunk.
He crosses himself and they all look toward:
THE CAR
DAY
BOB
They had to pick up what was left of
him in a peach basket.
JANE
Oh, Daddy! Gross!
MARTY
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad?
That's what Brady said.
JANE
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit.
I mean it.
NAN (no sympathy)
You're not going to vomit, Jane. And I
think we've all had quite enough of this
horror-movie talk.
MARTY, CLOSER
DAY
Craning back to look at the spot where ARNIE bit the dust.
His face is thoughtful, solemn.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE DOOR TO JANE'S BEDROOM, WITH MARTY
NIGHT
He is in his "house wheelchair" - not the Silver Bullet (he
was in the Bullet during the Common scene, but we didn't get
a very good look at it). He has some stuff on his lap. A
box, for sure.
MARTY
Can I come in?
JANE
Her eyes are open but she says nothing. Just looks at the
wall.
MARTY
He rolls across to her bed and puts something on her night
table. SOUND of change and a rattle of paper. She rolls over
and sees he's put about three bucks on the table. Plus a can
of mixed nuts.
JANE
What's the money for?
MARTY
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
JANE
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
MARTY
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God.
Please take the money. I want to make up.
She looks at him and sees he's sincere - honestly contrite.
She softens. There's hope for these two kids yet, maybe.
JANE
I can get a pair of L'Eggs down at the
pharmacy for a dollar forty-nine. Here.
She pushes the rest back to him, then looks at the can. She
picks it up, curious.
MARTY
That's for you, too. Uncle Al gave it
to me-
JANE (scorn)
That drunk!
MARTY
-but I want you to have it.
He gives her a warm, melting smile. When your little brother
is being good to you it's time to watch out - but JANE has
been lulled. She starts to open it, then looks questioningly
at him.
MARTY
Yeah, go ahead.
She opens it. A long paper snake - the kind with a spring
inside it - leaps out. She shrieks.
JANE
You booger!
MARTY backs up the wheelchair so he's out of her reach.
MARTY (grinning)
It really is for your birthday, though -
try it on Brady. He'll wet his pants.
JANE
Go to hell!
MARTY, BY THE DOOR
MARTY (smiling)
I love you, Janey.
JANE, IN BED
She tries to be angry with him... and cannot (this is a
response, we'll find, that both MARTY and his UNCLE AL
evoke). She smiles at him a little.
MARTY
He reverses his wheelchair, also smiling a little, and
leaves.
THE LIVING ROOM OF THE RANDOLPH HOUSE
STELLA'S MOTHER, asleep in front of the TV.
A PRETTY CHINA DISH, CU
A whole bunch of capsules are dumped into it.
THE CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show us STELLA, sitting by her
vanity mirror. The rest of the room is reflected in the
mirror, including the window - we are upstairs.
[NOTE: It would be nice to see that fat moon floating in the
window!]
There's a framed picture of STELLA's ex-boyfriend on the
vanity beside the dish of pills. STELLA sets down the empty
prescription bottle the pills came from beside this picture.
We can clearly read the word "Nembutol" on it. There is also
a large glass of water on the vanity table.
STELLA turns the picture facedown. She might be crying but
probably she's not. She takes about five of the pills,
starts to lift them to her mouth-
A HOWL outside... closer.
STELLA looks around for a moment, then takes the pills with
some water. She pauses, looking at herself.
STELLA
Suicides go to hell. Especially if
they're pregnant. And I don't even care.
She takes another five pills. And another five.
SOUNDS: Rattling foliage.
STELLA AT THE VANITY TABLE
She takes another handful of pills... and the window behind
her shatters inward. There is a bellowing roar as the
werewolf throws itself through.
THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER
She sits up, startled awake.
From upstairs: ANOTHER SHATTERING ROAR... FOLLOWED BY A
SCREAM.
STELLA'S ROOM, WITH STELLA
She runs... and a huge claw-hand rips through the back of
her nightgown.
THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER
MOTHER
Oh my dear God... Stella!
She runs for the doorway and the hall. From upstairs comes a
confusion of SOUNDS: roars, breaking furniture, shattering
glass.
STELLA'S BED, CU
One of those deadly claw-hands sweeps down the bed, ripping
through the sheets... the mattress... the spring itself.
Hairy, muddy feet with protruding talons leap onto it.
THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH MOTHER
She's found an ancient pistol somewhere and is lugging it
gamely along.
MOTHER
Stella!...Stella!
She reaches the closed door of STELLA's room, vacillates
there for a moment... and then pushes it open and goes in.
A long beat of silence as we hold on the door.
MOTHER SHRIEKS.
MOTHER'S FACE, ECU
She shrieks again.
STELLA'S ROOM, WIDE
It's a total shambles; blood is splattered everywhere; the
mirror is broken, the picture of DAN the gay deceiver is
broken; the bed is torn in two. There are big, muddy
wolfprints on the remnants of the bed.
STELLA lies propped in the corner with Nembutols all around
her. Suicide may have been what she planned, but it sure
isn't what happened.
MOTHER SHRIEKS.
A HALLWAY, FEATURING A DOOR WITH A PEBBLED-GLASS PANEL
Neatly lettered on the panel: TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABULARY.
And below this: JOSEPH HALLER.
JOE HALLER (voice)
Okay...yes...Oh, fuck off!
THE CONSTABLE'S OFFICE, WITH HALLER AND PETE SYLVESTER
HALLER slams the phone down with an angry bang. He looks
like a guy who has been up all night. PETE, his pudgy
deputy, looks like a high school athlete who has suddenly
found himself batting in the World Series.
PETE
What'd they say, Joe?
HALLER
They said they'd be here by noon.
PETE (nervous)
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea telling
that Smokey Bear from the Detective
Division to fuck off, Joe.
HALLER (morosely)
I waited until he hung up. Jesus, what a
mess. I wish I'd stayed in the army. Let's
go on out there.
He gets slowly up.
THE KITCHEN DOORWAY, WITH NAN COSLAW
NIGHT
She's wiping her hands with a dishtowel and looks like she
just bit into a lemon.
THE DEN, WITH UNCLE AL AND MARTY
NIGHT
UNCLE AL is the family's sheep of a darker color. He's
thirty, good-looking, raffish. He's also drunk. He's got
both whiskey and beer. An ashtray beside him overflows with
butts.
He and MARTY are playing draw poker for MARTY'S baseball
cards. Each has a pile in front of him.
MARTY really loves UNCLE AL... his eyes just glow when he
looks at him.
MARTY
Okay, okay. I call.
He tosses in three baseball cards.
UNCLE AL
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
He grabs one of MARTY'S cards, looks at it, and tosses it
back.
UNCLE AL
Ralph Houk! You can't bet a manager!
Stone the crows!
MARTY
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
UNCLE AL
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
He swallows whiskey and chases it with beer.
THE DEN, A WIDER ANGLE
NAN comes briskly over. She's seen and heard enough. She
favors UNCLE AL with a glare and then looks protectively at
MARTY.
NAN
Come on, Marty- bedtime.
She starts to wheel him away.
MARTY
Mom-!
UNCLE AL
Let the boy finish the game, Nan.
He means it, drunk or not. She reluctantly rolls MARTY back
to the table.
NAN
Make it quick.
UNCLE AL lays down his hand.
UNCLE AL
Three kings.
MARTY (delighted)
I got a straight to the queen!
UNCLE AL
Bullshit luck!
NAN (outraged)
That's enough!
MARTY (as his mother wheels him away)
Aww, Mom-!
THE STAIRWELL OF THE COSLAW HOME
MARTY is sitting in a stair chair that rises slowly to the
second floor. He looks dejected and glum.
SOUND of NAN hectoring her brother AL. I don't think we can
make out all of what's going on, but we've all known women
like NAN and I think we can fill in the blanks. "Christian
household... you come here drunk and expect... can't even
bother to call ahead..." Etc., etc.
A wheelchair stands on the second-floor landing. This one is
no Silver Bullet, only the more humble sort that moves by
arm power. When the stair chair clicks to a stop, MARTY
hoists himself from it into the wheelchair and rolls down
the hall toward the bathroom.
Below, NAN'S rant is still going on.
THE DEN, WITH NAN AND UNCLE AL
NIGHT
UNCLE AL is clearing up in a kind of drunken stupor- and I
mean he is really drunk. He's smoking one cigarette; another
is smoldering away in the heaping ashtray. He drops a pile
of baseball cards on the floor and bonks his head on the
table bending down to pick them up.
NAN
I don't want you drinking around Marty.
That's too much. If you can't stop it,
you better stay away.
AL straightens up. There is a sort of command force in this
man, and here he is partly able to rise above his abysmal
drunkenness so we can see it.
UNCLE AL
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
NAN
Yes... you've always been that to him.
But if you can't leave your booze in
whatever dump you call home, you better
just stay away.
She leaves the room, almost crying. UNCLE AL looks after
her, and then his attention is drawn to the smoldering
ashtray. He pours beer over the mess, putting out the fire
but creating something that looks even worse. He begins
drunkenly picking up again.
UNCLE AL (to himself)
Another wonderful time at Sister Nan's
house! Heeyyy!
THE UPSTAIRS COSLAW BATHROOM
MARTY, now in pj's, is brushing his teeth.
JANE comes in- she's wearing a nightie.
MARTY
Mom was really mad at him this time,
wasn't she?
JANE
What do you expect, when he comes in
smelling like a brewery and looking like
an unmade bed?
MARTY
Stop it!
He lunges at her, but JANE steps back easily. MARTY
overbalances and falls out of the wheelchair. His toothbrush
clatters across the tile.
BOB COSLAW (sleepy voice)
Hey! That you, Marty?
JANE
He's okay, Dad!
She looks around swiftly, then bends down.
MARTY AND JANE, A MUCH CLOSER SHOT
One of MARTY'S cheeks is pressed against the floor. His eyes
are shut. He's weeping.
JANE (low)
Marty, are you all right?
MARTY
Yes. Go away.
JANE
Let me help you up.
NAN (voice)
Marty?
SOUND of her climbing the stairs.
JANE throws a quick look back over her shoulder and then
helps MARTY up in his chair. He helps by pulling on the sink
counter. JANE has time to give MARTY one quick look- "Please
don't tell on me," it says.
NAN comes in.
NAN
Jane, have you been teasing your
brother again?
MARTY
She wasn't, Mom- I dropped my toothbrush
and fell over when I tried to get it. Jane
helped pick me up.
He bats his eyes at her.
MARTY (syrupy voice)
Jane's wunnnderful.
JANE picks up his toothbrush.
JANE (hands it to him)
Here. Brush them good, Marty. Some of that
shit in your head might leak down into your
mouth and poison you.
NAN
Jane Coslaw!
But JANE stalks off. MARTY is grinning. It was a good
put-down.
TAMMY'S BEDROOM
NIGHT
She's deeply asleep.
THE LIVING ROOM
NIGHT
"Big-time Wrestling" on the TV. SOUND of a refrigerator door
closing. MILT STURMFULLER comes into the living room from
the kitchen. He's wearing his long johns with the designer
pee stains and has a quart bottle of Rheingold the dry beer
in each hand. He sits down, looking at the TV.
MILT (drunk)
Give him the airplane! Wring his neck!
THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MILT
He looks up briefly- he's heard something- but the crowd on
the TV is loud and the match is reaching its climax.
MILT (all eyes again)
Give him the sleeper, you fuckin bugwit!
MILT, IN THE LIVING ROOM
Looks toward the window. He gets up, goes over, and looks
out.
THE HALL, WITH MILT
He takes a shotgun from the wall, breaks it, and looks
inside.
MILT
Let's see if you want to come back and
break my pots all to shit after I put
some rock salt in your asses!
THE STURMFULLER GREENHOUSE
NIGHT
The door at the end SCREECHES OPEN and MILT, still holding
the shotgun at port arms, comes cautiously in. This place is
really overgrown.
MILT advances slowly into the jungle of plants, and the
director will shoot it as he likes to build the suspense.
I'm sure that plants brush his face, and a bug or two- maybe
even a big plump spider- will land on him.
He hears a SCUTTERING SOUND and whirls.
MILT (shouts)
Who's there?
GREENHOUSE FLOOR, MILT'S POV
NIGHT
A mouse goes running across the warped boards (which have
pulled apart from each other, showing deep cracks between).
MILT
NIGHT
He relaxes and starts forward again. We keep expecting it to
happen, but it keeps not happening.
Then, as MILT is starting back toward the door, two big,
hairy arms come up through the floor- bursting through two
of those cracks and shoving the splintered boards upward-
and grab MILT'S legs at the knees.
SOUNDS: BESTIAL ROARS.
MILT screams and triggers off the shotgun- unfortunately, it
is pointing straight up. Glass showers down on him. He is
pulled down into the shattered hole- now we can see him only
from the knees up.
TAMMY STURMFULLER'S BEDROOM
She sits up in bed.
SOUNDS of ROARS and MILT SCREAMING from the greenhouse.
MRS. STURMFULLER, in a nightgown with her hair done up in
rollers, comes into Tammy's room.
MRS. STURMFULLER
Tammy, where's your father?
SOUND: Another SCREAM from the greenhouse.
THE GREENHOUSE, WITH MILT
He's now waist deep in the hole in the floor, surrounded by
broken, splintered boards.
SOUNDS: RIPPING FLESH, CRUNCHING BONES. MILT SHRIEKS.
He is abruptly jerked downward again. He is being eaten from
the feet up. As he's jerked down, one of the leaning,
splintered boards rams into his chest. MILT collapses over
it like an old Roman collapsing on his sword.
A hairy arm reaches up and grabs his neck. MILT is jerked
all the way into the hole, board and all.
TAMMY AND MRS. STURMFULLER
They are hugging each other, terrified, by the window.
OWEN'S PUB
At a f.g. table: VIRGIL CUTTS, BOBBY ROBERTSON, ELMER
ZINNEMAN, and his brother PORTER ZINNEMAN. Behind them, at
the bar, we see PETE SYLVESTER having a beer with BILLY
McCLAREN. As we look around the bar, we will also see FATHER
LESTER LOWE, sitting at an unobtrusive corner table, nursing
a beer and listening closely to the conversation.
ELMER (to VIRGIL)
Don't tell me an animal can't rip a man
up the way Milt Sturmfuller was ripped up!
VIRGIL
But the woman's bed was ripped right down
the middle, Elmer- it's take a chainsaw to
do something like that!
PORTER
Damn straight!
ELMER
Shut up, Porter. (To VIRGIL) What about the
tracks?
ANDY FAIRTON has joined the group. He sits down uninvited.
VIRGIL
That could be something to throw off the
cops. And it ain't animals that try to
confues the law; it's people do that.
ANDY FAIRTON
Law around here don't need much confusing.
PETE looks around at this. Being the deputy constable and
ineffectual by nature, he's pretty sensitive.
ANDY (deep disgust)
Joe Haller couldn't find his own ass if
someone rammed it full of radium and gave
him a Geiger counter.
PETE SYLVESTER (comes over)
Could be I know a fella who's still PO'd
over getting fined two hundred bucks for
that little fender bender out on the Ridge
Road last year.
ANDY
Could be I know a fat old fella who ought to
take care of his mouth before someone comes
along and turns it inside out. I pay Joe
Haller's salary to keep the people in this
town safe, and he ain't doing it.
BILLY McCLAREN, AT THE BAR
He's looking toward the table where the Fairton group sits.
BILLY (mildly)
Last town report said you was in arrears
your taxes, Andy. Guess you must have paid
up, huh?
THE FAIRTON TABLE
ANDY
What are you, trying to be smart?
OWEN KNOPFLER comes over.
OWEN
You guys turn down the thermostat or I'm
gonna turn you all out. Now who's drinking?
ANDY (sulks)
Bring me a Schlitz.
OWEN'S PUB
LATE DUSK
The former patrons are still here, with the exceptions of
LOWE, BILLY McCLAREN, and BOBBY ROBERTSON. Many others have
appeared; this is Happy Hour. Among them we see MR.
ASPINALL, the principal, and PELTZER, the druggist. A
barmaid, NORMA, circulates with drinks and beers.
Speaking of beer, ANDY FAIRTON has gotten through a fair
amount of Schlitz. It hasn't mellowed him, however; he's
more belligerent than ever.
ANDY (holding forth)
This whole investigation has been as
efficient as a Polish fire drill! It-
PETE (bravely)
I've heard enough out of you, Andy. If
you don't shut your mouth, I'm going to
shut it for you.
THE DOOR OF OWEN'S PLACE
It opens and a man in a business suit- HERB KINCAID- comes
in. He is carrying a briefcase and he looks worried.
THE GROUP AT THE FAIRTON TABLE
ANDY (astounded)
What did you say?
THE BAR, WITH OWEN KNOPFLER
OWEN
Jesus wept.
He reaches under the bar and comes out with a baseball bat.
Burned into the side of the bat, so it reads vertically
toward the handle, is the word "peacemaker." OWEN hurries
around the bar with it.
THE FAIRTON GROUP
PETE is standing in front of ANDY, fists balled up, fat face
trembling with determination.
PETE
You heard what I said, motormouth.
ANDY gets up, infuriated. There's apparently going to be a
brawl. Behind them, HERB KINCAID has approached the table.
HERB hasn't even noticed what's going on; he's got problems
of his own.
HERB KINCAID
He clears his throat. This is a mild, timid man- he doesn't
like to speak in public, particularly not in a bar, but the
imperatives of the situation demand it right now.
HERB (quite loudly)
Has anyone in here seen my son Brady?
THE PUB, A NEW ANGLE
Everyone looks at HERB. Conversation stops. ANDY and PETE
freeze with their fists balled up, like little kids playing
statues tag. OWEN is caught a little distance from ANDY and
PETE, with the "peacemaker" still in his hands.
OWEN'S PUB
All conversation has stopped. All have turned toward the
door and the windows; all hear the HOWL. Deep fright
overlies each face.
NORMA drops her tray. Glasses and bottles shatter.
THE MAIN CORRIDOR OF THE TOWN HALL
JOE HALLER comes out of the constable's office in a hurry,
letting the door bang the wall. He's buckling on his gun
belt.
OWEN'S PUB
HERB
Brady!
He breaks for the door. ANDY FAIRTON grabs him.
HERB
Get out of my way!
He pushes ANDY aside. HERB is out the door, chased by PETE
and several of the others.
HOLY FAMILY CHURCH
DAY
MARTY'S chair is at the back of the church. Most of the
mourners are crying. MRS. BOWIE is playing the organ.
BRADY'S coffin is on a bier at the front - closed of course.
There are lots of flowers.
JANE (v-o continues)
...but when it came to such unpleasant
duties as taking Marty to the funeral
of his best friend...
UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, AND MRS. STURMFULLER IN A PEW
As we look at them, from left to right: UNCLE AL, MARTY,
TAMMY, MRS. STURMFULLER.
UNCLE AL unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his
hip pocket. Engraved on it in Old English letters is the
word "rotgut." He spins the cap and takes a quick knock. He
pauses and glances at MARTY, who looks deeply stunned.
JANE (v-o continues)
...they didn't at all mind drafting him.
As to the sort of comfort Uncle Al may
have been able to offer him...
UNCLE AL hands the flask to MARTY. MARTY looks at him
questioningly for a moment, and then drinks. MARTY looks at
TAMMY, who looks frankly terrible. Her mother is looking
away. MARTY nudges her. She looks around at him. He offers
her the flask. Her eyes widen.
JANE (v-o continues)
...I now believe that was best kept between
the two of them...
After a brief moment's consideration, TAMMY takes the flask
and has a deep swallow. She hands the flask back to MARTY,
who hands it quickly back to UNCLE AL as TAMMY coughs. Her
mother looks at her... then at MARTY and UNCLE AL. UNCLE AL
smiles sympathetically, hiding the flask with one hand, as
if to say, "Isn't it a terrible thing?" MRS. STURMFULLER
looks distractedly back toward the service.
JANE (v-o concludes)
...or among the three of them.
UNCLE AL pockets the flask just as the organ stops playing.
THE PODIUM, WITH FATHER LOWE
LOWE
Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there
be no mass said here this afternoon. There
will be a requiem mass for Brady Kincaid
this Sunday. They did ask me to say a word
of comfort to you, if I could.
He looks out at them.
THE CONGREGATION
They look back at LOWE, hoping for some help in
understanding this awful thing.
LOWE, ABOVE THE COFFIN
LOWE
If there is any word of comfort I can give
you, it's just this: the face of the beast
always becomes known; the time of the beast
always passes.
He is struggling with this, trying dreadfully hard.
LOWE
If there are times when we feel alone and
afraid, only small creatures in the dark,
then these are the times when we must turn
to one another for our comfort and our hope.
To our neighbors. To our community. To our
love for each other. I alone cannot ease
the pain for Herb and Naomi Kincaid, nor can
I ease your pain, nor you ease mine. But if
I believe anything it's this: we can comfort
each other. We can heal each other. We can
go on together.
THE CONGREGATION, WITH MARTY AND TAMMY
The kids are crying. MARTY puts an arm around TAMMY and she
puts her head on his shoulder.
FATHER LOWE
LOWE
The Bible tells us not to fear the terror
that creepeth by night or that which flieth
by noonday, and yet we do... we do. Because
there is much we don't know, and we feel
very small. But we must not be alone. We must
not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is
the wide gate to the hell of terror. Turn to
each other. Join hands in your sorrow and try
to remember that the face of the beast always
becomes known. (Pause) The time of the beast
always passes. (Pause) Let us pray.
THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL
UNCLE AL
You all right, Marty?
MARTY
Yeah.
UNCLE AL
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than
a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You
ever hear that one?
MARTY
No.
UNCLE AL
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They
better get the guy.
MARTY
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
UNCLE AL
Huh?
MARTY
What if it's some kind of monster?
UNCLE AL (laughs)
Jesus, Marty! Come off it!
THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL
MARTY
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
UNCLE AL
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend
they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't
anybody ever tell you that the only monsters
are in comic books and drive-in movies?
THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL
MARTY
Tammy said she'd been hearing noises in
that greenhouse. Growling noises, like a
big animal. Her father was killed that night.
UNCLE AL looks at him doubtfully for a moment, as if almost
believing. Then he shakes his head.
UNCLE AL
Marty, you have to get this idea out of
your head. Psychotics are more active
when the moon is full, and this guy is a
psycho. He's going to turn out to be as
human as you or me. (Pause) In a manner of
speaking. Now let's get you inside.
He opens his door and gets out.
MARTY, CLOSER
He would like to believe UNCLE AL... but he doesn't.
OWEN'S PUB
LATE AFTERNOON
ANDY FAIRTON
Okay, you all know what group you're in and
what area you'll be covering, right?
PORTER ZINNEMAN
Damn straight!
ELMER ZINNEMAN
Shut up, Porter.
The men are all dressed in hunting clothes-
red-and-black-checked shirts, orange caps, etc. They all
have guns. Among their number are a few women as well,
looking tough and determined. We see almost everyone we've
met up to this point. LOWE is there, looking deeply
troubled.
ANDY FAIRTON is standing on the bar. These are his
vigilantes; he has organized them. ANDY radiates male macho
football-coach confidence. He's mesmerized the crowd: they
really believe they are going to go out and Shoot One for
the Gipper.
ANDY
Groups one through four are in the woods
north of the Sturmfuller place. Five and
six west of Carson Creek.
The door at the back opens; HALLER and PETE come in. JOE
HALLER is in extremely bad shape. He hasn't come back much
from the murder of BRADY. I believe he is having some sort
of spiritual crisis, and while it is not our purpose to
explore what it might be- this is, after all, a horror movie
and not a John Cassavetes film- we can see that it has
seriously weakened his authority.
ANDY (continuing)
Moonrise at 8:52 p.m.
Some nervous laughter greets this. Meanwhile, HALLER and
PETE are working their way to the front, where they end up
next to a grim-faced HERB KINCAID.
ANDY (continuing)
If he comes out to stroll in the moonlight
tonight, we're going to get the sorry sucker.
THE VIGILANTES, WITH ELMER AND PORTER
PORTER (happily)
Damn straight!
ELMER
Shut up, Porter.
ANDY FAIRTON
ANDY
Just remember, it's the psycho we want, not
each other. So look before you-
THE CROWD, FEATURING HALLER
HALLER
I want all of you folks to go home!
A disgruntled murmur meets this. HALLER moves forward a bit,
and turns to face them.
HALLER
I can't remember deputizing a single one
of you!
ANDY FAIRTON
ANDY
That's right, Joe- the only deputy you got is
that fat shitbag beside you, and neither one
of you has done a damn thing about solving
this case.
There is a mutter of agreement.
A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT, FEATURING ANDY AND HALLER
ANDY hops off the bar to face HALLER directly. In the b.g.
we see HERB KINCAID (KINCAID, by the way, should be wearing
a black armband- he's come directly from his son's funeral).
HALLER (without much force)
We'll catch him.
ANDY
You couldn't catch a cold.
HALLER looks at him for a moment, then turns to look at the
crowd. They look rather like a lynch mob; on their faces we
see an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination. HALLER
speaks with a kind of haggard, fading desperation.
HALLER
The law has a name for what you men are
planning. It's private justice, and private
justice is about a step and a half away
from lynch mobs and hang ropes. I'm no
J. Edgar Hoover, but I am the law in Tarker's
Mills, and I want you men to go home.
They shuffle their feet uneasily; many look down. He is
getting to them.
ANDY
Don't let this guy scare you! What's he done
since this thing started but hang his face out?
It's not working. Many of the men look disgusted with both
ANDY and themselves.
ANDY (louder)
He ain't got so much as a fingerprint!
OWEN KNOPFLER
Ah, shut up, Andy.
ANDY
Don't tell me to-
HERB KINCAID steps forward.
HERB
Yes. Correct. Shut up.
ANDY, surprised and bewildered, does. HERB turns and looks
grimly at JOE HALLER, who can barely meet his gaze.
HERB (quietly)
I just came from my boy's funeral.
HALLER
Herb...I know how upset- how grief-stricken
you must be...but-
HERB (quietly)
He was torn apart.
Utter silence in OWEN'S place now. The others are staring,
rapt.
HALLER
Yes. Yes, but-
HERB (still quiet)
Upset, you say. Grief-stricken, you say.
Constable, you don't know what those words
mean. My son was torn to pieces. To pieces!
HERB turns to the others in the pub. Tears stream down his
face.
HERB
My son was torn to pieces!
(turning back to HALLER)
You come in here and talk to these men
about private justice. You dare to do that.
Constable Haller, why don't you go out to
Harmony Hill and dig up what's left of Brady
and explain to him about private justice.
Would you want to do that?
HALLER makes no reply. He looks down at his feet.
HERB
No. I thought not.
(to the others)
You folks stay here if you want. I wouldn't
ask anyone to do anything that runs counter
to his conscience. As for me... I'm going out
and hunt up a little private justice.
ANDY FAIRTON has swelled up again. He grins poisonously at
the slumped HALLER. He pushes off after HERB KINCAID. Other
men start to follow.
OWEN'S PUB
LESTER LOWE, looking more distressed than ever, pushes his
way through the men toward the door, and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS.
He grabs BILLY McCLAREN.
LOWE
Billy... Billy, this is a bad idea. Joe can...
BILLY (not looking at LOWE)
Joe's had his chance, Father. Leave me be.
He pushes outside. LOWE looks around wildly; his face says
he can't believe this is happening. He grabs PORTER
ZINNEMAN, then, as PORTER shoves by him, at a couple of
others with mounting desperation.
HALLER makes his way to LOWE through the thinning crowd and
draws him aside.
HALLER
Let them go.
LOWE
But-
HALLER
This is that spirit of community you were
talking about. Grand, ain't it? Maybe they'll
shoot a hitchhiker or something and Andy can
mount the head and raffle it off. To benefit
the Medcu van, of course.
HALLER laughs.
LOWE
But can't we do anything?
OWEN KNOPFLER hurries past them; he has a rifle over one
shoulder in a sling. In his left hand he carries the
peacemaker bat.
HALLER
Sure. We can pray to Christ that none of them
get killed.
HOLY FAMILY CATHOLIC CHURCH, PULPIT POV
MORNING
It's an almost exact reprise of #167. Most of the mourners
are crying; MRS. BOWIE playing the organ; MARTY'S chair
parked at the back. We can see UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, and
MRS. STURMFULLER, exactly as they were at BRADY KINCAID'S
funeral; in fact, this seems to be an instant reply of that
event. One difference: we can't see BRADY'S coffin. It's
below us. The hymn ends.
FATHER LOWE, IN THE PULPIT
LOWE
Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there
be no mass said here this afternoon. They
did ask me to say a word of comfort to you
if I could.
THE CONGREGATION, FEATURING HERB KINCAID
He sits in the first pew. In his grief he looks dead.
HERB
There is no comfort, Father. Only private
justice.
LOWE, AT THE PULPIT
He's thrown off his stride. Beginning to sweat. He's like an
actor trying to remember his lines.
LOWE
Uh, if there's any word of comfort I can
give you, it's just this: the face of the
beast always becomes known; the time-
He looks down. His eyes widen in fear.
THE COFFINS, LOWE'S POV
Yes, that's coffins- plural. Where BRADY'S coffin was
formerly, there are now six coffins, smothered with flowers.
LOWE, IN THE PULPIT
He is badly scared now; sweat is dripping off him.
LOWE
The time... the time of the beast always
passes. There are answers... ways... ways
to... to cope... if we turn to each other...
HERB (bestial voice)
Father-
LOWE looks toward:
FIRST ROW PEW, WITH HERB KINCAID, LOWE'S POV
He's looking down at something in his hands. Now he looks up
and we see his face has become bestial. His eyes are green.
As we look at him, the transformation cotinues. He's turning
into a werewolf.
HERB (snarling)
It tore out his heart.
And sure enough, HERB KINCAID holds BRADY'S dripping heart
up in what were hands but which are now rapidly becoming
paws.
LESTER LOWE, AT THE PULPIT
He staggers back, in terror.
LOWE (shrieks)
No!
THE CONGREGATION, LOWE'S POV
MRS. BOWIE begins bringing in a few more sheaves on the
church organ, and the congregation begins to sing.
CONGREGATION
Sowing in the morning/sowing seeds of
kindness/sowing in the noontide/and the
dewy eve...
We pan their faces, stopping on JOE HALLER. Now something is
happening to JOE'S face. It is bulging, changing. He looks
up from his hymnal and his eyes glare green. The pupils are
split. He grins, showing big teeth.
They are all changing. Among the things we see are:
PETE SYLVESTER, who is a church deacon, rushing down the
aisle, changing, snarling. He grabs ANDY FAIRTON and the two
of them grapple in the aisle.
A YOUNG WOMAN with a baby in her arms turns back the blanket
covering the baby's face and we see it's a wolfling; already
the YOUNG WOMAN'S own hands are turning into claws.
TAMMY STURMFULLER changing; PELTZER the druggist changing;
the ZINNEMAN BROTHERS changing.
At the organ, MRS. BOWIE is now a werewolf clad in tatters
of a silk bombazine dress; she/it is still wearing a veiled
hat on her head, and she is beating the shit out of the
organ keys with her clawed hands. She sounds like Jerry Lee
Lewis after swallowing about a dozen bennies. And now the
tune changes from the remnants of "Bringing In The Sheaves."
It changes into the Rheingold jingle.
CONGREGATION (snarling chorus)
My beer is Rheingold the dry beer...
Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer...
LOWE
FATHER LOWE goes stumbling backward, dropping his hymnal.
The man is in an extremity of terror.
REV. LOWE
No! No! No!
THE CONGREGATION, LOWE'S POV
Some are tearing their hymnals apart and throwing them at
each other. One guy- BILLY McCLAREN, maybe- wings one of
them through a stained-glass window. Some of the werewolves-
for they are all werewolves now- fight or make love in the
aisles. The rest sway back and forth, grinning ferociously,
singing.
CONGREGATION (snarling it out)
It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real
frosty treat...
LOWE
He looks toward:
THE MRS. BOWIE WEREWOLF, AT THE ORGAN
She grins ferociously up at him, playing the Rheingold
jingle on the pipe organ with her claws. Now blood begins to
bubble up between the keys.
MRS. STURMFULLER AND ALL
Won't you try, won't you buy...
THE ENTIRE CONGREGATION
The church is a wild shambles of lurching, fighting, singing
werewolves. It's like a New Year's Eve party in hell.
CONGREGATION (big finish)
...Rheiinngold beer!
Suddenly a clawed hand burts up through one of the coffins.
And ANDY FAIRTON, who now looks as wolflike as any of them,
bites the hand's claw off.
REV. LOWE, ON THE PODIUM
He's seen all he can stand. He whirls for the back, where
there is a small door. He pulls it open... and a BRADY
KINCAID werewolf, half torn apart but still somehow alive (a
zombie werewolf, if you can dig it- George Romero would like
it, I think) leaps out and seizes LOWE.
BRADY buries his muzzle in LOWE'S NECK.
LESTER LOWE, ECU
He sits up into THE CAMERA and SCREAMS. Sweat is running
down his face. He stares at us for a moment, his eyes buggy
and crazed... and then he closes them. There is an
expression of huge relief on his face as he does so.
LOWE (praying)
Let it end, dear Lord. Let it end. Please
let it end.
THE COSLAW FAMILY STATION WAGON
DAY
It's parked across the road from the sign.
JANE (voice)
Look out, world! Marty the Great didn't
get something he wanted!
They are distributed just as they were when they arrived at
this same fairgrounds earlier. All of them have ice cream
cones; they are coming home from a family outing.
NAN COSLAW
Stop it, Jane.
JANE
Well, I don't see why everybody just about
breaks down and cries whenever he-
BOB
Stop it, your mother said.
They've just paused for a quick look at the sign; now BOB
pulls out onto the road again and heads toward home.
MARTY AND JANE IN THE BACKSEAT
JANE sticks her tongue out at him. MARTY looks away.
THE GARAGE
DAY
UNCLE AL and MARTY are working on the engine of the Silver
Bullet. UNCLE AL has a six-pack of beer that he's working
through. He and MARTY sit on the floor. As they talk, UNCLE
AL unscrews the last bolt holding the Bullet's carburetor
and pulls it off.
MARTY
It isn't enough that the monster killed all
those people- that he killed Brady. Now he's
got them to cancel the fair.
UNCLE AL
And the fireworks. Hand me that box, Marty.
MARTY hands him a medium-sized carton with the words "Speed
Shop" printed on it.
MARTY
Yeah, okay, the fireworks. Jane thinks that's
all I'm mad about, but it's not. Them doing
that is just a... a...
UNCLE AL
It's just an outward symbol of everything
that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not
bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in
college. I can jive that shit all day.
MARTY
Well... I like it that you always know how
to say things, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my
ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested
to hear that.
MARTY
Don't call me dear boy.
UNCLE AL
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
He gives MARTY a kiss and smiles at him. MARTY smiles back.
UNCLE AL
Look at this.
He pulls out a brand-new carburetor- it's a chrome-plated
four-barrel.
UNCLE AL (gleeful)
This is gonna turn your wheelchair into
a fucking F-14, Marty-
He looks around quickly, guiltily.
UNCLE AL
Your mom's not around, is she?
MARTY
She and dad are out back lighting the
barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's
King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
UNCLE AL
Uh-huh. Only in her case I guess it would be
Queen Shit of Turd Mountain. Hand me that
adjustable.
MARTY does. UNCLE AL slides the carb onto the gasket and
starts attaching bolts.
UNCLE AL
The guy killed your best friend, drove your
girl out of town, and stole the second-best
holiday in the year. Have I got it right?
MARTY (glum)
You got it right, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL
Yeah, Winesburg, Ohio, was never like that...
but I got something that just might cheer
you up.
MARTY
What?
UNCLE AL
Wait, dear boy. Just wait. Hand me those pliars.
MARTY'S BEDROOM
His bed is by the window. His hands appear on the
windowsill, and MARTY pulls himself in. He falls over onto
his bed and lies there, spent and exhausted and trembling.
THE COSLAW LIVING ROOM, WITH MARTY
He's sitting in the "house" wheelchair in the living room,
holding the phone tensely to his ear as the RINGING SOUND
goes on.
A CLICK as the phone is picked up.
UNCLE AL (muzzy voice)
'Lo? Go away.
MARTY
It's a werewolf! I saw it! Last night-
UNCLE AL'S BEDROOM
Not a really spiffy place- the decor is Early American
Alcoholic. There's a mostly unclad lady asleep on one side
of the bed. UNCLE AL is sitting on the other in his
skivvies, phone to his ear. There are a lot of bottles and
heaped ashtrays around, and UNCLE AL has a big old hangover.
UNCLE AL
You dreamed it, Marty.
MARTY (voice)
No! I went out late last night- and-
UNCLE AL
There are no such things as werewolves.
Please, dear boy, have some pity.
He hangs up and falls back into bed.
GIRL (muzzy voice)
Whowuzzit?
UNCLE AL
Obscene phone caller. Go back to sleep.
LON THAYER, ECU
What we see mostly are his brown eyes.
MR. THAYER
Hello, Jane.
JANE, ECU
Wide eyes, mostly.
BOBBY ROBERTSON, ECU
Mostly eyes.
ROBERTSON'S, FEATURING JANE
As she turns away, her eyes sweep the men at the counter.
THE MEN, JANE'S POV
Some of them- PELTZER, VIRGIL CUTTS- are familiar. Others
are not. THE CAMERA PANS THEIR FACES CLOSELY, FEATURING
THEIR EYES.
THE BARBER SHOP
DAY
As JANE enters, BILLY McCLAREN is giving one man a trim.
Another man is tipped back with his face wrapped in a towel.
Two or three other townies are waiting on tonsorial
beautification, reading magazines. None, of course, has only
one eye. JANE checks them all out carefully.
BILLY
I know what you're after, Jane, and you're
out of luck. Little Toby Whittislaw was in
yesterday, and I gave 'em all to him.
JANE
Oh... okay.
But her eyes have fixed on the towel over the face of the
man in the other barber chair. She walks over to him.
JANE AND THE TOWELED MAN, CLOSER ON
JANE
That you, Mr. Fairton?
ANDY FAIRTON (muffled)
No- it's Ronald McDonald. I came in for
a shave and a burger.
The men laugh. JANE smiles politely. And pulls the hot towel
away from his eyes. His two eyes.
JANE (sweetly)
Got any bottles, Mr. Fairton?
ANDY
No!
JANE (just as sweet)
Oh... okay.
She puts the towel back and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as she
returns to the door.
JANE
'Bye, Mr. McClaren.
BILLY (amused)
'Bye, Jane.
ANDY (muffled)
Jesus!
JANE goes out.
THE RECTORY HALLWAY, JANE'S POV
Dark and empty. SOUNDS in the kitchen. EATING SOUNDS, maybe-
or maybe we can't tell.
THE KITCHEN
LOWE is standing by the refrigerator door. He's holding a
raw leg of lamb and tearing at it with his teeth. Lamb blood
smears his face and runs down his arms. He is as human as
you or me (in a manner of speaking, as UNCLE AL would say),
but when JANE speaks, his head snaps up and his eye flares-
his one eye. The other is covered by a patch.
JANE (voice)
Father?
LOWE
Take your cart around to the garage
and unload, Jane! Then bring me your
tally sheet!
THE KITCHEN, WITH LOWE
He crosses to the window over the kitchen sink, the bloody
chunk of meat still in his hands, and looks out.
THE KITCHEN, WITH LOWE
Still watching JANE, he begins to gnaw ravenously at the
meat again.
THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE, WITH JANE
This is a creepy little place, now filled with bottles and
cans that have been crammed in helter-skelter, every which
way. JANE obviously doesn't like it. She begins to unload
her cart rapidly, mumbling numbers to herself.
SOUND: SQUEAKING.
JANE looks down.
THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE FLOOR, JANE'S POV
A good-sized mouse comes out from between a pile of stacked
bottles and runs across JANE'S shoe.
JANE
She utters a litle scream and shrinks back against the wall,
bumping it quite hard. Hard enough to knock something off an
overhead shelf. It falls into the bottles, SHATTERING
several. JANE screams again- not terribly loud- and then
slowly bends toward the object and picks it up.
JANE holds it, both puzzled and scared.
JANE, IN THE RECTORY KITCHEN
She looks around. No one here. But there is a bloody spot on
the counter- LOWE must have set his grisly luncheon down
here for a moment. She walks slowly across the kitchen and
into the dark hall.
JANE
Father Lowe?... I've got my tally sheet...
Farther into the hall. A hand drops onto her shoulder.
LOWE (voice)
Very good, Jane!
She jumps, and so do we. She turns around and looks up at:
FATHER LOWE, ECU
Featuring his eyes- his eye, rather. The left is covered
with a black eye-patch.
LOWE (grins)
Good, Jane. Very... very good.
He holds his hand out, and JANE puts the tally sheet in it
like one in a dream. She can't take her eyes off that black
patch, which tells her everything.
THE HALLWAY, WITH JANE AND LOWE
LOWE (concerned)
Jane! You're trembling!
JANE
I... I don't feel so well, I guess
maybe I got too much sun.
LOWE
Would you like to come in the parlor and
lie down for a bit? Or have a cold drink?
I have some soda-
JANE
No! (softer) That is, I have to get home
and help my mom with lunch.
LOWE
I'll give you a ride!
JANE is retreating down the hall toward the front door.
JANE
No- she... she was going to meet me at the
market. I'll be fine.
LOWE, CU
How much does he know? How much has he guessed? Hard to tell
from his face, which now seems sinister, with its eye-patch.
LOWE
Give my best to your brother, Jane.
JANE, AT THE PORCH END OF THE HALLWAY
JANE
I will.
She bolts.
LOWE, IN THE HALLWAY
CAMERA HOLDS ON HIM, standing silent and enigmatic.
LOWE (soft)
Real slow.
A SHEET OF RULED SCHOOL NOTEBOOK PAPER, CU
A hand- MARTY'S- comes into the frame and prints: I KNOW WHO
YOU ARE, AND I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.
MARTY'S ROOM, WITH MARTY
He's sitting at his desk, a pool of light from the lamp
focused on the sheet of paper before him. He thinks a
moment, then begins to write again.
THE NOTEBOOK PAD, CU
He is adding: WHY DON'T YOU KILL YOURSELF?
MARTY, AT HIS DESK
He studies this for a second, and seems satisfied. He opens
a drawer, brings out an envelope, and folds his letter into
it.
THE RECTORY LIVING ROOM, WITH LESTER LOWE
He's standing at the window and looking out. The torn-open
envelope is on an end table beside him. He's holding the
lined sheet of paper in his hand. An expression of bitter
hate twists his features, and he slowly crumples the paper
in his fist.
LOWE, BEHIND THE COUPE'S WHEEL
He leans over the wheel, grinning sadistically.
LOWE (whispers)
Bastard.
LOWE, BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE COUPE
LOWE
Oh, you bastard!
He floors the engine.
LOWE, IN THE COUPE
He's in a teeth-grinding fury. He jams the gear-shift lever
into reverse and floors the gas pedal again.
LOWE, BEHIND THE WHEEL
His face is so full of frustrated hate that it has become
the face of a gargoyle.
THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH THE BULLET
It's dim and spooky in here. Cracks between the boards of
the side walls allow dusty fingers of daylight to shine
through. More light rays up from the cracks in the floor.
The floorboards are warped and uneven; MARTY'S wheelchair
sways drunkenly from side to side. The total inside passage
is about seventy feet.
About halfway across, the Silver Bullet coughs its last
cough and splutters its last splutter. It rolls along
silently, going on its dying momentum.
LOWE'S SHOES
Sensible black Oxfords.
LOWE
I'm very sorry about this. I don't know if
you believe that or not, but it's true. I
would never willingly hurt a child. You
should have left me alone, Marty.
SOUND of footfalls resumes.
LOWE, IN THE SHADOWS
LOWE (soft; soothing)
I can't kill myself, Marty. You see, our
religion teaches that suicide is the
greatest sin a man or a woman can commit.
Stella Randolph was going to commit suicide;
if she had done so, she would be burning in
hell right now. By killing her I took her
physical life but saved her life eternal.
You see, Marty? You see how all things serve
the will and the mind of God? You see, you
meddling little shit!
He begins to walk forward again.
THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH LOWE
He draws back a little, and his face is sharp with animal
cunning- inside his head he's running a four-minute mile.
Stay and try to bluff it out, or beat it?
THE COVERED BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV
Empty.
THE COVERED BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV
Brooding, shadowy. CAMERA HOLDS AND WE
DISSOLVE TO:
THE CONSTABLE'S OFFICE, WITH HALLER AND UNCLE AL
HALLER is behind his desk, rocked back in his chair, hands
laced together behind his head. He's looking at UNCLE AL.
There's a silence that draws out for quite some time. In it,
UNCLE AL becomes steadily more uncomfortable.
HALLER
That's just about the craziest damn story
I've ever heard, Al.
UNCLE AL
I know. I could have edited out all of the
completely crazy stuff, but I thought you
deserved to hear it with the bark on.
HALLER
I appreciate that. Now, the next question:
Do you believe any of this? You do, don't you?
UNCLE AL
Let's just say I believe Lester Lowe should
be checked out.
HALLER rises.
HALLER
That can be arranged.
They shake hands.
THE RECTORY HALL AND SITTING ROOM, HALLER'S POV
No one there.
THE GARAGE, HALLER'S POV
LOWE'S coupe is in there. There's just room for it amid the
shadowy piles of bottles and cans.
THE GARAGE, WITH HALLER
He goes around to the front of LOWE'S coupe and squats down.
In the b.g.: a heaped mountain of aluminum beer and soda
cans.
HALLER feels in his breast pocket and brings out a Zippo. He
lights it and looks at:
THE COUPE, CU
One of the turn-signal lamps is broken. There's a scratch in
the paint and a dent in the bumper. HALLER'S fingers come
into the frame and touch the scratch. They stop, and THE
CAMERA ZOOMS IN to a small streak of silvery paint. As MARTY
has a scrape of blue car paint on his wheelchair, so does
LOWE have a scrape of silver wheelchair paint on his car.
HALLER
His eyes widen.
SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR and the CLINK AND TUMBLE of about
nine thousand cans as LOWE erupts from under the aluminum
scrap heap behind HALLER. He is a mixture of man and
werewolf, and quite clearly a beastial version of LOWE. In
one hand he holds the remains of OWEN KNOPFLER'S peacemaker.
HALLER starts to turn; LOWE strikes him with the bat. CAMERA
CLOSES IN ON LOWE as the bat rises and falls... rises and
falls. We can't see HALLER, and that is probably a mercy,
but we can hear the THUD of the bat as it strikes again and
again and again.
THE CAR, WITH MARTY, JANE, AND UNCLE AL
MARTY
Please, Uncle Al.
JANE
Will you?
The St. Cristopher's medal and the crucifix are hanging from
the rearview on a fine silver chain. UNCLE AL takes down the
medal and looks at it.
UNCLE AL
All right. I give up. Yes.
MARTY							JANE
All right! Thanks!				Thank you, Uncle Al!
UNCLE AL
If either of you ever tells anyone I even
bought a piece of this story, werewolves
will be the least of your problems.
SILVER BULLET MONTAGE
a.) UNCLE AL pulls up to a city store front with a sign
reading MAC'S GUNS AND AMMO. He takes out the St.
Cristopher's medal, looks at it, and shakes his head, as if
still ruing his own credulity and stupidity. He goes inside.
JANE (voice-over)
Uncle Al's friend Mac was more than a
gunsmith; he was, Uncle Al said, an
old-world craftsman, a sort of wizard
of weapons.
b.) In the gun shop interior, we see UNCLE AL talking to
MAC, who really should look like an elderly white wizard- a
kind of Gandalf figure. In the b.g. window we see a paper
skeleton and paper jack-o'-lanterns: our first clue that All
Hallow's Eve is nearing. UNCLE AL is speaking animatedly,
using his hands a lot; we don't know exactly what the tale
is, but it must be a whopper. In the course of it, he hands
the medal and the crucifix to MAC, who tents the silver
chains over his fingers and looks at them.
JANE (v-o continues)
God knows what sort of story my uncle
told him, but I think that for men who
have been married as often as Uncle Al,
invention on short notice becomes
something of a specialty.
c.) In his workroom, we see MAC spilling boron over the
medal and looking closely at the stain.
JANE (v-o continues)
The gunsmith confirmed the high-grade
silver content of my crucifix and Marty's
medallion...
d.) In a dim shot which makes MAC look more like a sorcerer
than ever, we see him light an acetylene torch and begin
melting the medal and the crucifix in the crucible. THE
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN as JANE'S contribution and MARTY'S
melt together; they are becoming on and indissoluble.
JANE (v-o continues)
...melted them down...
e.) We see MAC pouring molten silver into a bullet mold.
JANE (v-o concludes)
...and molded them into a silver bullet.
MAC'S GUN SHOP, WITH MAC AND UNCLE AL
DAY
MAC comes out of the back with a small inlaid wooden box. He
puts it down on the glass counter top.
MAC
Here it is.
THE BOX, CU
MAC'S hands open it, disclosing a single bullet resting on
dark velvet plush. It is a .22 short round, and it gleams a
pure silver. It would be great to hype this bullet
optically- not much, just a little- to make it look
absolutely magical. Almost holy.
MAC AND UNCLE AL
UNCLE AL picks up the bullet almost reverently, holds it to
the light.
MAC
Nicest piece of work I ever did, I think.
It's got a low-grain load so it won't
tumble. Should be pretty accurate.
UNCLE AL
It's just a gag, that's all. What would
you shoot a silver .22 bullet at, anyway?
MAC (joking)
How about a werewolf? (Pause) Happy
Halloween, Al.
THE STATION WAGON, WITH BOB AND NAN
BOB
I can't believe that you'd agree to leave
the kids with him. A year ago I would have
laughed at the idea. You used to almost
breathe fire when Al came in the house.
NAN
He's changed. Just this summer. Or
something's changed him. Marty, maybe.
And the drinking- I think it's almost
stopped. Whatever it is, it's wonderful.
And they'll be safe with him. I'm sure
of it.
BOB
I know they'll be safe with him... but will
he get them both into bed by nine-thirty?
NAN (firmly)
If I told him to, he will.
THE WALL CLOCK IN THE COSLAW LIVING ROOM
NIGHT
It reads 1:00.
SOUND: The National Anthem.
THE TV, CU
The anthem finishes up. We go to a station ID card.
ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
This concludes WDML's broadcast day.
The TV goes to snow.
JANE ON THE COUCH
She's mostly asleep in one corner.
MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET
He's also dozing.
UNCLE AL, IN BOB'S EASY CHAIR IN FRONT OF THE TV
He is also dozing. There are three or four empty beer cans
in front of him, and a cigarette with a long ash is
smoldering between his fingers. There's a .22 pistol in his
lap.
THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MARTY, JANE, AND UNCLE AL
UNCLE AL jumps up and cries out as the cigarette burns up to
his fingers. The .22 falls onto the rug.
MARTY and JANE also wake up, startled.
THE LIVING ROOM, WITH AL, JANE, MARTY
UNCLE AL is shaking his burned hand; he picks the cigarette
out of his lap and puts it out.
JANE (sleepy)
You'll burn yourself up sometime doing
that, Uncle Al.
UNCLE AL
I suppose so. You kids ought to go up to bed.
MARTY
But Uncle Al! You said-
UNCLE AL
I know what I said, Marty- but it's ten
past one. He's not coming.
JANE
The moon's not down yet...
UNCLE AL
Damn near. Now I'll sit up with this
stupid gun in my lap because I promised,
but you two are going to bed. Go on,
now, scoot.
JANE gets up and starts toward the stairs.
MARTY
What if I say no?
UNCLE AL
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.
(more kindly) Go on, now.
MARTY begins to roll the Silver Bullet toward the stairs,
where the stair chair awaits. JANE is waiting for him at the
living-room doorway. MARTY sees the gun on the floor and
stops.
MARTY
If that'd gone off, it would have been the
end of our silver bullet.
UNCLE AL
He prickles a bit at the unstated criticism. He bends down
and picks up the pistol. He opens the cylinder. Five
chambers are empty; in one there's a bright silver circle.
UNCLE AL
He pushes the cylinder plunger, dropping the silver bullet
into his hand.
UNCLE AL
See, dear boy? Totally unimpaired.
Behind him, the WEREWOLF'S head appears in the window, its
green eye flaring.
BY THE LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH MARTY AND JANE
MARTY, looking toward UNCLE AL, sees nothing. JANE is
looking toward the window and she SCREAMS.
JANE (shrieking)
It's him! It's the werewolf! I see him!
IT'S THE WEREWOLF!
She's pointing at the window.
UNCLE AL
He jumps up and looks around at the window- at this point AL
has the .22 with its cylinder open in one hand and the
silver bullet loosely held in the other.
Nothing in the window but darkness. UNCLE AL turns back to
the kids.
UNCLE AL (sharply)
You see it, Marty!
MARTY
MARTY (shakes his head)
I was looking at you...
UNCLE AL
His shoulders slump a little with relief- now that the scare
is over, his relief is tempered with irritation. They're
just a couple of hysterical kids after all, and JANE is
actually worse than MARTY. Polly Practical indeed!
UNCLE AL
A very familiar feeling is beginning to
creep over me.
MARTY AND JANE, BY THE DOORWAY
JANE is crying.
MARTY
What's that, Uncle Al?
UNCLE AL
UNCLE AL
I feel like a horse's ass.
MARTY AND JANE, BY THE DOORWAY
JANE (weeping)
I saw it, Uncle Al! I did!
MARTY rolls a little closer to her and attempts to put a
comforting arm around her shoulder.
JANE
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
MARTY
Jane-
UNCLE AL
UNCLE AL
Would you kids go to bed? My head's
starting to ache.
THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE
The lights go out.
JANE SHRIEKS.
MARTY
It's here! It's outside!
UNCLE AL
UNCLE AL
Jane, it's just a power fai-
He's starting toward her. At that moment most of the wall-
not just the window it was looking through before but the
whole wall- crashes inward as the WEREWOLF bulls its way
through, roaring.
UNCLE AL whirls, raising the pistol automatically to fire-
but the cylinder is rolled out and all the chambers are
empty. He has time to register surprise before the WEREWOLF
smashes him aside.
UNCLE AL, A NEW ANGLE
He goes flying backward. The pistol goes one way, the silver
bullet another.
THE GUN
It spins into a living-room corner.
THE SILVER BULLET, SLOW MOTION
We see it rise in the air, turning over and over. It comes
down, hits the floor, and rolls.
THE HALLWAY FLOOR, WITH THE BULLET, SLOW MOTION
In the extreme f.g. is a heating vent. The bullet is rolling
toward it.
MARTY AND JANE
MARTY
Get the gun!
He uses his hands to propel the ungainly Silver Bullet into
the hall.
THE BULLET (THE REAL BULLET) AND MARTY, SLOW MOTION
The silver bullet rolls slowly toward the heating vent. In
the b.g. we see a frantic MARTY in his wheelchair.
He heaves himself out of it and falls full-length, grabbing.
His fingers touch the bullet, but that's all. It falls in
the heating vent.
THE WEREWOLF, CU
It's roaring, furious, its one eye flaring.
THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE
UNCLE AL lies senseless against one wall, the front of his
shirt bloody. JANE runs into the corner and grabs the
pistol.
The WEREWOLF picks up the easy chair and throws it through
the hole it made coming in. It picks up an end table and
hurls it through the TV. Then it sees JANE and starts toward
her.
JANE, COWERING IN THE CORNER
THE WEREWOLF, CU
Comes toward her.
JANE IN THE CORNER
She makes as if to run one way.
JANE AND THE WEREWOLF
It's only a couple of feet from her now, but again, it is
toying with her- it's making this reeeal slow.
THE FIREPLACE TOOLS, CU
A bloodstained hand grabs a poker.
THE WEREWOLF AND JANE
As it tenses down to leap at her, UNCLE AL leaps at it and
strikes it across the back. It turns, ROARING.
UNCLE AL hits it between the legs.
It BELLOWS and grabs the poker. It bends it and tosses it
aside. The glaring, savage expression on its face says that
now it will bend UNCLE AL and toss him aside.
JANE
She breaks out of the corner and runs across the room toward
the door. Most of the way there she trips and falls.
THE WEREWOLF, CU
Its head whips around.
MARTY, IN THE HALL
He's lying full-length. He's got the heater vent's grille
off. One arm is down inside.
MARTY (scream)
Janey! The gun! THE GUN!
JANE
She tosses it awkwardly.
THE GUN, SLOW MOTION
It slides down the hall floor to MARTY like some strange,
awkward shuffleboard disc, its cylinder still open.
THE WEREWOLF
WEREWOLF (snarls)
Maa-aaa-rty...
It begins walking slowly across the living room, smashing
things out of its way.
MARTY, IN THE HALL
The gun slides into his hand. Now he reaches into the
heating duct again...
IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU
There's an elbow bend just below MARTY'S twisting, grasping
fingers- the silver bullet lies here. It's less than half an
inch out of reach.
THE WEREWOLF, CU
WEREWOLF (foaming)
Maaa-aaa-rty...
JANE, ON THE FLOOR
JANE (sobbing)
Don't you hurt him! Don't you hurt my brother!
She bites one of the WEREWOLF'S hairy ankles as it passes.
JANE AND THE WEREWOLF
It roars with pain and kicks her aside. Then it looks back
into the hall. It is grinning. I believe it is thinking this
is going to be better than a Thanksgiving dinner you don't
have to pay for.
WEREWOLF
Reeeal slow, Maa-aaarty-
MARTY, CU
He's reaching desperately into the duct and staring at the
approaching WEREWOLF.
IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU
MARTY'S fingers brush the bullet once... again... seize it.
MARTY, IN THE HALL
He rolls over on his back and sticks the silver bullet
blindly into one chamber of the cylinder and slams the
cylinder closed.
THE WEREWOLF, CU
WEREWOLF
Bastard Marty!
MARTY
He points the gun and pulls the trigger. There's only a
click. An expression of dismay on his face.
THE WEREWOLF, CU
WEREWOLF
Kill you...
MARTY
He drags himself so he's half propped against the hall wall.
He pulls the trigger again. Click! Dismay becomes fear.
THE WEREWOLF
It's reached the Silver Bullet. It smashes it aside. The
Bullet hits the wall.
MARTY
Holding the gun in both hands now, he pulls the trigger a
third time. Click!
The WEREWOLF'S shadow falls over him.
WEREWOLF, ECU
WEREWOLF
Bastard Marty!
It bends down, reaching.
MARTY, ECU
Craning back as if to drive himself into the wall, he pulls
the trigger again.
THE BARREL OF THE .22 MAXI-CLOSE
The bullet flies from the barrel, gleaming silver.
THE WEREWOLF
The silver bullet strikes him in his one remaining eye. He
flies backward, hands clapped to his gushing face... and
crashes into MARTY'S Silver Bullet wheelchair. It sits
there, roaring... and then it begins to change.
THE LIVING ROOM, WITH JANE
She lies there, sobbing.
UNCLE AL (voice)
You okay, Janey?
UNCLE AL AND JANE
UNCLE AL is bloody and staggering but on his feet. He helps
JANE up.
JANE
I'm all right... but Marty! Ma-
SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR.
THE WEREWOLF, ECU
Its hands drop from its face. It is now blind in both eyes;
it is half WEREWOLF and half LOWE.
It BELLOWS again, convulses... and dies.
MARTY, ON THE FLOOR
MARTY (calls)
I'm all right. He's dead.
UNCLE AL AND JANE
Here's a creature that is mostly FATHER LOWE collapsed in
the remains of MARTY'S wheelchair; beyond it, MARTY is lying
on the floor. UNCLE AL goes by the corpse. JANE starts by...
and LOWE sits bolt upright for a moment, grasping blindly at
her.
She shrieks and darts aside. LOWE falls back, now really
dead. I think. Until the sequel.
THE HALL, WITH UNCLE AL, JANE, AND MARTY
UNCLE AL puts a comforting arm around JANE, who is sobbing
again- hell, I'd be sobbing after that last one, myself- and
draws her down beside himself and MARTY.
UNCLE AL (to MARTY)
There. I told you there weren't any such
things as werewolves.
They smile at each other with love.
JANE (nervous)
Are you sure it's dead? Or him? Or
whatever it is?
UNCLE AL
If it isn't now, it will be after I pound
one of your mother's silver candlesticks
through its heart.
JANE (grimaces)
Oh Uncle Al, no!
UNCLE AL (grim)
Oh yes, Janey. When I believe something, I
believe it all the way.
He gets up and leaves.
JANE
Are you all right, Marty?
MARTY
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
JANE
You're a real booger, you know it?
MARTY (smiles)
I love you, Jane.
THE HALLWAY, WITH MARTY AND JANE
JANE (hugging him)
I love you, Marty.
