      A Washington DC bar.  Upscale.  Young and intense in that
      way that means everyone is holding a martini and scanning
      the room for people more important than they are.  It's not
      drinks, it's a competition.  And the winner is HARRISON (late
      20s).  At least, he ACTS like the winner.  Right now, he's
    at a table, drink in hand.  QUINN (20s) comes in.  Quinn
      hates the fact that people assume that because she is pretty,
      she is not smart.  Because she is.  Smart.

                                      QUINN
                    Harrison Jones?

                    Quinn Rielly.

                                      QUINN
                    I can't stay.

                                      HARRISON
                    What are you drinking?

                                      QUINN
                    I can't stay.  I'm sorry.  I only
                    came because Lori said she didn't
                    have your number and couldn't cancel
                    and I didn't want you to be waiting
                    here because getting stood up in
                    this particular bar is like falling
                    face down on a runway and even though
                    I don't know you, Lori's got this
                    annoying habit of meddling and it
                    seemed only decent to-

                                      HARRISON
                    What are you drinking?

                                      QUINN
                    I can't stay, is what I am saying. 
                    I don't do blind dates.

                                      HARRISON
                    My parents met on a blind date. 
                    Been inseparable ever since.

                    I'm happy for your parents.  And for
                    you because it means you exist.  But
                    I-

                                      HARRISON
                    This isn't a blind date.

                                      QUINN
                    What?

                                      HARRISON
                    It's a job interview.  What are you
                    drinking?

      He's flagged down a waiter.  Quinn hesitates, then sits.  

                                      QUINN
                    Dirty martini. --  What do you mean
                    this is a job interview?

      Harrison waits until the waiter goes then turns back to Quinn.  

                                      HARRISON
                    This is a job interview.

                                      QUINN
                    You're a baby lawyer.  You're 12

                                      HARRISON
                    I'm 28 years old.

                                      QUINN
                    Why aren't we sitting in an office
                    in a law firm?

                                      HARRISON
                    Because that's not how we do job
                      interviews.

                                      QUINN
                    I didn't apply for a job with you.  

                                      HARRISON
                    You did.

                                      QUINN
                    I didn't.

                                      HARRISON
                    You did.

      Quinn stands.  She's no longer amused.

                                      QUINN
                    Okay, you know what?  This has
                      been...whatever, but I don't do blind
                    dates so-

                                      HARRISON
                    Ask me who I work for.

                                      QUINN
                    What?

                                      HARRISON
                    You really wanna ask me who I work
                    for.

                                      QUINN
                    Fine.  Who do you work for?

                                      HARRISON
                    Olivia Price.

      Quinn sits back down.  Stunned.

                                      QUINN
                    Olivia Price?  THE Olivia Price?
                          (glee to insanity to
                            despair)
                    Wait.  Shut up.  Wait.  
                          (don't fuck with me)
                    Is this some kind of ploy to make me
                    stay on this date?

      Harrison reels in his fish.

                                      HARRISON
                    Quinn, this is not a blind date.  On
                    blind dates, I like to buy a woman 
                    dinner because it makes her more
                    likely to either sleep with me or
                    give me a second date.  When I buy
                    you dinner, you'll know I'm
                      interested.  You did apply for a job
                    with me.  The way I know you applied
                    for a job with me is that I have
                    your resume on my iPad.  The way I
                    know you would kill puppies to get
                    this job is that you stopped breathing
                    when I said the name Olivia Price.

                    Which is a tell, your tell, and you
                    should look at that because I'm going
                    to offer you a crap salary and you'll
                    have to take it because you never
                    learned to breathe in and out without
                    stopping.  But don't feel bad about
                    it because we all get paid crap
                    salaries because we're the good guys. 
                    I'm a good guy which means I don't
                    generally lie but I did to you. 
                    This is not a job interview.

                                      QUINN
                    Wait.  I don't...I'm confused.

                                      HARRISON
                    Olivia already told me to hire you. 
                    The job is yours.  If you want it.
                    It's the best job you'll ever have. 
                    You will change lives, you will slay
                    dragons, you will love the hunt more
                    than you ever dreamed.  Because Olivia
                    Price is as amazing as they say. 
                    And I am not a baby lawyer, I am a
                    gladiator in a suit.  Because that's
                    what you are when you work for Olivia. 
                      A gladiator in a suit.  You wanna be
                      a gladiator in a suit?

      His enthusiasm is mesmerizing.  And true.  Quinn nods.

                                      HARRISON (CONT'D)
                    You gotta say it.

      And Quinn takes a deep breath...

                    I wanna be a gladiator in a suit.

      TITLE CARD.


      Where two men in expensive suits stand.  They look like
      businessmen.  Or stockbrokers.  Except for the fact that
      they are currently holding guns on one another.  Let's call
      them OSKAR (40s) and VLAD (50s).  They're Russian, nervous;
      there's a basket and an ENORMOUS pile of money wrapped in
      neat stacks on the table.  Even so, Olivia is calm, confident.

                    Is there some way I can expedite the
                    proceedings, gentlemen?

                                      OSKAR
                    I'm gonna kill him!  I swear to God,
                    I'll blow his brains on the carpet!

                                    VLAD
                    Not if I shoot you first!

                                      OLIVIA
                    No one is shooting anyone.  Put the
                    guns down.

                                    VLAD
                    He puts down his, I'll put down mine.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Oskar, that's your name?  Oskar, put
                    your gun down.

                                      OSKAR
                    So he can shoot me?  Hell no.

      Olivia looks Stephen.  Sighs.  Then she steps between the
      two men.  So that both guns are now pointed directly at her.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Okay?  Now the only person who gets
                    shot is me.  

                                      STEPHEN
                    Liv-

                                      OLIVIA

                          (to Oskar and Vlad)
                    Now, guns down.

      But neither man moves.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Okay.  What seems to be the problem?

                                      OSKAR
                    He's gonna blow me on the deal.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Vlad, are you gonna blow Oskar?

                                    VLAD
                    ...No...

                    Vlad?

                                    VLAD
                    I wanted us to go 50/50.  He wants
                    70/30.  I did all the work!

                                      OLIVIA
                    Oskar, will you consider 60/40 if
                    Vlad promises not to blow you?  

      Oskar thinks.  Then:

                                      OSKAR
                    I keep the car.

                                      OLIVIA
                    What car?  You know what, forget I
                    asked.  I don't need to know.  Vlad,
                    can Oskar keep the car?

                                    VLAD
                    I suppose that's okay.  Yes.

                                      OLIVIA
                    So no one blows anyone, we have a
                    60/40 split and Oskar keeps the car. 
                    Any other deal points either of you
                    would like to negotiate at this time?

                                      VLAD/OSKAR
                    No.  /I'm good.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Guns down.  GUNS DOWN.

      Reluctantly, Vlad and Oskar lower their guns. 

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Now shake hands.

      They look at her.  Is she fucking kidding them?

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    We have a verbal contract.  Shake
                    hands to seal the deal.  Do it.  Go
                    on.

      And reluctant, Oskar and Vlad step forward and shake hands.

                    again.

      And she and Stephen back out the door with the basket.


      The office is small but elegant.  A lot of steel and glass. 
    We can see the Washington Monument through the window. 
      Harrison and Quinn step off the elevator.

                                      QUINN
                    Do I look okay?

                                      HARRISON
                    Your skirt is too short.  Olivia
                    will talk about you.  Just take it
                    in.

                                      QUINN
                    Are you sure she's even here?  It's
                    after midnight.

                                      HARRISON
                    She's here.  She's always here.

      They round a corner and inside the glass walls of the
      conference room, Olivia, Stephen and ABBY (30s) are visible. 
      They're eating Chinese food, Olivia's sitting on the table,
      shoes kicked off, the basket beside her.  ABBY is round and
      warm and bubbly, the kind of woman who has cats and knits
      things.  But don't get too comfortable -- she'll stab you
      with her knitting needle if you fuck with her.

                                      HARRISON (CONT'D)
                    That's Stephen and that's Abby. 
                    He's a litigator, she's an
                      investigator.  And that's...

                                      QUINN
                    Olivia Price.
                          (awestruck)
                    She's taller on TV.

      Which makes no sense because Olivia is sitting down.  But
      Quinn's a little overwhelmed...

                                      QUINN (CONT'D)
                    Wait.  Why did she wanna hire me?  

                                      HARRISON
                    Business is growing, we needed another
                    smart set of hands.

                                      QUINN
                    No.  I mean, me?

                                      HARRISON
                    Come on.


      Olivia has one hand inside the basket.  We can't see why.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I'm not doing it.

                                    ABBY
                    Well, I'm not doing it either.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Whoa.  Don't look at me.

      Harrison and Quinn enter.  

                                      HARRISON
                    How'd it go?

                                      OLIVIA
                    We gave them three million, they
                    gave us the package.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Two guns to her head, the woman
                    doesn't flinch.

                                    ABBY
                    We're just waiting for pick up.

                                      HARRISON
                    Nice.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Your skirt is too short.

      She's looking at Quinn.

                                      QUINN
                    I'm sorry...um...ma'am...I didn't
                    know I was coming here...

                                      OLIVIA
                    She took the job?

                                      HARRISON
                    She took the job.

                                      QUINN
                    Ms.  Price, can I just say, I'm a
                    huge fan, I so admire your work in
                    the White House, it's an honor to
                    work for your law firm.

      She's nervous, gushing.

                                      OLIVIA
                    We're not a law firm.  We're lawyers
                    but this is not a law firm.  

                                      STEPHEN
                    Law firms are for pansies.

                                      OLIVIA
                    We...solve problems.  Manage crises.

                                      QUINN
                    Of course.  Right.  Still...an honor.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Harrison feed you a line about being
                      a gladiator in a suit?

                                      HARRISON
                    Liv...

                                      QUINN
                    He did.  And I'm ready.  To gladiate. 
                      Or...whatever.

      Olivia reaches into the basket.  And pulls out a baby.  An
      actual live baby.  Holds it like a grenade.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    You know how to gladiate a diaper
                    change?

      Quinn stares at the baby, stunned.  Then the elevator dings
      and three Arab men in suits rush in followed by a MAN IN A
      TURBAN and his modestly dressed WIFE.  When she sees the
      baby...  

                                    WIFE
                    AHMAD!

      She's crying, moving forward, pulling the baby from Olivia's
      hands into her arms.  The Man in a Turban turns to Olivia.

                                    MAN
                    Thank you, thank you.  When the
                    kidnappers took him, I thought...but
                    you've returned my son to me.  Thank
                    you.

      And he pulls her in for a hug.  One of the men in suits
      discreetly hands Stephen a check.  He checks the amount,
      smiles.  The man in the turban is still hugging Olivia.

                                    MAN (CONT'D)
                    Anything I can do for you.  Anything.

                                      STEPHEN
                    If you have a second child, Olivia
                    is a beautiful name.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Stephen.  -- Mr.  Ambassador, you
                    can take your son back to your
                    consulate and keep him safe.  And
                    you can never tell anyone about this. 
                    Ever.  The FBI is sick of me. 

                                    MAN
                    Of course.  Thank you, thank you.

      And they go.  Passing HUCK (20s), the lone paralegal, as he
      comes in.

                                    HUCK
                    Liv, I've got incoming.

                                      STEPHEN
                    It's after midnight.  Take a phone
                    number.

                                    HUCK
                    Not on the phone.  Here.  And you
                    wanna talk to him.

      Olivia heads out.  Everyone follows her.


      Olivia and the others enter.  There's a MAN (32) there. 
      Handsome and charismatic in a John Edwards way.  His left
      arm doesn't work -- a war injury that only makes him seem
      more heroic.  Right now, though, his shirt and part of his
      face are covered in blood.  He eyes them panicked and lost.

                                    MAN
                    I'm...I didn't know where else to
                    go.  I had a friend...he recommended
                    you.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You're Sully Sinclair.

    He nods.  Stephen leans in to Abby and whispers.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Who's Sully Sinclair?

                                    ABBY
                    The war hero.  The Iraqi Attacker?

      And Stephen nods.  Recognizing him.

                                      SULLY
                    You gotta help me.  Somebody has to
                    help me.  Please...
                          (devastated)
                    My girlfriend.  She's dead.  And the
                    police think I killed her.

      Harrison leans over to Quinn.

                                      HARRISON
                    Welcome to Price and Associates.

                                                                                FADE OUT:

                                        ACT TWO


      Through the glass we can see Sully sitting in the conference
      room.  Someone's given him a towel and he uses it to wipe
      the blood from his face.  Outside the glass, Harrison,
      Stephen, Quinn and Olivia watch him.  Abby arrives, hands
      out a sheath of papers.

                                    ABBY
                    Lieutenant Colonel Sullivan "Sully"
                    Sinclair, age 32, did two tours in
                    Iraq, was injured saving the lives
                    of his entire unit.  A war hero.

                                      STEPHEN
                    And not just any war hero.  The first
                    living person ever to receive a
                      Congressional Medal of Honor from
                    the President for action in any war
                    since Vietnam.  

                                    ABBY
                    A famous war hero.  Working class,
                    patriotic, comes from a long line of
                    soldiers.  Here he is on the cover
                    of Time magazine.

      She passes the page forward.  Olivia looks at it.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Poster boy for the military.

                                    ABBY
                    And for the conservative right. 
                    That's how he makes his living.  He
                    gives expensive speeches.  Makes a
                    fortune.  He's anti-choice, pro-gun,
                    hates the gays and likes it when
                    kids pray in school.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Abby-

                                    ABBY
                    I'm just saying he sickens me
                    politically, I'm not saying we
                    shouldn't help him.  From what I
                    could find, Sully's a straight
                    shooter, no dirty laundry.

                    He's not showing any.

                    Who's the dead girlfriend?

      Abby hands Olivia a photo.  The dead girl smiles out at us,
      happier times.

                                    ABBY
                    Paige Montgomery, 27.

                    Well, she's got a silver spoon in
                    her mouth. 

                                      QUINN
                    How can you tell?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Her teeth.  They're capped.  

                                      HARRISON
                    Rich kids get their teeth fixed.  

      And Quinn subtly puts a hand up to check her teeth.  Olivia
      clocks it.  No one else notices.  But we do.  Huck arrives.

                                    HUCK
                    It's on the police scanners.  Girl
                    was found dead in her apartment,
                    three shots to the head.  Sully called
                    911 but took off before the police
                    arrived.    

                                      HARRISON
                    Three?  That's not an accident.

     Quinn raises her hand.  They look at her.

                                      QUINN
                    What do we...can I ask?  What do we
                    do?  I mean, if we aren't defense
                    attorneys, we're not the District
                    Attorney, it looks like he did it
                    so...what do we do?  What CAN we do?

      Olivia looks in at Sully...


      Our team (Olivia, Abby, Stephen, Quinn, and Harrison) are
      with Sully.  Stephen paces the room -- he's not a sitter. 
      Quinn follows Harrison's lead and takes notes.

                                      OLIVIA  (V.O.)
                    We interview Sully.  

      Sully's emotional, trying for composure.

                                      SULLY
                    I was gonna propose.  We were gonna
                    get married.  She was...Paige was
                    everything to me...she was my best
                    friend...

                                      OLIVIA  (V.O.)
                    We listen to him.  We watch him.  In
                    this moment, we are the judge and we
                    are the jury.  This is the moment
                    when we decide who he is.   

      Quinn's watching, moved.  But everyone else is just watching.  

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Did you kill her?

                                      SULLY
                    No!  No, I would never...I loved
                    her.

                                      HARRISON
                    Where'd the blood come from?

                                      SULLY
                    I went to her apartment.  I...I found
                    her like that.  I held her.  She
                      was...there was so much blood.  I
                    called the police.  And I was waiting
                    for them and then I just...I don't
                    know, I panicked.  I'm on TV, you
                    know?  I didn't know what to...I
                    thought they would think I did it. 
                      I panicked...I'm sorry, I should
                    know how to handle this, I should be
                    better at this...

                                      STEPHEN
                    Where were you?

                    Sir?

                                      STEPHEN
                    Where were you?  During the murder?

                                      SULLY
                    I was...I don't sleep good.  After
                    the war...my arm hurts, I don't wanna
                    take pills...so I walk at night. 
                    Around the neighborhood.  I was
                    walking.  I stopped in at Matty's
                    Pub, had a beer.  Kept walking. 
                    Then I went to see Paige...

                                    ABBY
                    Do you own a handgun?

                                      SULLY
                    A Barretta 22.  It's in the shed
                    behind my house.  I keep it in a
                    lockbox.

                                      HARRISON
                    I'm going to need the key.

      Sully nods.

                                      SULLY
                    I never even thought...she's gone,
                    she's really gone...Oh God...

      Olivia, Abby, Stephen and Harrison exchange looks, weighing
      this.


      The team huddles.  Olivia, Harrison, Stephen, Quinn and Abby.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Clock is ticking.  Let's vote.   

                                      STEPHEN
                    I'm not voting.

                    us anyway.  She knows what I think. 
                    The guy's a fugitive covered in blood. 
                    He did it.

                                      HARRISON
                    I don't think he did it.  He's a
                    soldier, a government issue trained
                    killing machine, he'd have to be an
                    idiot to get her blood all over
                    himself, to call 911 and then run. 
                    But I still vote no.  The press is
                    gonna eat this up  By dawn, the
                    headline's gonna be Iraqi Attacker
                    attacks Society Girl. 

      Quinn watches, it's all moving so fast.  Olivia turns to
      Abby.   

                                    ABBY
                    I don't wanna take it because it's
                    too messy, too much work.  And I
                    hate Republicans. 

      Olivia stares in at Sully.  Shaking, covered in blood, lost.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I vote we take it.

                                    ABBY
                    Liv...

                                      STEPHEN
                    Come on!

      And Olivia hesitates but she's looking at Sully and he's
      starting to cry so...

                                      OLIVIA
                    My gut says he's innocent.  We're
                    taking the case.

      Stephen throws up his hands.  Exasperated.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Which is why I don't like to vote!  

      Stephen glares at Olivia.  She snuggles into him, plants a
      kiss on his cheek.  Soothing him.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    You're pretty and smart...so pretty,
                    so smart...

      And Stephen gives in because, yeah, he's pretty and smart.

      Olivia looks at Sully.  Intense.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Okay.  We're going to get you some
                    clean clothes and put you in
                    Harrison's office.  You are to stay
                    there.  Do not make any phone calls. 
                    Not to work, not to friends, not to
                    press.  No one.  No talking. This is
                    on us now.  Your job is to stay in
                    that office and let us do our job.  

                                      OLIVIA  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Then I warn them.  I always warn
                    them.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    I have one rule.  Do not lie.  Not
                    to me or to anyone who works for me. 
                    You lie, all bets are off.  Got it? 

      Sully nods. 

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Now, is there anything you wanna
                    tell me?  Anything at all.  Because
                    now's your chance.

      Sully ducks his head.  And we wait, nervous.  But when he
      raises his head, we see that his face is streaked with tears.

                                      SULLY
                    I didn't kill her.  She was my best
                    friend.  I loved her.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Sully?  It's never going to be okay. 
                    She's dead and there's nothing I can
                    do about that.  And I'm sorry for
                    your loss.  But the rest?  I can fix
                    the rest.   

      Olivia puts out her hand, takes Sully's.  Full of compassion.

                                      OLIVIA  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Then we go to work...


      Huck sleeps, face down on the sofa.  Stephen comes out. 
      Stands over Huck, claps his hands loudly, startling him awake.

                    We need the war room.


      Abby shows Sully into the office.  Closes the door behind
      him.  Sully looks at the stack of folded clothes on the desk,
      sinks down on to the sofa.  Lost.


      Huck turns the lights on in a small office.  Eyes the desk.


      Quinn stands in the hallway, watches as Huck shoves the desk
      into the hall.  Harrison comes towards her.

                                      QUINN
                    That's the war room?

                    Technically, it's your office.  But
                    yes, it's the war room.

      Harrison, not missing a beat, slides over the top of the
      desk, goes into the office, carrying office supplies.


      A police investigation is in progress, cops coming in and
      out of one of the apartments.  Abby approaches homicide
      detective WALLY.  Cheerful.

                    Hey Wally.  Body still here or did

      Wally sighs.  Abby beams, sweet.


      Harrison and Quinn begin to pin pieces of paper to the walls. 
      Photos of Paige and Sully.  Web articles about Sully.

      Olivia moves past the door.  Calling out.

      the report.

                                      QUINN
                    So I read you guys don't try cases? 
                    You don't go to court?

                                      HARRISON
                    If we do our job right, we never
                    need to go to court.  Look, the reason
                    we're not a law firm?  We don't have
                    to play within the rules of the law. 
                    We're fixers, crisis managers.  We
                    make the problems of our clients go
                    away.  Big or small.  It's not about
                    solving some crime.  It's not about
                    justice.  It's about our client.


    As cops swirl around the crime scene, Abby stands in the
      center of the room.  Pulls out her camera.  Turns slowly,
      taking photos of every angle of the room.  Clicking, clicking,
      clicking on the patch of blood on the living room floor.


      Harrison and Quinn pin up Abby's crime scene photos.

                                      QUINN
                    Is it true Olivia is close friends
                    with the President?

                                      HARRISON
                    You ask a lot of questions.


      Olivia's on the phone, pacing.  Huck appears in the doorway.

                                    HUCK
                    You want me to hack?

      Olivia holds up a finger, telling him to wait.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Kevin, I'm not saying don't write
                    your article.  I'm saying he's a
                    decorated war hero who loved his
                    girlfriend and maybe you can wait to
                    say he did it until there's an arrest. 
                    I'm saying the autopsy report doesn't
                    tell us anything except that she was
                    shot three times so it would be
                      overzealous to describe this as a
                    crime of passion.  I'm not gonna
                    tell you how to do your job, you're
                    brilliant, I'm just saying. -- I'll
                    give you first bite at an interview
                    when we're ready. -- Okay.   you. 

      She hangs up.  Looks at Huck.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Hack.

      Huck takes off.  Olivia dials the phone again.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Maureen.  Hi, it's Olivia.  No, I
                    haven't called him yet.  No, no, he
                    seems like a nice guy and I appreciate
                    you trying to fix me up, it's just...
                    Listen.  I know you're working up a
                    story on the Paige Montgomery murder 
                    and I have some thoughts...


      Stephen enters.  Searches the shelves.  Finds a lockbox. 
      Tries to use a key to open it but the lock is broken.  So he
      just opens it.  It's empty.      UNTITLED SHONDA RHIMES PILOT (2010)     12-17-10   25




      Olivia and Stephen stand over a shocked Sully.

                                      SULLY
                    How can it be missing?  It was in
                    the lockbox.  Oh my God, it looks
                    like I...I have to get out of here.

                                      OLIVIA
                    The lock was broken, your shed's not
                    secure, it could have been stolen. 
                    But Sully?  Look at me.

    He does.  So she can stare him in the face.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Did you kill her?

                                      SULLY
                    No.  I swear.

      A beat.  And Olivia nods.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Okay.

      And they leave.


      The wall is slowly filling.  Huck enters, papers in hand.

                                    HUCK
                    I hacked her Facebook, I'm working
                    on her email.  I hate Google.  It's
                    like a wall with razors at the top. 
                    I gotta get over it without losing a
                    finger.

    He hands over the papers and goes.  Harrison and Quinn pin
      those to the wall.

                                      QUINN
                    I'm not complaining.  But we've been
                    here since last night.  Don't you

                    No.

                      Gladiators.  In suits.

    We watch as the wall is slowly filled.  We time lapse and
      pull back to see Harrison, Quinn, Abby, Olivia and Stephen
      standing there.  Olivia is staring at the completely filled
      wall, everyone else is staring at Olivia.  Waiting.  Then:

                                      OLIVIA
                    We need more.  We don't have anything.  

                                      HARRISON
                    We have everything.  Sully did it.

                                      STEPHEN
                    The guy's alibi is water, gun's
                    conveniently missing, bloody clothes
                    and he's a runner.  He killed her.  

                                    ABBY
                    Definitely killed her.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I'm not willing to concede.  Not
                    yet.  We need more.

      Olivia's iPhone beeps.  She reads the text.  Her face changes.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    I have to step out.  I'll be back.

      She leaves.  Quinn looks at everyone.

                                      QUINN
                    So what happens now?

                                      HARRISON
                    She wants more.  We get more.


      Abby talks to ARIEL MASSE (26), a museum docent. 

                                      ARIEL
                    Yeah, Paige and I had plans to go
                    the French Consulate dinner.  Usually
                    she goes to those things with Sully
                    but my father got me on the invite
                    list and it was just a plus one so...

                                    ABBY
                    What happened?

                                      ARIEL
                    She called at the last minute and
                    canceled.  No big deal.

      But Ariel's shifting back and forth, eager to get away.

                                    ABBY
                    Ariel.  Paige is dead.  You know
                    that.  So if there's something you're
                    not telling me...

      Ariel hesitates.  

                                      ARIEL
                    You have to get this.  Understand
                    it.  Paige loved Sully.  She used to
                    be, we both used to be, you know,
                    party girls.  Always out, always
                    with a different guy.  We did stuff.
                    Drugs. But then Paige met Sully and
                    she just...settled down with him. 
                    It made her family really happy. 
                    They were amazing together...
                          (emotional, crying)
                    I just can't believe she's dead.

                    Ariel, you can cry.  That's
                    understandable.  But it's not going
                    to make me go away.  What aren't you
                    telling me?

      Olivia is shown in by an aide.  Cyrus is waiting.

                    stronger than ever.

      And then MELLIE GRANT (50s) enters the room.  Mellie's
      everything we'd want in a First Lady -- warm, strong and
      funny.  Casual in capris and a sweater.  The every woman.

      Harrison and Quinn work on their computers.  Olivia moves

                    Paige is a whore!  She was screwing

      Olivia enters.  Peers under the stalls.  Quinn's feet are

                    Why me?  What about me made you feel
                    like I was a person you wanted by
                    your side when you decimated a girl
                    walking her dog?

      Olivia examines her.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You went to Yale Law School. 

                                      QUINN
                    So?

      Quinn shifts, uncomfortable.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Before that, you were at Indiana
                    State.  And before that, you did two
                    years at Smithvile Community College. 
                    How'd you get to Yale?

                                      QUINN
                    I...I worked hard.

                                      OLIVIA
                    This is your one chance, Quinn. 
                    How'd you get to Yale?

                                      QUINN
                    Why do you keep asking me that?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Because your resume is a lie.  There
                    is a Quinn Rielly who went to Yale
                    Law but she's working in New York
                    right now.  Your name is Quinn McKee. 
                    I'm guessing you told the lie because
                    a girl like you, a girl with a state
                    school law degree, whose dad is in
                    jail, whose mother is on welfare, a
                    girl who's nobody from nowhere
                    couldn't catch a break in the high
                    powered halls of DC.  

                                      QUINN
                    And you still wanted to hire me?

                                      OLIVIA
                    It's why I hired you.  Hundreds of
                      applicants, all of them with fancy
                    pedigrees and then there's you, who
                    couldn't catch a break.  Not a rich
                    kid, not even a middle class kid. 
                    You come from trash.  -- I fix things,
                    Quinn.  It's who I am.  You?  Need
                    fixing.  And I trust my gut, my gut
                    is everything and my gut tells me
                    you're a fighter.  You walked away
                    from home and you never looked back. 
                    Your hands aren't soft.  And this
                    job, it's not for the weak and it's
                    not for the weary.  So toughen up. 
                    You don't cry here.  You don't cry
                    in this job until all is lost.  You
                    don't cry when you're in the middle
                    of this job and there's still hope. 
                    So wipe your tears and let's get
                    back to work.

      Olivia grabs some paper towels and holds them out to Quinn.

                                      QUINN
                    How did you find out?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Abby's good at her job.  And rich
                    kids get their teeth fixed.  And I
                    come from trash too.

      Quinn takes the paper towels.  Olivia leaves.  Quinn stands
      there a beat.  Then she wipes her tears and heads out.


      Olivia stands in front of the bank of TVs that make up one
    of her walls.  They're all on, sound off.  Except for one. 
    On one, live footage of the President plays.  He heads from
      his helicopter, waving and smiling for the press.  Holding
      Mellie's hand.  Cyrus is with them.  A REPORTER speaks.

                                      REPORTER
                    The President and the First Lady are
                    just now returning to the White House
                    where tonight they will be hosting a
                    State Dinner for President Sarkozy
                    and the French First Lady...

      She eyes the image.  Unsettled.  Grabs her cell, dials.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Put him on.  I just need a second.

      And on the TV screen, we can see Cyrus handing the President
      his cell phone.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Did you buy her a dog?

    We can see the President's lips moving on the TV but we hear
      him in Liv's phone.

                                    FITZ
                    What?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Just answer the question.

                                    FITZ
                    No.  Of course not.  Why do you ask?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Do me a favor.  Turn your head a
                    little to the left.

      And he does.  So she can now see his full face on the TV
      screen.  She gets close to the screen, stares into his eyes.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Okay.  Sorry.  Forget I asked.

      And she hangs up.  On TV, Fitz hangs up.  Olivia nods to
      herself.  Reassured.  Stephen comes in.

                                      STEPHEN
                    How big are we?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Sully's on the crawl on the big three
                    cable news stations.  All over Drudge. 
                    Networks haven't got it but the
                    nightly news is still a few hours
                    away.   

                                      STEPHEN
                    I've had my ear to the ground.  Diane
                    Sawyer's sniffing.  Anybody give it
                    a logo yet?

                                      OLIVIA
                    Not yet.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Good.  We're not big until we're
                    logo big.

      Abby enters with Harrison.

                                    ABBY
                    I've got good, I've got bad, I've
                    got ugly.  The Good:  Paige was
                    sleeping with Tom Pierson.  Bad: he
                    has an airtight alibi.  He was working
                    as a bouncer at a club at the time
                    of the murder.  100 witnesses.  Ugly? 
                    Tom claims Sully KNEW he was sleeping
                    with his girlfriend.  Which gives
                    Sully motive.

                                      HARRISON
                    Even uglier: The ballistics on the
                    gun used in the murder match the
                    type of gun Sully owned.  Which gives
                    Sully means.

                    Dammit!

      And Olivia heads out of her office.


      Olivia storms in, Stephen and Abby right behind her.  Sully's
      sitting on the sofa, he looks up surprised.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Did you know Paige was sleeping with
                    Tom Pierson?

                                      SULLY
                    What?

                                      OLIVIA
                    DID YOU KNOW?!

                                      SULLY
                    Hey, I hired you.  You can't yell at-

                                      STEPHEN
                    Yes, she can.  She can do whatever
                    the hell she wants because if she
                    doesn't you are definitely going to
                    jail.  You might go to jail anyway
                    but you're definitely going if you
                    don't answer her questions.  My guess
                    is 20 years but if the DA gets fancy,
                    a life sentence is a possibility. 
                    Is that what you want?

      Sully is cowed.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Did you know that Paige was sleeping
                    with Tom Pierson?

      Sully pauses a long time.  Then:

                                      SULLY
                    Yeah.  Yeah, I knew.

      And Abby and Stephen sigh, so disappointed.  Olivia looks at
      her watch.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Okay, we don't have a lot of time
                    before the DA puts out an arrest
                    warrant.

                    Stephen, have Harrison and Quinn
                    draft a statement.  Use the words
                    "war hero" and "decorated by the
                    President" as many times as possible. 
                    Abby, work the phones and get me
                    five soldiers, preferably with bars
                    on their uniforms, who are willing
                    to attest to Sully's heroism and
                    kindness on the record.  Mr. 
                    Sinclair, I'm going to give you the
                    names of some very fine defense
                    attorneys and-

                                      SULLY
                    Wait, wait, I knew.  But I didn't
                    kill her.  I know what you think, I
                    know what it looks like.  But I did
                    not kill Paige.  Paige used to, she
                    slept around a lot before...This
                    guy, this Tom...I would have forgiven
                    her.  I did not kill her.  You have
                    to believe me.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Sully, there's not a lot I can-

                                      SULLY
                    I'm a soldier.  I've killed.  Dozens
                    of men.  Sometimes by tossing a
                    grenade but other times...I've looked
                    into the faces of men as I killed
                    them.  I know what it means to take
                    a life.  I couldn't do that...I don't
                    even know how a person could do that
                    to someone they loved.  I loved Paige. 
                    She was my best friend.  She knew
                    me, truly knew me like no one ever
                    has.  She was my best friend.  I
                    didn't kill her.

      And he's earnest and open and in so much pain.  Off Olivia...


      Olivia comes in with Stephen and Abby.

                    send the rest back.

                    They're engagement rings.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Yes.

                                      OLIVIA
                    For getting engaged.

                                      STEPHEN
                    They're engage-

                                      OLIVIA
                    STEPHEN.  You have a reservation.  8
                    pm.  Chez Henri.  Best table.  Huck
                    already called Georgia, she's meeting
                    you there.  Pick a ring.  Marry the
                    girl.  Be normal.

                                      STEPHEN
                    You can't just...you're bullying me.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Georgia gave you six months to propose
                    or she was walking out. 

                                      STEPHEN
                    She was bullying me too.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    I've known you since law school. 
                    And since I met you, you've dated a
                    series of women I can only describe
                    as trashy and too young for you and
                    most of all stupid.  Georgia is funny
                    and fun and old enough and brilliant, 
                    and she loves you and your six months
                    is up and you know you want to marry
                    her, we all know you want to marry
                    her, so pick a damned ring already
                    so you can go find an alibi for Sully
                    Sinclair!

      Stephen is quiet.  Then, grudgingly, he points at a ring.

                                      STEPHEN
                    She'll like this one.

                                    HUCK
                    Excellent choice.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Your boss is a bully.

      But he's beaming.  He heads out with Huck.  Abby hangs back
      until he's gone.  Looks at Olivia, mournful.

                                    ABBY
                    I need the speech.

      Olivia comes to stand right in front of Abby.  Patient.

                                      OLIVIA
                          (the millionth time)
                    Stephen is not the man for you.  
                    Your love for him is misguided and
                    will only lead to humiliation and
                    pain.  If you were to confess your
                    love, it would only lead to
                      humiliation and pain.  If you were
                    to sleep with Stephen, it would only
                    lead to humiliation and pain.  You
                    are an amazing beautiful strong woman
                    and someday you are going to meet a
                    man who gets that.  He is the right
                    man for Georgia.  But for you? 

                                    ABBY
                      Humiliation and pain. 

                                      OLIVIA
                    Exactly.

                                    ABBY
                    Thank you.  I needed that.

      She's so sad.  Olivia hugs her.  Feeling for her.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Boys are stupid.


      Olivia heads into the lobby.  To the sound of arguing.  A
      nervous Quinn blocks Julia who is trying to get past her.

                                      JULIA
                    I want to see her!

                                      QUINN
                    She's not available-

                                      JULIA
                    Let me through-

                                      OLIVIA
                    Julia.

      Quinn and Julia both turn to see Olivia.  Julia moves to
      her.  Desperate and emotional.

                                      JULIA
                    I want you to give him a message.

                    That's not appropriate.

                                      JULIA
                    Not appropriate?  Not appropriate? 
                    You came to me.  You came to me and
                    I know he sent you, I know you can
                    get him a message-

                                      OLIVIA
                    This conversation is over.  Please
                    leave.  

      Olivia presses the elevator button.

                                      JULIA
                    I quit my job, okay?  I did it.  Now 
                    please, give him a message-

      The elevator arrives.  Olivia holds open the door.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I will call security.

      And Julia gets on the elevator.  Olivia leans in, presses
      the button for the first floor.  As the door close...

                                      JULIA
                    I wasn't lying!  You hear me!  I
                    wasn't lying!  I wasn't-

      And the doors close.  Olivia breathes.  Then she turns to
      say something to Quinn.  But she never gets to say it because
      the other elevator dings.  Opens.  David is there, with
      homicide detective Wally and a few uniformed cops.

                                      DAVID
                    Time's up, Liv.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I have 40 minutes.

                                      DAVID
                    Fine.  Forty minutes.  And then I
                    want Sully Sinclair in handcuffs.

      Olivia sighs.  Points at the men, stern.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You stay out here.  Nobody crosses
                    that doorway.

      She turns to Quinn, speaks low.

                    Get Abby on the phone, tell her we've
                    been invaded.  Tell her time is up.


      Stephen and Abby stand in the small office.  HOWIE (50s)
      sits with his back to a bank of video cameras.  Arms folded. 
      They're waiting.  And then Harrison hurries in.

                                      HARRISON
                    I have five hundred dollars in cash
                    and a pizza.

                                    ABBY
                    Howie, meet your five hundred dollars
                    and your pizza.

                                      HOWIE
                    Deep dish, sausage and mushroom?

                                      HARRISON
                    Yeah.

                                      HOWIE
                    Show me.

      Harrison opens the box, shows Howie the pizza.  Howie nods,
      takes the cash and counts it.  Stephen looks at his watch.

                                      STEPHEN
                    We have a ticking clock here, Howie-

      Finally Howie finishes counting the money.  Then he turns
      back to his video monitors.

                                      HOWIE (CONT'D)
                    Now, what do you wanna see?

                                    ABBY
                    Last night.  Between 10 and midnight. 
                    The bank camera that points northeast,
                    towards Matty's Pub. Speed through...

      Howie does.  And then Abby points.

                                    ABBY (CONT'D)
                    Stop!  Right there.

                                      HARRISON
                    Is that...Sully?

      They stare at the monitors a beat.  A little stunned.

                                      STEPHEN
                    We're going to need a copy of that. 


      Sully is there, pacing.  Abby, Stephen and Olivia enter. 

                                      OLIVIA
                    We don't have a lot of time.  The
                    police are here.

                                      SULLY
                    They're here?  How did they know
                    where I was?

                                      OLIVIA
                    I called them. 

                                      SULLY
                    You called-

                                      OLIVIA
                    I gave my word to the US Attorney to
                    deliver you in 18 hours.  We have
                    four minutes on the clock.  So I
                    need you to listen.

      Olivia nods at Abby who moves to the DVD player and pops in
      a disc.

                                      OLIVIA
                    We were able to verify your alibi.

                                      SULLY
                    You were.  That's good, right?

      But he looks wary.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Sully, you're the most decorated
                    soldier since the Vietnam War.  You
                    come from a family of soldiers.  You
                    make your living giving speeches for
                    the conservative right.  And you've
                    said it over and over again: Paige
                    was your best friend.  Not your lover. 
                    Your best friend.  

      Abby hits play.  And on the tape, we see security camera
      footage of Sully walking alone.  And then a man approaching
      him.  They greet each other with a long, intimate kiss and
      then head away together.  Olivia looks at Sully.  He stares
      into space.  Not wanting to watch.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Coming from where you come from,
                    being who you are, being a gay soldier
                    isn't something you feel you can
                    tell anyone.  But Paige knew, didn't
                    she?  She was your best friend.  She
                    knew you were gay, the two of you
                    had a deal.

                                      SULLY
                    You can't show that tape to anyone.

                                      OLIVIA
                    I need the name of the man you were
                    kissing.

                                      SULLY
                    No.  You can't show the tape, you
                    can't have a name.

                                      OLIVIA
                    It's your alibi.

                                      SULLY
                    No.  I'm not...you can't tell people
                    that I'm gay.  I'm a hero.

                    The police have a warrant for your
                    arrest.  All due respect, being gay
                    is no big deal compared to that. 

                                      SULLY
                    No.  I'm a hero.  I honor the uniform.

                    help you.  

                                      STEPHEN
                    Come on, Sully...

      And Sully hesitates.   Then:

                                      SULLY
                    No.

      And he gets up and heads out.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Sully...


      Sully strides into the lobby.  Olivia, Abby and Stephen
      follow.  David and Wally wait there with a slew of police. 

                                      WALLY
                    Sullivan Sinclair, you have the right
                    to remain silent, if you give up
                    that right...

      And Sully is handcuffed.  Eyes on Olivia the whole time. 


      Quinn gets her purse, grabs her coat.  Huck comes in.

                                    HUCK
                    You seen Olivia?

                                      QUINN
                    Sully was just arrested.  Olivia
                    went to the police station.

                                    HUCK
                    Oh...

    He stands there, unsure.

                                      QUINN
                    What's up?  I'm on my way there...

                                    HUCK
                    I got a strange call.  Some girl
                    named Julia Tannen?

                                      QUINN
                    What about her?

                                    HUCK
                    She's in the hospital.  She tried to
                    kill herself.

                                                                                FADE OUT:

                                      ACT FIVE


      We're on Sully as he's photographed for his arrest.  Facing
      forward.  Flash.  Turned to the side.  FLASH.  His face blank.


      Abby comes in, meets up with Stephen, Harrison and Olivia. 
      Stephen's on the phone.

                                    ABBY
                    Reporters are starting to gather

                    Crap.  

      Stephen hangs up his cell.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Connors is on his way.  He's not
                    great but he's the best defense
                    attorney I could find at this hour. 

                                    ABBY
                    What do we do?

                                      OLIVIA
                    His entire public image, his entire
                      self-image, is built on being a
                      conservative.  If he won't let us
                    use the alibi...

                                      HARRISON
                    Can we leak it?

                                      OLIVIA
                    He's our client.  We have to do what
                    he wants.  -- I hate this.

      Olivia's cell beeps.  She checks the text.  Her face changes.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    I have to go.

                                      HARRISON

                    They won't arraign him until morning. 
                    I'll be back.  Get in to see Sully. 
                    Don't let him talk to anyone but us.

      She heads out.  Harrison heads for the officer at the desk. 
      Stephen checks his watch.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Georgia's gonna be waiting at Chez

                                    ABBY
                    Harrison's a lawyer, he'll get me in
                    to see Sully.  Go. 
                          (off his hesitation)
                    GO.

                                      STEPHEN
                    Thanks.

                                    ABBY
                    Good luck.

      And he heads out.  Abby watches him go, a little dejected.


      Quinn sits with Julia, who sleeps.  She looks up to see Olivia
      striding down the hall.  She gets up, comes out.

                                      QUINN
                    I didn't know what to do.  I thought
                    you'd want me to stay with her so...

                                      OLIVIA
                    What happened?

                                      QUINN
                    She slashed her wrists.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Any press sniffing around?

                                      QUINN
                    No.  No one.  One of the nurses told
                    me her dad's flying in.  He'll be
                    here in the morning.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Okay.  She hasn't spoken to anyone,
                    no nurses or doctors about...anything?

                                      QUINN
                    Just to me.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Good.

      She turns to go.  Quinn steps forward.

                                      QUINN
                    Olivia.  You said to trust your gut. 
                    My gut says she's telling the truth.

                                      OLIVIA
                    She's not.

                                      QUINN
                    How do you-

                                      OLIVIA
                    Because I know the President.

                                      QUINN
                    Okay, it's just...she was going on
                    and on about how there's this little
                    secret room off the Oval Office where
                    they'd meet and I've read about the
                    White House, there is a little room-

                                      OLIVIA
                    If you read it, she read it.  People
                    are crazy, they get fixated on famous
                    people, they stalk them-

                                      QUINN
                    But I don't think she's crazy.  

      Olivia pauses.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Tell me why.

                                      QUINN
                    Okay.  She tried to kill herself but
                    she didn't want to die.  She called
                    you right after she did it.  Because
                    she wanted him to find out she was
                    hurt and come see her.  She thought
                    he would do that.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Quinn-

                    She was going on and on about how
                    she thought he'd come and call her
                    "Sweet Baby" and everything would be
                    fine-

                                      OLIVIA
                    What?

      Olivia's frozen.

                                      QUINN
                    What?

                                      OLIVIA
                    What did you say?

                                      QUINN
                    That he'd come if she was hurt...

                                      OLIVIA
                    And call her "Sweet Baby."

                                      QUINN
                    Yes.  And I was just thinking that
                    if she-

      But Olivia is already walking away.  Quinn stands there. 
      Then she heads back in to sit by Julia's bed.


    An AIDE ushers Olivia into the Oval Office.  Fitz isn't there.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Where is he?

      The Aide presses a finger to her headset.

                                    AIDE
                    POTUS is on the move.  It'll just be
                    one moment.

      She leaves, closing the door.  Olivia stands there.  Her
      cell rings.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Stephen?  I can't talk now.  -- What's

                    coming. -- Maybe half an hour. --
                    Because I'm doing something.  I'll
                    be there.  I have to go.

      She hangs up.  Just stands there.  And then the door opens,
      Fitz strides in followed by Cyrus and two aides.  They're in
      tuxedos.  Fitz beams when he sees her.

                                    FITZ
                    Livvie!  This is a surprise.

      Olivia says nothing.  Just looks at him.  And Fitz's smile
      fades.  They stare at one another.  

                                    FITZ (CONT'D)
                    We're going to need the room, please.

      Cyrus is confused but he can tell this isn't good.  

                                      CYRUS
                    Sir, you have to give the toast to
                    the President of France in ten
                    minutes, maybe you can do this at
                    another-

                                    FITZ
                    We need the room.

      And Fitz and Olivia stand frozen until Cyrus and the Aides
      have cleared the room.  When they hear the door close:

                                    FITZ (CONT'D)
                    Livvie-

      And Olivia is flying across the room at him.  Hitting his
      chest, shoving him, slapping his face.  Fury and energy
      propelling her as she hollers:

                                      OLIVIA
                    Sweet baby?  Sweet baby?  SWEET BABY?!

      And he doesn't fight her back, he just uses his hands to
      hold her off.  But finally, Olivia lands one good punch. 
      Right to Fitz's face.  His nose bloodies.  And then she runs
      out of energy.  She stands there, breathing in and out.  So
      incredibly hurt.  

                                    FITZ
                    You left me.

                    BECAUSE YOU ARE MARRIED!  Because

      Fitz crosses to her.  She backs away.

                    Don't touch me.  Don't you dare touch

      But he's touching her.  Taking her face in his hands.  Kissing
      her.  She leans into him a beat.  Then she shoves him back.

                    I love you.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Shut up!  I believed you!  You clouded
                    my judgment!  You made me mistrust
                    my gut because I wanted to believe
                    you!  I destroyed that girl!  She
                    tried to kill herself! 

      The door opens, Cyrus enters.

                                      CYRUS
                    I just want to say that we can hear
                    you screaming from out-

      And he pauses.  Because Fitz has turned towards him and Cyrus
      can see his bloody nose.  Blood's now dripping onto his shirt. 
      And Cyrus goes from casual to official in an instant. 

                                      CYRUS (CONT'D)
                    Mr.  President, go to the residence
                    and change your shirt.  I'll send up
                    the medic.

                                    FITZ
                    Cy, she didn't meant to, it was an
                    accident-

                                      CYRUS
                    GO TO THE RESIDENCE AND CHANGE YOUR
                    SHIRT!

      And Fitz, with one last glance at Olivia, leaves by the
      residence door.  Olivia and Cyrus are alone.  He's staring
    at her the way you stare at a strange animal unlike any you've
      ever seen.

                                      CYRUS (CONT'D)
                    You attacked the President of the
                    United States.  You realize that's a
                    federal offense.  I could have the
                    Secret Service take you into custody.

                                      OLIVIA
                    And what will you tell the public? 
                    That the President's mistress beat
                    him up?  You do that, Cyrus.  Go
                    ahead.

                                      CYRUS
                    Mother of God. 

      And it's clear from Cyrus' face that he's shocked.  He looks
    at her, feeling sorry for her.  And she realizes...

                                      OLIVIA
                    You didn't know.  He tells you
                      everything...

                                      CYRUS
                    He didn't tell me this.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    Because it didn't matter enough.

      And Olivia strides past him, out of the Oval Office.  Cyrus
      stands there.  Taking it in.

                                      CYRUS
                    Mother of God.


    An elegant busy French restaurant.  Olivia enters, still a
      little frazzled but together.  Goes to the hostess.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Can you tell me what table-

                                      STEPHEN
                    Liv-

      Stephen's peering at her from the coat check room. 

                                      OLIVIA
                    Never mind.

      And she heads over to him.  

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    What are you...you're in a coat
                    closet.  What do you need, did you
                    forget the ring or something-

                                      STEPHEN
                    I have the ring.

      But he looks just sick with fear and panic.  So Olivia's
      tender with him.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You can do this.

                                      STEPHEN
                    I don't think I can.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Tell me.

                                      STEPHEN
                    What if...what if I mess it up? 
                    What if I marry her and I cheat or
                    she gets bored with me or...
                          (struggling)
                    What if she doesn't love me enough? 
                    I'm not a good guy, Livvie.  What if
                    she leaves me? 

      And that was incredibly hard for him to say.  Olivia takes
      his hands in hers.  Eyes on his.  

                                      OLIVIA
                    I gotta trust my gut.  And my gut's
                    what?  

                                      STEPHEN
                    Never wrong.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Never wrong.  And my gut tells me
                    that she's in this.  She's in this
                    with you.  And if it doesn't work,
                    it doesn't work.  But you have to
                    try.  Because if you try, if you
                    leap and you try and it doesn't work
                    out...it's not on you.  

      And he's starting to relax.

                                      STEPHEN
                    It's not on me.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You can do this.  

                                      STEPHEN
                    Okay, okay.  I can do this.

                                      OLIVIA
                    You can do this.  Go.  Be happy. 
                    Get some normal. 

    He kisses her cheek.  And then he heads out.  And Olivia
      peers out of the coat closet to watch as Stephen strides
      through the restaurant to a table where GEORGIA (30s), a
      pretty sweet woman, sits.  As Stephen gets down on one knee. 
      Pulls out a ring.  As he speaks, passionately but nervously. 
      And then Georgia squeals and kisses Stephen and he puts a
      ring on her finger.  As the whole restaurant applauds.

      And then, as Stephen beams with happiness, Olivia ducks back
      out of sight.  And then alone in the coat check room, Olivia
      starts to cry.  Really cry.  Painful gut-wrenching sobs. 
      Stephen's joy making her heartbreak so much more present. 
      She allows herself just a moment.  And then she pulls herself
      together, sucks her tears back in and heads out.


      Quinn sits by a sleeping Julia's bed.  She looks up.  Harrison
      comes in.

                                      QUINN
                    What are you doing here?

                    to tell you.

                                      HARRISON
                    Okay.

    He sits down.  Quinn looks at him a beat.

                                      QUINN
                    So...Sully's innocent.  He didn't
                    kill Paige?

                                      HARRISON
                    Yes.

                                      QUINN
                    Then who did?

                                      HARRISON
                    Doesn't matter.  I mean, it matters. 
                    Just not to us.  All that matters to
                    us is Sully.  That's the job.

      A beat.

                                      QUINN
                    You said we were the good guys.  

                                      HARRISON
                    We are.

                                      QUINN
                    Really?  I mean...is Olivia?  Is she
                    one of the good guys?

                                      HARRISON
                    No.  
                          (off her disappointment)
                    I was a paralegal.  Olivia found me,
                    hired me and paid my way through law
                    school.  She's not one of the good
                    guys.  She's the best guy.

      Quinn takes that in.  Harrison tilts his head, measuring her
      temperature.  Then gently:

                                      HARRISON (CONT'D)
                    It's not enough to say it.  You gotta
                    believe it.

      And they share a smile.


      Abby sits with Sully.  Sully is stone-faced, not looking at
      them.  Olivia rounds the corner and an officer lets her into
      the cell.  Abby approaches.

                                    ABBY
                    He's gone all military on us.  He
                    won't talk.

                                      OLIVIA
                    Give us a minute.

      Abby heads out.  Olivia sits down beside Sully.  He won't
      look at her.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    Sully, I saw that kiss.  You love
                    that man.  Whoever he is.  You love
                    him.  You've been living with a secret
                    for really long time.  I know what
                    that's like.  I honestly do.  And
                    you think you're doing it for the
                    right reasons.  You think you're
                    doing it for your country and for
                    the people who look up to you.  But
                    the thing is, who you are, who you
                    choose to love, that shouldn't be a
                    secret.  It shouldn't have to be a
                    secret.  Should it?

      Sully doesn't say anything.  But he's listening.

                                      OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                    We may never know who killed Paige. 
                    But this isn't about you not going
                    to jail for Paige's murder.  This is
                    about you not living a lie.  Not
                    hiding.  This is about you standing
                    up and being who you are.  That's
                    honorable.  That's brave.  That's
                    heroic.  And that's who you are,
                    Sully.  You're a hero.  You fought a
                    war and you were braver than I can
                    ever imagine being.  This is just
                    another war.  For every gay person
                    who ever wore a uniform.  Be brave
                    now.

      A long, long beat.  And then just as Olivia's giving up,
      just as she's standing...Sully looks up at her.

                                      SULLY
