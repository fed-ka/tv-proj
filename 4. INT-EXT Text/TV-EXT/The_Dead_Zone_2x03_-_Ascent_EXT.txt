                                        SARAH
                        Fine.  Next time, it's an Ingmar
                        Bergman double feature for you.

          episode, Descent.}  It's a pleasant, just-stopped-raining
          kind of night.  We're walking with Sarah exiting the
          theater.

          And as we walk along in silence for a moment, we sneak
          out of the subjective pov and come around to find Sarah
          walking not with Walt but with Johnny who now occupies
          the experience of Walt.  (We will refer to him hereafter
          as Johnny/Walt.  As with past episodes, i.e. "Enigma",
          Johnny is repeating the lines verbatim as Walt said them. 
          He is literally walking in Walt's shoes.  He is unable to
          react within the experiences but he will remember them
          later.) 

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        You gonna tell me what's going
                        on?

                                        SARAH
                          Nothing's going on.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        You pick a movie starring The
                        Rock for us to go to and you don't
                        think something's going on...

          He stops and looks at her and then away... studying lights
          of the village... this isn't easy for him...

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        Or the dozens of other little
                        things.  Like the surprise lunch
                        dates in the middle of the week. 
                        And watching an entire football
                        game with me and J-J...

                                        SARAH
                        Well, I'm sorry.  I'll try to
                        make more time to ignore you both.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        ...At the same time, the evening
                        phone calls with Johnny Smith
                          suddenly end...

                                        SARAH
                        I had to marry a cop.

          She takes a beat to frame an explanation, an honest
            dishonest one she can live with.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: ASCENT - ACT ONE - REV. 11/04/02 GRN       15.

                                        SARAH
                        We're taking time.  Trying to
                        figure out how we fit into each
                        other's lives... or if we even
                        do.


  2727CLOSE ANGLE ON JOHNNY/WALT

          Losing Sarah.

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        Funny cause right now, it seems
                        to me you're trying awfully hard
                        to figure out how you fit into
                        our life.  

          And as he looks at her a beat, CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE OFF
          HIS FACE TO REVEAL that we're no longer on the street but
          in... 



          Through the rain, a movie theater comes into view.  It's
          the same street seen earlier, but now it's 1995.  The
          marquee reads "Il Postino".  And Sarah is eight months
            pregnant.  They're walking together under an umbrella...

                                        SARAH (CONT'D)
                        The doctor told me he's as good
                        as dead.  As hard as it is, I
                        have to accept that.  And I'm
                        trying to, Walt...

          And it sure seems to Johnny/Walt that she's trying to
          reach out to him, opening a door... he looks at her with
          moonstruck eyes...

                                        SARAH
                        I just want you to know that. 

          As in: 'don't give up on me'.  She smiles that magical
          smile... but for a rough and tumble cop, he's awkward,
            uncertain how to appropriately proceed...

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        Sarah, I know it hasn't been very
                        long but the time we've spent
                          together... 

                                        SARAH
                        You've been the best friend anyone
                        could ever have in a situation
                        like this...
                                (grin, re: her belly)
                          ...especially a situation like
                        this... I don't know many other
                        men who would've wanted to...

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                                (overlapping, simply,
                                  honestly)
                        I'm not like other men, Sarah. 

                                        SARAH
                                (beat)
                        No.  You're not.

          And that is a simple exchange but it carries the weight
          of Sarah realizing how much he's come to mean to her.  


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: ASCENT - ACT TWO - 10/24/02 WHITE          28.

                                        SARAH
                        I don't know what I would've done
                        without you. 

          He studies her and decides to take the chance... he leans
          into her and softly kisses her for the first time... it's
          short but awfully nice... Sarah feels the tug of two
            worlds... but she doesn't pull away...

                                          JOHNNY/WALT
                        I've been dreaming of that since
                        that first moment I saw you at
                        the coffee machine.

                                        SARAH
                        I know.

          He kisses her again - longer this time - and now he puts
          his arms gently around her and this is everything he ever
          hoped it would be... right here in the rain... with people
          walking by... and it's incredibly romantic...


    4141CLOSE-UP ON THE TWO FACES

          And we begin to turn 360 degrees... and this becomes an
          incredible kiss... because it tells a story just by the
          setting... because now she's wearing a wedding gown and
          we hear people clapping... and now they're naked (this is
          still just a close-up of two faces) and we hear a baby
          crying from another room... and now their kiss breaks and
          we stay on Johnny/Walt's close-up as we LOSE SARAH and
          Johnny/Walt reacts as he hears...

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                        I was in a car accident.  Six
                        years ago.

          Turning out of the close-up to find Johnny/Walt is talking
          to Johnny in the scene from "What It Seems" where they
          first met in...



          We hear the rain.  It's 1995.  The marquee reads "Il
            Postino".  Walt and Sarah (eight months pregnant) walk
          along under an umbrella... Johnny and Joe watch from a
          few yards away... they're under an umbrella too; yeah,
          it's silly but strange things happen in the mind...

                                        SARAH
                        I don't know what I would've done
                        without you. 

          Walt studies her and decides to take the chance... he
          leans into her and softly kisses her for the first time...
          it's short but awfully nice... Sarah feels the tug of two
            worlds... but she doesn't pull away...

                                        WALT
                        I've been dreaming of that since
                        that first moment I saw you at
                        the coffee machine.

                        Human nature is so predictable. 
                        And ultimately so irrelevant.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Irrelevant?

                        And nothing in between counts?

                                        JOE
                        Not to me.

                                (sighs)
                        Look at them -- two lost souls
                        who find each other in a time of
                        adversity.  It's a real heart-
                        tugger.  Let them go... a few
                        extra seconds together won't
                        matter.

          Johnny studies the old man... they're now alone in the
          rain...

                        You don't sound like any part of
                        Walt.  I don't think you're a
                        figment of his imagination.

                        Purdy will have some interesting
                          theories when this is over.  And
                        it has to be over soon, John.

                        All this back and forth... You're
                        making him suffer unnecessarily. 
                        I don't want him getting upset. 
                        He has to accept that it's his
                        time.

                        He did.  Hours ago.  That's why I
                        came.  He called me.  In a manner
                        of speaking.  This would have
                        been over already if you hadn't

                        It's what John Wayne would do. 
                        This... attempt... is all very

                                        JOE
                        Indeed you were.  You just clung
                        and clung and clung to infernal
                        life... frankly I got tired of
                        waiting...




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: ASCENT - ACT THREE - REV. 10/31/02 PINK    42.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You don't have to wait any more...  

                                        JOE
                                (beat, sly)
                        You're right about that, John. 
                        But I'm not in the trading
                          business.

            Suddenly, bright interactive light strikes Joe's face
          from above - it might be lightning from an approaching
            thunderstorm but we suspect not... it's too sustained...
          too eerie...

                                        JOE
                        You see John, the stress on your
                        body right now is far greater
                        than anyone understands... they
                        don't make machines that can
                        monitor what's happening inside
                        you.  This excursion with Wally...
                        it was a nice opportunity for us  
                        to renew our friendship... that's
                        why I let it continue... that's
                        why I let you think you might
                        just be able to take Walt with
                        you... but the truth is, all this
                        time, he's been taking you with
                        him...
                                (beat)
                        And now there's no going back,
                        John.  For either of you.

          Joe puts a sympathetic hand on Johnny's shoulder and on
          his touch... we hear a shrill sound....  BEEEEEEEEP...



          Johnny finds himself alone on the deserted street... Joe
          has disappeared... the sustained white light from above
          that we saw at the end of the last scene here is increasing
          in intensity... Johnny shields his eyes from the brightness
          as he tries to see what it is... and it is an extraordinary
          sight:


          WIDER

          Johnny in the foreground... as the street and all the
            buildings seem to spring "leaks" of light, splitting
          through tiny holes as though light termites are eating
          away at the very reality of the street itself... this
          memory is falling away into the light...


          JOHNNY

          begins to run from the light...



          Well, you can't even call it night or day anymore... it's
          just weird... like a fire in the sky is washing out our
          vision of the world... it's hot in a photographic sense... 
          almost feels like a nuclear aftermath somehow...

          Johnny bursts out the front door... looking for the kids
          who were chanting but...


          HIS POV - OF THE DESERTED STREET

          no kids... nothing... except, Jesus, dust blowing down
          the street in the wind... as in dust to dust...


          ANGLE - JOHNNY

          begins to run... he doesn't know where... he just has to
          run... 



          with the same fire in the sky... a nice big city square...
          Bangor's version of Times Square... completely deserted
          and devoid of life... the small figure of Johnny running
          into the square is barely visible... this is all one
          helluva nightmare...


          CLOSE ON JOHNNY

            breathing hard... and it's getting warm and he's starting
          to sweat a bit... if he's had a jacket on through this,
          he rips it off... he looks over to see --


          JOHNNY'S POV - THE SHERIFF'S STATION

          He runs inside...



          Time has passed.

                                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
