  Amy and Rosa work at their desks.  Jake walks in and Charles, 
  holding some files, approaches.

                              CHARLES
                Hey Jake.  First of all: for being such 
                great secondaries, I got you and Rosa 
                  lemon-infused madelleines, dusted with 
                Tunisian almonds.

                              ROSA
                I m allergic to almonds.

  She tosses it in the trash.

                              CHARLES
                      (sotto)
                That was 22 dollars.
                      (then)
                So, have you heard anything from the 
                M.E.?  She hasn t sent the autopsy 
                report.

                              JAKE
                That s weird.  Maybe probably a ton of 
                other people died and she got busy.  
                That s what definitely happened.

                              CHARLES
                Just let me know when she calls.

  Charles exits and Jake turns to Amy and Rosa.

                              JAKE
                Hey, I need to ask you guys something.  
                Can you keep a secret?

                              ROSA
                Do you know anything about my life?

                              JAKE
                Good point, no I do not.  So... you know 
                that new Medical Examiner?  I kind of had 
                sex with her last night.

                Sorry -- I forgot who I was talking to.  
                Sex is this thing that two adults do with 
                their bodies when they re attracted to 
                each other.

  Amy rolls her eyes.

                              ROSA
                He s right, Santiago.  Do you not know 
                that?

                              AMY
                I meant: what were you thinking?  She was 
                supposed to be doing an autopsy for your 
                primary, Charles.

                              JAKE
                Guy died of natural causes -- it s not a 
                big deal.  So...back to last night.  As 
                you can imagine, I m usually up for 
                  anything.  But I can t tell whether this 
                was weird or sexy...
