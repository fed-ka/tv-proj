      Sunshine.     City sworker ants streaming towards us - 
      making their way to offices and shops;

      A moment.    City life.   Then;

      Pick out one figure, someone less ordinary; someone who 
      doesn t fit.

      MICKEY STONE, late thirties, sexy, walks along - surrounded 
    by worker ants, inscrutable.  

    He sees huge bill board advertising lipstick - giant pair of 
    red pursed lips with the slogan  Never give a sucker an even 
      break .    

    He looks at camera, wry smile. 



      Smart polished shoes - pan up expecting to see city gent, 
      instead it s ASH MORGANa rather scruffy man in his early 
      fifties, but looking much older, careworn....Walking along 
    row of shops with heavy shopping bag...

      No-one pays him any attention, a face in the crowd.

    He looks at camera.



    ASH MORGAN turns the corner, proceeds on his way.



      DANNY BLUE comes out of side door in alleyway, daylight hits 
      him.   Followed closely by the memory of his losses.

    He heads out of alley into street.   Potless. 


      MUSIC fades to background;



      MICKEY sits in back of black cab, he takes slip of paper from 
      pocket, checks it as cab stops;

      They are parked at end of Mews, MICKEY looks through cab 
      window.

      A woman appears [his wife RACHEL], he smiles...she s carrying 
      bags to her car which is parked outside her house.                          Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 4.



      MICKEY gets out of cab, walks towards RACHEL;  Sensing 
      someone behind her, she turns;  Sees MICKEY, her face lights 
    up.

    She runs to him, they embrace, he strokes her hair, all his 
      senses, taking every part of her in.



      MICKEY still sitting in cab watching RACHEL load her car;

      A man appears, coming out of house behind her.  

      MICKEY leans back, the couple kiss, then get into car.  

      MICKEY looks down at slip of paper, screws it up and throws 
    it from window.     He nods at driver who watches him in rear 
      view mirror, the cab pulls away.



    Fat guy with moustache sitting in parked car eating huge 
      burger;

    He notices STACIE walking towards him - who wouldn t....

    As she gets level with car, she stops, bends down to look in 
      through passenger window and smiles.



    He hurriedly puts burger down and wipes stray piece of 
      lettuce from lap before hitting window button, it glides 
      down.

      STACIE bends to appear in window again.  She smiles.



    ASH MORGAN waits to cross busy road.



      Businessman in BMWdriving along High Street, mobile phone to 
    his ear.

      A bang.






                                                                            (CONTINUED)                          Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 5.

      SLOW MOas he looks to see ASH MORGAN fill his windscreen, 
      hovering slightly above at grotesque angle - blood spurts 
      from ASH s mouth hitting screen just in front of driver.

      Back to speed as ASH s body crashes on to bonnet, then rolls 
    off into road.    Businessman horrified.



    ASH lays seemingly unconscious in a heap in front of car, 
      blood seeping from mouth, his shopping scattered everywhere, 
      a crowd gathers.

    The driver gets out, sees him;   Distraught...



      Pick up MICKEY as he gets out of cab and pays driver, he sees 
      crowd gathered around front of BMW- driver being comforted;



    ASH laying in road, eyes closed, driver looking on horrified, 
      crowd gathered, chaos, a man switches off mobile beside ASH.

      MICKEY moves to front of crowd, looks down at ASH.

    ASH groans, coming round;

      Take ASH s POVas he slowly opens eyes; MICKEY looking down 
    at him; MICKEY smiles.

      ASH s eyes open wide.   He jumps to his feet;

                                  ASH
                    MICKEY!

    The crowd look on in absolute bewilderment as ASH embraces 
      MICKEY.

      Start music again; 

      Crowd watch in bemusement as ASH walks away with his arm 
      around MICKEY, he reaches into mouth with free hand and takes 
    out cackle-bladder, throwing it into waste bin as they go...

    OUT on crowd reactions;

      Fade music;                          Episode 1 - Green Pages   4.9.03   Page 6.

      STACIE turning heads as she walks out of hotel to find MICKEY

      They embrace, then part...she strokes his cheek tenderly;

    She steps back slightly and slaps him across the face;

                    Did I miss something?

      MICKEY nods.  STACIE smiles broadly;

      A Jag pulls up outside hotel, couple take case from boot.

    As porter takes cases, MICKEY steps forward and smiles at 
      driver.    

    The driver hands him the keys and a twenty pound note before

                    We ve got a positive ID.  He s a

                    We know he played a con three 
                    months ago, south of the river... 
                    But the mark withdrew his complaint 
                    and CPS wouldn t prosecute without

                    The mark bet his life savings in a 
                    horse racing scam, but his wife 
                    didn t know anything about it.  
                    I suppose he wanted to keep it that 
                    way.

                    Don t have anything in your life 
                    you can t walk away from in a 
                    second.  Lovers, friends..even your 
                    Mother...

                                  DANNY
                    What about your wife?

      MICKEY glares at him;

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                    I heard what happened.

                                  MICKEY
                          (glances at orange juice)
                    That was someone else.

      MICKEY looks away again.

                                  MICKEY (cont d)
                    Bad calls have a habit of coming 
                    back to haunt you.

                                  DANNY
                    Guess you loved her right?

                                  MICKEY
                    She wanted me to be something I 
                    wasn t, I wanted to please her.   
                    Recipe for disaster.

                                  DANNY
                    So if you were still together... 
                    Could you have walked away from 
                    her?

      MICKEY looks away, choosing not to answer;

      DANNY looks through window at others;

                                  DANNY (cont d)
                    Okay, what about them?

                                  MICKEY
                    First rule Danny.  Look after 
                    number one.  If you don t, no-one 
                    else will...

                                  DANNY
                    I ll try and remember that.

      MICKEY looks at him.

                                  MICKEY
                    I doubt it, but when the shithits 
                    the fan... As it surely will, 
                    remember you heard it here first...

                    Go home, get some sleep.

      MICKEY turns away to look over city again.   

      A beat, then DANNY goes back inside.

    OUT on MICKEY.
