"Rationality is overrated.  Particularly if you're a Cubs fan."

EXT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO CAMPUS - DAY

A crisp fall day.  Ivied walls.  Students hustling to class.

PIERCE (V.O.)
What is reality?

INT. CLASSROOM - UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - DAY

A few dozen college STUDENTS listen to an O.S. lecture.   

PIERCE (V.O.)
It s not a rhetorical question, 
people.

No slouching here, no doodling, no texting.  Whoever this guy 
is, these kids are into him, big time.       

PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
I m looking for answers.  Trust me.

Smiles, followed by A FEW HANDS shooting up.

PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
John Lennon.

A kid in John Lennon glasses responds:

JOHN LENNON
The observable universe?

PIERCE (V.O.)
Yeah, maybe that answer will fly in 
the physics department.  But this 
is neuroscience.  Anybody have the 
brains to give me an answer that 
relates to the brain?

Hands shoot up again.

PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
Ironic t-shirt.

A girl in the front row, in a tight t-shirt with the words 
 STIMULUS PACKAGE  printed over her ample chest, realizes 
Pierce is calling on her.  She smiles.

STIMULUS PACKAGE
Reality is exactly what we see and 
hear... instead of what we 
fantasize about... or dream... or 
you know, maybe hallucinate...

PIERCE (V.O.)
Ahhhh.  Hallucination.  Now that s   
an answer I would have expected 
from Mr. Lennon.

A few LAUGHS... and Pierce starts to SING:       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/092.    


PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
PICTURE YOURSELF IN A BOAT ON A 
RIVER...WITH TANGERINE TREES AND 
MARMALADE SKIES...

As the students start to laugh, we get our first look at 
GEOFFREY PIERCE -- M.D., Ph.D., 40s.  He s certainly not 
dressed like a rock star.  In rumpled sport jacket and nylon 
Nike runners circa 1982, he s handsome but dishevelled, 
endearingly and authentically off-kilter, and right now he s 
having a great time.  And hey, he s not a bad singer.

PIERCE (CONT D)
SOMEBODY CALLS YOU, YOU ANSWER 
QUITE SLOWLY... 
(to Stimulus Package)
A GIRL WITH KALEIDOSCOPE EYES...

The girl laughs, blushes.

PIERCE (CONT D)
CELLOPHANE FLOWERS OF YELLOW AND 
GREEN... TOWERING OVER YOUR HEAD... 
LOOK FOR THE GIRL WITH THE SUN IN 
HER EYES... AND SHE'S GONE...

In his own world now, Pierce slaps a drum solo on his podium 
and kicks into the chorus with gusto.

PIERCE (CONT D)
LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS,
LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS, 

CAMERA SPOTS MAX LEWICKI seated behind Pierce.  20 s, nine 
years of college, sixteen different majors, not a single 
degree.  Lewicki is a perpetual student, Pierce s T.A., and, 
as we ll discover his major d omo.  He CLEARS HIS THROAT.

LEWICKI
Professor... 

PIERCE
LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS! 
LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS! 

He rises, puts a hand on Pierce s shoulder.

LEWICKI
Professor.

This time Pierce snaps out of it.  His eyes focus on Lewicki 
for a brief moment, then back on the class... who 
spontaneously burst into good natured APPLAUSE and WHISTLING.  
A few of the kids even laughingly hold up their cell phones, 
calling for an encore.  Pierce finds a smile. 

PIERCE
Where were we?

LEWICKI
Reality.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/093.    


PIERCE
Right.  Reality.  Here s the thing, 
people.
(a long beat)
Reality is a figment of our 
imagination.

Reactions from the class.  Is this guy serious?

PIERCE (CONT D)
Is there anyone here who hasn t 
woken up breathless from a 
nightmare and thought,  Thank God, 
it was just a dream?   That s 
because sometimes the neuroelectric 
impulses fired when we re 
dreaming... or fantasizing... or 
even hallucinating... are 
indistinguishable from the ones 
banging around inside our skull 
when we actually experience those 
events.

A beat as he lets that hang there.

PIERCE (CONT D)
So.  Since what we perceive is 
often wrong... how can we ever know 
what s real and what isn t?

OFF that big question --

EXT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO CAMPUS - DAY

Pierce moves across the quad at a clip, oblivious to the path 
ahead.  Lewicki, with an armful of textbooks and newspapers, 
tries to keep up.  Lewicki makes Pierce nuts... or keeps him 
from going nuts.  Whichever it is, Pierce couldn t live 
without Lewicki.  But he d never admit it.

LEWICKI
Faculty meeting s at noon, book 
signing at two, so I ll pick you up 
one of those veggie wraps you like. 
You can scarf it down in between. 
You know how you get when you don t 
eat --

PIERCE
Lewicki.  

LEWICKI
Yeah?

PIERCE
Room and board in exchange for some 
light housekeeping does not make 
you my mother. 

LEWICKI
Just trying to look out for you, 
Doc.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/094.    


PIERCE
Do you have my puzzles?

As Lewicki fumbles with his stack of materials --

LEWICKI
Trib, Chronicle, Daily Mail --

STIMULUS PACKAGE (O.S.)
Professor Pierce?

They turn to see Stimulus Package and a FEMALE CLASSMATE 
catching up.  Stimulus Package smiles, flirty.

STIMULUS PACKAGE (CONT D)
I was wondering if I could buy you 
a latte.

And now we may notice something else about Pierce.  Unlike 
when he s in his classroom element, he s a little 
uncomfortable around people one-on-one and avoids making 
direct eye contact.  

PIERCE
I don t drink coffee.

STIMULUS PACKAGE
Oh.  Well, it doesn t have to be 
coffee.  I just want to, you 
know... pick your brain... about my 
thesis topic.

A beat.  Pierce forces himself to glance up at her.  

PIERCE
Here s the thing, Miss...?

STIMULUS PACKAGE
Karyn.

Pierce looks down again, takes a deep breath.  Though he is 
compulsively, brutally blunt, he s trying, without much 
success, to sound polite. 

PIERCE
 Discussing your thesis topic  is 
obviously code for sex.  And while 
we might both enjoy that very 
much... it could also get me fired.  
So I m going to regretfully decline 
your invitation.

And with that, Pierce walks away. 

FEMALE CLASSMATE
Pig.

CLASSICAL MUSIC takes us...

CLOSE ON A NEWSPAPER       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/095.    


Folded open to a half-finished CROSSWORD PUZZLE.  A pen flies 
across the page, filling in squares as fast as a human hand 
can write.  We are...

EXT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO CAMPUS - FOUNTAIN - DAY

...where Pierce sits on a bench, his right hand filling in 
the puzzle while his left  conducts  the symphony he s 
listening to through old school headphones... attached to a 
WALKMAN, that cassette-playing relic of the Reagan era.  
Pierce fills in the last square, slides another puzzle into 
his lap and goes to work on it without missing a beat.  

ROSSI (O.S.)
Geoffrey.

But he can t hear the voice.  A HAND taps Pierce on the 
shoulder.  Slightly startled, he looks up to see 

KATE ROSSI,

early 30s, sexy without trying, sharp-tongued, street smarts 
backed up by a first rate education.  Pierce recognizes her, 
takes off his headphones, says simply:

PIERCE
Kate Rossi.

ROSSI
You d be a lot easier to find if 
you carried a cell phone. 

PIERCE
If I carried a cell phone, the 
government could track me.

ROSSI
I am the government.

PIERCE
My point exactly.

She smiles, but he s not really joking.  As we ll come to 
learn, Pierce is also something of a conspiracy theorist. 

PIERCE (CONT D)
I thought you were at Quantico.

ROSSI
Got my old desk back.  

PIERCE
Isn t that a demotion?

Kate knows him well enough to understand he s not trying to 
be rude, just genuinely curious.  But she doesn t answer.

ROSSI
Do you have a few minutes?       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/096.    


CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH

of a DEAD MAN, 40s, eyes open, lying in a pool of BLOOD.

ROSSI (O.S.) (CONT D)
His name is Bob Weilman...

INT. PIERCE S OFFICE - DAY

A half-dozen CRIME SCENE PHOTOS are arranged on Pierce s 
desk.  The victim was apparently murdered in a posh study.

ROSSI
He is... was... the general counsel 
of Santech Pharmaceuticals.

Pierce picks up a photo of a large, heavy GOLD GOLF TROPHY 
spattered with blood and gray matter.

ROSSI (CONT D)
His skull was fractured in six 
places.  His wife confessed to 
detectives from Chicago homicide.

PIERCE
If the police have a confession, 
why am I looking at these pretty 
pictures?

ROSSI
The wife makes Nicole Richie look 
fat.  

PIERCE
Who?

Pierce looks up at her.  References to pop culture more 
recent than the 80s are lost on him.  Rossi explains:  

ROSSI
I think the wife may be anorexic, 
or bulimic.  She probably couldn t 
lift that trophy, never mind bash 
her husband over the head with it 
six times.  

PIERCE
You think her confession was 
coerced.

ROSSI
(nods)
She has a vacant affect, and if she 
does have an eating disorder, it 
could be a symptom of a more 
serious mental illness.

PIERCE
You always were one of my best 
students.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/097.    


Rossi smiles.  Then:

ROSSI
S.A.I.C. says you gave up the 
consulting gig.  Any particular 
reason? 

A beat.  Pierce shrugs.

PIERCE
When you left, the fun went out of 
it.

ROSSI
Well I m back.

Another beat as they eye each other.  A spark between them?  
If so, Pierce quickly deflects it.

PIERCE
New semester, book coming out, it s 
really not a good time.

ROSSI
Just talk to the wife.  One hour.

PIERCE
Why is the FBI involved in this 
case anyway?

ROSSI
A few months ago, Santech informed 
the Bureau that their top 
executives were receiving death 
threats calling the pharmaceutical 
industry part of a  vast public-
private conspiracy to poison the 
American people. 

PIERCE
Can t argue with that.

Rossi smiles to herself.  He hasn t changed.

PIERCE (CONT D)
So if the Bureau knew about the 
threats...

ROSSI
It was considered low priority.  
Resources are limited.

A beat as Pierce considers.

PIERCE
Not too limited, I hope.  Because I 
don t work cheap.

OFF Rossi s smile, PRELAP --       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/098.    


PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
Why did you kill your husband, Mrs. 
Weilman?

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CHICAGO PD - DAY

PAMELA WEILMAN, early 40 s, her thin face made even more 
gaunt by the harsh florescent lights, eyes red from crying, 
sits across from Pierce.

PAMELA WEILMAN
I don t know...

That s odd.  Pierce glances at a police file in front of him, 
then forces himself to look Pamela in the eye, empathetic:

PIERCE
You told the police you wanted the 
insurance money.

PAMELA WEILMAN
Yes, that s right.  The insurance 
money...

INTERCUT:

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Rossi and city homicide DETECTIVE WALTER HAMMOND, another 
kind of Chicago bull, watch through the one-way glass.

DETECTIVE HAMMOND
What is the point of this?

Rossi puts up a hand: just listen.  Hammond stews.  Pierce 
gently prods Pamela.

PIERCE
If you wanted to collect on the 
insurance, you would ve had to 
cover up your crime, maybe make it 
look as though someone else killed 
your husband.  Why didn t you?

She looks at him, confused, unsure.

PAMELA WEILMAN
I guess I didn t think it 
through...

Pierce studies her demeanor.

PIERCE
When did you and your husband buy 
this policy?

PAMELA WEILMAN
I don t remember.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/099.    


PIERCE
Was it last Thursday?  You met your 
husband for lunch, then you both 
went to the insurance company 
offices, signed the papers?  

She considers for a beat.  Then:

PAMELA WEILMAN
Yes.  That s right.

Behind the glass, Hammond and Rossi exchange a glance: what 
the hell is he up to?

PIERCE
Two days ago, when you went out for 
a walk, did you find a stray 
kitten?  You took her home, and 
named her Millie?  

A beat, and then Pamela brightens suddenly.

PAMELA WEILMAN
How did you know about Millie...?

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

Pierce strides in from the interrogation room.

PIERCE
She s innocent.  

DETECTIVE HAMMOND
What the hell are you talking 
about?  She signed a confession. 

PIERCE
Because she s suffering from 
Korsakoff s Syndrome.

DETECTIVE HAMMOND
Korsa-what?

PIERCE
A neurological disorder 
characterized by anterograde 
amnesia, extreme susceptibility to 
suggestion, and confabulation.  I 
tell her she has a cat named 
Millie, she remembers having a cat 
named Millie.  You tell her she 
bashed her husband over the head 
with a golf trophy, and she 
remembers that.  But there s no cat 
-- I made that up -- just like you 
made up a story about a murder plot 
to collect life insurance.  That s 
a bit of a clich , isn t it, 
Detective?

With that, Pierce exits into --         PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0910.    


INT. PRECINCT BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

Hammond catches up, followed by Rossi.

DETECTIVE HAMMOND
Now hold on just a goddamn second.  
We ran a background, found out 
about the policy, and asked her 
about it.  You act like I beat it 
out of her with a rubber tube.  

PIERCE
Either way, it s a false 
confession.  She doesn t belong in 
jail, she belongs in a hospital.

DETECTIVE HAMMOND
This is crazy!

But Pierce is done.  And he doesn t like being in a noisy 
police station.  So he turns to Rossi.

PIERCE
Can we go now?

ROSSI
Give me a minute?

Pierce sighs, nods, moves off.

ROSSI (CONT D)
I m going to recommend that Mrs. 
Weilman be released and transferred 
to a psychiatric unit for further 
evaluation.

Hammond eyes her, fuming.

DETECTIVE HAMMOND
My lieutenant warned me about you.  
Said you used to come in here 
flashing your FBI badge, jacking 
our cases.  And now you re screwing 
with mine just because this nutjob 
makes a five minute diagnosis?

ROSSI
He s not a nutjob, Detective 
Hammond.  He literally wrote the 
book on forensic neuropsychiatry.  
Four of them actually.

But something has caught Hammond s attention.

DETECTIVE HAMMOND
Not a nutjob, huh?

Rossi follows Hammond s gaze to see 

PIERCE, STANDING ON TOP OF A CHAIR,        PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0911.    


headphones on, passionately  conducting  with a pen.

ROSSI
Okay, so he s a little eccentric.  

EXT. SANTECH HEADQUARTERS - DAY

The glass and steel nerve center of Big Pharma. 

INT. SANTECH HEADQUARTERS - CEO S OFFICE - DAY

Kate sits across from Santech CEO ARTHUR KLANE -- 40 s, fit, 
confident -- and a less affable company attorney, ALAN DIRK, 
40 s, who eyes Rossi with poorly concealed contempt.

DIRK
It takes one of us turning up dead 
to get the FBI s interest?

KLANE
You ll have to forgive Alan, Agent 
Rossi.  He and Bob were very close.  

ROSSI
(to Dirk)
Mr. Weilman was your boss in the 
legal department.

DIRK
And my friend.

ROSSI
And now that he s gone, you ll be 
getting his job?

DIRK
What are you implying?

ROSSI
Nothing at all.  I just need access 
to any litigation against Santech 
over the past five years.  

DIRK
Do you have any idea how many 
frivolous claims a company like 
ours has to deal with?

ROSSI
I can imagine.  But often death 
threats are an escalation, after 
someone s tried other means of 
getting satisfaction.  We may be 
able to connect the threats to 
someone who brought a suit against 
the company.
(to Klane)
I d also like a list of Mr. 
Weilman s current and former 
colleagues, subordinates.  Anybody 
he came in contact with.        PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0912.    


KLANE
Alan will get you everything you 
need.

OFF Dirk, not happy about it --

CLOSE ON A MONITOR

displaying a colorful PET scan of Pamela Weilman s brain.  

DOCTOR KAPOOR (O.S.)
Damage to the medial thalamus...

INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO HOSPITAL - PSYCH WARD - DAY

Pierce is with neurologist DOCTOR NAREN KAPOOR, 30 s, really 
into his job, and almost worshipful of Pierce. 

DOCTOR KAPOOR (CONT D)
...bleeding in the mammillary 
bodies, generalized cerebral 
atrophy.

Pierce studies the scan, nods.  

PIERCE
All of which would result from an 
extreme thiamine deficiency...

DOCTOR KAPOOR
...and manifest as Korsakoff s.  
The great Geoffrey Pierce strikes 
again.

PIERCE
The question is, how did she lose 
so much thiamine?

OFF Kapoor, PRELAP:

JOLIE WEILMAN S VOICE (V.O.)
Drink?  My mother? 

INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY

Pierce talks to JOLIE WEILMAN -- 15, also very thin, trying 
to bury grief and confusion beneath angry sarcasm.   

JOLIE WEILMAN
She never does anything that might 
actually be fun. 

PIERCE
How about her eating habits? 

JOLIE WEILMAN
Why are you asking me all this?

PIERCE
Your mom s condition was caused by 
a thiamine deficiency.  
(MORE)       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0913.    

PIERCE (CONT'D)
That can happen when somebody 
drinks too much.  
(pointed)
Or throws up a lot.   

JOLIE WEILMAN
(cynical)
Oh, right.  Because anyone as thin 
as me or my mom must be puking up 
dinner.  I get that all the time.  

Jolie lifts her troubled gaze to an INTERIOR WINDOW where 
they see Pamela Weilman in her room, hooked to IVs.

JOLIE WEILMAN (CONT D)
But some bitches are just skinny.  

A beat as Pierce contemplates that mystery -- if it s not 
bulimia, then what else could it be?  Jolie eyes her mother.

JOLIE WEILMAN (CONT D)
You re sure she didn t kill my 
father?

PIERCE
Aren t you?

JOLIE WEILMAN
(shrugs)
He walked all over her.  Maybe she 
finally, you know, snapped.

PIERCE
(intrigued)
Did you ever see her  snap? 

JOLIE WEILMAN
She just took it.  Wouldn t even 
stand up to him when he hassled me.

PIERCE
What did he hassle you about?

JOLIE WEILMAN
Whatever.  My grades.  My friends.    
He grounded me for a month because 
he thought I dented his precious T-
bird.  Of course he assumes right 
away it s me, and she lies and 
tells him he s right, even though 
it was her that drove the car. 

Pierce registers this a beat.

PIERCE
Your mother didn t lie on purpose.

JOLIE WEILMAN
What are you talking about?       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0914.    


PIERCE
Her condition makes her very 
suggestible.  If she heard your 
father accuse you of crashing the 
car, then her brain would do what 
we call confabulate... and she d 
remember that as what actually 
happened. 

Jolie processes this, looks in at her mom, hooked to all 
those tubes and is struck by something.  A pang of guilt?

JOLIE WEILMAN
I got so mad...  I told her I hated 
her as much as I hated him... 

As Pierce tries to get a read on Jolie, Rossi APPROACHES with 
another FBI AGENT -- ROGER PROBERT, 30s -- the kind of guy 
who probably has his underwear starched.  

ROSSI
Got a few more minutes?

INT. PIERCE S OFFICE - DAY

A dozen or so EMAIL PRINTOUTS are being examined by Pierce, 
standing over his desk.  Kate and Agent Probert are here.

PIERCE
Don t you have experts to trace 
these?

AGENT PROBERT
We re trying.  But the messages 
were routed through servers all 
over the world.  Whoever sent them 
knows how to cover his tracks.

ROSSI
Anything you could tell us about 
the psychology of the letter writer 
would help.

PIERCE
(reading)
 You scum need a hearty 
reminder...   Not very poetic.   
 The pharmaceutical industry and 
the FDA are conspiring to keep the 
American people sick...   Well, 
that part s certainly true.  

AGENT PROBERT
(to Rossi)
Is he serious?

PIERCE
Restless leg syndrome?  You don t 
think that s an invention of the 
drug companies to sell more pills?         PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0915.    


Rossi and Probert exchange a glance as Pierce intently looks 
from one printout to another.  

PIERCE (CONT D)
 Scum need a hearty reminder,  it s 
repeated in each of the emails.

ROSSI
You think it means something?

But Pierce is too absorbed in his reading to respond.  And as 
he concentrates, CAMERA PUSHES INTO AN ECU of his eyes.

PIERCE S POV

The letters of the phrase  scum need a hearty reminder  LIFT 
OFF THE PAGE and begin to SWIRL, ORDERING and REORDERING 
themselves.  This is not a superpower, just a stylized 
visualization of how Pierce s mind works, how he solves 
puzzles by searching for patterns and connections.  Without 
taking his eyes off the page --

PIERCE
I need a pen.

Probert hands him one... and Pierce begins to write a new 
phrase formed by the same letters contained in the original: 

PIERCE (CONT D)
 Santech... murdered... Irene... 
May. 

ROSSI
It s an anagram...

She looks from the words to Pierce, amazed.  But Probert 
remains skeptical.

AGENT PROBERT
Some domestic terrorist goes to all 
this trouble to disguise the source 
of his emails, then gives us a 
name?  Why would he do that?

Rossi is already typing on her laptop.

ROSSI
Some paranoids seesaw between 
extreme self-loathing and delusions 
of grandeur.  He s trying to prove 
he s smarter than we are.

PIERCE
Very good, Agent Rossi.

ROSSI
(off computer)
May v. Santech.  Dismissed in 
summary judgement...  

Probert eyes Pierce.  Holy shit.  Pierce just shrugs.        PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0916.    


ROSSI (CONT D)

of his mother Irene.  I ve got an 
address.  
(looking up to Pierce)
Want to take a ride? 

PIERCE
Yesterday you said this was going 
to take an hour.

ROSSI
Come on, Professor.  You know you 
can t resist a puzzle.  And this 
one is way more interesting than a 
word jumble. 

OFF Pierce, getting sucked in --

EXT. RUN-DOWN APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

An N.D. GOVERNMENT SEDAN pulls up to the curb.

INT. N.D. GOVERNMENT SEDAN - SAME

Probert drives, Rossi turns to Pierce who s in the back seat.

ROSSI
Stay here.  Once it s clear, you 
can come up and take a look around.

Pierce gazes out at the sketchy neighborhood, HONKING horns, 
a distant CAR ALARM.  He puts his headphones on.  As he takes 
out a book of Sodoku puzzles, PRELAP:

ROSSI (V.O.) (CONT D)
Mr. May...

INT. RUN DOWN APARTMENT BUILDING   HALLWAY - DAY

Flanked by Probert and the BUILDING MANAGER, Rossi knocks on 
the DOOR of a second-story unit.  

ROSSI
...FBI.  We d like to talk to you.

No answer.  She flashes a WARRANT at the manager.

ROSSI (CONT D)
Open it.

INT. RUN-DOWN APARTMENT - DAY

Kate and Probert cautiously enter.

ROSSI
Mr. May?  

But there s no one here.  Shabby furniture, empty Chinese 
food containers.  Probert picks up a book -- Dance with the 
 shows it to Rossi. Devil: The AIDS Conspiracy,       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0917.    


AGENT PROBERT
Belongs to the same book club as 
your buddy Pierce.

Kate gives him a look, pushes open the door to the 
BATHROOM...just in time to see a shabbily-dressed man, 30s, 
crawling out the window onto the FIRE ESCAPE.  This is 
TIMOTHY MAY.  Kate aims her SIDEARM.

ROSSI
FBI! Stop!

But May pulls himself out onto --

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - SECOND STORY - DAY

He grabs onto the telescoping LADDER, SLAMS the latch, hangs 
on as it RATCHETS DOWN, drops the last foot, stumbles, falls.

ABOVE HIM

Kate is now out on the landing and sees May scrambling to his 
feet, getting ready to run.  And she realizes there s only 
one way to close the distance -- she LEAPS off the balcony!  

IN THE N.D SEDAN

Pierce sees Kate hurtle out of the sky and SLAM Timothy hard 
to the ground.  What the fuck?   He scrambles out of the car, 
hurries over to where Kate is now cuffing her suspect, pulls 
off his headphones. 

PIERCE
Are you alright?

ROSSI
Fine.

PIERCE
If you want my professional 
diagnosis, jumping off a second 
story fire escape is what we 
commonly call  crazy. 

Kate hauls the suspect to his feet, smiles at Pierce.

ROSSI
I guess that makes two of us.

OFF Pierce --


END OF ACT ONE       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0918.    


ACT TWO

INT. FBI CHICAGO FIELD OFFICE - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Rossi sits across from a frightened Timothy May, some files 
on the table between them.  Pierce keeps his distance, 
standing in the corner, observing.  

TIMOTHY
It s not against the law to send 
emails.

ROSSI
It s against the law to make 
terrorist threats.  And murder is 
kind of a no-no too.

TIMOTHY
I didn t kill anyone.

ROSSI
Then I ll ask you again, where were 
you the night Bob Weilman died?

Timothy tries to put up a tough front.

TIMOTHY
You think I m going to cooperate 
with the Beast better known as the 
United States federal government?

Pierce abruptly chimes in.  He does this sometimes.

PIERCE
Herbal tea.  

ROSSI
What?

PIERCE
No milk.  No sugar.

A beat.  Rossi realizes he wants a shot alone with the 
suspect.  As she exits, Pierce explains to Timothy:

PIERCE (CONT D)
Processed sugar is an addictive 
drug peddled by Big Agribusiness, 
in order to promote an epidemic in 
type-two diabetes.  Then their 
cohorts in Big Pharma reap billions 
marketing treatments.  Don t even 
get me started on why they put the 
hormones in the milk.

May eyes Pierce.  Is this guy putting him on... or is he a 
kindred spirit?

INTERCUT:       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0919.    


INT. FBI CFO - OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Agent Probert is watching the interrogation on a closed 
circuit MONITOR.  Kate ENTERS.

PIERCE  (ON MONITOR) 
Just so you know, I m not a Fed.  

TIMOTHY (ON MONITOR)
Then what are you doing here?

PIERCE
(shrugs)
I m a college professor.  Teaching 
doesn t pay very well.  In exchange 
for my  expert opinion , I bill the 
Beast for my time and get some 
material for my research.  I admit 
it s kind of a deal with the devil.  
But, hey, if they re going to bleed 
me with taxes anyway, I might as 
well get a little of it back.

Seeing that Timothy is softening, Pierce picks up a file.

PIERCE (CONT D)
Your mother had type-two diabetes, 
didn t she?

TIMOTHY
She was always sending me out to 
pick her up soda, candy, ice cream.  
(racked with guilt)
I shoulda told her no...

PIERCE
She was your mother.  You wanted to 
make her happy.  And you tried to 
get her help.  That s why you 
signed her up for a drug trial.

TIMOTHY
Santech s new wonder pill.  
Insulprin.  They said it would cure 
her.  Instead, she dropped dead of 
a heart attack.  

PIERCE
You think the drug killed her.

TIMOTHY
It s poison...

Pierce takes a seat across from Timothy, forces himself to 
look the agitated man in the eye, sympathetic.

PIERCE
But the big lawyers at Santech got 
your suit thrown out.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0920.    


TIMOTHY
Said it was  frivolous.   Bastards 
wouldn t even pay for her funeral.

PIERCE
That must ve made you pretty 
angry...

TIMOTHY
You got no idea.

PIERCE
(gently)
Angry enough to kill Bob Weilman?

Timothy looks up at Pierce, tears in his eyes.

TIMOTHY
Look at me, Mister.  You really 
think I got it in me to cave some 
guy s head in?

OFF this, PRELAP:

ROSSI (V.O.)
I ll drop you back at campus. 

INT. FBI CFO - BULLPEN - LATER

Pierce, Rossi, and Probert on the move.

PIERCE
What about the case?

ROSSI
You helped us solve it.  Thank you.

PIERCE
You don t actually believe Timothy 
May killed anyone.

ROSSI
No.  Paranoid, not violent, I 
agree.  And we have no physical 
evidence connecting him to the 
crime scene. 

PIERCE
I m told I can be a little absent-
minded, so maybe I m missing 
something here. 

ROSSI
We were assigned to investigate 
terrorist threats.  We have the man 
who made those threats in custody. 

PIERCE
But there was a murder.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0921.    


AGENT PROBERT
Local police matter.

As Probert moves off, Pierce gets in front of Rossi. 

PIERCE
You dangle a puzzle in front me, 
goad me into helping you solve it, 
and now you expect me to just drop 
it before all the squares are 
filled in?

A beat.  Rossi looks around, keeps her voice low, explains:

ROSSI
You were right.  My transfer back 
to Chicago was a demotion.  

PIERCE
What did you do?  Leap off one too 
many tall buildings in pursuit of 
fleeing suspects?

ROSSI
The Deputy Director said I had a 
tendency to  go beyond the scope of 
my assigned investigations. 

Another beat.  Pierce eyes her.

PIERCE
I remember I once assigned you a 
five page psychiatric eval.  You 
turned in an exhaustive thirty page 
life history of the test subject.  
(beat)
You can try to be a good little 
bureaucrat, deny your impulses, but 
you know you re as incapable of 
letting this go as I am.  

OFF Rossi, realizing Pierce is right.  She can t drop it --

ROSSI (V.O.)
Thank you for seeing us, Dr. 
Bryant.

INT. SANTECH HEADQUARTERS - LAB - INNER OFFICE - DAY

Pierce and Rossi are seated across from DR. GILES BRYANT, 
50s, distinguished, Santech s head of product development.   
Dirk, the company lawyer is also here, keeping tabs.  Through 
an INTERIOR WINDOW is a view of RESEARCHERS working in a lab.

BRYANT
I m not sure I ll be much help.  I 
didn t know Bob well.  Lab rats 
don t mix much with the lawyers.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0922.    


ROSSI
We ve been talking to everyone Mr. 
Weilman had contact with -- 
friends, associates here at 
Santech.  I understand he d 
occasionally ask for your input on 
litigation against the company.

BRYANT
Sure.  He d want me or one of my 
people to review briefs and such, 
for scientific accuracy.

Pierce does that thing again -- he abruptly chimes in:

PIERCE
Does your new blockbuster drug 
Insulprin cause heart attacks?

DIRK
How is this relevant?

Rossi eyes Pierce: what the hell is he up to?

ROSSI
It isn t.  

BRYANT
That s okay.  I m happy to answer.  
Insulprin has been rigorously 
tested for over five years.  Side 
effects are minimal and subjects 
taking the drug were certainly no 
more likely to have heart attacks 
than the control group.  We re very 
proud of Insulprin here.  It s 
going to save a lot of lives.  

PIERCE
And earn billions of dollars.

DIRK
What does any of this have to do 
with Bob Weilman s murder?

PIERCE
There was a lawsuit filed against 
the company by a man claiming his 
mother s coronary was caused by 
Insulprin.  May v. Santech?

DIRK
I remember that suit.  It was 
dismissed in summary judgement.

Bryant chuckles.

PIERCE
Something funny?       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0923.    


BRYANT
Sad actually.  I remember it too 
because it turned out this May  
woman was in the placebo group.  
She wasn t even taking the drug.

But Pierce doesn t respond... because he has momentarily lost 
focus.  Through the window, he s noticed

A DARK-HAIRED MAN,

a lab researcher staring at him.  Realizing Pierce has 
spotted him, the man quickly looks away.  

ROSSI
Geoffrey?

PIERCE
Yes...?

DIRK
(annoyed)
Are we done here? 

OFF Pierce, PRELAP: 

ROSSI (V.O.)
What was that all about? 

INT. SANTECH HEADQUARTERS - LAB - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Pierce and Rossi are heading for the exit.

PIERCE
I m a concerned consumer.

ROSSI
Geoffrey, I appreciate your maybe 
not-so-healthy distrust of large 
institutions, but how about we put 
aside your conspiracy theories and 
focus on finding the killer.

Before he can respond, she notices something:

ROSSI (CONT D)
Hammond...

And indeed Hammond -- the Chicago PD cop we met earlier -- is 
approaching with his PARTNER.  But he doesn t acknowledge 
Rossi.  Instead, he calls out:

DETECTIVE HAMMOND
I m looking for a Miss Valerie 
Nelson.

A PRETTY BRUNETTE, 20s, steps forward from a work station.

VALERIE NELSON
I m... I m Valerie Nelson.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0924.    


DETECTIVE HAMMOND
(badging her)
I d like to have a word with you. 

ROSSI
(to Hammond)
What s this about?

DETECTIVE HAMMOND
Seems Pamela Weilman had another 
motive for killing her husband.  
According to his phone records, he 
was making a lot of late night 
calls...
(smiles, re: Valerie)
...to a pretty young co-worker.

OFF Rossi --

CLOSE ON A TV MONITOR

a tearful Valerie Nelson in a police interrogation room.

VALERIE NELSON (ON TV)
We met at the Christmas party...

INT. PIERCE S OFFICE - NIGHT

Pierce and Kate are watching Valerie s recorded interview.

VALERIE NELSON (ON TV, CONT D)
...one thing led to another.... We 
started spending a lot of time 
together.  I knew it was wrong... 
but I fell in love with him...

DETECTIVE HAMMOND (V.O.)
Where you were the night of 
September third?

VALERIE NELSON (ON TV)
Home, waiting for Bob to call... it 
was the night he was going to tell 
Pamela he was leaving.
(breaking down)
I guess she didn t take it so 
well...

Kate STOPS the recording.

ROSSI
Maybe the wife is guilty.  

PIERCE
She only confessed because she s 
neurologically impaired.

ROSSI
Neurological impairment and murder 
aren t mutually exclusive.  
(MORE)       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0925.    

ROSSI (CONT'D)
One of her symptoms is anterograde 
amnesia, right?
(off his nod)
So her husband comes home, tells 
her he s leaving her for a hottie 
from the office, she goes into an 
adrenaline-fueled rage and kills 
him.  But because of the 
Korsakoff s, by the time the police 
get there, she s forgotten why she 
killed the guy.

Pierce picks up the thread, enjoying the back and forth.

PIERCE
And when the detective suggests she 
did it for the insurance money, 
that s how she remembers it.  
(beat)
Impressive theory...

Rossi can t resist a small smile.  Part of her is still the 
student seeking the approbation of her professor.

PIERCE (CONT'D)
...but wrong.  Pamela Weilman isn t 
a killer.  She s a victim.  First 
she s bullied by a philandering 
husband... and now an overzealous 
cop is trying to put her in jail.  
Typical of how the mentally ill are 
treated by our so-called  justice  
system.

Rossi sighs, stretches.

ROSSI
Well, I m stuck.  And there s only 
one thing I know of that s going to 
get me unstuck.  Burger grease.  

PIERCE
Cholesterol is a silent killer.

ROSSI
What are you going to tell me now? 
That the fry cooks at the Billy 
Goat are in league with the drug 
companies to sell more heart 
medicine?

PIERCE
It s your funeral.

ROSSI
You ll have the garden burger.  I m 
buying.  Let s go.

A beat.  Pierce realizes she s inviting him to dinner.  And 
it makes him uncomfortable.         PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0926.    


PIERCE
Oh, no... I... I can t... I have an 
appointment.

OFF Rossi, maybe a little disappointed, PRELAP --

NATALIE (V.O.)
Why didn t you say yes?

INT. PIERCE S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Pierce is sitting on the couch with NATALIE VINCENT -- late 
30s, beautiful, witty, Pierce s best friend and intellectual 
equal.  But at the moment, they re not discussing Jungian 
theory... they re watching the CUBS GAME.

PIERCE
Because I had a date with you.

She smiles.  This is something they enjoy bantering about. 

NATALIE
Geoffrey, you haven t had a date 
with me since grad school.  

She pats him on the knee with mock sympathy.

NATALIE (CONT D)
I think it s time to move on.  

PIERCE
Admit it: I m wearing you down.

Natalie laughs.  A beat as they watch the game.

NATALIE
How are you feeling?

PIERCE
Fine.  Why?

NATALIE
This consulting work, it can 
disrupt your routine.  And we both 
know how you get when you don t 
stick to your routine.

PIERCE
That s what I have Lewicki for.  He 
keeps me organized.   

NATALIE
What are you going to do when he 
graduates?  

PIERCE
Do you know have any idea how often 
Lewicki changes majors?  I don t 
think there s much danger of 
graduation.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0927.    


Pierce CHEERS as the Cubs score a run. 

PIERCE (CONT D)
You see that?  This is the year.

NATALIE
Believing the Cubs will win the 
pennant is the symptom of a 
delusional mind.

PIERCE
Rationality is overrated.  
Particularly if you re a Cubs fan.

NATALIE
(smiles, rises)
I have to go.  I have a class in 
the morning and so do you. 

PIERCE
What about the game?

She kisses him on the cheek, heads for the door.

NATALIE
I think we both know how that s 
going to turn out.

And as she exits, PRELAP:

TV ANNOUNCER S VOICE
Our final score: Phillies seven, 
Cubs six.

INT. PIERCE S LIVING ROOM - LATER

TV ANNOUNCER
We ll be right back with our post-
game wrap up --

Exasperated, Pierce turns off the TV.  

PIERCE
Sadists.

The DOORBELL RINGS.

PIERCE (CONT D)
Lewicki!

No response.  The bell RINGS again.  Pierce sighs, annoyed.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

Pierce cautiously opens the door as far as the chain will 
allow.  On the porch is

THE DARK-HAIRED MAN

from the Santech lab.  He looks nervous and scared.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0928.    


DARK-HAIRED MAN
Doctor Pierce... I m so sorry to 
bother you at home. 

Pierce is wary of strangers, but he recognizes this man.  

PIERCE
You work at Santech.

DARK-HAIRED MAN
(nods)
I couldn t talk to you in front of 
everyone.  My name is Gerard 
Permut.  

PIERCE
What can I do for you, Mr. Permut?

DARK-HAIRED MAN
I have information... about Bob 
Weilman s murder.  

That gets Pierce s attention.  But still, he s careful.

PIERCE
You should go to the FBI --

DARK-HAIRED MAN
No, I can t trust them.  But I ve 
read your books, I know that you 
understand... people like me.
(tears in his eyes)
Please... I don t know who else to 
turn to...

A beat.  And that pang of empathy kicks in.  Pierce closes 
the door, and undoes the chain, lets the man in.

PIERCE
Would you like to sit down?

But the Dark-Haired man can t stay still.

DARK-HAIRED MAN
I didn t mean to do it...  

PIERCE
Do what?

DARK-HAIRED MAN
But the voices kept telling me I 
had to...

Pierce reacts to that, starting to see where this is going. 

PIERCE
What did the voices tell you?       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0929.    


DARK-HAIRED MAN
I m in love with Valerie Nelson... 
but I found out she was sleeping 
with Bob Weilman...

The Dark-Haired Man eyes Pierce, anguished.

DARK-HAIRED MAN (CONT D)
The voices told me the pain would 
go away... if I killed him...

He breaks down sobbing, sinks to his knees against the wall, 
head in his hands.  Pierce puts a sympathetic hand on the 
man s shoulder. 

PIERCE
It s all right.  I m going to get 
you some help --

DARK-HAIRED MAN
She told me we had a future 
together....  But I never should 
have trusted her...

The man looks up, tears streaking his face, devastated, 
betrayed.

DARK-HAIRED MAN (CONT D)
She s a liar...

Seeing how much pain the man is in, Pierce wants to reassure 
him... but he also knows he needs help dealing with this. 

PIERCE
Lewicki!  Can you come down here 
please?

DARK-HAIRED MAN
(nervous)
Who are you calling? 

PIERCE
It s all right.  He works for me.  
We re going to help you, okay?

Seeing that Pierce is sincere, the Man nods through his tears 
as Lewicki comes trotting down the stairs holding a glowing 
WII LIGHT SABER CONTROL.

LEWICKI
You need something, Doc?  I m right 
in the middle of kicking Obi-Wan s 
Jedi ass.

Annoyed at Lewicki s attitude, Pierce crosses to him, keeping 
his voice low and dry.

LEWICKI (CONT D)
Sorry to call you away from 
something so urgent.  But as you 
can see, I ve got a situation here.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0930.    


Lewicki looks past Pierce to see what he s talking about.  
And something in Lewicki s reaction gives Pierce a 
realization.  A long beat.  And then:  

PIERCE
There s nobody else in this room, 
is there?

Lewicki eyes Pierce with empathy.  He gets it.  This sort of 
thing happens.  

LEWICKI
No, Doc.  It s just you and me. 

As that sinks in,

WIDER TO REVEAL

that Pierce and Lewicki are indeed completely alone in the 
cavernous hallway.  And now we realize what Pierce himself 
has just deduced:  

THE DARK-HAIRED MAN IS AN HALLUCINATION. 

But even now that Pierce knows it s not real, when he looks 
back, the Man is still there.  Only now, the tears are gone. 
Instead, he s smiling mischievously: 

DARK-HAIRED MAN
Almost had you.

OFF Pierce --

SMASH TO BLACK.


END OF ACT TWO       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0931.    


ACT THREE

INT. PIERCE S HOUSE - MORNING

CLASSICAL MUSIC OVER A SERIES OF CUTS as Lewicki puts 
Pierce s life in order: he picks up RUMPLED CLOTHES discarded 
absently the night before, shoves them in a hamper; collects 
SCATTERED NEWSPAPERS; closes OPEN TEXTBOOKS, puts them back 
on a shelf; lays out NEATLY FOLDED CLOTHES on Pierce s bed; 
squeezes A PERFECT LINE OF TOOTHPASTE onto a toothbrush, sets 
it on a washcloth; slices fruit into SYMMETRICAL WEDGES; 
carefully folds a newspaper to the CROSSWORD, and as he sets 
it down with a PEN next to the PLATE OF FRUIT, WIDER: 

INT. PIERCE S KITCHEN - DAY

Pierce sits, headphones on, one hand flying across the 
puzzle, the other  conducting  the music we ve been hearing.   
The slices of fruit sit untouched in front of him.  

LEWICKI (O.S.)
Doc.

No response.  Lewicki gently shakes his shoulder.

LEWICKI (CONT D)
Doc.  You have to eat.

Pierce comes out of his reverie, CLICKS STOP on the Walkman, 
holds it up to Lewicki, annoyed: 

PIERCE
This is the Von Karajan recording.   
I asked you for the Solti.

LEWICKI
Do you know how hard it is to find 
cassette tapes?  If you just let me 
buy you an iPod, we can download 
any recording you want.

VOICE (O.S.)
That s a good idea.

Pierce looks to see the Dark-Haired Man sitting across from 
him, leaning back in a chair, feet up on the table.  

DARK-HAIRED MAN
You need to get with the program.

PIERCE
Stay out of this.

Looking from Pierce to the empty chair across from him, 
Lewicki gets excited.  

LEWICKI
He s here?

Pierce doesn t answer.  But Lewicki has a theory:       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0932.    


LEWICKI (CONT D)
You know, Doc.  Maybe this guy 
isn t just a hallucination.

Pierce rolls his eyes: Here we go again.

LEWICKI (CONT D)
Maybe he s some kind of psychic 
vision.  There have been studies --

PIERCE
No, Lewicki, there have been no 
studies.  There have been frauds 
and scams and entertainments --

The phone RINGS, but Lewicki ignores it.

LEWICKI
You said this vision told you he 
was jealous of the dead guy.  Maybe 
there really is some kind of 
twisted love triangle... 

PIERCE 
(exasperated)
How long have you been working for 
me?

LEWICKI
Four most interesting years of my 
life.

PIERCE
And you think you re suddenly going 
to convince me my disease is some 
sort of supernatural gift?

DARK-HAIRED MAN
Why do you keep this idiot around 
anyway?  

PIERCE
Because when jerks like you show 
up, I need somebody to tell me 
they re not real. 

LEWICKI
(fascinated)
What s he saying?

But Pierce is done.  And the ringing phone is getting to him.

PIERCE
Answer that!

Lewicki sighs, picks up the phone.

LEWICKI
Doctor Pierce s residence.
(listens a beat)
Yes, I ll tell him.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0933.    


Lewicki hangs up the phone.

LEWICKI (CONT D)
Dean Harper wants to see you.

OFF Pierce, PRELAP:

HARPER (V.O.)
What in God s name were you 
thinking, Geoffrey?

INT. DEAN S OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE ON Dean of the Faculty, PAUL HARPER, 40s, African-
American, artful and affable, but at the moment, not happy. 

PIERCE
I ll tell you exactly what I was 
thinking, Paul.  I was thinking, 
this pheromone-spewing twenty-year 
old has been making eyes at me from 
the front row of my class three 
semesters running, now she s 
inviting me for  a latte,  and, oh 
by the way, she s sticking a skin-
tight t-shirt in my face that 
advertises herself as a  Stimulus 
Package.   

HARPER
You can t just go around accusing 
students of wanting to have sex 
with you.  Especially not in front 
of witnesses.  

PIERCE
What witnesses?

HARPER
Are you really that oblivious?  She 
was with a friend when she 
approached you on the quad.  That s 
who made the complaint.

PIERCE
This is a joke, right?

HARPER
Geoffrey, I put up with your 
eccentricities because you re a 
brilliant scholar, a popular 
teacher, and my friend.  But do you 
have any idea what kind of hit our 
endowment has taken?  We can t 
afford a lawsuit.

PIERCE
What are you asking me to do?

OFF the question --       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0934.    


INT. PIERCE S OFFICE - DAY

Pierce is pacing, furious, venting to Natalie.

PIERCE
He wants me to apologize.  To both 
girls.  It s outrageous.
(off Natalie s laugh)
You think this is funny?

NATALIE
You know what I think?  I think you 
deflected the offer from this 
student for the same reason you 
turned down Kate Rossi s dinner 
invitation.  You re scared of 
anything remotely resembling an 
intimate connection with another 
human being.  

PIERCE
Spare me the psychobabble.

NATALIE
Tell me I m wrong.

But Pierce can t.  A long beat.  Finally, he gives her a 
resigned smile, matter-of-fact:    

PIERCE
Look at me, Natalie.  I hear 
voices.  See things that aren t 
there.  Talk to the walls.  How 
could I ever have  an intimate 
connection  with anybody?  

Natalie intuitively gets it:

NATALIE
You had an incident.

He nods.  She eyes him.

NATALIE (CONT D)
But you got it under control.

Again he nods.  She studies him, curious.

NATALIE (CONT D)
This is nothing new.  It happens 
sometimes, you deal with it, and 
you move on.  So why do I get the 
feeling you re more worried about 
it than usual?

A beat.

PIERCE
What if next time it happens in 
front of Kate?        PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0935.    


NATALIE
You told her about your condition a 
long time ago.

PIERCE
Knowing and seeing are two 
different things.

NATALIE
And if she did see?  What s the 
worst thing that could happen?   

PIERCE
She d start to pity me.  I couldn t 
take that.

NATALIE
So how do you plan to avoid it?

PIERCE
Maybe I need to get off the case.

But Natalie knows him too well.

NATALIE
Quit without solving it?  Then 
you ll really go crazy.

Pierce can t help but smile.  

NATALIE (CONT D)
Have you talked to Blumenthal about 
going back on the meds?

PIERCE
For some people they re a miracle.  
Not for me.    

NATALIE
You did have fewer symptoms.

PIERCE
And I couldn t concentrate long 
enough to finish a damn Sodoku, 
couldn t work, couldn t write.  No, 
I can handle it.  I keep up my talk 
therapy with Blumenthal... stick to 
my routine... watch my diet... keep 
my mind focused and occupied...    

NATALIE
Which you could do, say, by working 
on a criminal investigation. 

Pierce smiles, shakes his head.

PIERCE
Oh, that s very subtle, Natalie.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0936.    


NATALIE
(smiles)
Tell me about the incident. 

PIERCE
What s to tell?  It was a  
schizophrenic hallucination.  The 
product of randomly firing neurons.

NATALIE
Geoffrey, you know how your mind 
works.  Sometimes your 
hallucinations tell you things your 
conscious mind can t make sense of.

PIERCE
You re worse than Lewicki.

NATALIE
Tell me what you saw. 

PIERCE
A man.  First at Santech.  Then he 
came to my house.  He claimed he 
was the killer. 

NATALIE
What else did he say?

PIERCE
That Valerie Nelson is a liar.

NATALIE
Who s she?

PIERCE
She was having an affair with the 
victim.  She claims she didn t have 
anything to do with the crime, and 
the police believe her.

NATALIE
But maybe you intuited that she s 
dishonest, and that s what your 
subconscious is trying to tell you.

A beat as Pierce considers that possibility.

NATALIE (CONT D)
If this woman were lying ... how 
could you prove it?

OFF the question --

CLOSE ON PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH 

making his infamous address to Congress.

BUSH (ON TV)
Almost three months ago...       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0937.    


INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO HOSPITAL - PSYCH WARD - NIGHT

JIMMY, 20s, a patient, sits in front of the the TV, eyes 
glued to the set.  Kate and Pierce watch Jimmy watching Bush.

BUSH (CONT D, ON TV) 
...the United Nations Security 
Council gave Saddam Hussein his 
final chance to disarm.  He has 
shown instead utter contempt for 
the opinion of the world...

ROSSI
(re: Bush, dry)
Why are you forcing me to relive 
this nightmare?

PIERCE
Just watch.

BUSH (ON TV) 
The British government has learned 
that Saddam Hussein recently sought 
significant quantities of uranium 
from Africa.

Jimmy LAUGHS at this.  Pierce ejects the disk from the 
player.  Makes eye contact with Jimmy.

PIERCE
Thanks, Jimmy.

Jimmy returns Pierce s smile.  Pierce takes Rossi aside.

PIERCE (CONT D)
Jimmy is an aphasiac.  He s lost 
the ability to comprehend speech. 
As a coping mechanism, many 
aphasiacs become highly sensitive 
to vocal nuance... subtle 
inflections in speech.  When we 
lie, these inflections become more 
pronounced.  Most people don t 
notice them.  But aphasiacs do.  
And for some reason, these nuances 
sound funny to them.  So when Jimmy 
hears them, he laughs.

Rossi glances at Jimmy, then back to Pierce, amazed.

ROSSI
He s a human lie detector.

PIERCE
(nods)
Now watch this.

Pierce pops in another disk.  An image of Valerie Nelson from 
her police interview APPEARS on the TV.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0938.    


DETECTIVE HAMMOND (V.O.)
Where were you the night of 
September third?

VALERIE NELSON (ON TV)
Home, alone, waiting for Bob to 
call...

At this Jimmy LAUGHS HEARTILY -- Valerie is lying.

INT. VALERIE S APARTMENT   CORRIDOR - NIGHT

When Kate KNOCKS... she realizes the door is already slightly 
ajar.  She exchanges a curious look with Pierce.

ROSSI
Ms. Nelson?  Agent Rossi.  FBI.

No response.  She signals to Pierce: wait here.  Then she 
draws her sidearm and cautiously enters --

INT. VALERIE S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She sees an overturned floor lamp... signs of a struggle... 
moves stealthily down the hall until she sees

VALERIE NELSON

lying face-down in a pool of blood.  Kate rushes to her side, 
checks for a pulse.  Valerie stirs slightly -- she s alive, 
but near death.  Kate whips out her cell, hits speed-dial.

ROSSI
I need an ambulance!


END OF ACT THREE       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0939.    


ACT FOUR

EXT. VALERIE NELSON S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Police lights FLASH.  Valerie Nelson, hooked to oxygen and an 
IV, is loaded into the back of an AMBULANCE.  Agent Probert 
exchanges a few quick words with a PARAMEDIC, who then pulls 
the ambulance doors closed as Rossi and Pierce approach.

PROBERT
Vicious blow like that to the back 
of the head.  She might not even 
have seen her attacker.

ROSSI
They think she s going to make it?

PROBERT
Too early to say.
(rankled)
Why are we still on this case?  
Chicago PD should be handling it.

Rossi ignores that, hands him a plastic evidence bag 
containing a CELL PHONE.

ROSSI
Find out who s she been talking to.

INT. FBI CFO - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON Santech CEO Arthur Klane.

ROSSI (O.S.)
Why is the CEO of a Fortune 500 
company playing phone tag on his 
personal cell with a lab tech? 

WIDER TO REVEAL Rossi, grilling Klane who is here along with 
company lawyer Alan Dirk.

KLANE
Ms. Nelson was the one who started 
calling me.  Why don t you ask her?

ROSSI
That might be a little difficult... 
she s in surgery.  Someone tried to 
kill her last night.

KLANE
Oh, god...

ROSSI
What was the nature of your 
relationship with Ms. Nelson?

INTERCUT:       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0940.    


INT. FBI CFO - OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Pierce watches the questioning on the closed circuit.

KLANE
I couldn t have picked her out of 
the crowd at the company picnic.

As they continue, agent Probert enters with a coffee for 
himself and another cardboard cup which he hands to Pierce.

PROBERTROSSI (ON MONITOR)
Chamomile.  No milk no sugar.Then why the calls? 

Pierce takes the cup but doesn t even manage a thank you as 
he keeps his eyes glued on the interrogation.  Probert shakes 
his head, takes a seat, watches the show.

DIRK
We came down here voluntarily.  Mr.  
Klane isn t under any obligation to 
answer these questions.

But Rossi presses, trying to get a reaction.

ROSSI
Were you aware that Valerie Nelson 
was having an affair with your dead 
general counsel?

KLANE
What does that have to do with me?

ROSSI
Maybe Bob Weilman wasn t the only 
one getting executive perks from 
Valerie.  Maybe you got jealous.  
Killed Bob, then tried to do the 
same to Valerie.

KLANEDIRK
What?  We re done here.

Dirk stands, but Rossi s not letting it go.  

ROSSI (CONT D)
We ve got her hard drive, her 
emails, even if she doesn t survive 
surgery, we re going to find out 
what the two of you were up to.

DIRK
Arthur, let s go.

KLANE
No, you know what?  It s okay.  I 
don t have anything to hide.
(to Rossi)
After Bob was killed, I got an 
email from this Valerie, saying it 
was urgent I call her.  So I did.  
(MORE)       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0941.    

KLANE (CONT'D)
She said she had information that 
could be damaging to the company.

ROSSI
What kind of information?

KLANE
Something about falsified study 
results for one of our products.

In the Observation room, Pierce s ears perk up.

KLANE (CONT D)
She said she didn t want to talk 
about it over the phone.  So we 
agreed to meet... last night...
(beat)
Now I know why she didn t show up.

CLOSE ON PIERCE,

eyes glued to the monitor.  He absently goes to sip his tea.

DARK-HAIRED MAN (O.S.)
Don t drink that.

Pierce turns... to see the Dark-Haired Man, sitting next to 
Probert... who of course doesn t see anyone.

DARK-HAIRED MAN (CONT D)
It might kill you.

Pierce looks down at the tea and from HIS POV SEES A DARK, 
BUBBLING BREW.  Pierce recoils.  Looks to Probert.

PIERCE
Are you trying to poison me?

Probert shoots Pierce a look: huh?  But Probert quickly 
assumes the eccentric professor is speaking figuratively, 
turns his attention back to the monitor.

AGENT PROBERT
I told you.  No milk, no sugar.

DARK-HAIRED MAN
That s the murder weapon.

PIERCE
Tea?

AGENT PROBERT
Yes it s tea.

But it s the Dark-Haired man Pierce is listening to now.

DARK-HAIRED MAN
Not tea, poison.  Remember Timothy 
May said his mother was poisoned?  
I poisoned her.  And killed Bob 
Weilman.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0942.    


ROSSI (ON MONITOR)
So you think Valerie was some kind 
of whistle blower?

CEO KLANE (ON MONITOR)PIERCE
Maybe.  I never found out...I don t understand...

AGENT PROBERT
(re: the interview)
What s to understand?  She s trying 
to establish a motive for the 
attack on Valerie Nelson.

DARK-HAIRED MAN
Oh, I can give you a motive.  She 
was going to expose me.  
(to Pierce)
But now that s your job.

PIERCE
How...?

AGENT PROBERT
(irked)
Could you be quiet please, I m 
trying to listen.

Pierce looks from Probert to the Dark-Haired Man.  But even 
in this state, Pierce is lucid and in control enough to 
realize he can t keep up two conversations without making 
Probert suspicious.  He considers for a beat, then... knocks 
over his cup, spilling tea onto Probert s lap.  He leaps out 
of his chair.

AGENT PROBERT (CONT D)
What the hell...?!  I just bought 
this suit!

PIERCE
Sorry.  Try club soda...

Probert just shoots Pierce a murderous look and exits.

DARK-HAIRED MAN
You ve had a gut feeling all along, 
haven t you?  Especially after what 
Timothy May told you about his 
mother, and what those people at 
Santech claimed about the Insulprin 
study.

PIERCE
What are you talking about?

DARK-HAIRED MAN
Don t you remember my name?  

PIERCE
Gerard Permut.  So what?       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0943.    


DARK-HAIRED MAN
So I know how much you like 
puzzles.  

A beat.  And suddenly it dawns on Pierce --

PIERCE
It s another anagram...

Pierce grabs a SHARPIE off the table, and as the Dark-Haired 
Man spells it out, Pierce scrawls the letters... right on the 
standard-issue puke green dry-wall. 

DARK-HAIRED MAN
G...E...R... A... R... D... P... 
E... R... M... U... T.

And as Pierce stares at the letters he has written down, once 
again, CAMERA PUSHES INTO AN ECU of his eyes,

PIERCE S POV

The letters LIFT OFF THE WALL, SWIRL and REORDER THEMSELVES 
in various combinations until he sees it: 

PIERCE
 Drug tamperer... 

And Pierce quickly writes the new word underneath.  

DARK-HAIRED MAN
Couldn t you have figured that out 
without defacing government 
property?

But Pierce has had an epiphany, and he s already on the move, 
striding right into --

INT. FBI CFO - INTERROGATION ROOM

-- where Rossi is still in the middle of her interrogation.

PIERCE
I think I solved it.

OFF Rossi, nonplussed, PRELAP:

PIERCE (CONT D)
Someone tampered with the results 
of the drug study...

INT. FBI CFO - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

Pierce is laying out his theory to Rossi and Probert, who has  
tea stains on his pants.

PIERCE
...making it seem like Insulprin 
was perfectly safe.  That must ve 
been why Valerie was calling the 
CEO...       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0944.    


ROSSI
(nodding)
...to blow the whistle.  But what 
makes you think it had anything to 
do with Insulprin? 

A beat.  Of course Pierce doesn t want to say that it was a 
hallucination that put him onto this track.

PIERCE
A gut feeling.  Timothy May 
believed his mother was poisoned... 
that her heart attack was caused by 
the medication.

AGENT PROBERT
Timothy May is paranoid. 

PIERCE
That doesn t make him wrong.

A beat as Rossi and Probert digest that... which is when 
Probert spots the letters Pierce scrawled.  Appalled:

AGENT PROBERT
Did you write on the wall?

But Rossi s mind is racing too fast now to care.

ROSSI
But May s mother was taking the 
placebo.

PIERCE
According to the data reported by 
the company... 

ROSSI
(catching on)
...which you think was tampered 
with.

And now even Probert is considering that possibility.

AGENT PROBERT
The company will lose billions if 
the drug is pulled from the market. 
The CEO would certainly have a 
motive to cover that up.  

PIERCE
Maybe.  But who had direct access 
to the study results? 

OFF the question --

INT. SANTECH HEADQUARTERS - LAB - DAY

Rossi strides through the maze of work stations.  Pierce 
follows, but hangs back as Rossi does her thing.        PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0945.    


ROSSI
Dr. Bryant.

A man bent over a microscope stands, and we see that he is 
indeed Giles Bryant, head of product development, whom Pierce 
questioned earlier about the Insulprin study.  

BRYANT
Agent Rossi.  Dr. Pierce.  What can 
I do for you?

ROSSI
We re trying to find out who tried 
to kill Valerie Nelson.

BRYANT
It s awful.  Do her doctors think 
she ll recover? 

ROSSI
They re not sure.

Rossi holds up some computer printouts.

ROSSI (CONT D)
We found these files on her hard 
drive.  We were hoping maybe you 
could tell us what they are.

Bryant takes the files, peruses them a beat -- lots of 
columns and numbers.

BRYANT
They look like study results,  
morbidity rates... 

ROSSI
From your Insulprin trial.  That s 
what Dr. Pierce thought.  Except 
they show an unusually high 
incidence of heart attacks among 
women participating in the study.

A beat.  Bryant screws up his brow, starts paging through the 
printouts, trying to hide his growing nervousness.

BRYANT
That must be a mistake...

Rossi hands him another printout.

ROSSI
Can you take a look at this one?

Bryant takes it, peruses it, nods.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0946.    


BRYANT
Yes, these are the correct results.  
You see here, the incidence of 
heart attacks is approximately the 
same for those taking the placebo 
as for those on the real drug.  

ROSSI
But only because somebody moved 
patient results from one group into 
the other. 

A beat as Bryant digests that, anxiety clearly growing.

BRYANT
Valerie worked on this study.  You 
don t think she -- ?

ROSSI
We considered that.  But she s just 
a lab tech.  She didn t really have 
anything to gain personally from 
the drug being approved.  And she 
called your CEO, told him she had 
information that could be damaging 
to the company. 

Under Rossi s withering gaze, Bryant is starting to sweat.  
But still, he tries to cover.

BRYANT
Who would do something like this?

ROSSI
Dr. Pierce tells me pharmacologists 
of your stature get pretty sweet 
deals, shared patents on the drugs 
they develop.  

Bryant glances nervously from Rossi to Pierce.

BRYANT
What are you...?  That is --

ROSSI
Maybe Valerie found out you were 
falsifying the study.  She went to 
her boyfriend, Santech s top 
lawyer.  They were going to ruin 
everything you d worked for... so 
you had to stop them.

BRYANT
No... that s not --

ROSSI
Cole Hahn, size ten?

BRYANT
What?       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0947.    


ROSSI
Your shoes.  You left a bloody 
footprint in Valerie s kitchen.

A long beat... and Bryant crumbles... eyes welling.

BRYANT
Every drug has side-effects... I d 
figured out why it was causing 
heart attacks... we could ve worked 
out the kinks...

Rossi and Pierce exchange a glance.  

ROSSI
But Valerie threatened your 
livelihood.

Pierce finally joins the conversation, taking an empathetic 
tone with Bryant:

PIERCE
No, this wasn t about money for 
you, was it?  It was about science.  

Bryant looks to Pierce... and sees someone who understands.

BRYANT
You spend your whole career looking 
for that one  miracle cure,  you 
know?

PIERCE
Valerie should ve understood how 
important your work was.

Bryant shakes his head through bitter tears.

BRYANT
Instead, she starts collecting 
evidence against me, like I m a 
criminal...?  

ROSSI
You mean the study results?

BRYANT
Yes... and then I saw her stealing 
pills...

FLASH TO:

INT. SANTECH HEADQUARTERS - LAB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

It s late.  Valerie is filling a ZIPLOCK with Insulprin 
tablets.  Bryant watches discreetly from the shadows.

BRYANT (V.O.)
So I followed her...       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0948.    


EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Valerie greets Bob Weilman with a passionate kiss, slips him 
the tablets.  Bryant watches from his car down the street.

BRYANT (V.O.)
...she brought them to Bob.  She 
goes to a lawyer, instead of me?

INT. SANTECH HEADQUARTERS - LAB - PRESENT

Rossi presses the increasingly distraught Bryant.

ROSSI
You figured they were going to get 
the pills tested, prove they 
weren t placebos?

BRYANT
(nods)
I thought, I just need to make him 
understand...

INT. BOB WEILMAN S STUDY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Weilman and Bryant are having a heated exchange.

BRYANT
Bob, I don t know what Valerie s 
been telling you... but I can fix 
this --

BOB WEILMAN
Do you have any idea what kind of 
liability you ve exposed this 
company to?  

BRYANT
And what s going to happen to the 
company if this goes public?  We re 
on the same team.    

BOB WEILMAN
You don t just show up at my house 
like this, Giles.

BRYANT
(desperate)
What are you going to do?

BOB WEILMAN
I haven t decided yet --

BRYANT
Bob, please... 

Bryant grabs Bob s shirt.

BOB WEILMAN
Get out of here, Giles.  Before I 
call the police.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0949.    


Weilman starts to physically usher Bryant out of the room... 
which is when Bryant suddenly grabs the GOLF TROPHY from a 
shelf and SLAMS Weilman in the head with it.  The lawyer goes 
down.  Bryant hits the off-camera Weilman again... and again.  

INT. SANTECH LAB - DAY - PRESENT

Bryant is distraught.

BRYANT (CONT D)
I guess... I guess I just went 
crazy...

And as Bryant sobs at the memory, OFF Pierce and Rossi --

INT. SANTECH HEADQUARTERS - CORRIDOR - DAY

Rossi and Pierce observe as Bryant is led out in handcuffs by 
Hammond and uniformed OFFICERS.  Wryly, to Hammond --

PIERCE
Nice work, Detective.

Hammond glares at them, hustles Bryant out.  Rossi suppresses 
a smile. 

PIERCE (CONT D)
You didn t tell me you found a 
footprint in Valerie s apartment.

ROSSI
I didn t.

Pierce turns back to her, eyes her with mock outrage.

PIERCE
Agent Rossi, I am shocked that you 
would so blatantly manipulate an 
obviously troubled individual.

As she shrugs, smiles, Pierce suddenly feels a tap on his 
shoulder.  He turns and sees the Dark-Haired Man, grinning. 

DARK-HAIRED MAN
What s up, Doc?

Pierce reacts, surprised to see him.  And from Rossi s POV, 
he seems suddenly distracted.  And she s a bit concerned.

ROSSI
Geoffrey, what is it?  Are you 
feeling okay?

But Pierce doesn t want her to now he s actively 
hallucinating and manages to cover. 

PIERCE
I m fine.  It s nothing.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0950.    


DARK-HAIRED MAN
Oh, it s not nothing.   You caught 
the killer...  so what the hell am 
I still doing here?

A beat.  And then suddenly, Pierce gets it:

PIERCE
The case isn t over yet...

ROSSI
What are you talking about?  

But Pierce doesn t answer.  Instead, he hurries for the exit.

ROSSI (CONT D)
Geoffrey?

But he s already gone.

EXT. SANTECH HEADQUARTERS - PARKING LOT - DAY

As Hammond helps the handcuffed Bryant into the back of a 
SQUAD CAR --

PIERCE (O.S.)
Doctor Bryant!

Bryant turns.  Hammond is exasperated --

DETECTIVE HAMMOND
What now?

But Pierce ignores him, eyes Bryant.

PIERCE
You said you figured out why 
Insulprin was causing heart 
attacks.  What was it?

Bryant looks at him a beat.  Why s he asking this?

BRYANT
The drug depleted patients  
thiamine levels...  

As the light bulb goes on for Pierce, Rossi catches up.

ROSSI
Geoffrey, what s going on?

He turns to her, and says simply:

PIERCE
There s another victim. 
CUT TO BLACK:


END OF ACT FOUR       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0951.    


ACT FIVE

INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO HOSPITAL - PSYCH WARD - DAY

Kapoor shows a BLOOD ANALYSIS to Pierce as Rossi looks on. 

DOCTOR KAPOOR
I ran the second tox screen you 
asked for.  We found significant 
levels of Concanavalin A.  

PIERCE
The primary sugar-binding molecule 
in Insulprin.

As Rossi digests that, Pierce, mind working, blurts out --

PIERCE (CONT D)
 Some bitches are just skinny. 

ROSSI
I beg your pardon?

PIERCE
The daughter was right.  Pamela 
Weilman is just thin... not 
bulimic.  It was Insulprin that 
depleted her thiamine...

DOCTOR KAPOOR
Mrs. Weilman isn t diabetic.  Why 
would she be on a diabetes drug?

PIERCE
I don t think she knew she was 
taking it.  I think she was being 
  Someone must have been poisoned.
grinding it up, putting it in her 
food, trying to induce a heart 
attack...  

A beat as Rossi tries to make sense of that.

ROSSI
But she didn t have a heart 
attack...

PIERCE
Because side-effects manifest 
differently in different patients.  
Low thiamine levels can cause 
cardiac failure.  But in rare 
instances, they can also cause --   

KAPOOR
Korsakoff s Syndrome.

As Rossi digests that --

KAPOOR (CONT D)
So who was poisoning her?       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0952.    


OFF the question, PRELAP: 

ROSSI (V.O.)
Ms. Nelson?

INT. UNIV. OF CHICAGO HOSPITAL - VALERIE NELSON S ROOM - DAY

While Pierce again hangs back, Rossi approaches Valerie 
Nelson, sitting up in bed.

ROSSI
I m Agent Rossi, FBI.  This is 
Doctor Pierce.  

VALERIE NELSON
Agent Rossi.  They told me you 
saved my life... 

ROSSI
Would you mind if we ask you a few 
questions?  For our case against 
Dr. Bryant.

VALERIE NELSON
I still can t believe he tried to 
kill me...

ROSSI
You found out he was tampering with 
the Insulprin study...

A beat.  Valerie nods.  

ROSSI (CONT D)
So you told Bob Weilman about your 
suspicions.

VALERIE NELSON
I knew that drug was going to hurt 
a lot of people when it hit the 
market.  Bob was a lawyer.  I 
figured he d know what to do.  

ROSSI
He told you you needed more 
evidence?  That s why you took the 
pills.

VALERIE NELSON
Bob didn t want to expose the 
company to any liability unless he 
knew for sure Dr. Bryant had done 
something wrong.

Pierce abruptly LAUGHS.  Startled, Valerie looks to him.

VALERIE NELSON (CONT D)
What?       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0953.    


PIERCE
It s just funny that you didn t 
tell the police any of this.

Unnerved, Valerie looks back to Rossi, explains: 

VALERIE NELSON
They wanted to know about my 
relationship with Bob...  I didn t 
think the drug had anything to do 
with it...

PIERCE
You weren t trying to blow the 
whistle.  You gave the pills to Bob 
so he could poison his wife...  

VALERIE NELSON
Are you out of your mind?

PIERCE
Well, that s not the clinical 
description, but yes, actually.

Rossi can t help but smile.  

PIERCE (CONT D)
Poor Dr. Bryant, he was out of his 
mind too.  He was feeling so guilty 
about what he d done, so nervous 
that he was going to be caught, 
that he became paranoid.   And he 
made the same mistake we did.  

VALERIE NELSON
What mistake...?  

PIERCE
Bryant assumed you d stolen the 
pills as evidence, to prove he was 
manipulating the study.  But the 
truth is, you were supplying Bob 
Weilman with the perfect murder 
weapon.  

VALERIE NELSON
What are you talking about -- ?

ROSSI
The drug wasn t on the market yet, 
so it was virtually untraceable.  

 PIERCE
You must have been dosing Pamela 
for weeks, just waiting for her 
heart to give out.  

A beat as Valerie reacts to that, seemingly horrified.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0954.    


VALERIE NELSON
If... if Bob was poisoning his wife 
with those pills... I didn t know 
anything about it...

PIERCE
You re the scientist.  You re the 
one that knew in high enough doses, 
Insulprin would kill Pamela.  

VALERIE NELSON
I was trying to do the right thing! 
Why else would I call the CEO of 
the company and tell him about the 
falsified results? 

ROSSI
You were worried that Pamela found 
out her husband was poisoning her.  
If she told the police that, you d 
need a cover story to explain why 
you d given him the pills.  So you 
pretended to be a whistle-blower.   

VALERIE NELSON
No, that s not right -- !

PIERCE
What s not right is that Pamela 
Weilman was accused of killing her 
husband, when the reality is... you 
and your boyfriend were trying to 
kill her. 

A beat.  Valerie s eyes turn cold.

VALERIE NELSON
I want a lawyer.

ROSSI
You re going to need a good one.

As Valerie reacts to that, Pierce sees the Dark-Haired Man 
across the room.  He smiles.

DARK-HAIRED MAN
Nice working with you, Doc.

And as Pierce watches him exit --

INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY

Pierce and Jolie Weilman are watching through the glass as 
her mother undergoes an MRI.

JOLIE WEILMAN
Does she know what my Dad tried to 
do to her?       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0955.    


PIERCE
We can tell her what happened, but 
anything new that she learns will 
fade in just a few hours...

JOLIE WEILMAN
I still don t get it.

Pierce notes the music player strapped to Jolie s arm.

PIERCE
That s one of those iPods, right?  
I hear they can store thousands of 
songs.

JOLIE WEILMAN
What century are you from?

PIERCE
Your mother s brain is like a 
broken iPod.  She can t add any new 
songs... but she can listen to the 
old ones.

Jolie registers this.  Then:

JOLIE WEILMAN
Maybe she s lucky.  I wish I could 
forget a lot of things...

PIERCE
(after beat)
Your mom s going to need someone to 
take care of her.

JOLIE WEILMAN
How am I supposed to do that on my 
own?

Pierce puts his hand on hers, reassuring.

PIERCE
You won t be on on your own.

OFF Jolie, PRELAP --

STIMULUS PACKAGE (V.O.)
You wanted to see me?

INT. PIERCE S OFFICE - DAY

Pierce is behind his desk.  Stimulus Package is at the door.

PIERCE
Karyn.  Thank you for coming.  

Pierce hesitates.  This is difficult for him.       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0956.    


PIERCE (CONT D)
I want to... apologize.  What I 
said to you on the quad, it was... 
highly inappropriate...

Stimulus Package turns and LOCKS THE DOOR behind her.

PIERCE (CONT'D)
 ... and unjustified...

She starts to unbutton her blouse.  Pierce reacts, nervous.

PIERCE (CONT D)
...offensive...

STIMULUS PACKAGE
...and very perceptive.  

Her blouse drops to the floor.  

STIMULUS PACKAGE (CONT D)
I m sorry my friend was such a 
bitch.  I told her not to file that 
complaint.

Flustered, Pierce moves past her.

PIERCE
Would you excuse me for a moment?

Pierce unlocks the door, makes a hasty EXIT.

INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Pierce spies Lewicki approaching.

PIERCE
Lewicki!

Lewicki senses the alarm in Pierce s voice.

LEWICKI
What is it, Doc?

PIERCE
I need you to tell me if there s 
someone in my office.

Lewicki reacts, realizing Pierce may be experiencing another 
hallucinatory episode.  Lewicki quickly EXITS into Pierce s 
office.  A moment later, a SCREAM.  Stimulus Package hastily 
EXITS, clutching her blouse, covering herself.  After a beat, 
Lewicki appears.

LEWICKI
That one was definitely real.

OFF this, PRELAP --       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0957.

Pierce is in his element, lecturing to his admiring class.

PIERCE (CONT D)
This week... I want to talk about 
  When we re trying to normalcy.
understand the brain... we have to 
ask, what is normal?  If you feel 
sad, do you just have a case of the 
blues... or do you have a 
neurochemical imbalance?

In the back of the class, Natalie ENTERS.  Pierce sees her, 
she smiles, waves discreetly.  Pierce continues:

PIERCE (CONT'D)
The vast majority of the case 
studies we ll look at this semester 
involve patients whose brains are 
anything but normal.  And there s 
no question they suffer.  But is it 
all bad?

may actually protect them from 
painful truths no one would ever 
want to think about...

Jolie says something.  Pamela smiles.

INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO HOSPITAL - PSYCH WARD - DAY

Jimmy sits, watching GEORGE W. BUSH on TV.

PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
Others develop a cheerful 
disposition that may help them cope 
with situations the rest of us find 
disturbing...

Jimmy LAUGHS.

INT. PIERCE S CLASSROOM - DAY

The lecture continues.

PIERCE (CONT D)
And if we re going to establish a 
base-line, don t we also have to 
ask ourselves...       PROOF - "Pilot   8/10/0958.    


INT. ROSSI S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rossi on a couch, eating take-out.

PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
...how the brains of even so-called 
normal people respond to certain 
stimuli? 

Rossi takes a bite from her burger and a look comes over face 
-- it s heaven.  She breaks a little piece off the burger and 
feeds it to her CAT.  CAMERA PULLS BACK WIDE to see that 
she s all alone in the sparsely furnished apartment...

EXT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO CAMPUS - FOUNTAIN - DAY

A gorgeous afternoon.  Pierce and Natalie sit in on the bench 
talking and laughing.

PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
And if we re able to treat the 
people who suffer from these 
neurological disorders... 

Consumed by his conversation with Natalie, Pierce doesn t 
notice Lewicki approaching.  At the sight of Pierce, Lewicki 
stops, smiles to himself, shakes his head.  

PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
...restore them to quote normalcy, 
are we only doing them good? 

And now from LEWICKI S POV we see that in actuality,

PIERCE IS SITTING ALONE,

animatedly talking to himself... because NATALIE IS NOT REAL.

PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
Or might we sometimes also be 
stripping away what makes them 
unique...   

As students pass by, paying no mind to the idiosyncratic 
professor, Lewicki approaches, sits in THE EMPTY SPOT next to 
Pierce.  As Pierce reacts to that, Lewicki reaches into his 
satchel, hands Pierce a cassette.  And as they exchange a few 
words --

PIERCE (V.O.) (CONT D)
...robbing them of an essential 
part of who they are?

Pierce puts the cassette in his Walkman.  And as Lewicki gets 
up and walks away, CAMERA CRANES UP on Pierce, alone, 
listening to his music --

FADE TO BLACK.
