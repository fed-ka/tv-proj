      Neil, wearing swim trunks now, walks out to the pool.  He 
      climbs onto a diving board, walks to the end as if it was the 
      plank on a pirate ship, looks down into

      THE SURFACE OF THE WATER

      We can make out a layer of leaves, sticks, gunk -- it s like 
      a dirty pond.

      Neil hops off the board, picks up a long net to scoop out 
      some of the trash.  He takes one pass over the water then 
      stops, drops the net and walks off.



      Having dozed off, Neil awakes in a sea of other MEN in suits 
      at the gate area for his flight.  A VOICE is crackling over 
      the P.A. 

                                  VOICE
                    Ladies and gentlemen, we can now 
                    begin general boarding...

      Still groggy, Neil looks over at a balding BUSINESSMAN across 
      from him who s putting on his jacket.

                                    BUSINESSMAN
                    Three hours late and not even a 
                     sorry for the delay.... 

      Neil blends into the sea of other PASSENGERS, everyone 
      showing signs of stress already.



      Neil and his Lawyer exit the room.  Just before they reach 
      freedom, Neil sees the Flight Attendant in another office 
      being grilled by a TSA OFFICER.  She makes eye contact with 
      Neil just as he absently takes a sip from his water bottle.  
      As Lawyer pulls Neil away, hustles him off, CUT TO:



      Establish the impressive high-rise that is Neil s firm.  



      SONG CONTINUES.  Neil s car squeals around the corner on a 
      wide street in a housing development filled with model homes.



      PATRONS file out to find an after party, slowing to gawk at a 
      couple of COP CARS at the curb.  Looking closer, we see Grace 
      in the back seat of one, her foe in the other.

      NANCY, BETH and MONICA --

      Huddle off to the side, waiting for the final outcome.

      A COP --

      Finishes talking to his PARTNER, then approaches the car with 
      Grace inside, opens the door.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  34.


                                  COP
                    If you re not willing to press 
                    charges, neither is she.

      Grace turns to look at her foe, then back to the Cop -- this 
      is the most fun she s had in years.

                                  GRACE
                    I ve never been in a bar fight 
                    before.
                          (off Cop)
                    You know, in college?  I used to 
                    study so much, I never went out to  
                    clubs.  I was kind of a geek.  

      Cop is completely uninterested, hands Grace a cell phone.

                                  COP
                    Evidently you dropped this during 
                    your  bar fight.   Gentlemen over 
                    there wanted me to make sure you 
                    got it back.

      Grace takes the phone, looks over to where the Cop indicates 
      and sees SIMON looking back at her.  He smiles, motions for 
      her to check her phone.  Grace looks down, sees something she 
      wasn t expecting just before --

                                  NEIL (O.S.)
                    Grace...?

      She looks up as Neil approaches.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    What the hell... are you okay?

                                  COP
                          (to Neil)
                    You re the husband?

                                  NEIL
                    What happened?

      Cop gestures for Grace to get out of the car.  

                                  COP
                    I ll let her explain.

      Neil nods his thanks to the cop, turns to wave to Monica, 
      Nancy and Beth.

                                  NEIL
                    Can you drive her car back?  I ll 
                    have her ride with me.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  35.


      They hesitate a beat before moving off.  Neil turns back to 
      Grace, his face tight.

                                  GRACE
                    You re never gonna believe this.  
                    I, me, Grace, got into a bar fight.

                    We just wanted to try something a 
                    little different.

                    Jenny s mom called me completely 
                    panicked, I had no idea where you 
                    were --

      Grace realizes -- Anffika.  Shit.

                    You almost got arrested? 

                                  GRACE
                    Okay, that woman shoved me first.

                                  NEIL
                    What woman?  What are you even 
                    doing here?

                                  GRACE
                    We just wanted to have some fun.  
                    I m still allowed to fun, aren t I?

      Neil studies her.

                                  NEIL
                    How much have you had to drink?

                                  GRACE
                    Well... I could have another...

      She leans on his shoulder.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  36.

                    We could fool around when we get

      He pulls away.

                                  NEIL
                    What is wrong with you?

                                  GRACE
                    Nothing.  I feel like myself.  

                                  NEIL
                    What does that mean?  I don t even 
                    know who you are right now.

                                  GRACE
                    I don t know who I ve been, Neil.  
                    And you don t even notice.  Why 
                    don t you notice me anymore?

      She s making a scene now. 

                                  NEIL
                    Can we just get in the car --?

                                  GRACE
                    No.  Dammit, Neil do you realize 
                    this is the first time we ve even

      He takes her arm.

                                  NEIL
                    I think I just need to get you

      She pushes him off.

                                  GRACE
                    Where I belong, right?

      She studies him, then marches off.  Neil holds a beat, not 
      sure what the hell is going on.  As he finally follows after

      Grace glides by on her bike, serpentines down the open road 
      like a kid who just got their training wheels off.

      But she s not just going where ever the road takes her.  She 
      has a destination in mind.  As she looks up at a street sign, 
       Dante Circle,  makes a tight turn, we CUT TO: 



      Grace turns a corner, peddles past a row of houses.  She s 
      slowing down, reading the addresses, finally stops at one 
      near the middle of the block.

      She pulls out her phone and this time we go

      CLOSE ON THE SCREEN --

      There s a text.   Sorry about the club.  I just wanted to 
      know your story   Below that is an address.  It matches the 
      building in front of her.

      Grace considers the front door -- then suddenly snaps back to 
      reality -- this is crazy.  She peddles a half-turn forward, 
      stops again.  Looks back.  Visibly torn.  

      Then she gets really nervous -- could someone be watching 
      her?  She turns back down the driveway to peddle off when --

      A PORSCHE --

      Pulls up.  Grace freezes.  Simon gets out.  They stare at 
      each other.  She finally smiles.  As he approaches...

                                          ACT THREE



      Neil staggers out the sliding door from the kitchen, runs 
      outside and vomits.  

      When he recovers he looks back at the house, sees Grace pass 
      by an upstairs window.  Then he hears the door open out 
      front... a car alarm CHIRPS.  

      His anger coming into focus now, Neil races down the side of 
      the house and sees 

      SIMON

      Climbing into a Porsche.  He revs the engine and pulls away.

      NEIL

      Hops the fence, stumbles onto the other side. 

      He watches as Simon s car heads out of the development then 
      hops in his own car and races down

                    What are you doing, man --? 

      Neil tugs on it again and Simon opens it, sending Neil 
      backwards.  Simon gets out of the car.  

                                  SIMON (CONT D)
                    I don t know what your problem is, 
                    buddy, but you need to calm the fu--

      Neil comes back, takes a wild swing.  Simon ducks it, using 
      Neil s momentum to toss him into a body of water. 

      Neil leaps up, rushes Simon again.  This time Simon puts him 
      in a rear naked choke, cutting off his air.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)

                    I just saw you and Grace at the

                    So you saw what we were...

                    Does she know you were there?                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  41.


      Neil finally shakes his head, takes a seat on Simon s car, 
      wet and defeated.  Simon looks back toward the house, then 
      back to Neil.

                                  SIMON (CONT D)

                    So you actually do this for a 
                    living?

                                  SIMON
                    I started doing it for fun. It just 
                    happens to be a very good living.
                          (off Neil)
                    Look, if you love her, I wouldn t 
                    throw it all away just yet.  
                    Marriage is about a lot more than 
                    just sex.

                                  NEIL
                    You married?  How would you know?

                                  SIMON
                    Because I ve slept with a lot more 
                    married women than you ever will.  
                    And believe me, when all is said 
                    and done, you don t want to throw 
                    it all away over a few orgasms.

      Simon studies Neil with real empathy, impulsively peels off 
      his jacket, puts it over Neil s shoulders.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  43.

                    You got a friend you can call...?

      Neil stands, considers Simon for a beat, heads for his car.

      Simon reaches out for him, but Neil shoves him away -- don t 
      touch me.  They hold each other s stare for a long beat 
      before Neil gets in his car and drives off.

      As Simon watches him go, CUT TO:





      Front door opens and Grace steps outside.  She locks the door 
      back then turns and sees 

      AN OLDER COUPLE

      In the distance, holding hands as they walk across a field 
      out front.  Grace watches the couple for a beat and we notice 
      Neil s car is gone.  As Grace closes the door to the house 
      and locks it, heads for her car, we CUT TO:



      Neil s car pulls up and parks outside the garage.  Neil 
      exits, reaches back inside and rips Simon s jacket off the 
      front seat, walks around to

      THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE

      Where he throws the jacket into a garbage can, continues to:                                       Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  43A.


      THE BACK OF THE HOUSE

      Neil is headed for one of the sliding glass doors, but is 
      distracted by something in the pool -- a WHOOSHING NOISE.

      He heads over and sees the pool vacuum hung up and struggling 
      on one of the steps, sucking mostly air.  Neil yanks up the 
      hose and tosses the vacuum back into the water, watches it 
      sink.

      The yard quiet now, he turns back toward the house and 
      studies it.  The emptiness inside.  He takes a seat, unable 
      to go in.



      Anika opens the stage door, sees Neil waiting for her.

                                  ANIKA
                    What are you doing here?  You re 
                    supposed to be in New York --

      He comes to her, gives her a hug.

                                  NEIL
                    It s your big debut.  I couldn t 
                    miss that.

                                  ANIKA
                    Where s mom?

                                  NEIL
                      ...probably inside already.  I was 
                    hoping I could watch from backstage

                                  GRACE (O.S.)
                    Neil...? 

      They both turn as Grace approaches.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    ...I thought you had a flight this 
                    morning.

      She gives Neil a kiss; he pulls back.

                                  NEIL
                    Trip was canceled.

                    ...Why didn t you call?

      Before Neil can answer a TEACHER pokes her head out of the 
      stage door.

                                    TEACHER
                    Anika -- you re almost on.

                                  ANIKA
                    Oh, my God -- coming.

                                  GRACE
                    Go.  Dad and I ll grab our seats.

      She turns to race off.

                                  NEIL
                    Hey --

      She turns back.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    We re proud of you.  Just have fun.

      She studies her parents for a tortured beat.

                                  ANIKA
                    I will.

      She turns and races off.  Grace looks to Neil.

                                  GRACE
                    Why didn t you leave me a message?

      Neil starts to move off.

      He turns back. 

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Something happen?

                                  NEIL
                    ...It got rescheduled.

      Grace studies him.

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    It s not a big deal.

      Grace finally comes to him, takes his hand.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  46.

                    I know it means a lot to Anika that 
                    you re here.  Me, too.

      Neil gives her a thin smile.  

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    We should get our seats.

      As she leads him off, CUT TO:



      Neil marches for his car, Grace and Anika trailing behind.

                                  NEIL
                    No, absolutely not.

                                  GRACE
                    Neil, wait --

                                  NEIL
                    I m not giving this school another 
                    penny if that s how they re going 
                    to treat her or us.

                                  ANIKA
                    I totally agree.

      Grace turns to her.

                                  GRACE
                    You hated it here that much you had 
                    to sabotage your chances at an 
                    education with that stunt?

                                  ANIKA
                    I ve told you a hundred times, I 
                    don t belong here.  And everybody 
                    hates me any way.

      Grace exhales -- clearly there s bigger issues going on here. 
      She turns to Neil.

                                  GRACE
                    I ll drive her home.  Then you and 
                    I ll talk.

      She ushers Anika off.  As Neil watches them go, CUT TO:                                           Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  50.



      Neil walks to the edge of the pool, looks across the water -- 
      it s still littered with leaves and gunk.  He scans the yard, 
      spots the automated pool cleaner, moves to pick it up.

                                  GRACE
                    Neil?

      Grace has appeared at the sliding door.

                                  GRACE (cont d) (CONT D)
                    What are you doing?

                                  NEIL
                    Cleaning the pool.

                                  GRACE
                    Now?

      Neil uncurls the hose, tosses the cleaner into the pool, 
      watches it sink.

                                  NEIL
                    I can t remember the last time any 
                    of us spent time out here.  We used 
                    to love this thing.  What happened?

      Grace studies him for a long beat then goes.

      As Neil adjusts the hose, watches the cleaner go to work, he 
      hears a cell phone RING from

      THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE

      Neil appears, realizes the ringing is coming from the garbage 
      can.  He considers it for a moment, opens the lid and digs 
      around, pulls out Simon s jacket... then the ringing cell 
      phone... answers.

                                  NEIL (cont d) (CONT D)

                    Hi... I know we said nine, but I 
                    was so nervous I got here almost an 
                    hour ago.  Any chance you can come 
                    early before I lose my nerve?

      Sprinklers pop on the front lawn, shooting water everywhere.



      Grace looks out at the driveway -- his car isn t there.



      Just outside the city.  Neil approaches a gated entrance, 
      stepping lightly past a flowering garden. 



      Neil enters, takes in the sparse, quiet surroundings.  

      Ahead of him, a bevy of bald-headed monks kneel in prayer as 
      incense wafts throughout the air.  A young APPRENTICE MONK 
      approaches.

                                  NEIL 
                    Hi...I m not sure if you can help 
                    me, but...

      As Neil begins to tell the Apprentice Monk his story, the 
      words fade out and we PRE-LAP:

                    Anyway, despite everything that s 
                    happened, I still thought there 
                    might be hope for me... and my 
                    marriage.



      Grace paces, mind racing.  Then she sees those annoying wind 
      chimes, rips them down just as Stephanie exits the house with 
      a cup of tea.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    You gave me those for Christmas.

      Grace hands her the chimes, takes the tea.  

                                  GRACE
                    They were a re-gift.
                          (re: the tea)
                    What is this?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Valerian root.  Calms the nerves.

      Grace sips it -- yuck.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Sorry.  I m on a juice cleanse.  I 
                    got rid of all alcohol and sugar in 
                    the house.

      Grace dumps the tea in one of the potted plants.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    What are you going to tell Anika?

                                  GRACE
                    I don t know... The whole thing 
                    might be my fault.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    I m sorry -- what?

                                  GRACE
                    He came home the other night and 
                    said he tried to quit but I... I 
                    thought he was joking.  I should ve

                                  STEPHANIE
                    And that makes it your fault?

                    He s been so unhappy lately.  I ve

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Grace.  You have been nothing but 
                      supportive of him since the first 
                    day you were together.  Nothing you 
                    said or didn t say could ve made 
                    him do what he did... unless 
                    there s something else going on.

      Grace looks up at her sister, conflicted.

                                  STEPHANIE (CONT D)
                    Is something else going on?                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  62.


      As Grace hesitates, not sure how much to say, a gray-haired 
      MAN, 50, pops his head out, wearing only boxers.

                                  MAN
                    Hey, um, shower?  Which way is hot?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    Left.  But you have to let it run.  
                    Takes forever.

                                  MAN
                    Got it.
                          (then, to Grace)
                    Hi.

      He disappears.  Grace looks to Stephanie -- seriously?

                                  STEPHANIE
                    I met him at bikram, what?

      Grace considers Stephanie, switching gears.

                                  GRACE
                    You know what his office said?  
                    That when he went to New York the 
                    other day, he freaked out on the 
                    plane and pulled the emergency 
                    slide.

                                  STEPHANIE
                    You re kidding.

                                  GRACE
                    I guess you can see the whole thing 
                    online.

      Stephanie leaps up, runs into the house leaving Grace alone 
      with her thoughts.  We PUSH IN on her face, seeing the 
      tension until --

                                  STEPHANIE
                    I think I found it...

      Stephanie sits back down with an IPad, shows Grace.

      CLOSE ON THE SCREEN --

      The same video we saw earlier in Victor s office of Neil 
      talking to the plane and then pulling the emergency slide.

      Grace sees something else.  

      CLOSER ON THE SCREEN --

      Neil is in the middle of his speech.  And there s something 
      oddly noble about him.  Revolutionary.

                                  GRACE
                    I m not so sure...

      Stephanie turns to Grace -- what?  As Grace leans in closer 
      to the screen, marveling at Neil s performance, we CUT TO:                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  63.



      PICK UP Neil s car as it drives down a windy canyon road.



      Neil s car pulls into a driveway outside a gated home.  Neil 
      exits, approaches the entrance, stops.  He pulls off his 
      wedding ring and pockets it before he rings the buzzer.  
      After a beat:

                                    WOMAN S VOICE
                    Step back from the camera, please.

      Neil obliges.

                                    WOMAN S VOICE (CONT D)
                    Turn around.

      He does.  Waits.  BUZZER rings and the gate opens.



      Neil walks toward the front door; it s been left open.  



      The magic hour, nowhere else you d want to be.



      Establish.



      Neil s car pulls up the driveway, parks.



      Neil walks with Victor along the pool, mid-conversation.

                                  VICTOR
                    ...you took me by surprise.  Twice 
                    in one week.  That s not something 
                    I m used to.                                           Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  77.


                                  NEIL
                    Sorry about the tv --

                                  VICTOR
                    Don t be.  The reality is it s that 
                    kind of passion -- and recklessness 
                    that s made this firm great.  And I 
                    don t want to lose it.

      Neil turns to Victor, way ahead of him.

                                  NEIL
                    I don t want my job back.

                                  VICTOR
                    Good.  Because I m offering you 
                    something better.  A partnership.  
                          (off Neil)
                    I got a call from Charles Lipton 
                    this morning.  Said he ran in to 
                    you at a party the other night.  I 
                    don t know what you said to him, 
                    but he s insisting you take over 
                    his hedge fund.  I told him you 
                    couldn t wait to get started. 

      Neil looks back to the house, sees Grace watching them from 
      the kitchen.  He turns back to Victor.

                                  VICTOR (CONT D)
                    Don t make me beg.  You know how 
                    much money a partner makes, Neil?

                                  NEIL
                    I don t care about the money.

                                  VICTOR
                    ...What do you care about?



      Grace comes out of the house, approaches Neil who s staring 
      at the pool (it s shimmering and clean).  Grace stands 
      alongside him.  There s a long beat.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  78.


                                  GRACE
                    I fired the pool guy.
                          (off Neil)
                    You were right, he was lazy.  I 
                    don t know why I never saw that 
                    before.

                                  NEIL
                    We never spend time out here any 
                    more.

                                  GRACE
                    It was the whole reason we bought 
                    the house, remember?

      A beat.  Grace looks to him for the first time.

                                  GRACE (cont d) (CONT D)
                    How come you never told me?

                                  NEIL
                    About the job?

                                  GRACE
                      Everything.

                                  NEIL
                    I didn t want to worry you.  
                          (off Grace)
                    All worked out.

                                  GRACE 
                    What about us?  Are we going to 
                    work out?

      Neil looks to her for the first time.

                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    I m scared Neil.  What s happening 
                    to us?

      He reaches for her and she clings to him as if he were her 
      last breath.  After a long beat.

                                  NEIL
                    Do you still have that tie you 
                    bought me?

      She pulls back to face him -- what?

                                  NEIL (CONT D)
                    That color, it really does --                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  79.


                                  GRACE
                    Bring out your eyes more, I know.

      Neil searches for how to say the next few words.

                                  NEIL
                    I want you to know I appreciate 
                    when you give me things and... I 
                    should never take that for granted. 

                                  GRACE
                    ...Thank you.  I returned it.

      He laughs -- of course she did.  There s a moment between 
      them before Anika pops her head out of the house. 

                                  ANIKA
                    Mom, I m back.  Leave the keys on 
                    the counter?

      She nods.  Anika turns to go, turns back.

                                  ANIKA (CONT D)
                    Hi, dad.

      Then she disappears inside.  Neil looks to Grace -- keys?

                                  GRACE
                    I let her drive on her own today.
                          (off Neil)
                    It was a moment of weakness, I 
                    know.  I ll lock her back in her 
                    room until she s twenty-five, don t 
                    worry.  That way we won t have to 
                    deal with the school issue.

                                  NEIL
                    ...I think I had an idea how to fix 
                    that.



      Neil and Grace exit the building, the encounter still 
      settling. 

                                  GRACE
                    That went well.

                                  NEIL
                    Yeah.  You were really good in 
                    there.

                                  GRACE
                    ...you, too.

      They consider each other for a beat until Anika comes running 
      up from down the hall where she was chatting with FRIENDS.

                                  ANIKA
                    Are they letting me back in?

      Neil nods.  She hugs him.

                                  ANIKA (CONT D)
                    Thank you, thank you --

                                  GRACE
                    We still have to discuss how we re 
                    going to deal with this at home.

                                  ANIKA
                    Oh, yes, I totally get it.

      Neil s still a bit confused though.

                                  NEIL
                    Can I ask you something?  If you 
                    hated it here so much, why so happy 
                    now?

                                  ANIKA
                    I did hate it here.  But after what 
                    happened, I m finally popular.

      As Anika looks back to the girls she was chatting with, gives 
      her parents a hopeful smile, we CUT TO:



      Neil sits across from the Zen Master holding the RED PHONE.

                                  NEIL
                    I got this the other day.  It s 
                    Simon s number.  If someone calls, 
                    we start talking and they re still 
                    looking for someone to...
                          (off Zen Master)
                    I know.  Crazy.  But I don t ever 
                    have to answer it if I don t want.                                           Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  85.


                                  ZEN MASTER
                    But you will.

                                  NEIL
                    Guess you never really do know 
                    where enlightenment is going to 
                    come from.

      Zen Master smiles for the first time.  Then Neil.  As his 
      grin keeps growing and growing, we CUT TO:



       I Can See Clearly Now  by Jimmy Cliff plays on source radio.  
      Neil stands on the diving board, looking into the crystal 
      clear water beneath him. 

                                  ANIKA
                    It s freezing dad, don t do it.

      Reveal Anika watching from a chaise, in a jacket -- it s cold 
      out here.  Neil takes a deep breath, dives in.

      UNDERWATER -- Neil swims to the bottom, rests there for a 
      long time as if floating in space.  All SOUND DROPS OUT.

      Lungs ready to burst, Neil shoots to the surface, gasping.

                                  ANIKA (CONT D)
                    God, Dad.  I thought you were dead.

                                  NEIL
                    Me, too.

      Graces approaches, sets down a tray with mugs of hot 
      chocolate.

                                  GRACE
                    See?  We didn t need a vacation, 
                    babe.  Just a little family time 
                    around the pool.

                                  ANIKA
                    I think actually going some where 
                    warm would ve been better.

                                  GRACE
                    That s not the point, honey.
                          (off Neil)
                    I was gonna make lunch.  Who s 
                    hungry?

      Anika and Neil raise their hands.                                         Goldenrod Revisions  12/3/13  86.


                                  GRACE (CONT D)
                    Tuna fish.  Coming up.

      She turns to go.

                                  NEIL
                    Grace...
                          (she turns back)
                    You should come in.  It s not that 
                    bad.

      She lifts up her coverall, shows off a new bikini.

                                  GRACE
                    I was planning on it.

      Neil wasn t expecting that -- and he loves it.

                                  ANIKA
                    Wow, mom, you look hot.

                                  GRACE
                    I know.

      She dances into the house as Neil pushes off from the side to 
      do a few laps in water.  His cell phone RINGS.

                                  ANIKA
                    I knew it was too good to be true.  
                    You re gonna have to go into the 
                    office now, aren t you?

                                  NEIL
                    Let s just see who it is first.

      Neil hops out of the pool, grabs a towel and reaches in his 
      robe -- there are two cell phones inside -- the Red Phone is 
      ringing.  He s about to decline when he notices the number. 

                                  ANIKA
                    Well?  Who is it?

      Neil looks back toward the house, sees Grace inside on her 
      cell -- clearly she s calling Simon s number right now but 
      doesn t know it s Neil.  As Neil studies the phone, we...
