A small inflatable PONTOON BOAT races out to sea, receding 
from the Pakistani coastline.  The sun s last rays angle over 
rolling ocean.  This boat is way too small to be this far out.


SIX NAVY SEALS are in the small boat.  Full camo, smudged 
faces.  SEAL JAMES KING, 30s, scans the horizon, as another 
SEAL tears open a gauze pack, presses it down on SEAL BARRY 
HOPPER, two rounds in his chest.  A third SEAL snaps a needle 
 arm.open, jams it into Hopper s

SEAL WARRANT OFFICER GIL LANGSTON, 40s, is on the radio.

LANGSTON
Hospitality, this is Tango Five.  We 
are at the rendezvous.  Over.
(static...)
Hospitality.  This is Tango Five.  
Do you read?

He shares a look with King.  Not good.  The small boat comes 
to a stop in the middle of nowhere.

A beat...  Then the ENORMOUS FORM of the Nuclear Ballistic 
Missile Submarine U.S.S. NEVADA surfaces, directly under the 
small boat!  SEALS leap onto the deck, securing the boat.


The Nevada glides through the depths.


Camera pans over this gorgeous South Pacific island and its 
port city, SOUBOURG.  Poor and weathered, but right out of a 
Jimmy Buffet song.

CAMERA ARRIVES AT --

A brand new chain-link fence GATE with a sign:  PROPERTY OF 
THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION.  SOLDIERS ARMED Two  
at the gate, a set of GIANT SATELLITE DISHES...


The Nevada comes to a stop on the bottom at an awkward angle.


 Deville rolls down a pot-holed dirt The huge polished  70
road, turns onto the Soubourg main drag.  The car rolls past 
fishing shacks, shanty shops, and a tiny hotel for surfers and 
adventure travelers.  


The town s main bar, bait shop, general store, trading post.  
Serrat parks the Caddie in the middle of the street, gets out, 
leaving the car running.

Across the street, FOUR ARMED THUGS leap down from a pickup 
truck and follow him as he heads around the side of the bar...


A FISHING TRAWLER is pulled up to the dock behind the bar, 
laden with crates.  A small stack of crates on the dock is 
being inspected by TANI TUMBRENJAK, 20s.  Born and raised 
inland, an island native gone townie.  A natural beauty and 
 Nest, currently arguing with the new owner of the Buzzard s
 CAPTAIN, a portrait of bored corruption.the ship s

TANI
No, no.  What am I supposed to do 
with three cases of spoiled milk?  
Milk need to go in refrigeration.24.


TRAWLER CAPTAIN
The cold is extra.  You pay extra.

acknowledges Serrat in deference, points to two of his guys 
who start pulling cases out of a cooling unit...

TANI
 pick up the No, I... I ll
difference.  Thank you all the same.

Serrat looks at Tani a moment, uncomfortable.  Then he steps 
onto the boat.  His men locate a set of crates, start opening 
them.  We glimpse AK-47s, grenades, C-4...

Serrat passes them all by with a perfunctory glance, finds a 
crate with French lettering.  He opens it, gazes down.  

He rises with a small burlap bag, watches his men haul the 
other crates up towards the truck waiting on the street.

SERRAT
Can I ask you a question, Tani?  Do 
you really believe that anyone on 
this earth ever got anywhere without 
asking another person for help?  
Doesn t happen.  That s just how the 
world is.  So why are you so scared 
to take the help I offer you?  What 
do you think is going to happen?  

TANI
... Nothing, Mr. Serrat.

He finally looks over at her.  Gaze lingers.

SERRAT
Give it a try sometime then.

He leaves.  Cases of cold milk are stacked next to her.


The Nevada sits on the bottom at an awkward angle.


Christine watches the Chaplain give Emma the bad news.  
Christine sees Emma drop to her knees sobbing, as ANOTHER 
MILITARY VEHICLE now passes by and pulls into another house, 
two driveways down.  Christine knows the house.

CHRISTINE
No...

Christine turns to see a 3rd MILITARY CAR pull into her 
driveway.  Christine hugs herself tightly.  She can only shake 
 as a Chaplain and two men approach.her head  no 


The Nevada rests motionless on the ocean floor.


A FISHING BOAT bobbing on the ocean is literally PUSHED ASIDE 
as the Nevada SURFACES.  The sub plows onwards, like Moby Dick 
knocking these boats away as if it was swatting flies.

ON SHORE

Serrat walks towards his car when he hears the noise.  He 
looks out at the surf, sees the monstrous submarine plowing 
towards shore.  He stares, disbelieving.

Other locals, including 10-year-old SIDO, precocious and  
always smiling, watch in awe.

Suddenly, the hatch is open and two dozen ARMED SEAMEN make 
their way to the dock and run into the city.  

ARMED SEAMEN
Get inside!  Everyone get inside!

Serrat watches stunned, as two seamen with submachine guns 
BRUSH right past him, half spinning him around.41.


ON JAMES KING and his team of three SEALS who carry Hopper on 
a makeshift gurney.  James carries Langston in a body-bag over 
his shoulder.  James approaches Sido.

JAMES
Hey!  Speak English?
(off his nod)
 a hospital?Where s

Sido points to a DECREPIT BUILDING that looks like anything 
but a hospital to Western eyes.

JAMES (CONT D)
(to the Seals)
Take him.

The Seals run off with Hopper.

JAMES (CONT D)
Got one last question for you, kid.


A LOUD WHIRRING SOUND as a door opens on the sub and then an 
ICBM MISSILE flies up and into the sky.  

ON SHORE people watch.  Sido follows the smoke trail.


Peaceful.  For the moment.52.



A family of four walks, the Washington Monument in the 
background.  The youngest boy looks up and sees --

A STREAK OF LIGHT IN THE SKY.


MISSILE P.O.V. as it hurtles toward the ocean at incredible 
speed.  It hits --


A BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHT and a massive explosion.  People 
gather and look in horror.  From the lower tip of Manhattan, 
the fiery MUSHROOM CLOUD lights up the Statue of Liberty.54.



Serrat pulls up in his Deville.  A gorgeous residence in the 
hills, view of the ocean, but a fortress.  ARMED GUARDS inside 
and out.  German Shepherds on leashes.  Three GORGEOUS WOMEN 
in bikinis lounge by the pool.56.



Sam stands on the railing looking out onto Soubourg as the sun 
sets into the ocean.  The huge shape of the Nevada FLOATS in 
the bay.  The town looks peaceful from this vantage point. 
Marcus appears next to Sam.  Silence for a moment, then --

SAM
Was wondering about Christine, what 
she must be thinking.  I keep 
running it in my head.  Something we 
missed?  Something we should have 
done differently?  Anything?

MARCUS
They tried to kill us, Sam.  For 
 the country I grew up what?  Where s

(re: Soubourg)
We could do better right here, 
starting from scratch.

Sam stares at Marcus, doubt creeping in.

SAM
Everything we did today... it was to 
stay alive long enough to get our 
names cleared and to get home.

A beat.

MARCUS
Maybe this is home now.

As Sam stares at Marcus, the horror of that sinking in --
