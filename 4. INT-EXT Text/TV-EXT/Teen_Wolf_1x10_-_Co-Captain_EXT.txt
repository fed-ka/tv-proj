      glow focuses into a bank of SPOTLIGHTS over the lacrosse 
      field, a CHANT rises up.

      Fists reach into the light, pumping in unison. Amidst the 
      rush of fans crowding the team at the benches, only one face 
      doesn t seem ecstatic over the win: Scott McCall.


      Someone steps through the woods, boots crushing leaves 
      underneath her. LAURA HALE looks through the shadows to see--            TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/116.

      A STRANGE FIGURE in a hospital robe standing between the

      covered in horrible burns.

      She steps toward him, reaching for him while he gazes back at 
      her almost in a trance. And then he opens his mouth revealing 
      razor-sharp FANGS as--


      Spiraling down from the night sky, we find Scott and Stiles 
      circling a grave where Laura s body has been unearthed. They

      The Porsche coasts onto the grass and lumbers to a dead stop. 
      Jackson turns the key several times, but all he hears from 
      the engine is a useless CLICKING.

      Stepping out of the car, he SLAMS the door shut.

                    Son of a bitch.

      He walks around to the rear of the car where the engine is 
      located, but slows his pace when--

      He notices the odd quiet and isolation. No houses in sight. 
      No other cars on the road.

      Now somewhat nervous, he opens the rear engine compartment. 
      But like most people he just stares at the engine, 
        dumbfounded. Reaching to close it, he hears the sound of 
      another VEHICLE approaching. 

      A familiar SUV pulls to the shoulder of the road just behind *
      his Porsche. Argent steps out and offers a friendly smile.

      Through a mist-shrouded trail, a shivering Lydia reluctantly 
      follows Allison into the woods.

                    We should be good here. It s

      Inside the bag she reveals a BOW and QUIVER of ARROWS. Lydia 
      looks down at it. Looks around to see the two of them are 
      indeed completely isolated. Then gives a nervous LAUGH.


      Argent takes a look at the engine at the rear of Jackson s

                    I know a few things about cars.

                    I don t know. This is a pretty

                    It s Jackson, right? Come here.  
                    I ll show you what to look for.

      He reaches out, hand moving to the middle of Jackson s back 
      to press him forward. But then, with clear calculation, 
      Argent s hand glides up to the back of the boy s neck.

      Lydia hugs herself in the cold while Allison comes back to 
      her with the charred target in hand.

                    Well, that was fun. Any other 
                    lethal weapons you want to try out?

      But Allison stops. Cocking her head, she listens to the woods 
      around them. A moment later, they both hear it. MOVEMENT 
      through the brush and leaves.

                                  LYDIA (CONT D)
                    What was that?

      But now there s nothing. Not a sound.

                    Hold this.

      She hands the bow to Lydia. 

                                  LYDIA
                    What? Why?

                                    ALLISON
                    I thought I heard something.

                                  LYDIA
                    So what if you heard something?

                                    ALLISON
                    So I want to go find out what that 
                    something is. Don t worry, it s 
                    probably nothing.

                    that something is something

      Without another word, Allison takes off, leaving Lydia to 
      look utterly ridiculous while grasping at the weapon with her 
      mittens.

      VENTURING OFF THE TRAIL - Allison moves quickly but quietly.

      SOMETHING slips through the brush just near her. She stops at 
      the sound. Then retreats a step, pulling back against a tree. 
      Breath held, she slowly steps away and--

      SPINS back with the TASER X26 in her hands. She FIRES it, 
      TWIN PRONGS SOARING through the air and landing on--

      Scott. 

      He jerks back and falls to the ground with the STRANGLED CRY 
      of someone being pummeled with 50 thousand volts of 
        electricity.

                                    ALLISON
                    Scott?

      Rushing over, she attempts to pull out the prongs, but he s 
      still convulsing with spasms.

                        Finger--trigger--finger.

      Allison notices she still has her finger on the trigger, 
      still sending an electric charge into his shuddering body.

                                    ALLISON
                    Oh!

      She opens her hand, dropping the weapon to the ground. 
      Finally, Scott breathes, his body relaxing into the leaves.

      He plucks the prongs out of his shirt and skin, wincing in 
      pain. Then, helping gather up the wires and the Taser, he s 
      about to hand it back to her when--

      His body has another UNCONTROLLABLE CONVULSION. The Taser 
      launches right out of his grasp. Allison manages to catch it, 
      glancing back to him with an unsure smile.

                    you run this trail sometimes. I was 
                    kind of just hoping to catch you

      With a relieved breath, Allison takes the necklace.

                    Oh, thank God. I was starting to 
                    think it had been stolen.

                                  SCOTT
                    No, nope, just lost. Definitely not 
                    stolen. By anyone.

      He watches her slip the pendant around her neck and pull her 
      hair through the chain. When she looks up at him again, he 
      remembers to breathe.

                                    ALLISON
                    Thank you for finding this. And for

                    No, you re just weird. Like you 
                    always are.

      She slips her arms around him to hug him. He holds her back, 
      holding just a little too long. 

      Allison finally breaks away. Trying not to look back, she 
      hurries off, leaving Scott in the woods. Alone again.

      trying to load and nock an arrow, but clearly has no idea

      Realization dawning on him, Scott slowly steps back. Then 
      turns on his heels to run for it. Hurtling off the road, he 
      races not for his own life. But for Jackson s.


      Jackson walks just ahead of Derek. His excited anticipation,

                    It s safe to go in? I don t want 
                    rafters falling on my head.

      Jackson takes a hard swallow, then inches his way up the 
      steps. He glances back yet again. But Derek simply nods him 
      onward.

      Reaching for the doorknob, Jackson pauses to notice just how 
      badly his hand trembles.

                      Everything you want. Just go in.

      Hand on the knob, Jackson turns it and slowly pushes the door 
      open. He doesn t step in yet, trying to peer into the 
      darkness. But he can t seem to make anything out inside.

      A creak of a floorboard makes him flinch. Derek steps up 
      behind him, his voice soft. Friendly.

                    It s going to be all right. Trust 
                    me.

      Finally, Jackson steps over the threshold.


      Jackson runs for his life, charging blindly into the 
      darkness. He never looks back to see Scott stumbling after 
      him.


      Still running, still trying to escape deeper into the woods, 
      Scott finally tumbles to his knees. He lurches up, BLACK 
      LIQUID at his lips. His body trying to heal itself. Trying 
      and failing.

      Crawling forward, he pushes himself up from the leaves and 
      dirt making one last attempt to get back to his feet. 

      But then he falls forward again. Rolling slowly onto his 
      back, the world above starts to blur.          TEEN WOLF "Episode 110"BLUE DRAFT2/13/1143.
