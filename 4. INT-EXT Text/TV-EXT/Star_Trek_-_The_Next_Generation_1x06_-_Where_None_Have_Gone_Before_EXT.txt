 
        The two Federation starships come slowly together. 
        Here, next to the smaller vessel, the size of the new 
        Enterprise is breathtaking.

            Captain's log, Stardate 41263.1. 
            We have rendezvoused with the 
            USS Fearless from which... 


        as the ship reaches warp speed. 


        The great ship leaps forward with a WARP SPEED EFFECT 
        ON TOP OF A WARP SPEED EFFECT. 


        as the starship slows from HYPER-SPEED EFFECT to normal 
        velocity. (What we'll see of Space matches what we'll 
        end up with in Scene 38.) 


        coming to a stop. 


        Past what looks to be a "normal" sized planet, a huge 
        section of space is dominated by an immense cloud of 
        luminous gas and space dust. As indicated by the size 
        of the planet in f.g., a really BIG cloud! A star is 
        forming and when complete, and this one will have a mass 
        100 times greater than our own sun.

            Captain's log, stardate 41263.2. 
            This will be a rather unusual log 
            entry, assuming Starfleet ever 
            receives it. As I have already 
            informed my crew... 


        It disappears. But this time it is a kind of speed 
        unlike anything ever seen. 


        This time, multiples on top of multiples of the WARP 
        SPEED EFFECT.

        In this bizarre pattern of hyper-space.

            Captain's log Stardate 41263.3. 
            Instead of returning to our own 
            galaxy... 

 
        A place where the universe begins? A place where it 
        ends? 

                PICARD (V.O.) 
              (continuing) 
            ... the Enterprise has gone forward 
            to a place in the universe which 
            is uncharted and unknown. Our 
            ship's instruments... 


        Picard STEPPING OUT into the corridor to find everything 
        normal. 


        at the unknown part of the universe as described. 

                PICARD (V.O.) 
            Captain's log, supplemental. Our 
            position is unknown and our only 
            chance of returning to the known 
            universe is a dying alien... 


        as before. 

                PICARD (V.O.) 
            Captain's log, any time entry is 
            meaningless. We have no choice 
            but to repeat the same warp 
            experiment... 


        the balance of our regulars at their positions. 

                PICARD (V.O.) 
              (continuing) 
            ... we understand only that the 
            Traveler makes use of this 
            somehow. It will be most 
            important that those aboard avoid 
            random thoughts that might change 
            the reality of what we're 
            attempting to do. 

        Picard turns to Troi.

            Any further advice, Counselor?

            When you begin the attempt, there 
            will be stress... And it's only 
            natural that the crew's 
            concentration will shift. 

                TASHA 
            Plus some genuine fear, Captain. 
            You can't notice what's outside 
            without feeling some of that. 

        Picard nods, reaches to touch a control. His VOICE 
        BECOMES AMPLIFIED. 

                PICARD 
            ALL DECKS, THIS IS THE CAPTAIN 
            SPEAKING. ALL DECKS... 


        There is an explosion of speed -- but not as much as we 
        saw when coming out here. 


        It happens. The same effect that brought the ship out 
        here.            STAR TREK: "Where None... " -- REV. 7/31/87 -- ACT FIVE       55. 
 

        Coming out of a MIXED WARP SPEED EFFECT to travel normal
