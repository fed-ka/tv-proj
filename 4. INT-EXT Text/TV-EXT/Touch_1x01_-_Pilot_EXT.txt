      We CRANE UP and OVER the metal crow's nest to reveal --                                                                                        7.

      JAKE 

      sitting crossed legged, still writing NUMBERS in his NOTEBOOK. 
      (We realize that this is where he was in the opening montage). 
      We're somewhere way the hell on the outskirts of the city. 
      Open fields stretch for a mile to the nearest suburb.

      CAR TIRES

      SKID to a stop.  WIDEN as Martin swings the car door open
      and RISES into a CLOSE UP.  He looks up to see Jake perched
      on the crow's nest a hundred feet up this CELL TOWER.  

                                      MARTIN
                          (exasperated)
                    Dammit... Jake.

      Two COP CARS and a FIRE TRUCK are already here, a few
      ONLOOKERS.  

      A FIREMAN makes his way up the precarious metal LADDER that
      rises up the tower.  

      Another CAR pulls to a stop next to Martin's.  Out steps a
      doughy looking guy whom we'll call SCHOOL COUNSELOR.  Martin
      looks at the Counselor with disdain. 

                                      SCHOOL COUNSELOR
                          (fumbling to explain)
                    I don't know how this happened again.  

                                      MARTIN
                    I'm paying good money to keep my son
                    safe at your school.  Are you grasping
                    the irony of that? 

                                      SCHOOL COUNSELOR
                    That's just it, Mr. Bohm, the money
                    isn't good enough.  

      Martin just glowers at the Counselor, then reaches back into
      his car to the BOX of used cell phones.  Grabs a FEW and
      shoves them into his jacket pocket and takes off running
      toward the tower.  Yells up at the FIREMEN -- 

                                      MARTIN
                    Wait!  Don't come near him!

      They turn to see Martin approaching.  One of the COPS shakes
      his head disgusted.

                                    COP
                    You got any idea what that kid of
                    yours is costing the tax payers?                                                                                          8.

      In the b.g.  A CELL COMPANY WORKMAN climbs out of his truck
      and approaches quickly.  

                                      MARTIN
                    You didn't have to call the fire
                      department this time.  

                                    COP
                    The hell I didn't.  I've wasted half
                    a day waiting for him to crawl down.  

                                      MARTIN
                          (re: the Fireman)
                    Well he's not coming down at all if
                    that guy gets near him.  I told you,
                    no one can touch him.  You have to
                    let me get him down. 

                                    COP
                    And take the chance of both of you
                    falling?  Forget it.

                                      MARTIN
                    I didn't say I was going up there. 
                    I'm scared of heights.  Don't worry,
                    I have another idea.

      Martin looks at the Cop pleadingly.  The Workman arrives and
      breaks the tension.  

                                      WORKMAN
                    I just changed the combination lock. 
                    How'd he get through it again?!

      Martin stares at the Cop, who finally relents.  Turns and
      YELLS up to the FIREMAN, now halfway up the tower.

                                    COP
                    Come on back down, Lenny!  The kid's
                    dad is here!

      Lenny, the Fireman halfway up the tower, looks back down at
      them.  Shrugs, and starts back down the ladder.  Martin
      approaches the foot of the ladder.  Cranes his neck.

                                      MARTIN
                          (calmly)
                    Jake?!  Come on down now, okay buddy?!

      ON THE CROW'S NEST

      Jake finally stops his single minded focus on filling in
      NUMBERS in the notebook and looks down to see his father at
      the foot of the tower.  His expression betrays nothing.                                                                                          9.

      MARTIN

      reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out the USED CELL
      PHONES that he got from the box.  Holds them up.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    Got a present for you!  See?!

      Martin waves the phones over his head.

      JAKE

      blinks a couple of times.  Cocks his head to the side.  Then
      a small, almost imperceptive smile curls to his lips.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

      THE BASE OF THE TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

      Jake climbs off the ladder and approaches Martin with a blank
      stare.  Martin calmly hands him the cell phones as promised. 
      The Firemen and Cops all exchange looks, what the hell...?  

      Jake takes the phones and saunters slowly off towards his
      dad's car, staring down at the cell phones.  He passes the
      School Counselor, who stares sheepishly before approaching. 
      When Martin sees him coming he turns and walks away.

                                      SCHOOL COUNSELOR
                    Mr. Bohm, please!  
                          (Martin doesn't stop)
                    We can no longer float your payments! 

      Martin stops.  Turns back. 

                                      SCHOOL COUNSELOR (CONT'D)
                    I know it's been hard since you lost
                    your job.

                                      MARTIN
                          (snaps)
                    I have a job.

                                      SCHOOL COUNSELOR
                          (snaps back)
                    You've had ten jobs!
                          (after a beat)
                    In two years... 

      Martin just stares.  The truth stings.

                                      SCHOOL COUNSELOR (CONT'D)
                    I wish you luck with your son.                                                                                        10.

      And with that, he turns and walks off.  Martin stares for a
      beat, then the Workman approaches.

                                      WORKMAN
                    Lucky there wasn't no rain today. 
                    That thing gets wet he coulda gone
                    up like a torch.

      The Workman shakes his head and turns to walk off, then --  

                                      WORKMAN (CONT'D)
                    Does the time 3:18 mean something
                    special to that kid?

      Martin's answer is a blank stare.

                                      WORKMAN (CONT'D)
                    All three times he's tripped the
                    alarm on the security system at
                    exactly 3:18.  Some kinda weird
                      coincidence.  

      Martin stares for a beat, then without expression --

                                      MARTIN
                    I don't know anything about that.

      The Cop approaches Martin.  He pulls out a CITATION BOOK and
      pen.  Flips it open -- 

                                    COP
                    I'm gonna have to report him this
                    time.  This has to stop.

      Martin sighs and looks back at Jake, making his way to the
      car, oblivious to the havoc he's wreaked.  Then looks back
      at the Cop, nods, sadly resolved --

                                      MARTIN
                    Yeah... I know.  


      We DRIFT DOWN from the darkening sky to find Martin and Jake
      arriving at a grave.  

      ON THE GRAVESTONE 

      The name  Emily Bohm - April 3, 1968 - September 11, 2001 .  

      We TILT DOWN and find a METAL BADGE has been placed on the
      grave.  Martin bends down and picks up the badge.    

      CLOSE ON THE BADGE

      New York Fire Department.  "STATION 318".  Martin turns to
      see that Jake is looking at it with interest.  He holds it
      out to Jake, who takes it.  Then opens his notebook and jots
      down the number "318", CIRCLES it.  

      Martin stares back down at the grave.  There's no sadness in
      his eyes.  No self pity.  In fact there's nothing.  


      A Hopper-esque WIDE SHOT.  Martin fills the car with gas.  

      INSIDE THE CAR

      Jake plays with his phones.  He looks up and out the window --

      At a SCHOOL BUS parked in the parking lot.  The BUS DRIVER
      tends to an overheating engine.  KIDS in the bus play inside.  

      CLOSE ON JAKE 

      staring out the window at the other KIDS - the gap between
      their normalcy and him is huge.  

      MARTIN

      finishes filling the car, returns the nozzle to the pump. 
      Then notices Jake staring at the school bus.  He notes the
      intensity of Jake's stare. 

      Suddenly, Jake climbs out of the car, NOTEBOOK in hand, and
      makes a bee line for the back of the bus. 

      AT THE BUS

      Some of the KIDS notice Jake and begin to HECKLE him for his
      obviously strange demeanor.   Hey freak, stay away from our
      bus ... etc.  Undaunted, Jake MOVES to the back of the bus
      and opens his notebook, quickly scrawls down the license
      plate number.                                                                                        14.

      Martin hurries over to retrieve him.  

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    Jake, come on now, let's leave the
                    bus alone, okay?

      But Jake seems transfixed by the license plate.  The BUS
      DRIVER has now noticed.  

                                    BUS DRIVER
                    He okay?

                                      MARTIN
                    Yeah.  Just got a thing about school
                    buses lately.  
                          (to Jake)
                    Tell you what, I bet they've got
                    Fanta at the store here.  You'd like
                    that, right?  Come on, I'll get you
                    a Fanta.

      But Jake just continues to stare at the license plate.  Martin
      finally follows his gaze to it.    

      CLOSE ON THE LICENSE PLATE

      The last three digits are 318.

      Martin's eyes narrow with a recognition.  He stares for a
      beat, then looks down at Jake, still transfixed by these
      numbers, and we --

                                                                                CUT TO: 


      And heads for the car.  Jake climbs in and SLAMS the door.  

      PONYTAIL 

      stumbles out of the mini-mart and lumbers after him.  

                                      PONYTAIL
                    You little fuckin shithead!  

      Ponytail slides to a stop at the car and tries to open the
      door.  Jake has locked it. 

                                      PONYTAIL (CONT'D)
                    Give me back my goddamn ticket!

      Martin now comes running up to the car.

                                      MARTIN
                    I'm sorry, I'll take care of this.

                                      PONYTAIL
                          (pissed)
                    You'd better take care of it.  

                                      MARTIN
                          (feigning calm)
                    Open the door, Jake.  

      Martin looks inside and sees Jake feverishly WRITING down
      the lottery numbers into his NOTEBOOK.  

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    Jake!  Open up.

      Ponytail POUNDS his fist on the window.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    Hey!  I told you I'll take care of
                    this.  

                                      PONYTAIL
                    Yeah, I'm waiting.                                                                                        16.

                                      MARTIN
                    Jake.  Come on, open up the door.

                                      PONYTAIL
                    I swear to God, kid... I'm counting
                    to three.  One... Two...

                                      MARTIN
                    You touch my car again and I'll--!

      CLICK.  The door opens.  Jake steps out.  Hands the ticket
      calmly to Martin.  Ponytail YANKS it out of his hand.  

                                      PONYTAIL
                    You oughta keep that kid in a cage.

      He turns to walk away, but Martin snaps.  Grabs Ponytail by
      the shoulder and spins him around.  

                                      MARTIN
                    What did you say?!

      Ponytail reacts, and in one fluid motion PUNCHES Martin in
      the gut, doubling him over in pain and dropping him to one
      knee.  And with that, Ponytail walks away.  Martin winces as
      he GASPS for air.  Looks over to see Jake obliviously staring
      at the lottery numbers in his notebook.  

      Martin is at a complete loss.  We SNAP back to the Hopper-
      esque tableau again, and --


      Kate sits on the curb, sipping her Fanta.  Niles sits.  

                                      NILES
                    How is it you always end up sitting

                    It's the obvious place to ruminate

                    A little reality check here, Niles. 
                    I'm singing in a Karaoke lounge at

                    of my life.  I always thought I'd
                    make some kind of impact, some kind
                    of difference.  But that's never

                    he gave it to me to charge.  Turns
                    out the phone is some kinda viral

      Kate looks at him, incredulous.

                                    KATE
                    So, let me get this straight.  There's
                    a video of me in that phone singing
                    at a karaoke bar on the outskirts of
                    Galway, Ireland.

                                      NILES
                    Yes.

                    And you're going to send that phone
                    out into the ether and people are
                    going to find it and discover me.

                                      NILES
                            (matter-of-fact)

                          (total confidence)
                    Exactly.

      Kate stares at him.  Then abruptly stands.

                                    KATE
                    I'll see you tomorrow.

      And she walks off.  

                                      NILES
                    You'll see!  Big star!  Viral
                      marketing!  Can't fail!

      But she just keeps walking.  He looks down at the phone in
      his hand, wondering what to do next.  Just then, A JAPANESE
      BUSINESSMAN comes out of the lounge, rolling a SUITCASE behind
      him. 

      He walks right past Niles and approaches a parked TAXI, twenty
      feet away.  Sets his suitcase down at the trunk of the car
      and walks to the driver's side to negotiate with the driver.                                                                                          20.

      Niles' eyes narrow with an idea.  He quickly stands and
      hurries to the suitcase.  He unzips the front pocket.  (We
      NOTE that the zipper has an ID TAG attached to it with a
      JAPANESE FLAG emblazoned on it.)  

      Niles slips the CARE BEARS PHONE into the pocket and quickly
      ZIPS it back up, just as the trunk POPS open.  

      The Japanese Businessman walks to the back of the car as
      Niles nonchalantly stands and folds his arms, pretending to
      be a disinterested pedestrian.  He quickly walks off, watching 
      the Japanese Businessman load the suitcase into the trunk.   

      Off Niles' self-satisfied look --


      Abdul and Tarik walk down this dilapidated street.  Eight
      years of war show on the face of it.  (Italics = Arabic)

                                      ABDUL
                    It sucks royally.  My dad will have
                    to go back to Mosel to get work with
                    his brother.  Without the oven we
                    lose everything.

                                      TARIK
                    So how much is a new oven?

                                      ABDUL
                    A lot.  Like eight hundred thousand
                    dinar.  Might as well be a billion.  

      Tarik comes to a stop, looks off down the sidewalk.

                                      TARIK
                    There's only one way I know to make
                    eight hundred thousand dinar.                                                                                         31.

      Tarik gestures with his chin.  Abdul follows his gaze to the
      end of the block, where --

      TWO MEN wearing JALABIYAS and Muslim headgear, stand in front
      of cafe, conferring closely with one another.  There's
      something nefarious about their demeanor.  Alright, I'll say
      it.  They look like TERRORISTS.  

      Abdul stares at the two men.  One of them turns and seems to
      look right at Abdul.  He's wearing MIRRORED RAY BANS.  A
      chill runs down Abdul's spine. 

                                      ABDUL
                    Oh sure, I'll volunteer to blow myself
                    up.  There's a genius idea.

                                      TARIK
                    Your parents would have the cash by
                      nightfall.  

      Abdul looks at him, and Tarik starts to laugh, breaking the
      tension of this absurd idea.  Abdul just keeps walking.  

                                      ABDUL
                    I'm serious, can we focus on how I'm
                    going to buy a new oven? 

                                      TARIK
                          (getting an idea)
                    Maybe you don't HAVE to buy it. 

                                      ABDUL
                    Right, cuz you just happen to have
                    an oven lying around.  

                                      TARIK
                    I'm not saying it would be easy to
                    get the oven in question, I'm just
                    saying I know where one can be gotten.

                                      ABDUL
                    Are we gonna play 20 questions or
                    are you gonna tell me.

                                      TARIK
                    Hassam's.

      And he just lets that sit there.

                                      ABDUL
                      Hassam's... the restaurant?  The one
                    with the funny guy who tells the
                    jokes?

                                      ABDUL (CONT'D)
                          (off Tarik nods)
                    Doesn't Hassam's need an oven if
                    it's going to continue to be a
                      restaurant?

                                      TARIK
                    I'm just saying... I know where Moshe
                    Hassam keeps his key when he closes
                    up at night.  Right on top of the
                    door sill so the butcher, who just
                    happens to be my cousin, can make
                    his delivery in the morning before
                    he opens. 

                                      ABDUL
                    You're saying we steal Hassam's oven?  

                                      TARIK
                    You asked me if I knew where you
                    could get an oven.

                                      ABDUL
                    That's insane.  And so are you! 
                          (starts to walk)
                    They'd cut our hands off in the town
                    square if we got caught. 

                                      TARIK
                    Hey, don't blame me, I'm just the
                    guy with the solution!  

      Abdul stops.  A long beat before he turns back around.  Stares
      at Tarik.  Finally --

                                      ABDUL
                    What time did you say he closes up?


      An old row house.  Working class would be generous.  Martin
      stands on the porch, his finger hovering over the doorbell. 
      A moment of hesitation, then -- RINGS the doorbell.  

      A beat, the door opens, revealing BORIS PODOLSKY.  A shadow
      of the man on the Charlie Rose Show.  Scruffy, two week growth
      on his face, bathrobe.  He scowls at Martin --                                                                                        41.

                                      PODOLSKY (CONT'D)
                    What do you want?

                                      MARTIN
                          (awkward)
                    Hi... I saw you on Charlie Rose.   

                                      PODOLSKY
                    Uh huh.

                                      MARTIN
                    I'm looking for the Podolsky
                      institute.
                          (shit)
                    I think maybe I have the wrong...

                                      PODOLSKY
                    L'me guess... your kid keeps climbing
                    up a cell tower.

                                      MARTIN
                          (stunned)
                    How did you...?

                                      PODOLSKY
                    Once or twice a year you people find
                    me.  

      Podolsky swings open the door and walks into the house.

                                      PODOLSKY (CONT'D)
                          (over his shoulder)
                    You coming in or not?

      Off Martin's amazement --


      RAIN pours down as Clea leans against a parking meter
      impatiently under an umbrella.  She looks up to see Martin
      come out of the station.  He glances up at her and lowers
      his eyes and just starts walking.  She rushes to catch up.

                                    CLEA
                    They said you got in a fight over a
                    phone.  So you found it?                                                                                        54.

                                      MARTIN
                            (matter-of-fact)
                    Yeah.  I found it.  

                                    CLEA
                    Well... what happened?

                                      MARTIN
                    Nothing happened.  Except I had time
                    in there to think about how insane
                    it was to believe that any of this
                    meant anything... that I was going
                    to find some kind of closure or
                      redemption.  He can't connect to me. 
                    He never will.  You were right.  It
                    was wish fulfillment.  

      Clea looks crestfallen.  

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry I dragged you into this.   

      With that, Martin heads across the street, leaving Clea to
      watch him go.  He turns back --

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    I'm not going to fight the custody
                    for Jake.  I'll come by tomorrow to
                    sign the papers.

      Off Clea, her eyes awash with conflicting emotions --


      Abdul and Tarik stand in the shadows near a truck.  They
      peer around the edge to see --

      HASSAM'S

      a neighborhood RESTAURANT down the street.  Abdul looks at
      it with trepidation in his eyes.  (Again, Italics = Arabic).

                                      ABDUL
                    Moshe Hassam...  That's Jewish, right?

                                      TARIK
                    I don't know.  I guess.  

      Abdul thinks about it a bit.  Then --

                                      ABDUL
                    You ever notice that Jews are funny? 

      Tarik just stares at him.                                                                                        55.

                                      TARIK
                    Jews are funny?

                                      ABDUL
                    Jews are funny.  It's part of their
                    culture.  We're not funny.  There's
                    tons of Jewish comedians.  Why aren't
                    there any Iraqi comedians?

      Tarik looks at him like he's nuts, then --

                                      TARIK
                    Look around.  You see anything funny
                    about living in Iraq?

      He gives Abdul an "I rest my case" look.  

                                      TARIK (CONT'D)
                    You want to be funny, maybe you should
                    become a Jew.

      Abdul looks at him, then smiles.

                                      ABDUL
                    You see, now that's funny.  

      And he pats Tarik on the back, but Tarik stops him with a
      SHHHH, and points towards the restaurant, where --

      MOSHE HASSAM, short, balding, a gentle looking man, comes
      out with his five year old DAUGHTER.  She hovers by his legs
      as he lowers the grate on the restaurant door.  He LOCKS the
      PADLOCK and looks around suspiciously in all directions before
      placing the KEY on ledge above the door.  

      Then hoists his daughter up onto his shoulders and starts
      walking towards --

      ABDUL AND TARIK, 

      who duck back behind the truck to wait for Hassam to pass. 
      As he does, Hassam's daughter looks right at Abdul.  Something
      silent passes between them.  She finally smiles and waves to
      him.  Abdul gives a half hearted wave back.   

      When they pass, Tarik stands.  

                                      TARIK
                    Okay.  So, we go get my cousin's
                    truck and we wait until just before
                    curfew.  We carry out the oven and
                    drive it to your house.  Easy peasy.  

      But Abdul is still watching Hassam and his daughter round
      the corner.  He lowers his eyes.                                                                                        56.

                                      ABDUL
                    It isn't right.  I can't do this. 
                    I'm not a thief.  And you should be
                    ashamed of yourself.  

      Tarik shrugs.

                                      TARIK
                    I was just trying to help.

                                      ABDUL
                    I know.  But I need to figure this
                    out by myself.  

      He starts to walk.  

                                      ABDUL (CONT'D)
                          (over his shoulder)
                    I'll see you tomorrow.  

      Off Tarik, watching his friend walk away.


      Abdul walks slowly, deep in thought.  He rounds a corner. 
      Tears in his eyes.  He stops.  Slumps down to the curb. 
      Puts his head in his hands.  A long beat, then looks up. 
      Wipes his tears, ashamed and angry at his emotions.  

      He looks up and spots something.  His eyes narrow, transfixed
      by what he's looking at it.  And now we see it.

      RAY BANS AND HIS PARTNER 

      sitting at a cafe table speaking animatedly to one another.  

      As Abdul stares at them, we SLOWLY PUSH IN on his eyes, as a
      steely resolve takes root --


      Tokyo's version of Times Square.  We've all seen it before, 
      lit up with giant JUMBOTRONS and massive pedestrian
      crosswalks.  Simon leans against a building, as great hordes
      of HUMANITY wash past him.  He's talking on a cell phone.

                                      SIMON
                    Simon Plimpton, 44-773-9879-934.  


      TIGHT ON ABDUL'S FACE 

      He's sweating.  Looks pale and agitated, like he's about to
      leap out of his skin.  We ARM AROUND him to reveal that we're
      in the middle of --

      A CROWDED OUTDOOR MARKETPLACE

      HUNDREDS of PEOPLE shop at open stalls.  Abdul moves slowly
      toward the middle of the crowd.  Suddenly, RIIIINNNNGGG!

      Abdul GASPS and FREEZES, his eyes WIDE.  He looks down at
      his chest, covered by a jacket, zipped up high.  RIIINNNNGGG!  

      Abdul moves quickly behind a stall.  Fumbles to unzip his
      jacket to reveal a VEST FULL OF EXPLOSIVES!!  

      Right in the middle of the vest, WIRES protruding from it,
      is the CARE BEARS PHONE!  It's the bomb's DETONATOR.  

      It RINGS again and Abdul finally reaches down and carefully
      lifts the phone.  He pulls it towards his face, still attached
      to its umbilical of RED and BLUE WIRES.  

      He winces in anticipation as he presses the "answer" button,
      inches from his face.  And over the tiny speaker we HEAR --

                                    KATE (O.S.)
                    Hello?  Is anyone there?

                                      ABDUL
                          (cautious, in English)
                    Who is this?

      INTERCUT WITH KATE

                                    KATE
                    Sir, it seems you're using a phone
                    that doesn't belong to you. 

                                      ABDUL
                          (numbly)
                    They just put it on me... I don't...

                                    KATE
                    Sir?                                                                                        62.

                                      ABDUL
                    To explode the bomb.

      Kate blinks, unsure that she just heard that right --

                                    KATE
                    I'm sorry, did you say...?

                                      ABDUL
                    A bomb.  The phone, it's the
                      detonator. 

      Kate sits up.  Oh shit!

                                    KATE
                    Sir, where are you?

                                      ABDUL
                    I am not a bad person.  When you
                    hear about this on the news you will
                    tell people I wasn't a bad person. 
                    Yes?  

                                    KATE
                    No, you can't do this.  You have to
                    stop.

                                      ABDUL
                    I have no choice.

                                    KATE
                    We always have a choice.  Think of
                    the lives... the people...  And if
                    you can't think about that then think
                    about yourself.  You must have a
                    life you dream about, a future--

                                      ABDUL
                    Dreams!  I have no dreams.  I'm a
                    fool.  I wanted to be a comedian. 
                    Like Chris Rock. 

                                    KATE
                    I love Chris Rock.  

      This gets Abdul's attention.  

                                    KATE (CONT'D)
                    We're all fools for our dreams. 
                    Maybe someone can help you reach
                    yours.

                                      ABDUL
                          (snaps)
                    No.  No one can.                                                                                        63.

                                    KATE
                    I mean, what would it take?  What
                    would make you not want to blow people
                    up?

      Abdul stops and actually thinks about it for a moment.

                                      ABDUL
                    A new oven.  

      Kate's eyes narrow at this non sequitur.  

                                    KATE
                    An oven.

                                      ABDUL
                    For my family.

      Then... the nickel drops --  

                                    KATE
                      Restaurant supplies.

                                      ABDUL
                    What?

                                    KATE
                    I know someone who can get you an
                    oven.  

      Abdul's eyes widen a little at this... Is she serious?

                                    KATE (CONT'D)
                    So here's what we're going to do. 
                    I'm going to disconnect this phone
                    now so it can't detonate anything. 
                    And you're going get yourself out of
                    this situation and call me back when
                    it's safe.  Do you understand me?

      Off Abdul's eyes, narrowing --


      Simon is still here, but now he's turned and staring up at -- 

      THE GIANT JUMBOTRON, 

      where we see a series of family PHOTOS in a SLIDE SHOW, one
      after another.  And it doesn't take us long to realize that
      Simon is in some of these photos with Nell and a six year
      old GIRL, whom we presume is his DAUGHTER.  This is the
      contents of his phone playing on the JUMBOTRON!                                                                                        64.

      One of the PHOTOS FREEZES on an image of the three of them
      on the beach together.  A happier time.  It's a like a Kodak
      moment on this fifty foot screen.

      He stares with a gaping, stunned expression, his phone still
      pressed to his ear.  Then, bursting through the tiny speaker --

                                    KATE
                    Mr. Plimpton.  I found your phone!  

      But Simon just continues to stare, tears in his eyes.

                                    KATE (CONT'D)
                    Mr. Plimpton?

      And off Simon, finally finding closure -- 


      The STORM is at full strength, POUNDING RAIN,  HOWLING WIND.

      JAKE 

      stands precariously on the edge of the crow's nest.  He stares
      up at the sky, the rain hitting his face.

                                    JAKE (V.O.)
                    There is an ancient Chinese myth
                    called the Red Thread of Fate...  


      A FRONT DOOR

      opens, revealing NELL PLIMPTON.  She stares placidly.  

      We REVERSE to find Simon standing in the doorway.  He holds
      up the CARE BEARS PHONE, gives a slightly sad shrug.  Nell
      looks at him, and we see the briefest of detente in her eyes.                                                                                           66.

                                    JAKE (V.O.)
                    This thread may stretch or tangle,
                    but it will never break. 


      Randy Burke (Ponytail) stands in line to get on a bus, his
      suitcase at his side.  He hands the bus driver his ticket
      and climbs onto the bus.  

                                    JAKE (V.O.)
                    I'd like to believe that's true.  

      We MOVE past the sign above windshield that reads "Louisville
      Kentucky", as Randy makes his way to a window seat.  And as
      he stares out the window, we --

                                                                    DISSOLVE BACK TO:

      JAKE ON THE TOWER

      the wind and rain on his face, staring up to the sky.

      MARTIN'S CAR 

      SLIDES to a stop in front of the tower.  The doors swing
      open and Martin and Clea climb out.  

      Martin looks up to see Jake on the tower --

                                    CLEA
                    My god... What's he doing up there...?

      Right on cue, a LIGHTNING STRIKE LIGHTS UP the sky and THUNDER
      EXPLODES.  

      Martin and Clea exchange a look and take off RUNNING to the
      base of the tower.  The CAMERA RUNS with them.  

                                      MARTIN
                    Jake!!  Come on down, buddy!  You
                    hear me?!!

      But Jake doesn't even look his way.  He just keeps staring
      up.  

      Martin reaches into his pocket and pulls out his CELL PHONE,
      holds it up over his head.  

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    I've got a phone for you, Jake!! 
                    Just come on down and get it!

      Still no response.                                                                                        67.

                                    CLEA
                    You have to go up and get him.

      Martin gives her a withering look.

                                      MARTIN
                    I can't.  
                          (off her puzzled look)
                    I'm afraid of heights.

      She looks at him like, what?!  He realizes how that sounds. 
      A moment of decision.  He shoves his cell phone into his
      BACK POCKET and starts up the LADDER as another LIGHTNING
      STRIKE fills the sky with BLINDING LIGHT.

      AT THE CROW'S NEST

      Martin arrives at the metal grated floor, reaches up onto
      the rail and PULLS himself up and over to safety, clutching
      it with fear and vertigo.  

      Jake doesn't turn around.  He's eight feet away, standing on
      the outside of the railing staring up at the rain filled
      sky.  Martin has to shout to be heard over the storm.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    Jake! 
                          (Jake still doesn't
                            turn)
                    Jake, dammit!  Listen to me!  I'm
                    your father!  

      Tears begin to well in Martin's eyes.  He takes a couple
      steps closer to Jake.  Behind him, Clea has now climbed up. 
      She hoists herself over the rail, but Martin doesn't notice.

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    I did what you wanted me to!  I
                    followed the numbers!  Those kids...
                    they were saved because of you!  

      Jake still doesn't turn around.  

                                      MARTIN (CONT'D)
                    I don't know if you understand a
                    word I'm saying!  I don't know if
                    you even hear me!  But I hear you,
                    Jake, do you understand?!  
                          (softly)
                    I hear you now.

      A long beat, then Jake slowly turns around.  He climbs over
      the rail and looks at Martin.  Then RUSHES to him and in one
      fluid motion, WRAPS his arms around his father's waist!                                                                                        68.

      Martin GASPS, so stunned by the mere touch of his son.  As
      he slowly moves to return this affection, Jake PULLS AWAY
      quickly, now holding Martin's CELL PHONE that was in his
      back pocket.  It wasn't an embrace after all.  He was just
      trying to get his phone! 

      Jake quickly DIALS a number on the keypad.  He looks up at
      Martin pleadingly.  Thrusts the phone back to him.  Martin
      looks at Jake, then at the phone.  He slowly reaches out and
      takes it from him.  Looks at the illuminated telephone number
      on the phone's screen.  

                                    CLEA
                      Go'head... call it.  

      Martin looks back up at Jake for confirmation.  There is
      none.  So, in a leap of faith, Martin hits "dial".  After a
      tense moment, a MAN'S VOICE answers on the other line --

                                      MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    This is Ernie's.  Can I help you?

                                      MARTIN
                    My name is Martin Bohm... I know
                    this is going to sound crazy... and
                    I can't really explain how...
                          (ominously)
                    ...But I think we're supposed to
                    find each other.  

                                      MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hey, you got something to pawn, you
                    called the right place.  Otherwise I
                    can't help you.

      Martin's eyes narrow as a sudden realization stabs him.

                                      MARTIN
                    What did you say?

                                      MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    This is Ernie's pawn shop.  How can
                    I help you?

      And off the beginning of this new adventure, we CRANE UP and
      OUT, HIGH ABOVE this strange tableau, the storm raging over
      this darkened cell tower, three small human beings trapped
      on this tiny perch in the midst of nature's epic force --

                                                                                FADE OUT:

                                    THE END
