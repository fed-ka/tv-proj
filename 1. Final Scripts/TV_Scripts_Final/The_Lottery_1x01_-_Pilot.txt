 CARD:  2023

FADE IN ON:

KENNETH LIN, the 47th PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.  His 
ethnicity contains many ingredients, but the dominant flavor 
is Asian.  He conveys competence and compassion as he 
addresses the nation from the oval office. 

PRESIDENT LIN
My fellow Americans, we have 
endured a period of hopelessness 
without parallel in human history.  
The Fertility Crisis has undermined 
our ambitions and devastated our 
most fundamental dreams.  Our 
kindergartens, here and around the 
world, are now empty.  And our 
efforts to solve this mystery have 
been relentless and comprehensive 
... and unsuccessful.
(pauses for effect)
Until today. 

EXT.  BALTIMORE STREET  --  NIGHT

ALISON, 35, walks quickly down a deserted city street with a 
heavy backpack, looking over her shoulder nervously.  She s a 
research scientist and loner by nature, but this is one 
occasion where she could use a few friends. 

She looks back: a car rounds the corner, the distinctive

Whoosh!  The Metro car doors seal closed, and the train

Alison retreats in the opposite direction, pushing past the 
passengers, trapped on a train with no way off. 

PRESIDENT LIN

never forget.

As the train funnels down a dark tunnel...

 TOWNHOUSE  --  NIGHTEXT/INT.  VANESSA S

Tori arrives at toney Georgetown townhouse, cellphone to ear.  
She is still getting used to her powerful job, still dressing 
like the artist she once dreamed of being. 

TORI
...you re the one who said I should 
get out once in a while... 

VANESSA, 32, cocktail chic, opens the door.  The sound of a 
dinner party in the b.g.

Vanessa holds out a basket filled with smart phones.

VANESSA

Busted, Tori pulls a second hone from her purse like a 
concealed weapon and adds it to the basket.

INT.  VANESSA S DINING ROOM  -- A LITTLE LATER

The young power elites chatting around a table doing adult 
things like having dinner parties.  Tori tears into a juicy 
steak as she converses with REX, 30, Ivy League confident, 
drop dead handsome.

REX
Is it that obvious?

TORI
Vanessa has been trying to fix me 
up for years.  

Vanessa is tracking their progress from across the table.

just read his diatribe against 
marriage.

TORI

It came into existence as an 
economic contract, and it evolved 
to keep a couple together for the 
good of their children.  And nobody 
is having children anymore, why on 
earth would you want to get 
married? 

The articulation of the new reality momentarily silences the 
table.

TORI
 not why people get married.That s

REX
No? 

TORI
Humans are wired to make 
connection, and marriage is the 
 a story of connection.  It s
promise we make to someone else to 
be our better selves, to rise above 
our animal selfishness.
(takes Rex to task)
Your rap about children is a cop-
out.  You always hear stories about 
people getting married with no hope 
of children, even prisoners on 
Death Row, their last wish is to 
get married.25.


REX
And they all lived happily ever 
after... until a man behind the 
curtain flipped the switch.

 daunted by the groaning laughs from around the Rex isn t
table, he loves an argument.

Tori looks Rex straight in the eye.

Suddenly, through the curtains, police car lights FLASH from 
outside.  There s an authoritative KNOCKING at the door.  The 
table quiets as Vanessa answers the door.

Tori smiles sheepishly as she stands to leave.

TORI

PRESIDENT LIN
My fellow Americans, we have 
endured a long night of 
hopelessness without parallel in 
human history.  The Fertility 
Crisis has undermined our ambitions 
and devastated our most fundamental 
dreams.  Our playgrounds, here and

The candidates must be women

Additionally, the selection must

American population.
