      looks and the harried good cheer of a can-do Mom, is bidding 
    her daily sailing-on-the-Titanic good-byes to children SASHA, 
    8, and LUKE, 5, as husband ERIC, 40, sardonic and lanky, off-

    The kids tear to the couch and start fighting over the remote 
    and Zoe and Eric book in the other direction, towards the 
      entry hall and front door.

    She makes a clean getaway.                                                                            3.


      EXT. PERRY STREET BROWNSTONE-NEW YORK CITY-EARLY MORNING

    Zoe puts her briefcase on the roof of the car and holds her 
      arms out at her sides as if at airport security--

                                  ZOE
                    They had oatmeal with syrup--

    Her driver, Sam, gives her a thorough spots-scan, wet-wipe in *

                                  SAM
                    All clear. We re late--

    She ducks in the car and he shuts the door and runs around 
      front and jumps in.

    The car accelerates off; her briefcase goes THUDDING off the 
      trunk; the car SQUEALS to a stop, reverses full speed, 
      SQUEALS to a stop by the briefcase. Zoe opens her door, 
      plucks the briefcase off the street, and they speed off 
      again.

                                  NARRATOR (VO)
                    Then there s Dylan Mason, Associate

                    Group...

      INT. EQUINOX FITNESS CLUB-EARLY MORNING

      PUSH IN ON DYLAN MASON, 37, running full-tilt in a boot-camp 
      treadmill class. She has the blonde good looks and lithe 
      athleticism of a golden girl and the competitive drive of an 
      alpha male. She is wearing a Bluetoothheadset and browsing 
    the New York Times while pounding out her miles. A ring tone 
      sounds; she checks her phone s display and buttons on the 
      headset.

            NARRATOR (VO CONT D)DYLAN

      circulation.

      INT. CARRIAGE HOUSE-EAST 75TH STREET-SAME

    Her boyfriend RICHARD, 40, heartthrob handsome in an Ivy 
      League sort of way, is standing in the gorgeous living room 
    of a restored carriage house off Madison with elegant you-
      must-use-Pablo realtor PABLO, mid-thirties.

                    It s perfect.

      INT. EQUINOX FITNESS CLUB/CARRIAGE HOUSE-SAME

      INTERCUT, between the two of them.                                                                            4.

                                  DYLAN

                                  RICHARD
                    Dylan, will you move in with me?

    In her shock and surprise, she loses her footing and goes 
      sailing off the treadmill. The other RUNNERS barely bat an 
      eye. Dylan pops back up and adjusts her headset.

                                  DYLAN 
                    Did I lose you?

      A classic building and a  desirable  address, limos and

      INT. JULIET S APARTMENT-MASTER BEDROOM-DAY

      High-ceilinged, pre-war, classic. PUSH IN FAST ON JULIET 
      DRAPER, 39, looking like she just stepped off the cover of 
       Town and Country ; a pro of the old school, mercurial, with 
      a will of iron neatly concealed by an extroverted feminine 
      gentility. She is in a bra and panties, holding a dress up 
      against her and before a full-length mirror. Her husband 
      DAVIS, 45, WASP good looks kept tanned and fit, is packing a 
      suitcase. 

                  NARRATOR (VO)JULIET

                                  DAVIS
                          (after the slightest 
                            glance)
                    Perfect.

                                  JULIET
                    Really?

                                  DAVIS
                    Really. And besides, you could go 
                    in mom jeans and a Garfield 
                    sweatshirt and you d still be the 
                    classiest woman in the room.

    She smiles a little and shakes her head. Then, evenly--                                                                            5.


                                  JULIET
                    Davis? Close your eyes and describe 
                    the dress?

    He shrugs, turns his back to her. 

                                  DAVIS
                          (after a moment, 
                            patiently)
                    Black, beaded around the cleavage 
                    or whatever you call it. Probably  
                    cost more than my new Porsche. Can 
                    I open them now?

                                  JULIET
                    No.

    She drops the dress and melts up against him, suddenly 
      yearning in her body language and tone. He returns her kiss, *
      succumbing to her arousal. She deftly unbuckles his belt and *
      pulls him by the waistband to their bed, urgent, erotic--*

      --and a quick RAP on the door is followed by the entrance of 
      their daughter EMILY, 14, a knockout with a toxic case of 
      attitude. At the same time--

                  JULIET(CONT D)EMILY
      AAAAAAHHHHH!Gross!

      Emily quickly turns her back as Juliet shrugs on a robe.

                                  EMILY 
                    If you re gonna rekindle the flames 
                    or whatever you could at least lock 
                    the door.

                                  DAVIS 
                          (patient)
                    What is it, Em?

                                  EMILY
                    She has to meet me in the 
                      Headmasters office after school 
                    today.

                                  JULIET
                    Why?

                                  EMILY
                    If I tell you now I ll just have to 
                    listen to your same crap twice. I m 
                    off-- 

    And she goes, trailing resentment like exhaust. Davis hefts 
    his suitcase.

                                  DAVIS
                    I d better get moving, call me if 
                    you need me to talk to her.

                                  JULIET
                    Just take me with you.                                                                            6.


                                  DAVIS
                    You hate Hilton Head. And you have 
                    an empire to run.

                                  JULIET
                    Right. Love you.

      Kisses her, gently, and goes.

      Spacious and homey, with art on the walls and a view of 
      Central Park; mock-ups for singer/actress/diva SHERRY 
      MADEIRA s fragrance launch strewn on every surface. Asleep on 
    the sofa in yesterday s clothes is CAITLIN DOWD, 37, a Boston 
      Irish Working Girl transformed into a saucily attractive Jil 
      Sander Suit. 

                                  NARRATOR (VO)
                    In three years she expanded their

                    Single.

    Her assistant, PATRICK, African-American, late twenties, 
      fastidious in dress and manner, knocks-and-enters and rolls 
    his eyes in surprise.

                                  PATRICK

                                  CAITLIN
                    Shut up.

      And, with military precision and lightning speed: 

    He selects a plastic-wrapped cashmere sweater from a filing 
      cabinet full of them as she takes off her blouse, tosses it 
    to her--                                                                            7.


      --as she pulls it on, he opens a breakfront drawer and flips 
    her a hairbrush and a tin of Altoids; she crunches a couple 
    and whips her hair with the brush--

      --hobbles into her heels and puffs a little cologne from a 
      sample bottle on her desk and gives her appearance a once-
      over in the mirror as he opens a bottle of mineral water and 
      hands it to her and she takes a long pull. 

                                  PATRICK 
                    I ll send her in?

                                  CAITLIN
                    Coffee, too.

    He goes out. She strikes a casually confident pose behind her 
      desk as--

      --Patrick returns with ALICIA LAWSON, 37, British, with a 
      striking physical beauty made all the more appealing by a 
      disarmingly scattered, unself-conscious air. Men want to be 
      with her, women want to be like her, and in thismoment--    

                                  PATRICE
                    Alicia Lawson, Caitlin Dowd.

                                  CAITLIN
                    Alicia, thanks so much for 
                    coming...

                                  ALICIA
                    Oh, my, no, thank you. 

      --Caitlin is frozen in place somewhere in between the two, 
      with a look on her face like little valentines were circling 
    her head to the music of a harp and utterly flummoxed by it.  
    She rounds her desk, knocking over the litre of water in the 
      process.

                      CAITLINALICIA
      Shoot.Now that s usually mymove. 
                                                    Here...

      Both bend down; Alicia picks up the bottle and replaces it on 
    the desk. Caitlin extends her hand, clearly flustered. 

                                  CAITLIN
                    Please, sit.

      They take seats catty-corner from each other by the coffee 
      table. Caitlin s way too aware of her own body language, 
      fidgeting and utterly distracted. Awkward silence, broken by:

                                  ALICIA
                          (looking around)
                    I wish my apartment was as inviting 
                    as your office. This is gorgeous.                                                                            8.


                                  CAITLIN 
                    Thank you. I finally gave up 
                    pretending that I actually lived 
                    anywhere else and just went for it. 
                    So, how do you like New York?

                                  ALICIA
                    Well, it s only been two months 
                    but, to be honest? You never really 
                    feel alone here, but it can get 
                    awfully lonely. Do you know what I 
                    mean?

      Caitlin measures her response as if it were the answer to a 
      life-changing question. And takes too long--

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                          (sheepish)
                    I m sorry, that s not what you were 
                    asking--

                                  CAITLIN
                    Yes! Yes it was. I know just what 
                    you mean! And what you need is, 
                    well, you need a job, for starters.

                                  ALICIA
                    Yes, well, I guess that s why I m 
                    here.

      With a dazzling smile. Caitlin can only grin helplessly in 
      response; you can almost hear the voice in her head going 
       Get a grip! .

      EXT. MAXWELL S RESTAURANT-MIDTOWN-DAY

      A classic Manhattan power lunch venue; deceptively casual in 
      appearance but bubbling daily with an only-in-New-York 
      trifecta of top-drawer media, financial, sports and 
      entertainment players. Zoe s Mercedes pulls up to the curb, 
    she steps out and intersects with Caitlin, cheek-kisses as 
      they head inside.

                                  NARRATOR (VO)
                    They ve been coming here since the 
                    week I opened, they ve helped my 
                    staff with everything from green 
                    cards to doctor referrals--

      INT. MAXWELL S RESTAURANT-MIDTOWN-DAY

    The eponymous MAXWELL  MAX  BRAUTIGAN, late forties, a 
      gregarious transplanted-Californian foodie, is huddled at the 
    bar over the seating chart for his restaurant with new 
      maitre d SEAN, 40, a mini-me of Max. As Max speaks, you 
      realize he s been our narrator, educating Sean on the 
      Kremlinology of his clientele.

                                  MAX
                    --and in my restaurants, they are 
                    first among equals. Let s 
                    introduce...                                                                            9.


      FOLLOWING THEM TO a banquette by the window, a prime table, 
      where two WAITERS are placing water and drinks with military 
      precision in front of Juliet, Caitlin, Dylan and Zoe. 

                                  MAX (CONT D)
                    Ladies, please meet my new 
                    maitre d, this is Sean...

      A chorus of cheerful  hello s .

                                  SEAN
                    My pleasure. If there s ever, 
                    anything--

                      JULIETDYLAN
    And there will be--And we ll count on you--

                      CAITLINZOE
        Wonderful--Thank you!

    Max leads the slightly stunned Sean away--

                                  MAX
                          (sotto voce)
                    You ll get used to it.

      PUSHING IN ON THE FOUR, huddled with the urgency of a fourth-
      and-goal, galvanized and sparkling in their private element.

                                  JULIET
                    Who wants to go first?

                                  ZOE
                    Wait, we didn t order--

      With a lifted finger, a WAITER appears.

                      JULIETZOE
      Cobb salad?Salmon.

                                  DYLAN
                    Cobb.

                                  CAITLIN
                    Cobb and a Ketel One martini.

      Which draws expectant looks as the waiter moves off. 

                                  CAITLIN (CONT D)
                    I need the drink first. Someone 
                    else go.

      Enough said. Dylan jumps in--

                                  DYLAN
                    Richard asked me to move in with 
                    him. 

                        ZOECAITLIN
      You re kidding!?About time!                                                                            10.


                                  DYLAN (CONT D)
                    He saw this place he loves on the 
                    East Side but I want to look at 
                    lofts, too. 

                                  ZOE
                    You re like, going Dutch?

                                  DYLAN
                    Yeah. We can afford so much more if 
                    we go in it together.

                                  JULIET
                    Any ring in sight?

                                  DYLAN
                          (defensive)
                    No. With all due respect to you and 
                    Zoe and wedded bliss, Richard and I 
                    both know too many people who are 
                    miserable becauseof the ring. 

                                  JULIET
                    You might want to work up some kind 
                    of real-estate pre-nup, just the 
                    same.

      Dylan s look drops the subject, Zoe picks up the ball. 

                                  ZOE
                    Help me out here. Kate Baron: top 
                    of her class at Wharton, I brought

                    my team. Turns out she s like 
                    poster girl for Generation ID.

                                  DYLAN
                    And if she were a KenBaron, she s 
                    already gone.

                                  ZOE 
                    Yes. Do I be the daisy in the 
                    barrel of the gun or do I give her 
                    up to the pricks upstairs?

                                  JULIET
                    You dangle her out the 40th floor 
                    window, thengive her one more 
                    chance. If I know you you ve been 
                    too easy on her, which makes you 
                    partly responsible.                                                                            11.


      This lands on Zoe, who nods. CILLA GREY, 34 and tracking on 
    the bombshell side in the style scale of this tribe, stops by 
      their table as the Waiter places Caitlin s martini and she 
      takes a quick slug and like, finally exhales--

                                  CILLA
                    Hi you all--

      A chorus of  Hi Cilla s  in reply--

                                  CAITLIN

                    move them along at least?

                    in bed every night and if they ever 
                    went away without us it was to have 
                    one of our siblings. But we never 
                    wanted to be our mothers. 

    All absorb this, for a moment. Juliet tips her glass in a 
      rueful salute. 

                                  JULIET
                    To progress.

      Plates are set in front of them. Caitlin checks her watch, 
      signals the waiter--

                                  CAITLIN
                    I ll take the check, too. I m 
                    crammed today--

                    It s with Ms. Grey. As is dessert.

      Another WAITER sets out a a huge, elaborate, deathly-rich 
      confection.

                          (under her breath)
                    Isn t thata little passive-
                      aggressive.

    All four wave and smile at Cilla, across the room, who smiles 
    and wiggles fingers in reply.

      INT. GORHAM, SUTTER-ZOE S OFFICE-DAY

    Zoe in her office, with a high-up view of midtown and a 
      couple dozen family photographs offsetting the spartan 
      atmosphere; scores of IPO tombstones form a victory parade on 
    the walls. 

    She has KATE BARON, 27, a coltish beauty with a thick air of 
      entitlement and a chip on her shoulder the size of a Buick, 
      posed insolently in front of the desk.

                    I mean, come on--is it really so 
                    beneath you to come up with an

                    you out it s because I thoughtI 
                    saw potential in you. 

      Kate s anger breaks through, loud and clear.

                                  KATE
                    Yes I have potential! But how am I 
                    supposed to reach it when you re 
                    breathing down my neck and just,

                      Perfectionism isn t a virtue, you 
                    know. It s more like a neurosis.

    Zoe back on her heels for the briefest moment; no one under 
    her talks to her like this. 

                        ZOEKATE
        (a moment, then--)(scrambling)

      Kate goes. Zoe picks up her phone and buttons an extension, 
      resolute--

      seated in a tense tableau.

    She holds out a hand to Emily, who just walks by her to the 
      door.

      INT. CHASEN SCHOOL-CORRIDOR-DAY

      Juliet and Emily in the empty hallway, facing off.

                                  JULIET
                    --then I ll just let your father 
                    handle this.

                                  EMILY
                    He s not gonna  handle  anything, 
                    and you know it.  Cause I say the 
                    things to you that he wants to say 
                    but s afraid to.

    She bolts for the stairs, slips in her haste, bangs her bare 
      shin on a sharp marble step and crumples, cursing. Juliet, 
      instinctively, goes right to her.

                                  JULIET
                            (empathetic)
                    Ow.

    She sits down on the steps beside Emily, who whimpers in 
      pain. Juliet hugs her and for the briefest moment they are 
      mother and child again.

                        EMILYJULIET
    I m such a klutz--That must hurt--

                        EMILYJULIET
    I m okay, Mom--Let me just look at it?

                                  EMILY 
                    --Please? Just leave me alone?                                                                            16.


    She goes hobbling up the stairs. Juliet gets to her feet, 
      braces herself on the banister, takes a quick look around to 
      make certain that she is alone, and crumples a little as a 
    sob wells up in her throat and tears spring into her eyes. A 
      rare, uncontrolled emotional moment for her.

    Dr. Clifton sticks his head out the door, concerned. Juliet 
      waves, covering--

                    Well, from Kate, to be honest.

      Zoe, off-guard. She flinches, recovers.

                                  ZOE
                    Wait a minute? Since when does a

                    Ah. When she s sleeping with him.

      He s like a brick wall, leaning back in his chair, unfazed.

                                  CLAYTON
                    No, we re not. Just let that go.                                                                            17.

                    The point is, Zoe, she s being 
                    wasted where she is. She needs a 
                    bigger challenge to really flourish

                    You re kidding me.

                    now and again.

      A beat, eye to eye. Zoe bites her tongue.

                                  ZOE
                    Got it.

      INT. BARNET-NASH BUILDING-EXECUTIVE FLOOR-DAY

      FOLLOWING DYLAN, walking out of her perimeter office and 
      tossing greetings as she hurries past the warren of cubicles 
      that predominate the floor. She notices Richard, on the other 
      side of the floor, headed in the same direction.  

      They intersect at the elevator. Both reach for the  up  
      button.

                                  DYLAN

      They lob alarmed looks.

                                  RICHARD
                    I guess we re found out?

                    If we are, you don t need to worry. 
                    It s always the woman who gets the

                    Straight up? The home office in

                    Well, the other would be made 
                    redundant.

      Both of them tense, focused on Hughes.

      Dylan and Richard glance at one another; sure as hell didn t 
    see thiscoming.

      MOMENTS LATER, FOLLOWING DYLAN AND RICHARD, walking to the

      clearly getting a charge, competitive and sexual, out of the

                    None of those other firms is going 
                    to open up the publisher s job for 
                    years...

                                  RICHARD
                    So you wantto play his game?

                                  DYLAN
                    It s not a matter of want; it is 
                    what it is. Is this going to be a 
                    problem for us?

                                  RICHARD
                          (defensive)
                    Not for me. 

                                  DYLAN
                    I mean, you d be pissedif I tanked 
                    a squash game or backed off on a 
                    black diamond with you-- 

                                  RICHARD
                    I m not worried about me, Dylan.

    The elevator doors open and they get on. 

                                  DYLAN 
                            (breathless)
                    C mere--

    She braces him against the wall with her lips and (whatever 
      network standards allow as urgent elevator sex) as the doors 
       ding  closed and the chorus to the song kicks in.                                                                            20.


      INT. GORHAM, SUTTER-CONFERENCE ROOM-DAY  

    Zoe commanding the head of a table about the size of a 
      football field; 28 MEN IN SUITS and two other WOMEN SUITS 
      with their eyes fixed on her.

                                  ZOE
                    ...and I disagree. If you look 
                      three-sixty around this deal, we re 
                    still stronger at the lower price 
                    per share because of our cash 
                    leverage. I think we should stand.

    Her BlackBerry vibrates on the table. She flips it open and 
      checks the display--

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    Excuse me a second?
                          (into phone, getting up)
                    Is everything okay?

      EXT. FRIENDS MEETING HOUSE SCHOOL-DAY

      A Greenwich Village Pre-K through 8. Find Eric, the lone male 
      among the gathering MOMS waiting for their children, as Luke 
      comes running up--

                                  ERIC
                          (into phone, oblivious)
                    Luke got a reading star, I ll put 
                    him on--

      Hands off the phone to Luke--

                                  LUKE
                          (into phone)
                    MOM!?

      SPLIT SCREEN-CONFERENCE ROOM/FRIENDS SCHOOL-CONTINUOUS

    Zoe giving  just a second  and  one more second  semaphores 
    to the assembled, juggling between her two roles, as Luke 
      chatters away--

                        LUKEZOE
      I got a reading star! And Mommy s in a meeting honey, 
      guess what else!?so quickly, what else--

                        LUKEZOE
    No, you have to guess!Luke, Mommy s realbusy right 
                                                  now--

                        LUKEZOE
      I lost a tooth at lunch.Be sure you give it to Daddy 
                                                  for the Tooth Fairy. And put 
                                                  Daddy on?

      VICTORIA KEENER, mid-thirties, cute and sexy in her sprayed-
    on yoga togs, moves up beside him. Her son Jason, also 5, 
      wraps his arms around her legs.                                                                            21.


                                  VICTORIA
                    Nice day to take them to the park. 
                    Want to?

                                  LUKE
                    Dad? Mom wants to talk to you...

    He hands Eric the phone.

                                  ERIC
                    We re off to the park, I ll call 
                    you later.

    And snaps the phone shut. The four of them move off together--

      --as Zoe turns back to her meeting with determined bravado--

                                  ZOE
                    Okay then! Back on track!

      EXT. PARK-DAY

      Luke and play-date Jason on the monkey bars; Eric and 
      Victoria stretched out in the grass nearby.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Jason! Careful not to kick!

    She rolls over closer to Eric, eyes him inquisitively.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    I bet our lives are a lot alike in 
                    some ways.

                                  ERIC
                    Like how?

                                  VICTORIA
                    Well, were both married to Type-A s 
                    who end up running on empty by the 
                    time they get home, no?

                                  ERIC
                    Your husband s a...

                                  VICTORIA
                    Director of South American Emerging 
                    Markets, Smith Barney. Eighty-hour 
                    weeks and a chronic case of jet-
                    lag. We get to it twice a month if 
                    we re lucky.

                                  ERIC
                    You re talking about getting to the 
                    theatre, right?

    She kicks him, playful.                                                                            22.


                                  VICTORIA
                    No, I m not talking about the 
                    theatre. I bet you can be 
                    absolutely infuriating.

                                  ERIC
                    Why?

                                  VICTORIA
                    This whole ironic-distance thing 
                    you ve got going on. It s very sort 
                    of charming but it makes you so 
                    hard to read.

                                  ERIC
                    Yeah, it s a cry for help.

                                  VICTORIA
                    See?

    She shifts a little closer.

                                  VICTORIA (CONT D)
                    Okay, here goes. The only safe 
                    affair is between two people who 
                    are married with young kids and 
                    committed to staying in those 
                    marriages. Nobody s going to fall 
                    in love; everybody just has a good 
                    time and goes home.

                                  ERIC
                    Like, friends with benefits.

                                  VICTORIA
                    Like that, yes. And please don t 
                    make a joke.

    He meets her gaze, unflinching, and smiles, genuine.

                                  ERIC
                    I won t. And if I m understanding 
                    you correctly, I m very flattered.
                    But here s the thing? I don t get 
                    nearly enough sex at home, either. 
                    But where I m kind of twisted? It 
                    means it never gets stale, it means 
                    I m in a kind of perpetual state of 
                    wanting her. 

    She smiles and nods, not so much in concession as in taking 
    up a gauntlet. A JINGLING MELODY sounds, off.

                                  VICTORIA
                    She s luckier than she knows.

                                  LUKE (OS)
                    Dad!? The ice cream truck!?

    He gets to his feet.                                                                            23.


      EXT. TENTH AVENUE-MOVING-DAY

      A white Jaguar XJ8 weaving in traffic and pulling up in front 
    of a soundstage building. You hear Caitlin, over:

                                  CAITLIN (VO)
                    ...it s not unlike what you were 
                    doing at Sony Music. Two-thirds of 
                    the job is launching new product, 
                      one-third s supporting the existing 
                    brands.

      Caitlin gets out the back, offers a hand to Alicia, who takes 
    it. They head to the entrance--

      INT. SOUNDSTAGE-DAY

      Pink s  U + UR Hand  BOOMING, CAMERA TRACKING PAST a 
      commercial film CREW lingering on hold around a set; Diva 
      SHERRY MADEIRA, late 20 s, a provocative bombshell, is in an 
      enormous tilted fantasy of a bed with two young male MODELS 
    in briefs, a Nordic God and a Latin Heartthrob. She shares 
    her bottle of Crystal, pouring it into their mouths and 
      giggling.

      PUSH IN ON a huddle taking place just off the set. Caitlin, 
      Alicia and agency account rep RON, 40, are faced off against 
      three of Sherry s management team, a united front of tough 
      WOMEN headed by ELLEN GOLDMAN-TURNER, late thirties, extra-
      large.

                                  RON
                    Ellen, there isn t a network in the 
                    country that s going to air this 
                    with two men in the bed.

                                  ELLEN
                    We were promised artistic freedom, 
                    Ron. And the whole damn point of 
                    the damn fragrance is that like 
                    Sherry herself, you ll never sleep 
                    alone.

                                  RON
                          (final)
                    Oneguy, not two. Caitlin, could 
                    you--

                                  ALICIA
                    Caitlin?

    She moves her aside and leans in close.

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    If you shoot it both ways and  
                    stick the two-guys one up on 
                    YouTube as  too hot for TV , you 
                    might see it go viral to a million 
                    eyeballs without having to buy a 
                    single minute of time.

    Eye to eye, for a moment. Caitlin smiles, clearly impressed.                                                                            24.


                                  CAITLIN
                          (over her shoulder)
                    Shoot it both ways.
                          (to Alicia, charged)
                    When can you start?

                                  ALICIA
                    Now?

                                  CAITLIN
                    I ll call Human Resources and have 
                    them put a package together...

      Alicia takes Caitlin s hands in hers and kisses her on both 
      cheeks. Caitlin s breath catches--

                                  ALICIA
                    This is just...thankyou!

    Her phone ringtone is a jazzy  Greensleeves . She pulls it 
      out, checks the display--

                                  ALICIA (CONT D)
                    Talk about timing--
                          (buttons it on)
                    Hello my darling! I have the most 
                      fantasticnews!

    She steps away as Ellen takes Caitlin s elbow and gestures to *
    the male models on the set--*

                                  ELLEN
                            (lascivious)
                    What I wouldn t give to be the meat 
                    in thatsandwich, huh?

    OUT ON CAITLIN, glancing at Alicia, deflated.*

      EXT. DINER-11TH AVENUE-DAWN

      Escalades and livery limousines idling out front of a hip-
      this-minute diner at dawn. 

      INT. DINER-EARLY MORNING

      Weaving through the motley nightlife CREW and finding Dylan 
    at a booth with a cup of coffee and her cell phone to her 
      ear. 

                                  DYLAN
                          (into phone, urgently)
                    Zoe it s me I need unbelievable 
                    seats to the Rangers game tonight 
                    will you check your company s box 
                    as soon as you get this?

    She buttons it off as PETER JOHNSON, 45, Daimler-Chrysler 
      marketing honcho and listing a bit after this long night, 
      slides into the booth, opposite her, as a WAITRESS delivers 
      waffles and bacon.                                                                             25.


                                  PETER
                    Can t remember the last time I had 
                    breakfast beforeI went to bed.

                                  DYLAN
                    Well, I hope you remember this 
                    time.

                                  PETER
                    The look on that guy s face when I 
                    laid down the straight flush? Never
                    gonna forget that.

                                  DYLAN
                    One minute of business? Our 
                    research shows that women still 
                    find shopping for a new car 
                      intimidating, yet they drive the 
                    market for a huge segment of your 
                    product line--

                                  PETER
                    You re not going to let me sleep  
                    until I give you the buy, are you.  

                                  DYLAN
                    I ll messenger over a proposed 
                    schedule ladder this afternoon, and 
                    if you re up for it Detroit s 
                    playing the Rangers tonight and 
                    I ve got a box right on the glass.

    He gives her a look-over with a lopsided smile and heavy

      INT. BARNET-NASH BUILDING-DYLAN S OFFICE-DAY

      PUSHING IN ON DYLAN fast asleep on the couch. Commotion, 
      outside.

                    She s not to be disturbed--

                    This won t take a second--

    He steps in and shuts the door behind him, livid. She stirs--

                                  RICHARD (CONT D)
                    Lowblow!

                          (groggy)
                    What?                                                                            26.


                                  RICHARD
                    You knewI had Johnson for a round 
                    at Winged Foot this morning. And 
                    now he s postponed. You screwed me.

                                  DYLAN
                    I didn t do a damn thing to you.

                                  RICHARD
                    He said you kept him out all night!

                                  DYLAN
                    More like he kept me--

                                  RICHARD
                    How d you work him, Dylan? Did you 
                    do that thing you do?

      She s on her feet like a shot with a look that could stop a 
      clock.

                                  DYLAN
                          (stung)
                    Richard, what the hell!? You take 
                    that back right now!

                                  RICHARD
                    Right now you re exactly what I 
                    hate about working with women.

                                  DYLAN
                    What s that supposed to mean?

                                  RICHARD
                    You make like you re playing by the 
                    rules but push comes to shove out 
                    come the little looks and the sexy 
                    signals and it s demeaning to 
                    everybody.

    Why don t you go back in your You torpedoed your colleague.

                                  DYLAN
                    We re not exactly colleagues right 
                    now! Remember?

      A stand-off, for a moment, staring each other down.

                                  RICHARD 
                    Right. I ll see you later.

    He goes. She sits back down, wrung out.

      ANOTHER ANGLE-ZOE S POV

      Exiting the Mercer Hotel, Cilla Grey and Juliet s husband 
      Davis. He hails a cab, she takes his arm and stands on tiptoe

    The car stops. You get a clear view of them, ten yards away. 
      Davis breaks into a sly grin and then pulls her to him and 
      kisses her deeply. He opens the cab door for her and she gets 
    in as he leans down to the window and says something we can t 
      hear and touches his fingers to his lips in farewell and 
      heads back inside.

                    Pride, schadenfreude, and here s a 
                      hypothetical. There s a person 
                    who s come to work for me who I 
                    have some strong feelings for but 
                    if it s like, not mutual? Then this 
                    person becomes a huge distraction 
                    and I d have to find an excuse to 
                    fire them even though they ve done 
                    nothing wrong. What sin am I 
                    looking at?

                    And I think my hundred thousand 
                    dollar donation should buy me a  
                      sin-or-no-sin answer.

      FATHER DAN, 40, long-haired and Black Irish handsome, opens

                    I don t think you re in any danger

                    you re in is of ending up like  
                    Aunt Ruth because you weren t brave

                    know that you deserve to be loved 
                    yourself, for who you are. 

                                  CAITLIN
                    Thanks, Dan.

                                  FATHER DAN
                    By the way, is she cute?

                                  CAITLIN
                    What s with the shot in the dark?                                                                            32.


                                  FATHER DAN
                          (gently)
                    Caitlin, I m your brother, I want 
                    what s best for you. You ve been 
                    dating for twenty years, and at 
                    some point it s okay to admit that 
                    it s not about meeting the right 
                      guyanymore; just the right person.

                                  CAITLIN
                          (a moment, then--)
                    It s a little scary.

                                  FATHER DAN
                    Change always is.

    He gives her a strong hug and a kiss on the cheek.

      EXT. SANS SOUCI CORPORATE HQ-MIDTOWN-DAY

      Flags of a dozen nations hanging over the atrium entrance.

      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM-DAY

      Juliet is flanked by Operations Vice-Presidents JEFF LAWTON 
    and TIM IRWIN, both a few years older than her, and across a 
      table from two impressive Panamanian developers, SENOR LOPEZ 
    and SENOR BRICENO. The table is strewn with land surveys and 
      photographs of Caribbean beach front; they are wrapping up. 

                                  SENOR LOPEZ
                          (in perfect English, to 
                          Jeff and Tim)
                    ...and we hope that a visit to our 
                    site might be the logical next 
                    step?

      Senor Briceno edges his coffee cup towards Juliet and 
      gestures towards the carafe down the table.She takes a  *
      moment, then fetches the carafe and pours them each a cup, *
      during the following:*

                                  JULIET
                    Gentlemen, with all due respect to 
                    our cultural differences, I ll 
                    remind you that I am the COO of 
                    this company and the ranking 
                    executive in this meeting. If
                    there s a next step, I d appreciate 
                    it if you d address your proposals 
                    to me as well as to my colleagues, 
                    and to get your coffee refills for 
                      yourselves. 
                          (then, brightly)*
                    Cream or sugar?*

    She heads for the door, leaving them stunned and speechless.                                                                             33.


      INT. SANS SOUCI HQ-CORRIDOR-DAY

      Juliet walking down the hall with a little smile of pride and 
      triumph breaking out. Jeff and Tim catch up to her and fall 
      into stride.

                                  JULIET
                          (to Jeff and Tim)
                    Plus they were fudging about the 
                    beach. I checked with our 
                    engineers, and that whole part of 
                    the peninsula gets covered in 
                    seaweed six months a year...

      They peel off as she stops by her assistant, JACOB, late 
      twenties, murmuring into his headset--

                                  JULIET (CONT D)
                    Davis call back?

    He shakes his head, no. She heads into her office--

      INT. JULIET S OFFICE-DAY

      Done up in a slightly muted version of her apartment, English-
      country cozy. She picks up her phone and hits a speed dial 
      button. Davis  voice mail message, heard faintly, as she 
      adjusts a framed photograph of the two of them, front and 
      center on her desk. 

                                  JULIET 
                          (into phone)
                    Hi, it s me again. Listen, the 
                    company jet s dead-heading down to 
                    Miami and I though maybe I d do 
                    something totally uncharacteristic 
                    and have them drop me in Hilton *
                    Head and meet you for dinner and *
                    some hotel sex and I d fly back up 
                    with you tomorrow? Emily s already 
                    set to sleep over at Amanda s, 
                    so...
                          (checks her watch)
                    This offer good until four o clock. 
                    Call me. Big kiss.

    The whine of a jet engine and Linda Ronstadt s charged cover 
    of  Girls Talk  surge up on the soundtrack.

      EXT. TETERBORO AIRPORT-DAY

      Music continues as Zoe and Kate exit her car on the tarmac, 
      hand off their suitcases to the waiting STEWARD and board a 
      Gulfstream V.

                                  ZOE
                          (into cell phone)
                    Sasha, I ll be at your recital I 
                    promise double pinky swear now 
                    start your homework and put Daddy 
                    on...                                                                            34.


      INT. GULFSTREAM-FLYING-DAY

      Music continues. Zoe and Kate are seated as far apart as 
      possible in the intimate cabin, Zoe on the phone and Kate s 
      gaze going from laptop to Zoe and back, as if waiting to be 
      noticed. Zoe ends her phone call and opens her laptop; Kate 
      closes her laptop and summons courage and walks up to Zoe s 
      seat. Music ends.

                                  KATE
                    I know we don t use the word 
                     sorry , so I won t. I just really, 
                    really admire you and I can t tell 
                    you how grateful and honored I am 
                    to be in your such good hands.

                                  ZOE
                    Well, thank you, Kate.

                                  KATE
                    And I m going to knock your socks 
                    off, starting with the meeting 
                    tomorrow morning.

                                  ZOE
                    Where you will use last names only, 
                    go easy on the eye contact, and 
                    keep your mouth shut after the 
                    small talk is over.

      Kate nods, takes it like a good soldier, gestures to Zoe s 
      laptop.

                                  KATE
                    Do you have any pictures of your 
                    kids?

    Zoe hesitates a moment, clicks a folder open and offers the 
      screen. Kate takes the seat opposite her.

                                  ZOE
                    That s Sasha, she s eight, and 
                    Luke, five.

                                  KATE
                    God, they re gorgeous.

                                  ZOE
                    Thank you.

      Closes it up.

                                  KATE
                    What s your secret? 

                                  ZOE
                    I don t have one.

                                  KATE
                    Come on. You re the youngest 
                    Managing Director Gorham s ever 
                    had, andyou re a woman, anda Mom?                                                                            35.


                                  ZOE
                    There is no secret, Kate. Profit 
                    doesn t care if you have kids or 
                    cats, a penis or a vagina, where 
                    you went to school or who you re 
                    sleeping with. Profit only cares if 
                    you ve got the hot hand, and 
                    through hard work and some luck 
                    mine s been hot more often than 
                    not. 

                                  KATE
                    Wow.

    Zoe picks up the phone again and opens her laptop.

                                  ZOE
                    You re going to have to excuse 
                    me...

                                  KATE
                    Thank you so much for taking the 
                    time. 
                          (getting up--)

                                  ZOE
                          (casual)
                    And Kate, a word to the wise? Be 
                    careful of office romances, 
                    especially with the married ones.

      Eyes like lasers, watching her reaction. Which is startled, 
      though she tries to hide it.

                                  KATE
                    I don t have anything going on...

                                  ZOE
                    For future reference then? At some 
                    point it will end and you will 
                    become an inconvenience. And if you 
                    try to sue when they trump up a due 
                    cause for firing you, they will 
                    bury you under lawyers and you ll 
                    end up with cab fare and you ll be 
                      blacklisted at every firm you d 
                    ever want to work for.

                                  KATE
                          (evenly)
                    Thanks, but it s not my style.

    She gets up, trips, rights herself, and starts back to her 
      seat, clearly flustered. Zoe smiles a little.

      EXT. CAITLIN S OFFICE-DAY

      Caitlin leaning over Patrick s shoulder and going over her 
      schedule on the monitor.                                                                            36.


                                  CAITLIN
                    ...then see if you can move the 
                    European sales meeting to four-
                    thirty...
                            (noticing--)

      ANOTHER ANGLE-CAITLIN S POV

      A strikingly handsome MAN with a stunning armful of flowers 
    on the opposite side of the floor, seen over the tops of the 
      cubicles, as an ASSISTANT points out a door to him and he 
      walks a little further and knocks and opens it and Alicia 
      steps into view and takes the flowers and wraps her arms 
      around him.

                                  PATRICK (OS)
                    It d mean starting market research 
                    no earlier than seven.

      BACK TO SCENE

      Caitlin, resigned. Story of my life.

                                  CAITLIN
                    That s okay, I m not going 
                    anywhere.

      EXT. CARRIAGE HOUSE-EAST 75TH STREET-EVENING

      Richard hurrying up the sidewalk, clearly late.

      INT. CARRIAGE HOUSE-BEDROOM-EVENING

    Ten foot ceilings, original moldings, a fireplace. Dylan and 
      Richard are standing a little apart at the large picture 
      window overlooking the block of gardens below, soft green in 
    the waning light. 

                                  DYLAN
                    I ve never had a fireplace in the 
                    bedroom.

                                  RICHARD
                    Gardens out the window. Could you 
                    see us here?

                                  DYLAN
                    I d be happy wherever you d be 
                    happy.

    She reaches out, a little tentative, takes his hand.

                                  RICHARD
                    What if I told you I put in a bid 
                    for that loft you loved on 
                    Greenwich?

    Her ecstatic reaction leaving no doubt as to her real wish.

                                  DYLAN
                    You did!? YOU DID!?                                                                            37.


    She climbs into his arms. He holds back, just a little.

                                  RICHARD
                    We really, really need something to 
                    look forward to beyond Friday.

                                  DYLAN
                    I do love you, you know.

    She kisses him, hungrily. He succumbs. 

      INT. JULIET S APARTMENT-MASTER BEDROOM-NIGHT

      Juliet still dressed, laying on the bed with a large drink in 
    her hand watching a video of a long-ago family vacation at 
    the beach, Davis clowning, Emily about five in a Little 
      Mermaid bathing suit and coming in close and squinting into 
    the camera --  I love you, Mommy. --Davis joining her-- I 
      love you too, Mommy . Juliet freezes the frame, takes a sip 
    of her drink, and picks up her phone as if willing it to ring 
    and then tosses it aside. 

      INT. HOTEL ROOM-ATLANTA, GA.-NIGHT

        A business-chain room like a million others. Zoe is on the 
    bed in a robe, a vodka in hand, her computer open in her lap.

                                  ZOE
                    Good night, Luke. I love you.

      ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL-SCREEN LAPTOP SCREEN

    Via wi-fi and web-cam, Luke presses his lips to the lens on 
    his end and gives her a remote kiss good night. He moves off, 
      Eric takes his place.

                                  ERIC
                          (calling, off)
                    Ask your sister to help you, I ll 
                    be right up.
                          (into camera)
                    Hi there...

      ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOTH

    Zoe on the bed and Eric on the screen.

                                  ZOE
                    Is it just me or is everybody 
                    having lots of sex just not with 
                    the people they re supposed to be 
                    having it with?

                                  ERIC
                    Is this a trick question? 

                                  ZOE
                    No. Clayton is screwing that

    His image disappears. She lays back on the bed, suddenly wide 
      awake.

      EXT. REGENCY HOTEL - CURBSIDE - DAY

      Richard in golf attire, standing by his Mercedes SL55 as 
      Peter Johnson comes out with a golf bag slung over his 
      shoulder.

                                  PETER
                    Hey Ricardo! What a day for it, 
                    huh?

      Hearty handshakes. Richard takes his clubs and loads them 
      into the trunk.

                                  RICHARD 
                    I asked Eli Manning to join us, 
                    hope that s okay.

      Peter with a chuckling yeah-it s-okay high five as a BICYCLE 
      MESSENGER comes skidding up by the entrance and clocks their 
      attire--

                                  MESSENGER
                    Peter Johnson?

                                  PETER
                    You got him.

    The messenger reaches a couple of shrink-wrapped clubs 
      fastened to his backpack and hands them over.

                                  MESSENGER   
                      Compliments of Dylan Mason.

      Richard with a look like, fucking-a. 

                                  PETER
                    Great! Thanks!

      Slips him a five as Richard struggles to keep his game face 
    on.

      EXT. JULIET S APARTMENT BUILDING-DAY

      Dylan steps out of a town car, cell phone to her ear.                                                                            40.

                    He got the clubs? Fantastic! Thank

      PULLING BACK, revealing Zoe and Caitlin stepping out of their *
      cars as well. Caitlin does a quick scope and winces.*

                    Jesus, Mary and Joseph; we re all

    As indeed, they are.

      INT. JULIET S APARTMENT BUILDING-HALLWAY-DAY

      Caitlin, Dylan and Zoe step off the elevator and into the 
      foyer between the opposing doors to the two apartments on the 
      floor. Juliet opens her door, wearing a robe, stuff in her 
      hair. Her initial surprise at seeing all three of them--

                                  JULIET
                    Hi!

        --turnsto alarm before they can reply.

                                  JULIET (CONT D)
                    Jesus Christ. Who died?

      They clearly haven t thought about an opening--

                        ZOEDYLAN
      Nobody. We just thought we d----show of support on the big 
                                                  night!

                      CAITLINJULIET
      I lovethat dress!Well, come on in!

      They all move inside--

      INT. JULIET S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM-DAY

      They walk the thin line between casual drop-in and Bataan 
      Death March. 

                                  JULIET
                    Coffee, tea, should I open a bottle 
                    of wine?

                                  CAITLIN
                    Wine sounds good!

                                  JULIET
                    Wine it is. Just as soon as you 
                    tell me what the hell is going on.

      Looking from one to the other, expectantly. And they glance 
    at each other, in a process that silently chooses Zoe as 
      spokesperson.                                                                            41.


                                  ZOE
                    There s no easy way to say this. I 
                    saw Davis coming out of the Mercer 
                    Hotel with Cilla Grey. Kissing her. 
                    And not just a...nice running into 
                    you kiss. 

      PUSHING IN ON JULIET, unreadable.

                                  JULIET
                          (evenly)
                    And when was this?

                                  ZOE
                    Tuesday afternoon.

                                  JULIET
                    And you re positive it was Davis.

                                  ZOE
                    Yes.

                                  JULIET
                          (a moment, then--)
                    Well, thank you for that. I know it 
                    couldn t have been easy. I ll go 
                    get us that wine.

    And just like that, she goes; leaving Zoe, Caitlin and Dylan 
      trading dumbfounded  that s it?  looks.They rise as one--

                                  CAITLIN
                    Juliet?

      --andgo after her.

      INT. JULIET S APARTMENT-KITCHEN-DAY

    She is wrestling with a corkscrew and a bottle of Chablis as 
    the other three come in.

                                  JULIET
                    Dylan would you grab some glasses?

    And she does. 

                                  ZOE
                    Juliet? Saysomething.

                                  JULIET
                    What s there to say? My husband... 
                    steps out on me.

                                  DYLAN
                    You knew? 

                                  JULIET
                    About Cilla Grey? No. That s kind 
                    of a nasty wrinkle. It s always 
                    been an out-of-town sort of thing. 
                    Would you mind?

    She hands off the bottle and corkscrew to Dylan, rubs her 
      hands together as if to steady the shaking.

                                  CAITLIN
                    But you still stay with him?

      Juliet suddenly turns on her, ferocious.

                                  JULIET
                    Do not judge me! When you vebeen 
                    with someone, anyone, a man, a 
                    woman, an effing petfor fifteen 
                    years, thenwe will talk! YOU DO 
                    NOT GET TO JUDGE ME! 

      Dylan pops the cork, pours a glass and gets it into Juliet s 
      hand with lightning speed. Juliet takes a long swallow.

                                  JULIET (CONT D)
                          (adamant, to all)
                    I m not excusing him. But look at 
                      what...what a man gives up to be 
                    with one of us. We make more money, 
                    we rise higher, we take up more 
                    space; we are as far from the idea 
                    of a wifehe grew up with as it s 
                    possible to be and still wear his 
                    ring and go by his last name.

      Takes another long swallow. Dylan tops her off.

                                  JULIET (CONT D)
                    Don t get me wrong, I hate it. But 
                    I hate the alternative more. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                            43.
                                  JULIET (CONT D)
                    I don t want to be a single mother, 
                    a blind date, a third wheel. I love 
                    having someone to come home to, go 
                    to parties and do the post-mortems 
                    after with, plan holidays for... 

    She breaks off, gently places her glass on the counter, takes 
      a deep, restorative breath.  

                                  JULIET (CONT D)
                    So there it is, the secret to my 
                    happy marriage. But kids, don t try 
                    this at home.

      Giving them all permission to breathe again. Zoe gives her a 
      squeeze of a hug.

                                  ZOE
                    We love you.

                                  JULIET
                    I know you do.

                      CAITLINJULIET
    I m sorry if I...You didn t. Help me with my 
                                                    make-up?

      Juliet holds out a hand to her, picks up her wine with the 
      other. Perez Prado s blazing cover of the Duke Ellington 
      classic  Caravan  surges up on the soundtrack. 

      EXT. CIPRIANI BALLROOM-EAST 42ND ST.-NIGHT

      Music continues, over. A line of limousines, a phalanx of 
      PHOTOGRAPHERS, a swell CROWD pouring in. 

      PUSHING IN ON A LIMOUSINE PULLING UP -- the DRIVER opening 
    the rear door -- getting out one by one, Dylan, Zoe, Caitlin 
    and finally, in all her dressed-to-kill glory, Juliet.

    The other three flank her, steady her, forming an iconic 
      flying wedge, Reservoir Dogs meets Prada runway-- 

                                  JULIET
                    Don t pull me off  til he starts to 
                    turn blue.

      INT. CIPRIANI BALLROOM-EAST 42ND ST.-NIGHT

      --as if by intuition or some invisible force shield, the 
      CROWD PARTS before them as they make their way into the heart 
    of the cocktail crush, past graphic displays for the New York 
      University Child Study Center-- 

                                  CAITLIN
                    I ll get the table numbers--

      Caitlin peels off to the reception tables as Juliet, still 
      flanked by Zoe and Dylan and sporting a dazzling smile as she 
      tosses greetings to FRIENDS all around, closes in on Davis 
    and Emily, who greet her with enthusiastic open arms and 
      bored exasperation, respectively.

                                  DAVIS
                    Wow! Look at you!

    She offers a cheek, he kisses it and takes her hand.

                                  DAVIS (CONT D)
                    Zoe, Dylan, great to see you!

      They respond with quick smiles and curt nods.

      Davis.Hello.

                    Hi Em.

                                  EMILY
                    How long is this thing?

      Juliet is swallowed up by a knot of WELL-WISHERS before she 
    can respond. Zoe and Dylan move in close to Emily. 

                                  ZOE
                    Emily, why don t you pretend that 
                    your Mom is one of your friends, 
                    just for tonight.

                                  DYLAN
                    A friend who s been kind of down

                    you do that?

    The challenge in their expressions brooking only one answer--

                                  EMILY
                          (cowed)

    The ASSEMBLED move in a herd--

      INT. BALLROOM-JULIET S TABLE-NIGHT

      A table of twelve, Juliet sitting next to Davis, Emily on the 
      other side of her as, on stage at a podium, the President of 
    the Board of Trustees, GRIFFIN STERN, 50, introduces Juliet.

                                  GRIFFIN
                    The woman we honor tonight can 
                    truly be called a  force of 
                    nature . 
                                  (MORE)                                                                            45.
                                  GRIFFIN (CONT'D)
                    She s as warm as a June afternoon, 
                    inspiring as a mountain view, and 
                    as anyone who has tried to say  no  
                    to her can attest, she can be as 
                    fierce and unrelenting as a 
                    hurricane.

      Laughter, applause. Juliet leans in to Davis, close to his 
      ear:

                        JULIETGRIFFIN
      I know about Cilla Grey.Listen to these numbers...

      Davis smile freezes and fades, the color drains from his 
      face.

                        DAVISGRIFFIN
    I m so sorry. Five point eight million 
                                                    dollars raised in the last 
                                                  twelve months.

                                                    million dollars...

      PUSHING IN CLOSER ON THEM, all other sound dropping out.

                                  DAVIS
                    It s over, as of right now.

                                  JULIET
                    It sure as hell better be.

                                  DAVIS
                          (abject)
                    What can I do? Just tell me what to 
                    do.

                                  JULIET
                    You know what you can do, Davis? 
                    Take a good look around at all our 
                    friends. Go on...

    He looks around, uncertain.

                                  DAVIS
                    Okay...

                                  JULIET
                    Now, you won t know who and you 
                    won t know when, but I am going to 
                    take one of them as my lover, and I 
                    am going to do things with him that 
                    would curl your toes. And then I am 
                    going to end it, and you and I can 
                    start over with a clean slate.

    The ambient SOUND comes back up--

                                  GRIFFIN
                    Ladies and Gentlemen, Juliet 
                    Draper.                                                                            46.


      APPLAUSE, tables STANDING, as she turns on her dazzling smile 
    and starts weaving her way to the stage.

      Davis is slumped in his seat, like he s just taken a bullet.

      ANOTHER ANGLE-DYLAN TO ZOE TO CAITLIN

    At adjoining tables, alerting each other to the sight of 
      Emily prodding her father to his feet. He reaches out with a 
      shaky hand, grabs his drink and downs it in one long gulp.

                                  JULIET
                    Thank you Griffin, thank you all so 
                    very much...

      Bathing in the applause as the  O Fortuna  from Orff s 
       Carmina Burana  comes up on the soundtrack. 

    Zoe checks her watch, reacts with alarm, and bolts.

      EXT. FRIENDS MEETING HOUSE SCHOOL-NIGHT

      Music continues, as Zoe runs double-time down the sidewalk 
    and up the steps.

      INT. FRIENDS MEETING HOUSE SCHOOL-NIGHT

      Music continues, as she takes a staircase three steps at a 
      time--

      --and bursts through double doors and goes tearing down a 
      long, empty corridor. A heel snaps, she bends down and takes 
    off her shoes, barely breaking stride--

      --she rounds a corner and skids to a stop by the auditorium 
      entrance, where a couple of other LATE MOMS are waiting and a 
      MATRONLY TEACHER is standing guard. Zoe, breathless, reaches 
    for the door as the music builds further--

                                  MATRON
                    Sorry. No one s allowed back in 
                    until intermission.

                                  ZOE
                    You re kiddingme.

                      MATRONZOE
    No, I m not.My daughter sin there.

                                  MATRON
                    It ll just be a few minutes.

    Zoe notices--

      --further up the corridor, A little GIRL in a tutu is 
      throwing up in a wastebasket, by the backstage door-- 

    Zoe bolts, stops to tuck back the little girl s hair, slips 
    in the backstage door and feels her way along in the dark, in 
    the wings, as--                                                                             47.


      --on the stage, a dozen GIRLS ranging in age from 7 to 11, 
      including Sasha, are doing their best with an over-the-top 
       Ode to Spring  choreographed to the Orff cantata--

      --Zoe stays out of the lights as best she can, bangs a shin 
    and muffles her curse, edging her way down and into the 
      auditorium. Sasha sees her, reacts with surprise and misses a 
      step; Zoe grins and gives her a thumbs-up--

      --and scans the auditorium for Eric or an empty seat as 
      hushed and urgent  down in fronts  come flying from the 
      darkened house. She spots Eric and his sheepish little wave 
    and makes her way to his row--

      --as hundreds of eyes shoot daggers and the  O Fortuna  
      reaches it s crescendo. She sits down next to him, dabs sweat 
      from her brow and grins, giddy with triumph.

                                  ZOE
                            (whispering)
                    I made it! 

                                  ERIC
                          (a moment, then--)
                    They offered me the job.

      Music ends, APPLAUSE breaks out. Zoe and Eric look at each 
      other, like, now what?



                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                            48.

                                        ACT FIVE

      INT. GORHAM, SUTTER-CLAYTON S OFFICE-DAY

      Clayton is standing at the window with his back to the camera 
      watching the rain pour down as Zoe comes in.

                                  ZOE
                    Good morning.

                                  CLAYTON
                    Not exactly. What the hell did you 
                    say to Kate? 

                                  ZOE
                          (gingerly)
                    I didn t say anything to Kate.

                                  CLAYTON
                    She wants me to put two hundred and 
                    fifty thousand dollars in an escrow 
                    account in case of  wrongful 
                      termination . You tell her to do 
                    that?

                                  ZOE
                    Of course not. Look, Clay, why 
                    don t you just cut...whatever it 
                    is, off.

                                  CLAYTON
                    I can t. I haven t felt like this 
                    in years. You wouldn t understand.

    He turns around. He s got quite a shiner crowding his left 
      eye.

                                  ZOE
                    What happened?

                                  CLAYTON
                          (evasive)
                    Racquetball. Now what did you want 
                    to see me about?

                                  ZOE
                    Eric s been offered a job that 
                    would take him out of town. I d 
                    have to cut back on traveling.

                                  CLAYTON
                          (a moment, then--)
                    I guess Kate can handle the road 
                    shows as long as you re on the 
                    sidelines calling in plays.

                                  ZOE
                    Kate? 

                                  CLAYTON
                    We re all spread thin as it is. If 
                    she s willing to step up, what s 
                    the problem?                                                                             49.


                                  ZOE
                    Well, she s inexperienced for one 
                    thing--

                                  CLAYTON
                    So now she ll getthe experience, 
                    and we ll see what she s made of. 
                    You were green once yourself, you 
                    know. And then you got your shot.

      PUSH IN ON ZOE, pinched between a rock and a hard place.

      INT. CHLOE PARRISH-ALICIA S OFFICE-DAY

      Alicia at her desk, the bouquet of flowers arranged in a vase 
    by her computer. She is poring over a marketing report and 
      surrounded by piles of them. Caitlin knocks on Alicia s door, 
      leans in--

                                  CAITLIN
                    I m taking a pitch at four that I d 
                    like you to sit in on. 
                          (re: flowers)
                    What a beautiful arrangement.

                                  ALICIA
                    My darling little brother. I think 
                    he s trying to make up for his 
                    hideous behavior when we were 
                    children. 

      Caitlin like, there is a god. And makes the leap---- 

                                  CAITLIN
                    Listen, are you free for a drink 
                    after work? I know it s kind of 
                    last minute, but-- 

                                  ALICIA
                    I d like that very much.

      Betty Buckley s aching rendition of  I Had A Dream About You  
      insinuates onto the soundtrack.

      INT. ZOE S BROWNSTONE-ERIC S STUDIO-EARLY EVENING

      Music continues, over. Zoe, hair wet and wrapped in a robe, 
          knocks-once-and-enters Eric s studio on the top floor. Eric 
    is stretched out on a huge old leather Chesterfield couch, on 
    the phone.

                                  ERIC
                          (into phone)
                    ...I sure will Alan, and thanks 
                    again. You too. Bye.

    He buttons off the phone as she curls up on the couch.

                                  ZOE
                    I told the kids they could watch a 
                    half-hour of  Cars .                                                                             50.

                    Man, when it rains, it pours.

                                  ZOE
                    What?

                                  ERIC
                    A couple from school? They just had 
                    a bid accepted for a townhouse on 
                    Bedford Street. They ve seen our 
                    place and they want a version of 
                    what I did here, and right away.  

                                  ZOE
                    Is it an offer?

                                  ERIC
                    A really good one, and too great an 
                      opportunity to pass up, portfolio-
                    wise. Plus you wouldn t have to cut 
                    back.

                                  ZOE
                    I was happy to do that, you know.

    He pulls her close and kisses her.

                                  ZOE (CONT D)
                    So when have they been here?

                                  ERIC
                    Playdates. It s Jason s parents, 
                    the Keeners?

                                  ZOE
                    That Victoria has a thing for you, 
                    you know. 

      There s just the slightest hitch as he considers his response 
    for a split-second.

                                  ERIC
                    Hamburger.

    She opens her robe and climbs on top of him. 

                                  ZOE
                    So how do you like your steak done, 
                    Mister?

      Silencing his laugh with a hungry kiss and getting down to 
      business. Music continues.

      shakes hands with Hughes by his door.

                                  HUGHES
                    Tell you the truth, no one s more 
                    surprised than me. But you ve 
                    earned it, Dylan. Congratulations. 

                                  DYLAN
                    Thankyou, Robert.

    He opens the door for her and she goes out--

      INT. CORRIDOR-CONTINUOUS-SAME

      --and takes a few dignified steps and then breaks into a 
      combination Footloose-End Zone dance down the hallway, 
      oblivious of the looks from COLLEAGUES, exultant. Music 
      continues--

      EXT. TOWN BAR AND RESTAURANT-NIGHT

      Music continues, over and under. Caitlin and Alicia walk out 
      together, lit up with drinks and laughing. Caitlin s Jaguar 
    is waiting at the curb.

                                  CAITLIN
                    Can I drop you?

                                  ALICIA
                    I m meeting my brother for dinner 
                    in Brooklyn. I ll just take a 
                    taxi...

      A shy, charged shuffle; Caitlin takes her gently by the 
      elbows and brushes a kiss to both cheeks. 

                                  CAITLIN
                    This was fun. Good night...                                                                            52.


    But as she steps back, Alicia catches her eye with a 
      challenging, mischievous, unmistakably erotic look and 
      Caitlin s breath catches--

      --and Alicia steps up and kisses her full on the mouth. And 
      they melt together in a shyly passionate little shuffle right 
      there on the sidewalk--

      --as Cilla Grey passes by on her way in, recognizing Caitlin 
      with a look of surprise, quickly turning away and 
      disappearing inside, unnoticed by Caitlin. The kiss ends.

                                  CAITLIN (CONT D)
                          (after a moment, 
                            breathless)
                    I should tell you. I ve had a. 
                    Terrible time with men. And no real 
                      experience. With women. So I m kind 
                    of, you know. Flying without the 
                      instruments here and--

      Alicia silences her with another kiss.

                                  ALICIA
                    And I should tell you that you re a 
                    wonderful kisser. I m late, see you 
                    Monday...

    And with a last peck she runs off towards the avenue, hailing 
      a cab. Caitlin leans back against the wall, closing her eyes, 
      thrilled and scared all at once. 

      INT. BARNET-NASH-DYLAN S OFFICE-NIGHT

      Music continues, over and under. Dylan is on the phone with 
    her feet up on the desk, on the phone, expansive. 

                                  DYLAN
                    ...I don t know how he took it 
                     cause I haven t seen him yet. 

      A knock on the door, followed by Richard with a bottle of 
      Patron and two shot glasses.

                                  DYLAN (CONT D)
                          (into phone)
                    This is him. Talk to you later..
                          (hangs up)
                    I was wondering where you went...

                                  RICHARD
                    I took the liberty of expensing 
                    this to you. Congratulations...

      She s up and around her desk in a flash.

                                  DYLAN
                    You mean it?

                                  RICHARD
                    Of course I do.                                                                             53.


    He opens the bottle and pours out shots and clinks her glass 
      with his.

                                  RICHARD (CONT D)
                    To the Queen of All Media. Cheers.

    He drinks, puts down his glass, slides her a rueful smile.

                                  RICHARD (CONT D)
                    My team s taking me out for a Last 
                    Supper. I m gonna have to run...

                                  DYLAN
                    Then I ll see you later?

                                  RICHARD
                    Oh, and Pablo called with their 
                      counter-offer on the loft. Two-
                    eight, which mean you can probably 
                    get it for around two-five. And 
                    they do have a permit for the 
                    terrace renovation, my lawyer got a 
                    copy...

    He slips an envelope from his jacket and hands it to her.

                                  DYLAN
                          (uneasy)
                    Richard? What s going on?

                                  RICHARD
                          (a moment, then, measured)
                    I thought I could do it, Dylan. I 
                    tried, I swear. I thought I d win 
                    and I d buy us the loft and take 
                    care of you and...and now that it s 
                    reversed I just can t see...us, or 
                    my place in it. I m really sorry. 

                                  DYLAN
                          (stunned)
                    I can t believe you re doing this.

                                  RICHARD
                    Dylan, I m forty next month. I want 
                    someone to come home to, I m going 
                    to want kids, and we re just going 
                    in opposite directions. 

                                  DYLAN
                          (angrily)
                    You don t know what I want! 

                                  RICHARD
                    Yes I do. More than anything else, 
                    you want to win. 

      This stings, silencing her. He takes a swig from the bottle 
    and goes. PUSH IN ON DYLAN, as she catches her refection in 
    the mirror hanging over the couch and it s as if, just for a 
      moment, she s doesn t recognize the woman staring back at 
      her.                                                                             54.


    She tosses the envelope he gave her aside and downs the shot 
    he poured her like it was liquid courage. Music continues, 
      over--


                                  END OF ACT FIVE                                                                            55.

                                        ACT SIX

      EXT. MAXWELL S RESTAURANT-MIDTOWN-DAY

      CAMERA crossing the street and PUSHING INSIDE. Max is our 
      narrator again, instructive--

                                  MAX (VO)
                    Another thing about them? They 
                    rarely ask for favors, and when 
                    they do, we hop to it... 

      INT. MAXWELL S RESTAURANT-MIDTOWN-DAY

      --and through the boisterous lunchtime circus, past Max and 
      Sean huddled at the end of the bar, to the table by the 
      window. Juliet, Caitlin, Zoe and Dylan, in the huddle.

                                  MAX (VO CONT D) 
                    ...without comment or question, 
                    grateful for the opportunity.

                                  JULIET
                    ...and I told him that after a 
                    while I would end the affair and we 
                    would start over with a level 
                    playing field.

                                  DYLAN
                    Wow. Good for you.

                                  ZOE
                    Do you think you can really go 
                    through with it?

                                  DYLAN
                    Hey, we re not talking about oral 
                    surgery here.

                                  CAITLIN
                    Just oral. Ha ha.

                                  JULIET
                          (a moment then, 
                            thoughtful)
                    Most of me hopes I can; part of me 
                    hopes I can t. I do love Davis, you 
                    know.

      Nods, sips, silence for a moment as this lands on all.

                                  JULIET (CONT D)
                          (to Dylan)
                    How d Richard take your promotion?

                                  DYLAN
                          (casual)
                    He was really sweet about it. He s 
                    going to take some time off, 
                    travel, figure out his next move.

                                  CAITLIN
                    What about the loft?                                                                            56.


                                  DYLAN
                    That s on hold  til we see where he 
                    lands.

      They all get it, and they all hide that they get it, because 
      sometimes that s what friends do.

                                  ZOE
                          (looking off--)
                    Heads up.

      ANOTHER ANGLE-BY THE DOOR

      Cilla Grey entering with Pablo, clearly distraught.

                                  PABLO
                    You know how it is, Cilla. The 
                    board doesn t have to give a reason 
                    for turning you down.

                                  CILLA
                    Well next time could we do our 
                    homework and find something I can 
                    fall in love with and actually buy?

                                  PABLO
                    Of course.

    She turns on a high-beam smile for Sean, the maitre d.

                                  CILLA
                    How are you, Sean!?

      Tight smile, squints at his reservations ledger.

                                  SEAN
                          (politely)
                    I m sorry, Ms. Grey, but I ve got 
                    nothing down for you.

                                  CILLA
                          (gesturing)
                    Sean, I m that table right over--

    And she breaks off, incredulous, seeing that her table is 
      taken. The favor, granted.

                                  CILLA (CONT D)
                    There s been a terrible mistake. 
                    Where s Max?

                                  SEAN
                          (nail in the coffin)
                    As you know, Ms. Grey, Max goes 
                    over the book personally, every 
                    morning.

    She gets it. Pablo clears his throat and inspects his shoes. 
    She takes a step forward, affording her a view of Juliet and 
      company, who keep their eyes fixed on her for just long 
      enough to register and then go back to each other.                                                                            57.


                                  PABLO
                          (taking her arm)
                    We ll go to my club--

                                  CILLA
                    One minute.

    And she strides past Sean and into the room and up to them, 
      primed for the unthinkable. A confrontation. In Maxwells. 
      During lunch. On a workday. All four look up with pleasant, 
      expectant smiles.

                                  CILLA (CONT D)
                    The Cashmere Mafia. That s what 
                    they call you, you know.

                                  JULIET
                    Really?

                                  CILLA
                    I was sleeping with your husband. 
                    You don t want to know what I know 
                    about you.  

                                  JULIET
                          (pointedly)
                    And vice-vera. Careful there.

                                  CILLA
                          (to Caitlin)
                    I d changed my mind about the 
                    apartment anyway. Not enough closet 
                    space.See you around the campus, 
                    girls.

      Waltzing off, head held high. They glance at one another. 

                      JULIETDYLAN
      What was that?Closet space?

                                  CAITLIN
                          (shrugs, casual--)
                    No idea.

      Frowns, smiles, a roll of the eyes. The silent language of a 
      united front.

                                  ZOE
                    Who s ready to order?

      A waiter appears.

                        JULIETCAITLIN
      I ll have the salmon?Cobb Salad.

                        DYLANZOE
      Cobb.Steak Frites, medium rare?

                                  JULIET
                    Hold on. Me too.                                                                            58.


                      CAITLINDYLAN
      That does sound good.Make it four.

    The waiter moves off as Max moves in with a bottle of Dom 
      Perignonand four champagne flutes. He sets the glasses and 
      pours--

                                  MAX
                    I understand some congratulations 
                    are in order here. Cheers, Dylan.

                                  DYLAN
                    Thank you, Max.

      Juliet, Zoe and Caitlin all raise their glasses to her as the 
      Rolling Stones  celebratory  She s a Rainbow  sneaks up on 
    the soundtrack.

                                  DYLAN *
                    I don t know what I d do without *
