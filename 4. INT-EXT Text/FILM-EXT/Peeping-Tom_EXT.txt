LONG SHOT of the solitary figure of a WOMAN standing
professionally alone at the end of the street.
It is a bright, still night. We can HEAR the Woman whistling
'Stardust' merrily to herself.
CAMERA TRACKS around her. A Man's footsteps are overlaid.
We HEAR the Man start to whistle 'Stardust' under his breath -
haltingly at first, then in time with the Woman.
As we approach, she glances at us over her shoulder - then
turns round for a better look.
Her whistling stops - so, at the same moment, does the
man's.
CLOSE SHOT of DORA - a plump, attractive brunette - still
young enough to need two glances at the customers.
She smiles at us - and is pleased with the reception. She
hesitates for a long moment, weighing us up carefully...
and then - half defiantly, half expecting to be laughed
at.
DORA
It'll be two quid...
Evidently we have two quid.
She beams with relief - throws her fur over her shoulders,
jerks her head towards the right - and sets off.
CAMERA TRACKS after her.
Overlaid is the sound of the
man's footsteps.
Dora resumes her whistling. So, under his breath, does the
man who is following her.
A wider street than the last - but just as empty.
Dora sways her way towards a small house. CAMERA FOLLOWS
at a respectful distance.
CAMERA PANS from Dora's hips to an overflowing dustbin.
CLOSE SHOT of a man's hand throwing something into the
dustbin. It is an empty packet marked Kodak Film.
CAMERA
PANS to Dora's house. It stands next to a chemist shop.
Dora climbs the few steps which lead to her front door -
glances round at us encouragingly - then unlocks the door.
It is very dark.
CLOSE SHOT of a stack of deck chairs.
Two forms behind it - a MAN'S and a WOMAN'S.
They are intertwined and motionless... suddenly a brilliant
shaft of light is trained onto them.
Overlaid is a gentle, whirring sound.
CAMERA PANS quickly to a nearby tree.
CLOSE SHOT of the lens of a cine-camera - the motor
purring... a blinding spotlight.
CAMERA PANS to the couple - the whirring of the camera is
overlaid.
The Man leaps up - shielding his eyes against the light.
He advances towards the tree.
MAN
Hey, you peeping...
The spotlight goes out. There is the sound of footsteps
running away  and the night is at peace again.
And now WE SEE who DIRECTED the picture.
DISSOLVE TO:
LONG SHOT. AMBULANCE - DAY
It is standing in the roadway outside Dora's house.
WE SEE it through the finder of a small cine-camera.
A crowd has gathered outside the house - and we are watching
them from a corner of the street (ALWAYS THROUGH THE FINDER-
MATTE).
WE SEE several Policemen holding back the crowd as two
Ambulance Men hurry into the house, carrying an empty
stretcher.
Gentle, whirring sound is overlaid.
WE SEE children staring curiously into the empty ambulance -
and a group of Women talking excitedly to a Reporter.
CLOSE SHOT of a SMALL MAN looking at us curiously as he
approaches (FILLING THE SCREEN WITHIN THE MATTE).
SMALL MAN
What paper are you from?
The finder is lowered.
CLOSE SHOT of a Young Man (MARK) sighting a cine-camera.
He lowers the camera - and turns politely to his
interrogator.
He seems to have slight difficulty informing his words.
MARK
I beg your pardon?
SMALL MAN
What paper are you from?
Mark smiles at him pleasantly.
MARK
The Observer.
The Ambulance Men come out of the house carrying the
stretcher... there is a body on it covered by a sheet.
Mark raises his cine-camera and photographs them. He
photographs the ambulance as it drives off. He photographs
the Policemen dispersing the crowd. He photographs his
Interrogator, who gladly poses for him.
Then he slings his camera over his shoulder, and strolls
away.
DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE SHOT of Dora, smiling happily.
Her photograph is on the front page of a newspaper.
Above it is a caption: BRUTALLY MURDERED.
CAMERA PULLS BACK - to show sexy magazines alongside the
newspaper.
Mark is staring at a newspaper in the window of a small
newsagent's shop.
He glances distastefully at an array of film magazines -
showing actresses showing everything - then hurries into
the shop.
The chap from upstairs presses his face to the window.
From his POV WE SEE Helen's eyes looking at him - the key
of the door in them - looking at him, not staring. Suddenly
the rest comes into focus - Tony's arm around Helen's
shoulder... the high-backed chair in the foreground with
the back of that motionless head... a young couple giggling
as they stare at him. Mark steps away, and the CAMERA PULLS
BACK with him.
We catch a glimpse of the house - large, sprawling, but
with a touch of quality about it, in a quiet, unpretentious
street.
Mark hurries towards a side entrance.
CLOSE SHOT of Vivian munching a sandwich.
CAMERA PULLS BACK
She is leaning against a wall in a corner of an exterior
set - a Chinese temple or a medieval castle (or a
combination of each like a Pinewood drawing-room).
Beside her she has a small tape-recorder, or record-player.
We hear music - modem rhythms.
There are several people strolling about - but no one in
the immediate vicinity. No one... except Mark.
CLOSE SHOT of Mark - settling down on the other side of
the wall (where they can talk without being seen together).
VIVIAN
Mark?
MARK
Hallo...
VIVIAN
Were you spotted?
MARK
Don't think so.
VIVIAN
(switches off music)
Is it tonight?
CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
MARK
Yes.
CLOSE SHOT of Vivian.
VIVIAN
Mark...
MARK
Yes?
VIVIAN
You're sure we won't be caught?
MARK
Not if you do as I tell you.
VIVIAN
I will, I promise.
MARK
You haven't... said anything... to
anyone?
VIVIAN
Of course not.
MARK
Good... like some cake?
VIVIAN
Thank you.
We see him break off a piece of birthday cake, and pass it
over to her.
VIVIAN
Mark... I want to be quite clear
about this...
CLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at his cake.
VIVIAN
Tonight, when the studio's empty...
I'm to come back-and you're going
to give me a film test... right?
MARK
Right.
VIVIAN
You'll then print the film - so I
can show it to my agent and anyone
else who matters - right?
MARK
Right.
VIVIAN
Mark...
She hesitates.
VIVIAN
I've been offered film tests
before... but I haven't liked the
terms.
MARK
There aren't any.
VIVIAN
Then why are you doing this? Risking
your job and...
MARK
Not just for you... Viv... I have
an agent too - and I want to show
him what I can do... I want to
direct...
VIVIAN
(switching on music
again)
There's someone coming.
Mark lies motionless behind the wall. A young male EXTRA
comes towards Vivian.
EXTRA
Hallo - lousy morning's work, wasn't
it?
VIVIAN
Yes.
EXTRA
Thought I saw you talking to
somebody...
VIVIAN
I was learning my lines.
EXTRA
Didn't know you had any...
He glances at his watch.
EXTRA
Want a drink? Dutch?
VIVIAN
Later... perhaps.
EXTRA
Be seeing you
He wanders off.
VIVIAN
Mark...
MARK
Yes?
VIVIAN
(switching off music
again)
You didn't mind me asking?
MARK
No, more cake?
VIVIAN
No... you want to direct... more
badly than anything don't you?
Mark is silent, staring at the sky.
VIVIAN
Don't you, Mark?
MARK
I want... to photograph... the
impossible...
VIVIAN
What is impossible?
MARK
Something... that has never been
photographed before.
VIVIAN
What?
MARK
You really want to know...?
VIVIAN
Very much, especially if there's a
part for me.
MARK
I want... to photograph a murder...
while it's being committed.
VIVIAN
No part for me then.
MARK
But that... isn't enough.
VIVIAN
Is this a new script?
MARK
I want... to frighten... someone...
to death... and photograph... their
expression of fear...
VIVIAN
Mark! What's this story called?
MARK
That is something... he never
photographed...
VIVIAN
Who?
Mark is silent.
VIVIAN
Who is he, Mark?
MARK
Anyone.
VIVIAN
No one could... they'd be caught!
MARK
I wouldn't care... if I had my
picture.
VIVIAN
Besides, how would you frighten
anyone to death?
MARK
There's a way.
VIVIAN
Well, what?
MARK
There's a way.
VIVIAN
You'd better not tell me! I'll be
scared to death tonight as it is!
A hooter.
VIVIAN
Back on the set - shall I go first?
MARK
Please.
She rises to her feet. From behind the wall comes a gentle
whirring purring sound.
VIVIAN
What are you doing?
MARK
Getting into practice.
She smiles down at him.
VIVIAN
See you tonight!
MARK
See you tonight!
She walks away. And the gentle purring continues. CAMERA
PANS to the sun beating down on the lot.
DISSOLVE TO:
An arc lamp beating down on the set.
The cars are streaming towards the gate.
CLOSE SHOT of Baden driving a small new car.
CLOSE SHOT of the Chief Cameraman driving a large old one.
Only a few cars now remain. It is beginning to grow dark.
Don Jarvis strides across the courtyard. We can almost
hear - and perhaps we do - a cash register ringing up.
One of the white-clad figures lounging indolently in the
doorway glances round, sees the Inquisition approaching
and freezes. His degree of terror might satisfy Mark.
The great man strides on.
DISSOLVE TO:
Don Jarvis is leaving the unit working on the lot. It is
now bustling with activity.
A girl comes up to him... She raises her cigarette for a
light - and looks into his eyes.
He hands her a box of matches... and walks away.
Over his
shoulder we see the other stages - apparently empty. Don
Jarvis hesitates, then strides towards one.
A police car. There are two men seated at the back.
The Young Extra who spoke to Vivian in the exterior set
points excitedly to the wall where Vivian and Mark lay.
The Inspector and Sergeant carefully examine both sides of
the wall. The Inspector stoops, picks up something with a
pair of tweezers and puts it in an envelope.
CAMERA PANS.
A few passers-by look on from a distance. One of them is
watching through his cine-camera.
DISSOLVE TO:
The carpark is jammed with cars - but there is hardly anyone
in sight. Mark hurries towards the large sliding doors of
Stage E - they are a few feet apart. He looks round
carefully, then slips inside.
They walk down the steps of the house.
MARK
There's a small place round the
corner... It's awfully good on
Christmas Day.
HELEN
Is it?
MARK
Yes... there aren't too many open
then.
HELEN
No - it sounds fun.
MARK
This way.
CLOSE SHOT of Mark and Helen walking along by the side of
the house.
HELEN
I adore new restaurants...
Suddenly Mark stands motionless. He is staring at something
off camera.
Especially when -
Her voice trails away... she is staring at Mark staring at
something.
In the shadows, at the mouth of an alley, a young couple
are kissing.
Mark stands motionless, staring at them. Automatically his
hand reaches for his camera. Helen starts to speak - then
looks at him in silence. The man glances round. Mark hurries
away and Helen stares after him.
CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
He turns back - waiting for Helen.
From his POV WE SEE Helen come slowly towards him. She
looks at him searchingly for a long moment.
He manages - but only just - to meet her eyes.
HELEN
Where is this restaurant?
MARK
Round the corner...
MRS. STEPHENS
Know much about films?
HELEN
Come on then...
CLOSE SHOT of Mark.
MARK
Thank you.
They walk slowly down the street.
DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens.
MRS. STEPHENS
Sorry, young man, Helen's out.
CAMERA PULLS BACK
They walk along the street very close together, but not
quite touching. Above them a light is shining on a blind
revealing a shadow of a woman undressing.
Mark glances at the blind - then looks away quickly.
He stares ahead of him... and continues to stare ahead of
him.
Suddenly Helen tucks her arm through his, and smiles up at
him... they walk on in silence.
DISSOLVE TO:
The Inspector and Doctor are standing by the bushes where
Mark and Vivian met.
INSPECTOR
Is that all he wanted?
DOCTOR
think so... we had a little chat
about scoptophilia - and he's going
to show me...
INSPECTOR
About what?
DOCTOR
Voyeurism.
INSPECTOR
Eh?
DOCTOR
What makes people into Peeping
Toms, one of his father's subjects,
apparently.
INSPECTOR
(slowly)
Peeping Toms...
DOCTOR
An interesting boy... he has his
father's eyes... you don't suspect
him, do you?
INSPECTOR
I suspect 'em all - what about
you?
DOCTOR
I'm interested in that chap with
the bald head and hatchet face...
there's something on his mind!
INSPECTOR
No wonder... he's the director!
He turns away thoughtfully.
DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE SHOT of Mark glancing impatiently at his watch.
LONG SHOT of very modern, glass-walled building. Helen
comes out with a manuscript in a parcel under her arm.
Mark watches her. Beyond him stands an insignificant-looking
man in a raincoat.
Helen looks at her watch.
Mark looks at his.
INSERT: 5.45.
Helen hurries homeward.
Mark slowly turns his back and walks away, gradually
gathering speed. The man in the raincoat follows him.
Mark hurries towards the shop... ahead of him a street
clock stands at just on six. Mark unslings his cine-camera
and photographs this clock... then he hurries into the
shop.
The man in the raincoat walks into camera. He looks at the
clock, puzzled, then glances at the newsagent's window. He
gazes with interest at Mark's photograph of Milly, then
walks thoughtfully down the street.
All the clocks in the kingdom chime the hour of six.
From the opposite side of the street, we see Mr. Peters
locking the door of the shop, and hurrying down the road.
The man in the raincoat watches him, puzzled.
CLOSE SHOT of Milly - very angry, in a dressing-gown.
MILLY
You've spoiled my whole evening,
you have!
Mark gets into his taxi. As the driver pulls down the
flag...
CUT TO:
Mrs. Stephens' head falling on to her chest.
Taxi arrives and Mark gets out.
An empty taxi cruising down the street. It passes the
Detective in the raincoat walking away from Mark's house.
DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE SHOT of a note on a flyleaf which reads 'From one
Magic Camera - which needs the help of Another'.
The Police arrive: three cars.
Mark appears at an upstairs
window with his camera.
SERGEANT
Look out!
He thinks Mark has a gun. They all duck. Mark raises his
camera and photographs them. The Police recover and charge
for the house. Mark disappears.
