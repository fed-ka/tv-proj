      WIDER TO REVEAL - Sun - kneeling over some flowers, holding 
      one by the stem, taking in the scent, then RACK FOCUS - to  *
      show JIN - standing by the shore, struggling with a live, 
      writhing fish he has plucked from the water -

                                  JIN
                    Sun!  I need your help!  Come here!

      Sun turns to her husband.  Her response is dutiful -

                                  SUN
                    I m sorry.  I m coming.

    - but her expression says otherwise.  Turning to gather her 
      flowers, Sun s vision drifts - and lands on another couple -


      JACK AND KATE - we JOIN THEM as they pack up to HEAD INTO THE 
      JUNGLE.  Kate shucks empty WATER BOTTLES into her backpack, 
      Jack wrestles with the tangled straps of his pack.

                                  KATE
                    I want to know.

                                  JACK
                    Well you re not gonna know.

                                  KATE
                    What s the big deal?

                                  JACK*
                    It s not a big deal.

      Kate stands and steps up close, taking the straps of Jack s 
      backpack and reaching over his shoulder for a stray clip - 
      her arms brush his TATTOOED SKIN repeatedly, a fact not lost 
      on either one of them, even as they try to be casual -

                                  KATE
                    It s just the tattoos and you don t 
                    add up.
                          (playfully)
                    What re you - one of those really 
                    hardcore spinal surgeons?

      Jack smiles -- but how he got his ink is his business.*

                                  JACK
                    Yeah.  That s me.  Hardcore.

      The repartee comes to an abrupt end as CHARLIE - also wearing 
    a backpack - steps up -

                                    CHARLIE
                    If you two are through verbally 
                      copulating, maybe we ought to get a 
                    move on.  We have a beach full of 
                    people waiting for us to go get 
                    them some drinking water... and the 
                    Great White Hunter s getting 
                    restless.

      Charlie indicates LOCKE, waiting by the tree line.  Stoic.  
      SHAVING his stubble with a DISPOSABLE RAZOR.

                                  JACK
                    Okay.  Let s do this.

                                  KATE
                    Hey, Charlie -- Ask Jack about his 
                    tattoos.*

                                    CHARLIE
                    Ah.  You two have an inside joke.  
                    How wonderful for you both.

      And Jack and Kate actually LAUGH as the three head off, we 
      MOVE BACK ACROSS THE BEACH TO FIND -*


    - Sun.  A wistful sadness descends as she watches Jack and  *
      Kate, then turns to see Jin, who has wrapped the fish in a *
      shirt and HITS IT WITH A ROCK -

    - Jin finishes off the fish, then looks up to see MICHAEL and  *
      WALT, crossing in front of him as they walk across the shore. *

      RESUME ON SUN, looking away and picking up her flowers -

      MATCH CUT TO - a beautiful bouquet of white orchids at - 


    - a GALA for KOREAN HIGH SOCIETY.  Red-jacketed WAITERS serve 
      the throng.  And in the CENTER of it all --*

      SUN - a princess in a cocktail dress - giggling with a crowd 
      of GIRLFRIENDS.  Sun s hair, clothes, and most importantly, 
      HER ATTITUDE makes it clear that this happened years ago - 
      when she was a carefree child of privilege.

      While Sun and her friends point out young men in the crowd - 
    a WAITER approaches -

                                  WAITER
                    Another drink, Miss?

      Sun turns to take the flute from the waiter s tray - and 
      suddenly we realize -- THE WAITER IS JIN - Young.  Sweet.  
      SERVILE.  A harsh contrast to the man we know on the island.

      Sun and Jin exchange a look.  And then he s gone.

      Sun takes a drink - and notices something written on the 
      napkin.  Sun smiles to herself as her friends continue to 
      gossip, closing her hand tightly around the napkin.


      The party ECHOES in the distance.  Sun stands in this 
      secluded spot.  Senses something behind her.  Turns to see --

                                  JIN
                    Miss -- You left something.

                                  SUN
                    Really?  What?

      Jin approaches... and SUDDENLY -- He pulls Sun into his arms 
      and plants a PASSIONATE kiss on her lips.  And YEAH, these 
      two are having a big-time LOVE AFFAIR.  Sun disengages, 
      looking around nervously:









                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"      (BLUE)      8/17/04     4.

                  SUN (CONT D)
      My father -- is busy being host.

                                  SUN (CONT D)
                    We need to get away.  Now.

                                  JIN
                    Where?

                                  SUN
                    America.

      Jin looks at her - they ve had this discussion before:

                                  JIN
                    Sun.  Look at me.  I love you... 
                    but I have my honor.  I m not going 
                    to kidnap you to another country.

                                  SUN
                    It s the only chance we have to -

                        JINSUN
      Your father would never allow 
      it.-- It s not his place to 
                                                    allow...

                                  JIN
                    Just let me talk to him.  I ll make 
                    him understand.

                                  SUN
                    You don t know him.

                                  JIN
                    I know me.

      Jin smiles again - radiating megawatt charm.  He reaches into  *
      his jacket -- pulls out A WHITE ORCHID.*

                                  SUN*
                    It s beautiful...

                                  JIN
                    I wish it were a diamond ring.  
                    Someday it will be.

      As they fall into a kiss...*

    A FOOT stomps DOWN ON SUN S FLOWERS.  Sun looks up - confused 
    - realizes that her flowers were just destroyed by -

    - JIN.  His EYES BURNING.  STRIDING past several CASTAWAYS to  *
    a stretch of shore obscured by a PIECE OF LANDING GEAR where - *

    - MICHAEL and WALT walk - unaware of the oncoming danger --  *
      SUN gets to her feet, confused -- RUSHES after her husband --

                                  SUN
                    Jin?  What s the matter?  Wait...

    - but Jin is already there -- and without any warning - He *
      LAUNCHES HIMSELF AT MICHAEL.

      Michael struggles, but Jin has him trapped - unleashes a  *
      vicious salvo - this isn t a fight, it s a beating.  Michael  *
      never saw it coming -- Walt is SCARED SHITLESS --

                                  WALT
                    Stop!  Hey!  Stop!  Why re you --

    - but WALT catches a stray elbow from the scuffling men and 
      falls into the water.

                                  SUN
                    JIN STOP!

      Jin pushes Michael s face into the surf.  Michael thrashes - 
      DROWNING.

                                  WALT
                    STOP HIM!  PLEASE!

      Michael s strength wanes.  Jin pushes him deeper into the 
      water.  If no one does anything, he will kill this man.

      Off Sun - PARALYZED BY HER HUSBAND S HORRIBLE, UNEXPLAINABLE 
      ACT OF VIOLENCE...


                                    END OF TEASER










                                                                        www.pressexecute.com      LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"      (BLUE)      8/17/04     6.


                                        ACT ONE


      Chaos.  Violence.  Jin keeps Michael s head under the water.

                        WALTSUN
      Do something!  He s gonna (unsubtitled)
      kill him!Jin, please - let him go -

    - but nothing can stop Jin - until - SAYID AND SAWYER rush to 
      the beach - Sayid fly-tackles Jin.  Michael emerges, coughing  *
      salt-water and bleeding.  Walt runs to his father.

      Jin struggles savagely, but Sayid s training kicks in.  In  *
      one swift move he has Jin in a body lock - SHOUTS to Sawyer - *

                        SAYIDSAWYER
      The handcuffs!
                                                  -- What handcuffs?

                        SAYIDSAWYER
      From the Sky Marshal -I don t know what you re -

                                  SAYID
                    Give them -
                          (re: Jin)
                    - or I point him at you and let go.

      And it still takes Sawyer a beat to decide before he reaches 
      into his back pocket - pulling out the CUFFS as Sayid drags 
      Jin toward the landing gear wreckage just off the waterline.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    Over here - now!

      Sawyer LOCKS one cuff onto the wreckage.  Sayid secures the 
      second cuff around Jin s wrist and backs away - Jin is cuffed 
      to the landing gear.  All eyes turn to Sun:

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    What happened?

      Scared and intimidated, Sun takes a step back, alone, on the 
      hook, and unable to communicate -


      Jack leads Kate, Charlie and Locke through the jungle -

                    Luck?

                                  JACK
                    Luck.

      -- but Jack isn t talking about it.  Instead, he turns into a 
      narrow stone corridor leading to:


      Charlie trudges along until he is confident that he is alone.  
      He then lets out a sigh and produces his baggie.  Charlie 
      goes to work on the twist-tie when -

                                  VOICE
                    Don t move.

      Turning white, Charlie drops his arms, discreetly dropping 
      the baggie into a pocket, then turns his head to see Locke 
      behind him - the look on Locke s face is dire.

                                    CHARLIE

                                  LOCKE
                    He s standing on a beehive.

      Charlie looks down and sees it, buried into the soft earth 
      under his feet - A MASSIVE BEEHIVE.

                                    CHARLIE
                    What s a beehive doing there?

      But the hive is coming to life.  A trickle of bees emerges 
      from the ground... one of them lands on Charlie s torso.

                                    CHARLIE
                    I don t like bees - I have an

                    Will you please be quiet?

    A bee lands on Charlie s arm.  This is Chinese water torture.  
      Locke turns to Jack and Kate:

    A heated argument rages between Michael and Sayid.  HURLEY 
      and Sawyer watch.  Michael holds Walt close to his side and 
      holds a compress to his forehead with the other hand.

      Sun stands by her Jin, who, on occasion, yells out some angry 
      comment in Korean and is duly ignored.

                                  MICHAEL
                    I m getting sick of saying this, I 
                    was just combing the beach with my 
                    kid when that dude got up on me - I *
                    didn t do anything!

                                  SAYID
                    Surely there must be something you 
                    aren t telling us.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Surely?
                          (then)
                    Where are you from?

                        SAYIDMICHAEL
      Melbourne.
                                                    Originally.

      Sayid glares at Michael: this is not the first time he has 
      been asked this question by an American.

                                  SAYID

                          (off Michael s look)
                    Iraq.

                                    MICHAEL
                    OK, man, I don t know how it is in 
                    Iraq, but in the United States of 
                    America, where I come from, Korean *
                    people don t like black people.  
                    Did you know that?
                          (as Sayid shakes his head)
                    So maybe you ought to talk to him.

      Scared and confused, Walt looks at his dad - he s not sure 
      how to process this last comment.







                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"      (BLUE)      8/17/04     11.

      Sun steps up from her husband s side - says something in 
      Korean and points at her wrist.  Sayid turns to Sun:

                                  SAYID
                    No.  I am not taking off the cuffs -
                          (then, loudly)
                    The cuffs stay on.

                                  SAWYER
                    Little louder, Omar, maybe then *
                    she ll understand you.

      STAY on Sun - CLOSING IN ON HER as she steps back to Jin.  
      The arguing characters FALL OUT OF FOCUS, as Sun watches - 
      knowing they are arguing about her and her husband.

                                  HURLEY
                    Guys.  I got a point-of-order 
                      question... that Chinese dude s 
                    gonna get crispy out here, how long 
                    are we keeping him tied down like 
                    that?

                                    MICHAEL
                    He can fry for all I care.

                                  SAWYER
                          (off the looks)
                    Hey don t look at me, just  cause I 
                    got the metal don t mean I got the 
                    keys.

                                  SAYID
                    He tried to kill Michael.  We all 
                    saw it, right?
                          (no dissent)
                    He stays cuffed until we know why.

      And now we are TIGHT ON SUN as she turns toward Jin - she 
      doesn t have to understand to know this doesn t bode well. *

      And then Sun looks down - and focuses her sight on the *
      engagement ring on her hand...*


      E.C.U. on Sun s watch, then WIDER TO REVEAL the garden - 
      several months since the party from the teaser.  Several  *
      SERVANTS tend to the beautiful flora around Sun.





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"      (BLUE)      8/17/04     12.

      Sun waits on a bridge over a pond.  Nervous.  Waiting.  She 
      looks up to see a SERVANT - showing Jin out of the house.  He 
      wears a humble suit and a dire expression.

                                  SUN
                    Well?

      Jin pauses, steps up to the bridge, shaking his head - Sun s 
      heart is about to break - until he smiles:

                                  JIN
                    Your father has given his blessing.

      Sun lets out a joyful little scream - then embraces and 
      kisses Jin... right before she punches him on the shoulder -

                                  SUN
                    Don t ever do that again!
                          (kisses him, then)
                    How did you - ?

                                  JIN
                    I reasoned with him.
                          (as if it was nothing)
                    After a year of management training 
                    and another on the factory floor, 
                    we ll have the money to do 
                    everything we wanted.

      Sun REACTS.  Pulls away -- This was not part of the plan:

                                  SUN
                    You re going to work for my father?

                                  JIN
                    It was the honorable thing to do.*

                                  SUN
                    But -

                                  JIN
                    It was the only way to prove I m...
                          (off her look)
                    It s temporary.

      And with that, Jin pulls out a velvet-lined gift box - he 
      opens it before Sun to reveal a BEAUTIFUL ENGAGEMENT RING -

                                  SUN
                    Jin - you can t afford this -

                                  JIN
                    I can now.

      Sun tries to process the sea change taking place in her life 
      as Jin slips the ring on her finger...

      Reeling from pain, Charlie STOMPS down on the beehive - AND A 
      DENSE CLOUD OF BEES ERUPTS FROM THE EARTH.  The buzz becomes 
    a FEARSOME ROAR.  And this is REAL.  Not cheesy swarm crap -- 
      but actual STINGING BEES.  THOUSANDS OF THEM.

      Charlie panics, bats at the air SCREAMING, collecting sting 
      after sting as he backs himself into a rock - until - LOCKE 
      GRABS CHARLIE, takes off running, following after -

    - Kate and Jack - who run to the only place that seems safe -


      We re back at the BEACH - where SHANNON and BOONE walk past  *
      Sun and Jin, keeping their distance -*

                                  BOONE*
                    - all I know is they d better not *
                    let him loose - I heard he even *
                    tried to murder the kid.*
                          (then)*
                    Check out his wife - the guy s *
                    homicidal and she s standing by *
                    him.  Must be a Japanese thing.*

                                  SHANNON*
                    She s with him for the same reason *
                    I m hanging out with you.*
                          (off Boone s look)*
                     Cause I have to.*

    - as Boone and Shannon clear the frame, Sun breaks an ALOE  *
      LEAF in two and applies the pulp to his wrist:

                                  JIN
                    What are you doing?

                                  SUN
                    Your skin is very raw... maybe this 
                    will help you slip off the cuffs.

      Jin takes the aloe leaf and tosses it aside.  Quietly 
      rebounding from her husband s scorn, Sun looks at the OTHER 
      CASTAWAYS WANDERING AROUND THEM, all of them giving Sun and 
      Jin a wide berth.

      Sun turns back to her husband, despairing.  She and Jin are 
      alone on this island.

      ...where Sun turns to Jin, desperate to solve this situation:

                                  SUN
                    Jin - please - just let me go and 
                    explain this to them.  Maybe 
                    they ll let you go and -

      Jin turns a hard look at his wife:

                                  JIN
                    How will you explain?

                    Your place is by my side.
                          (then)
                    And we will not explain ourselves 
                    to a thief.

    A thief?  Michael?  What the hell is Jin talking about?  As 
      the mystery of Jin s actions deepens...

      Walt sits on the beach, staring at Jin from a safe but 
        confrontational distance.  Sitting in silence, Sun and Jin 
      stare off into the ocean, completely unaware.

      After a few seconds of being stared at without knowing it, 
      Jin feels Walt s look on him, and turns to look at him.

      It is a strange moment -- a grown man and a young boy  *
      exchanging glances laden with anger and bewilderment --

      -- broken as Michael steps up to Walt, holding Vincent on a  *
      leash.*

      SYMPATHETIC LOOK from Sun... but -*

                    Yeah.  Nice talking to you, too.*

      Sun s face falls.  Whatever good will there was between her  *
      and Michael has been destroyed by Jin.  Michael and Walt walk  *
      away -- and after a few beats, Walt breaks the silence... *

                                  WALT*
                    Why doesn t he like us?*

      Michael comes closer to his son, getting into full on  *
      parental mode --*

                    like him don t like people like us.*

      Michael looks up -- realizing that the words he spoke in  *
      anger earlier in the day have had an impact on his son -- *

                                  MICHAEL*
                    Aw - man.  No.  I don t think like *

                    So what d you do to him?*

      gap between himself and his son...*

    - where Sun jams a barrette in the cuffs, trying to pick the 
      lock.  Jin, whose wrist is now bleeding, talks her through:

                                  JIN
                    - be gentle - you re going to hit 
                    the catch eventually and then -

      Sun pokes at the lock a little too forcefully and bumps Jin s 
      wrist - he winces as his injured skin scrapes metal.  Trying  *
      to suck in the pain, Jin stares daggers up at his wife - *

                                  JIN (CONT D)
                    Now try it again.  This time try to 
                    do exactly as I say.

      Sun takes a deep breath, she knows that her husband is losing 
      his patience - and she knows that it s never pretty -


    - on Sun s face as she keeps working the lock, following her 
      husband s instructions until the barrette SNAPS.  Painfully 
      wrenching Jin s wrist.  Jin lets out a loud BELLOW.

      Sun backs off - preparing for the worst.  But Jin just takes 
    a deep breath... and MANY anxious beats pass before Jin  *
      speaks.  Calm.  Measured.  Controlled --*

                                  JIN
                    I want you to get me a knife.  The 
                    sharpest you can find.

                                  SUN
                    What for?

      Sun looks at Jin - a tear rolls from his eye as he speaks.

                                  JIN
                    We re all alone, Sun.  You re all I 
                    have left.  I m not going to let 
                    them take away our honor.
                          (then)
                    I m going to cut off my thumb.  I m 
                    getting out of these cuffs.
                          (beat)
                    And then I m going to go get back 
                    what s mine.

      As Sun looks into Jin s eyes, and sees his face hardening 
      into that same look from the flashback - her husband s heart 
      of darkness...

                                      ACT THREE


      Jack and Kate head back towards the beach... Kate stops for a 
      moment to take something out of her shoe.

      Jack goes a few steps before turning to see her... and then 
      just stands there, watching her perform the simple act of 
      tying her shoes, until -

                                  KATE
                    Are you checking me out?

      Jack quickly averts his gaze --

                                  JACK
                    What?

                                  KATE
                          (playful)
                    No shame in --

                                  JACK
                    Trust me, if I were checking you 
                    out, you d know it.

                                  KATE
                    Yeah?  What are you thinking - 
                    right now -

                        JACKKATE
      Well, I sure as hell wasn t -Don t stop to think - just 
                                                  tell me -

                                  JACK*
                    I was thinking that if we lived at 
                    the caves we could build a dam 
                    around the spring - so everyone 
                    would be able to get fresh water - 
                    and we could get the infirmary off 
                    the beach.

      Kate regards him quietly, her expression neutral - this is a 
      different Jack than she met on the beach seven days ago.  A 
      cloud has lifted from him as the discovery of The Valley has 
      touched an optimistic place in his being...

      ...but as much as she can appreciate that, part of Kate - a 
      big part - wishes he had been checking her out.  Jack turns 
      to Kate, sees she s not quite sharing his excitement --

                                  KATE
                    No - it makes sense.

                        JACKKATE
      But?
                                                  -- No but.

                                  JACK
                    Good because a lot of people are 
                    still hoping a rescue boat s gonna 
                    show up - they aren t thinking 
                    about their own safety -
                          (then)
                    - we re gonna have a lot of 
                      convincing to do.

                                  KATE
                    We?  You haven t convinced me yet.

      Jack smiles - confident he can bring her around.  And as she 
      SMILES back, chemistry apparent despite what might be a 
      slowly forming GULF --*

      -- Jack and Kate turn to see Sayid, walking toward them,  *
      carrying several logs, as well as crash axe from the plane. *

                                  SAYID*
                    - I m dying of thirst.*


      His logs and axe on a pile on the ground, Sayid opens a  *
      bottle and drinks as he briefs Jack and Kate --*

                                  SAYID
                    I am going to let the Korean man *
                    sit in the sun a while longer - *
                    once I have enough wood for our *
                    signal fire, I ll take his wife *
                    aside - find some way to *
                      communicate.  I think she knows why 
                    he attacked Michael.

                                  JACK
                    You sure you don t want me to talk *
                    to her?

      Sayid shoots Jack a look.  Jack decides not to push it:

                    I m going to start talking to 
                    people about the caves.  I might be 
                    able to get a few to go with me by 
                    nightfall - start setting up a 
                    camp.

                                  SAYID
                    You re serious?
                          (off the looks)
                    Is there a reason you didn t 
                    consult us when you decided to form 
                    your own civilization?

                                  JACK
                    I m talking about moving a couple 
                    of miles inland -

                                  SAYID
                    Whatever happened to  live 
                    together, die alone? 

                                  JACK
                    Digging in - together - is the only 
                    way we can survive...

                                  SAYID
                    Our best hope of survival is being 
                    spotted by a plane or a ship - and 
                    for that we need to organize 
                    everyone - to keep that signal fire 
                    burning while others scout the 
                    island for supplies -  digging in  
                    anywhere else is suicide.

                                  KATE
                    It s the only source of fresh water 
                    we ve found, Sayid.

                                  SAYID
                    Don t tell me you re part of this 
                    insanity.

                                  JACK
                    And staying here - without water, 
                    in the sun - that s not suicide?

      And of course, Jack s logic can t be argued.  But Sayid 
      doesn t really care -- instead he picks up his firewood and  *
      delivers a parting shot --*

                                  SAYID
                    I have better things to do with my 
                    life than to admit defeat.

      MICHAEL sits watching his son play with Vincent, then looks

                    Now what?  I already gave you my

      Sayid takes the hit in stride, then --

                                  SAYID
                    I came to apologize.  I shouldn t 
                    have been suspicious - you were the 
                    victim in the attack this morning.

      Michael sizes Sayid up - then:

                                    MICHAEL
                    I appreciate that - but I can tell *
                    you didn t come all the way here *
                    just to say you re sorry.*

                    People are seriously considering 
                    following Jack to the caves.

      Michael looks out to see Jack, ACROSS THE BEACH - talking to 
    a few castaways - making converts.

                                  SAYID (CONT D)
                    I d like to know where you stand.

                          (off Sayid s look)
                    I got one priority right now, and 
                    that s getting my kid off this

                    from the plane, for a signal fire.

                                  SAYID
                    We burned most of our wood when we 
                    torched the fuselage.  Whatever you 
                    can carry.

      Michael nods.  Sayid turns to go, but not before patting 
      Michael on the shoulder - a gesture of unspoken agreement 
      between these two men.  As Sayid walks away -

      FIND Sun - watching Michael.  Sun takes a beat - gathering  *
      herself together - figuring out her next move -

    - then follows Michael, making sure he doesn t see her.

      As Sun clears the frame - FIND Jack, walking away from the 
      castaways he was converting and toward -


    - where HURLEY packs his things.

                                  JACK
                    Glad you re coming.

                    C mon -- you guys gonna move into a 
                    cave together?  She d look just 
                    like Wilma if she put a bone in her 
                    hair and dude?  Wilma s hot.

                                  JACK
                    I m sorry.  Am I in High School?

                                  HURLEY
                          (cracking up)
                    I knew it.  You are like, so over 
                    that whole  she s on the run from 
                    Johnny Law  thing aren t you?

                                  JACK
                          (shakes his head; gets up)
                    Just get your stuff together - we 
                    need to go soon.

                                  HURLEY
                    That wasn t a denial!

    - and as Jack walks away - FIND Sawyer - walking the shore in *
      the opposite direction until he reaches -


    - Kate.  Sitting.  Looking at the sea, letting the water hit 
      her toes, a near-perfect moment wrecked by Sawyer s arrival.

                                  SAWYER
                    Well well well, if it ain t the 
                    Belle of the Ball.
                          (off Kate)
                    So what s it like having both the 
                    doctor and Cap n Falafel fighting 
                    over you?

      Although Kate shoots Sawyer a  go to hell  glare, it is clear 
      from their interaction that they too have a spark - different 
      from the emotional bond she shares with Jack, but it s there:

                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Just calling  em like I see  em, 
                    freckles.

      (CONT'D):3636
                                  SAWYER (CONT D)
                    Truth be told, I m not the only 
                    person wondering where you re going 
                    to weigh in on this whole  moving 
                    off the beach  thing.

                                  KATE
                    Please.

                                  SAWYER
                    Hey -- Jacko may be saving lives, 
                    but everyone here knows you went to 
                    get the transceiver, and hunt boar, 
                    and send the distress signal... 
                    even if they don t know how that 
                    worked out.

      Kate looks at Sawyer - and the plainness of her question 
      makes it clear that she DOES care what he says and does:

                                  KATE
                    Are you going?

                                  SAWYER
                    That s the real trick, isn t it?  
                    We all pack up stakes to the caves, 
                    and the next day a plane passes by - 
                    they re gonna go on their merry way 
                    and be none the wiser... On the 
                    other hand, you stay here and get 
                    eaten by boars or fall off a rock - 
                    there isn t gonna be anyone around 
                    to answer the 911 call, am I right?

                                  KATE
                    You didn t answer my question.

                                  SAWYER
                    You didn t answer mine.  And I 
                    asked first.
                          (getting up)
                    Sayonara, sugarpop.

      And OFF Kate as she watches him go...


      As Sun walks through the bamboo trees with a purpose -  *
      REVERSE P.O.V. to show Michael, chopping up kindling with the *
      crash axe.*

      Sun keeps walking toward Michael - the resolve on her face  *
      growing - there is something she needs to do, and it involves  *
      him, but before we get to that -*



                                                                        www.pressexecute.com  LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"      (PINK)      8/19/04     41A.




      -- the look on Sun s face is a match for the end of the  *

      just as she closes the distance --*

                                        ACT FOUR


      Michael s state of shock remains unabated:

                                    MICHAEL
                    You speak English.

                                  SUN
                    Yes.

                      MICHAELSUN
      You speak English?Yes.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Why didn t you saying anything?

      Sun shoots Michael the kind of exasperated look she has been 
      waiting for years to give her husband:

                                  SUN
                    My husband doesn t know.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Why would you learn English without *
                    telling your husband?*

                                  SUN*
                    He has a temper -*

                                  MICHAEL*
                    - yeah but -*
                          (and it finally hits him)*
                    - were you going to leave him?  Is *
                    that why you didn t -*

      Sun looks at Michael, this is not an open topic.

                                  SUN
                    What my husband did to you today - 
                    it was a misunderstanding.

                                    MICHAEL
                    No - I got it loud and clear.

                                  SUN
                    It was the watch.

      Sun points at Michael s wrist - he s wearing a shiny, 
      expensive new watch.  Michael stares at Sun, flummoxed.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"      (BLUE)      8/17/04     44.
      (CONT'D):3838


                                  MICHAEL
                    Your husband tried to murder me 
                    over a watch?  I found this two 
                    days ago...

                                  SUN
                    And he has been looking for it for 
                    five.  It belongs to my father.  He 
                    entrusted it to my husband.

      Michael shakes his head - none of this makes any sense:

                                  SUN (CONT D)
                    My father is a very powerful man.  
                    The watch was a gift for one of his 
                    American business associates.  It 
                    was my husband s job to deliver it 
                    in my father s name.
                          (beat)
                    My husband has spent years working 
                    for my father - earning his trust, 
                    his respect.  Protecting that watch 
                    is a question of honor.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Honor?  Trying to kill me in front 
                    of my kid - that s honor?

                                  SUN
                    You don t know my father.

      Sun looks at Michael - there is only one thing about this 
      situation she truly expects him to understand:

                                  SUN (CONT D)
                    My husband has to be stopped.  I 
                    need your help.

      Off Michael - wondering what the hell she means by that and 
      what she expects him to do about it.


      We find CHARLIE alone... nervously checking over his shoulder 
      while he attempts to find a moment of privacy as he shuffles 
      toward one of the EXIT CAVES...

      And he s gonna make it out, successfully ditching Locke -- 
      wherever the hell he is -- as he reaches into his pocket and  *
      pulls out his BAGGIE --




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com  LOST   "House of the Rising Sun"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)  8/16/04  45.
      (CONT'D):3939


      There s LOCKE.  Blocking his path.  Charlie stops, closes his 
      fist around the baggie, and lets Locke have it:

                                    CHARLIE
                    Listen to me you old git.  I m 
                    going into the jungle.  A man 
                    has... has a right to privacy.  So 
                    leave me ALONE.

      Locke looks up and down at Charlie, quietly taking stock.  
      Charlie holds Locke s line of sight, until -

                                  LOCKE
                    Just hand them to me.

    - and that s when Charlie s stare breaks.

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    You re going to run out.  My guess 
                    is sooner rather than later.
                          (off Charlie s look)
                    Painful detox is inevitable... give 
                    them up now, and at least it will 
                    be your choice.

                                    CHARLIE
                    Don t talk to me like - like you 
                    know something about me.

                                  LOCKE
                    I know a lot more about pain than 
                    you think.  I don t envy what 
                    you re facing - but I want to help.

      Charlie is torn.  Someone is finally on to his secret - and, 
      instead of judging, wants to help him escape.

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    Do you want your guitar?*

      Locke s stare pierces Charlie s soul.  There is something 
      about this man: this humorless, mystical - and sometimes 
      scary - guy that nevertheless inspires a strange confidence.

      Charlie nods.  Yes.

                                  LOCKE (CONT D)
                    More than your drugs?

                                  CHARLIE
                    More than you could know.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com  LOST   "House of the Rising Sun"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)  8/16/04  46.
      (CONT'D): (2)3939


                                  LOCKE
                    What I know is this island might 
                    just give you what you re looking 
                    for... but you have to give the 
                    island something in return.

      Locke holds out his hand.  Finally realizing this may be the 
      only way he will get out of his addiction with some dignity, 
      Charlie hands the drugs over to Locke.

      The moment hangs between the two.  Charlie then looks up at 
      Locke, his great expectations clear as he asks:

                                    CHARLIE
                    Can you really find my guitar? *

      Locke holds up his index finger.  Charlie stares at Locke -

                                  LOCKE
                    Look up, Charlie.

                                  CHARLIE*
                    Don t tell me you want me to pray 
                    or something -

                                  LOCKE
                    - I want you to look up.

      And as Charlie does what he is told... TILT UP - to REVEAL A 
      GUITAR CASE, hanging from a tree some fifty feet above. *

      Utterly fuckstruck, Charlie looks down at Locke - then back 
      up at his guitar - so near, yet so far away... and breaks *
      into tears.

                                  CHARLIE
                    I never thought -

      Locke puts his hand on Charlie s shoulder, consoling him:

                                  LOCKE
                    I know.  I know.*
                          (then)
                    Come on, Charlie.  I ll help you 
                    get it down.

      Charlie looks up at Locke - tears streaming - and for the 
      first time since the beginning of this journey, Locke smiles.

    A small group of people - including Jack and Hurley - prepare  *
      to go to the valley.  Jack breaks off and makes his way to - *

    - Kate, who sits, unmoved.  Jack makes eye contact - the look  *
      on Kate s face, and the growing weariness in Jack s step 
      makes what they both know absolutely clear:

                                  JACK
                    Hey.  Almost time to go.*

      Kate hates this - disappointing Jack is the last thing she 
      wants to do, but she has no choice -

                                  KATE
                    I don t want to be Eve.

                    No one s asking you to.

    - and there is a part of Kate that wishes, more than anything 
      else in the world, that he were asking.  But that s not the 
      part of her that s calling the shots:

                                  KATE
                    I just can t dig in.

      Jack wants to go, is exasperated -- but he s a guy who needs 
      to UNDERSTAND things... understand HER --

                                  JACK
                    Why not?  Someone else can stay 
                    here -- keep a lookout -- wait for 
                    rescue.  Why does it have to be 
                    you?

                                  KATE
                    It s not that.

                                  JACK
                    Then what is it?

      Kate just shakes her head - why can t he just understand?  
      Jack watches her, realizing that a logical argument isn t 
      going to win the day...

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    How did you get to be this way?
                          (beat)
                    Just what did you do, Kate?

      Kate levels a cold stare at Jack - now that he s gone there, 
      her decision to stay feels justified:

                                  KATE
                    You had your chance to know - you 
                    don t get to ask again.

      Jack processes her words and body language - this 
        conversation is over:

                                  JACK
                    If you need me, you know where to 
                    find me.

      Kate turns as Jack exits, then, under her breath:

                                  KATE
                    You know where to find me too.

      And in this quiet moment, A FLASH OF VULNERABILITY as we 
      realize Kate isn t cold -- she s just protecting herself.

      Off this quiet, thoughtful MOMENT --


      We re EXTREMELY TIGHT on the crash axe.  PULL BACK to find it  *
      tightly in the grip of --

      MICHAEL.




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com    LOST    "House of the Rising Sun"    (YELLOW)      8/20/04     49.

      He s got blood in his eyes and he s heading straight for JIN.

      Jin sees Michael approaching - brandishing a lethal weapon - 
      and pushes himself back against the wreckage - for the first 
      time, REAL FEAR creeps into Jin s stoic countenance.

      Michael gets closer and closer - he could split Jin s skull 
      like a melon -

                                  MICHAEL
                    I know you can t understand a word - 
                    and normally I m not the talking-
                    out-loud type - but since I have a 
                    captive audience - I hope for your 
                    sake that you LISTEN.

      Michael s fingers tighten around the axe handle.  Jin holds 
      his palms out - he may not speak English, but he gets it that 
      he could be facing the business end of that weapon.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    I m not exactly having the best 
                    month of my life.  A woman I had a 
                      relationship with ten years ago 
                    died halfway around the world - I 
                    barely know my son... and now I 
                    gotta be his daddy.  Then there was 
                    the little accident that put us in 
                    this hell hole - and to top it off, 
                    I have a deranged Korean guy trying 
                    to kill me - and for what?

      Michael reaches for his wrist and undoes the watch - turning 
      it around to show Jin the back plate - engraved in Hangul.

      Michael holds the watch to Jin s face - then points at the 
      watch and at Jin repeatedly, making it look like he saw the 
      characters and figured all this out on his own.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    I get it: you have an insane code-
                    of-honor thing with your father-in-
                    law, and delivering this watch to 
                    one of his cronies was the one 
                    thing you were living for - that 
                    just makes you stupid - but to try 
                    and kill a man?  I d have given it 
                    back if you d asked.
                          (beat)
                    My watch broke.  *

                                  MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    which is ridiculous since time 
                    doesn t matter on a damn island.  
                    So - you want your watch back - I m 
                    giving it to you.  Not because you 
                    tried to kill me, but because I am 
                    not a thief.

      Michael tosses the watch.  Jin catches it... but Michael is  *
      bringing the AXE up in the air!  Jin cowers.  Closes his  *
      eyes.  This is it.  And the AXE WHISTLES DOWNWARDS AND

      KLANG!

      Severs the chain.  Jin opens his eyes - surprised to be 
      alive.  Michael levels an unyielding stare at the man:

                                  MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Stay away from me and my kid.

      And we hear a TICKING SOUND as Michael walks away, dragging  *
      the axe on the sand.  As Jin watches him go, duly humbled - *

      REVEAL - SUN, watching from a distance as a stunned, confused  *
      Jin tries to scrape himself and his dignity off the fuselage.

      And Sun s voice - now in English - ECHOES over the scene - *

                                  SUN S VOICE (PRE-LAP)
                    Eleven fifteen - eleven fifteen - 
                    eleven fifteen...*


      As Jin walks away - C.U. on Jin s hand.  As Sun s hand enters 
      frame, slipping into his palm.

      Jin turns to his wife, and closes his hand around hers.  As 
      this damaged, but maybe, someday, redemptive couple makes 
      their way off the shore...

                                                                    CUT TO BLACK:

                                        ACT FIVE


      The group following Jack to The Valley is ready to go as Jack 
      straps on his pack.

                                  JACK
                    OK, people, let s get moving, we 
                    gotta be there before sundown.

      FIND - Sun and Jin, hurriedly packing their things.  Jin 
      speaks as if nothing happened today -

                                  JIN
                    The doctor has a point - leaving 
                    the beach is the right thing to do - 
                    and we d better stay close to him, 
                    in case one of us gets sick -

    - but something did happen today - and although Sun nods 
      quietly, she notices he is packing the watch.

                                  JIN (CONT D)
                    - and I can always come back and 
                    fish in daytime - this place can t 
                    be so far away that -

      In an act of simple, quiet defiance, Sun stands, picks up her 
      bag and walks away- Jin is stunned:

                                  JIN (CONT D)
                    I m still talking - Sun!  What are 
                    you doing?  I m not finished -

      Sun turns, looks at her husband -

                                  SUN
                    Don t you want to move on?

      Sun then turns her back on him and keeps walking.  Jin 
      considers his wife s simple, yet infinitely loaded words as 
      she walks toward Jack s now-departing group -

    - and then finally stands.  As Jin trails after his wife, he 
      turns to see Michael and Walt - handing logs to Sayid as he  *
      organizes them on top of the metal sheets of his makeshift 
      signal fire.

      Jin and Michael exchange looks -





                                                                        www.pressexecute.com  LOST   "House of the Rising Sun"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)  8/16/04  54.

    - and Jin stops in front of Michael.  Walt gets a look at Jin 
      and gets very close to his father, who puts a protecting arm 
      around his son.

                                  JIN
                          (without subtitles)
                    My apologies.

      Michael casts a dubious look at Jin, but Jin s tone and the 
      proud, yet contrite look on his face make his intent clear.

      SUN - stops and watches her husband as Michael replies:

                                  MICHAEL
                    I don t speak Korean.
                          (off Jin)
                    But the word you re looking for is 
                     Sorry. 
                          (then)
                     Sorry. 

      Jin regards Michael, then:

                                  JIN
                    Sorry.

      Michael nodes, then indicates Walt:

                                    MICHAEL
                    Now my kid.

      Jin looks down at Walt - he doesn t like this, but it is a 
      question of honor -

                                  JIN
                    Sorry.

      Michael nods, then extends a handshake at Jin.  Jin accepts  *
      the gesture - and as he does, the remaining cuff slips down 
      over Jin s wrist.  He will wear it for the run of the series - 
    a reminder of almost killing a man over nothing.

      The pleasantries done, Jin turns to see his wife - joining 
      the now-departing Valley party.

                                  JIN (CONT D)
                          (without subtitles)
                    Sun!  Wait!

      As Jin rushes after Sun...




                                                                        www.pressexecute.com  LOST   "House of the Rising Sun"   (PRODUCTION DRAFT)  8/16/04  55.

      CHARLIE S HAND - trembling as he struggles to pluck out a few 
      notes at -


    - where Michael, Boone & Shannon, Sawyer, Sayid, Kate and a 
      couple of EXTRAS watch the signal fire.  The flames rise into 
      the night.  The mood is somber - a group of people gathered  *
      in the hope of rescue as opposed to the promise of survival. *

      Walt looks up at his father - Michael returns his glance.

                                  WALT
                    Can I ask you something?

                                    MICHAEL
                    Anything you want, man.

                                  WALT
                    When s your birthday?

      Michael smiles, kneels next to his son, putting an arm around 
      him.  As the two talk - a bridge forming between them... *


      ...where Kate stands next to Sayid... thinking of Jack.

      Off the sadness of two kindred souls unable to connect... *
