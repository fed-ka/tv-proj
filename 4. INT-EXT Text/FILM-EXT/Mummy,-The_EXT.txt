Imhotep leads-a TORCH-LIT procession across the dunes. Anck-
su-namun's mummy is carried by NUBIAN SLAVES. They put her
down in the sand along with FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS.
IMHOTEP
Her body was mummified, her vital
organs removed and placed in sacred
canopic jars.
Imhotep, filled with dread, reads from a OBOOKO made out of
pure GOLD. THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING.
IMHOTEP
The Book of The Living contained
sacred incantations that would send
the evil dead on a journey into the
dark underworld.
Strange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across the faces of the slaves
and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS. Suddenly, everyone's fear-filled
eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising.
Then one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND,
and it's over. Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the
ground.
Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus.
The Nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand.
Imhotep then signals to the Soldiers, who throw their spears
at the Nubians. Killing them.
IMHOTEP
The slaves were killed...
Imhotep's knife-wielding Priests attack the now unarmed
Soldiers, hacking at them in the flickering darkness as
Imhotep and the Mumia solemnly watches.
IMHOTEP
...and the soldiers who killed them
were also slain, so that no unholy
person should ever know the exact
location of the burial site.
The Mumia walk off across the sand and then, one by one, the
Priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the
vanishing Mumia. As the last Mumia disappears over a distant
dune, Imhotep nods, and the Priests leap onto Anck-su-namun's
grave and begin digging it back up with their hands.
CHARIOTS race out into the moonlit desert. Imhotep leads the
way. A "hearse" carries Anck-su-namun's mummy. THE MAP OF
ANCIENT EGYPT FADES UP. The chariots race across the map.
IMHOTEP
But there was another book, The Book
Of The Dead, which was never to be
opened, never to be read, for it
contained the incantations that could
bring a dead body back to life a
most unholy thing.
The chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic.
They race up the stone ramp and in through the city gates.
SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS:
HAMUNAPTRA - City of the Dead
IMHOTEP
It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of
the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis,
so that no such sacrilege might ever
disgrace Egypt.
Imhotep pulls an ORNATE CHEST out of a SECRET COMPARTMENT
inside the giant STATUE OF ANUBIS. He opens the chest and
lifts out THE BOOK OF THE DEAD, made of black stone.
IMHOTEP
But for my love of Anck-su-namun I
was willing to defy the gods.
Imhotep's horrifying SCREAMS become the SCREAMS of a TUAREG
HORSEMAN.
Racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior
brethren. Armed to the teeth. SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN
are the WORDS:
THE SAHARA - 1925
A mile across the scorching desert TWO HUNDRED FRENCH FOREIGN
LEGIONNAIRES scurry through the ruins, preparing for the
onslaught. OUR HERO is up on the wall. His Kepi sits at a
jaunty angle. Dashing and handsome. This is RICK O'CONNELL.
He looks out at the massive SCREAMING horde galloping at
him.
O'CONNELL
I knew this was gonna be a lousy
day.
A doughy little Frenchman joins him as he makes his way across
the top of the wall. This is BENI.
BENI
Personally, I would like to surrender.
Why can we not just surrender?
O'CONNELL
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.
Beni pulls off his cartridge belt. Hands it to O'Connell.
BENI
Then let's run away. Right now. While
we can still make it.
O'Connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier.
O'CONNELL
Now gimme your revolver, you'll never
use it anyway.
Beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to O'Connell.
BENI
Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody
ever does that anymore.
O'Connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver
O'CONNELL
Now go find me a big stick.
BENI
In the desert? What for?
O'Connell turns and goes nose-to-nose with him.
O'CONNELL
So I can tie it to your back, you
appear to be without a spine.
The horde of warriors THUNDERS forward. Now a half mile out.
Scimitars RATTLING. O'Connell and Beni run through the ruins.
O'CONNELL
How'd a guy like you end up in the
Legion anyways?
BENI
I got caught robbing a synagogue.
Lots of good stuff in them holy
places; churches, temples, mosques,
and who's guarding them?
O'CONNELL
Altar boys?
BENI
Exactly! I speak seven languages,
including Hebrew, so my specialty
was synagogues. How about you? Kill
somebody?
Beni trips and accidentally tackles O'Connell to the ground.
O'Connell gives him a nasty look.
O'CONNELL
No, but I'm considering it.
They get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp
BENI
What then? Robbery? Extortion?
Kidnapping!
O'CONNELL
None of the above, thank you.
BENI
Then what the hell are you doing
here!?
They both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the
horde of warriors. The SOUND of CHARGING HORSES is deafening.
O'Connell gives Beni a big cheesy smile.
O'CONNELL
I was just looking for a good time.
And that's when the cowardly Legionnaire Colonel suddenly
panics, cuts and runs. O'Connell instantly stiffens.
O'CONNELL
Oh shit. Steady!
Gives the men around him courage. But onward comes the horde
Hoofs pounding the sand. Several more Legionnaires take off.
O'CONNELL
STEADY!
(to himself)
What the hell am I sayin'?
The Tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo-loo-loog
SCREAMS. More Legionnaires haul-ass. Beni is one of them.
O'CONNELL
STEADY!!
(to himself)
What the hell am I doin'?
The Tuaregs set their rifles and take aim. O'Connell steels
himself, cocks and locks. The cartridge in his mouth suddenly
snaps, he spits it into the sand. Another BEAT. And then --
O'CONNELL
FIRE!
The Legionnaires on the ground FIRE. The rifles report with
a CRASH. The BLAST blows dozens of Tuaregs clean off their
mounts. The prone Legionnaires quickly begin to reload.
O'CONNELL
FIRE!
The kneeling Legionnaires FIRE. More Tuaregs bite the sand.
The remaining warriors OPEN FIRE. THUNDER and SMOKE rip the
hot air. A third of the Legionnaires are killed instantly.
O'CONNELL
FIRE!
The remaining standing Legionnaires FIRE. Tuaregs spin off
their mounts. Crash to the sand. And then the entire Tuareg
force plows into the ruins and through the Legionnaires.
O'Connell grabs the barrel of his rifle and starts CLUBBING
riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed.
Beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand,
whimpering in full retreat as Legionnaires fall dead all
around him. He crawls through the front gate.
O'Connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns. He
cross-draws, gun in each hand, starts blowing riders off
their mounts.
Beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open TEMPLE DOORWAY
amongst the rocks. He gets up and sprints for the door as
the last of the Legionnaires are shot off their feet behind
him. O'Connell's guns go empty.
O'CONNELL
Son-of-a-bitch.
He turns and runs like hell, right through the front gate.
Four Tuareg warriors on massive Arabians haul-ass after him.
O'Connell hurdles a stone column, hits the ground running.
He spots Beni inside the Temple doorway, trying to close the
heavy sandstone door.
O'CONNELL
Hey! Beni! Wait up!
Beni has no intention of waiting up, he pushes harder.
O'CONNELL
What are ya doing?! Wait up!
O'Connell runs faster. Beni pushes harder. The four Horsemen
LEAP the big column and CHARGE after him. HOOFS POUNDING.
O'CONNELL
Don't you close that door! DON'T YOU
CLOSE THAT DOOR!
Beni closes the door just as O'Connell reaches it. O'Connell
SLAMS his body into the door. It doesn't budge.
O'CONNELL
I'm gonna get you for this!
He turns and bolts off around the rocks. Running for his
life, weaving through the ruins. The Arabians getting closer
and closer. The POUNDING hoofs getting LOUDER and LOUDER.
O'Connell finally spins around and faces his attackers. The
four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him. The
vicious Tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off.
O'Connell just stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he
slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird.
And that's when the horses go ape-shit. All four of them
REAR UP. Two of the Riders are THROWN to the ground. The
horses SCREECH and BELLOW and SNORT in fear, then buck like
fury and haul-ass away as if the devil himself had scared
them. The thrown Riders get up and race off after their
mounts.
O'Connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right
hand and checks out his middle finger. And then he feels the
evil himself, and turns around. -- The shattered, decrepit
statue of Anubis stares back at him.
Suddenly, the sand begins to shift under O'Connell's feet.
He starts to back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming
sand, it looks like huge snakes are wiggling and writhing
beneath it, forming lines and shapes, -- drawing a picture.
O'Connell quickly turns and runs off through the ruins. The
sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the
sand, is a picture of IMHOTEP'S SCREAMING FACE.
Up on a ridge, A GROUP OF RIDERS watch O'Connell stumble
clear of the decrepit city. O'Connell feels their presence
and looks up. Very different from the Tuaregs, they have
BLUE TINTED SKIN and faces covered in strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS.
The Mumia. Still watching Imhotep's grave after all this
time.
The MUMIA LEADER is a huge, fierce Man in black robes, with
dual scimitars across his waist. His face is both handsome
and horrible, blue and tattooed. Meet ARDETH RAY. His dark
eyes watch O'Connell stagger off into the open desert...
Cairo, a city so old the stars have actually changed their
positions in the sky since it's birth. A city teeming with
every form of life. A strange, mysterious, wonderful city.
WE SUPERIMPOSE it's name across the SCREEN:
CAIRO
Cairo prison. One of the worst hell holes on earth. Every
low-life form of scumbag can be found here. The WARDEN, a
first rate scumbag himself, escorts Evelyn and Jonathan across
the gallows courtyard. Evelyn whispers to Jonathan.
EVELYN
You told me you found it on a dig
down in Thebes!
JONATHAN
I was mistaken.
EVELYN
You lied to me!
JONATHAN
I lie to everybody, what makes you
so special?
EVELYN
I'm your sister.
JONATHAN
That just makes you more gullible.
EVELYN
You stole it from a drunk at the
local Casbah?!
JONATHAN
Picked his pocket, actually.
The Warden ushers Evelyn and Jonathan into the holding pen.
EVELYN
And what is he in prison for?
WARDEN
I did not know, so when I heard you
were coming, I asked him that myself.
EVELYN
And what did he say?
WARDEN
He said... he was just looking for a
good time.
The interior cell door BURSTS OPEN. O'Connell is in chains,
dragged by FOUR GUARDS, they shove him up to the cell bars.
From the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is
half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new
bruises. Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance.
EVELYN
But he's just a filthy criminal?
JONATHAN
(cringing)
Way to go, Evy.
O'Connell gives Evelyn the once over, then looks at Jonathan.
O'CONNELL
So who's the broad?
EVELYN
Broad?!
JONATHAN
She's my sister, actually.
O'CONNELL
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a
total loss.
Evelyn is stunned and furious. The Warden heads out the door.
WARDEN
I'll be back in a moment.
O'CONNELL
(sarcastic)
I tremble with anticipation.
A Guard CLUBS O'Connell across the head, O'Connell's face
bounces off the metal bars. He shows no pain, but just looks
back and gives the Guard a nasty look. Evelyn steps closer.
EVELYN
We uh,... found... your puzzle box,
and we've come to ask you about it.
O'CONNELL
No.
EVELYN
No?
O'CONNELL
No... You came to ask me about
Hamunaptra.
Evelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards
didn't hear him. They step closer. Evelyn plays coy.
EVELYN
How do you know the box pertains to
Hamunaptra?
O'CONNELL
Because that's where I found it. I
was there.
Evelyn is dumbstruck. But Jonathan looks suspicious
JONATHAN
How do we know that's not a load of
pig swallow?
O'Connell looks closer at Jonathan, a glint of recognition.
O'CONNELL
Hey,... don't I know you?
JONATHAN
Um, well, you see...
O'Connell's FIST comes flying through the bars, hits Jonathan
square in the jaw, DECKS HIM. He hits the floor. Out cold. A
Guard CLUBS O'Connell. His head bounces off the bars again.
He shows no pain, but gives the Guard another nasty look.
Evelyn looks down at her brother, then back at O'Connell.
EVELYN
You were actually at Hamunaptra?
O'CONNELL
I just decked your brother
EVELYN
Yes, well...
(shrugs)
I know my brother.
O'Connell almost smiles. There's a bit of spark to this girl.
O'CONNELL
Yeah, I was there.
EVELYN
You swear?
O'CONNELL
Every damn day.
EVELYN
No, I mean --
O'CONNELL
-- I know what you mean. I was there,
alright. Seti's place. The City Of
The Dead.
EVELYN
What did you find? What did you see?
O'CONNELL
I found sand. I saw death.
The warden enters. Evelyn quickly leans closer to O'Connell.
EVELYN
Could you tell me how to get there?
The exact location?
O'CONNELL
Want to know?
Evelyn leans in even closer.
EVELYN
Yes.
O'CONNELL
Really want to know?
She leans her face right up to the bars, nervous and excited
EVELYN
Yes.
O'Connell steps forward and KISSES her full on the lips.
O'CONNELL
Then get me the hell outta here.
Evelyn is stunned. A Guard CLUBS him, his face bounces off
the bars again, but before he can react the Guards GRAB him,
YANKS him away from the bars and DRAG him out of the room.
EVELYN
Where are they taking him?
WARDEN
To be hanged.
Evelyn is shocked. The warden shows-off his green teeth.
WARDEN
Apparently, he had a very good time.
Hundreds of filthy PRISONERS stare down onto the gallows as
the hangman's noose is draped over O'Connell's head and
cinched tight around his neck. Evelyn follows the warden
onto a balcony above the gallows. The prisoners all go dead
quiet at the sight of her; like jackals staring at fresh
meat.
WARDEN
No women allowed.
EVELYN
I am an English woman.
This seems to confuse the Warden, he shrugs and sits down.
O'Connell looks up as Evelyn plops down beside the Warden.
EVELYN
I will give you one hundred pounds
to spare his life.
WARDEN
I would pay one hundred pounds just
to see him hang.
EVELYN
Two hundred pounds.
WARDEN
Proceed!
EVELYN
Three hundred pounds!
O'Connell can hear every word, he looks hopeful. Other than
Evelyn, you could hear a pin drop. The HANGMAN turns to him.
HANGMAN
Any last requests, pig?
O'CONNELL
Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go.
The Hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor.
EVELYN
FIVE HUNDRED POUNDS!
The Warden sets his greasy, lecherous hand on Evelyn's leg.
WARDEN
And what else?
Evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away.
Insulted, the Warden angrily turns and gestures to the
Hangman, who pulls the lever. The trapdoor DROPS AWAY.
EVELYN
NOOO!
O'Connell DROPS through the hole. The rope pays out. Then
JERKS TAUGHT. O'Connell's body SNAPS at the end of the rope.
But he's still alive, because --
WARDEN
His neck did not break! Good! Now we
watch him strangle to death.
The prisoners go ape-shit, SCREAMING and SHOUTING in anger.
The GUARDS look around, nervous. O'Connell struggles at the
end of the rope, gagging. Evelyn is horrified, she quickly
turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear.
EVELYN
He knows the location to Hamunaptra.
The warden spins around and faces her.
WARDEN
You lie.
EVELYN
I would never!
At the end of the rope, O'Connell is choking and gagging and
turning several shades of red. The Warden stares at Evelyn.
WARDEN
Are you saying this filthy godless
son of a pig knows where to find The
City Of The Dead? Truly?
EVELYN
Yes and if you cut him down, we will
give you ten percent.
WARDEN
Fifty percent.
EVELYN
Twenty.
WARDEN
Forty.
Evelyn hesitates, bites her lip. O'Connell's eyes bulge as
he looks up at her, he can't believe this girl.
O'CONNELL
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA--
!
EVELYN
Twenty-five percent, and not one
single farthing more.
The warden flashes a big green smile, then YELLS in Arabic.
A scimitar SLASHES the air. The rope is CUT. O'Connell CRASHES
to the ground. Half dead. Rolls over. GAGGING.
All of the prisoners BURST INTO CHEERS. O'Connell looks up
at Evelyn. She smiles broadly and waves down at him.
CURATOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT
CANDLE LIGHT FLICKERS across the Curator's face.
CURATOR
She must die.
Standing in the shadows across from his desk are THREE MUMIA:
blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, -- the works. One
of the Mumia has a rusty metal HOOK for a hand. He shrugs.
HOOK
She is like all the others. She will
die in the desert.
CURATOR
No! She has seen too much. She knows
too much.
The Curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes.
CURATOR
Not only does she have a map, but
she has the key.
Spooks the hell out of the Mumia guys.
HOOK
The key!? She has the lost key!?
CURATOR
Yes. No one has ever had so much,
been so close. We must stop her, or
it will be the end of us all.
HOOK
Then we will kill her, we will kill
her and all those with her.
CURATOR
And burn the map and retrieve the
key.
HOOK
It will be done. But what of the
American expedition? They leave
tomorrow as well.
CURATOR
Forget the bumbling Americans, they
will be like all the others. Without
the map to guide them, how can they
possibly find Hamunaptra?
SMASH CUT TO: our old traitorous friend BENI.
BENI
It is three days down the Nile, then
two days by camel, sahibs.
WE CRANE BACK: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of a
PASSENGER BARGE. Surrounded by DANIELS, HENDERSON and BURNS.
DANIELS
For all the money we're paying you,
something better god-damned well be
under that sand.
WE KEEP CRANING BACK: as Henderson slaps Daniels on the back.
HENDERSON
"Hamunaptra," Daniels, that's all ya
gotta keep sayin, to yourself,
"Hamunaptra."
Now we see all of GIZA PORT: Team of explorers swarm the
docks. Across the Nile, the PYRAMIDS spike the sky. Evelyn
and Jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by HAWKERS
selling everything from toy tombs to King Tut action figures.
EVELYN
Do you really think he'll show up?
JONATHAN
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he
may be a cowboy, but his word is his
word.
EVELYN
Personally, I think he's filthy,
rude and a complete scoundrel. I
don't like him one bit.
O'CONNELL (O.S.)
Anyone I know?
They both turn. O'Connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit
and polished, with a new haircut and clothes. He looks more
dashing and handsome than ever. Evelyn is suitably impressed.
EVELYN
Oh... um,... hello.
Jonathan grabs O'Connell's arm and shakes his hand.
JONATHAN
Smashing day for the start of an
adventure, eh, O'Connell?
O'Connell quickly checks his pockets.
O'CONNELL
Yeah, sure, smashing.
He finds his wallet and relaxes. DIRECTLY ABOVE HIM: on the
bow of the barge, Burns wipes his bifocals and turns to Beni.
BURNS
You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?
BENI
Along with the scorched bones of my
entire garrison, sahib.
And that's when Beni spots O'Connell. Beni shakes his head,
as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the
men.
BENI
A thousand pardons, my good sahibs
but there is much work to be done.
Beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold.
BACK DOWN WITH: Evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.
EVELYN
Mister O'Connell, can you look me in
the eye, and guarantee me this is
not some sort of flimflam? Because
if it is, I'm warning you --
O'Connell steps up close to Evelyn, invading her space looks
her straight in the eye. Evelyn doesn't back away.
O'CONNELL
All I can tell you, miss, is that my
Colonel found that map in an ancient
fortress, and the whole damn garrison
believed in it so much, that without
orders, we marched halfway across
Libya and into Egypt to find that
city. Like I told ya, all I saw was
sand. Everybody else was wiped out
by Tuareg warriors. I'll take your
bags.
O'Connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto
the same passenger barge that Beni and the Americans are on.
Evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. Jonathan sees it.
JONATHAN
Yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude,
a complete scoundrel, nothing to
like there at all.
Evelyn gives him a look. Jonathan just grins. And that's
when the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy
hat.
WARDEN
A bright good morning to all.
EVELYN
What are you doing here?
WARDEN
I have come to protect my investment,
thank you very much.
And up the plank he goes. Evelyn and Jonathan share a look.
WE GO WIDE AGAIN: as the barge pulls out and heads down the
Nile. WE TILT UP: to the SUN, which then DISSOLVES into --
The MOON, shining down on the desert. The THREE VICIOUS MUMIA
quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river. The one
with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff, the other two
row, heading for the PASSENGER BARGE coming their way.
Jonathan and the three Americans are playing poker. O'Connell
comes out a door carrying a GUNNY-SACK.
JONATHAN
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we
could use another good player.
O'CONNELL
I only gamble with my life, never my
money.
DANIELS
Never? What if I were to wager five
hundred dollars says we get to
Hamunaptra before you?
O'Connell returns Daniel's cocky look.
O'CONNELL
Yer on.
Burns slips on his dirty bifocals.
BURNS
What makes you so confident, sir?
O'CONNELL
What makes you?
Henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon.
HENDERSON
We got us a man who's actually been
there.
O'Connell's poker face drops, perplexed. Same with Jonathan.
JONATHAN
I say, what a coincidence, why --
O'Connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the
gunnysack, shutting him up. Jonathan quickly covers.
JONATHAN
-- whose deal is it? Is it my deal?
I thought I just dealt?
Evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river.
The gunny-sack DROPS onto the table, startling her.
O'CONNELL
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
EVELYN
The only thing that scares me, Mister
O'Connell, are your manners.
O'CONNELL
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
EVELYN
If you call that a kiss.
O'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out
revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun,
and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.
EVELYN
Did I miss something? Are we going
into battle?
O'CONNELL
The last time I was at that place
everybody I was with died.
This takes the smile off Evelyn's face. O'Connell starts
dismantling and cleaning the guns.
O'CONNELL
There's something out there, you
know, something under that sand.
EVELYN
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain
artifact, a book, actually, my brother
thinks there's treasure. What do you
think is out there?
O'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes.
O'CONNELL
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin
believe that Hamunaptra is cursed,
they call it, "the doorway to hell."
EVELYN
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to
the underworld", actually.
She gives him a know-it-all grin.
EVELYN
I don't believe in fairy tales and
hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do
believe that one of the most famous
books in history is buried out there,
The Book Of The Living. It's what
first interested me in Egypt as a
child. It's why I came here, sort of
a life's pursuit.
O'CONNELL
And the fact that they say it's made
out of pure gold, makes no nevermind
to you, right?
Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.
EVELYN
You know your history.
O'CONNELL
I know my treasure.
Evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns
back to O'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says:
EVELYN
By the way,... why did you kiss me?
O'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders.
O'CONNELL
I was about to be hanged, seemed
like a good idea at the time.
Evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off.
O'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed.
O'CONNELL
What?... Wha'd I say?
Then he hears someone SNICKERING under the table. He quickly
reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. It's Beni.
BENI
My very good friend! What a surprise.
O'CONNELL
Why if it ain't my little buddy,
Beni. I oughta kill you.
O'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat. Beni swallows
hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.
BENI
You never were any good with the
ladies, O'Connell.
O'CONNELL
So you're the one leading the
Americans, I shoulda figured. So
what's the scam? You get 'em out in
the middle of the desert then leave
'em to rot?
BENI
Unfortunately no, these Americans
are smart, they pay me only half
now, half when I get them back to
Cairo, so I must go all the way.
O'Connell pulls the knife away. Beni relaxes, rubs his neck.
BENI
You never believed in Hamunaptra,
O'Connell. Why are you going back?
The devil himself lives out there.
They look as they hear Evelyn YELP. A single CAMEL in the
HORSE PADDOCK takes another bite at her. She YELPS again and
backs away. O'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck.
O'CONNELL
The girl saved my life, figured it
was the least I could do, keep her
out of trouble.
BENI
You always did have more balls than
brains.
O'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni.
O'CONNELL
Let's make us even, shall we?
BENI
Even?
O'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge.
Beni SPLASHES into the river. O'Connell takes his gunny-sack
and starts walking off down the deck.
BENI (O.S.)
O'Connell! I am going to kill you
for this!
O'CONNELL
Sounds familiar.
And that's when he spots THREE SETS OF WET FOOTPRINTS, coming
up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck.
O'Connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.
O'Connell and Evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse
paddock. People are SCREAMING and SHOUTING, lots of panic.
BLAM! A chunk of the wall is BLOWN OFF next to Evelyn's head.
O'Connell pivots and FIRES BACK. It's the last Mumia, on the
other side of the paddock. He and O'Connell exchange GUNFIRE.
Another LANTERN BURSTS INTO FLAMES. O'Connell SHOOTS OFF the
paddock lock. The horses go nuts. O'Connell FIRES over their
heads. They CHARGE FORWARD and CRASH through the door. The
Mumia SCREAMS as the horses STAMPEDE over him. FLAMES sweep
up the walls and race across the roof. Half the barge is now
ON FIRE. O'Connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder.
O'CONNELL
Can you swim?
EVELYN
Well of course I can swim, if the
occasion calls for it.
O'CONNELL
Trust me.
He picks her up and throws her over the side.
O'CONNELL
The occasion calls for it.
Evelyn SPLASHES into the water. O'Connell dives in after
her.
Jonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans,
guns in every hand, fanning their pistols, SHOOTING everything
in sight. Jonathan just shakes his head.
JONATHAN
Americans.
Hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, -- now a FLAMING TORCH.
Jonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his
FLAMING ARM and pins him to the cabin wall. Jonathan's eyes
widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the FLAMES about to
strike him. The Americans pivot and OPEN FIRE. Blows Hook
over the railing. Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles.
JONATHAN
I say! Good show!
Then he points his thumb at himself
JONATHAN
And did I panic?
He lifts up his other hand, -- he has the key/box back.
JONATHAN
I think not.
And that's when the horses STAMPEDE onto the bow. Jonathan
dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other.
NILE RIVERBANK - NIGHT
O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the
water. Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she
wrings it out. She looks good. O'Connell notices.
Everybody else, including the horses, is getting out on the
far shore O'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans.
BENI
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I
got all the horses!
O'CONNELL
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on
the wrong side of the river!
Beni looks up at the stars, then angrily KICKS the sand
CURSING. The FLAMING barge drifts off, slowly sinking...
BEDOUIN TRADING POST - DAY
O'Connell barters in ARABIC with a CAMEL TRADER at a trading
post. Jonathan forks over some cash. The Trader hands them
the reins of four ugly old camels.
JONATHAN
I can't believe the price of these
fleabags.
O'CONNELL
We coulda had 'em for free, all we
had to do was give 'em your sister.
JONATHAN
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
O'CONNELL
Awfully.
And that's when Evelyn steps out of a trading tent. She's
changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress.
O'CONNELL
Then again...
SAHARA DESERT SAND DUNES - DAY
O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the warden are on camels in
the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked Sahara.
JONATHAN
Never did like camels. Filthy buggers.
They smell, they bite, they spit.
Disgusting.
The warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile
green teeth. Flies buzz around his head. He sucks at his
gums, then spits out some gristle. O'Connell watches him.
O'CONNELL
Yeah, disgusting.
Evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel.
EVELYN
Well I think they're cute.
WE DO SEVERAL TIME DISSOLVES: showing the majesty of the
desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it.
FRYING PAN - NIGHT
The MOON shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking
across the vast wasteland.
Jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to the
rhythm of his camel. On the camel next to him, the Warden
SNORES LOUDLY. Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly starts to
slide off her saddle. O'Connell reaches over and stops her,
then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle, never waking
her. For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn, and then he
looks up at a distant ridge --
-- where Ardeth Ray and a group of MUMIA RIDERS are pacing
them.
The dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as
Jonathan and the Warden ride alongside a giant sand dune.
JONATHAN
And you snore!
WARDEN
I do not snore!
JONATHAN
All night you snored!
WARDEN
I have never snored!
Up in front of them, O'Connell looks at Evelyn.
O'CONNELL
We're almost there.
EVELYN
Are you sure?
O'Connell looks down at the ground.
O'CONNELL
Pretty sure.
The others look down and see DOZENS OF SKELETONS sticking
out of the ground. Bleached and eaten away. Some of the
skeletons look like they're trying to crawl up out of the
desert floor.
JONATHAN
What in bloody hell is this?
The Warden shivers in fear.
WARDEN
Other seekers of Hamunaptra.
The American Expedition rides out from behind the far end of
the dune. The Americans are accompanied by TWO DOZEN NATIVE
DIGGERS and an Arab EGYPTOLOGIST. Beni rides lead on a camel,
the rest ride horses.
BENI
Good morning, my friend!
O'Connell just nods. The two parties come to a stop a hundred
feet apart. O'Connell turns and stares out across the endless
horizon. Beni does likewise. The Americans look puzzled.
DANIELS
Well, what the hell we doin'?
BENI
Patience, my good sahib, patience.
Henderson looks over at O'Connell.
HENDERSON
First one to the city, O'Connell!
Five hundred! Cash bucks!
O'Connell and Beni just stare out at the flat nothingness.
Evelyn and Jonathan share a look. And then, the SUN starts
to rise in the distance, breaking the flat horizon.
O'CONNELL
Get ready.
Evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment.
EVELYN
For what?
O'CONNELL
We're about to be shown the way.
Far off to the right, a HUGE SHAPE begins to rise with the
sun. A VOLCANO. O'Connell and Beni watch it, expressionless.
Daniels, Henderson and Burns share a look, and then --
DANIELS/HENDERSON/BURNS
HEYA!
The Americans take off. Racing towards the rising volcano.
DANIELS
SEE YA THERE, O'CONNELL!
Evelyn and Jonathan give O'Connell anxious, sarcastic looks.
JONATHAN
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't
we be going?
EVELYN
After all, you rode us night and day
to win that bet.
O'Connell doesn't say a word, staring hard. Beni watches the
Americans and spits into the sand.
BENI
Fools.
And then suddenly, the volcano SHIFTS ACROSS THE HORIZON.
Passing across the sun as it goes. It's a MIRAGE.
The Americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other
way, after the volcano. Evelyn and Jonathan smile, amazed.
The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN, floating across the watery horizon.
The Americans crash to a stop again and chase after the
volcano. All three of them confused and CURSING. O'Connell
and Beni just stare, waiting. The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN. And
the Americans crash to a stop again. Burns is THROWN from
his horse. Henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it
to the ground. Daniels just curses as they give up the chase.
The volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon.
The Americans are on the far right. Nothing moves. A BEAT.
And then O'Connell grins. So does Beni. They share a look.
And then SWAT their camels and RACE AWAY. Everybody else
hauls-ass after them. O'Connell and Beni are neck-and-neck.
And then Evelyn comes galloping up, hair flying in the wind.
Beni takes out his camel whip and starts WHIPPING O'Connell.
Trying to knock him off his camel. once. CRACK! Twice. CRACK!
But on the third try O'Connell grabs the whip and JERKS Beni
off his camel. Beni SLAMS to the ground and TUMBLES.
Evelyn and O'Connell race across the desert. Evelyn has never
felt so alive. She LAUGHS. O'Connell grins; he likes this
girl. Beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of
the way as Jonathan and all the other riders stampede past
him. Evelyn beats O'Connell to the stone ramp, racing hard.
O'CONNELL
Evelyn! Slow down!
Evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate.
O'CONNELL
SLOW DOWN, EVELYN! SLOW DOWN! THERE'S
A REALLY BIG --
Under the guidance of the Egyptologist, the Diggers are busy
hauling rock and dirt out of the Temple doorway. The three
Americans are playing poker. Beni smokes a hookah and swats
flies. Dozens of stray CAMELS roam the decrepit city; dusty
backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps.
DANIELS
Where'd all these camels come from?
BENI
They belong to the dead. They will
wait years for their masters to return
before leaving.
O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden are working next
to a narrow CREVICE, which weaves it's way through the ruins.
O'Connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of
the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down. Jonathan
bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he YELPS
and backs away. It's the decrepit FACE OF ANUBIS.
JONATHAN
That thing gives me the creeps.
O'CONNELL
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
Evelyn is positioning ancient MIRRORS along the crevice.
EVELYN
That "thing" gets me excited.
O'CONNELL
(sarcastic)
The things that get you excited.
EVELYN
According to Bembridge Scholars,
inside the statue of Anubis was a
secret compartment, perhaps containing
The Book Of The Living.
O'CONNELL
What are those mirrors for?
EVELYN
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.
O'Connell shrugs, then rappels down into the crevice.
Evelyn and Jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire.
EVELYN
What do you suppose killed him?
JONATHAN
Did you ever see him eat?
O'Connell comes up over some rocks.
O'CONNELL
Seems the Americans had a little
misadventure of their own today,
three of their diggers were killed.
EVELYN
How?
O'CONNELL
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid.
Some sort of ancient booby-trap.
JONATHAN
Maybe this place really is cursed.
A GUST OF WIND blows through the camp.
The campfire FLICKERS O'Connell and Jonathan share a nervous
look. Evelyn laughs.
EVELYN
You two!
O'CONNELL
You don't believe in curses, huh?
EVELYN
No. I believe if I can see it and I
can touch it, then it's real. That's
what I believe.
O'Connell cocks his rifle, KA-CHANK! Gives her a big grin.
O'CONNELL
I believe in being prepared.
Jonathan opens the Warden's POUCH, the one that held the
scarabs. He reaches in, starts scrounging around. WE SLOWLY
PUSH IN. Waiting for the attack. THE MUSIC BUILDS. And then, --
Jonathan SCREAMS in pain and RIPS his hand back out of the
pouch. O'Connell and Evelyn both jump.
O'CONNELL/EVELYN
WHAT?! WHAT IS IT?!
Jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch
and pulls out a LIQUOR BOTTLE, the top has been chipped off.
JONATHAN
Seagrams!
Jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside
out and shakes it, nothing but SAND is inside it.
JONATHAN
Well, he may have been a stinky
fellow,... but he had good taste.
Jonathan takes a swig. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily
And then O'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear
to the sand. Evelyn and Jonathan watch him. A BEAT. And then
a BARAGE OF GUNFIRE IS HEARD coming from the American camp.
O'Connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to Evelyn.
O'CONNELL
Stay here!
He takes off running through the ruins. Evelyn immediately
gets up and runs after him. Jonathan grabs a gun, holds the
bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her.
JONATHAN
Evy! Excuse me! But didn't the man
just say -- !
The American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS
gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as
they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill
multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps
SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY.
O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni,
who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there.
O'CONNELL
Goin' somewhere?
BENI
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I
wanted to be with my friend!
O'Connell drags him back towards the American camp.
O'CONNELL
C'mon, friend.
BENI
(struggling)
Why do you like to fight so much?
O'CONNELL
'Cause I look good doin, it.
Ardeth Ray gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down
with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks,
LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to
the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point
blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Ray's hand. O'Connell
is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them.
A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off,
misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider
off his mount. The horse BOLTS. -- But Ardeth Ray is gone.
Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly,
she hears something coming up behind her and spins around.
A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly
backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises
his scimitar, about to strike.
Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a rock and FIRES the elephant
gun, -- BLAM! Blows the Rider off his mount and CATAPULTS
him twenty feet back into some ruins.
At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and
over a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand
dune.
Jonathan and some Diggers are holding their own near the
temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them.
Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams.
JONATHAN
Let 'em have it, boys!
Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears,
the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins.
JONATHAN
I say, bloody good show.
And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land
behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around
and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat.
O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something
THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Ray
on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively raises
his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES!
Hits his gun, -- CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed,
O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick
of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It
IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Ray, towering above him. The two
men lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Ray
points his scimitar at O'Connell's head.
ARDETH RAY
LEAVE THIS PLACE!... LEAVE THIS PLACE
OR DIE!
Ardeth Ray GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after
him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave,
then turns to the burning fuse,... and blows it out. Evelyn
staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her
and holds her close.
O'CONNELL
You alright?
Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time
he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's
also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too.
EVELYN
Yes,... fine,... thank you.
Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and
Burns help Daniels to his feet.
DANIELS
See! That proves it! Old Seti's
fortune's gotta be under this sand!
HENDERSON
For them to protect it like this,
you just know there's got to be
treasure down there.
O'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied.
O'CONNELL
These men are a desert people. They
value water, not gold.
Evelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried.
EVELYN
Where's Jonathan?
Jonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open.
Mouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close
and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk.
O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves,
the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the
bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly --
EVELYN
Unlike my brother, sir, I know when
to say no.
O'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away.
O'CONNELL
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I
don't get. You're a whole new brew.
EVELYN
I know, you're wondering, what's a
place like me doing in a girl like
this?
O'CONNELL
Something like that.
EVELYN
Egypt is in my blood. My father was
a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so
much that he married an Egyptian. My
mother! Who was quite an adventurer
herself
O'CONNELL
Okay, I get your father, I get your
mother and I get your brother, but
what are you doing here?
Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet.
EVELYN
I may not be an explorer, or an
adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or
a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But
I'm proud of what I am.
O'CONNELL
And what is that?
Evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins
and proudly lifts her head high.
EVELYN
...I am a librarian!
She leans in, very close to his face, looks him in the eyes,
EVELYN
I'm going to kiss you, Mister
O'Connell.
O'CONNELL
No you're not.
EVELYN
I'm not?
O'CONNELL
Not unless you call me Rick.
EVELYN
Why would I do that?
O'CONNELL
Because that's my name.
She gives him a goofy smile. He leans forward and KISSES
HER. Evelyn's eyes slowly close. And then she passes out,
slumping into his arms. O'Connell looks down at her, and
just smiles.
The two camps have now joined together. O'Connell and Beni
are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire. Jonathan
wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell.
JONATHAN
What is this stuff? It smells like
our late friend, the Warden.
O'Connell and Beni both grin. Jonathan looks horrified.
JONATHAN
You did not!?... We're not!?
O'CONNELL
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and
taste worse, but that's the best the
desert has to offer.
The gloating Americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars.
HENDERSON
Say O'Connell, whadaya think these
honey's'll fetch back home?
BURNS
We hear you gentlemen found yerselves
a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations.
DANIELS
Ya know if ya dry him out, you can
sell him for firewood.
The Americans laugh. Evelyn walks up, sits down and drops a
pile of big dusty BUG SKELETONS onto the ground.
EVELYN
Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found them
inside our friend's coffin. They can
stay alive for years living off the
flesh of a corpse, or in this case...
She shrugs, then looks at the roasting meat
EVELYN
Famished.
O'Connell and Jonathan stare at the bug skeletons, disgusted.
O'CONNELL
Are you saying somebody threw these
things in with our guy, and they
slowly ate him alive?
EVELYN
Very slowly.
JONATHAN
He certainly was not a popular fellow
when they planted him.
O'CONNELL
Must of got a little too frisky with
the Pharaoh's daughter.
EVELYN
According to my readings, our friend
suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of
all ancient Egyptian curses, one
reserved for only the most evil
blasphemers. In all of my research,
I've never read of this curse actually
having been performed.
O'CONNELL
That bad huh?
EVELYN
Yes, they never used it because they
feared it so. It's written, that if
a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever
arise, he would bring with him the
ten plagues of Egypt.
O'CONNELL
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten
plagues.
BENI
Like what that Moses guy did to that
Pharaoh guy?
EVELYN
That's one way of putting it.
JONATHAN
Let's see, there was frogs, flies,
locusts...
BURNS
Hail and fire.
HENDERSON
The sun turning black.
DANIELS
Water turning to blood.
JONATHAN
And my personal favorite: people
covered in boils and sores.
All the men share nervous looks, really spooked. Evelyn just
laughs at them, then pulls a meat stick out of the fire.
EVELYN
Fried gizzard anyone?
Having just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple
and steps past the sleeping Diggers. She spots the
Egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm,
the Book Of The Dead laying loose under the other. Evelyn
stares at the Book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks
over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip-toes away.
Lying on some blankets by the campfire, O'Connell rolls over
and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book.
O'CONNELL
You sure you outta be playin, around
with that?
EVELYN
It's just a book, no harm ever came
from a book.
Evelyn opens the cover. THE FIRE FLICKERS. She and O'Connell
share a nervous look, then Evelyn shrugs and starts reading.
EVELYN
Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.
Evelyn continues READING THE BOOK ALOUD IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.
The Egyptologist sits bolt upright. Quickly looks around,
sees Evelyn reading the Book. He gets up and runs for her.
EGYPTOLOGIST
NO! NOOOO! YOU MUST NOT!
He skids to a stop as a strange, piercing WHINE is heard,
coming from out in the desert. O'Connell and the others all
leap to their feet. The Americans run out of their tents.
The SOUND gets LOUDER and CLOSER. And then from out of the
darkness a HUGE WALL OF LOCUSTS SWIRLS into camp and envelops
everyone. O'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their
side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid
vermin as they go. Beni and the Americans run for the temple.
The Egyptologist is covered in locusts. He stares at The
Book Of The Dead, looking haunted.
EGYPTOLOGIST
What have we done?
The campfire is SUCKED UP INTO THE AIR
SAND and WIND whip through the ruins as O'Connell and Evelyn
stumble up out of the crevice and COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH TEN
ARMED MUMIA. The Mumia quickly raise their guns. O'Connell
and Evelyn quickly raise their hands. Jonathan, Henderson,
Daniels and the Egyptologist are already on their knees,
hands over their heads. Ardeth Ray steps forward.
ARDETH RAY
I told you to leave or die, you
refused, and now you may have killed
us all. For you have unleashed the
creature that we have feared for
more than four thousand years.
O'CONNELL
Relax, I got him.
ARDETH RAY
No mortal weapons can kill this
creature. He is not of this world.
O'CONNELL
Are we talkin, about the same
creature? The walking corpse? Really
big mouth? Really bad breath?
Several Mumia drag Burns up, he stares out with vacant
sockets. Daniels and Henderson are especially horrified.
DANIELS
You bastards!
HENDERSON
What did you do to him!?
ARDETH RAY
We saved him! Saved him before the
creature could finish his work. Now
leave, all of you, quickly, before
he finishes you all.
JONATHAN
You're not going to kill us?
Evelyn ELBOWS Jonathan in the ribs.
ARDETH RAY
We must now hunt him down, and try
and find a way to kill him, before
he consumes the earth. Allah be with
us.
Ardeth Ray and the Mumia start heading down into the crevice.
O'Connell yells at them, trying to convince himself.
O'CONNELL
I told ya, I already got him!
Ardeth Ray stops and looks back, deadly serious.
ARDETH RAY
Know this, the creature will be coming
for you. He must consummate the curse.
And until he does, he will never
eat, he will never sleep, and he
will never stop.
Ardeth Ray turns and jumps down into the crevice,
O'Connell and Jonathan boost Evelyn up onto a camel. Daniels
and Henderson throw Burns up onto another. The Egyptologist,
still clutching The Book Of The Dead, gets up on yet another.
They all head off into the dark, windblown desert...
And then in the extreme foreground, A SKELETAL HAND SUDDENLY
PUNCHES UP OUT OF THE SAND, ACCOMPANIED BY THE MOST HORRIFIC,
PRIMORDIAL SHRIEK IMAGINABLE --
IMHOTEP
ANCK-SU-NAMUUUUUN!!!!
A British flag flies over BRITISH SOLDIERS manning the front
gate. Our tired, disheveled Heroes saunter up on their dusty
camels. The Soldiers check their papers, then let them enter.
O'Connell angrily strides through the compound. He sees Beni
coming up the path with a MAN dressed in hooded robes, his
face covered by an ornate death mask. Imhotep disguised.
O'CONNELL
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did
you slink off to?
BENI
You left me! You left me in the desert
to rot.
O'CONNELL
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.
(gestures to Imhotep)
So who's this guy?
BENI
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest
of Osiris.
O'CONNELL
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?
O'Connell sticks out his hand, -- Imhotep instantly recoils
O'Connell gives him the once-over. Beni quickly covers.
BENI
The Prince does not like to be touched
by other humans. A Silly eastern
superstition, I'm afraid.
O'CONNELL
Yeah, well, we all got our little
problems today don't we?
BENI
He has come to help Mister Burns.
Somehow I feel responsible.
O'CONNELL
Don't gimme that, you never had any
scruples.
BENI
Do you know where I can steal some?
O'Connell fake-punches him. Beni flinches. O'Connell gives
Imhotep a look as he strides off.
O'CONNELL
See ya around, Padre.
Imhotep's grotesque new eyes glare out from behind the mask.
LIGHTNING FLASHES as O'Connell races across the compound,
knocking several Soldiers out of his way, panic stricken.
O'CONNELL
Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!!
Evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of
books. A BLAST OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING scares her. She drops
half the books. Then a HAND GRABS HER! She jumps again and
drops the rest of the books. It's O'Connell, breathing hard.
O'CONNELL
We got problems.
And that's when a barrage of HAIL AND FIRE slams into the
courtyard. O'Connell and Evelyn jump back. A water fountain
bursts into STEAM. A wooden trellis catches FIRE. O'Connell
and Evelyn run under the eaves as SOLDIERS, SERVANTS and
CAMELS run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom.
O'CONNELL
He's here! I saw him! That thing is
here!
EVELYN
The creature!? Are you sure!?
O'Connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the
HAIL and FIRE.
O'CONNELL
Pretty sure!
The HAIL and FIRE come to a stop. Everything goes dead quiet.
O'Connell and Evelyn freeze. And then a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM
is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them.
O'Connell and Evelyn race up the stairs.
O'Connell looks out a window at the British Soldiers manning
the walls. Above and beyond them, -- is the BLACK SUN.
Evelyn and Jonathan are pacing the foyer
EVELYN
We must stop him from regenerating.
She turns to Daniels and Henderson.
EVELYN
Who opened that chest?
HENDERSON
Well, there was me and Daniels here
and then poor Burns of course, oh
yeah, and that Egyptologist fella.
O'Connell turns from the window.
O'CONNELL
What about my buddy, Beni?
DANIELS
Naw, he scrammed outta there,
EVELYN
We must find the Egyptologist and
bring him back here to the safety of
the fort, before the creature can
get to him.
O'Connell looks at Evelyn, Daniels and Henderson.
O'CONNELL
Okay,... Evelyn, you wait here, you
two come with me.
All three of them pounce on him at once --
HENDERSON
The hell with that! I'm not goin'
nowhere! We're safe here.
DANIELS
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for
nothin'.
EVELYN
Who put you in charge? You can't
just leave me behind like some old
suitcase. I'm the one responsible
for this mess and I intend to be the
one to clean it up.
O'Connell just shakes his head and SIGHS. Totally put-upon.
Then he takes Evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the
door and locks it with a skeleton key. From inside her room
we can hear Evelyn POUNDING on the door and YELLING.
O'Connell throws the skeleton key to Daniels.
O'CONNELL
Keep an eye on her. If you leave her
door, I'll rip your spleen out. C'mon,
Jonathan.
Jonathan swallows hard and points to himself.
JONATHAN
Me?
CAIRO ALLEYWAYS - BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT
The Egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys, looking
haunted. He clutches the Book of The Dead in one hand and
his SACRED CANOPIC JAR in the other. Imhotep is stalking
him. A STREET VENDOR turns and sees Imhotep's horribly decayed
face.
He reacts and scurries away. Imhotep lifts his robe, covers
his face, and moves in on the Egyptologist, who is heading
into the bazaar. WE PAN UP TO --
THE EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT
Beni is RANSACKING the joint, pulling out drawers and files
and throwing them on the floor. He finds a silver pocket
watch, shakes it, then throws it into his pocket, then he
starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves.
O'CONNELL (O.S.)
Well, well, well.
Beni spins around. O'Connell and Jonathan stand in the door.
O'CONNELL
Lemme guess, spring cleaning?
Beni turns and runs for an open window. O'Connell grabs a
chair, FLINGS IT into his path. Beni TRIPS and CRASHES into
a wall. O'Connell strides over, grabs him and lifts him up
the wall. Beni's feet dangle off the floor.
O'CONNELL
Where's your new friend?
BENI
What friend? You're my only friend.
O'Connell quickly slides his knife up under Beni's chin.
O'CONNELL
Then you got no excuse for living.
What the hell you doin, being buddies
with this creep, Beni? What's in it
for you?
BENI
It is better to be the right hand of
the Devil,... than in his path. As
long as I serve him, I am immune.
O'CONNELL
Immune from what?
BENI
You shall see.
O'CONNELL
What are you looking for? Lie, and
I'll slit your throat.
O'Connell shoves the knife deeper into Beni's skin.
BENI
The book! The black book they found
at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back.
Said to me it would be worth it's
weight in diamonds.
O'CONNELL
What does he want the book for?
BENI
(shrugs)
Something about bringing his dead
girly-friend back to life. He needs
the book...
(looks at Jonathan)
And your sister.
O'Connell looks at Jonathan. Beni seizes the moment and KNEES
O'Connell in the balls. O'Connell doubles over and collapses.
Beni leaps out the window. Jonathan cringes.
JONATHAN
That looked rather painful.
O'CONNELL
(wincing)
Ya know, ever since I met you, my
luck has been for crap.
JONATHAN
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
And that's when they hear a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM coming
from down in the bazaar. O'Connell and Jonathan scramble to
the window and look out --
Down in the bazaar, people are SCREAMING and quickly backing
away from the SHRIVELED CORPSE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST.
A partially decayed HAND reaches down and takes the sacred
canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand. It's
Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and
catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES;
his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a
huge SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight
up at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters.
The flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread
throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running.
EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT
O'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked.
O'CONNELL
Damn-it! That's two down and only
two to go.
JONATHAN
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
They turn and race out of the office.
BRITISH FORT - WINDOW --NIGHT
Daniels stares out a window, watching the British Guards at
the front gate. More Soldiers march the encircling parapet.
SOLDIER
Ten o'clock! All is well!
The lights and MUSIC from the Casbah come up from below
A FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling
with activity. Suddenly, a BREEZE kicks-in. GREEN MIST begins
to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls. The people
begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH, as if being hit by a
severe sickness -- it's already too late.
Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half rotted
off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is at his
side, looking very nervous.
And then, one-by-one, the people silently begin to follow
Imhotep, their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS
AND SORES.
The crazed mob CRASHES into the huge front doors, which are
locked. They pound furiously, throwing themselves at it while
CHANTING CONSTANTLY. Imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway.
Jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his
convertible. Suddenly, a splinter group of the diseased mob
comes around the side of the museum. Jonathan instantly bugs
his eyes out, starts drooling, and begins CHANTING --
JONATHAN
Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!
The crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors
of the museum. Jonathan leaps into the convertible, fires it
up and 180's it back over to the bushes.
O'Connell, Evelyn, Daniels, Ardeth Ray and the Curator jump
inside the car. Beni steps out of the museum and sees them.
BENI
Imhotep! IMHOTEP!
Imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper
windows just as the convertible PEELS OUT. O'Connell points
a finger at Beni as they race past him.
O'CONNELL
You're gonna get yours, pal!
Imhotep UNHINGES his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman
size, he lets out one of his horrific, primordial SHRIEKS.
His disease-ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out
of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car.
The convertible hauls ass down the narrow bazaar street.
Crazies start jumping out of stalls and LEAPING onto the
car. O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them
overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car,
CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not before
they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels out. He
TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs into a
corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble, killing
several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty, CLICK!
CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him like
rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear.
The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them
and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down
his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket,
and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He
holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through
his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.
WE CUT WIDE: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased
mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM...
The convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys. WE
DOLLY across the hood of the car from Jonathan to Evelyn to
O'Connell. Ardeth Ray and the Curator are still in the back.
All of them staring out the front windshield. Freaked-out.
Then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls CRASHES through the
windshield! Everybody SCREAMS. Jonathan hits the gas, loses
control, the car SLAMS into a wall. O'Connell grabs Evelyn.
O'CONNELL
C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!
They all leap out of the car. But the angry, festering mob
quickly surrounds them. O'Connell quickly reaches into his
gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into
his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way
to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth
Ray's stubbly face. Ardeth Ray YELPS. O'Connell holds the
lit match near the fuse.
The crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth, staring
at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes.
And then Imhotep steps through, -- having fully regenerated,
he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did
the day he was buried alive. Evelyn stares at him.
EVELYN
He's gorgeous.
O'Connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers. He
YELPS and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it
across Ardeth Ray's face again. Ardeth Ray YELPS and gives
O'Connell a look to kill. The Curator shakes his head.
THE CURATOR
He has consummated the curse, now
all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun
from the dead, then it will be the
end of us, and the beginning for
them.
Imhotep moves forward, heading right for them. O'Connell
LIGHTS THE FUSE. Imhotep steps up to O'Connell and stops,
watching the fuse burn down. it's a game of chicken. The
tension mounts. The LIT FUSE is about to vanish inside the
stick of dynamite, blowing it up, -- when Evelyn leans forward
and blows it out. O'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on
Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn.
IMHOTEP
Koontash dai na.
Beni steps through the swarming mass, translating.
BENI
Take his hand and he will spare the
others.
Evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty
crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars,
waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident,
powerful, invincible. Then she looks at O'Connell.
EVELYN
Any bright ideas?
O'Connell talks through angry, grit teeth.
O'CONNELL
Sorry, fresh out.
Evelyn looks back at Imhotep, then starts to reach out to
take his hand. Both O'Connell and Jonathan move to stop her, --
but Ardeth Ray grabs them both and holds them tight.
O'CONNELL
Don't do it, Evelyn.
EVELYN
I have no choice.
Evelyn's trembling hand touches Imhotep's: His hand closes
around hers. Nothing happens. Imhotep smiles.
IMHOTEP
Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.
BENI
Come with me my princess. It is time
to make you mine, forever.
Evelyn gives Beni a nasty look, correcting him --
EVELYN
All eternity, idiot.
Then she looks at O'Connell and puts on her best face.
EVELYN
You better think of something, because
if he turns me into a mummy, you're
the first one I'm coming after.
O'Connell almost smiles.
O'CONNELL
Got guts, lady.
EVELYN
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep
them.
Imhotep suddenly notices something. He reaches forward and --
RIPS THE KEY/BOX OUT OF JONATHAN'S UPPER JACKET POCKET.
JONATHAN
Hey that's mine -- !
Ardeth Ray holds Jonathan back. Imhotep pulls Evelyn away.
O'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of
Ardeth Ray's grip.
O'CONNELL
Evelyn!
The huge, powerful man holds him tight.
ARDETH RAY
Be calm. There is still time. We can
stop him yet.
The crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn. And then Imhotep
stops and looks back at O'Connell.
IMHOTEP
Pared oos.
Evelyn SCREAMS.
EVELYN
NOOO!!
Beni smiles.
BENI
Kill them.
Imhotep pulls her away. O'Connell breaks free of Ardeth Ray's
grip and stumbles forward.
O'CONNELL
EVELYN!
But the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill.
O'Connell quickly bends down, pulls open a CISTERN/MANHOLE
COVER and shoves Jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after
him. The Curator pushes Ardeth Ray towards the cistern hole.
CURATOR
Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!
The Curator turns and throws himself at the mob as Ardeth
Ray crawls down into the hole. The mob tears the Curator
apart.
A sewer grate is kicked out of a wall. O'Connell, Jonathan
and Ardeth Ray climb out of the hole and into AN ALLEY.
O'CONNELL
We gotta get her back.
JONATHAN
I'm with you, old man. No one touches
my sister like that and gets away
with it.
O'Connell looks at Ardeth Ray.
O'CONNELL
You know where he's taking her?
ARDETH RAY
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the
ritual.
Jonathan looks worried.
JONATHAN
And what ritual would that be?
ARDETH RAY
The ritual to bring the body of Anck-
su-namun back to life.
JONATHAN
And how does one do that?
ARDETH RAY
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
JONATHAN
Oh yes, of course.
ARDETH RAY
And then killing your sister.
JONATHAN
Excuse me?
Ardeth Ray looks at O'Connell.
ARDETH RAY
Imhotep is now able to cross the
desert with great haste.
Jonathan taps him in the shoulder.
JONATHAN
Begging your pardon, but I wasn't
quite clear on that last part.
Ardeth Ray ignores him.
ARDETH RAY
If he arrives before us, it will be
too late.
JONATHAN
Did you say 'kill' my sister?
O'Connell smiles.
O'CONNELL
I know how to beat him to it.
And on that WE SMASH CUT TO -- THE ERFOUD DUNES - DAWN
Jonathan's bashed-in convertible steams it's way up to a set
of semi-abandoned Quonset huts. A single WWI BIPLANE with
R.A.F. INSIGNIAS sits in the sand beside them. A SIGN READS:
HIS MAJESTY'S ROYAL AIR CORP
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray stand before Winston
Havlock, the massive dunes of Erfoud as our background.
WINSTON
So what's your little problem got to
do with His Majesty's Royal Air Corp?
O'CONNELL
Not a god-damned thing.
Winston looks intrigued.
WINSTON
Is it dangerous?
O'CONNELL
You probably won't live through it.
This really interests him.
WINSTON
By Jove, do you really think so?
JONATHAN
Everybody else we've bumped into has
died, why not you?
Winston nods his head, he's hooked.
WINSTON
So what's the challenge then?
O'CONNELL
To save the damsel in distress, kill
the bad guy and steal his treasure.
A slow grin spreads across Winston's face, then he gives
them a snappy salute.
WINSTON
Winston Havlock at your service,
sir!
SAHARA - DAY
Way off across the desert, a large SAND-DEVIL races over the
dunes. The SANDY WHIRLWIND comes to a stop and starts to
dissipate. Evelyn and Beni are suddenly ejected out of it,
they land in a dune. The SWIRLING SAND CONDENSES AND FORMS
INTO IMHOTEP. He looks up into the sky, listening carefully.
Evelyn shakes the sand out of her hair and looks at Beni.
EVELYN
What just happened?
BENI
All I remember is him turning into a
blast of sand,... and then I remember
nothing.
Then they hear a plane in the sky and look up.
Imhotep's jaw UNHINGES, his mouth opens to an inhuman size,
he lets fly with another one of his horrible SHRIEKS. -- And
a massive WALL OF SAND rises up out of the desert
BIPLANE - DAY
O'Connell watches the desert below him come alive and rise
up towards the plane. Winston looks over the side and sees
what's coming. He laughs, throws the throttle, and puts the
plane into a dive.
WINSTON
Hang on, men!
WE GO WIDE AS: The sandstorm chases the diving, twisting
biplane. Getting closer and closer, about to engulf it.
O'Connell looks back into the blinding sand and sees a GIANT
FACE forming inside the sandstorm. It's Imhotep. Grinning.
O'Connell grabs the Lewis machine-gun, cocks the bracket and
FIRES, blasting away at Imhotep's giant face inside the
sandstorm. Imhotep's face begins to laugh, then his jaw
unhinges, his mouth opens wide, and he ENGULFS the plane.
Winston blindly fights for control, elated.
WINSTON
We're going down!
The biplane SPINS inside the BLOWING SAND. Engines ROARING.
Wind HOWLING. Jonathan and Ardeth Ray SCREAMING. Winston
Havlock LAUGHING.
WINSTON
Here I come, laddies!
O'Connell braces himself for impact,
SAHARA - DAY
Evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep.
EVELYN
Stop it! You'll kill them!
Imhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare
into his shockingly intense ones. Then he kisses her, hard.
Evelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes
herself away and falls back into the sand. Imhotep laughs.
The biplane SMASHES over a dune, ROLLS OVER and CRASHES upside-
down into another dune. The SAND SWIRLS as O'Connell falls
out of the gunner's compartment. The left wing is jammed
into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down.
JONATHAN
Excuse me... A little help would be
useful... IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH
TROUBLE!!
O'Connell goes to help Jonathan. Ardeth Ray stumbles over to
the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's
mount. He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a
cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell
and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead.
A smile on his face. The plane suddenly starts to move, the
sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away.
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make it to some rocks and
look back. The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides
away over a dune. O'Connell gives it a salute. The plane
vanishes over the dune and into the SWIRLING SAND...
HAMUNAPTRA - DAY
O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray come down a ravine in the
volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra.
O'CONNELL
Okay, now what the hell does this
Horus guy look like?
JONATHAN
He's a big fellow with pointy ears
and a face like a falcon.
O'CONNELL
Got it.
HAMUNAPTRA STAIRWAY - DAY
Carrying TORCHES, O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make
their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. Heading
into the bowels of the necropolis. A passageway to hell.
NECROPOLIS - DAY
Evelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery. She
stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying through
the mausoleums and over the gravestones. Beni shoves his
rifle into her back and pushes her forward.
BENI
Keep moving.
Evelyn gives him a look.
EVELYN
You know, nasty little fellows such
as yourself, always get their
comeuppance.
Beni suddenly looks worried.
BENI
Yeah?
EVELYN
Oh yes, always.
Beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on
his lip. All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the
disgusting DETRITUS MOAT. Evelyn looks down at it, horrified.
Outside, Beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag filled
with treasure. He throws it over the rear of a camel.
Starts to climb up. Hesitates. Looks back at the temple door.
Licks his lips. And then his greed gets the better of him
and he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the
door.
The temple COLLAPSES as O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and a
pack of stray camels race through the ruins. A SINKING CREVICE
DROPS OUT right behind them. Chasing them out through the
front gates. The whole place RUMBLES ominously.
They make it down the ramp as more ruins CRASH DOWN behind
them. A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SAND AND DUST billows out over the
wall and into the air. our heroes and all the stray camels
race out into the desert...
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the
plateau, surrounded by stray camels. They stare off at the
sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to RUMBLE-ominously.
JONATHAN
Well,... I guess we go home empty
handed.
O'Connell looks at Evelyn.
O'CONNELL
Wouldn't say that.
Evelyn returns the look, A BEAT, and then she wraps-her arms
around his neck and kisses him. O'Connell returns it.
Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs
up onto a camel.
When the kiss is over, O'Connell and Evelyn share a smile,
then O'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs
Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. Evelyn wraps her
arms around his waist. O'Connell and Jonathan slap the reins.
O'CONNELL/JONATHAN
TUK-TUK-TUK!!
The camels start to move out. WE PAN DOWN: to the saddlebag
behind Evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, -- we can
see that it's filled with Beni's stolen TREASURE.
O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan ride off into the SUNSET.
