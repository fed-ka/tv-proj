      Graduates have just received their degrees.  They and their

      very happy occasion.  The parents are dressed up, the

      Liz is in a very London phase.  The girls flirt with their 
      father outrageously.  He loves it.

                    Danny, Zoe! 

      The helicopter engine is starting up again.

                                  ZOE
                    Leave it Tom.

      The noise is too loud to speak any longer.

      Danny and Zoe shepherd Fred toward the helicopter.  Danny 
      puts his arm on Zoe s shoulder.  Adam whispers something to 
                                  (MORE)
      Harry.  Harry comes close to Tom.

                    Not again.


      Tom gives him the pistol.  Harry wipes it carefully with the 
      edge of his coat then puts it in his pocket.  A police 
      vehicle arrives. 

                                  HARRY (cont d)
                          (To Adam)
                    Take him back.

      Harry runs away towards the helicopter. He joins Danny and 
      Zoe. They help him inside.

                    Do you understand?

                    No.  Sorry. 

      Behind them the helicopter takes off.

      Tom comes down the steps and walks away.

      And it s England on a wet, cold, miserable night in a dirty, 
      dangerous looking area.  A train bridge over a dark street.  
      The observation van is parked.  

      A huddled figure approaches the car.  A door is opened for 
      him.
