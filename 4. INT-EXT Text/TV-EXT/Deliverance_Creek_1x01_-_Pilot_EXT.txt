Wind waves blow over the Kansas prairie, an endless ocean of 
golden wheat beneath a brilliant blue sky.  We sink below the 
horizon to find...

DOZENS OF UNION SOLDIERS  CORPSES lie  hidden  in the grassy 
plains, the beauty of the pastoral landscape marred by decay.  A 
GANG of bedraggled BUSHWHACKERS pick over what s worth taking.

TOBY HARPER, reddish-blonde hair, filthy, but despite that, 
handsome.  He wearily watches BUZZARDS circle overhead as he 
TUGS at something...

He re-focuses on the task at hand, pulling the jacket off a 
dead Union soldier.  He finally succeeds and slips it ON, the 
sleeves inches above his wrist bone.  

TOBY
Goddamnit if this wasn t a platoon 
of Union dwarves --

He KICKS the dead body out of frustration --

We PULL BACK TO REVEAL fifteen YOUNG MEN all doing the same -- 
trying on boots, snapping off gold chains from broken necks, 
stealing mementos.  Stealing memories.  Nothing sacred.  
Nothing of value left behind. 

CYRIL BALFOUR, ragged scar across his face, soulless black 
eyes, watches something with just a flicker of amusement...   

CYRIL
Lookie here, one s still alive...

A UNION SOLDIER attempts to crawl away, pulling his limp and 
bloodied body across the dusty earth...  

A few of the gang look up to watch Cyril as he inches along 
behind him, like a cat who s grown interested once again with 
his half-dead thing.  2.


CYRIL (CONT D)
Runt -- c mere and get your pecker 
out.  

RUNT, clearly too young to serve, looks up at Cyril fearfully.  

Cyril lets the soldier continue on his pointless path, 
turning on Runt instead...

CYRIL (CONT D)
Come here.

Runt shoots a pleading glance over to the leader of their 
group, JASPER GATLIN.  Jasper wears his stolen Union blues 
like they were tailor-made for him.  His war-weary blue eyes 
meet Runt s, but he remains silent.

CYRIL (CONT D)
Do it.

Runt s hands shake as he takes a step forward and undoes his 
trousers.  A few of the gang whistle and clap.   

CYRIL (CONT D)
(re: soldier)
He looks thirsty, don t he?  

Runt looks down at the soldier, his mouth open... it dawns on 
him what he s meant to do.

RUNT
I, I -- I can t -- I just went.

Cyril whips out his pearl-handled BOWIE KNIFE while looking 
down at Runt s exposed genitals.  

CYRIL
Wouldn t take much to remove that 
lil  peckerwood, now would it?

JASPER
Cyril -- leave  im be.

Cyril slowly retreats from Runt, then with one long stride, 
places his boot in the middle of the Union soldier s back, 
pinning him.  He grabs a handful of the soldier s hair and then 
presses the blade into the soldier s forehead -- beginning to 
SCALP him alive when -- 

BAM -- a single bullet KILLS the soldier instead.  Cyril 
recoils from the shot -- angrily turns on Jasper who evenly 
looks back at him before he holsters his gun.3.


JASPER (CONT D)
(to MEN)
LET S PULL OUT, I WANNA HIT KANSAS 
CITY BEFORE NIGHTFALL.

CUT TO:

SUPER:  DELIVERANCE, MISSOURI


BELLE GATLIN BARLOWE, 28, steers a horse-drawn plow through 
the clumpy, dry earth.  She wipes her brow, leaving a dirt 
streak across her pretty face.  Belle is thinner than she 
needs to be, but her steely blue-gray  eyes reflect a 
strength that s gotten her through this war...  

Belle stumbles, quickly righting herself.  This is hard work.  
This is man s work.  But the men are off to war... well, most 
of them...  

BELLE
(pulling back on reigns)
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

Sensing something, Belle peers across the endless Prairie.  
Not a soul.  But after a moment, a LONE RIDER appears over 
the horizon.  Too far to know for certain... but whoever 
Belle thinks it is, fills her with dread... 

But then she sees the GLINT of METAL wink in the noonday sun 
and relief floods her face.  She smiles, and it s RADIANT.  

CLOSE ON THE LONE RIDER

NATE COOPER, 30, handsome.  His deputy s BADGE reflects the 
sun.  Nate gallops up, just a few yards from Belle, who 
pretends she hasn t seen him and continues to plow...

Nate slips off his horse and takes her in for a moment before 
moving towards her... he follows along behind until he reaches 
her, then slips his arms through hers, brushing past her 
waist, he takes the reins in his hands, stopping her mare.

They stand like that, still, the breeze blowing against them.  
Belle closes her eyes as he kisses the back of her neck.  She 
slowly turns into him, kissing him back as they stumble into 
the tall grass and disappear...  

Hungrily they start unbuttoning buttons, pulling off clothes, 
passionately devouring one another... 

...From far away, children s voices ring out, their joyful 
shouts and laughter coming closer and closer... 4.


Finally unable to ignore it, they pull away, lying flat on 
their backs, looking up at the clouds together.  

Nate laughs.  Belle shoves him.

BELLE
You have the worst timing...

NATE
C mon now... I m one of only two 
deputies left, I ve been busy... 

Belle turns away from him so he can button her back up.

BELLE
Let me guess, Roy got drunk again 
and exposed his willy again to 
Sally Kirkland? 

Nate just laughs as he fastens her buttons.  

BELLE (CONT D)
That s what I thought.  

Belle watches her children, FRANNY (5) ABNER (9) and CALEB 
(12) chase each other through the tall grass.  She looks past 
them up to the ridge line where Nate just came from...

BELLE (CONT D)
(quiet)
At first when I saw you ridin  up... 
I thought you were Harlan coming 
home.  People are sayin  the war s 
gonna be over soon... 

Nate buttons her last button, then picks a stalk of prairie 
grass, working it over in his hands.

NATE
You want me to stop comin  round, 
just say so.

Belle turns around to face Nate, she touches his cheek.  

BELLE
No, I want to see more of you, 
Nate.  I don t know why we re 
waiting anymore.  Not even a letter 
in over two years, if that don t 
make me a widow... 
(looks to children)
It ll be hard to tell them when the 
time comes, but me... 5.


Belle shakes her head...

BELLE (CONT D)
I just want to be with you.

Nate takes her hand and kisses her palm, then delicately 
moves the  ring  he fashioned out of prairie grass up her 
slender finger and positions it on top of her wedding band.  
The symbol and his intent clear.

She trails her hand down his chest to his belt buckle, then 
gives it a good tug.

BELLE (CONT D)
But you re not saying we have to 
wait  till then...?

NATE
No, ma am.
(smiles)
I m off duty Sunday.  Come to my 
house after dark.  You can be back 
before sunup.  

SUPER: KANSAS CITY, KANSAS


Jasper and his gang, now all wearing their stolen union blue 
uniforms, walk steadily towards a saloon where DOZENS of 
horses are tied up outside.

JASPER
Remember boys, we re from the 
Illinois 7th.


THE GANG BUSTS OUT OF THE SALOON SHOOTING -- 

TOWNSPEOPLE fire back as they ride out of town --  

BULLETS RIP through Toby who s SHOT off his horse.  

Jasper STOPS AND LOOKS BACK -- Cyril does the same --

CYRIL
LEAVE  IM --

Jasper pulls his gun on Cyril --

JASPER
COVER ME  --

Jasper dismounts, reaching Toby who clutches his shoulder.  
Blood spurts out between his clenched fist.  8.


Jasper sees the other bullet hole at his backside before 
swiftly gathering him up and throwing him onto the back of 
his horse.


Smoke rises from the chimney, a few lanterns illuminate the 
inside of the house.


Jeb quietly lets himself in.  His wife, CORDELIA CAULFIELD, 
looks up from setting the table for two.  Even in the dim 
light, she can see the RED HAND MARK on his cheek.  She peers 
at it, taking a few steps forward...

CORDELIA
Where ve you been?

JEB
Always with the goddamn questions.  10.


Jeb ducks out of the room, Cordelia turns and stares out at 
Belle s ranch, visible through their dining room window.

DISSOLVE TO:


Belle drives her wagon towards a little red schoolhouse that 
sits atop a hill, her children in the back.


Hattie walks out to greet them, tussles Caleb s hair before 
he ENTERS the schoolhouse.

CALEB
Hi Aunt Hattie -- Bye, Ma.

Hattie waits for him to be out of earshot.

HATTIE
Everything alright?

BELLE
It is, I just... have a favor to 
ask.  

Belle realizes this is harder to ask than she thought.

BELLE (CONT D)
Can you come Sunday night?

More children arrive for school, Belle lowers her voice...

BELLE (CONT D)
I won t leave  til the kids have 
gone to bed.  Be back before sunup.11.


HATTIE
Are you spending the night with...

Belle nods.  More CHILDREN run past greeting Hattie... 

HATTIE (CONT D)
(carefully)
This war isn t going to last 
forever, Belle...  What if Harlan 
finds out?   

BELLE
He s dead.  I know he s dead.

HATTIE
You don t know he s dead.

Belle is taken aback by her little sister s resistance.

HATTIE (CONT D)
People  round here are gonna figure 
it out, Belle.

BELLE
Tongues wag no matter what I do --

HATTIE
Not if you don t give them reason 
to!   
(taking Belle s hand)
Wait  til the war ends, then marry 
Nate, the whole town ll celebrate!

BELLE
We are -- but who knows how much 
longer this war is gonna drag on 
for. 

HATTIE
You were love sick over Toby once --

BELLE
I m not that sixteen year old 
anymore, Hattie.  And now that 
Daddy s dead and gone, maybe this 
time I get to choose who I love.  

Belle starts for her wagon.  Hattie watches her for a moment.

HATTIE
Belle -- 

Belle stops and smiles to herself, then turns to face Hattie.  12.


HATTIE (CONT D)
Of course I ll watch the kids.  I 
just hope all this turns out like 
you want it to.  


Jeb hooks the horses to the wagon, but all the time looks 
over to Belle s ranch.  His eyes rove over her land... 
Cordelia comes out and gets into the wagon.

JEB
(still looking next door)
That should be ours... all that 
land. 

CORDELIA 
I m going to be late.

JEB
That s how your Pa saw it.  This 
parcel was for you and me, and that 
was your sister Florence s -- it 
was supposed to stay in the family.

They ve been over this before.  

CORDELIA
Harlan remarried after Florence 
passed, Jeb, he married into it.
(pointedly)
Just like you.

But Jeb seems oblivious to the jab.

JEB
And what if Harlan s dead?  You 
gonna let her just keep your kin s 
land?

Off Cordelia thinking about that...


A small town on the banks of the Mississippi.


Three TELLERS behind bars help CUSTOMERS.  In a back office 
with the door open is Cordelia Caulfield poring over papers.  

BEN CAULFIELD, Cordelia s nephew, missing half his leg from 
the war, hobbles back with the use of a cane.   13.


CORDELIA
Why didn t you tell me Belle 
Barlowe is late on her payments?

Ben hesitates, leaning on his cane.

BEN
Everyone s late on their payments, 
Aunt Cordelia...
(off her glare)
She pays a little something each 
month.  Same as most other widows 
in town.  

CORDELIA
Last I heard, Belle Barlowe is not 
a widow.  

BEN
How s she gonna round up her cattle 
alone?  She s got lil  ones --

CORDELIA
Why do you defend her so...?  
(then it occurs to her)
You re sweet on her little sister, 
Hattie, aren t you?

Ben looks away uncomfortably.  Cordelia smiles, taking pride 
that she guessed right.

CORDELIA (CONT D)
Draft up a lien and nail it to her 
front door.     


Belle drives her horses home, she squints, seeing something 
on her front door, FLUTTERING IN THE WIND --

BELLE
(to horses)
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

Climbing down she makes her way to the NOTICE stuck to her 
front door... snatching it down she reads:

CAULFIELD & CO. BANK - NOTICE OF DELINQUENT LOAN -- 

Belle SCANS through the legalese language when she hears her 
KIDS CALLING OUT TO HER as they run across the fields.  She 
turns and watches them run towards her... CRUMPLES the 
notice, stuffs it in her pocket as she walks down to meet 
them.  Caleb instantly reads Belle s expression.14.


CALEB
Ma, what is it?

BELLE
Let s go brand the calves.


Belle and Caleb work in unison. Four calves race back and 
forth as they take turns trying to lasso them -- Franny sits 
on top of the fence watching, Abner holds the poker in the 
coals, the brand reads  HB  for Harlan Barlowe.  

Caleb herds a few in Belle s direction --

CALEBBELLE
YAH, YAH -- GIT -- YAH --CALEB -- IN THE CORNER --

Belle RELEASES the lasso -- it just misses the calf.  

Then Caleb SWINGS his lasso as Belle herds one towards him --  
ANOTHER MISS.  Belle throws her lasso out -- HOOKS ONE -- 

CALEB
YEAH!!!

Belle LEAPS off her horse and WRESTLES the calf to the ground, 
kicking up a halo of dust.  Caleb jumps off his horse and dives 
to his knees, tying the calves  front and back legs together -- 
Abner shakily holds the hot poker out in front of him as he 
approaches the calf.  Belle realizes he can t do it...

BELLE
Caleb, mark him --

CALEB
It s already been branded --

Belle scrambles from beneath the animal, crawling in the dust 
to see for herself -- 

CALEB (CONT D)
That s Jeb Caulfield s mark, ain t it? 

Belle heads for the other calves huddled in the corner -- she 
pushes through the animals, holding one, she brushes back the 
fur of one -- then another --

BELLE
That thievin  son of a bitch 
branded all our calves --15.



Jeb EXITS, his trousers still undone when he hears the 
distinct CLICK of a rifle hammer being pulled back.  

He FREEZES.  His back to us.

CLOSE ON BELLE HOLDING HER RIFLE

Jeb already in her sights.  Caleb stands tall beside her.

BELLE
TURN AROUND -- 

Jeb slowly shuffles around...

JEB
You re not gonna shoot an unarmed 
man comin  out of his privy...?

BELLE
I ll do whatever I goddamn please. 
(then)
Isn t that what you do, Jeb?

Belle fires into the ground BETWEEN HIS LEGS -- just inches 
from his boot, making him leap --

JEB
JESUS --

CALEB
(leaning in)
You miss your mark, or are you 
askin  him to dance?

BELLE
Haven t rightly warmed up yet.

Caleb nods.  The SHOT brings Cordelia and WOMEN from her 
sewing circle OUT onto the front porch... 

JEB
Get my gun, Cordelia --

BELLE
DON T -- or the next bullet lands.

The women murmur --   

CORDELIA
Any harm comes to my husband, 
they ll put you in jail Belle.16.


Belle speaks loud enough for everyone to hear.

BELLE
Who d fault a rancher who d had 
cattle stolen from them?  

Cordelia OPENS the screen door and reaches for their gun, Belle 
SHOOTS again -- it GRAZES Jeb s leg -- he DROPS to his knees.  

JEB
STAY PUT, WOMAN!  

Cordelia lets the screen door go... the only sound is the door 
banging on its hinges and the wind... Caleb leans into Belle.

CALEB
I think he s listening now...

BELLE
(nods)
JEB -- YOU OWE ME FOUR CALVES, YOU 
HEAR?

JEB
A trade?   Cause there s nothin  
wrong with those --

Belle leans down to take aim again --

JEB (CONT D)
Alright, alright --
(swears under breath)
Fine -- four.

Belle nods, then she and Caleb turn in unison and head back 
to their ranch.  After a moment of silence:

CALEB
I m quite certain if Jeb hadn t 
just visited the privy, he d a wet 
his pants for sure!

Belle laughs, the tension finally broken.  She takes a few 
deep breaths, calming herself as she pulls her son closer.

CALEB (CONT D)
You know what we should do...

BELLE
What s that?17.


CALEB
Set out tomorrow and look for the 
rest of our herd.  I see no reason 
we couldn t skip out on church.

BELLE
Skip out on church, huh?

Caleb nods.  Belle remembers her plans with Nate, smiles...

BELLE (CONT D)
No, Sunday s our day of rest.  The 
day we put our work aside and thank 
the good Lord for all that we have.

CALEB
Amen!


Belle, Hattie and the children in their sunday best.  Belle 
drives her wagon, passing DUKE S SALOON.  A few WHORES sit up 
in the windows watching the town go by.  It s their day of 
rest, too, at least until church lets out.

DUKE LAUGHLIN sits on the front porch, feet up on the railing, 
smoking a cigar.  Matinee idol good looks, sharp wit.  When he 
sees Belle and Hattie, he grins his Cheshire grin...

DUKE
(calling out)
Mornin  Miss Gatlin... Hattie.

BELLE
I ve been a Barlowe for some time 
now, Duke.

DUKE
You ll always be the Gatlin sisters 
to me.  
(tips his hat)
Pray for me, Hattie, won t you?

HATTIE
If you think it ll help.

He winks and raises his glass of whiskey as a  thank you.   
Abner looks back as a pretty prostitute who waves  goodbye ...

ABNER
Why don t Duke and those ladies 
ever turn out for church?

Belle and Hattie look at one another, suppressing a smile.18.


BELLE
Everyone worships in their own way.


Nate times his EXIT perfectly to match Belle s as the crowd 
carries them out of church.  He leans forward, whispers into 
the back of her neck...

NATE
Tonight?

She merely nods, never looking back at him.  He squeezes her 
hand -- unseen in the crowd -- before they EXIT the church.


The distant church bells are drowned out by the sound of 
thundering hooves as JASPER S POSSE gallops across the open 
prairie, heading straight for Belle s ranch.  Toby s bleeding 
and half-dead body slumped against Jasper...


Belle drives her wagon home, the children sing, all s right 
with the world.


Hattie drives her wagon in the inky darkness.  She approaches 
a lone farm house.  No lights.  22.


Suddenly, she sees one appear.  Then go OUT.  Then APPEAR.  A 
SIGNAL.  Hattie shakes the reins and heads for it.

BEHIND THE FARMER S BARN - CONTINUOUS

Hattie pulls the wagon up to a barn.  The barn doors slide 
open and we see Ben Caulfield (from the bank) waiting for her 
inside.  Is this a lover s tryst?  No.  Out of the shadows 
emerges another MAN.  Without a word, Hattie drives the wagon 
into the barn, Ben closes the doors.  

They work by the light of a single lantern.  The farmer OPENS 
a trap door in the floor to reveal four escaped SLAVES.  All 
men, the youngest barely a teenager.  Hattie jumps down from 
the wagon.

HATTIE
I can t take four... my sister s 
grain cellar will barely hold three 
what with the grain she s already 
got in there.

Ben and the FARMER look at one another.

BEN
There s bounty hunters all over 
lookin  for escaped slaves -- 

FARMER
I got an uneasy feelin ... 

HATTIE
I ll see what I can work out tomorrow, 
but I can t take more than three now.

OLDER SLAVE
I ll stay.  Take my boy, please...

He gently pushes forward the teenage boy.  Hattie nods, then 
peels back the tarp revealing a wagon half-filled with GRAIN.  
Without another word, the slaves climb into the back of the 
wagon.  And with Ben and the farmer s help, Hattie covers 
them with grain...


Out in the field, Jasper and his gang strip off their Union 
uniforms, throwing them in the growing bonfire...


Hattie drives her wagon along the cover of the ravine, 
approaching her sister s ranch from the field and not the 
road.  She gets out of the wagon, then quietly opens the barn 
door...


Hattie walks quietly between the barn and the house, but before 
she reaches it -- Cyril GRABS HER FROM BEHIND -- a pistol at 
her head.  

CYRIL
You alone?

She nods, his hands still clamped over her mouth, the other 
cinched around her waist.  

CYRIL (CONT D)
You better hope somebody knows you.


Belle stands  guard  holding her shotgun while Hattie gets 
the slaves back into the wagon.  

HATTIE
You can t let Jasper and his gang 
stay, Belle --

BELLE
Toby s too shot up to ride on.27.


Hattie stops shoveling grain back in the wagon.

HATTIE
Wait -- Toby s here?!!

Belle takes the shovel out of Hattie s hand.

BELLE
There s no time for that --

Belle quickly collects burlap sacks, about to toss them into 
the back of the wagon when she STOPS -- seeing the BOY.

BELLE (CONT D)
How old is he?

HATTIE
He can understand you, Belle... 

Belle s gaze shifts back to the boy.

BOY
Twelve, ma am.

BELLE
This your Pa?

Belle looks at one of the men.  The boy shakes his head.

HATTIE
We had to leave his Pa.  No room. 

Belle forces herself to look away from the boy s large 
fearful eyes as Hattie gestures for them to lie down.  She 
and Belle throw the tarp back over them.  They get to work 
tying down their respective sides.

BELLE
You re going to take them back, now.  
At least he ll be back with his Pa.

HATTIE
Old man Spencer s worried about 
bounty hunters --

BELLE
So should you be.  They find you 
with slaves, they ll hang you -- 

Hattie refuses to look up.  Belle walks around and takes 
Hattie in her arms, making her sister look at her.28.


BELLE (CONT D)
Hattie, you re making me sick with 
worry.  This is too dangerous --

HATTIE
I don t have family like you --

BELLE
We are your family, Hattie... I am 
your family.  And that boy should 
be with his.  Take them back.   

Belle takes Hattie s hand, helping her up onto the wagon.

BELLE (CONT D)
You gotta go tell Nate I m not 
coming.  Just don t tell him why.   
If you think you ve been followed, 
tell him.  He ll help you. 
(slides open doors)
Now you be careful --


Smoke rises from the Barlowe ranch house chimney, but the 
small bonfire out in the field can also been seen from...


Hattie heads back to the farmer s house in the black of 
night.  She drives her wagon over a rise in the road, seeing 
a GLOW UP AHEAD -- 

THE SPENCER S BARN AND HOUSE ON FIRE

TWO BODIES HANG FROM THE TREE -- From the glow of the fire we 
just make out it s the bodies of the farmer and his wife.  
Over the crackling FIRE the sound of a bullwhip as the SLAVE 
she could not take gets whipped by BOUNTY HUNTERS --  Hattie -
- panicked -- turns her horses around and flees --

FROM THE BACK OF THE WAGON

The teenage BOY peeks out from under the tarp to see his 
father getting whipped over and over again.  WIDE EYES, a 
muffled cry.  Horror.  A hand gently pulls him back under.


END OF ACT TWO29.


ACT THREE


Cyril sleeps off his whiskey, propped up in a chair on the 
front porch, his shotgun cradled in his arms.


Nate silently approaches the house.  He sees CYRIL on guard.  
Nate draws his gun, Nate steps on a twig -- SNAP --

ON PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Cyril s head rotates to the sound -- his eyes scanning the 
shadows.  He cocks his pistol, walking straight towards the 
copse of trees -- 

FROM THE DARKNESS

Belle s dog RUNS OUT --

Cyril slowly lowers his gun, turns and walks back...

BACK TO WOODS

Nate remains motionless, making sure Cyril returns to his 
post, then resumes moving towards the house...


Nate PEERS into the windows, SEES DOZENS OF MEN ASLEEP on 
Belle s floor...

OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM - SAME

Nate watches Belle tenderly check Toby s temperature with the 
back of her hand.  As if feeling Nate watching her, Belle  
looks out again... This time, Nate steps out of the shadows.35.



Belle joins Nate beneath a cluster of trees.  

NATE
Are you and the kids alright?

BELLE
Hattie shouldn t have said anything --

NATE
She didn t.  You tell her to lie to 
me?
(off her silence)
Who are those men?

BELLE
It s my brother, and some of the 
men he served with --

NATE
And he s been shot?
(gestures to window)
Your brother?  

Belle finds herself staring at the window...

BELLE
No.  He s... an old friend. 

It feels strange coming out of her mouth and they both know 
it.  Nate can see she s covering something... 

NATE
Get the kids up, I m taking you 
with me.  

Nate takes her arm firmly, starts walking her to the house --

NATE (CONT D)
Because I m sure as hell not going to 
ride off and just leave you here --

Belle wrestles out of his grasp, incensed --

BELLE
Well that s not your say --

NATE
Belle... what s it look like for a 
woman to be out here alone with 
them?  It s a small town.  There s 
no secrets here.36.


And the way he says it means he s already heard a few things 
about Belle that she s not told him.  Belle looks away...

NATE (CONT D)
I know who you are, Belle... but 
others aren t going to be so 
understanding --

BELLE
I don t need you to protect me.

After these words, a jagged silence... 

BELLE (CONT D)
I can take care of myself.  

NATE
If that s what you want, fine, you 
can have it.

And with that, Nate turns and leaves her, disappearing into 
the woods as Belle stands alone in the moonlight.


END OF ACT THREE37.


ACT FOUR

FADE IN:


Illuminating the darkness, smoke and tinny music drift 
through the night air.  Hattie walks past, disappearing into 
the alley...


Jasper and his gang saddle up to go out with Belle.  Caleb 
appears, dressed and ready to go.  

CALEB
Why didn t you get me up?

BELLE
I need you here --

CALEB
(angry)
But Ma, you promised -- we was 
planning this!

Belle walks over to him, lowers her voice so only he can hear.

BELLE
I need you here.  Toby s gonna need 
lookin  after.  You and the kids 
stay home, you keep them here, you 
understand?

Caleb still mad, finally nods.  

BELLE (CONT D)
You re the man of the house now, 
Caleb.  So act like it.

CALEB
(stands straighter)
Yes ma am.

Belle climbs up on her horse, nods to Jasper.  Caleb follows 
them out, watching them ride off... 


Jeb tentatively makes his way across the field, his hunting 
rifle slung across his chest, but his hand resting lightly 
upon it.  He furtively eyes Belle s ranch and the approaching 
cinder pile from the bonfire...

Bits of singed paper get caught up in swirls of dust devils, 
spinning past him.  He takes his rifle and pins one of the 
papers to the ground.  40.


Bending down, he picks up the half-burned document.  Sealed 
with a wax stamp it reads:  ILLINOIS 7TH REGIMENT.  He creeps 
towards the bonfire, seeing a shiny object through the 
blackened pile of ash he pokes around with his rifle, 
unearthing a BRASS NAMEPLATE of a Union soldier...

He looks over to Belle s lifeless ranch, but sees nothing.


Jasper s gang herd about thirty head of Barlowe cattle along 
the wide Missouri river.  Belle rides a pace behind Jasper 
and Runt, within earshot...  

RUNT
So when s we robbing the bank, 
Jasper?  D you know when the gold s 
coming in?

Belle laughs behind them, Jasper shoots her a look.

JASPER
You ll be the first to know, Runt...
now go on up front for awhile, keep 
your eyes peeled for injuns.

Runt nods and takes off.  Belle takes his place.

JASPER (CONT D)
Don t you start...

BELLE
Seems like a perfectly reasonable 
question...

JASPER
Well go on... you ve always been 
the clever one.  How would you go 
about this?

BELLE
Well, seein  as how I m the clever 
one, I wouldn t.

Jasper turns and looks at Belle who smiles.

JASPER
That ain t fair.  I know you ve got 
a notion or two how to figure it 
out.  Hell, you ve probably already 
figured it out, haven t you?  

BELLE 
(changing the subject)
Jasper... when this war s over, you 
could still move back home.  Find 
yourself a wife.  Have kids, settle.

JASPER
There won t be jobs for men like me 
after the war, Belle... 
(MORE)44.

JASPER (CONT'D)
the only thing I know how to do is 
rob and kill. That s all any of us 
know how to do.  And when the south 
falls, there ll be no heroes  
welcome for us.  No goin  back to 
the way life used to be...  It s 
over. 
(smiles sadly)
And I don t see why you need to 
work so hard to keep that ranch. 
With the money we ll make from the 
bank, you can take the kids and 
leave, start over somewhere fresh.

Belle looks down at her hands loosely holding the reins, we 
see she wears the grass ring Nate made for her...

BELLE
Maybe I want to start my life over 
right here at home... in Deliverance.

JASPER
You got yourself a fella, Belle?  
Is that what s changed you?  
(off her silence)
Well, we re robbing the bank.  With 
or without you.

BELLE
This is where we part.
(stops her horse)
Here s the Shawnee Trail... you tell 
your boys if they see a badge riding 
up to hold their fire.  See you back 
at the ranch, big brother. 

Belle drives her cattle along the trail while Jasper watches 
her leave...


Belle rides back into town on horseback, her dog following, 
now free without her thirty head of cattle.


They talk barely above a whisper...

HATTIE
They hung old man Spencer and his 
wife last night, bounty hunters --

BELLE
Oh my God, what happened to...?

Hattie forces a smile at a PASSERBY...

HATTIE
They re at Duke s, hidden -- all 
but the father, they took him.

BELLE
Wait, Duke is involved in this?

HATTIE
(shakes his head)
I didn t know where else to turn...

Belle clocks that, but knows this isn t the time to ask.  
Belle stares at Duke s Saloon across the square... trying to 
think... she watches the BARMAN roll out an empty WHISKEY 
BARREL... then ANOTHER.  Belle smiles, turns to Hattie.46.


HATTIE (CONT D)
(beat)
What?  

Belle takes a few dollars off the top of her pile.

BELLE
Give this to Duke, he s going to 
lose a few of his whiskey barrels.
(off Hattie s confusion)
I think a grown man could just 
about fit in one of those, and a 
boy would fit quite easily.  I m 
pretty sure Duke gets his whiskey 
supply from across the river in 
Kansas, isn t that so?

Hattie smiles, realizing the answer is that simple.  Belle 
quickly kisses her cheek, then forces the money into Hattie s 
hand before heading back into the --


Belle EXITS the BANK -- then STOPS when she sees UNION 
SOLDIERS everywhere.  Belle quickly goes around the side of 
the building where she sees Nate.  Her face floods with 
relief -- wanting to go to him, but then remembers their 
fight.  She starts to go around the corner when he looks up 
and sees her -- signals for her to wait.

NATE
(approaching)
Hello, Mrs. Barlowe... have you 
seen a man of this likeness or any 
of these men around town?

Belle frowns, seeing now that Nate is being trailed by the 
Union soldiers.  She forces herself to flip through the 
sketches, slowly shaking her head... 

BELLE
No, I have not... 

Belle hands them back to the Soldier.  Nate tips his hat.

NATE
Alright then, you be careful riding 
back to your ranch now, Mrs. Barlowe.
(carefully)
Be sure to lock all your doors, 
we ll check on you later...

Belle feels his searing gaze and knows what she must do.  

BELLE
Thank you, deputy... gentlemen.

ON THE BACK COUNTRY ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

Belle GALLOPS at full speed --  48.



Nate and Sheriff Knox come out, a UNION OFFICER with them.

UNION SOLDIER
That s right, a group of my 
soldiers got a tip that they might 
be hiding out on a ranch not far 
from here, they headed out.

NATE
(worried)
Which ranch?

UNION SOLDIER
I believe it was Barlowe?

BARN - CONTINUOUS

Belle looks down at Toby who waves he s okay as she CLOSES 
the CLAY PIT where the slaves were kept.  Jasper s men are 
already getting onto their horses -- 

BELLE
Head for the ridge line --

Belle races for the house. She peers off in the direction to 
town -- sees a cloud of DUST as the soldiers GALLOP closer -- 


Belle OPENS her door.  She looks out to see a group of UNION 
SOLDIERS.  At the back of the crowd is Jeb. 

BELLE
What can I help you with, 
gentleman?

OFFICER
We d like to search your property, 
ma am.

BELLE
What for?

OFFICER
A band of bushwhackers.  We ve been 
informed they might be here...

BELLE
There s no such men here.  You can 
come in and look for yourself -- 
But may I ask, what brought on this 
accusation besides wagging tongues?  

He extends the singed piece of regimental paper and a few 
burnished name tags...

OFFICER
This was found here on your 
property.  Can you explain why you 
would be burning Union Officer 
identification papers from the 
Illinois 7th regiment?

Belle looks from the singed paper back to the Officer.

BELLE
Why do you think I burned it?  
Because I m ashamed.  It s no 
secret my husband fights for the 
Confederates, as do many men from 
this part of Missouri.  In the 
letters he sends home, he 
includes... little mementos for his 
sons from his victories.  I won t 
even let the kids see them because 
it s shameful, which is why I burn 
them.  We pray for soldiers both 
North and South, we pray this war 
to be over.  51.


Silence as the MEN take this in, wanting to be civil to the 
attractive, young woman.  

JEB
She s a bold faced liar --

Across the mob, Jeb and Belle square off.

JEB (CONT D)
Everyone in town knows her husband 
hasn t written in years --

BELLE
You gonna listen to a coward who paid 
to get out of servin  in this war? 

But SOLDIERS shove past Belle to get into her home --

OFFICER
YOU TWO, GO CHECK THE BARN --


Nate and Sheriff Knox gallop down the road to Belle s 
house...


At the edge of the meadow on a rise overlooking their ranch 
is where they bury Caleb.  Pearl, Hattie and Belle sit in 
front with Franny and Abner, everyone but Belle cries -- she 
seems to have no tears left.  Nate stands at the back.  

PREACHER
(reading from Bible)
The LORD is my shepherd; I shall 
not want. He maketh me to lie down 
in green pastures: he leadeth me 
beside the still waters. He 
restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in 
the paths of righteousness for his 
name s sake. 

Two MEN SHOVEL DIRT onto the small, wooden box.  Belle 
flinches as each shovel-full of dirt hits Caleb s coffin.

PREACHER (CONT D)
Yea, though I walk through the 
valley of the shadow of death, I 
will fear no evil...

Belle rises, stumbling towards her ranch...

PREACHER (CONT D)
for thou art with me; thy rod and 
thy staff they comfort me. Thou 
preparest a table before me in the 
presence of mine enemies...

Nate goes to follow her, but Hattie reaches for him -- 

HATTIE
Leave her.

Nate nods, watching Belle walk across the prairie alone...

DISSOLVE TO:


Indian summer is over.  The wind blows over the brittle 
Prairie grass... an eternity since Belle and Nate lay in 
their cove together.55.


CLOSE ON NATE:  watching the wind waves blow over the land... 
Instead of a horse, Nate drives a wagon.  We hear the faint 
plinking of piano keys.  In the back of the wagon is a piano...


The three of them huddled over a small table as Belle 
continues to unspool her plan...
