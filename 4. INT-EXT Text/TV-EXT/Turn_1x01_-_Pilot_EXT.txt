Skimming the waves of the Atlantic toward a sandy beach, a
green coastline.  Rising up above the trees to look out across
raw, untouched land that stretches for miles.   

AMERICA before it was ours.  

We FLY over forest, over farmland.  Massive, GREEN, sun-
kissed.  Bursting at the seams with promise.


We GLIDE above the treeline, like God inspecting his good
work.  The FOREST drops away to reveal a pastoral clearing. 
Green grass turned Rust Red with spilled blood.

23 DEAD MEN lie scattered below a HILL.  We slow our flight
and circle the massacre.

CLOSER - the dead are soldiers in blue coats, light breeches,
knee-high black boots with silver spurs.  CONTINENTALS.

Morning FOG mixes with powder smoke still fresh in the air. 
A KILLER moves along the fallen like a grim reaper, shoving
a bayonet in each one to make sure they're dead.  He's dressed
in a green double breasted coat with dark brown leggings.  A
SCOTS BONNET on his head.  A QUEEN'S RANGER.

STAB.  On to the next.  STAB.  That body groans.  STAB STAB. 
On to the next.  Like raking leaves.

RACK FOCUS to a corpse ten feet away.  Its eye OPENS.  Sees
the Ranger coming this way.  STAB.  Walk.  STAB.  Walk.  

Face still pressed to the ground, the eye looks up to the
HILL, where figures of MEN sing in the smoke of cook-fires.

The eye closes, playing possum.  The RANGER STABS the corpse
next to us.  Then walks to us.  Moccasins on his feet. 
Looming over, he casts a shadow.  Raises his bayonet.  STABS-

As this corpse TURNS - the bayonet drives into the earth, as
ANOTHER BLADE DRIVES UP INTO THE RANGER'S GROIN.  He doubles
over, wheezing in shock, coming face to face with BENJAMIN
TALLMADGE, 23, very much alive.  Ben pulls his bayonet free
and JAMS IT through the Ranger's chin, piercing his vocal
cords.  Blood runs out his mouth and down Ben's wrist.  

The Ranger hits the ground next to Ben, who stays down.  Ben
begins to wrestle his own blue coat off, and grab for the
Ranger's green one.  He looks quickly back to... 2.

ATOP THE HILL

Where FORTY RANGERS clad in Green and Brown relax after the
battle, paying no attention to the clearing below.  Not a
man among them has been wounded in the skirmish.  In addition
to their muskets, they carry TOMAHAWKS and KNIVES.  

CAMERA finds their leader, ROBERT ROGERS, 43, weathered muscle
over an alchoholic's gut, eyes that you never want to look
directly into.  The ultimate hunter/killer.  He lights a
steatite pipe, listens to his men singing songs. 

A rough-looking Ranger walks to slope, looks down the hill.  

The man among the dead is walking to the treeline.  

RANGER
Welsh!  Welsh!

IN THE CLEARING 

Ben freezes, his back to the hill.  He's wearing the Green
Coat and the Scots Bonnet and carrying the bayoneted rifle. 
He turns slightly to regard the figure atop the rise.     

RANGER (CONT'D)
You done yet?!

Ben makes the universal gesture for "I'm hurrying already,
shut up!"  He looks down at a fallen comrade, grits his teeth
and STABS the already-dead body to ensure his cover.  

Walks to the next.  A 20 year old boy with lifeless eyes. 
Ben STABS him in the chest, tears in his own eyes.  Moves on
to the next - STAB - working his way to the treeline through
a hell he will never forget... 

ATOP THE HILL

The rough-looking Ranger walks back to the cook fire.

RANGER (CONT'D)
Fool starts from the center and works
his way out.  Takes double the time.  

Chuckles around the camp.  Robert Rogers does not smile.  

He puts his pipe in his mouth and walks to the slope.

Sees a figure in the fog, heading for the treeline.  

Rogers watches him.  Then WHISTLES loudly.  Ben turns back. 
Rogers knows.  He shoulders his musket, pipe still in mouth.3.

Ben RUNS, enters the forest.  Rogers FIRES.  His men TURN. 
The round whistles through the branches and CLIPS Ben on the
shoulder (even at this range).  Ben stumbles, keeps running.

RANGERS stream down the hill past Rogers as he reloads.


Ben RUNS through the forest, breathing hard, branches whipping
at him as the foreground blurs and the sound drops away...

BEN (V.O.)
They were waiting for us.  They knew
where we'd be.

GENERAL SCOTT (V.O.)
They couldn't have known.

BEN (V.O.)
They were waiting.  

CUT TO:


GENERAL SCOTT (V.O.)
You have no friends in New York.  

The SUN RISES over well tended fields of green.  A FARMHOUSE
sits in the distance, chimney smoking.  Cool blue dawn.  

SUPER: INK SCRIPT writes across the bottom left of the screen:

Setauket, Long Island


Along the planted rows of cabbage and kale, ABRAHAM WOODHULL,
22, plays with his one-year-old son, THOMAS.  Abe is a tall
and lean farmer, intelligent and humble.  

Right now he's on all fours, just like Thomas, who hasn't
learned to walk yet.  Abe stands up, acting a bit wobbly,
and takes a few steps, hoping Thomas will do the same.  

ABE
See?  It's easy.  You just... walk.

Thomas stares at him, transfixed.  Then laughs.

THOMAS
Jus' ba!

Abe patiently smiles, properly chastised for his efforts.  


The Redcoat, BAKER, exits the house and walks through the
field with his rifle and haversack, on his way to duty.

Abe's smile fades.  He picks Thomas up into his arms.  

Thomas happily CALLS OUT to the Redcoat, and waves to him.  6.

The Soldier waves back.  As he disappears around the bend,
Abe sets Thomas back down, to get him to try again.    

Mary walks up, wiping her hands on her apron.  

MARY
Sure you want him to walk so soon?  

THOMAS
He's almost a year old.  

MARY
Faster he learns to walk, the sooner
he learns to march.  

ABE
Good point.  

Abe lies back on the soil next to Thomas. 

ABE (CONT'D)
You're a smart one, Thomas.  Just
like your Ma'.  

Thomas happily crawls on to Abe.  Mary smiles at her men.  


Later in the day, Woodhull tends to his crop, along with two
AFRICAN SLAVES.  

One of the Slaves shows him a head of cabbage that is being
devoured by MAGGOTS.  Abe, worried, looks out over the field -
about half of his crop seems affected.  

Abe nods, ruefully accepting this fate, and then explosively
HURLS the head of cabbage as far as he can throw it.  


A small coastal town halfway out on Long Island.  Abe drives
his wagon past the central feature - a Presbyterian Church
converted into a military barrack.  The graveyard has been
overturned and the building fortified with an earthwork topped
with sharpened wooden poles, built to withstand a frontal
attack.  Swivel guns are set in the church windows.  REDCOATS
DRILL in a march outside.  


Abe brings his wagon to a stop outside of a white two story
house converted into a tavern.  He can hear laughing inside.

Abe takes a deep breath, steels himself for what he must do.  7.


A noose is thrown over a tree, and the rope is fastened to
the trunk by Will Robeson and three other TORY TOWNIES.

Behind them, a horse and RIDER canters into the village green. 
The rider wears a black coat, is a stern looking man in his
forties, with deep set eyes and the bearing of a Dean or
Professor.  This is JUDGE MAGISTRATE RICHARD WOODHULL.     

The Tories stop what they are doing and nod respectfully to
the Judge.  Richard fixes Robeson with a withering stare. 
He continues on toward the church.   

Richard approaches the REDCOAT GUARDS at the church doors.

RICHARD
Is the Major in?

One of the Guards nods, but gives a signal to wait.  We
recognize this man as the one who was billeted at Abe's farm.


Joyce exits quickly past Judge Woodhull, who is allowed entry.


Abe and Selah are marched out by four Tories.  Suddenly, Abe
is stopped, and Selah is pushed on.

Simcoe pulls a knife and walks behind Abe.

ABE
What are you doing?

Simcoe cuts through his binds.  Abe spins and backs away,
but Simcoe just ignores him and follows the men marching
Selah off into the night.  

ABE (CONT'D)
Where are you taking him?

SIMCOE
It's past curfew.  Run home to your
father. 

Selah looks back at Abe with a terrified glance as he is
pushed away into darkness.

END ACT ONE16.

ACT TWO


Abe walks home under the moonlight.  Candles flicker in the
windows of his house.  He holds his bruised rib cage.

Rain starts to patter on the cabbage leaves.


RAIN POURS DOWN.  Selah is locked into a wooden stockade,
shivering to the bone.    

He hears a faint splash behind him.  Someone coming.  

SELAH
Who is that?  Who's there?

Abe appears, clothes soaked.  He kneels before Selah.

SELAH (CONT'D)
What are you doing?  There's a sentry-

ABE
He's staying dry.  Listen well, we
don't have much time.  They are
planning to charge you with
insurrection.  

SELAH
I struck a Redcoat.  That's all that
matters.

ABE
Not if you plead guilty to the first
charge.  
(MORE)20.

ABE (CONT'D)
Everyone knows Joyce is a brute. 
They don't want to hang anyone in
Setauket.  Not in "secure territory." 
They'll send you instead to the Jersey-

SELAH
The Prison Ship?

ABE
Where you have friends.  You know
others who have gone, and others who
have gotten out.  If you bribe the
right person-

SELAH
Is that why you came here?  To tell
me this?  

ABE
I came to warn you.  

SELAH
And to have me forgive your debt, no
doubt.

ABE
I will repay my debt.  In full.  

SELAH
How?  How when your crop is half
dead.

ABE
The London Trade.  Cabbage is in
high demand.  

SELAH
On the black market?!

ABE
I've already made arrangements with
someone I trust.  

SELAH
It's too much risk.  

ABE
Not your concern.  

SELAH
Yes, it is.  I'll make you a new
deal.  
(swallows)
Take care of her for me. 21.

ABE
What?

SELAH
Take care of Anna when I'm gone, and
I'll forgive you your-

ABE
I don't need your forgiveness.  

Silence.  The rain pours.  

ABE (CONT'D)
You are her husband, Selah.  And I'm
going to repay my debt.  

Abe walks off.  Selah hangs his head.  


The rain has ceased.  Water drips off cabbage leaves. 

A sawing sound brings us to Abe, who cuts cabbage heads from
their stalks with a harvest knife.  He inspects the blade in
the moonlight, breathing through his nose. 

We begin to hear the chorus of a SPIRITUAL HYMN.


Mary's eyes flutter open.  She sits up in her bed.  Thomas
sleeps beside her.  

Abe's side of the bed is empty.  The AFRICAN HYMN continues.


Abe pushes out in a boat across the Long Island Sound.  It
is a beautiful morning.  His boat is stuffed with cabbage
under a tarp.  The AFRICAN HYMN continues.


AFRICANS work the field.  JORDAN, 25, walks up slowly to
something in the tall grass.

As soon as he gets a good look, he reacts and runs.

Captain Joyce lies in the grass, eyes staring at nothing. 
His throat is cut and maggots swarm around the wound.  

The African Hymn swells to an apex as we...

END ACT TWOACT THREE


Several large WARSHIPS from the greatest naval power on Earth
tilt like giants in the fog off the Sound.  SUPER inks out:

Brooklyn Harbor, New York


On the dock, a trunk of money escorted by two Redcoats is
inspected by Robert Rogers.  He nods, and it's hefted by two
Rangers up a gang-plank to the HMS VULTURE, an armed sloop.  

One of the Redcoats whispers to Rogers, nods to a nearby
alley.  Rogers almost rolls his eyes, and struts over there. 
Tomahawk, powder horn and pistols rustling on his belt.  


Rogers materializes from the fog, mud and blood clinging
from his clothes.

A British Officer, MAJOR JOHN ANDRE, distractingly handsome
in an immaculate uniform, waits patiently down the alley.

ROBERT ROGERS
This is all very secret.

JOHN ANDRE
This is war.  You never know who's
listening.  

ROBERT ROGERS
Some intelligence for you, John?  
(loud whisper)
England controls the Harbor.  Bunch
of blokes in red out there.  Big
Navy behind them.  

JOHN ANDRE
Thank you.  This is why you're worth
every penny - no matter what General
Clinton says. 

Andre hands him a note.  

ROBERT ROGERS
What's this?

JOHN ANDRE
A test.

ROBERT ROGERS
Not for me. 23.

JOHN ANDRE
For my source within the rebel camp. 
It's the location of a secret store
in Connecticut.  A safehouse.  We'd
like you to give it the treatment
you gave the Continental Dragoons.

Rogers hands the address back.

ROBERT ROGERS
Scraps.  Feed it to your Regulars.

He turns to leave.

JOHN ANDRE
If the intelligence proves true, I
can trust his word on targets with
higher value.  Like Washington.  

Rogers considers this.  Something personal there.  

ROBERT ROGERS
Who is this mythical source of yours? 
Someone I know?  

Andre is silent, enigmatic.

JOHN ANDRE
You won't do it?  

ROBERT ROGERS
For double we will.  Recompense for
the last test.    

JOHN ANDRE
Recompense?  You lost one man.

ROBERT ROGERS
And a coat.  And a bonnet.

No love lost between the Officer and the Mercenary.


Abe guides his little scow into a nondescript inlet.  A
WHALEBOAT, sort of like a reinforced canoe with a collapsible
mast, is already "docked" on the shore.  SUPER inks out: 

Connecticut  Coast   


Abe splashes aground, drags his boat up.  He whispers.

ABE
Caleb?...  Caleb?24.

Nothing.  Abe tries to whistle... which is cut off as he is
roughly grabbed from behind, a KNIFE on his throat.

CALEB
Give us a kiss.

Abe struggles to get free, but he s being held by a much
larger man.  The man laughs, and releases Abe.  Scrambling
around, he sees CALEB BREWSTER, 25 - burly, hair slicked
back by salt water.  A permanent grin plastered on his face.

ABE
Never do that again.

CALEB
You always enjoyed a good laugh.

ABE
You don't know me that well, Brewster.

CALEB
I've known you your whole life,
Woodhull!  Never figured you for a
black marketeer, though...  

ABE
This is a one-time deal.

CALEB
Well, then let's see what we have.

He tears back the tarp on Abe's boat. 

CALEB (CONT'D)
Cabbage!
(tears off a piece)
Mmm.  Fresh.  Heavily rationed. 
They'll pay top coin for this in the
Bowery.  All that fine china and no
healthy greens to set on 'em. 

ABE
That what you have?  Fine China?

Abe gestures to Caleb's whaleboat cargo.

CALEB
Oh, ho.  A challenge.  Witness...
(pulls back his tarp)
Gloucester Cheese.  Ceylon Tea. 
Cathay Silk, by way of London...

ABE
You said top coin, not top silk.  My
haul's worth twenty pounds sterling.25.

CALEB
That's funny, you don't look like
King George.  Do I look like King
George?

ABE
There are other buyers...

CALEB
Ten.

ABE
I have a whole bushel!  

CALEB
I can pay you double that in
Continental Dollars.

ABE
And I'd be the only idiot to take
it.  Pounds, Caleb.  Fifteen-

CALEB
Twelve.  When did you get so vicious?

ABE
Twelve, and that silk.

Caleb tosses him the silk, counts out the money from a purse.  

CALEB
Silk for the missus, eh?  How are
things back home?

ABE
Thomas is almost starting to walk.  

They start loading cabbage into Caleb's boat.

CALEB
How old is he now?

ABE
It will be one year, next month.

CALEB
Is he bothered by all the new guests
in town?

ABE
No.

CALEB
They still maintain a full garrison? 
In Tallmadge's old church?26.

Abe is silent.

CALEB (CONT'D)
How many stationed there?

ABE
I keep my eye to my crop.

CALEB
When you're not smuggling it.

ABE
This is a one-time deal.

CALEB
I'm just making talk.  I miss our
old stomping ground, is all.  Don't
like the idea of those bloody-backs
stompin' on it.  

ABE
They're no trouble.  

Caleb watches Abe...


The area around Joyce's body has become a crime scene of
sorts.  Major Hewlett stands by, supervising.  An ARMY
CHAPLAIN kneels over the body, administering last rites.

Richard Woodhull approaches Hewlett and Lieutentant Simcoe.

RICHARD
Jonathan Lewis is the owner of this
field.  Claims he heard nothing. 
He's loyal to the crown.  I believe
him.

Hewlett looks down at the corpse with disappointment.  

HEWLETT
Captain Joyce led many successful
raids, but had a reputation for
brutality.  He was an obvious target
for assassination.  

SIMCOE
Sir, don't you wonder if this may be
linked to the incident at the Tavern?

RICHARD
Perhaps if Selah Strong was a suspect,
but he was locked in the stockade
all night.  His wife, howev-27.

SIMCOE
I didn't ask you.  
(to Hewlett)
What about the farmer, who was also
there?  Woodhull. 

RICHARD
Another question may be, what was
Captain Joyce doing out of his barrack
in the middle of the night?

HEWLETT
Thank you, Judge, but this is a
military matter.  You may return to
your duties. 

Richard nods respectfully, fits his hat on his head and walks
away.  We TRACK WITH him, as he grows worried - knowing that
Abe is nowhere to be found at the moment.  

Hewlett turns to Simcoe.  

HEWLETT (CONT'D)
Captain Simcoe, any suspicious persons
are to be brought directly to me. 
Is that clear?

SIMCOE
Captain...?

HEWLETT
Unless you wish to remain Subaltern.
(nods to Joyce's corpse)
There is a vacancy.

SIMCOE
Yes, Sir.  

Hewlett mounts his horse.  Simcoe stares down at Joyce.


Abe waits for nightfall, chewing on a piece of contraband
cheese.  He watches the sun dip behind the horizon.

Abe gets up and begins to unmoor his sailing scow.


Abe runs the Sound, the only sound is the water splashing
against his hull.

He spots a shape out on the water.  Dark.  Hulking.  A SLOOP.  
Sails snapping in the night.28.

Abe swallows and turns his tiller slightly, tacking to the
dark and silent shore.

The Sloop is moving the other direction.   Hundreds of yards
away.  Passing like, well, ships in the night.

And then it is fully past him.  Abe exhales.

And then it begins to turn.  Shit.

Abe heads into the wind and trims the sail to try and catch
some speed.  But the bigger boat is gaining, quickly, aiming
straight on his stern.

A sound on the wind... a yell... faint... Abe ignores it.

A SPARK from the Sloop.  CRACK!  A HOLE is punched in Abe's
sail.  It begins to luff like crazy.  

The armed Sloop pulls up next to him, its hull knocking his
with bullying confidence.  A LANTERN on board backlights
THREE MEN pointing muskets down at him.

ABE
I'm not armed!

MEN
Identify yourself.

ABE
Abraham Woodhull.  From Setauket.

MEN
Nice night for a sail, Woodhull?

ABE
I thought so...

MEN
What's under the tarp.

Abe hesitates.  Knows he is screwed.  Fuck it.

ABE
Can I interest you gentlemen in a
bolt of silk?  

They throw him a rough rope.

MEN
Yer under arrest, by order of the
Continental Congress.  Charge is
illegal trade. 

Abe has run straight into the Continentals. 29.


The largest estate in town.  A plantation surrounds a colonial
manor house, which has been converted into soldier's barracks.

A REDCOAT rides his horse up the path to the manor.


A giant black KETTLE boils with soap.  Anna Strong pulls
some soaking shirts out of it, doing laundry.  

In a series of CUTS, she lays the shirts out on a long wooden
table.  She takes a washing stick (like a cricket bat) and
begins to beat the laundry on the board.  Anna is all
business.  No emotion.

What begins as a rhythmic beating becomes more intense as
she pounds the stains out.  She grits her teeth, pouring her
anger into the task.  THWACK THWACK THWACK THWACK.  

We hear a voice from somewhere, but it's not clear.  We are
close on Anna's face, as she fights back tears while beating
the hell out of Selah's clothes.  THWACK THWACK THWACK.  

SIMCOE (O.S.)
Mrs. Strong!

Anna turns, startled, to see SIMCOE standing there.   She
tries to catch her breath, bat the tear off her cheek.

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
Are you alright?  

ANNA
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, I didn't hear
you.  

SIMCOE
Captain.
(off her look)
I've purchased Captain Joyce's
commission, in the wake of his death.

ANNA
Death?

SIMCOE
His body was found this morning, on
the Lewis property, with his throat
slit.  

Shock, confusion, and relief course through her in waves.  
Simcoe catches every note.30.

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
You haven't heard?   

She sets the laundry bat down.  

ANNA
I... I was here, in my bed.  Where
else would I be?

SIMCOE
Have you seen Abraham Woodhull? 

ANNA
What?  No... not since the tavern. 
Why are you asking me this?

SIMCOE
An officer in his majesty's army is
dead, following an altercation with
your husband and Mr. Woodhull, and
Mr. Woodhull is nowhere to be found.

Anna stares at him, trying to process this.  Selah gone to
prison.  Joyce murdered.  Abe vanished. The implications
overwhelm her.

She turns away, begins to break down.  Simcoe fidgets.

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
Ma'am, I meant no...

She waves her pardon, and moves to retreat to her house.  He
stops her.

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
Wait.  Accept my apology.

Still choking up, she nods her assent but still tries to
move past.  He stops her again, tight grip on her arm.

Simcoe is close to her now, intimate.  She looks down, keeping
her eyes on the grass.

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
I didn't mean to...
(beat)
I know how you must feel.  With your
husband gone.  In your house alone. 
I can only imagine your distress.

Anna looks up into his eyes.  He is giving her the same
disturbing look that he did at the Tavern.

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
You need someone to protect you. 31.

ANNA
Captain, I beg you.  If you are a
gentleman, let me attend to my house,
in peace.  

He can only press, or let her go.  He lets her go, proving
he is a gentleman, and hating every second of it. 

ANNA (CONT'D)
Thank you.  

She heads off.  Simcoe is now cold. 

SIMCOE
I shall have my laundry ready for
you at week's end.  

Anna stops.  Turns back to look at him, confused.

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
This is my house, too.  I'm to be
quartered here by order of Major
Hewlett.  I have already chosen which
room. 

His tone is flat.  Inevitable.  If he added "and no one will
hear you scream" we wouldn't be thrown.  He nods formally,
then walks off.  Anna watches him go, shaken.  


Abe lands his boat, splashes out.  Looks down at his
clothes... and then SUBMERGES himself under the water.

A beat later, ABE EMERGES from the cold water, soaked through.

TIME CUT TO:

ABE feverishly digs a hole in the sand near the reeds, drops
his MONEY SACK in there, and begins to cover it up again.  

Abe then pulls off his boot, stuffs the shimmering bolt of
silk into it, struggles to pull it back on.  

He stands, shivering from the cold water, working up his
courage.  What the hell is he doing?    

Abe pulls out his knife, grits his teeth, makes a tentative
CUT into his forehead.  Blood runs down.  He winces.  Holding
his hand to the cut.  


Will Robeson, the Tory farmer, walks through the village
with a net of clams over his shoulder.  He slows as he sees-

Abe Woodhull limping up the way.  Soaked, bleeding, fucked
up.  And he leans into it, acting dazed.   

ABE
Robeson... help... 

Robeson's eyes go wide, and he backs up, turns and RUNS.  

Abe hesitates for a moment, doubting.  That wasn't the
reaction he expected.

He keeps walking, rounds a building, and sees Robeson leading
a brace of REDCOATS his way, Simcoe among them.  Robeson
excitedly points to Abe.  The Soldiers hustle toward him. 

SIMCOE
Stand fast!

Abe sure does, surprised and beginning to panic inside. 
Simcoe walks up to him.  

ABE
I... I've been mugged...

Simcoe slams Abe against the building.37.

SIMCOE
And now you'll be hanged.  


Simcoe marches Abe out of the fortified Church, and across
the green.  Curious NEIGHBORS mill about with raised eyebrows. 
Simcoe speaks casually to Abe.

SIMCOE
Very clever, but all really you did
back there was prove you're a
criminal.  

ABE
Pardon?

SIMCOE
Just 'cause you confess to smuggling
doesn't give you an alibi for Joyce.

ABE
I've never killed anyone.41.

SIMCOE
I have.  Plenty just like you.  May
have fooled the Major, but not me.  

Simcoe stops, and lets Abe walk on.  Louder, for everyone
else, he call out...

SIMCOE (CONT'D)
Travel safe.

STAY with Abe as he walks on, his desperate mood now matched
to his ragged appearance.  


STRONG MANOR as seen from the shimmering water of the Long
Island Sound.  The brilliant white colonial home looks
peaceful and private at this distance.  

Several colorful lines of laundry in the back lawn bob in
the wind off the bay.


Abe hides in the trees ringing the perimeter of the vast
estate.  He watches a Soldier heading for the ice house, a
small octagonal shed on the manor grounds.  It's a hot day.

Abe finally spots Anna.  She is too far away to signal or
yell to without attracting attention.  He watches her for a
moment, as she scoops water from the ewer and splashes her
face.  The Soldier enters the ice house.  

Abe cups his hands over his mouth, and mimics a raven call.

Anna slows, then stops, wondering if she heard what she did. 
Abe smiles to himself, does it again.

She turns, knows exactly where to find him.  He keeps his
eye on the ice house as she crosses the grounds to the trees. 
She finds him in the thicket underneath the tree shadows.

ANNA
What are you doing here?

ABE
Giving you this. 

He presses the purse into her hands.  It's dirty from where
he dug it up.  She looks inside, gasps.

ABE (CONT'D)
It's what I owe Selah.  You could
use it to buy his parole.  I have to
go.  42.

ANNA
Wait.  I can't take this.  

ABE
Yes, you can.  

ANNA
I can't take this, he'll find it!  

He's halfway gone.  He turns back.

ABE
Who?

ANNA
Simcoe.  The Welshman.  The one who
put a pistol to your head.

Abe begins to nod.  He knows him.  Too well.  

ANNA (CONT'D)
He's been billeted here, and...

ABE
What's he done to you?

ANNA
He... I can hear him outside my door
at night.  And he's been in my room
when I haven't, I'm certain of it. 
If he finds I'm hiding silver you
took off a dead soldier, then he--

ABE
Wait... dead Soldier?

Anna searches his eyes.  Abe registers what she's thinking. 

ABE (CONT'D)
Anna you don't think I killed Captain
Joyce?
(she doesn't answer)
Also, what soldier do you know carries
twelve quid on his person? 

ANNA
None.  And no farmer, either.  Where
did you get it?    

He looks at her for a long beat.  

ABE
Caleb Brewster is running a shop out
of his whaleboat, on Devil's Belt.43.

ANNA
Caleb?  
(her face lights up)
You saw him?  How is he?  

ABE
Giant.  Crude.  The same.
(beat)
I saw Ben Tallmadge, too.  

The truth comes as a relief to him.  Anna is excited.  

ANNA
They were together?

ABE
No.  No, Ben's a Connecticut Dragoon
now.  Shiny helmet and all.  Tried
to recruit me for a secret mission.  

ANNA
Against the British?

ABE
Don't worry, I won't do it.  

ANNA
Why not?

That takes him by surprise.  Anna presses, quietly outraged. 

ANNA (CONT'D)
What are you waiting for?  What more
do they need to take from us?  

The "us" is raw, intimate.  Abe stares at her.  THUNK-

The Soldier exits the ice house, cold wisping out after him.  

Abe presses the money back into her hands.  Then quickly
darts out the way he crept in.

Anna watches him go, then looks down at the money purse. 
Biting down on her anger, she finds a hollow in the tree and
stuffs it in there to conceal it.  


A Two Story Colonial.  Candles flicker in the windows.  TWO
REDCOATS stand guard outside the front door.   


Abe trudges down the porch steps under watch of the Redcoat
Guards.  We can still see the dining room, lit up.  

Abe shuffles down the path into darkness.  When he is farther
down the path, he straightens up - not sick at all - and
darts to the side, keeping low, and circles around the back
of the house.  


Abe creeps to the side of his Father's house, below the
windows.  He feels along the house, as if from memory, and
finds a loose sideboard.  He pries it back a bit, and removes
a rusted old CALIPER TOOL.  

He smiles.  Hasn't had to use this since he was fourteen.

Abe approaches a dark window, and uses the Caliper to access
a well-worn hole just below the latch.  

If there's one place Abe has experience breaking in and out
of - it's his old childhood bedroom.  He slides up the sash,
stashes the Caliper, and climbs in the house.   


Abe is a shadow RUNNING through the trees, a mirror to Ben
Tallmadge's run from the opening.  His breathing fades UNDER-

As we hear a drunken chant RISE:

REDCOATS (V.O. PRE-LAP)
Don t want the Sergeant s shilling,
Don t want to be shot down / I m
really much more willing / to make
myself a killing... 


CLOSE ON A BLACK PETTICOAT being pegged to the laundry line.  

Anna looks out to the water, squinting, as she pins up four
WHITE LINEN HANDKERCHIEFS on the line next to it.  

ANGLE ON A MAID

ABIGAIL, watching her from the porch, troubled.  CICERO, a
House Boy, steps next to her, curious.  

CICERO
'She doin'...?

Abigail's concern begins to slide into suspicion.  


Abe works his field.  The sun is hot, but the full moon still
hangs in the blue sky.  Abe stares at it.51.

Behind him, Mary exits the porch door, sets a bowl on a bench,
and walks back in, giving a quick tug on the cast iron dinner
bell as she goes, pointedly never looking at Abe.  

He turns at the CLANG, in time to see her enter the house.  

MOMENTS LATER - Abe picks up his supper.  Cold cornmeal mush.


Abe stealths down to the shore, stops when he sees...

A familiar WHALEBOAT pulled into the reeds.  Empty.

Abe recognizes it, surprised.  Then confused.  Then angry. 
He quickly pulls his hop knife, WHIRLS to face--

CALEB BREWSTER sneaking up on him, with a cheshire grin.

CALEB
Quicker this time.  

ABE
You.  You're the courier?! 52.

CALEB
Lower that butter knife, will ya?  

ABE
Did... did Tallmadge catch you?  How
did he find you?  

CALEB
He didn't find me.  We found you.  

Abe stares at him, mind racing.  

ABE
Back at Frog's point...

CALEB
That was the first interview.  Second
was Ben's.  You passed muster when
you refused to give up my name. 
Just want you to know I was touched
by that. 

ABE
You set me up?  You're a... you're a
devil.  A liar, a--

CALEB
Lieutenant.  Second Continental
Artillery, assigned to Captain
Tallmadge for special detail. 
(steps closer, menacing)
Who the hell are you?  

ABE
Someone tricked, now expected to
trust.

CALEB
Whatever you give me goes straight
to Ben.  No one else knows your name. 
No one.  

ABE
Or hers.

CALEB
Of course.  Now she hung out that
Petticoat for a reason.  What?

ABE
A detachment's being readied, to
strike a safe house on Meeg's Harbor. 
Kensington's farm.

Caleb nods, blood pumping. 53.

CALEB
When.  

ABE
Tomorrow.  There was a dispatch,
from York Island, signed by a Major
Andre.  

CALEB
Anything else?

ABE
The man leading it is Simcoe. 
Captain.  I think he suspects me. 

CALEB
Simcoe.  I'll keep an eye out.
(grins)
Trust me, Woody.  Once you get a
taste for boiling these lobsters,
you'll want more.  

ABE
Don't call me that.  

CALEB
An' after I pass this up the ladder,
they'll want more.  Washington's
been trying to get a man inside the
city since Clinton took it over.  

ABE
He'll have to find someone else.  I
don't have any business that would
take me to the city.  

CALEB
Then maybe you make some.  

ABE
This is a one-time deal.

Caleb smiles.

CALEB
Just like the last time. 

Caleb hops into his boat.  Pushes off.    

Abe stands there for a moment, watching him disappear.  Then
turns back and heads into the reeds.  

END ACT FOUR54.

ACT FIVE


A SMALL CROWD is gathered near the Church, and the Stockade,
to witness Abe swear his oath of allegiance.  MAJOR HEWLETT
and FIVE REGULARS are the only military presence.  Mary is
dressed up, and holds Thomas in her arms.  Will Robeson
watches, and Judge Woodhull administers the oath to his son.    

Abe puts his hand on his father's bible. 

ABE
I, Abraham Woodhull, do sincerely
and faithfully promise and swear
that I will bear true allegiance to
His Majesty King George the Third.


A WOOD HOUSE sits back in trees, hidden from view.  

ABE (V.O.)
And that with heart and hands, life
and goods... 

SIMCOE leads a detachment of 30 REDCOATS through the trees,
quietly.  He gives them the sign to drop into firing position.  

ABE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...Maintain and defend His Majesty's
Government.

The first line takes a knee.


Abe's eyes wander to the left, making contact with ANNA in
the back of the crowd.  

ABE
And the laws of the Province of New
York...

Mary follows his look to her.  

SIMCOE (V.O.)
FIRE!

IN CONNECTICUT - a volley EXPLODES out.  Shattering windows
and blasting the hell out of the building.   

The front line primes and loads while the back advances -
and waits to let loose ANOTHER burst.55.

ABE (V.O.)
Against all traitorous conspiracies
and attempts... 

Both units CHARGE toward the house.  An ENSIGN kicks in the
front door... it's EMPTY.  

ABE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
..Which shall be made against his
person, Crown or Dignity.

BOOM!  MUZZLE FLASHES light up the trees all around them.    
Several Regulars FALL, caught in an AMBUSH. 

Redcoats scramble and die in the CROSSFIRE.  Simcoe PULLS
HIS SWORD.

BEN TALLMADGE leads his Dragoons and some Connecticut Militia
including CALEB in a charge out of their hiding spots. 

They engage the Redcoats at point blank range, FIRING pistols
and STABBING with bayonets.  It's a slaughter.

ABE  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And I will do my utmost endeavor to
disclose and make known to His Majesty
and his Successors...


ABE 
All treasons, and traitorous
conspiracies, which I shall know to
be against, or any of them.

Richard looks on his son with grave, official scrutiny.  


Powder smoke in the air.  Dead King's Men litter the ground.  

SIMCOE, shot in the stomach and knee, pulls himself on his
belly.  His new "Captain" epaulette dangling off the uniform. 
A pair of muddy boots stop in front of him.  

CALEB (O.S.)
Captn' Simcoe?

He looks up to see Caleb looming over him.  Pistol leveled.   

CALEB (CONT'D)
Abe Woodhull says hello. 

Caleb's SHOT echoes through the trees.  56.


ABE
God save the King. 

The neighbors give cheers.  Some are half-hearted.  Robeson,
staring at Abe, turns and quickly walks away.


The Continentals search the dead.  Caleb approaches Ben, who
still looks like he's in a rage.     

BEN
Regulars. 

CALEB
Just like we expected. 

BEN
Thought they might send Rangers to
link up with 'em.  Was hoping for
Rogers.   

CALEB
We'll get him soon enough.  

Ben looks at Caleb, nods.  Then reaches into his shirt and
takes the RANGER BONNET out.  Tosses it on Simcoe's corpse.

CALEB (CONT'D)
What's that for? 

BEN
Send my regards. 

Ben walks off.  Caleb looks down.  PUSH IN on the green woolen
Ranger Bonnet on Simcoe's chest...


Cicadas sing as Abe drives a wagon back to his farm, with
Mary, Thomas, and Richard in the wagon seat.  

MARY
I thought you presented yourself
well.

Abe looks at his wife, surprised.  An olive branch?

ABE
Thank you.  I thought Thomas did
well. 57.

RICHARD
Not so much as a peep.  

ABE
That's my boy. 

MARY
Well, there was everyone quiet while
you went ahead and said more than
two words.
(hugging Thomas)
He likes to listen to his father.  

RICHARD
A lost art.

Abe shakes his head, as they bump around the bend... 


Where they are confronted by a horrific sight: his cabbage
field TRAMPLED by someone (or a group of someones). 

ABE
What... what...

RICHARD
Dear God.

Abe yanks the reigns.  The horse stops.  Abe hops off and
runs into the rows of sabotaged crop.  The entire crop.

MARY
Abraham!  Abraham! 

Mary is in a panic, running toward Abe, holding Thomas.

MARY (CONT'D)
What happened?  Why is this happening?

ABE
Mary, go inside.

MARY
No!  This is... everything!

She spins to take in the field, then turns back too fast. 
Thomas begins to cry.  Abe steadies her, then grabs Thomas
gently into his arms.  

ABE
Go inside and wait for me.  Now!

Mary suddenly imagines inside and then picks up her dress
and runs for her house.  58.

Abe calms Thomas down.  Richard slowly approaches.

ABE (CONT'D)
Two... three, maybe four horses. 
Must have taken them at least a half
an hour.

RICHARD
While we were in town. 

ABE
Who.  Who did this?

RICHARD
(quiet)
You did.  

Abe turns to Richard in disbelief.  Richard is ice.

RICHARD (CONT'D)
You brought this on yourself.  Many
around here don't trust you. 

Abe carefully sets Thomas down on the soft soil.  

RICHARD (CONT'D)
I know you lied.  To Major Hewlett. 
In my house.  In front of me.  Do
you think I don't know my own son?  

Abe is speechless.  JUDGE Woodhull peers at him. 

RICHARD (CONT'D)
Why did you give those names?  There
are no boys down in Hempstead with
those names.  Tell the truth.

ABE
Father...

RICHARD
Did you kill Joyce?

ABE
No!

RICHARD
Tell the truth!

ABE
I kept the money!

Richard stares.  Abe lies with the truth.59.

ABE (CONT'D)
There was no arrest by rebels.  I
cut my own scar.  I buried the silver
by the shore, and used the silk to
sell my story.  

RICHARD
You thought the Major would take
your profit...

ABE
The way he took your house.   

RICHARD
I invited him to billet-

ABE
Under threat of law.

RICHARD
Where is your take now?  Eh?

Abe steps toward him.  Richard steps back.  

ABE
With Anna Strong.  I used it to pay
my debt, that's why I went.  

Richard searches Abe's eyes.  Sees truth there.  He's furious.

RICHARD
I thought we decided you would stay
away from-

ABE
I never decided.  You decided for
me.  

RICHARD
You're a grown man, you can make
your own decisions.
(then)
But you are also my son and I will
always tell you what I think is right. 
And what is right... now... is we
return the proceeds to Hewlett.  

ABE
No.

RICHARD
Son, I have protected you up to this
point.  I will not go any further.   60.

Abe nods.  He looks around - too much to risk, too much to
lose, too much already lost.  He slowly settles to the ground,
forearms on his knees.

Richard feels both sympathetic, and satisfied.  He resumes a
wise, encouraging tone.   

RICHARD (CONT'D)
No matter how dark the night, God
grants each of us the chance to begin
anew, every day.
(beat)
It's not too late for you, Abraham.  

Abe picks up a leaf of uprooted cabbage.  Maybe he's right. 
Maybe it's time to make a choice.    

ABE
Your butcher stores.  In the city. 
You still need someone to run product
to them?    

Richard nods.  Glad that Abe has made the right decision,
not knowing that Abe has taken a step against the cause his
Father believes in. 

Richard steps up behind Abe, and puts a hand on his shoulder.  

Abe feels the low ache of betrayal in the pit of his stomach.

At that moment, THOMAS STANDS UP, wobbly.  Abe doesn't see
him.  Thomas takes his first steps - one, two, three... and
puts his tiny hand on Abe's other shoulder.  

Richard and Abe look at Thomas.  

Both Woodhulls smile at the same time. 

FADE OUT.

                       END OF SHOW
