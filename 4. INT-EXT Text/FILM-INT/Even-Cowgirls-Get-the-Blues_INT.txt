There is a huge ancient hourglass made of animal skins, and
acorns plop through the waist of the hourglass one by one.
It sits in a pool of water. In the water swim EYELESS CATFISH
in geometric patterns. An underground stream feeds the pool
of water and then flows into a huge underground crevasse
that on occasion emits a LOW RUMBLE.
INDIANS with torches surround the hourglass, which now we
can see is in a cave. And as soon as the acorns have finished
passing through the hourglass, a crew of Indians turn it on
its opposite end. One of the Indians appears to be JAPANESE.
ONE INDIAN stands at the wall of the cavern in front of a
series of symbolic carvings and scratches, with stone in
hand he makes a few hatchmarks, and keeps an eye on the
CREVASSE.
THE CREVASSE RUMBLES once more, loosening a few chunks of
rock from the cave.
The earth begins to shake.
THE CHART KEEPER
She is restless tonight.
ANOTHER INDIAN
She dreams of loving.
STILL ANOTHER
She has the blues.
View of the chartkeeper's drawings. One is of a crane with a
very long neck. Another is a primitive drawing of a naked
girl, who has long flowing hair. She also has, pointed out
from her sides, thumbs that are three times normal human
proportions. A MUSICAL CHORUS sounds at the sight of this
drawing of a girl with the thumbs. The chartkeeper puts the
finishing touches on the drawing.
And the song "Happy Birthday to You" strikes up on country
and western guitar and polka-like accordion. title
BIG THUMBS
We see CANDLES burning on a cake. It is somebody's birthday.
And there are six candles on the cake.
SISSY HANKSHAW is six years old.
Her DADDY and a visiting UNCLE, finishing their rendition of
Happy Birthday, are staring down at Sissy and looking at her
young THUMBS, WHICH ARE UNUSUALLY LARGE and twitch with a
mind of their own.
She manages to blow out all six candles.
UNCLE
Well, you're lucky that you don't
suck 'em.
DADDY
Sissy couldn't suck 'em, she'd need
a mouth like a fish tank.
Sissy is negotiating a fork full of birthday cake, dropping
it because of her thumbs.
UNCLE
(agrees)
The poor little tyke might have a
hard time finding herself a hubby.
But as far as getting along in the
world, it's a real blessing that
Sissy's a girl-child. Lord, I reckon
this youngun would never make a
mechanic.
DADDY
Nope, and not a brain surgeon,
neither.
UNCLE
Course she'd do pretty good as a
butcher. She could retire in two
years on the overcharges alone.
Laughing, the men walk to the kitchen to fill their glasses.
Sissy is left to feel sorry for herself in front of her cake.
UNCLE (O.S.)
One thing, that youngun would make
one hell of a hitchhiker...
This startles Sissy. A new word that tinkles in her head
with a supernatural echo. Sissy looks at her thumbs.
UNCLE (O.S.)
...if she was a boy, I mean.
Dr. Dreyfus looks over Sissy's thumbs.
DR. DREYFUS
She is, if I may speak frankly,
somewhat of a medical oddity. Due to
impaired dexterity, her life
activities and career potentialities
will be reduced. It could be worse.
Bring her back to me if there ever
is pain. Meanwhile, she will have to
learn to live with them.
MRS. HANKSHAW
That she will. That she will. The
Lord made them things big for a
purpose. God don't never git tired
of testing our kind. It's a punishment
of some sort, for what I don't rightly
know.
(whimpering)
Oh Doc, if a young man ever shows up
here with, a young man with ugly
fingers, you know, something similar,
a similar case, Doc, would you
please...
DR. DREYFUS
Remember the words of the painter
Paul Gauguin, dear lady. "The ugly
may be beautiful, the pretty never."
I don't suppose that means very much
to you.
MRS. HANKSHAW
It's a judgement. She's gotta bear
the punishment.
Sissy beams serenely like a Christ figure.
Sissy looks up "thumb" in the dictionary. It says: the short,
thick first or most preaxial digit of the human hand,
differing from the other fingers by having two phalanges and
greater freedom of movement.
Sissy mouthing the words: "Greater freedom of movement."
The man driving looks over the back seat to the hitchiker
behind him.
The bus driver does the same.
Sissy ventures into her pocket and pulls out a slice of cheese
and offers it to him. He now gets a better look at her unusual
thumbs. They are elegant, but large boned, and
disproportionate. They are banana shaped boats that makes it
a little awkward to hold onto the cheese.
MAN
(taking an alarming
interest in her thumbs)
Thanks.
SISSY
American Cheese. The king of road
food.
He eats the cheese, and worries about the thumbs. He tokes
on the joint between his fingers.
MAN
Are you in show business?
SISSY
I was a successful model once.
MAN
For magazines?
SISSY
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene
Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got
laid off.
MAN
So now you're bummin' around?
SISSY
Yep.
MAN
Hitchhiking?
SISSY
I'm the best.
MAN
You're the best?
SISSY
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one
hundred and twenty-seven hours without
stopping, without food or sleep,
crossed the continent twice in six
days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans
and caught rides after midnight on
unlighted highways.
MAN
Whooee!
SISSY
As I developed, however, I grew more
concerned with subtleties and nuances
of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no
longer interested me. I began to
hitchhike in something akin to
geological time: slow, ancient, vast.
When I am really moving, stopping
car after car after car, moving so
freely, so clearly, so delicately
that even the sex maniacs and the
cops can only blink and let me pass,
then I embody the rhythms of the
universe. I am in a state of grace.
The man listening to her takes another toke on his joint.
Sissy at the window picking up some mail, and opening a
lavender colored letter that reeks of perfume, she is
surprised to read this:
Sissy, Precious Being, How are you, my extraordinary one? I
worry so. Next time you are near Manhattan, do ring me up.
There is a man to whom I simply must introduce you. Thrill!!
-The Countess
Sissy looks at the envelope and return address. Elaborately
embossed is the Countess' logo...
The elaborately embossed envelope is now being sealed.. The
Countess gives it a licking... Beside him is a young
watercolorist named Julian.
THE COUNTESS
I will send this out to Sissy, she
should get it in a week, and you
will be able to meet her. When I
send a letter to Sissy, duplicates
must be sent to U.S. Post Office
Boxes in LaConner, Taos, Pine Ridge,
Cherokee and that other place, for
her to pick up... Why she's probably
out there right now in Hibbing,
Minnesota, or Deluth, Montana...
hitching her way across the country.
Sissy is talking to a trucker as they pass down the road.
SISSY
Right off, I don't remember how old
I was when I found out I was part
Indian. My mamma's family, a lot of
them, had lived out West, in the
Dakotas, and one of them had married
a squaw. Siwash tribe. My pleasure
in Indianhood and my passion for car
travel might be incongruous if not
mutually exclusive........ After
all, the first car that ever stopped
for me had been named in honor of
the great chief of the Ottawa:
Pontiac......
In the distance, Sissy spies her destination. NEW YORK CITY.
SISSY
NEW YORK CITY. It's still a helluva
town....
THE COUNTESS
Sit down dear, do sit down.
Sissy Hankshaw takes a seat. The Countess lifts a dusty
decanter.
THE COUNTESS
Take a load off those lovely tootsies.
Yes, sit right down. Would you fancy
some sherry?
The decanter is empty, a stiff fly lies feet up on it's lip.
THE COUNTESS
Shit O goodness, I'm all out of
sherry; how about some Red Ripple?
He reaches into a midget refrigerator beside his desk and
pulls out some pop wine.
THE COUNTESS
You know what Red Ripple is don't
you? It's Kool-Aid with a hard on.
Tee Hee.
Sissy manages a polite smile. She looks at a heavily finger
printed glass.
THE COUNTESS
(he toasts)
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And
welcome. So my letter brought ya
flying, eh? Where were you? Salt
Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may
have a little surprise for you. But
first, tell me about yourself. It's
been six months, hasn't it? In some
circles that's half a year. How are
you?
SISSY
Tired...
THE COUNTESS
That's the very first time in the
eons that I've known you that I've
ever heard you complain. And now
you're tired, poor darling.
SISSY
A born freak can only go uphill.
THE COUNTESS
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks
in one way or another. Try being
born a male Russian countess into a
white middle class Baptist family in
Mississippi and you'll see what I
mean.
SISSY
I've always been proud of the way
nature singled me out. It's the people
who have been deformed by society I
feel sorry for. I've been steady
moving for eleven years and some
months. Maybe I should rest up for a
spell, I'm not as young as I used to
be.
THE COUNTESS
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty
for another year, and you're more
beautiful than ever.
SISSY
Does that mean you might have an
assignment for me?
The Countess taps his monocle with his cigarette holder. He
looks on his wall, and on a poster advertising a feminine
hygene product, Yoni Yum Dew Spray, stands Sissy Hankshaw,
her thumbs neatly hidden, chopped off by the borders of the
photograph.
THE COUNTESS
You were the Yoni Yum girl from,
let's see,
(peruses the ad layouts
on the wall)
from nineteen sixty-eight through
nineteen seventy. You've always
smelled so nice. Like a little sister.
The irony has just killed me. You,
the Dew Girl, one of the few girls
who doesn't need Dew. I loath the
stink of females! They are so sweet
the way God made them, then they
start fooling around with men and
soon they're stinking. Like rotten
mushrooms, like an excessively
chlorinated swimming pool, like a
tuna fish's retirement party. They
all stink. From the Queen of England
to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
SISSY
Bonanza Jellybean?
THE COUNTESS
What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
The Countess's jaw muscles calm down, his dentures ease into
a samba...
THE COUNTESS
She's a young thing who works on my
ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or
something wooden like that. She's
cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of
course, it takes verve to change
one's name so charmingly. But she
stinks like a slut just the same.
SISSY
Your ranch?
THE COUNTESS
Oh my dear yes, I bought a little
ranch out West, sort of a tribute to
the women of America who have
cooperated with me in eliminating
their odor by using my vaginal
products, Dew spray mist and Yoni
Yum spray powder. A tax write-off,
actually.
He looks out his window as a squirrel crosses Park Avenue.
THE COUNTESS
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you
can desist from wearing paths in
those forgotten highways. The Countess
has arranged a job for you. And what
a job...
SISSY
A job for me?
THE COUNTESS
I am once more about to make
advertising history. And only you,
the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could
possibly assist me.
The Countess hands Sissy an article that she reads clenched
in her fist.
SISSY
The Food and Drug Administration
said Wednesday female deodorant sprays
may cause such harmful reactions as
blisters, burns and rashes. Although
the FDA judges that the reported
reactions are not sufficient to
justify removal of these products
from the market, they are sufficient
to warrant the proposed mandatory
label warnings.
THE COUNTESS
Shit O dear, that's enough to make
me asthmatic. The nerve of those
twits. What do they know about female
odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my
concept. My ranch out West? It's a
beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few
head of cattle for atmosphere and
tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch,
a place where unhappy women --
divorcees and widows, mainly -- can
go to lose weight, remove wrinkles,
change their hair styles and pretty
themselves up for the next
disappointment. My ranch is named
the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber
Rose douche bag, my own invention,
and bless its little red bladder,
the most popular douche bag in the
world. So get this. It's on the
migratory flight path of the whooping
cranes. The last flock of wild
whooping cranes left in existence.
Well, these cranes stop off at my
little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's
called -- twice a year, autumn and
spring, and spend a few days each
time, resting up, eating, doing
whatever whooping cranes do. I've
never seen them, understand, but I
hear they're magnificent. Very big
specimens -- I mean, huge mothers --
and white as snow, to coin a phrase,
except for black tips on their wings
and tail feathers, and bright red
heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case
you didn't know it, are noted for
their mating dance. It's just the
wildest show in nature.
It's probably the reason why
birdwatching used to be so popular
with old maids and deacons. Picture
these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds
in full dance -- leaping six feet
off the mud, arching their backs,
flapping their wings, strutting low
to the ground. Dears, it's
overwhelming. And picture the birds
doing their sex dance on TV. Right
there on the home screen, creation's
most elaborate sex ritual -- yet
clean and pure enough to suit the
Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in
the foreground. In a white gown, red
hood attached, and big feathery
sleeves trimmed in black. In a very
subdued imitation of the female
whooping crane, she dance/walks over
to a large nest in which there sits
a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew.
Off-camera, a string quartet is
playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is
reading a few poetic lines about
courtship and love. Are you starting
to get it? Doesn't it make the hair
on your neck stand up and applaud?
My very goodness gracious! Grandiose,
lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout-
oriented; you can't top it. I've
hired a crew of experts from Walt
Disney Studios, the best wildlife
cinematographers around. You're my
eternal favorite. Princess Grace
herself couldn't be better, not even
if she had your personality which
she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out
of photography now and into water
colors. Ah how circuitous conversation
is! We're back at the beginning. The
exact man I've wanted you to meet is
my artist the watercolorist.
Sissy dares a sip of Red Ripple.
SISSY
If you don't want me to pose for
him, why do you want me to meet him?
THE COUNTESS
Purely personal. I believe you might
enjoy one another.
SISSY
But Countess...
THE COUNTESS
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I
realize that you've always avoided
all but the most rudimentary
involvements with men, and I might
add, you've been wise. Heterosexual
relationships seem to lead only to
marriage. For men, marriage is a
matter of efficient logistics: The
male gets his food, bed, laundry,
TV, pussy, offspring and creature
comforts all under one roof, where
he doesn't have to dissipate his
psychic energy thinking about them
too much, then he is free to go out
and fight the battles of life, which
is what existence is all about. But
for a woman marriage is surrender.
The Countess refills his glass. The squirrel starts across
Park Avenue again but doesn't make it. The uniformed chauffeur
gets out of a limousine and holds the crushed animal up where
it can be seen by an elderly woman passenger.
THE COUNTESS
But here you are, still a virgin --
you are virginal yet, aren't you?
SISSY
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac
and I came awfully close, but he was
afraid of me, I think...
THE COUNTESS
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is
that there comes a time when it is
psychologically impossible for a
woman to lose her virginity. She
can't wait too long, you know. Now,
there's no reason why you must lose
yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit,
that's all.
SISSY
(her brow spaghettied)
What makes you think this
watercolorist and I would develop a
romantic relationship?
THE COUNTESS
I can't be certain that you would.
But what have you got to lose?
SISSY
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see
the point in it, but I'll try it.
Just for you. It's kind of silly,
actually, me going out with an artist
in New York City. However...
THE COUNTESS
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it,
you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
Suddenly the Countess swivels in his desk chair and leans
forward. Lowering his wine glass, he focuses directly,
intensely into Sissy's blue eyes. His smile widens.
THE COUNTESS
By the way, Sissy... he's a full
blooded Indian.
A title:
COWGIRL INTERLUDE
The Outhouse Radio is playing "The Starving Armenians Polka"
and Bonanza Jellybean and Delores del Ruby are in the privy,
caught in the rain.
JELLY
Well, I'm not scared of a little
rain.
DELORES
Me neither.
JELLY
Might as well brave it.
DELORES
Right. I don't know about you but
I'm sure not sweet enough to melt.
Delores flicks her whip at a sweat bee that has taken refuge
in the privy and hits the photograph of Dale Evans upon which
it has lit.
Jelly looks out the door of the outhouse across a cut green
lawn to a bunkhouse where we can see a gathering of other
cowgirls.
There is a fly buzz and a distant polka yip. Way off horse
lips flutter.
Bonanza spies a picture of Sissy Hankshaw, an advertisement
for Yoni Yum Dew Spray mist, on the privy wall.
JELLY
(musing)
Someday...... if that Sissy Hankshaw
ever shows up here, I'm gonna teach
her how to hypnotize a chicken.
Chickens are the easiest critters on
Earth to hypnotize. If you can look
a chicken in the eyes for tens
seconds, it's yours forever.
A meeting is in progression in the bunkhouse that morning.
Mary is addressing the group.
MARY
I want to complain that some of the
cowgirls have been sleeping two to a
bunk again, in violation of the
agreement that "crimes against nature"
are to be confined to the hayloft.
DEBBIE
I don't care who lay with whom or
where or how, but the moaners,
groaners and screamers ought to turn
down their volume when others are
trying to sleep or meditate.
Some of the younger cowgirls blush.
BIG RED
I want to complain about the food
around here! It's rotten to the core.
A round of support from the other cowgirls in the form of
cattle calls.
Jelly and Delores are getting ready to run through the rain,
when all of a sudden, Jelly spies a barefoot cowgirl -- it's
Debbie -- run across the yard in her karate robe, jump on
the Exercycle that is rusting in the weeds and begin pumping
the pedals furiously in the yammering rain.
DELORES
My sacred crocodile! She's flipped.
But in a minute, others follow Debbie, everyone of them, in
fact; the entire bunkhouse load of them, some thirty young
cowgirls, squealing, giggling, They slide and roll on the
wet grass, push each other into the mud that is forming by
the corral fence, chase one another in and out of the thick
folds of rain draperies, stamp their cute feet in puddles
and do bellyflops into the overflowing horse trough.
The cowgirls frolic until, as suddenly as it has come, the
rain goes away. Play ceases. They are panting like puppies
as they lean against one another or pick clods of mud from
one another's hair.
ELAINE
I move that the meeting be adjourned.
DEBBIE
At the end of the endless game, there
is friendship.
HEATHER
What the heck did she mean by that!
JELLY
Just that in Heaven all business is
conducted this way.
In the lobby, the doors of an elevator open revealing Sissy
inside wearing a buttoned up dress. Very formal looking for
her.
There is Julian standing in the lobby. He turns and walks
toward Sissy. He is wearing a rather formal looking plaid
sport coat with blue cummerbund. He extends his hand to meet
her, and (perhaps at the sight of Sissy's thumbs) Julian has
an asthma attack, doubling over in front of her.
Sissy doesn't know whether to assist Julian or flee.
From the other side of the lobby, two WELL-GROOMED COUPLES,
white, mid-thirties and upper middle class come to the rescue.
The younger of the men, RUPERT, takes charge. He breaks an
inhaler of dinephrine under Julian's nose.
RUPERT
We'd better take you home.
In the red of embarrassment, Julian looks more Indian than
he had previously. Wheezing, he speaks:
JULIAN
I beg your pardon. I've been
enthralled with your photographs for
years. When the Countess hinted that
you might like to meet me -- he never
explained why -- I was ready to paint
for him free of charge. And now I
had to go and spoil it.
Carla starts to pat Sissy's hand, then decides to leave the
thumbs to themselves.
The six of them are squeezed into the taxi. Sissy looks out
the window of the taxi:
SISSY'S VIEW as the taxi stops at a light, she can see a
newsstand headline on the front page of the New York Daily
News:
THE CHINK SUMS IT UP, SAYS LIFE IS HARD IF YOU THINK IT'S
HARD.
INSIDE Howard mixes Scotch and sodas, Rupert fills a syringe
from a vial of aminophylline he has taken from its place
behind a gelatin salad mold in the refrigerator. He gives
Julian an injection.
RUPERT
There, that ought to beat them
bronchial buggers into submission.
He turns to Sissy.
RUPERT
I was a medic in the Army. I really
should have become a doctor.
Sometimes, though, I feel that pushing
books is a whole lot like pushing
medicine. Think of books as pills. I
have pills that cure ignorance and
pills that cure boredom. I have pills
to elevate moods and pills to open
people's eyes to the awful truth...
CARLA
Too bad you don't have a pill for
bullshit.
Carla smiles as if she were joking, but she'd said it tartly.
Rupert glares and takes a big bite of Scotch.
HOWARD
(changing the subject)
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
SISSY
I'm staying with the Countess.
HOWARD
I know, but where do you reside when
you aren't visiting New York?
SISSY
I don't.
HOWARD
You don't?
SISSY
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in
particular. I just keep moving.
Everyone looks a bit astonished including the recumbent
Julian.
HOWARD
A traveler, eh?
SISSY
You might say that, although I don't
think of it as traveling.
CARLA
How do you think of it?
SISSY
As moving.
CARLA
Oh.
MARIE
How... unusual...
HOWARD
Mmmmm...
Rupert bites into his Scotch again. Julian issues a watery
wheeze. Then, silence.
CARLA
Rupert, before you get too engrossed
in your research on Scotch as a cure
for aging, don't you think you'd
better phone Elaine's and cancel our
dinner reservations?
Sissy leaves her chair and wanders about the apartment. Which
is full of books and shelves.
RUPERT (O.S.)
What would we do without you, Carla?
Without our little efficiency expert,
Carla, everything would just go to
hell. Carla is thinking about running
for mayor next year, aren't you,
Carla?
CARLA (O.S.)
Up yours, Herr Doktor Book Salesman.
Will the demands of your medical
practice allow you to call Elaine's
or shall I?
MARIE (O.S.)
Oh let me do it.
Sissy is intrigued by an antique here and an object d'art
there, but she knows she is in an alien environment.
Sissy enters a bedroom There is a covered birdcage. She sits
upon the bed listening for a 'cheep' from the birds.
And gradually she reclines. Then turning her head to the
side against the bedspread:
SISSY
No Indian blankets... no Indian
blankets...
And she blacks out. And the sound drifts away in waves, so
there is only the whistle of a distant wind through the mortar
of the apartment building...
...Until one by one, we see button necks freed. Soon Sissy
can feel it.
Someone is undressing her. In a voice webby with sleep she
lifts her head up, and sees Howard and Marie.
SISSY
Where are the others?
HOWARD
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little
hassle and went home.
MARIE
Julian fell asleep on the couch; we
covered him up.
HOWARD
We thought that we should make you
comfortable too.
Sissy thinks this is nice, but wonders, however, why they
are both in their underwear.
SISSY
Yes, thanks...
Between the two of them, they have gotten Sissy out of her
dress in no time. Sissy feels she should apologize for not
having on a brassiere.
Marie slips out of her own brassiere and moves her bare bosom
close to Sissy's.
MARIE
Mine are fuller but yours are more
perfectly shaped.
HOWARD
Highly debatable. I'll wager they're
the exact same size.
Howard cups his left hand about a Marie breast and his right
about one of Sissy's. He weighs them in his palms, squeezes
them the way an honest grocer squeezes excess water from a
lettuce, and spreads his fingers to sample their
circumference.
HOWARD
Hmm. Yours are larger, Marie, but
Miss Hankshaw's -- Sissy's -- are
more firm. You'd think they would
have started to droop; I mean, from
not wearing a bra.
MARIE
Howard! Watch your manners. You've
made her blush. Here, Sissy, let me
compare.
Marie seizes Sissy's free breast, quickly, like a monkey
picking a fruit, rolling it about in her hungry little finger,
rubbing it against her chin and cheeks...
...and...
...it was like her earlier days as a hitchhiker....
nostalgic..... tropical plums.
SISSY
(in ecstasy)
This place is finer than the place I
live!
Like a disc jockey from Paradise, Howard flips Marie over
and plays her B side. Every now and then she reaches for
Sissy to include her, but the laws of physics insist on being
obeyed.
Over and over Marie calls Sissy's name with half-closed eyes.
The Barths are really going at it, Marie yowling like a cat.
The POODLE in the kitchen begins to growl.
SISSY
So this is what it's like... so this
is what it's really like.
Sissy bounces out of the bed and patters through the living
room and crawls under the cover with Julian. Julian stirs
awake.
JULIAN
Oh, Sissy. I am sorry about all the
fuss.
Julian and Sissy embrace and go at it under the covers But
suddenly: Julian stops after a brief climax.
JULIAN
(with downcast eyes)
I apologize.
Sissy cradles Julian and comforts him.
JULIAN
It is the measure of Western
Civilization that it can encompass
in harmony, balance off, as it were,
such divergent masterworks as A
MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM and THE
AMERICAN DREAM, as the dome of the
Sistine Chapel and the ceiling of
the Paris opera.
Sissy sits up, her eyes moping about the apartment, looking
but not seeing the macrame wallhangings, the volumes of Robert
Frost.
JULIAN
What's the matter?
After a while Sissy answers.
SISSY
I'm cold.
JULIAN
Here. I'll turn down the air
conditioner.
SISSY
It's not the air conditioner that's
making me cold. Nothing moves in
here. Not even your birds.
Sissy gets out of bed and begins to dress.
JULIAN
What are you doing?
SISSY
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
JULIAN
But I don't want you to leave. Please
stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you
a dinner. And tonight... we can...
really make love.
SISSY
I have to go, Julian.
JULIAN
Why? Why do you have to go?
SISSY
(somewhat frantic)
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake.
I've been negligent. I haven't
exercised. I have to hitchhike a
little bit every day, no matter what.
It's like a musician practicing his
scales. When I don't practice, my
timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff
and sore.
And Sissy is now traveling in a truck passing Fourteenth
Street on her way to the Geo. Washington Bridge.
View of that Bridge as the truck crosses it to New Jersy.
View of the wilds of New Jersey as Sissy travels to the West.
The Countess is on the phone.
THE COUNTESS
So she left town. Well, that shouldn't
surprise you. Leaving town is what
Sissy is all about. But tell me, how
did she strike you?
Julian is on the other end of the phone.
JULIAN
Extraordinary!
THE COUNTESS
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which
would you rather have, a million
dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs
full of pennies?
JULIAN
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her
hands. They're difficult to ignore,
I confess, but I'm speaking of her
whole being. Her whole being is
extraordinary. The way she talks,
for example. She's so articulate.
THE COUNTESS
It's high time you realized, honey
babe, that a woman doesn't have to
give the best years of her life to
Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak
the English language.
JULIAN
Countess. I'm really in a dither.
She's turned my head.
THE COUNTESS
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope.
How does she feel about you?
JULIAN
I think she's disappointed that I'm
not more, ah, sort of atavistic.
She's got some naive, sentimental
notions about Indians. I'm sure she
liked me, though; but.... then she
left town.
THE COUNTESS
She always leaves town, you dummy.
That doesn't mean anything. What
about in bed? How does she like it
in bed?
Julian pauses for a very long moment.
JULIAN
How does she like what in bed?
THE COUNTESS
Like what?
The Countess' teeth chatter in his mouth.
THE COUNTESS
What do you think?
JULIAN
Well.... er...
THE COUNTESS
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to
tell me you didn't get it on?
JULIAN
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
THE COUNTESS
Whose fault was that?
JULIAN
I suppose it was mine. Yes, it
definitely was my fault.
THE COUNTESS
What do they do to you boys in those
Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap
you down and pump the Nature out of
you? They can even press the last
drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck.
Why, send a shaman or cannibal to
Yale for four years and all he'd be
fit for would be a desk in the
military-industrial complex and a
seat in the third row at a Neil Simon
comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If
Harvard or Princeton could get hold
of the Chink for a couple of semesters
they'd turn him into a candidate for
the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps.
Oogie boogie.
JULIAN
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy
enough to suit you hillbillies, at
least we don't go around indulging
in racist terms such as 'Chink.'
Next thing I know, you'll be calling
me 'chief.'
THE COUNTESS
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's
sake.
JULIAN
What guy?
THE COUNTESS
Aw, he's some old fart holyman who
lives in the hills out West. Gives
my ranch the creeps and the willies,
too. But though he be old and dirty,
he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to
his toes. They don't have his juice
in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose
that I'll have to write Sissy out on
the road.
Sitting up after the bothersome lurch of the car.
MISS ADRIAN
Little twit.
(turns to Sissy)
You really ought to have phoned. We
were just in Mottburg escorting some
guests to the afternoon train.
(sighs)
More guests leaving ahead of schedule.
Three checked out today. They decided
to transfer to Elizabeth Arden's
Maine Chance spa in Phoenix, Arizona.
It costs two hundred and fifty dollars
a week less at the Rubber Rose, so
why are our guests leaving and going
to Elizabeth Arden's?
Miss Adrian pushes a button that sends a partition glass
between her and the cowgirl driver. Gloria starts laughing
silently on the other side of the glass.
MISS ADRIAN
I'll tell you why, it's that plague
of cowgirls. They've gradually
infiltrated every sector of our
program. The one named Debbie
considers herself an expert on
exercising and diet. With Bonanza
Jellybean's permission and against
my explicit orders, she's been
coercing the guests into trying
something called kundalini yoga. Do
you know what that is? It's trying
to mentally force a serpent of fire
to crawl up your spinal column. Miss
Hankshaw, our guests can't comprehend
kundalini yoga, let alone do it.
Yesterday, she ordered a new cookbook
by a Tibetan Negro, entitled Third
Eye in the Kitchen: Himalayan Soul
Food. God knows what that will be
like. The little barbarians are
destroying everything that I've built,
mocking all that the company stands
for. And there's a new one, one they
call del Ruby. She has the good will
of a scorpion. I've considered it
prudent to avoid a confrontation
that might further upset the guests.
But now that the season is practically
over -- we operate April through
September -- and the Countess is
finally coming...
We see women having facials.
MISS ADRIAN'S VOICE
We have a facial wing, and next to
that is the Hair Barn...
Sissy is being given a tour by Miss Adrian. A variety of
hairdos are witnessed.
MISS ADRIAN
We have a team of fifteen hair experts
from all over the world.
MISS ADRIAN
And fanny flab flies off in this
room at the rate of six hundred and
seventy-five pounds a day... that's
a lot of salted ham, Sissy....
Sissy and Miss Adrian walk through the lodge lobby, guests
and cowgirls are conducting a variety of activities:
A BIRD EXPERT projects slides of whooping cranes on the wall
and is giving a lecture about the habits of the birds.
In the center of the room COWGIRL DEBBIE is leading a mixture
of cowgirls and guests in a meditative chant as they reach
high above their heads in a yoga exercise.
Miss Adrian stops in front of the registration desk and Sissy
catches glimpses of the chaotic lobby.
MISS ADRIAN
Our special guest Miss Sissy Hankshaw
is with us.
The receptionist hands Miss Adrian a key to Sissy's room.
A COWGIRL makes a face at Sissy as she walks by carrying a
tray of herbal teas.
A representative of the film crew is being intimidated by a
Cowgirl who is looking though his camera lenses and shaking
them and listening to them like you would put a shell up to
your ear to hear the ocean.
COWGIRL
Cool! We're going to make a movie!...
Another cowgirl, BIG RED, is lifting a piece of furniture
and passes it to her accomplice.
BIG RED
Get rid of the furniture.... it's
too masculine... Get rid of all the
furniture and use it for kindling!!!
Break away from these pig-like
chauvinist masculine influences....
Miss Adrian looks on helplessly.... she grabs Sissy and leads
her out of the lobby.
Sissy stirs in a nicely appointed guest cottage. A maid knocks
on the door and serves Sissy breakfast in bed.
MAID
Excuse me, Miss. Do you care for
your breakfast now?
Sissy sits up and rubs her eyes.
SISSY
Yeah. I feel a bit hungry.
The Maid puts the tray down, and the cloth that covers the
food is lifted away to reveal a shocking display of grease
and calories.
A vase of prairie asters stands over a double-meat
cheeseburger, a package of Hostess Twinkies, a cold can of
Dr. Pepper and a Three Musketeers bar.
Sissy is delighted.
SISSY
Road food. How did you know?
MAID
Well it is a change of our usual
grapefruit and melba toast, I'm sure.
Sissy notices a card. It reads:
Compliments of Bonanza Jellybean
SISSY
Bonanza Jellybean....
MAID
She will be up to see you directly.
Sissy devours her meal. Out her window she can see women on
exercycles, women doing jumping jacks and women in beauty
parlors.
A FIST pounds on Sissy's door.
IN SAILS Jelly, a cowgirl so cute she makes Sissy blush just
to look at her. She wears a tan Stetson with an aster pinned
to it, a green satin shirt embroidered with rearing stallions
snorting orange fire from their nostrils.
Her breasts bounce like dinner rolls that have gotten loaded
on helium and, between red tinged cheeks, where more baby
fat is taking its time maturing, she has a little smile that
can cause minerals and plastics to remember their ancient
animate connections.
Jelly grasps Sissy's elbow and sits on the side of the bed.
JELLY
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great
to have you here. It's an honor.
Sorry I took so long getting to you,
but we've had a mess of hard work
these past few days -- and a heap of
planning to do.
SISSY
Er, you seem to know who I am, and
maybe even what I am. Thanks for the
breakfast.
JELLY
Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all
right. I've done a little hitchhiking
myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling
Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter
because you once knocked a tomato
can off a stump with a fieldstone.
I'd heard tales about you from people
I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops.
I heard about your, uh, your, ah,
your wonderful thumbs, and I heard
how you were Jack Kerouac's girl
friend...
Sissy sets her tray on the bedside table.
SISSY
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true.
Jack was in awe of me and tracked me
down. We spent a night talking and
hugging in a corn field, but he was
hardly my lover. Besides, I always
travel alone.
JELLY
Well, that doesn't matter; that part
never interested me anyway. The
beatnicks were before my time, and I
never got anything outta the hippies
but bad dope, clichs and the clap.
But the example of your life helped
me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
The guests are huffing and puffing in between the pauses in
conversation, in the background through the window in Sissy's
room.
SISSY
Tell me about it.
JELLY
About...
SISSY
About being a cowgirl. What's it all
about? When you say the word you
make it sound like it was painted in
radium on the side of a pearl.
JELLY
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly
common image. The idea of cowgirls
especially for little girls prevails
in our culture. Therefore, it seems
to me, the existence of cowgirls
should prevail. Otherwise, they're
being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of
Fame in Oklahoma City there are just
two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em
are trick-riders. Trick-riding is
what cowgirls have almost always
done in rodeos. Our society sure
likes to see its unconventional women
do tricks. That's what prostitutes
call it, you know: 'tricking.'
Jelly lays her hand atop the oval mound Sissy's thumb makes
under the covers.
SISSY
You're political, then?
JELLY
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on
the Rubber Rose who are political,
but I don't share their views. I got
no cowgirl ideology to expound.
"Politics is for people who have a
passion for changing life but lack a
passion for living it."
There is a moment when the two girls feel something between
each other.
JELLY
Did that last comment sound too
profound to be coming outta my mouth?
It's not original. It's something I
picked up from the Chink.
SISSY
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered
that you sometimes speak with him.
What else have you learned from the
Chink?
JELLY
Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha
ha. That's hard to say. We mostly....
Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
Jelly pauses.
JELLY
Oh yeah, now that I think of it, the
Chink taught me something about
cowgirls. Did you realize that
cowgirls have been around for many
centuries? Long before America. In
ancient India the care of the cattle
was always left up to young women
they called gopis. Being alone with
the cows all the time, the gopis got
awfully horny, just like we do here.
Every gopi was in love with Krishna,
a good-looking young god who played
the flute like it was going out of
style When the moon was full, this
Krishna would play his flute by a
river and call the gopis to him.
Then he would multiply himself sixteen
thousand times -- one for each gopi --
and make love to each one the way
she most desired. There they were,
sixteen thousand gopis balling Krishna
on the river bank, and the energy of
their merging was so great that it
created a huge oneness, a total union
of love, and it was God. Wow! Quite
a picture, huh?
Sissy's thumb twitches. Jelly swallows hard. They gaze into
each other's eyes.
A WHISTLE pierces the sunlight outside the window.
JELLY
That couldn't be Krishna, could it?
A bit shrill for a flute. Just our
rotten luck.
Jelly walks to the window and exchanges hand signals with
someone outside.
JELLY
Gotta run now. Delores says I'm
needed. Somebody's here. Maybe it's
the Countess.
Jelly spins her six-shooter in her kewpie fingers.
JELLY
Sissy, cowgirl history is about to
be made. I'm damn glad you're here
to witness it.
She holsters her gun and blows Sissy a kiss, then is gone
out the door.
Sissy hops out of bed and from the window she can see cowgirls
gathering in a circle. Someone or something is in the center
of the circle.
Sissy zips herself into a red jumpsuit and hurries outside.
The guests are hurriedly packing their things.
She looks on.
THE BARE-ASSED COWGIRLS storm into the beauty parlor and
exercise rooms.
SOUNDS OF breaking glass and wood splintering. The air is
singing with cries of "Wahoo," Yippee," "Let 'er buck" and
"The vagina is a self-cleaning organ."
SISSY flees the house as she hunkers down out the back door.
The Chink leads Sissy into the cave where we see his
clockworks. It is made of garbage can lids and old saucepans
and lard tins and car fenders all wired together with baling
wire. A bat flies into it making a bong noise and the
contraption moves a little.
CHINK
During the Second World War I busted
out of Tule Lake detention camp; as
a Japanese-American, I had been put
there and watched over. I found refuge
with the Clock People, who discovered
me in a snow bank, near dead, I had
been climbing across the Sierra Nevada
mountains.
SISSY
Then if you are Japanese, then why
are you called the Chink?
CHINK
The Clock People mistook me for
Chinese. And the name stuck. In the
same way that all Indian tribes came
to be labeled "Indians" through the
ignorance of an Italian sailor with
a taste for oranges, it is only
fitting that "Indians" misnamed me.
The Clock People, however, are not a
tribe, rather they are a gathering
of Indians from various tribes. They
have lived together since 1906.
A gathering of the Clock People. A woman is giving birth
near the Giant timekeeping hourglass.
CHINK
The pivotal function of the Clock
People is the keeping and observing
of the clockworks. It is a real thing,
and is kept at the center, at the
soul, of the Great Burrow. Insofar
as it is possible, all Clock People
deaths and births occur in the
presence of the clockworks. Aside
from birthing or dying, the reason
for the daily visits to the clockworks
is to check the time.
Sissy listens to the Chink as they walk around the Chink's
clockworks.
CHINK
These people have no other ritual
than this one. Likewise, they have
but one legend or cultural myth:
that of a continuum they call the
Eternity of Joy. It is into the
Eternity of Joy that they believe
all men will pass once the clockworks
is destroyed. The destruction must
come from the outside, must come by
natural means, must come at the will
of this gesticulating planet whose
more acute stirrings thoughtless
people call "earthquakes."
The Chink holds Sissy's thumbs in his hands adoringly.
CHINK
The Earth is alive. She burns inside
with the heat of cosmic longing. She
longs to be with her husband again.
She moans. She turns softly in her
sleep. In the Eternity of Joy,
pluralized, deurbanized man, at ease
with his gentle technologies, will
smile and sigh when the Earth begins
to shake. I loved those loony
redskins, but I couldn't be a party
to their utopian dreaming. After a
while it occurred to me that the
Clock People waiting for the Eternity
of Joy was virtually identical to
the Christians waiting for the Second
Coming. Or the Communists waiting
for the worldwide revolution. Or the
Debbies waiting for the flying
saucers. All the same. Just more
suckers betting their share of the
present on the future, banking every
misery on a happy ending to history.
Well, history is ending every second -
happily for some of us, unhappily
for others, happily one second,
unhappily the next. History is always
ending and always not ending... ha
ha ho ho and hee hee.
Sissy interrupts the Chink for a second while he is
worshipping her thumbs.
SISSY
What do you believe in then?
CHINK
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
Then he says nothing. And his silence makes Sissy weep. They
sit down on a grass floor, illuminated by the fire outside
the cave.
Then the Chink, without hesitation, grasps her thumbs. He
squeezes them, caresses them, covers them with wet kisses,
telling them how beautiful they are.
Sissy is bowled over, frightened, stunned, elated, moved
almost to tears.
Sissy bends her head back and whispers.
SISSY
If this be adultery, make the most
of it.
And as the Chink plunges into Sissy, she arches her spread
bottom against the blankets and rears up to meet him halfway.
Their bodies glowing in the firelight, they cast shadows of
ANCIENT BEINGS, anthropomorphs making love through the night
under the moon.
SUNBEAMS awaken Sissy. When she looks around she sees an
inscription has been freshly scrawled on the right wall.
I BELIEVE IN EVERYTHING; NOTHING IS SACRED.
And on the left wall:
I BELIEVE IN NOTHING; EVERYTHING IS SACRED.
Sissy hears and then sees A HELICOPTER in the sky above the
ranch. Sissy gets up and walks out of the cave.
The countess is in a snit.
THE COUNTESS
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're
a good model but a shitty actress.
The cowgirls are involved in this
whooping crane disappearance. You
know perfectly well they are. Last
seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to
Canada. Siwash Lake is between
Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls
have possession of Siwash Lake. And
who else but Jellybean's wild cunts
could possibly conceive of doing
something so diabolical as to tamper
with the last flock of some nearly
extinct birds? How much do you know
about it? Have they murdered those
cranes the way they murdered my moo
cows?
SISSY
I don't know anything about it.
THE COUNTESS
Sissy. You're trying to protect those
scuzzy bitches. Well, let your
conscience be your guide, as my mommy
used to say, but it won't work. Those
stinking sluts are going to suffer...
Sissy strikes the Countess with her right thumb -- with
astonishing force.
Immediately the thumb strikes again, this time shattering
the Countess's monocle against his eye.
THE COUNTESS
(gasping)
Shit O dear.
HIS DENTURES fall onto the shag rug.
The left thumb strikes. Sissy is swinging her thumbs like
ballbats socking flaming homers over the left-field fence.
The countess is out on his feet. His eyes are closed. His
legs wobble. He does a pathetic dance, like a drunken old
fool trying to boogie with a chorus girl.
He topples forward and meets Sissy's onrushing thumb of
thunder which straightens him up, sends him over backward.
Motionless, he lies on the floor, a crimson part in his
thinning hair, a bright ooze at each nostril.
Seated on a spotless wooden bench is Sissy, staring at a
clock. A surgeon emerges.
SURGEON
Well, he's not out of danger, but I
think we can safely say he's going
to make it. I'd be pretty surprised
if he didn't. However, there is
evidence of injury to the frontal
lobe, and I have reason to fear that
this injury may be permanent. The
patient may never again function as
a normal human being.
SISSY
Brain damage? You mean he's going to
be a vegetable?
SURGEON
Vegetable? Vegetable? I wouldn't say
that, no. We won't ascertain the
extent of the injury for some days.
But there is a genuine possibility
of severe and lasting behavioral
defects. I wouldn't classify it in
the vegetable category, however.
The DRIVER stomps on the gas. With a sense of disgust at her
own failure Sissy scrutinizes his sweaty brow, his smug hot
leer, his starving eyes.
Her heart sinks when she sees his gun and his knife. He is
also unzipping his pants.
DRIVER
I'm going to give it to you like
you've never had it before. Oh, you
didn't know it could be this good.
You're gonna like it. You're gonna
like it. You're gonna like it so
good. You're gonna love it so much
you're gonna cry. You're gonna cry.
You're gonna cry and cry. Do you
like to cry? Do you like it when it
hurts a little bit? Whatever happens
to you, it'll be worth it. The way
I'm gonna give it to you, it'll be
worth anything. Everything. Go ahead
and cry if you want to. I like it
when women cry. It means they
appreciate me.
Sissy looks into the back at a soiled mattress.
The driver is taking his dick out of his pants. But with a
swift swoosh, Sissy's left thumb comes down hard on the penis
top, making the driver howl.
His finger fumbles for the gun trigger, but before he gets
to it, Sissy's thumb splats between his eyes. Twice. Three
times. He loses control of the van.
Sissy goes in and begins to cry at the counter as she looks
at her thumbs.
THE ASSISTANT INTERIOR UNDERSECRETARY IS SPEAKING INTO A
MICROPHONE FOR THE NEWS, and reading from a paper in his
hand.
UNDERSECRETARY
It will be my extreme pleasure to
report to the President...
Students listening...
UNDERSECRETARY
...who has been gravely concerned
about the fate of our whooping
cranes....
Sissy hears a broadcast over a moving car radio.
NEWS REPORTER
The Rubber Rose Ranch has issued a
communiqu that was sent to the
federal judge and copies of a
recording to the press, today.
We can hear the voice of Bonanza Jellybean:
JELLY
(over the radio)
THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS BEEN DRIVEN
TO THE EDGE OF EXTINCTION BY AN
AGGRESSIVE, BRUTAL PATERNALISTIC
SYSTEM INTENT ON SUBDUING THE EARTH
AND ESTABLISHING ITS DOMINION OVER
ALL THINGS -- IN THE NAME OF GOD THE
FATHER, LAW, ORDER AND ECONOMIC
PROGRESS.
Sissy recognizes the voice.
SISSY
That's Jellybean!
JELLY (V.O.)
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS
RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT.
MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES,
STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY,
POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR,
BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
Jelly is on the telephone.
JELLY
OBVIOUSLY, A PATERNALISTIC SOCIETY
DOES NOT DESERVE ANYTHING AS GRAND
AND BEAUTIFUL AND WILD AND FREE AS
THE WHOOPING CRANE. YOU MEN HAVE
FAILED IN YOUR DUTY TO THE CRANE.
NOW IT IS WOMEN'S TURN. THE CRANES
ARE IN OUR CHARGE NOW. WE WILL PROTECT
THEM AS LONG AS THEY STILL REQUIRE
PROTECTION --
Sissy listens to the radio.
JELLY'S VOICE
WHILE WORKING TOWARD A DAY WHEN THE
CREATURES OF THE WORLD NO LONGER
HAVE TO SUFFER MAN'S EGOISM,
INSENSITIVITY AND GREED. WE REFUSE
YOUR ORDER. WE SAY TAKE YOUR ORDER
AND SHOVE IT. THIS FLOCK OF BIRDS IS
STAYING WITH US. GET LOST, MAC.
An undertaker pounding five nails into a white coffin. ON
THE TOP OF THE COFFIN are engraved two crossed GOLD SIXGUNS.
There are eleven famous cowgirls enameled on the edges and
in the middle it reads:
BONANZA JELLYBEAN
1944-1973
"Ha ha ho ho and hee hee"
Title card:
The brown paper bag.
A brown paper bag is sitting on the side of the road.
A VOICE
The brown paper bag is the only thing
civilized man has produced that does
not seem out of place in nature.
Crumpled into a wad of wrinkles,
like the fossilized brain of a dryad;
its kinship to tree (to knot and
nest) unobscured by the cruel crush
of industry; absorbing the elements
like any other organic entity;
blending with rock and vegetation as
if it were a burrowing owl's door
mat or a jack rabbit's underwear, a
No. 8 Kraft paper bag lay discarded
in the hills of Dakota and appeared
to live where it lay. Once long ago,
it had borne a package of buns and a
jar of mustard to a kitchenette
rendezvous with a fried hamburger.
More recently, the bag had
held........ love letters.
View of a bunkhouse trunk.
VOICE
As a hole in an oak hides a squirrel's
family jewels, the bag had hidden
love letters in the bottom of a
bunkhouse trunk.
Hands lift the contents of the trunk away, rope, spurs, and
blanket and find the hidden sack of letters.
VOICE
Then one day after work, the button-
nosed little cowgirl to whom the
letters were addressed gathered bag
and contents under her arm, slipped
out to the corral...
We see the Cowgirl saddling her horse late in the day.
VOICE
...past ranch hands pitching
horseshoes and ranch hands flying
Tibetan kites, saddled up and trotted
into the hills.
We see the Cowgirl riding along a ridge.
VOICE
A mile or so from the bunkhouse, she
dismounted and built a small fire;
she fed the fire letters.
And this we see also, the lonely Cowgirl feeding the letters
to a fire in the dusky early night. We can see the cowgirl
is Sissy Hankshaw.
VOICE
...one by one, the way her girl friend
had once fed her french fries.
She is crying now and feeding the fire, close of words like
"always" and "forever" burning up.
VOICE
As words such as sweetheart" and
"honey britches" and "forever" and
"always" burned away, the cowgirl
squirted a few tears. Her eyes were
so misty she forgot to burn the bag.
Sissy is sobbing.
Big Red offers a piece of homemade fudge and shows no surprise
when Sissy refuses it.
Kym kisses the lips quickly of the despondent Cowgirl, and
the bunkhouse lights go out.
Delores plunks a carefree song on an old Gibson, looks up at
the moon.
DELORES
You know, podner, you can tune a
guitar but you can't tuna fish.
She plunks a few notes.
DELORES
God, but it's good to be a cowgirl.
And the bunkhouse lights are turned off. There are some
giggles from the cowgirls.
THE CHINK wakes up and is being cared for by Sissy. He is in
pain, but winking.
SISSY
Is everything getting worse?
CHINK
Yes, everything is getting worse.
But everything is also getting better.
SISSY
The Countess has come to our aid.
The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially
deeded to all the cowgirls. And I
have been asked to oversee the ranch.
For $300 a week. And as it turns
out, the Countess is not going to be
the vegetable the doctors thought he
was... here's a picture!
Sissy shows a picture of the Countess recovering in a hospital
bed, posing next to Doctor Robbins.
CHINK
I want to go back to the Clock People.
I kind of miss those fool redskins
and wonder what they're up to. What's
happened to Jelly?
SISSY
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas
City.
CHINK
You mean she's dead?
The Chink mourns a bit.
SISSY
But that's an old story now...... I
can't believe that you would leave
the Butte.
CHINK
Easy come, easy go.
DELORES
Wow, you sure have a way with words.
The Chink looks over and sees that Delores is standing in
the doorway.
CHINK
I can't help it if I grew up in an
antipoetic culture. Language will be
different when I'm with the Clock
People though. They're from an oral
tradition. And I'm not talking about
what you horny hop toads do in bed
every night.
The Chink smiles.
Delores blushes.
SISSY
Well, if the Clock People give you
any inside information on the end of
the world, drop us a postcard.
CHINK
The world isn't going to end, you
dummy; I hope you know that much.
(he grows
uncharacteristically
serious)
But it is going to change. It's going
to change drastically, and probably
in your lifetime. The Clock People
see calamitous earthquakes as the
agent of change, and they may be
right, since there are a hundred
thousand earthquakes a year and major
ones are long overdue. But there are
far worse catastrophes coming...
unless the human race can bring itself
to abandon the goals and values of
civilization, in other words, unless
it can break the consumption habit --
and we are so conditioned to consuming
as a way of life that for most of us
life would have no meaning without
the yearnings and rewards of
progressive consumption. It isn't
merely that our bad habits will cause
global catastrophes, but that our
operative political-economic
philosophies have us in such a blind
crab grip that they prevent us from
preparing for the natural disasters
that are not our fault. So the
apocalyptic shit is going to hit the
fan, all right, but there'll be some
of us it'll miss. Little pockets of
humanity. Like the Clock People.
Like you two honeys, if you decide
to accept my offer of a lease on
Siwash Cave. There's almost no
worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear
accident, plague, weather warfare or
reduction of the ozone shield --
that you couldn't survive in that
cave.
He begins to caress Sissy's belly. His eyes are smiling.
Sissy is surprised.
CHINK
Suppose that you bear five or six
children with your characteristics.
All in Siwash Cave. In a
postcatastrophe world, your offspring
would of necessity intermarry, forming
in time a tribe. A tribe every member
of which had giant thumbs. A tribe
of Big Thumbs would relate to the
environment in very special ways. It
could not use weapons or produce
sophisticated tools. It would have
to rely on its wits and its senses.
It would have to live with animals --
and plants! -- as virtual equals.
It's extremely pleasant to me to
think about a tribe of physical
eccentrics living peacefully with
animals and plants, learning their
languages, perhaps, and paying them
the respect they deserve.
SISSY
How am I going to be the progenitor
of a tribe when I'm living on an
isolated ridgetop with Delores?
CHINK
That's your problem.
The Chink coughs.
CHINK
Listen to the way I'm babbling. That
bullet must have loosened one of my
transistors. Don't pay any attention
to me. You've got to work it out for
yourself. The westbound choo-choo
leaves Mottburg at one-forty. I want
to be on it. Will you drive me to
the station?
Sissy and Delores are driving the Chink out the front gate
of the Rubber Rose.
CHINK
Schedules! Ironic how I have to follow
timetables in order to get back to
the clockworks.
He yells out the window of the moving vehicle.
CHINK
Don't ever bet against paradox,
ladies...
