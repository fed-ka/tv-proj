We're moving through a cornfield. At speed. The sound of
children's laughter. Excited shrieking.
A beautiful young girl, (MARY BOLEYN, 8), our heroine, runs
through the fields, being chased by her younger brother, GEORGE,
and sister, ANNE, (10).
Touchingly, MARY is barely taller than the corn, her head
skimming along the sheaves.
REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: the children are being watched by their
parents, (SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH BOLEYN).
SIR THOMAS
I received a formal request for marriage
today for Anne.
(a beat)
From the Carey family.
SIR THOMAS indicates to
ANNE; the eldest. Dark-haired.
Intelligent. The obvious leader among the children.
LADY ELIZABETH
But that's wonderful.
SIR THOMAS
I turned it down.
LADY ELIZABETH turns...`What?'
SIR THOMAS
And offered them Mary instead.
SIR THOMAS indicates
MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired.
Pretty. Sweet-natured.
SIR THOMAS
Fnne's too good for William Carey. She
can do (better than a merchant's son.
LADY ELIZABETH
You underestimate Mary.
SIR THOMAS
Not true. I think she's..the kinder of
the two. Quite possibly the fairer.
The CHILDREN, meanwhile, have started a race..
SIR THOMAS
But to get ahead in this world, you need
more than fair looks and a kind heart.
On the field, ANNE wins. She jumps up and down, holding her arms
aloft, as MARY flops to the floor. Vanquished.

SIR THOMAS smiles, `See?' He walks towards ANNE..
SIR THOMAS
(applauding his favourite)
Bravo! Anne!

The thunder of horses' hooves. A huge cloud of dust.
The Royal Standard flutters in the wind. Beneath it, a SOLDIER
in the KING's uniform, riding hard, dirt kicking up in his wake.
The SOLDIER is flanked by a dozen other of the KING's SOLDIERS,
who lead a coloumn of fifty or more RIDERS..
It's like an army. A legion riding into battle. But it's not,
This is just the KING OF ENGLAND going away for the week-end.
Behind the advance party, is the KING himself, (30's), handsome,
in his prime, surrounded by a dozen or so of his closest
COURTIERS, (among them the DUKE of NORFOLK), a grand, tough,
intimidating lot.
Behind them, comes the KING's CONFESSOR, a Priest with a large
ornate crucifix, a small library of religious books..
Then, in a riot of colour, come the MUSICIANS, the FOOL and the
PLAYERS, led by the MASTER of the REVELS.
Behind them, come the SQUIRES and PAGES, carrying the King's
weapons, his jousting kit, his swords, his armour, his lance,
etc.
Then come the animals: FALCONS, in cages, and the HUNTING
HOUNDS, beagles and pinchers, barking in excitement, and an
assortment of FRESH HORSES for travelling, and hunting.
And finally, bringing up the rear, another unit of ARMED GUARDS,
and a second STANDARD BEARER..

The BOLEYN family page, (WILLIAM STAFFORD), is perched on a

Presently, he sees clouds of dust and the sound of thunder

Pandemonium breaks out among STAFF and FAMILY MEMBERS as
STAFFORD calls out, "The King!"

The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is nervously assembled outside the
house, (which we notice has been transformed at great cost. Huge
marquees in the gardens. Fountains. Additional staff. Smart
uniforms. New extensions to the stables and kitchens).
MARY is discreetly hidden, among the CROWDS. ANNE is pride of
place. Visibly nervous. SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH are beside
her. The proud PARENTS.
Everyone bows deeply in deference as the King arrives.
SIR THOMAS
Your Majesty, you are most welcome.
The King dismounts athletically. His DOGS are unleashed, bark
excitedly..

HENRY

Your Uncle tells me I should have you at
court. Should I?
GEORGE
It would be a great honour, Sir.
MARY dutifully, modestly averts her eyes..
SIR THOMAS
And our daughter, Anne.
ENRY turns to see ANNE.
ENRY
No one said anything of a daughter.
ANNE curtseys deeply...
HENRY
Had we known, we might have come sooner.
ANNE
Your Majesty..
SIR THOMAS
Perhaps you'll allow Anne to show you
around our modest house?
HENRY
A pleasure.
ANNE offers HENRY her hand. He takes it, then leads ANNE away.
MARY shoots ANNE a look, `Good luck'.

ANNE leads the KING through the house. She is followed at a
distance by SIR THOMAS BOLEYN. And watched by MARY and GEORGE
from a gallery above..
ANNE

Perhaps because falcons are vaguely

ANNE
Oh, his Majesty has nothing to fear from

HENRY smiles, visibly charmed..
HENRY
Really? And what would they be..?
WATCHING FROM ABOVE, MARY smiles to herself, "Well done, Anne",
as HENRY and ANNE continue down a corridor..
The following morning..
Thirty or more RIDERS, STABLE-BOYS and HORSES are gathered. To
one side, a deafening pack of DEER-HOUNDS, (wire-haired
Lurchers), barking frantically.
t's a scene of great activity, excitement, and anticipation.
The MASTER OF THE HORSE helps HENRY mount his steed - the
biggest and most glamorous stallion of all, with wonderful,
ornate saddlery.

they ride pillion, (ie), riding on the same horse as their MEN,

ANNE
On my own your Grace.
HENRY
Your own..?
A STABLE-BOY leads out her horse.
ANNE
They have invented a new saddle which
allows ladies to ride on their own.
ANNE skilfully mounts the horse, and sits upright..
HENRY

you stay on the horse?
ANNE
Why? The same way you hold onto yours,
your Grace.
A flicker behind HENRY's eyes. It's the first wrong move ANNE
has made.

We'll see.
ENRY yanks the reins on his horse..
HENRY
Let's away!
ANNE shoots a look at MARY. Then follows.

The STAG twitches in fear, then bolts off towards the forest.

The DOGS and RIDERS roar across fields. The hounds snarl, almost
delirious with primal agitation..
Among the RIDERS, the more advanced HORSEMEN have already opened
up a clear lead on their weaker counterparts..
n the advanced group, are HENRY, several COURTIERS, his GUARDS
and, of course, ANNE..
They jump over a hedge. One of HENRY's COURTIERS catches the
hedge and falls. HENRY smiles, then turns to see..
ANNE comfortably jumping the hedge herself. HENRY's smile fades.
He urges his horse to greater speed..

MARY and WILLIAM ride through London streets escorted by
SERVANTS bringing their belongings. They approach Whitehall
Palace. Armed GUARDS slowly open the gates.

the `free' world outside. Then, she rides through the Palace
gates.

The outside world has been totally sealed off. Faces appear at
palace windows, staring down at the `new arrivals'.

a goat.
MARY
Well, she likes you, and asked me to
give you this..to remember her by.

Ugh. Well say you haven't seen me. Or

VER BY THE STABLES: the KING and ANNE are mounting horses to go
riding together. HENRY lifts ANNE up into the saddle behind him,
(how she has learned!). ANNE holds tight, her arms wrapped
around his waist..

ANNE kicks HENRY's horse, `Hah!', and they ride out. Galloping
into the distance.

EORGE indicates HENRY, who's face is also drawn, dark,
malevolent, suspicious. Barely recognisable.

silence his enemies. He will claim
innocence. That he was corrupted. Anne
will swiftly be replaced as Queen, by
someone more `acceptable'.

A LIEUTENANT gives a nod. SOLDIERS raise a barrier, and allow
the CROWDS that have been waiting to rush forward.

A roar of the crowd. ANNE, wearing a shawl of white ermine, is
violently jostled and spat at as she's marched across Tower Hill
to the scaffold. She shoots MARY an anxious look across the
crowds..

MARY shoots a signal, "Don't worry." ANNE climbs the steps, and
faces the CROWDS. Finally the jeers subside..
ANNE
I...I come here to die...a loyal
subject..
More spit, jeers and abuse. MARY stands on tiptoe, cranes her
neck. Anxiously scans the CROWDS for the GUARDS that will free
ANNE..
MARY
Come on..
ANNE
..I..I do not blame the King. Never was
there a more just or goodly Lord..
Presently, MARY sees two SOLDIERS pushing through the CROWDS
towards her. Her heart leaps..
ANNE
..I beg God's forgiveness and his
mercy..

MARY continues to read the letter, as ANNE is forced to kneel by
the EXECUTIONER..
CROMWELL (V.O.)
"But you risked your life coming to
court and you are advised you not to do
so again. You will not be shown the same
clemency a second time. Your sister Anne
was tried and found guilty, her crimes
were high treason and she deserves to
die. Cromwell."
MARY, who is reading, looks up in horror..
MARY
No!
ANNE looks up. She sees the look on MARY's face.
MARY's eyes.
ANNE's eyes.
`WHOOSH', the masked EXECUTIONER swings his sword. ANNE is
beheaded. MARY almost chokes..
The CROWD falls eerily silent. A stunned calm descends on Tower
Green. Nothing but the sound of the wind.
MARY sways, then falls backwards, having lost consciousness. She
falls, falls..but is caught by a strong pair of arms..
..WILLIAM STAFFORD, who has followed her to London.
Suddenly the CROWDS burst into life. A great, bloodthirsty ROAR
echoes around Tower Green as ANNE's head is lifted aloft..
