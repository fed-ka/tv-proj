      CLARK is still at his desk, contemplating the ring.  He 
      snaps the case shut, determined, and steals a glance at 
      LOIS, just heading back to her desk, away from the 
      celebratory hoopla.  He moves to her.

                     expected.  Let's say it created an 
                     unforeseen energy field... that 
                     passed through Superman, into this 
                     reporter and made her...
                     ultra-unique.

      She taps the picture of Ultra Woman.  Lucille looks at Nell.

                                      LUCILLE
                     Tell me you were adopted.  Because 
                     if we actually share genes, I'll 
                     jump in front of a bus.

                                      NELL
                     Lucille.  Superman didn't fly onto 
                     the scene, he walked.  He didn't 
                     blow the flame out, he used a tarp.
                     I'm telling you, he's got all the 
                     super-powers of... Batman.  And 
                     _she_ is proof that those powers 
                     are transferrable.

                                      LUCILLE
                     Okay, let's say you're... not 
                     totally wrong.  We don't have the 
                     laser anymore.

      Nell produces a _second_ laser from her work bench.  Holds 
      it up.

                     Last night, while _you_ were
                     binging and purging, some of us
                     were working.

                                      LUCILLE
                     And our Red Kryptonite ... ?

                     better work.  Which means you'd 
                     better practice.

      She hands the laser over to Lucille.

                                      LUCILLE
                     Sorry?

                     Nell, in every partnership, there's 
                     a kind of symbiosis.  Ours is

                           (points to self)
                     -- and execution.
                           (points to Nell)
                     My dreams become our reality 
                     because of _you_.  That's your 
                     gift... it always has been.

                     Well, I think the key here is the 
                     Red Kryptonite.  It was found by

      Clark can't get the bottle open.  Sets it down.  Lois takes 
      it. Pops it open easily.  He tries to be a sport.

                     wearing this costume under my

                     six months, and we almost lost the

                           (to Clark)
                     Your mother went to work as a 
                     secretary, and ended up as office 
                     manager -- with a secretary of her

                     Anyway, your mother saved the day.
                     And it was hard for me to lie there 
                     and watch her do everything.  But I 
                     got over that.  What I didn't get 
                     over was her twelve hour days, 
                     working weekends, holidays.  I

      The timer reads: 3:58 ... 3:57... 3:56...

      Clark's wrists are bound behind the chair back and his 
      ankles are tied to the legs.  Pressing his toes down, Clark
      rocks his chair back quietly and looks out the half-open
      door.  Outside, he can glimpse Lucille and Nell in the
      moonlight, pacing, murmuring.  He rocks back a little
      further and now we see he's trying to free his ankles of
      their rope-bonds by sliding them down and over the end of
      the chair legs.

      starts to topple over.

                     I overheard them talking about some 
                     kind of plan to get 200 million by 
                     tomorrow...
                           (looks around)
                     Looks like they cleared out of here 
                     pretty fast, maybe they left a 
                     clue.

      Ultra Woman sees the blackboard.  It's mostly been erased.
      She turns on the X-RAY BEAMS.  Because the chalk lines are
      broken up, it's still mostly illegible as she scans.

                                      CLARK (CONT'D)
                     What do you see?

      She zeroes in on the lower corner.  There, a NUMBER wasn't
      erased entirely.  It was smeared over by a streak of chalk.  
      So by X-RAYING _beneath_ this streak she can read --

                                      ULTRA WOMAN (CONT'D)
                     A number. 9117841... something, 
                     something, something... can't get 
                     the other three, they're gone.

      She looks at Clark.

                                      CLARK
                     So how does that add up to two
                     hundred million dollars?

                                                        CUT TO:



      Lois works at computer.  Clark sits on her desk.  Jimmy 
      stands.  All mulling.

                                      LOIS
                     There's no facility in town with
                     that much cash.

                                      CLARK
                     So is the money coming _in_ to 
                     Metropolis.  But what bank needs 
                     that much?

                     Too short for a car registration.
                     Anybody want coffee?

      Lois and Jimmy, absorbed by the screen, raise their hands.
      Clark moves off.

                     You ever get that interview with
                     Ultra Woman?

      Lois glances back at him, then the screen again.

                     I just wondered if she... you 
                     know... mentioned if she was seeing 
                     anybody?

                     It's not that I think I'm good 
                     enough for her -- up against Deion 
                     Sanders and Brad Pitt -- but I just 
                     can't stop thinking about her and 
                     if you could tell her that I... 
                     well, that I'm really a nice guy.

                                      LOIS
                     You are.

      Perry stalks through the scene, looking rumpled, haggard and

                     No but he's made up for it by
                     yelling at _everybody_.

      A phone rings.  Jimmy gets it as Lois sips her coffee and 
      Clark looks at the computer.

                                      CLARK

      Behind them, Jimmy cups the phone in fear.

                     It's Alice!  What do I do?

                                      JIMMY
                     And her sister sounded so upset.

                                      CLARK
                     Who's sister?

                     The jumper.  It was her sister who
                     called, crying and sobbing...

      Clark gets a very bad feeling.

                                      CLARK
                     I think I want to cover this one
                     too.

      He takes off.



      He begins to strip out of his street clothes, exposing the
      'S.'  She unfolds a blouse and begins to get into her street
      clothes.

                     I'll go pay another visit to
                     S.T.A.R. Labs, you get back to the
                     Planet and see if you can narrow
                     down which truck it is.

                                      ULTRA WOMAN
                     Okay, be careful.

                                      CLARK
                     You too.

      They kiss and separate, both still changing.

                     One of these trucks is making a
                     pickup at the Bank of Metropolis.
                           (looks at watch)
                     No, made a pickup.

                     some bank mail...

                     to constantly replenish ATM's with
                     new bills.  And the old ones are

                     Fine stuff, kids.  But we still
                     don't know... where'd this Ultra

                     saying much more.

                     That's super-heroes for you

                     breathed the Planet for thirty                (X)
