The darkness is actually water. A SEARCHLIGHT arcs across
heavy ocean swells. Half-a-dozen flashlights -- weaker beams --
racing along what we can see is the deck of an aging FISHING
TRAWLER.
FISHERMEN struggling with a gaff -- something in the water --
A HUMAN CORPSE.
THE BODY sprawled there. The Sailors all talking at once --
three languages going -- brave chatter to mask the presence
of death --
SAILOR #1
-- Jesus, look at him --
SAILOR #2
-- what? -- you never saw a dead man
before? --
SAILOR #3
-- look, look he was shot --
(nudging the body --)
SAILOR #1
-- don't, don't do that --
SAILOR #2
-- he's dead, you think he cares? --
SAILOR #1
-- so have some respect -- it's a --
(stopping as --)
THE BODY MOVES! -- convulsing -- coughing up sea water --
the Sailors -- freaked -- jumping back -- standing there, as --
THE MAN begins to breathe.
The Trawler plows through heavy seas.
THE MAN stands at the rail, staring out to sea. So lost. He
turns to head inside -- there, a surfcasting rod propped
against a locker.
THE MAN picks up the rod -- flips the bail -- traps the line --
now he's casting far out into the darkness. And for the first
time, he smiles.
THE MAN alone doing chin-ups on the deck rail. He's still
bandaged and the wounds must hurt like hell, but he's pushing
himself. Using the pain -- bathing in it -- maybe even hoping
that it will hold some answer for him.
SAILORS hauling in the nets. THE MAN -- still bandaged, but
healing -- working beside them. Earning his keep. Getting
healthy.
A small, colorful fishing village. The trawler motoring in.
A HELICOPTER SHOT -- a bullet train speeds through snow-
capped Alps. We move in on a window -- and staring out is...
...and out of the darkness into night and the HELICOPTER
SHOT, as the train races toward ZURICH.
THE MAN walking aimlessly.
THE MAN trying to get comfortable on a bench. It's chilly
but this will have to do until morning.
Just settling in, when --
ZURICH COP #1 (O.S.)
(authority German)
Can't you read the signs?
THE MAN turns. TWO ZURICH COPS coming toward him.
ZURICH COP #2
On your feet. Let's go. Right now.
THE MAN makes his feet. They're on top of him now.
ZURICH COP #1
The park is closed. There's no
sleeping in the park.
ZURICH COP #2
Let's see some identification.
THE MAN not sure what to do. Eyes moving. Mouth shut.
ZURICH COP #1
Come on. Your papers. Let's go.
THE MAN
I've lost them. I've...
(German now)
My papers. They are lost.
ZURICH COP #1
(not sympathetic)
Okay. Let's go. Put your hands up.
ZURICH COP #2
(pulling his nightstick)
-- come on -- hands up -- up --
THE MAN raising his hand slowly -- ZURICH COP #1 reaching up
to pat him down --
THE MAN
-- look, I'm just trying to sleep
okay? --
(German again)
-- I just need to sleep --
ZURICH COP #2 has heard enough -- giving a sharp poke with
the nightstick -- into THE MAN's back -- and that's the last
thing he'll remember because --
THE MAN is in motion.
A single turn -- spinning -- catching COP #2 completely off
guard -- the heel of his hand driving up into the guy's throat
and --
COP #1 -- behind him -- trying to reach for his pistol, but
THE MAN -- still turning -- all his weight moving in a single
fluid attack -- a sweeping kick and --
COP #1 -- he's falling -- catching the bench -- trying to
fight back but -- THE MAN -- like a machine -- just
unbelievably fast -- three jackhammer punches -- down-down-
down and -- COP #1 -- head slammed into the bench -- blood
spraying from his nose -- he's out cold and --
COP #2 -- writhing on the ground -- gasping for air --
struggling with his holster -- THE MAN -- his foot -- down --
like a vise -- onto COP #2's arm -- shattering the bone --
COP #2 starting to scream, and then silenced because --
THE MAN -- he's got the pistol -- so fucking fast -- he's
got it right up against COP #2's forehead -- right on the
edge of pulling the trigger -- he is, he's gonna shoot him --
ZURICH COP #2
(gasping, pleading)
-- no -- please God no -- please
don't -- please no -- my Go
-- stopping as --
THE MAN slams the gun against his temple and --
This fight is over.
THE MAN standing there. In the silence. Two unconscious cops
at his feet. Blood on his pants. What just happened? How did
he do this? And there's THE GUN in his hand. And God, it
just feels so natural -- checking it -- stripping it down --
holding it -- aiming it -- like this is something he's done
a million times before...
This is something he definitely knows how to do.
And then he stops cold. Throwing down the gun. Running off
into the darkness --
Morning in the financial district. Upscale. Uptight.
GEMEINSCHAFT BANK just one of many elegant fortresses on
this street. Everything just now opening for business. TWO
GUARDS unlocking the front door and --
THE MAN across the street. Tucked in the shadows. Checking
for cops and trouble. Looks clear. He's walking and --
BOURNE exits the bank. The red bag full to its limit. He's
walking briskly now. Looking for a taxi. Nothing in sight.
BOURNE crossing the street. Shit, there's A COP on the corner --
turn -- change pace -- make it look natural --
BOURNE around a corner. And it's looking good for a moment --
but only a moment -- TWO MORE COPS walking a beat -- walking
this way -- turn -- cut -- cross the street --
BOURNE heading down a boulevard. Trying to look small. Pulse
starting to race. Fighting the paranoia. Where the hell is a
cab? Turning back fast as A SIREN starts bleeding in from
behind him --
It's just an ambulance.
BOURNE turning back. Forcing himself to focus. And fuck --
there's A METER MAID, and she's stopped writing up a ticket --
she's staring at him and --
BOURNE trying not to panic -- don't run -- smile -- stay
small -- get to the corner -- scan the options -- but --
THE METER MAID -- she's watching him go and she's pulling
her radio and --
BOURNE hitting this next corner -- banging a right -- forcing
himself not to run -- glancing back and --
THERE'S ANOTHER COP -- but this one is jogging -- searching --
he's got his radio out and --
FINALLY TO --
BOURNE bailing on the street -- disappearing into --
Big gates. Speed barricades. SEVERAL U.S. MARINES standing
guard near a gate house. An American flag. Lots of people
coming and going. BOURNE playing it as normal as possible as
he heads for the entrance.
BOURNE -- dangling fifty-feet above the stone courtyard! --
he's gone out the window! -- hanging there -- hanging with
one hand -- one hand clutching the corner of a ledge and --
BOURNE still hanging there -- looking down -- up -- there's
no choice -- he has to go down --
BOURNE finding a toehold below him -- reaching -- touching
down -- it gives way -- crumbling and --
BOURNE hesitates. Does he know how to do this or not? Stalled
for a moment, then...
BOURNE starts climbing down. And this is all one shot. No
cutaway. No cheating.
We are watching a master at work...
Handhold to a drain pipe. Swinging to a better ledge.
Dropping to an air-conditioner. Grabbing a window frame just
before the air-conditioner gives way. Teetering there. Now
he's on the fourth floor.
Below, there's an open window on the third floor. Struggling
to keep his balance, he reaches behind him to shift the weight
of the bag, and as he does --
THE RED BAG falls. Thump. Into the courtyard. Forget the
open window. Now he's got to go all the way.
Timing his next move and --
He's pushing off -- reaching -- there's another drainpipe
and he's snagged it -- he's got a dragline now -- starting
to fall -- straining to hold the pipe -- slowing his descent --
the drainpipe pulling away from it's housing and --
BOURNE letting go -- just before he falls backward -- one
last grab -- catching a gutter -- holding it just long enough
to slow his fall and --
Letting go for the last fifteen feet and --
A DOZEN MARINES -- pumped-up and listening to --
SECURITY
-- we're gonna go room by room until
we find him -- so let's get teamed
up --
MARIE storming away. Pissed-off -- broke -- illegal -- ruined
and --
MARIE
(German)
Motherfucking sonsofbitches!
(a new problem --)
A LITTLE RED CAR. A beat-to-shit Euro car. A shitty little
red car angled in beside a dumpster with a big red Zurich
parking ticket on the windshield.
MARIE grabbing the ticket -- tearing it up -- tearing the
shit out of it -- blind with misfortune -- throwing the pieces
on the ground and stomping on them and then --
MARIE
(looking up --)
What are you looking at?
BOURNE standing across the car -- on the passenger side --
BOURNE
I need a ride.
MARIE
What?
BOURNE
I need a ride out of here.
MARIE
Oh, Jesus...
(backing away and --)
BOURNE
Please. I don't want to scare you.
MARIE
It's a little late for that.
BOURNE
I've got a situation here and --
MARIE
Get the fuck away from my car.
BOURNE
I'll give you ten thousand dollars
to drive me to Paris.
MARIE
Great. You know what? I'll give you
ten gazillion dollars to get the
fuck away from me before I start
screaming my head off.
BOURNE
You don't want the police any more
than I do.
BOURNE tosses cash -- a stack of hundreds -- across the car
into her hands -- she catches it. Looks at it.
MARIE
Jesus...
BOURNE
Get me out of here. Please.
MARIE looking at him. At the money. Back at him, and --
Establishing shot. A grand house. PIANO MUSIC over this --
someone butchering a piece by Haydn and --
Meet CASTEL. He's thirty-five. Slender. Clean-cut. Easy to
miss. He's here alone. Reading the paper. Sipping espresso.
And then, HIS E-PHONE PAGER starts pulsing -- hum -- hum --
The little red car parked. MARIE pacing around. BOURNE poring
over a map spread out over the hood.
MARIE
So what's in Paris?
BOURNE
I want to go home.
MARIE
For twenty thousand dollars.
BOURNE looks back from the map.
BOURNE
I said ten thousand.
MARIE
You have blood on your pants.
BOURNE
Okay.
(beat)
Twenty thousand. Ten now. Ten there.
MARIE
No. No, that was too easy --
(pacing away --)
BOURNE
Wait up --
(after her now --)
-- just wait up --
MARIE
-- get the fuck out of here -- all
this money, this crazy offer, I mean
give me a fucking break with this,
this is --
(stopping because--)
BOURNE just grabbed her. Both of them shocked that he's done
this. He immediately pulls back.
BOURNE
Look, I want a ride to Paris.
(wide open now)
That's all I want. I swear.
MARIE
You swear?
(cold here)
That's great. I feel so much better
now.
BOURNE
I don't want anything but a ride.
All I want to do is go home.
Silence now. She looks back. Measuring him.
MARIE
You could buy a car for twenty grand.
You could buy this car.
BOURNE
I don't want to go alone. I want you
to drive me to Paris. Like we're a
couple. Like we're a couple and we're
travelling together. That's all we're
doing.
MARIE
And I don't get hurt. I get twenty
thousand dollars and I don't get
hurt.
BOURNE
I won't hurt you.
MARIE
What if I say no?
BOURNE
Then I'll find another ride.
CASTEL through the streets on a motorcycle. Whipping to a
stop -- stepping off the bike in front of --
U-STORE-IT STORAGE WAREHOUSE.
The little red car driving through The Alps.
APFEL emerges from the bank. Leaving work. Turns the corner
into a quiet side street and --
Up ahead, here comes another guy in a suit. It's MANHEIM
walking toward us, deep into a cell phone conversation. Barely
noticing Apfel as they get closer and --
As they pass -- MANHEIM -- it's completely out of the blue --
he's jabbing the cellphone down into Apfel's shoulder and --
APFEL -- no clue -- already clutching at the coronary
exploding in his chest -- dead before his body hits the street
and --
MANHEIM -- still walking -- he's never broken stride -- and
as he goes he's fiddling with the cellphone and --
INSERT -- THE CELLPHONE -- MANHEIM'S HANDS working to retract
a syringe into the device and --
MANHEIM striding away. Disappearing into Zurich...
A MINI-MOTORCADE driving towards Neuilly. Two security cars.
A van full of kids and mothers. And one big Mercedes stretch.
A drone barn. Practically on the runway.
Beautiful morning. The red car parked along the road. BOURNE
alone in the passenger seat. Deep asleep. Nestled there.
And then, he wakes suddenly. Starts. Freaked for a moment.
Instantly feeling for the red bag. There it is in his lap.
He looks around and --
MARIE sitting away from the car. She's got a loaf of bread.
A soda. Smoking a butt. Same clothes, but her make-up's been
washed away. Clean. Simple. Gorgeous.
BOURNE steps out. Morning legs.
MARIE
I needed a break.
BOURNE
Where are we?
MARIE
We're about an hour away.
BOURNE
I can't believe I slept.
MARIE
You were tired. Here...
(bread and soda --)
For twenty-thousand I like to throw
in breakfast.
(he takes it)
So what do you dream about?
BOURNE
I dream I'm asleep. I dream that I'm
asleep and I can't wake up.
(he takes a hit from
her smoke and coughs --)
I don't think I smoke.
Another silence. She's watching him.
MARIE
You ever think maybe you have a
family?
BOURNE
I thought about it. I don't know.
She looks away. Was she hoping for another answer?
MARIE
I guess it's like Christmas every
day for you, huh?
THE LITTLE RED CAR cruising through town.
WINDOW SHATTERING! -- CASTEL -- in a cloud of broken glass --
sixty feet above the street --
Falling and falling and...
IMPACT! -- landing on the roof of a parked car and --
A CROWD is gathered around CASTEL'S BODY. Rubberneckers and
people pointing up to the broken window -- THE CONCIERGE
running out to the street and getting the news and THE SOUND
OF SIRENS bleeding in from the distance and --
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO FIND
THE LITTLE RED CAR pulling out of the alley. Turning away
from the scene. Disappearing into the streets of Paris --
BOURNE and MARIE stashing the red car.
Funky. Out of the way. Cash and carry. No-questions-asked
kind of flop. Our establishing shot somehow includes THE
PROPRIETOR and HIS DOG.
Walk and talk. BOURNE and MARIE leaving the hotel fast. He's
on alert -- always on alert now -- making sure they're not
being watched. And she's excited and pumped -- she did it! --
she's got the hotel record in hand --
MARIE
You stayed there five times in the
past six months. But I didn't have
time -- I could only get the bill
from the last stay -- you were there
for two days. Some room service --
there's half a dozen phone calls
here so that's someth--
BOURNE
(cutting her off)
Who paid the bill?
MARIE
It's a company... MPG Capital.
BOURNE on the pay phone. MARIE behind him at the bar. He's
got a pad and paper. This is all business.
BOURNE
Well, where are you? Where am I
calling?
TELEPHONE VOICE
This is an answering service, sir.
The company's located in Southampton,
but --
BOURNE
-- this is a tire dealership, right?
TELEPHONE VOICE
No sir, this is a navigational chart
registry. I'm afraid you have the
wrong number.
Dial tone. BOURNE making a note. And as he does --
TIME CUT -- one minute later -- call number two --
NEW VOICE (OVER)
(French, male, hassled)
Marseille-Tropez Marina, how can I
help you?
BOURNE
Hey, so this is the Marina, right?
NEW VOICE
Yes, sir. Can I help you?
BOURNE
(he's got the number)
This is the one in Marseille, right?
NEW VOICE
(Last time I looked.)
TIME CUT -- one minute later -- call number three --
OPERATOR RECORDING (OVER)
The number you have dialed has been
disconnected. If you think you've
reached this message in error--
TIME CUT -- one minute later -- last call --
RECORDED VOICE (OVER)
"You've reached the office of Simon
Rawlins at Alliance Security Maritime
Division. Paris office hours are
from nine a.m. to six p.m. If this
is an emergency, please call our
twenty-four hour help line at..."
BOURNE hangs up. Scribbles down the number. Backing away and --
Monolithic tech. Reflection city.
Moments after the morgue. BOURNE striding away. MARIE
struggling to keep up. And BOURNE is different now -- zoning
in -- he's close -- he's hardening --
MARIE
What are you doing? --
(he's scaring her)
-- Jason -- stop -- talk to me...
BOURNE ignoring her -- ripping through the Alliance Security
brochures -- scanning them as he walks --
MARIE
-- I don't know what you're doing
and you're scaring me -- what are
you looking for? -- what just happened
in there? --
BOURNE
Nykwana Wombosi.
(he stops, holding up
the brochure --)
MARIE
What is that?
BOURNE
It's a name. Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty
million dollar yacht. He's the proud
owner of an Alliance Security package.
(handing her the
brochure --)
He also paid a visit to the morgue
to see John Michael Kane.
(the ripped-out page --)
MARIE
What does that mean?
(but he's walking
again --)
Jason, what does that mean?
(she's trying to catch
up, but he's walking
really fast --)
Jason, please... who is he?
BOURNE
I don't know.
(he's not turning
back again --)
MARIE
So what are we doing?
BOURNE
Go back to the hotel.
MARIE just stops. Reeling.
BOURNE walking away. Into Paris night and --
THE PROFESSOR -- A MOTORCYCLE -- screaming through traffic
and --
BOURNE live. On the street. Bathed in a streetlight. Staring
up at a security camera.
Total hero moment.
I'm here. I'm waiting. I know you're watching.
Confusion to say the least -- WOMBOSI -- pistol in hand --
moving as fast as he can through the clutter -- KIDS
scattering as he follows DEAUVAGE -- racing for THE SECURITY
ROOM --
THE PROFESSOR on the speeding cycle -- closing in fast and --
BOURNE standing there as the FRONT GATE opens. The moment.
The big deep breath. He's walking in --
THE PROFESSOR in position -- roof of the house next door --
hum -- hum -- hum --
It's the E-PHONE PAGER -- he's just been activated and --
THE HOTEL BACK DOOR -- kicked open -- BOURNE coming out of
the house -- coming hard -- and --
The small courtyard is empty -- but now the ALARM is going
off -- and BOURNE turns back to MARIE -- races to grab her
as --
RATATATAT -- The FRONT DOOR -- WINDOWS -- ARE SHREDDED and --
here comes the PROFESSOR.
BOURNE
xxxxxx
MARIE
xxxxxx
And now they are running, across this little courtyard. To a
wall -- BOURNE is up, on it -- reaching down for MARIE --
grabbing her -- swinging her over the wall as --
ABM!!! The PROFESSOR SHOOTS.
BOURNE
Go!
MARIE takes off running. BOURNE leans over the wall, FIRES
BACK TWICE -- RATATAT -- The WALL IS SHREDDED. BOURNE takes
off running -- reloading on the fly.
Rounds a bend, is chambering two rounds when he sees -- a
WOMAN is in her kitchen -- staring at him -- no time to
explain -- he turns back --
The PROFESSOR is just vaulting over the wall. BOURNE FIRES
TWICE -- BAM! BAM! But the spray is too wide from this
distance. Windows are shattered to both sides of him but --
the PROFESSOR stumbles but keeps going -- blood on his face
now -- RATATAT --
BOURNE has to move. Reloading his almost useless gun. Reaching
MARIE -- facing a choice and they climb a wall -- FLOWER
POTS EXPLODE around them but they make it -- now --
RUNNING IN A LABYRINTH -- right -- then left -- through a
small staircase. LEAPING a wall -- landing on a STEEP ROOF --
sliding, falling, crashing to the ground in --
A SMALL COURTYARD -- steep walls on all sides. But there's a
large window -- and it's open. And they step through and
find themselves --
The first thing we notice is noise. The street is burgeoning
with life. The second thing we notice are SIRENS. POLICE
CARS approaching. BOURNE and MARIE head down the street,
blending in.
Up ahead -- TWO POLICE CARS snaking through traffic. BOURNE
steers them off this crowded street.
BOURNE
xxxxxx
MARIE
xxxxxx
And BOURNE and MARIE are hurrying down this street when --
BAM -- The PROFESSOR comes out of a building -- across and
down the street. No time to hide -- he's seen them -- he's
FIRING.
BOURNE tackles MARIE to the ground behind a car. RATATAT --
The PROFESSOR is literally shredding it. And now BOURNE is
moving --
MARIE
What are you doing?
And BOURNE is on the offensive. BAM! BAM! Moving towards the
PROFESSOR who is ducking behind cars on the other side.
They are shredding the street -- FIRING ruthlessly at each
other and -- NOW THE POLICE ARE HERE -- BLOCKING both ends
of the street. GUNS are drawn -- BOURNE's vulnerable on two
flanks. The COPS are YELLING. And now --
THE PROFESSOR BLASTS the COPS -- And now things have changed.
THREE WAY FIREFIGHT and BOURNE grabs MARIE and they dive
into --
And BOURNE and MARIE are running. And he is reaching into
his pocket -- fishing around -- and just as he pulls out the
car keys -- we recognize this as the street they parked their
car on and --
BY MARIE'S CAR
BOURNE unlocks the door -- pops MARIE's open. And --
THERE'S A COP -- yelling at them and -- BOURNE hits the gas --
they fly out of their parking space -- BAM!! The COP fires,
shattering their windshield and there -- up ahead -- THE
PROFESSOR coming out -- about to FIRE -- BOURNE aims for him --
forces him to dive out of the way and -- ONE QUICK MOVE around
a TRUCK and they are free.
HIGH SPEED CAR CHASE. And BOURNE better do some fancy driving
because here comes the PROFESSOR -- and he's a lot faster --
much better armed.
COPS are mobilizing -- swarming into this area and --
BACK TO THE CAR CHASE --
BOURNE and MARIE pick up a few cops on their tail -- shed
all of them -- the last car goes into an EXPLOSIVE FLIP --
the PROFESSOR is now right behind them. And now we are into --
CRAZY CAR CHASE WITH COPS RIGHT ON THEIR TAIL
BOURNE, MARIE and the PROFESSOR leave a trail of totaled
cars that the cops have to try and navigate through -- finally
saying fuck it and hitting a few cars themselves and now we
are into --
CAR CHASE THROUGH NARROW STREETS
MARIE'S CAR and the MOTORCYCLE can pass where the police
cars cannot. BOURNE may be able to shed the cops, but not
the PROFESSOR. And now one quick move and they are --
Racing against traffic up the Seine. Past the Louvre. COPS
pursuing on the other side of the river. BOURNE and the
PROFESSOR leaving behind a trail of carnage. And now --
The PROFESSOR is pulling up along side them -- one lane over.
Both swerving to avoid oncoming cars and --
MARIE FIRES -- TWICE -- TAKES out a few windshields. The
PROFESSOR fires at the same time -- MARIE'S CAR DOOR -- GONE --
she's totally exposed but --
THE PROFESSOR -- his BIKE is SPOUTING GAS -- one of the
pellets nailed his tank.
BOURNE AND MARIE --
MARIE
xxxxxx
THE PROFESSOR --
No problem -- he's unwrapping a piece of duct tape from the
barrel of his gun -- two seconds and the hole is patched and --
BOURNE AND MARIE -- the side of the car is completely gone --
the PROFESSOR is gaining -- across the river dozens of police
cars are racing alongside. Many more can be seen on their
side -- a road block ahead -- running out of options and --
BOURNE turns hard -- crashes over the sidewalk and flies
down a side street. A POLICE CAR pulls out behind them --
the PROFESSOR can't stop -- skidding hard, turning the bike
sideways, skidding out -- sliding across the ground and
BAMMM!!! SMASHING into a GLASS PHONE BOOTH which shatters.
And he's up -- lifting up his bike and --
BOURNE AND MARIE
SIX POLICE CARS on their tail -- more joining. Every street
they look down has POLICE CARS racing in parallel. Running
out of options and in the background --
THE PROFESSOR is back in the game -- passing the police cars
and up ahead --
THE ROAD IS BLOCKED. POLICE ROAD BLOCK -- cops with guns.
Gotta act quick and -- BOURNE turns hard left -- there's a
metro staircase -- only way out and --
THEY BOUNCE down the stairs. CRASH through the doors down
below.
THE FIRST POLICE CAR -- no way he's following. SLAMMING on
his brakes. SKIDDING to a halt -- SKIDDING sideways -- gonna
stop in time -- just at the edge of the steps and then --
THE SECOND POLICE CAR isn't braking -- T-BONES the first car --
BAM!!! -- sends it rolling sideways down the steps until it
crashes to a halt at the bottom -- upside down.
THE PROFESSOR -- he's turning -- heading for a different set
of stairs. BOURNE AND MARIE -- crashing through the turnstiles --
people diving out of their way and --
AT THE STAIRCASE -- THE WINDOW of the POLICE CAR is kicked
out and -- TWO VERY ANGRY COPS emerge -- pull their guns out --
head into the station. BOURNE and MARIE's world just got a
lot more dangerous and --
THE PROFESSOR is racing down the other staircase -- an up
escalator -- people diving out of the way as --
BOURNE and MARIE slalom through the station -- suddenly --
there's the PROFESSOR -- parallel corridor -- metal barricades
keep them separated. PROFESSOR FIRING.
UP AHEAD -- a horizon line -- BOURNE guns it -- a steep
staircase and -- THEY FLY down the steps -- landing on --
THE METRO PLATFORM
The PROFESSOR lands on the other side -- both racing down
the platform -- PROFESSOR tearing up the wall behind them
and -- HERE COMES A TRAIN -- on BOURNE and MARIE's side --
travelling the opposite way -- temporary refuge. Not for
long -- there's no way out on this end of the platform. They
skid to a halt -- just as --THE TRAIN DOORS OPEN -- STARTLED
STRAPHANGERS stare at BOURNE and MARIE as they stop onto the
platform -- take off running.
THE PROFESSOR has to turn his bike around. He's quick -- but
it gives BOURNE and MARIE a two second head start.
BOURNE AND MARIE almost at the other end of the platform --
gunfire ripping up the windows behind them. Gonna go for the
steps -- but here come --
THE ANGRY COPS -- remember them? -- the ones who took the
ride down the steps -- they're firing now and --
BOURNE AND MARIE turn back -- the PROFESSOR is firing and
there is only one option --
THE SHATTERED TRAIN pulling into the station -- doors opening --
SCREAMS ECHOING through the station from up the platform and --
BOURNE and MARIE getting off the last car and --
Two minutes later. BOURNE and MARIE -- exhausted -- beat --
Everything all at once --
BOURNE
Take this.
She turns. He's holding the locker key.
BOURNE
Take it.
But she doesn't move.
MARIE
And that's it?
BOURNE
If you're lucky.
(it's hanging there)
Take it.
(beat)
There's enough in there to make a
life. Any life. Just get out now.
Get low. Stay low.
(beat)
Take it.
She takes it. Staring at him. Simply refusing to cry.
MARIE
What was I thinking, right?
BOURNE
I can't protect you anymore.
MARIE
What about you?
BOURNE
I'm gonna find the end of this.
(beat)
I can't protect you.
MARIE takes one last look. And she's running --
BOURNE hangs there a moment -- listening to her go -- and
then he pulls out THE E-PHONE PAGER. And it's pulsing like
crazy.
BOURNE flips open the shell. There's a keypad in there.
Holding it. Like a missing organ.
CONKLIN done with the dirty work -- out into the street --
As he's about to leave -- he hears a sound -- a familiar
sound -- hum -- hum -- hum --
He cross the street -- looks down to the Quai below --
Holy shit -- there's one of his E-PHONE PAGERS --
He goes down -- picks it up --
And now --
BOURNE
What did you do to me?
CONKLIN wheels around. There he is. Right behind him.
CONKLIN
What did I do? What've you done? Do
you have any idea? Any conception?
What you've destroyed? Do you have
any idea how much time and work --
how many people have their lives
wrapped up in this?
So now you know.
BOURNE
Are you Treadstone?
CONKLIN
Am I Treadstone? Me?
(peering at him closely
now --)
What the hell're you talking about?
BOURNE showing nothing -- or is he trying too hard not to?
BOURNE
What did you do to me?
CONKLIN
What did I do? I spent thirty million
dollars on you. I spent three years
finding you -- four years training
you --
(incredulous)
What did I do?
(staring now)
What in the name of God have you
been doing, Jason?
BOURNE
I don't know.
CONKLIN
They're right about you, aren't they?
You're fried.
(on it now)
You really don't know what's going
on, do you?
BOURNE
I know you've been trying to kill
me.
CONKLIN
Of course. We had to try. We didn't
know what was wrong.
(warming to this --)
We didn't know you were in trouble.
BOURNE
So now you know.
CONKLIN
So it's time to go home.
BOURNE
That's all I get?
CONKLIN
We'll make you better. We can put
the pieces back. We can do that.
BOURNE
I don't think so.
CONKLIN
We have to go home, Jason.
BOURNE
Jason Bourne is dead.
CONKLIN
There never was a Jason Bourne.
(that gets him)
You have to come with me. It's the
only way. We can give it back to
you...
BOURNE
Keep it.
(and he's walking --)
CONKLIN
Jason...
(trying to follow --)
They can't let you go...
BOURNE
That'll be their second worst mistake.
And with that, BOURNE scrambles up a wall -- like it's nothing --
CONKLIN just left there -- on the Quai -- in the dark --
BOURNE walking away -- faster and faster --
MANHEIM -- A CAR PARKED IN THE DARKNESS -- sitting alone
with his briefcase. Opening it. There's his gun.
BOURNE -- walking -- deeper into the darkness and --
MANHEIM -- in the dark car -- loading the weapon -- calm --
steady -- methodical and --
BOURNE -- walking and --
MANHEIM -- stepping out of the car -- closing the door quietly --
deep in the shadows and --
BOURNE -- still coming -- the darkest part of the path just
ahead and --
MANHEIM -- raising the gun and --
THE CAMERA SPINS TO HIS TARGET AND --
IT'S CONKLIN! -- just climbing back up from the Quai --
MANHEIM -- the gun -- phftt -- phftt -- phftt --
CONKLIN -- three holes -- head -- heart -- gut -- his body
dropping like a stone beside his car.
MANHEIM walks over. Looks down. Point blank -- phftt -- that
makes it four and --
BOURNE still walking. And he's just gonna keep on going, as
we --
DISSOLVE TO:
Gorgeous Summer day. A SCOOTER RENTAL SHACK near the beach.
SIX MONTHS LATER
MARIE coming out of the shack with two helmets. Handing them
to A HAPPY COUPLE waiting there on their scooters.
THE HAPPY COUPLE rides off.
MARIE turns back and --
There's BOURNE. A new look. A smile.
MARIE
Can I help you?
BOURNE
This your store?
MARIE
Yes.
BOURNE
Think I could rent a scooter?
MARIE
You have ID?
BOURNE
Not really.
Beat. He smiles.
MARIE
It's not a problem.
Her turn to smile. And we...
