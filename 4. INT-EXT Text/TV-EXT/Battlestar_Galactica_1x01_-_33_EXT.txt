    A SQUADRON of Galactica s VIPERS are taking up positions in a 
    defensive formation.  In the far b.g., GALACTICA and the RAG-
  TAG FLEET can be seen in their own defensive formation 
    (Galactica deployed to cover the civilian ships).

    Several of the other civilian ships JUMP AWAY, leaving 
    Colonial One and a few others.


    Hold a beat on the empty starfield... then a CYLON BASE SHIP 
  JUMPS into view.  It LAUNCHES MISSILES immediately.

    Eyes closed.  His eyes fly OPEN at the sound of the Pilot s 
    VOICE coming over the P.A.:

                  Ladies and gentlemen...

  Lee and the rest of the Vipers kick in their burners and leap 
    forward.

                  civies and don t stray beyond the 
                  recovery line.

  NEW ANGLE - THE CYLONS

    Cylon fighters are swooping in toward the Vipers.  Some 
    LAUNCH NUCLEAR MISSILES.

                                LEE (WIRELESS) (cont d)
                  Inbound nukes!


  The Vipers and the Cylons are blazing away at each other -- 
    some Vipers trying to keep the Raiders at bay and others 
    concentrating on the nuclear missiles while Galactica engages 
  the Basestar.

    COLONIAL ONE

  And the rest of the civilian FLEET Jump away, leaving only 
    Galactica and her Vipers to face the Cylons.


    JUMPS into view -- the other civilian ships are in the b.g. 
    which has a PLANET nearby (or some other unique feature to 
    distinguish it from the area of space they just left).


  The last few Vipers are making combat landings on the 
    Galactica.


  The ship JUMPS, leaving the Cylons to shoot at nothing...

    SUPER:             Cylon Occupied Caprica


    A MAN is running through the forest -- he s hobbled by an 
    injury as he crashes through the woods. 

  TWO CYLON CENTURIANS (the mechanistic types) are crashing 
    through the trees -- chasing the man.

  The Man dives/falls over a log or deadfall and as he rolls 
  over we see that it s HELO (Sharon Valerii s flight officer 
  she was forced to leave behind in the pilot) and he doesn t 
  look too good.  It s cold out here, his breath forming vapor 
  in the air, but Helo s sweating and having trouble breathing -
    - radiation sickness starting to set in.

  Helo blinks as beads of sweat trickle down his forehead and 
  into his eyes and looks back --

  -- the Cylons are charging toward his position.

  Helo grabs a DETONATOR REMOTE and DOUBLE-CLICKS the trigger:

    A CLAYMORE EXPLODES directly in front of the Cylons, blowing 
    them off their feet.

  The woods are silent except for the smoldering, crackling 
    sounds of the destroyed Cylons.

    Helo gets up, catches his breath, begins to cautiously limp 
  out into the open --

  -- Moments later, he s standing over the Cylons -- one 
    completely destroyed and inert, the other still mechanically 
    jerking and whirring, trying to REPAIR its shattered body.

    Helo looks down at the Cylon for a beat, then resets his 
    handweapon and aims it at the Cylon s head.

  Pulls the trigger.

    EXPLOSION --

                                                                          CUT TO:

  clock hanging on the wall of:


    Helo grimaces as he inserts a SYRINGE NEEDLE into a vein and 
    pushes the plunger.  He finishes the dose and checks the 
    label on the syringe BOX.  Amid the small printing and 
    instructions, we can read the heading: ANTI-RADIATION DOSAGE.

  He puts the syringe back in the box and slips it into one of 
  his flight suit pockets.  

    Helo looks up --

    HELO S POV - LONG SHOT - NUMBER SIX

  Far in the distance, Number Six is standing in the trees.

    HELO

    Freezes.  He doesn t recognize her, of course, nor does he 
    have any idea that the Cylons now look like human beings.  
  All he knows is that there s someone standing out there in 
  the woods and if they haven t seen him yet, they definitely 
  will if he makes a sudden move.  His hand slowly, slowly 
    begins to reach for his handweapon, just in case.  Helo 
    suddenly becomes aware of something else.  He doesn t turn 
  his head, but we see...

  ... a CYLON CENTURIAN standing right behind Helo, its weapons 
  at the ready.

  They have him.

                                                                        FADE OUT.

    A SIGNAL LIGHT begins FLASHING a message to the transport.

  The Olympic Carrier is continuing to head toward the fleet, 
    even as the Raptor FLASHES signals to it.


  The two Vipers are weaving and wagging their wings in front 
  of the Olympic Carrier, trying to get them to stop.

                                SHARON (WIRELESS)
                  Olympic Carrier -- you are ordered

    Kara s Viper FIRES a VOLLEY across the bows of the Olympic 
    Carrier, which shows no sign of slowing down or altering 
    course.

                  Olympic Carrier -- if you do not

  The Vipers are shadowing the transport as it careens toward 
  the Galactica and the other civilian ships.

    Peel away together and sweep around toward the rear of the 
    transport.


  The Vipers FIRE at the transport ship and it is DESTROYED.

  -- The reality of what they ve just done weighs on the faces 
  of Lee, Kara, and Sharon for a long beat.


  The Vipers swing around and the Raptor joins up with them as 
    they head for the distant Galactica.

                                                                        FADE OUT.

    Cruising safely in space.


    Helo is lying on the ground, his hands and feet bound behind 
  his back, his head covered with a canvas BAG.  A woman s HAND 
    reaches into frame and touches him -- he starts, tenses -- 
  she reaches up and gently pulls the bag off his head.  Helo 
    gasps for air in the chilly forest and sees -- NUMBER SIX 
    looking down at him with curious eyes.

                                NUMBER SIX
                  Are you alive?

    Helo blinks, isn t sure he heard her right.

                                NUMBER SIX (cont d)
                  Are you alive?

  At something of a loss, Helo falls back on his training:

                  right.  I m a friend.

  She leans down, SNAPS his restraints quickly and easily.  He 
    tries to jump up, but his legs fail him and he goes down.

                                NUMBER SIX (cont d)
                  Your legs are asleep.

  Helo rubs his legs as she stands over him.

  She reaches down, tips his head up towards her, leans in to 
    kiss him -- EXPLOSION.

    Number Six collapses on the ground, a BLOODY WOUND in the 
    middle of her back.  Helo looks up in shock to see-- SHARON 
    VALERII standing in the forest, the weapon still smoking in 
  her hand.

                                HELO
                  Sharon!

    Sharon runs toward him, grabs his arm, yanks him to his feet.

                        (urgent)

                  Not now, it s not safe here.  Let s 
                  move, Mister.

  Her weapon at the ready, her head constantly looking for 
    threats in any direction, Sharon leads Helo into the forest.
