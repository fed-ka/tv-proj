      A bucolic, leafy, residential street in suburban Virginia.  
      Think American Beauty.  Joggers pass.  A dog barks.

      PUSH IN on a large Southern Colonial with a two-car garage 
      and a wraparound porch.  The RUST-COLORED FRONT PORCH SWING 
      squeaks in the wind.  The sound of a TV drifts out...   



      The Presidential motorcade pulls away from the hospital.


      I/E. PRESIDENTIAL LIMO - DAY55

      Kincaid sits in back with a handful of ADVISORS and his wife 
      MARY.  The First Lady is anxious.                                            12/6/124


                                  MARY
                    ...you don t have to go through 
                    with this, Paul.  You could still 
                    get the Chief Surgeon at Johns 
                    Hopkins.

                                  PRESIDENT KINCAID
                    You think I m a fool?

                                  CREASY 
                    I think you re a genius, sir.  

      HENRY CREASY, his Chief-of-Staff, is an old school operative 
      in the mold of James Carville.   

                                  CREASY (CONT D)
                    This puts you way out front on 
                    health care, makes you bulletproof 
                    with patient rights  groups, and 
                    women voters are gonna love this 
                    lady doctor.  She s a great choice.  

    The First Lady glares.  Kincaid just chuckles.

                                  PRESIDENT KINCAID
                    Glad to know you care so much about 
                    my health Henry.

                                  CREASY
                    Your approval rating is the measure 
                    of your political health, Mr. 
                    President.   And this is just what 
                    the doctor ordered.

      Kincaid turns to wife, gently reassuring:

                                  PRESIDENT KINCAID
                    It s a routine surgery.  She s the 
                    top surgeon at the hospital.  And 
                    it sends a good signal.

                                  CREASY
                          (grins)
                    Call it a win-win.

    The MOTORCADE PULLS plows through traffic on Connecticut Ave.  
      TILT UP to reveal the Washington monument looming ahead.

                                                                            CUT TO:                                            12/6/125


      A PAIR OF BLACK WORK BOOTS MARCH ACROSS A MARBLE FLOOR.

      WE HEAR A WOMAN whimpering. The BOOTS approach and WE FIND 
      the WHIMPERING WOMAN, on her knees.  The barrel of an AR-15 
      ASSAULT RIFLE is placed against her head:

                                  MAN (O.S.)
                    Shut.  Up.

      She does.  REVEAL WE ARE...



      A phalanx of Metro police, SWAT and federal agents.

      FBI Agent DUNCAN CARLISLE (dangerous, the kind of guy you 
      want on your side) stands at the make-shift command post.  

                                  DUNCAN (INTO HIS WALKIE)
                    Nice shot.

      A POLICE CAPTAIN comes storming up--

                                  POLICE CAPTAIN
                    What the hell was that?  Who gave 
                    the order to shoot?!                                              12/6/126


                                  DUNCAN
                    I did.

                                  POLICE CAPTAIN
                    Who the hell do you think you are?

                                  DUNCAN
                    The Agent in charge now. 

      He lifts the badge around his neck.

                                  POLICE CAPTAIN
                    This situation is about to explode 
                    and you just threw fuel on the 
                    fire!  I was about to open a line 
                    of communication to start 
                      negotiations.

      He waves a CELL PHONE in front of Duncan s face.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Perfect.  I ll take it from here. 
                    Thanks.

      He snatches the CELL PHONE from the Captain s hand and walks 
      into the middle of the intersection...


      I/E. BANK - CONTINUOUS88

      INSIDE THE BANK the Thug Leader has restored order. A DESK 
      PHONE RINGS.  He snatches it up. 

                                  THUG LEADER
                    You lying cop, son-of-bitch!  I 
                    warned you if a single policeman 
                    tried any-- 

                                  DUNCAN (OVER THE PHONE)
                    The police are no longer in charge.  
                    I m FBI Special Agent Duncan 
                    Carlisle and from this point on, I 
                    am your last, best and only chance 
                    of you walking out of that bank 
                    alive today.  

      The Thug Leader is thrown by Duncan s tone.   

                                  THUG LEADER
                    I have 14 hostages in here! We are 
                    demanding safe transport and--                                            12/6/127


                                  DUNCAN (OVER THE PHONE)
                    Release ten hostages as a sign of 
                    good faith.  Then we ll talk. 

      Click.  The Thug Leader looks up at Thug #2.

                                  THUG LEADER
                    He hung up on me.



      Thirteen hostages stream out the front door.  Tears of relief 
      as they are hustled to safety by police.   

      DUNCAN, the POLICE CAPTAIN and others at the command center.  
      The cell phone is patched into a speaker.

                                  THUG LEADER (V.O.)
                    ...that s all the hostages free 
                    except one.  I kept my end of the 
                    deal.  Where s my transport?

                                  DUNCAN
                    Pulling up outside.  It ll take you 
                    straight to the private airfield, 
                    as agreed.   

      Duncan gives a nod and a BLUE 4X4 pulls up in front of the 
      bank.  The DRIVER keeps the engine running. 

                                  THUG LEADER (V.O.)
                    Okay, I m coming out.  Everybody 
                    stay back or this guy s a dead man.

      ALL EYES on the front door of the bank as it inches open...                                              12/6/129


          A frightened-looking BUSINESSMAN in a rumpled suit exits 
      first, his hands held behind his back. The MASKED THUG 
      follows close behind, using him as a human shield.

      COPS, FEDS, SNIPERS watch helplessly as the two figures inch 
      down the steps toward the vehicle.

      ON DUNCAN as he stares intently. Then... he steps around the 
      perimeter and starts toward them!    

                                  DUNCAN
                    Hey!  Hold it right there!

      The BUSINESSMAN and the MASKED THUG look up; the 
      Businessman s eyes go wide as he sees Duncan lift his gun--

      He doesn t have a clear shot on the Masked Thug but-- 

      BANG! BANG!  Duncan shoots the BUSINESSMAN instead.  Screams 
    and shouts of surprise-- POLICE IN BODY-ARMOR spring forward 
    and wrestle the MASKED THUG to the ground.

      DUNCAN walks calmly forward.  He arrives as they pull the ski 
      mask off the THUG to REVEAL... a terrified civilian with his 
      mouth duct-taped shut and his hands tied together!

    PAN OVER to the  BUSINESSMAN  who s hands were not tied 
      behind his back but in fact concealed a pistol.    

                                  POLICE CAPTAIN
                    He switched places with the 
                    hostage...

                                  DUNCAN
                    Boots didn t match his suit.

      ANGLE ON the Businessman s BOOTS... the ones we saw earlier 
    on the Thug Leader.  Duncan turns to go.  

                                  POLICE CAPTAIN
                    You shot a man based on that?  What 
                    if you d been wrong?

                                  DUNCAN
                          (keeps walking)
                    I wasn t.



      A UTILITY VAN is parked across the street.

      ARCHER PETIT (wiry and quick-tempered) and MARIA GONZALES 
      (pretty, tough) are staking out the house.  A NEIGHBOR exits 
      a house next door and walks to his car...

                                  ARCHER
                    What do you think that place would 
                    go for these days?  One point-six?  
                      One-seven?                                            12/6/1213


                                  MARIA
                          (slight accent)
                    Don t know, don t care.  You re not 
                    paying me that well for this gig.

                                  ARCHER
                      Definitely over one-five.  What 
                    kind of a jackass lives in a house 
                    worth that kind of money and drives 
                    a car made in Korea?  It s 
                    downright un-American.

                                  MARIA
                    That s funny coming from a man who 
                    has fought under the color of how 
                    many flags?

                                  ARCHER
                    It s called the free market.  It s 
                      a fundamentally American concept.

      The neighbor drives off in his Hyundai.  Archer begins 
      loading up a tool kit with mysterious high-tech gear.

                                  ARCHER (CONT D)
                    This ll be an in-and-out operation, 
                    fully compartmentalized.  I.D. by 
                    code number only for the next 
                      twenty-four hours. I m three.   
                    You re four.

                                  MARIA
                          (mock offended)
                    I m a four? 

                                  ARCHER
                    You re a ten, honey, that s why 
                    it s such a clever code name.

      He pulls on a repairman s jacket.  Goes to exit the van--  

                                  MARIA
                    Hey... do you trust this guy we re 
                    working for?

                                  ARCHER
                    With my life.

      Archer unwraps a piece of raw STEAK and gets out.  A dog 
      barks.  Archer crosses the street, makes sure nobody s 
      looking, then let s himself in the side-gate with a hidden 
      key.  A beat. The dog stops barking.                                            12/6/1214



      JAKE SANDERS and his friend KEVIN take advantage of the 
      sloped concrete to practice their skateboard moves.  

        A pimped-out Escalade with a thudding bass rolls up.  As the 
      boys turn to look the driver guns the engine! They leap back 
      as it skids to a halt.  Doors flies open--

      NICO (all sinew and menace) gets out of the driver s side.  A 
      couple of bad-looking BUDDIES follow him.  

                                  NICO
                    Hey. You weren t scared, were you?

      He marches right up to Jake... then breaks into a smile.     

                                  JAKE
                    No way, we knew it was you, Nico.

                                  NICO
                    Yeah right.  You like my new ride?
                          (turns to his crew)
                    Check it out.  These are my new 
                    proteg s here. Yorktown s finest.

      The teens chin nod to the crew.  Nico drapes an arm over 
      Jake s shoulder and walks with the boys.                                               12/6/1215


                                  NICO (CONT D)
                    So how s it going, young man? 

                                  JAKE
                    Great.  Crazy actually. We have 
                    kids coming to us now, seniors 
                    even, asking for a hook up. 

                                  KEVIN
                    We sold almost everything you gave 
                    us.

                                  NICO
                    You boys are gonna go far.  Get 
                    this done, and I ll take you to the 
                    next level. 

      He fakes a slap to Kevin s head-- makes him flinch.  He 
      laughs and heads back to his Escalade.  



      SOMEBODY S POV THROUGH A WINDSHIELD - as Ellen pulls up in 
      her Volvo.  Parks and walks up the front porch steps. 



      High school lacrosse practice. BRIAN is on the sideline, 
      changed into sweats, coach s whistle around his neck.

      Jake and Kevin are among the players, bringing up the rear as 
      the team runs laps.



      DUNCAN walks between the rows of Cherry Blossoms carrying a 
      CHILD S SPONGE-BOB BACKPACK.  He turns to see his five year-
      old daughter SAWYER meandering behind.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Sawyer, can you please walk with 
                    daddy?

      Sawyer shakes her head and stops.  On strike.  Duncan 
      surrenders and walks back to her.

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Come on Soy-Soy, don t you want to 
                    see grandpa?  I packed you a bunch 
                    of nice dresses...

      Opens the back pack to show her.

                                  SAWYER
                    I don t want those.  I want my red 
                    Hello Kitty dress!
                          (bursts into tears)
                    When is mommy coming home?  I want 
                    mommy!

      Duncan gets on his knees.  His heart breaks for her.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Do you know mommy and I met right 
                    here, under these trees?  They re 
                    her favorite in the whole world.
                          (Sawyer stops crying)
                    Aren t they beautiful?  

      BURTON DALY (aging warrior with plenty of game left in him) 
      sneaks up behind Sawyer and covers her eyes. She turns:

                                  SAWYER
                    Grandpa!

      She jumps into his arms.  He loves this little girl.

      MOMENTS LATER

      A wide shot of the two men standing to the side of a little 
      playground, watching Sawyer climb up a slide the wrong way.

                    Any change in her condition?

      Duncan shakes his head.  They both watch the little girl play 
      for a moment in silence.  Burton sighs heavily.                                            12/6/1220


                                  BURTON (CONT D)
                    Are you sure you want to do this?

                                  DUNCAN
                    I already am.

      The two men look at one another.  Burton embraces him.

                                  SAWYER (O.S.)
                    Is everything okay, Daddy?

      They separate and look down at the little girl standing 
      there.  Duncan smiles and bends to hug her good-bye.  He 
      holds her for an extra long beat.

                                  DUNCAN
                    I love you Soy-Soy.

      STAY ON DUNCAN as he watches Burton lead her away, holding 
      her tiny hand in his.  Duncan steels himself.



      Archer and Maria s VAN is now in shadow across the street.  
      Brian pulls up with Jake in a BMW.  Parks in the garage.



      The house is quiet.  The front porch swing sways slightly.  
      PAN TO the VAN parked across the street in shadow.

      WE HEAR A CELL PHONE RING. 

                                  ARCHER (V.O.)
                    This is three.  Go ahead.

                                  MAN (V.O.)
                    This is two.  Arriving on site.

      A NAVY TAHOE crosses the frame-- TRACK WITH THIS VEHICLE as 
      it passes the SANDERS  street and turns down the road 
      bordering the woods behind their house.

      It rolls to a halt ending in a CLOSE UP on the DRIVER: KRAMER 
      DALY (30s, slim, long hair).  He kills the lights.

                                  MAN/KRAMER
                          (into his earpiece)
                    We re in place.  

      INTERCUT - ARCHER and MARIA in the back of their VAN.   They 
      have guns prepped.   

                                  ARCHER
                    Copy that.  Targets are in place.  

      RESUME - AROUND BACK OF THE HOUSE

      Kramer takes a deep breath.  Reaches into a black bag in the 
      center console and takes out a mask.  A gun.  He turns toward 
      the person in the passenger seat who we haven t seen:

                                  KRAMER
                    Are you ready?

      PAN OVER TO REVEAL Number One is -- Duncan Carlisle.   

                                  DUNCAN
                    Let s do it.

      He holsters his gun and pulls on the MASK.  CUT TO BLACK.

      ACT OUT.                                            12/6/1225


      ACT ONE



      A HIGH VIEW of the HOUSE: the property backs onto a wooded 
      area with a generous quarter-acre set back, enclosed by a 
      high wood fence.  CAMERA DESCENDS through the trees, finds...

      DUNCAN and KRAMER, masked, in black, silently approach the 
      back gate. [Note: each mask will be slightly different, so we 
      can tell the Captors apart.] Duncan easily picks the lock.

                                  DUNCAN (INTO MIC)
                    This is number one.  We re in.

                                  ARCHER (V.O.)
                    Houston, we have a problem...


      I/E. VAN - NIGHT3636

      Archer is looking at the front of the house; he sees Danni 
      walking out the front door. 

                                  ARCHER (INTO HIS WALKIE) 
                    ...the girl just left the house.

      Maria looks up from loading cartridges into guns. 

                                  ARCHER (CONT D)
                    What s the call boss?   

      A beat.  Danni walks down the path toward the sidewalk.

                                  DUNCAN (V.O.)
                    The operation is a go.  Have Number 
                    Four follow the girl.  

      Maria hears the command as well.  She shrugs on a sweatshirt 
      and tucks a GUN behind her back  She moves to exit the van.  

                                  ARCHER
                    Hey.  Don t forget this...

      He tosses her a mask.  She takes it and slips out of the van. 



      IN THE BUSHES - Duncan stills the branch that Kramer swiped 
      with his duffel.  Off his hand signal they split up.

      TRACK WITH DUNCAN as he jogs in a crouch toward the back of 
      the house, careful to side-step the motion sensor for the 
      security light. He knows his way around.

      SIDE OF THE HOUSE - Duncan goes directly to a double hung 
      window at ground level.  It s unlocked.  He slides it open 
      and slips inside.  He leaves it open.                                            12/6/1227



      POV from across the street -- Danni enters the brightly lit 
      store.  Through the glass door WE SEE her glance around, 
      anxious not to be seen by anybody she knows. 



      Archer moves toward the house, mask in hand.  Glances 
      around... then heads for the side yard. 



      Jake steps out into the darkness, looking for his dog... 

                                  JAKE
                      Barkley...  Barkley!

      JAKE moves into the shrubbery, parting branches, pushing 
      deeper into the pools of shadow...

      HAND-HELD POV - approaching JAKE from behind, through the 
      leaves...

      JAKE freezes in his tracks as he sees -- Barkley s rear leg! 

                                  JAKE (CONT D)
                    Barkley!                                            12/6/1229


      Jake takes a step forward and sees the dog lying motionless 
      on his side, tongue out.  Suddenly he is grabbed from behind!  
      A powerful hand covers his mouth. 



      Maria follows Danni from a distance.  Danni slows as she 
      approaches her house, on edge.  She clutches her shoulder bag 
      and turns to look behind her.  Nobody.  She takes a breath.

      Danni goes to the garage.  Punches in the code and the door 
      rolls up. She disappears inside.  The door starts to close...                                             12/6/1230


      A lithe, dark figure darts from the shadows -- rolls 
      underneath the garage door like a ninja just before it shuts.  

      INSIDE THE GARAGE - MARIA rises.  As the garage door slowly 
      rolls shut behind her... she pulls on her mask. 



      All quiet on the suburban street outside.  Meanwhile...



      A car with a CAPITOL SECURITY LOGO on the side pulls up.  The 
      uniformed DRIVER gets out and approaches the front door. 



      WE SEE the DRIVER from behind, waiting, waiting... The porch 
      swing creaks in the wind. The Driver leans forward to ring 
      the doorbell again.  WE NOTE the GUN on his hip.  Finally--

      ELLEN opens the door partway. 

      INSIDE - REVEAL DUNCAN standing out of sight, gun in hand.                                            12/6/1240


                                  ELLEN
                    Good evening, is there a problem?

      REVERSE on the DRIVER S FACE for the first time; he is the 
      JANITOR we saw leaving Ellen s office at the hospital.  

      Ellen looks at him, puzzled for a moment. 

      QUICK FLASH - ELLEN s POV of the Janitor from earlier.

                                  ELLEN (CONT D)
                    You were in my office...

      The Driver hands her a manila envelope.  Then walks away. 

                                  DRIVER (INTO HIS RADIO)
                    4311 Woodlawn is clear.

      Duncan pulls a stunned Ellen back inside and shuts the door.  

                                  DUNCAN
                    Open it.

      Ellen looks down at the envelope in her hand.  She opens it 
      without thinking and pulls out--

      THE MISSING 8X10 PHOTO OF HER FAMILY, taken from her desk.  
      It s a holiday greeting that reads  from--  with all their 
      names listed.  Including Barkley the dog. 

                                  DUNCAN (CONT D)
                    Your dog s name is Barkley, not 
                    Rex; Danni does Tae Kwon Do 
                    Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5; you 
                    call your mother Irene every 
                    Saturday; Jake is allergic to 
                    peanuts.  Do I need to continue? We 
                    know everything about you.  We have 
                    eyes and ears everywhere.  We have 
                    thought of everything.  Are you 
                    starting to understand Ellen? 
                          (his eyes bore into hers)
                    This is your last warning.  

      She nods, shaking. It s a nightmare she can t wake up from.



        Establishing shot of the world s most famous residence.


      Insistent.  He punches in the code with shaking fingers and 
      opens it slowly.

                                  JAKE (CONT D)
                    Here.  Take whatever you want...

      He offers the box to Kramer who looks inside.  He sees the 
      cash.  The pot.  The cell phone.

      Kramer looks up at Jake.  His expression unreadable.                                            12/6/1246



      The sun comes up on what should be a peaceful suburban 
      enclave.



      The Secret Service advance team gets word over their ear-buds 
      that the President is on his way.  They begin clearing 
      vehicles and pedestrians from the entrance. 


      I/E. PRESIDENT S MOTORCADE - DAY8383

      Moving through morning traffic in D.C.

      The reflections zip by over President Kincaid s face as he 
      stares out the window.  In this private moment, we see the 
      anxiety in his eyes. 

      His wife reaches over and takes his hand.                                            12/6/1257


                                  MARY
                    You okay?

                                    KINCAID
                    Just using my brush with mortality 
                    as an excuse to indulge in morbid 
                      self-reflection...
                          (turns and smiles)
                    It will pass. 



      Ellen gets in her car.  Looks back at the house, then down at 
      the  ADVIL BOTTLE  in her hand.  When she lifts her eyes she 
      sees her reflection in the rear view mirror.  

      PUSH IN ON Ellen s eyes, staring into her reflection, looking 
      for an answer.  The wheels are turning in her head.  WE SEE a 
      flash of something... a decision made?                                              12/6/1259


      She shoves the Advil Bottle in her purse and pulls away.
