Play over this image.
One bikini beauty is singled out. She's a gorgeous
brunette named SIDNEY. Sidney stands facing camera
holding a TEC-9 and describing it.
SIDNEY
(to camera)
Hi, I'm Sidney. And I love to TEC-9.
The popular TEC-9 is advertised by
its makers as being tough as the
toughest customer.
SIDNEY'S STATISTICS: Age, height, measurements, date of
birth, appear at the bottom left-hand corner. As Sidney
continues her sales pitch/demonstration, a BLACK MAN'S
VOICE begins talking over the video.
BLACK MAN (O.S.)
That's a TEC-9. It's a cheap ass
spray gun outta South Miami.
After a CLOSEUP of the TEC-9, Sidney FIRES the weapon.
BLACK VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Cost three-eighty retail. I get them
for two hundred and sell 'em for
eight.
The store front window of Cherry Bail Bonds in Inglewood,
California. The name of the business is spelled out on
the window, which also includes a drawing of a fat red
cherry.
Ordell's BLACK MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE pulls up.
Ordell in the driver's seat. Louis in shotgun position.
Louis walks out of the office. He goes up to Ordell's
black Mercedes. He points the little black box at it. The
car goes BLEEP.
He gingerly approaches it, opens the door and climbs
inside.
Ordell stands outside the security gate of Beaumont's
Hollywood apartment.
EXTREME CLOSEUP - Ordell's lips talking into the intercom
speaker.
ORDELL
It's your benefactor, nigga. Buzz me
up.
EXTREME CLOSEUP - Beaumont's finger pressing the entry
button.
EXTREME CLOSEUP - The doorknob on the security gate,
BUZZING. Ordell's hand comes into frame twisting it open.
Beaumont opens his apartment door, fatty between his
fingers. He sees Ordell approach.
Ordell greets him, arms spread out in hug mode, with a
big smile across his face.
ORDELL
Look at you and your free ass. Come
over and give me a motherfuckin' hug.
Ordell and Beaumont embrace.
BEAUMONT
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious,
man. What the fuck can I say? Thank
you... thank you... thank you.
ORDELL
Who was there for your ass?
BEAUMONT
You were there for me.
ORDELL
Who?
BEAUMONT
You.
Laughing his hustler's laugh and bumping Beaumont's fist
hard.
ORDELL
You goddam right!
Beaumont laughs.
ORDELL
You see,it works like this. You get
your ass in trouble, I get your ass
out. That's my job. And I don't mind
tellin ya, nigga, it's steady work.
BEAUMONT
I'm still scared as a motherfucker,
Ordell. They talkin' like they
serious 'bout me doin' that machine
gun time.
ORDELL
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a
fright in your ass.
BEAUMONT
If that's what they want to do,
they're doin' it.
ORDELL
How old is that machine gun shit?
BEAUMONT
Three years.
ORDELL
Three years. That crime's old, man.
They ain't got room in prison for all
the motherfuckers out there killin'
people. How they gonna find room for
you?
BEAUMONT
That's not what they're tellin' me.
ORDELL
That's why they call it "fuckin' with
ya." Now you wanna hear how we
retaliate?
Beaumont takes a hit off the fatty and nods his head.
ORDELL (CONT'D)
Tomorrow I pick you up, take you to
Century City, meet my lawyer. Now let
me tell you a little bit about my
lawyer. His name is Stacin Goins and
this nigga is a junkyard dog! He's my
own private Johnie Cochran. In fact,
he'd kick Johnie Cochran's ass. And
like Johnie Cochran, dude hates
fuckin' cops. I'm serious, this man
lives to fuck with the police. So as
a favor, I had him look at your case.
Stacin told me you aint got shit to
worry about. They just fuckin' wit
ya. So we sic the junkyard dog on
their ass, make 'em -
(he bumps fist with Beaumont)
... Stop fuckin' wit ya!
Beaumont gesture inside his apartment.
BEAUMONT
Hey, c'mon in, man. I was just - you
know - smokin' a fatty, watchin' TV.
ORDELL
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was
kinda hopin you could come with me.
BEAUMONT
What'd ya mean?
ORDELL
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga,
does a nigga a favor - then BAM -
hits a nigga up for a favor in
return. But I'm afraid I gotta be
that kinda nigga.
BEAUMONT
What?
ORDELL
I need a favor.
BEAUMONT
That requires me goin out tonight?
ORDELL
A bit.
BEAUMONT
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on
goin no place. It's twelve o'clock,
man. I'm home, I'm high -
ORDELL
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I
spent ten thousand dollars gittin'
your ass home.
(changes tone)
Look, I gotta problem. I need help,
and you can help me.
This has the desired effect.
TIME CUT:
WITH ORDELL WAITING OUTSIDE THE DOOR
Beaumont comes out of the apartment, sporting Nikes and a
Queen Latifah t-shirt. He locks his front door and walks
with Ordell to his car. They talk the whole way. We
STEDICAM in front of them the whole way.
BEAUMONT
What's the problem?
ORDELL
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a
situation. Remember I sold those
three M-60 machine guns outta the
five I got?
BEAUMONT
Uh-huh.
ORDELL
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight.
This group of Koreans in Koreatown
have started a Neighborhood Watch
kinda thing. And they want a few
weapons so the neighborhood niggas
know they mean business. So I'm gonna
sell 'em my two machine guns tonight.
Only problem, I aint never dealt with
these Koreans before. Now I aint
worried. Asians are by and large real
dependable. They don't want no
trouble. You might argue about price,
but you aint gotta worry about them
shootin' you in the back. But I got
me kind of a rule. Never do business
with nobody you ain't never done
business with before without backup.
That's why I need you, backup.
BEAUMONT
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out
nowhere -
ORDELL
- Let me finish. Can I finish?
BEAUMONT
Go ahead.
CUT TO:
TRUNK
The trunk of a car is opened.
Ordell bends down into the trunk and pulls out a pump
action shotgun. Beaumont obviously doesn't want any part
of any Ordell game that requires a pump action shotgun as
a playing piece.
ORDELL
Now you're gonn be in the trunk
holding onto the shotgun. And I'm
going to tell them I'm opening up my
trunk to show 'em my goods. I open up
the trunk, you pop up, rack that bad
boy.
BEAUMONT
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin'
anybody.
ORDELL
What the fuck I tell you. You don't
hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the
gun. They'll get the idea.
BEAUMONT
I ain't gittin' in that trunk.
ORDELL
We're only goin' to Koreatown. You'll
be in there - ten minutes.
BEAUMONT
Uh-uh. I ain't riding in that trunk
no minutes. Why don't I just ride
with you?
ORDELL
You can't ride with me. The surprise
effect is ninety percent of it.
BEAUMONT
Well, I'm sorry, man, but I ain't
gittin' in that trunk.
ORDELL
I can't believe you do me this way.
BEAUMONT
I ain't doin' you no way. I just
ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a
problem with small places.
ORDELL
Well, my ass has got a problem
spending ten thousand dollars of my
own goddam money to get ungrateful,
peanut-head niggas outta jail, but I
do it -
BEAUMONT
Look, man, I know I owe you -
ORDELL
- Well, if you owe me, git your ass
in the trunk.
BEAUMONT
- I wanna help you, but I don't wanna
be locked in the trunk of no car.
ORDELL
You think I wanted to spend ten
thousand dollars on your ass?
Beaumont starts to speak -
ORDELL (CONT'D)
Answer the question, nigga. Do you
think I wanted to spend the thousand
dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
BEAUMONT
Course you didn't.
ORDELL
But the only way to help you was to
do that, so I did it. (pause) Okay,
how 'bout this? After we're through
fuckin' with these Koreans, I take
you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.
My treat.
Beaumont smiles. So does Ordell.
ORDELL (CONT'D)
Just think, man. That Scoe's special,
smothered in gravy and onions. Get a
side of red beans and rice.
Uuuuummmmm, that's some good eatin'.
Beaumont and Ordell laugh together... the Beaumont says;
BEAUMONT
Now exactly how long I gotta be in
this motherfucker.
CUT TO:
TRUNK
Beaumont in the trunk, holding the shotgun. The trunk lid
is SLAMMED closed.
Ordell walks around the car, climbs into the plush
interior of the Olds and turns on the engine. It comes to
life with a SOFT RUMBLE. He puts a tape in the player
inside the dash.
The tape is labeled "ORDELL'S JAMS."
Cool, old-school R&B; fills the cab.
Ordell cruises, moving his head to the rhythm and
mouthing the words.
He drives for awhile, just groovin' on the music...
... then stops.
Ordell switches the engine and the music off. The cab
goes black.
He leans over the passenger seat, opening the glovebox. A
tiny light turns on when the glovebox is opened. It's the
only light in the cab. Ordell leaves it on.
In silence he takes one glove out and puts it on his
right hand. Then with his gloved hand, reaches in the
glovebox and pulls out a five-shot .38 snubby. He closes
the glovebox.
The cab goes black.
The Olds is parked out in the middle of some urban
nowhere.
Ordell gets out, sticks the snubby in his pants, and
walks to the back of the Olds. He sticks his key in the
trunk and says;
ORDELL
Don't worry. It's just me.
The trunk opens. Beaumont is hunched on his side with the
shotgun.
ORDELL (CONT'D)
I was wondering. Did any federal
people come visit you in jail and I
should be watching my ass?
Beaumont doesn't say anything.
ORDELL (CONT'D)
You wouldn't tell me if they did and
I wouldn't blame you.
Ordell takes the snubby out of his pants.
Beaumont quick-racks the pump shotgun, pulls the trigger,
and hears the click you hear from an empty weapon. He
racks it again, CLICK then BAM. Beaumont is shot hard in
the chest. He goes back into he trunk.
Ordell puts one more shot in his head, BAM, tosses the
weapon on top of the dead body and closes the trunk.
Ordell's Beaumont problem is solved. He climbs back into
the cab, turns on the engine. We hear the old-school R&B;
song come back on, but VERY LOW.
Ordell drives the Olds away.
CUT TO:
Louis, having just thrown on some pants, walks outside
his room and sees Ordell's big, black Oldsmobile parked
in front of the motel.
As he approaches, the power window on the driver's side
comes down, revealing a comfortable Ordell sitting back
in his seat looking up at Louis.
ORDELL
You know what your problem is, Louis?
Louis doesn't say anything, he just puts his hands in his
pockets.
ORDELL (CONT'D)
You think you're a good guy. When you
go into a deal you don't go in
prepared to take that motherfucker
all the way. You go in looking for a
way out. And it ain't cause you're
scared neither. It's cause you think
you're a good guy, and you think
there's certain things a good guy
won't do. That's where we're
different, me and you. Cause me, once
I decide I want something, aint a
goddam motherfuckin' thing gonna stop
me from gittin' it. I gotta use a gun
get what I want, I'm gonna use a gun.
Nigga gets in my way, nigga gonna get
removed. Understand what I'm saying?
CLOSEUP: KEY GOING INTO TRUNK
Trunk opens showing Beaumont shot in the chest with half
his head blown off.
Louis looks inside, see Beaumont, looks at Ordell, then
back to Beaumont.
Ordell closes the trunk.
LOUIS
Who was that?
ORDELL
That was Beaumont.
LOUIS
Who was Beaumont?
ORDELL
An employee I had to let go.
LOUIS
What did he do?
ORDELL
He put himself in a situation where
he was gonna have to do ten years in
the penetentiary, that's what he did.
(taking out a Viceroy and
lighting it up)
And if you know Beaumont, you know
there aint no way in hell he can do
no ten years. And if you know that,
you know Beaumont's gonna go any
goddam thing Beaumont can to keep
from doin' those ten years including
telling the Federal government
everything they want to know about my
ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear
case of him or me. And you best
believe it aint gonna be me. You know
what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on
this with me, you gotta be prepared
to go all the way. I got me so far
over a half-a-million dollars sittin'
in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San
Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one
more delivery, I'm gonna have me over
a million. You think I'm gonna let
this little cheese eatin' nigga here
fuck that up? Shit, you better think
again. 'Fore I let this deal get
fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in
the head, and ten niggas look just
like em.
(pause)
Understand what I'm sayin'?
LOUIS
Yeah.
ORDELL
So we on the same page then?
LOUIS
I follow.
Ordell smiles (not his hustler smile, but a genuine
smile).
Louis grins.
They both bump fists.
FADE TO BLACK:
TITLE CARD:
"JACKIE BROWN"
The sound of airplanes landing and taking off can be
heard underneath this...
A Los Angeles County Jail bus pulls up behind the
Torrance Court House.
MANY WOMEN, including Jackie, all wearing county blues
and handcuffed to each other, exit the bus.
The SHERIFFS lead them into the back entrance to the
court house.
A big neon sign of a cockatoo sits on op of a red brick
inn.
ORDELL'S POV
Through the windshield, he sees Max's powder-blue
Cadillac Seville pull up to Jackie's apartment. She gets
out, ten bends down and talks to him through the window
of the passenger side door. Then makes a goobye gesture
and turns, walking into her apartment complex. Max drives
off.
ORDELL
While Johnny Cash continues crooning, Ordell puts on his
gloves. Then opens up his glovebox, taking out a little
Targa .22 pistol. He steps out of the car, slipping the
pistol into his coat pocket. We STEDICAM in front of him
as he walks across the street to Jackie's apartment. Once
inside the complex, Ordell passes us and WE FOLLOW BEHIND
HIM, up to Jackie's ground-floor apartment door.
He gives it a soft knock with one knuckle. He waits a
moment, then Jackie opens the door.
ORDELL
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
JACKIE
I was expecting you. Come in.
Jackie holds the door open for him.
We se the huge Del Amo Mall from the parking area.
A SUBTITLE reads:
"DEL AMO MALL TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA LARGEST INDOOR MALL IN
THE WORLD"
The huge Del Amo Mall.
Max follows the woman outside.
She walks down a line of cars, then gets in a big, tan
Mercury sedan. She drives of...
... but not before Max writes down her license plate
number.
FLASH ON:
MAX AND JACKIE ON PHONE
MAX
You're rationalizing.
JACKIE
That's what you do to go through with
the shit you start. You rationalize.
I can do this, Max, I know I can. But
I can't do it without you.
Ordell and Louis are at Mr. Robbie's storage facility. A
VAN is backed up nect to the opening. The facility is
pitch black. Ordell ahs a big flashlight in his hand.
ORDELL
Check this out.
He turns on the flashlight.
He shines the beam into darkness. We see the facility is
filled to the gills with machine guns, shotguns, uzis, a
rocket launcher, and handguns of many types.
LOUIS
How much is there?
ORDELL
Over half-million dollars worth of
merchandise.
Ordell opens the back doors of the van. They start
unloading machine guns and boxes of ammo.
LOUIS
Can I ask you about Melanie?
ORDELL
Sure.
LOUIS
What's your relationship?
ORDELL
She one of the women I got set up. I
got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent
Simone a small house in Compton, and
about four blocks away I got me this
nineteen-year-old country girl named
Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a
bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot,
country as a chicken coop. Took her
to my house in Compton, told her it
was Hollywood.
LOUIS
She believed you?
ORDELL
Hell, yeah. To her dumb country ass,
Compton is Hollywood. Close as she's
ever been, anyway.
They both laugh together.
LOUIS
Do you trust Melanie?
Ordell stops unloading.
ORDELL
If this is about you fucked Melanie,
I don't give a damn. I ain't a fool.
I leave you alone with a bitch like
Melanie, you're gonna be fuckin' that
twenty minutes after I'm out the
door. So say "thank you" and I'll
tell you, "you're welcome."
LOUIS
That's not what I meant when I asked
did you trust her.
Ordell looks at him.
ORDELL
She tryin' to work your ass against
me, ain't she?
LOUIS
Yep.
ORDELL
You didn't even hafta say it. I know
the woman.
LOUIS
Well, why the fuck keep her around?
ORDELL
(smiling)
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal.
She can't do me no harm. Fact she
think she can play you against me
shows how little she knows. You could
teach that bitch for days how it is
'tween me an you, she never
understand a damn word.
LOUIS
Why do you let someone know your
business you can't trust?
ORDELL
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
LOUIS
What does that mean?
ORDELL
You can't trust Melanie. But you can
always trust Melanie to be Melanie.
Louis starts unloading.
LOUIS
I still don't understand why you keep
her around.
ORDELL
I told you, man.
(smiling)
She my fine little surfer gal.
EXTREME CLOSEUP - Jackie's finger presses a small black
button next to the
handwritten name, "M. RALSTON."
EXTREME CLOSEUP SPEAKER BOX
MELANIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
(coming out of it)
What?
JACKIE
Bends down to talk in the speaker.
JACKIE
It's Jackie.
Ordell and Jackie on the balcony.
JACKIE
I don't want no more fuckin'
surprises. We do this the way I laid
it out, or we don't do it at all.
ORDELL
What the hell you talkin' bout?
JACKIE
Sheronda passin' the money onto
someone else, that's what the hell
I'm talkin' 'bout.
ORDELL
How do you know she did that?
JACKIE
I was there, I saw her do it.
ORDELL
Well, you weren't supposed to be
there.
JACKIE
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I
figured you'd try an' pull some shit
like this.
ORDELL
Now, hold on there. I ain't pullin'
no shit. It's my money, I can do
whatever the fuck I wanna do with it.
JACKIE
Not when it's my ass on the line you
don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
Ordell tries to stop the hostile back and forth.
ORDELL
Just chill the fuck out, Jackie. It
ain't no big thing. The woman you saw
was my friend, Simone. She's the one
gonna be receiving the money, so I
just wanted her to see how it works.
She'll be here any minute. Nice
woman, you'll like her.
Ordell opens the sliding glass and says to Louis in the
living room;
ORDELL
Louis, call Simone and tell her to
get her tail over here. We're waitin'
on her ass.
Louis gets up to make the call.
Ordell turns back to Jackie and smiles, holding up his
screwdriver.
ORDELL (CONT'D)
I'm about ready for a refill. Sure I
can't tempt you?
The Strand is the hip surfer street in downtown Hermosa
Beach. Jackie leaves the apartment building. She walks to
her car when she spots a funky little beach bar called,
"Sally Leroy's."
Sam's Hoffin Braur (German for beer garden) is a strip

ORDELL
What the fuck are you two still doing
there?!
Jackie's car pulls up to a lined parking space in the
parking lot.
SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:
"TIME 3:52"
Jackie gets out of the Honda with her flight bag. She
goes to her hatchback, takes a Robinson's/May bag, lines
the first half of the bag with old paperbacks.
Then takes out of the flight bag the envelope with the
fifty-thousand marked dollars, takes one packet of ten
thousand, and puts it in her pocket. She lines the
envelope with forty thousand across the books, then fills
the rest of the bag with beach towels.
Then with her flight bag slung over her shoulder,
carrying the Robinson's/May bag and with all the
confidence of a world champion prize fighter going into
the ring, she strides toward the hugs mall.
Louis and Melanie pull up to a lined parking space in
Melanie's Toyota.
SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:
"TIME: 4:12"
Louis is the first out of the car.
LOUIS
Come on, goddammit, we're late!
Louis, clutching the shopping bag close to his chest,
walks rapidly down an aisle of parked cars.
Melanie follows close behind.
We STEDICAM alongside. We walk for awhile, Louis changes
direction to another aisle. WE'RE NOW IN FRONT of him. We
see he has a searching look on his face.
MELANIE
You have no idea where you parked, do
you?
Louis doesn't answer.
Melanie laughs.
MELANIE (CONT'D)
Jesus, but if you two aren't the
biggest fuck-ups I've ever seen in my
life... How did you ever rob a bank?
When you robbed banks, did you have
to look for your car then too? No
wonder you went to jail.
Louis could kill her right now. Just take his gun out of
his pants and shoot her in her snickering face. But
instead of doing what he wants, he does what he should.
He doesn't answer of look back. (If he looked back and
saw that Melanie-smirk, he couldn't e responsible for
what happens.)He changes directions, cuts down another
aisle and hopes for both their sakes she shuts the fuck
up.
But our Melanie just keeps on being Melanie.
MELANIE (CONT'D)
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
LOUIS
Yeah, down the end.
MELANIE
You sure?
They walk it; it's not it.
Louis changes direction and cuts between some cars to the
next one.
MELANIE (CONT'D)
Is it this aisle or the next one
over?
LOUIS
This one.
MELANIE
You sure?
In between two cars, Louis spins on her.
LOUIS
Don't say anything else, okay? I'm
telling you, keep your mouth shut.
Melanie was surprised by the spin, but is about to say
something anyway when Louis put his hand up and says;
LOUIS
I mean it. Don't say one fuckin'
word.
MELANIE
Okay, Lou-is.
That did it!
Louis whips out the Beretta Ordell gave him, shoots
her... BAM... in the belly.
She bounces OFF one of the cars and goes down.
BAM... Louis shoots her again on the ground.
One; to make sure. Two; cause it felt good.
Then he hurries of for his car. WE FOLLOW IN FRONT OF
HIM. He looks around, then yells out;
LOUIS
See, just where I fuckin' said it
was!
He hops in the car, and throws it into reverse.
We can se Melanie's bare legs sticking out from a row of
cars. Louis stops the Toyota alongside the dead Melanie,
and yells through the passenger window;
LOUIS
Hey, look. I found it!
He drives away.
CUT TO:
Max Cherry's Cadillac Seville pulls up to a lined space
in the parking lot.
SUBTITLE APPEARS BELOW:
"TIME: 4:04"
Max gets out of his car and casually strolls towards the
Del Amo Mall.
He's outside; nobody's stopped him. He keeps walking
towards his blue Seville. He keeps walking unhurriedly,
never looking back. He gets to his car, uses opening the
car door as an excuse to look back at the mall.
It's normal. Nobody's after him, nobody's watching him.
He made it. It worked.
Max allows himself a smile, gets into his Cadillac with
his half-a-million bucks and drives away.
The Toyota pulls up to the back of the bar. Ordell hops
in, the car takes off.
A low-rent motel. We hear a phone ring inside one of the
rooms.
Max at the front door or Raynelle's apartment. He pounds
on the door.
Ordell throws open the door.
ORDELL
What the fuck you doin' knockin on
the door like the goddamn police? You
lookin' to get shot?
MAX
I thought you might be asleep.
ORDELL
You keep fuckin' with me, you're
gonna be asleep forever.
He looks past Max.
MAX
I'm alone.
ORDELL
Git your ass in here.
Max enters, Ordell slams the door.
As Ordell turns away from the door, Maxis reaching into
his coat. Ordell brings his Beretta up at Max.
ORDELL
You better freeze, motherfucker!
Max freezes, his hand in his coat pocket.
MAX
You want your money? Your bond
refund?
He takes his hand out, it's holding stack of bills
wrapped in a rubber band. He tosses it to Ordell, who
catches it with his free hand.
ORDELL
That's all?
MAX
I have a bond receipt for you to
sign.
ORDELL
You know what the fuck I'm talkin'
about. You talk to her?
MAX
She wants to give you your money. If
she didn't, there'd be cops batter-
ramming the door right now.
ORDELL
How'd you find me?
MAX
Winston found you.
ORDELL
How the fuck did he find me?
MAX
That's what Winston does. He finds
people who don't want to be found.
ORDELL
Well, bully for that nigga. You say
she wants to give me the money, huh?
MAX
Uh-huh.
ORDELL
Well, give it to me then.
MAX
She wants to give it to you herself
and collect her ten percent. She also
wants to explain why she had to hold
on to it.
ORDELL
I'd like to hear that too. Turn
around and put your hands on your
head.
Max does this, Ordell pats him down.
MAX
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd
already tried to get Jackie to go in
with her, split the half million
amongst themselves. What she did was
take quite a risk to see you get your
money.
ORDELL
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
MAX
All I did was walk out with it.
ORDELL
And you did that to protect my
interest?
MAX
In a way, yes.
ORDELL
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a
dumbass. Go sit over there on the
couch.
Max does.
MAX
This place stinks.
ORDELL
You get used to it after a while. Now
tell me where my money's at.
MAX
My office.
ORDELL
And where's Jackie?
MAX
She's been there since Thursday
night.
ORDELL
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she
home?
MAX
She was afraid.
ORDELL
(laughs)
That I gotta see.
MAX
She still is. She doesn't want to get
shot before she can tell you what
happened.
ORDELL
Have her bring the money here.
MAX
It's in the safe. She can't get at
it.
ORDELL
Call her, tell her the combination.
MAX
I'm telling you, you got her spooked.
She won't leave there till you have
your money and you're gone.
ORDELL
You expect me to just walk in there?
MAX
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be
in custody right now. When you said
you'd name her as an accessory she
believed you. That scares her more
than anything.
ORDELL
That's why she's givin' up my money
huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie.
I didn't trust her ass neither, but I
knew how to handle her. She was my
blonde-headed little surfer gal. I
fuckin' told Louis he could've just
given her a punch in the mouth, he
didn't need to shoot her. She's at
your office.
MAX
Uh-huh.
ORDELL
By herself. That big mandingo nigga
Winston ain't there, is he?
MAX
She's all alone.
ORDELL
I call your office, she better answer
the phone.
MAX
She will.
They leave the apartment walking to Max's car.
ORDELL
All the time I've known her, I never
heard her sound scared like that.
Ordinarily she's too cool for school.
I'm driving, gimme the keys.
Max hands him the keys. They climb in.
They both get out of the Cadillac. Ordell sticks his gun
in his pants.
ORDELL
Get ahead of me and open the door.
Max steps in front of him, puts his keys in the lock and
opens the door.
ORDELL (CONT'D)
Step inside easy.
Max does.
Max sees; Jackie sitting at his desk in the dark.
Ordell sees this, too and moves past Max.
ORDELL (CONT'D)
Hey, girl, what the hell you sitting
in the goddamn dark for?
Max sees; Ordell moves past him... then he sees the
bathroom door on the left side of the desk open, throwing
light into the room, onto Jackie and the figure who steps
out of the bathroom... Mark Dargus.
Max sees; Ordell looks to Dargus, then back to Jackie.
Then Jackie says;
JACKIE
Mark...
(raising her voice)
... he's got a gun!
Max sees; Ordell almost jumps, his arm goes to the
Beretta in his pants...
... just as Dargus raises his gun and SHOOTS him three
times in the chest...
... Ordell drops o the ground like a sack of potatoes, he
lands at Max's feet.
Max looks down and sees Ordell's head by his shoes, look
of panic still on his face, dead as fried chicken.
Max sees Dargus come over, bending on one nee next to
Ordell's body.
Max looks over at Jackie, still behind the desk. She
looks eyes with Max for a moment, then stands and walks
over to the body.
Then Max sees ONE SHERIFF DEPUTY step out of the dark
holding a shogun ... then another... then Winston step
out of the bathroom.
DARGUS
He's dead.
Dargus looks up at Max;
DARGUS (CONT'D)
Does he have the marked bills on him?
Max still shaken;
MAX
In his inside coat pocket.
Dargus reaches in and pulls out the envelope containing
the forty-thousand marked dollars.
Max looks at Jackie.
She looks down at the dead Ordell with no expression,
just light up another Davidoff.
Dargus looks up at Max;
DARGUS
Why were you with him?
MAX
I went to give him his refund, so he
wouldn't have to come here.
DARGUS
How'd you know where he was?
MAX
I found out.
DARGUS
And you didn't tell the Police?
MAX
I told Jackie, and Jackie said you
wanted him.
Dargus looks down at he man he just killed.
JACKIE
Remember when Ray said you hoped
you'd get him before he got me?
Dargus looks up and nods his head.
JACKIE (CONT'D)
Well, you did. Thank you.
She takes a drag on her Davidoff.
FADE TO BLACK
They walk outside and Max sees Ordell's black Mercedes
convertible.
MAX
That's Ordell's.
JACKIE
They've confiscated all his other
stuff. But this one's sorta left
over. The registration's in the glove
box, the keys were under the seat...
What's a matter" haven't you ever
borrowed someone's car?
MAX
Not after they're dead.
She walks around to the other side of the car, and looks
at him across the black Mercedes.
JACKIE
I didn't use you, Max.
MAX
I didn't say you did.
JACKIE
I never lied to you.
MAX
I know.
JACKIE
We're partners.
MAX
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't
blame anybody for anything I do.
JACKIE
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
He shakes his head 'no.'
JACKIE (CONT'D)
'd feel a whole lot better if you
took some more money.
MAX
(smiling)
You'll get over that.
Jackie smiles.
MAX (CONT'D)
Where're you going?
JACKIE
Spain.
MAX
Madrid or Barcelona?
JACKIE
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
He shakes his head 'no.'
JACKIE (CONT'D)
I hear they don't eat dinner till
midnight.
Max doesn't say anything.
JACKIE
Wanna go?
MAX
Thanks, but you have a good time.
JACKIE
Sure I can't twist your arm?
MAX
Thank you for saying that, but no. My
business.
JACKIE
I thought you were tired of your
business?
MAX
I'm just tired in general.
JACKIE
Are you scared of me?
Max smiles and holds up two fingers, close to each other.
MAX
A little bit.
Jackie smiles back.
JACKIE
Come over here.
Max does.
They give each other a long, tender kiss.
She breaks it.
JACKIE (CONT'D)
I'll send you a postcard, partner.
