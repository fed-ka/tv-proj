Randy, changed into his street clothes, limps out of the
school, each step labored and painful. Waiting near the
entrance are TWO FANS, both men in their 30s.
FAN #1
Yo, Ram. Think you could...?
Fan #1 holds out a SHARPIE and an old WRESTLING PROGRAM from
the `80s. On the cover is a shot of Randy wrestling CORPORAL
PUNISHMENT, a heel in a drill instructor get-up.
Randy takes the program, happy to oblige.
FAN #1 (CONT'D)
I was there.
3.
Randy hands back the program. FAN #2 hands him a MINI-POSTER.
The faded, mid-'80s poster features Randy, biceps bulging,
crushing a head of broccoli between his fists. Across the
top, it says "EAT YOUR VEGETABLES, PUNK!"
FAN #2
(as Randy signs)
My first match ever was you versus
Davey Diamond at the Spectrum.
(NOSTALGIC)
1985...
Randy smiles a little. He remembers, too. He hands back the
poster. Fan #2 looks fondly at Randy, a part of his boyhood.
FAN #2 (CONT'D)
(vaguely sad)
You were awesome.
Randy nods, a bit uncomfortably. The two fans, muttering
thanks, drift off into the Delaware night. Randy is left
standing alone, still holding Fan #1's pen.
He walks over to a beat-up old CONVERSION VAN and climbs in.
Turns on the engine. Music starts up on the stereo mid-song.
MUSIC: CINDERELLA - "DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GOT (TIL IT'S GONE)"
Randy parks in front of his TRAILER. He gets out and heads
toward it. A dismayed look comes over his face.
RANDY'S POV: The door is PADLOCKED.
He tugs on the lock. Tugs on the door. No dice.
He violently kicks the padlock in a moment of rage.
4.
Randy resignedly climbs into the BACK OF HIS VAN.
Randy is asleep in his clothes from the night before. He's
STIRRED AWAKE by the sound of kids YELLING and BANGING on the
outside of van.
KID'S VOICE (O.S.)
Ram!
He slowly sits upright, massaging his pain-wracked knees.
Every inch of him feels like shit.
ANOTHER KID'S VOICE (O.S.)
Raaam!
RANDY'S POV: Through the front windshield, TWO 8-YEAR-OLD
KIDS, boosted by TWO OTHER KIDS, are peering in.
Randy is playfully tussling with the four kids. He picks one
of them up and "bodyslams" him.
RANDY
(announcer voice)
Oh, my... look out!
He picks up another one and fake-drops him on his head.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Suplex!
5.
He slams a third one. The kids are squealing with delight.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Tombstone piledriver!
Randy sees a car drive up and park by the MANAGER'S OFFICE.
He watches it with interest.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Catch you maniacs later...
The kids moan with disappointment as Randy heads off.
Randy sits on a MILK CRATE by his parked van. On the ground
in front of him is a BLENDER connected to an extension cord
stretching to another TRAILER. He pours a protein-shake
packet into the blender.
The trailer door opens. A WOMAN comes out. Lighting a
cigarette, she looks up at the cloudless, starry sky.
6.
RANDY
Thanks, Meg.
She gives Randy a small "You got it" wave.
CUT TO:
Randy enters a suburban Shop-Rite.
Randy, working alongside some MEXICAN GUYS, lifts a STACK OF
BOXES off the back of a BOAR'S HEAD DELIVERY TRUCK.
He carries the boxes through a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN, into a
WALK-IN COOLER. He puts them down and heads back out again.
CUT TO:
A spring in his hobbled step, Randy gets out of the van and
heads toward Cheetah's, the strip club he passed earlier.
Manning the door is BIG CHRIS, a huge bouncer/doorman.
BIG CHRIS
Whassup, Ram? How ya been?
RANDY
Yo, Big Chris.
They chummily shake hands. Big Chris pulls Randy in tight.
BIG CHRIS
(into Randy's ear)
Hey, can you get me any more of
that IGF-1?
RANDY
What do I look like, some fuckin'
two-bit street dealer?
BIG CHRIS
C'mon, hook a brother up. You get
the family discount.
RANDY
Swing by the mansion. Any day this
week.
BIG CHRIS
You da man, Ram!
The van pulls up to a TWO-FAMILY HOUSE in working-class
Queens. Out steps Lex Lethal (from the Passaic VFW show).
Randy lies asleep. The breathing tube is out. The chest tube
is still in.
His eyes slowly open. He looks around, disoriented. Woozy.
Confused by all the wires on him, he starts PULLING THINGS
OFF. Monitors BEEP. Nurses rush into the room, calming him
down as they try to reattach the wires.
34.
He faints.
Randy, transferred to a regular hospital room, is watching
"All My Children" on the wall-mounted TV. The chest tube is
out, in its place a large bandage.
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
(slight Indian accent)
Mr. Ramovic.
Randy looks up. DR. TARACHANDANI (40) enters the room.
RANDY
Call me Randy.
The doctor, nodding, looks down Randy's folder.
RANDY (CONT'D)
So how we lookin', doc?
DR. TARACHANDANI
A lot better than before the
bypass.
RANDY
Great. So I'm all good.
From the doctor's face, it's not quite that simple.
DR. TARACHANDANI
Your heart... You're going to have
to start taking much better care of
it.
RANDY
Like...
DR. TARACHANDANI
For starters, you must take your
medication every day.
RANDY
I could handle that.
DR. TARACHANDANI
No smoking.
(Randy nods)
And no cocaine.
35.
RANDY
(defensive, offended)
I don't do coke.
DR. TARACHANDANI
It's all over your blood work.
RANDY
(sheepish, busted)
Maybe once in a while.
DR. TARACHANDANI
Well, it has to be never.
Randy gives him a reluctant nod.
DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D)
As for exercise, it's still okay,
as long as it's moderate.
RANDY
So, like, wrestling...
DR. TARACHANDANI
Not a good idea.
RANDY
What if I do it moderate? I could
hold back on certain moves. There's
always ways to fake----
DR. TARACHANDANI
Mr. Ramovic...
RANDY
(edgy glare)
Randy.
DR. TARACHANDANI
Randy, a man with your heart should
not be flying around a ring
crashing into people.
Randy's nostrils flare.
RANDY
With all due respect, Dr...
(reads name tag,
MISPRONOUNCING)
...Trachanani, I'd like a second
opinion on that.
36.
DR. TARACHANDANI
Of course. But I promise you, any
doctor I showed your file would say
the same thing.
Randy lets out a skeptical, sarcastic snort.
DR. TARACHANDANI (CONT'D)
You almost died. The next time, you
won't be so lucky.
RANDY
I want a second opinion.
DR. TARACHANDANI
Your heart's been through a lot.
Even before the heart attack, it
was significantly----
RANDY
I want a second opinion.
(BEAT)
I WANT A SECOND OPINION.
Randy steps out of the hospital into the bright light of day.
He squints, his eyes adjusting. He stands there looking
around, a lost animal.
TIME LATER
A CAB pulls up to Randy's van, still parked in the community
center's lot. Randy steps out of the cab and limps to the
van. He gets in.
Len removes the padlock from Randy's trailer door.
LEN THE MANAGER
Welcome home.
Randy sticks his head out of his trailer.
RANDY'S POV: In front of the opposite trailer, ADAM (8), one
of the kids he was play-wrestling with, is idly throwing a
tennis ball against a car.
RANDY
Yo, Adam!
Adam turns and looks toward Randy.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Wanna play Nintendo?
Randy sits in the van, staring at the club's rear EMERGENCY
EXIT. Cassidy emerges, a jacket covering her dress. Randy
waves. Spotting him, she comes over, climbing in the
passenger side.
RANDY
Thanks. I appreciate it.
CASSIDY
That's okay.
She looks at his vulnerable expression.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. That's fucked up, dude.
Randy nods.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)
When was it?
RANDY
Last week.
CASSIDY
You okay?
44.
RANDY
Yeah, yeah. Feelin' much better.
CASSIDY
Good, good. What happened?
RANDY
It was while I was wrestling. I
collapsed in the ring.
CASSIDY
Oh, man. That's terrible.
RANDY
Yeah, it was pretty fucked up.
He chuckles, a little perversely.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Tell ya, though, it was a big hit
with the fans.
(amused grin)
Promoter told me everybody was
hanging around wondering if I was
okay, they wound up buying up all
of his T-shirts and shit. Whole
merch table got cleaned out.
CASSIDY
That's funny.
Randy's grin fades. His expression turns melancholy, fearful.
RANDY
Doctor says I can't wrestle no
more.
CASSIDY
Damn. What are you gonna do?
RANDY
I don't know. I don't know what to
do. If I can't wrestle...
He loses himself in some bleak thought.
CASSIDY
It just happened. You don't have to
figure everything out this second.
Give yourself some time.
RANDY
Time's all I got. I just sit there
all day...
45.
He stares off bleakly again.
CASSIDY
You really shouldn't be alone right
now.
He turns to her, looking her in the eye.
RANDY
That's why I came to see you.
CASSIDY
(a little unnerved)
Randy...
She looks at him with sympathy.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)
I feel bad what happened. But you
and me... I can't go there.
Randy gives her a sour, disappointed look.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)
You should be with family now. You
have a daughter, right? Where is
she?
RANDY
We don't really get along too good.
CASSIDY
It doesn't matter. You need her.
RANDY
(bitter chuckle)
She don't need me.
CASSIDY
Everybody needs a father. Trust me.
Randy shrugs, not so sure. Cassidy glances at the dashboard
clock.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. I gotta get back in.
She puts a sympathetic hand on his knee.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)
You take care of yourself.
She gives him a peck on the cheek. He lingers there for a
second. A weird, tentative moment.
46.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)
You gonna be okay?
He nods, putting his brave face back on.
RANDY
I'm Randy The Ram. I've taken
bigger bumps than this.
CASSIDY
I'm sure.
RANDY
Maybe I'll give my daughter a call.
CASSIDY
You should.
RANDY
Why the fuck not? I'm her father. A
person only gets one father in this
life.
CASSIDY
Exactly.
RANDY
Unless you're adopted.
Cassidy laughs. She gives him a friendly pat on the shoulder.
CASSIDY
You're gonna be just fine.
RANDY
Definitely.
Cassidy climbs out of the van. Randy watches as she heads
back into the club.
His cheery expression fades. He is alone again.
CUT TO:
Randy stands at a PAY PHONE with the photo, ringing phone
cradled to his ear.
STEPHANIE'S VOICE
This is Stephanie, you know what to
do.
(answering machine BEEP)
Randy listens to the silence. He hangs up.
Randy stands at the doorstep of the house. Steeling himself,
he rings the bell. A WOMAN (22) appears at the door in a T-
SHIRT and PANTIES.
RANDY
(a little thrown)
Hey... Is Stephanie home?
The woman looks at Randy a little coldly, sensing who he is.
THE WOMAN
Who can I say it is?
RANDY
Her father.
She disappears into the house.
A few moments later, Stephanie emerges with a BACKPACK slung
over her shoulder. In her hands is a TEXTBOOK. She heads
straight down the driveway, blowing past Randy.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Where you going?
He goes after her.
48.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Stephanie!
He catches up. She stops.
STEPHANIE
What do you want?
RANDY
Can we talk?
STEPHANIE
Now's really not a good time.
She resumes walking, briskly.
RANDY
Wait!
(chasing after her)
Where ya going?
He looks at the textbook in her hands: PRINCIPLES OF CHILD
DEVELOPMENT.
RANDY (CONT'D)
You in school? That's great.
She turns DOWN THE SIDEWALK. He continues following.
RANDY (CONT'D)
What school?
No answer.
RANDY (CONT'D)
What school?
STEPHANIE
Middlesex County Community.
RANDY
Middlesex? That's kind of a hike.
Where's your car?
(no response)
You taking the bus? Lemme give you
a lift.
STEPHANIE
That's okay.
RANDY
It's no problem.
(BEAT)
Really. I'm parked right by.
49.
Stephanie picks up the pace, trying to lose him.
RANDY (CONT'D)
You're walking pretty fast there.
You running late?
(no answer)
I could help you with that.
(no answer)
Give you a ride.
She keeps right on walking.
RANDY (CONT'D)
New Jersey Transit sucks!
And walking.
RANDY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
The buses smell like piss!
She fights off an amused smile. She slows a tiny bit.
Randy stands alone in front of YESTERDAZE, a strip-mall
vintage clothing store. He looks at his watch, almost
thinking of leaving.
CASSIDY (O.S.)
Hey.
Randy looks up. He seems slightly thrown by what he sees.
RANDY
Hey.
RANDY'S POV: It's his first time seeing Cassidy in street
clothes and in daylight. She's not wearing makeup, and her
hair is pulled back in a ponytail. She's also a good three
inches shorter out of her stripper heels.
They shake hands, a bit awkwardly.
RANDY (CONT'D)
I almost didn't recognize you. You
look all... clean.
CASSIDY
"Clean"?
RANDY
Like classy.
60.
CASSIDY
Gee, thanks.
RANDY
Nah, nah, I don't mean that bad. I
like it.
(BEAT)
It's like in "Grease", where she
turns into the hot rock `n' roll
chick at the end. Except backwards.
CASSIDY
Oh-kaay...
Randy looks at her sneakers, a far cry from the clear heels
he's used to.
RANDY
So, uh... Should I call you Cassidy
or Pam?
She gives the question genuine thought.
CASSIDY
Pam.
(playful finger wag)
But don't get used to it.
Yesterdaze bag in hand, Randy opens the door to his van. He
and tosses the bag inside. He's on a post-shop high, mission
accomplished.
63.
RANDY
Thanks again.
CASSIDY
You found it.
RANDY
I never woulda known about this
place.
CASSIDY
Okay, I'll give you that.
A tentative pause. Cassidy looks at him, ready to part ways.
CASSIDY (CONT'D)
Look, I...
RANDY
Man, I worked up a pretty good
thirst in there. What say we grab a
beer?
CASSIDY
I gotta get going.
RANDY
One beer! We gotta re-hydrate!
Cassidy seems torn.
CASSIDY
I really can't.
(BEAT)
I got a kid at home.
RANDY
You have a kid?
Cassidy nods. Yup.
RANDY (CONT'D)
I had no idea.
Cassidy shrugs casually.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Boy or girl?
CASSIDY
Boy. Daniel.
RANDY
How old?
64.
CASSIDY
Nine.
RANDY
Wow... I had no friggin' idea.
CASSIDY
It's not something I usually tell
customers. Not exactly a turn-on.
Randy looks off at something by his van. An idea hits him.
RANDY
Wait.
He unlocks the door. Leaning into the van, he TEARS THE RANDY
THE RAM ACTION FIGURE OFF THE DASHBOARD. He proudly,
excitedly holds it out to Cassidy.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Now both our kids got something.
She looks at the action figure, reluctant to take it.
RANDY (CONT'D)
You're gonna turn this down, too?
Man, you're rough!
Cassidy chuckles a little. She takes it.
CASSIDY
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
RANDY
Tell him to take good care of that.
$300 bucks on eBay.
CASSIDY
Really?
RANDY
Nah.
Cassidy laughs a little. She can't help but be charmed by his
sweetness and earnestness. After a pause...
CASSIDY
One beer.
65.
Stephanie emerges from the Middlesex County Community College
building. A look of surprise comes over her face.
STEPHANIE'S POV: Randy is standing there waiting for her by
his van. Under his arm is a LUMPILY WRAPPED PRESENT, no box.
STEPHANIE
What are you, stalking me?
RANDY
Do stalkers bring presents?
STEPHANIE
Sometimes.
RANDY
Well, I ain't a stalker. But...
He excitedly hands her the present. She looks at it warily.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Open it.
She opens it. Inside is the green satin jacket. She holds it
up, trying to process.
RANDY (CONT'D)
The "S" is for "Stephanie".
STEPHANIE
Oh. Okay.
She looks at the jacket. It's nothing she would ever wear.
74.
RANDY
I got it just for you.
STEPHANIE
I see that. What's it for?
RANDY
No reason. Just because. Do you
like it?
STEPHANIE
I do. It's... shiny.
She looks at Randy. He is excited and proud.
RANDY
I was looking in this store and saw
it, and I just said, "That is it."
Stephanie nods, smiling politely.
RANDY (CONT'D)
So what are you doing now?
STEPHANIE
What am I doing?
RANDY
Got any time? I was thinking we
could swing by our old favorite
spot.
STEPHANIE
We have an old favorite spot?
RANDY
You'll remember when you see.
Whaddaya say?
STEPHANIE
Now's not the best time. I've got
some things to do.
RANDY
What kinda things?
STEPHANIE
Stuff.
RANDY
You ain't got stuff!
(BEAT)
C'mon, give an old man a break.
75.
He giver her his biggest, most charming puppy-dog smile.
Randy and Stephanie walk along the boardwalk. It's a charming
little Jersey-shore boardwalk/beach lined with Skee-Ball
games, ice-cream parlors, T-shirt shops etc. It's a bit cold
and not very crowded, still out of season.
RANDY
You really don't remember?
STEPHANIE
No.
RANDY
Guess you were pretty young.
They walk for a stretch in silence. He points to a spot.
RANDY (CONT'D)
There used to be this funhouse.
(BEAT)
The Monster Motel...
Randy chuckles at the memory.
RANDY (CONT'D)
They had this cheesy-ass skeleton
that popped out of a coffin. You'd
get so scared, you'd cry. Then
you'd beg to go in again.
STEPHANIE
(chuckles to self)
Always was a glutton for
punishment.
RANDY
You'd hop on my foot and wrap your
arms around my leg. I'd have to
walk you the whole way through like
that.
STEPHANIE
I totally don't remember.
RANDY
(looks at her sweetly)
I do.
76.
Randy and Stephanie sit on a bench facing the ocean eating
mint-chocolate chip ice-cream cones. Randy is quiet and
contemplative, not in his usual "on" mode. He takes a deep
breath.
RANDY
I accept your apology.
She shoots him an irked look.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Not like that. I just mean... You
made amends. I free you.
Her expression softens.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Anything you've ever done or said
or thought, I forgive. You've done
nothing wrong to me. And anything
I've ever done...
(BEAT)
I'm sorry. Truly.
Stephanie is surprised by his emotion and sincerity.
STEPHANIE
Thank you.
RANDY
I was young. My career was booming.
All those lights, the fans, the
crazy shit on the road... I wasn't
thinking about my kid. Or my wife.
Stephanie nods.
RANDY (CONT'D)
My priorities were all fucked up. I
know that. But now... I wanna try
to make things right. I wanna try
to get to know you.
(lump in throat)
I just hope it's not too late.
Randy gazes off at the ocean, filled with fear and love and
regret. A tear starts to gather in his eye. He wipes it away
before it has a chance to form.
Stephanie looks at him, moved.
77.
Randy stands with Stephanie in front of her house, dropping
her off.
RANDY
Hope that wasn't too painful.
STEPHANIE
It was okay.
RANDY
Well...
Randy, unsure what to do, extends his hand.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Bye.
They shake. He pulls her in for a brief, mechanical hug.
STEPHANIE
Bye.
Another pause.
RANDY
So... How about dinner sometime?
STEPHANIE
Dinner?
RANDY
Maybe Tuesday?
Stephanie thinks it over.
STEPHANIE
I'm sorry. I don't think so.
RANDY
(nodding, "casual")
Or not. That's cool, whatever...
STEPHANIE
Wednesday would work better.
Randy is surprised and happy.
78.
Randy stands at the pay phone, ringing phone to his ear. In
his hands is his day planner, open to a page marked up with
upcoming gigs.
RANDY
Yo, Miggy. Ram. How ya doin'?
(BEAT)
Good, good.
(BEAT)
Listen, you're gonna have to count
me out for Utica.
(momentous pause)
I'm retiring.
Another call.
RANDY
Hey, how ya doin', Frank?
(BEAT)
Good, good. Listen...
Another call. Randy is holding the Fanfest flyer.
RANDY
Sorry, Volp. You know I'd kill to
do it.
(BEAT)
I realize. I understand.
(BEAT)
No more. I'm done. I'm retired.
(BEAT)
Positive. It's time to move on.
Randy emerges from Alyssa's building in the previous night's
clothes, squinting at the blinding sunlight.
Randy rings the bell. Stephanie's "friend" answers the door.
RANDY
Hey.
She stares at him coldly and unnervingly.
RANDY (CONT'D)
Is Stephanie home?
She goes into the house, closing the door behind her. Randy
stands there awkwardly, unsure what that meant.
He thinks about knocking but doesn't. He carefully turns the
knob, leaning into the house. From somewhere inside, he hears
the MUFFLED SOUND of Stephanie and The Friend talking.
Randy steps out the front door. Stephanie's cellphone rings.
She looks at the caller ID and picks up.
STEPHANIE
You can come home.
(BEAT)
He's gone.
She closes the door on him, disappearing inside the house.
Randy stands there alone on his daughter's front step. Unsure
what to do. He starts to CRY.
CUT TO:
Randy is on the pay phone.
RANDY
Nick. Randy The Ram...
(BEAT)
I wanna do it.
(BEAT)
Fanfest.
(BEAT)
I know, but I want back in.
(BEAT)
So call Bob, get the match back on.
(BEAT)
Pay me? Don't worry. Just cover my
expenses. And pay Bob. Make sure
he's there.
(BEAT)
I don't give a shit. I just wanna
wrestle.
He gets in the van.
RANDY
Got a match.
He grabs the Fanfest flyer off the passenger seat and hands
it to her.
RANDY (CONT'D)
See ya later.
He DRIVES OFF. She watches him go, the van kicking up dust in
its wake.
She looks at flier. A look of concern comes over her face.
Cassidy steps out of the club.
CASSIDY
(to self)
Pam.
104.
Randy stands at a ROADSIDE PAY PHONE, ringing phone cradled
to his ear.
STEPHANIE'S VOICE
This is Stephanie, you know what to
do.
(answering machine BEEP)
RANDY
It's me. I promise I won't call you
ever again.
(BEAT)
I'm going back to the ring. You
were right about me. Everything you
said. Anyway... I just wanted you
to know...
(BEAT)
Your daddy loves you.
(BEAT)
That's all.
He hangs up.
Randy's van is pulled over on the side of the interstate.
Randy pulls into the empty-ish parking lot of the GREENVILLE
CIVIC AUDITORIUM.
LATER
Cassidy pulls into the lot. There's a lot more cars than when
Randy pulled in.
