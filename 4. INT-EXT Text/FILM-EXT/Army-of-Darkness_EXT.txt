nestled in a dark forest. Through the window, we see the tiny
figure of Ash picking up a book from a desk.
ASH (V.O.)
I first saw the damn thing at that
blasted cabin. The Necronomicon.
An ancient Sumarrian text, bound
in human flesh and inked in human
blood. It contained bizarre burial
rites, prophesies...and
instruction for demon
resurrection. It was never meant
for the world of the living.
DISSOLVE TO:

We take the point of view of a wind-like demon, swooping low
through the woods toward the cabin.
CAMERA rips through the
cabin door and comes upon a SCREAMING Ash.
ASH (V.O.)
It got into my hand and it went
bad.
6
CLOSE ON ASH'S POSSESSED HAND							6
twisting into a claw, before the flashing thunder clouds.
ASH (V.O.)
So I lopped it off at the wrist.
7
The Time vortex is created.
Trees and a 1973 Delta 88
Oldsmobile are sucked up into the funnel cloud.
ASH (V.O.)
...I just didn't plan on coming
along.
Ash, now armed with shotgun and chainsaw, is swallowed by the
funnel-cloud of the Time vortex.
18
All is quiet.
Then, an electrical disturbance in the shape of
a human body flashes briefly and is gone.
A moment latter, Ash
appears and tumbles from the sky, falling past CAMERA.
19
ASH falls to the dust.
His double barrelled shotgun lands
beside him.
The '73 Oldsmobile comes CRASHING to the ground
a moment later.
20	 ASH												 20
looks up from the dust to behold...
21	 TWENTY-FIVE MOUNTED HORSEMEN							 21
in 12th century armor ride up over a hill.
They halt before
Ash.
22	 WARRIOR #1
22
thrusts his longsword into the air, shouting:
WARRIOR #1
Hail to him who has come from the
sky to deliver us from the terror
of the Deadites!
Hail!
23	 ASH												 23
stares in confusion at the strange medieval figures.
24	 TWENTY-FIVE WARRIOR									24
join in the chant and hail Ash, but suddenly stop as...
25	 ARTHUR
25
the muscular commander of the group, gallops his horse into
frame, followed by FOUR HORSEMEN who are his lieutenants. Arthur
lifts his iron visor and evaluates Ash.
26	 ARTHUR'S P.O.V.
26
The Delta 88 Oldsmobile. The chainsaw, strapped to Ash's back.
The handless stump of Ash's right arm.
The Shotgun.
27	 A FRIGHTENED ASH
27
waves a shaky hand.
ASH
Take is easy now chief. I don't
know how I got here and I'm not
lookin' for any trouble.
28	 WISEMAN JOHN
28
An elderly man, in a long black cloak, steps forward.
WISEMAN JOHN
My Lord Arthur, I believe he is
the promised one, written of in
the Necronomicon.
29	 ARTHUR
29
Brings his sword down across Ash's chest. Ash cries out in pain
as...
30	 ASH'S CHEST
30
is cut. A thin red gash.
ARTHUR
He bleeds.
As a man bleeds.
The
one written of in the Book would
not bleed.
31	 ARTHUR GESTURES
31
and CAMERA PANS to four prisoners bound in iron shackles.
ARTHUR
Likely, he is one of Henry's men.
I say to the pit with him!
If he
is truly the promised one... he
will emerge.
WARRIOR #2 AND #3
Aye!
The pit's a fair test!
GOLD TOOTHED WARRIOR
To the pit with the blackard!
32	 GOLD TOOTH
32
charges his horse at Ash. But he is met with the wooden stock
of Ash's shotgun as it swings into frame, cracking against his
jaw.
33	 WIDE SHOT - GOLD TOOTH - STUNTMAN						 33
He tumbles from the horse.
34	 ASH												 34
leaps atop Gold Tooth's horse and jerks the reigns.
35	 LONG SHOT - ASH'S HORSE								 35
rears up, kicking it's hooves into the air.
36	 ASH												 36
gallops off as Warrior #2 runs at him. Ash kicks him in the face
as he gallops past.
The Warrior is sent reeling.
37	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH									37
galloping over a hill.
He is almost thrown by the horse, but
manages to hang on for dear life.
ASH
Where the hell they put the
stirrups on this thing!!??
38	 CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S FEET								 38
grasping at the side of the horse, hoping to find some purchase.
39	 LONG SHOT - ASH - STUNTMAN

40	 ANGLE ON ARTHUR

ARTHUR
LIEUTENANTS!
Fetch me the blackard.
41	 TWO OF ARTHUR'S ARMORED HORSEMEN

Warriors watch for sport.
42	 HIGH SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN								42
They are gaining an Ash.
43	 ASH												 43
glances behind him.
44	 ASH'S P.O.V. - TRUCKING SHOT - TWO HORSEMEN IN PURSUIT		44
They diverge to either side of CAMERA.
45	 ASH												 45

ASH
GIDDYPU!
46	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 46
rides up alongside Ash and swings his Broadsword.
WHOOSH!!!
47	 ASH												 47
ducks the blade.
48	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									48
rides up alongside Ash's other flank.
He swings and lands the
flat part of his blade along Ash's back.
THUNK!
49	 ASH												 49
ducks as the first horseman swings his blade again.
WHOOSH!
ASH looks left...
50	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									50
winds up for another blow.
51	 ASH												 51
yanks back upon his horse's reigns.
52	 THE THREE HORSES
52
running side by side. Ash's horse drops back suddenly.
53	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									53
swings.
54	 HIS BROADSWORD										54
slams the First Horseman across the face.
55	 THE FIRST HORSEMAN									 55
is knocked from his steed.
56	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE FIRST HORSEMAN						56
is moving fast when he hits the ground. His armored form tumbles
end over end in the dust, clanging to a halt against a rock.
57	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									57
turns around and gallops back toward Ash.
58	 WIDE SHOT - ASH AND THE SECOND HORSEMAN					58
ride at one another.
59	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND SWORDMAN AS HE RIDES
59
swinging his Broadsword.
60	 TRUCKING SHOT - ASH AS HE RIDES
60
He inserts the stump of his right arm into the female end of
his chainsaw arm bracket.
FOOMP!
He twists his stump and the chainsaw bracket locks into
place.
CLINK!
He thrusts his chainsaw arm outward, pulling on the starter
cord; PUTT-PUTT-PUTT... The engine won't turn over.
He curses
and yanks again.
61	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									61
draws close. He leans from his horse and swings his Broadsword
mightily.
The flat portion of the blade connects. THUNK!
62	 ASH												 62
is knocked from his steed.
He tumbles to the dust, narrowly
escaping his own horse's hooves.
63	 ASH												 63
rolls to his feet and spins to the sound of approaching hooves!
64	 THE SECOND HORSEMAN									64
charges and swings his broadsword.
65	 ASH												 65
raises his chainsaw.
CLINK!
He deflects the blow. Ash swings
the chainsaw in a roundhouse motion, clipping the Second
Horseman as he rides past.
66	 TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN
66
is knocked from his horse.
67	 LOW TRUCKING SHOT - THE SECOND HORSEMAN					67
bounces along the rocky ground, kicking up dust.
68	 A SWORD HANDLE										68
slams against the back of Ash's skull.
69	 ASH												 69
crumples.
He looks up in pain to...
70	 ARTHUR
70
above him. The sun over his shoulder.
71	 EIGHT MOUNTED WARRIORS
71
gallop up, dismount and surround Ash with swords drawn.
ARTHUR
Bring the prisoner!
The warriors surge upon Ash. His sawed-off shotgun and chainsaw
are taken from him.
ASH
No!
72	 GOLD TOOTH AND OTHER WARRIORS							72
secure Ash to a set of iron shackles that painfully extend his
arms. A collar forces his neck upward.
ARTHUR
To the castle!
73	 WARRIOR #2 ON HORSEBACK								 73
prods Ash along with a rod attached to his spiked iron collar.
The Warriors gallop off, forcing Ash and the other prisoners
to run alongside them.
74	 WISEMAN JOHN
74
Picks up the chainsaw and sawed off shotgun from the dust.
He
is troubled by the strange objects. Sunlight glints off the
blade of the chainsaw, blinding the CAMERA.
DISSOLVE TO:
75	 THE HOT ORB OF THE SUN
75
blazing in the sky above the wasteland.
DISSOLVE TO:

bound in his iron shackles, whipped by Gold Tooth, who rides
alongside him.

Move along now!
DISSOLVE TO:
77	 LONGSHOT - A WIND SWEPT LANDSCAPE OF CRAGGY ROCK			 77
CAMERA PANS along the line of Arthur and his horsemen, to find
a 12TH CENTURY BATTLE CASTLE built on the edge of a great cliff.
A drawbridge is lowered.
Arthur's warriors ride over it.
78	 CAMERA TRACKING WITH ASH								78
shackled alongside other prisoners, is prodded inside the castle
walls.
162
fly from a barren tree.
163	SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS
163
It prowls, skimming the surface of the ground, moving swiftly
past rocks and over the crest of a hill revealing...
164
A massive grouping of freestanding rectangular stones, each
twenty feet tall.
The remains of an ancient temple.
In the
center of the ruins there burns a roaring bonfire.
As old Woman
stirs a cauldron atop the flames.
Nearby, Arthur converses with
his four Lieutenants.
CLOSE UP - ASH
opens his mouth to allow a spoonful of food to enter.
No sooner
has he swallowed then a piece of fruit is offered.
He waves
it away with a satisfied burp and turns to drink from a goblet
on wine, brought to his lips by a female hand.
166	ASH AND SHEILA										166
sits across the flames from Arthur and his men.
She bandages
Ash's wounds.
167	SHEILA
167
is dresses in a revealing tunic. She looks good.
SHEILA
I pray thee to forgive me.
I
believed thee one of Henry's men.
She touches Ash's hand. Ash turns away
ASH
First you wanta kill me, now ya
wanna kiss me.
He spits out a mouthful of grape seeds.
ASH
Lady, just leave me alone.
SHEILA
I'm sorry m'lord. Please
understand... T'is a cruel time
for us. The Wisemen say you are
the promised one. Our only hope
against the darkness that has
descended on this land.
ASH
They're mistaken.
She stares deeply into his eyes.
SHEILA
I think not.
I feel that there
is reason for your being here.
It is no accident.
166	WISEMAN JOHN AND TWO OTHER CLOAKED WISEMEN
167
approach.
They sit in tall stone chairs across the fire from
Ash.
ASH
Well what is it?
Can you send me
back or not?
WISEMAN JOHN
Only the Necronomicon has the
power.
A power which we both
require. It contains passages that
can dispel the Evil from this
place and return you to your time.
ASH
The Necronomicon. Yeah, that's
the thing that got me here.
WISEMAN JOHN
It is in a place far from here.
It can only be retrieved by the
Promised one. Other Warriors have
tried.
Their widows grieve still.
We have waited long years for you.
Out only hope is the Necronomicon.
Thou must undertake to quest for
it.
Alone must thou travel to
a distant cemetery. There thou
shalt find it.
ASH
Me?
Now way, no day. Only place I'm
goin' is home.
A sudden gust of wind whips up the flames of the fire.
169	DOGS												169
around the fire begin to snarl and fight.
170	ASH AND SHEILA										170
turn to see...
171	THE OLD WOMAN										 171
now standing too close to the fire.
Her robes ignites.
She does
not respond as flames sweep up her body. She continues to stir
the caldron.
172	ASH												 172
His haw drops.
He slowly stands as...
173	THE BURNING WOMAN
173
spins sharply to him.
Her voice changes as she SHRIEKS;
POSSESSED WOMAN
YOU SHALL DIE!
Her eyes are bone white.
She is POSSESSED by the dark spirit.
Her burning body is violently jerked about in the air by
invisible hands. Her blackened lips pull back in a wild animal
snarl. With two voice at once;
POSSESSED WOMAN
YOU SHALL NEVER WIN THE
NECRONOMICON.
WE SHALL FEAST UPON
YOUR SOUL, AND THEN THE SOUL OF
MAN!
174	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									174
collapses. Her face turned away from the Wisemen as it lays in
the dust.
175	CLOSE ON POSSESSED WOMAN'S FACE - GROUND LEVEL CAMERA		 175
Unseen by all, her bone white eyes flare open!
A nasty grin forms
on her face as she lies in the dust. Behind her, the Wisemen
approach.
176	WISEMAN JOHN
176
kneels and reaches for her.
177	ASH'S HAND
177
clutches Wiseman John, not allowing him to touch her.
ASH
It's a trick.
Get an axe.
178	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									178
awakens from her false slumber with a terrible BARK.
In a
frenzy she hurls WISEMAN JOHN into the bonfire. He SCREAMS and
rolls in the dust, extinguishing the flames.
179	PAPER MACHE STONE ARCHWAY
179
With her great strength, the Possessed Woman pushes upon one
of the giant stone archways. It topples over, crushing two
warriors beneath it.
180	A GIGANTIC STONE
180
topples the next stone.
BOOM!
Which topples the next, which sets off a chain reaction.
BOOM!
BOOM!
Like giant dominoes, they fall.
181	ASH												 181
watches the spectacle in horror as he sees...
182	ANGLE ON											 182
The gigantic falling stones coming right at SHEILA!
183	THE FALLING STONE'S P.O.V. - SHEILA
183
She SCREAMS!
184	SHEILA'S P.O.V. - THE FALLING STONES
184
coming toward CAMERA.
BOOM!
BOOM!
BOOM!
185	ASH												 185
does a flying leap and tackles SHEILA, knocking her out of the
stone's deadly path.
186	ASH AND SHEILA										186
rolls across the dusty stone courtyard.
187	CLOSE SHOT - ASH
187
rolls into frame and glances up to see...
188	THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN
188
rushing through the air at him with a SHRIEK!
189	WIDE SHOT - THE POSSESSED AND BURNING WOMAN				 189
latches onto Ash like an iron trap, knocking them both to the
ground.
190	ASH												 190
rolls the Possessed Woman over, and into the path of...
191	ANGLE ON											 191
The falling, gigantic domino-like stones.
BOOM!
BOOM!
BOOM!
THE POSSESSES WOMAN
SHRIEKS in agony as... SMASH!
The multi-ton stone crushes her
legs to paste.
Her legs are pinned but still she battles on,
clutching Ash about his throat!
193	ASH												 193
gasps for breath as he reaches behind him, into the flames of
the fire, his fingers groping for a weapon.
194	POSSESSED WOMAN - STOP MOTION ANIMATION					194
Her blackened lips pull back and her mouth opens to an
impossibly large size, like a snake about to eat an egg.
195	ASH												 195
grasps a flaming log with his bare hands and rams it down the
monster's oversized throat.
She chokes.
196	GOLD TOOTH AND THREE OTHER WARRIORS
196
grab the beast and pull it off of Ash.
Arthur comes to meet
them.
He carries a double-bladed battle axe.
197	THE POSSESSED WOMAN									197
vomits out the flaming log, taking off a man's head.
POSSESSED WOMAN
The Evil lives.
Slay me and ten
will rise to take my place.
All
will die.
ALL WILL -
CHOP!
198	IN SILHOUETTE, THE AXE
198
is brought down upon her throat.
The possessed body flails and
spasm beneath the Warrior's grip.
199	THE HEAD											 199
rolls, and comes to a halt at Ash's feet.
It's eyes pop open!
POSSESSED WOMAN'S HEAD
---DIE!
200	ARTHUR
200
grabs the laughing head and tosses it into the darkness.
The
head sails away as the laughter receded.
WISEMAN JOHN
Now.
Will thou quest for the
Necronomicon?
201	CLOSE ON ASH
201
He considers.
213
ASH
stares over the castle wall to the foreboding wasteland with
apprehension.
The wind blows upon his hair. Sheila appears
behind him. She drapes a grey garment over Ash. A magnificent
cape. Ash draws her body close to his. He wraps the cape around
her.
Together they stare off into the night, then turn to one
another and kiss.
DISSOLVE TO:
214
Arthur's castle in the distance.
In the foreground, five men
on horseback appear over a ridge, thundering toward us. Their
long wool capes billowing up behind them in the wind.
215	CLOSER ON RIDERS - TRUCKING SHOT
215
Arthur and Wiseman John ride, flanked by two of Arthur's
Warriors.
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL...
ASH
He wears an iron breastplate with the insignia of Arthur's army
that compliments his new spring-powered iron hand.
His chainsaw
juts from it's saddle holster on the horse's back.
Ash's cape
billows as he rides.
DISSOLVE TO:
The Horsemen wind down a trail.
Suddenly the horses rear up.
The men gain control of the frightened steeds.
ASH
What's going on?
ARTHUR
points to...
217	THE TRAIL THAT LIES BEFORE THEM
217
It disappears abruptly into a swirling wall of mist that emits
an eerie whistling.
WISEMAN JOHN
This is the edge of the land ruled
by the Dark Spirit. This path will
lead you to an unholy place. A
cemetery. There, the Necronomicon
awaits.
218	ASH												 218
anxiously eyes the wall of swirling mist.
219	THE TWO WARRIORS
219
finish placing saddlebags of water and food onto...
ASH'S HORSE
which nervously pounds the earth with it's hooves.
WARRIOR #1
Lord Arthur, he is supplied.
Now
I beg of you, let us leave this
foul place.
ARTHUR
A moment.
220	WISEMAN JOHN
220
moves close to Ash.
WISEMAN JOHN
As thou removest the Book from
it's cradle, you must recite these
words.
Clatoo, verata, Nicto.
ASH
Clatto Verata Nicto.
Okay.
WISEMAN JOHN
Repeat them.
ASH
Clatto Verata Nicto.
WISEMAN #1
Again.
ASH
I got it.
I got it.
I know your
damn words. All right?
Now you get
this straight: I get the book,
you send me back. That's the deal.
After that I'm history.
Ash rears up on his horse and gallops into the mist
221	ARTHUR AND WISEMAN JOHN								 221
watch as Ash disappears.
222	IN A SEA OF MIST
222
The sound of THUNDEROUS HOOFS.
A form materializes out of the
fog:
It is Ash.
223	CLOSER ON ASH										 223
He whips the horse.
ASH
HAAAAAA!
224	ANGLE ON ASH
224
He gallops past.
CAMERA PANS as he disappears into the thick
fog.
FADE OUT.
225
ASH
rides out of the wall of mist. He finds himself on a trail
leading into a thick forest.
226
LONG SHOT - ASH
rides slowly on through the darkening woods.
227	CLOSER ON ASH										 227
He hears a sound and look to...
228	A SECTION OF WOODS									 228
A branch SCRAPING against the bark of a tree.
229	ASH												 229
hears a woman's soft laughter.
He glance to...
230	A BUBBLING BROOK
230
and nothing more.
231	THE EVIL FORCE P.O.V.
231
powers through the woods toward Ash.
232	ASH												 232
kick his steed and bolts.
233	THE EVIL FORCE										233
sweeps over the forest floor, gaining velocity.
234	ASH												 234
frantically weaves his horse around storm felled trees which
jut from the ground.
235	THE EVIL FORCE										235
rips through the trees, splintering them to toothpicks.
It
burrows underground, and resurfaces, always closing upon Ash.
236	ASH												 236
jerks upon the reins and his steed leaps a fallen tree.
He
gracefully leaps a second tree.
But as he leaps over the third,
he is ripped off the horse by a low branch.
He falls hard to
the mud as the horse gallops off.
He groggily stands and stumbles onward.
237	THE EVIL FORCE										237
follows Ash down a wooded trail.
238	ASH												 238
running for...
239
a grain storage house in the clearing ahead.
240	ASH												 240
comes upon the shed's door.
Locked.
He heaves his body against
it but it won't give.
ASH
Come on!
Come on!
The chainsaw dies. He jerks out his arm to restart it. Putt.
Putt.
ASH
Blasted piece of junk!
248	THE EVIL FORCE										248
draws closer.
249	ASH												 249
delivers a mighty kick to the door.
260
The roof of the shed ripples, sending tiles and wood beams
flying as the EVIL FORCE surges through the shed like a tidal
wave.
261
It blows out from the place in a flying stack along with the
other doors.
The flying doors slam against a tree and fall to
the ground in a stack.
262	THE EVIL FORCE										262
with Ash out of sight, glides forward, into the woods.
263
LOOKING DOWN UPON - THE STACKS OF DOORS.
All is quiet.
We hear the sound of a bolt moving. The doorknob
turns slightly.
The door swings upward and opens... revealing
a somewhat flattened Ash who picks his groggy and bruised self
up.
He beholds...
An empty place of stone and wood.
Driven by the wind, the
Mill's giant grinding wheel slowly turns with a squeak.
268
a gigantic ball of fire as it sets behind the Mill.
The wind
kicks up.
280
The tiny figure of Ash steps from the Mill.
281	CLOSE UP - ASH										281
He sweeps the barrel of the shotgun toward the sound of sticks
breaking.
282	ASH'S TERRIFIED HORSE
282
It rears up on it's hind legs. It's front hoofs come down toward
Ash.
283	A STARTLED ASH										283
leaps aside just in time.
284	ASH												 284
snags the horse's reigns.
ASH
Easy, boy.
The horse calms.
Ash ties it to a tree, patting it's head. A
shadow passes behind him. He turns toward the Mill.
285	ASH'S P.O.V.
THROUGH THE MILL'S OPEN DOOR
285
He sees am image of himself inside the Mill. Peering out.
ASH
stares in disbelief, then the wind slams the front door of the
Mill, halting Ash's view. Ash races for the Mill.
335
ASH
staggers about in a frenzy, stumbling over logs and through the
brambles.
He races up to the CAMERA and cries out as this
protrusion upon his shoulder becomes more pronounced.
ASH
Dear God, it's growing bigger!
336	THE PROTRUSION SWELLS AND GROWS LARGER.					336
It's taking the shape of a twin human head as it emerges from
his shoulder. A head that looks similar to his own, but is Evil
incarnate.
He is now a man with two heads!
337	TWO HEADED ASH										337
Staggers through the woods like a drunkard, the two identical
heads trading insults, and sharply butting against one another.
338	THE BAD ASH HEAD
338
opens it's mouth and bites the nose of the Good Ash head.
339	THE GOOD ASH HEAD
339
retaliates by gouging the eyes of the Bad Ash head.
340	TWO HEADED ASH										340
collapses against a tree.
Under the light of the full moon we
see a terrifying sight:
341	TWO ADDITIONAL ARMS									341
sprout from Ash's body!
342	A LEG
342
rips out of his stomach.
Another foot POPS out from his back.
343	TWO HEADED ASH										343
Like a human spider he scurries about the forest floor,
propelled by his four arms and four legs.
Suddenly he stands
and SHRIEKS as the EVIL ASH begins to pull away from the first.
He literally splits into two.
344	SPLIT SCREEN - WIDE SHOT								344
When it's over, there are two ASHES.
GOOD ASH and...
345	BAD ASH.											 345
They square off beneath the moonlight.
346	HIGH SHOT AS THE TWO ASHES
346
circle one another like wolves.
GOOD ASH
What... are you?
Are you me?
BAD ASH
WHAT... ARE GOO?
ARE GOO ME?!!
You
sound like a jerk!
GOOD ASH
Why are you doing this?!
BAD ASH
Wanna know?
'cause the answers
easy. It's cause I'm the bad Ash,
and yer...
347	EVIL ASH											 347
Dances a funny jig around Ash.
He SMACKS Ash across the face
as he sings:
EVIL ASH
...Little goody two-
SMACK!
...shoes, little goody two-
SMACK!
...shoes, little good--
348	EVIL ASH											 348
the shotgun barrel is suddenly shoved into his frame, pointing
at his nose.
BLAMMITY-BLAM!
The blast blows Evil Ash off his feet.
349	WIDE SHOT - EVIL ASH - STUNTMAN
349
blown backwards into a double backflip.
350	EVIL ASH'S BODY
350
slams against a tree, upside-down. Then slides to the ground,
quite dead.
351	GOOD ASH											 351
clutching the smoldering shotgun.
GOOD ASH
Good...Bad...I'm the Ash with the
gun.
352	LONG SHOT - ASH
352
staring down at the body of his evil self.
ASH
I know better than to bury you
whole.
353
The giant blades of the Mill are illuminated with bright flashes
of lightning.
The wind kicks up leaves as Ash throws the body
of his Evil Twin onto a workbench at the base of the windmill.
The giant blades of the mill arc down into frame with a WHOOSH-
WHOOSSH-WHOOSH!
354	MONTAGE SEQUENCE:
354
Ash's hand light a torch.
355	FRIGHTENED BATS FLY									355
from the base of the windmill.
356	CHAINS ARE PULLED TIGHT								 356

It spews a plume of blue exhaust.

falters for a moment as he stares down at the form of his Evil
twin.
He grits his teeth... and lowers the saw to the grisly
task.

We hear the distant WHINE of the chainsaw.
360
ASH
with shovel in hand, drags a bloody burlap bag from the Mill.
Grunting, he pulls the remains of his Evil twin to the base of
an old Oak Tree in the graveyard.
Ash mumbles nervously to the bloodies burlap bag at his feet
as he digs a grave.
ASH
Now you see what's what.
Man's
body is his own personal property.
Don't anybody try to take that
away from him.
361	ASH												 361
finishes digging and lifts the bloody burlap sack.
As he heaves
the bag into the grave, the Evil Ash head spills out.
A violent storm in the distance.
Lightning flashes.
401
ASH runs for his horse, clutching the Necronomicon.
402	A BONEY HAND
402
rips up from a grave and grabs his leg!
403	ASH												 403
falls.
404	THE BOOK OF THE DEAD
404
is knocked from Ash's hand.
405	ASH												 405
reaches for it when a SECOND skeleton hand rips from the ground
and clutches his face.
406	THE FIRST SKELETON HAND								 406
digs into Ash's mouth.
It jerks his face sideways to show
him...
407	A GROUP OF SIX ROTTED ARMS
407
that rip from the ground!
408	THE SKELETAL HANDS									 408
toss Ash to...
409	THE ROTTED ARMS
409
grab Ash's head and bang it on a rock.
Two of the six arms try
to shake and slap some sense into him. A rotted fist is waved
at him.
Another rotted arm backhands him. The arms thrust his
face toward the skeleton hands.
410	THE SKELETON HANDS									 410
curl boney fingers, clenching them into fists.
ASH
No.. no more...
The skeletal fists pepper Ash's face with punches.
ASH
Leave me alone!
Leave me aHUUU!
411	THE SKELETAL FINGERS
411
last out and snag Ash's tongue between their boney pincers,
shutting Ash up.
With his tongue held, he tries to speak again,
but the other skeletal hand slaps him, shutting him up.
Both
hands work double-time at slapping him.
412	UNDERCRANKED - ASH
412
His face has become a punching bag for the skeletal hands.
They
pull his ears and gouge his eyes.
413	ASH												 413
open his mouth wide with in a SCREAM!
414	SIDE SHOT - COLLAPSIBLE SKELETON ARM

A ROTTED ARM
rips through the ground, punching Ash in the stomach.
417	SIDE SHOT - COLLAPSIBLE SKELETAL ARM
417
ASH
jerks backward, vomiting out the skeletal arm.
He tumbles to
the ground.
418	THE ARMS											 418
reach for him, but he is too fast.
He stamps on one of the
skeletal arms, pinning it to the ground.
ASH
(in a snarl)
Keep you damn filthy bones outta
my mouth.
SNAP!
He breaks the boney arm in two and runs away from the sea
of limbs. A bone arm rips from the grave and reaches for the
Book of the Dead but Ash scoops it up first.
He leaps over
another set of groping arms that rip from the ground!
419	ASH CLIMBS
419
atop the horse. He glances back in fear to see...
The burial site of Evil Ash. A bolt of lightning strikes the
grave marker.
421	EVIL ASH'S BURIAL MARKER								421
is thrust from the ground. A hand breaks the surface of the
earth.
422	EVIL ASH'S BODY PARTS
422
fly up from the grave and assemble themselves into a lopsided,
decayed version of EVIL ASH!
423
ASH
stares in horror at his evil self. All around, skeletons rip
from the earth and shriek as they come back to life!
424	A FEARFUL ASH										 424
kicks the horse and rides off.
ASH ON HORSEBACK
galloping back the way he came. In the distance we see the
cemetery. More bodies arise from the ground.
Now far from the danger but still he rides hard.
ASH
I'm through bein' their garbage
boy.
I did my part of the
bargain.
He pats the saddlebag, where the book is and grins.
Now they owe me.
Like in the
deal.
I want back.
He whips his horse...
HA!
GIIDDUP NOW!!
...and rides off into the darkness.
DISSOLVE TO:

A tiny figure, rides toward the castle.
GOLD TOOTH and two guards stand atop a tower and shout down to
the gatekeeper.

THE DRAWBRIDGE
swings down.
430	ASH												 430
rides across the lowered bridge and into the torchlight of the
castle.
468
EVIL ASH
directs teams of skeletons to dig at the graves.
EVIL ASH
Dig!
Dig faster!
I want every black
hearted, worm infested, son of
a bitch that ever died in battle!
We'll storm their castle and take
the book!
Then my lads, eternal
life shall by ours!
469	STOP MOTION ANIMATION - THREE SKELETONS					469
hoist up a stone casket from the ground and with rusted swords
pry it open, releasing another skeleton who stands to join their
ranks.
470	TWO ARMORED SKELETONS
470
push a bruised Sheila to her knees before Evil Ash.
471	CLOSE ON SHEILA
471
looking up to Evil Ash in fear. His boney finger comes down into
frame and strokes her lovely cheek.
She pulls away in
revulsion.
472	EVIL ASH											 472
looks down at her with lust.
EVIL ASH
Why ain't you a sweet little
thing?
His boney digit caresses her lips.
SHEILA
Don't touch me!
You foul thing!
EVIL ASH
Your gonna learn to live me missy.
SHEILA
The Promised one will come for
you.
SKELETAL EVIL ASH
yanks her to her feet.
EVIL ASH
Darlin' I'm gonna save him the
trouble.
He clutches her squirming body in a boney embrace.
473
Silhouetted by the large full moon, Evil Ash forces his kiss
upon Sheila.
Around them, the skeletons sharpen their swords
on tombstones.
DISSOLVE TO:
474
Ash rides toward the castle of Henry the Red that can be seen
in the distance.

They
surround him.
HENRY WARRIOR #1
He wears the insignia of Arthur!
HENRY WARRIOR #2
Slay him!
The draw their swords when...
476	HENRY THE RED										 476
rides up between his warriors and Ash.
HENRY
Stay your arms!
Henry turns to Ash.
HENRY
T'is the stranger who spared me
from the pit. What brings you?
ASH
The Army of the Dead.
HENRY
What of them?
ASH
They're headed towards Arthur's
castle. We need your help. Fight
with us.
HENRY
So you are a vassal of Arthur now?
You have taken up sides with him
against me.
ASH
The only side I'm takin' is the
one that's gonna stop those
things.
Henry laughs.
HENRY
Why should I endanger my people
to save my enemy?
ASH
Because after they finish with
Arthur they'll come after you.
Together, we've got a chance.
Besides, you owe me.
EVIL ASH AND SHEILA
ride side by side on skeletal steeds.
Sheila lifts her black
veil, revealing bone white eyes, set into a face now the texture
of cracked leather.
She looks with admiration to...
478	EVIL ASH											 478
He is general of the army of Deadites. He thrusts a rusted sword
into the air and shouts in a gritty voice:
EVIL ASH
Who rules?!

walls.

ASH
walks along, inspecting a line of forty medieval warriors who
stand at attention. He halts before a warrior and stares hard
at him. The Warrior glances towards Ash.
ASH
You eyeballin' me boy?
WARRIOR #9
No, M'Lord.
ASH
I can't hear you!
WARRIOR #9

ASH
You squeekin' like a mouse!

WARRIOR #9
NO, M'LORD!
ASH
Where you from, mouse?!
WARRIOR #9
I hail from the village of Perth.
ASH
Only two things come from Perth:
steers and queers. Which are you?
ASH

He mixes them with sulfur.

SKELETON CAPTAIN
M'Lord!
We are positioned on both
fronts!
EVIL ASH
Where are they keeping my book?
SKELETON CAPTAIN #1
Most likely...there, in the

safest place.
It is behind two
walls that must be taken first.
EVIL ASH
Excellent. Proceed.

I had to find a place to crash.
For a very long time.

cave.
He sets the horse free.
ASH
YAHH!!
It gallops off.

Upon it, rest heaps of futuristic, yet rusted taxicabs

of iron and bone.
ASH
....I found that I had slept too

hear his terrified SCREAM!
CUT TO BLACK.
