      Dwight, wearing funeral clothes, paces nervously on the front 
      porch, checking his watch.

      Mose, on a 1940 s German motorcycle with sidecar, wearing an 
      odd fitting suit, practices guitar, slowly picking out  Oh 
      What a Beautiful Morning  from Oklahoma.  

                                    MOSE
                          (singing)
                    There s a bright golden haze on the 
                    meadow, there s a bright golden haze 
                  on the meadow.  The corn is as high 
                  as an elephant s eye, and it looks 
                  like it s climbing clear up to the 
                  sky.

      Mose looks up at Dwight.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Let s give them time.  They requested 
                  an early check-in.

      Dwight watches the road for three seconds.  No one emerges.  
    He sighs, then begins writing on a chalkboard by the front 
      door:  Be Back In...

                                    DWIGHT (CONT D)
                          (muttering to himself)
                  Four minutes there, four minutes 
                  back, thirty seconds to lower a 
                    coffin, someone s going to want to 
                  say something...

    He continues to write:  ...11 minutes.   Then Dwight walks 
      over to Mose.

                                    DWIGHT (CONT D)
                  Get in the sidecar.

                                    MOSE
                  No.



      Dwight drives the motorcycle and Mose rides behind him, 
      holding Dwight s waist.  No one is in the sidecar.    "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/126.


      We hear  Oh What a Beautiful Morning  from Oklahoma as Dwight 
      and Mose pass the following:  a broken tractor on the side of 
      the road; a giant tractor wheel; a beautiful forest of trees; 
      a moose; a stray dog or coyote; a backwoods boy on a scooter 
      that s stuck in the mud; migrant farm workers, hard at work.  

                                    LYRICS
                  Oh what a beautiful morning, Oh what a 
                    beautiful day.  I ve got a beautiful feeling 
                    everything s going my way.



      Dwight and Mose now stand with other Schrutes at a small 
      family cemetery on a hill.  (Mose stands next to ZEKE, and 
      they ad lib hellos.)  Dwight notices Oscar and walks over.

                                    DWIGHT
                  What are you doing here?

                                    OSCAR
                  You invited me, you threw the red 
                  dirt in my face.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Oh, yes.
                          (enjoys the memory)
                  Thanks for coming.  But if you still 
                  can catch that personal trainer, 
                  that s fine.

                                    OSCAR
                  I was able to reschedule for this 
                    afternoon.  He had an opening.

                  These things are usually just family, 
                    though.

      Oscar realizes that Dwight doesn t want him there, and Oscar 
      sees a chance for revenge.

                                    OSCAR
                  I was invited, and I m staying.

      BACK TO SCENE

      A rented Mustang drives up, way too fast.  The driver, JEB, is 
      excited to see Dwight and is waving and not paying attention 
      to where he s going.  He knocks over a gravestone and gets the 
      front corner wheel of his car stuck in the grave.  He tries to 
      back up and the wheels spin out.  He smiles.

                                    JEB
                  Look what I did!

      Oscar leans over to Dwight.

                                    OSCAR
                  Who is that?

                  You have a brother?



      Dwight now stands with Jeb.  (Oscar stands by Mose and Zeke.) 

                                    JEB
                  Neat shovel.

                                    JEB
                  I hear they got this new shovel, 
                  makes digging easier.

                                    DWIGHT
                  That makes no sense.  It can t make 
                  dirt lighter.

                                    JEB
                    Something about the handle.

      Zeke is speaking by the grave.

                                    ZEKE
                  You were my cousin s Aunt.  You were 
                  five feet four inches tall for most 
                  of your life, and by the end you were 
                  five foot one.

      Zeke steps back.  Oscar looks to camera,  huh?   Mose steps 
      forward.

                                    MOSE
                  You had dark hair, and then grey 
                  hair.

      He steps back.  Oscar turns to camera, getting it now.

                          (hushed)
                    They re a descriptive people.

      HEINRICH, the ancient brother of Shirley, steps up.

                                    HEINRICH
                  You were my sister.  And as your 
                    closest relative, the possessions 
                  that were yours now fall to me.  I 
                    suppose a thank you is in order.  If 
                    today s open house goes well -- has 
                    everyone met my realtor, David? 

    He motions to David, standing near him.

                                    HEINRICH (CONT'D)
                  -- I ll be able to leave this place 
                  in style.  Shirley, you ve made me 
                  very happy.

      A Nissan Leaf drives up, and FANNIE SCHRUTE, 29, and her son, 
      CAMERON WHITMAN, 9, get out and approach.

                  had to stop a couple times and it s 
                  not always easy finding an outlet.

      Dwight glances at her electric car and rolls his eyes.

                                    JEB
                  You know, they got this new electric

      Cameron shakes Dwight s hand extremely weakly.  Dwight is 
      openly disgusted by it, and Fannie breaks their hands apart.

      A pick-up truck pulls up and parks right by the grave.  Behind 
      the wheel is HENRY, 50 s, and in the truck bed are his five 
      daughters of various marriageable ages.  Two of them, ESTHER, 
      30, and HELENA, 23, are quite attractive.  No one gets out of 
      the truck.

      Dwight does not hide his interest in Esther.

                  I see Esther is back in town.

                  two chicken necks with a single 
                    motion, why use two motions?

      Dwight smiles at Esther, and Esther smiles back.  Fannie 
      notices the exchange.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Sure.  This is the road.  We might 
                  widen it soon.

                    Sometimes I look around this place 
                  and I think, this is America, you 
                  know.  If only Andy Warhol could have 
                  stayed here, he d have loved it.

                                    FANNIE
                    I think he was parodying Americana.

                  No, I don t-- Henry David Thoreau.  
                  Jack London.  Is this a crazy 
                    thought?  The world s most 
                    sophisticated thinking takes place 
                    outdoors, in the country.

                  I bet there s truth in that.

      Fannie looks at camera.



      The group walks along an old ranch fence.

                  Your fence is falling apart.

                  We could take this older wood, carve 
                  a few holes, put in some spores, we 
                  got mushrooms in a year.  That s 
                    income.  
                          (to Haskins)
                  Leave the wood upright, so the 
                    mushrooms think they re in a tree.

                                    DWIGHT
                  That s great.  Jeb, I bet if you had 
                    a fence this simple, competing gangs 
                  would run in and steal your  crop.

                  Like a prison.  Sometimes you must 
                  wonder whether it s keeping them out

                  you re in a scary business.

                    Dwight, why don t you let the Haskins 
                  know about your farm s dangers.

                                    DWIGHT
                  No dangers.  You are safer than in

                  Are there bears around here, Dwight?

                                    FANNIE
                  Answer carefully, Dwight.  If you say 
                  no, it means we re all very safe.

                                    DWIGHT

                                    FANNIE
                  But it also means you don t have much 
                    experience with bears and you re not 
                  an expert on them.

      Dwight considers for a long time.  Fannie and Jeb enjoy 
      Dwight s predicament.

                                    DWIGHT
                          (blurting)
                  We have bears!

      MONTAGE OF THE FARM TOUR

      1)  Dwight tries to open the barn door, but it is stuck.  He 
      struggles.

      2)  Dwight shows them a small slaughter house.  Fannie can t 
      believe this is part of the tour.

      3)  Dwight opens a tiny door on the side of the barn.  Hens 
      emerge and walk out and down a tiny ramp.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1227.


      4)  All try to open the barn door together.  It s a struggle, 
      but they manage to open a few feet.  They cheer.



      Dwight, Jeb, Fannie and the Haskins turn the corner and find 
      Cameron, sitting in a tree swing, wearing his blazer, reading.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Oh, hey there.  Isn t this 
                    picturesque, a boy in the wilderness, 
                  our own Huck Finn.

                                    CAMERON
                          (deep in his book)
                  You know, scholars are saying Huck 
                  Finn was based on a local  negro  
                  boy, as they were known back then.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Heh heh, right.  Cameron, have you 
                  met the Haskins?  As we say today, 
                  they are  black. 

                                    CAMERON
                  Nice to meet you.

    Mr. Haskins offers Cameron his hand.  Cameron offers his own 
    and shakes hands weakly, almost like a lady.  Dwight flinches 
    at the sight.  The others continue toward the house but Dwight 
      stays back with Cameron.

                                    DWIGHT
                  Are you trying to put me out of 
                    business?

                                    CAMERON
                  Are you sure you re in business?

                                    DWIGHT
                  That handshake, that gross wilting of 
                  your limb, it s horrifying.  Just 
                  shake hands normally.  You are not 
                  the queen.  I know that s hard for 
                  you to hear.

                                    CAMERON
                    I shake hands fine.

                                    DWIGHT
                  On this farm, we shake hands one way.  
                  And you will learn it.

                  Extend your hand first, before I do.  
                  It s commanding.

      Cameron extends his hand.

                                    DWIGHT (CONT D)
                  Where are you looking?  At your own 
                  hand?  Look in my eyes.

      Cameron looks up.  Dwight takes Cameron s limp hand.

                                    DWIGHT (CONT D)
                    Squeeze my hand.

                                    CAMERON
                  I am.

                                    DWIGHT
                  That s not a squeeze.  Hurt me.

                                    CAMERON
                    I don t want to hurt you.

      Dwight then notices something in the grass beneath them.  He 
      reaches down, grabs a snake, and puts it in Cameron s hand.  
      Cameron is scared.

                                    DWIGHT
                    Squeeze it to death or it will kill 
                  you.

                                    CAMERON
                  Uncle Dwight...

                                    DWIGHT
                  Kill it!

      From across the field, Fannie sees them.

                                    FANNIE
                  Oh my god!!  Cam!!

                          (near tears)
                  What do I do?

      Cameron somehow manages to toss it to the side as Fannie runs 
    up.  She hugs Cameron.

                  Relax, it doesn t even have fangs.

      The snake bites Dwight s boot and latches on.

                  Just a common garden snake.

      Dwight nonchalantly kicks it loose, but it won t let go.

                                    FANNIE
                    Dwight, my god, just when I thought 
                  you weren t just another -- forget 
                  it.  Forget it all.  We re leaving in 
                  the morning.

      Fannie walks Cameron back to the house.  Dwight watches her go 
      as Jeb walks up.

                                    JEB
                  She seemed mad.

                                    DWIGHT
                    A little bit.

                                    JEB
                  Hey, don t beat yourself up.  It 
                    wouldn t have mattered anyway.

                    I couldn t have done it.  I ve got a 
                  good thing going in Cali.  We re 
                  going to have a killer harvest soon.   
                    I can t give it up.  I know you 
                  wanted the land.  Sorry.

      Dwight takes it in.  Jeb, nothing else to say, walks back to 
      the house, leaving Dwight in the middle of the field as he 
      realizes it s over.

                                                                          FADE TO:

      Dwight walks toward the barn.  Twenty feet behind him, Cameron 
      follows.



      Dwight, now alone, is on his cell phone, on HOLD.  He speaks 
      to camera.

      Fannie puts the last suitcase in the back of the car.

                  Come on, let s get out of here.

                  Can I finish my pumpkin buscuit?  I 
                  can become a little nauseated when I

      He sits in the hatchback, holding the basket of muffins.

                                    FANNIE
                  Yeah, of course.

                  How can you even ask me that?
                  -- God, these biscuits are warm and 
                  moist -- They are a bunch of idiots.

      Cameron shrugs.

                                    FANNIE (CONT D)
                  What does that mean?

                    They re not idiots.

      Fannie looks at his face, confused as she realizes that 
      Cameron might like it here.  But that s not enough to change 
      her mind.  She sees Dwight and Jeb approaching.

                                    FANNIE
                  Come on, we should go before our

                    Fannie...
                          (difficult to say)
                  I need this.

                    I could use it, I wouldn t mind it, 
                  no big deal.
                          (whisper)
                  I need it bad, Fan-Fan.

                  I m sorry, I don t.  Cameron.  "The Farm" Writers First Draft - 7/30/1242.


      She motions to the car and gets in herself.  Cameron 
      hesitates.  Then he walks up to Dwight, looks him right in the 
      eye, and offers his hand.

      Dwight takes it, and they shake.  Cameron s grip is firm.  
      Dwight gives him a small nod of approval.  Cameron can t help 
      but seem very happy.

      Angle on Fannie, in the car, watching, her breath taken away.

      Cameron gets in the car, but Fannie doesn t drive away.  
      Dwight looks at her, unsure of what s going on.  Then she 
      looks back at him and he realizes that she just changed her 
      mind.

      Then Mr. Haskin comes stumbling out of the house, holding his 
      throat.  Mrs. Haskin runs after him, holding an Epipen.  

                                    MRS. HASKIN
                  Call 911!

      Mrs. Haskin drives the Epipen into Mr. Haskin s neck.



      Dwight, Fannie and Jeb look out over Shirley s farm -- now 
      their new farm.

                                    JEB
                  This is no nine acre worm farm.  This 
                  is a beast.  Whoever s managing this 
                  will have a hell of a job.  Not it.

                                    FANNIE
                  Not it.

                                    DWIGHT
                            (deliberate)
                  It.

      They walk to their new farm.  As they do, we reveal Heinrich, 
      just out of their view.  Heinrich takes a decent size rock, 
      zeroes in on Dwight s head, and throws with all his might.  
    The rock flies about four feet, well short of the target. (We 
      hear Ray Charles  upbeat version of  Oh What A Beautiful 
      Morning. )
