      We re inside a beat-up, 1985 Volvo sedan.  An air freshener 
      in the shape of the infamous trucker  mudflap  girl sways 
      from the rearview mirror - only this one is reading a book.

      ANGLE ON our driver, KAT STRATFORD, 16, smart, sarcastic, and 
      sharp-tongued.  She HONKS LOUDLY at the car in front of her.

                                  KAT
                          (at driver)
                    Nice turn signal, douchebag!

      We PULL BACK to reveal BIANCA STRATFORD, 15, in the passenger 
      seat.  She s perky, pretty and applying eye liner in the 
      visor mirror with an open US Weekly as a guide in her lap.

                                  BIANCA
                          (sarcastic)
                    This is fun.  It s like being 
                    driven to school by the Hulk.

      Kat taps the breaks, causing Bianca to smear.

                                  KAT
                    Hulk mad.

                                  BIANCA
                    Kat!  I m going for Amy Adams, not 
                    Amy Winehouse.  We re starting a 
                    new school and first impressions 
                    are crucial.

      She cleans up the smudge, then puts her make-up away.

                                  KAT
                    Please.  We re talking about 
                      teenagers.  They re impressed by 
                    shiny objects.

                                  BIANCA
                    Thus, my earrings.

                                  KAT
                    High school is something you 
                    survive.  And in just two short 
                    years I ll escape this Hell for the 
                    hallowed halls of--                            10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 2.


                                  BIANCA
                          (heard this before)
                    Brown.  Where you ll burn your bra 
                    and debate offshore drilling while 
                    I turn your room into a pilates 
                    studio.

                                  KAT
                    I ll be in the Ivy League and 
                    you ll be... popular.  Just like 
                    you ve always been.

                                  BIANCA
                    Excuse me?!  Popularity doesn t 
                    just happen.  I ve worked hard at 
                    it since kindergarten.  Last year I 
                    had forty-two pictures in the 
                    yearbook.  As a Freshman!  Then Dad 
                    gets a new job and I have to start 
                    from scratch.

                                  KAT
                    All we can do is be ourselves.

                                  BIANCA
                    Spoken like a true unpopular 
                    person.  There is so much more we 
                    can do!  

      She pulls out a stack of papers.  On top is a printed 
      Facebook profile of CHASTITY CHURCH, 16.  Kat can t see it, 
      because she s driving.

                                  BIANCA (CONT D)
                    I ve conducted exhaustive Facebook 
                    research with the goal of 
                      identifying the most popular girl 
                    at this school.  I then memorized 
                    her profile so that I can easily 
                    befriend and beguile her. 

                                  KAT
                    Beguile.  Nice one, Shakespeare.

      Kat s CELL PHONE RINGS.  The screen reads  Dad.   She shows 
      it to Bianca and pushes the speakerphone button.

                                  KAT/BIANCA
                    Hi Dad.

      We INTERCUT with DR. WALTER STRATFORD, mid-40 s, who s 
      dressed in scrubs and standing in what appears to be a 
      hospital.                            10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 3.


                                  WALTER
                    Girls, I m sorry I couldn t be 
                    there to make you pancakes this 
                    morning.  But you never know when 
                    the stork is gonna pay a visit.

                                  KAT
                    Dad, you realize we know where 
                    babies come from, right?

                                  WALTER
                    But do you realize where they come 
                    out?  Trust me, not pretty.

                                  BIANCA/KAT
                          (grossed out)
                    Dad!

                                  WALTER
                    I m just saying, boys want to put a 
                    baby in you.  Are we clear, Bianca?

      Kat is a bit miffed at being omitted.

                                  BIANCA
                    Well they ll have to do it in-
                    vitro, since I can t date until Kat 
                    does.

                                  WALTER
                    Great, we re clear on the rules.  I 
                    only make them because you girls 
                    mean everything to me.  I only wish 
                    your mom was here to see what 
                    smart, sophisticated young women 
                    you ve become.  She d be so proud.

                                  BIANCA/KAT
                          (touched)
                    Thanks, Dad.

                                  WALTER
                    She would also want you to know 
                    about the rising rates of syphilis--

                                  BIANCA/KAT
                    GOODBYE DAD!

      Kat hangs up.  Bianca gathers her things.

                                  BIANCA
                    Pull over here.  I don t wanna be 
                    seen in this car.                            10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 4.



      The school is abuzz with students.  CAMERON, 15, a Tom-Hanks-
        in-training, struggles to fit his saxophone case in his 
      locker.  He gets it in and slams the door, revealing MICHAEL, 
      15, whose outfit shows he s trying too hard to be hip.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Hey sophomore!

                                    CAMERON
                          (off his outfit)
                    What are you wearing?

                                    MICHAEL
                    A new look for the new Michael.  
                    Over summer I grew two inches, 
                    sprouted six chest hairs, and 
                      discovered the power of Proactiv.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT'D)
                    Good-bye Lil  Mikey.  Hello  
                    Michael, emo-hipster musician.

                                    CAMERON
                    You play piccolo in the marching 
                    band.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Cameron, high school is how you 
                    spin it.  Even the biggest dorks 
                    can be cool if they play their 
                    cards right.  Look at Shia LeBeouf.

                                    CAMERON
                    I don t care about cool, I just 
                    want a girlfriend.  And every girl 
                    here remembers third grade when I 
                    wet my pants during the tornado 
                    drill.

                                    MICHAEL
                    OK, can we cancel the suicide 
                    watch?  This is our year!  Change 
                    is in the air.

      A HAND ENTERS FRAME and grabs Michael s collar.  The camera 
      WIDENS OUT, revealing BIG E, 16, big and brutish.

                                  BIG E
                    Lil  Mikey!  What are you doing 
                    outta your locker?

      He picks Michael up in a fireman s carry and takes him away.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Big E, how was your summer, man?  
                    You heard the new Radiohead?  It 
                    slays.

      Cameron watches him go, then turns and is face-to-face with 
      Bianca.  She s fumbling with her locker.  His eyes go wide in 
      love at first sight.  She notices him.

                                  BIANCA
                    Do you know how to work these 
                    things?

                                    CAMERON
                    Uh... sure.

      He heads over, she hands him her combination.  He looks at 
      it, his hand slightly shaking from nerves.                            10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 7.


                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                      Seventeen, thirteen, eleven.  Great 
                    combo.  You ll never forget it.
                          (off her confusion)
                      Descending prime numbers.  

                                  BIANCA
                    Yay, math.

      He starts working the combination.  Bianca is scanning the 
      hallway for popular people.

                                    CAMERON
                    So, you re new here?

                                  BIANCA
                    Yep.  My family just moved here 
                    from Ohio.

                                    CAMERON
                    The Buckeye State.  State bird the 
                    northern cardinal.  State flower 
                    the scarlet carnation.
                          (catching himself)
                    But you already knew that.

                                  BIANCA
                    Not really.  Sounds like you re 
                    getting a top notch education here.

                                    CAMERON
                    It s pretty much your typical 
                    suburban high school.  Nothing 
                      exceptional about it.
                          (beat, sotto)
                    Until now.

      He opens her locker.  She places her books inside.

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                    Well, if you need any directions or 
                    class advice or... CPR, I m 
                    Cameron.

                                  BIANCA
                    Bianca.

      She gives him a quick smile, closes her locker and leaves.

                                    CAMERON
                          (sotto)
                    I love you.                            10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 8.



      Kat and Chastity sit across the desk from PRINCIPAL HOLLAND, 
      40 s, a stern looking schoolmarmish type.

                                  PRINCIPAL HOLLAND
                          (deadly serious)
                    Girls, tell me what happened?

                                  CHASTITY
                    What happened is this...
                          (sizing up Kat)
                    Girl?... mauled my Mini-Cooper.

                                  KAT
                    No, I asserted my right to park--

                                  PRINCIPAL HOLLAND
                          (to Chastity, concerned)
                    Are you OK, my dear?

                                  CHASTITY
                    My neck does hurt a little.

                                  KAT
                    I doubt it s because your brain is 
                    too heavy.

                                  PRINCIPAL HOLLAND
                          (to Kat, concerned)
                    I want you to go see the nurse.  
                    After all, we can t risk our head 
                      cheerleader having an injury just 
                    days before the first pep rally!

      Kat looks at her in shock.  Is she for real?

                                  CHASTITY
                    OK, but I want to press charges.

                                  PRINCIPAL HOLLAND
                    Let me handle it.  I don t want 
                    this little fracas to take up any 
                    more of what I hope will be a 
                    marvelous first day!

      She ushers Chastity out with a smile.  Then turns to Kat, 
      deadly serious again.

                                  PRINCIPAL HOLLAND (CONT D)
                    I think you should write a letter 
                    of apology.  And a donation to the 
                    family Foundation couldn t hurt.                            10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 9.


                                  KAT
                    You re joking, right?  She s the 
                    one who thinks she owns--

                    Listen...
                          (reading folder)
                      Katherine, it s your first day at 
                    Padua High School.  I can tell from 
                    your transcripts you ve got big 
                    things in your future.  I suggest 
                    you focus more on that and less on 
                      antagonizing the daughter of the 
                    School Board Superintendant.

                                  KAT
                          (in shock)
                    This is a public school, where 
                    every student has the right to be 
                    treated with dignity and respect.

                    Save it for your journal, honey.

      She ushers Kat to the door and opens it, revealing Patrick 
      sprawled out in the chair in the waiting area, hammering a 
      stapler with his fist.  He s chewing on a toothpick.

                                  PRINCIPAL HOLLAND (CONT D)
                    Mr. Verona, what a surprise.  Come 
                    in.

      Patrick stands and enters the doorway as Kat leaves.  They re 
      forced to maneuver face-to-face.  He locks onto her with his 
      intense, scary gaze.

                                  KAT
                          (re: his breath)
                    Instead of the toothpick, try a tic-
                    tac.

      She pushes by him and leaves.  He watches her go as he closes 
      the door.


      Bianca and Chastity walk down the hallway. 

                                  CHASTITY
                    Project Runway?

                                  BIANCA
                    Love it.  Want Tim Gunn to 
                    officiate my wedding.

                                  CHASTITY
                    We are so alike it s scary.
                          (seeing someone)
                    Hold on.

      She walks over to JOEY DONNER, 16, with Abercrombie ad good 
      looks. She leaps up, straddling him, and they start making 
      out furiously.  Bianca stands there, awkwardly.  They part.

                                  CHASTITY (CONT D)
                    Bianca, this is Joey Donner.  My 
                    boyfriend and our starting 
                      quarterback.

                                  JOEY DONNER
                    Babe, I told you I don t know if 
                    I ll be starting this Friday.

      Chastity hops down as the bell RINGS.

                                  CHASTITY
                    Let s hope so.  I don t date second

                          (to Bianca, sincere)
                    See you at tryouts.  I really hope 
                    you don t suck!

      She leaves them both deflated.

                                  BIANCA
                    Bye!
                          (to Joey)
                    She s a spitfire, huh?  I can see 
                    why you love her.

                                  JOEY DONNER
                    Yep.  She s the best.

      Beat.

      They laugh at the situation as Joey opens the classroom door.

                                  JOEY DONNER
                    After you.

      They head into:


      They pass in front of the TV hanging on the wall, where two 
      students are reading the announcements. A burst of LOUD 
      STATIC interrupts the broadcast.  This grabs everyone s 
      attention.  A figure appears wearing a Darth Vader mask.

      Cameron is filming Michael in the AV Closet.

      He pulls off the mask as Cameron hurriedly disconnects his 
      video camera from a box marked  closed circuit television. 

                                    CAMERON
                    Hurry!  If we get caught I ll get 
                    kicked out of the AV club.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Please, you re one of two members.

      Michael checks his phone.  The display reads:  You have 259 
      text mssgs. 

                                    MICHAEL
                    Oh, it worked.  Nice wookie, by the 
                    way.


      Walter is putting the finishing touches on dinner.  Bianca 
      and Kat sit on opposite sides of the table screaming.

                                  BIANCA
                    You have ruined my chances at being 
                    popular!

                                  KAT
                    I m sorry, but that girl sucks.  
                    She s a teenage Kim Jong-Il!

                          (are you kidding?)
                    Kim Jong-Il?!  The dictator of 
                    North Korea?!

                                  BIANCA
                    North Korea?!  We re talking about 
                    our high school where I m going to 
                    be unpopular!  My life isn t worth 
                    living.

                                  KAT
                    Yes, it s way worse than having 
                    bound feet or wearing a burkah.

                                  BIANCA

      Both girls go quiet.  They respect their father.

                                  WALTER (CONT D)
                    Bianca, I know you re upset.  But 
                    Kat s right, you are a little too 
                    obsessed with popularity.  You need 
                    to put things in perspective.

      Bianca is pissed.  Walter hands her a bowl of pasta.                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 19.


                                  BIANCA
                    May I be excused?  I don t need to 
                    carbo load.  I m not running a 
                    marathon tomorrow.

      Walter nods.  Bianca grabs her dinner salad and heads to her 
      room.  Kat turns to her dad.

                                  KAT
                    Thanks, dad.

                                  WALTER
                    For what?

                                  KAT
                    For agreeing with me that 
                      popularity is a shallow, 
                      superficial thing to pursue.

                                  WALTER
                    Oh, I don t agree with you.

                                  KAT
                    What?

                                  WALTER
                    I ve still got physical and 
                    emotional scars from the wedgies I 
                    got in high school.  But popular 
                    kids are the ones having sex and 
                    I m not ready to be a grandpa.  Now 
                    pass the garlic bread.

      Kat can t believe him.  She pushes herself back from the 
      table, and we REVEAL she s been sitting in a wheelchair.

                                  KAT
                    How long do I have to use this in 
                    the house?

                                  WALTER
                    Until you learn that a car is not a 
                    toy.  Today s accident could ve 
                    been a lot worse.

                                  KAT
                    I told you, it wasn t an accident.

      She wheels over to the bread, annoyed.                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 20.



      Kat finishes the last page of her book:  Contemporary 
      Feminist Fiction.   She smiles, satisfied, then closes it and 
      puts it on the night stand.  She turns off the light.  
      Bedtime.

      A hand SLAMS DOWN on Kat s mouth.  Her eyes go wide in shock.  
      Then, as if she s prepared for this, she bites down hard.

                                  BIANCA
                          (sotto)
                    Owww!  You bit me!

      A hand turns on the light.  It s Bianca, dressed to the 
      nines.  She checks her hand for bite marks.

                                  KAT
                    That s the first thing you learn in 
                    my  Victims No More  class.

                                  BIANCA
                    Where are your car keys?  I have to 
                    go to that party and tell Chastity 
                    you re adopted.

                                  KAT
                    You re not taking the car.  You 
                    haven t even had Drivers Ed.

                                  BIANCA
                    It s a big go-cart.  How hard can 
                    it be?

      She spots the keys on the dresser.  But before she can grab 
      them, Kat sweeps in and takes them.  She looks at Bianca 
      defiantly.

                                  BIANCA (CONT D)
                    Fine.  You drive me.

                                  KAT
                    Not a chance.

                                  BIANCA
                    I ll tell dad you re not a virgin.

      Kat look at Bianca: you wouldn t.  Her look back says she 
      would.

                    You have one hour.                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 21.



      There s a large group of teenagers standing in a group, 
      looking angrily at someone.

      We ANGLE ON who they re looking at: a terrified Cameron. 

                                    CAMERON
                    See, I didn t realize the person 
                    who throws the party is also 
                    supposed to supply the alcohol.

      The group looks at him in unison: Duh!

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                    I have a case of Coke Zero.

      Michael BURSTS IN from the kitchen rolling a keg on a dolly.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Keg is here!  Courtesy of me... 
                    Michael Bernstein.  Sophomore.  
                    Musician.  Legend.

      The group attacks the keg.  Michael moves over to Cameron.

                                    CAMERON
                    How d you get a keg?

                                    MICHAEL
                          (sotto)
                    It s non-alcoholic beer.

                                    CAMERON
                    What?!  Oh my God, they re gonna 
                    kill us.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Relax.  By the time they realize 
                    they re not drunk, we ll have 
                    called the cops.

      Cameron sees the logic in that as the front door opens and 
      Bianca enters.  Cameron walks, hypnotized, over to her.

                                    CAMERON
                    Welcome to my home.

                                  BIANCA
                    Thanks, Cameron.  It s nice.

                                    CAMERON
                          (off decor, awkwardly)
                    I can t take credit.

                    I have a gay uncle who dabbles in 
                      decorating.  His theme was suburban 
                    rain forest.

      Cameron is mortified at himself.

                                  BIANCA
                    How interesting.  Listen, do you 
                    know if Chastity is here?

                                    CAMERON
                          (getting an idea)
                    I don t.  But I can help you look.

      He takes her hand and walks her into the sea of people.


      Kat sits with her bunny slippered feet on the dash.  She s 
      working through a Sudoku puzzle when... 

      VROOOOM... VROOOOM....

        A motorcycle headlight illuminates Kat s face.  She squints 
      to see Patrick across the street, staring at her creepily. 

                                  KAT
                          (fed up)
                    OK, enough.

      She pulls her keys out of the ignition, grabs something out 
      of her glove compartment and opens the door.  


      Cameron leads Bianca in from the back. 

                                    CAMERON
                    She s not in the garage.  So tell 
                    me more about life in Ohio.  

                                  BIANCA
                          (scanning the room)
                    We had a good outlet mall.

                                    CAMERON
                      Fascinating.  What stores?

      She walks off, and Cameron follows.  As they pass, we PUSH 
      INTO the party to find Chastity, wearing Bianca s SAME 
      BLOUSE!  She approaches Joey and pulls him into:


      Chastity yanks the string turning on the light.  

                                  CHASTITY
                    Is it true?

                                  JOEY DONNER
                          (flustered)
                    I swear I never showed anybody our 
                    video.                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 24.


                                  CHASTITY
                    No, is it true that Tommy is 
                    starting in Friday s game?

                                  JOEY DONNER
                          (busted)
                    Yeah.  Coach said I need to work on 
                    my three-step drop.

                                  CHASTITY
                    Which is what you should have been 
                    doing all summer instead of taking 
                    those stupid modeling classes.

                                  JOEY DONNER
                    Or maybe this is a sign that I 
                    should pursue it?

                                  CHASTITY
                    Joey, I m the youngest head 
                      cheerleader in the history of Padua 
                    high school.  I am going to date a 
                      quarterback, not a catalogue model. 

      Annoyed, she pulls the string, turning off the light, and 
      leaves.  Joey sits in the dark for a beat.  He cracks the 
      door, and sees what he thinks is her back.  He reaches out 
      and pulls her into the closet.

                                  JOEY DONNER
                    Look, I can be high fashion!

      The light goes on.  It s Bianca.  He s surprised and 
        embarrassed.

                                  BIANCA
                    OK...?

                                  JOEY DONNER
                    Sorry, I thought you were Chastity.  
                    She thinks I m stupid because I 
                    want to be a male model.  But check 
                    this out.

      He strikes a series of macho high fashion poses.

                                  BIANCA
                      Impressive.

                                  JOEY DONNER
                    Right?  I m making it look easy, 
                    but modeling is hard work.  People 
                    think it just happens.                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 25.


                                  BIANCA
                    I know how you feel.

                                  JOEY DONNER
                    No way, you want to model too?

                                  BIANCA
                    Well, I...

                                  JOEY DONNER
                    I think you could.  You ve got 
                    great bone structure.

      He brushes her cheekbone.  They re both momentarily caught up 
      in the intimacy.  Then they snap out of it, and Joey drops 
      his hands.

                                  BIANCA
                    I should go.

                                  CHASTITY (O.C.)
                    Joey, why aren t you chasing after 
                    me?

      The door flies OPEN revealing Chastity.  She glares at them, 
      then turns on Bianca.

                                  CHASTITY (CONT D)
                    How dare you.

                                  BIANCA
                          (covering)
                    It s not what you think.  We have 
                    Chemistry together.
                          (beat)
                    The class, not the...
                          (changing the subject)
                    Hey, we match!

                                  CHASTITY
                    Get out.

      Knowing there s no way out of this, Bianca leaves.  She walks 
      by Cameron, who s got a new spark of hope.


                                  END OF ACT TWO                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 26.


                                      ACT THREE


      Kat is in her wheelchair eating cereal and reading the 
      newspaper.  Her father sits across from her eating toast.

                                  KAT
                          (off article, into paper)
                    We re the world s last  superpower  
                    and yet we don t have universal 
                    health care?

                                  WALTER
                    Are you talking to me or the 
                    Democrats in your head?

      Bianca comes in, sullen and lifeless.

                                  BIANCA
                    Dad, have you seen that box of my 
                    old piano sheet music?

                                  WALTER
                    No.  Why?

                                  BIANCA
                          (dour)
                    Since I m not going to be popular, 
                    I figure I ll try out for show 
                    choir.  Closeted gay guys are fun. 

      She leaves. 

                                  WALTER
                    She doesn t seem like herself.

                                  KAT
                    I know, isn t it great?
                          (off Dad s look)
                    C mon Dad, she s obsessed with what 
                    other people think.  Mom wouldn t 
                    approve.

                                  WALTER
                    Your mother saw Bianca s ability to 
                      fearlessly dive into any social 
                    situation as one of her best 
                    traits.

                                  KAT
                    She did?                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 27.


                                  WALTER
                    She also loved your respect for 
                    others and your sense of fairness.  
                    That s why I find it strange that 
                    someone so passionate about 
                    universal health care could lack 
                    any compassion for her own sister.

      Kat soaks that in.  She looks over at her dad.

                                  KAT
                    Wow, you re good.

                                  WALTER
                    You re the one who played the dead 
                    mom card.  I just served it back.  


      Kat and Bianca pull into a spot.  

                                  KAT
                    You OK?  You didn t complain once 
                    about listening to NPR.

                                  BIANCA
                    I was debating whether to sing a 
                    song from  Annie  or  Cats.   My 
                    sheet music is a little dated.

                                  KAT
                          (trying to be comforting)
                    Bianca, there s a reason the voting 
                    age is eighteen.  These imbeciles 
                    aren t worthy of an opinion.  Who 
                    cares what they think?

                                  BIANCA
                    I care!  I m not like you, Kat.  I 
                    don t have your thick skin.  My 
                    skin is thin and soft and supple.   
                    You can survive high school alone.  
                    I can t.

      Kat soaks that in.  She never knew Bianca felt that way.

                                  KAT
                    You re not alone--

                                  BIANCA
                    Mom is with me?  Enough with the 
                    dead mom card.                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 28.


      As Bianca gets out and walks away, we see Kat wasn t talking 
      about her mother.  She watches Bianca walk past Chastity and 
      a group of cheerleaders huddled around her Mini-Cooper.  
      Chastity smirks at Bianca and whispers to her friends.  The 
      injustice of it all hits Kat.  


      Cameron is brushing his hair in his locker mirror, trying to 
      get ready for Bianca s arrival.

                                    MICHAEL (O.C.)
                    Sorry you got busted.  I forgot 
                    about the placebo effect.

      Cameron closes the door, revealing Michael.

                                    CAMERON
                    Someone barfed into the urn holding 
                    my grandfather s ashes.

                                    MICHAEL
                    Are you grounded forever?

                                    CAMERON
                    Two days.  My parents are less 
                    angry and more relieved that I have 
                    enough friends to throw a party.  

                                    MICHAEL
                    Fear not.  Soon enough, we will.

      Michael spots Big E.  He falls in step with him.

                                    MICHAEL (CONT D)
                    Big E!  How about my party last 
                    night?  Who knew you could karaoke 
                    like that?

      Ignoring him, Big E shoves Michael like he s swatting a fly.  
      Michael flies off camera.  Cameron sees Bianca heading his 
      way.  He smiles hopefully.  She smiles halfheartedly.

                                    CAMERON
                    Why the long face?

                                  BIANCA
                          (honest)
                    Starting over here is harder than I 
                    thought.

                                    CAMERON
                    And yesterday was just Monday.  
                    Today is Tuesday.  
                                  (MORE)                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 29.

                                    CAMERON (CONT'D)
                    Which means it s bean burrito day.  
                    After lunch, breathe through your 
                    mouth.

      Bianca chuckles at Cameron s joke.

                                    CAMERON (CONT D)
                    Speaking of lunch.  I d be honored 
                    to have the pleasure of your 
                    company. 
                          (embarrassed)
                    And I m talking like I m Louis the 
                      Fourteenth.

      Bianca chuckles.

                                  BIANCA
                    Save me a throne.

      She grabs her books and heads off.


      Chastity is applying lip gloss as several older cheerleaders 
      squeal behind her.  One, DAWN, 16, is close to 
        hyperventilating she s so excited.

                                  DAWN
                    Oh my God!  I love this part.  
                    Seeing all their crushed, sad 
                    little faces.  It makes me realize 
                    how lucky we are.

                                  CHASTITY
                    And we should never forget it.  
                    I ll meet you girls out there.
                          (off lips)
                    I m going to do a second coat.  
                    Build the suspense. 

      The other girls leave, excited.  As Chastity puts on gloss, 
      Kat comes out from one of the stalls, a camera around her 
      neck.  Chastity gets wary.  Mandella steps out of another 
      stall and blocks the exit.

                                  CHASTITY (CONT D)
                    OK, I don t wanna be a part of some 
                    lesbo prison fantasy.

                                  KAT
                    I m here to talk about my sister.                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 30.


                                  CHASTITY
                    What a coincidence!  I was just 
                    about to push her off the social 
                    ladder.

                                  KAT
                    Look, Bianca and I are completely 
                    different people.  I want to be 
                    somebody.  She wants to be...you. 

                                  CHASTITY
                    Big deal.  Every girl in this 
                    school wants to be me.  Plus the 
                    guys in show choir.

                                  KAT
                    Put her on the squad.  

                                  CHASTITY
                    Not a chance.

      Chastity heads for the door.  Mandella braces for a fight.

                                  CHASTITY (CONT D)
                    Move it, Elphaba.

      Kat takes her picture.

                    What are you doing?  

      Kat takes another picture.

                                  CHASTITY (CONT D)
                    Stop!  I wasn t ready.

                                  KAT
                    This morning I signed up to be 
                    yearbook photo editor. 

                                  CHASTITY
                    I m sure that ll look great on your 
                    college applications.

                                  KAT
                    Which means I ll be picking all the 
                    pictures that go in it.  Let my 
                    sister on the squad or on every 
                    page you will be sporting a double 
                    chin, a muffin top, or cankles.

      Chastity processes this.                           10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 31.


                                  CHASTITY
                    I can t let her on the squad.

      Kat lifts the camera and takes another pic of Chastity.  

                                  CHASTITY (CONT D)
                          (panicked)
                    As a cheerleader!

      Kat looks at her.  What is she talking about?


      Bianca carries her lunch out into the sea of people.  She 
      sees Chastity posting the list on the announcement board.  
      Various girls squeal in excitement.  A few cry.  Cameron 
      waves her over to his table.  She makes her way over when 
      Chastity stops her.  

                                  CHASTITY
                    Listen, perhaps I was a little hard 
                    on you.  After all, you can t help 
                    who, or what, your sister is.  And 
                    Joey told me about his confusion.   
                    He s confused a lot.  And I guess 
                    buying the same blouse does show 
                    you have taste.

                                  BIANCA
                          (excited)
                    I asked a hundred people in Time 
                    Square who wore it best.  You won.

      Chastity looks across the room, where Kat holds up her 
      camera, threateningly.  Chastity continues.

                                  CHASTITY
                    I m prepared to give you a second 
                    chance, if you want it.

                                  BIANCA
                    I m a cheerleader?!

                                  CHASTITY
                    Ooooh, not quite. 
                          (off Bianca s confusion)
                    But you can be the mascot:  
                    Percival the Penguin!

      Chastity hands Bianca a pendant with a cute penguin on it.

                                  BIANCA
                          (deflated)
                    The mascot?                          10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 32.


                                  CHASTITY
                    You d be a full member of the 
                    squad.  One of us, only covered in 
                    fur.

      Bianca thinks for a moment.

                                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


      SFX: RING

      Bianca is trying to stuff a giant penguin head into her 
      locker. It s never going to fit.  Cameron approaches.

                                  BIANCA
                    Sorry I didn t sit with you at 
                    lunch, Cameron.

                                    CAMERON
                    You missed a very educational 
                    debate about the identity of the 
                    last Cylon.
                          (conceding defeat)
                    Congrats on making the squad.

                                  BIANCA
                    Thanks!  Now if I can only pass 
                    French.  It s way beyond what I had 
                    in Ohio.

      Cameron sees a way in.

                                    CAMERON
                    I could tutor you.  I mean, if you 
                    want.

                                  BIANCA
                    You would do that?

                                    CAMERON
                          (gibberish French)
                    Voulez sou le bou en sans ze deux.

      Beat.  Cameron hopes that worked.

                                  BIANCA
                    See?  I did not get any of that.  
                    You re a life saver, Cameron.

      She hugs him.  He smells her hair.  Heaven.                            10 THINGS - WRITER'S FIRST DRAFT 33.


                                  BIANCA (CONT D)
                    See you tomorrow.

                                    CAMERON
                    Adios.
                          (realizing)
                    I mean, ciao.

      Bianca leaves with the penguin. Suddenly hopeful again, he 
      writes  Learn French  on the To-Do list inside his locker.
