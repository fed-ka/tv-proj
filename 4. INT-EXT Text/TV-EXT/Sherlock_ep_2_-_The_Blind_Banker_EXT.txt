      Isle of Dogs. 1am.

      A taxi pulls up outside an apartment block...  

      Plush city flats, each with a private balcony.

      A man jumps out - EDDIE - early 30 s, chalk pin-stripe, red 
      braces. He can only be a banker. Throws a twenty at the 
      DRIVER.

                                  TAXI DRIVER
                    You wanna receipt?

    But EDDIE doesn t stop to reply. He s is a blind panic. He 
      rushes up to the apartments, drenched in sweat, and punches 
    the key pad. 

      Doors open. He bolts inside.




                                                                                4.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10



      JOHN and SHERLOCK on a busy London street.

      There, in front of them, are the spires of the City of 
      London... 

    The Gherkin and Tower 42. The biggest banks in the land.



    On the corner of Bishopsgate... 




                                                                              10.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


      A gigantic cathedral of steel and glass - the most high-
      tech, swanky new building in the city. SHERLOCK and JOHN 
      enter.

      A gleaming sign reads:  SHAD SANDERSON . Investment Bank. 















































                                                                              10A.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10



      SHERLOCK and JOHN exit the building.

                                  JOHN
                    You think we should sniff around 
                    here a bit longer?




                                                                              16.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


                                  SHERLOCK
                    Got everything I need to know 
                    already, thanks.

















































                                                                              16A.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


      SHERLOCK strides off up the street. JOHN scuttling after.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    That graffiti is a message, John. 
                    For someone at the bank - working 
                    on the trading floor. We find the 
                    intended recipient and...

                                  JOHN
                    He ll to lead us to the person who 
                    sent it.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Obvious.

                                  JOHN
                    Three hundred people up there. Who 
                    was it meant for?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Pillars.

                                  JOHN
                    What?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    The pillars. And the screens. 

    And whoosh! We re on the trading floor - SHERLOCK dancing 
      between the pillars, looking for a clear view.

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (V.O.)
                    Very few places where you could see 
                    the graffiti. That narrows the 
                    field considerably.

      Back on the street.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    And of course - the message was 
                    left at 11.34 last night. That 
                    tells us a lot. 

                                  JOHN
                    Does it?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Traders come to work at all hours. 
                    Some people trade with Hong Kong in 
                    the middle of the night.

      Whoosh! The time zone clocks, changing in unison.

      Whoosh! The suspended metal signs - Sterling; Dollars; Yen.




                                                                              17.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


                                  SHERLOCK
                          (V.O.)
                    That message was intended for 
                    someone who came in at midnight.

      Focus on the sign:  HONG KONG DESK HEAD .

      SHERLOCK standing in the glass-walled office next door to Sir 
      William s. A clear view of the graffiti.

      Back on the street. 

      SHERLOCK reaches into his jacket. He has stolen the name sign 
    off the desk:  VAN COON .

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Not many Van Coon s in the phone 
                    book.

      They hail a cab and climb in.



      Establishing shot.



      EDDIE VAN COON S apartment block. A set of buzzers outside, 
      labelled with the names of the tenants. EDDIE VAN COON lived 
    on the sixth floor.

      SHERLOCK rings. No answer. Rings again. Still no answer.

                                  JOHN
                    What are we gonnado now, then? Sit 
                    here and wait for him to come back?

      SHERLOCK checks the buzzers. The one directly above EDDIE S - 
      seventh floor - is labelled  WINTLE .

    The label is brand new.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Just moved in.

                                  JOHN
                    What?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Floor above. New label.

      JOHN observes the pristine label on the buzzer.

                                  JOHN
                    Could have just replaced it.



                                                                              18.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


                                  SHERLOCK
                    Nooneever does that.

    He rings the buzzer - seventh floor.

      A WOMAN S VOICE answers.

                                  WOMAN
                          (O.S.)
                    Hello?

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (Speaking into the buzzer)
                    Hi. I live in the flat just below 
                    you. I don t think we ve met.

                                  WOMAN
                          (O.S.)
                    No. Well - I ve just moved in.

      SHERLOCK casts a victorious glance at JOHN.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I ve actually locked my keys in my 
                    flat.

                                  WOMAN
                    You want me to buzz you in?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I want to use your balcony.

                                  WOMAN
                    What?



      SHERLOCK is on the WOMAN S 7th floor balcony - he climbs over 
    the edge so he can lower himself down on to VAN COON S.

    He slips and almost plummets to his death. The WOMAN gasps, 
    but he carries on with an elegant smile and lowers himself 
      down. 

    VAN COON S patio door slides open when he pushes it.

      A man in a wild panic - runs across a busy London street at 
      night. Cars swerve to avoid him - beeping.

      He s BRIAN LUKIS. Scruffy, unshaven, 40 s. Anorak and jeans.



      LUKIS arrives at a front door and jams his key in the lock - 
      a converted Victorian house. Four floors.  Peeling paint.

      Slams the door behind him.



      A grim Doctor s surgery. Early morning. Establishing shot.



      Establishing shot.



      ANDY GALBRAITH in his coat, ringing on a door bell.

    No response. Tries again. The name on the doorbell says  SOO 
    LIN YAO .

      There is a new phone book on the doorstep - recently 
      delivered but not collected.

      ANDY finds an old envelope in his pocket, scribbles a short 
      message and stuffs it through the letter box.

    The camera pulls out. 

    SOO LIN S flat is in London s Chinatown, above a shop - an 
    old Chinese emporium:  THE LUCKY CAT . 



      SHERLOCK and JOHN crossing Trafalgar Square.

      SHERLOCK is on a roll...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    The world runs on codes and

                    pin machine you took exception 
                    to... cryptography inhabits our

                                  JOHN
                    Yes. OK. But...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    But it s all computer generated. 
                    Electronic codes - electronic

                                  SHERLOCK (cont'd)
                    This is different: it s an ancient 
                    device. Modern code-breaking 
                    methods can t unravel it. 

                                  JOHN
                    Where we headed?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I need some advice.

                                  JOHN
                    What? Sorry?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You heard me perfectly. I m not 
                    saying it again.

                                  JOHN
                          (A broad smile)
                    You need advice.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    On painting. Yes. I need to talk to 
                    an expert. 

      They make for the National Gallery. But then SHERLOCK cuts 
      down a side alley.

                                  JOHN
                    Where... where are you going? 
                    Sherlock?



    The back of the National Gallery - an alleyway.

    RAZ is a nineteen year-old skateboard punk: hoody, baseball 
    cap and over-sized jeans. He has a kit bag at his feet and an 
      aerosol can in hand. 

    He sprays a stencil on to the rear wall of the gallery - a 
      policeman with a pig s face.

    RAZ knows SHERLOCK is there without even turning.

                                  RAZ
                    Part of my new exhibition.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Interesting.

                                  RAZ
                    I call it  Urbanbloodlustfrenzy. 

                                  JOHN
                    Mm. Catchy.



                                                                              35.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


                                  RAZ
                    I ve got two minutes before a 
                    Community Support Officer comes 
                    round that corner. Can we maybe 
                    talk whilst I m working?

      SHERLOCK offers him the phone. RAZ hands the spray can to 
      JOHN so he can look.

      Flicks through the photographs. The images from the bank and 
    the library.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Know the author?

                                  RAZ
                    I know the paint. Looks like 
                    Michigan, hardcorepropellant. I d 
                    say zinc. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    And what about the symbols? Do you 
                    recognise them?

                                  RAZ
                    It s not a tag. I m not even sure 
                    it s a proper language. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Two men have been murdered, Raz. 
                      Deciphering this - it s the key to 
                    finding who killed them.

                                  RAZ
                    This is all you got? Not much to go 
                    on.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You think you could help out?

                                  RAZ
                    I can ask around. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Someone must recognise it.

    Two COMMUNITY SUPPORT OFFICERS appear around the corner.

                                  OFFICER
                    Oi.

      JOHN forgets he is holding the paint can.

    The OFFICERS come running. RAZ surreptitiously kicks the kit 
    bag along the floor. It is now at JOHN S feet.




                                                                              36.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


                                  OFFICER
                          (To John)
                    What the hell do you think you re 
                    doing? This gallery is a listed 
                    public building.

    The OFFICER sees the fresh art - the pig-faced policeman.

                                  JOHN
                    Oh no, that wasn t me who painted 
                    it. I was just... Just holding this 
                    for...

      JOHN turns to... 

    RAZ and SHERLOCK have both run away.

    The OFFICER opens the kit bag. Inside is a whole stash of 
      paint.

                                  OFFICER
                    Bit of an enthusiast, are we?



      JOHN and SHERLOCK coming out the front door - JOHN still only 
      half-wearing his coat.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I ll go and see Van Coon s PA... If 
                    we can retrace their steps - 
                    somewhere they re going to 
                    coincide.

      SHERLOCK runs off up the street. JOHN is left alone. Sighs. 
      Acquiesces. Hails a cab.

    The cab draws up. He climbs in then glances round... someone 
    is on the pavement opposite, watching him.

    We only get the tiniest glimpse - a fleeting image as the cab 
      races away. A WOMAN dressed all in black? 

    She holds up her phone - is she photographing JOHN?

    The cab pulls away.



      A road sign.  SHAFTESBURY AVENUE .

      SHERLOCK outside the sandwich shop. Checks VAN COON S receipt 
      - matches the name.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    So. Bought your lunch. En route to 
                    the station. Where were you headed 
                    from? Where did the cab drop you 
                    off?

      Turns 180 degrees and walks away from Piccadilly. 

    He is so busy looking at the shops on this street he collides 
      with someone on the pavement.

      It s JOHN, coming in the opposite direction.

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (Excited)
                    Van Coon brought a package here the 
                    day he died.

                    Whatever was hidden inside that 
                    suitcase. I ve managed to piece 
                    together his movements using scraps 
                    of information...

                                  JOHN
                      Sherlock...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    ... credit card bills and receipts. 
                    He flew back from China and came 
                    here.

                                  JOHN
                      Sherlock...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Somewhere in this street. Somewhere 
                    close. I don t know where.

                                  JOHN
                          (Points)
                    That shop over there.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    How can you tell?

      JOHN holds up the journalist s diary

                                  JOHN
                    Lukis  diary. He was here. He wrote 
                    down the address.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Oh.

      JOHN rather pleased with himself at having found the answer 
    so easily.

      They cross the street to the shop...



    An old Chinese Emporium - THE LUCKY CAT.

    The golden cat in the window waves at SHERLOCK and JOHN.

      Classical ceramic figures on display. Paper lanterns, Chinese 
      fans and sashes are strung around the door. They go in...



      Outside the shop. Chinatown. The Chinese gate. 

    Row after row of restaurants - the Golden Pagoda, Plum 
      Valley, the Crispy Duck. Market stalls selling vegetables - a 
    man trims bok choy with a machete. 


                                                                              44.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


      A girl working in a Chinese herbalist throws a bucket of 
      water out on to the pavement and starts to sweep.

      JOHN and SHERLOCK peruse the shop windows - the same symbols 
      appear again and again: price tags at the deli; the 
      blackboard outside the grocers...

      Numbers numbers numbers... 

      Everywhere Chinese numbers. All similar to the tag.

      SHERLOCK slaps his head - how did he miss this!?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    It s an ancient number system - 
                    Hang Zhou.These days only street 
                    traders use it. 

    The Chinese grocer also displays the prices in  regular  
      numerals, so JOHN and SHERLOCK can translate on the spot...

      They examine his price tags - find a match.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    They were numbers! Written on the 
                    wall at the bank and at the 
                    library! Numbers in an ancient 
                    Chinese dialect!

                                  JOHN
                    It s a  15 . Look. Just here! What 
                    we thought was the artist s tag - 
                    it s a number  15 .

                                  SHERLOCK
                    And the blindfold. The horizontal 
                    line. It s a number as well. It s 
                    the Chinese number  1 , John! 

                                  JOHN
                    We ve found it.

    The CHINESE GROCER appears from his shop door - angry that 
      they re swapping all the labels from his food. Grabs them 
      back.

    In the melee JOHN glances up - something familiar catches his 
      eye...

      A WOMAN: black sunglasses; black headscarf; black coat. 
      Taking a photograph with her mobile?

      A double-take. But she has gone.

      SHERLOCK and JOHN outside THE LUCKY CAT. SHERLOCK examines 
    the door to the flat above. 

    We have seen the door before. The bell says  SOO LIN YAO .

      A telephone directory on the doorstep, still in its little 
      plastic bag. The bag torn at the corner. 

    The directory is standing on end, leaning against the door... 
    if someone had opened the door it would have moved.


                                                                              47.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


      SHERLOCK rips the bag open - the pages are swollen with rain 
      water.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    That s been on the step since 
                    Monday. 

      SHERLOCK rings. No response.

                                  SHERLOCK
                      Noone sbeen in this flat for at 
                    least three days.

      SHERLOCK darts down the side of the building - a side alley - 
      JOHN scuttling after.

                                  JOHN
                    They re away on holiday. So what?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Do you leave your windows open when 
                    you go away?

      Looks up. The window of the flat is gaping wide. There is 
      scaffolding at the back of the flats.

      SHERLOCK jumps up on a dustbin, hauling himself up on the 
      scaffolding.

      Reaches the windows of the first floor flat. One of them is 
      wide open. He jumps inside.

                                  JOHN
                          (Hisses)
                    Sherlock!



      SHERLOCK lands inside.

    On the window ledge is a vase. He almost knocks it over - 
      just manages to catch it.

      A fastidiously clean little studio flat. Good taste, but no 
      money to indulge it. 

      Everywhere there are feminine touches - dried flowers, 
      embroidered cushions. A Chinese screen.

    But the place is cold - noonehas been here for days. 

      Washing up drained dry on the draining board. One cup, one 
      plate, one bowl, one pair of chopsticks. The washing machine 
      light says  End . SHERLOCK opens it. The washing is damp and 
    it smells. 

    In the corner is a clothes horse hung with laundry - all of 
    it bone dry. The flowers in the vase are sagging. He opens 
    the fridge and sniffs the milk - gone sour.



                                                                              48.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


    The doorbell rings again. JOHN is outside the front again. He 
      shouts through the letterbox.

                                  JOHN (O.S.)
                    You think maybe you could let me in 
                    this time? 

      SHERLOCK ignores JOHN. Goes to the mantelpiece. 

    An old photo of a Chinese baby girl and baby boy hugging each 
      other... There are fingerprints on the glossy surface.

                                  JOHN (O.S.)
                    Oh for heaven s sake. Can you not 
                    keep doing this, please? 

      SHERLOCK turns back to the window. 

      A small puddle of water on the floor beside it.

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (Shouting downstairs)
                    I m not the first.

                                  JOHN
                    What?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Someone else has been here. Someone 
                    broke into this flat. 

      Touches the puddle of water.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    He knocked that vase, just like I 
                    did.

    He starts to hunt around eagerly on the carpet - looking for 
      depressions in the pile. Finds the hazy impressions of shoes.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Size eleven. He was tall. But not 
                    heavy. 

    He follows the footprints to the mantelpiece. Looks back at 
    the photo - the fingerprints on it. The intruder held it.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Long, thin fingers. Our acrobat.

                                  JOHN (O.S.)
                    What are you saying?

      Looks back at the window.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Why didn t he close it when he 
                    left?

                                  SHERLOCK (cont'd)
                          (Slaps his head)
                    Stupid. Stupid.It s obvious! 
                    Because he s still in here.

      Looks at the Chinese screen. The only place the intruder can 
    be.

      SHERLOCK tugs it quickly to one side. Noonethere. Just a 
      pile of cuddly toys.

      But...

      Look behind you, Sherlock! A shadow moving out from behind 
    the clothes horse - the mountain of laundry. 

      Someone slips a piece of the laundry around his neck and 
      pulls hard - drags him to the carpet, strangling him...

      It s ZHIZHU - the spider.

      SHERLOCK tears at the cloth. It bites into his neck. His legs 
      flailing all the time. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      JOHN on the pavement outside the front door.

                                  JOHN
                    Any time you want to include me - 
                    that would be great. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      SHERLOCK is still clutching at his throat...

    He peers through half-closed eyes but ZHI ZHU is just a 
      blurred silhouette.

                                  SHERLOCK
                            (Half-strangled)
                    John... John...

                                                                            CUT TO:
      Pavement.

                                  JOHN
                    I m obviously wasting my breath.

      Shouts through the letterbox - a bad impression of SHERLOCK.

                                  JOHN
                     I m Sherlock, and I always work 
                    alone because no one else can 
                    compete with my massive intellect! 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      SHERLOCK inside, tries to reply - can t speak.


                                                                              50.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


      Tighter and tighter the cord is pulled.

    And then, just as SHERLOCK is about to black out the 
      assailant mysteriously lets go...

    His assailant pushes something into SHERLOCK S top pocket and 
      scurries away through the open window.

      SHERLOCK is too weak to pursue. 

    He glances up to see a shadowy figure leaping through the 
      frame.

    Why didn t he kill him? He coughs - regains his breath...








































                                                                              50A.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


      Reaches in his pocket, finds a tiny black flower made of 
      folded paper. 



      JOHN on the pavement.

    The door opens suddenly. SHERLOCK is very hoarse.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    The milk s out of date. And the 
                    washing - it s started to smell. 
                    Someone left here in a hurry. Three 
                    days ago. 

                                  JOHN
                    Someone?

      SHERLOCK points to the name on the bell.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Soo Lin Yao. We need to find her.

                                  JOHN
                    How exactly?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Start with this.

    He has picked a note up off the doormat.

    It is the note that ANDY GALBRAITH pushed through the door: 
       SOO LIN. PLEASE RING ME, TELL ME YOU RE OK. ANDY. 

      SHERLOCK turns the paper over - an old envelope. It says 
      NATIONAL ANTIQUITIES MUSEUM.

    Off they go - to the museum.

    As an aside -

                                  JOHN
                    You sound croaky.  Are you getting 
                    a cold?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    It s nothing.



      Coming out of the museum...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    We have to get to Soo Lin Yao...

                                  JOHN
                    If she s still alive! That cipher - 
                    it means he s planning to kill her 
                    next.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    That s why I found him in that flat 
                    - he was waiting for her.

      A voice behind.

                                  RAZ
                    Sherlock!

      They turn. RAZ is there - dirty hoody and trainers.




                                                                              52.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


                                  JOHN
                    Well, look who it is...

                                  RAZ
                    I ve found something you ll like.



      SHERLOCK, JOHN and RAZ on the South Bank. Twinkling lights 
      reflect in the Thames.

                                  JOHN
                    Tuesday morning. All you ve got to 
                    do is turn up and say the bag was 
                    yours.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Can we forget about your court 
                    date?



    On the river bank - watching them cross the bridge... 

    THE WOMAN IN BLACK. Just tiny glimpses - details - lips - 
      hands - reflections in her glasses.



      They arrive on the South Bank. Underneath the Hayward 
      gallery. The walls are thick with graffiti - street art from 
      hundreds of different authors.

      SHERLOCK stares at the myriad colours.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    If you wanted to hide a tree then 
                    the best place to do it is a 
                    forest, wouldn t you say? People 
                    would just walk past it, not 
                    knowing - not able to decipher the 
                    message. 

                                  RAZ
                    There.

    Raz points. Someone has painted a huge tag. 

      Underneath... remnants of the yellow zinc paint - just a few 
        tantalisingsplashes left exposed.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    They ve been here. The exact same 
                    paint. John, go up on to the 
                    railway line.

                                  SHERLOCK (cont'd)
                    Look for that same colour.If we re 
                    going to decipher this language 
                    we re going to need more evidence. 

                                  JOHN
                    Where are you gonna g...?

      Turns to RAZ - but the lad has gone again.

                                  JOHN
                    Could have predicted that.

      SHERLOCK skips away. JOHN left alone.



      SHERLOCK on the railway line, running south. He shines his 
      torch about. 

      Lying in the gutter is an empty aerosol can, bright yellow 
      drips around the nozzle. 

      Picks it up. Sniffs the paint.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      JOHN exploring the railway tracks to the north. There are a 
    few homeless people on cardboard beds.

      JOHN picks his way past them in the gloom, trying not to look 
      awkward. 

                                  JOHN
                    Er...  Scuse, can I squeeze past 
                    you?

      A HOMELESS GUY grunts - looks threatening.

                                  HOMELESS GUY
                    This is my place.

                                  JOHN
                    I just want to look at that wall... 
                    Can you move a little bit?

                                  HOMELESS GUY
                    Five pound.

                                  JOHN
                    What?

                                  HOMELESS GUY
                    You want me to move. Five pound.

                                  JOHN
                    OK.



                                                                              54.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


      JOHN digs into his pocket.

                                  HOMELESS GUY
                    Ten.

                                  JOHN
                    What happened to five?

                                  HOMELESS GUY
                    Too quick to say  Yes .

                                                                            CUT TO:

      SHERLOCK continues south. The moon illuminates graffiti - 
      grey in the light.

    He reaches an area that is thick with fly-posters - gigs and 
      club events. 

    POV the wall. SHERLOCK stares hard - one of the posters has 
      caught his eye.

    He tears at the bottom. A small shred of it comes away.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      JOHN uses his phone to illuminate the area. And then he sees 
    it!

      A tiny drip of the yellow paint on the railway line - a thin 
      line, like a trail of bread crumbs. 

      JOHN makes his way along the tracks. The line snakes away 
      into the dark.

    He turns a corner and his eyes light up. Bingo!

      Illuminated only by the dull bulb of a street-lamp... the 
      wall here is thick with ciphers: eighteen of the yellow 
      symbols, grouped in nine pairs.

    He studies them closely - runs his hand over them all - like 
      mystic ancient runes... Chinese numbers.

    He gets out his phone to phone SHERLOCK. No reception in the 
    no man s land of the railway tracks.

                                  JOHN
                    Dammit.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      South. SHERLOCK searching.

    And then he hears a shout. He looks north along the tracks. 
      JOHN is running.




                                                                              55.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


                                  JOHN
                          (Shouts)
                    Sherlock! Sherlock! I found it.



      A blank wall. Painted black.

                                  JOHN (O.S.)
                    I don t understand. It was here.

    The camera pans out. JOHN has brought SHERLOCK back to the 
      place where he found the eighteen symbols.

    Now the wall is blank. Painted over?

                                  JOHN
                    Twenty minutes ago. I saw it. A 
                    whole load of graffiti.

      Reaches out. The wall is wet. Black paint.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Someone didn t want me to see it.

      Grabs JOHN by the head - planting both his hands on his 
      friend s skull.

                                  JOHN
                    Hey - Sherlock! What you doing?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Shush, John. I need you to 
                    concentrate. Shut your eyes!

                                  JOHN
                    What? What for? What you doing?

    He clamps JOHN S arms to his sides - spins round with him, 
      trying to induce a trance-like state.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I need you to maximise your visual 
                    memory. Try to picture it. Picture 
                    what you saw. Can you remember it?

                                  JOHN
                    Sure. Yeah.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    You can remember the pattern?

                                  JOHN
                    Yes, definitely.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    How much can you remember?


                                                                              56.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


                                  JOHN
                    Look, don t worry...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Because the average visual memory 
                    is only sixty-two per cent 
                    accurate.

                                  JOHN
                    Oh, well I remember all of it.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Really?

                                  JOHN
                    At least I will if I can get to my 
                    pockets. I took a photograph.

      SHERLOCK lets go. JOHN pulls his phone out. 

      Shows a picture to SHERLOCK. The new cipher.



    The facade of the museum.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      JOHN and SHERLOCK with ANDY.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Two men died after visiting 
                    China... The killer left them 
                    messages - written in the Hang Zhou 
                    numerals.

                                  JOHN
                    Soo Lin Yao is in danger. That 
                    cipher... it was just the same 
                    pattern as the others. He means to 
                    kill her as well.

                                  ANDY
                    I ve tried everywhere. Her friends; 
                    her colleagues. I don t know where 
                    she s gone. She could be a thousand 
                    miles away.

      SHERLOCK isn t listening. He s staring into the distance.

                                  JOHN
                    What s the matter, Sherlock? What 
                    are you looking at?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Tell me more about those tea pots, 
                    in that case.

    He is staring at the Zisha pots in their glass case.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      ANDY opens the cabinet.

                                  ANDY
                    Those pots were her obsession. They 
                    need urgent work. If they dry out 
                    the clay can start to crumble. 
                    Apparently you have to keep making 
                    tea in them.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Last time we came here - only one 
                    of those pots was shining.

    Two of the tea pots are now gleaming - newly seasoned.



      JOHN and SHERLOCK with SOO LIN - we glimpse them from up 
      above - through the patterned glass roof.

    Is someone watching from up there? 




                                                                              62.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10



      JOHN and SARAH hurry along an East End Street.

                                  SARAH
                    It s years since anyone took me 
                    to the circus.

                                  JOHN
                    A friend recommended it to me. He
                    phoned up.

                                  SARAH
                    Is it a touring company or 
                    something?

                                  JOHN
                    I don t know much about it.

      They turn the corner. SARAH sees the venue.

                                  SARAH
                    I think it s probably from China.

    POV SARAH and JOHN. They have come to a theatre.

    The front facade is decorated in a hundred Chinese 
      lanterns. There is a poster:  The Yellow Dragon Circus . 

    The same poster that SHERLOCK saw - the bottom corner of it 
      matches his tiny scrap.

      JOHN looks entirely suspicious. 



      SHERLOCK runs out on to the street to hail a cab. No luck.

    He collides with two German tourists, their heads buried in 
    an A to Zof London.

    The books falls to the gutter and they rail at him in German.

                    Sorry. Sorry.

    He shoves the book back in their hands. Then stops on the 
      street corner.

      Beat. His mind races.

    He looks across the street. Two Japanese tourists are 
      opposite - one of them has an A to Z tucked in his back 
      pocket.

      Whoosh! SHERLOCK is staring at the books on EDDIE VAN COON S 
      shelf.

      There is a London A to Z nestling beside the phone.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Whoosh! In LUKIS  flat. 

      A London A to Z on the shelf.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Whoosh! Sitting at VAN COON S desk on the trading floor. 

      A London A to Z resting there on the top.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Everyone carries it. No one would 
                    think twice if they saw it. It s... 
                    invisible. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Whoosh! The restoration room at the museum.

    The London A to Z is right beside SOO LIN whilst SHERLOCK and 
      JOHN are talking to her.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      SHERLOCK chases down the German couple. The man has tucked 
    the A to Z in his coat pocket. SHERLOCK yanks it out.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Just a second.

      They rail at him a second time. 



      SHERLOCK on the street, thumbing through the A TO Z.

                                  SHERLOCK
                          (Under his breath)
                    Page fifteen. Entry one. Page 
                    fifteen entry one.

    He reads the A to Z index. Page 15. Entry number 1. 

       Deadman s Lane .

      SHERLOCK stares at it.

       Dead man .

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Whoosh! Staring at the wall in the banker s office with the 
      sprayed graffiti. 

       15  and  1 . The tag and the blind banker.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Whoosh! The library.  15  and  1  sprayed on the spines of 
    the books.

      SHERLOCK on the street.

                                  SHERLOCK
                     Dead man . You werethreatening to 
                    kill them. That s the first cipher.

    He tugs the papers from his pocket - the eighteen symbols 
      from the railway. Gets out a pen - falls to the pavement to 
      write.

    He starts thumbing through the index, translating each pair 
    of numbers - writing them down. 

      Each number pair refers to a street...



                                                                              88.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


       Nine Elms Lane     Mill Hill    Fore Street  

       Jade close     Pin street    

       Dragon Road   Den Close   Black Acre Close  

       Tramway Avenue 

      Focus on SHERLOCK, frowning.

      Focus tight on:

       Jade Pin .

    And then on:

       Tramway .



      Holborn.The street leading down to the old tram tunnel. 
      Flashing blue lights. 

    An ambulance has come to take the corpses. Uniformed POLICE 
      OFFICERS cordon off the area.

      SARAH is lead away with a blanket over her shoulders - 
      shocked but not hurt.

      SHERLOCK and JOHN are side by side as they emerge from the 
      tunnel. DIDIMMOCK is waiting. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    We ll just slip off. No need to 
                    mention us in the report.

                                  DIMMOCK
                    Mr. Holmes...

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I have high hopes for you, 
                    Inspector. A glittering career.

                                  DIMMOCK
                    I go where you point me.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Exactly.

    And they go. More and more police are arriving all the while.



      JOHN and SHERLOCK in the city - headed for SHADS bank.



                                                                              98.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10


                                  SHERLOCK
                    Two operatives - based in London. 
                    They travelled over to Dalian to 
                    smuggle those vases. And then one 
                    of them helped himself to 
                    something. A little hairpin. 

                                  JOHN
                          (Incredulous)
                    Worth nine million pounds, 
                      apparently.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Eddie Van Coon was the thief. He 
                    stole the treasure when he was over 
                    in China.

                                  JOHN
                    How d you know it was Van Coon not 
                    Lukis? Even the killer didn t know 
                    that.

      Reaches the doors of the bank.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    Because of the soap.

    He spins the revolving door and leaves JOHN on the pavement, 
      baffled.



      SHERLOCK and JOHN having breakfast. Reading the papers - the 
      jade hairpin is the headline.

                                  JOHN
                    Over a thousand years old. And it s 
                    sitting on her bedside table every 
                    night.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    He didn t know it s value; didn t 
                    know why they were chasing him. 

                                  JOHN
                    Should have just bought her a lucky 
                    cat.

      SHERLOCK silent - almost sad.

                                  JOHN
                    You mind, don t you?

                                  SHERLOCK
                    What?

                                  JOHN
                    She escaped. General Shan. Not 
                    enough that we got her two 
                    henchmen.

                                  SHERLOCK
                    It must be a vast network, John. 
                    Thousands of operatives. You and 
                    I - we barely scratched the 
                    surface.

                                  JOHN
                    You cracked the code though, 
                    Sherlock. 
                                  (MORE)

                                                                              103.       THE BLIND BANKER SHOOTING (DRAFT 8) GREEN  16-02-10

                                  JOHN (cont'd)
                    Maybe Dimmock can track them all 
                    down. Now that he knows it. 

                                  SHERLOCK
                    I cracked the code, yes. All the 
                    smugglers have to do is to pick 
                    up another book.

      JOHN glances through the window - across the street. A 
      young oriental teenager is spraying graffiti on a wall.
