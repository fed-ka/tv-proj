      Cathy  (prettier than she realizes, tendency to apologize for 
    no reason, dry sense of humor) stands in her modest back yard 
      with BRADLEY, a burly, early 40 scontractor.  

                                  BRADLEY
                    You want me to put a pool in this 
                    yard?

                                  CATHY
                    Yes.  Please.  Yes, please.

                                  BRADLEY
                          (laughing)
                    Unless you want to tear that fence 
                    down and ask your neighbors to go 
                    in halvsieswith ya, I don t think 
                    it s going to fit.

                                  CATHY
                    I know it s small but--

                                  BRADLEY
                     Cause once you get your patio 
                    around it--

                                  CATHY
                    I was thinking--

                                  BRADLEY
                    And that s a nice shade tree over 
                    there so you ll wanna leave that.  

                                  CATHY
                    I don t care about--

                                  BRADLEY
                    By then you ll have to make it so 
                    narrow that you wouldn t want to go 
                    any deeper than three feet and 
                    Hell, if you want to get wet that 
                    bad, I d tell you to save your 
                    money and take a bath.

      Beat.

                                  CATHY
                          (disappointed)
                    I m sorry I wasted your time.  I 
                    guess--                                                                                      2


                                  BRADLEY
                    What you oughtta do is let us bump 
                    out your deck here, put in a sunken 
                    hot tub and a little bbq pit over 
                    here, and I think that d be nice.  
                    An outdoor living room if you will.

                                  CATHY
                          (hesitant)
                    Okay, that s fine.  Just do that.
                    How fast could you finish it?

                                  BRADLEY
                    Well, it s the first day of summer, 
                    our busy season--

                                  CATHY
                    I ll pay extra.

                                  BRADLEY
                    I still got three jobs ahead of you-

                                  CATHY
                    I ll pay double.

                                  BRADLEY
                    I ll have a crew out here in the 
                    morning.

                                  CATHY
                    Sounds perfect. 

      They shake hands.

                                  CATHY (CONT'D)
                    Happy first day of summer.  

                                  BRADLEY
                    And to you.

      Bradley heads up the driveway and gets into his truck with a 
       COOL POOLS  sign on the side of it.  As he pulls away, 
      CATHY S HUSBAND PAUL(kid at heart, irresponsible but 
      lovable) rides up on his Vespa.

                                  PAUL
                    Is that your new lover?  Is that 
                    why I m sleeping on my sister s 
                    couch? (singing)  Everybody s 
                    Cooler with a Pool!  Be cool with 
                    Cool pools!  Is the Cool Pool s guy 
                    filling your pool, Cathy?                                                                                       3


                                  CATHY
                    I m going to bump out the deck and 
                    put in a hot tub.

                                  PAUL
                    I thought you wanted a new 
                      backsplashfor the kitchen.  I 
                    don t know who you are anymore.  

                                  CATHY
                    Shouldn t you be at work already?  

                                  PAUL
                    I came by to get the heating pad 
                    you use for your cramps.

    He turns his back and puts his hand on his shoulder.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    Feel this.

    She does.

                                  CATHY
                    That s a big knot.  

                                  PAUL
                    Lisa s couch is giving me adult 
                    onset scoliosis.  I m going to have 
                    to start making my own shirts with 
                    an extra sleeve in the back.  Could 
                    you just rub it for one second?

    She does.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    Oh yeah.  Really get in there.  

      He s hunched over, leaning into the rub.

                                  PAUL (CONT D)
                    Oh, I miss this.  I miss you. 
                    You ve gotta tell me what s going 
                    on so we can fix this, Cathy.  

    She stops rubbing.

                                  CATHY
                    I m sorry.  I have to go, Paul.  I 
                    have an appointment with the 
                      dermatologist.                                                                                      4


                                  PAUL
                    Can we have dinner tonight?  So we 
                    can discuss the fate of our 
                    marriage or at the very least 
                    decide what we re going to tell 
                    Adam tomorrow?  Because right now 
                    my story is--Adam, your mom s a 
                    meanie.

                                  CATHY
                    Okay.  Dinner.

                                  PAUL
                    Good.  Where s the heating--

                                  CATHY
                    In the linen closet.

                                  PAUL
                    Which one s the linen--

                                  CATHY
                    In the hallway.

                                  PAUL
                    I love you.

    He heads into the house.  Cathy notices her ELDERLY NEIGHBOR 
      SITTING ON THE PORCH OF HER RUN DOWN HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET. 
    She has a faraway look and a scowl on her face.  Grass is 
      growing up around her TIRED OLD BASSET HOUNDwho lays in the 
      yard.  Cathy smiles and waves at the old woman.

                                  CATHY
                    Happy first day of summer!

    The old woman gets up and goes inside.  

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                          (to herself)  Okay, then.


      SEAN, (LATE 20 S, POSSIBLY HOMELESS, ATTRACTIVE IN THAT 
      HEROINE CHIC WAY, SKINNY, LONG HAIR) is jumping rope in front 
    of the store.  His rope is made of plastic shopping bags tied 
      together, a stone tied to the middle of it for weight.  He s 
      proselytizing to shoppers as they exit with groceries.

                                  SEAN
                    It takes one plastic bag two 
                    hundred years to disintegrate in a 
                    land fill!  When you carry your 
                    eggs home in a plastic bag you 
                    might as well put it over your 
                    child s head and suffocate them 
                    with it because you re destroying 
                    their future!

      Cathy pulls up in front of him and lowers her window.

                                  CATHY
                    Did you go to business school to 
                    learn to appeal to people like 
                    that? 

                                  SEAN
                    No, I went to Shut the Fuck Up 
                    Technical Institute.

                                  CATHY
                    I bet you were first in your class. 

                                  SEAN
                    No, but I slept with her.

                                  CATHY
                    Lovely.  Get in the car.                                                                                      9


                                  SEAN
                    Come back and pick me up on a bike.

                                  CATHY
                    I have something to tell you.

                                  SEAN
                    Go tell it on a mountain.

                                  CATHY
                    Get in the damn car, Sean.  

      Beat.  Sean reluctantly rolls up his jump rope like a garden 
      hose and gets in.

                                  SEAN
                    You could at least buy a hybrid.

                                  CATHY
                    You could at least take a shower.

      Cathy holds her breath and leans out the window as they drive 
      off.


      Cathy puts her key in the front door.


      Construction workers are building the deck.  Cathy approaches 
      Bradley who is talking on his cell phone.

                                  CATHY
                    I want a pool.  Not a hot tub--a
                    pool. 

                                  BRADLEY
                          (into phone)
                    Let me call you back, Brian.  

    He hangs up the phone.

                                  BRADLEY (CONT D)
                    (to Cathy)  What do you want?                                                                                    19


                                  CATHY
                    I want you to dig a hole as deep 
                    and wide as you possibly can.  
                    Everywhere there s yard now there 
                    should be pool.  Dig up the shade 
                    tree.  Rip off the deck.  And dig 
                    right up to the house so I can dive 
                    into my pool from the porch.  I ll 
                    pay you overtime to work through 
                    the night.  If you don t want the 
                    job, I ll find somebody else to do 
                    it.  No skin off my nose.  I have 
                    no loyalty to you.  We just met.

      Bradley chuckles at this.

                                  BRADLEY
                    Hey, lady, if that s what you want.  
                    I ll get a digger out here this 
                    afternoon.

                                  CATHY
                    Great.  Get your digger out here.  
                    The bigger your digger the better.  

    She heads back to her house.  


    As she does, she notices the old woman across the street 
      sitting on her porch.  The Basset is asleep in the yard.

                                  CATHY
                    I m Cathy.  It s weird that I ve 
                    lived across the street from you 
                    for over a year and I never got 
                    your name.  I apologize for that.  
                    (re: dog)  You know, there s a dog 
                    park pretty close to here.  I don t 
                    know if your dog likes other dogs 
                    or not.  Or parks.  But I could get 
                    my son to--

    The old woman gets up and goes inside. 

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    (sotto; to herself)  Well, guess 
                    who is not going to swim in my 
                    pool.                                                                                    20



      Sean is chained to a WATER DELIVERY TRUCK parked on this 
      residential street.                                                                                      23


                                  SEAN
                    Poison delivery!  Poison delivery!  
                    Sign up for your poison delivery!

    A couple walks by and eyes him suspiciously. 


      Cathy drives up beside Sean and lowers her window.  

                                  CATHY
                    I have something for you.

                                  SEAN
                    I want for nothing.  The air is my 
                    food, the sun is my roof.

    She pushes a sleeping bag through the window.  It lands at 
    his feet.

                                  CATHY
                    I get it.  You don t want to take 
                    up any space or resources on the 
                    planet.  But I figured you could 
                    still get a good nights sleep. A 
                    hundred per cent organic.  I know 
                    you re impressed. 

    He points to the tags with his foot.

                                  SEAN
                    What s that?

                                  CATHY
                    Oh, it s just the tags.  Tells you 
                    about it s features and how to 
                    clean it.  

                                  SEAN
                    Oh, my God, you bought it new?  

      Beat. Cathy blanches.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    We are being suffocated by stuff in 
                    this country.  So much so that 
                    there s a bill in Congress right 
                    now to send rockets full of our 
                    crap into space--ha!Space--ironic, 
                    isn t it. 

                                  CATHY
                    I thought--                                                                                    24


                                  SEAN
                    You just don t get it.

    The TRUCK DRIVERcomes out and approaches Sean.

                                  TRUCK DRIVER
                    You gotta get off my truck, man.  I 
                    gotta move.

                                  SEAN
                    I thought I d go with you on your 
                    poison delivery today.  Go ahead if 
                    you must.  I ll run along behind. 
                    (shouting)  Poison delivery!

      Cathy shakes her head and drives away.


    A bull dozer digs a hole in the back yard, tearing up the 
      landscaping.


      A COP CARwith lights spinning sits in the driveway.  The 
      workers have stopped working.  Cathy comes hurriedly into the 
      backyard and approaches a police officer.

                                  CATHY
                    What s the problem?

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    This your house?

                                  CATHY
                          (sarcastic)
                    No, I live in the next town over, I 
                    just take walks around here in my 
                    robe.

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    Well, tie your belt  cause your 
                    boob s hanging out.

      He s right.  She wraps her robe tighter and ties her belt.

                                  POLICE OFFICER (CONT D)
                    You don t have permits for this 
                    job.

                                  CATHY
                    So?  I m not bothering anybody. 

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                    One of your neighbors complained.

                                  CATHY
                    Which one?                                                                                    27



      Cathy rushes up to the front door, and without knocking, 
      walks right in.


    As she heads back to her house, Paul is pulling up on his 
      Vespa.  She inadvertently cuts him off.  He swerves to miss 
    her and topples over.  

                                  PAUL
                    Sorry I m late. 

    He picks himself up and pulls up his pant leg to reveal a 
      scraped knee..

                    I could sure use a band aid and a 
                    lollipop.

    Off Cathy s blank stare we CUT TO:


      Cathy has three pieces of cake in front of her.   Dr. Todd 
      picks at an omelet.  

                                  DR. TODD
                    So who have you told so far?

                                  CATHY
                    You re like a dog with a bone about 
                    that.  

                                  DR. TODD
                    Eventually you ll have to tell 
                    them.

                                  CATHY
                    Maybe not.  Maybe I ll just leave a 
                    Post It on my front door that says--
                    heardMorocco was great this time 
                    of year.  

                                  DR. TODD
                    Morocco s so random.

                                  CATHY
                    Maybe you should tell them for me.  
                    After all, you have more practice  
                    with giving this sort of news.  
                    Does it get easier?  Do you kind of 
                    like it?  Does it give you a bit of 
                    a God complex?

                                  DR. TODD
                    You re my first.                                                                                    31


      Beat.

                                  CATHY
                    Really?

                                  DR. TODD
                    I mean...I ve been in on other 
                    diagnoses, with other doctors when 
                    I was in training--  

                                  CATHY
                    How old are you?

                                  DR. TODD
                      Thirty-one.

                                  CATHY
                          (teasing)
                    Holy Shit. (sarcastic)  Shows you 
                    how good my insurance is.  I got 
                    the new guy.  What if I m healthy 
                    as a horse and you just got caught 
                    up in youthful exuberance?

                                  DR. TODD
                    That s what second opinions are 
                    for.

                                  CATHY
                    So, as your first, how was I?

                                  DR. TODD
                    The first thing you said was,  It s 
                    okay.   Like you were more worried 
                    about me.

                                  CATHY
                    That s a bad habit of mine.  It 
                    takes twenty eight days to break a 
                    habit, right?  I have that.

                                  DR. TODD
                    So how was I?

                                  CATHY
                          (thinking)
                    Very matter of fact and 
                    professional but detailed.  You 
                    dumbed it down just enough to be 
                    clear but not insulting.  And 
                    underneath it all you seemed sad, 
                    and I appreciated that.

                                  CATHY (CONT'D)
                    But after you left the room I heard 
                    you joking with a nurse about 
                    putting the donuts too close to the 
                    urine samples and was that what you 
                    were supposed to wash them down 
                    with.

                                  DR. TODD
                          (horrified)
                    You heard that?

                                  CATHY
                    Made me question your sincerity.  

                                  DR. TODD
                    Well, I can t just fall apart in 
                    the hallway at work.  

                                  CATHY
                    Couldn t you though?  I would have 
                      appreciated a little screaming to 
                    the heavens on my behalf.  

                                  DR. TODD
                    They discourage that in medschool.

                                  CATHY
                    You asked my opinion.

                                  DR. TODD
                    I did.  And...thin walls.  I ll 
                    remember that.

                                  CATHY
                    You ll remember more than that.  

                                  DR. TODD
                    I will?

                                  CATHY
                    Of course.  Because you always 
                    remember your first.

      They share a smile.  The WAITER approaches.

                                  WAITER
                    How are you all doing?

                                  CATHY
                    I don t know about him but I m 
                    almost finished.

    The WAITER nods and exits.  Cathy winks at Dr. Todd.                                                                                    33


                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    That was a double entendre. 


      Cathy steps outside, leans up against the wall of this 
      secluded area of the school and starts to light one of her 
    pot cigarettes.  As she does, she sees Andrea come out of 
      another door and take something out of her purse.

                                  CATHY
                    Andrea?

      Andrea turns, startled, and hides something behind her back.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Are you skipping my class?

                                  ANDREA
                    Are youskipping your class?

      Cathy approaches her.

                                  CATHY
                    What are you-- Are you smoking? 

                                  ANDREA
                    Are you?

      Cathy grabs her arm and wrestles a cigarette pack from 
      Andrea s hand and crushes it. 

                                  CATHY
                          (re: cigarettes)
                    Think of every one of these you 
                    smoke as taking six months off your 
                    life.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    34

                                  CATHY (CONT'D)
                    So with every one of these you can 
                    say goodbye to your mom, your 
                    brother, your dog, your husband you 
                    might have someday, your--

                                  ANDREA
                    I d rather die young and skinny 
                    than be fat forever.

      This stops Cathy s rant.

                                  ANDREA (CONT D)
                    What can I say?  Fat camp didn t 
                    work.  

                                  CATHY
                    Yeah, well, there s gotta be--

                                  ANDREA
                    The protein diet, the blood sugar 
                    diet, the starvation diet, the 
                    pretending I don t care strategy.  
                    You d be mean, too.  

                                  CATHY
                            (stammering)
                    Well...you just...you need 
                      motivation.

                                  ANDREA
                    Oh, thanks.  I m healed.  I should 
                    have come to you sooner Mrs. 
                    Jamison.

      Beat.

                                  CATHY
                    I ll pay you a hundred dollars for 
                    every pound you lose.

      Andrea is stunned.  Cathy takes a roll of bills out of her 
      pocket.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Here s a good faith hundred.  We 
                    meet in the gym every Friday at two 
                    for weigh ins.  If you smell like a 
                    cigarette the deal s off.

                                  ANDREA
                          (elated)
                    This skinny bitch llsee you

    She exits.  Cathy uncrumplesthe pack and lights a broken 
      cigarette.



    As Cathy gets out of her car, she sees Marlene waiting for 
      her.

                                  OLD WOMAN
                    My name s Marlene.  My dog s name 
                    is Thomas.  He doesn t like 
                    walking, but thanks for your offer.

                                  CATHY
                    It s nice to meet you, Marlene.  

                                  MARLENE
                    Could I borrow your lawn mower?  
                    Mine s dead.  Add it to the list.

                                  CATHY
                    Sure.  It s in the garage.

      Cathy motions to the garage and Marlene heads in.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    Marlene.

      Marlene turns.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    If you were ready to go, did you 
                    ever think about--justgoing?

                                  MARLENE
                    Why?  Does a friend of yours want 
                    to buy my house?

      Cathy shakes her head.  Marlene goes into the garage.  Cathy 
      looks at THOMAS lying in Marlene s yard.

                                  CATHY
                    (to Basset)  Don t look so 
                    miserable.  Nobody else s day is 
                    any better than yours.


      Adam looks at the Post It that reads--ILOVE YOU.  He pulls 
    it off and enters.


      Sean is standing silently in front of the store, holding a 
      rope made crudely from plastic bags around his neck like a 
      noose.  Cathy pulls up and lowers her window.  

                                  CATHY
                    I brought you some chili.

                                  SEAN
                    I want for nothing.

                                  CATHY
                    It s leftovers.  I was going to 
                    throw it away. 

      Sean lets the noose dangle around his neck and takes the bowl 
    and spoon from her.

                                  CATHY (CONT D)
                    It has onions in it.

                                  SEAN
                    Yum.

      Cathy leans on the open window and watches him eat.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    Take a picture it lasts longer.

    She takes theIPHONEout of her purse and takes his picture.

                                  SEAN (CONT D)
                    Are you wearing a robe?

    She stares at the picture she just took.                                                                                    39


                                  CATHY
                    I ve never noticed what a handsome 
                    guy you are.  No wonder my friend 
                    Holly had such a crush on you in 
                    high school.  She d come over to 
                    hang out and I d catch her in your 
                    room staring at your clothes.

                                  SEAN
                    You never told me that.

                                  CATHY
                    It grossed me out to think of you 
                    with my best friend so I told her 
                    you were gay.

                                  SEAN
                    Oh well.  I guess she thinks she 
                    lost her virginity to a gay guy 
                    then.

                                  CATHY
                    No way!

                                  SEAN
                    Way!

      Cathy starts to leave.

                                  CATHY
                    Oh, I m burning my couch in the 
                    back yard on Friday if you want to 
                    come over for a bonfire.

      Beat.  Sean smiles.

                                  SEAN
                    You re starting to get your weird 
                    back, Sis.

                                  CATHY
                    You have no idea.

    She smiles back and drives away.  She turns up the radio and 
      sings loudly to DELTA DAWN as we FADE OUT.  


      Cathy sits on a couch, emotional, sharing her secret.

                                  CATHY
                    ...and they could do chemobut I 
                    have the rare kind that comes back 
                    a hundred per cent of the time.  
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    40

                                  CATHY (CONT'D)
                    Which is weird, because I never win 
                    anything. So I d just be buying a 
                    little more time and it would mean 
                    a lot of people...taking care of 
                    me.  And that s not my thing.   
                    Plus, you know, quality of life.  I 
                    had a sinus infection once and 
                      thought--I drather be dead.  
                    Seriously.  You know what makes me 
                    feel better though?  If I m being 
                    honest? It makes me feel better to 
                    think that we re all dying.  And 
                    when you have a kid, you expect 
                    that you ll die before they do even 
                    if you try not to think about it.  
                    I mean, you hope to God you will 
                    because the opposite is 
                      inconceivable.  So if I think about 
                    it that way--hey, I m living the 
                    dream! (shelaughs at herself)  
                    Come on, that s pretty funny.  
                    Gotta give it up for me a little 
                    bit.  Death comedy.  I m here all 
                    year.  Performing at Stage Four.  
                    I m just warning you that this 
                    laughter might turn into a sob in a 
                    minute.   (itdoes)  Yep, there it 
                    is.  As long as I m being raw and 
                    vulnerable here, I might as well 
                    tell you that I m feeling very much 
                    in love with you right now.  It 
                    could just be gratitude.  Who 
                    knows.  Who cares.  

      REVEALthat she s actually pouring out her heart to THOMAS
    who sits next her on the couch which sits in the pool hole.  
    He stares at her with compassionate Basset eyes.  

    As Cathy alternates between laughter and sobs WE PULL UP AND 
      AWAY and the woman and dog get smaller and smaller until they 
      disappear and all we can see is the hole and then nothing at 
    all and WE FADE OUT.

    THE END
