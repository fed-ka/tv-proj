The Shephard/Robin Company
5300 Melrose Ave. #225E
Los Angeles, CA 90038
(323) 871-4413      INT. SHOWER - MORNING 

      A MAN stands in his shower. Lets the water wash over his worn 
      face. South of 50 years old, north of 40, you can still see a 
      hint of the rugged good looks of his youth. This is WALT 
      LONGMIRE. He doesn t move, wishing he was still in bed. 

      A bar of soap sits on an exposed wooden cross beam, green 
      drywall board along the bottom. You can actually see through 
      the studs of one side of the shower and into the bedroom. 
      This shower is under repair, like the man inside -- his worn 
      leather torso shaped by plenty of hard work and scarred by a 
      few run-ins over the years.

      Close on the SCARS: A bullet wound marks his lower left 
      abdomen and lines up with the exit wound on his lower back. A 
      long, narrow scar shows where another bullet grazed his right 
      shoulder. His rib cage has been on the receiving end of 
      something sharp and jagged. Maybe a broken bottle.

      The PHONE RINGS. A loud, classic, old Ma Bell ring...Walt 
      moves his head out of the rushing water just enough so one 
      ear is in the clear to hear the machine pick up.

                                  CHEERY WOMAN S VOICE (ON MACHINE)
                    You ve reached the Longmire 
                      residence...

      INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      As we hear the message, we see the residence: A SMALL, 
      CLUTTERED, ONE-STORY CONTEMPORARY LOG HOME. A rehab is 
      underway. Or abandoned. Hard to tell. WIRES stick out of 
      HOLES in the drywall. PAPERS. STACKS OF BOOKS. A TUBE TV. A 
      SOFA draped with a WORN INDIAN QUILT. DIRTY PLATES and EMPTY 
      RAINIER BEER CANS dot the coffee table nearby. 

                                  CHEERY WOMAN S VOICE
                    Sorry, we re not here to take your 
                    call. But please leave a message. 
                    We'll be happy to call you back.

      BEEP! Then a different, irritated female voice: 

                                  VIC'S VOICE
                    Walt. It s Vic...Pickup, pick up, 
                    pick up...Alright. So Billy and Bob 
                    Barnes called...

      INT. SHOWER - CONTINUOUS

                                  VIC S VOICE
                    Said to send someone out to 
                    Pronghorn Ridge. 
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      2.

                                  VIC S VOICE (CONT'D)
                    Branch said he s busy, and it s my 
                    day off. I really don t want to go. 
                    Walt? Damn it. 

      Vic clicks off. Walt lets the water run over him...

      INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

      We hear the BEEP of the answering machine. Another message.

                                  VIC S VOICE
                    Walt. It s Vic. Again. I tried your 
                    radio too. Is there something I 
                    should know? Did you retire and 
                    move to Boca in the middle of the 
                    night without telling anyone? 
                    Alright. I m calling you on my day 
                    off as I m driving to Pronghorn 
                    Ridge--

      We hear BOOTS CLUNK along the hardwood floors as Walt moves 
      to the kitchen. He s dressed now: faded 501 s, dusty round-
      toed ranch boots, and a clean work shirt.

                                  VIC S VOICE (CONT D)
                    I don t want to deal with these 
                    wingnuts so I expect you to get 
                    your ass out there and meet me, 
                      now...please.

      INT. KITCHEN - LATER

      A TEAPOT WHISTLES. Walt pulls the boiling pot off the propane 
      range. The whistle fades and is replaced by the ringing 
      phone. The cheery outgoing message plays as Walt reaches up 
      to a shelf that holds a LARGE WOODEN BOX OF TEA and a BAG OF 
      GROUND COFFEE. He looks at the tea box for a beat, but grabs 
      the coffee. He scoops some into a FRENCH PRESS, then pours in 
      the boiling water. 

      Just as Walt finishes pouring, he freezes. The hair on the 
      back of his neck stands up. He stares out his kitchen window. 
      An OWL sits on a fence post, its yellow eyes staring back. 
      Walt is transfixed. Until...BEEP! 

                                  VIC S VOICE
                    Walt. It s Vic. We got a dead body.

      Walt looks toward the answering machine. Shit. Then back 
      toward the owl. But the owl is gone. Walt sighs, then pushes 
      down the plunger on the French Press.                                                                                      3.


      INT./EXT. WALT S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

      Walt opens his front door and exits. Now we see where Walt 
      lives: no neighbors, no homes within sight, just A GORGEOUS 
      VIEW OF A COLD BLUE WYOMING SKY AND THE BIG HORN MOUNTAINS ON 
      THE DISTANT HORIZON.

      He pulls on his worn leather coat with sheepskin collar. We 
      note the SHERIFF STAR pinned to the front left pocket. He 
      plunks his hat on his head, grabs his gun then jumps down 
      from his front door. A two foot jump that will one day be 
      unnecessary when Walt puts a front porch on his home.

      As Walt walks toward his  96 FORD BRONCO, we cut to:

      EXT. ABSAROKA COUNTY PASTURE - DAY

      ELK sun themselves and pay no attention to the speeding FORD 
      BRONCO that cuts across the horizon in the b.g.

      TITLE FILLS THE FRAME: LONGMIRE

      EXT. PRONGHORN RIDGE TRAILHEAD - DAY

      The Bronco arrives. Walt s boot hits ground that s covered in 
      a couple inches of dry, fluffy snow.  VIC  (aka VICTORIA 
      MORETTI) gets out of her Sheriff s department Jeep. 30, 
      beautiful, with Southern Italian blood coursing through her 
      veins. A pleasant enough sight to coax an involuntary smile 
      out of anyone. Even Walt as he approaches.

                                  WALT
                    Sorry I kept you waiting, Vic.

                                  VIC
                    No, you re not.

                                  WALT
                      So...where are the Barnes boys?

      Vic points at a group of SUVs and pickups parked near a 
      trailhead. One of the pickups has a beat-up camper shell 
      attached to it. 

                                  VIC
                    I was sick of the old one hitting 
                    on me, so I sent them back to their 
                    truck.
                          (points to the hillside)
                    Body s waaaay up there. About 200 
                    yards.                                                                                      4.


      Walt squints. Vic hands him her binoculars. Walt takes them, 
      looks, and...sees...A WHITE FLUFFY LUMP on the ground.  Sheep 
      stand around nearby. RAVENS attempt to scavenge. 

                                  WALT
                    That s a sheep.

                                  VIC
                    I said we had a dead body. I never 
                    said what species.

      Walt shuts his eyes, fighting back a headache, or maybe just 
      irritation. He begins to walk toward the camper shell...

                                  VIC (CONT D)
                    So...now you re here, and you ve 
                    got it under control, guess I ll go 
                    back home, enjoy my day off...?

      Walt turns and looks at her. 

                                  WALT
                    And miss all the fun?

      Off Vic, sighing. She s not getting off that easy.

                                                                          TIME CUT:

      BILLY BARNES (21 going on 45) and BOB BARNES (50 going on 70) 
      are drunk, but they re functioning alcoholics, so they re 
      able to communicate. To a degree.

                                  BOB BARNES
                    We camped out last night so we 
                    could get huntin  first thing this 
                    morning. But when we woke up, we 
                    saw all those damned ravens. We 
                    checked it out and saw that 
                    somebody shot a sheep.

                                  WALT
                    There aren t any footprints heading 
                    up there. How d you get close 
                    enough to know the sheep had been 
                    shot?

                                  BILLY
                    My scope.

      Billy proudly holds up A HUNTING RIFLE with a fancy SCOPE on 
      it. Walt takes the rifle and looks through the scope. 

      SCOPE POV: A dead sheep with ravens picking at it.                                                                                      5.


                                  BOB BARNES
                    Normally we d ignore a dead sheep, 
                    but I know how it looked...a couple 
                    of guys with a couple of drinks in 
                     em and a new night-vision rifle 
                    scope taking target practice. I 
                    swear that ain t what happened.

      Off Walt, wondering if he believes them...

      EXT. HILLSIDE - LATER

      Walt and Vic crunch through the snow, up the snowy path 
      toward the dead sheep. Walt notes Vic s irritation. 

                                  WALT
                    What do you think it s like in Boca 
                    right now? Sunny. Breezy. 85 
                    degrees. Flip flop weather.

                                  VIC
                    This sucks. Look. I know I ve only 
                    been here 6 months, Walt, but I m 
                    not exactly a rookie.

                                  WALT
                    You ve made that clear. Just about 
                    every day for 6 months.

                                  VIC
                    I m just saying, I was working 
                    homicide in Philadelphia for 5 
                    years. I think I m past hazing. And 
                    a dead sheep is a waste of my 
                    talent and my time. 

                                  WALT
                    Last thing I want to do is waste 
                    your valuable time. So...
                          (re: the grazing sheep)
                    Why don t you start questioning all 
                    the witnesses.

      Walt continues up the hill, smiling to himself. 

      ANGLE ON: THE SHEEP CORPSE. Ravens scatter. Vic and Walt look 
      at it. Vic talks. Walt listens. 

                                  VIC 
                    One shot in the side. Dead center. 
                    Awfully precise...Then again, if I 
                    had a fancy military scope like 
                    drunk and drunker down there...
                                  (MORE)                                                                                      6.

                                  VIC  (CONT'D)
                          (pulls out a map)
                    Okay. So. Where the hell are we?

                                  WALT
                          (points)
                      Reservation s about a half mile 
                    north, and this is still part of 
                    the Lazy J Ranch. And these look 
                    like their sheep.

                                  VIC
                          (looks at the dead sheep)
                    What kind of messed up person 
                    shoots a sheep? I mean, they re not 
                    as cute and fluffy as they re made 
                    out to be, but still, they re nice 
                      enough...And it s not like there s 
                    any sport in it, right?...

      Walt is fixated on a nearby ridge -- staring at some ravens 
      circling in the air.

                                  VIC (CONT D)
                      Walt...Hello? Whattaya doing?

                                  WALT
                      Thinking...I do that sometimes 
                    before I talk.

      He walks up toward the ridge. Vic moves to follow him. 

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    You know what they call a flock of 
                    ravens?

                                  VIC
                    Um, no.

                                  WALT
                    An  unkindness.  An  unkindness of 
                    ravens.  

                                  VIC
                    What the hell s wrong with  flock ?

      Walt points ahead to another collection of ravens that seem 
      to be fixated on something other than the dead sheep.

                                  WALT
                       Unkindness  is just a little more 
                    apropos.                                                                                      7.


      And as they come around a large clump of snow-covered 
      sagebrush, they see a very active unkindness: A BODY. HUMAN. 
      MALE. COVERED IN SNOW, SHEEP SHIT AND RAVENS.

      Walt shoos the ravens away, looks at the body. White snow 
      over a dead man s face. Creepy like a war photo. The dead 
      man s jacket is torn and chewed up a bit, his jeans too. And, 
      there, in his cold, dead right hand, a shotgun.

                                  VIC
                    That a 12 gauge, Mossburg? 
                          (Walt nods)
                    Hunting accident? 

                                  WALT
                    Nah. Look at his clothes. More 
                    Apres ski than avid hunter.

                                  VIC
                          (kneels)
                    Looks dry underneath. He must ve 
                    gone down before it started 
                    snowing. I ll check with the 
                    weather service. See when that was.

      Vic pushes the body over a bit to peek, sees: a TUFT OF 
      FEATHERS poking out the front of the down vest. 

                                  VIC (CONT D)
                    Exit wound s obviously here. Which 
                    means he was shot in the back. 
                    Where do you think the shooter was?
                          (looks around)
                    I mean, he could ve been anywhere. 
                    High ground, low ground, behind a 
                    tree...

      Walt finally bends down, smells the barrel of the shotgun.

                                  WALT
                    Victim never shot back.

                                  VIC
                    Sometimes you are so full of shit. 
                    What are you? Cheyenne?

                                  WALT
                    If you smell oil, the gun s been 
                    cleaned. You smell gunpowder, it s 
                    been fired. I smell oil.

      Walt s gloved hand brushes snow off the man s face. He looks 
      at it, furrows his brow. Vic can see his wheels turning.                                                                                       8.


                                  VIC
                    What s wrong?

                                  WALT
                    When you been doing this as long as 
                    I have, you get to a point where 
                    you recognize about every face in 
                    Absaroka county.

                                  VIC
                    So who is it?

                                  WALT
                    That s the thing. I don t know.

      EXT. PRONGHORN RIDGE PARKING AREA - LATER

      The back door of Walt s Bronco is open. Walt and Vic, out of 
      breath, struggle to slide a cumbersome black body bag in. On 
      top of it rests a plastic bag with the dead man s wallet. 

                                  VIC
                    You gonna make Branch lead on this?

      Walt picks up the plastic bag. Along with the wallet, there 
      are a couple of loose items: the victim s WYOMING DRIVER S 
      LICENSE, and a wallet-sized WEDDING PHOTO of the victim with 
      A WOMAN. Walt looks at the photo.

                                  WALT
                    Nah. As long as I came all the way 
                    out here, I may as well run this 
                    one for a bit. See where it goes. 

                                  VIC
                          (surprised)
                    Oh. Then I suppose you want me to 
                    stay here all alone to secure and 
                    process the crime scene that is 
                      completely covered in snow.

                                  WALT
                    You won t be alone. I ll send The 
                    Ferg out to give you a hand.

                                  VIC
                    It s my day off.

      Walt climbs into his Bronco and starts it up. Vic knocks on 
      the window. He rolls it down.

                                  VIC (CONT D)
                    I want a raise.                                                                                      9.


      He hands her his thermos. 

                                  WALT
                    How  bout some coffee. I made it 
                    fresh this morning.

      Vic takes it. Walt smiles, then drives away.

      EXT. DURANT, WYOMING - DAY

      Just enough of a main street to accommodate the small, spread 
      out population of Absaroka county. One  nice  hotel (The 
      Euskadi), one  decent  restaurant (the Busy Bee), a fire 
      station, a hardware store, a couple of souvenir and antique 
      stores for the tourists. Pickups, SUVs and Subarus zip back 
      and forth, stopped only by the occasional pedestrian or the 
      town s single stoplight.

      Walt s Bronco waits at this stoplight, then pulls up to an 
      empty diagonal space in front of The Rotary Club building.  

      A BANNER out front:  DURANT ROTARY CLUB PANCAKE DAY. 

      Walt shuts the engine off. Takes a deep breath. He doesn t 
      seem to want to get out of the Bronco. He glances up in the 
      rearview mirror. Tilts it a little. He can now see the body 
      bag in the back.

                                  WALT
                    Mr. Parkford, how about you go in 
                    there. And I just lie down here. 
                    You can do my job.
                          (waits, then)
                    No? You re a lucky man.

      Walt gets out and heads toward the front door of the club. 
      Just outside, leaning against a wall, a HANDSOME CHEYENNE MAN 
      (40s) eats from a plate of pancakes. 

                                  HANDSOME CHEYENNE
                    You better get in there, Sheriff. 
                    The natives are getting restless.

      The Handsome Cheyenne man nods and takes a bite of bacon.

                                  WALT
                    Why are you sitting out here?

                                  HANDSOME CHEYENNE
                    I like the pancakes. The company 
                    gives me a headache.

      Walt nods. He gets it. Then he opens the door to...                                                                                    10.


      INT. ROTARY CLUB - CONTINUOUS

      THERE S A HUGE ANTLERED ELK HEAD MOUNTED ABOVE THE DOOR. THE 
      AMERICAN FLAG, THE FLAG OF WYOMING, and ROTARY CLUB PLAQUES 
      flank the entrance. People mingle and chat. Folding tables 
      are pulled together, covered in paper tablecloths, paper cups 
      of coffee, and paper plates of breakfast.

      Walt enters...He is spotted by a young guy who looks good in 
      his deputy uniform. BRANCH CONNALLY. 30. Branch stands up 
      fast, stopping his conversation with a couple of middle-aged 
      businessmen abruptly, and moves to Walt, who looks annoyed.

                                  WALT
                    Morning Branch.

                                  BRANCH 
                    Where you been Walt? People have 
                    been asking after you.

                                  WALT
                    Just out tending to the police side 
                    of the job. But happy to see you 
                    got the glad-handing covered.

                                  BRANCH
                    Can t serve the community if we 
                    don t talk to the community, 
                    Sheriff. Just here...representin . 

      Before Walt can respond to Branch...

                                    CITIZEN 1(O.C.)
                    There you are, Sheriff.

      Walt spins around to find the first of several LOCALS who 
      accost their elected official. Walt tries to maintain his 
      composure over a series of overlapping cuts...

                                    CITIZEN 1(CONT D)
                    We need to talk about the Durant 
                    Christmas decorations. Last year 
                    they were the ugliest in the state.

                                  WALT
                    Come on now. Cody s were uglier.

                                    CITIZEN 2
                    I still got raccoons in my yard.

                                  WALT
                    So do I.                                                                                    11.


                                    CITIZEN 3
                    That graffitti s bad for business. 
                    Someone has to paint over it.

                                  WALT
                    Brooks  Hardware sells paint and 
                    brushes. Aisle 4, I think.

                                    CITIZEN 4
                    Heard one of your deputies found a 
                    dead body. Is that why you re late?

      Branch eavesdrops on this exchange.

                                  WALT
                    Probably just a hunting accident. And 
                    when have you known me to be on time?

      Walt grins and goes, moves through a barrage of handshakes 
      pats on backs. Then, just as he clears them, he stops.

                                  SWEET OLDER WOMAN
                    Walter, I went to Church today...I 
                    lit a candle for her. 

      Walt doesn t know what to say. An awkward beat, then he puts 
      a hand on her shoulder and walks away, heading for the exit. 

      EXT. DURANT SIDEWALK, MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

      Walt walks. Branch follows with a FOAM CONTAINER OF FOOD. 

                                  BRANCH
                    I thought the Barnes  were just 
                    pulling another drunken prank. If I 
                    knew it was a real hunting accident, 
                    I woulda gone out there.

                                  WALT
                    Well you can t serve the community 
                    if you don t talk to em. Besides. I 
                    said it looks like a hunting 
                    accident.

                                  BRANCH
                    You mean it might not be?

                                  WALT
                    Look who just got interested in 
                    police work.

                                  BRANCH
                    Walt. If you got yourself a 
                      cellphone...
                                  (MORE)                                                                                    12.

                                  BRANCH (CONT'D)
                          (pulls out his phone)
                    ...you could ve called me directly 
                    and told me what was up.

                                  WALT
                    I don t need a cellphone Branch. I 
                    need you to be part of the team. 
                    You can t just dip in and out of 
                    the job when it suits you.

                                  BRANCH
                    Okay then, let me help the team. 
                    Who got shot?

                                  WALT
                      A sheep...And some guy named 
                      Parkford...

      They reach the doors of an OLD BRICK BUILDING, THE ABSAROKA 
      COUNTY SHERIFF S STATION. Branch holds the door. A beat.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Vic s lead deputy on this now.

                                  BRANCH
                          (hiding his anger)
                    I got ya. Maybe I should go out 
                    there and apologize to her.

                                  WALT 
                          (takes the container)
                    Nah. One dead body is enough.

      INT. ABSAROKA COUNTY SHERIFF S STATION - CONTINUOUS

      Originally a Carnegie Library, there s still plenty of old 
      character to the space. But it s not the bustling warren of 
      desks and support staff that we re used to seeing. This is a 
      limited operation indeed: one holding cell off to the side, 
      currently occupied by a HUNGOVER INMATE, a book-lined office 
      in the back, some file cabinets along the hall, a copier, fax 
      machine and a couple of communal desks in the main room, and 
      a ball of energy up front. 

      This is RUBY, 50, office manager/dispatch, and the oil of the 
      machine. She stands when Walt enters.

                                  WALT
                    Ruby, how we doing today?

      Ruby flips through a stack of POST-IT NOTES as she talks.                                                                                     13.


                                  RUBY
                    Someone trashed Craig Martin s pick 
                    up. Wrote all over it with spray 
                    paint. Mostly derogatory remarks, 
                    and one specific warning to women 
                    not to breed with Craig. That part 
                      I paraphrased. Doc Bloomfield wants 
                    to schedule a physical for you this 
                    week. Also Vic s wondering when 
                    you re going to send The Ferg out. 
                    And Cady wanted to confirm lunch.

      During all this, Walt has walked around the desks, right over 
      to the Hungover Inmate in the holding cell.

                                  WALT
                    Call Craig Martin. Tell him to 
                    apologize to his girlfriend.  No  
                    on the physical... 

      Walt slides the styrofoam container through the slot. 

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    And tell Cady we can try for lunch 
                    tomorrow. Again.

                                  RUBY
                    Why don t you call her, Sheriff. 
                    She s your daughter. 

                                  WALT
                    She likes you better.

      Walt turns to a male deputy at a desk. This is THE FERG, 28. 
      Built like a brick shithouse, but his face is all puppy-dog: 
      loyal, eager to please, and, while able to learn complex 
      tricks, probably not getting into Mensa. 

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Is The Ferg dressed for the 
                    elements today?

                                  THE FERG
                    I got some capilene in my car. 
                    Where am I going?

                                  WALT
                    Pronghorn Ridge trailhead. Vic s 
                    there. She ll fill you in.

                                  BRANCH
                    Ferg, I ll go with you.                                                                                    14.


                                  WALT
                    No Branch, you re staying here. Our 
                    victim had a 12 gauge Mossberg. See 
                    if he had it registered. Then I 
                    need you to check and see if he had 
                    any hunting licenses.
                          (hands Branch some notes)
                    Those are the plates on all the 
                    vehicles out at Pronghorn Ridge.

                    drivers, ask them if they had any 
                    contact with the Barnes boys, the 
                    victim, or if they heard any 
                    gunshots.

                    It s hunting season. Everybody 
                    hears gunshots.

                    Also call out to the Lazy J Ranch, 
                    see if they ve had any problems 
                    with their sheep, neighbors or 
                    ranch hands.

      Walt finds a large stainless steel coffee travel mug, fills 
      it, then heads out toward the front doors.

                                  RUBY
                    Where you going?

                                  WALT
                    Going to drop the victim off at the 
                    hospital so Doc Bloomfield can get 
                    an autopsy going. Then I m going to 
                      Wheatland.

                                  RUBY
                    That s a five hour drive.

                                  WALT
                    That s where the victim s from. 
                    This kind of news is best not 
                    delivered over the phone.

                    Ferg. Why are you still here?

      Ferg scrambles to his feet.                                                                                    15.


                                  BRANCH
                    Hey Walt, that s a long ass 
                    drive...I could do that for you--

                                  WALT
                    You could. But then you wouldn t be 
                    doing what I asked you to do.

      Walt exits. Ruby, Branch and The Ferg share a concerned look. 

                                  THE FERG
                    He hasn t done a notification in a

      INT. WALT S BRONCO - DAY

      Walt drives through The Big Empty -- the long, straight, flat 
      highway, heading for Wheatland, Wyoming. 

                                  RUBY (V.O.)
                    Maybe we should all spend a little 
                    less time wondering about the 
                    Sheriff and more time doing what he 
                    asked us to do.

      On the seat next to Walt: the wallet photo of the victim and 
      a smiling woman. Walt looks at it, then speeds off, the sun 
      falling in the sky. 

      EXT. PARKFORD RESIDENCE, WHEATLAND, WYOMING - LATER

      Walt gets out of his vehicle. He stares at the small, modest 
      1980 s house. Steeling himself. Then...

                                  WALT
                    I am a clamorous harbinger of blood 
                    and death.

      On Walt, we pre-lap SFX: KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

      INT. PARKFORD RESIDENCE, WHEATLAND, WYOMING - MOMENTS LATER

      Angle on the door. It opens. Revealing Walt, hat on.

                                  WALT
                    Are you Susan Parkford?
                          (She nods)
                    I m Sheriff Longmire. Absaroka County. 

      SUSAN PARKFORD (40) pretty, but it s been a few years since 
      she cared much about that, is surprised to see Walt.                                                                                    16.


                                  SUSAN
                    That s practically Montana.

                                  WALT
                    Yeah. Could I come in?

                                  SUSAN
                    Of course.

      Walt enters, takes off his hat. Rubs at his nose awkwardly.

                                  WALT
                    I just have a couple of questions, 
                    if you don t mind.

                                  SUSAN
                      Um...Okay.

                                  WALT
                    Do you know where your husband is?

                                  SUSAN
                    Laramie. At the University. There s 
                      a conference. He s a high school 
                    teacher. I think he s staying at 
                    the Days Inn near campus. Is he in 
                    some kind of trouble? 

                                  WALT
                    How long s he been in Laramie?

                                  SUSAN
                    He left yesterday morning. Early. 
                    Before I got up.

      Walt looks around the small, neat home. It s a well-lived in, 
      homey place. Photos of Susan and Grant. A FLY-TYING RIG on a 
      small desk by the window.

                                  WALT
                    He a fisherman?

                                  SUSAN
                    No. Well, a little bit. But that s 
                    mine. I tie flies and sell em to an 
                    outfitter in Jackson Hole. A little 
                    extra spending money.

                                  WALT
                    You or your husband hunters?

                                  SUSAN
                    What exactly is going on here?                                                                                    17.


                                  WALT
                    Ma am, do you have any idea what 
                    sort of business your husband might 
                    have up in Durant?

                                  SUSAN
                    Durant? No. Now please. Tell me 
                    what is going on.

      Walt puts his head down. His head stays down.

                                  SUSAN (CONT D)
                    Mr. Longmire, sir, you re making me 
                    real nervous...

      Walt finally lifts his head. He tries to pull it together, 
      and does long enough to croak...

                                  WALT
                    I have some very bad news.

      Walt s mouth opens to say more, but he says nothing. He takes 
      a breath. Tries again. 

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Your husband...

      The rest of the words choke in his throat. He can t finish.

                                  SUSAN
                    What is it? What is it? Please God, 
                    tell me. What s happened? Tell me, 
                    tell me.

      His eyes starting to tear, Walt tries one more time. 

                                  WALT
                    I m sorry Mrs. Parkford but...

      Again, he stops, eyes welling. He looks at the floor.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    He s gone. Your husband is gone. 
                    He s dead, ma am.

      The woman bursts into tears.

                                  SUSAN
                    No! No!

      Walt is just frozen, breathing unevenly. He s unable to offer 
      Susan any comfort as he s too busy trying to hold back his 
      own tears. The sound of her shouting blends into...                                                                                    18.


      The ROAR of a Ford Bronco engine...

      INT. WALT S BRONCO - SUNSET

      On Walt, pushing 95 mph on the speedometer. Still agitated, 
      he tries to find a smooth breath inside somewhere.

      Ruby s voice comes over the radio, but garbled: 

                                  RUBY
                    Walt, pick up, -- there? Vic needs 
                    to ---- you. Found ---.

                                  WALT 
                    Ruby, say that again, over.
                          (no luck)
                    Ruby? Ruby?

      Frustrated by the radio, Walt hangs it up, hard. He looks 
      back at the road. And sees something --

      A SIGN. Just off the highway. We see what Walt sees:

       BRANCH CONNALLY FOR SHERIFF.  

      It features a large photo of the Deputy Branch Connally.  
      Looking serious, yet friendly.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Son of a...

      But before he can finish the thought, he s snapped out of it 
      by the LOW BLAST OF AN 18-WHEELER SEMI S AIRHORN.

      Walt looks up to see said semi heading straight for him. 
      Instinctively he throws the wheel, sending the Bronco off the 
      highway, over the bumpy shoulder and finally down a berm.

      Walt s Bronco KEELS OVER AT 80MPH, hard and loud, and slides 
      on its passenger side. 

      WE GO INSIDE: Walt gets BUCKED around. His seatbelt strains 
      to hold him in place. Anything not nailed down RICOCHETS 
      around inside the Bronco. Walt s bright eyes narrow. We see 
      what he sees, and it is approaching fast--

      A JAGGED ROCKY WALL of a ditch. SLAM. The screen goes black. 
      And we re left wondering if maybe it s time to start worrying 
      about Walt after all...


                                  END OF ACT ONE                                                                                    19.


                                        ACT TWO

      EXT. OFF THE HIGHWAY - DUSK

      The Bronco tipped on its right side (the passenger side).  

      INT. BRONCO - DUSK, CONTINUOUS

      Walt hangs in the driver s seat, breathing heavy, strapped in 
      his seatbelt suspended the 6 ft above the passenger window, 
      looking down at the ground below...Walt s seatbelt will not 
      release. It s jammed...Walt digs in his coat pocket and pulls 
      out a BONE-HANDLED CASE FOLDING KNIFE with his right hand 
      that is bleeding from a GASH. BLOOD on the metal side of 
      Walt s radio tells us that may have been the cause.

      Walt unclicks the knife with his teeth, then cuts through the 
      seatbelt strap on his shoulder. Ffft...the tough fabric 
      breaks and gravity takes over. BANG, BOOM, BASH. He lands on 
      the passenger door below. Walt sucks up the pain.

      Walt rubs his injured bloody hand and wrist (his shooting 
      hand). Over his head, the radio mic dangles from the curly 
      cord, irritating the hell out of Walt. He sees the photo of 
      Parkford and his wife. Grabs it. Tucks it in his pocket.

      EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

      WIDE ON the Bronco. The driver s door opens up into the air, 
      like a submarine hatch. Then, wincing in pain, Walt hoists 
      himself up and out of the truck. He sits on the edge of the 
      truck, catches his breath and surveys the scene.

      EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER

      STRESSED MOAN of a wench as a TOW TRUCK S hook & cable pulls 
      Walt s Bronco back on its four wheels with a loud CA-CLUNK...

      The Bronco has large scrapes and dents along one side. We pan 
      over and find the tow truck driver, DENVER (30), with Walt.

                                  DENVER
                    Glad you re okay, Sheriff...we d 
                    sure hate to lose you.

      Denver looks inside the Bronco: A BIT OF ASSORTED TRASH and 
      BEER CANS. Denver pretends not to notice the beer cans.

                                  DENVER (CONT D)
                    Your wrist okay? Um, I could drive 
                    you back to get some X-rays?                                                                                    20.


                                  WALT
                    I m fine, Denver. I ll drive myself 
                    home. 
                          (then, pats his truck)
                    Bullet s tough. But before you take 
                    off, can I borrow your cellphone. 

      Walt extends his injured right hand: gimme, please. Denver 
      does...Walt dials slow, and puts the phone to his ear...

                                                                    INTERCUT WITH:

      EXT. CRIME SCENE - CONTINUOUS

      A CELL PHONE RINGS...We move fast from a chugging portable 
      generator -- long extension cords shoot out of it over the 
      snowy ground, we follow one orange cord to...Vic -- WHO IS 
      MELTING SNOW WITH A HAIRDRYER. She turns it off and...

                                  VIC
                          (answers her phone)
                    This is Vic.

                                  WALT
                    How s it going?

                                  VIC
                    Walt. What, you finally broke down 
                    and bought a cellphone?

                                  WALT
                    Borrowed one. My radio s on the 
                    fritz. Ruby said you called...

                                  VIC
                    I found a slug. Never seen one like 
                    it. It was about twenty yards from 
                    the body. Thirty from the sheep. 
                    Got The Ferg looking for the 
                    casing.

      We see The Ferg, way off in the distance, searching a snow 
      bank.

                                  VIC (CONT D)
                    I heard you did the notification.

                                  WALT
                    Yeah. Parkford s wife had no idea 
                    Grant was even in Durant. Thought 
                    he was in Laramie for the weekend. 

                                  VIC
                    Oooh. So then it s all about sex.                                                                                    21.


                                  WALT
                    Settle down, Vic. 

                                  VIC
                    When the husband lies about where 
                    he s going for the weekend, it s 
                    always about sex.

                                  WALT
                    Maybe. So...uh...Vic, did you know 
                    Branch was running for Sheriff? 

                                  VIC
                    What? Branch. Branch Connally. 
                    You re shitting me. I had no idea.

                    Saw a sign out by the county line.

                                  VIC
                    That sneaky son of a bitch. What 
                    are you going to do?

                                  WALT
                    It s a free country...Anyway, I ll 
                    stop by and pick up that slug in 
                    the morning. See if Omar can help 
                    us identify the murder weapon...Now 
                    don t work too late.

      Walt hangs up. Thinks. Then, as dusk fades into night...

      SFX OF GUNFIRE: BANG!POP!POP!BANG!POP!BANG!POP!BANG!BOOM!

      EXT. OMAR S FIRING RANGE - NEXT DAY

      Angle on: an OSAMA BIN LADEN TARGET as a bullet rips a hole 
      through his face. BANG!

      ANGLE ON: A STALL ON THE RANGE: A MAN stands reloading his 
      rifle, complete with scope. Fully decked out in expensive 
      OUTDOOR GEAR, this is OMAR (40s). He loves himself, his guns 
      and his country. In that order. 

      Omar looks through his YELLOW TINTED SHOOTING SHADES as Walt 
      approaches, walking stiffly, still hurting from his accident. 
      Walt returns waves from a few of the other members who fire 
      rifles and handguns at all kinds of targets.

                                  WALT
                          (re: Osama target)
                    You get the bastard, Omar?                                                                                    22.


                                  OMAR
                    Every single day.

      Walt notes all the various rifle cases, scopes, ammo clips, 
      all open on a flat bed trailer that s hooked up to the back 
      of an ATV. 

                                  OMAR (CONT D)
                          (ribbing him)
                    Thought I d get started since I was 
                    on Walt time. What happened to your 
                    hand?

                                  WALT 
                    Hurt it like an idiot. So?

                                  OMAR
                    Your message said you found a big 
                    slug. I pulled out all the most 
                    popular large-caliber rifles...This 
                    about that thing in the paper? 
                    Hunting accident out at Pronghorn 
                    Ridge?

                                  WALT
                    No comment.

                                  OMAR
                    Ah. The Longmire yes. And if you re 
                    here instead of a deputy, you think 
                    it s a murder. 

      Then Walt hands Omar A VERY OLD SLUG. Omar s eyes light up, 
      like he s been handed a precious gemstone.

                                  OMAR (CONT D)
                    When you said slug, you meant SLUG. 
                    That s a lot of lead. 45 to 70 
                    caliber at least. None of these 
                    rifles I ve been testing are made 
                    for that. 

                                  WALT
                    Any modern rifles you know of that 
                    would shoot this caliber?

                                  OMAR
                    No. Gotta be something old. In this 
                    part of the country, odds are that 
                    it s a Sharps. They called em horse 
                    killers. Take down a horse at 500 
                    yards. Swear to God. Make a cavalry 
                    man infantry with one pull of the 
                    trigger.

                    Standard military issue in the 
                    1870s and 80s. Pretty valuable 
                    antiques now.

      Walt hands Omar a photo of the sheep s wound.

                                  WALT
                    Sharps could have done this?

                                  OMAR
                    You bet. Specially since it looks 
                    like you could drive a stagecoach 
                    through that hole. That gun has its 
                      drawbacks...heavy, makes a hell of 
                    a lot of smoke, and with a drop 
                    block, it takes about five seconds 
                    to reload, but it s so accurate and 
                    powerful you shouldn t need to 
                    reload.

                                  WALT
                      Appreciate the help, Omar.

      Walt starts to leave.

                                  OMAR
                    Hey Walt. The Sharps is a sniper s 
                    weapon. There s two types of people 
                    who like to kill from a distance: 
                    cowards and pros. In my experience, 
                    they re both dangerous.

                                  WALT
                    I ll be alright.

      Walt starts walking away.

                                  OMAR
                    And if you have any more questions, 
                    next time send that feisty little 
                    Italian deputy of yours.

      Walt turns back. Looks at Omar, who s smiling suggestively.

                                  WALT
                    Be careful what you wish for.

      EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY 2

      Vic. Still melting snow with a hair dryer. We see that she 
      has melted a swath about five yards wide and a hundred yards 
      long. We look down the melted strip and see The Ferg, out in 
      the snow, yelling. Vic doesn t hear at first, so he yells 
      louder. She turns off her hair dryer.                                                                                    24.


                                  VIC
                    You find a casing Ferg?

                                  THE FERG
                    No. Pants!

      Vic approaches. The Ferg picks up a PAIR OF PANTS like a dead 
      animal; the BELT BUCKLE hangs down heavy, like the head of a 
      snake. Off Vic, perplexed.

      INT. POWDER RIVER ANTIQUES - DAY

      Walt enters, sees the owner, DAVE ESTES (40s) talking with a 
      CUSTOMER COUPLE. Dave is a solid, no-nonsense salesman. 
      Tourists think he s Indian. He s not. He s Hispanic. Dave 
      nods hello to Walt and then turns back to the couple he was 
      chatting with and hands them a card.

                                  ESTES
                    If you re interested in that rug, 
                    give me a call. You won t find one 
                    like that anywhere else.

      The couple exits, and Estes gives the BIG GUY HELPER (who s 
      been waiting off to the side) a nod. Estes and the helper 
      fold the rug, Estes turns to Walt.

                                  ESTES (CONT D)
                    When the economy tanks, first thing 
                    people give up is art and antiques. 

      The helper lifts the big rug over his shoulder and takes it 
      to the backroom.

                                  ESTES (CONT D)
                    So how can I help you today, 
                    Sheriff?

                                  WALT
                    I m looking for a Sharps rifle.

                                  ESTES
                    Hmmm, an original? I don t have 
                    any. Not right now. I come across 
                    them from time to time. This for 
                    hunting? Collecting? Or just to 
                    hang over your fireplace?

                                  WALT
                    Depends.                                                                                    25.


                                  ESTES
                    Because I do have a Henry  Yeller-
                    Boy  rifle and a Colt 396, needs 
                    some TLC though. Both used at 
                    Little Bighorn. If that interests 
                    you?

                                  WALT
                    Bet you got Custer s mustache back 
                    there, too. Nah. Mainly interested 
                    in the Sharps. And the names of the 
                    buyers and sellers. Sheriff 
                    business. 

                                  ESTES
                    Ah. Got it, well, I ve only seen a 
                    few in the last couple months. 
                    Charles Burnett sold me a Sharps 
                    back in the summer, but he bought 
                    it back a few weeks ago. His 
                      grandfather apparently was not too 
                    happy with Charles selling it 
                    without asking. It s sad. I have 
                    people come in here, whites, 
                    Cheyenne, Crow, all kinds, selling 
                    off family heirlooms to make ends 
                    meet. I m afraid some of the money 
                    doesn t go to paying bills if you 
                    know what I mean.

                                  WALT
                    I do. Any other names come to mind?

                                  ESTES
                    I file all the guns I buy or sell 
                    with ATF. You know what pain in the 
                    asses they are about registering 
                    firearms. You can call them. Or I 
                    can check my files?

                                  WALT
                    I was hoping you could save me a 
                    phone call. By the time I hang up, 
                    I ll have a Federal agent sitting 
                    in my office. And they don t tend 
                    to want to leave right away.

                                  ESTES
                      I understand. I ll check my office 
                    if you don t mind waiting.

                                  WALT
                          (smiles)
                    I m very good at waiting.                                                                                     26.


      Estes exits. Off Walt -- looking at an INDIAN LEDGER DRAWING 
      OF A BUFFALO HUNT hanging on the wall.

      EXT. ABSAROKA COUNTY SHERIFF S STATION, STREET - LATER

      Walt is climbing into his beat-up Bullet when he sees 
      something. Leaving the door open, he gets out and walks 
      toward a fast food wrapper blowing in the wind. Walt reaches 
      for it, misses, then catches it with a stomp of his foot. He 
      puts it in the trash as Vic pulls up in her SUV. She climbs 
      out in a hurry, eager to tell Walt...

                                  VIC 
                    When we expanded the grid to look 
                    for the casing, I found something 
                    else. Pants. 

                                  WALT
                    You can tell me all about it on the 
                    way to the Rez. 

                                  VIC
                      Okay...You talked to Branch yet 
                    about that knife in your back?

                                  WALT
                    Just hop in.

                                  VIC
                    I want to be there when you do.
                          (Then, notices the damage)
                    What the hell happened to your 
                    truck? And your hand...You hurt 
                    your hand.

                                  WALT
                    You re right. You should consider a 
                    career in law enforcement.

      INT. WALT S BRONCO - LATER

      Walt drives. Vic rides shotgun, holding up a bag containing 
      the pants.

                                  VIC
                    They were a good 75 yards from the 
                    victim. Even further from where the 
                    slug was found. And they were 
                    nowhere near the trailhead or any 
                      campsites. 

                                  WALT
                    Sounds like they might not be 
                    related to our murder.                                                                                    27.


                                  VIC
                    Except look at them. They re in 
                    good enough shape that they clearly 
                    haven t been sitting out there for 
                    months -- they even smell like 
                    cigarette smoke. Problem is, 
                    they re Wranglers...pretty common 
                    pants and a pretty common size. 34-
                    32. They wouldn t fit you, Walt.

      Walt is taken by something though: the belt buckle. And 
      almost swerves off the road when he looks at it...

                                  VIC (CONT D)
                      Whoa...you alright?

                                  WALT
                    Sorry. It s just...that buckle. Let 
                    me see it.

      Vic holds the wheel as Walt inspects the buckle for a beat... 

                                  VIC
                    You recognize it?

                                  WALT
                    Maybe. But I can t think of why. 

      Walt takes back the wheel, drives onward. 

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    My memory s slipping. Guess I gotta 
                    start writing more stuff down.

      Walt hands Vic the list that Dave Estes gave him earlier.

                    They re all Cheyenne and they ve 
                    all bought Sharps rifles from Dave 
                    Estes in the last year. That s the 
                    gun that killed Parkford. Estes 
                    printed out a picture for us too.

                          (re: Sharps rifle photo)
                    In a world where you can buy an 
                    AK47 off the internet, why use an 
                    antique like this?                                                                                    28.

                    Might be old, but it still does the 
                    job.

                                  VIC
                    Any of these guys connected to 
                    Grant Parkford?

                                  WALT
                    Don t know. That s why I want to 
                    talk to them.

                                  VIC
                    And you think the tribal police are 
                    gonna help us do that? 

                                  WALT
                    I like to think that when there s a 
                    murder involved, they ll put aside 
                    petty personal issues and help us 
                    find a killer.

                                  VIC
                    They might not think that you 
                    putting their Police Chief in 
                    prison is exactly petty.

                                  WALT
                    He s the one who decided to run an 
                    extortion racket. Not me.

      EXT. TRIBAL POLICE STATION - DAY

      As Walt and Vic walk quietly toward the front door, it BURSTS 
      OPEN. Out comes a CHEYENNE OFFICER, MATHIAS, in uniform. 
      Another Cheyenne officer right behind. Neither are happy.

                                    MATHIAS
                          (pointing at Walt)
                    What did I tell you?!

      Walt tries to answer. But before he can, Mathias hauls off 
      and throws a PUNCH at Walt who chooses not to block it. BAM. 
      THE PUNCH LANDS. Walt takes the impact. Unfazed. Vic, not so 
      much. She shoves Mathias away.

                                  VIC
                    What the hell?!!

      A mini-scuffle between Vic and both Tribal Police Officers 
      ensues. Walt breaks it up. Pushes the Officers away with his 
      hurt hand. Pulls Vic back with the other.                                                                                     29.


                                  WALT
                    Okay, Vic, that s enough...he did 
                    say he d knock me out the next time 
                    he saw me. Though you didn t really 
                    keep your word did you, Mathias?

                                    MATHIAS
                    What do you want?

      Walt pulls out his list of names from Dave Estes.

                                  WALT 
                    I d like to talk to some people of 
                    interest who live on the Rez. 

                                    MATHIAS
                    You don t get it. You have no 
                    authority here. Those are the 
                    treaty rules. And I know how 
                    important treaties are to you 
                    whites, Sheriff Walter Longmire.

                                  WALT
                    I know that. But there s been a 
                      shooting... 

                                    MATHIAS
                    The victim Cheyenne?
                          (Walt shakes his head no)
                    Well, hunting accidents happen all 
                    the time on the high plains. 

                                  WALT
                    I know you re pissed at me, but 
                    this is serious. There s been a 
                    murder. I know the kind of rifle 
                    used. It s rare, but at least three 
                    folks on the Rez have one. So just 
                    this once if we could smoke the 
                    peace pipe, and you let me and Vic 
                    on the Rez...

                                    MATHIAS
                    Give me the list and we will look 
                    into it for you. Kinda like a joint 
                    task force. But I gotta tell you, 
                    we are short-handed around here. 
                    See...we lost our Police Chief.

      Walt stares at him. No one s gonna budge. Dead end.

      INT. ABSAROKA COUNTY SHERIFF S STATION - DAY

      Walt and Vic enter. Walt s pensive. Vic is pissed off.                                                                                     30.


                                  VIC
                    How could you just stand there and 
                    take that? That son of a bitch 
                    better not step off the Rez.

                                  WALT
                    For the last time, leave it alone. 
                    No point making things worse. He 
                    had to get his anger out of his 
                    system. Sooner he does that, sooner 
                    we can get back to a little 
                      cooperation...

      And then Branch approaches from his desk, all pep and 
      enthusiasm. Vic watches the following intently. 

                                  BRANCH
                      Okay...now it wasn t easy, but I ve 
                    tracked down all the vehicles 
                    parked at Pronghorn Ridge. Aside 
                    from the victim s SUV, and the 
                    Barnes  truck, there were two other 
                    vehicles: one belonged to a pair of 
                    hikers. The other belongs to Scott 
                    Miller. His wife says he s hunting 
                    elk up the mountain. Been gone two 
                    days and she expects him back 
                    tomorrow. Around dinner time.

                                  VIC
                    Well aren t you the eager little 
                    beaver.

                                  WALT
                    Scott Miller got a license?

                                  BRANCH
                          (hands Walt a photocopy)
                    I thought you might ask that. Also, 
                    the weather service called back, 
                    told me the snow came on pretty 
                    sudden around 3:30-4 am yesterday, 
                    so Parkford was probably shot 
                    before then. When it was still 
                    clear skies and a full moon. 

                                  VIC
                    Given where we found the slug, 
                    whoever shot Parkford would have 
                    had a nice silhouette and a clear 
                    line of sight.                                                                                    31.


                                  BRANCH
                    I talked to Jake Hicks from the 
                    Lazy J Ranch. He s pissed about the 
                    dead sheep, and he says he s never 
                    heard of the victim. And... Um... 
                    speaking of the victim... After you 
                    left, I remembered something. I was 
                    looking up gun registrations and it 
                    hit me. Parkford came into the 
                    station a couple months ago. 

                                  WALT
                    What? Our victim came in here and 
                    you didn t tell me?

                                  VIC
                          (goody)
                    Uh oh. 

                                  BRANCH
                          (A nasty look at Vic, 
                            then, back to Walt)
                    Look, I m sorry I didn t remember 
                    the name immediately. It s not like 
                    you showed me a picture of the guy. 
                    But I did remember it and I m 
                    telling you now. Maybe if we had a 
                    more up-to-date computer system 
                    around here...

                                  WALT
                    Why? Why, Branch? Why did the 
                    victim come into the station.

                                  BRANCH
                    Some friend of his, a woman named 
                    Lynn Stillwater, was looking for 
                    her missing daughter. Parkford was 
                    helping out. He brought a photo of 
                    the missing girl. Her name s Lilly.

      Branch hands him the photo of a 10 year-old girl: Lilly.

                                  WALT
                    And what did you do?

                                  BRANCH
                      Everything I could, but Parkford 
                    wasn t a relative. Couldn t file a 
                    missing persons claim, and he said 
                    the missing girl was from the Rez, 
                    so it was a tribal police problem. 
                      I forwarded the info on to them.

                      I could ve called the Feds but I 
                    know you don t like when they get 
                    involved.

                                  WALT
                    Why didn t you tell me any of this 
                    at the time?

                                  BRANCH
                    Well, you haven t exactly been on 
                    top of your game for the last year. 
                    Vic, The Ferg and I have been 
                    trying to handle everything, but 
                    it s not easy. 

      Vic watches from a safe distance. Sees Walt go red.

                                  WALT
                    Sorry I haven t been here to hold 
                    your hand. It s called delegating. 
                    That s part of the Sheriff s job, 
                    Branch. Speaking of which, is there 
                    anything else you haven t told me? 
                    Anything else I should know about? 
                    Anything?

                                  BRANCH
                    ...uhhh no...
                          (Walt turns to leave)
                    So where you going now?

                                  WALT
                    To do what you should have done. 
                    Talk to this girl s mom and find 
                    out what the hell Grant Parkford 
                    was doing in this county.

      Vic stops Walt on his way out the door. 

                                  VIC
                    I know your memory s slipping, but 
                    didn t the tribal police basically 
                    just tell you to stay the F off the 
                      reservation? 

                                  WALT
                    Well. I didn t say it was gonna be 
                    easy.

      INT. RED PONY BAR - EVENING

      A bustling dive bar filled with a mix of MINERS blowing off 
      steam and CASINO PLAYERS drowning their sorrows. 

      A BUSBOY grabs empty plates and beer glasses from a table and 
      carries them toward the kitchen as Walt enters. Walt sees 
      Henry behind the bar (Henry s the Handsome Cheyenne from 
      earlier) talking to a PAIR OF ATTRACTIVE WOMEN. Walt makes a 
      bee-line for him. 

                                  WALT
                    Hey Henry. I need a favor.

                                  HENRY
                    So do I. Double date. Dinner.
                          (off Walt s frown)
                    Doesn t have to be here at the Red 
                    Pony. We ll go somewhere nice. Gina 
                    doesn t want to leave her sister, 
                    and I was just saying how my best 
                    friend is single, employed and 
                    almost as charming as me.

                                  WALT
                    Will you ladies excuse us?

      The women leave. Henry sighs as he turns to Walt.

                                  HENRY
                    Gotta get back on the horse, Walt.

                                  WALT
                      Appreciate the advice, but that s 
                    not what I m here for.

      Off Henry, intrigued...

      Henry Standing Bear s shitty pickup truck rumbles past the 
      tribal police station. Henry is alone in the cab. Officer 
      Mathias is out in front. He watches the truck pass. 

      EXT. LYNN STILLWATER S HOUSE - NIGHT

      A small, run down house, blankets hung in the window as 
      curtains.

      Henry s truck pulls in, and it is immediately ATTACKED by TWO 
      SCRAWNY DOGS. One of them leaps into the truck bed and clamps 
      its teeth on a blanket.                                                                                    34.


      At which point we hear a very human HOWL. Walt s hiding place 
      has been discovered. He leaps to his feet, holding onto his 
      already injured right hand in pain.

      Henry joins him and the two of them try frantically to keep 
      the mean, snarling dogs at bay...

      LYNN STILLWATER, a tired 40ish Cheyenne, emerges from the 
      house. She gives a sharp WHISTLE, and the dogs abandon Walt.

                                  LYNN
                    Henry, I thought you were coming 
                    alone.

                                  HENRY
                    He wants to help.

                                  LYNN
                    Does he?

      INT. LYNN STILLWATER S HOUSE - NIGHT

      Not much to her name, and what she has is a bit frayed, but 
      it s arranged nicely. Like Lynn herself.

      Walt bandages his wound, looks at the sleeping dogs lying on 
      the cold floor. 

                                  LYNN
                    Did you find her? Did you?

                                  WALT
                    Not yet.

      Walt opens up Parkford s file to refer to his notes. Lynn 
      sees the photo of Lilly inside. Shakes her head.

                                  LYNN
                    Well how can you with that photo? 
                    That s old. Lilly s 16 years old now.

      Walt takes this in as Lynn goes to a drawer, brings over a 
      framed photo of Lilly, clearly older in this one. A sweet 
      looking 16. 

                                  LYNN (CONT D)
                    This is her now. I put it away 
                    after--
                          (trails off, then)
                    What happened to my Lilly?

                                  WALT
                    I don t know.                                                                                     35.


                                  LYNN
                            (frustration bubbling)
                    3 months and still no one will help 
                    me.

                                  WALT
                    I want to, Ms. Stillwater. Really.

      She glares at Walt. Henry tries to play the diplomat.

                                  HENRY
                    You said 3 months. Is that how long 
                    Lilly has been gone?

                                  LYNN
                    Yes. 3 months ago we had a stupid 
                    fight and she stormed out.

                                  WALT
                    Do you have any idea where she 
                    might have gone?

                                  LYNN
                    If I knew that don t you think I d 
                    have gone after her? 

                                  WALT
                    Of course... I just... 

                                  HENRY
                    Lynn. Have you heard from Lilly?

                                  LYNN
                    Once. Right after she left. She 
                    called and said she was staying with 
                    a friend. An older girl who left the 
                      reservation two years ago. Lilly 
                    said everything was okay so I 
                    dedided to give her a few days to 
                    calm down. But then she called me 
                    again. She sounded different. 
                    Scared. Said she wasn t coming back.

                                  WALT
                    What do you know about the girl she 
                    was staying with? 

                                  LYNN
                    I can t find her anywhere. But I 
                    talked to others about her. They 
                    say she s into drugs. And they say 
                    she s a...prostitute. My boyfriend 
                    says he s heard Lilly is doing that 
                    too. But I don t believe it.                                                                                     36.


                                  WALT
                    Did you talk to the tribal police?

                                  LYNN
                          (bitter)
                    They said since Lilly was off the 
                    rez it was out of their hands. A 
                       jurisdiction  issue. That I should 
                    talk to your office. 

                                  WALT
                    You should have.

                                  LYNN
                    Well. In my experience, you people 
                    tend to listen to other white 
                    people more than a woman like me. 
                    So I asked a friend to help. 

                                  WALT
                    Grant Parkford? 
                          (she nods)
                    Why would you ask someone from so 
                    far away?

                                  LYNN
                    Because Grant is Lilly s father.
                          (off Walt s expression)
                    He didn t tell you that? 

                                  WALT
                    He spoke with one of my deputies.

                                  LYNN
                    You know things are bad when the 
                    only person you can count on is 
                    someone you haven t seen in 17 
                    years. But I knew I could count on 
                    Grant. He s a good man. Maybe the 
                    only one I ve ever known.

                                  WALT
                    Why would Grant give us such an 
                    outdated photo of Lilly?

                                  LYNN
                    It s the most recent one he has. 
                    Every year I sent him a photo on 
                    Lilly s birthday. And he d send a 
                    check. Then one year, the photo was 
                    returned with no forwarding address. 
                    And there were no more checks. I 
                    could have used that money. I could 
                    have made things better for Lilly.

                                  LYNN (CONT'D)
                    It s not easy raising a girl all 
                    alone.

                                  WALT
                    Well I m sure your boyfriend helps 
                    out a little.

                                  LYNN
                    Charles? He was no help. More like 
                    having another kid in the house. And 
                    I should have said  ex-boyfriend.  

                                  WALT
                    Charles. That wouldn t happen to be 
                    Charles Burnett, would it?

      Lynn nods. On Walt, thinking: Charles Burnett. Walt stands.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Ms. Stillwater, I m very sorry 
                    we ve been so slow to get involved. 
                    But now we are, and we ll do what 
                    we can to find your girl.

                                  LYNN
                    Thank you. And when you see Grant, 
                    tell him thank you. I know it s too 
                    hard for him to come here.

      Henry looks at Walt...is he going to break the news to her?

                                  WALT
                    I ll tell him.

      Walt exits. Off Henry, watching his friend go...

      INT./EXT. - HENRY S TRUCK - LATER NIGHT

      Walt rides shotgun. Henry drives.

                                  HENRY
                    You should have told her Grant 
                    Parkford was dead.

                                  WALT
                    Lynn s not legally related to him, 
                    so I m not obligated to tell her. 
                    Besides, she might be involved. Or 
                    her boyfriend. Charles Burnett.

                                  HENRY
                    What you did is dishonest.                                                                                    38.


                                  WALT
                    Sometimes to do my job you can t be 
                    as forthcoming as you d like to be. 
                    You have to see how people react. 
                    Be patient. And if that helps me 
                    figure out who killed Parkford and 
                    where Lilly is, so much the better. 
                          (beat)
                    We pretty much swept the hookers out 
                    of Absaroka last year. You heard 
                    anything new about prostitution in 
                    the county or on the Rez?

                                  HENRY
                    Not my thing. Never had to pay for it.

                                  WALT
                          (nods, then a long beat)
                    Have I lost a step?

                                  HENRY
                    What?

                                  WALT
                    I just had to ask you about the 
                    state of the sex trade in my own 
                    county.

                                  HENRY
                    You are an optimist. You do not 
                    like to think about the depravity 
                    of human kind. And also, yes. You 
                    have lost a step.

                                  WALT
                      I wouldn t say I m an optimist. Up 
                    until an hour ago, I thought Grant 
                    Parkford was some guy having an 
                    affair. Never occurred to me he was 
                    doing something...heroic.

                                  HENRY
                    Heroic?

                                  WALT
                    Trying to save his daughter from 
                      prostitution? Seems honorable.

                                  HENRY
                    You think 16 years of abandonment 
                    by her father might have something 
                    to do with her getting into 
                      prostitution in the first place?                                                                                    39.


      Henry s truck pulls into The Red Pony parking lot.

                                  WALT
                    Yeah, the guy screwed up, but isn t 
                    it better that he tried to make up 
                    for it?

                                  HENRY
                    Maybe. But just because a man 
                    decides to make up for all his 
                    mistakes in one day doesn t mean 
                    the rest of the world is going to 
                    be so quick to forgive him.

      Walt nods. Gets out of the truck. A waning moon shines down 
      as Walt walks across the parking lot towards his Bronco.

      INT. SHERIFF S STATION, HOLDING CELL - NEXT MORNING

      Walt sleeps on a cot. Ruby approaches, then clangs a metal 
      water bottle along the bars.

                                  RUBY
                    Wake up. You have a visitor.

      INT. WALT S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

      CADY LONGMIRE (27). Dressed a bit more professionally than 
      most of the folks in Durant, Cady sits in her dad s chair.

                                  WALT
                    Hey, punk. What re you doing here 
                    so early?

                                  CADY
                      Everything okay, Dad? You cancelled 
                    lunch and dinner.

                                  WALT
                    I didn t cancel dinner. We never 
                    had that planned. How about some 
                    breakfast at the Busy Bee right 
                    now? 

      He turns to exit, indicating she should follow...

                                  CADY
                    I have to be in court.

                                  WALT
                    So no breakfast.

      Walt turns back. As he does, Cady notices his injuries.                                                                                     40.


                                  CADY

                    This job. You ve got to be more 
                    careful.

                    You might not have to worry about 
                    that much longer. Branch Connally s 
                    decided to run against me, so I 
                    might be out of a job soon enough.

      Walt stops. Notices that Cady is holding the wooden box of 
      tea we saw earlier in Walt s kitchen. 

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Where did you get that?

                                  CADY
                    From your house. I stopped by last 
                    night to check on you. The place is 
                    even more of a mess. I started to 
                    clean up...but then I saw this.
                          (re: the wooden box)
                    You ve got mom s ashes in the

                    I really think you need to talk to 
                    someone.

                                  WALT
                    I talk to people all day long, 
                    Cady. What I could really use is a 
                    break from all the talking.

                                  CADY
                          (re: wooden tea box)
                    You need to deal with this, Dad. 
                    People are asking me where they can 
                    visit Mom. Scatter her ashes. Put 
                    them in an urn at a mausoleum. Put 
                    her name on a freaking bench, but 
                    deal with it. Because I m not going 
                    to watch you just wallow in this 
                    for another year.

      Through the office window, Walt sees Dave Estes enter and 
      move to Ruby. Phew. A way out of the conversation. Walt picks 
      up the tea box and clears a path for Cady to get to the door. 

                                  WALT
                    You re gonna be late for court.

      Cady reluctantly exits, kisses Walt on the cheek, then nods 
      as she crosses paths with Estes.

                                  ESTES 
                    Hey Cady...
                          (no response, so...)
                    Hey Walt. I went back five years 
                    into my records and found more 
                    Sharps rifle buyers and sellers. 

      He gives Walt the list.

                                  WALT
                    Thank you, Dave.

      Estes lingers. Staring at the wall.

      Walt is saved from haggling by Ruby.

                    Walt. You better get over to the 
                    Qwik Stop. It s Vic.

      EXT. QWIK STOP MARKET - DAY

      Walt arrives to find that Vic has blocked a beat up truck 
      with her vehicle and won t let it out of its parking space. 

      The driver is the LARGE, TATTOOED, and currently very angry 
      CHARLES BURNETT (40). Burnett is out of the vehicle face to 
      face, with Vic. Or rather face to chest. Burnett is a good 
      head taller than Vic. 

                                    CHARLES
                    Move your damn car! I gotta get to 
                    work!

                    movin  until you tell me where you 
                    were two nights ago.

                                  WALT
                    Deputy Moretti, what s going on?

                                  VIC
                    This idiot is Charles Burnett. One 
                    of the guys on Dave Estes s list of 
                    Sharps rifle owners...and he won t 
                    answer my questions--

                                    CHARLES

                    Okay okay, let s all calm down...

      But Charles Burnett is past that. He climbs into his truck.                                                                                    43.

                    Dude!

      Charles throws his truck in reverse and RAMS it backward into 
      Vic s vehicle. Walt closes his eyes. He opens them and sees--

      INT. ABSAROKA COUNTY SHERIFF S STATION - DAY

      Charles Burnett, handcuffed, in a chair across from Walt.

                                  WALT
                    Do you think you ve calmed down 
                    enough to answer some questions?

                    Long as you keep that lady out of 
                    my sight.

      Walt nods to Vic, still pissed off, who obediently melts back 
      into the bullpen area. She sits at her desk. Walt continues.

                                  WALT
                    So. You were Lynn Stillwater s

                                    CHARLES
                    For a while. She dumped me. That 
                    chick is high-maintenance, and I 
                    wouldn t put up with her bullshit.

                    What bullshit exactly? 

                                    CHARLES 
                    She cried a lot. Always complaining 
                    about money. Blaming her problems 
                    on other people. Usually me. 

                                  WALT
                    Did you know Lilly?

                                    CHARLES
                    Not really. She was never around. 
                    Stayed out late. Got into trouble. 
                    I tried to use a little discipline, 
                    but she didn t want to hear it.

                                  WALT
                    Lynn said you think Lilly is 
                    involved in prostitution.                                                                                    44.


                                    CHARLES
                    I ve heard some rumors.

                                  WALT
                    From who?
                          (Charles shrugs)
                    You familiar with a man named Grant 
                    Parkford?

                                    CHARLES
                    Hell yeah. The great white hope. 
                    The asshole abandons her with a 
                    baby, and 16 years later, she still 
                    talks about him like he s a hero.

                                  WALT
                    Just so you know, he s dead now. 

                                    CHARLES
                    He the guy who was in that hunting 
                    accident the other day?

                                  WALT
                    Dave Estes tells me you bought a 
                    Sharps rifle off him last month. 
                    Now I don t like to stereotype, but 
                    you don t strike me as the kind of 
                    guy who goes antiquing...

      Now Charles realizes what he s really suspected of.

                                    CHARLES
                    I didn t kill Parkford. 

                                  WALT
                    Then you won t mind us taking a 
                    look at your Sharps rifle.

                                    CHARLES
                    No way.

                                  WALT
                    Oh. The Qwik Stop. It used to be an 
                    Esso station.
                          (Walt stops, thinks, then)
                    You decide to let us take a look at 
                    that Sharps of yours, we can talk 
                    about negotiating the charges.

      Walt heads for Vic s desk. 

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Vic, give me those pants.

                          (ignores the inuendo)
                      I remember why the belt buckle on 
                    the pants looks so familiar: It s 
                    from the old Open 9 Ranch.

                                  VIC
                    Never heard of it.

                                  WALT
                    You wouldn t have. It got sold 
                    about twenty years ago. And they 
                    changed their name.

      EXT. DRIGGS RANCH - DAY

      GARRETT DRIGGS (50), a well-heeled cattleman with a well-fed 
      gut stands beside Walt and Vic a few steps in front of ten 
      men lined up along a fence: A FEW MEXICAN-AMERICAN HANDS, 
      some MOUSTACHED OLD SCHOOL COWBOYS and Garrett s son, CALEB.

                                    GARRETT
                    I told the Sheriff you all would 
                      cooperate. So I expect you will. 

                                  WALT
                    We found something out at the 
                    Pronghorn Ridge trailhead. 

      Vic steps in. She holds up the jeans. 

                                  VIC
                    And we want to return them to their

                    Okay then. Everybody...take off 
                    your pants. 

      The men all grumble and ad lib protests.

                                  WALT 
                      I wouldn t ask you fellas to do 
                    this, but it involves a possible 
                    murder. So. Drop em.

      The guys start to take off their pants, then they try on the 
      Wranglers in a series of quick cuts: Too big. Way too small. 
      Too short. One FAT GUY starts to unbutton. Vic stops him. 

                                  VIC
                    No need. You have an honest face. 

      Finally she gets to Caleb. Cockily, and all the while smiling 
      at Vic, he puts them on. They fit perfectly.

                                  VIC (CONT D)
                    Hello Cinderella.

                                  CALEB
                    They re Wranglers, could belong to 
                    anybody in the state.

                                  WALT
                    Not wearing this belt.

      Walt holds up the belt buckle so the kid s dad can see it.

                                    GARRETT
                    Caleb, that s the buckle I gave you 
                    for your 21st birthday. What the 
                    hell is going on?!

      Off Caleb. Busted...

      INT. DRIGGS RANCH - LATER

      Walt, Vic, Caleb and Garrett sit around a table in a large 
      ranch kitchen. Caleb s arrogance has largely vanished.

                                  CALEB
                    I m telling you. I don t know how 
                    my pants got out there. Maybe one 
                    of my friends was pranking me...

                                  WALT
                    There s a man dead and a girl 
                    missing.

                                  WALT (CONT'D)
                    And for some reason you were in 
                    such a hurry to get away from 
                    Pronghorn Ridge that you left 
                    without your pants. I m not leaving 
                    here without an explanation.

                                    GARRETT
                    Caleb. You answer the sheriff s 
                    questions or I ll take you to jail 
                    my own self.

      Caleb looks at his hands. Takes a breath, then...

                                  CALEB
                    I was out there trying to get laid.

                                  WALT
                    Who were you there with?

                                  CALEB
                    Nobody. I mean, I went there alone.

                                  VIC
                    Just you and a herd of soft, 
                    compliant sheep...

                                  CALEB
                    Huh? No. That s where the, y know, 
                    girls were. You know. The girls... 
                    you pay to...you know...

                                  WALT
                    You mean prostitutes? Caleb, there 
                    aren t any prostitutes anywhere 
                    near Pronghorn Ridge.

                                  CALEB
                    Well not now. They moved the RV.

                                  WALT
                    The RV...?

                                  CALEB
                    Yeah. They move around so folks 
                    like you can t bust em. 

                                  WALT
                    So you were with a prostitute in an RV.

                                  CALEB
                    Yeah. But we didn t do anything. I 
                    mean, we were starting to kinda get 
                    into it when this big guy busted 
                    in.

                                  CALEB (CONT'D)
                    I was like,  hang on, dude.  But he 
                    threw me out the door without my 
                    damn pants on.

                                  WALT
                    Can you describe the big guy?

                                  CALEB
                    Big. Darkish hair I think. I was 
                    drunk. I didn t get a look at him.

                                  WALT
                    How about the girl? You spent a 
                    little more quality time with her. 

      Caleb hesitates. But a look at his dad tells him to 
      cooperate. Caleb pulls out a cellphone. He scrolls, finds 
      what he s looking for and holds it up for Walt to see. 

                                  CALEB
                    My friends wanted proof that I did 
                    the deed. 

      They compare the cellphone photo to mom s photo. It s Lilly.

                                  WALT
                    You say this RV moved around so 
                    folks like me can t find it. How do 
                    folks like you go about finding it?

                                  CALEB
                    Uh...I don t know...

                                  WALT
                    The girl in this photo. The one you 
                    paid to have sex with. She s 16 
                    years old. That s statutory rape in 
                    the state of Wyoming.

                                  CALEB
                    But I never even had sex with her!

                                    GARRETT
                    Answer the damn question! 

                                  CALEB
                    If you want to find out where the 
                    RV is, you just talk to the Indian 
                    at the Red Pony.

      Vic and Walt look at each other. Henry?

      INT. RED PONY BAR - DAY

      Henry uses the CLAW END OF A HAMMER to bust A HOLE in the 
      drywall behind the bar. He pauses and looks at the hole, 
      disappointed. This hole joins six other holes on the wall. 

      Walt enters with a dark expression. Henry notices, but he s 
      too frustrated and too focused on his task. He hammers again. 

                                  WALT
                          (watches his friend, then)
                    What the hell have you gotten 
                    yourself into, Henry?

                                  HENRY
                          (not turning around)
                    I can t find the junction box. 
                    Guess I drywalled over it.

                                  WALT
                    That s not what I m asking about.

                                  HENRY
                          (turns, takes in Walt s 
                            demeanor)
                    Well then I guess you better tell 
                    me what you are asking about so I 
                    can give you a better answer.

                                  WALT
                    Are you running some kind of escort 
                    service out of this bar? 
                          (long beat, no answer)
                    Well?

                                  HENRY
                    I m only gonna wait so long for you 
                    to crack a smile, Walt. Then I m 
                    gonna have to assume that you re 
                    not kidding.

                                  WALT
                    I asked you a very simple question.

                                  HENRY
                    No. You asked me a very confusing 
                    question.

                                  WALT
                    Really?  Cause I just talked to a 
                    young man who told me some inside 
                    info.

                                  WALT (CONT'D)
                    Said if you wanted female company 
                    in Absaroka County and you were 
                    willing to pay for the pleasure, 
                    you should go to the Red Pony and 
                    talk to the Indian.

                                  HENRY
                    So 38 years, then.
                          (off Walt s confused look)
                    We ve known each other for 37 
                    years. So 38 years must be how long 
                    you have to be Walt Longmire s 
                    friend before he trusts you.

                                  WALT
                    I am trying to find the person who 
                    murdered Grant Parkford, and I m 
                    pretty sure whoever that is will 
                    lead me to that missing girl...

                                  HENRY
                    Well you better get going then.

      Henry turns and swings the claw hammer at the wall. A little 
      harder this time. Walt exits. After he does, Henry stops his 
      work. He turns and looks at the door, thinking...

      INT. ABSAROKA COUNTY SHERIFF S STATION - DAY

      Walt enters. Vic and The Ferg sit at a desk cataloging 
       evidence,  mostly WET TRASH from the crime scene. 

      Walt keeps walking. He stops at the door to his office. It is 
      covered with Post-it notes. He starts to read one when...

      CLICK. The sound of a rifle being cocked. Walt turns quickly. 
      It s Branch. Proudly holding an OLD RIFLE just like the one 
      in the photo Estes gave them. A box of shells sits on the 
      desk beside him. 

                                  BRANCH
                    I managed to get my hands on 
                    Charles Burnett s gun by talking to 
                    the tribal police. They were happy 
                    to help. I served a search warrant 
                    and got the rifle, plus a box of 
                    old black powder shells.

      Walt yanks the rifle out of Branch s hands, examines the 
      rifle. Then cocks it. Looks in the breech.

                                  WALT
                    This is not the murder weapon.                                                                                    51.


                                  BRANCH
                    How do you know? We didn t even get 
                    a chance to run ballistics tests...

      Walt grabs a box of shells from Branch...And loads the 
      Sharps. Walt aims across the room and PULLS THE TRIGGER. 
      CLICK. Nothing. Walt strides towards the holding cell. 

                                  WALT
                    There. We just did a ballistics 
                    test. If you don t clean these 
                    rifles that use black powder 
                    shells, the black powder corrodes 
                    the metal. This weapon s a mess. It 
                    doesn t even have a firing pin.

      Walt points out the missing pin, then hands the rifle through 
      the bars to Charles. Who can t believe what he just saw. Vic 
      stifles a laugh. Enjoys the look on Branch s face.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Unlock him, Ferg, and see him to 
                    the door.

      The Ferg gets up, follows orders...Walt exits to his office. 
      Branch stands there, stunned and pissed. 

      INT. WALT S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

      Walt at his desk, stares at the old photo of the girl, Lilly. 

                                  BRANCH
                          (enters)
                    You didn t have to do that.
                          (Walt just listens)
                    You didn t have to make a big deal 
                    out of it in front of everybody.
                          (Walt nods, maybe)
                    Y know, Walt, I haven t made a big 
                    deal over you not showing up for 
                    work. Calling in sick. Or just 
                    sitting in here reading a book 
                    while the rest of us cover for you. 
                    Never thought it was necessary to 
                    make a big deal about that.

                                  WALT
                    Sounds like you re already writing 
                    negative campaign ads.
                          (Branch looks confused)
                    I saw the sign, Branch. Nice photo.                                                                                    52.

                          (a beat, busted)
                    They weren t supposed to go up  til 
                    I talked to you.

                                  WALT
                    You really think you re the man for 
                    this job, Branch?

                                  BRANCH
                    I ll leave that up to the people. 
                    But given a choice between some 
                    fresh thinking, and a tired, 
                    absentee sheriff driving around 
                    with Budweiser cans all over the 
                    floor of his truck, I like my odds.
                          (off Walt s stare)
                    I heard about your little accident.

      Walt stands. Goes to his bookshelf. Looks. As he does...

                                  WALT
                    I m sorry I embarrassed you back 
                    there, Branch. But before you go 
                    spreading any accusations, consider 
                    this. Every man that s ever had a 
                    beer with me will tell you the same 
                    thing. I drink Rainier. Always 
                    have. Always will. Those Bud cans? 
                    I picked em up cause I hate looking 
                    at litter. Everyone knows that too.

      A PO d Branch looks at the book. But before he can respond--

                                  SUSAN
                    Excuse me?

      The widow, Susan Parkford, stands in the doorway. Off Walt s 
      surprised look...

                                  SUSAN (CONT D)
                    Am I interrupting? I m sorry. You 
                    told me to come down and, um --

                                  WALT
                    Oh yes, I m sorry, official ID, 
                    yes. Please sit down.                                                                                    53.


      Branch sets the Holmes book down on Walt s desk and leaves, 
      forces a smile to Susan as he goes. Looks genuine.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Can I get you something? Coffee?

                                  SUSAN
                    No, thank you. I just want to see 
                    the body.

                                  WALT
                    Yes, of course. But I also need to 
                      apologize.

                                  SUSAN
                    For what?

                                  WALT
                          (shuts the door)
                    For the other day...I know what 
                    it s like to lose someone...this is 
                    the one year anniversary of my own 
                    wife s passing. The day I visited 
                    you. I tried to put that out of my 
                    mind, but then you opened the 
                      door...and I smelled perfume. 
                          (off her confused look)
                    Jo Malone?
                          (she nods, that s right)
                    That s what my wife wore. Anyway, I 
                    only hope I didn t make the 
                    situation worse.

                                  SUSAN
                          (getting the apology)
                    It couldn t be any worse...I have 
                    no idea what my husband was doing 
                    in the middle of nowhere. I don t 
                      know...anything about why he s 
                    dead. Is there anybody who saw him 
                    before he died? Anything to help me 
                      understand what happened?
                          (summons the courage)
                    Was he having an affair? I can take 
                    it. Knowing is better than not 
                    knowing, please...

                                  WALT
                    He wasn t having an affair. But I 
                      discovered something else. Your 
                    husband, long before he met you. Or 
                    even knew you. He had a daughter. 
                    She s gone missing and Grant was 
                    trying to help find her.                                                                                    54.


                                  SUSAN
                      A daughter? Grant had a daughter?

                                  WALT
                    Your husband was just a man. And 
                    we re all idiots. We make mistakes, 
                    and we don t like people knowing 
                    about our mistakes. But Grant was 
                    one of the good ones. He was trying 
                    to make it right. And he was trying 
                    to do it without hurting you.

      Susan tries to process all this. Her head is spinning.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Mrs. Parkford, I swear, I m gonna 
                    find out who did this to your 
                    husband.

      Susan nods, absently, then turns to Walt.

                                  SUSAN
                    Does it ever stop hurting? 

      Without realizing it, Walt s hands have found the wooden tea 
      box that Cady brought in. The one with his wife s ashes.

                                  WALT
                    Not really. I guess the only way it 
                    could stop hurting is if you could 
                    forget about  em. And that s the 
                    rub.  Cause I don t want to forget 
                      anything...

      EXT. DURANT RV PARK - LATER

      Walt carries a LARGE BROWN BAG under his arm as he walks 
      along a row of RVs. He stops at one and knocks on the door. 
      It opens to reveal... Bob Barnes. Bob looks like shit. 

                                  WALT
                    Hey, Bob, a couple questions I 
                    forgot to ask you the other day. I 
                    don t like to forget anything. Can 
                    I come in? Billy around?

                                  BOB
                    He s at work...Walt, I don t know 
                    if this is really a good time--

      Walt reveals the SIX PACK OF RAINIER in the bag. Bob smiles.                                                                                    55.


      INT. BOB BARNES  RV - LATER

      Bob and Walt are LAUGHING. Bob much more than Walt. The 
      Rainiers have had their effect.

                                  WALT
                          (as the laughter dies)
                    So Bob...you and your son. You 
                    weren t going hunting the other 
                    day, were you?
                          (Walt dead serious)
                    I know about the mobile brothel 
                    that was parked out there. 

                                  BOB
                    What are you--

                                  WALT
                    Bob. There s no crime in being an 
                    idiot. But lying about it can be a 
                    problem.

                                  BOB
                    Okay, okay, we really intended to 
                    go hunting, but when we saw the RV 
                    we changed our plans...We came back 
                    to town, got some booze and hit the 
                    ATM, then went out to spend a 
                    little time with the ladies.

                                  WALT
                    How did you know just from looking 
                    at the RV that it was a brothel?

                                  BOB
                    Cause we know that RV. Got a big 
                    ol  green stripe across the side. 
                    And when it s not out working, it s 
                    parked here.

                                  WALT
                    Who owns it?

                                  BOB
                    I don t know.
                          (Walt s stare, c mon now)
                    Cheyenne kid. Name s Avo. 

                                  WALT
                    Can you show me where Avo s parked?

                                  BOB
                    Nah. He hasn t been here for a 
                    couple days.                                                                                    56.


                                  WALT
                    Any idea where I might find him?

                                  BOB
                    He s usually working. He s a busboy 
                    at the Red Pony. 

      Off Walt...shit. The Indian at the Red Pony. 

      INT. RED PONY - LATER

      Walt enters, in a hurry, right up to the female BARTENDER.

                                  WALT
                    Henry around?

                                  BARTENDER
                    Nope. Took off a few hours ago.

                                  WALT
                    What about Avo? The busboy.

                                  BARTENDER
                    Called in sick last few days.

                                  WALT
                    Can I borrow your phone?

      Bartender hands him his cell. Walt dials. A beat.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    Vic. Call the highway patrol, set 
                    up some road blocks. We re looking 
                    for an RV and a 21 year-old 
                    Cheyenne named Avo.

      EXT. WYOMING - DUSK

      One tiny ribbon of highway. On the shoulder, the flashing 
      blue light of a Sheriff s vehicle. We go in closer and find..

      Walt inside, his eyes on a pair of approaching headlights 
      heading his way...They get there, and it s--

                                  HENRY
                    Wow. A road block. This seems like 
                    overkill. You could have just 
                    called to apologize.

                                  WALT
                    Hello Henry.                                                                                    57.


                                  HENRY
                    I have a name for you, plus three 
                    other matters.

                                  WALT
                    Is the name Avo?

                                  HENRY
                    The other Indian at the Red Pony.

                                  WALT
                          (nods)
                    Avo s the owner of the RV that 
                    these girls have been working out 
                    of. What re the three other things?

                                  HENRY
                    First, while I could not find Avo 
                    myself, we spoke through a cousin. 
                    Avo will meet you tomorrow morning. 
                    11 am. There is an old empty cabin 
                    about three miles off the highway 
                    near the south entrance of the Rez. 
                          (Walt nods)
                    Second: I do not think you should 
                    go. It sounds like a set-up. And 
                    there s already one dead white guy--

                                  WALT
                    --What s number three?

                                  HENRY
                    Since you will no doubt ignore me 
                    and go meet Avo anyway, I would 
                    like to propose an O.I.T.

                                  WALT
                    O.I.T.?

                                  HENRY
                    Old Indian Trick.

      Off Walt getting Henry s plan--


                                  END OF ACT FOUR                                                                                    58.


                                        ACT FIVE

      EXT. OLD BEECHAM TRAIL - MORNING

      Empty. Looks like no one s been here since 1874. A jeep pulls 
      up. The door opens. A boot hits the ground. Round toe, but we 
      WIDEN to reveal it s not Walt, but a young Cheyenne male. The 
      BUSBOY FROM THE RED PONY: AVO.

      Avo quickly moves toward the shed. Checks over his shoulder--

      INT. OLD BEECHAM TRAIL SHED - CONTINUOUS

      Avo enters, shuts the door fast, and turns to find: Walt. 

      Walt sits atop his sleeping bag, calm as can be, pointing a 
      gun straight at Avo. Avo freezes.

                                  AVO
                    You re early.

                                  WALT
                    Old Indian Trick, Avo. Surprise is 
                      a powerful weapon. Speaking of 
                    which, would you mind telling me 
                    why you came 3 hours early to your 
                    own meeting? And if you can tell 
                    me, unarmed, I d appreciate that.

      Avo slowly pulls out the revolver tucked in the small of his 
      back. Sets it down.

                                  AVO
                      Sheriff...I didn t kill that guy. 
                    You gotta help me.

                                  WALT
                    To protect and serve. Now, sit. 
                    Let s talk. 

      Nervously, Avo sits. Walt continues to point the gun at him.

                                  AVO
                    The dead guy...I met him. A couple 
                    times. He came into the Red Pony. 
                    Two weeks ago. Real intense. Said 
                    he was looking to get laid. 

                                  WALT
                    And everyone knows if you want to 
                    get laid, you talk to the Indian at 
                    the Red Pony. What d you do?                                                                                    59.


                                  AVO
                    I sent him to the girls. That was a 
                      mistake...I heard later he freaked 
                    out when he got to the RV. 
                      Yelling...waving a gun around. So 
                    when he came back the other night, 
                    I was like  no way, man.  

                                  WALT
                    He came back after causing a scene 
                    like that?

                                  AVO
                    He apologized and said he was upset 
                    the first time cause what he was 
                    really looking for was an Indian 
                    girl. Guess that s his thing. 
                    Wanted to poke a Pocahantas. 
                    Anyway, I didn t want this crazy 
                    guy having a problem with me, so I 
                    told him where to go, but right 
                    away I called it in. I said  look 
                    out, crazy man s coming. Better 
                    move the RV.  I didn t know he was 
                    gonna kill him. I swear.

                                  WALT
                    Who is  he ?
                          (off Avo s silence)
                    Avo, whoever  he  is is trying to 
                    frame you. Now I know you can t 
                    afford an RV. I know you re not 
                    running a prostitution ring. And 
                    Henry tells me you re no killer. 
                    But you re in this deep now, and 
                    the only way I can protect you is 
                    if you tell me who you re working 
                    for.

                                  AVO
                    I don t know, man. I...

      SFX: BANG!

      AVO S BLOOD SPRAYS ON WALT S FACE -- as the echo of a rifle 
      shot fills the air. Avo crumbles to the floor, a small 
      explosion through his abdomen and jacket. 

      Walt is stunned for a beat, then adrenaline and instinct take 
      over...Walt scrambles to the window...peeks up at the high 
      ground of the hill...a black puff of rifle smoke 75 yards 
      away. A figure steps through the black smoke. We can t see 
      the face, but the man is holding a rifle with a large scope 
      on it. Reloading. Moving in. Awwwwww shit.                                                                                    60.


      Walt moves over to the bleeding, dying Avo.

                                  AVO (CONT D)
                    I m sorry. I m so sorry.

                                  WALT
                    Who s out there? Who is it?

                                  AVO
                    I m so sorry. 

      Avo ain t going to make it. And just stares dead at Walt.

      Walt scrambles to the door. He reaches for the handle...

      POV: THROUGH THE RIFLE SCOPE, looking back at the shed. We 
      see the door open, and a form starts to emerge...

      BANG! A splintering of wood on the shed s door jamb...

      EXT. SHED/CAMPGROUND - CONTINUOUS

      ...and Walt dashes from the shed, counting as he runs. 

                                  WALT
                          (to himself)
                    1 2 3 4 5 -- 

      Walt hits the dirt feeling the sharp pain of all his 
        injuries...BANG! A shot flies overhead. Walt leaps back to 
      his feet and runs.

                                  WALT (CONT D)
                    1 2 3 4 5 --

      At the last second he hits the dirt and rolls. Disappearing 
      into a thick wooded patch. Several moments of stillness and 
      silence are then interrupted by...AN ENGINE ROAR. Walt s 
      Bronco LAUNCHES out of the woods, and up the hill straight 
      for the shooter. 

      BANG! The shooter fires -- puts a hole in the windshield. 

      Walt s POV as he rips up the hill in his beat up Bronco with 
      his beat up hand. In the distance the shooter runs, 
      disappears over the ridge. Walt punches it...

      ANGLE ON the shooter s boots. Almost to his own ESCALADE.

      BACK ON Walt. The Bronco slams to a stop at the high ground 
      where the shooter once stood...Walt sees the shooter 50 yards 
      down the hill, getting into the truck. He s getting away.                                                                                     61.


      Faster than we ve ever seen him move, Walt gets out of his 
      Bronco, leaves the door wide open and the door window down. 
      Hurt hand and all, Walt grabs his rifle off the rack. Sticks 
      the open-sight Winchester .30-.30 through the window and 
      rests the body of the gun on the sill to take the pressure 
      off his injured right wrist. Walt aims at the moving 
      Escalade...And fires. Left handed.

      Bang! The bullet finds the target. Blood sprays on the window 
      in the shooter s Escalade. It rolls eerily to a stop.

      EXT. HILLSIDE - SECONDS LATER

      Walt approaches the shooter s truck on foot. He looks in at a 
      man s body, slumped against the center armrest. The shooter 
      still tries to get his barrel pointed at Walt, but can t. He 
      fires in vain. Bang! Walt doesn t blink, just moves in closer 
      and closer, gun drawn, looks inside and this time he 
      recognizes the face--Dave Estes.

      Dave is in pain, the bullet went through his shoulder into 
      his ribs. Short of breath. Panic in his voice.

                                  DAVE
                    You weren t supposed to be here.

                                  WALT
                    Doing my job, Dave.

                                  DAVE
                          (coughs up some blood)
                    Walt, you gotta help me, Walt? 
                    Please help me? Call an ambulance. 

                                  WALT
                    After you tell me about Grant 
                    Parkford.

                                  DAVE
                    Who?

                                  WALT
                    I m a patient man.

                                  DAVE
                    ...I was just trying to make a 
                      living...And he was bad for 
                    business. I warned him. I did. I 
                    swear. Now call an ambulance!

                                  WALT
                    And Lilly, Grant s daughter. Tell 
                    me where Lilly is. If not, I bury 
                    you here.                                                                                    62.


                                  DAVE
                    Okay, okay...Montana...Talmer 
                    Ridge, off Route 43 --

      Walt turns, starts to walk away...

                                  DAVE (CONT D)
                    Where are you going?! Walt, you 
                    have to call an ambulance!

                                  WALT
                          (stops, turns to Dave)
                    I don t have a cellphone.

      And we watch Walt walk back toward Bullet, Dave SCREAMS for 
      help and mercy, we flash forward to...

      EXT. TALMER RIDGE - LATER

      MONTANA HIGHWAY PATROL VEHICLES pull up to the RV. Vic and a 
      bunch of MONTANA TROOPERS pile out, guns drawn. The Big Guy 
      Helper from Dave Estes  shop is behind the wheel of the RV, 
      hands on his head.

      CUT BACK TO WALT, WALKING UP TO HIS BRONCO. THEN FORWARD TO:

      INT. THE RV - SECONDS LATER

      Vic goes inside and finds Lilly. We don t hear the words, but 
      we can see that Lilly is scared, and Vic says something to 
      comfort her and calm her.

      CUT BACK TO WALT, CLIMBING INTO HIS TRUCK...THEN FORWARD TO:

      EXT. THE REZ - LATER

      A deputy vehicle drives up to the entrance. Henry waits, 
      along with Mathias and Lynn Stillwater. Vic gets out of the 
      passenger side.  

      CUT BACK TO WALT, PICKING UP HIS RADIO. 

                                  WALT
                          (looking back to Dave)
                    Ruby? This is Unit One. I m gonna 
                    need an ambulance.

      Off Walt, staring back at Estes  truck...we FLASH FORWARD to:

      EXT. THE REZ - LATER

      Walt gets out of the driver side, opens the back passenger 
      door, and helps Lilly out. Slowly, he leads her over to the 
      waiting group: Henry, Lynn, Mathias.                                                                                    63.


      Lilly looks at her Mom, in shame, and in shock. Lynn hugs her 
      daughter. It is an awkward reunion. Walt nods to Lynn and 
      then to Mathias. Mathias looks back. After a beat, he nods in 
      return. Not peace, to be sure, but a moment of detente. PRE-
      LAP SFX: THUMP! THUMP!

      EXT. WYOMING - SUNSET

      Cut to: A HAMMER HITTING THE TOP OF A WOODEN STAKE. THUMP! 
      THUMP! Walt HAMMERS the wooden stake into the ground just off 
      the shoulder of the road. Walt s Bronco right behind him.

      An 18-WHEELER roars by Walt without slowing down. Walt 
      doesn t flinch. Just HAMMERS away. We now see that the stake 
      is connected to a horizontal stake, like a cross...Walt looks 
      at it for a moment. Then bends down, picks something up with 
      one hand, and pulls out a gun: A STAPLE GUN.

        CHINK-CHINK-CHINK. Walt staples A SIGN to the cross. It is a 
      dated typeface and a bit faded in color. But you can still 
      read the sign: HONESTY AND INTEGRITY. LONGMIRE FOR SHERIFF.

      Walt Looks across the road at the wind shaking Branch 
      Connally s sign. Off Walt s satisfied look--

      INT. WALT S BRONCO - MOMENTS LATER

      Walt gets in, puts the staple gun down right next to -- The 
      tea box from earlier. Walt looks down at the box. Election 
      signs and wooden stakes on the floor.

                                  WALT
                    Well, honey. I ve let a lot of lot 
                    of things slide...and I don t know 
                    if it s too late to make up for it. 
                    But looks like we re running again.

      And as Walt pulls away, the Elk pay no attention to the man 
      speeding down the wide open road, across the Wyoming horizon.
