      FADE IN:

      BLACK SCREEN.  Gradually getting lighter during:

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Sadness and hope.  You must hear it
                    all day long -- one more story of a
                    daughter, struck down at the peak of
                    her life.  How can you still be moved?

      The room comes into focus as it brightens.  From SOMEONE'S
      P.O.V., we see a ceiling, and a fluorescent light fixture.

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                    Just crossing the street, and BAM! 
                      Hit-and-run driver.  Never looked
                    back.  That's the sadness part.  The
                    hope?  Well, that's where you come
                    in -- the good people at Extreme
                    Makeover: Home Edition.  ...Howard,
                    turn that TV down, or I swear to God
                    you'll never leave this hospital.

11INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - THROUGH A VIDEO CAMERA

      We see HOWARD NEWLY, 60s, watching a hospital-room TV.  The
      unseen WOMAN TALKING is videotaping.

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Her grieving father.

                                      HOWARD
                    Guy on here says he has a chicken,
                    can lay six eggs in a day.

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE
                    No one cares, Howard.

      As we PAN THE HOSPITAL ROOM...

                                      WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                    This is our Samantha's world.  Day
                    and night... hooked to machines...
                    in a coma from which her doctors
                    doubt she will ever emerge.

      The SHOT finds SAMANTHA NEWLY, 30s, in bed -- eyes open.

      WIDER ANGLE - REGINA NEWLY, 60s.  She lowers the camera.

                                      REGINA
                    Well, that won't work.  Howard, she
                    woke up!  Go get the doctor.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                        2.

                                      REGINA (CONT'D)
                          (to Samantha)
                    And sweetheart, close your eyes again
                    so I can do that last shot over.

      Samantha, who's been looking blankly at these people -- maybe
      it's a dream? -- works her mouth, puckering her lips...

                                      HOWARD
                    Wait, she's trying to say something!

                                      REGINA
                    She's making a kiss.  She wants to
                    kiss us.  Do you want a kiss, dear? 
                    Yes, we're so happy, we love you too!

      Samantha's lips work, Regina leans close and is just about
      to kiss her daughter, when Samantha finally whispers:

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Who are you?

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

                      Retro-what?

22INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

      Samantha sees good-looking DR. KERRY HALL, Regina, Howard,
      and a nice, mousy young woman, DENA, all leaning over her.

                                    DR. HALL
                      Retrograde amnesia.  The accident
                    left her semantic memory intact --
                    that's skills, knowledge of things
                    in general -- but knocked out her
                      autobiographical memory -- all
                    personal facts and experiences.

                                      REGINA
                    It's your MOTHER, dear, REMEMBER?

                                      HOWARD
                    She doesn't know you, Regina.

                                      REGINA
                          (dismissive wave)
                    I'm used to this, she's been pretending
                    to not know me since she was nine.

                                      HOWARD
                    Samantha?  I'm your father, and this
                    is your friend Diane.                                                                                        3.

                                    DENA
                    Dena.

                                      HOWARD
                    She came every day you were out.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    How long?

                                      HOWARD
                    Nineteen years.

      Samantha's eyes shoot wide.

                                      REGINA
                    Eight days.  He's kidding.  Howard,
                    honestly.

                                    DR. HALL
                    Yes, please.  Until she gets her
                    memories back -- if they even do
                    come back -- Samantha has no frame
                    of reference, she can't recall
                    anything about her life up to this
                    point.  Not her friends, her address,
                    not her high school prom, not her
                    eighth birthday party.

                                      REGINA
                          (getting teary)
                    That's so awful.  I worked my fingers
                    to the bone on that party!

                                    DR. HALL
                    Ms. Newly, your daughter has had a
                    severe trauma.  Imagine waking up
                    erased.  Starting over -- every
                      experience, every memory, every single
                    thing that's ever added up to make
                    you you, is just gone.

                                    DENA
                          (blurting)
                    Oh my god that sounds great!
                          (beat; off their looks)
                    I mean bad.

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

                                      SAMANTHA (PRE-LAP)
                    I wanna mirror.

33INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

      Regina, Howard and Samantha, who's stronger and eats pudding.                                                                                        4.

                                      REGINA
                    What, dear?  Juan Amir?  Who's Juan
                    Amir?  Miro?  Joan Miro?  Chairman
                    Mao?  Myrrh?  More?  Morrie someone? 
                    Amor ?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    A mirror.  I don't even know what I
                    look like.

                                      REGINA
                          (whispers to Howard)
                    Do they let crazy people have mirrors?

      Howard hands Samantha a beauty-shop hand-mirror.  Samantha
      peers at herself, looking for clues from the stranger there.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Nothing.  Might as well be a picture
                    of Jesus on a paper fan.

                                      REGINA
                    Jesus she remembers, but her own
                    mother, nothing.  Did Jesus go through
                    twenty hours of labor?  Did Jesus
                    ever change her diaper?

                                      HOWARD
                    She wouldn't remember you changing
                    her diaper anyway, Regina.

                                      REGINA
                    It was today.  The nurse was late.

      Samantha decides not to react to that.  She closes her eyes.

                                      HOWARD
                    We should let her rest.

                                      REGINA
                    She just had an eight-day nap.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (eyes closed)
                    Oh -- and that thing they say about
                    comas is true.  Sometimes when you're
                    out, you can hear what people say.

                                      REGINA
                    You can?

      She shoots Howard an apprehensive look. 

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Yeah, and tell the family of whoever's
                    in that next bed.  People don't seem
                    to like that poor girl at all.                                                                                        5.

      The CAMERA SLIDES OVER to REVEAL that beyond the curtain
      there is no bed.  No one in this room but Samantha.

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK:

      IN BLACK:

                                      REGINA (PRE-LAP)
                    Go on, kiss him.

44INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYS LATER

      Samantha on the edge of the bed, dressed, feeling much better
      (physically).  She looks anxiously from Regina and Howard to
      TODD -- boyfriend, a nice-looking, regular guy.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    But I don't know him.

                                      REGINA
                    You have to go home with someone,
                    dear, it's time.  The doctor said
                      recovering your memories begins by
                      surrounding yourself with familiar
                    things.

                                    TODD
                    And your stuff, your whole life, is
                    at our place.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    So I go with this man, alone, who I
                    don't know at all... or with the people
                    who raised me my whole life.
                          (beat)
                    Wow.  That should be an easier choice.

                                      REGINA
                    So kiss him.  Maybe it'll trigger
                      something.  Like Sleeping Beauty.

                                      HOWARD
                          (to Regina)
                    Remember that movie we saw on Starz,
                      "Brimstone and Treacle?"  This couple
                    had a daughter, mute, pretty much a
                      vegetable, and then this man shows
                    up... the rock star, what's his name?

                                      REGINA
                    Elton John?

                                      HOWARD
                    No, with that group.

                                      REGINA
                    The Beatles?                                                                                        6.

                                      HOWARD
                    The Firemen, the Policemen...

                                    TODD
                    The Police?

                                      HOWARD
                    That's right.

                                    TODD
                    Sting?

                                      HOWARD
                    Yes!  And he rapes her.

      Silence.  They all stare at him in disbelief.

                                      HOWARD (CONT'D)
                    Snapped her right out of it.

                                      REGINA
                    Just kiss him, sweetie.  Love knows.

      Samantha looks at Todd... puckers up reluctantly... and Todd
      moves in gently for a kiss.  But the closer he inches, the
      more she edges her lips away... then twists them away...
      turns her head... then she's holding him back with one arm
      as he strains closer...  Finally:

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Okay, it's too weird!  I'm sorry.

55INT. SAMANTHA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

      The room is homey, long-lived-in.  A banner is up: "Welcome
      Home Samantha."  Samantha's just arrived, and takes in the
      unusual number of chicken-themed items: art, lamps, a jar...

                                      REGINA
                    So this is where you grew up.  Getting
                    anything?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Just that someone likes chickens.

                                      HOWARD
                    Chickens built this house.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Wow.  That's a memory I wish I had.

                                      REGINA
                    Your dad's a chicken farmer.

                                      HOWARD
                    Was.  Sold out to Zacky.  Biggest
                    mistake I ever made.                                                                                        7.

                                      REGINA
                    Not by far, dear.

      As Howard takes Samantha's suitcase upstairs, Samantha spots
      an old upright piano.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Oh, hey, let's see if I can play.

      She sits, starts to PLAY -- pounding out a two-handed
      CACOPHONY before Regina stops her with a hand on Sam's.

                                      REGINA
                    Some things you can just ask.

      From the the kitchen comes Samantha's friend ANGELA, a sexy
      attorney and party girl, brash but fun.  She drinks champagne.

                                      ANGELA
                          (hugs Samantha)
                    There she is...!  You poor dear,
                    your mother told me all about it.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (uncomfortable in hug)
                    So then you realize I have no idea
                    who you are.

                                      ANGELA
                    I'm Angela, your best friend in the
                    world.  I'm sorry I didn't visit, I
                    just hate hospitals.  All those nurses
                    in their cheap, squeaky shoes.  So
                    what is it you have?  Retro-what?

                                      SAMANTHA
                      Retrograde amnesia.  You can't
                    remember things you've done, who
                    you've met, where you live...

                                      ANGELA
                    That's nothing, I have that every
                    Monday morning.
                          (hands her a cell phone)
                    Here's a new phone, I heard you've
                    been without one since the accident. 
                    Forget that guy who sawed his own
                    arm off, you are a survivor.
                          (to Regina, re champagne)
                    Mrs. Newly, any chance I can have a
                    teensy little top-off...?

      Regina exits to the kitchen.  The second she's out:

                                      ANGELA (CONT'D)
                    My car's pointed down the driveway,
                    let's go.                                                                                        8.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Wait, why?  This place is kind of
                    cute, and the people seem harmless.

                                      ANGELA
                    So is the Small World ride.  Fun for
                    a minute, but if you had to live
                    there you'd blow your head off. 

                                      SAMANTHA
                    What's the problem?  Do we fight? 

                                      ANGELA
                    Of course not. 

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Good.

                                      ANGELA
                    How can you, you haven't spoken to
                    them for two years.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    What? 

      Regina enters, hands Angela a full champagne flute.

                                      REGINA
                    Here you are, Angela.  Be sure to
                    switch drinking arms, you don't want
                    to bulk up on one side.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    We didn't speak for two years?

                                      REGINA
                    Yes, we did.  Who told you that? 
                    Her?  Don't listen to her, she's
                    drunk.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    I don't think so.

                                      ANGELA
                    Little bit, yeah.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    What happened?  Was there a fight?

                                      REGINA
                    I don't recall.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    How can you not recall?

                                      REGINA
                    How can you not?                                                                                        9.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    I have amnesia.  You're just lying.

                                      REGINA
                    Well, why dwell on things?  You don't
                    remember anyway, let's skip all that
                    and say it never happened.  

                                      SAMANTHA
                    No, this is my life, I need answers. 
                      Especially about my family -- this
                    is where I came from.  You made me
                    who I am.

                                      REGINA
                          (bursts into tears)
                    That's a horrible thing to say! 

      The DOORBELL RINGS, Howard comes downstairs to answer it. 

                                      REGINA (CONT'D)
                    It's the meanest thing you've ever
                    said, and that is quite a feat.

                                      HOWARD
                    Apologize to your mother, young lady. 

                                      ANGELA
                          (looking out window)
                    Oh look, I left my car running.

      Howard OPENS THE DOOR to a good-looking, rugged sort of man
      in a rumpled suit: POLK.

                                      HOWARD
                    Hey, look who's here!  Come say hi,
                    Sammy -- it's your brother Ned, come
                    all this way just to see you.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Oh.  Well... hi, Ned.

      She goes for it, giving the guy a huge hug.

                                      HOWARD
                    Kidding.  He's a cop.

        Exasperated, Samantha lets go quickly.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Detective Polk, ma'am.  I'm the one
                      investigating your attempted murder?

      Sam stares at him a beat, then smiles politely.                                                                                       10.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Would you excuse me?
                          (turns on parents)
                    This is what I'm talking about!  You
                    can't just reassemble me from pieces
                    you choose, I need to know it all. 
                    Like the fact that I was almost
                    murdered, I have to think that's a
                    handy piece to have!

                                      REGINA
                    But you weren't murdered. 
                          (shrugs)
                    Why dwell?

      Samantha sags, knowing this won't work.  Angela mouths, "Run."

66INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - EVENING

      Samantha, suitcase beside her, pounds on an apartment door. 
      The door opens, and a guy, DAVE, who looks sort of like Todd
      if you've only seen Todd once, answers.  In a rush --

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Okay I'll live with you but in a
                    separate room or on the couch I am
                    not having sex with you yet so get
                    that right out of your head, mister.

                                      DAVE'S WIFE (O.S.)
                    Dave?  Who is that?

                                    DAVE
                    No idea.

      Down the hall, a door opens, and Todd leans out.

                                    TODD
                    Sam?  It's this one.

        Embarrassed, Samantha grabs her suitcase.  As she scurries
      to the right apartment and Dave closes his door, we hear...

                                      DAVE'S WIFE (O.S.)
                    You have no idea, but she'll have sex
                    with you?

                                    DAVE (O.S.)
                    Not have sex, Margaret.  Guess lots
                    of women don't want to have sex with
                    me, you're not the only one!

      As the couple fight...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                      END OF ACT ONE                                                                                      11.

                                          ACT TWO

      FADE IN:

77INT. SAMANTHA AND TODD'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

      Samantha examines everything, eagerly writing in a notebook. 
      Todd is in the kitchen.  There are many photos in frames.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Pictures of Samantha... wow, even
                    more pictures of Samantha.
                          (writing)
                    "Subject enjoys... charmingly high... 
                      self-esteem."

                                    TODD (O.S.)
                    Subject?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Yeah.  If I want to find me again, I
                    need to treat me like a missing person --
                    hopefully one who's just wandered off
                    without saying where she's going, and
                    not one who's already dead in the
                    back of some psycho's van. 

      Todd enters with a cappuccino, sees her peering at a PHOTO --
      IN IT she's smiling sardonically, giving him the finger.

                                    TODD
                    I took that one when we first met.
                          (points at another photo)
                    Took that one is the first morning
                    you stayed over.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    You make me look so good.  Wait, are
                    you a professional?  Oh thank god --
                    I'm not hopelessly vain, I'm just
                      supportive of your work.

                                    TODD
                          (teasing)
                    Why does it have to be either-or?
                          (hands her cappuccino)
                    Here.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Thank you.  What's this for?

                                    TODD
                    You like a cappuccino at night, decaf,
                      one-percent milk only.  Write that
                    down, detective.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      12.

                                    TODD (CONT'D)
                    I used two-percent once, and you
                    accused me of fattening you up like a
                    Christmas ham so no other man would
                    ever want you, and you suggested I
                    seek help for my insecurity.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (embarrassed; lightly)
                    That Samantha.  What a nut!

      She exits to the bathroom.

88INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Samantha starts going through the medicine cabinet, noting
      medicines, opening makeup and jars, smelling things.  Todd
      appears in the doorway, watching. 

                                    TODD
                    So what's it like?  Amnesia?

      Pause.  Samantha thinks.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Like traveling all alone in a foreign
                    country.  But one where they speak
                    English.

                                    TODD
                    Like Canada.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Yes.  I'd say it's very much like
                    being in Canada.

      She exits to the bedroom.

99INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

      She scans the shelves of books.  Todd enters.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Books strictly organized... fiction...
                    something called "The DaVinci Code" --
                    guess I'm quite the intellectual...  
                      psychology... more psychology... wow,
                    I am really into psychology.

                                    TODD
                    I hope so.  You're a psychologist.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    No way -- Doctor Me!  That's handy, I
                    should sit down with myself sometime.                                                                                      13.

                                    TODD
                    There are patient files on the desk.
                          (as she looks at them)
                    It's how you met Angela.  She's a
                    lawyer who gets rich people off so
                    they can commit more crimes.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (hopeful)
                    And... I'm the do-gooder partner who
                    makes her see the error of her ways?

                                    TODD
                    No, you consult for a cut of the
                    take.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    I see.
                          (off notebook)
                    So let's review: subject is a self-
                    involved, irrational, morally suspect
                    control freak who by the way someone
                    hates enough to try to kill. 
                          (beat)
                    Tell me again why we're looking for
                    this woman?

                                    TODD
                    Clean up the streets?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Tell me about it.

      Todd takes her notebook. 

                                    TODD
                    Okay, you either knock off the CSI
                    stuff or get a bigger notebook. 
                          (flips through book)
                    There are key facts missing from
                    here -- like her blinding attraction
                    to me, I think that's quite pertinent
                      information.  And her fierce, dogged
                      determination to finish the Sudoku
                    every day, even if it's "diabolical." 
                    And how she'll break into a dance
                    just walking down the sidewalk.  And
                    only eats cereal standing up... always
                    sneezes three times in a row... and
                    how her face softens like a cloud
                    when she finally unclenches her jaw.

      They have a moment of connection.  Todd clearly loves her. 
      Samantha smiles, but looks away shyly.  Then THE PHONE RINGS. 
      Samantha gets excited.                                                                                      14.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Oooh!  Oooh!  Maybe it's someone.

                                    TODD
                    Why, I bet it is.

      Samantha grabs the phone.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Hello?

                                                                                INTERCUT:

1010INT. BISTRO 99 RESTAURANT/BAR - CONTINUOUS

      A party is going on; Angela talks to Samantha on her cell,
      while drinking a dirty martini and eating the olives.

                                      ANGELA
                    Where are you?  Ren 's birthday party
                    is tonight, you said you'd come.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Um, Angela?  You know how we talked
                    about my complete memory loss?

                                      ANGELA
                    Oh, right.  Well, everyone's here,
                    just get down to Bistro 99.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Okay.  But do me a favor, don't tell
                    anyone what happened.

                                      ANGELA
                    What happened with what?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Never mind.  See you.
                          (hangs up; to Todd)
                    It's Renee's birthday, she's having
                    a party, we have to go see Renee!

                                    TODD
                    Okay.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Who's Renee?

                                    TODD
                      A colleague, I don't know her.  You
                    met her at a conference in Baltimore,
                    you run into her at work things.                                                                                      15.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Well apparently "everyone" is there,
                    it's a chance to observe Samantha in
                    her natural environment.  You can
                    help me navigate, and I'll get Dena
                    to come, too.  Let's get ready.

      She goes into the closet to find clothes.

                                    TODD
                    Why can't people know what happened?

                                      SAMANTHA (O.S.)
                    So they treat me like they normally
                    would.  Recovering my memories depends
                    on exposure to familiar experiences.

                                    TODD
                    Then including me isn't one of them. 
                    You think I don't like your friends.

                                      SAMANTHA (O.S.)
                    Do you?

                                    TODD
                    No, I don't.

                                      SAMANTHA (O.S.)
                    Well, you have to go.  It's a
                    birthday, it'll be fun.

                                    TODD
                    Even though you regard birthdays as
                    childish ploys for harvesting
                    attention and gifts.

                                      SAMANTHA (O.S.)
                          (laughs)
                    God, when did I say that?

                                    TODD
                    When you forgot mine.

      Beat.  Samantha re-enters. 

                                      SAMANTHA
                      Seriously, what's wrong with you? 
                    All I can say is, this Samantha better
                    be damn good in bed.
                          (before he can speak)
                    Okay.  Awkward.  Sorry. 

      She exits to the closet.  Beat, then casually...

                                      SAMANTHA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    But for the record -- you know, for
                    my notes -- was it good?  Bad?                                                                                      16.

                                    TODD
                    I'm a guy, it can never be bad. 
                    Except maybe in prison, I guess.

      Samantha emerges with several dresses.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    So better than prison, then.  You
                    make a girl feel all goose-bumply. 
                          (then)
                    Oh my god!

      She holds up a tiny black dress.

                                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    I have a daughter?

                                    TODD
                    Uh, no.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (looks at dress)
                    Whoa.

1111EXT. BISTRO 99 - NIGHT

      Upscale, downtown.  Samantha and Todd are about to go in.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Wait, I left my notebook in the car. 
                    I need to get it.

                                    TODD
                    I'll get it.
                          (off her anxiety)
                    Just wait inside.  If anyone talks
                    to you, just nod and laugh like you
                    have any idea who they are.

      Todd exits.  Samantha is about to go in... when ACROSS THE
      STREET she spots a MAN IN A CREAM-COLORED OVERCOAT.  He seems
      to be watching her.  A flicker of something -- recognition? --
      crosses her face... then is gone.  She gives a noncommittal
      smile, then enters the restaurant.

1212INT. BISTRO 99 - CONTINUOUS

        Good-looking clientele, HIP MUSIC.  Samantha takes a breath
      and starts across the room, passing a WOMAN.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (smiling)
                    Hi!

                                      WOMAN
                          (scowling)
                    Hi?                                                                                      17.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (quickly adjusting)
                    Sorry?

                                      WOMAN
                    Sorry?  Little too late for that.

      The woman storms away.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Note to self, muffin basket there... 

      Suddenly a hot, sexy GUY pulls her into the coat room.

1313INT. COAT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      The sexy guy is very happy to see Samantha.

                                    SEXY GUY
                    You look too good tonight, I can't
                    stand it.  Tell me you dressed like
                    that for me.

      Samantha, startled, baffled, just nods and laughs like Todd
      said to.

                                    SEXY GUY (CONT'D)
                    Good.  I was afraid you wouldn't speak
                    to me.  I know I haven't called you
                    in a couple of weeks but I'll make it
                    up to you, I promise.  I'm sorry, and
                      I wouldn't blame you if you acted
                    like you didn't even know me.

      And he gives her a huge romantic kiss.  When they break, all
      she manages, stupidly now, is a nod and a laugh.  Then she
      bolts from the coat room.

1414INT. BISTRO 99 - CONTINUOUS

      Samantha, shaken, hurries across the room, bumps into Angela.

                                      ANGELA
                    You made it!  Here, have a drink.

      She gives Samantha her martini, Samantha downs it all, fast.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Okay, just now?  Some guy kissed me!

                                      ANGELA
                    How was it?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Well... great, actually, but --

      Dena comes up to them.                                                                                      18.

                                    DENA
                    Hi, I got here before you , I'm always
                    early.  I can't help it, I'm always
                    convinced the address is fake, or
                      everyone's watching me from a window
                    somewhere until I just leave.

                                      ANGELA
                          (to Samantha)
                    Patient of yours?  Because it's not
                    one of your success stories.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    This is my friend Dena.  Listen,
                    there was this guy --

                                      ANGELA
                          (suspicious of Dena)
                    Friend?  I don't think so.  From where?

                                    DENA
                    School?
                          (quickly, to Samantha)
                    So where's Todd tonight?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Getting something out of the car.

                                      ANGELA
                    What?  You brought Todd, are you nuts?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    You don't like Todd?  Because he said
                    he doesn't like my friends, either.

                                      ANGELA
                    Know who really won't like him?  Ren .

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Why won't Renee like him, Renee is --

                                      ANGELA
                    Your lover.

      Angela points to the Sexy Guy from the closet, who winks at
      Samantha from across the room.  Suddenly Samantha gets it.  

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Oh, Ren ...

      On Samantha's horror...

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                        ACT THREE

      FADE IN:

1515INT. BISTRO 99 - NIGHT

      Samantha Dena and Angela at a table, Samantha panicked, upset. 

                                    DENA
                          (slight awe)
                    Wow.  Two guys at one time.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    At least two!  The night is young.

                                      ANGELA
                    See?  How can she be your friend and
                    not even know about Ren ?

      Samantha sees Todd arrive, wave, and go to the coat room.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Oh, god, there he is.

                                      ANGELA
                    Why did you bring him here?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Oh, I thought my boyfriends might
                    like a playdate.  What do you mean,
                    why?  Why didn't you tell me?  I
                    have to get him out of here.

      She crosses away.  Angela stares hard at Dena, suspicious.

                                    DENA
                    What?

      OUTSIDE THE COAT ROOM, the ANGRY WOMAN from before is about
      to go in, when Samantha pushes past her and goes in first.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Sorry.  Again. 

1616INT. COAT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Todd hangs his coat up, starts to exit, when Samantha enters. 

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Todd, hi!  Ready to go?

                                    TODD
                    What?  We just got here.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    And you were sweet to bring me, but
                    you don't like my friends...                                                                                      20.

                                    TODD
                    So?  It's not about me. 

                                      SAMANTHA
                    I know, but... I need things to be
                    normal to see what is normal and you
                    being here is not normal, so Angela
                    can help me, you can go.  It's okay. 

                                    TODD
                          (wants to go)
                    I don't mind staying...

                                      SAMANTHA
                    I might not offer twice. 

                                    TODD
                          (grabs coat)
                    See you at home.

      Todd exits as fast as he can.  The ANGRY WOMAN tries to enter --

                                      WOMAN
                    I need my coat --

      But Angela pushes past her, crowding the woman out again and
      shoving Dena into the coat room ahead of her.

                                      ANGELA
                    Tell her.  Go ahead. 
                          (to Samantha)
                    I told you she's not your friend.

                                    DENA
                    I was... up until seventh grade,
                    anyway.  And then you got in with the
                    cool crowd and kind of never spoke to
                    me again, but when I heard what
                    happened to you I went to the hospital
                    and told your mom we'd stayed friends
                    and she was just so happy you had one
                    that I didn't want to break her heart.

                                      ANGELA
                          (to Samantha)
                    Want me to call the police?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Dena, how long were you going to let
                    me think we were best friends?

                                    DENA
                    I was hoping by the time you found
                    out, we would be.                                                                                      21.

                                      ANGELA
                    How about we call that cop who came
                    to your mom's house?  He was cute. 

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Wait, so besides Todd -- who I
                    betrayed -- I only have one friend?

                                      ANGELA
                          (smoothly reassuring)
                    But sweetheart, I'm the only friend
                    you need. 

                                    DENA
                    Okay, did anyone else just feel a
                    cold spot in the room?

      The ANGRY WOMAN finally pushes into the coat room.

                                      WOMAN
                    I need my coat, and I need it now.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (suddenly angry)
                    Okay, lady, I apologized once to
                    you, but bug me again and I'll have
                    something to really be sorry for!

      Beat.  Samantha is shocked to hear herself talk like that. 
      Angela gives her a big, tearful hug.

                                      ANGELA
                    My baby's still in there!

1717INT. BISTRO 99 - CONTINUOUS

      Samantha comes out of the coat room, upset, followed by Angela
      and Dena, and crosses back to their table to get her coat.

                                      ANGELA
                    Where are you going, you haven't
                    talked to Ren .

                                      SAMANTHA
                    I don't want to talk to Ren , I have
                      a boyfriend.

                                      ANGELA
                    Who you don't even know.  You can
                    start completely fresh, be with anyone
                    you want, why choose Todd again?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    I don't know.  So far, he's the person
                    who makes me feel the most like me. 
                    I like how he sees me.                                                                                      22.

                                      ANGELA
                    He sees you through a lens, captures
                    you, and puts you on a shelf.  Ren 
                    takes you down and plays with you. 
                    He's not afraid to get you dirty.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Okay, can we stop this metaphor?
                          (beat, intrigued)
                    How dirty?
                          (quickly)
                    Never mind.

                                      ANGELA
                    See?  You're drawn to him.  You wanted
                    to know who you are, I'm trying to
                    show you.

                                    DENA
                    Maybe she's not the same, now.  People
                    can change.

                                      ANGELA
                    No, my psycho friend, people can not
                    change.  That's just a giant myth
                      perpetuated by the multi-billion-
                    dollar self-help industry.

                                    DENA
                    And God.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    But what's the point of a fresh start
                    if I keep doing the same things?  I
                    need to do what's right for a change.

                                    DENA
                    Good for you!

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (beat)
                    So what is it?

                                    DENA
                    Break up with Ren .

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Right.  Of course.

                                    DENA
                    And tell Todd about him.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (anxious)
                    What?  Whoa.                                                                                       23.

                                      ANGELA
                    Okay, we're going to take you back
                    to the asylum now, sweetie, they'll
                    be worried about you.

      Ren  comes over.  He really is sexy, really does like Sam.

                                    REN 
                    Samantha, sorry to leave you so long.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Hi.  We're breaking up.  Happy
                    birthday, I got you some earrings.

      She pulls a small wrapped gift from her purse, spilling some
      purse things on the table.

                                    REN 
                    What?  No, please don't do this. 
                    I'm leaving Barbara for good, I am.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (sees his ring)
                    You're married?  This is the guy you
                    choose for me, Angela?  He's a
                    cheater!

                                      ANGELA
                    But so are you, sweetheart.  You're
                    perfect for each other. 

                                    REN 
                    Samantha, I love you.  Let's go to
                    Hawaii.  Tomorrow.  Tonight.  Let's
                    leave from here, we'll buy clothes
                    when we get there -- although I doubt
                    we'll need any.     

      He leans in close.  There's definitely a sexual thing,
      Samantha can't deny it.  

                                      SAMANTHA
                    How many times in a row do I sneeze?

                                    REN 
                    Sneeze?  I don't know.  Why, do you
                    have a cold?  Why didn't you tell me
                    before I kissed you, I have a tenure
                    meeting tomorrow.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (beat)
                    You're right, Angela.  We are perfect
                    for each other. 
                          (beat)
                    I just don't want to be.                                                                                      24.

      She sweeps stuff back into her purse... stops... and holds
      up a plastic chip, with writing on it.

                                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    "One Day at a Time."
                          (reads other side)
                    "Thirty Days."

      She looks at her empty martini glass, and at Angela, appalled.

                                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    Angela!

      Shaking her head, she exits.  Dena and Ren  look at Angela.  

                                      ANGELA
                    Worst thirty days of my life.

1818INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT

      An A.A. meeting.  Members in a circle.  One empty chair.

                                    ALL MEMBERS
                    Hi, Samantha...!

                                      LEADER
                    Samantha, you need to sit in the
                    circle.

      WIDER SHOT: Samantha is at a nearby table where coffee, cakes
      and muffins are set up.  She's on edge, trying to stay calm.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Sorry.  I didn't eat, I just want to
                    grab... something.  What?  Carrot
                    cake, that looks good.  Wait, do I
                    like carrot cake? 
                          (tastes a bite)
                    Blehh!  No.  Sorry, I'll get a muffin. 
                    What kind?  Banana?  No.  Yes! 
                    Banana.  I don't know.  Poppyseed? 
                    Is there citrus in that?  I don't
                    know why I'm asking.  Sorry.  I can
                    do this.  Raisin.  A raisin muffin,
                    that's my choice.  Wait.  Bran!  A
                    low-fat bran -- no, pumpkin!  A
                    pumpkin muffin!  Hey, what is that,
                    is that apple?  Yes!  That's the
                    one!  Apple!  Hey, are there donuts?

      Agitated, she turns and sees that everyone is staring at her
      like she's crazy -- some even a little scared.

                                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    What, you've never seen a girl pick
                    a snack?  Sure, it's easy for you.
                                      (MORE)                                                                                      25.

                                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    You can make choices.  Not good ones, 
                    that's obvious, but a muffin for
                    god's sake.  I don't know what I
                    like.  Or who I am.  Just today I've
                    learned that someone tried to kill
                    me and there's some huge rift with
                    parents I don't even know about and
                    I have one friend who's mean and one
                    who's not even a friend and I'm
                    cheating on my boyfriend -- who's
                    the one good thing in my life right
                    now -- and if I go home tonight and
                    do the "right" thing, I may even
                    lose that!  I may end up alone.  I
                    can't choose.  I'm stuck.

      Pause.

                                      FEMALE MEMBER
                    Try the lemon squares.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (intense)
                    Okay, but why? 
                          (bites a lemon square)
                    I mean yes, I eat the lemon square,
                    mmm, chew chew chew, does that make
                    me a lemon square person?  Or am I
                    actually a blueberry tart person --
                          (chomps a blueberry tart)
                    -- and no matter how much I want to
                    become a lemon square person, how
                    hard I try to lead a lemon square
                    life, am I destined by my very nature
                    to wake up day after day a freaking
                    BLUEBERRY TART??!

      She stops, blueberry on her mouth.  Beat. 

                                      LEADER
                    Okay, get out. 

      Samantha, embarrassed, slinks for the door.

                                      EVERYONE
                    'Bye, Samantha...! 

                                                                              FADE OUT:

                                            ACT FOUR

1919EXT. STREET - NIGHT

      Samantha walks alone.  MUSIC: the over-dramatic "Where Do I
      Go?" from "Hair."  Across the street, she sees, keeping to
      the shadows... the cream-colored OVERCOAT GUY she saw before.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Hey! 

      No response.  Sam starts across the street after him --

                                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    I said hey!  You! 

      -- and is almost run down by a TAXI!  The HORN BLOWS, the
      cab swerves -- and she's snatched away at the last second.

      On the sidewalk, she turns to see her rescuer: Detective
      Polk, the cop from her parents' house, who's just ruggedly
      handsome enough to become a love interest down the line.

                                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    Wow.  Thank you.  I'm such an idiot,
                    I was trying to talk to that --

      She looks: overcoat guy is gone. 

                                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    ...guy.  Wait, I know you, you're
                    that detective!  How weird is that,
                    that you were... following me, oh my
                    god you're following me.  Why are
                    you following me? 

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Someone tried to kill you.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    And?  You're protecting me?  You
                    think I might know who or why?  Sorry. 
                    If you want to know who'd want me
                    dead, though, I have some thoughts. 
                    Ready?  EVERYONE.  Who wouldn't?  I
                    would.  I need to be stopped.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    You're not so horrible. 

                                      SAMANTHA
                      Sweet-talker, now you're just flirting.
                          (pause)
                    But you probably know more about me
                    than I do at this point.  It could be
                    anyone.  Crazy patient.

                                      SAMANTHA (CONT'D)
                    Someone I testified against in court. 
                          (beat)
                    Jealous wife. 
                          (embarrassed)
                    You know about my affair?

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    You weren't too circumspect.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    I'll tell you who didn't know: my
                      boyfriend.  That's what I'm doing
                    out here now, deciding if I should
                    tell him.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Yes.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    No, seriously.  What do you think?

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Yes.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Stop saying that.  If I tell him, I
                    can end up alone; if I don't, he
                    never knows.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    You'd know.  I've seen it plenty in
                    my job -- what's the worst thing for
                      a relationship? 

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Going camping.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Worse.  Lying.  The guilt is like a
                    splinter, that gets under the skin...

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Or a grain of sand.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Why a grain of sand?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    In an oyster.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    No, that makes a pearl.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    So maybe guilt is a pearl.                                                                                      28.

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Guilt is not a pearl, guilt is a
                    splinter.  Who's the cop, here?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    But I have nothing to feel guilty
                    about!  I didn't do anything.  Bad
                    Sam did it.  I'm Good Sam, Bad Sam
                    is dead.  God I sound like a TV movie,
                    I'm leaving before you lock me up.  

      She starts across the street -- and we hear A CAR HORN BLAST! 
      And Polk yanks her to safety yet again.  When she's safe on
      the curb:

                                      DETECTIVE POLK
                    Maybe it wasn't murder.  Maybe you
                    just have bad peripheral vision.

2020INT. SAMANTHA AND TODD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

      Lights out.  Samantha is in bed on the couch, covers pulled
      up, but not sleeping.  Her eyes are wide open, as she
        contemplates her fear, and her choice.  Finally:

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Todd?

      Beat.  From in the darkened bedroom:

                                    TODD (O.S.)
                    Yeah?

      Pause.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Ren  is a guy.

      Pause.  More pause.  Then THE BEDROOM LIGHT COMES ON.

2121INT. SAMANTHA AND TODD'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

      Todd is pacing, upset, Samantha fights for her life.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    I'm sorry, I really really am, but
                    here's the thing: I don't even know
                    what I did, which is very much like
                    not doing it at all.

                                    TODD
                    So you're going with the insanity
                    defense.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Yeah, how's it playing?                                                                                      29.

                                    TODD
                    Great for you, bad for me, since I
                    don't have the benefit of memory loss!

                                      SAMANTHA
                    I can fix that, where's our frying
                    pan?
                          (off his look)
                    Not funny.  I know that.

      Todd can't look at her.  They've gone as far as they can go
      for now.  Samantha is resigned -- she knew what was coming.

                                    TODD
                          (with difficulty)
                    Sam... telling me the truth, though...
                    that was a good thing. 

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (starts to bedroom)
                    We'll see.  Who knows, maybe you'll
                    call me some day, we'll get some
                    coffee.

      Suddenly she stops, her face gets a weird, excited look.

                                    TODD
                    Sam?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    That's how we met.

2222INT. STARBUCKS - DAY - FLASHBACK

      Samantha -- Old Samantha, impatient, frowning -- waits in
      line, a couple of people away from placing her order.  At
      the pick-up counter, a BARISTA puts down a cup.

                                      BARISTA
                    Decaf latte!

      No one claims it.  Samantha looks at her watch.  She glances
      around.  Then she steps out of line, as --

                                      BARISTA (CONT'D)
                    Decaf latte --!

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Got it.  Mine.  Thank you.

      She takes the cup, starts to leave with it -- when Todd comes
      up.  He has a camera around his neck.                                                                                      30.

                                    TODD
                    Sorry, I was outside, is that mine?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    No.  It's mine.

      She starts to go. 

                                    TODD
                    So can I take your picture sometime?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    No.  But only because I can't allow
                    that line to ever work.

                                    TODD
                    Are you worried I'll steal your soul?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    What makes you think I have one?

                                    TODD
                    Because you feel a little bad about
                    taking my coffee.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (beat; eyes him)
                    You like the bad girls, huh?

                                    TODD
                    No.  But I'm a sucker for the scared
                    and the hurt.

      His frankness throws her.  She quickly recovers, and as she
      exits, she turns and gives Todd a sardonic smile, and the
      finger.  He raises his camera, clicks -- WE FREEZE ON THE
      PHOTO -- the one Sam admired back in Act II -- and MATCH TO:

2323INT. SAMANTHA AND TODD'S APARTMENT - END FLASHBACK

      Samantha holds the framed photo.  She and Todd both smile a
      little bittersweetly at the small victory.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    It's a start, anyway.  Ironic, though --
                    I was just thinking on the way here:
                    you don't know what you've got 'til
                    it's gone.

                                    TODD
                    Yeah...
                          (then)
                    That's a song, by the way.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Really?  Crap, I was kind of proud
                    of that one.                                                                                       31.

2424EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

      A doorman outside: FRANK, African-American, 50s, uniformed. 
      Samantha comes out of the building, carrying her suitcase
      and a few file folders from her desk.  Frank nods.

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (re suitcase)
                    He's just going to need some time. 
                          (beat)
                    Sorry, I don't remember your name.

                                      FRANK
                    No reason to.  Only word you've said
                    to me in five years is "Taxi."

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Okay, yes, I'm a bad, bad person, 
                    can we move on now, thank you!
                          (pause; embarrassed)
                    Sorry.  Hard day.

                                      FRANK
                    I'm Frank.  Sorry for your troubles.  

      Sam reaches for his hand, and drops her folders.  As they
      scramble to pick them up, WE SEE A PHOTO in one: the OVERCOAT
      GUY.  Sam sees the photo, stands, staring at it.

                                      FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Ms. Newly, if I can say...
                          (as she looks up: hm?)
                    I know a fair amount of people, given
                    the chance you have, that would love
                    to go back and change things about
                    their life.  Seeing what I have of
                    yours... I hope you'll avail yourself.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    I hope so, too, Frank.

                                      FRANK
                    So where do you go from here?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    God, that's the question, huh?  Get
                    back to work... find out who tried to
                    kill me... undo the damage I've done,
                    make up with Todd, and in general try
                    to win what I fear will be a daily
                    battle with my own nature.

                                      FRANK
                    I meant uptown or downtown.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Oh.                                                                                      32.

      She looks left and right, trying to get some sense, some
      pull, one way or another.  Frank feels badly for her.

                                      FRANK
                    There's a Tom Waits song.  "If you
                    get far enough away, you'll be on
                    your way back home."

                                      SAMANTHA
                          (nods at the wisdom)
                    Wow...
                          (then)
                    Okay, what does that mean?

                                      FRANK
                    That if you're trying to tell a story,
                    you'd best start at the beginning.

      Samantha thinks... then gets it, and moans.  PRE-LAP DOORBELL:

2525EXT. SAMANTHA'S PARENTS' HOUSE - NIGHT

      Samantha stands outside the door, suitcase and files in hand. 
      The door opens.  Her mom, Regina, is there. 

                                      SAMANTHA
                    You don't have to tell me why we
                    fought, yet, but at least tell me
                    this: are you the one who tried to
                    run me down?

                                      REGINA
                    Don't be silly.

      She stands out of the way for Sam to enter.

                                      SAMANTHA
                    That's not an answer.

                                      REGINA
                          (calling)
                    Howard!  She's back!
                          (as Samantha enters)
                    You can use your old room -- you
                    remember where that is, don't you?

                                      SAMANTHA
                    Well, no, I don't.

                                      REGINA
                    Just guess.  It'll be fun.

      And as the door closes, we imagine we can hear Samantha sigh.

                                                                              FADE OUT:
