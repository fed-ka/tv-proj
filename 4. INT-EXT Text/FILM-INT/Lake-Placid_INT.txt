FIND
KELLY SCOTT, pretty, thirty, as KEVIN CAMPBELL, forties,
approaches.
KEVIN
Kelly.
KELLY
(warmly)
Kevin, hey.
She beams affection, he exudes a little discomfort.
KEVIN
Hi.
Listen.
Could I steal you a
second?
KELLY
(great idea)
Absolutely.
They enter ON THE CUT, he closes the door.
KEVIN
I had a great time last night.
Again.
KELLY
Me too.
Reading his look, she suddenly smells it.
Her face drops.
KELLY (CONT'D)
(deducing)
That's not what you came to say.
KEVIN
You work for me.
I'm not
comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
She's a little crushed.
KELLY
I was working for you when "us"
started, what's--
KEVIN
I know and I thought I could handle
it but work and pleasure along with
somebody else, it's a dangerous
mix.
KELLY
Kevin, as long as we...
(suddenly)
What was that last part?
KEVIN
(sheepish)
The somebody else part?
KELLY
Yeah, that part.
There's...
somebody who's um...
KEVIN
(feels terrible)
Else.
A beat.
KELLY
(covering)
Oh.
Oh.
That's okay.
Well.
This
uh... this probably wasn't meant to
be, y'know.
I mean, I'm... God, I
gotta be ten years younger and you,
you... you're y'know...
KEVIN
(reading her mind)
A jerk.
KELLY
(you have no idea)
Oh...
(then)
No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm
just thrown, I'm...
(checks her watch)
I actually have an early lunch,
so...
KEVIN
It's ten after nine.
KELLY
Yes, well...
(smiling)
famished.
And she rushes out of the room.
OFF Kevin, we:
CUT TO:
We're watching an old classic creature feature.
FIND Kelly
alone, slowly eating popcorn, rapt, tense... watching the movie.
As the suspense builds, her hand freezes halfway between the
popcorn bag and her mouth.
ANGLE THE SCREEN
The monster pursues its human victim.
ANGLE KELLY
fear on her face.
ANGLE THE SCREEN
The monster makes its final surge, capturing its prey.
ANGLE KELLY
as she screams with fear and delight.
Her scream is only
partially muted by the shrieks of the other moviegoers.
After a beat, she calms, daring to eat popcorn again.
Wearing
gullibility, vulnerability all over her face.
Then from behind
a hand appears, taps her shoulder, causing her to let loose with
the most blood-curdling scream of all.
All the moviegoers turn to SEE... as will WE:
MYRA OKUBO
Thirties, standing mortified; the woman who tapped her shoulder.
CUT TO:
Kelly's in her office, working at her desk.
Kevin enters.
KEVIN
Hey.
KELLY
Kevin.
How's it going, what's
happenin', family good, great, nice
to catch up, get out.
KEVIN
This is business.
(then)
There was an accident in Maine,
some guy got killed by something in
a lake.
Probably a bear, but...
they found a tooth.
KELLY
A tooth?
KEVIN
A tooth they say couldn't have come
from any bear.
They say it looks
prehistoric.
Like maybe a
dinosaur.
KELLY
(without looking up)
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it,
he got killed by a dinosaur,
anything else?
KEVIN
I want you to go there.
Now she looks up.
KELLY
Sorry?
KEVIN
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're
a paleontologist, this is what we
do, I--
KELLY
This is what we do?
KEVIN
I'd like you to check out this
lake.
See--
KELLY
Are you on drugs?
KEVIN
Kelly--
KELLY
I'm not going to Maine, I won't
even go west of Forty-third Street--
KEVIN
Part of our research--
KELLY
I'm not even a field person.
KEVIN
Well on this one I'd like you to
be.
Kelly stares back.
The nickle drops.
KELLY
This was Myra's idea, wasn't it?
Get me out of the office for a few
days, until--
KEVIN
It has nothing to do with--
KELLY
I never do field work and even if
I did, Maine, to look at a tooth of
a dinosaur who bit somebody,
couldn't you dream up something--
KEVIN
Kelly--
KELLY
I am not going to Maine.
That's
ridiculous.
CUT TO:
Kelly with the Pilot.
She looks a little white.
Kelly is walking with Keough toward the morgue.
KEOUGH
He just came up screaming.
KELLY
Did he say anything?
KEOUGH
He just kinda gurgled.
He was
pretty much dead.
KELLY
And you didn't see anything?
KEOUGH
The lake was dead calm until up he
came.
The tooth is in there.
KELLY
(seeing)
There?
That's the morgue.
KEOUGH
Yes.
KELLY
Is the dead guy in there?
KEOUGH
That's where they keep them.
(then)
You want me to bring the tooth out
here?
KELLY
Um.
(bravado)
No, no.
Let's go.
CLOSE ON THE TOOTH
Reveal--
The Medical Examiner, STEVEN DANIELS, is there with Keough and
kelly.
Walt's torso is covered.
Kelly is examining the tooth.
KELLY
I need to get a microscopic look at
it.
DANIELS
Fine.
(indicating)
There you go.
KELLY
Maybe I should see...
(the body)
KEOUGH
(reading her)
I wouldn't.
KELLY
I'm fine, thank you.
KEOUGH
Have you ever seen a dead body
before, Ms. Scott?
KELLY
Well.
(admits)
At wakes.
KEOUGH
This is a little different.
KELLY
I can look at dead things.
And Daniels is about to pull the sheet back--
KELLY (CONT'D)
Wait.
She takes a breath.
KELLY (CONT'D)
Okay.
And Daniels peels back the sheet.
Kelly strains to disguise her
extreme horror.
Finally--
KELLY (CONT'D)
(fighting off nausea)
This... how long did this attack go
on for?
KEOUGH
Seconds.
Three, four.
KELLY
And this is how he came to the
boat?
KEOUGH
Yes.
KELLY
Okay.
(then)
And is there a place nearby I could
go to vomit?
OFF this, we:
CUT TO:
Jack, Kelly and Keough are questioning DELORES BICKERMAN, mid-
sixties, eccentric if not slightly daffy.
She's brought out
refreshments.
BICKERMAN
Oh, my husband passed away almost
two years ago.
KEOUGH
My department doesn't have any
record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
BICKERMAN
(with some attitude)
Oh well, I'm sorry.
I didn't
realize you keep such a firm track
of the dead.
KELLY
(gently)
What was the cause of your
husband's death, Ma'am, do you
know?
Off Bickerman's silence--
KELLY (CONT'D)
We don't mean to invade your
privacy but... was he ill, was he
sick?
KEOUGH
Was he swallowed?
KELLY
(reprimanding)
Sheriff.
JACK
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're
up here... a man was fatally
attacked yesterday by some animal
in this lake.
Do you know how your
husband died?
BICKERMAN
(brightly)
Oh yes.
I killed him.
Keough clenches his eyes shut.
The old woman's a loon.
JACK
You killed him.
BICKERMAN
(happily)
Oh, yes.
KEOUGH
And how would you have accomplished
this, Ma'am?
BICKERMAN
(rattling it off quickly,
simply)
Well, he was very ill and he
refused to go see a doctor and
well... I think he had Alzheimer's,
he would be coherent one day,
incoherent the next and one
coherent day, he asked me to end
his suffering.
I wouldn't do it
but he kept insisting and insisting
and deteriorating till the point
the only cognitive thing he could
really do was that I finish him
off.
Finally I just gave in and
hit him on the head with a skillet
then buried him under the bulkhead.
Jack, Keough, and Kelly just stare back at this crazy woman.
Off their looks--
BICKERMAN (CONT'D)
(to Keough)
Dig him up if you don't believe me,
Javert.
CUT TO:
His tent is on the palatial side.
Stereo, generator, he's got a
margarita bar going.
There's a party.
Hector's dancing with
Deputy Gare, others are enjoying the drinks and MUSIC.
HECTOR
You're a beautiful woman.
GARE
Thank you.
HECTOR
And law enforcement, such dangerous
work.
The idea that you could die
suddenly with no offspring,
disconcerting, let's mate, commit
your genes to perpetuity.
Upon which, Keough enters, doesn't like what he sees.
KEOUGH
Hey.
He goes, turns OFF the MUSIC.
KEOUGH
We are here on official business.
HECTOR
Cocktail?
KEOUGH
No!!
(then)
What's with digging the holes?
HECTOR
They come on land and they're
brazen.
They're also attracted to
noise, you can see I make a lot of
it.
KEOUGH
Everybody out, back to your tents,
now!
They start to leave.
HECTOR
(re Gare)
Could she stay, we've tentatively
scheduled intercourse.
KEOUGH
No!!
Out!
And they all go, including Gare, who shrugs to Keough "he's kind
of funny".
KEOUGH (CONT'D)
(to Hector)
You listen to me.
The only reason
I'm letting you be part of this is
'cause you got the helicopter and
the radar--
HECTOR
And you like me.
KEOUGH
I do not like you.
HECTOR
Deep down, gut check.
I'm growing
fond of you and it's liberating to
say so.
Keough stares back.
KEOUGH
You're a whacko.
And Keough leaves, to:
Kelly is butterflying Jack's wound, necessarily working very
close to him.
JACK
Ow.
Shit.
KELLY
Just gotta pull it a little
tighter.
JACK
Who taught you be be a nurse?
KELLY
Father's a surgeon.
I can even
stitch in a pinch, wouldn't be a
bad idea here.
JACK
No thanks.
KELLY
Keep it dry.
No swimming.
JACK
(dry)
Thank you.
They hold a look.
Then --
JACK (CONT'D)
You're having the best time of your
life, aren't you?
KELLY
(caught)
What?
Why... people have been
killed, I hardly think I'm having
a good time, why would...
(off his look; copping)
Does it show?
Jack nods slightly.
KELLY (CONT'D)
This is the first time I've
actually... y'know been in the
middle of anything.
I've never
really even gotten dirty before,
with me showers have always been
preventative.
Their eyes are locked now, making her self-conscious and
nervous.
JACK
That's why you're here.
To get in
the middle of something?
KELLY
Maybe.
I've always read about
what's happened.
I've never... I
know it sounds silly but, it's nice
to be someplace while something is
actually... y'know... happening.
Something is happening right now.
A beat.
KELLY (CONT'D)
We should probably go to bed.
(quickly)
Get rest, get some rest.
Go to our
separate beds, get some rest.
The Freudian slip of her life.
They hold another look.
Then he
starts to exit.
He stops at the door, turns back.
JACK
Thanks for the... bandaid.
KELLY
(please don't go)
Night.
He holds another look, then leaves.
OFF her punishing herself
for both the slip of the tongue and for cutting the moment
short.
CUT TO:
Hector and Kelly are flying toward the area, the search beams
are on.
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON JANINE
JANINE
He just took him in his jaws.
REVEAL
Keough, Kelly, and Jack are questioning a slightly hostile Mrs.
Bickerman.
BICKERMAN
(indignant)
I haven't broken any laws.
KEOUGH
(bordering on
condescension)
Oh, but you have, Ma'am.
You lied
to us, that could be obstruction of
justice.
A man's been killed in
part 'cause of your silence, I
could make out a charge of reckless
endangerment and I'm sure PETA
would be annoyed at how you treat
your cows.
BICKERMAN
The reason I lied is if I'd told
you the truth, you'd just hunt it
down and kill it which seems to be
exactly what you're doing.
KELLY
How long have you been feeding this
thing?
BICKERMAN
About six years.
He first appeared
in May of nineteen-ninety-one.
Bernie was out fishing and it
followed him home.
So we threw him
some scraps and well... he didn't
seem to bother anybody.
He became
kind of like a pet who lived in the
wild.
JACK
He just appeared.
You have no idea
how he arrived in this lake?
BICKERMAN
No.
Do you?
KEOUGH
Ma'am.
Your husband, Bernie.
You
didn't, by any chance, lead him to
the lake blindfolded?
BICKERMAN
(offended)
No, I did not.
(then)
The crocodile did kill him, though.
But it was all... it was a mistake.
KELLY
A mistake.
BICKERMAN
One of our horses got loose two
years ago, went to the lake to
drink and... well the crocodile
started coming in, Bernie went to
intercede and... it was all a
terrible misunderstanding.
(then)
If I reported it, they would've
sent people to kill it.
Keough, Kelly and Jack can't quite believe what they're hearing.
Then--
KEOUGH
Ma'am, how could you not report
this?
He puts human life at risk
and--
BICKERMAN
Nobody lives on this lake.
it's
really his lake now.
Kelly, Jack and Keough with Bickerman.
BICKERMAN
Murders and rapes in the cities.
People bomb planes... can the
police stop them?
No.
But feed
one little cow to a crocodile...
KEOUGH
You're to wait right here until the
police show, you're under full
house arrest.
BICKERMAN
Thank you, Officer Fuckmeat.
GARE (O.S.)
(through walkie-talkie)
Hank!
We got a problem with
Hector.
KEOUGH
(into walkie-talkie)
What problem?
GARE (O.S.)
(through walkie-talkie)
He went swimming.
CUT TO:
Gare still scans the water's surface, looking for any sign of
Hector.
And her face freezes.
Oh yes, there's the sign.
HER P.O.V.
Hector continues to backswim slowly to the plane and the croc
slowly follows.
GARE
Hector!!
We can hear the quaking fear in Hector's voice.
As he continues
to slowly backswim.
HECTOR
(to Gare; forced calm)
Just turn the ignition, it's fuel
injected.
Gare turns the ignition, the ENGINE KICKS and DIES.
GARE
Come on.
She turns it again and the ENGINE TURNS OVER.
ANGLE HECTOR
The crocodile is still right with him as they inch closer and
closer toward the chopper.
HECTOR
I know under the circumstances,
biting off my head might seem
viable.
It would cheapen you.
But nothing's funny about this to Hector now.
What he's staring
into is death.
His own.
Gare raises her rifle.
GARE
I might get a shot.
HECTOR
(fear in his voice)
No.
If you don't kill him
instantly, I'm dead and you'll only
kill him instantly if you get his
brain, which is about the size of
a cherry.
And even if you were on
target, a bullet might not
penetrate his hide.
ANGLE GARE
GARE
(re the croc)
Jesus.
(to Hector)
About twelve more yards.
Keep
coming just like that.
ANGLE HECTOR
craning to see how far away he is and as soon as he breaks eye
contact with the CROCODILE, it GROWLS.
Hector quickly locks
eyes with him again.
ANGLE GARE
GARE
(weakly)
Oh my God.
RESUME
By now Hector is almost to the chopper, the croc is right there
too.
Hector's right hand then goes slowly for his belt though
it's impossible to discern why.
The crocodile seems poised to
finish him.
There's a slight GROWL.
And then suddenly, a small underwater POP, followed by an
EXPLOSION out of the water.
it's an inflatable life vest and as
it pop tarts out of the water, the croc lunges for it.
As the croc goes for the vest, Hector makes his dash for the
chopper.
In almost an instant, he's climbing on board as the
croc pulls the vest into darkness underwater.
Hector's up on the chopper's ski.
HECTOR
Move over!!
The crocodile's head comes thrusting up, its massive jaws
snapping shut, missing Hector by an inch, maybe two.
Hector
dives into the chopper, screaming.
GARE
Go!!
She REVS the CHOPPER.
The croc comes up again, chomping down on
one of the landing skis.
Both Gare and Hector scream as the
whole helicopter is jerked mightily.
GARE (CONT'D)
(screaming)
Go!!!
HECTOR
I'm trying!!!
The croc releases and the chopper rights itself and begins to
thrust off, when the croc surfaces again, mouth open.
Gare
FIRES her REVOLVER.
It might as well shoot BB's.
The croc is
undaunted but he does miss the ski and by now the chopper is up
and running, finally safely out of the reptile's reach.
CUT TO:
Hector enters, sits.
A beat.
Kelly enters, goes to sit next to
him.
KELLY
(softly)
Did you want to be killed by it?
HECTOR
You think I'm that nuts?
KELLY
(softly)
Hector.
(then)
What you just did... there was at
least some sort of a death wish
going on.
HECTOR
Nothing's real.
KELLY
Excuse me?
HECTOR
Nothing's real.
(escalating)
I'm rich, people are automatically
my friends, sycophants ooze out
like oil slicks and and and--
He's sounding erratic.
HECTOR (CONT'D)
With crocodiles... everything's
even.
KELLY
I'm no psychiatrist.
But I would
think there have to be better
places to look for autonomy, than--
HECTOR
(pained)
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has
robbed me of the dream in life, I
sit here broken, a hollow sack--
KELLY
Oh, bullshit.
And Hector drops the act.
HECTOR
Didn't even sound good?
KELLY
No.
HECTOR
(worth a try)
Eh.
Fuck it.
KELLY
Can I tell them you won't go back
in the water?
HECTOR
Yes.
You may.
But maybe... I
don't know...
He has trouble saying it.
KELLY
What?
HECTOR
Could we have intercourse?
She just whacks him.
Then exits.
OFF Hector, "worth a shot",
we:
CUT TO:
Hector pilots.
HECTOR
Not much drag.
As long as I can
keep him from swinging, we're okay.
HECTOR
I got something on the screen.
JACK (O.S.)
You do?
ANGLE THE SCREEN
There's a mass... moving toward the cow.
HECTOR
He's coming.
HECTOR
(charged)
On our way.
There, he's surfacing,
there's the snout.
You little
sucker.
HECTOR
We're in about four feet of water
now.
HECTOR
Oh, shit.
The chopper is in trouble.
The cow sways, the helicopter
struggles to stay airborne.
Hector's having trouble righting his chopper.
HECTOR
Motherfucker.
