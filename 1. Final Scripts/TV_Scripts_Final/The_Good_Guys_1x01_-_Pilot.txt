THE BEST ASSASSIN IN THE WORLD (NON-SPEAK)                                        ACT ONE

      EXT. ROAD - DAY11

      A stretch of highway. From offscreen, we hear the WAIL OF 
      SIRENS and the TERRIBLE SOUND OF METAL TEARING, the sounds of 
      an unseen COLOSSAL TRAFFIC ACCIDENT.  

      After a moment, several TANGERINES ROLL ONTO THE ROAD, moving 
      at a good sixty miles an hour. They re just an orange blur 
      until we see them rolling in SLOW-MO... it s like bullet-
      time, except for tangerines. 

      Back to normal speed as the tangerines are overtaken and 
      squashed by a PONTIAC SUNFIRE, which screams along, driving 
      as fast as a subcompact car can go. 

      Close on its heels is a TRANS-AM, which pulls up alongside 
      it. The two cars moving at a breathtaking pace, especially 
      considering that a MAN is struggling to climb OUT THE WINDOW 
      of the TRANS-AM. He is JACK (30). He leaps toward the window 
      of the Sunfire, screaming... 

                                  JACK
                      AAAAUUUUGH!!

      We FREEZE FRAME with him in midair, as we cut to black.

      A title reads: Four Days Earlier. Dissolve to:

      INT. POLICE STATION - MORNING22

      We move through a busy police station. Cops bustle this way 
      and that, as we move past perps being dragged to cells... 

      The man who leaped from the car, Detective JACK BAILEY (30) 
      sits at a desk. He s goodlooking, smart, and good at his job 
      but with a smart-ass quality that explains why he hasn t gone 
      further in life. He picks up a phone reluctantly, dials:

                                  JACK
                    Dan, get up. You re two hours late.
                          (listens, then:)
                    You have no sick days. And there s 
                    no such thing as a cramped liver.

      Jack holds the phone away from his ear. There is the faint 
      sound of VOMITING on the other end of the line. 

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Crawl to the shower. Around the 
                    puddle of sick, Dan. I m not going 
                    to bathe you again.              JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             2.


      He hangs up. He looks over at a nearby OFFICE for a beat, 
      steeling himself as he gets up and walks over... 

      Before he can make it to the office, the door opens and 
      LIEUTENANT KATHERINE ANDERSON (50) emerges. She s attractive 
      and professional, and clearly has no interest in talking to 
      Jack.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                      Lieutenant Anderson, can I talk to-

                                  LT. ANDERSON
                    The answer is no.

                                  JACK
                    I haven t asked a question.
                          (off her impatient look:)
                    I d like to request a reassignment 
                    to another department. Working in 
                    property crimes with Dan Stark-

                                  LT. ANDERSON
                    I ve said it before. Someone has to 
                    be his partner. Talk to the captain 
                    if you don t like it.

                                  JACK
                    With all due respect, Lieutenant, 
                    the Captain hates me.

                                  LT. ANDERSON
                    With all due respect, Detective, 
                    that s why you re Dan s partner.
                          (re: the file in his hand)
                    Looks like you ve got a case to 
                    crack, there. I suggest you get on 
                    it.

      She hurries off, leaving Jack standing there with the file.

      EXT. DAN S APARTMENT - DAY33

      Jack is parked in front of a run-down apartment building in a 
      Ford Taurus. DAN STARK (50 s) slides into the car. He s an 
      older, worn-looking version of a classic 1970 s cop, with 
      sideburns and a moustache. He sips clear liquid from a mug.

                                  DAN
                    Didn t think I d make it through 
                    that shower. But guess what I found 
                    in the conditioner bottle?

                                  JACK
                    I can t imagine. Conditioner?              JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             3.


                                  DAN
                      Peppermint schnapps! Put it there a 
                    week ago, just in case. It s called 
                    thinking ahead. Where we going?

                                  JACK
                    There was a burglary on Alarcon and 
                    12th. Some missing appliances. 

                                  DAN
                    Burglary, huh? Hey, I ever tell you-

                                  JACK
                    Yes. Whatever it is, you told me.

                                  DAN
                    I don t think so. See, back in  85, 
                    me and Frank got a call about a 
                    stolen car. Went in thinking it was- 

                                  JACK
                    - just grand theft auto.  It was 
                    Laotians smuggling heroin in the 
                    engine blocks of  86 Mustangs.

                                  DAN
                    Yeah, but I tell you about the part-

                                  JACK
                    -where you drove a Mustang into the 
                    river? Yes. Yes you did. 

                                  DAN
                    Hell, it s a good story. So we re 
                    in the water, and Frank, he looks 
                    over at me, and says  Surf s up! 

      JACK MOUTHS THE WORDS  Surf s up  as Dan says them. He sighs.

                                  JACK
                    Maybe we ll find out heroin dealers 
                    stole this lady Eileen s stuff. 
                    Then if you re lucky you can drive 
                    her car into the river.

                                  DAN
                    You watch, college boy. I bet 
                    before this is over we re gonna be 
                    dealing with some major criminals.

                                  JACK
                    Major criminals. Right. That ll 
                    happen.              JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             4.


      As they pass a MOTEL in a seedy area, we stay with the motel. 
      We RAMP across the street, to a motel room door.

      INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY44

      The face of MANUEL ESCALANTE (40). He s short, with acne 
      scars, bad teeth, and a single heavy eyebrow. He eats a fast 
      food burger, drinking an orange soda as he writes a letter. 
      Behind him, a giant of a man, SIMON (28), gathers some 
      MACHINE GUNS and a large GREEN GOLF BAG.

      We hear Escalante s voice in accented English as he writes:

                                  ESCALANTE (V.O.)
                    Dear Romero... For five years, I am 
                    your errand boy, making deliveries 
                    to the States. Always I stay at 
                    budget motels, to save you money.

      He looks around the motel room, scowling and furious. It s a 
      pretty shitty motel, all right. 

      EXT. MOTEL - DAY55

      Escalante and Simon pack the GOLF BAG and the guns into a 
      PONTIAC SUNFIRE. Escalante fumes as they climb into the car.

                                  ESCALANTE (V.O.)
                    I rent my car, always driving a 
                      subcompact because you are so cheap 
                    to pay for a midsize sedan. 

      EXT. UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY66

      The Pontiac Sunfire is parked at a beautiful modern home. 
      Escalante and Simon emerge, walking to the door with the 
      GREEN GOLF BAG. A SLICK DRUG DEALER lets them in.

                                  ESCALANTE (V.O.)
                    I sell your cocaine for you, and 
                    you call me your chihuahua and pay 
                    me less than your pool boy. 

      INT. UPSCALE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER77

      Two DRUG DEALERS stand in the living room. Cocaine sits on 
      the table. Simon packs cash into the golf bag. Escalante 
      smiles at the drug dealers, then PULLS OUT A PISTOL. 

                                  ESCALANTE
                    No more. 

      BANG! BANG! He shoots the drug dealers.              JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             5.


      EXT. STREET - LATER88

      Escalante and Simon stand at a FedEx Box by the road. 

                                  ESCALANTE (V.O.)
                    I took your money, you son of a 
                    whore. I hope that we meet again 
                    someday, so I can crush the life 
                    out of you with a crappy subcompact 
                    rental car. Adios. Escalante.

      Escalante puts the blood-spattered letter into a FedEx 
      envelope and drops it in the box. He turns to Simon, happy.

                                  ESCALANTE (CONT D)
                    What a country. A man can make a 
                    better life just by killing two men 
                    and stealing three million dollars. 

                                  SIMON
                    Yes. But... what about the police?

                                  ESCALANTE
                    Don t worry, Simon. In the USA, the 
                    police are slow, and lazy, and 
                    afraid to use their guns. They are 
                    like sheep, and we are like snakes.

                                  SIMON
                    Do snakes eat sheep?

                                  ESCALANTE
                    The point is, in a country like 
                    this, who can stop us? Who?

      EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

      Jack and Dan walk up the front walk of a pleasant suburban 
      house. They go to the door, knock... a beat, and the door 
      opens. EILEEN WOLFE (40, attractive) smiles out at them.

                                  JACK
                    I m Detective Bailey, and this is 
                    Detective Stark.

      INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY99

      DAN wiggles his finger in his ear, bored. He and Jack examine 
      a smashed TV sits on Eileen s living room floor.

                                  EILEEN
                    I think someone tried to steal my 
                    TV. Looks like they dropped it and 
                    ran out the back when I got home.              JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             6.


                                  JACK
                    And the only thing missing was
                    An EZ-Steam Humidifier?

                                  EILEEN
                    The guy probably grabbed it after 
                    he dropped the TV. It was worth 
                    about $45. I was surprised the 
                    police sent anyone out. Are you 
                    guys, like, the small property 
                    crimes guys, or...?

                                  JACK
                    We, ah... work a range of cases.

                                  EILEEN
                          (to Dan)
                    I m sorry, it s driving me crazy- 
                    do I know you from somewhere?

                                  DAN
                    Maybe... Name s Detective Stark.

                                  EILEEN
                    That s right. You saved the 
                      governor s son. Back in...  85? 

                                  DAN
                    Yeah. Me  n my old partner, Frank 
                    Savage. They made a TV movie about 
                    it.  Heroes in Blue. 

      She looks him up and down, obviousl impressed. He checks her 
      out, turns to Jack:

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    Why don t you look for evidence? 
                    I m gonna interview the victim.
                          (to Eileen)
                    Anyplace private we can talk? I 
                    find it s good to relax when 
                      remembering details of a crime. 

      Jack watches them go, sighs, then pulls out an evidence kit.

      EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - LATER1010

      Jack waits on the porch, bored out of his mind. He looks up 
      as Dan emerges from the house with Eileen. They are tousled. 

                                  DAN
                    Hey there. Find anything?              JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             7.


                                  JACK
                    Blood and hair samples. Two 
                      fingerprints. And I read a back 
                    issue of a quilting magazine.

      Jack pulls out some paperwork, holding it out for Eileen to 
      sign. She signs it, eyes on Dan, ignoring Jack entirely.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    You ve got our number, so if you 
                    think of anything else, call us and 
                    we ll send out another minor 
                    celebrity to sleep with you.

      Dan and Eileen cuddle. She makes eyes at him...

                                  EILEEN
                    You sure you re done? You could 
                      investigate some more. 

                                  DAN
                    Later, sweetheart. I gotta fight 
                    the bad guys.

      INT. POLICE CAR - DAY1111

      Jack and Dan drive away from Eileen s house. Dan pulls out an 
      airplane bottle of Creme de Menthe.

                                  DAN
                    Whoo! She was a firecracker. You 
                    know she s a Sociology Professor 
                    over at the University? Part time 
                    yoga instructor, too, which is 
                    always nice. Found this in her 
                    pantry... want a snort?

                                  JACK
                    You know, when we interview robbery 
                    victims, we re not supposed to rob 
                    them too. Or sleep with them. 

                                  DAN
                    Hey, a lot of these victims are so 
                    tense they can t remember squat. A 
                    roll in the hay and a smoke and 
                    they open right up. Got an I.D. on 
                      a possible perp... a guy selling 
                    alarm systems door to door.

      Dan tosses some notes to Jack, who looks unsure whether to be 
      disgusted or impressed. Dan frowns at Jack s car, thinking...              JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             8.


                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    You need a new car. We ll need some 
                      horsepower when this hudiminifier 
                    thing heats up.

                                  JACK
                    It s a $45 humidifier. The burglar 
                    probably didn t know what it was. 
                    It s not going to heat up. 

                                  DAN
                    There are no small crimes, college 
                    boy. Only small cops.
                          (off Jack s look)
                    Crime s like a sweater. One string 
                    ain t much. But pull it, and it s 
                    all connected. This humidifier s 
                    just the tip of the iceberg.

                                  JACK
                    So it s an iceberg and a sweater.

      Dan winks, nodding - exactly. Jack looks out the window, 
      glum. As they pass a MEDICAL OFFICE we RAMP to it...

      INT. DR. KALFUSS S OFFICE - MORNING1212

        A well-appointed doctor s office. DR. BARRY KALFUSS (40), a 
        self-satisfied, pudgy Beverly Hills plastic surgeon sits 
      across a desk from Escalante and Simon. 

                                    KALFUSS
                    As I explained in my email, for 
                    a... discreet facial reconstruction 
                    surgery like this, I ask for cash 
                    up front. It s easier for-

      Escalante places a STACK OF CASH on the desk. Wow. 

                                    KALFUSS (CONT D)
                    Okay, then. Now, have you thought 
                    about what you want done, exactly-

                                  ESCALANTE
                    I wish to look like Erik Estrada.

      Escalante unfolds a publicity photo of Erik Estrada circa 
      1983. Kalfuss looks at the tiny, pockmarked Escalante...

                                    KALFUSS
                    Ah. Well... You ll look much more 
                    like Mr. Estrada than you do now.               JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             9.


                                  ESCALANTE
                    I have no worries. You are the 
                    best, yes? Also, if you fail, your 
                    last hours on earth will be spent 
                    begging for death.

      Kalfuss laughs nervously. Forces a smile.

                                    KALFUSS
                    Yes, well, we can t have that, now 
                    can we? Let s get started.

      INT. DR. KALFUSS S OFFICE - OPERATING ROOM - HOURS LATER1313

      A small in-office operating room. Escalante lies on the table 
      with an anaesthesia drip in his arm. Simon sits in the corner 
      wearing a surgical mask, holding his pistol. Watching.

      Kalfuss works on Escalante s face, in the middle of the 
      surgery. He glances at Simon, nervous about the hulking armed 
      man glaring at him. His hand shakes slightly as he cuts...

      As he turns to grab a retractor, his arm catches on one of 
      the heart monitors attached to Escalante s chest. The machine 
      beeps. Kalfuss jumps, startled. Simon stands, gun ready.

                                  SIMON
                    What is wrong with Senor Escalante? 

                                    KALFUSS
                    Please, just calm down. It may be a 
                    reaction to the anaesthesia, or, 
                    uh... just put the gun away...

                                  SIMON
                    Fix him. Now.

      Kalfuss looks at Simon, who cocks the gun.

                                    KALFUSS
                    I m trying to perform surgery here-

      Kalfuss looks over at the monitors... Escalante appears to be 
      flatlining. A beat, and he DIVES under the table. Simon FIRES 
      at Kalfuss... His bullets SMASH into the delicate equipment, 
      then hit an OXYGEN TANK. 

      WITH KALFUSS, under the table, as the tank EXPLODES in a 
      FIREBALL... Kalfuss whimpers in fear. There is a beat... 
      nothing. Kalfuss peeks out. Simon lies dead on the ground. 
      Escalante, motionless on the table. Off Kalfuss s look...

                                        ACT TWO


      INT. D.A. S OFFICE - DAY1515

      Jack talks to LIZ TOWNSEND (30), an attractive assistant DA. 
      These two have a history Jack hasn t recovered from, and you 
      can see why - she s smart, sexy, with a quick wit not 
      entirely unlike Jack s. She looks at him, bemused...

                                  LIZ
                      A humidifier? What, you want me to 
                    see if we can hire a special 
                      prosecutor for small appliances? 
                    Maybe convene a grand jury? 
                          (off his look)
                    Jack, it s not like anyone s dead. 

                                  JACK
                    Just give the department a nudge. 
                    Get me some lab work done. Maybe 
                    with a legit conviction or two I 
                    can get off Dan Stark babysitting 
                    duty. 

                                  LIZ
                    You think that s going to help? 
                    Your problem was never getting 
                      convictions, Jack. Your problem-

                                  JACK
                    Not this again-

                                  LIZ
                    No, you need to hear it. You re a 
                    very smart cop. But cops, no matter 
                    how smart they are, do not climb 
                    the department ladder if they 
                    insist on making their fellow cops 
                    look like idiots. Like that murder 
                    case last year, downtown-

                                  JACK
                    So I m supposed to stand and watch 
                    while a detective just doesn t 
                    notice a major piece of evidence?

                                  LIZ
                    When that detective is your 
                      supervisor, maybe you do. 

                                  JACK
                    It was a signed confession! With 
                    the victim s blood on it-            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             11.


                                  LIZ
                    It wasn t just that, and you know 
                    it. You ve pissed off every cop in 
                    the precinct one way or another. 
                    Dan Stark is just the only one too 
                    oblivious to care.
                          (off his look)
                    I ll look into it, okay? 

      Jack nods, grateful. He looks at the picture of Liz and her 
      absurdly handsome boyfriend on the desk. Sighs.

                                  JACK
                    How s Kyle?

                                  LIZ
                    Good. We re going sailing Sunday.
                          (off Jack s look)
                    Before you say something about the 
                    fact that Kyle has a boat, consider 
                    what I said about not pissing 
                    people off. Think about the fact 
                    that I just agreed to do you a 
                    favor. Nice seeing you, Jack.

      EXT. D.A. S OFFICE - NIGHT1616

      Jack walks out of the office. His cell phone rings. 

                                  JACK
                    What?

                                  DAN (O.S.)
                    Hey there. S me.

      INT. DAN S APARTMENT - NIGHT1717

      Every inch of Dan s place is a disaster except for the 
      immaculate mantle, which displays Dan s commendations, photos 
      of him and Frank, and a videotape of  Heroes in Blue.  Dan 
      sits with a bowl of Lucky Charms and a bottle of schnapps. 
      INTERCUT with Jack in front of the D.A. s office. 

                                  DAN
                    How d it go with the D.A.?

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    We ll see. How was your nap?

                                  DAN
                    Good. Been thinking about the 
                    humind- the hudimifiner thingy. I 
                    think it s big. Maybe drugs.            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             12.


                                  JACK (O.S.)
                      A humidifier made of drugs? Bold 
                    theory.

                                  DAN
                    Why don t you come over? We ll kick 
                    it around. Me and Frank used to do 
                    that... Couple drinks, and before 
                    you know it, the case is cracked-

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    I think I m going to go home, Dan.

                                  DAN
                    Oh. Well... See you tomorrow, okay? 
                    We ll bust some punks.

      CLICK. Dan sets the phone down, disappointed. He sits in the 
      fading light with his cereal and schnapps. All alone. 

      EXT. DR. KALFUSS S OFFICE - NIGHT

      The parking lot of Kalfuss s office. Kalfuss waits nervously 
      with Escalante s Sunfire; some ends of clothing stick out of 
      the trunk - clearly, Escalante and Simon have been stuffed 
      inside. 

      JULIUS BROWN (30 s), a pleasant, intelligent African American 
      guy in hip clothes walks into the lot and over to Kalfuss.

                                    KALFUSS
                    Thank you for coming. You can... 
                    take care of this?

                                  JULIUS
                    Dump a car? Shouldn t be too 
                      complicated. This an insurance 
                    thing like last time, or...

                                    KALFUSS
                    No. It s... I just need it gone.

      Julius notices the clothes sticking out of the trunk. Raises 
      an eyebrow. Kalfuss pulls an envelope from his pocket.

                                    KALFUSS (CONT D)
                    Ten thousand, cash. Plus, uh... 
                    this golf bag.

                                  JULIUS
                    Sounds like we got a deal.            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             13.


      Kalfuss smiles, nervous, then hands Julius the keys and 
      hurries off. Julius HOISTS THE GOLF BAG, gets in the car and 
      drives off as we FADE TO BLACK.

      INT. POLICE STATION - MORNING1818

      Jack walks past the front counter of the police station, 
      carrying a cup of coffee. A clerk stops him...

                                  CLERK
                      Detective. A package came for you.

      Jack takes the package; it s from the crime lab. A note is 
        paperclipped to the front; it reads:  Had the lab do this for 
      you overnight. Hope it helps - Liz.  Jack carries it back to 
      his desk as DETECTIVE BARRIOS (40 s) smirks in his direction.

                                  DETECTIVE BARRIOS
                    How s the big case going? Heard you 
                    and Stark are makin  the city safe 
                    for small appliances.

      Jack smiles, lets it go. Barrios turns to another detective:

                                  DETECTIVE BARRIOS (CONT D)
                    Hey didn t you lose a pen the other 
                    day? You should see if Ace here can 
                    find it for you...

      Jack tries to let it go. Tries so hard... then:

                                  JACK
                    Aren t you the guy who misspelled 
                    the word  cocaine  on all your 
                    reports last year?

                                  DETECTIVE BARRIOS
                    What re you talking about, man? I-

                                  JACK
                    I did document review last month. I 
                    corrected your reports. 
                          (off his look)
                    Spell it. Go on. Spell cocaine.

      The two men look at each other. Barrios grits his teeth.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    It s c-o-c-a-i-n-e. There s an  i. 

      Barrios glares at Jack, as Jack walks to his office...

                                  DETECTIVE BARRIOS
                    There s an  i  in  prick,  too.            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             14.


      INT. PROPERTY CRIMES OFFICE - CONTINUOUS1919

      Jack walks in. Dan sits at his desk, dozing... Jack squeezes 
      by Dan and SITS AT THE COMPUTER. Dan wakes up, looks over...

                                  JACK
                    Results from the crime lab... Got a

      Jack types... a mug shot appears on the computer screen. It s 
      Julius Brown, who we saw talking to Kalfuss. Jack reads the 
      name under the picture as Dan walks over, curious.

      EXT. STREET - DAY2020

      JULIUS BROWN emerges from a MAZDA on a quiet downtown street. 
      We see that he is carrying the GREEN GOLF BAG. He walks to a 
      THRIFT SHOP, unlocks it, and goes in.

      As he does, we WHIP PAN around to JACK AND DAN, who stand up 
      the street next to their car, watching. Jack checks a file.

                                  DAN
                    Why the hell does he have a green 
                    golf bag?

                                  JACK
                    I don t know. Maybe he plays.
                          (checks a file)
                      Convictions for theft, receiving 
                    stolen property, ten different 
                    kinds of insurance fraud...

      Dan looks at Jack s computer printouts...

                                  DAN
                      Computers. I can t get used to  em. 
                    Don t you worry they re going to... 
                    you know... turn on you?

                                  JACK
                    I m not particularly worried my 
                    computer is going to attack me, no. 

                                  DAN
                    Sometimes I just look at the one in 
                    the office. It s like it s... 
                    thinking. Making plans. You know?

                                  JACK
                    Well, until it decides to rise up 
                    and overthrow humanity, it s a 
                    pretty good tool for police work.

                                  DAN
                    I dunno. There s a lot of stuff a 
                    computer can t do. I ever tell you 
                    about the time me and Frank found 
                    five thousand quaaludes-            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             16.


                                  JACK
                    In a sock monkey? Yes. You did.

                                  DAN
                    Point is, we didn t need a 
                    computer. We just had a hunch, 
                    started cutting open sock monkeys. 

                                  JACK
                    If there s a sock monkey in there, 
                    feel free to knife it. Let s go.

      As Jack and Dan walk up the street to the thrift shop, we see 
      a SOUTH AMERICAN MAN walk into the store. Jack and Dan don t 
      pay much attention, however... Dan s telling his story, and 
      Jack is getting more and more annoyed.

                                  DAN
                    You re missing the point. See, 
                    there s a bigger picture you gotta 
                    pay attention to-

      Jack turns on Dan, frustrated. He yells:

                                  JACK
                    Enough! There s no bigger picture, 
                    all right? No major criminals, no 
                      quaaludes, just a THRIFT STORE and 
                    a STOLEN HUMIDIFIER-

      Suddenly, behind him - BANG! BANG! BANG! There is a series of 
      deafening GUNSHOTS. The window SHATTERS, glass cascading into 
      the street in a hail of buckshot. Jack and Dan both hit the 
      deck, looking at the shop as more gunfire explodes from 
      inside, glass showering into the street... 

                                  DAN
                    What the hell s going on?

                                  JACK
                    How am I supposed to know?

      Jack and Dan crawl through the street to get a better view. 
      From their POV: THE SOUTH AMERICAN MAN, his face visible 
      through the blasted window.

                                  DAN
                    WHO THE HELL IS THAT?

      INT. MANSION - DAY2222

      The South American man is led through a mansion by a couple 
      of armed guards. A title card reads  Lima, Peru. 24 Hours 
      Earlier.  We see the man closer, now. His face is weathered, 
      tough. He is PEDRO (40 s). 

      We follow him into a lavish living room. ROMERO (50 s), a 
      sleek drug lord, lounges on the couch in a bathrobe, watching 
       The Nanny  in Spanish on a large TV. He chuckles at the 
      program, glancing back at Pedro as he enters.

                                  ROMERO
                    Pedro. Thank you for coming.

                                  PEDRO
                    Senor Romero. You have a job for 
                    me?

      Romero turns off the TV. Business time. He sighs.

                                  ROMERO
                    For years, my cousin Escalante goes 
                    to the U.S. to deliver a product. 
                    He takes shipments of cocaine in a 
                    golf bag to my buyers and returns 
                    with cash. Yesterday, though, he 
                    was not on the flight from LA. Then 
                    I hear my buyers are all dead, and 
                    I get this in the FedEx.

      Romero hands over Escalante s blood-splattered letter.

                                  ROMERO (CONT D)
                    I pay him twice what he made as a 
                    dry cleaner in Cuzco. And this is 
                    how he repays me. Fortunately, my 
                    cousin has the brain of a potato. 
                    My men found this in his villa.

      Romero holds up a brochure featuring a smiling picture of Dr. 
      Kalfuss. A caption reads:  A Whole New You. Cosmetic surgery 
      for Men and Women with Dr. Barry Kalfuss. 

                                  PEDRO
                    So. He hopes to disappear with a 
                    new face. Why don t you send your 
                    men for him?

                                  ROMERO
                    They can t find a chicken in the 
                    yard. You have CIA training... you 
                    are the second best assassin in the 
                    world.            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             18.


                                  PEDRO
                    Yes. That is what they say. The 
                    second best.

                                  ROMERO
                    You can do the thing, with the gun.

                                  PEDRO 
                    Yes. I can do the thing.

                                  ROMERO
                    Do the thing for me?

                                  PEDRO
                    I do not feel like it.

      Romero turns to a guard, grinning.

                                  ROMERO
                    You. Throw him your pistol. 

      Pedro sighs, closing his eyes as the guard tosses his pistol. 
      Pedro catches it, FIRING SIX TIMES at the GUARD S REFLECTION 
      in a large mirror. Two in the eyes, one in the forehead, and 
      three in the heart. The guard looks on, horrified... 

      Romero smiles at the guard - Awesome, huh? He turns to Pedro.

                                  ROMERO (CONT D)
                    Go to the U.S. Find Escalante and 
                    the golf bag. Prove to us all why 
                    you are the second best.

      Pedro nods, his eyes cold, as he looks up at the  Body By 
      Kalfuss  brochure. MATCH CUT off of Dr. Kalfuss s picture:

      Kalfuss walks into his living room, looks up... And sees 
      Pedro, standing in the middle of the living room. Waiting for 
      him. With a gun.

                                    KALFUSS

                    Where is Escalante? Where is the 
                    golf bag?

                                    KALFUSS
                    I have an automatic security 
                    system. The police are already-

      Pedro takes a SECURITY KEYPAD from his pocket and tosses it 
      on the ground at Kalfuss s feet. Kalfuss looks at it, then:

                                    KALFUSS (CONT D)
                    Um... Mr. Escalante hired me to 
                    perform some cosmetic surgery. I 
                    informed him of the risks, of the 
                    fact that a percentage of patients-

      Pedro cocks his pistol. Kalfuss s voice cracks with fear.

                                    KALFUSS (CONT D)
                    He s dead! I think it was a drug 
                    reaction. I paid a guy to dump the 
                    body, the golf bag, all of it. The 
                    guy s name is Julius Brown. Please, 
                    don t kill me...

                                  PEDRO

      INT. THRIFT SHOP - DAY2525

      Pedro walks up to the counter of the thrift shop. Julius 
      stands behind it. He smiles pleasantly. Pedro looks around, 
      sees the green golf bag behind the counter. 

                                  PEDRO
                    Por favor, give to me the golf bag.

                                  JULIUS
                    You speak Spanish? I m learning. 

      Pedro nods, uncertain, as Julius sets the bag on the counter.

                                  JULIUS (CONT D)
                    Este bolsa de golf? You don t want 
                    it. I been trying to open it all 
                    day. It s locked or something.            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             20.


                                  PEDRO
                    The bag belongs to my employer. 
                    Good luck with your Spanish. Your 
                    grammar is good, but your accent 
                    needs work. I take the bag now.

      Pedro reaches for the bag, but Julius yanks it away, 
      frowning. He pulls a SHOTGUN from behind the counter.

                                  JULIUS
                    That ain t how it works. Who are 
                    you? Why you want this bag?

                                  PEDRO
                    That is a private matter. Please. I 
                    do not wish to kill you.

                                  JULIUS
                    Kill me?

      Julius racks the shotgun. Pedro sighs, then, lightning-fast, 
      pulls a PISTOL from his pocket, diving in slow-motion... He 
      FIRES. The bullets hit the TV by Julius  head. It EXPLODES.

      Julius dives behind the counter, alarmed, as he FIRES BACK 
      with the shotgun. The blast sends the window into the street- 

      EXT. THRIFT SHOP - DAY2626

      We rejoin Jack and Dan in the street, as Dan runs toward the 
      side of the thrift shop. Jack runs after him.

                    Police! Drop your weapons!

      PEDRO turns, graceful and deadly, guns in both hands, and 
      FIRES. Dan tackles Jack as Pedro fires; TWO NEAT BULLET HOLES 
      appear exactly where their heads were.

      Jack and Dan roll behind a rack of amplifiers. Dan looks up, 
      sees one of the bullets has hit an EZ-STEAM HUMIDIFIER.

      the golf bag. He hits the ground running like a rabbit...

      Dan peeks up from behind the amplifiers as Pedro RUNS OUT 
      AFTER JULIUS. As he goes, HE FIRES at the thrift store s 
      STEEL SECURITY GATE mechanism. The gate falls, blocking the 
      windows and doors. 

      Dan yanks on the security gate, but it won t budge. He looks 
      out at Pedro, who runs after Julius... 

                                  JACK
                    I m calling for backup-

                                  DAN
                    Knock yourself out. I m gonna bust 
                    me some punks.

      Dan runs to the back of the store, where a FIRE ESCAPE LADDER 
      is visible through a back window.

                                  JACK
                    DAN! Dan, get back here-

      But Dan is gone. Jack runs to the phone, dialing, furious...

      EXT. THRIFT SHOP - ROOFTOP - DAY2828

      Dan scrambles onto the roof from the fire escape ladder. FROM 
      HIS POV we see Pedro in the street, firing after Julius as he 
      pulls away in the Mazda.

                                  DAN
                    Hold it right there! Don t move!

      Without breaking stride, Pedro SPINS and FIRES AT DAN. Dan 
      ducks behind an air conditioning unit as he runs...            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             22.


      EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS2929

      Pedro gets into his car, starting it. He looks around. Dan is 
      nowhere to be found, until... WHAM! Dan lands on the hood of 
      the car. It s a hard impact, as painful as it looks.

                                  DAN
                    FREEZE!

      Pedro sighs as he puts the car in gear and hits the gas. Dan 
      looks around, alarmed at the swiftly accelerating car.  

                                  PEDRO
                    You are a brave man. I do not want 
                    to kill you. 

                                  DAN
                    Stop this car, Damnit!

      Pedro shrugs and SLAMS on the brakes. Dan flies off the car. 
      Pedro watches... a beat, and he drives off. FADE TO BLACK.

      INT. LT. ANDERSON S OFFICE - DAY3030

      Anderson sits behind her desk, reading a report. Jack sits 
      with Dan, who is banged up, but in one piece.

                                  LT. ANDERSON
                    So you exchanged fire, then called 
                    for backup after the firefight... 
                    Stark jumped on the hood of the 
                    suspect s car...

                                  DAN
                    It s a start. What we need now is 
                    some of those fancy costumes the 
                    SWAT guys have.

                                  JACK
                    I think what Dan is trying to say 
                    is that some more department 
                    resources would help us move this 
                    case forward-

                                  LT. ANDERSON
                    Actually, I think it s safe to say 
                    this is outside the scope of your 
                    original investigation. I ll take 
                    it from here.

      Jack and Dan share a look, both surprised and unhappy.            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             23.

                    What the hell? You re taking our 
                    case? After all I did for you? 
                    After all I taught you-

                                  LT. ANDERSON
                    This isn t personal, Dan. Now, I d 
                      appreciate it if you would get out 
                    of my office. We re serving a 
                    warrant on Julius Brown s place in 
                    the morning. We ve got work to do.

      Dan glares at Lt. Anderson, then turns to go.

      INT. BAR - NIGHT3131

      Jack and Dan sit in a bar. Dan drinks something green and 
        strong-looking. Jack drinks a beer.

                                  JACK
                    What was that about back there? 
                     All you did  for the Lieutenant?

                                  DAN
                    Me n Kate used to be partners. She 
                    bailed out as soon as she got the 
                    chance. Just like Grady, Quentin, 
                    Franco, LeBarge, D Antonio, and the 
                    rest. It s not like the old days. 
                    Me and Frank, we were... It was 
                    like we were one guy, you know?

                                  JACK
                    You probably don t want to talk 
                    like that when you re drinking a 
                    Midori sour.

                                  DAN
                    Well, if Frank was here, we d be  
                    down at that thrift shop now- 

                                  JACK
                    Dan, we got thrown off the case. 

                                  DAN
                    That means we re doin  a good job!

                                  JACK
                    Good job? We broke damn near every 
                    rule the department has-            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             24.


                                  DAN
                    And we found the bad guys. I know 
                    you think you re just baby sitting 
                    me. I also know this: a real cop 
                    doesn t bail on a case like this. 

                                  JACK
                    So a  real cop  risks his career 
                    for a $45 small appliance? 

                                  DAN
                    There are no... small... crimes. 
                    Only small cops. You put that in 
                    your computer, college boy. You 
                    want to get rid of me? Work on your 
                    precious career? Well, it s not 
                    gonna happen until you grow a pair 
                    and crack some cases.

      Dan looks at Jack for a long moment as this sinks in. Then:

                                  JACK
                    So what do you propose?

                                  DAN
                    We re still on the hudimifier case. 

                                  JACK
                    Our only lead is Julius Brown. And 
                    Julius belongs to Lt. Anderson.

                                  DAN
                    Then she s gonna have to share.

      INT. JULIUS BROWN S HOUSE - MORNING3232

      Julius sits in his living room with the golf bag on the 
      ground as he hastily packs a bag, looking out the window as 
      he dials the phone. 

                                    KALFUSS (ON TELEPHONE)

      Kalfuss lies tied spread-eagle on the dining room table. 
      Pedro holds the phone to his ear.

                    Julius! Thank God. There s a man 
                    here. Talk to him. Please. I ll 
                    give you anything-

      Pedro takes the phone from Kalfuss s ear.

                                  PEDRO
                    Mr. Julius. I was hoping you would 
                    call. Como estas?

                                  JULIUS (ON PHONE)
                    Como estas? Yo soy enojado.

                                  PEDRO
                    You re angry? The verb  ser  is an 
                      identifier. Estoy refers to states 
                    of being. You mean yo estoy 
                    enojado. 
                          (a beat, then:)
                    Give me the golf bag, or I must 
                    hunt you down and kill you. 

                                  JULIUS
                    Give you the golf bag? Uh uh. I 
                    tell you what. You meet me where 
                    and when I say, we negotiate a 
                    finder s fee.

                                  PEDRO 
                    Fine. Where? 

                                  JULIUS
                    I m part owner in a little place 
                    called Sage Hen s Ranch, out in the

      Finally, he dials. A few rings... LIZ answers.

                    sort of important.

      INT. LIZ TOWNSEND S OFFICE - MORNING

      Liz sits in her office, with a mug of coffee. Intercut

                    What is it? Is something wrong?

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    When you and I, um... when we broke 
                    up... why did we break up, exactly? 

                                  LIZ
                    Exactly? Um... as I recall you got 
                    into an argument at my birthday 
                    dinner with a guy who said Einstein 
                    invented the light bulb, and we got 
                    kicked out of the restaurant. 

      IN THE CAR Jack winces at the acutely painful memory. Then:

                                  JACK
                    Yeah, I know that was the actual 
                    day. But on a deeper level, wasn t 
                    it more that you thought I should 
                    take more risks? Be more assertive 
                    with my career?

                                  LIZ
                    Jack. You always do this. Can t it

      INT. JULIUS BROWN S LIVING ROOM - DAY3535

      Lt. Anderson searches the room, talking into a tape recorder. 
      Some CSI guys dust for prints. Clothes and papers are strewn 
      on the floor. It s clear Julius left in a hurry.

                    Hey there, Lieutenant.

                    Um... if memory serves, I took you 
                    off this case yesterday. Have you 
                    been drinking, Detective Stark? 
                      Something... peach-flavored?

                                  DAN
                    It s for the nightmares. Since the 
                    shoot out, every night, it s coming 
                    back to me... 

                                  LT. ANDERSON
                    It happened yesterday, Dan.

                                  DAN
                    I just came by, you know, to try to

                    It s some post-traumatic stress 
                    thing. I can t take a piss without 
                      screaming. I stuck a gun in my 
                    mouth last night, nearly blew my 
                    molars out the back of my skull. 

      Dan falls to his knees sobbing, VOMITS, then passes out. 
      Anderson and looks on, disgusted. She turns to Jack.

                                  DAN
                    Never heard of good cop, sick cop? 
                    When everyone left I poked around. 
                    Got the last number Julius called. 
                    We ask on the street, find someone 
                    who recognizes the number... Should 
                    have an address in a few days.

                                  JACK
                    I ll look it up on the computer. It 
                    can give us the address a little 
                    faster than asking random people on 
                    the street.

      Dan hands a slip of paper with a phone number to Jack.

                                  DAN
                    Pull over again. I need to puke one 
                    more time before we go.

      EXT. KALFUSS S HOUSE - DAY3737

      Jack and Dan stand at the doorway to Kalfuss s house. Dan 
      rings the doorbell. A beat. Nothing. He tries the door...

                                  DAN
                    S open. Let s go in, take a peek.

                                  JACK
                    Dan, anything we  peek  at is 
                      inadmissable in court. We ve got no 
                    probable cause to walk into-

      BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The door SPLINTERS under a HAIL OF BULLETS. 

                                  DAN
                    Howzat for probable?

      Off Jack s look...

                                      ACT THREE

      EXT. KALFUSS S HOUSE - DAY3838

      Jack and Dan are flat on the ground, covering their heads as  
      AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE destroys the door and perforates Jack s car 
      in the driveway. 

                                  DAN
                    You think the lawyers are gonna be 
                    cool if we go in? 

                                  JACK
                    You have no idea who s in there!

      The gunfire stops... Dan peeks around. Grins.

                                  DAN
                    I will soon.

      Dan raises his gun and CHARGES through the door, GUN 
      BLASTING. Jack follows-

      INT. KALFUSS S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS3939

      Pedro DIVES FOR COVER. All around him the room explodes in a 
      rain of bullets from Jack and Dan. Pedro returns fire as he 
      runs to the next room...

      In slow motion, we watch the living room destroyed: The 
      picture windows EXPLODING... The Bose stereo SPLINTERING... 
      The baby grand piano PERFORATING...

      ANGLE ON KALFUSS, still tied to the table in the dining room, 
      screaming in horror.

      Jack and Dan follow Pedro, stopping at the door to the 
      kitchen.

                                  DAN
                    He s empty.
                          (off Jack s look)
                    That s a .45. The clip holds nine 
                    slugs. I counted.

                                  JACK
                    Since when can you count?

      Dan KICKS open the door. 

                                  DAN
                    You re under arre-            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             30.


      There is a high pitched swish as several KITCHEN KNIVES come 
      flying out of the kitchen. One hits Dan in the chest. 

                                  JACK
                    Dan!

      Dan falls, a DARK STAIN spreading on his shirt... 

                                  DAN
                    Go... 

      Furious, glancing back at his fallen comrade, Jack takes 
      Dan s pistol and pulls his own, RUNNING FOR THE DOOR...

      Dan pulls the knife from his chest, and we see it has pierced 
      a small FLASK OF LIQUOR in his pocket, which is leaking.

      INT. KALFUSS S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS4040

      Jack BURSTS into the kitchen, where Pedro stands LOADING his 
      .45 s. A sitting duck. 

      Jack OPENS FIRE, double-fisted... BANG! BANG BANG BANG BANG 
      BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG CLICK CLICK! The pistols RUN DRY.  
      Dust and smoke fill the room. Debris everywhere. 

      In the center of it all stands PEDRO. Untouched. Jack looks 
      at him, incredulous.

                                  JACK
                    Not even one?

                                  PEDRO
                    It s more difficult than it looks, 
                    with two guns. Breath control is 
                    key. Yoga, perhaps, would help.

      With that Pedro raises his own weapons and Jack DUCKS BEHIND 
      THE KITCHEN ISLAND as a hail of gunfire comes his way. Then 
      nothing. He peeks out... Pedro is gone. 

      Jack moves to follow, moving out of the kitchen into a hall.

      INT. KALFUSS S LIVING ROOM - DAY4141

      Jack emerges from the hall into the living room, where they 
      started. He rolls, and brings his gun up into the face of... 
      DAN. Who also has his gun TRAINED ON JACK. A beat.

      Then the sound of a CAR SCREECHING out of the driveway.

      Jack runs to the window... Pedro is gone.             JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             31.


      From behind them, we hear a low moan... they turn and see 
      Kalfuss, tied to the dining room table, near tears.

      INT. KALFUSS S LIVING ROOM - LATER4242

      Jack and Dan sit with Kalfuss in the destroyed living room. 
      Kalfuss is shaking, terrified... 

                                    KALFUSS
                    And then he came back to my house, 
                    tied me up, and waited. He just sat 
                    on the couch with his gun.

                                  JACK
                    Do you have any idea what was in 
                    the golf bag?

                                    KALFUSS
                    God knows what criminals keep in 
                    their golf bags! I m a plastic 
                    surgeon! What do I know about-

                                  DAN
                    Plastic surgeon, huh? You do tits?
                          (jots down a number)
                    I was thinkin  for Eileen... poor 
                    girl got her humidifier stolen. 
                    Maybe it d be nice. You know, like 
                      a surprise. Give her a call. I 
                    figure we saved your life. Least 
                    you could do is throw in a pair of-

                                  JACK
                    Back to the attempted homicide... 
                    any idea where Julius Brown is 
                    meeting the man who tied you up?

      Kalfuss nods at a computer in the corner. Untouched.

                                    KALFUSS
                    He checked Mapquest on my computer. 
                    Shoot him for me, OK? This guy s a 
                      cold-blooded killer.

      INT. INTERNATIONAL PASSENGER ARRIVAL AREA - DAY4343

      Pedro is talking on a cell phone. We hear his conversation, 
      in subtitled Spanish.

                                  PEDRO (IN SPANISH)
                    I will not discuss this. Do as I 
                    say or suffer the consequences.

      Pedro s face hardens, as he listens to the response.            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             32.

                    Then take it away from him. Esteban-

      Pedro scowls - the first time we ve seen him lose his cool.

      INT. PEDRO S HOUSE - INTERCUT4444

      ESTEBAN (15) sits watching TV in a baseball cap and a tee 
      shirt. He watches, annoyed, at his little brother FELIPE (2), 
      who is playing with a fork. 

                                    ESTEBAN
                    It s the only thing he likes. He 
                    cries all the time.

                                  PEDRO
                    It s not safe for him to play with 
                    a fork! He could put it in an 
                    outlet and electrocute himself! 
                    Esteban, if I come home and find 
                    Felipe playing with a fork, I will 
                    shoot the TV with my pistol. 

      Esteban takes the fork from Felipe, who starts crying.

                                    ESTEBAN
                    OK. I did it. He s crying now.

      Esteban puts the phone to Felipe s ear.

                                  PEDRO
                    Hello, mijo. Don t cry. Papa will 
                    bring you a toy.

      Esteban takes back the phone.

                                    ESTEBAN
                    He s still crying.

                                  PEDRO 
                    He s little. Esteban, I must tell 
                    you something. This mission, it is-

                                    ESTEBAN
                      ...dangerous and if you are killed 
                    I must take care of the family now 
                    that mama is gone. Right?

      INT. INTERNATIONAL PASSENGER ARRIVAL AREA - DAY4545

      Pedro looks over at the gate as Romero walks in. Pedro s eyes 
      narrow when he sees who he s with... The BEST ASSASSIN IN THE 
      WORLD.            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             33.


                                  PEDRO
                    Yes. I love you. I have to go.

      Pedro hangs up, nodding to Romero. Romero smiles, eyes hard. 

                                  ROMERO
                    Pedro, you know the Best Assassin 
                    in the World? He was at a film 
                    festival, but now he is available.

                                  PEDRO
                    We have met.

      Pedro glares at The Best Assassin, who stares back. Hate.

                                  ROMERO
                    So. Did you find Escalante s body? 

                                  PEDRO
                    No. There was no time. 

                                  ROMERO
                    Sad. I had hoped to urinate on his 
                    corpse. So. What is the plan?

                                  PEDRO
                    The man with the golf bag is a part 
                    owner in a brothel. We will meet 
                    him there, and get the bag. 

      The three men walk through the airport. The crowds part for 
      them as they go... these guys are scary. FADE TO BLACK.

                    Jack... what, exactly, are you 
                    trying to say?

                                  JACK (O.S.)
                    I m just asking for your legal 
                    opinion. As a district attorney.

                                  LIZ
                    Okaaay... legally, the fact that 
                    you re not officially assigned a 
                    case should not affect prosecution. 
                    Provided all else is in order.

      INT. JACK S CAR - INTERCUT4747

      Jack sits in his car with Dan, driving through the desert in 
      his ruined car as he talks on the phone. 

                                  JACK
                    I didn t say that. 

                                  LIZ (O.S.)
                    Here s a non-legal opinion: don t 
                    work cases you re not assigned to. 
                    You fail, you look stupid. You 
                    succeed, everyone else looks 
                    stupid. It s a terrible career 
                    move.

                                  JACK
                      Appropriate, as I seem to have a 
                    terrible career. Thanks, Liz.

      Jack hangs up, as he and Dan drive into the outskirts of a 
      small desert town. 

                                  DAN
                    I ll never get over that. You used 
                    to date that lady D.A. and you stay 
                    friends with her even after she 
                    hooks up with some rich guy? You 
                    need to stop by the testicle shop, 
                    college boy. I m serious-

                                  JACK
                    You know, telling you about me and 
                    Liz is one of the biggest regrets 
                    of my entire life. She s a friend, 
                    and if you keep talking about it 
                    I ll push you out of the car. Let s 
                    leave it at that.

                    Besides, with what we re doing, we 
                    need all the friends we can get.

                    Ahh, Back in the old days, Frank n 
                    me did this all the time. Being a 
                    cop s not about rules - It s about 
                    people. It s looking Eileen in the 
                    eye and say  I caught the bastard 
                    that stole your hudimifiner.

                    I swore to protect and serve. 

      Jack drives for a long moment, then:

                                  JACK
                    I wanted to say thanks for saving 
                    my life back at the thrift store. 
                    If you hadn t tackled me-

                                  DAN
                    Ooh! Looky there!

      Dan points out the window at a dusty little used car 
      dealership. Among the usual Honda Civics and Datsun 
      hatchbacks is a black 1975 TRANS-AM BANDIT.

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    That s a Trans-Am, just like me n 
                    Frank used to have! Pull over.
                          (off Jack s look)
                    Trade in this crapmobile, and we 
                    could have ourselves a CAR!

                                  JACK
                    We re not buying a Trans-Am.  

      Dan looks back at the car dealership, disappointed, as they 
      continue into the night.

      INT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - NIGHT4848

      A tattered trucker brothel. Women hang around in sexy 
      clothes; men drink at the bar. Julius sits talking to ROGER, 
      an aging biker. Roger is a thoughtful, intelligent man 
      despite his many flaming skull tattoos.

                                  JULIUS
                    Listen, it ll be good. You bring 
                    your biker pals for security. I do 
                    my deal. Five grand.

                                  ROGER
                    Okay, so I get a whole biker gang, 
                    locked and loaded, to watch your 
                    back... For five grand. I think a 
                      percentage seems fairer, don t you? 

                                  JULIUS
                    Okay, uh... six percent.
                          (off his look)
                    It s what real estate agents get. 
                    It s a starting point.            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             36.


                                  ROGER
                    Putting that aside, how about the 
                    cops?

                                  JULIUS
                    Cops? If there are cops, then we 
                    can negotiate-

                                  ROGER
                    No, I m saying, what about those 
                    cops? Right there, behind you.

      Julius turns, alarmed, and sees... JACK AND DAN, walking in, 
      badges ready, guns drawn.

                                  DAN
                    Don t you move, you son of a-

      Julius BOLTS FROM THE TABLE, running toward the back with the 
      golf bag. Jack and Dan run after him...

      EXT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - NIGHT4949

      Julius bursts through the back door with Jack close on his 
      heels. He takes off into the desert. 

                                  JACK
                    FREEZE! NOW!

      Jack runs hard, gaining on Julius and CATCHING HIM. In a 
      series of PRECISE MARTIAL ARTS MOVES, he puts Julius on the 
      ground in a painful arm-bar.

                                  DAN (O.S.)
                    Atta boy! For a moment, I coulda 
                    sworn you were Frank. Where d you 
                    learn that fancy ninja stuff?

      Jack turns and sees Dan at the back door of the brothel,  
      surrounded by scantily clad women.

      Dan pulls some cuffs... 

                                  DAN
                    Whatever. Let s round this punk up. 
                    We got a golf bag to open.

                                        ACT FOUR

      INT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - BEDROOM - LATER5050

      A Sage Hen s  party room.  Lots of pink, velvet, and lace. A 
      large mirror on the ceiling. Julius is handcuffed to the bed, 
      which conveniently has a designated place for handcuffs.

      Dan carefully aims his gun at the golf bag s lock, and FIRES.  
      A BULLET RICOCHETS and shatters a mirror by Julius  head.

                                  JULIUS
                    Cut that out, man! 

      Jack runs in from the hallway alarmed; he is on the phone. 

                                  JACK
                    DAN! What are you-

                                  DAN
                    I m investigating.

                                  JACK (ON PHONE)
                      Everything s fine, Lieutenant. I ll 
                    call you in a minute.

      Jack hangs up, angry.

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    I m on the phone trying to save our 
                    asses, and you re SHOOTING THE 
                    EVIDENCE WITH YOUR PISTOL?

                                  DAN
                    Evidence? We don t even know what 
                    the Hell it is. The brass is on the 
                    way. We gotta move the ball up the 
                    field before they get here.

      Dan FIRES at the golf bag again, which falls over and OPENS. 
      Stacks of CASH tumble out. Jack, Dan, and Julius stare... 

                                  JULIUS
                    I was gonna sell that for a hundred 
                    grand. Damn.

                                  JACK
                    Sell it? To who?

                                  JULIUS
                    I don t know the dude! You were 
                    there... He just showed up in my 
                    store, corrected my Spanish, and 
                    tried to shoot me.             JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             38.


                                  DAN
                    You best tell us where you got the 
                    bag. Because if you don t, college 
                    boy here is going to figure it out 
                    anyway with his computer, and I m 
                    going to hit you in the mouth.

                                  JULIUS
                    All I know is it belongs to a dead 
                    guy. He was in the trunk of a car I 
                    dumped for that doctor. He s gone, 
                    and he ain t coming back.

      Off Dan s look, we SMASH CUT TO:

      EXT. MEXICAN GORGE - DAY5151

      Escalante s Pontiac Sunfire lies crumpled at the bottom of a 
      gorge in Mexico. A title reads: Mexico. Two Days Earlier.

      From inside the trunk, a thump. Another thump, and the trunk 
      opens. Escalante emerges, in a surgical gown, screaming.

                                  ESCALANTE
                        AAAAAAAUUUUUGGHHH!!!!

      Birds fly into the sky. Escalante climbs out of the trunk, 
      looking around, bewildered. He sees the crumpled Pontiac, 
      sees the reflection of his mangled face in a side mirror.

                                  ESCALANTE (CONT D)
                      AAAAAAAUUUUGH!!!!

      Escalante pulls a picture of Erik Estrada from a pile of 
        bloodstained pictures in the bottom of the trunk. He looks at 
      the picture. Looks at his reflection.  

                                  ESCALANTE (CONT D)
                      Revenge...

      Grimacing, he takes a pistol from the trunk. He looks up at 
      the wall of the steep gorge... And begins to climb.

      EXT. MEXICAN HIGHWAY - MORNING5252

      Escalante stumbles along the side of the road, his clothes 
      filthy and torn. His mangled face is grim, determined.

      Escalante sees a car on the horizon. A yellow Pontiac 
      Sunfire. He stares at it in disbelief, waving it down. It 
      pulls to a stop. A TOURIST, pokes his head out the window...

                                    TOURIST
                    You need something, buddy?            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             39.


      Escalante puts the pistol to the tourist s forehead. 

                                  ESCALANTE
                    Get out of the car.

      INT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - DAY5353

      The front room of the Sage Hen s Ranch is filled with police.  
      Jack sits at a table with Lt. Anderson...

                                  LT. ANDERSON
                    What the hell were you thinking, 
                    letting Dan Stark pursue this case?

                                  JACK
                    We recovered $3 million in drug 
                    money. Have you ever considered Dan 
                    might be right about some things? I 
                    mean, ever since he and Frank-

                                  LT. ANDERSON
                    Do you know what happened to Frank 
                    Savage? Ever wonder why he s not 
                    still in the department like Dan?

                                  JACK
                    I heard it was a nervous condition-

                                  LT. ANDERSON
                    Dan got him to jump out a car 
                    window when they went after the 
                      governor s kid. Frank had a nervous 
                      breakdown... he teaches art to 
                    retarded kids now.

      She closes her eyes, shuddering... She recovers, then:

                                  LT. ANDERSON (CONT D)
                    You want to stay on the case? Fine. 
                    But Dan goes home. Now.

      Dan emerges from the back area of Sage Hens in a bathrobe.

                                  DAN
                    What d I miss?

      INT. DR. KALFUSS S OFFICE - DAY5454

      Kalfuss sits in his office, haggard and bruised. He tries to 
      put a good face on as he talks to a very confused Eileen.

                                  EILEEN
                    You re just calling me out of the 
                    blue and offering me a boob job?            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             40.


                                    KALFUSS
                    It was Detective Stark s idea. He 
                    wanted it to be a surprise.

      Eileen s eyes well up. She is deeply touched.

                                  EILEEN
                    Dan? Really? That is so sweet. It s 
                    like the perfect post-feminist 
                    gift, isn t it?

                                    KALFUSS
                    Right. So, uh... we just need to 
                    schedule the procedure. Have you 
                    thought at all about-

      From OS, there is the CRASH of some glass breaking. Kalfuss 
      looks up, hesitating.

                                    KALFUSS (CONT D)
                    I should just see what-

      Suddenly the GLASS DOOR of Kalfuss s office SHATTERS, and 
      ESCALANTE BURSTS IN. He twists his scarred face into a 
      horrifying grimace as he points his gun at Kalfuss.

                                  ESCALANTE
                    You think you can kill me, yes? 
                    Kill me, and steal my money?

                                    KALFUSS
                    WAIT! WAIT, YOU DON T UNDERSTAND! 

                                  ESCALANTE
                    YOU PUT ME IN THE TRUNK OF A CAR 
                    AND PUSHED IT OFF A MOUNTAIN!

      Escalante cocks his pistol, levelling it at Kalfuss. Eileen 
      looks on, stunned and terrified.

                                  ESCALANTE (CONT D)
                    Where is my golf bag?

                                    KALFUSS
                    It was in the car! I paid a guy 
                    named Julius to dump it. The cops 
                    are after him, and, uh... a man 
                    from your country. Pedro? 

      A flicker of concern on Escalante s face. 

                                  ESCALANTE
                    Pedro? The thing with the gun...            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             41.


                                    KALFUSS
                    You can follow them! I can tell you 
                    where they went. You can take her 
                    as a hostage!!

                                  EILEEN
                    What? What are you-

                                    KALFUSS
                    She s the girlfriend of one of the 
                    cops! Please... just take her. Get 
                    your golf bag. Then I ll fix your 
                    face! You ll look just like Erik 
                    Estrada, I swear.

      Escalante gazes at his reflection in the mirror on the 
      wall... Thinks for a moment. Then turns to Eileen.

                                  ESCALANTE
                    You. Come with me.

      INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT5555

      Jack and Dan sit in a diner. Dan looks at his phone, annoyed.

                                  DAN
                    I was kinda hoping I d get a call 
                    from Eileen. See what she thought 
                    of my little present. She was 
                    s posed to talk to that doctor...

                                  JACK
                    Listen, Dan. I talked to the 
                      Lieutenant. She wants you off the 
                    case. For real this time.

                                  DAN 
                    C mon, Jack... working a case is 
                    like riding a horse. You get thrown 
                    off, you gotta climb right back on. 

                                  JACK
                    Not us, Dan. You. I m staying on. 

                                  DAN
                    What? What the hell are you taking 
                    about? Jack, partners don t stab 
                    each other in the back-  

                                  JACK
                    I m not stabbing you! Dan, this is

                    The only reason there s a case at 
                    all is I dragged you here kicking 
                    and screaming! So you know some 
                    fancy  evidence rules  and you can 
                    work a computer machine! I was 
                    busting punks before you were born-

                                  JACK
                    So? At this point I wouldn t trust 
                    you to bust a Goddamn balloon!

                                  DAN
                    Frank never woulda done this. Frank-

                    HE HAD A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN BECAUSE 
                    YOU CONVINCED HIM TO JUMP OUT THE 
                    WINDOW OF A MOVING CAR!

      Dan blinks. That hurt. A long moment... then Dan gets up and 
      walks out of the restaurant. Jack watches him go. CUT TO:

      INT. ROMERO S MOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER5656

      Romero walks into the motel room in his pajamas and slippers. 
      Pedro and The Best Assassin sit glaring at each other. 

                                  ROMERO
                    I take this bed. You two take that 
                    one. It will be the assassin bed. 

                                  PEDRO
                    I am fine with the chair.

                                  ROMERO
                    Pedro. How will you do the thing 
                    with the gun, if you do not sleep? 
                    Be ready, because tomorrow, if I do 
                    not get the golf bag? I will kill 
                    your sons. Esteban and baby Felipe.

      The Best Assassin smiles at this. Pedro s fists clench. 

                                  ROMERO (CONT D)
                    I like to give clear incentives for 
                    my employees. Goodnight.

      Pedro sits in the darkness, his gun ready.

                                        ACT FIVE

      INT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - DAY5757

      Julius sits in the Sage Hen s bar with the golf bag, wearing 
      a large orange sweatshirt with  Vegas, Baby!  written across 
      the front in sparkly letters. He looks over at Jack, sitting 
      a couple of tables away.

                                  JULIUS
                    Do I really have to wear this?

                                  JACK
                    It s the only thing big enough to 
                    hide a bulletproof vest. We went 
                    over this, okay? Just stay cool, do 
                    the deal. We ll be listening in the 
                    back on a wire. If there s any 
                    trouble-

                                  JULIUS
                    Trouble? Like me getting my ass 
                    shot off?

                                  JACK
                    Not likely, but that s what the 
                    vest is for. If there s any 
                    trouble, we ll move in.

                                  JULIUS
                    Where s that other cop, the one 
                    that smells like peppermint 
                    schnapps? I want a second opinion.

                                  JACK
                    He s... not around. It ll be fine.

      Jack looks out at the window, a flicker of concern crossing 
      his face... DISSOLVE TO:

      INT. GAS STATION MINI-MART - DAY5858

      A little gas station mini-mart. A CLERK behind the counter. A 
      beat, and Dan walks in, walks to the counter.

                                  DAN
                    A quart of whatever s strongest.

      The Clerk nods, takes a bottle of Bacardi 151 from under the 
      counter, scans it with a  beep ... Dan watches, misty-eyed.

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    Howzat work? The laser thing?            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             44.


                                  CLERK
                    It reads the bar code, I guess.

                                  DAN
                    Man. You wake up one day and it s 
                    all lasers and robots and people 
                    shaving places they didn t used to 
                    shave. Y know?

                                  CLERK
                    Yep. That ll be 25.72.

      Dan digs in his pants pocket, pulls out some bills... 

                                  DAN
                    I got, uh... $17. Say I throw this 
                    in and we call it even?

      He puts his DETECTIVE BADGE on the counter.

                                  CLERK
                      A detective badge?

                                  DAN
                    Gotta be worth a few bucks.

      They are interrupted by a MUFFLED SCREAM from outside. Dan 
      looks, curious... RACK FOCUS TO a car getting gas outside: 
      It s ESCALANTE. Eileen is bound with duct tape in the 
      passenger seat. Her eyes meet Dan s as she screams again.

      Escalante points his gun at her and she shuts up. He gets 
      into the car, oblivious to Dan watching from the mini-mart. 

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    Son of a bitch!

      Dan SNATCHES HIS BADGE BACK and runs out...

      EXT. STREET - DAY5959

      Dan runs into the street as Escalante turns a corner.

                                  DAN
                    HEY! STOP!!

      Too late. Desperate, he looks around... ANGLE ON the car 
      dealership they passed the day before. The TRANS-AM.

      INT. ESCALANTE S SUNFIRE - CONTINUOUS6060

      Escalante drives, twisting his scarred face into a grim smile 
      as he looks at some Mapquest directions. Eileen glances 
      behind them, clearly searching for Dan...             JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             45.


                                  ESCALANTE
                    Almost there.
                          (to Eileen)
                    You know, soon I will be a rich 
                    man. And once my surgery is done, I 
                    will be very attractive. Maybe you 
                    leave your boyfriend for me, no? 

      Escalante laughs. Eileen forces a laugh, terrified.

                                  ESCALANTE (CONT D)
                    WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT! SHUT UP!

      Eileen is quiet. A beat, then:

                                  ESCALANTE (CONT D)
                    So. What is your job, before you 
                    were my hostage? 

                                  EILEEN
                    I m- I m a flight attendant.

                                  ESCALANTE
                    When I am rich, I will fly first 
                    class. You can bring me a mimosa.

      Eileen stares at Escalante, who is clearly going insane. 

                                  ESCALANTE (CONT D)
                    YOU WILL BRING ME A MIMOSA!!

                                  EILEEN
                    Please, let me out. I can talk to 
                    them for you, maybe-

                                  ESCALANTE
                    No, it is better this way. I get my 
                    money, or I take us both to Hell.

      He pats her knee as the car continues into the desert. 

      INT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - DAY6161

      Julius sits with the golf bag as the door opens and ROMERO 
      enters with PEDRO and THE BEST ASSASSIN. Julius nods to 
      Pedro, and the three converge at a table. 

                                  JULIUS
                    Buenos dias. Como estas?

                                  PEDRO
                    Your Spanish is coming along well. 
                    This is my employer. The bag you 
                    have belongs to him.            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             46.


      Julius nods at Romero. Romero nods back...

                                  JULIUS
                    I gotta ask... why a golf bag?

                                  ROMERO
                    I had it made. When people see a 
                    golf bag, they don t look too hard.

      INT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS6262

      Jack sits with Lt. Anderson and the other cops, listening on 
      headphones...

      INT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - CONTINUOUS6363

      ANGLE ON Pedro, who scans the room. He looks at Julius  
      sweatshirt, frowns...

                                  ROMERO
                    Pedro, check the bag.

      Pedro opens the bag... he checks inside.

                                  PEDRO
                          (in Spanish)
                    Looks like it s all here.

                                  JULIUS
                    Right. So... let s talk about my 
                    finders fee?

                                  ROMERO
                    Ah, yes. Your money.

                                  JULIUS
                    Yeah. I was thinking a hundred k...

                                  ROMERO
                    I have a better idea.

      Romero SHOOTS JULIUS IN THE CHEST. Julius goes SPRAWLING...

      A beat, and Jack and Lt. Anderson burst through the door, 
      guns drawn...

                                  JACK
                    POLICE! FREEZE!! PUT DOWN YOUR 
                    WEAPONS-

      Instantly, the room EXPLODES WITH GUNFIRE as Pedro and the 
      Best Assassin fire at the back room, driving the cops back...            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             47.


      JACK AND LT. ANDERSON dive for cover as Pedro and the Best 
      Assassin take up positions at opposite ends of the room. 

      Romero runs for the door with the golf bag.

      Julius, meanwhile, lies on the floor, with a bullet hole in 
      his sweatshirt, yelling...

                                  JULIUS 
                    I knew it! I knew I d get shot! 

      Pedro and The Best Assassin continue BLASTING AWAY. Each 
      amazing. Pedro kicks a table over to block the door, leaving 
      Jack and Anderson cut off from the rest of the cops...

      Jack manages to reach out and grab Julius, dragging him 
      behind some furniture and under cover... 

      EXT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - DAY6464

      Romero emerges from the bar, running for his car. He is 
      almost at the car, when he hears a noise at the other end of 
      the parking lot. He looks up, curious...

      INT. ESCALANTE S SUNFIRE - CONTINUOUS6565

      Escalante ROARS into the PARKING LOT, Eileen at his side. 
      From his POV, we see Romero at the car with the golf bag. 
      Escalante grins. His dreams have come true.

                                  ESCALANTE
                    Romero...

      EXT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - PARKING LOT - DAY6666

      Romero sees the Sunfire SCREAMING TOWARD HIM. He squints at 
      the driver, in shocked disbelief:

                                  ROMERO
                      Escalante?

      WHAM! Romero is CREAMED by Escalante s car. Inside, Escalante 
      howls with triumph as he jams the car into reverse. The car 
      thumps over Romero s body again... 

      INT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - DAY6767

      Jack, still PINNED DOWN. Through the front window, Jack sees 
      Escalante, with Eileen tied up in the Sunfire...

      He looks for a path to the door, but PEDRO AND THE BEST 
      ASSASSIN have them completely pinned down. Pedro looks out at 
      Escalante. He frowns, disapproving...             JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             48.


      BACK TO JACK, who looks through the bullet-riddled bar. He 
      SEES PEDRO S EXPRESSION. He thinks, weighing some decision...

      EXT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - PARKING LOT - DAY6868

      Romero is on the ground, his hand clutching the golf bag in a 
      death grip. Escalante begins kicking Romero again and again. 

                                  ESCALANTE
                    That is for taking my frequent 
                    flyer miles! That is for calling me 
                    your chihuahua at Hernan s wedding- 

      Escalante continues kicking and screaming unintelligibly. 

      INT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - DAY6969

      Jack stares out the window at the scene. He s got to get to 
      Eileen. To Julius:

                                  JACK
                    Will you cover me?

                                  JULIUS
                    With what, my winning smile?

      A beat. Jack holds up his gun. Offering it. Lt. Anderson 
      watches Jack in disbelief from the bar...

                                  LT. ANDERSON
                    Jack. Do not give the suspect your 
                    weapon-

      A bullet ZANGS! off the metal bar behind her, and she ducks. 
      Jack looks through the window, where Escalante is getting 
      back in the car with the golf bag. He looks at Julius, who 
      TAKES THE GUN. Cocks it. Ready. He peeks out...

                                  JACK
                    On three. One, two, three!

      Julius and Jack SPRING UP, simultaneously. Julius SHOOTING, 
      Jack RUNNING for the door...

      Pedro and The Best Assassin spin towards Julius, FIRING...

      Julius ducks back down behind the bar with Lt. Anderson. The 
      bar is shredded by gunfire. Jack is almost at the door, when-

      CLICK. The sound of Pedro s gun. Trained on Jack s head.

      Jack looks at Pedro. Waiting for death. He looks out the 
      window at Escalante driving with Eileen. Then, simply:            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             49.


                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Please. Let me save her.

      Pedro stares. Jack stares back. Something passing between 
      them. The Best Assassin looks at Pedro...

      And suddenly, Pedro and the Best Assassin SPIN TOWARDS EACH 
      OTHER, weapons up. A STAND-OFF. Pedro mutters to Jack:

                                  PEDRO
                    Go.

      Jack bolts. Pedro and the Best Assassin don t move. A final 
      showdown. Julius peeks over a table to watch. Excited.

                                  JULIUS
                    Oh, man. It s on, now...

      EXT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - DAY7070

      Jack emerges from the ranch. He looks around, desperate for 
      some way to follow Escalante. Nothing. He keys his radio:

                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    Backup! I need backup here! Are 
                    there any units available-

      Cut off by the LOW GROWL of a BIG ENGINE...

      ANGLE ON DAN. At the wheel of the Trans-Am. Grinning.

      INT. ESCALANTE S SUNFIRE - CONTINUOUS7171

      Escalante drives like a maniac down the desert highway; cars 
      swerve to stay out of his way... Eileen screams as they 
      barely miss a SEMI, weaving through the traffic.

      INT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - CONTINUOUS7272

      Pedro and The Best Assassin are locked in a double Mexican 
      standoff. No one moves. Julius watches, fascinated.

                                  JULIUS
                    I read about this kind of thing. 
                    Kinda like the Samurai in ancient 
                    Japan. See, a killing machine s got 
                    a whole different mind set-

      Lt. Anderson looks at Julius, incredulous...            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             50.


      EXT. FREEWAY - DAY7373

      Back to the chaos of the chase. Escalante weaves through 
      traffic, narrowly missing three cars as he drives on THE 
      WRONG SIDE OF THE MEDIAN STRIP.

      INT. TRANS-AM - CONTINUOUS7474

      Dan turns to Jack as he eyes Escalante on the other side of 
      the freeway. He CRANKS THE WHEEL, launching the Trans-Am over 
      the median. It comes down BONE-CRUNCHINGLY HARD in a shower 
      of sparks...

      INT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - DAY7575

      Back to Pedro and The Best Assassin. No movement. 

      Then the Best Assassin makes a SLIGHT STEP to the left. Pedro 
      MIRRORS this instantly. Julius grins, excited:

                                  JULIUS
                    See that? My man mirrors the move, 
                    so that sunglasses dude don t get 
                    the drop on him with an angle.

      Lt. Anderson looks up, a little curious... it s true. Pedro 
      mirrors The Best Assassin s slightest twitch. Silent.

      EXT. FREEWAY - DAY7676

      The Trans-Am gains on the smaller Sunfire, both cars weaving 
      through traffic.

      INSIDE THE SUNFIRE, Escalante pulls his pistol and FIRES at 
      an approaching FRUIT TRUCK, which SWERVES... And TIPS OVER as 
      they pass, sending a cascade of TANGERINES onto the road. 
      It s the IMAGE FROM THE OPENING, tangerines rolling along... 

      INSIDE THE TRANS-AM, Dan hits the gas, and they pull up 
      alongside the Sunfire. 

      INSIDE THE SUNFIRE, Eileen sees who is at the wheel...

                                  EILEEN
                    Dan...

                                  ESCALANTE
                    That is your boyfriend?

      He FIRES out the window at the Trans-Am... 

                                  ESCALANTE (CONT D)

      INT. SAGE HEN S RANCH - CONTINUOUS7777

      Back to Pedro and The Best Assassin. Lt. Anderson is watching 
      openly, now. Enthralled.

                                  LT. ANDERSON
                    How long can they stay like that?

                                  JULIUS
                    Hours. Days, maybe. They re waiting 
                    for a tiny advantage. Then it s 
                    gonna be over just... like... that.

      He SNAPS HIS FINGERS to prove the point. As he does ALL FOUR 
      GUNS ROAR. Julius and Lt. Anderson dive behind tables... 
      silence.

      On Pedro and the Best Assassin. Neither has moved. The Best 
      Assassin stands there, stonefaced... then CRUMPLES to the 
      floor. DEAD. Pedro turns to Lt. Anderson. Drops his guns. 

                                  PEDRO
                    I wish to go home.

      INT. TRANS-AM - DAY7878

      Jack turns to Dan, desperate...

                                  JACK
                    He s going to kill her before we 
                    can get him off the road.

                                  DAN
                    Yeah. Unless...

      Dan looks at Jack, hesitating... Jack realizes what Dan is 
      not saying. He looks out the window, then unbuckles his seat 
      belt. For the first time, Dan Stark looks really scared...

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    Jack-

                                  JACK
                    It s okay.

      Dan hands Jack his .45 and hits the gas.

      ANGLE ON - the SPEEDOMETER, which reads 95 mph.

      Dan grips the wheel, desperate to hold it steady...

      Jack gets on the seat. Moment of truth...            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             52.


                                  JACK (CONT D)
                    AAAUUUGH!

      Jack LEAPS FROM THE WINDOW OF THE Trans-Am...

      Dan, holding his breath...

      Escalante, stunned to see a man flying towards him...

      WHAM! As Jack FLIES through the window onto Escalante.

      INT. ESCALANTE S SUNFIRE - CONTINUOUS7979

      The tiny compact car is a confusion of limbs and grunting, as 
      Jack wrestles with Escalante, trying to pry the gun out of 
      his hand, and Eileen struggles to help with bound hands.

      BLAM! Escalante FIRES the .45 into the dashboard. The AIRBAG 
      DEPLOYS, adding to the confusion as Jack struggles to pry the 
      gun out of Escalante s hand. Eileen knees Escalante in the 
      face with a vicious CRUNCH...

      IN THE TRANS-AM, Dan watches the Sunfire SWERVING ALL OVER 
      THE ROAD, careening toward a MOUNTAIN UP AHEAD. 

      Dan grips the front of the steering wheel, edging the Trans-
      Am toward the front of the Sunfire. Rapidly running out of 
      road... He JERKS the brake hard as he turns.

      With a SPECTACULAR SHOWER OF SPARKS and GRINDING OF METAL, 
      the TRANS-AM AND THE SUNFIRE LOCK TOGETHER, screeching along 
      the road... And grind to a stop INCHES FROM THE MOUNTAIN 
      ROCK.

      A moment, and the door of the Trans-Am opens. Dan struts to 
      the Sunfire, his mojo back. He looks in at Eileen.

                                  DAN
                    Hey there. You all right?

      Eileen nods as he helps her out of the car. He peers at Jack, 
      who sits in the drivers seat with a bloody nose, crumpled 
      under an unconscious Escalante. He grins.

                                  DAN (CONT D)
                    Nice work, partner. You re 
                    learning.

                                        ACT SIX

      INT. LIZ S OFFICE - SOME TIME LATER8080

      Jack and Dan sit in Liz s office with a very unhappy looking 
      Lt. Anderson. Liz talks to the three of them, uncomfortable.

                                  LIZ
                    I wanted you all here because the 
                    case is... challenging, shall we 
                    say. What with three suspects that 
                    were shot, the other suspect that 
                    was run over, and the $1.5 million 
                    in property damage. But I do see 
                    here that we had... one arrest.

                                  DAN
                    It was a good one, though.

                                  LIZ
                    Escalante is testifying against the 
                    cartel. Julius Brown, however, gets 
                    to walk. You violated over thirty 
                      procedural rules. That s a record.

                                  DAN
                    Better we keep him as a snitch, 
                    anyhow. We get a medal, or what? 

                                  LT. ANDERSON
                    A medal? This morning, the FBI and 
                    the DEA both called to scream at me 
                    for letting two local property 
                    crimes detectives get involved with 
                    an international drug case. Your 
                    reward is you keep your jobs.

                                  JACK
                    Will we be reassigned? I would 
                      understand, under the circumstances-

                                  LT. ANDERSON
                    No, I think it s best you stay in 
                    property crimes. For now. And the 
                      foreseeable future.

      Lt. Anderson walks out, leaving Liz and Jack alone. Liz looks 
      Jack... Then, quietly: 

                                  LIZ
                      Completely unofficially and totally 
                    off the record? Nice work, Jack. 

      She smiles. A tiny thing... that means everything to Jack.            JACK & DAN   "Pilot"   Network Draft   9/29/09             54.


      EXT. POLICE STATION - PARKING LOT - DAY8181

      Jack catches up with Dan as they walk to the ruined Trans-Am. 

                                  DAN
                    I thought we d go down and talk to 
                    Julius. See if he s got any leads.

                                  JACK
                    Leads on what?

                                  DAN
                    Whatever. Leads. You know.

                                  JACK
                    Sounds... great. 

      Jack sighs. Dan fishes in his pocket, remembering something.

                                  DAN
                    Oh, hey... This came in the mail.

      Dan hands Jack a letter written in small, neat script. The 
      return address is Cuzco, Peru. In V.O., we hear Pedro:

                                  PEDRO (V.O.)
                    I am not a man of many words, but I 
                    feel the need to send this to you. 
                    In all of my years as an assassin - 
                    first as the second best in the 
                    world, and now as the first - I 
                    have seen much. But never have I 
                      encountered men such as yourselves. 
                    I have returned to my country, 
                    where I will tell my children of 
                    the bravery and honor of the two 
                    American police, Dan and Jack. 
                      Sincerely, Pedro.

      Jack looks in the envelope, and finds a picture of Pedro, 
      with Esteban and Felipe. Felipe holds a fork, smiling. Jack 
      smiles despite himself, tucking the letter in his pocket.

                                  DAN
                    You ready to go bust some punks?

                                  JACK
                    Yeah. Let s go bust some punks.

      They get into the beat-up Trans-Am. It roars to life, tires 
      squealing on the pavement as we... FADE TO BLACK.
