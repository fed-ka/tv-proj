	FADE IN:

1	INT.  DAILY PLANET - PIT - NIGHT #1			1

	Pandemonium:  everyone yelling, rushing, paper-shuffling
	at once.  An electrician balanced on a ladder re-wires 
	a ceiling fixture.  LOIS, CLARK, CAT and others gather 
	around a sketch artist's drawing table to one side of the 
	room.  In the eye of this hurricane stands PERRY WHITE.
	JIMMY passes carrying a stack of computer print-outs.

				PERRY
		Olsen!  Where are your blow-ups of			*
		Superman?

				JIMMY
		Lab's backed up.  Turnaround might
		be a couple of hours.

				PERRY
		Turnaround!  Great shades of 
		Elvis!  What are we, Daily Planet 
		newspeople or second stringers 
		for the Weehawken Gazette?!

	Perry's voice has risen to a thunderous crescendo.  The 
	newsroom falls nearly silent.

				PERRY (CONT'D)
		Staff meeting.  Tomorrow.  Six a.m.
			(glaring at Jimmy)
		with blow-ups.

	Perry enters his office, slams the door.



	Rev. 7/7/93 (Blue)			2.

2	BY DRAWING TABLE					2

	The knot of people surrounding the artist, STAN, an over-
	weight, over-worked guy in his early fifties, have leaned in
	for a better view.


3	CLOSEUP - SKETCHPAD				3

	A rough drawing of Superman's face.  Stan fills in the 
	eye shade.  PULL BACK TO:

				LOIS
		No! The color's wrong!

				CAT
		More almond-shaped.

				STAN
		You said 'brown.'

				LOIS
		Not brown brown.  Not dull,
		insipid mud brown...
			(as Clark is leaning
			 next to her)
		... like Clark's.  No offense,
		Clark.

				CLARK
		Mud?

				LOIS
		More vibrant, more radiant.

				CAT
		Bedroom eyes.

	Jimmy has joined them.  In the b.g., by the coffee machine, 
	an office worker sets a full pot of coffee on the top warmer 
	and begins to make a second pot.  In doing so, she jostles 
	the machine and the pot on top slips to the edge.  She looks
	for a new filter, can't find one, digs in the cabinet below.

				JIMMY
		But if he is an alien, maybe he 
		doesn't get the old ... you know, 
		itch.

				CAT
		One way to find out.

					(CONTINUE)



	Rev. 7/7/93 (Blue)			3.

3	CONTINUED:						3

				LOIS
		A possible visitor from another
		planet arrives on Earth and all
		you can think of is hauling him 
		off to your lair and trying him
		out?

				CAT
		Test drive, Lois.  A couple hours
		behind the wheel, I'd know for 
		sure if we're talking import or
		domestic.

	Lois rolls her eyes, then notices what Stan is drawing.

				LOIS
		No!  The features are too coarse.
		Think noble.  Think ... Greek God.

				STAN
			(lost)
		Greek God?

				LOIS
		Let's take it a feature at a time.
		For example, the chin.  Square, 
		but not plain.  The chin of a man
		who stands for something.  And the
		nose.  Definite, but not
		overbearing.

	Stan's more confused than ever.  Clark's right next to him.
	He's watching the pot of hot coffee move nearer and nearer
	the edge as the office worker still searches for filters.
	Also, the electrician on the ladder strains to reach some-
	thing... the ladder wobbles.

				STAN
		Like Clark's?

				LOIS
			(disgusted)
		This is Superman we're talking
		about.  Not some Tom, Dick, or ...

				CLARK
			(annoyed)
		You know, he didn't seem that
		special to me.  Except for the
		flying and the uniform, he could
		have been any ordinary guy.

					(CONTINUED)


	Rev. 7/7/93 (Blue)			4.

3	CONTINUED:  (2)					3

	Lois is fed up.  Doesn't anybody see it but her?  The pot
	begins to fall.  The ladder begins to topple.  Clark takes
	a step back so he's behind the group.  No one's watching
	him.

				LOIS
		Ordinary?  Give me a break.

	At SUPER SPEED Clark moves first to the coffee machine --
	catches the pot, settles it back on top -- next to the 
	ladder and steadies it.  He then grabs a donut off a
	tray and returns to his place unnoticed.

				LOIS (Cont'd)
			(to Stan)
		What we've got here is an example
		of human evolution: 'before and
		after.' Clark is the 'before.'
		Superman is the 'after.'

	She looks again at Clark:  donut in his mouth, tie askew,
	hair tousled, suit wrinkled from his back and forth trip.
	In the b.g., the office worker has found her filter.

				LOIS (Cont'.d)
		Make that:  way, way after.

					FADE OUT.

				ACT ONE

	FADE IN:

4	EXT. SKYSCRAPER CORNICE - SEEN THRU BINOCULARS - DAY #2	4

	Pigeons roosting. We hear soft WARBLING. Binoculars
	MOVE UPWARD and the IMAGE BLURS, COMES TO REST ON ...


5	A HAWK						5	*

	soaring on the updrafts above the Metropolis skyline.
	Suddenly, with a SCREECH, it drops like an arrow.
	Binoculars MOVE DOWN, IMAGE BLURS TO...


6	SKYSCRAPER CORNICE				6

	We're already too late. Pigeon feathers drift on the
	morning air.


7	EXT. LUTHOR'S BALCONY - DAY			7

	LUTHOR lowers the binoculars, smiles, turns to where Asabi
	stands by the breakfast table: white linen cloth, sterling
	silver service, O.J. fresh squeezed, coffee fresh brewed.
	Luthor's smile widens; all's right with his world.  He seats
	himself.  Asabi provides a napkin.  Two beautiful JAPANESE
	WOMEN, clad in rec: silk dresses slit up one side, appear and
	bow.  They hold between them a pogo stick.  Luthor nods to
	them, nods to Asabi, who hands them each a perfect white rose.

				JAPANESE WOMEN
			(musically, in unison)
		Domo arigato.

				LUTHOR
		Do itashi mashte.

	They bow again, denart.  Asabi pours coffee, uncovers a
	chafing dish of baked squab, serves, steps back.  Luthor
	rifles through his stack of morning newspapers.  A slight
	frown creases his forehead.

				LUTHOR (Cont'd)
		Superman... Superman...
		Superman... Superman...

	He drops the papers, looks at Asabi.

				LUTHOR (Cont'd)
		Calendar.

	Asabi hands over an ornate leather appointment book.
	Every hour of the day is scheduled, except ...

				LUTHOR (Cont'd)
		Lois Lane cancelled lunch?

	Luthor looks at Asabi, who nervously looks away.  Luthor,
	frown deepening, punches buttons on his speaker phone.  A
	RING, ANOTHER, then...

				LOIS (O.S.)
			(answering machine)
		Hi. You've reached the desk of
		Lois Lane.  Leave a message at
		the tone, but don't expect a
		call back unless it's about
		Superman.  Have a great day.

	BEEP.  Luthor hangs up.  The ambiance of the morning is
	shattered.  The hawk glides into the balcony and
	settles onto its perch behind Luthor's chair.  Lex
	turns a dark look in its direction.

					CUT TO:


8	INT.  DAILY PLANET - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY			8

	The room is full of reporters, sitting, standing: a war
	council.  Clark sits next to Lois, Cat is across from them.
	Perry examines a line of less-than-crystal-clear blow-ups
	of Superman (tacked to one wall) with a magnifying glass.
	Jimmy stands next to him.

				PERRY
		Jimmy, these are no good!

				JIMMY
		They're okay.

				PERRY
		'Okay?!' 'Okay' doesn't cut it at
		this newspaper.
			(beat)
		Go on, sit down.

	Jimmy does.  Perry sets the glass down, calls the meeting to
	order by RAPPING on the wood.

				PERRY
			(falsely warm:smile)
		How're y'all doing this morning?
		Sleep well?

		I didn't.  Last night after work

		Question was, how come the Daily

		Superman story after it literally
		dropped in our laps?

			(beat)
		Are we clear on this?

				LOIS
			(dismayed)
		No. Perry, you can't be serious.
		I was the one Superman flew with.
		I wrote the original piece. I
		found him!

				CLARK
		Actually, he found you.

				LOIS
		Put a sock in it, Kent.
			(pleading to Perry)
		Chief, this isn't fair.  I should
		have the exclusive on the follow-
		up.  Those are the rules.

				PERRY
		The rules are off.  This is too
		big.

				LOIS
		But he's mine, he's ...

	The lady doth protest too much.  Everyone is staring

		All right!

				PERRY
			(smile reborn)
		Enthusiasm.  I love it.

				JIMMY
		I'm with you, Chief.

	Perry leans in, whispering.

				PERRY
		We're a team?

				JIMMY
		Yes, sir.

				PERRY
		Fine, Jimmy.  Here's what I need
		from you.

	Eagerly Jimmy reaches for his note pad.

				PERRY (Cont'd)
		Two, no three donuts.  Jelly.
		Go to Lucille's.  Tell her
		they're for me.  Got it?

				JIMMY
			(deflated)
		Got it.

	Jimmy slinks out.  The PHONE BUZZES, Perry picks it up.

				PERRY
		White.
			(beat)
		No, I don't agree.

	Perry turns his back on the room to converse. Lois is still 
	seething about the suspension of what she considers fair 
	play.

		I'll find him

				CLARK
		How?  He could be anywhere.  Mars,
		the North Pole ...

				LOIS
		I'll find him.

				CLARK
		What if he doesn't want to be
		found?

				LOIS
		What are you talking about?  Why
		wouldn't he want to be found?

				CLARK
		Maybe all this frenzy isn't what
		he expected.  Maybe he's gun shy.

				LOIS
		That's ridiculous.  He has no
		reason to hide.  Especially from me.

				CAT
		Wait a minute.  I get it.  You and
		Superman joined the zero gravity club
		on the space station, didn't you?

				LOIS
		Excuse me?

				CAT
		Don't worry.  Your secret's safe.
		No one would believe it anyway.

				PERRY
			(off the phone)
		Okay, settle down.	*
			(taps the blow-up)
		Think.  What could draw him out?
		Use your instincts.  Beat the
		bushes.  Turn the stones.  Get me
		Superman

	All begin to leave.  Clark leans over to Lois.  She's still
	in a foul mood.

				CLARK
			(teasing)
		Where should we start?

				LOIS
			(offended)
		We? There is no 'we.'

		How do you know I don't have the
		inside track on finding Superman?

				LOIS
		Sure, Clark.  And when you run
		across Jimmy Hoffa and the Easter
		Bunny, why don't you reel them in,
		too?

	Lois marches from the room.  Cat moves to Clark's
	side; close to his side.

				CAT
		'We' sounds good to me.  That's
		French for 'yes', isn't it?

				CLARK
		Not in Smallville.

	Clark exits.  Cat begins to follow, but stops.  She turns
	back to the blow-up.  She picks up the magnifier, stares at
	Superman's face, then moves it slowly up and down his body.
	Cat makes a sexy FELINE GROWLING SOUND deep in her throat.


9	INT.  DAILY PLANET - PIT - LOIS' DESK - DAY			9

				LOIS
			(into phone)
		I don't care what the radar
		facility's normally used for.  All
		I'm asking for is a simple...
		Hello?  Hello?

	Her party has hung up.  Lois bangs the phone down, glances
	at the wall clock: 9:45.  She sighs, checks off another
	name on her call list.  She's made at least a hundred.  She
	looks around the newsroom.  Clark's PHONE PINGS.  She sees
	him tense, lean into the mouthpiece.

				CLARK
		Really?  He's there now?

	Quickly Lois grabs her coffee cup, dumps the remaining
	brown liquid into her sickly desk plant, strolls past
	Clark's desk toward the coffee machine.  As she
	passes ...

				CLARK (Cont'd)
			(into phone)
		Tell him I'll be right over.
		Don't let him leave.

	But what else has she got? She gets her purse, hurries in
	pursuit.

11	INT. 344 CLINTON - TOP FLOOR LOFT APARTMENT - DAY		11

	Clark is toured by the landlord, FLOYD. Floyd is fiftyish,
	paunchy, suspicious by nature. The apartment is a disaster:
	stained walls, torn carpet, etc. It does have a small
	balcony suitable for flying exits and entrances. The
	building's ventilation system, located on the roof above,
	adds a dull WHUMP, WHUMP, WHU.MP as b.g. noise.

				FLOYD
		Quietest building in Metropolis.
		You married?

				CLARK
		No.

				FLOYD
		Girlfriend?

				CLARK
		No.

				FLOYD
		Boyfriend?

	Clark just looks at him.

				FLOYD (Cont'd)
		Me, I mind my own business. Where
		you from?

				CLARK
		Kansas.

	Clark opens a kitchen cabinet and it breaks off its
	hinges, falls to the floor.

				FLOYD
			(unconcerned)
		Few screws is all.

	Clark turns on the kitchen faucet: brownish-orange water.

				FLOYD (Cont'd)
		Minerals.  Good for the liver.

	Rev. 7/7/93 (Blue)			12.

11	CONTINUED:

	Clark moves to the balcony.  Floyd follows.  The view is
	of the brick side (no windows) of the building across the alley.

				FLOYD (Cont'd)
		Nice view.  You see out, no one
		sees in.  Walk around in the buff.
		I do.

				CLARK
		How much?

				FLOYD
		Nine-fifty.

				CLARK
			(shocked)
		Nine hundred and fifty?

				FLOYD
		You want cheap?  Go back to Iowa.

				CLARK
		Kansas.

				FLOYD
		This is Metropolis.  Nine even.
		Take it or leave it.

	Clark peels a patch of plaster off the wall.

				CLARK
		Mind if I make a few repairs?

				FLOYD
			(reluctantly)
		I guess not.

				CLARK
			(deciding)
		When can I move in?

				FLOYD
		Soon's the check clears.

	Clark writes it, Floyd slips it in his pocket.

				FLOYD (Cont'd)
		I'll have extra keys made.

	Clark runs his hand along a counter top: dusty.  He tries
	to blow the dust off, but BLOWS TOO HARD.  The front door,
	which is partly ajar, bangs closed then flies open again.
	Lois Lane, who was listening at the keyhole and hanging onto
	the knob, is propelled into the room.

	Lois realizes she's blown it.  Superman's not here.

				LOIS
		Where am I?

				CLARK
		My new apartment.

	Lois looks around, takes a beat to cover her embarrassment.

				LOIS
		What a dump.

	She exits, bangs the door closed.  Floyd, suspicions
	aroused, stares at Clark.

				FLOYD
		What line did you say you were in?

				CLARK
		Newspaper reporter for The Planet.

				FLOYD

12	INT. LUTHOR'S WAR ROOM - DAY			12

	Luthor sits shrouded in darkness on a raised dais.  Seated
	in a semicircle facing him are his co-conspirators:  ALBERT
	JULES, and MONIQUE.  Albert is a tall, skinny Englishman
	with a gold-knobbed cane; Jules is young, black and very hip
	in sharkskin suit, African pillbox hat, shades; Monique is
	Sharon Stone, panties optional.  Ceiling-mounted spotlights	*
	cast pools of light around the trio.	*

		What do we know about Superman?

	The trio exchange a glance.  No one wants to jump in first. 
	Finally, Jules takes a stab.

				JULES
		Man, he can really jump ... for a
		white guy.

				LUTHOR
		Yes, but how far?  How high?  Is
		he, for example, able to leap tall
		buildings in a single bound?

	Jules shrugs.

				ALBERT
		He's immensely powerful.

				LUTHOR
		How powerful?  More powerful than
		an avalanche?  More powerful than
		a... locomotive?

	Albert shrugs.

				MONIQUE
		He's still a man.  All men are
		weak.

	She crosses her long, elegant legs, seems bored.

				LUTHOR
		Obviously, we know very little.
			(beat, returning
			 to business)
		I have designed a series of tests
		for Superman.  I'll need your help.

	Monique shakes her head, annoyed.

				LUTHOR (Cont'd)
		Yes, Monique?

				MONIQUE
		Let me hire a couple of shooters,
		and I'll turn Superman into a
		large wet spot.  Tests won't be

		The explosion was radio-

	INTERCUT:  Clark's apartment/Kent kitchen.

				CLARK
		I don't know, Mom.  It's a bomb

		I'm fine.

		Will you two forget about the

	He hangs up, looks around at his apartment.  It's an unin-
	spiring sight.  No furniture, still dirty and decrepit.
	In a corner, on the floor, are his blanket and pillow
	where he spent his first night.  He turns to where several
	large boxes of cleaning, painting, refinishing supplies are
	stacked in a corner of the living room.  Just then, a KNOCK
	on the door.  Clark opens it to admit Floyd, who peers
	inside suspiciously.

				FLOYD
		Extra keys, Kent.  I'll just...

	He fits them one at a time in the lock: neither works.  He
	stares at the marking on the keys.

	closes the door, scans the room again, turns ON a portable

		Then what good is he?

				LOIS
		What he can't do... it doesn't

		Someone to believe in.  Someone to

	her words, calls after her.

		Lois!

		Not now, Clark.

	She steps into the elevator.

		If you get a package ...

		A magnificent day. No Superman

		Shall I tell your guest you'll

	Both look to where a set of pom-poms and a white sweater

		Do that.  It should be memorable.

79A	EXT. METROPOLIS SIDEWALK - DAY			79A

	Lots of foot traffic. One area is roped off so a giant
	crane can hoist a billboard atop a roof. A crowd has
	gathered to watch. The billboard lifts and is slowly swung
	toward the building. Then, trouble. The crane's MOTOR
	STALLS AND RE-STARTS with a jerk. The sudden motion causes
	one of the two steel cables supporting the billboard to
	snap. The operator SHUTS the MOTOR down.


79B	CLOSEUP - BILLBOARD				79E

	It depicts a family at the breakfast table; mom and dad read
	the paper. Text: Wake Up To The Daily Planet. Below that,
	the famous logo. It dangles by a single cable.


79C	CROWD						79C

	Gasps and moves back.  Workmen appear from behind and out of
	the cab of the crane and confer, pointing and gesturing at
	the problem.  The situation is serious, but not yet
	dangerous.  Then, with a TWANG of METAL FIBERS FRAYING, the
	remaining cable begins to unravel.  The workmen scatter.


79D	BILLBOARD						79D

	It casts a shadow on the empty sidewalk below.  It will
	fall, the only question is how soon.


79E	CROWD						79E

	waits breathlessly for the anticipated crash.  But now, with
	no warning, a GRANDMOTHER holding her two granddaughters,
	one by each hand, emerges from a storefront inside the roped 
	off area and proceeds onto the sidewalk, into the shadow.
	The crowd reacts.

				VARIOUS PEOPLE IN THE CROWD
		1.  Look out!
		2.  Above you!
		3.  Get out of there!
		4.  Hurry!

	The Grandmother looks up, sees the menace, tugs at 
	the kids, one of whom drops a stuffed animal.  The kid wants
	to go back for it, but Gramma won't let her.  The KID begins
	to CRY.  The threesome reach the border and safety, but the 
	kid breaks free and runs back to her toy.  The Grandmother
	starts back after her.  Another METALLIC TWANG: the cable
	now consists of a single strand.

	They all turn to look.  Lois Lane has entered the newsroom.
	She's filthy, mud-splattered, exhausted.  She carries a
	large, mud-streaked trashbag which she drops on her desk.
	Everyone stares at her.

				JIMMY
		Lois, what happened?

				LOIS
			(edge of hysteria)
		Nothing.  Nothing at all.  Oh,
		you're referring to my...
		appearance?  Well, after hours
		of tramping through mud, and filth,
		and frogs, and things, I have a
		perfect right to be a bit...
		disheveled.
			(building)
		By the way, did you know it's
		possible to get completely lost
		at the Metropolis Sewage
		Reclamation Facility?
			(losing it)
		And did you know that there are
		billions of mosquitos there? I
		do. I met them!

	She rips open her blouse to reveal an impressive collection
	of red bites.

				LOIS (Cont'd)
		Of course, my little trip to hell
		wasn't a total failure.  I did
		find this.

	She unwraps the trashbag:  a large, plastic Godzilla with
	a yellow "S" painted on its chest.  Jimmy breaks into a
	huge grin, looks at Clark, who manages to keep a straight
	face.  Suspicious, furious, Lois approaches Clark's desk
	and produces, now folded and stained, the map.

				LOIS (Cont'd)
		You wouldn't happen to know who
		sent me this, would you?

	Then, see spots the Morning Edition.  She slowly lifts it,
	scans, puts it down.  Her fury has drained away, replaced
	by a vast empty feeling.

				LOIS (Cont'd)
		You got the story? You?
