    FADE IN:

11CLOSE ON DEXTER.  Walking.  Seemingly lost.  RED STROBE 
    LIGHTS dance across his face, though we don t see their 
    source.   

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I ve never had much use for the 
                        concept of hell.  But if hell exists, 
                      I m in it.

    REVEAL he walks toward a PARKING GARAGE.  It s a crime 
    scene... police tape, squad cars.  But it s all inexplicably 
    DESERTED, not a soul in sight.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      The same images running through my 
                        head.  Over and over.

    He enters the dark, silent garage.  No one here, either.  
    Eyes fall to a trail on the ground of SMALL BLOOD DROPS. 

    QUICK FLASH: DEXTER S MOTHER, sprayed in blood, held by a 
    LARGE, MENACING MAN.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.) 
                        I was there.

    He comes to a LARGE, DRYING POOL OF BLOOD on the ground.

    QUICK FLASH: Dexter s mother COLLAPSING into the blood.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.) 
                        I saw my mother s death.  

    He finds JAGGED BLOOD SMEARS on concrete pillars and an SUV.

    QUICK FLASH: Blood spraying the walls, the sound of a 
    chainsawhitting bone, Dexter s mother SCREAMING.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        A buried memory, forgotten all these 
                        years... it climbed inside me that 
                        day... 

    Dexter, shaken, looks up.  Someone s there.

    REVEAL: BATISTAin a white hospital gown, blood seeping from 
    a DEEP KNIFE WOUND in his side, standing before Dexter.  
    Hurt.  Accusatory.

                                        BATISTA
                      You should be focusing on me, socio.

                                                                            SLAM TO:

    INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT 1 - SAME TIME22

    We ve been inside the parking garage Batista was stabbed in 
    Episode 110.  Dexter stands right where he was.  Same blood, 
    same crime scene.  But now DEBRA s where Batista stood.  Mid-
    sentence.  Didn t even know Dexter was in his own head. 

                                        DEBRA
                      -- seriously wannatake down the 
                        motherfuckerwho did this to Batista.
                                (realizing)
                        Hey.  You all right?

    Dexter looks around.  The area is fully populated, as it 
    should be: FORENSICS TECHSand UNIFORMS.  As MASUKA, 
    forensics kit in hand, hurries up to them:    

                                        DEXTER
                        Yeah.  I m just... distraught.  About 
                        Angel.
                                (then)
                        How s he doing?  Do we know?

                                        MASUKA
                        Still in surgery.  

                                        DEBRA
                        LaGuerta s there.  God, I hate feeling 
                      so helpless.
                                (waiting, then, to 
                                Masuka)
                        What, no jokes about providing gross, 
                        sexual comfort in a time of crisis?  

                                        MASUKA
                                (matter-of-fact)
                      Our friend was stabbed, and he might 
                        die.

    A quiet, emotional beat.  Moved, Debra reaches out and 
    wordlessly squeezes Masuka s arm.  ON DEXTER, watching...

                                        DOAKES (O.S.)

    CONTINUED:22


    Debra looks across the garage, sees DOAKES waving her over.  
    She hurries off.  Masuka opens his kit. 

                                        MASUKA
                        Though her sweater melons do look 
                        excellent tonight.
                              (re: the scene)
                      So what do you think?

    They turn to the same series of JAGGED BLOOD SMEARS on the 
    concrete pillars and an SUV.  Dexter stares.

                                        DEXTER
                      He fought back.  These jagged smears.  
                        There was a struggle.

                                        MASUKA
                        Attaboy, Angel.

    Dexter s eyes turn to the ground, where he focuses on the 
    SMALL BLOOD DROPS:

                                        DEXTER
                      And here, this trail, the steady 
                        stream of drops... he had a few 
                        seconds.  Tried moving away... 
                        until...

    Follow Dexter s gaze to FIND the LARGE, DRYING POOL OF 
    BLOOD: 

                                        DEXTER 
                      ... until he fell.  

    Dexter stares at the abstract splotch, unable to turn away.  

                                        DEXTER (V.O.) 
                      So much blood...

    He looks up, sees everyone else moving about, doing their 
    jobs as if at HALF-SPEED.  Comforting each other... 

                                        DEXTER (V.O.) 
                        What s happening to me?

    ACROSS THE LOT

    Debra and Doakes question the two roommates, ANDY and JERRY
    (20s), who witnessed Batista s attack.

                                        JERRY
                      We heard the car alarm first.  Then we 
                      saw this guy with a knife.        DEXTER 111     "Truth Be Told"    Final Draft -- 10/02/06      4.

                        Uh-uh.He wore some kind of a mask.  
                      And he was fast.  Took off as soon as 
                      we ran over.

                                        JERRY
                        What was this, like a carjacking?

    Doakeslooks around.  He takes Debra aside.

                      Not likely.  Not in an enclosed

    EXT. BUSY STREET CORNER - NIGHT 133

    ON A PROSTHETIC HAND.  Its nails painted different bright 
    colors, a UNIQUE DIAMONDRINGon one finger.  REVEAL 
    MONIQUE, the one-handed call girl from 110.  She walks down 
    the well-populated street.  On the job.  Until:

                                        MONIQUE
                      No way.  You re the one I m supposed 
                      to meet?

    REVEAL RUDY has been waiting for her.  He grins.  Playful.  
    Just another guy meeting just another girl on the corner.

                                        RUDY
                      In the flesh. 

                                        MONIQUE
                        Y know, I was just talking to someone 
                        about you.
                              (sly grin)
                        So... where rewe going?

    INT. RUDY S LOFT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 144

    Monique, naked,on her stomach on the bed.  Enjoying 
    herself.  CLOSE ON RUDY, drawing lines on her body with a 
    surgical pen.  He moves languidly, sensually -- it s erotic.

                                        MONIQUE

                        I wouldn t dream of stopping.

                                        MONIQUE
                        You re so different this time.  
                        Gentle.  I was afraid you were gonna 
                      try and get all pervywith my stump 
                        again.

                                        RUDY
                        Actually, your imperfection is what 
                        saved you the first time.

    PULL UP.  REVEAL what Monique cannot see -- Rudy marking her 
    arms and legs... at every major joint.  For CUTS.

                                        MONIQUE
                        Saved me from what?

                        True artistry.  The message of my work 
                        isn t in the product itself, but, 
                        rather in its presentation.

    He moves down her leg, making lines at all the right spots.

                                        RUDY 
                      And that wrinkled flesh hanging off 
                        your radial carpal joint is far from 
                        perfect.  Quite unsightly, actually.  

    Stung, Monique sits up, her eyes flying open.

                                        MONIQUE
                        Hey, if you re gonna be an asshole--

    He drops the pen, comes around her, massaging her shoulders.

                                        RUDY 
                      I m sorry.  I didn t mean to offend.

    Monique looks like she wants to say something, but the 
    massage feels so good.  She sinks into it...

                                        RUDY 
                        Truth is, I m very grateful to you.

                        something that lldistract them.  And 
                        I ve found a freshly-chopped-up body 
                        always does the trick.

                                        MONIQUE
                        Wait... what?

    Realizing she s in trouble, she struggles, but he s got one 
    arm around her neck, like a noose, clasped at the bicepby 
    the other.  A grotesque, intimate hug.  Too late for 
    Monique.

                                        RUDY
                        Shh, don t struggle.  It never helps.

    He leans his head next to hers, pressing her head sideways 
    at an awkward, unnatural angle.

                                        RUDY 
                      I m compressing your carotid artery, 
                      and that s cutting off oxygen to your 
                        brain.  In about ten seconds, you ll 
                      be unconscious.

    But Monique keeps squirming.  Desperately fighting for air.  
    Then she SLUMPS FORWARD.  Rudy catches her and hoists her 
    unconscious body over his shoulder.

    Rudy carriesMonique out of the bedroom and into the main 
    living area.  Crossing to the kitchen, he pulls opens the 
    ominous silver door leading to his refrigerated KILL ROOM.  

    Rudy s phone RINGS, but he doesn t even give it a glance.  
    As Rudy pulls the heavy door shut behind him --

                        dork...

    She turns, sees AURI, Batista s daughter, sitting quietly 
    against the wall with a UNIFORM COP.  Exhausted, worried.  
    Nearby, a HOSPITAL WORKER hangs festive, brightly-colored

    INT. RITA S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 177

    Rita, on her phone, replacing batteries in Astor and Cody s 
    toys, can t see Dexter s not concentrating.

                      So you probably won t be coming over 
                        tonight.

                      for your friend.

    She gets no response from Dexter.

                                        RITA
                      You know what, focus on Angel.  We can 
                        talk about this later.

                                        DEXTER
                        Thanks.

                        They re back.  I have to go.

    He hangs up and watches through the window as an unconscious 
    BATISTA is wheeled past, headed for his ICU room, followed 
    by a DOCTOR, LAGUERTA and NINA (Batista s estranged wife).  
    LaGuerta splits off and joins the worried cops, gathered at
    the window.

                                        LAGUERTA
                        Angel sustained severe internal 
                        injuries.  Doctor said he lost a lot 
                      of blood.  But...
                                (tired smile)
                      The surgery was successful.  Looks 
                        like our boy s out of the woods.

    The room erupts with emotion: hugging, back slapping.  
    Relief all around.  Debra fights back her own tears, and 
    Doakes puts his arm around her, letting her lean on him for 
    support.

    Dexter standsapart from the cluster of cops.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        I know I should stay.  Be a part 
                      of the group hug and the charade 
                        that the good guys always win.

    He turns to leave.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      But I can t focus.  I m trapped in the 
                        clutches of a memory.  I need to know 
                        what it means.

    Doakes  look darkens as he watches Dexter quietly slip away.

    INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 188

                        Yeah, really?  We all got someplace to

                        anything?  Anything at all?  

    Dexter stares back at Doakes.  Dead calm.

                                        DEXTER
                        Take your fucking hand off me.

    A beat.  Doakes stares intently into Dexter s eyes-- and 
    sees the dark soul inside.  Doakes slightly nods his head.

                                        DOAKES
                        Yeah.Just what I always thought.

    Doakes drops his hand.  Dexter turns and walks away.  OFF 
    Doakes, watching him go...

    Rudy pretends he was asleep.

    Rudy enters from the kitchen with wine and two glasses, 
    walking right past the silver door to his kill room.

    She buries her head back into her paperwork and Dexter has 
    no choice but to turn and leave empty-handed.

                        Let s get some visual surveillance. 

    As the Uniforms break off, Dexter arrives at the crime scene 
    with his blood kit.

                                        DEXTER

                        hotel, can t wait to see how the 
                        Captain handles the press on this one.

    LaGuerta spots Doakes and Debra nearby.

    Dexter walks up to Debra and Doakes, who glares at Dexter.

    Ignoring her, Dexter follows Debra over to the ersatz winter 
    wonderland.  Shepoints to a clock on the wallof Santa s 
    Cottage.  Its candy cane hands are frozen at:

                                        DEBRA

                                        DEXTER
                      Any leads on what they mean?

                        Mathematicians.  Code-breakers.  They 
                        need more to go on. 

    Passing by Santa s over-sized velvet throne, Dexter is drawn 
    to an enormous glittering tree.  UNDER THE TREE lies an 
    assortment of gifts wrapped in colorful paper, ribbons and 
    bows.  At first we don t see a body.  But as he comes 
    closer:

    DEXTER S POV

    reveals that some of those ribbons adorn wrapped BODY PARTS 
    nestled among the gifts... including Monique s head.  Her 
    face finally at peace.

                        First he turns my whole world inside 
                      out with a carnival of blood.

                      Now he leaves me this?  A calming 
                        oasis in my desert of confusion?  It 
                        doesn t make sense.

    Dexter crouches beside Masuka to examine the body.

                        This isn t right.  The way the body 
                        parts are scattered among the

    Masuka carefully rotates the wrapped torso.  REVEAL tied to 
    the woman s spine with ribbon is a VIDEOTAPE.

    Dexter s gloved hand glides over a jagged tear indicating

                        wants to bring those memories into 
                        focus. 

    He slows down the microfilmto read a headline:  MOB HIT 
    KILLS TWO.  Skimming the article, Dexter shakes his head.  
    No, that s not it.  He continueshis search.

                      So do I.  

    A LIBRARY AIDE (black, 30s) crosses to Dexter.  Hands him a 
    few more boxes.

    ON SCREEN grisly images of a crime scene are splashed across 
    a storydated October 3rd, 1973.  The bold headline reads: 
     SHIPPING YARD MASSACRE.   Its sub-headline:  Authorities 
    discover grisly bloodbath. 

    Next to other crossed out dates, Dexter jots down: 10-3-73.  
    A beat.  He crosses out the last two digits.

    Then, removing the dash between the 0 and 3, the realization 
    is staggering...

                        One, zero, three.  Same as the hotel.  
                        Same as Santa s cottage.  This is what 
                      he wanted me to find all along. 

    Dexter advances the microfilmto the newspaper s MUGSHOT

    familiar face.  Her name escapes his lips...

    He moves on to another page.  Ablack and white photo 
    disguises the gruesome nature of a hacked up woman s body, 
    face down, in a vast, dark pool of blood.

    Suddenly, Matthews exits his office with a group of GRAYING 
    WHITE GUYS in suits.  But it s smiles all around, laughter 
    and back slaps as they head for elevators.  Looking back 
    over his shoulder, Matthews and LaGuerta make eye contact, 
    before he s swept away by the good  olboys.

                      At least I know my sisteris safe 
                        tonight.  Which gives me time to check 
                      out my own theory on Rudy.

    INT. HOSPITAL - BATISTA S ROOM - DAY 33434

    Nina enters cheerfully, magazines in hand.

                        They didn t have Road & Track, so -- 

    She pulls up short when she sees UNIFORMEDOFFICER WONG, 25, 
    handing Batista a GREASY FAST-FOOD BAG.  Her eyes narrow.

                                        NINA 
                        That better be a bag of applesauce.

                        Okay, Wong, at this point you probably 
                        wanna go save yourself.

    Wong practically flies out the door.  Nina walks to the bed.

                        light of things that matter.

    still-pissed) Nina close to his side.      DEXTER 111     "Truth Be Told"    Final Draft -- 10/02/06      46.

                        come home, I ll eat whatever you want.

                        things were going with us... I thought 
                        maybe you d forgiven me.

    Nina s face softens, she looks at Angel compassionately.

                                        NINA
                      Of course I forgive you.  I forgave 
                      you a long time ago.

                        Papi, you did what you did, and it was 
                        hard, but it got us to face the truth: 
                      we were miserable.  For years.  You

    Rudy strings playful patio lights across the deck, clearly 
    preparing for company.

    Rudy silently RAGES.

    Dexter steps to the door, gloves on.  Stealth mode.

                        Thinking Rudy attacked Batista doesn t 
                        make any sense.  He s a loving 
                        boyfriend.  He spends his life helping 
                        people in need.  He brought me steaks.

    EXT.  RUDY S BUILDING - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT 34040

    Dapper, dignified Dexter is waist-deep in a DUMPSTER, 
    rooting through garbage.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      Oh, the humanity.  Times like this, I 
                        wish the truth was more easily 
                        accessible.  And less ripe.

    He rips open a garbage bag, watches its contents spill at 
    his feet.  Rifles through it.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                      But Harry taught me to trust my gut.   

    Rifling through its contents, Dexter clearly finds this 
    distasteful.  Still, he picks up yet another bag, tears into 
    it.  Its contents fall... and Dexter sees something.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        People lie all the time, he said.

    He bends down, picks up acolorful, mass-mailed ENVELOPE.

    ON DEBRA as she sips.  She hears a CRINKLING SOUND.  She 
    turns to see Rudy, his champagne still untouched,pop a 
    THROAT LOZENGE.  He moves to kiss her -- she stops him.

    She sees the discarded lozenge wrapper -- the same wrapper

                                        RUDY
                      You know that thing I ve been dying to 
                      ask you?  How could you notknow who I 
                        was?  You re a cop.

    Debra grows uncomfortable.  Tries moving.  Can t.

                                        DEBRA
                        This isn t funny.

    But Rudy doesn t release his grip, squeezing it tighter.

                                        RUDY
                      I d think a real cop would have at 
                        least a sense she was in the presence 
                      of the person she s been hunting, 
                        right?  

                                        DEBRA
                        Rudy.  You re hurting me.

                                (whispers in her ear)
                        I never got to show you the best part 
                      of my loft.  I built it myself.  The 
                        refrigerated room.

    ON DEBRA.  A slow, cold realization washing over her.

                                        DEBRA

    Debra pivots, SLAMMING her elbow into his chin.  He lets go.  
    She tries to run but she s not fast enough -- he grabs her 
    shoulder.  She spins, throws a punch, but he grabs it, using 
    her momentum against her.  He wraps his arm around her neck.

                                        RUDY
                      You can fight, but everything s in 
                        motion now.  Maybe a little faster 
                        than I had planned.

    He drags her back onto the couch.  She struggles in vain.

                                        DEBRA
                                (gasping)
                        Why reyou doing this?

                                        RUDY
                      The tricky part was getting you on the 
                        boat.  The other women, I could just 
                      pay them to go where I wanted.

    He leans in, presses his head against hers to force it into 
    the same, unnatural angle we saw earlier.  Debra keeps 
    fighting, but she s growing weary.

                                        RUDY 
                        But... in the end, you made it easy.  
                      So desperate to fall in love.

    Tears stream down Debra s face; she knows the end is near.  

                                        DEBRA
                        Stop...

    Rudy s chokeholdcuts off her oxygen.

                                        DEBRA 
                                (barely a whisper)
                      ... please.

    OFF Debra s eyes rolling back into her head...

    INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY- NIGHT 34444

    Dexter, walking at HALF-SPEED, looks down the corridor, sees
    Camillia at the stairwell door, leaving for the day.

                      Not much scares Camillia.  But this 
                        morning, I could see she was afraid.

                        Afraid of what I ll eventually find.  
                        Truth be told, so am I.  

    Realizing, he looks at his cell phone.No calls.

                                        DEXTER (V.O.)
                        Hey.  How busy could Deb be?  

    REGULAR SPEED RETURNS, as Masuka screeches up.  

                                        MASUKA
                        Dude, you gotta see this.

    He holds out a file.  Dexter doesn t take it.  

                                        MASUKA
                      The autopsy on our Santa s Cottage 
                        victim.  Check it out, one arm was 
                        shorter than the other.  So I started 
                        thinking, our guy doesn t get sloppy.  
                        He s precise. 

                                        DEXTER
                      Not now, Vince.

                                        MASUKA
                        See, the left wrist was two inches 
                        shorter than the right.  Why cut off 
                        more on the left than the right? 

    Masukawaggles the file at Dexter again, wanting him to 
    look.

                                        MASUKA
                        Because she was a fucking amputee.  I 
                        looked up her medical records.  She 
                      had a fake left hand.  That s why we 
                        never found it.  The killer cut off 
                      the extra piece of wrist so we 
                        wouldn t see her stump.

                                        DEXTER
                        Give me that.

    He finally takes the file from Masuka.

                        Killer because he got too close...  

    Without another word, Dexter hands back the file, turns and 
    heads back to:

    INT. POLICE STATION - LAB/CORRIDOR - NIGHT 34545

    Dexter stares at the Young Lab Tech.  Everyone else in the 
    room might as well not exist.

                                        DEXTER
                        You re absolutely sure.

                                        YOUNG LAB TECH
                        Positive.  The samples you gave me 
                        were a match -- they were from the 
                        same person.

    PUSH IN on Dexter.  His world collapsing.

                        Rudy is the Ice Truck Killer.

    The thought chills Dexter to the bone.

                        Hey.  Are you all right?

    But he s already gone, rushing to the corridor.  As Dexter 
    races out, REVEAL Doakes.  Unseen by Dexter, he enters the 
    lab behind him. 

                                        DOAKES

    Doakes reaches out, grabs the LAB REPORT from the Young Lab 
    Tech.  Scans it for a beat.  Looks back.

                        What the fuckis he doing?

    INT.  POLICE STATION - BULLPEN - NIGHT 34646

    Dexter, growing desperate, scans the bullpen: lots of cops.  
    No Debra.  He turns to the nearest body -- Detective Simms.

                                        DEXTER

                        supposed to leave here.

    He grabs a WALKIEoff a desk and speaks into it:

                      her radio.  

    COME AROUND Dexter, radio in hand,as he waits for a long, 
    agonizing beat.

                        Would you like me to try again?

    Dexter drops the radio on the deskandraces from the
