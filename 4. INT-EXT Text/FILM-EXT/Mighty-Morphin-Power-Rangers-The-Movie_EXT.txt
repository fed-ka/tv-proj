PERFECT CIRCLE
They look to one another and a moment of pure magic passes
between them.
It's not
usual the exhilaration of flight they're
sharing, it s the exhilaration of togetherness, of being part
of a team.
TOMMY

They disperse and yank their rip-cords.
The sky BURSTS TO LIFE

A BOWLER shouts out playfully.
BOWLER

Mr. Kelman feigns seriousness.
MR. KELMAN

TOMMY
Let's take the shortcut!
Tommy leads them up a plywood ramp -- they LAUNCH TEN FEET
THROUGH THE AIR, PULLING OFF HAIR-RAISING FREE STYLE MOVES THEN
MAKE SPECTACULAR LANDINGS on the construction site parking
structure.
As they shoot across the concrete, the CAMERA PUSHES IN on:

INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT
Barricades and police tape surround the egg.
A
SECURITY GUARD
passes his sleeping CO-WORKER, drops into a chair, sips his
coffee.
BZZWAPP -- ZEDD, RITA, GOLDAR and a short, fat, furry creature
named MORDANT appear.
RITA
Another Saturday night and I'm
traipsing around the galaxy with
the THREE LITTLE PIGS!
My mother
warned me this would happen!
Rita, she said, after 89
marriages you might wanna think
about throwing in the towel.
Why
didn't I listen to her?!
Zedd grumbles to himself.
ZEDD
That's a good question.
The stunned guard stirs his sleeping buddy.
FIRST SECURITY GUARD
Uh... Kurt...
you might wanna
take a look at this.
Kurt looks up groggily.
ZEDD
No need to wake him.
In fact,
why don't you take a little nap
yourself.
Zedd ZAPS THE GUYS with a bolt from his staff -- they are
knocked out.
Goldar steps back from the blast and accidentally steps or
Mordant's foot.
Mordant KNOCKS on Goldar's metallic leg.
MORDANT
Hey bonehead, get off my hoof!
Goldar is oblivious.
Zedd, stands reverently before the
glowing egg shape.
ZEDD
After two thousand years of
searching...
I have finally
found you.
Mordant BANGS on Goldar's leg again.
MORDANT
Yo, earth to Bigfoot!
Goldar SWATS Mordant.
GOLDAR
Watch your mouth, fuzz-ball!
ZEDD
SILENCE!
RITA (to
Goldar)
Where did you FIND this rabid
little rodent, anyway?!
GOLDAR
Mordant's my second cousin three
times removed on my mother's
side.
He`s just visiting for the
summer.
RITA
Well put a muzzle on him!
Mordant GRUMBLES under his breath.
Meanwhile, Zedd aims

staff at the chamber and BURSTS a blast of energy.
The egg
opens up with a wHOOSH of decompressing air.
webs of
ELECTRICITY BRANCH OUT, followed by a SWIRL OF BLACK SMOKE.
When the smoke clears we see a BUBBLING, PURPLE, PHOSPHOSCENT
OOZE.
The group gathers around -- Rita sticks a finger in
o
the sticky substance.
RITA
What... you spent two thousand
years looking for this tub of
SNOT!
As if in response, the ooze BOILS AND FROTHS.
Zedd and Rita
are too busy arguing to notice this.
ZEDD
Don't you ever have anything nice
to say?!
RITA
Well, if I did I certainly
wouldn't say it to you!
We hear a SLITHERING SLURPING SOUND as the substance RISES UP
AND TAKES ON THE GHASTLY SHAPE OF IVAN OOZE.
Mordant tugs at Zedd.
MORDANT
Boss.
ZEDD
For your information this is not
just your average, run-of-the-
mill tub of snot !
RITA
You're trying to tell me there`re
different levels of snot?!
MORDANT
Boss.
ZEDD
WHAT!
Zedd and Rita finally notice Ivan, standing with his lips
apart, revealing jagged teeth, one of which is made of
GLISTENING SILVER.
He stretches his sinewy arms, releases an enormous YAWN, puts
his hands on his head, CRACKS it.
IVAN
Ahhhhhhhh.
Now he SMACKS his lips together, opens his arms theatrically
and gives his trademark stance.
IVAN
Ladies and Gentlemen... the OOZE
is back!!
Rita blushes.
RITA
He's so cute.
Zedd flashes her an angry look, turns back to Ivan.
ZEDD
I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of
all that is good and decent.
It
is a supreme honor to finally
meet you.
Ivan gives a slight bow.
IVAN
How can I ever repay you?
ZEDD
Do you recall the name...
Zordon
of Eltare?
Ivan's face goes dark, THUNDER RUMBLES and the site LIGHTS UP
WITH A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.
Mordant turns to Goldar.
MORDANT
Seems to ring a bell.
ZEDD
I want you to destroy Zordon, so
that my evil may once again reign
SUPREME.
IVAN (hissing)
I will not only destroy him, I
will OBLITERATE his entire being.
It will be like Zordon
of Eltare never EXISTED!
RITA
Finally, a real man.
Goldar hands Ivan a scrap of paper.
GOLDAR
Here's his address.
IVAN (reading)
"... left off Interstate 12?!"
(puzzled)
What's an "interstate"?
MORDANT
It's like a freeway.
How long
have
you
been
locked
up? !
ZEDD
We shall leave you to weave your
wicked ways.
RITA
Now we go out on the town.
First

CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT
On cue, the Power Rangers TELEPORT into the construction site.
They're surrounded by rock piles, pools of water and a plethora
of building supplies.
Billy looks down at the mud puddle he's
standing in.
BILLY
Remind me to have a word with
Alpha about his teleporting
calculations.
They survey the construction site for a moment.
AISHA
Anybody see anything?
TOMMY
... Let's take a look over there.
They advance up a slope -- the egg comes into view.
ROCKY (alarmed)
It looks like it's been opened!
The kids get close to the egg, looking it over with
fascination.
Suddenly a hand falls on Aisha.
SECURITY GUARD (O.S.}
Hey!
They all whirl around and see the first Security Guard.
He
half smiles, shaking his head.
SECURITY GUARD
You had me scared there.
AISHA
Makes two of us.
KIMBERLY
You haven't by any chance seen
a ... morphological being lurking

SECURITY GUARD
The only thing I've seen is you

You're too kind.
Allow me to
introduce myself.
I am the
infamous, world-reviled,
universally despised, IVAN OOZE!
ROCKY
Well, pack your bags cause we're
sending you back where you came
from!
IVAN
Gee, a teenager with a big mouth.
Not much has changed in six
thousand years.
KIMBERLY
we're not just teenagers, raisin-
head.
TOMMY
We're the Mighty Morphin Power
Rangers!
Ivan puts his hands to his face in mock fear.
IVAN
Ooooh, where's my autoqraph
book?.
He looks them over reproachfully.
IVAN
Power Rangers, huh?
So Zordon is
still using a bunch of rug-rats
to do his dirty work.
And
speaking of rats...
Ivan raises both hands -- ELECTRICITY SHOOTS OUT HIS FINGERS
and the kids DIVE CLEAR as the bolt ZAPS A THRONG OF RATS.
Now, incredibly, the RATS GROWN INTO GRUNTING, SNARLING MAN
SIZED RAT-BEASTS.
IVAN
From this moment forth, the world
as you know it SHALL CEASE TO
EXIST!
Ivan raises his arms -- thunder CRACKLES and LIGHTNING RIPS
ACROSS THE SKY.
IVAN
WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE!
An EXPLOSION OF PURPLE SMOKE CONSUMES IVAN.
ROCKY
He's
gone.
The RATS ATTACK!
ADAM
Let's take these beasts!!
Tommy gets off a stellar CROSS-HOCK TAKEDOWN, Kimberly delivers
a world class HEEL STOMP, Billy executes a lethal REVERSE
HANDSWORD.
Despite their valiant efforts, the Rangers ar

Two rats charge Aisha and she LEAPS UPWARD - the pair SMASH

Rocky picks up a two-by-four and starts SPARRING with another
rat.
Billy SHOVES A HUGE WOODEN-SPOOL down a slope and it
ROLLS INTO A COUPLE OF RATS, BOWLING THEM OVER.
One rat CRACKS IT'S TAIL like a whip, KNOCKING Adam to
the ground.
Another rat gets Kimberly in a bear hug and she makes a
face.
KIMBERLY
RAT breath!!
She grabs a handful of his whiskers.
KIMBERLY
Somebody needs a shave.
She YANKS THEM OUT, the rat SQUEALS and releases her.
The
fight well, but the rats start to get the upperhand.

Adam rises, speaks in a low growl.

He holds his hand in the air.
ADAM
STEGA-STINGER!
The STEGA-STINGER appears in Adam`s hand.
He aims

Adam leaps off a platform, SWINGS THROUGH THE AIR like Tarzan,
SLAMS into the rat and sends him CATAPULTING.

Billy takes a hit, ROLLS across the ground.
He stops inches

Rocky is now up in the scaffolding.
He DROPS TEN FEET through

Tommy throws Saba Saber and the knife SWOOPS THROUGH THE AIR
and zings around the beasts as they try to knock him down.
SABA
Na na na na na!
The rats chase after Saba as he heads into a water-slicked
area.
There's a large power cable running across it.
Once
all the rats are in the water, Saba kamikaze dives into the
cable, SLICING IT OPEN WITH AN ERUPTION OF SPARKS.
The water
SIZZLES WITH ELECTRICITY and the rats GO UP IN A PUFF OF SMOKE.
SABA
Fried mice, anyone?
We see the six original small rats scurry away, SQUEAKING.
Suddenly, there's an EXPLOSION OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY and the
Rangers watch, stunned, as their COSTUMES DE-MATERIALIZE and
they appear back in civilian clothes.

Billy tries his wrist communicator.

He proceeds to pull off what is nothing short of a miracle.
He uses the STICKS for weapons as he executes a ROUNDHOUSE
KICK, a SCISSOR-KICK TAKEDOWN, a SITTING SIDE KICK, a
ROUNDHOUSE DROP SPIN BACK KICK, a PARALLEL BLOCK FROM THE

The kids are seated on rocks by a lakeside, all of them
drinking from clay mugs.
Dulcea finishes handing out bowls.
Aisha stares into hers with a grim expression.
AISHA
Is this... food!
DULCEA
They're called squirbs.
Kimberly lifts out an EEL-LIKE CREATURE, and watches it SQUIRM
between her fingers.
KIMBERLY
Mine seems to be a little
undercooked.
Dulcea sprinkles hers with brown flakes.
DULCEA
Add a few dried weevils and
you'll never know the difference.
The other Rangers watch as Billy holds one of the squirbs over
his mouth and drops it in.
He chews a few times, lets out
a
BURP.
BILLY
... Not bad.
TOMMY
Listen, we appreciate your
hospitality, but we really don't
have much time.
Dulcea looks to Tommy.
DULCEA
What do you know of the Great
Power?
KIMBERLY
Only that we need it to defeat
Ivan Ooze.
Dulcea's eyes move from Ranger to Ranger.
DULCEA
It is said that to those who
possess the Power... all things
are possible.
BILLY
Where did it originate?
DULCEA
In another time, another
dimension.
It was brought here
long ago by the "Nathadians", a
people who are now all but
extinct.
They built an impenetrable stone
Monolith to store the power and
keep it from their enemies.
(ominous)
For thousands of years, beings
from all over the Universe have
tried to obtain it... ALL have
perished.
Dulcea's words hang heavily in the air.
AISHA
So how can we get to it?
DULCEA
The only way to obtain the power
is to achieve the highest state
of being...
TOMMY
And how do we do that?
DULCEA
By learning the ancient art of
Ninjetti.
It is the Genesis of
what you on earth have come to
know as the Ninja.
(beat)
It is the perfect union of mind,
body and spirit.
ROCKY
Look, Zordon doesn't have much
longer to live.
And for all we
know, Angel Grove could already
be under attack.
We don't have
TIME for this.
As Rocky is talking, a flubbery looking SNOUT works it's way
over Kimberly's shoulder.
She hasn't noticed it yet.
DULCEA
You don't understand.
If you do
not have the Ninjetti, the power
will destroy
you.
(beat)
To reach the Monolith we must
traverse the Neola jungle.
We
will train today, and set out on
foot tomorrow.
The snout works it's way underneath Kimberly's chin -- she
SCREAMS FOR ALL SHE'S WORTH.
INCLUDE - A TERRIFIED SNOGGLE.
This is Dulcea's ant-eater like assistant.
He jumps up and
down, YAMMERING and GESTICULATING.
SNOGGLE
HNUGLHLU PHUNGLUMP BUGHLSMRPH
GBUJIPHN HUPHLGMPNORU!!!
DULCEA
Snoggle, you watch your language!
Snoggle now re-fills Aisha's tea-cup.
SNOGGLE
Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?
AISHA
Excuse me?
SNOGGLE
Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?
DULCEA
He wants to know if you'd like a
cube of sugar in your tea.
AISHA
Ah... sure.
We hear a PHOOT as Snoggle BLOWS A CUBE OF SUGAR OUT HIS SNOUT
AND IT SPLASHES INTO AISHA'S TEA.
Aisha stares at the cube a
moment.
AISHA
Ah... thanks.
The other Rangers watch as Billy holds one of the squibs above
his mouth and drops it in.
He chews a few times, lets out a
BURP.
BILLY
... Not bad.

Dulcea and the Rangers are gathered around a bird-bath stand
with FLAMES leaping out of it.
DULCEA
In the language of the
Nathadians, "Nin" stands for
"man", "jetti" stands for
"animal".
Ninjetti
- man and
animal, together as one.
(beat)
Now, put your hands inside the
flame.
AISHA
Yeah, right.
DULCEA
It will not harm you.
The kids hesitate a moment, then reluctantly put their hands
inside the flame.
Aisha makes a horrific expression...
AISHA
Just kidding.
They remove their hands -- they're filled with sand.
AISHA
Wow.
Sand.
DULCEA
Now tell me... what do you see?
Aisha studies the sand for a moment -- it MAGICALLY TAKE ON
THE SHAPE OF A BEAR.
AISHA (bedazzled)
I see... a bear
DULCEA
Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart
and bold.
AISHA
Stylin'!
Dulcea turns to Rocky.
His sand MAGICALLY TAKES ON THE SHAPE
OF AN APE.
ROCKY
I see... an Ape.
DULCEA
Rocky, you are the Mighty Ape.
We see each of them DISCOVER THEIR ANIMAL.
BILLY
I see... a fox
DULCEA
Close.
Billy, you are the Wolf,
cunning and swift.
And now Kimberly.
She studies hers for a moment.
It looks
like a bird.
KIMBERLY
I think its some kind of bird.
DULCEA
Kimberly, you are the Crane,
agile and sublime.
Now Adam.
ADAM
That's gotta be a frog.
DULCEA
Adam, you are the Frog, quick as
lightning.
And finally, Tommy.
TOMMY
It's... an eagle?
DULCEA
Look closer.
TOMMY
... A falcon?
DULCEA
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged
Lord of the Sky.
Kimberly regards Dulcea with true admiration.
KIMBERLY
How do you know so much about the
Ninjetti?
Dulcea stands tall and proud.
DULCEA
I... am the sole living
descendant of the "Nathadians".
(beat)
Now prepare yourselves for the
most intense physical and mental
training known to man and animal.

FRED
I can't find my dad either.
KID #2
What's going on?!
Suddenly a WILD KID wearing grunge clothes runs by HOWLING LIKE
A BANSHEE.
He's holding a container of ooze in one hand and a
baseball bat in the other.
He SMASHES a couple of trash
cans

Kimberly and Snoggle observe as Dulcea walks ON HER HANDS
across a narrow bamboo log that spans a pond.
A waterfall
churns in the b.g.
DULCEA
The crane maintains it's agility
through the perfect harmony of
mind, body and spirit.
She leaps into the air, does a ROUND-HOUSE KICK, lands
perfectly on the narrow span.
KIMBERLY
Awesome!
Dulcea reaches the end of the log, flips through the air lands
flawlessly on the ground.
Kimberly heaves a sigh, climbs onto the bamboo and start
walking across, balancing precariously on her hands.
She gets about a quarter of the way, loses her balance, and
falls into the shallow pond.
Snoggle laughs, making a loud HONKING SOUND.
Kimberly
recovers, shoots him a look.
KIMBERLY
Let's see you do it .
SNOGGLE (indignant)
Ghun Phnug Gnouphl.

Dulcea now SCRAMBLES UP THE POLE WITH THE NIMBLENESS OF A
SPIDER.
In less than ten seconds she reaches the top.
Rocky
shakes his head in disbelief.
ROCKY
Who is this lady?
Now she SLIDES DOWN like a firewoman, drops beside Rocky.
He
takes hold of the pole, focuses for a moment.
ROCKY

It starts SCURRYING UPWARD.
He gets about fifteen feet in the

Dulcea is blindfolded, Billy isn't.
DULCEA
The wolf relies on it's enhanced
senses to guide it...
He can
hear what we cannot hear, he can
smell what we cannot smell.
Billy takes SWING after SWING -- Dulcea easily DEFLECTS every

Now Dulcea takes numerous SWINGS, THWACKING Billy repeatedly
and finally KNOCKING him INTO THE WATER.

then strikes out in the blink of

We hear a TRILLING SOUND as Dulcea watches some kind of insect
dart around her.
THWAP!
The TRILLING SOUND is gone.
Dulcea has literally
caught the insect in the blink of an eye.
Adam shakes his head
in disbelief.
He waits a moment, hears a TAT-TAT-TAT sound and watches a
insect zip around him.
He lashes out numerous times,
missing the insect completely.

Snoggle meanwhile suffers some serious bodily

Now Dulcea does the impossible.
She LEAPS OFF THE ROCK, SOARS
FIFTY FEET through the air, AND LANDS on another protruding
rock.
Tommy is stunned.
DULCEA (calling out)
JOIN WITH THE FORCES OF NATURE!
Tommy psyches himself up.
TOMMY

Rest for a few hours.
We will

She heads through the door.
KIMBERLY
So where are we supposed to

Snoggle points to the campfire.
SNOGGLE

He pushes Kimberly toward it making a "Na na na na na" sound
through his snout.
He then hurries inside and SLAMS the door.
KIMBERLY
That guy's cruisin' for a

The kids approach the dying fire, all of them limping a little.
BILLY
I can hardly walk...
AISHA
I've never been this sore in my
life.
They drop around the fire, a few of them GROANING.
They stare
into the orange coals for a long moment, all of them looking
disillusioned.
BILLY
Do you guys really think we can
pull this off?
It takes a moment to get a response.
ADAM
Maybe if we had more time.
TOMMY
... I wonder... We've been
relying on our Morphin Powers for

A PURPLE HAZE OF SMOKE has settled on the construction site.
Suddenly, mysteriously, SWARMS OF ZOMBIFIED PARENTS emerge from

Ivan steps forward, followed by Goldar.
IVAN
Ladies and gentlemen, Simon
says...
STOP!
All the parents stop.
IVAN
Simon says... stand on one foot!
All the parents stand on one foot.
Ivan seems to be taking a
perverse glee in all this.
IVAN
Simon says...
GOLDAR
Quack like a'duck!
All the parents start QUACKING LIKE DUCKS.
Ivan slowly turns
to Goldar, gives him an icy stare.
GOLDAR
It just slipped out.
Ivan turns back to the QUACKING parents.
IVAN
SHUT UP!!
The parents keep quacking.
GOLDAR
You didn't say "Simon says".
IVAN (irritated)
Simon says SHUT UP!!!

Now, as soon as I give the word
I want all of you to start

A night wind WHISTLES through the

After a moment, there's movement in the bushes.
Suddenly,
amazingly, a WOLF emerges -- his mane glistening in the
moonlight, his eyes GLOWING LIKE FIRE.
He surveys the sleeping clan, moves straight toward Billy.
He
stands inches away from him, watches him with an intense gaze.
Billy stirs slightly.
The embers cast an orange glow on Kimberly's sleeping face
A SHADOW moves over her and two CRANE LEGS step into frame.
There's a FLURRY OF FLAPPING WINGS as a FALCON SWOOPS DOWN and
lands on a rock directly above Tommy.
The bird fixes on Tommy
with its piercing eyes.
We hear a GRUNTING SOUND as the SILHOUETTE OF AN APE APPEARS:
Now a FROG HOPS through the air and lands inches away from
Adam.
The frog sits there a moment, it's THROAT THROBBING
Now we hear a DEEP GROWL and a tree SHAKES.
Aisha fidgets in

What kind of landing was that?!
These clowns are a menace to the

IVAN
How did you fare?
Mordant waves Ivan off.
MORDANT
Oh, it couldn't've gone better.
The Power Rangers didn't know
what hit them .
The Tengu appear, one of them SQUAWKS and makes grand gestures.
MORDANT
That's right.
And then we threw
one of them off a mountain and
another one into a raqing river!
IVAN
So they've been destroyed?
The Tengu SQUAWKS some more.
MORDANT
"Basically".
IVAN
What do you mean "basically"?
MORDANT
Well... we were about to finish
them off... when this huge
monster came out of nowhere!
MORDANT
Okay, maybe he wasn't so huge.
But you should've seen the size
of his STICKS
A pensive look comes over Ivan...
IVAN
Did these sticks make a whistling
sound?
MORDANT
How'd you know?
IVAN
Dulcea!

That miserable, manipulating
loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
To help make the point Mordant SPITS on the ground.
IVAN
How could you let them get away?!
If Dulcea leads them to the Great
Power, everything will be ruined!
They must be OBLITERATED!
One of the Tengu SCREECHES again.
MORDANT
What're you talking about?!
It
wasn't my fault!
You're the
featherbrains that let them get
away!
Ivan looks up to the sky.
IVAN

Darkness to enrich the evil of my

LIGHTNING RIPS from the sky and ZAPS THE TENGU, CAUSING THEM TO
GLOW RADIANTLY.

Monolith...

Tommy pulls all of them into a huddle.

ROPE BRIDGE -
DAY
68
The Tengu are on full alert.
One of them hears something,
snaps around, there's nothing there.
Another Tengu looks down as a frog hops between his leg.
He
SCREECHES and STOMPS down his taloned foot, missing the
creature by inches.
We hear a CAW and the Queen Tengu squints as she spots a falcon
circling in the sky above.
The Queen is perched on top of a 20
foot rock face. She looks around hesitantly.
Now the Rangers ATTACK, some of them LUNGING OFF ROCKS, others
BURSTING out of crevices, others coming over the walls.
Billy wields his WHISTLING sticks -- misses several times, then
starts BASHING and THWACKING the feathered beasts.
The Queen SHOOTS A LASER BLAST from her eyes -- it EXPLODES
before Tommy.
Kimberly battles another Tengu and the creature forces her back
on to the rickety bridge.
The Queen FIRES ANOTHER BLAST.
ROCKY
LOOK OUT!
Rocky DIVES, knocking Aisha away from the bolt.
Adam and one of the Tengu circle each other warily.
ADAM
The frog silently assesses its
target, then strikes out...
Suddenly the Tengu is HURTLED BACKWARD TEN FEET THROUGH THE
AIR.
We didn't even see Adam move.
ADAM
... in the blink of an eye.
Tommy steps up behind a Tengu.
TOMMY
Yo, Tweety!
The Tengu turns around and Tommy WHALLOPS HIM WITH A SPINNING-
HEEL KICK.
A Tengu faces down Aisha and she goes into a bear
stance.
AISHA
The bear is sturdy as a towering
tree.
Nothing can uproot it.
The Tengu CHARGES LIKE A BULL, SLAMS INTO AISHA.
She holds
fast and the bird EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS.
AISHA
Bye, bye birdy.
Kimberly continues balancing precariously on the bridge as she
EXCHANGES BLOWS with her foe.
She finally drops into a crane stance... then just like Dulcea
she LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR, EXECUTES A BRUTAL SPINNING HELL KICK
and sends the birdman TUMBLING OFF THE BRIDGE.
In a movement that seems to defy gravity, she lands perfcctly
back on the swinging bridge.
KIMBERLY
Hasta la Pasta, Bigbird!
Billy swings his sticks, BASHES one of the Tengu in the beak --
the creature EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS!
BILLY
AIM FOR THEIR BEAKS!
Tommy reaches the top of a rack.
He sees a Tengu making a
KAMIKAZE DIVE TOWARD KIMBERLY.
TOMMY DIVES, SOARING THIRTY
FEET THROUGH THE AIR -- HE INTERCEPTS THE TENGU AND THEY SPIN
TOWARD EARTH TOGETHER.
They HIT the ground and EXCHANGE BLOWS
AS THEY FALL OVER ONE ANOTHER.
Rocky SLAMS another Tengu in the beak, KABLAM
-- the creature
is OBLITERATED.
Tommy LEAPS INTO THE AIR, NAILS two Tengu in the beaks.
They
BOTH BURST IN AN EXPLOSION OF FEATHERS.
The Queen shoots another BOLT OF ENERGY --
a rock EXPLODES,
SHOWERING THE KIDS WITH SHRAPNEL.
Aisha turns to Rocky.
AISHA
It's up to you.
Rocky takes a deep breath, goes into a crouch position.
Incredibly he SCALES THE WALL IN THE SAME WAY HE WENT UP THE
POLE.
HE FLIPS OVER THE TOP and lands right before the Queen
Tengu.
He looks her dead in the eye.
ROCKY
Polly wanna cracker?
With that, he executes a devastating SPINNING-HEEL KICK and the
Queen BURSTS INTO OBLIVION.
KIMBERLY
ALL RIGHT, ROCKY!
Instantly, the remaining Tengu retreat, SQUAWKING and CAWWING
in
rage.
The kids turn to eaeh other, sharing in a moment of triumph.
ADAM
WE DID IT!!

ANGEL GROVE TOWER - DAY
72
We're on top of a high tower overlooking the entire city
There's a BURST OF PURPLE SMOKE -- Ivan, Mordant and Goldar
appear.
Ivan looks out on the city, holds up his arms
theatrically.
IVAN
ANGEL GROVE... I'D LIKE TO
INTRODUCE YOU TO A COUPLE OF MY
NEAREST AND DEAREST FRIENDS...
HORNITOR!
HORNITOR APPEARS on the street ROARING like a fiend.
His
enormous foot DROPS DOWN AND CRUSHES A CAR INTO OBLIVION.
IVAN
And his trimetallic partner in
crime... SCORPITRON!!
SCORPITRON APPEARS on the street and BASHES IN THE SIDE OF A
BUILDING, SENDING GLASS AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE.
IVAN
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
GOLDAR
GO IVAN!!
Mordant turns to Ivan and throws his arms up in jubilation.
MORDANT
LONG LIVE THE BOOGER MAN!
73
MONOLITH - DAY
75A
The kids climb up on top of the rock bluff -- before them is a
huge black Monolith.
There's all sorts of charred bones and
skeletons strewn around it, some of them human, some of them
alien.
They approach the massive block, stand before it in awe struck
silence.
In the middle of the Monolith there's a large circle
with the six animals of the Ninjetti carved into it.
ROCKY
... The Nathadian Monolith...
Kimberly looks at all the bones -- instinctively puts her hand
on her animal symbol.
KIMBERLY
I guess these guys weren't so
lucky.
A few of the kids walk around the Monolith, examining it more
closely.
AISHA
We've come all this way for a
rock wall?!
BILLY
There should be a way to open it.
Billy &;Tommy latch their hands over the block, searching for
an opening.
BILLY
... Nothing.
ROCKY
Release the power with the power.
Rocky steps back, THROWS HIS SHOULDER into the Monolith with a
THUMP, winces in pain.
AISHA
Not that kind of power.
The kids exchange discouraged looks.
BILLY
... There has to be something
we're missing.
The kids look crestfallen.
ROCKY
It can't end like this...
Suddenly a SIZZLE OF ELECTRICITY forms in front of them.
KIMBERLY
What NOW!
The kids mouth's fall open as... a HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE OF
ZORDON'S WITHERED FACE APPEARS.
He speaks in a barely
audible voice.
ZORDON
Rangers... Ivan has invaded the
city... time is running out...
Zordon's image FLICKERS a few times then STABILIZES again.
ZORDON
Each of you are now in possession
of miraculous skills... but only
when the six become one will you
have the strength to harness the
Great Power.
His IMAGE FLICKERS then FADES AWAY.
KIMBERLY
ZORDON!!
Billy studies the circle with zealous eyes.
TOMMY
Six become one... the combined
forces of the Ninjetti.
ROCKY
Strength in numbers!!
They silently assemble in a line, all of them interlock:
hands.
They face the Monolith with fire in their eyes.
BILLY
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
KIMBERLY
I am the crane, agile and
sublime!
AISHA
I am the bear, stalwart and bold!
ADAM
I am the frog, quick as
lightning!
ROCKY
I am the mighty ape!
TOMMY
And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord
of the Sky!
RANGERS
WE... ARE THE NINJETTI!!!
A mysterious HALO OF LIGHT SHROUDS the Rangers and they dissapear
INTO THIN AIR.

Ernie's is packed with crazed kids and teenagers who are
ripping the place apart.
Bulk and Skull watch while gorging themselves on pizza.
BULK
There goes the neighborhood.
SKULL
A real shame.
Suddenly Fred appears and shouts out.
FRED
EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP!
The place falls silent.
FRED
You've been brainwashed!
This
Ivan is no Wizard.
He's some
kind of DEMON!
KID #4
Shut up, squirt.
KID #3
You can't talk that way about our
leader.
Enraged, they move in on Fred.
FRED
You gotta believe me -- he's
EVIL!
The crowd gets angrier.
They move closer... Fred gulps with
fear... glancing around for help, he notices a HOSE.
He lunges
for it, cranks on the water, and TURNS IT ON THE CROWD!
SPLASH!
They get SPRAYED DOWN!
Suddenly -- they stop in their tracks, slowly blinking,
confused.
The spell is broken.
We hear: "What's going on ?!"
"What am I doing here?!", etc.
FRED
Listen to me!
Our parents are in
danger!
If we don't help them
they're going to be killed!
He hurries off.
A few follow him, then a few more... until
pretty soon everybody joins him.
Bulk and Skull share a look.
SKULL
What about the pizza?
Bulk considers the dilemma.
BULK
We could take it with us.
Skull nods, relieved.
They gather up the pizza and move off
after the others.

THE ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES

ATTACK WITH A RELENTLESS FEROCITY.
There's all kinds of
CRASHING and BASHING and EXPLOSIONS!
There's a BLAM, BLAM, BLAM as Scorpitron REPEATEDLY FIRES his
cannon arm at the Bear Zord, who in turn DEFLECTS THE VOLLEYS.
Hornitor shoots a BLAST from it's stinger, the Crane Zord
dodges the FIERY ERUPTION.
KIMBERLY (V. O.)
Nice try,
Pinhead!
Scorpitron repeatedly KICKS at the Frog Zord with it's BLADED
FEET, SENDING UP OSCILLATORY DISCHARGES, at the same time
SLASHING WITH IT'S LETHAL CLAWS.
ADAM

Somebody back me up, here!
Hornitor BORES IT'S DRILL ARM INTO THE APE ZORD, SENDING

Hornitor SEARS the Wolf Zord with it's needle-nose.
In
retaliation, the Wolf Zord POUNCES, KNOCKING HORNITOR INTO THE

Now the Falcon Zord SWOOPS THROUGH THE AIR.
TOMMY

Heads up!
He FIRES BOOSTER ROCKETS, STRAFING SCORPITRON WITH AN INTENSE
FUSILLADE.
Hornitor gets back up -- the Ape Zord SWINGS DOWN FROM
BILLBOARD, RAMS HIM FEET FIRST, SENDS HIM CATAPULTING BACK.
ROCKY
(V.O.)
Hope you've got a good mechanic.
Scorpitron FIRES A VOLLEY at the Frog Zord -- the Zord BOUNDS
THROUGH THE AIR, AVOIDING THE BLAST, COMES CRASHING DOW ON TOP
OF SCORPITRON.
The Falcon Zord swoops in and blasts Scorpitron who BLOWS UP
INTO A BILLION FLAMING PARTICLES!
KIMBERLY (V.O.)
WE GOT HIM!!
IVAN
(outraged)
These brats are ruining
EVERYTHING!
Mordant and Goldar watch popeyed as IVAN'S BODY STRETCHES OUT
LIKE A HUGE PIECE OF GUM.
He STRETCHES and STRETCHES until his head BURSTS THROUGH THE
STOMACH OF SCORPITRON.
We hear a resounding SNAP AS IVAN'S FEET ARE RELEASED FROM THE
ROOFTOP AND HIS ENTIRE BEING SPURTS INSIDE THE GIANT'S BELLY.
Now there's all sorts of GURGLING and SLURPING sounds as the
monster's face SHAPE-SHIFTS INTO IVAN'S FACE!
He grins, revealing his silver tooth.
