A surreal, fog shrouded plain, stark and brooding.  In b.g., dimly 
glimpsed through the mists, are monoliths of basalt that suggest 
huge Stonehenge like dolmens and menhirs.  We cannot tell if it is 
day or night -- the gray fog itself seems luminous.  SFX: FARAWAY 
WINDS.

                            DUNGEON MASTER (O.S.) 
                Venger?

ANOTHER ANGLE

DUNGEON MASTER stands in the midst of the desolation, looking about 
him.  He is not afraid; on the other hand, he doesn't look overjoyed 
at being here.

                            VENGER (O.S.) 
                I am here, old man.

Dungeon Master turns in time to see a MAGIC BOLT SPLIT a monolith. 
It CRASHES to either side, revealing VENGER amidst the swirling 
fog.  He looks down at Dungeon Master.

                            VENGER (CONT'D) 
                Dungeon Master, you are a fool.

FAVORING DUNGEON MASTER

He raises a polite eyebrow, but does not reply.

                            VENGER (CONT'D) 
                Your pupils are doomed to failure. 
                They are brave only because they know 
                you stand behind them.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 
                Not so.  They can triumph over anything 
                in the Realm -- as you well know.  They 
                will not fail.

CLOSE ON VENGER

He scowls, then smiles craftily, as if an idea has just occurred to 
him.

                            VENGER 
                Well, then -- perhaps you would not be 
                adverse to a test of their courage?

ON DUNGEON MASTER

He looks wary.

                            VENGER (O.S. CONT'D) 
                We shall see how brave they are when 
                you turn away from them.  If they 
                succeed, they will find the Key.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 
                And if they fail -- what do they lose?

ON VENGER

He raises a fist CRACKLING with Kirbyesque power.

                            VENGER 
                Everything.  Their weapons -- and 
                their lives.

CLOSE ON DUNGEON MASTER

He bows his head and folds his hands together.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 
                So be it.

                                                    SHOCK CUT TO:


As the seven heads of an enormous HYDRA lash straight at us! SFX: 
HISSING.  PULL BACK to include BOBBY, HANK, ERIC, DIANA, SHEILA, 
UNI and PRESTO, all running for their lives across a moody expanse 
of swampy moors with the hydra in hot pursuit.

                            KIDS 
                    (ad lib) 
                Look out!  Run!  Here it comes! 
                (Etc.)

                            HYDRA 
                    (roars)

REVERSE ANGLE - OTS HYDRA

Lumbering forward, big enough to CRUSH small trees under its feet, 
its heads SNAPPING and HISSING at our guys.

                            HYDRA 
                    (hisses)

                            ERIC 


2 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                Do something, Hank!  You're the 
                leader!

ON HANK - RUNNING

He stops and fires an energy arrow up O.S.

ON HYDRA

The energy arrow streaks INTO SHOT and wraps about the hydra's 
necks, pinning them together for an instant.  But the hydra BREAKS 
the glowing bonds and keeps coming.

                            HANK (O.S.) 
                It's too strong!

ON ERIC - RUNNING

One of the heads swoops down, grabs Eric by the cape and lifts him 
up O.S.

                            ERIC 
            Haaaallp!

ON BOBBY

He swings his club at a dead tree, KNOCKING it loose from its 
roots.  The tree begins to topple.

                            BOBBY 
            Timberrr!

ON HYDRA

Still holding Eric with one of its beaks.  The tree falls INTO 
SHOT and the head dodges, releasing Eric as it does so.  Eric 
falls O.S.

                            HYDRA 
                    (hisses)

ON GROUND

Eric sprawls in the mud.

                            ERIC 
                    (impact grunt)

He rolls over and scrambles out of the way of another striking head, 
just in time.

                            ERIC 
                This thing's got more heads than 
                Tiamat!

ON DIANA - RUNNING

She dodges one head and leaps over another.

                            DIANA 


3 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                There's no place to hide!  It's 
                gonna get us, sooner or later!

ON PRESTO, SHEILA AND UNI

Cornered against a small spur of rock by two SNAPPING, HISSING heads, 
Presto has no room to use his hat.

                            HYDRA 
                    (hisses)

                            PRESTO 
                It's got us cornered!

                            UNI 
                    (frightened whinny)

ON BOBBY

He raises his club over his head.

                            BOBBY 
                Hang on, Sis!  I'm coming!

A head swoops down INTO SHOT and seizes Bobby's club, lifting him 
from the ground.  He dangles helplessly.

                            BOBBY 
             Whooah!

ON ERIC

Scrabbling across the marshy ground on his hands and knees.  There's nothing funny about
this -- he's crawling for his life.  Then he 
looks up O.S., and grins in sudden relief.

                            ERIC 
                All right!  Everything's gonna be 
                okay now!

He points O.S.

ON HANK AND DIANA

Backing up warily before another SNAPPING head, Diana holding it off 
with her staff.  Hank has an arrow nocked.  They risk a look up 
O.S., and then grin in relief.

                            HANK 
               Dungeon Master!

THEIR POV - DUNGEON MASTER

Standing on an overhang of rock, looking down on the kids, who are arrayed 
in a loose semicircle with the hydra in the middle, its heads   weaving on long, snaky
necks.

                            KIDS 
                   (ad lib) 
                Dungeon Master, help!  Get us out 


4 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                of this!  Take care of this thing, 
                willya?  (Etc.)

ON DUNGEON MASTER

He is looking down O.S. at them with a grim expression on his face.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 
                You got into this by yourselves, my 
                young friends --

CLOSE ON HIM

His expression is more than grim now -- it's stern, unforgiving.

                            DUNGEON MASTER (CONT'D) 
                -- Now get out of it by yourselves!

He turns his back and steps down off the rock, disappearing from 
view.

CLOSE ON ERIC

He stares up O.S. in disbelief.

                            ERIC 
                    (despairing disbelief) 
             Huh?!

He reacts in fear to an O.S. ROAR.

HIS POV - HYDRA HEAD

Lunging straight for us!

                            HYDRA 
                    (roars)

FAVOR ERIC

Hank dives THROUGH SHOT, knocking Eric out of the way as the beak 
SNAPS on empty air.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Hank pulls Eric to his feet.  Eric has a look of sick betrayal on 
his face.

                            ERIC 
                I don't believe it!  He deserted 
                us!

ON HANK

Another O.S. ROAR snaps him around.

                            HYDRA (O.S.) 
                    (roars)

                            HANK

                We'll worry about that later -- if 
                there is a later!

He FIRES three energy arrows O.S. in quick succession.

ON PRESTO, SHEILA AND UNI

Still trapped by the hydra's heads.  An arrow ENTERS SHOT and 
STRIKES the rock wall to one side of them, SPLITTING a fissure 
down the middle of it.  They scramble through it.

                            UNI 
                    (squeal of fear)

ON BOBBY

Still dangling from one of the hydra's beaks.  The second arrow 
STRIKES the club, knocking it free of the beak's grasp.  Bobby 
lands and runs O.S.

                            BOBBY 
                    (lands, runs)

ON DIANA

Still fending off another head with her staff.

                            HYDRA 
                    (roars, hisses)

                            DIANA 
                    (effort)

The third arrow steaks INTO SHOT and EXPLODES like a flare before 
the hydra's eyes, causing it to jerk back.

                            HYDRA 
                    (surprised hiss)

Diana leaps over a low spur of rock and runs O.S.

ON RIDS - DOWNSHOT

They regroup, weapons at the ready, as the hydra lurches menacingly 
toward them again.  Uni shrinks back against Bobby.

                            HYDRA 
                    (menacing hiss)

                            SHEILA 
                It just keeps coming!  What're we 
                gonna do?

ON HANK

He looks about desperately, then spots something O.S.

                            HANK 
                This way!  Move it!



6 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


He runs O.S.

WIDE ANGLE - MARSH

The kids run THROUGH SHOT, tripping on roots and patches of mud, 
SPLASHING through noxious pools, getting their clothes caught on 
bushes.  Their faces are full of fear.  Uni gallops alongside them. 
The hydra is right on their heels as they run for their lives.

                            HYDRA 
                    (roars, hisses)

ON HANK - RUNNING

His eyes fixed on something ahead O.S.  From behind one of the 
heads GAINS INTO SHOT, almost within reach of him.

                            HANK 
                    (runs)

PAN AHEAD TO INCLUDE a nasty looking bog -- a pool of green, slimy 
water that looks like it could kill a bubonic plague bacillus.

HANK'S POV - BOG

PUSH IN on it, HANDHELD TRUCK, as if we were running toward it.

                            HANK (O.S.) 
                    (effort) 
                Get ready --

OVERHEAD SHOT - WIDE

The kids and Uni reach the edge of the bog.

                            HANK (CONT'D) 
             Now!  Scatter!

They break off to either side, running along the edge of the bog as 
the hydra's momentum carries it ahead into the morass.

                            HYDRA 
                    (hissing)

ON HYDRA

It blunders in the middle of the bog with a tremendous SPLASH!  Mud 
and slime fly everywhere.  The hydra sinks in the morass, floundering helplessly, its
heads STRIKING and SNAPPING futilely as it ROARS and 
HISSES angrily.

                            HYDRA 
                    (angry roars, hisses)

ANGLE INCLUDES KIDS

They regroup on the edge of the bog, out of the hydra's reach. 
They're exhausted, mud spattered, breathing heavily.  Presto slumps 
to his knees.  Bobby huddles in Sheila's cloak.  Diana leans wearily 
on her staff.  Uni sprawls in the mud.  Hank braces himself, hands

on knees.

                            HANK 
                    (breathing hard) 
                We did it.  We're still alive.

ON ERIC

He looks grim.

                            ERIC 
                Yeah -- no thanks to Dungeon Master.

                                                        WIPE TO:


The two suns are low in the sky, shading the salt flats red.  The 
kids, still looking much the worse for wear, are at the junction 
of two roads through the wasteland, neither of which look 
particularly appealing, though the east fork appears the better 
traveled.

CLOSER

A signpost of weathered gray wood is mounted at the crossroads. 
One of the signs has fallen; the other hangs from a single rusty 
nail, pointing at the sky.  Presto looks at it.

                            PRESTO 
                According to this, the Flame 
                Mountains are -- that way.

He points straight up, mimicking the sign.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Bobby picks up the other sign, rubs some rime from it.

                            BOBBY 
                    (reads) 
                "This way to the Sea of Sorrow."

WIDE ANGLE

Sheila looks at the two roads.

                            SHEILA 
                Great.  Which road leads where?

ON ERIC

He looks very down.

                            ERIC 
                Who cares?  It doesn't matter. 
                    (beat) 
                I can't believe he would just abandon 
                us like that.



8 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


He starts to trudge down the eastern fork.

FAVORING HANK

He realizes it's up to him to make a decision.  He looks from one 
road to the other, then points to the western fork.

                            HANK 
                We go west, Eric.

Eric just looks at him. He makes no move to return.

                            ERIC 
                Why?

                            HANK 
                It's downhill.  We're more likely 
                to find water.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Eric returns to the crossroads, looking at Hank.  He's frowning 
slightly.  The other kids watch uneasily; they sense tension.

                            ERIC 
                The other way's a better road -- 
                might lead to a town.

Hank is somewhat nettled, but trying to keep his cool.

                            HANK 
                I'm the leader, Eric.  You said so 
                before -- remember?

TWO SHOT - HANK AND ERIC

Eric steps up to Hank, locking gazes with him.

                            ERIC 
                I was under a lot of pressure then. 
                Maybe I see things clearer now. 
                    (beat) 
                Maybe it's time we had a little 
                election.  Whattaya say, Presto?

REFIELD to include the others as Eric turns to Presto for support. 
Presto looks at the others nervously.

                            PRESTO 
                Uh -- well, the eastern road  does 
                look better ...

WIDE ANGLE

Bobby steps over to Hank, as does Uni. Diana is already by Hank's 
side.

                            BOBBY 
                Yeah?  Well, I think the  west road 
                looks better.


9 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


Uni looks at Eric disdainfully.

                            UNI 
                    (horse lips)

ANOTHER ANGLE - FAVOR SHEILA

Sheila looks uncertain; as always, she tries to mediate.

                            SHEILA 
                Now wait a minute, Bobby --

                            BOBBY 
                    (interrupting) 
                Keep out of this, Sis!

Sheila, stung, takes a step backwards, which puts her closer to 
Eric.  A full-blown ARGUMENT erupts, the kids SHOUTING and pointing 
fingers at each other accusingly.  Hank is the only one who doesn't 
take part in it; he looks from one side to the other in shocked 
disbelief.

                            KIDS 
                    (ad lib) 
                You don't know what you're 
                talking about!  Aw, dry up! 
                You're always throwing your 
                weight around!  (Etc.)

FAVORING HANK

He steps between the two factions and raises both hands.

                            HANK 
                    (shouts) 
                Hold it, hold it!

The others stop and look at him.

                            HANK (CONT'D) 
                C'mon, we all know what this is 
                really about.  We're not mad at 
                each other -- we're mad at Dungeon 
                Master.

The others know he's right; they look embarrassed, avoiding each 
other's gaze.

CLOSE ON HANK

He makes a helpless gesture.

                            HANK (CONT'D) 
                I don't know what to tell you -- 
                except that it's getting dark, and 
                we'd better find a place to camp.

                You want the point, Eric?  You got 
                it.  Lead the way.

FAVOR ERIC

He looks somewhat resentfully at Hank, then turns and takes the 
eastern road O.S.  The others follow him.  Hank watches them go. 
Bobby and Uni are the last; Bobby turns and looks back at Hank. 
Hank follows, stone faced.

                                                        WIPE TO:


A pile of weathered wood on the sand.  An energy arrow from O.S. 
STRIKES it, turning it into the flames of a campfire.  PULL BACK 
to show the kids and Uni sitting on stones and logs around the 
fire.  Hank slings his bow and sits down with them.  In b.g. we 
can see the moons' reflections shimmering on the surface of the 
sea. SFX: BREAKERS.

                            DIANA 
                Maybe it wasn't really Dungeon 
                Master ...

FAVOR ERIC

He pokes at the flames with a stick.  SPARKS scatter.

                            ERIC 
                It was him.  D'you think  I wouldn't 
                know him? 
                    (beat; bitterly) 
                This whole Realm is a dungeon, y'know 
                that?  And we're all prisoners.  We 
                thought Dungeon Master was our friend, 
                but it turns out he's just another 
                guard.

FAVOR SHEILA

She huddles closer to the fire, shivering more from fear than 
cold.

                            SHEILA 
                What're we gonna do now?  If Dungeon 
                Master's abandoned us, who's gonna 
                help us?

                            VENGER (O.S.) 
                I will help you.

WIDE ANGLE - ALL

They know that voice.  In an instant all are on their feet, weapons 
ready, staring into the darkness that surrounds the fire.

DRAMATIC ANGLE - VENGER

He steps out of the darkness into the flickering light of the fire. 
PULL BACK to include the others.  Uni hides behind Bobby.  Venger 
holds out his hands in a gesture of peace.



11 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                            VENGER 
                Be at ease, my young enemies. 
                I shall not harm you.

ON HANK

Watching suspiciously from behind a nocked energy arrow.

                            HANK 
                Move very slowly, Venger.

ON VENGER

One corner of his mouth lifts slightly at Hank's warning.  He 
looks at the kids.

                            VENGER 
                So Dungeon Master has finally 
                shown his true colors.  Have you 
                never wondered why his advice 
                always led you into battle, and 
                never back to your world?

ANGLE INCLUDES KIDS

Eric, Sheila, and Presto look somewhat uncertain.  Bobby, Diana  and Hank still hold
their weapons at the ready.  The BREAKERS counterpoint the 
uneasy silence.

                            VENGER (CONT'D) 
                It has been convenient for you to 
                see Dungeon Master as good, and me 
                as evil.  But things are not that 
                simple.

ON VENGER AND CAMPFIRE

Venger stares broodingly into its flames.

                            VENGER (CONT'D) 
                I have granted you your lives before. 
                Aid me now, and I shall grant you your 
                dearest wish -- I will send you back 
                to your own world.

CLOSER

He makes a gesture at the flames.  They BLAZE UP, forming a 
miniature portal in which can be seen the amusement park.

ON ERIC, SHEILA, PRESTO

They stare longingly at the flickering image.

                            VENGER (O.S. CONT'D) 
                Far to the south lies Realm's Edge. 
                There you will find a cenotaph -- an 
                empty tomb.  Within it is a key, which 
                you must cast into the Abyss.



12 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


WIDE ANGLE - ALL

Venger makes another gesture and the image vanishes in sync with a 
particularly loud CRASH OF SURF.

                            VENGER (CONT'D) 
                Do this, and you will go home.  You 
                have my word.

The flames BLAZE UP again, higher than ever.  When they die down, 
Venger has vanished.

ON KIDS

They look at each other, speechless.  Suddenly Hank fires the 
nocked arrow O.S. skyward in a gesture of defiance.  It EXPLODES 
above them like a flare, providing eerie light.

                            HANK 
                Forget it, Venger!  No way we're 
                working for you!

CLOSER

Eric steps forward.

                            ERIC 
                Wait a minute, Hank.  What choice 
                do we have?  Dungeon Master's 
                abandoned us -- Venger may be our 
                only ticket home.

Presto steps INTO SHOT alongside Eric.

                            PRESTO 
                I think Eric's got a point, Hank. 
                Venger's ruthless, but he's got a 
                code.  I believe him.

Sheila joins them.

                            SHEILA 
                So do I.  All I want is to go home 
                -- and I don't care who's responsible 
                for sending us there.

ANGLE FAVORS HANK, BOBBY, UNI, DIANA

They look at the others incredulously.

                            DIANA 
                You guys can't be serious.  You know 
                Venger's bad news.

Hank steps toward Eric, extends a hand toward him.

                            HANK 



13 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                Eric, we gotta stick together --

ANOTHER ANGLE

Eric brushes his hand aside.

                            ERIC 
                    (angry) 
                Why, Hank?  We always stick together 
                -- and it hasn't gotten us home. 
                    (beat) 
                You guys can do what you want -- but 
                we're going after that key.

He turns and EXITS SHOT.  Presto hesitates, then follows.  Sheila 
turns, then looks back at Bobby.

                            SHEILA 
                Bobby -- won't you change your mind?

ON BOBBY

He looks very young and uncertain, but he shakes his head and 
moves closer to Hank.

                            BOBBY 
                I think you're making a mistake, 
                Sheila.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Sheila turns and runs into the darkness after the others. Hank, 
Bobby, Diana and Uni watch her go.  SFX: BREAKERS.

                                                        WIPE TO:


The breakers, foamy with salt in solution, CRASH on the rime- 
crusted shore.  An ancient galleon is wrecked there, sails hanging 
in tatters, salt stains glittering in the moonlight.  Eric, Presto 
and Sheila ENTER SHOT and climb onto the canted deck.

                            ERIC 
                Think you can make this thing 
                fly, Presto?

ON PRESTO

He takes off his hat and makes magic passes over it, frowning in 
concentration.

                            PRESTO 



14 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


                Magic in the hat be free; let us 
                use the sky as the sea.

WIDE ANGLE

A shimmering arc of magic light ERUPTS from the hat, engulfing the 
galleon and lifting it, with much CREAKING and SNAPPING of aged 
wood, free of the sand.

CLOSER ON THEM

The ship rises, the remnants of sails FLAPPING uselessly.  Eric 
faces the bow, looking grimly ahead.  Sheila stands behind him.

                            SHEILA 
                Are we doing the right thing, 
                Eric?

Eric doesn't look at her.

                            ERIC 
                I don't know.  But we're not 
                turning back.

                                                        CUT TO:


Standing by the dying embers of the fire, watching the silhouette 
of the galleon sail across the three moons.

                            HANK 
                We've got to get to Realm's Edge 
                first, somehow --

An O.S. ROAR interrupts him; they all look O.S. and react.

                            BRONZE DRAGON (O.S.) 
                    (roars)

THEIR POV - SEASHORE

A huge BRONZE DRAGON lands at the water's edge, its wings spraying 
foam and sand.

ON KIDS

Bobby steps back warily, raising his club.

                            BOBBY 
                Just what we need -- more problems!

                            UNI 
                    (horse lips)


15 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


Diana steps forward.

                            DIANA 
                Wait, Bobby.  That's a bronze dragon 
                -- it might help us.

ON BRONZE DRAGON

It watches Diana as she steps forward, her staff raised.  She TAPS 
it gently on its horns with her staff, like a mahout gentling an 
elephant.  With a SNORT, the dragon lowers its head.

                            BRONZE DRAGON 
                    (snorts)

Diana looks at the others triumphantly.

                            DIANA 
                All aboard!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Bobby, Uni and Hank join Diana on the bronze dragon's broad back. 
There is room enough for Uni to huddle between two of the dragon's 
huge dorsal plates.  Diana sits behind the beast's horns.

                            HANK 
                I hope you know what you're 
                doing, Diana.

                            DIANA 
                So do I.

WIDE ANGLE

She TAPS the dragon's horns again.  With a THUNDERCLAP of wings 
the great creature lifts into the night sky.

AERIAL LONG SHOT - BRONZE DRAGON AND FLYING GALLEON

The bronze dragon flies after the shrinking form of the galleon, 
as we --

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:


Much the same shot as before, with the bronze dragon still pursuing 
the flying ship.  They are flying south over a rocky, barren land 
which rises to mountains in the distance.  To the west the two suns 
are rising.

ON BRONZE DRAGON'S BACK - PANNING



16 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


Diana, Bobby and Uni are asleep, curled up in the hollows between 
the plates, well ahead of the STROKING wings.  Hank stands in 
another hollow, looking grimly ahead, the WIND ruffling his hair. 
PUSH IN on him as he stares O.S. after the galleon.  Suddenly 
Diana's hand ENTERS SHOT and touches his shoulder.  He turns to see 
her behind him, rubbing her eyes sleepily.

                            DIANA 
                    (sleepily) 
                You should get some sleep.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Hank looks off into the distance, frowning.

                            HANK 
                Why do you think we're here, 
                Diana?

                            DIANA 
                In the Realm? 
                    (beat) 
                I always thought it was to defeat 
                Venger.

Hank looks ahead again.

                            HANK 
                So did I -- but I'm beginning to 
                wonder.  Maybe Venger's right about 
                one thing -- maybe things aren't 
                that simple.

                            BOBBY (O.S.) 
                Hey, look!

ANGLE INCLUDES BOBBY

Be and Uni are now awake.  He stands atop one of the plates, 
pointing ahead excitedly.

THEIR POV - FLAME MOUNTAINS

They are approaching the range of mountains now, and we can see 
 they consist of active volcanoes.  Curtains of smoke and ash 
hang over bubbling cauldrons of lava.  Incandescent fountains shoot 
up.  None of the peaks are in the throes of a major eruption, but 
all together they present a dangerous gauntlet to run.  SFX: 
RUMBLING, BUBBLING LAVA.

ON GALLEON - PANNING

It weaves its way through the deadly peaks.  Eric looks over the

side and GULPS as they pass very close to a lake of fire.

                        ERIC 
                (gulps) 
            Hey, we're slowing down, Presto!

ON PRESTO

He takes off his hat and shakes it as though trying to dump more 
magic out of it.  Nothing happens.

                        PRESTO 
            I think my spell's running out of 
            gas!

WIDE ANGLE - ALL

Sheila looks back O.S.

                        SHEILA 
            They're gaining on us!

THEIR POV - BRONZE DRAGON

Flying through the clouds of ash.  We can see Hank leaning around 
one of the plates, looking down.

                        HANK 
            Stop, you guys!  Please!

REVERSE ANGLE

Eric looks up defiantly.

                        ERIC 
            No way!  This is our last chance 
            to go home!

ON HANK - PANNING

He looks angry.  He pulls back an arrow.

                        HANK 
            Have it your way --!

Diana grabs his arm.

                        DIANA 
            Hank!  What're you doing?

                        HANK 
            I'm gonna force them down!

He pulls free of Diana's arm and FIRES the arrow down O.S.


18 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


ON ERIC

He raises his shield; the arrow RICOCHETS from it O.S.

DOWNSHOT - VOLCANIC CRATER

The arrow plunges straight down into the the seething molten rock, 
setting off a tremendous ERUPTION that hurtles straight up at us!

ON GALLEON - MOVING

A rain of fiery fragments SHOWERS down on its deck, setting the 
bits of sailcoth afire.  Glowing clouds surround the ship.  Sheila 
and Presto crowd under Eric's shield as chunks of brimstone bounce 
off it.  Smoke obscures the scene.

                        ERIC, SHEILA, PRESTO 
                (fearful walla)

ON BRONZE DRAGON - MOVING

Bank, Bobby, Uni and Diana stare in horror O.S.

                        BOBBY 
            Hank!  What've you done?!

ON VOLCANO

Red-hot boulders are hurled from its crater into other nearby ones. 
The entire side of a neighboring peak BLOWS OUT, sending a searing 
STONE WIND -- a deadly cloud of incandescent gas and powdered stone 
-- O.S.

ANGLE INCLUDES HANK, BOBBY, DIANA, UNI

Reacting in fear as the STONE WIND BOILS toward them.

                        HANK, DIANA, BOBBY, UNI

It turns in an attempt to escape the wall of superheated stone mist swiftly
overtaking it as we

FADE IN:


ERUPTIONS proceeding in full force, and the STONE WIND hurtling 

toward the bronze dragon, who is attempting to outrun it.

ON BRONZE DRAGON'S BACK - PANNING

Hank, Diana, Bobby and Uni hold on for dear life. Hank looks 

back at the approaching WIND, coming like a roiling black wave.

                            HANK 

                It's too fast for us!

                            UNI 

                    (frightened whinny)

FAVORING DIANA

She reaches forward with her staff and TAPS the dragon under the 

jaw.

                            DIANA 

                Go up!  Up!

WIDE ANGLE - BRONZE DRAGON AND STONE WIND

The bronze dragon swoops up O.S.  PAN TO FOLLOW as the boiling

crest 

of vaporized rock just misses it.


With the Flame Mountains in the distance painting the sky a

baleful 

red.  Rivers of lava glow along the horizon.  The exhausted bronze

dragon lands in f.g.

Hank, Diana, Bobby and Uni disembark, and the bronze dragon flies 

O.S.  The four of them, grim faced, turn to look back at the range

offire in the distance.  Bobby is crying.

                            BOBBY 

                    (sniffling) 

                They didn't make it, did they?

                            DIANA

                    (false cheer) 

                Sure they did!  They've come through 

                tougher spots than this!

Bobby ignores her, looking at Hank.

                            BOBBY 

                Hank?

TWO SHOT - HANK AND BOBBY

Hank stares O.S. at his friends' funeral pyre.  His shoulders 

drop; he bows his head.

                            HANK 

                I'm sorry, Bobby.  It was my fault.

Bobby turns away.  Diana ENTERS SHOT and puts her hand on Hank's 

shoulder.

                            DIANA 

                What do we do now, Hank ?

Hank straightens; life must go on.

                            HANK 

                The volcanoes won't let us go 

                back.  We'll have to go on -- to 

                Realm's Edge.

Hank turns and looks in the other direction O.S., as does Diana.

THEIR POV

The plain rises for a considerable distance, and ends at the edge 

of a cliff which stretches in either direction as far as they can 

ee. At the edge, barely visible, is the cenotaph -- a lonely, 

crumbling tower on the edge of the world.

                                                            WIPE

TO:


Eric, Sheila and Presto are picking their way over the cracked 

Black lava plain.  The wrecked and smoldering galleon is visible

in 

b.g.  Sheila scrambles to the top of an angled slab and looks O.S.

this way and that.

                            SHEILA 

                Bobby?  Bobby?!

ON ERIC

He looks up O.S. at her.

                            ERIC 

                Any sign of them?

HIS POV - UPSHOT - SHEILA

The WIND plucking at her cloak. She looks around a final time, 

then lowers her head.

                            SHEILA 

                Nothing.  They must've been --

She hides her face in her hands and sinks to her knees on the

slab.

RESUME ERIC

He looks down at the ground also.  Presto ENTERS SHOT, looking at 

him sympathetically.

                            PRESTO 

                It's not your fault, Eric.

                            ERIC 

                Yeah, right.  Somebody else used my 

                shield to bounce a flame arrow into 

                a volcano. 

                    (beat) 

                If you hadn't gotten your magic hat 

                to bail us out, our gooses would be 

                charcoal now.

WIDE ANGLE

Sheila climbs down to join them.

                            ERIC (CONT'D) 

                Come on.  The least I can do is 

                find Venger's key and get you two 

                home.

He turns and trudges O.S.  Presto, looking concerned over his 

friend, follows.  After a beat, Sheila brings up the rear.  There 

are tears on her face.

                                                        WIPE TO:


The cenotaph rises, skyscraper high, on the edge of the cliff. 

PUSH IN on a moucharaby near the top, where two figures stand: 

Venger and Dungeon Master.  They look down O.S.

                            VENGER 

                You will lose, old man.  Their 

                desire to return to their home is 

                stronger than anything else. 

                Without your support they will 

                crumble.

ON DUNGEON MASTER

He looks concerned, but is determined not to let Venger get to

him.

                            DUNGEON MASTER 

                Their courage will not fail them. 

                They will do what has to be done.

THEIR POV - DOWNSHOT - LAVA PLAINS

We can see the two groups of kids making their way slowly toward 

the tower from opposite sides.  The rough terrain hides each group

from the other.

                            VENGER (O.S.) 

                We shall see.  That which is in 

                the cenotaph will test their 

                courage.

                                                        WIPE TO:


A huge door in the shape of a stylized dragon's head, the open 

jaws framing the entrance.  Hank, Diana, Bobby and Uni ENTER SHOT 

and stand before it.

                            DIANA 

                We're here.  Now what do we do?

Hank leans wearily against the door.

                            HANK 

                I don't know, Diana.  I think we've 

                gone as far as we can go. 

                    (beat) 

                I guess I've lead us straight to 

                disaster.

INCLUDING DIANA, BOBBY, UNI

They look at each other; they don't know what to say.  Uni

nuzzles  Hank, who rests his head on his arm in an attitude of

despair. 

then:

                            ERIC (O.S.) 

                Hey, look on the bright side -- you 

                beat us here.

They all snap around and stare O.S., then react in joy.

                            HANK 

                    (disbelieving joy) 

                Eric!

THEIR POV - ERIC

Standing atop a small rise, his cape flowing behind him, looking 

cocky.  Sheila and Presto scramble up into view behind him.

                            SHEILA 

                    (ecstatic) 

                Bobby!

She runs down O.S.




24 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


SHEILA AND BOBBY

They run toward each other and embrace.  PULL BACK to include the 

others as they take turns hugging each other.  Uni capers about 

them all, BLEATING in joy.

                            UNI 

                    (happy unicorn bleats)

                            KIDS 

                    (ad lib) 

                Boy, am I glad to see you!  We 

                thought you were goners!  How'd 

                you get out of that?  Let's never 

                split up again!  (Etc.)

FAVORING HANK AND ERIC

With their arms around each other's shoulders.

                            ERIC 

                I'm sure glad you guys are okay. 

                Now all we have to do is get that 

                key and we can go home.

Hank steps back from Eric.  He looks surprised.

                            HANK 

                You're not still planning on that, 

                are you?

ANGLE INCLUDES ALL

We see that, consciously or not, they've divided into two groups 

again.

                            ERIC 

                You bet we are!  I want to sleep in 

                my own bed tonight!

                            DIANA 

                Eric, you're already sleeping -- 

                and dreaming -- if you think Venger's 

                gonna follow through on his promise.

                            SHEILA 

                If there's even the slightest chance, 

                we've gotta take it.


25 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html


FAVORING HANK

He stands before the door.

                            HANK 

                Forget it, Eric!  Nobody opens this 

                door!

ON ERIC AND PRESTO

Eric stares defiantly O.S.

                            ERIC 

                That's what you think!  Presto, show 

                him!

                            PRESTO 

                    (doubtfully) 

                Well -- okay ...

Presto takes off his hat and aims it O.S.  A bolt of magic force 

ERUPTS from the hat O.S., surprising the young magician as much as

anybody.

                            PRESTO 

                    (surprised grunt)

ON HANK

He tries to dodge as the the bolt streams INTO SHOT, but a tendril

of it lifts him and gently sets him aside, while the main force of

the bolt BATTERS through the cenotaph's door, SPLINTERING it.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Eric, Presto and Sheila run forward, into the cenotaph.

                            ERIC 

                That's three, Presto.  You're on 

                a roll.

ON HANK, DIANA, BOBBY, UNI

Trapped by the dissipating coils of Presto's spell.

                            KIDS 

                    (struggle)

By the time they free themselves, the others are out of sight.

                            HANK 

                We've got to stop them -- they're 

                playing right into Venger's hands.

TRACK WITH THEM as they run into the cenotaph.


Streams of magic BURST from the tower, spreading away from Realm's

Edge and O.S.


Several SERFS toiling among crops.  A magic bolt from the vault 

IMPACTS near them like an incandescent meteorite, and a portal 

opens there, showing the single sun of Earth shining over a

medieval town.  The serfs drop their mattocks and rush toward the

portal.

                        SERFS 

                (happy cries)


39 of 443/10/03 10:01 AMMichael Reaves' Professional Credits / Requiemhttp://www.mindspring.com/~michaelreaves/requiem.html



Another magic bolt ZAPS a portal near a group of LIZARD MEN.  The 

world opened for them is that of a tropical jungle, with three red

suns shining above it.  The lizard men rush into the portal.

                        LIZARD MEN 

                (hisses)

WIDE ANGLE - REALM - PANNING

A SLOW PAN that shows bolts from the cenotaph descending in all 

parts of the Realm, creating portals wherever they STRIKE.


ORCS, BULLIWOGS and other servants of Venger flee in terror as a 

bolt arcs toward the citadel.

                        ORCS, BULLIWOGS 

                (panicked cries)

CLOSER

SHADOWDEMON emerges, reacts to the approaching destruction, then

hightails it O.S.  A moment later the citadel is STRUCK AND 

DESTROYED by the bolt.

                                                        CUT TO:
