      pool, and into the barbecue, past the perfectly-manicured 
      grounds and the monied MEMBERS and GUESTS mingling on the patio 
      under a banner that reads --  ANNUAL LABOR DAY BARBECUE. 

      This is Firmwood, an exclusive country club located amongst 
      the monied estates of Westchester, New York, just north of 
      New York City, where many of our most successful CEOS -- and 
      CEOs to-be -- live, work and play.

      charges were dropped,   She was a wonderful nanny until she 
      was deported,   I have the X3 and the X5.  One day I hope to 
      get the X7.  -- we HEAR something slightly more interesting --

      In a secluded area of the barbecue, we FIND KARL, late 30s

      BAND around his ring finger.

                    I m sorry, sweetie.  But I told 
                    you, after the barbecue I need to 
                    get right to the office.  No, it s

                    Yes. But --

      Brody gets increasingly animated, although he does his best 
      to keep his voice down.  Clearly, a nerve has been touched.

      James emerges, still reeling from the turn of events.  He s

                                  STACEY

                    looking for you.

      James smiles at her.  Simply seeing her face has a way of

      AN OVERTURNED GOLF CART spins its wheels, as nearby a SMALL

      Brody scurries to start collecting his wife s shrimp as James 
      pushes to his boss  side, loosens his shirt and presses his 
      fingers against his neck to check for a pulse. 

      But there s nothing. The impact of the crash has rendered the

      furiously tries to breath life into the CEO.  But it s no

                    I got trouble.


      The cart is parked at the mid-way break.  The guys sit at a 
      secluded table, nursing beers, as Duncan recounts his troubles.

                                  JAMES
                    Wait a second.  I thought you said 
                    you were arrested for a DWI.

                          (shakes his head)
                    No.  That was just my cover.  For

                    So I don t get it...then what 
                    happened in Yonkers?

      Duncan exhales, as the guys await his explanation.

                                  DUNCAN
                    I was coming home from a hunting 
                    trip...

                    I was getting tired, so I pulled 
                    into a truck stop for some coffee.  
                    To keep me awake for the drive home.  


      Duncan s car pulls into the parking lot.  He emerges, 
      stretches his arms.

                    There was a woman there.  Dark and 
                      beautiful.  She smiled at me and we 
                    began to talk...

      An ATTRACTIVE WOMAN smiles at Duncan.  They strike up a 
      conversation.

                          (nods)
                    I was lonely.  And one thing led to 
                    another and before I knew it, we 
                    were in a men s room stall for a 
                    little business transaction.


      Brody s S-Class pulls off the service road and into the rest 
      stop adjacent to the New York State Thruway.  When the car 
      slows to a stop, Duncan and Brody emerge.

                                  BRODY
                    Classy spot.  I can see how those 
                    vending machines might really put a 
                    guy in the mood.

      The guys peer around.  Looking for the tranny.

                    She told me this was her regular

                    She got promoted to this?  Boy, she 
                    must have really kicked ass at the

                    By the way, you never told me her

                      Dontrelle.

      Brody stops, looks incredulously at Duncan.

                          (stunned)
                    You hooked up with someone named 
                    Dontrelle and you didn t think it 
                    MIGHT be a dude?  He sounds like a 
                    middle linebacker.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (defensively)
                    I told you it was dark.

                                  BRODY
                    Yeah.  Because Dontrelle probably 
                    went 6 4 , 220 and blocked out the 
                    sun.

      Duncan chooses not to respond.  Then he spots a PROSTITUTE 
      loitering by the vending machines.  

                                  DUNCAN
                    Hold on.  There s someone...

                    good times.

                                  DUNCAN

                    Dontrelle doesn t work Exit 47

                                  BRODY
                    Another promotion perhaps.

      Duncan shoots Brody a look.  Not helping.

                                  DUNCAN
                          (to the Hooker)
                    Do you know where I could find, um, her?

                      No...sorry.  Can t help you.

      Duncan pulls out his bill-fold and peels off a couple of 
      TWENTIES.  He hands them to the hooker.

                                  HOOKER (CONT D)
                    You know, now that I think about it, 
                    I might be able to track Dontrelle 
                    down through an old john I know.

      Duncan then hands the hooker his BUSINESS CARD.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Tell her to call me at that number.

                    She was that good, huh?

      And she s gone.  James smiles to himself.  Then as he looks 
      back at the picture, the smile runs from his face.


      Duncan admires the ball that he s just hit off the roof of 
      his office building. He tees up another as he addresses his 
      UPPER-LEVEL MANAGEMENT that stands around him.

      Duncan sets down his driver and continues to address his 
      execs.  As he does, Cameron quietly enters with a TRAY OF TO-
      GO COFFEES.  She hands the execs their espressos and 
      macchiatos as Duncan continues to speak.

                                  DUNCAN 
                    ...but even in success, Reveal must 
                    be a leader, not a follower.  Did 
                    you know that by the year 2015, the 
                    most rapidly expanding population 
                    group will be women over sixty?   
                    Why not make these women feel 
                    beautiful too? 

      The execs nod and murmur  yes  as Duncan continues.

      Marla emerges from a taxi cab.  Apparently, it was not an

      Karl pulls up to his house in his BMW.  He parks and moves 
      quickly towards the front door.  He s here to do his best to 
      reclaim his marriage.  He opens the front door and enters.


      Music wafts out of the club s main hall.


      OUTSIDE THE WINE CELLAR -- James, Brody and Karl stare unsurely 
      as Duncan emerges from the wine cellar with Dontrelle.

                                  DUNCAN 
                          (to the guys)

                    They re very cute.

                    They know you re packing.

                          (shrugs)
                    Worth a shot.

      Dontrelle moves down the hall.  Duncan gives the guys a look, 
      then moves down the hall after her.  As they clear frame, 
      they REVEAL --

      Brody nudges James, who looks up to see her. On his look, 
      we re...


      As a TAXI pulls away with Dontrelle inside, Duncan breathes a 
      sigh of relief.  Just then, Cameron steps in next to him.

                                    CAMERON
                    You and Dontrelle -- not just old

      Cameron nods.  A beat, then...

                                    CAMERON
                    You know, we re more alike than I 
                    thought, Duncan.  We both have 
                    trouble getting out of our own 
                    ways.

      Duncan turns and looks at her.

                                  DUNCAN
                    Are you going to stop embarrassing

                    Not likely.

                    Well at least we know where we 
                    stand.

      Cameron turns and starts to walk off...

                    Good night, Duncan.

      Duncan watches Cameron walk off.  He can t help but smile.  
      He might actually be making progress with his daughter.
