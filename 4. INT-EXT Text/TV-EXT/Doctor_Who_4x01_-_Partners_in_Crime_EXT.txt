      DONNA steps out of her front door.  Smart, head held high;
      she's on a mission.  And as Donna heads left to right -

      DONNA stops in the street, looks up...

      A TOWER BLOCK looming above.  Cool, sleek, stylish, the
      London HQ of Adipose Industries.

      Deep breath, Donna heads towards it.

                                                                            CUT TO:


      THE DOCTOR stops in the street, looks up...

      THE TOWER BLOCK looming above, Adipose Industries.  But

      THE DOCTOR's down a flight of steps, sonicking a basement

      STACY CAMPBELL, 20s, bit plump - harassed, running late -

      DONNA's standing there, with clipboard & yellow papers,
      just flashes her ID card so it can't be seen properly.

      Down below, in the darkness, one bin, then another (old
      fashioned tin-lid-bins) fall over, like tiny animals are
      scurrying past, with the giggly mewling noise.

                    I know.  It's just...  The things
                    I've seen.  Sometimes I think I'm

                    Well, you're not yourself, I'll
                    give you that.  You just seem to
                    be drifting, sweetheart.

                                      DONNA
                    I'm not drifting.  I'm waiting.

      But he runs, fast, over to the edge -

      Where there's a WINDOW CLEANER'S CRADLE.  Lovely!  Just
      what he needs.  He starts to sonic the controls.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      THE DOCTOR & DONNA race out of the Access Door - the Doctor
      sonics it shut - then run across the rooftop, to the CRADLE,
      where the Doctor frantically sonics the winch, taking loose
      wires out of his pocket and fixing them to the controls -

                    look for trouble, and he'll turn
                    up!  So I looked everywhere, you
                    name it, UFO sightings, crop
                    circles, sea monsters, all those
                    weird things in Cardiff, I
                      investigated them all - like that
                    stuff about the bees disappearing,
                      I thought, I bet he's connected! 
                    Cos the thing is, you opened my
                    eyes, Doctor, I believe it now,
                    all those amazing things out there,

                    No, cos I've locked the controls
                    with a sonic cage, I'm the only
                    one who can control it - not unless

                    They're just children.  Can't help
                    where they came from.

                    She did.  Yeah, she did.
                          (beat, then cheeky)
                    She fancied me.

                    Martha.  Charity Martha.

      Around her, the LAST ADIPOSE rise up through shot,

                    Matron Cofelia, listen to me - !

      MID-SHOT, Miss Foster stops, suspended in the air (IE, NON-
      FX, shot against night sky; she's haloed and backlit by
      PRAC LIGHT).  Calling across the night:

                                    MISS FOSTER
                    I don't think so, Doctor.  And if

                    What, so you can arrest me? 

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Just listen!!  I saw the Adiposian
          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow 
                      instructions!  They know it's a
                    crime, breeding on Earth, so what's
                    the one thing they want to get rid

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Exactly!  Mum and Dad have got the
                    kids, they don't need the nanny
                    any more!

      MID-SHOT, on Miss Foster... as the LIGHT SNAPS OFF! 
      Darkness.  She looks left and right, held in the air for a
      second like a cartoon coyote.  Then -

      FX: WIDE SHOT as Miss Foster falls, plummets, screaming,
      out of the bottom of frame -

      Donna turns to the Doctor, flinches, with the OOV crunch!

      The Doctor puts his arm around her.  So sorry.

      Then both look up, hearing the whine of engines...

      FX: A WINDOW crammed full of ADIPOSE.  Mewling.  They look
      sad.  A little wave from one of them, bye bye.

      FX: PULLING OUT, the WINDOW set in the SPACESHIP, and the
      Ship hurtles away, into space, away from Earth, gone...

      THE DOCTOR & DONNA stroll out.  Exhausted.  Calm.  Way off
      in the distance, there are signs of the disruption - POLICE
      BARRIERS, FLASHING LIGHTS.  An AMBULANCE and PARAMEDICS
      closer to the building (hiding the remains of Miss Foster).

      The Doctor looks at the SONIC PEN, decides naah, chucks it
      away, gets out the SONIC SCREWDRIVER, jams it into his
      GIZMO, points the whole thing up -

      FX: a SMALL BLUE PULSE OF LIGHT flies up, into the sky...

                                      DONNA
                    What's that?

          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow 
                    Sending a statement to the Shadow

                    I hate being official, brrr.

      PENNY appears.  Staggering.  She is still tied to her chair,
      having to hold it behind her.  Wild-eyed and furious:

                                      PENNY
                    You two!  You're just... mad!

                    report you!  For madness!

      She runs off towards the distant POLICE, like a lunatic.

                                      DONNA
                    Some people just can't take it.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    Nope.

                                      DONNA

      The street from sc.50, DONNA running in, realising that
      her car is near the TARDIS, though a fair distance between
      them.  THE DOCTOR is the definition of dubious.

                                      DONNA
                    That's my car!  That's like destiny!

                    packed ages ago, just in case -

      And she's opening the boot, hauling out a suitcase, another,
      a carpet bag, a valise, a trolley-thing, two plastic bags -

      She shoves them at the Doctor, piling them up in his arms -

                    anywhere, I've gotta be prepared -

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    You've got a hatbox.

          DW4 - Ep1 - Yellow 
      She swings the boot shut, slam - !

      JUMP CUT TO DONNA dumping her armfuls of stuff by the
        www.thewriterstale.com
      Tardis, THE DOCTOR standing back, still weighed down with
      luggage; so she's in the Tardis doorway, with him facing
      her, the opposite of the end of 3.X.

                                      DONNA (CONT'D)
                    - I don't need injections, do I? 
                    Y'know, like when you go to
                    Cambodia, is there any of that? 
                    Cos my friend Veena went to Bahrain,
                    and... you're not saying very much.

                                    THE DOCTOR
                    No, but it's just...  It's a funny
                    old life, in the Tardis, it's not...

                    I'm not saying that.

                                      DONNA

                    streak of nothing.  Alien nothing.

                    I'd love it.

      And she's gone.  The Doctor stands there for a second,
      looking at the luggage, wondering, what the hell..?  But
      then crucially, he smiles.  Starts picking up the bags.

                                                                            CUT TO:Doctor Who 4 - Episode 1 - Yellow Amendments - 16/10/07         Page 56.
