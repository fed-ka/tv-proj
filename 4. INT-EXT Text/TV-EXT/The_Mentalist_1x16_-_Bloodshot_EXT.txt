      Morning.  GOVERNMENT TYPES hurry to get to work.  JANE pulls 
      up in his CAR.  Waves to the GUARD, TOMMY, 40's, at the main 
      gate.

                                  JANE
                    Hello, Tommy. 

                                  TOMMY
                    'Morning, Mr. Jane.  Have a good 
                    one.

                                  JANE
                    You too.  

      Jane swipes his security badge, pulls in and parks.  As he 
      climbs out, he glances at the busy COFFEE CART near the 
      building entrance.  Standing in line, waiting for their 
      drinks, VAN PELT chats and smiles with a handsome YOUNG MAN, 
      late 20's, (who we'll later learn is DAN HOLLENBECK) in the 
      full garb of a young corporate lawyer or lobbyist -- square 
      suit, light coat over his arm, briefcase. 

      Jane can't help but smile as he clocks Van Pelt's body 
      language around the young man; a coy smile, her hand brushing 
      against his, a whisper, and finally a peck on the cheek 
      before they part.  Jane enters the building before Van Pelt 
      sees him.


      GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES exit the building in a calm, orderly 
      fashion.  SECURITY OFFICERS direct the evacuation.  MINELLI 
      files out with Lisbon and Jane.  In the BG, Cho, Van Pelt and 
      Rigsby are explaining to Uni Officers what's happened.  

                                    MINELLI
                    Another bomb threat.  That's the 
                    third this year. 

                                  JANE
                    Not on my phone it isn't.

                                    MINELLI
                    Granted they don't usually come 
                    into CBI, but that's what the 
                    drills are for.

                                  JANE
                    The text read, "Are you smart 
                    enough to find it?" I think this 
                    was directed at me.

                                  LISBON 
                    Well, of course you think it's about  *
                    you.  Just relax.  It's probably  *
                    nothing.  It could be a hoax.

                                  JANE
                    Could be.

                                    MINELLI
                    Where's the bomb squad?

                                  LISBON
                    A few minutes away.  PD's doing a  *
                      preliminary sweep of the building.  
                    So far they haven't found anything.   *

      Jane looks around -- curious, suspicious.

                                  JANE
                          (sotto)
                    Are you smart enough to find it?

                                    MINELLI
                    Okay, listen, if this really is 
                    about Jane, I don't want --

      Jane's walking away at a clip toward the parking lot.

                                    MINELLI (CONT'D)
                    Hey...

      Lisbon sighs, follows him.  

                                  LISBON
                    Jane, stop right there.

      Minelli's PHONE RINGS.  He answers. 

                                    MINELLI
                          (into phone)
                    Minelli.  Yessir, let me explain 
                    what's happened...

      As Lisbon goes after Jane --


      Rows of cars.  Jane walks through the lot, followed by 
      Lisbon.  

                                  LISBON
                    Where are you going?  You know the 
                    rules.  We have to wait for the all 
                    clear.  

                                  JANE
                    Come on, don't be scared.  

                                  LISBON
                    I'm not scared.  I'm following 
                    protocol.  




                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST        "Bloodshot"        YELLOW 1/16/09        5.
      CONTINUED:44

                                  JANE
                    The text said a very large bomb.  A 
                    large bomb can only be transported 
                    in a large car.  And it didn't say 
                    inside CBI, it said nearby.  Ergo -- 
                    the parking lot. Simple.

                                  LISBON
                    Exactly.  They challenged you with 
                    an easy puzzle.  They want you to 
                    find the bomb.  

                                  JANE
                    If there is a bomb. Probably a hoax 
                    like you said....

      Jane looks into one car, then another.  Comes to a VAN and 
      eyes it curiously.  He circles the vehicle, pausing to look 
      through a porthole window in the side.  

      JANE'S POV -- Inside he sees a MAN, 40's, dressed in suit 
      pants and a bloodied dress shirt, his wrists chained and 
      suspended over his head.  His mouth gagged and he has the 
      words "YOU'RE NEXT" written on his forehead in black felt tip. 

      Jane KNOCKS on the glass.

                                  JANE (CONT'D)
                    Whoa.  Hey...?

      The MAN, 40ish, panicked, turns to see Jane.  Jane tries the 
      door, but it's locked.  The man pulls, gesturing toward the 
      front of the van.  Jane runs to the front and peers inside.

      This time, on the driver's seat, Jane sees an EXPLOSIVE 
      DEVICE WITH A CRUDE DIGITAL TIMER. 

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Lisbon -- found it.

      Lisbon hurries over.

      ANGLE ON: The timer on the bomb ticking down in seconds.  
          20...19...18...17...

      Jane rushes around, trying the other doors.  No luck.  Lisbon 
      sees the clock ticking down.  10...9...8...

                                  LISBON
                    Oh no.

                                  JANE 
                    Use your gun to break the window!

      Lisbon starts pulling at Jane.


                                                                            (CONTINUED)      THE MENTALIST        "Bloodshot"        YELLOW 1/16/09        6.

                    There isn't time.  Come on. 

      Jane hesitates.  5...4...

      ANGLE ON: The MAN inside the car, struggling, terrified. 

      Jane looks deep into the frightened eyes of the man inside 
      the car.  Lisbon tugs at him again.

                                  LISBON (CONT'D)
                    Jane... run!

      Lisbon takes off ahead of him.  Jane follows a couple of 
      yards behind her.

      ANGLE ON: The bomb ticking down.  3...2...

      They're both in a full sprint when KA-BOOM!  The VAN 
      EXPLODES, launching ten feet in the air and flipping over.  
      The blast throws Jane over the hood of a small car and face 
      down on the concrete.  Lisbon -- unhurt -- rushes to his aid.

      Jane coughs, perhaps a bit dazed and hyperventilating.  

                                  LISBON (CONT D)
                    Are you alright?

                                  JANE
                    I'm okay.  I just...

                    I need an ambulance... NOW. 

      Jane props himself up.  

                                  JANE
                    No ambulance.  I just... there's 
                    something in my eyes.  I...
                          (cough...)

      And as he stares up at Lisbon, eyes wide, scared --

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    I can't see.

      FADE IN:


      A comfortable moneyed suburban house.  Cho and Rigsby watch 
      as LAURI MEDINA, 40ish, devastated, puts her DAUGHTERS, 10 
      and 8, in her SISTER'S CAR.  

                                  LAURI
                    Girls, I love you.  Be good with 
                    your Aunty Rose, okay?

      Lauri kisses her girls and they pull away.  

                                  CHO
                    Sweet kids.

                                  LAURI

                    We have a couple of questions about

                                  LAURI
                    This is crazy.  I kissed him 
                    goodbye when he left for work this 
                    morning, and now...   

                                  CHO
                    He didn't seem preoccupied?  
                    Troubled by anything unusual? 

                                  LAURI
                      Preoccupied, yes, but there was 
                    nothing unusual about it.  My 
                    husband was a stock broker.  These 
                    days that's like being a 
                      professional gambler.

                    Do you know how many clients have 
                    lost money over the last six 
                    months?  A lot of people are angry, 
                    and they blame their brokers.  He 
                    got hate letters, phone calls, e-

                                  RIGSBY
                    Any specific threats?  Did he ever

                                  LAURI
                    No, but talk to his partners.  
                    They'll know.  They're getting 
                    threats too.  


      A line of CLUB-GOERS dressed for action, line up to get past 
      a velvet rope controlled by a SNARKY CLUB KID and TERRY 
      ANDREWS in a cheap tux.  He's a big man.  Rigsby and Lisbon 
      approach.

                    You, Little Miss Fierce, can come 
                    in.  But lose the back-up dancer.  
                    Too too butch.

      Lisbon gives him a level look.  Flashes her badge.

                    bottle of fine french brandy and a 
                    good Havana cigar.

                    I got nothing to say.  I didn't do 
                    it. 

      Andrews turns to go.  Rigsby reaches out and grabs his arm, 
      but Andrews pulls it free and shoves Rigsby back hard into a 
      crowd of club-goers.  He looks down at Lisbon.

      Lisbon hits him with a small stun gun and he drops like a 
      sack of potatoes.  The crowd gawks and chatters.

                                  RIGSBY
                    Fun's over, people.  Back up.  Give 
                    him some air.

                                  LISBON
                    Are you okay, Mr. Andrews?  

        Disoriented, Andrews stares up at Lisbon and nods.

                                                                          FADE OUT.

                                        ACT TWO

      FADE IN: 


      This time a younger Jane sits outside overlooking the sea as 
      he meets with CAROL GENTRY, 30's, tough, but holding back 
      tears.  Jane sips a glass of wine, just the tiniest bit bored 
      by his job...






                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST        "Bloodshot"        YELLOW 1/16/09        32.
      CONTINUED:2222

                                  JANE
                          (bestowing a grace)
                    She forgives you, Carol.  Your 
                    mother truly forgives you.

                                  CAROL
                    I don't understand, Mr. Jane.  She 
                    forgives me?

                                  JANE
                    Yes.  That's what she says.  And I 
                    believe she's sincere.

      Beat.  Carol gets angry.

                                  CAROL
                    She was a vicious evil abusive 
                    woman.  But I loved her and cared 
                    for her like a good daughter.  What 
                    did I ever do that she should 
                    forgive me for?  

      Jane realizes he's made a mistake.  He changes tack to 
      preserve his calm omniscience.

                                  JANE
                    It's a hard truth, but people don't 
                    change when they pass on.  They 
                    simply become the essence of who 
                    they are.  Your mother was a 
                      complicated --

                                  CAROL
                    -- She forgives me?  That lunatic 
                    bitch forgives me?

                                  JANE
                    People are very complicated, aren't 
                    they?  I'm afraid that's all we 
                    have time for this week, Carol.    

      Carol's anger deflates into self-loathing sadness.

                                  CAROL
                    Oh.  Okay, yes.  Sorry.  I just...   
                      I don't... 

                                  JANE
                    Let's talk more about all this next 
                    time, shall we? 

                                  CAROL
                    Yes, okay.



                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST        "Bloodshot"        YELLOW 1/16/09        33.

      She hands him a check. 

                                  CAROL (CONT D)
                    Thank you, Mr. Jane.

      Jane smiles sympathetically at her and pockets the check.

      END FLASHBACK


      Cho and Lisbon exit the elevators, walking Robert Lynch out 
      of the building. 

                                  LYNCH
                      Interesting.  Paul Krager's a name 
                    I haven't heard in a while.  He 
                    never even entered my mind.  

                                  LISBON
                    What can you tell us about his 
                    personal life? 

                                  LYNCH
                    Well, we've all made our mistakes 
                    over the years.  Fat wallets and 
                    good wine can do that to a man.  

                                  CHO
                    You're referring to his divorce?




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST        "Bloodshot"        YELLOW 1/16/09        38.
        CONTINUED:26B26B

                                  LYNCH
                    That was no divorce... that was a 
                    massacre.  His wife remarried, I 
                    think.  But Krager's whole world 
                    fell apart.  Work-wise, he never 
                      recovered.  Went off the rails to 
                    be frank.  We had to let him go. 

      They push through the outside doors to the busy street and 
      walk toward a waiting TOWN CAR.  

                                  LISBON
                    Who actually did the firing?

                                  LYNCH
                    Now that you mention it, Jimmy 
                    Medina did.  Jim did a lot of the 
                    axe-work here.  Unfortunate part of 
                    the job. 

      This understandably resonates with Lisbon and Cho.

                                  CHO
                    Any idea where we could find Krager 
                    now?

      Lynch is about to climb into the waiting car, hesitates.

                                  LYNCH
                    Last I heard, someone saw him at a 
                    church soup kitchen during the 
                    holidays.  There but for the grace 
                    of God... if you know what I mean. 

      Lynch slips into the car and closes the door.  As Cho and 
      Lisbon watch him pull away --



      Jane, Van Pelt and Dan emerge from the building and come down  *
      the steps.  Suddenly Jane HEARS Tommy, the Guard, chaining  *
      the front gate for the evening.  

                                  JANE
                    Hey, Tommy... you still here?

                                  TOMMY
                    Closing up, Mr. Jane.  You folks 
                    need anything?

      And with that, Jane turns and elbows Dan hard in the gut 
      EXPOSING THE GUN IN HIS HAND. 

                                  JANE
                    Run, Grace! *

      Van Pelt and Jane take off.  The Guard sees the gun in Dan's 
      hand and draws his sidearm. 

                                  TOMMY
                    Freeze!




                                                                            (CONTINUED)    THE MENTALIST        "Bloodshot"        YELLOW 1/16/09        51A.

      Dan raises the 9MM and fires at Tommy.  The two exchange 
      gunfire as Jane (holding onto Van Pelt's shoulder) runs for 
      the side gate. 

                                  VAN PELT
                    Jane, grab hold of me!

      Tommy is injured and drops to the ground.  Van Pelt guides  *
      Jane scurrying across the street.  Dan leaves Tommy writhing  *
      in pain and hurries to catch the others.   *


      Jane and Van pelt duck down trying to get cover as they dodge 
      between cars in the crowded lot.  

                                  JANE
                    Get us to your car.

                                  VAN PELT
                    But I can't drive. 

                                  JANE
                    We'll manage.

      Dan scans the dark lot, waiting for Jane and Van Pelt to show 
      themselves.  There they are.  BLAM! BLAM!  Jane and Van Pelt 
      make it to Van Pelt's JEEP.  

                                  JANE (CONT D)
                    Keys!

                                  VAN PELT
                    In my front left pants pocket.

      Jane delves into Van Pelt's pants pocket and retrieves the 
      car keys.  Beeps the door open.  They scramble to get in as 
      Dan, an excited look on his face, shoots at them front across 
      the lot.  BLAM! BLAM! 


        ESTABLISHING gorgeous DAYBREAK.  Birds singing, a breeze in 
      the trees, the Sacramento River rolling by.
