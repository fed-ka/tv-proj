High in the air----so high we an see the curvature of the

clouds.
As we dissolve in closer the picture bleaches of color.
We
are looking down at the city of Washington, D.C.

THE BRIDGE
A small yacht. Osbourne stands at the wheel, a light wind in
his face, as the boat sails under motor power.
After a beat he moves to the front of the boat.
An old man sits on a bench on the prow facing out into the
wind. He has snowy hair and a stern Yankee face. He wears a
tweed cap. He doesn't much react to Osbourne's approach.
OSBOURNE
You okay there, Dad?
The old man remains silent, staring. Osbourne sits next to
him and idly tucks in the plaid blanket resting over the
man's knees.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
... Dad, I left my job at the
Agency...
The old man stares out into the wind.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
... I, uh... I'm sorry. Dad,
government service is not what it was
when you were in State. Things are
different now. I don't know, maybe
it's... it's... the Cold War ending;
now it seems like it's all bureaucracy
and no mission...
The old man stares out into the wind.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
... I'm writing a memoir. I think
it's going to be pretty explosive.
But I don't think you'll disapprove.
I don't think you'll disapprove.
Katie has had trouble accepting it.
(MORE)
12.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
But... sometimes there's a higher
patriotism, Dad. So we'll... Yes,
change is hard. It's hard on Katie.
But we'll be okay. We'll be okay.
Life is change. This is good. We
were all blocked up, Katie and me.
This is, this is a blessing in
disguise. I'll go into training, you
know. Lay off the sauce. Like you
did. You managed to do it. Finally.
And then I can concentrate on, you
know. New beginning. And this'll all
have been for the best. Don't you
think Dad?
The old man stares out into the wind.
Osbourne sniffles.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
... Cold.
He taps the old man on the knee and rises.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
... I guess we should head back.

LONG SHOT THRU THE WINDSHIELD OF A CAR
The sailboat docked at the end of a marina. Osbourne is
pushing the old man in a wheel chair down the pier away from
the boat.
A MAN'S VOICE
We've seen this...
11
18
As before, the boat, docked at the end of the marina pier, is
seen in long shot through the windshield of a car.
Closer on the boat. As water laps against pilings and the
boat gently bobs and creaks, we hear, muffled, the sounds of
a couple having sex. When it builds to climax we cut:
19
22
Long-lens, hand-held, point-of-view seeming: Harry Pfarrer is
jogging in his Treasury sweats.
Closer on him.
Brow furrows.
He spins, jogs backwards,
looking.
His point-of-view: nothing unusual; traffic on the bridge, no
pedestrians particularly close.
Harry, mildly puzzled, slows and stops.
He turns again.
Point-of-view up the bridge: empty.
Harry starts jogging again.

Linda is showing someone around the floor.
LINDA
This is the cardio area. A lot of
machines here so that, believe me,
there's never a wait. What you're
seeing now, this is our busiest time,
and there's still a couple of open
treadmills I see, three Stairmasters----
I call it the Butt-Blaster----couple of
LifeCycles----Hi, Chad.
Chad is working with a medicine ball and a heavy young woman.
CHAD
Hi Linda.
Did you call that guy?
LINDA
Not yet! Chad is one of our trainers.
I've just started internet dating and
I got my first look at the, uh...
CUSTOMER
What service?
LINDA
BeWithMeDC dot com?
CUSTOMER
Nice.
LINDA
Have you used them?
25.
CUSTOMER
No----two friends did and they're both
hooked up. With really special guys.
LINDA
That's fantastic.
32
34
Linda walks down the promenade dressed in a smart pant suit.
Her moving POV passes over a couple in conversation, an old
woman feeding the birds, a man in a business suit reading a
newspaper.
She passes the man and turns around. He has looked up from
the paper and is staring at her. He wears aviator-shaped
glasses with clear plastic rims. He may have hair plugs.
LINDA
Alan?

Are you, uh... Linda?

Long lens, hand-held, point-of-view seeming: Harry is pushing
a red shopping cart through the parking lot. Standing in the
cart are lengths of metal tubing that he steadies with one
hand as he pushes.

Harry is just getting out of the wagon which is parked in the
driveway of the suburban house.

They are walking to a black Town Car idling curbside.
Pink Revision 8/14/07 47.
SANDY
It better be the Peninsula. The money
I make for them. Are you gonna be
okay?
HARRY
I'll be sad. But I'll be okay.
SANDY
Not too sad..
HARRY
Just the right amount.
He kisses her.
HARRY (CONT'D)
... I am crazy about you, baby.
He slams the car door after her. As the car pulls out his
look travels with it and then lingers up the street, caught
on:
A Ford Taurus, parked, dark.
Harry hesitates, then starts walking up the street towards
the parked car.
When he has taken several steps the ignition is turned in the
car. A shape briefly visible in the driver's seat is lost
when the headlights flash on. The car pulls out from the
curb into a U-turn and drives away.
Harry watches the tail lights recede.

63
Linda walks down the promenade, dressed in a smart pant suit.
Her moving POV passes over people relaxing in the park: a
mother with a stroller, kids running with a ball. Her look
settles on the bench that formerly held her first date, now
occupied by:
A man spitting sunflower seeds.
Harry Pfarrer.
The point-of-view arcs past him as Linda gives him the once-
over.
She doubles back.
LINDA
Harry?
I'm Linda.

Behind Hardbodies. Linda and Chad emerge from the health
club through a heavy back door.
LINDA
No, you can't go like that!
You gotta
wear a suit.
CHAD
Well----you mean----go home and change?
LINDA
Yeah!
CHAD
I was gonna ride my bike.
Do I have

CLOSE ON A WATCH
Showing 2:20.
Wider shows Osbourne Cox, sitting in a car parked on a
downtown street, consulting his watch.
He looks up, irritated, and glances around.
His look is
arrested by:
The side-view mirror. It shows a man approaching on bicycle
along the sidewalk wearing a suit and a bike helmet. The man
dismounts several paces behind the parked car, locks his bike
to a fence separating the sidewalk from a small park, and
takes off his helmet. It is Chad.
He walks along the sidewalk to the car, opens the passenger
door and sits in with his bike helmet clamped under one arm.
56.
CHAD
Osbourne Cox?
OSBOURNE
And you, I take it, are "Mr. Black"?
CHAD
Yes I am.
You have the money?
OSBOURNE
The fifty-thousand dollars.
CHAD
That's what was agreed upon, Osbourne
Cox.
OSBOURNE
All right. Let me explain something
to you, "Mr. Black." You know who I
am; I know who you are.
CHAD
(smug)
Perhaps. But appearances can be----
deceptive.
OSBOURNE
Yeah. What you're engaged in is
blackmail, which is a felony. That's
for starters.
CHAD
Appearances can be----deceptive.
I am a
mere Good Samar----
OSBOURNE
Secondly, the unauthorized
dissemination of classified material
is a federal crime. If you ever
carried out your proposed threat, you
would experience such a shitstorm of
consequences, my friend, it would make
your empty little head spin faster
than your Schwinn bicycle over there.
Chad chuckles.
CHAD
You think that's a Schwinn?
OSBOURNE
Now give me the fucking floppy or the
CD or whatever the fuck you have it
on, and I will----
57.
CHAD
As soon as you give me the money,
dickwad! I'm not----Huhgf!
Osbourne has punched him in the nose.
Chad stares at him, stunned.
His nose starts bleeding.
CHAD (CONT'D)
... You fuck!
OSBOURNE
Give it to me, fuck!
CHAD
You fuck!
You fucker!
He opens the car door and gets out, hand to his nose.
He slams the door.

As Chad goes over to his bike Osbourne leans across the front
seat and cranks down the passenger window to bellow:
OSBOURNE
I know who you are, fucker!
He pulls out.
CHAD
You're the fucker!
There is the honk of a car horn----not Osbourne's.
Chad looks, surprised.
Linda is pulling up.
Her passenger
window rolls down.
LINDA
Where's the money?
CHAD
He hit me!
LINDA
Where's the money?!
CHAD
He didn't give it to me
58.
LINDA
Oh, for----Get in!
Chad does.
CHAD
That fucker!
71
71
He is thrown back against the seat as Linda floors it.
Recovering:
CHAD
... Hey----what're you----
Linda is coming up fast behind Osbourne's car in traffic.
CHAD (CONT'D)
Oh shit!
The crash of impact----ramming Osbourne.
72

He recoils from the impact.
OSBOURNE
Holy fucking----you fucking morons!

The follow car is speeding up again----but it doesn't hit him.

He is escorting to a movie theater entrance.
HARRY (CONT'D)

LINDA
Oh!
No, no I haven't.
Our follow-move brings in a light box displaying the one-
sheet for Totally Stoked! with Dermot Mulroney and Claire

As they tail out of frame:

THRU A WINDSHIELD
Night.
Rain.
The car corners into a driveway and its headlights rake the
front of the Cox townhouse, which is dark. A couple of
pieces of luggage and several cardboard boxes are stacked on
the stoop, most of them protected from the rain by the eave
but some not.
OSBOURNE'S VOICE
What the fuck?
OUTSIDE
The car stops. Osbourne emerges, runs through the rain to
the front stoop. Rain drums against cardboard.
OSBOURNE
What the fuck?
He puts his key in the lock and----it doesn't turn.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
... Fucking...
He nudges a cardboard box with his toe.
He looks up at the dark house, squinting against the rain.

LONG LENS POINT-OF-VIEW
A car is pulling into the driveway.
Katie Cox emerges from
the driver's side.
Reverse shows Chad, in his suit, watching from a parked car
across the street.
Now Harry Pfarrer emerges from the passenger side wearing a
brown pin-striped suit. Encumbered by something bulky he
follows Katie up the walk.
It seems to be some kind of pillow or cushion under his arm,
but very large, and wedge-shaped. Katie is letting herself
in; Harry gives a furtive glance around----as Chad sinks back
in his car seat----before entering with the wedge-cushion.
The door closes.
Chad relaxes, straightens up.
A beat.
He looks idly around.
He notices:
Another car, parked on the same side of the street, further
up. Someone is just straightening from a slouch to become
visible over the driver's headrest.
Chad looks, puzzled.
94
94
Chad is sucking the dregs of his Jamba Juice up a straw when
a noise brings his look around:
74.
The door to the townhouse is opening. Katie emerges, in a
change of clothes. Harry follows in sweats.
They get into her car.
It pulls out.
Chad watches it go up the street.
He is about to open his
door but pauses, seeing:
The parked car up the street. Katie's car having passed, it
now pulls out and follows at a discreet distance. Both cars
disappear.
Chad opens his door and gets out. He is crossing to the
townhouse when he notices another car parked on the other
side of the street. A man sits in the driver's seat,
smoking.
Chad proceeds on to the house. There is a barred garden-
level door tucked under the stoop. Chad checks out the
caging on the door. He looks up the faade of the house.
95
95
It pulls over at one end of the Potomac bridge that we have
seen before. Harry emerges.
HARRY
What's the odometer say?
KATIE
Five.
HARRY
About five or approximately five?
I
mean----about f----
KATIE
For fuck's sake, Harry, it's five
miles. Five point two.
HARRY
Okay, fine----I gotta do at least five.
Five and a deuce is okay.
KATIE
I'm surprised you have any energy
left.
HARRY
You kiddin'----pull around the corner
we'll do it again in back!
75.
KATIE
You are very coarse.
HARRY
No, back of the car.
I didn't mean a
rear-entry, uh----
KATIE
Ach.
I'm late----
The car squeals away, leaving Harry on the shoulder.
96
96
Chad is cornering the house on the driveway side, appraising.
A low wall separates driveway from back garden. Chad gives a
quick glance around.
97
97
Chad vaults the wall to land in the garden.
The garden steps down to a back door. Chad checks out the
windows in back, then goes to the door. It is locked. It
has a large window.

HARRY JOGGING
He spins, jogs backward.
His point-of-view: a car, traveling slowly.
Following?
Harry cuts across a park lawn.

HARRY
Emerging from the park onto another street. He looks around
and, satisfied that he has lost the tail, jogs on.
102

HARRY
Jogging, entering a residential area.
104
119 *
Harry stomps to his car in the driveway and flings in the
cushion. He gets in, seething. After a beat he pulls out
his cell phone and dials.
A ring.
Pick-up.
A female voice:
SANDY
Hello?
HARRY
Honey.
It's so good to hear your
voice.
SANDY
Something wrong, Harry?
HARRY
No. Yes. Can you come home?
Your
baby needs you.
A beat.
HARRY (CONT'D)
... Can you please come home?
SANDY
Harry, you know I----
HARRY
I can show you your present.
It's
finished.
SANDY
Oh Harry.
I can't just leave the book
tour.
Harry sags.
HARRY
Yeah.
SANDY
There are two days left.
There's
still Seattle.
HARRY
Yeah.
Blue Revision 8/1/07 91.
SANDY
I love you, Harry.
HARRY
Okay.
Yeah. Love you too.
He folds the phone, miserable.
As he pockets it his attention is caught by something in the
side-view mirror:
The car parked across the street.
A man's shape in the
driver's seat.
120
120 *
Harry, jaw set, gets out of the car and starts down the
drive.
The parked car starts.
HARRY
Hey!
Fucker!
The car tries to pull out but is closely hemmed in by cars
front and back; it will need a couple moves.
Harry runs back to his own car, starts it, throws it into
reverse and backs straight down the drive toward the
frantically shuttling car.
He t-bones it.
VOICE FROM WITHIN CAR
Fucker!
Harry, amped, throws his car into drive, pulls halfway up the
driveway.
HARRY
Fucker!
Fucker!
He again throws the car into reverse.
The man in the other car abandons his attempt to pull out and
scrambles frantically toward the passenger side.
Harry again smashes into the car.
Blue Revision 8/1/07 92.
121
121 *
The other man emerges from the far side. He flees down the
sidewalk as fast as his weight will permit, pocket change
jingling, yelling as he runs:
MAN
Fucker!
Harry runs after him, calling:
HARRY
Who do you work for?!
Who do you work
for?!
Pounding footsteps.
HARRY (CONT'D)
... Tell me!
The overweight man does not have Harry's stamina: Harry
closes, leaps, and tackles.
He crawls up the man's body, hand-over-hand, panting:
HARRY (CONT'D)
... Who do you work for? CIA?
NSC?
The other man is panting much harder:
MAN
Tuchman Marsh!
This stops Harry.
He isn't sure what he's heard.
HARRY
What?
MAN
Tuchman Marsh!
HARRY
... Tuchman Marsh?
MAN
Yes!
HARRY
Your name is... Tuchman Marsh?
MAN
Tuchman Marsh Hauptman Rodino!
93.
Harry stares at the man underneath him.
The gasping man
explains:
MAN (CONT'D)
... I work for them!
HARRY
You... work for Tuchman Marsh.
MAN
Yes!
HARRY
Which is a law firm.
MAN
No! A rock band!
Yes, it's a law
firm!
HARRY
Well... why are you following me?
MAN
Divorce action, numbnuts!
Harry is blindsided.
He stares.
He slowly sits up,
digesting:
HARRY
My... my wife hired you?!
The freed Tuchman Marsh man also sits up, still panting
heavily.
MAN
No. Your wife hired Tuchman Marsh.
Tuchman Marsh hired me. I work for
Tuchman Marsh.
HARRY
You're----you're----a divorce detective.
MAN
Not just.
Credit, missing persons,
whatever.
HARRY
But this is divorce.
MAN
("duh")
Well... yeah.
94.
Harry rises and walks stiffly, zombie-like, up the street.
The man watches him go.
After a few paces Harry stops and sits on the curb.
He
starts weeping.
The man, still breathing heavily, calls out:
MAN (CONT'D)
... Jesus----grow up, man!
It happens
to everybody!
Harry's cell phone chirps.
He fishes it out and unfolds it,
sniveling.
HARRY
Yeah?
VOICE
Harry, it's Osbourne Cox.
Harry stares, trying to fit this in.
Osbourne prompts, after
a silent beat:
VOICE (CONT'D)
... Harry?
HARRY
Yeah?
OSBOURNE
Harry, could I get your wife's number?
This is Osbourne Cox, could I trouble
you for your wife's----
HARRY
You can't tell her anything she
doesn't already know, fucker.
OSBOURNE
What?
Harry again stares: maybe he has this figured wrong.
After a silence:
OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
...Is this... Harry Pfarrer?
HARRY
You want... Sandy's number?
Echoing up the street:
Blue Revision 8/1/07 95.
MAN
Can I use your phone?
To call a tow?
122
We are looking at the exterior of the house in wide shot.

Peaceful neighborhood. Birds chirp.

From inside the house, though, we can faintly hear sobs,

punctuated by sounds of exertion. Each gasp of effort ends

in a dull clang.

Ted stares, horrified.
After a beat:
TED
No-o-o-o-o-o way.
No way.
Whoa.
No
way, Linda...
She sits opposite him in his office.
Ted shakes his head.
TED (CONT'D)
... No.
LINDA
But Ted, I can't do it, I don't know
anything about computers.
100.
TED
Linda, the whole thing is crazy. It
was crazy the first time, and you want
to do it again? Break into the man's
house? And why would----why would----you
said the Russians didn't even want
this stuff!
LINDA
My world is bigger than that, Ted.
There's other people. There's the
Chinese.
TED
Linda, these surgeries----
LINDA
It's not just the surgeries, Ted!
It's not just the money! We can use
it as leverage! To get Chad back!
TED
What do you mean "get him back"!
LINDA
Information is power, Ted!
Hel-lo!
TED
What do you mean "get him back"!
You
don't know where he is!
LINDA
Somebody has him.
And we can----
TED
You ask the police to help you find
missing people! And you----
LINDA
I can't take it! I can't take it! I
can't take it! You know I can't do
that! We're operating off the map
here, Ted! This is way higher than
the police, it's higher than that!
TED
Linda, I----
LINDA
I need a can-do person, Ted! I hate
your negativity! I hate all your
reasons why not! I hate you! I hate
you!
Blue Revision 8/1/07 101.
Weeping, she storms out.
Ted stares, shell-shocked.
130
135
The hatch is thrown open and Osbourne emerges from below.
There is a large built-in toolbox just by the hatch. He
yanks it open and pulls out a hatchet.
OSBOURNE
New keys...
136
DOCK
136
Osbourne strides grimly down the dock in his bathrobe,
hatchet in hand.
137
138
Osbourne's crumple-backed car roars up. It cuts a corner of
the lawn and squeals to a halt in the drive. Osbourne
emerges, still in robe and pyjamas, with the hatchet.
He goes to the front door and bashes at the knob with the
blunt end of the hatchet.
OSBOURNE
New... fucking... keys... How's this
for access...
Hardware starts to fall off and jangle onto the stoop.
Osbourne tries the sharp end of the hatchet a couple times,
decides he prefers the blunt end.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
... How's this for motherfucking
access...
More things fall off.
The knob wobbles in the door.
Osbourne pushes the door open.
139
142
People sit on benches eating lunches. Harry Pfarrer is on
the bench where he and Linda met, once again spitting
sunflower seeds.
Linda walks up.
They greet each other with a kiss.
HARRY
Hello there sunshine.
You look great.
LINDA
Well you seem better.
Harry does indeed seem more like his old self.
HARRY
Yeah, I snuck in a little gym time
this morning. And our exercise last
night didn't hurt!
Linda is shocked but secretly pleased:
LINDA
Harry!
109.
HARRY
Boy, I am through banging my head
against the wall. I am gonna start
doing what's right for me.
LINDA
That's how I believe, also.
You have
to do what's right for----
HARRY
Yeah! Hell yeah! I mean I had a
shock recently, and I realized you
know, life is not infinite. No one's
immortal.
LINDA
No one's immortal.
HARRY
You have to get from each day its
full, uh, squeeze the juice from every
day because there but for the grace of
God----
LINDA
Exactly. The important thing is to
maintain a positive outlook. Always
up. Always ebullient.
HARRY
That's right, don't sweat the small
stuff...
Linda chimes in:
Linda and Harry
HARRY (CONT'D)
... and it's all small stuff.
Harry reaches for Linda and she slides closer.
He puts an
arm around her.
HARRY (CONT'D)
This is where we first met.
Remember?
LINDA
Of course I do.
HARRY
You never know what the important days
are, until... until, um...
110.
The thought drifts away as his gaze fixes on something.
With
his look still fixed:
HARRY (CONT'D)
... I told myself I was gonna stop
being paranoid, but... is that guy
looking at us?
Linda follows his look.
On a bench a short distance away a middle-aged man with
aviator glasses and hair plugs is staring at them.
LINDA
(hastily)
No, no.
A slightly overweight woman stops tentatively in front of
the man in the aviator glasses and they start to talk.
Linda turns to Harry.
LINDA (CONT'D)
... Have you found out anything about
Chad?
HARRY
Nothing yet, I've made a couple calls.
I don't think it'll take long.
LINDA
Really?
HARRY
Oh yeah, there are so many data bases
now it's a joke...
Relaxing now that he sees the man in aviator glasses engaged
in conversation, Harry warms to his theme.
HARRY (CONT'D)
... Back when I was in PP there was
still some art to finding people. Not
any more. And now with the cell
phones? Pretty soon they're gonna
know where everyone is. Everyone. At
any given moment. I mean it's almost
the reality now. You would be amazed.
LINDA
Uh-huh.
111.
HARRY
Did he----when you left the Jamba Juice
----did Chad say anything about where he
might be going?
LINDA
Oh, I know where he was going.
HARRY
Oh yeah?
LINDA
A residence in Alexandria.
On
Hillsboro Drive.
Harry has stopped chewing.
He is staring at her.
Linda feels obliged to fill the silence.
LINDA (CONT'D)
... 2055 Hillsboro.
Harry stares.
Linda doesn't know what to make of his fixed
stare.
LINDA (CONT'D)
... It's, um. The residence of a guy
named Osbourne Cox.
Harry is beginning to look sick.
A long silence.
Then, quietly:
HARRY
Who are you?
Now Linda stares, unsure of what to make of the question.
HARRY (CONT'D)
... WHO ARE YOU?
Linda's eyes widen.
She is a little frightened.
People nearby turn to look.
It is a scene.
HARRY (CONT'D)
... WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?
Harry reaches up.
He grabs her by the shoulders and shakes.
HARRY (CONT'D)
... WHO ARE YOU? REALLY?
112.
Linda is at sea.
She answers in a small voice:
LINDA
I'm ... just ... Linda Litzke.
Harry stares at her.
A long beat.
He leaps to his feet and looks around in a panic.
His point-of-view, sweeping the park. Nearby, the man with
plugs, though talking with his date, is looking at him again.
Farther away, a man sits in a curbside sedan. Watching?
Hard to say.
Harry turns and runs.
Linda gapes.
LINDA (CONT'D)
... Harry!
143
144
Linda flings open the door to her car parked on the street
bordering the mall. She gets in and turns the ignition.
Pulling into traffic she checks her rear-view, and her look
snags on:
A dark four-door sedan pulling out a few cars back. It falls
in behind her. Its driver is a man in sunglasses. He
reaches up and touches fingertips to one ear.
Linda frowns.
She looks forward, glances again at the
mirror.
Another dark car pulls into the lane next to the first.
Its
driver is also a man in sunglasses.

LINDA DRIVING
She gives worried glances at her rear-view.
The light ahead turns yellow, red.
Cars ahead stop.
Linda stops.
A rhythmic thudding sound.
It almost makes her car vibrate.
114.
She looks around.
She rolls down her window, sticks her head
out, looks up.
A black helicopter hovers overhead, rotors thudding. A black-
clad body leans partway out. The person seems to be looking
down.
Linda draws her head back in.
LINDA
Oh for Pete's sake.

Ted staggers out of the house, a hand pressed to his chest.
He has reached the front lawn when Osbourne emerges, robe
flapping, pursuing with the hatchet.
OSBOURNE
Intruder!
He quickly catches up to Ted and whacks at him.
TED
Oh!
Osbourne whacks him down.
He keeps whacking at him.
