Rain sloshes against a kitchen window. Where the sink is. Not
far from the kitchen table. Where the LONGFELLOW Family sits,
dinner before them.
HORUS (35) leans over his plate, eating his meal. Here idles a
man of diminutive frame, bespectacled, placid - as harmless as
low fat milk.
He sits opposite MARY (30), frenetically appropriating food. A
gentle beauty. entwined in maternal angst she is estrogen with an
attitude.
A meek little AARON (8), slouches between the folks - a BLACK
EYE tattoos the left of his face. Aaron stares at the damn
plate, finding no humor in eggplant.
MARY
The principal did'nothing. Like
schoolyard terrorism is no worse than
being tardy. What's the matter with
education? Back when, you could go to
school and learn about Betsy Ross and...
mollusks and... not get stabbed on the
way home.
4.
A subway TRAM idles by a passenger ramp. STEAM hisses from its
side and plumes into a wall of white mist.
And from this cloud of angry vapors, a figure appears. He
surfaces from the dark subway tunnel, a cool nonchalance in his
gait.
It is the Superhero, his identity safely concealed under the
collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT. He traverses the loading deck,
PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him.
He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway. He
strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE, up against the grafetti-
raped subway wall.
On the wall, a line of profanity declares that...
"YOUR MOTHER TAKES IT UP THE ASS."
He surveys the machine. His right arm appears from the coat
pocket. Fingers merge into a tight fist. And casually, he rips
into the metal vendor like it was Jello.
His fist withdraws a handful of bills, coins. He pockets the
loot. He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY STRIKE.
Deposits it under his coat.
And with that, he heads for the stairs - to the flooded streets
above.
At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram closes its doors.
Trembles. Moves. Steams into the deep dark tunnel. White SMOKE
mushrooms from its tail. It lingers in the air as we...
see STEAM, rising from a faucet of running HOT water.
It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits
another set of pots. She's clearing the table.
Down a dark hallway, a streak of light escapes from an open
door. Inside and on the bed, the frail posture of Horus changes
out of his clothes.
Horus disrobes down to his t-shirt and briefs. He stands before
the closet mirror, scrutinizing the emaciated, sand-kicked-in-
the-face body.
5.
Horns strikes
a He-man pose, his
biceps in the
wind.
He removes the Police apparel,
plastic. Proceeds to put it on.
EYE MOTEL - NIGHT
FISH
How the fuck can I help you sir?

His blood-shot eyes mean it.
Fish turns to the back wall. Grabs a random KEY from a nail.
FISH
Top floor, 7F. Fifteen a pop, up front.
(re: the check-in sheet)
And your John Hancock makes it sweet.
The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet. Scribbles
HANCOCK
on the dotted line.
Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's
grab.
FISH (CONT'D)
I don't take messages, I don't do favors,
and I don't know you from Jack. You want
sheets, they're extra. Towel's extra.
Plunger's extra.
HANCOCK
I need quiet. Is it quiet?
FISH
Quiet? Hey pal, we look like a public
library to you? The girls work. Some of
them scream, some of them moan...
(SMILES)
and some of them just kinda lay there
cold. You want quiet, I got cotton balls
you can stick in your ear. They're extra.
Hancock eyes Fish, mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare
hands. He withdraws from his coat the WAD of loot. Pushes it
under the window.
And while Fish collects, he leans into the window and emits a
deep GROWL. Fish recoils. The bills fly.
Hancock takes the key. Exchanges it with a metal ORB - the
strangulated remains of the bell. It rolls out of his palm and
CLINKS off the counter.
Hancock sidles off. Fish - the cat's got his tongue.
Horus, in full uniform - dark blue pants, shirt.
7.
He dips into a dresser, pulls out a thick black leather belt -
complete with holster.
Horus returns to the dresser for one final item - It's obscured
by his arm but we feel it to be some heavy chunk of metal.
He confronts the mirror, twirls this piece, holsters it. And we
SEE it to be a FLASHLIGHT.
A shoulder patch reads...
U-RENT SECURITY CO.
Their motto: "TO OBSERVE AND RECORD"
Horus tucks a hat under his arms, ready to move.
A jar of MARBLES rests upon a window ledge. Outside, the story
is rain.
On a bed, sprawled on his back, Aaron gazes up at the empty
ceiling - the black eye squats prominently on his face.
Aaron brings his hand before his eyes. Looks at it. Studies it.
Slowly, his fingers converge into a tight FIST - a boy's
interpretation of a man's weapon.
A gentle KNOCK disperses the knuckles. Horus peers in.
HORUS
How's the eye?
AARON
Black.
Horus enters.
Stands awkwardly before his son.
HORUS
It'll be gone in a week. Mom'11 touch it
up with some make-up and you won't even
know it's there.
AARON
Yeah I will. And I don't want any girly
make-up on my face.
Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13 knees.
B.
HORUS
(almost apologetically)
There'll always be people around
who'll... exert force over those of us
who just want to live in peace.
Aaron listens, observing his father's efforts.
HORUS (CONT' D)
(pain in every word)
The thing to do is... to avoid them.
They're no-wins. Can't-wins. You hold the
anger... and move on. You hold the anger.
(turns to Aaron)
I tell you because I can't take it,
seeing you hurt. You're part of me.
(BEAT)
I've felt what you're feeling now. And if
you've got any of me in you, you're gonna
feel what I felt-when you go up against
one of 'em. Turn away... that's what you
do... the other cheek. You do that for
me. No, you're not the coward. Not you.
No. I'll be the coward, all right? 'Cause
I don't want to see you hurt. I love you.
I ask you to do that for me... your old
man.
And while he utters these words, Mary watches from the dark
hallway - moved b y his affection.
She oversees a father-son embrace.
HORUS (CONT'D)
I'm late for work. Get some sleep.
Tomorrow always feels better...
AARON
.after a good night sleep.
The light FLICKS off and the man's silhouette form exits the
room.
Horus backs his way out. Shuts the door. Mary's hand greets him
from behind.
It startles the man. He.tries to regroup.
HORUS
Mary.
9.
Mary inches closer - passion oozes from every pore. She nestles
up against her husband.
Horus stands uncoordinated, pressing his hands against her back.
He is gentle, but as effective as an armless masturbator.
Mary caresses his neck. Moves her lips to his ear, enraptured

And out of nowhere...

Mary snaps from her trance. Unshackles her hold, like she almost
expected it.

Coffee's by the door.

Mary gazes out at the wet abyss, possessed by some inner
longing.

An open door faces the MOANING TV set. It's the bathroom and
it's occupied by the intensely frazzled image of Hancock.
He squats on the TOILET, pants around the ankles, cape shrouded
around him.
Those unforgiving eyes plant on the TV screen, a cigarette
dangling from the corner of his lip.
We discern the MOANS to be human and we SEE that he is watching
a PORNO flick - flashes of flesh upon flesh in a fucking frenzy.
T.V. SET (O.S.)

Ooh yeah, big fella. That's it. Shoot

Hancock absorbs the action from the can, a glint of pain on his
face.
He takes a long hard drag on the cigarette - a full stick
deteriorates into ashes before our eyes.
And outside, it rains like there's no tomorrow.

An ASHTRAY buried under a mountain of butts.

A MAN ambles pass Mary's line, up towards the front. He cuts off

Tom whips out a sawed-off SHOTGUN from his pants...

He aims the barrel in her face.
TOM (CONT'D)

Thanks, Granny!
Of course, by now, people have realized the implications of the
situation at hand. They begin to panic.
On cue, two new GUNMEN, JERRY and JERRY (30's), emerge from the
crowded bank, both revealing automatic RIFLES.
Jerry #1 drops the SECURITY GUARD with the butt of his gun.
As planned, they take aim at the surveillance CAMERAS on each
end of the bank. BANG. BANG. They miss, much to Tom's chagrin.
The crowd ducks, Mary among them. Terror grips,the queues.
The Jerrys try again. BANG. BANG. No more cameras. And with
,Ir that, Tom takes center stage. He leaps on the teller counter.

Mary, amongst the crowd, watcheson withinterest.
Bradley Elementary School.
Class.is in session, captained by ravishing MS. MILLIS (28).
Lips, legs, lungs - stuff prepubescent wet dreams are made of.
Aaron, nestled mid-room, tries to keep his eyes straight.
He steals a quick look to the back of the room: there, in the
back, a BLONDE boy (8) sits chewing gum.
This kid, from the slicked-back hair and rolled-up t-shirt
sleeves, is a sub-species of vermin.
20.
He taunts Aaron a smile, opens his mouth, and we realize that
he's gnawing on a plastic DOLL HEAD.
Behind the teller window is Tom, assisted by a quite voluptuous
employee - VERONICA, (23), with an IQ to match.
TOM
(to the crowd)
And while I take care of business, my
associates will be making their rounds.
The Jerrys leap into action - guns pointing. They rummage the
helpless patrons for jewelry, cash and collectables.
TOM (CONT'D)

Please be cooperative and more
importantly, charitable. We'd like you to
think of it as donations... for Jerry's

Jerry #2 weaves through crowd waving his automatic wand. People
dish out valuables into his canvas BAG. He arrives at Mary,
motioning at the bag with the rifle.

Jerry #2 returns, bad news on his tongue.
JERRY #2

A wave of SIRENS punctuate their state of "fuck." It crescendoes

Jerry #1 is at the entrance - peering out at doom.
JERRY #1

Time LAPSES. It's 2:30.
Mary turns from the clock, concerned. She studies the situation,
the robbers - an overall glumness tells the story. At the
entrance - Tom. He looks desperate. Irrational. Ready to snap.
23.
The hostages huddle on the floor, tired. They wait.
Tom huddles by the entrance, gun smoking. Cool and suave has
succumbed to psychotic. The Jerrys are nearby, nervous. As are
the hostages, clumped together in fright.
TOM

swiss cheese. All of them!
TED (O.S.)
Time's running out, fellas!
The hostages grimace, hell not so far away.
TOM
I want that car, Ted!
Tom and the Jerrys stand shackled in their spots.
Their eyes wander about, lost in confusion. The WHIR outside
subsides. Stops.
A loaded beat.
Tom, in mid-swallow, watches as a spectacular EXPLOSION of
bricks sprays the air inside. A caped figure bursts into the
scene amidst SCREAMS from clueless hostages.
in the blink of an eye, Hancock has Jerry #2 by the collar. With
a flick of the wrists, Jerry #2 is a human projectile en route
to the windshield of a police vehicle outside.
Jerry #1 opens FIRE on Hancock. Bullets careen off flesh of
steel.
Smoke and debris smother the air. And as they subside, all eyes
fall on the caped figure that is Hancock, erect in the rubble.
Mary can't believe her eyes. She surveys every inch of his
frame, now clean-shaven, combed, comic book perfect.
Hancock scans the crowd of stunned hostages - his eyes pick out
the WOMEN - Veronica's wet smile takes him.
A heartbeat.
HANCOCK
(GOD)
Everybody out, please.
Bodies bang about, all moving for the door.
26.
Mary follows the herd out but her eyes remain on the caped
figure, until real estate ushers her into the street.
The bank floor in shambles. No one in sight. But movement jars
us to the back, where the bank SAFE is.
We SEE Hancock wade through rubble towards the open safe, a
thick steel chamber of commerce. Hancock arrives at the safe.
Confronts the object inside - Tom.
There he is, in the corner, a sweaty piece of misery. Tom bears
his revolver, aimed at Hancock. Hancock enters the safe.
TOM
Stay away.
Hancock does not respond.
TOM (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
I'm not going back.
Hancock turns, grabs the safe door. Slams it shut with a
resounding THUD. They're locked in.
TOM (CONT'D)
(HYSTERICAL)
What're you doing?
Hancock does not respond.
TOM (CONT'D)
What's going on, here?
Hancock no response. Tom raises his gun, and meaning it.
TOM (CONT'D)
Answer me! Say something!
(FIRES)
Fuck me!
27.
BANG! Tom fires a. shot off Hancock's forehead. The BULLET
ricochets about the steel interior, under great velocity.
It rips Tom's right EAR from his head.
HANCOCK
(catching the renegade slug)
Why'd you go and do that for?
Tom retrieves his ear from the ground. Tries to put it back,
clutching his head. He bleeds.
TOM
Fuck... My shirt.
HANCOCK

Why don't we call it the day.
TOM
(gun raised)
Don't. I told you... I'm not going back.
HANCOCK

If you're going to tease, cock the damn
gun. Otherwise, spare me the wounded
animal act of desperation. I don't got c,
time for rhetoric and sympathy so. don't

you won't be hurt" bullshit. You walk out
of here with me and your life is a

be abused... whatever turns them on.
Either way, your days are shit! Those are
the realities, spelled out.
TOM
What's eating you, man?
HANCOCK

You got half the precinct out there,
armed, trained to blow the tail off a
sperm from a hundred yards... you're
standing in here, cornered, three bullets
left in that squirter of yours, if you're

And as he utters this, he approaches Tom.
TOM

Fuck you.
Close on his trigger finger. It tightens...
HANCOCK
NO!
On the bank floor, where a group of cops now huddle, we hear
THREE SHOTS - from the safe.
We're in the hallway. Where Horus kneels. He's bent listening
into Aaron's bedroom, in his security clothes. By the TV and in
her apron, Mary watches the news...

Mary does not hear him... until the door SHUTS behind her. She
turns to face an empty room.
MARY
Coffee's by the... door.
(GUILTY)
Horus?
A room, a place we don't know. It's dark save the street light
outside. A rhythmic POUNDING reverberates through this darkness.
More intense it becomes.
And then a high-pitch GASP. Two individuals, man and woman,
stumble into view - their silhouettes obscure the window.
They're locked at the hips, pumping away like high-revving
pistons.
For a second, light dances off the woman's aroused face: it's
Veronica.
VERONICA
(a her voice trembles)
Oh god.
The man surfaces from her cleavage for air, his face wet with
sweat and saliva. He brushes his cape away from his arm.
Veronica uncoils yet another orgasm, her back arched, her
breasts beckoning at ceiling.
Quite abruptly, he lets her go. Rights his pants. Unlatches the
window. She paws after him.
34.
VERONICA (CONT'D)
What'd I do?
HANCOCK
(DEJECTED)
'Nothing. I'm sorry.
And with that, he floats out into the night.
VERONICA

Hancock.
In the closing hours of business, employees pell-mell about in
preparation for departure.
A group of LADIES form around a display T.V., taking in with
frothy wetness every inch of Hancock's footage. They gasp
amongst themselves.
Horus enters the picture, jacket and thermos. He notices the TV -
it's like he can't escape the good news.
The TV set.
More news on the day's activities. Mary sits mesmerized on the
sofa, holding a dish she had planned to dry.
Aaron surfaces from the hallway, lured out by the TV He comes up
behind Mary - his black eyes on the news.
MARY
(SURPRISED)
You're still up.
AARON
Can't sleep.
He rolls over the sofa, next to his mother.
They watch VIDEO clips of the foiled bank heist: the crashing
Chevy, the aerial maneuvers, the sheer invincibility of this
man.
37.
AARON (CONT' D)
(IMPRESSED)
That's him?
MARY
There's something about him... I don't
know.
A female REPORTER concludes the footage...

Speculation abounds - government super-

extraterrestrial renegade? Who are you?
Where are you now, superguy? Call me.

We'll get together. Have a drink.
HADES - a smoky bar in the armpit of town.
NEON beer signs. POOL tables. CIGARETTE machines. This is home
to mean people, tough guys - children of a fucked-up god.
We cut through the nicotine air to find the bar. A figure
hunches on the far end, smoking. Popping vodka like mountain
water in Dixie cups.
It's Hancock and his trenchcoat. The long day wears heavy on his
face - those perpetually red eyes, the horror they've seen.
HANCOCK
(MUTTERING)
What he's got to do... a man's got to do
it.
Aaron's room, his nightlight the only source of light. Mary sits

Mary as her voice carries...
Horus, in his bed - smothered in slumber.
He begins to stir, wrestling some unseen dream. He wakes, in
defeat.
Close on a TV set, featuring a COMMERCIAL - in mid-hype. A

His name tag reads - DR. HOLE.

hemorrhoidal tissues, the TV channel changes. A NEWS program, in
progress.
46.
On the living room sofa squats. Hancock, remote in hand.
REPORTER (O.S.)
. more.on the neighborhood robberies in
our next hour.
(BEAT)
World news, today. Hundreds are believed
dead when an explosion ripped through a
crowded market place in...
Hancock staring into footages of bedlam, bloodshed. From the TV
set, maternal CRIES spew forth grief and anguish.
Hancock grabs the remote. Fumbles around for the power button.
He pumps the volume instead - the WAILS intensify his state of
panic, pain.
CLICK. Mary - by the tube, switches off the mayhem. She studies
his reaction, now marked with relief.
MARY
(SAVIOR)
Are you OK?
HANCOCK
I'm sorry.
MARY
(NERVOUS)
I came in to... hope you like chicken.
Hancock nods, watching Mary as she retreats into the kitchen. He
continues to stare - at Mrs. Longfellow, in frenetics, prepping
for dinner.
She catches him looking... looking surreal, this superman, there
on her sofa.
A calm, while they stare. And then...
AARON (O:S.)
Table's done.
Mary turns to Aaron, offscreen.
MARY
Glasses.
AARON (O.S.)
Geez.
Horus enters from the hallway, disheveled from sleep. He does
not see the superman on his sofa. He continues into the kitchen.
47.
Mary stares at him. Aaron appears, also staring at him. Horus
does a "what?" with his shoulders. Mother and son gesture behind
him.
He turns and beholds: Hancock,' rising in full garb, arm
extended. All eyes on Horus - befuddled.
MARY
You know Hancock?
AARON
He comes for dinner.
Close on Hancock. Close on Horus.
HANCOCK
Man of the house?
Dinner is served. All the key players, present. Horus sits
facing his son - dethroned by the distinguished visitor. Mary
serves.
MARY
(to Hancock)
Which piece would you like?
HANCOCK
Breasts, please.
Horus, watching everything - Mary and her every blush.
AARON
You want milk?
HANCOCK
No. It gives me gas. Thank you.
A beat - as everyone visualizes a superFART.
AARON
It makes mom fart, too.
Mary CHOKES on her food.
Drops her fork. She maneuvers, in the allotted space, for the
utensil - and finding difficulty.
Hancock grabs the table, one arm. Lifts it off the carpet and
above everyone's head. Mary, startled, impressed, all of the
above. She picks up the fork.
48.
Horus - a chicken leg dangling from his lips, in mid-chew,.
looking impotent.
AARON (CONT'D)
Good arm.
Later.
HANCOCK
not about the labor... or the love of
it.
(beat; we've heard this before)
.It's about responsibility... with what is
empowered in you. The gift of might.
Might to.do what? Exploitation, because
you can? Or a different path. To purvey
justice. To correct the ills of man...
because I can.
Faces of profound confusion - Mary and Aaron. But they are
charmed, his words secondary to his charisma.
Horus, the quiet observer, observes.
HANCOCK (CONY' D)
(CONTINUING)
so, a job? Yes. And no. It's about...
essence. The essence of the man... not
his clothes. It's the job. Take away the
arm,. the leg..., his bodily possessions
but not his trade, his profession. That
case, you strip him of what he is... a
man.
Horus a firm grasp of the concept.
HANCOCK (CONY' D)
What line of work are you in, Mr.
Longfellow?
HORUS
(clearing throat)
Oh, it's not like you... what you do or
anything. A department store over on
Third.
MARY
Horus is in the securities business.
HORUS
I'm a security guard. I'm just...
49.
Aaron rises from the table. Goes over to the fridge.
MARY
It's a large department store, over a
couple million in merchandise... stereos,
jewelry. On three floors.
HORUS
It's a night job. I sit around.
HANCOCK
You're a security guard. You keep the
state of things. It's a job. You do it.
(PAUSE)
We're in the same business.
Aaron returns with the ketchup bottle.
A frozen moment while Horus ponders the implications. He stares
at the BOTTLE.
HANCOCK (CONT'D)
Aaron, could you show me the restroom?
Aaron points first door in the hall.
AARON
On the right.
He leaves to find bladder relief - leaving Horus to his family.
AARON (CONT' D)
What do you think, mom?
MARY
(in a whisper)
Horus, what do I do?
HORUS
(at his watch)
I need to get ready.
AARON
mom?
MARY
(to Horus)
What do I do with him... when you're
gone? I have to entertain this super...
She doesn't finish her... A NOISE interrupts her - seizes the
participants.
50.
It comes from the bathroom - the sound of PISS, urine versus the
surface tension.of water.
LOUD. WET. A turgid firehose at full blast. The force of
urination grips the room - as powerful as the penile mechanism
from which it is generated.
The toilet FLUSHES. Hancock returns to a'room of astonished
faces - mouths agape.
Later,. by a few minutes.
HANCOCK
(lost; sombre)
and you could see the flames, through
the storm... I get there, the vessel's
all over, spread across three miles of
South Pacific. Bodies floating in the
water, shoes, kids who'd thought it some
routine reconnaissance joyride. Turns
out, the only one alive was the captain,
up against a buoy... crying 'cause he
didn't go down with his men... and he's
got to live with it.
(BEAT)
Sprayed his brain all over the dashboard
in a parking lot a couple months after. A
good man...
(at Aaron)
. did what he had to do.
A brief moment while the graphics sink in. No one talks. Aaron's
smitten. Mary, a mixture of repulsion and fascination.
In the kitchen, in the sink, stacks of plates indicate that
dinner is through.
Company has moved into the living room, with the exception of
Horus. Aaron kneels besides Hancock. Mary, across from him.
AARON
(making a fist)
I wanted to kill him.
MARY
Aaron.
51.
AARON
I want to deck him, just once. So bad I
tense up... like I can't even move.
MARY
(to Hancock)
He comes home crying.
AARON
Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off.
HANCOCK
(REACTS)
No... there's no shame in it. The crying.
It's relief...
(to Mary)
we're older and we don't remember
when... we go, "God, when was the last
time?" Maybe it's me. It's more an
effort, now. Takes more pain... more
blood. Like it's, do you have the time
anymore? Even to look back and recall a
moving experience. To be moved.
(AARON)
By rage. Hurt.
(MARY)
By love.
(BEAT)
But if you have to remember the last time
something touched you... you've missed it
- you've forgotten how to cry.
Horus enters the room, Mr. Security Guard. He observes this
magic Hancock works over his wife and kid - a talent whose
nature he has yet to comprehend.
Horus opts to not disturb their trance. He makes for the door.
Hancock - holds him accountable.
HANCOCK (CONT'D)
(AWARE)
Mr. Longfellow. I'll be leaving, too.
HORUS
Oh, I... you don't have to leave. I don't
want to interfere. I have work.
MARY
(the original sin)
Oh, I forgot to make coffee.
She rushes into the kitchen. Horus stops her.
52.
HORUS
It's all right, Mary. I'm late.
MARY
No, I'll make it right now.
HORUS
I don't have time. I'll grab some on the
way. Thanks.
Mary accepts it - not entirely guilt-free.
HORUS (CONT' D)
(CONTINUING)
I don't want to interrupt. Please don't
let me stop you.
HANCOCK
No, I need to go.
(at' Mary and only Mary)
The last time I had a meal... an evening
like this, I was... it was too long ago.
I appreciate your kindness.
MARY
(AWKWARD)
Please... you're welcome, here. Anytime.
Horus watches everything - watching her chest heave under
Hancock's every word, watching his wife slip away.
HANCOCK
Aaron. Tomorrow. After the bell. I'll
drop by after school. See how you're
doing.
AARON
(SMILES)
Yeah.
Horus watches this - his son slipping away.
The two men leave, Hancock ushering Horus out first.
Mary closes the door behind them. Leans against the door and
EXHALES - a sign of relief, of despair, or, of a heart raging
wild.
We just .don't know.
53.
The white fluorescent of the neighborhood donut shop. Donuts.
Coffee. Yellow formica. Etc..
A frazzled Korean woman, SOON-YI (60) watches over HOLLY (19),
the trainee behind the cash register.
Officer Rutger and Adams sip Joe in the corner booth.
ADAMS
(MID-CONFESSION)
bleeding heart dyke, I know not what.
Fuck martyrdom. Bottom line, Sheila won't
put out...
RUTGER
No.
ADAMS
. won't blow me...
RUTGER
Shit stinks.
54.
ADAMS
says I'm keeping poontang on the
side.
RUTGER
D'fuck she know? Shit smears, man.
ADAMS
Games. I don't need it.
RUTGER
Fuck games, fuck dames.
ADAMS
I got a'wife, I don't need the
aggravation...
RUTGER
Take a donut hole.
The entrance. Horus wanders in, lost in this environment. He
finds the front counter. The cops watch him.
HORUS
A cup of coffee, please.
Holly takes the order. Leaves to fetch it.
ADAMS (O.S.)
Longfellow.
HORUS
(turns; with dread)
How are you, John?
(RUTGER)
Frank?
ADAMS
(god, I'm funny)
Observe anything worth recording, lately?
HORUS
You know... things are slow.
RUTGER
Not for Samsone Electronics on fifth. Got
hit on Thursday.
ADAMS
The guard, he was cut-up like a piece of
meat.
55.
RUTGER
Anything go wrong, you make sure you
notify us, the authorities. No heroics
without a license. You know the
procedure.
Horus - he knows the procedure.
ADAMS
Of course he does.
RUTGER
Of course.
Holly returns with the coffee. Hands it to Horus - free of
charge. From the back, Soon-yi intervenes...
SOON-YI
He no have gun. Not copper.
HOLLY
Oh, I thought...
SOON-YI
He regular guy. Sixty-five cents for
regular.guy.
Horus - somebody shoot him.
Mary's folding clothes by the dresser, busy with thought. Aaron
squats on the bed, his brain going a mile a minute. He plops
back against the bed. Brings his hand up to his face. Makes a
fist. Thinking. Wondering.
MARY
What're you doing?
She's taken by this scene.
AARON
(releases fist)
Thinking.
Mary goes over to the bed. Sits.
MARY
About him?
AARON
No. Not really. Are you?
56.
MARY
No.
They're lying through their collective teeth.
AARON
Me neither. I was thinking.., about
tomorrow.
MARY
Go to sleep. You know what dad says.
Tomorrow always feels better...
AARON
I know, mom... after a good night sleep.
He says that but he's the one working
every night. Does that mean he never
feels better? He's always feeling
terrible?
MARY
(AMUSED)
Go to bed, anyway.
She tucks him-in.. Turns off the lamp. And as she's out the
door...
AARON
Mom?
She turns.
AARON (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
Who is Mr. Penis?
CUT TO:
Looking down aisles of merchandise - not a trace of life and not
unlike a cemetery.
All is dead, with the exception of FOOTSTEPS - shoes pacing
linoleum. It's Horus, on duty. His flashlight leads the way...
57.
Outside, the SIRENS of police vehicles charge by - real men en
route to real work.
Horus watches them from the window - like a kid who can't come
out to play.
He turns to look across the floor - Roheim, against a chair,
watching the NEWS on a big-screen TV
NEWS
(re: Hancock)
.the trains seemed imminently bound for
a catastrophic collision when this...
this superguy...
ROHEIM
(IMPRESSED)
Man. I bet he gets laid.
Horus - he looks terrible.
Hancock bolts from his bed - horrified, eyes cracked with red
veins. He is soaked.
The orgasmic SCREAMS of a prostitute seeps through from the
adjacent motel room -.the wall behind Hancock's bed trembles to
the rhythm of each pelvic thrust...
He clasps.-his ears - tormented.
CUT TO:
Roheim in his usual state of sleep. His lips mutter dialogue
from an unseen dream.
ROHEIM
Olga...
He snaps out of it...
ROHEIM (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
.bitch.
Consciousness slowly sinks in. He checks his watch, then the
area around him. He spots Horus - slumped in a chair, in a
thinking posture.
Horns seems lost in his own blank stare.
HORUS
(without looking)
Another dream?'
ROHEIM
I was talking again, huh?
59.
No response.
Horus sleeps. Mary enters from the hallway, hush-hush. She moves
to the closet. Changes out of her clothes.
Not a stir from Horus - exercising stealth in his efforts to
watch her, watching her sweater fall to the carpet.
Mary stands before the closet mirror. Does a profile check. She
reaches for her bra... and from the mirror, catches Horus
staring,.
MARY
You're still up?
She moves behind the bathroom door. Self-conscious.
HORUS
Just get in?
Mary steps out of the bathroom, buttoning up her domestic
attire. She nods affirmatively.
MARY
Nick's market. Are you sick?
HORUS
I can't sleep.
She goes to the bed. Palms his forehead with her right. Palms
her own with the left, as reference.
Horus tilts his head away from her hand.
71.
HORUS (CONT'D)
Please, Mary.
MARY
You want some milk? I'll heat it up for
you, how about that?
HORUS
No thank you.
(BEAT)
Aaron, today? This Hancock 's picking up
MARY
Yes, he is.
He sits there in bed, struggling with the words. Mary continues
dressing - oblivious.
HORUS
He'll take him home?
MARY
Yes.
HORUS
What do we know about this man? The
papers... they don't have all the facts
about him.
MARY
What facts? He's not a hero.
HORUS
Yes. A hero. I know that...
MARY
Aaron likes him.
HORUS
(TIMID)
I know that maybe, I've been
neglectful... that I haven't been
there...
Mary does not hear him. She's at the mirror, fixing her hair.
HORUS (CONT' D)
(SERIOUSLY)
I'm trying... you have to know... I'd
like to be more... involved. Like it used
to be. Before we moved here.
(MORE)
72.
HORUS (CONT' D)
(notices Mary, applying
LIPSTICK)
Are you going somewhere?
MARY
No. I have to start on dinner. So how
about that glass of milk?
Horus - shakes his head, annoyed.
MARY (CONT' D)
All right. Try to get some sleep.
With that, she's out the door.
Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror at his
wretched face.
He spots a brown paper BAG on the chair. Goes to inspect. Inside
- Hancock's tattered trenchcoat. Oy, what does it mean?
Horus returns to bed, distraught. He buries himself under the
cover.
The dinner table. Post meal. Mid-digestion. Aaron is running off
at the mouth.
AARON
.o his mouth was. open and he just stared
up at me, it hurt that bad.
And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair -
a mother grooming her child. Meanwhile, Horus listens concerned.
AARON (CONTD.)
(CONTINUING)
I said, "don't mess with me." Just like
that.
(MORE)
73.
AARON (CONT'D)
"Don't mess with me." Mom, remember that
guy in the cop movie... he said that?
MARY
All right, already. How's your mouth?
AARON
It doesn't hurt, I told you.
(CONTINUING)
He saw everything from the roof. Said I
did what I had to do.
HORUS
(FINALLY)
Aaron, tomorrow...
AARON
(to Mary; oblivious)
He said tomorrow, he'd pi ck me up
again...
HORUS
I thought maybe you'd like it -- if I
pick you.
AARON
God, my friends will freak.
Horus freezes - fades back to his meal, unheard.
0
Through the dim of light - Horus, alone, prepares for work.
A framed PHOTOGRAPH of a distinguished MAN (50's) sits on the
shelf inside the closet - he poses in full police regalia, stern
and proud.
Horus pauses to acknowledge the photograph. He closes the closet
door.
On the kitchen floor and under the light - Mary and Aaron,
mother giving son a HAIRCUT.
MARY
Hold still.
AARON
I like it long.
MARY
Shut up.
74.
Horus walks into the living room,. in the dark. He looks at his
wife, then at his son - doing their own thing. They don't
realize he's there.
Horus leaves, the door'CLICKS shut behind him.
MARY (CONT'D)
Horus?
AARON
it's almost eight. Dad's late.
MARY
Horus?
She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the
bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front door. Opens it into
the stairway outside.
There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way
up. Mary sees him... and they look at each other.
In the kitchen and under the light, Mary. Hancock. Aaron. Mary
is finishing up on Aaron, applying the last SNIP.
AARON
like this?
(holds up hand)
How do you make a fist?
MARY
(grabs his head)
Aaron, hold it.
Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes.
So there it is, the fist - this petrified mass of knuckles and
bones. It SNARLS at Aaron.
Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't
let go of them.
Aaron swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in
him.
MARY (CONT'D)
Hancock?
The sound of her voice takes him. He snaps out of it.
15.
MARY (CONY' D)
(CONTINUING
) turn. Hancock, it's yo ur
HANCOCK
What?
MARY
Your hair. Come on, have a seat.
AARON
Mom's going butcher your hair.
MARY
Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n
homework.
AARON
Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her,
Hancock.
Hancock shrugs a "what can I do."
AARON (CONT' D)
Yeah, right. I know. I got to do what I
got to do.
The Big Haircut. Mary and Hancock - up close. Mary runs her
fingers through his hair, testing his length. She leans into
him. SNIP, goes her scissor.
Hancock - in his seat, as hard as marble. He seems a bit lost in
her presence. Baffled.
From his position, the view consists of Mary - blossoming in her
sweater.
And that's it. Not a word during this process - just the SOUND
of their breaths.
Hancock.
Erected before us, the immediate product of a mediocre haircut -
he looks plain and un-super. He looks... goofy.
MARY
There... my hero.
He inspects himself via a hand MIRROR. Smiles. Politely.
76.
MARY (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
How do you like it?
HANCOCK
Nice. Thank you.
Mary - peripatetic, putting away things...
MARY
I started out just trimming for Horus.
Here and there. He had to look just right
for the academy, says his father, a
police captain there... in Philly. When
we moved here, I pretty much took over as
the resident barber. You know, to save
some money.
HANCOCK
He was in the-police academy?
A pause.
MARY
His father's idea. Not his. He went
through it anyway, like he had something
to prove... the validation of his
manhood.
(BEAT)
It tpok everything out of him. He didn't
talk for days after he was cut. He took
it real hard. I mean, still, he's not...
I mean,, he's still...
(edits herself)
.it was a difficult time for hi.. Me. I
understand that I'm not intolerant of it,
the working-through process. It's just
that, sometimes...
(at Hancock)
sometimes, I need his strength. I
miss. the strength.
HANCOCK
Is that what you want?
MARY
Want?
HANCOCK
What you need?
MARY
The hair... I need to...
77.
She kneels to sweep up hair. Hancock follows her down.
HANCOCK
Mary?
MARY
Yes?
HANCOCK
(BEAT)
You ever been down the boardwalk, at
night?
MARY
Why... what for?
They're eye to eye. Close.
AARON (O.S.)
Mom?
Mary bursts from her perch - regroups, awkwardly. Aaron stands
in the hallway, his hair still wet from the shower.
MARY
Yes.
Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah!
AARON
my mouth. It's starting to swell. I
think he loosened a tooth.
Mary - maternal duty calls.
MARY
All right. Go to your room. I'll get the
ice pack.
Aaron exits. Mary exits.
Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for
the front door.
Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him...
MARY (CONT' D)
You're leaving?
HANCOCK
It's getting late.
78.
MARY
I'm sorry.
HANCOCK
I'm going to take a walk.
MARY
Really? On the boardwalk?
HANCOCK
Maybe.
Pause.
AARON (O.S.)
Mom.'
MARY
I'm sorry.
She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he
stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought.
HANCOCK
(FINALLY)
Good night, Mary.
MARY
Good night.
The clock - 9:45 pm.
The store rests in afterhour stillness. Horus paces by the side
door, his ears pressed to the phone receiver - no answer.
He hangs up. Checks his watch. Goes to the front entrance and
peers out at the street - no Roheim.
The bar. The smoke. The scums of humanity. Gina - over there,
marketing her cleavage to anything with a pulse and a penis.
She mingles with a BAR FLY.
Her eyes locate Hancock - entering, finding a seat.
From an adjacent stool, A MAN places his hand on Hancock's lap.
Whispers to him.
79.
MAN
I wear dresses. How about you?
HANCOCK
(considers; nah)
Get lost.
The warning comes across quite well - the man exits.
Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the
bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door.
GINA
(to bar fly)
Meet you outside. The El Camino, right?
The bar fly nods. Exits. Gina turns to Hancock. Takes his face
in her hands, studies him.
GINA (CONT'D)
Your eyes are calm. It's good.
She withdraws her hands.
HANCOCK
What?
GINA
But you're still here.
She rises. And as she makes for the exit...
GINA (CONT'D)
Nice haircut.
Hancock watches as the night swallows her whole. He inhales the
rest of his cigarette - pensive.
CUT TO:
The clock, it reads 1:05 am.
Horns, his flashlight, they're making their rounds. His routine
takes him outside - via an EXIT door.
They find a chair in the back, Horus Positioning Roheim in the
light. The old man isn't drunk - his mouth agape, his face
bruised with wounds from a serious pummeling.
A chunk of lip dangles, bleeds.
HORUS
Jesus.
Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to
nurse' the wounds.
ROHEIM
Figured I can get you by the front... but
you weren't there.
HORUS
(dabbing the torn lip)
Who... what happened?
ROHEIM
They-jumped me. That bastard Scarpo and
his boys. They were waiting on me.
Returns to get more clean towels. And comes back.
HORUS
Why didn't you come through the back...
standing out there in the dark?
ROHEIM
-Couldn't find my keys. Must've dropped
them'in the fight.
(feels his lip)
Shit...
He works himself off the chair. Heads inside the bathroom.
HORUS
What're you doing?
81.
ROHEIM
(into the mirror)
the old man
Look at what they did.. gave
a fat lip to match his big mouth. I'm for
shit.
HORUS
(FRUSTRATION)
Sit down
Could you knock it off, please.
so I can clean the cuts.
He leads the old wretch back to the chair.
ROHEIM
I'm a waste of time...
HORUS
Stop.
ROHEIM
I'm too old for this.
HORUS
You're not old.
ROHEIM
What am I... I'm biologically challenged.
Any way you look, I'm a waste of effort.
(BEAT)
I
Use to be, I blame the job. The job.
think, bullshit job. Not right for a man.
"To observe and record..." I say, what a t's for
the hell is DIo nly
dogs. They got a d o o gs in t g g hisn
reason we're he d re, we don't shit on the
carpet.
Horus looks away. Doesn't want to hear it.
ROHEIM (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
But you know what, Horus. That's all
wrong. It ain't the job. The job don't
make the man. It's me. Not the uniform.
It starts right here... 'cause I can't do
anything right. Fuck up my ABC's.
(a beat; at Horus)
But you. Why do you put up with this
crap? A wife. A kid. There... waiting for
you at home.
Horus - he just doesn't know anymore.
82.
A desk clock points to 2:30 am.
Mary - awake undercover. She twists, turns...
A shadow engulfs the side of her wall, smothering the light in
the room. Mary catches it. Rises above her blanket.
What she sees - outside the window, Hancock hanging there in non-
gravity. He stares directly at her.
HANCOCK
I know you're up, Mary. I know you can
hear me. Please meet me on the boardwalk
tomorrow morning. Nine o'clock. It's
important that I talk to y ou, then.
(GRAVELY)
Please, Mary.
And with that, he's off and away. Mary.- stunned.
CUT TO:
We're in the staircase - where Horus is, supporting Roheim up
the stairs.
ROHEIM
They're going to can me.
HORUS
No one's canning anyone. No one saw us...
watch your step... leave.
ROHEIM
Should be an extra key over the door.
83.
In the kitchen, Mary and Aaron - the morning routine. Something
is off this morning, like someone threw a wrench into the
machinery.
Mary appears a bit frazzled, handing her son toasts. She rushes
back to the stove - her eggs beckoning.
AARON
The toast's burnt.
MARY
What?
Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox.
AARON
We're late... you forgot the corn chips.
Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down... and all
over the place.
MARY
Eat... and we'll go.
(checks her watch)
Where's your father?
She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair.
AARON
You forgot the corn...
(the comb snags)
. ouch!
MARY
I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll
be home before we leave. I'm sorry.
AARON
You having your period, mom?
She responds with a brisk slap to the head... SMACK.
We enter an anal-retentively neat and manicured living room.
Horus ushers Roheim in...
ROHEIM
Shoes.
The two pause. Remove their shoes. Proceed into bedroom.
84.
Horus sets Roheim down on the bed. Tucks him under.
HORUS
You're going to be okay?
ROHEIM
I don't know. You might have solo act
tomorrow night.
HORUS
Get some sleep.
ROHEIM
You're a good man, Horus.
HORUS
(washing over it)
I have to get home, now. I'll call.
Roheim grabs on to his sleeve.
ROHEIM
You know what Olga said before she walked
out on me? Her last words to me. She
turned at the front door. Looked around
the room and she says, "keep it clean."
That's it, can you believe it? Then out
the door.
(BEAT)
But like a.shmuck,.I keep the place
spotless... in case she walks through
that door one day.
(at Horus; with pain)
I don't think she's coming back.
Fist clenched, the morning paper under his arm - Horus. steadies
down the hallway. His eyes target the door at the end of the hall, seeing red.
85.
He gets there, the door. He swallows. Wipes sweat off his hand.
KNOCK. And again, KNOCK.
ow
He fidgets in his spot - courage evaporating with every elapsed
second. Until finally, Horus is a pile of dung.
The door opens.
And Clyde emerges, tall and ugly. He's holding up his pants with
one and the SPORTS PAGE with the other.
Caughtin mid-defecation, he is none too happy.
CLYDE
The box scores are waiting and I got an
inch of meat sticking out of my ass. Make
it snappy.
HORUS
(loosing his voice)
I'd like my sports page, please.
CLYDE
You what?
HORUS
I want you to stop taking my sports page.
CLYDE
All right.
Clyde closes the door. Horus - thunderstruck.
He stutter-steps... KNOCKS...
CLYDE (CONT' D)
(AGITATED)
What's the matter, you deaf? I'll stop
taking your sports page. Now get out of
here and let me...
HORUS
(INTERRUPTS)
I want today's sports page.
CLYDE
You what?
HORUS
That there... my sports page.
86.
CLYDE
What's gotten in to you? All of a sudden?
You don't even like football.
Horus does.not budge.
CLYDE (CONT'D)
(CONTINUING)
You'll get it back... after I take my
dump.
Clyde proceeds to close the door... but Horus interjects, his
foot in the door.
HORUS
No.
CLYDE
What?
HORUS
No. I would like my sports page now.
Please.
CLYDE
After I finish.
HORUS
I'd prefer it now.
CLYDE
What's eating you, Longfella? You crazy?
Without warning, Horus wrests the sports page from Clyde's arm
a kamikaze move, indeed.
CLYDE (CONT'D)
(SHOCKED)
Give that back.
Horns lunges at his hulking opponent, lands a punch into Clyde's
midsection. Harmless - it tickles him, maybe.
CLYDE (CONT'D)
Why'd you go and do that for?
Clyde belts up has pants. Roles up his sleeves.., and the
massacre commences.
He simply tears into Horus... SLOWS to the stomach... RIGHTS
across the face. It ends quickly and without resistance - as if
Horns accepted it as fate.
87.
Clyde 'kneels over. Picks up the sports page. And as if yawning,
returns to his room.
KAW/
CUT TO:
The door swings open to admit Horus - battered, enraged,
disoriented. He confronts an empty apartment.
HORUS
Mary!
A deaf ear. No one's there to console him. He storms out of the
apartment.
The bar is empty at this hour. The chairs are up, the floor
swept. A husky BARTENDER unloads liquor in the back.
Horus enters. Finds a stool.
HORUS
Drink.
The bartender comes out, considers this man's appearance.
HORUS (CONT' D)
(CONTINUING)
Is this a bar... or what? Drink.
(uncomfortable with his own
RUDENESS)
Please.
Aaron. The school hallway. He holds a wooden hall PASS,
indicating that class is in session.
He swings into the BOYS ROOM.
A large restroom - empty. Little Aaron passes up on the urinals.
Selects a private STALL. ZIP - urination begins.
Splash segues into drip. DRIP. Aaron shakes off the last drop...
PLOP.
And that's the cue for the adjacent stalls - arms like tentacles
surface from below, shackling Aaron in his spot. He can't see
but, from behind, the stall door opens...
Guess who?
Perceval - possessed. He grabs the back of Aaron's head.
Introduces it to the yellowed waters below.
SPLASH - the head goes in, submerged. What Aaron sees for the
next several seconds: yellow, the thrashing of.bubbles, the
shine.-of white porcelain at.intimate range.
What he hears: the GASPING of his own breath, GURGLE, and wicked
laughter.
The ambush ends. Perceval. Erlick. Spengler. One of them says...
THEM
(MOCKINGLY)
"Don't mess with me."
They leave - laughing.
THEM (CONT'D)
(in the distant)
Little shit.
Left there and in the stall - Aaron, slumped against the bowl.
On the tile floor. A wet rag of piss.
93.
Mary hurries into the room - flustered, adrenaline coursing
wild.
She runs down the hallway to her bedroom, seeking solace in
Horns. The cold, empty bed says he hasn't been home.
MARY
Horus...
CUT TO:
Mary is on the sofa - wondering where Horus might be. She checks
h er watch.
This empty bar.
With the exception of Horus and the bartender - while he's
drying some mugs, let's call him JOEY (30).
HORUS
(BOOZED)
One.more.
Joey studies him. He takes a mug and begins to fill it...
HORUS (CONT'D)
No... nevermind.
(going to blow)
Where's your bathroom?
JOEY
(not in my place)
Bathroom's closed.
Horus politely stands'- teeters a bit.
HORUS
How much.
JOEY
(SARCASM)
Let's see... that's one beer. Tell you
what. I'll take care of this one.
97.
HORUS
Thank you.
JOEY
The register ain't open yet, anyhow.
Horus doesn't hear him. He's already on the move, making a dash
for the door. But too late - he VOMITS at the front entrance.
JOEY (CONT'D)
Shit.
The front door opens, but slowly. Aaron steps inside.
From the kitchen, Mary spots him in his violated condition. He
sees her reaction, that of shock - and like that, he runs
s obbing into her arms.
CUT TO:
It's dinner - but all is not well. Mary and Aaron and an empty
chair. '
They sit without talking.. They eat without making a sound.
Between them - a ketchup bottle.
The door bursts wide, coughing up Horus. He locates his chair
and plops on it... misses... kisses the carpet.
99.
HORUS
(on the ground; prone)
Son. Go to your room.
Struggles to his knees.
MARY
What happened toyou?
AARON
Dad, are you wasted?
MARY
Where... Aaron, he's not wasted. Go to
your room.
AARON
He is wasted.
Horus rises, under great difficulty. Feels his way to the sofa.
When Mary tries to assist, he waves her away.
HORUS
Aaron. Go to your room.
AARON
But dad...
MARY
(AUTHORITY)
Go!
Aaron obliges, at reluctant pace.
MARY (CONT' D)
What do you think you're doing, Horus
Longfellow?
Horus gauges her.
HORUS
Don't "Horus Longfellow" me, Mary. I'm
not your child. I'm your husband.
MARY
Horus, what're you talking about?
(re: bruises)
Who did this to your face?
Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength.
100.
HORUS
(OBLIVIOUS)
But you didn't know-about me...
Mary knows where this is headed.
HORUS (CONT' D)
(CONTINUING)
You didn't know I was going to do this to
you.
(a half-chuckle)
I guess I should've known. We were
married and I knew... at the reception. I
couldn't dance. so I sat in the back and
watched. You were with Stuart Olmsted and
I watched you dance. In your white dress.
And I remember zoning out... for a
second, just watching you. God, Mary...
the little girl next door who used to get
into fist fights with her brothers in
those patched-up Toughskins. We met only
'cause the tallest tree in the
neighborhood was in my backyard and you
needed to climb it.
(BEAT)
But that night. God, you looked so
beautiful I.had to realize it... how much
I loved you... one more time.
(BEAT)
You and Stuart danced. Laughed. And I
remember I'm watching you there, with
him... together like that. You looked
good with him, I thought all of a sudden.
Like you belong... better. And as I
stared across the floor, it was the same
story with all the guys there, that they
were more right for you.
(SWALLOWS)
More right because that night, you walked
in with the wrong man.
MARY
Why do you say that?
HORUS
Because I let you down.
(BEAT)
I'm a coward. I can't do anything about
it. Look at me, I'm breaking up in front
of you. And God, I fear the day when I'd
have to defend you and Aaron. What do I
do, then? What am I if I can't do that...
my own wife, family? Not a man.

DREAM SEQUENCE - SOMEWHERE
EXPLODES into the rage and fury of an apartment fire.
Casualties come in the form of CRIES, women and children on the v erge of incineration.
Hancock's POV: a burning hallway, flames spewing from every
crevice - we're walking through Hell.
We see a BOY, huddled under a table. Hancock wraps his cape
around him. Bolts through the inferno... as glass SHATTERS...
and gas pipes ERUPT.
He takes the boy to safety. Unwraps the cape... only to see the
CHARRED remains of a human BODY...
the-CRIES, they continue...
The room is dark, of course. A BED - as the SQUEAKING of springs
suddenly stops.
A woman's VOICE says...
VOICE
What's the matter?

VOICE

HANCOCK

I need a cigarette, goddamn it!
He storms from the bed. Heads for the bathroom.
VOICE
I don't smoke. What's wrong with you?
She rises after him and into view - it's no other than the TV
reporter, in the flesh. She bounces over to the bathroom, as the
door SLAMS shut.
REPORTER
What're you doing?

Hancock stares into the mirror - a face in the latter stages of
deterioration.
And in disgust, he swipes EVERYTHING off the sink.
REPORTER (O.S.)

Hancock drops his pants.
Straight-arms the wall with his left. And with his right,
latches on to his magnanimous member.
Outside and beyond the door, the reporter has her ear pressed
against wood - listening.
So there our superhero stands, bent over a bit, yanking up a
storm. His body convulses under said stimulation. He GROWLS...
Cue for the reporter to back away.
REPORTER (CONT'D)
Jesus...
Hancock stiffens, in full throttle. Full. Throttle...
up and into a fevered pitch... and BOOM, we hear a He GROWLS... P
baby explosion. The reporter leaps back.
Beat.
The bathroom door flies open. Hancock emerges, buttoning his
pants. He brushes pass her. Finds the window... and he's off
with a gush of wind.

around the living room.

What're you doing?
Hancock closes in. Corners her.
HANCOCK
It's the haircut, Mary.
(strikes his head)
I'm pissed!
Out of nowhere - Aaron charges the caped psychotic. He
trampolines on Hancock's back, trying to saddle him.
AARON
Don't you fucking touch her!
Mary SCREAMS. Hancock cringes, says...
HANCOCK
Shut your mouth.
He swats the kid off his back.
AARON
Don't touch her you bastard!
HANCOCK
You're getting on my nerves.
MARY
Hancock, please.
He reaches down and untangles Mary from her son - she concedes
out of fear for Aaron.
AARON
No! Mom!
MARY
Stay back, Aaron!
Hancock takes her away - like booty. Aaron dangles from his
cape, trying to save his mother.. In vain.
The superhero springs into the night - with his woman.

Horus takes refuge behind the locker, allows them to pass.
THUG #1
(WHISPERING)
Stop grabbing my ass, man.
Horus slides out the back, into the alley. He crosses the street
to a phone. Jabs in 911.
HORUS
Police?
Scarpo and the thugs are at the front door - looking out at
about... five to ten for armed robbery. They're in hysterics.
They observe as Horus emerges from the building across, trying
to assist the authorities.
Scarpo recognizes this one security guard.
SCARPO
Nutri-cop.

THUG #2
We're off the hook, man.
SCARPO
The store's ours.
THUG #3
What about that security guy?
SCARPO
He ain't coming back?
In unison - their FLASHLIGHTS flick on.
In the wide expanse of this top floor - Hancock and Mary. He
squats before her, calm - unperturbed by the activities outside.
Mary huddles in her spot, occasionally stealing glances outside.
Hancock simply stares at her. At the curves of her gentle frame.
The alcohol's wearing off.
Scarpo. The Thugs. They sack the emporium, unimpeded.
The silhouette figure of Horus - it enters the back room,
bracing the wall for silence. He moves into the store.
From his vantage, several beams of light slice the darkness they
indicate the positions of the thugs.
Horus sneaks in, heads for the second floor.
Thug #3 peruses this department.
Moving across the floor on bent knee - Horus, concocting some
desperate strategy. He moves to the GUN counter. Slips his hand
underneath and withdraws a hidden KEY.
Scarpo - stuffing his bag with merchandise. He waves Thug #2
over.
SCARPO
Take the show upstairs.
The gun counter. Horus loads a .45 - it's foreign to his hand.
He rolls out in search for Thug #3, who is by the BASEBALL
aisle. Horus cocks the .45 in pursuit. Sidles up behind him.
THUG #2 (O. S . )
(from behind)
Behind you!
Thug #3 swings around with a Louisville Slugger - it swipes the
45 from Horus's hand. Horus "I'm screwed."
Thug #3 promptly knocks Horus against the BAT rack. Bats roll,
spray the floor. Thug #3 slips hard on his approach, landing
heavy on his head.
Thug #2 comes running, gun raised.fa rusCdives for r a goes oose bat,
his swing greeting Thug #2 in the
the count.
Horus stands over the two bodies - as surprised as we are.

Scarpo - in full alert. He's heard the commotion upstairs.
SCARPO
Guys?
(no answer)
Fuck me.
He drops his loot. Heads for the second floor, cocking his gun.
Thug #1, he's writhing to music under the privacy of headphones -
unaware of Horus behind him... Thug #1 whirls around with a gun,
catching Horus off guard.
Horus responds with a FLASH he had acquired from the camera
section - the burst of light momentarily blinds the thug.
And a quick SNAP of the bat takes out Thug #1. Horus dispenses
of the camera, his adrenaline raging. He commandeers the free
gun, heads downstairs.
But the TV stops him... it displays the siege at Killybegs
Textiles.
REPORTER

hostage situation. Officials refuse to
comment but we believe Hancock has

He bolts upright, turns to Mary. He seeks a special kind of
healing.
Hancock closes in - corners her.

But there's no denying this superman - he grabs her, running his
hand down her back and between her buttocks.

He drops to a squat, searching for calm.

Maybe... if you knew that, that I know.
And. That I won't expect anything from
you. And... there doesn't have to be a
next move.
Hancock turns on this. Stares at her. He rises from the crouch.
Mary - back to wall, on the defensive.
He approaches. Stands before her.
He reaches back... and removes his CAPE. He covers Mary, gently
shielding her. from the cold.
There is no eye contact.
Bullets EXPLODE against walls... bricks... Mary SCREAMS, ducking
to the floor.
Hancock REACTS, the chaos throbbing inside his head. And like
that something snaps.
He BURSTS out of the building - eyes lit with the Hell inside.
He lands on the wet surface below. ROARS before the police force
- possessed.
HANCOCK
Go away! Go. Away.
The authorities - they pause, startled. They open FIRE. Cops.
S.W.A.T. teams. Their cousins.
Bullets ZIP through the air and with dead accuracy. Hundreds of
shells strike Hancock - the target. They PING off his armor of
superFLESH.
He stares at them all, invincible.
Horus storms into the room... in time to greet a police OFFICER,
trying to pry Aaron from the bathroom sink.
AARON
Let me go you bastard.

OFFICER
Let go, you little asabite.
Aaron spots Horus in the hallway...
AARON
Dad!
He breaks loose - running into his father's arms, crying.
AARON (CONT' D)
I'm sorry dad. I didn't know what to
do...
OFFICER
Mr. Longfellow...
AARON.
He's got mom, dad. He came and took her
away. What do we do, now?
Horus - he hasn't a clue.
On the TV - a graphic depiction of war at Killybegs.

There's not much you can do. We've got
every man out there, already. I suggest
you take your son some place safe. Let us
do our jobs.

in the kitchen.

ROHEIM
What do you mean, you got to get her?

Aaron stares up at his father - "did he just say that?"
AARON
Damn right, dad. We got to get her.
Horus at the screen - oblivious. "What can I do?"
ROHEIM
Brain damage runs in this family or
something?
Aaron senses his father's state of overwhelmness.
AARON
Dad. You ever hear about the fox and the
bloodhounds?
Mary is on the floor, wrapped in cape.
Hancock returns. He's pumped, deranged, and he's lost that
loving feeling.
121.
