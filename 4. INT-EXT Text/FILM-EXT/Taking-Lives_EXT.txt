The middle of nowhere.
Martin flips a coin.
Heads.
DAN
Shit.
Dan hauls the spare from the trunk.
Sets the jack under
the bumper.
A PICKUP TRUCK approaches.
Still a mile away.
Martin watches Dan lean in the trunk for the tire iron.
The pickup gets closer, a big one.
Heavy with bags of
animal feed. Speeding.
Martin looking at Dan's back. Martin shoves Dan hard,
into the highway. In front of:
THE GRILL OF THE PICKUP
WHAM! It plasters Dan. He goes over the hood, SHATTERS
the front WINDSHIELD. Bounces off, spins like a rag doll
into a ditch.
The pickup has lost control, it rolls.
Several times, a
heaving mass of steel.
CRASH! The TRUCK folds itself around a husky tree.
No
survivors, that's clear.
MARTIN
He can't believe what he has just done.
He takes in the
carnage, tugs at his ear.
SUPERIMPOSE:
PRESENT DAY
ESTABLISHING the river-bound city.
Beautiful.
5.
A large Ferry plies the unstoppable waters.
Gliding
toward skyscrapers.
The signs in French. Crowded with PASSENGERS waiting to
board. As more PASSENGERS pour off the just-docked ship.
A WOMAN runs through the crowd. Terror etched in her
face. She knocks aside several PEOPLE. Runs toward a
row of restaurants. Even in her turmoil, she is
patrician, elegant.
Two BEAT COPS eat at an outdoor table.
Laid back.
The
WOMAN approaches them, frantic.
WOMAN
I just saw my dead son get off the
ferry.
The COPS trade looks.
WOMAN
Listen to me; he's been dead
eighteen years. He just walked
right past me.
Deep woods. In the mountains. Near a roaring river.
A
log vacation cabin is being erected by CONSTRUCTION
WORKERS.
A BACK HOE digs a trench. The scoop snags something -- a
wetsuit -- worn by a long dead corpse, twirling slowly,
hanging from the bucket's steel teeth. The BACK HOE
OPERATOR jumps off the huge machine, stares at the
headless body he has just dragged from its grave.
Workers gather and gawk.
WORKER
Someone call the cops.
CUT TO:
GRACE VANDERHOLT lies in the grave where the body was
discovered. It has been excavated by criminologists, the
soil sifted, the grass and brush removed. Grace sits up.
Grace holds out her FBI creds, shielding her eyes from
the bright light.
GRACE
It's okay, I'm supposed to be
here.
CLICK.
The LIGHT goes off.
REVEALING Laval and Reynaud.
INSPECTOR LAVAL
Agent Vanderholt, we requested
your help. I'm Inspector Laval,
this is Inspector Reynaud.
GRACE
Hi. Look, I'm not ready to talk
to you guys yet. I need a little
more time here.
Reynaud and Laval trade looks, walk toward two UNIFORMS
guarding the site.
(CONTINUED)
9.
CONTINUED:
Grace lays back down. Sighs. Concentrates on the
sounds. The RIVER. WIND in the trees. Then: LAUGHTER
(O.S.).
GRACE
Would you mind trading one liners
somewhere else? I need to hear
the natural sounds. I appreciate
it.
The policemen have gathered in a chummy knot.
Laval
gestures for them to walk down the road.
ON GRACE
She steps out of the grave. Sits by it. Writes some
notes. Everything glistens in the moonlight, alive.
Grace takes it in for a beat.
Then:
HOWLING, the lonely song of a distant WOLF.
Grace rises, crosses to the river, to a big gravel bar.
Used as a campsite complete with a large fire pit. Grace
sits by the fire pit.
More HOWLING, CLOSER this time.
Grace looks down river, SEES the glowing eyes of a TIMBER
WOLF staring from a clump of trees. The animal stares a
beat, then runs off. Grace has the chills.
Grace walks quietly toward the trees. Grace just a few
feet away. RUSTLING. She cautiously moves aside a
sapling.
A TIMBER WOLF nestled amidst the trees gnaws on
something; a HUMAN HEAD.
Grace stands there alone, the wolf is long gone. She
stoops, pushes aside brush. She finds a hollow under
some roots. Grace CLICKS on her FLASHLIGHT.
WHAT SHE SEES
A human skull stares up from the hollow.
Picked clean,
weathered.
10.
Laval and Reynaud, and the two UNIFORMS smoke and joke.
A quiet beat as the WIND picks up. Their cars up the
road in the b.g.
SOMETHING MOVES in the woods.
Inspector Reynaud draws
his Glock. SHUSHES the men.
A beat. MOVEMENT. Laval signals for the men to spread
out. Holsters are UNSNAPPED. Reynaud is all eyes and
ears as he picks his way toward the trees.
GRACE emerges from the trees, a laser-aiming dot on her
forehead. She REACTS to Reynaud, raises her hands.
GRACE
Don't shoot, I'm on your team.
Reynaud holsters his gun.
The men relax.
Grace takes
Inspector Laval aside.
GRACE
Call who you have to call.
I
found his head.
Laval REACTS.
NIGHT (4:00 AM)
Cop cars everywhere. Crime scene tape. The Coroner's
van. A couple NEWS CAMERAMEN. Grace crossing with
Laval.
Reynaud places a HANDCUFFED MAN in workout gear in the
back of a cop car.
INSPECTOR LAVAL
That's him.
He says he saw the
killer.
Reynaud SLAPS the cop car, it quickly drives away. Grace
and Laval arrive at a BODY dressed in sweats. A gym bag
nearby. A pair of UNIFORMS stand guard as a CRIMINALIST
processes the body. Thirty-ish, healthy, his generic
looks marred by bulging, bruised eyes. Face bruised.
INSPECTOR LAVAL
Meet Mr. Todd Ford.
Grace squats by the body. CLICKS on her Mag-Lite and
inspects the victim. Bruises on his neck.
GRACE
He's still warm.
(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED:
Grace shines her flashlight along the corpse.
A couple
hairs glow in the strong light beam.
GRACE
Want to get those?
The Criminalist takes a lint roller, collects the hairs.
GRACE
Where is it?
INSPECTOR LAVAL
There.
Under his car.
Grace shines her light under a car. A garrote is there,
made of broomsticks and knotted nylon cord.
GRACE
Holy shit.
Has Le Directeur been
notified?
INSPECTOR LAVAL
I'm letting the poor man sleep a
couple more minutes.
(pointing things
out)
Twenty-four hour gym is there,
next door. He has a membership
card in his wallet. That's his
car. Car keys.
Grace looks around the garage.
Taking it all in.
Getting a feel for the scene.
She carefully examines the victim's car with her
flashlight. The door has been brushed with black print
dust.
GRACE slams an espresso shot as she reads the Globe.
INSERT HEADLINE:
MONTREAL MAN MURDERED OUTSIDE GYM.
27.
Reynaud and Grace crossing through the parking lot.
INSPECTOR REYNAUD
(into radio, subtitled
French)
This is Special Unit Fourteen. I
want a complete name search.
Clark William. Surname is
Edwards.
(CONTINUED)
28.
CONTINUED:
GRACE
Inspector Reynaud. Can we swing
by the crime scene before we head
back?
Reynaud nods:
yes.
They get in his unmarked car.
Tape still up. The 24 Hour gym is closed for the day.
Grace looking around. Laval studies a shrine of candles
on the sidewalk.
Grace sneaks up on him. She gets real close.
Laval
watches the candles burn.
GRACE
Inspector.
Laval startles.
GRACE
C'mere a second, please.
They cross to the victim's car.
GRACE
Borrow your keys? Stand there
like you're going to choke me.
Grace pantomimes unlocking the door, drops the keys and
reaches for her throat.
GRACE
Keys drop straight down, how'd
they end up over there under that
car?
INSPECTOR LAVAL
They were kicked. During the
struggle.
GRACE
(points)
Okay. Kick them as hard as you
can that way.
Laval looks at her, kicks his keys.
GRACE
Not even halfway.
(CONTINUED)
29.
CONTINUED:
Grace crosses to the candles.
Laval follows.
GRACE
I had this case. This young
hundred-pound woman was abducted
from a parking lot. She kicked
off a mirror, broke a window,
dented her door. She struggled.
This guy? Nothing.
INSPECTOR LAVAL
Everything you are saying, you are
saying one thing, do we trust
Costa?
GRACE
Good question.
Do we trust Costa?
An unmarked car pulls up.
Reynaud drives.
INSPECTOR REYNAUD
Get in.
A warm night, people are out. TEENS, COUPLES. Some OLD
MEN argue politics. Grace approaches the gallery, keeping
a low profile as she finds an angle to look inside.
Grace quickly crosses to the entrance.
A back hoe rips a bucket of earth from amidst the graves.
A couple UNIFORMS watch.
An UNMARKED parked with Laval and Grace inside.
They
watch:
Two POLICE CRUISERS SCREECH to a stop outside.
Grace and Laval.
GRACE
How do we know Costa didn't stage
this? For attention or something.
INSPECTOR LAVAL
He's happy to see you. But the
alarm was jumpered. Do you think
Costa knows how to jumper an
alarm?
GRACE
We should take the computer.
Costa who has followed them out, overheard.
COSTA
Don't take the computer.
That's
my brain.
Costa turns to Grace.
COSTA
I'm not making this up.
Believe
me.
Grace shrugs, sees an ATM facing the alley.
GRACE
Should I believe you?
Grace crosses to the ATM.
Peers into its security
camera.
GRACE
Or should I believe this.
COSTA
Believe what you want.
He's cocky, Grace likes that.
Being fast forwarded. COSTA exits his office.
Locks the
door. He walks TOWARD CAMERA and EXITS FRAME.
A MAN'S SILHOUETTE in the alley. Crossing towards the
office door. An ATM CUSTOMER blocks the shot. The ATM
customer moves on.
(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:
Nobody is there.
Then:
MARTIN ASHER exits Costa's office. Closes the door.
APPROACHES CAMERA, nonchalant. His face is clear; the
piercing eyes, the sharp features. Asher EXITS FRAME.
Fast forward some more until Costa ENTERS FRAME and
crosses to his office with a cup of coffee. The VIDEO
STOPS. It REWINDS. FREEZES ON ASHER.
CUT WIDE TO:
Costa bursts from the fire exit, fed up. He rips off the
wire, he struggles out of the body armor. Grace and
Laval watching.
COSTA
I have a life. I can't play
superhero for you. I don't handle
stress very well. I have an art
show to open tomorrow and I don't
know what I'm putting on the walls
yet.
GRACE
I know you have a life. So did
the people who have lost theirs.
Someone else might die if you do
not help us. Every time someone
dies it affects forty, fifty
lives.
Costa looks at her, arms on his hips.
COSTA
Grace, I've been cooperating. I
even drew you a picture. You
can't put your responsibility on
me. You have a badge, not me.
GRACE
If somebody else dies, and you
know you could have done more to
stop it, you're going to feel like
shit for a very long time, Mr.
Costa.
A beat.
That resonates with Costa.
(CONTINUED)
58.
CONTINUED:
COSTA
I want to help you guys but I
don't have time to hang out and
listen to bad techno.
A beat.
GRACE
It's okay to be scared.
COSTA
Scared? I'm off-the-charts
terrified. There's a pissed-off
serial killer after me. I mean,
what did I do to him?
GRACE
You saw him and that's enough.
Don't stop living your life.
You'll be protected by armed
officers twenty-four seven.
COSTA
Until he's caught?
GRACE
(softly)
I can't promise you that.
Costa is torn, Grace empathizes with him.
COSTA
I have a lot of work to do.
GRACE
A car is watching the gallery.
You'll be okay.
Costa looking at Grace.
He decides to trust her.
Posters advertise SUMMERFEST.
CITY WORKERS put up
barricades and porto-potties.
Summerfest, a street festival, is just warming up.
It
could be Mardi Gras, plastic cups and glowsticks.
Chaos. Summerfest is in full swing. A swirling, boiling
CROWD of shiny faces. Asher dives into their midst.
Grace plunges in after him. Inspector Laval follows.
Asher and his pursuers leave a wake of disturbed REVELERS
that Reynaud follows.
Asher running. Careening, rolling, bouncing off PEOPLE.
He has the tireless power of a soccer player.
68.
ON GRACE
Running.
Equally tireless.
Locked onto Asher like a
missile.
Grace is slowly gaining on Asher.
Laval behind her.
Running.
Screaming in his radio.
INSPECTOR LAVAL
(subtitled French)
We're heading East. Form a line
at Seychelles.
A dozen UNIFORMS charge through the crowd.
Police RADIOS busy with CHATTER. UNIFORMS clear a path
for two PATROL CARS. SIRENS WHOOP as they coast in, TAP
bumpers, blocking the intersection.
POLICE OFFICERS form a formidable skirmish line.
SHOUTING for REVELERS to move aside.
Asher running. Gun in his pocket. Elbowing his way
through the crowd. Asher REACTS. He sees the gauntlet
of UNIFORMS and PATROL CARS blocking the intersection
ahead.
Asher shoves his hand in his pocket...
BOOM!
BOOM-BOOM!
POP-POP-POP!
Thunderous GUNFIRE. Grace hits the deck. The Uniforms
hit the deck. The CROWD SCREAMS, CLAPS and WHISTLES.
It's not gunfire...
TILT UP.
FIREWORKS unfold in the night sky like giant flowers of
fire. Rivers of sparks.
Grace recovers her feet with palpable relief, she thought
she was dead for a second. Grace looking around for
Asher. Laval reaches her.
GRACE
Shit.
You see him?
POP-POP-BOOM! More fireworks.
Laval gestures for some
Uniforms to spread out.
(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED:
A SHRILL SCREAM O.S.
From an apartment building. Grace runs into the
building. Laval follows her.
Laval will go no further. Grace gets a running start,
jumps from the apartment window, tucks and rolls. On her
feet again, Grace sprints along the roof.
FIREWORKS BOOM and POP overhead.
THUMPING TECHNO.
Grace reaches the edge of the roof.
REACTS.
Reynaud has
caught up with her.
Asher has vanished into a vast sea of DANCERS, adorned
with strobing and glowing jewelry. The BEAT dominates
all sound.
70.
Grace and Reynaud trade looks, tenacious street cops at
heart, they holster their guns and jump into the crowd.
FIND ASHER --
A dozen yards away. He stalks a dancing RAVER who wears
a huge bundle of glowing necklaces.
Asher snatches necklaces.
Disappears into a wall of
DANCERS.
FIND GRACE --
She and Reynaud scan the moving bodies for Asher. Grace
GLIMPSES the back of Asher's head. Grace and Reynaud
tear through the crowd like bulls, working together, a
bonding moment.
Asher is an arm's length ahead of Grace. She reaches
out, her fingers snag the cloth of his shirt. Asher
turns...
IT'S NOT ASHER.
Grace shoves him aside and moves on. She SEES a
disturbance up ahead. Grace shoulders her way through
the crowd.
Grace and Reynaud converge on the disturbance.
They
cleave through ONLOOKERS to reveal...
A FIGHT
Two drunk COLLEGE JOCKS slug it out. Grace looks around;
no Asher. Angry, frustrated, Grace grabs one of the
Jocks, hurls him to the ground. Six UNIFORMS swarm in
and arrest the two Jocks.
Reynaud throws up his arms in frustration.
He looks at
Grace, they know they've been beaten.
PULL BACK to reveal Grace and Reynaud surrounded by an
ocean of bodies in motion.
CAMERA FINDS A DANCER.
Some dude with his shirt off grinds on three HOTTIES.
PUSH IN ON THE DANCER.
(CONTINUED)
71.
CONTINUED:
It's Asher. His face is an evil green from his mane of
pilfered gel glow necklaces. Red plastic cup in hand,
Asher enjoys the boisterous anonymity.
ASHER'S EYES
Dangerous and cold.
They track Grace as she moves
through the crowd.
Asher grabs one of the hotties, begins making out with
her.
Grace searching the crowd.
Scanning faces.
Grace passes within feet of Asher.
Asher smirks.
Now another hottie wants a kiss.
Asher
complies.
The next morning. Laval pulls up in UNMARKED #1, next to
the patrol car that has been guarding Costa's apartment.
With a wave the UNIFORM behind the wheel drives off.
Laval exits his car. Crosses to Costa's door.
NEW ANGLE
Reynaud and Grace have just pulled to the curb a half
block away.
Laval RINGING the bell.
A white PLUMBER'S VAN pulls up behind Laval's unmarked.
A PLUMBER gets out.
Coveralls, clipboard.
Crosses to
another apartment.
Costa opens the door. With two packed bags.
Laval takes
one. Costa takes one last look at his home.
Locks the
door.
Laval watches the plumber KNOCKING a couple doors down.
Costa and Laval cross to unmarked #1.
The plumber approaches them.
Costa looking at him,
REACTS.
The plumber is MARTIN ASHER. A gun in his hand.
Laval
drops Costa's bag, reaches for his holster...
POP-POP-POP!
Asher drops Laval with three to the face.
(CONTINUED)
77.
CONTINUED:
Costa stares in disbelief at the mortally wounded cop.
Asher shoves Costa into the driver's seat of unmarked #1.
ASHER
You're driving.
SCREECH! Reynaud slides to a stop. Leaps from the
still-moving car and checks his friend Laval. Who is no
more. Grace wants to get Asher.
GRACE
You staying or going?
INSPECTOR REYNAUD
I'm not leaving.
Grace slides behind the wheel.
And takes off in the
muscular cop car.
Costa's unmarked races northward, out of the city.
Grace catching up.
Grace's car spins off the road. Stops in a ditch.
A
beat. The Buick's hulk blocking the road.
Grace exits the unmarked. Dazed but unhurt. She crosses
to the Buick. Three HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS are in the car.
GRACE
Is everyone okay?
They seem alright.
GIRL #1
Yeah.
(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED:
GIRL #2
I think so.
GIRL #3
Omigod, I have to call my mom.
A POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a stop. Then another POLICE
CAR. Grace runs to one of the police cars.
GRACE
They're okay. Let's go.
(points up the road)
He just shot a cop.
Grace jumps in the passenger seat.
The COP looking at
her.
GRACE
Let's go.
Bad guy's that way.
The Cop nods, PUNCHES IT.
Oil smoke and steam pour from the unmarked #1.
Costa is
alive, cut bad. He looks at Asher.
COSTA
Rot in hell, Martin Asher.
Costa undoes his safety belt.
Grabs the door handle.
The door pops open.
Costa pulls himself from the wreck.
Flames spread under
the car.
They race along a mountain road with a view of the St.
Lawrence River below. They can see far up the road, no
sign of the unmarked #1.
Grace looks behind them, reacts.
83.
A COLUMN OF SMOKE rises from behind a ridge.
Costa lays by the road.
Motionless, he may be hurt bad.
UNMARKED #1
is now Martin Asher's funeral pyre. Flames engulf
everything. Even the glass is melting.
BOOM!
A TIRE EXPLODES.
Costa stirs, crawls on his hands and knees, into the road
away from the wreck.
POP-POP-POP!
AMMUNITION in the unmarked EXPLODES from
the heat.
A police car arrives.
SCREECHES to a stop alongside
Costa.
Grace leaps from the passenger side. She grabs Costa,
helps him into the back. POP-POP-POP! More AMMO COOKING
OFF.
GRACE
Let's go!
Crime scene tape. POLICEMEN form a perimeter. The fire
is out. A Fire Truck pumps water for a three-man HOSE
TEAM cooling the hot metal. A plume of steam rises up
the scorched tree trunk.
The car is nothing more than blackened sheet metal.
Asher has been reduced to a charred torso.
Asher gets into Grace's unmarked.
And drives away.
Grace exits the building, watches him go.
Grace has no way to follow.
Then...
She sees a COP talking to a cute NURSE by his patrol car.
GRACE
Police emergency. We need to
pursue him. He's a murder
suspect.
The Cop cocks his head, looks at Grace like she's a
nutcase. Grace dials her cell phone.
GRACE
Director Gillet, there's an
emergency, can you please tell
this officer to cooperate with me?
Grace hands the cell phone to the Cop.
A patrol car stops in front. Grace leaps out and runs
into the building. An Unmarked pulls up. Reynaud jumps
out and enters the building.
97.
SIRENS SCREAMING, flashing lights as six police cars zip
by at 90.
Reynaud's car SLIDES to a stop. Police cars take
position around the block, forming a perimeter around the
house.
Grace and Reynaud exit the car. Grace has a shotgun.
Four UNIFORMS, also with shotguns, join them.
The ad hoc entry team runs up the steps, onto the porch.
GRACE
Get right, I got left.
WHAM!
Reynaud KICKS the door.
Grace is first in.
Asher, his face obscured with a sweatshirt hood, pulls
Todd Ford from the trunk.
GRACE (V.O.)
The Ford murder was staged and I
missed it. Asher drove Ford's car
there with Ford unconscious in the
car. Ether maybe, GHB. Something
that disappears. Asher works out,
heads to the parking lot. Pulls
Ford out of the trunk. And
strangles him. He left a couple
of Hart's hairs on the body.
Asher leans over Todd Ford, strangling the unconscious
man with the garotte.
Asher places a couple of Hart's hairs on the body.
Grace chasing Hart.
SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)
Mr. Hart, not Asher, murdered the
Montreal Inspector, correct?
GRACE (V.O.)
Yes. Hart thought Costa was
systematically destroying his
life. Hart's violent explosion
was inevitable.
SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)
How could Asher plan on Hart
snapping like that?
GRACE (V.O.)
He couldn't. My guess is Asher
intended to kill Hart and make it
look like suicide. The
authorities would find the body
and close the Martin Asher file.
Things are wrapping up.
SENIOR AGENT
This ethics panel has no choice
but to recommend terminating you
for misconduct. Do you wish to
make a statement?
Grace shakes her head: no.
SENIOR AGENT
Please speak up for the record.
Grace leans into her mike.
GRACE
No.
I have nothing to say.
106.
Grace heaves the box into the back of her Audi.
A GSA
police car stands by.
DICK COLTON, her ex-boss intercepts her before she gets
in.
COLTON
Grace. This is a bitter loss to
the unit.
GRACE
You'll manage.
COLTON
Want some good news? RCMP closed
their investigation and the
Minister isn't indicting you.
This could have been a real train
wreck for you, Grace.
GRACE
It wasn't?
Grace gets in her car.
COLTON
No one has any clue where Asher
is. That son of a bitch might
fixate on you. Please watch your
back, Grace.
GRACE
I'll dig a hole and hide in it.
COLTON
Don't fade away, Grace.
You're
still my friend, okay?
Grace pulls out.
Heads for the road that will take her
out of Quantico.
Grace has the top down. The WIND snatching papers from
her box. Grace doesn't care.
107.
Grace exits the clinic reading a test result.
She
freezes in her tracks, returns inside.
Wintertime. It's an ice storm. Freezing rain
accumulates on existing snow and ice. Grace loading her
supplies into her truck. It's miserable out and getting
worse.
HONKING. Grace turns to watch a car slowly sliding
helpless across the ice. It stops just short of hitting
a parked car.
Old and falling apart. Overgrown with branches. The
wind picking up. Grace's truck slowly navigating the
ice. The only vehicle around.
The last remnant of the once-proud Vanderholt holdings.
Grace pulls open a large garage door.
Assaulted by rain and sleet. She slips on the ice.
Regains her feet, finishes opening the door.
She gets back in her truck and parks it inside the garage.
Grace exits the kitchen door, running with her hands
cuffed behind her. Running for her life.
She runs for the nearby woods. Her shoes CRUNCHING
through a layer of fresh ice over old snow. Fighting for
balance.
POP-POP-POP! Asher OPENS FIRE on her from the house.
BULLETS HIT the ice around her.
Grace runs into the woods.
Branches sheathed in ice.
Smacking her face.
Asher exits the house, FIRING -- POP-POP-POP-POP!
BULLETS EXPLODE the ice around Grace. She dives to the
ground. She takes the opportunity to move her handcuffs
from behind to in front.
She unties and removes the heavy prosthetic belly she
wears. Grace is not pregnant. She pulls the knife out.
Grace runs deeper into the woods.
Asher running in the woods behind her. The gun in his
hand at the ready. Asher is hunting. He intends to kill
her.
ASHER
Keep fucking running, Grace,
you're only going to die tired!
ON GRACE
Running. Batting away ice-covered branches.
Drenched
with sleet. Hypothermic conditions.
Grace emerges from the woods. Running along the icy
road. She slips and falls. Cuts her hand on the ice.
Grace stands, and keeps running, her hand bleeding, the
knife getting slippery.
ON ASHER
Gaining on her. Grace slips again, scrabbling on the
ice, trying to keep moving. A slow motion nightmare.
Here comes Asher.
No mercy.
He aims the gun at her
face...
(CONTINUED)
114.
CONTINUED:
Grace raises her hands to protect her face...
POP! Asher FIRES. DING! The BULLET intended for
Grace's forehead hits the knife -- RICOCHETS into the
trees.
A beat.
Grace looking at the now-creased knife.
Asher's gun is out of rounds.
The slide is locked back
on an empty chamber.
SWICK! Grace slices Asher's legs with the knife.
Slices
each shin deeply.
ASHER
Shit!
Asher kicks the knife from her hand. Then kicks her in
the face. He tries to kick her again but she grabs his
leg.
WHAM! Asher slips, hits the ice hard. Grace is on top
of him, wraps the handcuffs around his neck. Wraps her
legs around his body.
Grace chokes Asher for all he's worth. His eyes bulge,
his face reddens as he meets the same fate as his
victims. Asher has a seizure as his oxygen depleted
brain dies.
Grace doesn't let go. A long death embrace. Finally,
when she is sure, Grace releases from Martin Asher's
body.
She checks his pulse.
He's dead.
Grace stands.
The rain falling on her. Ice and moonlight. Grace spits
blood, looks around. Looks at Asher's corpse.
GRACE
Better you than me, asshole.
Walks back toward the house.
Alone.
Strong.
Whole.
FADE OUT.
