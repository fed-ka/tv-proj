          FADE IN:

  11P.O.V. - A CLOUDLESS BLUE SKY

          A rectangle of azure so intense it seems to faintly buzz. 
          Then the source of the buzzing zooms into view:


            A HUMMINGBIRD

          It hovers for a beat at a pollen-laden WILDFLOWER before
          darting away.

                                        JOHNNY (O.S.)
                          "Archilochus colubris."


          EXT. BUCOLIC LAKESIDE - DAY

            REVEALING JOHNNY lying on his back chewing a grass stem
          and enjoying the complete reprieve from worry that only a
          day this perfect can bring.  BRUCE and J.J. are fishing
          nearby, Bruce helping J.J. rig his line.

                                        BRUCE
                        You say something?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Archilochus colubris.  Otherwise
                        known as the ruby-throated
                          hummingbird.  Did either of you
                        know that of the three hundred
                        and twenty species found worldwide,
                        it's the only one that breeds in
                        eastern North America?

                                        BRUCE
                        No kidding.
                                (handing J.J. the rod)
                        Sounds like your biological dad
                        is still teaching biology.

          J.J. acknowledges this with a matter-of-fact shrug.

                                        J.J.
                        He knows a lot.





                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - TEASER - 4/10/04 - PINK           2.


    1CONTINUED:1

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah?  Well, I bet he doesn't
                        know about the large creature
                        rumored to inhabit this lake. 
                          "Aquatus Cleaves Millis," possibly
                        a local version of the Loch Ness
                          monster.  Better hope you don't
                        hook it.

          J.J. just gives him a look.

                                        J.J.
                        Mister Lewis?  You're full of it.

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm wha...?  Did you hear what he
                        just said?

                                        JOHNNY
                        They say truth is the best defense
                        against libel.

          Johnny and J.J. share a smiling biological father-son
          look as Bruce shakes his head, picks up another rod.

                                        BRUCE
                        Okay smart guy, twenty bucks says
                        you can't beat this cast.

          He casts a good distance across the lake.

                                        J.J.
                        Whoa, nice one!

                                        BRUCE
                        All in the wrist, young man.

          Johnny steps up, indicates J.J.'s rod.

                                        JOHNNY
                        May I?
                                (to Bruce)
                        All in the wrist, huh?

          He casts expertly, the line zipping out.


          ANGLE FROM MID-LAKE

          as the lure arcs toward us, passing over Bruce's bobber,
          then landing right in front of us -- with an EXPLOSIVE
          BOOM.  Now our P.O.V. races back along the line to Johnny,
          where ANOTHER EXPLOSION ramps us into --          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - TEASER - 4/14/04 - GOLD           3.


22A VISION: INT. DARK MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          A RED FLASH back-lights the silhouetted forms of TWO MEN
          engaged in a desperate fight, smashing into furniture and
          walls before tumbling to the floor.  This sequence is
          shot hand-held, a chaotic one-er that keeps us from seeing
          either man clearly as they continue to be intermittently
          backlit by COLORED FLASHES accompanied by distant BOOMS.

          Still, one man is clearly the AGGRESSOR, pinning his
          opponent by the neck with one hand while punching him
          repeatedly with the other.  His VICTIM instinctively
          reaches for something to defend himself with, his fingers
          inching past several items that have fallen to the floor --
            including a MOTEL KEY with the number 14 etched on the
          fob, and an open blood-encrusted CLASP KNIFE -- before
          gripping the base of a broken LAMP.  He smashes it into
          Aggressor's head, stunning him, and at the same time
          causing him to roll over on his back, so their positions
          are now reversed.

          Victim thinks it's over when suddenly Aggressor grabs him
          by the throat with both hands, choking him.  Victim tries
          to remove Aggressor's hands, can't, and in self-defense
          starts choking him as well.  And now fear and anger drive
          Victim over an emotional edge.  He lifts Aggressor by the
          neck a few inches off the floor and then slams his head
          back down:  once, twice, then a third time with increasing
          force.  Finally Aggressor's grip weakens; his hands slip
          away from Victim's throat.  But Victim continues choking
          him.  He's crossed a line, lost himself to the violence.

          Finally it's over; Aggressor lays still.  Victim stands,
          takes a few wobbly steps into the bathroom, splashes some
          water on his face, then reaches to turn on --


          A LIGHT SWITCH

          His hand leaves a bloody imprint, then we PAN to the
            MIRROR... and see a bloody haggard face.  Johnny's face. 
          As he stares at himself with fatigue, then dawning horror --


  33RESUME: EXT. LAKESIDE - DAY

          As Johnny reacts to this frightening vision.  Bruce doesn't
          notice, still eyeing Johnny's distant cast.

                                        BRUCE
                        All right, you the man -- today.
                                (checking his wallet)
                        Looks like I'll have to get back
                        to you on that twenty, though. 
                        I'm tapped out.

          J.J., however, has noticed Johnny's tell-tale look.

                                        J.J.
                          Johnny... did you just see
                        something?

                        Rain.  It's gonna rain.

          Bruce and J.J. both eye the cloudless sky.

                                        BRUCE
                        You sure?

                        Yeah.  We better pack it in.

          And as he grimly reels in his line, the bobber racing
          through the water, creating a backward arrow, we...

  44EXT. LAKESIDE - DAY

          Johnny helps J.J. finish packing a tackle box.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Why don't you take that to the
                        car and we'll catch up to you?

                                        J.J.
                        'Kay.

          He runs off as Bruce eyes Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        Rain, huh?  You sure your psychic
                          barometer ain't busted?

          Johnny packs up some more stuff, still very rattled by
          the vision, not even sure he wants to talk about it.

                                        JOHNNY
                        To be honest, I'm not sure of
                          anything right now.

                                        BRUCE
                        What're you talking about?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I did just have a vision, but it
                        wasn't about the weather.
                                (beat)
                        I was fighting with someone.  In
                        a motel room, I think.  It was
                        dark... chaotic.  Couldn't see
                          anything clearly.  But I know I
                        was afraid... and angry... very
                          angry...
                                (beat)
                        ...and I killed a man.

                                        BRUCE
                        Okay.  So you saw yourself killing
                        someone in the future.  In self-
                          defense, right?

          Johnny nods uncertainly, trying to remember.

                                        JOHNNY
                        He was attacking me, but then I
                        hit him with something.  A lamp. 
                        To make him stop.

                        Only he didn't stop, and then I
                        was choking him, and I kept choking

                        Hey, easy.  Whatever this is, it
                        hasn't happened yet, and we both
                        know it doesn't have to.  Now
                        this guy you say you..., did you
                        see his face?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Like I said, I couldn't see
                          anything clearly.

            Something else occurs to Bruce.

                                        BRUCE
                        Any idea what gave you the vision?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (shakes his head)
                        It's like it just hit me out of
                          nowhere.

          Neither man knows what to make of this.

                                        BRUCE
                        Well let's get your smart-ass son
                        home.

          Off Johnny, still troubled, as they head to his car...


  55EXT. BANNERMAN HOUSE - DAY

          SARAH is kissing WALT goodbye as he's about to go to work. 
          Johnny, Bruce and J.J. approach with their gear.

                                        WALT
                        Guys fish the limit already?

                                        SARAH
                        Thought you were going to be gone
                        all afternoon.

                                        J.J.
                        Johnny had a vision.  It's gonna
                        rain.

                                        WALT
                        Rain, huh?


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT ONE - 4/10/04 - PINK          7.

          He squints at the sky, still perfectly blue.

                                        WALT
                        Well, if it does, it's sure gonna
                        put a damper on the Founder's Day
                        bash.  We were expecting a big
                        crowd out at the fairgrounds.

                                        J.J.
                        Mom, I caught a huge bass.  Can
                        we cook it for dinner?

                                        SARAH
                                (ushering him inside)
                        Sure, let's have a look at this
                          monster.

                                        J.J.
                        Bye Johnny.

          Bruce is leaning against the door frame in the b.g.,
            something we shouldn't notice particularly, as J.J. holds
          up his hand to Johnny for a good-bye high-five.  Johnny
          slaps his palm, then rests his hand on the foreground
          side of the door frame, triggering --


  66EXT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT - VISION

          Another kinetic one-er (slightly less confusing than the
          last vision) as we see Johnny, dressed as he was in the
          previous vision (minus the blood), protesting angrily as
          he's muscled out the door by a burly BOUNCER.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I said back off!

                                        BOUNCER
                        And I said not to bother the girls.
                              (a final shove)
                        Now stay out, or we'll definitely
                        have a problem.

          He goes back inside as Johnny seethes.  His clothes are
          disheveled from the tussle but he doesn't bother to
          straighten them.  Instead, he pulls out his cell, speed-
          dials Walt...

          The phone BEEPS.  An INSERT shows us the battery's low.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Damn it! 




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT ONE - 4/14/04 - GOLD         7A.

                                        WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Don't you hate it when they do
                        that?

          Johnny turns to see a dancer (TYLER) with long blond hair

          approaching from a side alley exit, clutching a skimpy
          gown around herself, a cigarette in one hand.

                                        TYLER
                        You're looking for that guy, right?

                                         JOHNNY
                        You saw him? 

          Tyler nods, a little scared by his intensity.

                                        TYLER
                        I was gonna tell you inside, but
                        then Linus got involved.  You
                        don't want to bug him when he's
                        doing his job.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just tell me about the man.

                                        TYLER
                        He was in earlier.  Made a pass
                        at me, you know, tried to get me
                        to go back to his place with him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        His place? 

                                        TYLER
                        I guess he was lonely.  I mean he
                        had some sob story about his wife
                        leaving him and his boss being on
                        his case, yada, yada, but I don't --

                                        JOHNNY
                                  (impatient)
                        Did he say where he lived? 

                                        TYLER
                        Said where he was staying.  Right
                        across the highway.

          And as she points, suddenly, there's a BOOM, followed
          quickly by a couple more.  They both turn to watch
            FIREWORKS blossoming over the distant Fairgrounds (maybe
          we can see the top of a Ferris wheel), illuminating a
          MOTEL across the highway with a distinctive neon SIGN,
          and a smaller one under it flashing "No Vacancy." 

                                        TYLER
                        Wow, don't you love fireworks? 
                        And I'm stuck working a double. 
                                        (MORE)

  6CONTINUED: (3)6

                                        TYLER (CONT'D)
                                (moving off)
                        You're cute.  If you come back,
                        ask for Tyler.  I mostly work
                          afternoons.  Private dances are
                        half off before six.

          She goes back inside, as Johnny stares at the motel,
            fireworks continuing to go off overhead.  He remembers
          something, reaches into his coat pocket, and his expression
          hardens.  He takes something out, looks at it...

          It's a wicked-looking CLASP KNIFE, with an open, blood-
            encrusted blade.  He looks up again at the motel, his
          hand falling to his side, the blade glinting.  As he walks
          across the road, fireworks light up the sky...


  77RESUME:  EXT. BANNERMAN HOUSE - DAY

          Johnny reacts to this new seemingly unprovoked vision.

                                        WALT
                        John?  Now what?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Nothing, I just remembered
                        something.
                                (trying to sound casual)
                        They having fireworks at that
                        thing tonight?

                                        WALT
                        Yeah, which is why I'm hoping
                        you're wrong about the rain.  But
                        then you're never wrong, are you?

          He heads toward his cruiser, his good-natured remark
          rattling Johnny even more.  Bruce and Johnny start back
          to Johnny's car, Bruce taking out his cell --

                                        BRUCE
                        I got a couple of patients today,
                        but I can cancel them.
                                (off Johnny's look)
                        Your vision.  There must be some
                        clues we can follow up, right?

          Johnny eyes his friend uncertainly.

          the motel mirror... being thrown out of the strip club

          the motel... the knife glinting in his hand...


  7B7BRESUME JOHNNY - EXT. BANNERMAN HOUSE - DAY

          As he looks away, trying to hide his unease.  The latest
          vision, the knife in particular, suggests he may've
          instigated the fight that ended with him killing a man. 
          But he's not ready to share these new "clues" just yet,
          even with Bruce.

                        I don't know... Maybe I just need
                        to sort some things out on my
                        own...

                        errands to run anyway so let's

                        Your call.

          For the moment, he tries to shrug off his concerns as
          they climb into --

  1010INT. JOHNNY'S RANGE ROVER - CONTINUOUS

          Johnny starts to pull on his seat belt as Bruce fishes
            something out of his coat pocket.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey, look what I found.

          It's a FOLDED TWENTY; he drops it in Johnny's coat pocket.

                                        BRUCE
                        From my coat pocket to yours.

                        By the way, I could've beat that
                        cast.  Just didn't want you to
                        look bad in front of your boy.

          As Johnny forces a smile and drives off...


  1111EXT. MOTEL - DAY

          Johnny gets out of the Range Rover in front of the motel,
          a no-frills economy establishment.  He looks up at the
          neon sign he saw in his vision -- it now flashes "Vacancy" --
          then notes the strip club across the highway.          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT ONE - 4/14/04 - GOLD         11.


  1212INT. MOTEL - OFFICE - DAY - CLOSE ON A PAPERBACK

          An old RICHARD BACHMAN novel, then a door chime jingles
          and the book is lowered, revealing the face of the motel's
          slacker MANAGER.  He eyes Johnny, who's just entered.

                                        MANAGER
                        Can I help you?

          JOHNNY eyes the RACK OF KEYS behind the Manager's head. 
          The key to Room 14 hangs there with a few others.

                                        JOHNNY
                        No one's checked into Room 14?

          The Manager glances over his shoulder at the key, then
          back at Johnny.

                                        MANAGER
                        Doesn't look like it.

          He watches curiously as Johnny touches the pen tethered
          to the guest register, then the register itself, running
          his fingers down the column of signatures.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know this may sound like an odd
                          request, but I need to take a
                        look in that room.

                                        MANAGER
                        You forget something?

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's more like I'm trying to find
                        something.  It's hard to explain,
                        but it'll just take a minute.

          The Manager plucks the key off the rack, slaps it down.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Thanks.

          But as he takes the key, again failing to have a vision --

          JOHNNY pauses outside the door before inserting the key;
          pauses again before turning it; then enters.


  1414INT. MOTEL - ROOM 14 - DAY

          As Johnny shuts the door, then stands still for a beat,
          taking in the perfectly ordinary room, his mind trying to
            reconcile the innocuous setting with:


  1515MEMORY FLASHES (BLACK-AND-WHITE SEQUENCE)

          Jarring cuts of Johnny and the other man fighting, dimly
          backlit by fireworks flashes, ending with Johnny on his
          back being pummeled.


  1616RESUME

          Johnny reacts to the memories, then sees a table lamp.


  1717MEMORY FLASHES:  MORE JARRING CUTS (B&W)

          Johnny hits the man with the lamp, stunning him; then
          he's stabbed and begins to smash the man repeatedly.


  1818RESUME

          As Johnny tentatively touches the lamp, but doesn't get a
          new vision.  He curses under his breath, frustrated.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Damn it.

          He walks into the bathroom, eyes his reflection in the
            mirror...


  1919MEMORY FLASHES (B&W):  JOHNNY'S BLOODY FACE IN THE MIRROR


  2020RESUME

          Johnny touches the LIGHT SWITCH but again nothing happens;
          his Dead Zone is drawing blanks, even as memories of his
          original vision assail him.  Moving back to the main room,
          he finds himself by a window.  He looks out... and sees
          the strip club.          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT ONE - 4/12/04 - YELLOW       13.


  2121INT. STRIP CLUB - DAY

          The establishment's operating at a decidedly languorous
          daytime pace, a dancer onstage crouching to perform before
          a pair of unemployed men, one of whom almost reluctantly
          parts with a dollar to tuck in her G-string.  A few more
            customers are at the bar, along with Linus, the bouncer,
          who sips coffee as he scans a racing form.  He glances up
          as Johnny enters.

          Johnny looks around, checking out the handful of customers,
            wondering if one could be the man from his vision; he
          notes Linus, the bouncer, then stops a Cocktail Waitress.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Is Tyler working?

          She nods toward a booth, where a dancer with LONG BROWN
          HAIR is trying to engage a morose drunk, her back to us. 
          Johnny's puzzled, remembering her as a blonde.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tyler?

          He's about to touch her elbow when she turns.

                                        TYLER
                        Hi.  I guess we know each other.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Someone told me to look you up. 
                          I thought you were a blond though.

          She swings her hair; we realize her blond look was a wig.

                                        TYLER
                          Brunette by day, blond by night. 
                        And your name is...?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Johnny.

                                        TYLER
                        Well, Johnny, would you like to
                        buy me a drink?

                                        JOHNNY
                          Actually...

          Tyler holds up a finger, shushing him.

                                        TYLER
                        Say no more.  I know what you
                        want.

          She crooks the finger as she turns and starts away,


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT ONE - 4/10/04 - PINK         14.


    21CONTINUED:21

            beckoning Johnny to follow as she smiles back at him. 
          Johnny reluctantly follows, ill at ease in this setting.


          NEW ANGLE - LAP DANCE ALCOVE

          as she leads Johnny into an adjoining alcove open to the
          nearby stage and the more distant front door, then
            indicates a banquette as she picks out a music tape.

                                        TYLER
                        Just make yourself comfortable,
                        Johnny, and then I'll make you
                        more comfortable.

                                        JOHNNY
                                (sitting)
                        Tyler, I really just want to talk --

                                        TYLER
                        Oh, I love to talk.

          She's already gyrating to the music, pulling open the top
          of her gown.  (She'll continue to strip and gyrate closer
          to an uncomfortable Johnny as the scene continues.)

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need to know if a man came in
                        and hit on you, then asked you to
                        go back to his place.

                                        TYLER
                        Every day of my life.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Today?

                                        TYLER
                                  (seductive)
                        Not yet.

          Now she's dancing very close.  Johnny reaches for her
          waist, hoping to get a vision, but she warns him off.

                                        TYLER
                        Uh-uh, tiger, no touching.

          Embarrassed and frustrated, Johnny shoves his hands into
          his coat pockets.  Somehow that triggers --


2222A VISION:  SPLIT REALITY - DAY/NIGHT

          While the lap dance alcove remains in the present, the


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT ONE - 4/10/04 - PINK         15.


    22CONTINUED:22

          rest of the club transforms into a hopping night-time
          scene:  music pumping, dancers mingling on the crowded
          floor, while another Tyler, in her blond wig, is dancing
          on stage, spinning around the pole...

          Johnny reacts to this new seemingly unprompted vision,
          then reacts again as he SEES HIMSELF enter and intently
          scan the crowd, then begin stopping customers, cocktail
          waitresses and dancers and shouting questions we can't
          hear over the din, at times gesturing to his right forearm,
          at other times grabbing them, seemingly trying to force
          visions.

          In the alcove, Johnny cranes to look over Tyler's shoulder
          as she now strips off her top (seen from behind).  The
          music in the alcove clashes with the music in the main
          room, creating a cacophonous collision of vision and
          reality.  Johnny is sweating, uncomfortable; he doesn't
          want to be here but it's as if his visions are demanding
          it.  He watches as --

            Vision-Johnny approaches the stage, now within earshot as
          he shouts to Vision Tyler, who has finished dancing and
          is collecting loose bills.  Meanwhile, Johnny's attracted
          the attention of Linus, who approaches from behind.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Hey!  You seen a white guy, about
                        five eleven, short light-colored
                        hair, with a tattoo on his right
                          forearm? 

          Vision Tyler looks confused; Linus grabs his arm.

                                        BOUNCER
                        That's it for you, buddy.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        I'm looking for someone.

                                        BOUNCER
                        You're bothering the girls.  You're
                        outta here.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        The man I'm looking for, he's
                        dangerous.  Maybe you can help
                        me.

                                        BOUNCER
                        You want my help? 

          And now he grabs Johnny and starts muscling him toward
          the door.


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT ONE - 4/10/04 - PINK         16.

                                        JOHNNY

                                (at the door)
                        I said back off!  

          And the vision ends, exactly where the previous one began.


  2323RESUME:  LAP DANCE ALCOVE - DAY

          Johnny still reacting as Tyler stands, slipping back into
          her gown, as she shuts off the tape player.

                                        TYLER
                        Feeling more relaxed I hope? 
                        That's twenty, by the way.

          Johnny stands, takes out his wallet, still very rattled.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Tyler, have you seen a white guy,
                        about five eleven, with short
                          light-colored hair and a tattoo
                        on his right forearm?

                                        TYLER
                        You are a strange one, aren't
                        you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Have you seen him?

                                        TYLER
                        No, I don't think so.
                                (as Johnny gives her
                                  a twenty)
                        The dance costs twenty, but that
                        doesn't include my tip.

          Johnny checks his wallet; just a few singles.  Then he
            remembers something and reaches into his coat pocket,
          fishes out Bruce's folded twenty.  Tyler takes it.

                                        TYLER
                        Thanks.  I've got to go on stage
                        now, but maybe I'll see you later.

          Another disturbing remark in the context of Johnny's
          visions.  He moves off, glancing around again to see if
          anyone fits the new description.  A man at the bar seems
          a rough match, but as Johnny passes him, we see his sleeves
          are rolled up:  no tattoo.  Meanwhile, Linus approaches.




                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT ONE - 4/10/04 - PINK         17.


    23CONTINUED:23

                                        BOUNCER
                        Sir, there's a two-drink minimum. 
                        Can I have a waitress take your
                        order?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No, that's fine.  I'm leaving.

          Under Linus's watchful eyes, Johnny heads for the front
          door, glancing back at the bouncer as he's about to exit. 
          As a result, he almost bumps into another man who's
            entering:  a frazzled SALESMAN carrying a battered
            BRIEFCASE in his left hand, a sports jacket draped over
          his right shoulder obscuring his other arm.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me.

          Johnny gives the man a quick glance as he exits, but he
          seems innocuous enough.  Camera stays with the man as he
          now turns to look after Johnny, the jacket shifting to
          expose his right forearm.  We see part of a tattoo: 
            something an ex-Marine might have (the words "Semper Fi"
          and maybe some sort of colorful design or symbol, possibly
          an all-seeing eye in a pyramid, like on a dollar bill).

          Then he turns, his anxious (and perhaps indeed hurt and
          lonely) eyes peering into the gloom of the club, fastening
          on the comely figure of Tyler.

          Off the irony:  Johnny has just walked past the man he
          may kill, but remains oblivious...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

                                        END OF ACT ONE          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT TWO - 4/10/04 - PINK         18.

          FADE IN:

  2424INT. SMITH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Starting close on an agitated Johnny as he enters from
          the kitchen with a glass of water --

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm telling you, they're out of
                          control!

            Revealing Bruce seated at one end of the couch, swiveling
          to watch Johnny as he pops a prescription pain pill.

                                        BRUCE
                        They?

                                        JOHNNY
                        My visions.  I have no idea what's
                        triggering them.  It's like they're
                        just happening spontaneously.

                                        BRUCE
                        How is that possible?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  But that's not
                        all.  This morning, I had a vision
                        of myself killing a man.  Later I
                        saw myself being thrown out of
                        this strip club where I went
                        looking for him.  And soon after
                        that, I'm seeing myself walking
                        into that same club.
                                (beat)
                        I'm having these visions of a
                          terrible night ahead of me... but
                        the visions are marching backwards --
                        towards me.

                        What's going to happen when they
                        meet?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't know.  But in these
                          visions, I'm angry, shouting at
                        people, grabbing at them.  I'm
                          carrying a knife, a knife with
                        blood on it.  And then I kill a
                        man, Bruce.  I kill a man.

                                        BRUCE
                        In self defense... right?

                        I had the knife, Bruce.  Maybe he
                        was defending himself from me.

                                        BRUCE
                        You don't know that.  You don't
                        know how that fight starts.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know how it ends, with me
                        strangling a man.  And I don't
                        stop.  I don't stop until he's
                        dead.

                                (beat, at a loss)
                        So when is this supposed to happen?

                          Tonight.  What I don't know is
                        how it starts or why I get a knife
                        and hunt a man down.

          He pauses at the other end of the couch.

                                        JOHNNY
                        That isn't me, Bruce.  It can't
                        be.

          He jabs the top of the couch for emphasis, triggering --

  2626EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT - VISION

          Camera is suddenly SPINNING, everything we see TINGED
          WITH RED.  We catch disorienting glimpses of a crime scene: 
          a patch of concrete bordered by shadowy greenery, ringed
          by police tape.  A sheriff's deputy (ROSCOE) works with
          TWO FORENSIC TECHNICIANS inside the tape; STATE TROOPERS
          keep a crowd at bay outside.

          The location itself could be a park, or maybe part of a
          street or intersection inside a park.  But we can't be
          sure because we only catch glimpses of a few generic
          landmarks:  a lamp post; a tree and bench; the nearby
          opening of a pedestrian underpass, which almost looks
          like the dark mouth of a cave.

          Then the spinning slows, color returning to normal as


                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT TWO - 4/10/04 - PINK         20.


    26CONTINUED:26

          camera pulls back to reveal in f.g. a SPINNING RED BEACON
            magnetically mounted on the roof of an unmarked police
          car, then finds Johnny Smith trying to get past a couple
          of troopers.

                                        TROOPER 1
                        Sir, stay behind the tape! 

                                        JOHNNY
                        Call Sheriff Bannerman, he knows
                        me.

                                        TROOPER 1
                        Sir, stay back or we'll be forced
                        to arrest you.

                                        ROSCOE (O.S.)
                        It's okay!  Let him through. 

          The troopers let Johnny pass, our jittery hand-held camera
          moving with him, sharing his P.O.V. as Roscoe moves to
            intercept him.  Behind Roscoe, Johnny can see a forensics
          tech scraping a sample from a patch of bloodstained cement.

                                        ROSCOE
                        Walt radioed you'd be coming.

          But he sounds more worried than grateful for Johnny's
          help, and he continues to block him from the crime scene.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Just tell me what can I touch. 

                                        ROSCOE
                        John, we're all hurting over this. 
                        I know it must be a terrible loss.

          And now we see it in Johnny's eyes:  he has lost someone. 
          Indeed, his anger is the only thing keeping his grief in
          check.  He repeats, his voice tight: 

                                         JOHNNY
                        Roscoe, either get out of my way
                        or arrest me, but one way or
                        another I'm gonna find out what I
                        need to know. 

            Reluctantly, Roscoe turns to the forensics tech, who
            indicates that he's pretty much done.  Seeing this, Johnny
          pushes past Roscoe and crouches by the bloodstain.  This
          isn't a stranger's blood; it hurts Johnny just to look at
          it.  Still, he forces himself to touches the still-damp
            concrete.  He reacts to a vision, something clearly awful,
          but apparently it doesn't tell him enough.

                        What else?  I need to touch
                          something else.

                                        ROSCOE
                        We found another bloodstain over
                        there.  Could be from the perp.

          He indicates where the other forensics tech is shutting
          his evidence kit by the base of the statue.  Johnny crosses
          to the spot, Roscoe following, speaking awkwardly...

                                        ROSCOE
                        They say surgeons shouldn't operate
                        on their own family, right?

          But Johnny isn't listening, crouching now over this smaller
          bloodstain, extending his fingertips again...

                                        ROSCOE
                        So maybe, you know, you should
                        leave this one to us.

          Johnny makes contact... has a vision...

                                        JOHNNY
                                (aloud to himself)
                        Tossed it... tossed it and ran...

          As he crosses to some bushes, Roscoe following --

                                        ROSCOE
                        Unless what you're looking for...

          CLOSE ON JOHNNY, crouching with his back to Roscoe, who
          can't see what he's doing, as he pulls out a clasp knife
          with a blood-encrusted blade, then reacts to another
          vision.

                                        ROSCOE
                        ...is revenge. 
                                (beat)
                        Johnny?

                                (re: vision, to himself)
                        The strip club... I know you were
                        there but where are you now? 

          He stares at the knife a beat; we sense part of him wants
          to just take it and bolt.  Instead, he controls his anger
          and stands, turning to Roscoe with it.  Roscoe reacts.

          Roscoe nods to one of the forensic techs, who takes it
          with gloved hands, starts to bag it.

                                         JOHNNY
                        Tell Walt to meet me at the
                          Woodbine Hotel.  That's where
                        he'll be.

                        Where who'll be? 
                                (then realizing)
                        Look, just wait a minute while I
                        call this in.

          But Johnny's already rushing off.

                                        ROSCOE
                        Johnny? 

          Roscoe takes a few steps after him, bringing the spinning
          beacon back into the f.g. --

                                        ROSCOE
                        Johnny!

          And as camera again picks up the spinning motion of the
          beacon, we find ourselves back in -- 


    26A26ARESUME - JOHNNY'S LIVING ROOM

                        It just happened again... another
                          vision... only this time I gave
                        Roscoe the knife, I didn't take
                        it with me.

                        I just went into a... bar for a
                        drink.  And when I got back...

                        The car, it was a rental, right?

                        Screw the car!  They took my
                          luggage, my sample cases,
                          everything.

                        I can take the report, but that's
                        about all.  We're pretty swamped
                        with the holiday and convention --

                        No, you don't understand.  This
                        has already been a really, really
                        bad day.  My wife...
                                (he stops himself)
                        Okay, that's not your problem. 
                        But if I don't get those samples
                        back, I can't make any sales.  If
                        I don't make any sales, I'm going
                        to lose my job.  And if I lose my --

                        Sir, I said we're gonna try but
                        the fact is we're very short-
                          staffed.

                                        SALESMAN
                        Then I want to talk to your boss.

                        Afraid he's already got company.

          He indicates Walt, entering with Johnny and Bruce.

                                        SALESMAN
                        Great.  Why do they get special
                        treatment?


          MOVING WITH WALT, JOHNNY AND BRUCE

          as Walt leads them to his office.  Johnny again passes
          the Salesman having no clue it's the same guy he saw
          himself fighting and killing in the motel room.

                                        WALT
                        For Chrissakes, John.  I've got
                        local cops camped outside my house. 
                          Meanwhile Sarah's inside scared
                        to death, and now you're telling
                        me this is all because of some
                        crime that may happen some place
                          sometime tonight?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not just any crime.  A murder.

                                        WALT
                        And you think the victim could be
                        Sarah or J.J.?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Roscoe implied it involved family.

                                  (realizing)
                        Right.  In the future.

          He leads them into his office, shuts the door.


  28A28AINT. WALT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                        WALT
                        Guess you better start at the
                        beginning.

          Johnny and Bruce trade looks.

                                        BRUCE
                        The "beginning."  That's a little
                        tricky, huh?

                                        WALT
                        Why's that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Because my visions haven't shown
                        me that murder.  They began with
                        me killing a man, in revenge.

          Walt's taken aback, but Bruce is still concerned by the
          way Johnny is presenting this.

                                        BRUCE
                        You keep acting like you're a
                          murderer too, but you don't know
                        that.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I know what I saw.

                                        BRUCE
                        Sure.  Just don't assume it's the
                        whole story.

          He puts a reassuring hand on his friend's shoulder.  It's
          the first overt contact we've seen between them, and as
          Johnny turns to Bruce, BRUCE DISAPPEARS.  Johnny's in --


2929A VISION - INT. WALT'S OFFICE/SHERIFF'S STATION - NIGHT

          Johnny turns now at Walt's voice to see Walt now on the
          phone, wearing the same uniform but looking tired and
          drained.  His words have an edge that masks his own pain.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT TWO - 4/13/04 - GREEN        27.

                                        WALT
                        Tell County we're sending them
                        over tonight, and I want them in
                          separate cells, separate wings if
                          possible.  Less chance they have
                        to compare notes the better.

          He hangs up as another Johnny (Vision-Johnny) bursts in.

                                        WALT
                        John... 

            Vision-Johnny gestures angrily to the window that connects
          to the main office.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Are those your suspects? 

          Walt opens the Venetian blinds to reveal TWO WHITE STREET
          PUNKS with SHORT BLEACHED HAIR giving statements on
          opposite sides of the office.  Both have tattooed arms,
          one with the words "White Power" on his forearm.  Observer-
          Johnny moves beside Walt to peer at them too.

                                        WALT
                        Yeah.  We grabbed them up in a
                        biker bar about five blocks away. 

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Well you grabbed up the wrong
                        guys.  They didn't do it.

            Normally, Walt would take him at his word, but Vision-
          Johnny's manic, angry attitude raises doubts.

                                        WALT
                        Well, that's what they said before
                        they clammed up, but I've got
                        reason to believe they did.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        I saw the killer, Walt, remember? 

          Walt picks a police report off his desk, reads --

                                        WALT
                        "Caucasian male; approximately
                        five eleven; short light-colored
                        hair; tattoo on right forearm;
                        age indeterminate."

          Clearly adding up to a less than specific portrait.  Vision-
          Johnny reacts defensively.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT TWO - 4/13/04 - GREEN        28.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        It was dark, it was...
                                  (frustrated)
                        It wasn't like a line-up, okay,
                        but I saw enough. 

                                        WALT
                        Yeah?  Well maybe you should take
                        another look.

          He indicates the window again, through which we can see
          the two punks being stood up, about to be taken to jail. 

                                        WALT
                        Either of those two could match
                        your description, right down to
                        the tattoos.  Plus, we've got
                          witnesses who put them at the
                        scene, they both have records
                        that include assault, and one of
                        them even had blood on his shirt. 
                        We're still waiting on the DNA,
                        but the blood type's a match.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                                (emphatic)
                        It's not them. 

                                        WALT
                        Look, I know what you're going
                          through.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Do you? 

          Walt's stung.  But then again we may be wondering why he
          can be any cooler about this than Vision-Johnny.  It can
          only mean that neither J.J. nor Sarah was the victim.

                                        WALT
                        Yeah, I do.  And bad as this is,
                        I know you're making it worse by
                        blaming yourself. 
                                (beat)
                        John, you did everything you could.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Are you gonna listen to me or
                        not? 

                                        WALT
                        Right now I think you're too close
                        to this to be objective.

                        visions for me?

                        I'm just saying, based on that
                          description, you could be wrong
                        about those two.
                                (as Johnny scoffs)
                        Look, why not go home for a while,
                        try and get some distance?  At
                        least wait until the lab results
                        come back before jumping in.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        If I don't jump in, this guy could
                        get away.  You want to wait around,
                        fine.  I'll get him myself.

          He starts for the door, but Walt grabs his arm. 

                                        WALT
                        You'll "get him"?  I thought that
                        was something else you were trying
                        to avoid.
                                (releasing him)
                        I've already had one hate crime
                          tonight.  Doing something rash
                        isn't going to bring Bruce back.

            Vision-Johnny eyes him a beat, then exits.  And off our
          Johnny's stunned expression...

                                        BRUCE (O.S.)

                        What is it, man?

          Johnny doesn't reply, the pieces starting to fall into
          place as he relives the moments that triggered the earlier
          visions -- and now realizes they all involved indirect
          contact with Bruce.

          Johnny still eyeing Bruce, who's now alarmed.  Walt looks
          puzzled and concerned too.

                        John, did you just have another
                        vision?
                                (when Johnny nods)
                        Do you know who the victim is?

          And as Johnny turns back toward Bruce, fixing him with a
          troubled gaze, and Bruce reacts, we...

  3939INT. WALT'S OFFICE - DAY

          Having learned the awful truth, Bruce is doing the pacing
          now, trying his level best not to lose it.

                                        BRUCE
                        This is... this is... par for the
                        course with you, right?
                                (off their looks)
                        I mean you've seen people die in
                        visions before, and almost every
                        time you were able to save them.
                                (then)
                          "Almost."  I had to say "almost,"
                        didn't I?

                                        WALT
                        The only times Johnny couldn't
                        save someone, it's because they
                        ignored his warnings.

                                        BRUCE
                        And my ears are wide open.  So
                        why are we freaking?

                                        WALT
                        We're not.

                                        BRUCE
                        'Course we're not.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Only here's the problem...

                                        BRUCE
                        Now I'm freaking.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Remember how we say, "change one
                        detail and all of life changes"?

                                        BRUCE
                        Meaning the future, sure.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Only I've already taken any number
                        of actions, changed any number of
                          details, and so far the future
                        hasn't changed.  It's still headed
                        right for us.

                        Meaning my murder.

          Johnny nods reluctantly, turns to Walt --

                                        JOHNNY
                        You thought it was a hate crime,
                        and you'd arrested a couple of
                        young street punks.  But I thought
                        the killer was someone else.

                                        WALT
                        Did you describe him?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not too well.  White, about five
                        eleven, short light-colored hair,
                        and some kind of tattoo on his
                        right arm.

                                        BRUCE
                          A tattoo, great, we're making
                          progress.  In fact, just by talking
                        about this we've probably changed
                        the future.  But aren't you two
                        detectives forgetting something
                          obvious?
                                (off their looks)
                        Me.  You said I was the cause of
                        all these visions.  Well here I
                        am.  You want to fill in the
                        blanks, just touch me again.

          He holds out his arm like a challenge, but we sense he's
          really aching to be reassured.  When Johnny hesitates --

                                        BRUCE
                        Don't worry about me.  I don't
                        think the news can get much worse.

          Johnny grasps his arm, triggering --


4040A VISION:  EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

          A vision that breaks from the established pattern.  Instead
          of taking another measured step back in time, it leaps us
          directly to the moment of the murder itself as we see a
          series of fragmented images of Bruce being stabbed
          repeatedly, all EXTREME CLOSE-UPS that prevent us from
          seeing his assailant.  A FINAL IMAGE shows us Bruce being
          cradled in someone's arms, gurgling up blood as he tries
          to say something.          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT THREE - 4/10/04 - PINK       33.

          As Johnny releases Bruce's arm as he reacts to this psychic
          barrage, putting a hand on the wall to steady himself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It's still happening.

                                        BRUCE
                        You saw it?  You saw me being
                          murdered?

          Johnny nods reluctantly.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You being stabbed... and dying,
                        yes.

          Bruce just shakes his head.

                        Could you see the killer this
                        time?

                                        JOHNNY
                        No.  Just Bruce... and the knife.

                        What about the location?

          Johnny struggles to place the scene.

                                        JOHNNY
                        It was outside.  An intersection...
                        or some public space... but the
                        vision was just too...

                        Then we'll have to make do with
                        what you did see.

          His anger, another natural reaction to this unnerving

          holding onto it for an extra beat as he tries to get a
          vision.  He walks through the crowded waiting area,
          glancing at a WALL CLOCK that shows the time to be 6:15
          (still daytime, again assuming this is late spring).  He
          heads toward the admissions desk where --

          A HEAD NURSE is doing paperwork.  She sees Johnny
            approaching, pausing to touch an empty gurney, and figures
          him for a loon.  Without looking up from her work:

                        I hope so.  This hospital's the

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        Yes.  Now what is it you want?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I need to speak with the attending
                        physician.

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        I'm afraid I can't have you
                          bothering the doctors.  Now unless
                        you have a genuine medical
                          emergency --

            Impatient himself, Johnny grabs her arm, triggering --


4343A VISION:  INT. HOSPITAL E.R. - NIGHT 

          Once again, we're moving with Johnny through the double
          doors, only now CAMERA is HAND-HELD, and though our
          subjective P.O.V. is somewhat less frenetic than the
          earlier one-er visions, it mirrors Johnny's anxiety.  

          He glances at the WALL CLOCK -- it's now 9 P.M. -- as he
          approaches the Head Nurse, who's standing with a clipboard
          and directing traffic in the much busier E.R.  She stops
          two paramedics who are wheeling in a car accident victim:

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        Take her to Curtain Three.
                                (to another nurse)
                        Page Dr. Alonzo and let him know
                        we've got more victims coming in
                        from that highway pile-up.

          They move off as Johnny reaches her.

    43CONTINUED:43

                                        JOHNNY
                        Excuse me... I'm looking for my
                          friend... Bruce Lewis... I think
                        he may've been taken here.

          The Nurse checks her clipboard...

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        Was he in the accident? 

                                        JOHNNY
                          Accident?  No, he was assaulted. 
                        I was with him but we became
                          separated... and when I got back,
                        he'd already been taken away.

          The Nurse finds Bruce's name on her list; her expression
          becomes grave.

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        Yes... I see we did have an assault
                        victim.  Are you a family member? 

                                        JOHNNY
                        No!  I told you I'm his friend. 
                        John Smith.  My name's John Smith. 
                        Now where is he?  Is he in surgery? 

          The Nurse can't stop herself from glancing at a curtained-
          off bed. 

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        Mister Smith, I'm sorry.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You're...? 
                                  (realizing)
                        No...

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        Our trauma team did everything it
                        could --

                                        JOHNNY
                        No!  

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        -- but his wounds were just too...
                        Mister Smith?

          Ignoring her, Johnny crosses to the curtain and jerks it
          open, revealing Bruce's body, all but his face and
            shoulders covered by a blood-stained sheet.

    43CONTINUED: (2)43

                                        HEAD NURSE
                        I know this is difficult, but I'm
                        afraid I have to ask you some
                        questions.  Someone will have to
                        contact his family...

          She goes on talking but her voice fades under as Johnny
          moves to Bruce's side.  Devastated he looks at his friend,
          speaks to himself...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Bruce... Bruce I'm so sorry.  I
                        thought I was doing the right
                        thing.  Goddamn it, who did this
                        to you?  Who did this?  

          He reaches out and grips Bruce's arm, then reacts to a
            wrenching vision, a vision that can only be Bruce's murder. 
          As he squeezes Bruce's arm tighter and tighter...

                                        HEAD NURSE (O.S.)
                        Mister Smith...? 
                                (beat)
                        Sir, you're hurting me. 
                                (then)
                        Let me go! 


  4444RESUME PRESENT - INT. HOSPITAL E.R. - DAY

          Johnny comes out of the vision to find himself squeezing
          the nurse's arm.  He releases her and steps back, still
          reeling from the vision.  Then, as she and other hospital
          workers and patients watch, he rushes out.


  4545INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY

          STARTING CLOSE ON A COMPUTER SCREEN which shows a mug
          shot of a neo-Nazi type with close-cropped blond hair,
          along with a thumbprint and picture of a tattoo.

                                        WALT (O.S.)
                        C'mon John, take another look.

          REVEAL Johnny anxiously glancing at the wall clock, which
          shows the time be a little after seven.  Bruce is sipping
          coffee, looking over Walt's shoulder.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I've looked at all of them, okay? 
                        I don't recognize any of those
                        faces, or the tattoos.

                        We could widen the search region. 
                        The guy could be a transient.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We'd be wasting time.
                                (glancing again at
                                the clock)
                        If this is gonna happen, it's
                        gonna happen soon.

                                        BRUCE
                        How do you know that?

                                        JOHNNY
                        In my last vision at the hospital,
                        it was 9 o'clock, so we're talking
                          sometime in the next two hours.

                                        WALT
                        Only it can't happen, can it,
                        long as Bruce stays here.

          Johnny nods uncertainly, still rattled by his last vision
          of Bruce dead at the hospital.  Roscoe approaches.

                                        ROSCOE
                        Walt.  Got a big pile-up on I-95. 
                          Tractor-trailer jackknifed and
                        about five cars plowed into it.

                        They're already out at the
                          Fairgrounds doing crowd control. 
                        State police are asking for you.

          Walt sighs and grabs his jacket, turns to Johnny and Bruce.

                                        WALT
                        Look, I gotta go deal with this,
                        so just sit tight.  Both of you. 
                        I'll be back as soon as I can.

          He exits.  Bruce turns to Johnny.

                                        BRUCE
                        So what now?

                                        JOHNNY
                        You heard the man.  We wait.

          But as he glances nervously at the wall clock...


  4646INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

          A BIG BIKER in handcuffs struggles as he's muscled to a
          desk by a couple of deputies.  PULL BACK to reveal Johnny
          and Bruce watching as they sit on a bench, on the periphery
          of the busy action of the station.

                                        BRUCE
                        Well, at least we picked a good
                        spot for people watching.

          He catches Johnny glancing up at the clock again.

                                        BRUCE
                        You might try it yourself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Sorry.  Guess I'm a little antsy.

            Suddenly, the biker rears up, having pulled a KNIFE from
          one of his boots.  The deputies grab him amidst ad-libbed
          shouts of "knife!"  "Hold him down!"  Etc.

                                        BRUCE
                        Damn!

          Johnny instinctively grabs Bruce's elbow, prompting --


  46A46AA VISION: EXT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT - QUICK FLASHES

          A MAN'S HAND clenching a heavy object (a piece of pipe,
          but we can't see it clearly) descends in a blow... the
          SALESMAN'S TORSO hits the pavement... a BLOODY CLASP KNIFE
          clatters onto the pavement... a MAN'S HANDS lift the prone
          SALESMAN by the neck and smash him back into the pavement. 
          Though we can see enough of the victim to realize it's
          the Salesman, all we see of the attacker is his hands.

          In the b.g., the knife is wrestled away and Roscoe berates
          the other officers.

                        Well that was exciting.

          Then he notes Johnny's expression, sees his hand letting
          go of his elbow.

                                        BRUCE
                        You just saw something, didn't
                        you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah... someone being assaulted.

                                        BRUCE
                        Me?

                                        JOHNNY
                        I don't think so.  But I saw the
                        same knife.

          It only takes Bruce a moment to see the significance of
          this.  In his mind at least.

                                        BRUCE
                        The same knife but a different
                        victim?  John, your visions just
                        made my point.  We hide out in
                        here, we're just letting someone
                        else get hurt or even killed in
                        my place.

                                        JOHNNY
                        We don't know that.  All my visions
                        have shown me --

                                        BRUCE
                        All they've shown you is that one
                        way or another, we can't avoid
                        Fate, and sitting here isn't
                          helping.  I mean does this feel
                        right to you?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Doesn't matter how it feels.

                                        BRUCE
                        No?  Since when?  You're not acting
                        like yourself, man.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Maybe I'm acting like a guy who
                        just saw his best friend lying
                        dead under a sheet soaked with
                        his own blood.

                        Keep me safe.  Sure that's the
                        only reason we're here?

                                        JOHNNY
                        What are you talking about?

                                        BRUCE
                        I'm remembering something you
                        told me back at your house, how
                        the Johnny Smith you saw killing
                        that other man couldn't be you.

          Johnny doesn't answer, but it's clear he's hit a nerve.

                                        BRUCE
                        You're thinking if we leave here,
                        you could end up killing someone
                        in revenge, and that scares you
                        almost as much as the thought of
                        me dying.  But I'm telling you
                        now, whatever you think your
                        visions are showing you, that man
                        isn't you.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Then maybe you don't know me as
                        well as you think.

          A beat, then Johnny begins to confess something that's
          been preying on him all day.

                                        JOHNNY
                          Remember that magazine from the
                        future, the one Wey showed me?

                                        BRUCE
                        The one with you on the cover...
                        and the headline, "Will This Man
                        Destroy the World?"

                                        JOHNNY
                                (nods)
                        It made me wonder how all of this --
                          Armageddon... this mission I seem
                        to be on -- might change me.

                                        JOHNNY (CONT'D)
                        Maybe I'll be fighting so hard to
                        save the world that at some point
                        I'll cross a line and become as
                          dangerous as Greg Stillson, maybe
                        even more dangerous.

                                        BRUCE
                        John, you're never gonna become
                        Greg Stillson.

                                        JOHNNY
                          I didn't think so either.  Or at
                        least as long as that fear was
                        tied to some distant future, I
                        could push it to the back of my
                        mind.  But now I've seen how I
                        could cross that line in one night. 
                        Tonight maybe.  And that changes
                          everything.

                                        BRUCE
                        So don't cross that line.  Promise
                          yourself, promise me, that you
                        won't, no matter what happens.
                                (beat)
                        And maybe the best way to make
                        sure of that is to face the future --
                        our future -- head on.

          On Johnny as the truth of this sinks in.  Then:

                                        JOHNNY
                        If none of this had happened, any
                        idea where would you'd be right now?

                                        BRUCE
                                  (considers, then)
                          Probably would've gone for a run,
                        like I do most nights.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You always run the same route?

                                        BRUCE
                                (nods)
                        Yeah.

          Johnny tosses Bruce his jacket.

                                        JOHNNY

          Bruce gives directions while Johnny keeps an eye out for

                          I didn't realize you were such a
                        big runner.

          As it approaches a dead end by a river-front park.

          Johnny stops the car.

                                        BRUCE
                        This park goes along the river
                        for about a quarter mile.  When I
                        can, I try and time it so I catch
                        the sunset.

          Johnny looks at the horizon, now dark.

          But he makes no move to exit.  Bruce eyes him.

                        We're doing the right thing, man.

          Johnny nods, tries to push aside his fears for both of
          them.

  5555EXT. PARK - NIGHT

          Street lights are on as Johnny and Bruce walk along,
          passing joggers and dog-walkers; a family with young kids;
          other pedestrians.  They reach a small paved open area
          with a bench and a tree.  Johnny stops, feeling a
          tightening in his gut.

                                        BRUCE
                          John...?

          But Johnny is looking around, noting a lamp post, the
          nearby pedestrian tunnel.  He's hit again by --

          Also turning as he takes it all in.  Another dog walker
          crosses between them and the river.  Three young men, all
          wearing watch caps, sit on some nearby bleachers drinking
          beer out of paper bags and laughing.  Once again, the
          placid scene contrasts with Johnny's violent recollections.

          Johnny's eyes fall on a familiar patch of concrete.

                        Yeah.  I'm sure.


  5858MEMORY FLASH (B&W)

            A distraught, manic Johnny pushes past Roscoe to crouch
          by the bloodstained concrete, reaches out for a vision.


  5959RESUME JOHNNY

          Now crouching in the same place.  But this time his touch
          yields nothing.  He stands as Bruce eyes the spot.

                        Why do I feel like someone just
                        walked over my grave?

          Johnny doesn't answer, instead moving to touch a bench,
          then the lamp post, his frustration and alarm growing.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'm still not getting anything.

                                        BRUCE
                        Did you expect to?

                        We shouldn't be here.  This is
                        crazy.

                                        BRUCE
                        'Course it's crazy.  "Crazy" has
                        been the theme of both our lives
                        since you came out of that coma. 
                        Why should today be any different?

          Johnny takes out his cell.

                        Who you calling?

                        get some back-up.

          But before he can complete the call, they react to a girl's
          O.S. SCREAM.  A charged look between them, then they race
          in the direction it came, through the pedestrian tunnel.


  6060AT THE OTHER END OF THE TUNNEL

          They hear the shriek again, only now it's followed by
            laughter.  They see the cause:  a BUNCH OF boys and girls
            playfully roughhousing as they play a Hacky Sack game. 
            Relieved, Bruce puts his hand on Johnny's shoulder...

          Only now Johnny notes something else happening back where
          they came from.  A Salesman sits dejectedly on the bench
          by the tree, setting his battered briefcase beside him. 
          Meanwhile, a man in an ARMY JACKET is ambling up behind
          him.  Something about the scene commands Johnny's
          attention; maybe it's the man on the bench, something
          familiar about him...

                                        JOHNNY
                          Bruce...

          But before the thought can fully form, Bruce turns and
          they both see Army Jacket jerk an object from his pocket
          (a piece of PIPE, but we can't see it clearly) and whack
          Salesman hard across the head.  Johnny and Bruce react as
          Salesman goes down.

                                        BRUCE
                        That's it!  It's happening!
                                (shouts)
                        Hey!

          Army Jacket turns and sees them, then grabs the Salesman's
            briefcase and takes off.  Bruce tenses, about to take
          some action, but Johnny stops him, having made a snap
          judgment that the mugger is the man he's been seeking --
          the man who would've attacked Bruce, but instead attacked
          the Salesman.  He doesn't want Bruce anywhere near him.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I'll take the mugger, try'n see
                        where he's going.  You help that
                        guy.

                                        BRUCE
                        You sure?

                                        JOHNNY
                        Yeah.

          He takes off, and as he does so CAMERA pulls back slightly --
          to REVEAL ANOTHER JOHNNY standing there watching him go.

          We're in a vision; a vision that started when Bruce touched
          Johnny's shoulder.  This new Johnny ("Observer-Johnny")
          watches Bruce head toward the fallen Salesman, then we
          CUT TO --


    6161VISION-JOHNNY

          Now chasing after Army Jacket, CAMERA tracking with him
          as he passes various people, among them a DOG-WALKER, an
          ELDERLY COUPLE on a bench, and a HOMELESS MAN looking for
          bottles in the trash.  With his bad leg, he's hard-pressed
          just to keep the mugger in sight, and now the man scrambles
          over a low stone wall, dropping the briefcase, then keeps
          running.  Vision-Johnny rushes toward the wall, not seeing
          the last person he passes, who once again is -- 


            OBSERVER-JOHNNY

          now watching from the edge of the path.  CAMERA hangs
          back with him as he turns to see Vision-Johnny reach the
          wall, winded, leg throbbing, only to see the mugger tearing
          ass out of the park.  Giving up on the chase, he picks up
          the briefcase... and reacts to a frightening vision (a
          vision neither we, nor the Johnny watching from within
          this vision, see, but the import of which is clear).

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Bruce! 

          He's already turning to run back, Observer-Johnny reacting
          to his look of alarm, when THE SCENE FREEZES.

            Vision-Johnny is frozen in mid-step, as Observer-Johnny
          now turns and starts to rush back through the frozen
            surroundings.  He passes the same people Vision-Johnny
          passed going the other way, now all frozen, and arrives
          back at the open area to see the three young men frozen
          as they approach Bruce, who's crouched by the fallen
            Salesman.  Now he recognizes two of them as the Punks
          from his vision in Walt's office.  One of them (Punk 1)
          has an unopened clasp knife in one hand.  Then the scene
          UNFREEZES, Bruce oblivious to the approaching threat as
          he checks on the Salesman, who's lying face down.

                                        BRUCE
                        Man, are you all right? 
                                (the Salesman groans)
                        Don't move, okay?  I'll get help.

          Bruce sees a CELL PHONE in a holster on the man's belt,
          but as he starts to remove it --

                                        PUNK 1 (O.S.)
                                  (sarcastic)
                        "Wassup Dawg?" 

          Bruce turns, startled.

                                        PUNK 2
                        Yo, check it out.  The spade's
                        robbing that dude.

                                        BRUCE
                        No, I'm not.  I'm trying to help
                        him.

                                        PUNK 1
                        Yeah, help yourself to his wallet. 
                        Wrong move, spade.

          He flicks out the knife blade.  Bruce rises, holding out
          his hands placatingly.

                                        BRUCE
                        Hey! 

          And is promptly sucker punched by Punk 3 as Johnny watches
          helplessly.

                                        PUNK 2
                        That's it!   Kick his ass! 

          They converge on Bruce, who struggles to hold his own,
          knocking down Punk 3, then managing to knock the knife
          out of Punk 1's hand.  Meanwhile --


          THE SALESMAN

          starts to pick himself up, and Observer-Johnny, now
          revealed crouching beside him, sees his fear and confusion,
          and something else:  the tattoo on his right forearm.  In
          an instant he realizes that this is the man he's been
          seeking, the real threat.  And in that moment, Bruce is
          SLAMMED into the Salesman, knocking him back down.  The
          man hasn't even had a chance to take in the fight; he
          just thinks he's still being attacked by whoever originally
          brained him.  Panicked, and enraged, he sees --

          THE KNIFE

          lying on the ground.  In anger and desperation he grabs
          it, turning and STABBING Bruce as Observer-Johnny reacts,
          stunned as he realizes how this actually happens.  Bruce
          tries to ward off this new attacker, which only heightens
          the Salesman's fear, and the rage fanned by that fear. 
          He goes berserk, stabbing Bruce again and again as Observer-
          Johnny watches in horror.  Even the Punks are freaked and
          run off.  A beat, then the Salesman rises, stares at the
          bloody knife in his hands as if emerging from a fog, then
          runs off too, tossing the knife in the bushes as he goes. 
          Bruce rolls weakly onto his back as now Observer-Johnny
          sees --


            VISION-JOHNNY

          hobbling around a turn in the path, then reacting to the
          awful sight and rushing to his bleeding friend's side.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Bruce!

            Vision-Johnny crouches, cradling Bruce's shoulders, while
            Observer-Johnny hovers behind him like an anxious spirit.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                          Bruce...

                                  blood)

                        John... that you? 

          Bruce's eyes open but we sense his sight is already fading,
          and now those dimming eyes seem to look past Vision-Johnny
          to our Johnny, who's watching with an expression that is
          just a step removed from Vision-Johnny's utter anguish.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY
                        Yeah, I'm here.  Just hang on,
                        buddy, I'll get an ambulance.

          But as he fumbles for his cell, Bruce continues speaking
          as if to our Johnny; or in other words, to the air...

                                        BRUCE
                        John, if you can hear me, you
                        gotta remember...

                        who you are.

          Then his eyes close, and as Observer-Johnny lowers his
          head, Vision-Johnny is convulsed by grief.

                                        VISION-JOHNNY

          Johnny looks back toward --

          react as though he's trying to cut in line.  He holds up
          his phone --

                        What's your problem?  We were
                        just going to help the guy.

                        Yeah, what'd you think, we were
                        gonna rob him?

          Johnny can't help but eye the closed knife Punk 1 still
          has in his hand.

                        How about you back off, gimp?

          He holds out the blade, expecting Johnny to run, then
          cries out in surprise and pain when Johnny instead whacks
          it out of his hand with his cane.

          it's Johnny who mugged him.  Once again, he sees the knife
          on the ground, grabs it, and turns, slashing Johnny in

  7373RESUME - JOHNNY AND THE SALESMAN GRAPPLE ON THE GROUND

          Johnny's managed to knock the knife loose but his attempt
          to defend himself is just making the panicked Salesman
          flail more wildly.  Johnny tries to get through to him --

          But the man is beyond reason, and we sense that Johnny
          too is being pushed toward an emotional edge, both by
          this increasingly desperate fight and his memories of the
          one it parallels.  Forced onto his back, he sees --

          In self-defense, Johnny begins choking the Salesman as

          is somehow catching up with him in the present; he may've
          changed the time and place, but he can't escape this

                        John, if you can hear me, you
                        gotta remember...

          As Johnny's eyes blink --


  8080MEMORY FLASH: (B&W)

          Johnny hovers over Vision-Johnny, who's cradling the dying
          Bruce, and this time -- whether by coincidence or some
          strange design -- it indeed seems as though Bruce is
          talking to him. 

                                        BRUCE (CONT'D)
                          ...remember your promise, John. 
                        No matter what happens remember...
                        who you are.


  8181RESUME TIGHT ON JOHNNY

          As something changes in Johnny's eyes.  The ROARING sound
          abates somewhat and now he sees --

          THE SALESMAN, eyes bulging from fear and lack of oxygen,
          his hands weakly trying to break Johnny's death grip --

          JOHNNY'S EXPRESSION registers awareness of what he's doing --
          what he's doing to another human being, and to himself. 
          The roaring fades, he releases his grip and sits back,
          pale and spent, while the Salesman remains sprawled on
          his back, gasping.

          A POLICE SIREN scatters the Punks as the CAMERA moves up
          and away, framing the two men in the arena-like circle of
          concrete lit by the street lamps, then finding the larger
          ring of surrounding trees, then the curve of the dark
          river, until finally we...

                                                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN:

  8282EXT. LAKE - DAY

          A WHIRRING SOUND accompanies a shot of a fishing lure
          arcing out over the still water and landing with a splash. 
          A beat as the bobber settles on the surface, then it's
          tugged back toward shore, where we...

          FIND JOHNNY, slightly bruised, his arm bandaged, slowly
          reeling in the line as he stands alone at the lake's edge.



                                                                (CONTINUED)          DEAD ZONE: SHADOWS - ACT FOUR - 4/13/04 - GREEN       58.

                        They biting?

          Johnny turns to see Bruce approaching.

                                        JOHNNY
                        Not for me.

                                        BRUCE
                        Figured I might find you here. 
                        'Case you didn't know, that guy
                        dropped his charges against you. 
                        Walt had a little talk with him,
                        about what might've happened,
                        kinda sobered him up.

          Johnny nods, looking pretty sobered up himself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        What might've happened, huh?

                                        BRUCE
                        Yeah, but didn't, thankfully for
                        all concerned.

          Johnny watches his line, chewing over something in his
          mind.

                                        JOHNNY
                        You know, on the way here I passed
                        an accident.  A car had gone up
                        on a sidewalk, hit a bus stop.  I
                          stopped, asked if anyone had been
                        hit, and the cops said no.
                                (turning to him)
                        But imagine if you were sitting
                        on that bench.  Suddenly...
                                (beat)
                        Life can be like that.  That
                        sudden.  That unpredictable.  Now
                        factor in the end of the world.

                                        BRUCE
                        So what're you saying?

                        I can't see the whole future,
                        just the pieces my visions show
                        me.  I don't know what's gonna
                        happen.  And if I can't trust my
                        own actions...

                                        BRUCE
                        Whoa...

                                        JOHNNY
                          I almost lost it.  Became that
                        other person.  Crossed that line.

                                        BRUCE
                        Only you didn't.  You're no Greg
                          Stillson, John.  You're a good
                        man, and a good man remembers
                        where that line is.

                        Or maybe I was just lucky you
                        were there to remind me.

                                        BRUCE
                        Me?  I was half way downtown
                        chasing that mugger.  How could I
                        remind you?
                                (off his pointed look)
                        In a vision?  But I thought in
                        your last...
                                  (realizing)
                        You mean something I said when I
                        was... when I was dying?

                                        JOHNNY
                                (nods)
                        It was like you knew it was a
                        vision, and that when it was over,
                        I'd still need your help.

                                        BRUCE
                        So something I said when I was
                        dying in a vision of a future
                        that never happened...?

          He shakes his head at the weirdness of this.  Then:

                                        BRUCE
                        Guess it proves one thing.  It
                        always pays to listen to me.

          But his quip fails to change Johnny's somber mood.

                                        JOHNNY
                        And what if you're not there next
                        time?

                                        BRUCE
                        I'll always be there, man.  Trust
                        me.  And more importantly, trust
                          yourself.

                                        JOHNNY
                        I wish I could.

          He casts again.  Both men turn to watch the lure land,
          then remain silent as Johnny starts to reel it in.  Off
          the moment, quiet but no longer peaceful...

                                                                              FADE OUT.
