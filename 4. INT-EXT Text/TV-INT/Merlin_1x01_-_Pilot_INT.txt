      MERLIN makes his way through the King s Palace.  He stares in 
      wonder at the preparations for the anniversary celebration 
      that are already in full swing, with SERVANTS scurrying 
      hither and thither with food, wine etc. 

      MERLIN reaches the end of the corridor and hesitates, 
      slightly lost.  He turns to a GUARD to ask directions ...

                                  MERLIN
                    Where would I find Gaius, the Court 
                      Physician?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      A large circular room with a vaulted ceiling.  Every nook and 
      cranny is crammed with books, jars, vials, bubbling potions 
      etc.  MERLIN peers through the murk and dust - there's no 
      sign of life. 

      He steps gingerly across the threshold. He makes his way 
      through the clutter: the shelves of books and jars seem to go 
      on forever. He calls out ... 


                                  MERLIN
                          (tentatively)
                    Hello?

      No reply. He rounds a corner...

      Perched on a rickety ladder, high above his head, MERLIN can 
      just make out a shock of silver hair - this is GAIUS, 
      rummaging in the rafters for a book or potion. He seems 
      oblivious to MERLIN's presence, so MERLIN self-consciously 
      clears his throat - GAIUS spins round in complete fright, 
      topples from his ladder and plummets towards the flagstones 
      below... 

      MERLIN s eyes widen - we hear the sound of his heartbeat 
      pounding ...

      GAIUS continues to fall, but his descent slows - we re now in 
      SLOW MOTION: MERLIN TIME.

      MERLIN glances across the room and spies...

      A pair of large corn sacks resting in the far corner.  
      MERLIN s eyes flare...

      GAIUS continues his terrifying descent. But just before he 
      hits the flagstones one of the corn sacks flies - at 
      breakneck speed - across the floor. 

      GAIUS lands in a gigantic cloud of dust and corn husks.

      A beat, GAIUS takes a moment to recover.  He sits cradled in 
      the sack staring at MERLIN ... 

                                  GAIUS
                    How the ...!  

      He looks toward the far corner and the other sack - there s 
      no way MERLIN could ve physically moved it.

                                  GAIUS
                    What did you just do?

                                  MERLIN
                    Uh ...

      MERLIN looks alarmed, fearing he s given himself away.  GAIUS 
      struggles to his feet - unable to contain his amazement.  

                                  GAIUS
                    Tell me.

                                  MERLIN
                    I don t know what happened.  

                                  GAIUS
                    If anyone had seen that ....

                                  MERLIN
                    It was nothing to do with me.  It 
                    was ...

                                  GAIUS
                          (stern)
                    I know what it was.  I want to know 
                    where you learnt to do it.

                                  MERLIN
                    Nowhere.

                                  GAIUS
                    Then how is it you know magic?

      MERLIN doesn t know what to say.

                                  GAIUS
                    Where did you study?

      MERLIN stares at him - fearing he s in a lot of trouble.

                                  MERLIN
                    Well ...

                                  GAIUS
                          (insistent)
                    Answer me.

                                  MERLIN
                    I ve never studied magic or been 
                    taught ....  

                                  GAIUS
                    You re lying to me, boy; this is 
                      important.

                                  MERLIN
                    What am I meant to say?

                                  GAIUS
                    The truth.

                                  MERLIN
                    I was born like this.

                                  GAIUS
                    That s impossible.

      MERLIN looks awkward.  GAIUS stares at him.

                                  GAIUS
                    Who are you?

                                  MERLIN
                          (he searches his bag)
                    I have this letter.

      He takes out a parchment and hands it to GAIUS.  GAIUS 
      examines it ...

                                  GAIUS
                    I don t have my glasses.  

                                  MERLIN
                    I m Merlin.

                                  GAIUS
                    Hunith s son?

                                  MERLIN
                    Yes.

      A beat.

                                  GAIUS
                          (thrown)
                    But you re not meant to be here 
                     till Wednesday.

                                  MERLIN
                    It is Wednesday.

      GAIUS stares at him.  A beat.

                                  GAIUS
                    Alright, then ... Well ... put your 
                    bag in there.
                          (he indicates a door)

      MERLIN looks grateful and heads toward the room.

                                  MERLIN
                          (a beat - he turns back to 
                            Gaius)
                    You won t say anything ...

                                  GAIUS
                    No.

      GAIUS looks up at the ladder to where he d been standing ...

                                  GAIUS
                    Although, Merlin ... 

      MERLIN stops at the door and looks back at GAIUS.

                                  GAIUS
                    I should say  thank you .

      A garret room, MERLIN finishes unpacking his things and sits 
      down on his tiny bed - wondering what he should do next...

      He glances up. Above the bed is a shutter, he opens it to 
      reveal a small window...

      MERLIN looks out over Camelot at dusk, it s aglow with small 
      flickering torches that twinkle like fairy lights.  He gazes 
      down into the busy high street beneath his window - it s full 
      of life, colour and endless possibilities. We can sense 
      MERLIN s excitement and keenness to become involved...


                                                                            CUT TO:

      GAIUS sits down to read the letter MERLIN gave him.  We hear 
      the voice of HUNITH, Merlin s mother.

                                  HUNITH (V.O.)
                    Gaius, my dear brother, I turn to 
                    you for I feel lost and alone, and 
                    know not who to trust ...

                                                                            FADE TO:

      A simple workman s cottage.  HUNITH, a comely woman in her 
      40 s, sits at the foot of a bed. She looks down with tears in 
      her eyes as she watches MERLIN sleeping with his head resting 
      against his backpack.

                                  HUNITH (V.O.)
                    ... Merlin is my only child, to the 
                    eye his smiling face is like any 
                    other.  It is every mother s fate 
                    to think her child is special and 
                    yet I would give my life that 
                    Merlin were not so.

                                    HUNITH(cont'd)

                    Ours is a small village and he is 
                    so clearly at odds with people here 
                    that if he were to remain I fear 
                    what would become of him.  

                                                                            FADE TO:

      As he finishes reading we can see the increasing concern 
      etched on GAIUS' face.

                                  HUNITH (V.O.)
                    In these times, he needs a hand to 
                    hold, a voice to guide, someone 
                    that might help him find a purpose 
                    for his gifts.  To this end, I hope 
                    and trust, my dear brother, that 
                    you will have it in your heart to 
                    be that person.  I beg you, if you 
                      understand a mother s love for her 
                    son, keep him safe.  And may God 
                    save you both.

      GAIUS puts the letter down and thinks long and hard. What is 
      he to do?

                                                                            CUT TO:

      NIGHT 1. UK/FR.

      The empty courtyard, the executioner s block and axe glint in 
      the moonlight.  MORGANA looking down over the scene through 
      the open window, a knock at the door.  

                                  UTHER (O.S)
                    Morgana?

      She turns.

                                    MORGANA
                    Yes?

      UTHER enters.  MORGANA looks at him, then moves from the 
      window.  


                                  UTHER
                    Why aren t you joining in with the

                                    MORGANA
                    I just don t think that chopping

                    It is only justice for what he d

                                    MORGANA
                    To whom?

                    It is the law of the land.

                    Your law.
                          (lightly)
                    I d be careful ...

      UTHER glances at her.

                                    MORGANA
                    The more brutal you are, the more 
                    enemies you ll create.

                                  UTHER
                    I don t fear them.

                    Maybe you don t - but you put the 
                    rest of us in danger.

      UTHER takes this in as MORGANA turns away from the window.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Inside her tent, DAME HELEN OF MORA sings as she plaits her 
      long hair, preparing herself for bed.  Her looks are as 
      beautiful and striking as her voice.  Suddenly, the candles 
      lighting the tent flicker...

      DAME HELEN stops her song, turns and looks toward the 
      entrance.  There s a sound outside... a twig breaking under a 
      footstep ...

      No response.

                    Yes, Dame Helen.

                                  DAME HELEN
                    Is all well?

                    Yes, M am.  With luck we should 
                    reach Camelot by tomorrow.

                                  DAME HELEN
                    That s good.

      DAME HELEN remains uneasy.

                                  SERGEANT
                    I ll be outside if you need me.

      He leaves.

      face with the hideous, gnarled visage of MARY COLLINS.

      MARY COLLINS is holding a rudimentary straw doll with a noose 
      around its neck.  MARY COLLINS snaps the noose tight ... 

      DAME HELEN s eyes pop and she grabs herself round the neck.  
      She is being magically strangled, she s unable to breathe, 
      unable to scream... 

      MARY COLLINS smiles as she watches DAME HELEN slump to the 
      ground ...

      A moment, then MARY COLLINS begins to change. Slowly but 
      surely her face transforms into DAME HELEN s.

      The new DAME HELEN stares down at the dead DAME HELEN, a 
      broad smile crossing the now beautiful face. She tucks in her 
      pendant, the only clue to her real identity.

                                                                            CUT TO:


1717

      A new day.  MERLIN asleep on the narrow uncomfortable bed, a 
      slit of bright sunlight on his face.  He opens his eyes, 
      suddenly remembering where he is ...

                                                                            CUT TO:


1818

      MERLIN enters the room, still pulling on his clothes.  He 
      stops as he sees GAIUS standing by the kitchen table.   
      Hunith s letter is still sitting on the table, next to it is 
      a plate of food and a pail of water.  

                                  GAIUS 
                    I got you some water, you didn t 
                    have a wash last night.

                                  MERLIN
                    Sorry.

                                  GAIUS
                    Help yourself to breakfast.

      A hungry MERLIN sees the food and quickly reaches past GAIUS 
      across the table ... Behind his back we see GAIUS 
        deliberately knock the pail from the table ...

                                  GAIUS
                          (as if the spilt pail is 
                            Merlin s fault)
                    Merlin!

      MERLIN reacts, turns and sees the pail falling.  He reaches 
      out with his hands, but there s no way he s going to catch 
      it.  Instinctively, without thought, he uses his magic ...

      The bucket and the tumbling water stop their fall and hang 
      suspended above the floor.

      MERLIN instantly realises what he s done and flashes a look 
      at GAIUS. They lock eyes. We see MERLIN s panic ...

      The bucket suddenly crashes to the floor, spilling its 
      contents everywhere.  GAIUS steps back to avoid the splash.  
      MERLIN hurries to clear it up.  

                                  MERLIN
                    It was my fault.

                                  GAIUS
                    How did you do that?

      MERLIN looks at him.   

                                  GAIUS
                    Tell me.  I want to know.  Did you 
                    incant a spell in your mind?

                                  MERLIN
                    I don t know any spells.

                                  GAIUS
                    So what did you do?

      MERLIN shrugs.

                                  GAIUS
                    There must be something.

                                  MERLIN
                    It just happens.  I can t control 
                    it.

      GAIUS stares at him, totally bemused by his powers.  MERLIN 
      continues to clear up.  Finally, he looks at GAIUS.

                                  MERLIN
                    What are you going to do?

                                  GAIUS 
                    It s not me you need to worry 
                    about. 
                          (sighs)
                    But for a start you can help me out 
                    till I find you some paid work ...


      GAIUS picks up a handful of remedies ...

                                  GAIUS
                    Here.  Hollyhock and Feverfew for

                    Owain ... 
                          (he hands him a phial)
                    He s blind as a weevil. Tell him 
                    not to take all of it at once. 

                                  MERLIN
                    Ok.

                                  GAIUS
                    Here ...
                          (he hands him some 
                            sweetmeat)

      He gives MERLIN a fatherly smile.  

                                  GAIUS
                    Off you go.

      MERLIN smiles and prepares to set off, a spring in his step, 
      keen to get out into the city.  GAIUS watches him, his 
      concern once again apparent.  As MERLIN gets to the door, 
      GAIUS stops him ...

                                  GAIUS
                    And Merlin ...

      MERLIN looks at him ...

                                  GAIUS
                    I don t need to tell you, but the 
                      practising of any form of 
                      enchantments will get you killed - 
                    D you understand that?

      MERLIN nods.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      UTHER waits for DAME HELEN to arrive. MORGANA stands nearby 
      with GWEN, her maidservant. As DAME HELEN enters, MORGANA 
      turns to GWEN.

                                    MORGANA
                            (whispering)
                    Have you ever heard Dame Helen 
                    sing?

      GWEN shakes her head.

                                  GWEN
                    They say it s like having your ears 
                    kissed by Cupid.

      MORGANA smiles.

                                    MORGANA
                    Sounds good ... Though I can t say 
                    I m familiar with that experience.

                                  GWEN
                          (embarrassed)
                    Oh, no. Nor I am. 

      DAME HELEN reaches the throne. UTHER rises to greet her. 

                                  UTHER
                    Dame Helen. Thank you so much for 
                    coming to sing at our celebrations.

                                  DAME HELEN
                    The pleasure is all mine.

                                  UTHER
                    How was your journey?

                                  DAME HELEN
                    Oh, the time it took, sire.

                                  UTHER
                          (he kisses her hand)
                    I know, but it s always worth the 
                    wait.

      She touches the pendant under her clothing. For a moment her 
      eyes flash with anger as she stares at UTHER, although he 
      doesn t see it.


                                  DAME HELEN
                    I hope so.
                          (she smiles)

      MORGANA rolls her eyes - not enjoying watching the crinklies 
      flirt. Reveal MERLIN watching the scene from the doorway. A 
      guard spies him and starts to head over. MERLIN ducks back 
      through the door and continues on his way. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MERLIN hurries down a corridor and knocks on a small door.  A 
      man opens it. He squints at MERLIN.

                                  MERLIN
                          (holding out bottle)
                    I brought you your medicine.

      The man tries to take it but can t see a thing. MERLIN places 
      it in his hand. 

                                  MERLIN
                    Gaius said don t take it all...

      He stops as he sees the man down the medicine in one.

                                  MERLIN
                    I m sure it s fine...

      MERLIN hurries away.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Morning.  MERLIN deep in the bowels of the castle, 
      languishing in a filthy cell.  He lies on the floor, asleep. 
      Suddenly, he hears a voice and wakes with a start ...

      The voice is coming from somewhere deep beneath him, calling 
      him, the earth trembles:  Merlin .  


      MERLIN jumps to his feet and retreats across the cell staring 
      at the ground in shock...

      The earth calls to him once more:  Merlin . It s a voice we 
      might recognise from the opening.   

      MERLIN bends toward the ground and nervously places his ear 
      to the floor ...

      The voice again: Merlin . Only this time it s loud and right 
      behind him...

                                  GAIUS
                    Are you a complete idiot?

      GAIUS is standing in the doorway.  He s furious ...

                                  GAIUS
                    The one thing someone like you 
                    should do is keep your head down, 
                    and what do you do? 

                                  MERLIN
                    I m sorry.

                                  GAIUS
                    You re lucky.  I ve pulled a few 
                    strings to get you released.

                                  MERLIN
                          (delighted)
                    Oh thank you, thank you.  I won t

                    There is a small price to pay.

      GAIUS is preparing food, he glances up as MERLIN enters from 
      his bedroom.  He s washed and changed. MERLIN sits at the 
      table and looks at the food. 

                                  GAIUS
                    D you want some vegetables with 
                    that?

      MERLIN glances at him.  GAIUS smiles and joins him.  

                                  MERLIN
                          (he doesn t eat)
                    I know you re still angry with me.

                                  GAIUS
                    Your mother asked me to look after 
                    you.

                                  MERLIN
                    Yes.

                                  GAIUS
                    What d you think she would have 
                    said?

      MERLIN absorbs this. GAIUS watches MERLIN eat for a moment.

                                  GAIUS
                    What did she say to you about your 
                    gifts?

                                  MERLIN

                    That I was  special .

                                  GAIUS
                    You are special.  The like of which

                                  MERLIN
                    Why?

                                  GAIUS
                    You promise me that you have not 
                    been taught.

                                  MERLIN
                    Never.

                                  GAIUS
                    This is beyond any human power.

                                  MERLIN
                    I don t understand.

                                  GAIUS
                    There was a time, when the dragons 
                    still walked the land, when magic 
                    was practiced freely, but it 
                    required incantations, spells... 
                    These had to be learnt from books.  
                    It took years of study; believe me, 
                    you have no idea.


      MERLIN takes in the wall of books beside him.

                                  MERLIN
                    Did you ever practice magic?

                                  GAIUS
                          (evading the question)
                    You don t understand. What I saw 
                    you do ... It was remarkable. 
                      Elemental. Instinctive.

                                  MERLIN
                    But what s the point if it can t be 
                    used?

                                  GAIUS
                    I don t know.
                          (a beat)
                    You re a question that has never 
                    been posed before, Merlin.

      MERLIN stares at him, slightly daunted by this.  

                                  GAIUS
                          (changing the subject)
                    Now, I ve got another errand for 
                    you to run. There s a preparation 
                    for Dame Helen, she needs it for 
                    her voice.

                                                                            CUT TO:

2727

      MERLIN arrives at Dame Helen's chambers.  He knocks.  There s 
      no reply.  He slowly pushes the door ajar and peers inside 
      ...

      The room appears empty.  Unsure what to do, MERLIN slips 
                ....
      inside 

                                                                            CUT TO:


2828

      MERLIN crosses toward the dressing table, the room is 
      sumptuous. Despite his promise to stay out of trouble, MERLIN 
      can't resist having a little look around. 

                                                                            CUT TO:


2929

      DAME HELEN approaching down the corridor, she has a faint 
      smile on her face following her encounter with Uther.

                                                                            CUT TO:


3030

      MERLIN sees an old book hidden beneath a goblet and some 
      items on the dressing table.  Intrigued, MERLIN takes it out, 
      careful not to disrupt anything ...

      He studies the book s mysterious cover ... and slowly opens 
      it. Suddenly, he hears a noise outside ...

      MERLIN rushes to return the book.  In his panic he knocks 
      over a jewellery box and the goblet.  He scrambles to put 
      them back into place. 

      He turns to face DAME HELEN. He doesn t see the reflection 
      she casts in the goblet - for a split second we glimpse the 
      hideous face of MARY COLLINS.  

                                  DAME HELEN
                          (quiet and menacing)
                    What re you doing in here?

                                  MERLIN
                    I was asked to deliver this.

      He picks up the pouch of medication and hands it to DAME 
  
      HELEN.   He beats a hasty retreat.

                                                                            CUT TO:


3131

      MERLIN shuts the door behind him and hurries away feeling a 
      little uneasy ...


                                                                            CUT TO:


3333

      GAIUS is up a ladder.  He hears a roar from outside in the 
      street. He climbs down to see what the disturbance is.  

                                                                            CUT TO:


3434

      GAIUS comes out of his chambers and walks over to a window. 
      He looks out into the high street and we see his horror as 
      below him...


                                                                            CUT TO:


3636

      MERLIN enters, a look of wounded pride on his face.  GAIUS 
      follows him into the room, closes the door and rounds on him 
      ...

                                  GAIUS
                    How could you be so foolish .... 
                    Using magic like that will get you 
                    killed.

                                  MERLIN
                    He needed to be taught a lesson.

                                  GAIUS
                    You re the one who needs to learn. 
                    Magic must be studied, mastered, 
                    and used for good. Not for idiotic 
                    pranks.  

                                  MERLIN
                    What is there to master?  I could 
                    move objects like that before I 
                    could talk.  

                                  GAIUS
                    Then by now you should be able to 
                    control yourself.

                                  MERLIN
                    I don t want to.  If I can t use 
                    magic, what have I got?

                                    MERLIN(cont'd)

                    I m just a  nobody  - and always 
                    will be.  If I can t use magic, 
                    then I might as well die.  

      Upset, he heads off into his own room. GAIUS watches him go.  
      He sighs - he wasn t cut out to be a surrogate parent...

                                                                            CUT TO:


3737

      MERLIN is lying on his bed.  He sees GAIUS enter, carrying 
      ointments and bandages.

                                  GAIUS
                    Merlin ...

      But MERLIN is still angry ...

                                  MERLIN
                    Why isn t there anyone who can help 
                    me?  

      GAIUS stares at him - unprepared for this.  

                                  GAIUS
                    Come here...

      He takes hold of his face, sits down beside MERLIN and starts  
      treating his wounds.

                                  MERLIN
                    You don t know why I was born like 
                    this, do you?  

                                  GAIUS
                          (unsure how to answer)
                    No.

                                  MERLIN
                    I m not a monster, am I ...

      He searches GAIUS s eyes...

      GAIUS looks at MERLIN s pained expression.


                                  GAIUS
                    Don t ever think that.

                                  MERLIN
                    Then why am I like this?  
                    Please.  I need to know - Why?

      GAIUS has no answer.

                                  GAIUS
                    Perhaps someone with more knowledge 
                    than me ...

                                  MERLIN
                    If you can t tell me, then no one 
                    can.

      GAIUS feels this.

                                  GAIUS
                    Answers aren t like that.  They 
                    don t sit there on shelves getting 
                    dusty waiting for you to come 
                    along.  I believe there is an 
                    answer.  But it may well arise out 
                    of events that we cannot yet know.  
                    You must be patient.

      MERLIN looks at him.  

                                  GAIUS
                          (he hands him a remedy)
                    Take some of this.  It will help 
                    with the pain.

                                                                            CUT TO:


3939

      MERLIN asleep on his bed, his bed suddenly begins to vibrate 
      with the sound of a deep voice that emanates from beneath the 
      floor ... 

                                  GREAT DRAGON (V.O.)
                    Merlin!

      MERLIN wakes with a start, unsure if he s in a dream ...

                                  GREAT DRAGON (V.O.)
                    Merlin!

      He sits bolt upright and listens.  Nothing, silence, then the 
      faint noise of something outside the door...

                                                                            CUT TO:

4040

      A candle burning late into the night.  GAIUS is sat at the 
      table surrounded by books, squinting through his rudimentary 
      spectacles.  As he reads, he becomes aware of MERLIN standing 
      at the door to his bedroom.

                                  GAIUS
                    Have you come back to shout at me 
                    again?

      He smiles. 

                                  MERLIN
                    No.
                          (a beat - unsure whether 
                          to say)
                    Did you hear a noise?

                                  GAIUS
                    No.

                                  MERLIN
                      A voice...?

                                  GAIUS
                          (he looks at him - a 
                            smile)
                    Probably the effects of the 
                    sedative I gave you.

      MERLIN sits down at the table.

                                  MERLIN
                    Why did Uther ban magic?

                                  GAIUS
                    Magic corrupts, Merlin. You re too 
                    young to know - there was a time 
                    when people used magic for the 
                    wrong ends.  It destroyed the 
                    natural order.  It brought about 
                    chaos on earth.  In the end, Uther 
                    put an end to it.  He made it his 
                    mission to destroy everything from 
                    that time - even the dragons.


                                  MERLIN
                    Why?

                                  GAIUS
                    They knew too much.  And Uther 
                    feared them.  So he had them 
                      slaughtered.

                                  MERLIN
                          (appalled)
                    What - all of them?

                                  GAIUS
                    Well ...  There was one dragon he 
                    chose not to kill, but to keep as 
                    an example.  He imprisoned it in a 
                    cave deep beneath the castle...

                                  MERLIN
                          (a realisation)
                    Beneath the dungeon.

                                  GAIUS
                    Where no one can free it.

      But MERLIN S hardly listening. A penny is dropping in his 
      mind.

                                                                            CUT TO:


4141

      MERLIN sneaks through the empty castle, fearing discovery at 
      every turn ...

      He hears the sound of the GREAT DRAGON calling him on ...

                                  GREAT DRAGON (O.S.)
                    Merlin!

                                                                            CUT TO:


4242

      A few sleeping PRISONERS and TWO GUARDS playing dice - very 
      much awake.  We see MERLIN peering through a door at them ...

      A beat, MERLIN scans the dungeons until he spies a cave 
      entrance in a disused section beyond the guards and away from 
      the cells ...

      He looks at the GUARDS, they re focused on their game, but 
      there is still no way to get past them.  A look of irritation 
      passes across MERLIN s face, then we see a familiar look of 
      concentration take hold ...

      A GUARD throws the dice, they bounce off the table and keep 
      rolling.  The GUARD gets up to retrieve them ...

      But the dice keep rolling.  Every time he bends and stretches 
      for them they elude his grasp ...

      Until finally, he reaches the far end of the dungeon (away 
      from the cave entrance).  He grabs for a die and finds it s 
      lodged between two cobblestones, he can t move it ...  

      The other GUARD reacts ...

                                  GUARD
                    What re you doing?

      He goes over to help his colleague, they both struggle to 
      release the die ...

      MERLIN waits till their backs are turned and then makes a 
      dash for the cave and slips inside ...

      A long winding tunnel falling away at a steep angle.  MERLIN 
      descends into the darkness, unsure what he s going to find...


      Suddenly, magically, an old rushlight on the wall flares into 
      life.  MERLIN looks surprised - it s clearly not of his 
      doing.  One by one, a series of torches burst into flame 
      lighting the path ahead and leading him on... 

      MERLIN quickens his step. The tunnel gets narrower and 
      narrower until MERLIN is virtually bent double. 

      Finally, MERLIN turns a corner and is faced with his own 
      reflection glistening in a strange, black convex mirror ...

      He hears laughter.  He looks around, trying to locate the 
      source of the disembodied voice ...

                                  MERLIN
                    Where are you?

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    I m here.

      The black mirror suddenly recedes and we realise it is a huge 
      eyeball ...

      It disappears, leaving a large gaping chasm.  MERLIN 
      cautiously takes a step forward and stares into the void ...

      Ghosts of smoke hanging in the air ... 

      MERLIN controls his fear and leans out through the hole... 

      We see a vast natural cavern and there, at the foot, is the 
      GREAT DRAGON, some fifteen or twenty meters long.

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                          (amused)
                    How small you are ...

      The dragon s P.O.V:  The tiny figure of MERLIN standing on a 
      narrow lip of rock.

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    For such a great destiny.

                                  MERLIN
                    Why?  What d you mean?

      The dragon chortles ...

                                  MERLIN
                    What destiny?

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    Your  gift , Merlin, was given to 
                    you for a reason.

                                  MERLIN
                    So there is a reason!

      The dragon smiles.

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    Arthur is the once and future king 
                    who will unite the land of Albion.  

                                  MERLIN
                    I don t see what that has to do 
                    with me.

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                      Everything. Without you, Arthur 
                    will never succeed. Without you, 
                    there will be no Albion.

                                  MERLIN
                    No ... No, you ve got this wrong.


                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    There is no right or wrong. Only 
                    what is and what isn t.

                                  MERLIN
                    I m serious ... If anyone wants to 
                    kill him they can go ahead.  In 
                    fact, I ll give them a hand.

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                          (amused)

                                  GREAT DRAGON(cont'd)

                          (then with a hint of 
                            sadness)
                    And none of us can escape it.

                                  MERLIN
                    No, no way, there must be some 
                    other Arthur, because this one s a 
                    moron.

                                  GREAT DRAGON
                    Perhaps it s your destiny to change 
                    that.

      Suddenly, the dragon raises its massive wings and soars into 
      the air...

      MERLIN watches in a amazement as the giant beast circles in 
      the darkness of the cavern and comes to rest on a ledge far 
      above him... 

                                  MERLIN
                    Wait! I need to know more...

      But his words are lost in the vast expanse ...

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MERLIN is asleep, exhausted by the revelations of the 
      previous night.  GAIUS enters.  The place is a mess, clothes 
      everywhere, a typical teenager s room.

                                  GAIUS
                    Have you seen the state of this 
                    room?

                                  MERLIN
                          (bleary eyed)
                    It just happens.

                                  GAIUS
                    By magic?

                                  MERLIN
                    Yeah.

                                  GAIUS
                    Well, you can clear it up - without 
                    using magic.
                          (a beat)
                    Then I need you to collect some 
                    fresh herbs and deliver this to 
                    Morgana.  
                          (he passes him a phial)

      MERLIN looks at it.

                                  GAIUS
                    It s a sleeping draught. The poor 
                    girl s having nightmares.

                                  MERLIN
                    I know the feeling.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      MERLIN makes his way through the castle... 

      Finally he arrives at MORGANA's chambers.  The door is ajar.  
      He knocks, there's no answer.  He pushes the door open, steps 
      into the anteroom ...  

                                                                            CUT TO:


4747

      As he enters the inner chamber he sees MORGANA trying out a 
      dress in the mirror. MERLIN s heart skips a beat, spellbound 
      by her sheer beauty. She is about the same age as MERLIN, but 
      her obvious sophistication makes her seem slightly older.

      MORGANA S so intent on her own reflection that she doesn t 
      notice MERLIN staring, slack-jawed, right behind her. 

      Before he can say anything, she slips behind a screen and 
      starts to change.

                                    MORGANA (O.S.)
                    You know I ve been thinking about 
                    Arthur...

      MERLIN s captivated by her silhouette...

                                    MORGANA
                      I wouldn t touch him with a lance 
                    pole.  Pass me that dress, will 
                    you?

      MERLIN knows he can't afford to get into trouble - but knows 
      if he lets on he's there, MORGANA will think he's been spying 
      on her.  He sees the dress on the far side of the room, he 
      quickly throws it onto the top of the screen ... 

                                    MORGANA
                    I mean the man is a total jouster - 
                    Just because I m the king s ward 
                    ... 

      MERLIN tries to tiptoe away ...

                                    MORGANA
                    That doesn t mean I have to 
                    accompany him to the dance, does 
                    it?  

      She doesn t get a reply ...

                                    MORGANA
                    Well, does it?

      MERLIN stops and is forced to respond...

                                  MERLIN
                          (high pitched)
                    Un-uh.

                                    MORGANA
                    If he wants me to, then he should 
                    invite me.  And he hasn t.  So 
                    d you know what that means?

                                  MERLIN
                          (high pitched)
                    Un-uh.

                                    MORGANA
                    Where are you?

      Just as she looks up over the top of the screen, MERLIN 
      dashes to hide beneath it ...

                                  MERLIN
                          (high pitched)
                    Here.

                                    MORGANA
                    It means I m going by myself.


      MERLIN looks toward the open door, there s no chance of him 
      reaching it ...

                                    MORGANA
                    I need some help with the 
                      fastening.

      On MERLIN s face...

                                    MORGANA
                    Gwen?

                                  GWEN (O.S.)
                    I m here.

      A startled MERLIN looks up to see GWEN.  She presses her 
      finger to her lips, takes the potion from MERLIN and deftly 
      slides behind the screen to help her mistress. MORGANA's none 
      the wiser ... 

                                    MORGANA
                    So, it s whether I wear this little 
                    tease ... 

      GWEN turns MORGANA away and gives MERLIN a smile.  A relieved 
      MERLIN quickly scarpers...

                                    MORGANA
                    Or I hit them with something a 
                    little more ... Medieval.

      She twirls round holding a fabulous jewel encrusted black 
      number tight to her body.  GWEN just stares at her in awe. 

                                                                            CUT TO:

      An impatient GAIUS has his best robes on and is dressed and 
      ready to go to the party. MERLIN strolls in, he s still 
      preoccupied with what happened by the river.  

                                  GAIUS
                    Where ve you been?  I need you to 
                    get ready for the banquet.  I ve 
                    got you a job serving, remember.

                                  MERLIN
                    Alright.

      He heads for his room, then turns ...

                                  GAIUS
                    Don t stand there. Get changed.

                                  MERLIN
                    I ve just seen Dame Helen.  You 
                    don t think ...

                                  GAIUS
                    What?

                                  MERLIN
                          (thinking better of it)
                    No.

      He enters his room, still not hurrying, he picks up a fresh 
      tunic ...

                                  GAIUS
                    Will you please hurry up.

                                  MERLIN
                    You don t think there s something 
                    strange about her?

                                  GAIUS
                    Stop thinking and get yourself out 
                    of the door.

      He leaves.  A beat, and then MERLIN follows.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      A grand setting, lavish furnishings on a long rectangular 
      table. It s clear we re a long way from the Round Table of 
      Arthurian legend. 

      MERLIN and GAIUS come in and MERLIN sees the Prince messing 
      around with his mates - it s the first time he s set eyes on 
      ARTHUR since learning his destiny.  It can t really be his 
      fate to protect this man!  The group are larking around and 
      we can see MERLIN s disdain ...

      Suddenly, ARTHUR and his group stop in their tracks ...

                                  ARTHUR
                    God have mercy!

      MERLIN turns to see what they are looking at ...

      It s the arrival of MORGANA, she looks stunning - she smiles, 
      fully aware that the prince is staring at her..  

      MERLIN is dumbfounded, slack-jawed ...  

                                  GAIUS (O.S.)

      MERLIN can hardly turn his eyes away to look at GAIUS.

                                  GAIUS
                    Remember - you re here to work. 

      MERLIN picks up a tray of drinks, but he can t take his eyes 
      off MORGANA.  He doesn t notice GWEN smiling at him...

                                  GWEN
                    She looks great, doesn t she?

                                  MERLIN
                    Yeah.  

                                  GWEN
                    Some people are just born to be 
                    queen.

                                  MERLIN
                            (devastated)
                    No?

                                  GWEN
                    I hope so.  One day.

      MERLIN looks at her.

                                  GWEN
                    Not that I d want to be her - who d 
                    want to marry Arthur?


      She starts handing out drinks.

                                  MERLIN
                          (a smile)
                    Oh, come on, Gwen, I thought you 
                    liked those  real rough tough save 
                    the world kind of men .

                                  GWEN
                    No, I like much more ordinary men, 
                    like you. 

                                  MERLIN
                    Gwen, believe me, I am not 
                    ordinary.

                                  GWEN
                          (flustered)
                    I didn t mean you!  Obviously, not 
                    you.  But just, you know, I like 
                    very ordinary men, like you. 

                                  MERLIN
                    Thanks.

      ARTHUR and MORGANA take their seats opposite one another.  
      They smile...

                                  ARTHUR
                          (lying)
                    Oh, I didn t see you arrive, 
                    Morgana.

                                    MORGANA
                    Oh, and I didn t notice you were 
                    here or I would ve come over, 
                    Arthur.

                                  ARTHUR
                    I ve got to say - that is an 
                      absolutely gorgeous dress.  

      MORGANA looks at him ...

                                  ARTHUR
                    Have you seen it?  The woman just 
                    behind you, she looks fantastic.

                                    MORGANA
                          (smiling)
                    Yes, I saw her earlier, she was 
                    with that really handsome man.  

                                  ARTHUR
                    Not your type.

                                    MORGANA
                    You don t know my type.

                                  ARTHUR
                    Yes, I do.  The ones you have to 
                    chase.

                                    MORGANA
                          (she picks up a chicken 
                            drumstick)
                    No, I like the ones who have to 
                    beg.

      She looks down at a large hound sitting eagerly hoping for 
      some scraps.  She teases it with the drumstick and then 
      delights in stuffing the chicken leg in her mouth.  The dog 
      tilts its head and whimpers.

                                                                            CUT TO:

      Music as MERLIN and GWEN clear the pewter plates from the top 
      table.  MERLIN has the humiliating task of removing ARTHUR s 
      dirty platter.  ARTHUR sees him and deliberately makes MERLIN 
      wait while he savours his last few bites of food.  

      We see MERLIN s face...

      The music is interrupted as the MASTER OF CEREMONIES takes to 
      the floor ..

                                  MASTER OF CEREMONIES
                    Your Royal Highness, my Lords, 
                    Ladies and Gentlemen.  Here she is, 
                    the one and only Dame Helen of Mora 
                    ...

      Applause.  UTHER smiles, adoringly.  DAME HELEN appears and 
      waves to the crowd. MERLIN turns to watch.


                                  DAME HELEN
                    Thank you for your kind 
                      introduction.  I d like to start 
                    with something a little bit 
                      different...

      The DIVA starts to sing. ARTHUR and the rest of the audience 
      are instantly gripped by her voice. The hauntingly beautiful 
      notes drift through the torch-lit hall. 

      As the music grows louder, the room starts to decay before 
      our very eyes. The colour drains from the faces of the 
      banqueters, cobwebs start to weave over the arms and legs of 
      the guests as the fruit on the tables starts to rot (think 
      David Attenborough on the forest floor). 

      As the watchers are gripped by the paralysing decreptitude, 
      DAME HELEN begins to stride towards her target: ARTHUR.

      The decay creeps across the room, overtaking all in it s 
      path. As cobwebs start to creep up MERLIN s legs, he realises 
      what is happening... He stuffs his fingers in his ears, 
      trying to block out the enchanted song.

      Still singing, DAME HELEN advances on a defenceless ARTHUR, 
      who stares glassy-eyed ahead, white as a ghost.

      But one thing in the huge room still stirs. MERLIN still has 
      his fingers in his ears and hasn t succumbed to the 
        enchantment. As DAME HELEN passes he glimpses her reflection 
      in a silver chalice. The grotesque face of MARY COLLINS 
      stares back at him. MERLIN closes his eyes, he doesn t want 
      her to see that he s still awake. 

      High above the hall a giant wooden chandelier holds a ring of 
      burning candles.

      MERLIN S eyes flash open and suddenly we re in MERLIN TIME - 
      one of the flickering flames starts to bend as if blown by an 
      invisible wind. It blows the flame closer and closer to the 
      rope that holds the chandelier. 

      DAME HELEN has nearly reached ARTHUR. She puts her hand in 
      her robes and pulls out an evil-looking knife.

      MERLIN stares at the chandelier. We can hear his heart 
      beating. The rope starts to smoulder. Then it bursts into 
      flames.

      The DIVA is about to plunge the dagger into ARTHUR S heart...

      The rope breaks and the chandelier starts to fall - in 
      agonising MERLIN TIME - towards the DIVA below...

      Just before she delivers the fatal blow, the chandelier slams 
      into DAME HELEN, knocking the knife from her hand and pinning 
      her to the ground. 


      The instant the singing stops, the creeping decay is 
      reversed. The cobwebs retreat, the fruit becomes fresh once 
      again and the people s faces return to vibrant life. 

      UTHER S one of the first to regain his senses, he sweeps away 
      the cobwebs ...

                                  UTHER
                          (he sees the giant 
                            chandelier and the DIVA S 
                            crumpled body)
                    In God s name, what s happened 
                    here?

      Cautiously ARTHUR steps forward. He lifts DAME HELEN S cloak, 
      then starts back in horror as he sees MARY COLLINS  hideous 
      face. 

      Suddenly, MARY COLLINS eyes flash open. With her last breath 
      she mutters a final spell. 

      We see a statue behind ARTHUR start to topple...

      MERLIN reacts instinctively - his eyes flare and we re in 
      MERLIN TIME. As the statue plummets towards ARTHUR, MERLIN 
      leaps on him, bringing him to the ground just as the statue 
      crashes down, missing them by millimetres. 

      The CROWD cheer MERLIN for pushing ARTHUR out of harm's way. 

      Amongst the cheering crowd we see UTHER.  He s clearly 
      shocked by the turn of events and DAME HELEN s metamorphosis.  
      MORGANA turns to him ...

                                    MORGANA
                          (whispers)
                    I warned you...

      UTHER looks at her ...

      ARTHUR and MERLIN get up from the floor together.  Both men 
      equally shocked by what s happened.

                                    MORGANA
                    He saved Arthur s life. A debt must 
                    be repaid. 

      She looks at UTHER...

                                  MERLIN
                          (delighted - but trying to 
                            appear modest)
                    No, honestly...you don t have to 
                    your highness. 

                                    MORGANA
                    Oh, absolutely, this merits 
                    something quite special. 

                                  MERLIN
                          (conceding)
                    Well...

                                  UTHER
                          (snapping, angry)
                    Yes, you will be rewarded with a 
                    job for life. 

      MERLIN looks delighted.

                                  UTHER
                    The job of Arthur s manservant. 

      The crowd cheer. MERLIN's face falls. So does ARTHUR's.  

                                  ARTHUR
                          (complaining)
                    Father!

                                  UTHER
                          (lashing out at Arthur)
                    At least he can recognise a witch 
                    when he sees one.

      UTHER stalks out of the hall. MERLIN and ARTHUR look gutted. 
      Only THOMAS, ARTHUR's former man servant, looks delighted - 
      he gives MERLIN a big thumbs up. 

                                  THOMAS
                    Nice one, bruv. 

      All MERLIN can manage is a weak smile.

                                                                            CUT TO:

5151

        A bewildered MERLIN alone in his room - reflecting on 
      everything that s happened.  There's a knock at the door.  
      MERLIN looks up as GAIUS enters.

                                  GAIUS
                    Seems you re a hero.

                                  MERLIN
                    Hard to believe, isn t it.

                                  GAIUS
                    No.
                          (a beat)
                    I knew it from the moment I met you 
                    ...

                                  MERLIN
                    Yeah, right.

                                  GAIUS
                    You saved my life, remember.

                                  MERLIN
                    But... that was magic.

                                  GAIUS
                          (he smiles)
                    And now it seems we ve finally 
                    found a use for it.

                                  MERLIN
                    What d you mean?

                                  GAIUS
                    I saw how you saved Arthur s life.

                                  MERLIN
                    No.

                                  GAIUS
                    Perhaps that s its purpose.

                                  MERLIN
                    Please, I hope not.

      GAIUS hands him a small parcel ...

                                  GAIUS
                    There you go.

      He turns and leaves.

      Intrigued, MERLIN opens the cover. It's a book. He opens the 
      covers, the pages are filled with incantations and ancient 
      runes. MERLIN stares at it in astonishment, then gets up from 
      his bed and crosses to the door.  

      GAIUS looks up from his work - the hint of smile on his face.

                                  GAIUS
                    I was given that book at your age, 
                    but I've a feeling it will be more 
                    use to you than it was to me.

                                  MERLIN
                            (gratefully)
                    I will study every word.

      There's a loud knock at the door and we hear a GUARD s gruff 
      voice...

                                  GUARD (V.O.)
                    Merlin!  The Prince wants you right 
                    away!

      GAIUS smiles at MERLIN.

                                  GAIUS
                    I'm not sure you'll have the time.
