L.A. AIRPORT.
AFTERNOON.
WILSON steps out into the late sunlight and the heat of the
day.
A slow-motion moment while he gets acclimatized.
He
wouldn't have ever felt quite this kind of heat before.
After such a rigorously air-conditioned interior.
Or seen
cops wearing guns on their belts.
Or black cops, for that
matter, with guns on their belts.
Or seen people as fat as
Americans on their home turf.
Things someone from England
notices immediately, whether consciously at first or not.
CUT.
EVENING.
Wilson's not here for comfort.
Shown to a shitty room, round
the corner of a typical 2nd-level outside walkway.
Airport
close by.
NIGHT.
Wilson walks up a cracked little path to the front door.
Lower middle-class street.
Two cars in the driveway, one
behind the other.
Lights on inside the house -- as he rings
the bell.
ED RAMA
Answers it.
Hispanic.
Late 30's.
Chairman Mao on his T-
shirt notwithstanding, an easygoing sort of fellow.
Not
looking for any trouble -- anymore.
But once did, and able
to handle himself if any shows up.
Which it has.
WILSON
Edward Rama?
ED
Eduardo.
(rolling the R)
Rama.
WILSON
You're home, then.
He turns, waves away the taxi he's kept waiting.
While
Eduardo Rama waits for an introduction.
WILSON
My name's Wilson.
Accent speaks for itself.
Hard, working-class.
ED
Wilson?
Knows the name.
But just now it's unexpected.
He's holding
a hot TV dinner, hand protected by a dish towel.
WILSON
You wrote to me about my daughter.
CUT.
NIGHT.
They sit at an outdoor table.
Wilson with a TV dinner in
front of him now too.
Sounds from inside MUTED.
Even this
little house has a little pool.
WILSON
Who done it, then?
ED
Huh?
WILSON
Snuffed her.
Ed surprised at Wilson's directness.
Ed stands nervously.
ED
Now, wait up a second, man.
And paces back and forth.
ED
I never said nothin' about nothin' like
that.
No, no, no.
That's not what I
wrote to you.
WILSON
No, but between the lines, eh?
Mysterious circumstances, and that.
Ed stops pacing.
ED
Look, I sent you that newspaper clipping,
all right?
I told you what I know.
It
was an accident.
I didn't say anything
about anybody being "snuffed."
Beat.
WILSON
This bloke she was bunked up with.
This
Terry what'sit.
ED
Terry Valentine.
WILSON
Valentine.
What's he got to say for
himself?
ED
I dunno.
What's he gonna say?
They had
a fight that night, she drove away, she
was upset?
I don't even know the guy.
Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were
friends, but we didn't travel in the same
social circles.
She had her life, I had
mine.
Makes a kind of scoffing gesture:
and you can see what my
life is.
ED
Valentine came into the restaurant where
I work with Jenny a couple times.
He's a
money guy.
Jenny would say, hey, here's
my friend Eddie and he would shake my
hand and everything, but he wouldn't even
see me, you know what I mean.
Wilson gazes up at the sky.
Clear night.
Stars.
WILSON
How long had she been in the States?
(as if to himself, somewhat
wistful)
Near on ten years, wasn't it?
Long
enough to know her way about, I reckon.
Ed leans down, palms on the tabletop, facing Wilson.
ED
There was an investigation, okay?
The
car was totalled.
Jennifer was ... Her
neck was broken.
On impact, they said.
So she wouldn't have ... felt the effects
of the fire.
(helpless shrug)
It happens up there.
Happens a lot.
What more can I tell you.
Wilson taps out a cigarette from a pack of "Silk Cut" he's
produced from his pocket.
WILSON
What more is there.
ED
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep
hillside.
There was no moon that
night ...
Wilson's quiet stillness is getting to him.
ED
Coulda happened to anyone, man.
I never
knew her to be reckless.
I mean, sure,
she would smoke a little grass, or
something, have a few drinks.
But that's
it, nothing more than that.
WILSON
No, not my girl.
Self-control, she had.
Point of pride.
(smokes)
And people don't change, do they.
ED
I dunno ... Maybe they do.
Wilson notes the tattoos on Ed's forearms.
WILSON
Going straight, are ya.
Ed looks at him.
Sits down again.
Keeping his forearms under
the table.
ED
(looks away)
Boomerang.
WILSON
Y'what?
ED
I knew when I was droppin' that letter
into the mail slot it was gonna come back
and smack me in the face.
(looks at Wilson again)
I did my time, okay?
My sister, her ol'
man's up in Chino right now doin' eight
years.
WILSON
(re the family inside)
This ain't your lot?
ED
You kiddin', man?
I don't need a wife
and screamin' kids.
I still got my
youth.
And yet -- he lives here.
Wilson declines to pursue the
matter.
ED
I go to work, try to keep my life
together, put all that shit behind me,
man.
What d'you want from me.
WILSON
(calmly smoking)
I only asked.
Ed sighs.
Reaches for one of Wilson's cigarettes.
ED
Couple weeks before she died, Jennifer
asked me to drive her downtown.
Said she
was meeting -- her boyfriend --
Valentine.
But I think she was looking
for him.
FLASH CUTS:
ED AND JENNIFER. In a car, downtown. She has the same steely
intensity as her father. Ed looks a little worried.
WILSON
(lighting Ed's cigarette)
What, tryin' to catch him with another
bird?
ED
That's what I thought, man.
But it was
not a hotel or nothin' that we went to.
It was someplace else.
WILSON
Where abouts?
FLASH CUTS:
JENNIFER. Talking to a beefy SUPERVISOR. Or talking at him.
Either way, he isn't happy.
MEAT PUPPETS. Watch instead of working.
ED. Taking all this in.
ED
Bad place, man.
Bad people.
Some guys
loading some trucks.
Some kinda deal
goin' down.
(anticipating Wilson's next
question)
I don't know and I don't care.
Maybe
they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
WILSON
Did Jenny know?
ED
(shrugs)
Valentine wasn't even there.
If he was
into something, if she was involved --
who can say.
(stands up again)
But I'll tell you something.
She stood
in front of these dudes, man.
Eyeballing
them.
Checking them out.
(beat)
I felt like she was covering my ass that
day.
Unconsciously rubbing his arms where his tattoos are.
ED
I drove her back to Valentine's house.
FLASH CUT:
VALENTINE. Standing in front of his house. His expression
says: We have something to discuss.
ED
He was standing outside waiting for her.
That's the only other time I ever saw
him.
(a short sad note)
Last time I saw her.
He meets Wilson's gaze.
As hard and pointed as a drill
through his skull.
CUT.
NIGHT.
Wilson out of the car, shuts the passenger door.
Ed on the
other side, looks over the roof at him.
ED
Go home, man.
(plane taking off in
background)
Get on a plane.
Wilson has other plans.
WILSON
I'll be needing a shooter.
Makes his fingers like a gun.
And a clicking sound.
ED
(comes quickly over)
You're kiddin' me, right?
WILSON
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin'
Yellow Pages?
ED
(an urgent whisper)
These are not guys you can just go run a
number on, man.
WILSON
(looking around)
Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing
machines, you know.
Bung in your coins,
come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded.
Ed throws up his hands, walks back to his driver's side door.
ED
Are you a resident of California?
You gonna fill out forms, man?
Do the
background check?
Go through a three-day
waiting period?
WILSON
Sod that.
Gotta get back before my
probation officer wonders where I've
skived off to.
ED
Probation?
Man, you crazy.
They
shouldn't've let you outta your country,
much less prison.
WILSON
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
Walks round to come face to face with Ed once more.
WILSON
Which is why I thought, save some time,
get what I need under the table, like.
ED
As if resigned and mulling the problem over:
ED
Under the table?
CUT.
DAY.
Wilson makes a sudden lane change to avoid getting fed in the
wrong direction.
Gets HONKED by another driver.
DAY.
Wilson cruises past a particular building.
We don't have to
really clearly see it just yet (we saw it in the flash cuts) --
more important we see him seeing it.
Casing it with the eyes
of a professional.
Sniffing it out; the instinct of a
predator after prey.
DAY.
Wilson locks the car.
Walks away.
STAY with him.
AROUND THE CORNER
He walks down the block.
A nice long walk.
What we get out
of it besides a sense of Wilson -- cool cat; ambling along;
loner; sun beating down; not bothered; his shadow doubling
him -- is this:
The building approaching.
The one he has his eye on.
The
target.
It's across the street.
A kind of flat windowless
warehouse with adjoining loading yard.
Loading yard
surrounded by a chain-link fence -- topped with barbed wire.
The actual geography of where he left his car in relation to
this building.
Safely around the corner.
And how he might
practically get back to it, either this same way or via a
more circuitous route round another block.
The sense you get in downtown L.A. on a lazy Saturday
afternoon that you're in a ghost town.
Particularly in this
shabby kind of industrial section.
Wilson crosses over to it now.
From sunny to shade.
Walks past the chain-link fence.
The padlocked gate, big
enough to accommodate the (couple of) trucks parked within
the compound.
Walks past the closed security door which would appear to be
the building's main entrance.
Round the next corner -- SEES there's a steel back door as
well.
Comes around this block again.
Looking surreptitiously around
now.
Streets here utterly deserted.
Not even a passing car.
Crappy residential building on an opposite corner, SPANISH
MUSIC blaring from one of the open windows, but not with a
direct view on the loading yard fence on this side.
Wilson
nearing it now -- taking something out of his pocket.
One of
the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit.
Snaps his
wrist, unfolding the tool with a CRACK.
Wire cutters.
He doesn't go for the gate, the padlock, like we might have
thought.
He suddenly drops to one knee, in shadow where the
fence meets the adjoining building.
SNAP, SNAP, SNAP, SNAP,
SNAP -- so quick, with great dexterity, though his face
grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each
application of pressure -- he cuts just as many links as he
knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll
under.
Whole thing accomplished in seconds.
LOADING YARD
Walks fast to the cover of the trucks.
Passes.
Looks
around.
Cement loading docks and bays.
Shuttered doors.
He
jumps up to one, puts his ear to the metal.
Listens awhile.
WILSON
Scans the wall for any sign of an alarm box or anything.
Then cocks an ear upwards... CAMERA CRANING UP to show us
what he hears:
an air-conditioning unit HUMMING away.
Which
means someone must be inside.
Wilson looks back at his entry options.
Not the loading
doors -- but a conventional door at one end, with a
conventional lock his eye zeroes in on.
Gets out his tools,
going over.
DAY.
Wilson is taken outside and dumped.
After a moment, he gets
to his feet.
Dusting himself.
Reaches for ANOTHER GUN tucked
in his lower back.
He re-enters the building.
A beat.
We hear several SHOTS.
Seconds later, one of the Meat Puppets comes stumbling out of
the door, terrified.
He runs past us, fast.
A moment later, Wilson emerges, gun in hand.
WILSON
You tell him.
You tell him I'm coming!!
CUT.
DUSK.
A series of images that prove Valentine (whoever he is) has
taste, wealth, and influence, stretching back a good three
decades at least.
Walking through some of these shots is a young beauty in a
bathing suit named ADHARA.
She advances slowly, not entirely
sure of herself, and stops to look at things just like we do.
At one point she looks to see a BEEFY GUY (GORDON) sitting at
the kitchen counter, flipping through a magazine.
He looks
her up and down, more from reflex than anything.
She continues on.
Eventually she emerges through sliding
glass doors and on to a patio.
HER POV
A figure by the pool, talking on the phone.
His back to us.
The pool is spectacular, mosaic tile bottomed.
ADHARA
Approaches, then sits beside him.
His voice is soothing, but
with the tiniest hint of exasperation that comes with being
slightly ahead of everyone.
VALENTINE
(into phone)
Not before.
Not before.
Think about it.
What does it mean?
What -- no, I'm not.
Think.
Yes.
See?
You figured it out
all by yourself.
I know.
Are we done?
Okay.
He hangs up, stands, still doesn't turn.
VALENTINE
Adhara.
I told your father, if you're
looking for a name, you can't go wrong
with a constellation.
ADHARA
I used to hate it.
Now I like it.
VALENTINE
Could be worse, he could've named you
Reticulum.
He turns and we see him for the first time.
VALENTINE
Polished.
Handsome.
Charismatic.
Especially when he's
smiling like he is now.
He leans over and kisses her.
VALENTINE
Is there anything in the world that you
want or need?
ADHARA
I want to know why you need that scary
guy in your house.
VALENTINE
Gordon?
He's been with me for years.
He's not as tough as he looks.
ADHARA
Then what good is he?
VALENTINE
Is it possible that you're too young to
be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
ADHARA
Is that a problem?
VALENTINE
Not for you, clearly.
ADHARA
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
VALENTINE
Am I a thing?
ADHARA
Well, you're certainly not a person.
VALENTINE
I'm not.
ADHARA
No.
You're not specific enough to be a
person.
You're more like a vibe.
VALENTINE
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
ADHARA
It's not a knock.
VALENTINE
It's not a compliment.
ADHARA
It's an observation.
Like:
I'm hungry.
When are we eating?
VALENTINE
As soon as you get dressed.
ADHARA
What kind of food?
VALENTINE
Anything but Japanese.
ADHARA
Why?
VALENTINE
I'm not into finger foods.
Too fussy.
ADHARA
Like you.
VALENTINE
I don't like do-it-yourself cuisine.
Buffets.
Salad bars.
ADHARA
You demand to be served.
A fork
fetishist.
VALENTINE
It's just fuel to me.
I'm not there for
distractions.
ADHARA
For some, eating is a sensual experience.
The sensual experience.
VALENTINE
That's what Gordon's always saying.
ADHARA
Oh, god.
His cell phone rings.
VALENTINE
(into phone)
Yes.
He listens, then looks up at his balcony, where a MAN (AVERY)
stands holding a phone, obviously talking to Valentine.
VALENTINE
(into phone)
I'll be there as soon as I can.
He hangs up.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
We can leave as soon as you're ready.
ADHARA
Okay.
EVENING.
Valentine approaches Avery.
VALENTINE
What.
AVERY
There's been some trouble downtown.
VALENTINE
What kind?
AVERY
What the papers used to call a "gangland
slaying."
VALENTINE
Our black friends?
AVERY
No, Terry.
They don't work like that.
Jenny Wilson's father paid a little
visit, left a message.
VALENTINE
I thought he was in prison, in England.
AVERY
Well, either they have a very liberal
work-release program, or he's out,
because he's here in L.A., looking for
you.
Valentine is a little ruffled.
Maybe Avery likes that.
VALENTINE
What do we do?
Beat.
AVERY
We wait, and we watch.
Valentine just looks at him.
POOLSIDE.
EVENING.
Adhara approaches Valentine, who stands staring at the pool.
ADHARA
Italian?
VALENTINE
I'm sorry.
ADHARA
Italian.
VALENTINE
Who?
ADHARA
Not who, food.
Should we get Italian.
VALENTINE
Sure.
Turns to her.
VALENTINE (cont'd)
Yes.
Are you ready?
ADHARA
As long as I don't have to pass Gordon
again.
I'm never ready for that.
He smiles, rises, and offers her his hand.
VALENTINE
No.
I know another way out.
She takes it.
CUT.
EVENING.
ELAINE on her way in.
Handsome woman.
Intelligent, capable-
looking.
Passes Wilson who's leaning somewhere smoking.
ELAINE
Aware as a wary woman will be of a strange man's presence
without necessarily having looked at him.
Well aware too
that he stayed where he was -- so she unworriedly unlocks the
building's security gate and goes through to the inner --
COURTYARD
-- and closes the gate behind her, now seeing him amble up,
arriving as it CLICKS shut between them.
He's looking at her
a certain way.
She looks back.
And knows.
ELAINE
You're Jenny's father.
And the recognition on his part:
WILSON
Had a feeling it was you.
ELAINE
You look alike.
WILSON
(cigarette in hand)
Perhaps it was the smoke.
ELAINE
Not her brand.
WILSON
She used to pinch 'em off me.
(trying to defuse Elaine's cold
stare)
Funny that.
One thing she never tried to
get me to stop.
Elaine doesn't soften.
ELAINE
Why did you come here?
WILSON
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
ELAINE
No, why did you come here?
America.
WILSON
Sort a few things out.
ELAINE
Been busy, have you.
WILSON
How d'you mean?
ELAINE
It's been a while.
WILSON
I was skint -- didn't have no money to
get here.
ELAINE
That's not what I heard.
WILSON
What was that, then?
ELAINE
I heard you were -- what's that adorable
phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
WILSON
It was the bars, then.
Indicating his face, viewed by Elaine through the barred
security gate that divides them.
ELAINE
In any case, I don't suppose the salary
you make sewing mailbags is really
commensurate with international airline
travel.
WILSON
Sewing mailbags?
Me?
Never did an
honest day's work in my life, dear.
Wasn't about to start when I was in stir --
not with all that leisure time on my
hands.
ELAINE
And not with all that buried loot you had
waiting for you when you got out.
From
the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?
Pink
Floyd concert receipts.
Jenny would've
been ... fourteen at the time?
WILSON
(trying to conceal his
surprise)
Hardly buried.
Earning interest, love.
Earning interest in an offshore account.
Tidy little premium per annum, that.
ELAINE
Well, that kind of security can't be
bought.
Must be more comforting than a
daughter to greet you.
She turns to walk away.
WILSON
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
ELAINE
(without looking back)
Try calling me again.
EVENING.
Wilson gives up, starts to walk away.
The gate BUZZES.
NIGHT.
They walk along the seafront.
We HEAR the ocean but can't
see it.
ELAINE
When did you get in?
WILSON
Yesterday.
Afternoon.
ELAINE
(occurs to her)
You haven't been lurking outside my
building all day.
WILSON
No, I had -- some other matters to attend
to, you know.
Getting a car sorted ...
ELAINE
I might've been away for the weekend.
WILSON
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you
were goin' out, you'd probably have to
come home first.
ELAINE
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
WILSON
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.
Me and him are
muckers.
Mates.
Friends.
Makes a kind of bonding gesture.
ELAINE
I should really give him a call.
He's a
character, isn't he.
Well, not to you.
I meant to us squares in the outside
world.
WILSON
He give me your address.
ELAINE
I gave him yours.
Said, here, you want
to write, I think this is a relative.
I
guess I thought I was being true to
Jenny.
Who told me she didn't have a
father -- before proceeding of course to
tell me why.
WILSON
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most
of her life.
On her own after her mum
died.
Aunts and uncles for a time -- and
then the bright lights beckoned.
ELAINE
Were you still married at the time -- to
Jenny's mother, I mean?
WILSON
Nah, we split up when Jenny was six.
Her
second husband done a runner after she
got sick.
They give me compassionate
leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in
hospital.
We were always mates, me and
Jenny's mum.
I like to think they're
together again now.
Y'know.
Heavenly
choir.
Beat.
ELAINE
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a
prison, was it?
WILSON
Nah, accommodation address.
ELAINE
What's that, like a P.O. box.
WILSON
Something like that, yeah.
ELAINE
Where you get your bank statements.
Wilson gives a laugh.
WILSON
Well, you gotta have something permanent,
don'tcha.
Even if it's a hole in the
wall.
No matter which jug I might be
transferred to, I always got someone on
the out checks up on it for me, see.
Anything I need to know, comes round on
visitor's day -- word in my ear.
Elaine pauses.
ELAINE
Some word.
Wilson leans on the wall overlooking the black ocean.
Sound
of WAVES gently lapping the beach.
WILSON
I already knew.
Knew beforehand.
When
was it supposed to have happened? -- two
o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
ELAINE
(watching him)
That's what was estimated.
WILSON
Eight hours difference between here and
London.
Would've been, what, ten in the
morning, my time.
I was just coming out
on the yard.
Now, I was in the habit of
saving my newspaper till then.
Bit of
fresh air, stretch me legs -- well,
stretch the day out, really, that's what
you wanna do.
And I'll tell ya:
I
couldn't open the paper.
Could not pry
the pages apart -- it was like they was
glued together.
That's how weak my hands
went.
Thought I was having heart attack,
only I knew I wasn't.
Bloke come up to
me, he says, Dave, he says, you've gone
all white.
I said, fuck me, I've been in
prison half my life, what d'ya expect.
But he was dead on, 'cause I could feel
the blood drain right out of me head.
And I knew ...
(beat)
Something had happened to Jen.
They stand here a while.
Listening to the BREAKERS hit the
shore.
CUT.
UNDERBRUSH.
LATE AFTERNOON.
Thickets part and we SEE Wilson scrambling up a rather steep
hill.
Coming to a ridge where he settles down to look at
something O.S.
His expression changes by degrees from
curiosity to dawning realization to a kind of frustrated
disappointment.
LATE AFTERNOON.
Wilson settles into position again, this time with Ed.
WILSON
Look at that.
Ed just laughs.
WILSON
What's so fucking funny?
ED
Those aren't guards.
They're valets.
POV
Now we SEE what Wilson had mistaken for Valentine's private
army.
Half a dozen VALETS outside Valentine's hilltop home.
Dressed in matching attire, a couple of them wielding walkie-
talkies.
RESUME WILSON AND ED
Ed's still laughing.
WILSON
Valets.
What d'ya mean valets.
What is
he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
ED
Valets.
They park cars.
He's having a
party.
CUT.
LATE AFTERNOON.
Wilson's car pulls up.
He and Ed get out.
Wilson engages in
a mini tug-of-war with a Valet over his car key, it so rubs
him the wrong way having to give it up.
WILSON
Keep it handy, mate, all right?
We're
not stopping long.
He gestures, apparently getting the message across that he
wants the car kept close by.
VALET
Yes, sir.
WILSON
Cheers.
Exchanges the key for a card -- which he turns over in his
hand and studies curiously as they head inside.
WILSON
Valets, eh?
Aren't we all la-de-da.
ED
(nervous being here)
I thought you just wanted to check out
the house, man.
WILSON
Well, that's what we're doin', n' it.
ED
No one else is even here yet.
WILSON
First in, first out, that's me.
Looking over to note the multi-car GARAGE off the main house.
AFTERNOON.
Wilson and Ed walk briskly along the path.
WILSON
(gives Ed parking ticket)
Bring the motor around.
Bang out in
front, right?
ED
You goin' back inside?
WILSON
One thing I need.
AFTERNOON.
Ed hands the ticket to a Valet.
He exchanges looks with a
couple of the other Valets.
Wilson SEES Gordon approaching.
Gets ready to greet him.
Removes cigarette from mouth, drops it to floor of deck,
presses it out under his shoe.
Limbers up his shoulders in a
subtle way.
Gordon coming towards him.
As if to challenge Wilson's
legitimacy as an invited guest.
Closer.
About to speak.
But Wilson doesn't even give him a chance to do that.
In
quick succession:
Wilson HEAD BUTTS Gordon, splintering his
nose; KNEES him in the groin; then, using the knee for
leverage, grabs Gordon by the lapels -- and heaves him over
the railing!
It happened so fast that if anyone else is nearby they
probably didn't even notice -- or didn't readily grasp what
they saw.
Valentine pushes through to look over the railing.
HIS POV
Gordon -- a crumpled, inert heap way down the hill below.
VALENTINE
Turns to look toward the front door.
Wilson not to be seen.
Valentine pushes through the crowd toward the door.
AFTERNOON.
Valentine emerges in time to see Ed and Wilson pulling away.
Wilson looks at him, impassive, through the passenger window.
AVERY
Is just arriving in his car.
Valentine gestures at him.
Suddenly we HEAR a loud, bass-heavy WHHUUUMMMPPP.
Valentine (and a few others) turn toward the sound, which
came from:
THE GARAGE
There is smoke coming from under the door.
AFTERNOON.
Wilson's car practically tobogganing back down the hill.
BOOM!
We hear an explosion from back UP the hill.
An especially sharp curve looms ahead.
WILSON
Flinches, grabs a handhold.
CURVE
Car makes it around on two side wheels.
WILSON
Gulps.
WILSON
Bloody hell.
Ed regains control.
AVERY
In his car, takes a different turn.
CAR.
Swerves some more curves.
Should be some sense here that a
similar skyline route would have been taken by Wilson's
daughter on her final drive.
Wilson's car SKIDS into a spin from the impact.
THE OTHER CAR
It's Avery.
Chased them via a shortcut down the mountain.
Now jumps out of his car, levels a shotgun at them and pumps
off a BLAST.
WILSON'S CAR
BAM! -- the trunk pops open as the car rights itself.
Avery
FIRES again, but the upended trunk is a kind of shield,
deflecting the shot.
Wilson reverses his car like a speeding tank:
SMASHING into
Avery's car.
Pushing it right off the edge of the road.
AVERY
Falls backwards to the ground as he gets the hell out of the
way.
WILSON
Jumps out of his car.
Gun drawn.
Advancing on Avery with it
pointed.
AVERY'S CAR
CRASHING through underbrush down the steep bank of the
hillside.
WILSON'S FACE
SOUND of the divebombing car OVER.
Another pointed echo of
his daughter's fate.
AVERY
Their eyes meet momentarily.
And before Wilson can shoot,
Avery rolls over the edge of the road himself.
ED
Calls frantically to Wilson from their car.
ED
C'mon, man!
C'mon!
SIRENS in the distance.
WILSON
That consuming rage overtaken him again for a second.
But
the exigencies of the moment snap him out of it.
WILSON
Turns on a dime, goes back to the car.
Before he's halfway
in, Ed's driving them away again.
Trunk at the back BANGING
up and down, up and down.
AVERY
Pulls himself back up to the road.
Brushing himself off.
Looking the way they went.
He gently tosses his shotgun down into some thick brush where
maybe he'll retrieve it later.
AFTERNOON.
Avery returns, sweating, walking back up the road to where
all the action is.
Party guests milling outside, waiting for
their cars so they can leave.
A fire truck, a police car.
SMOKE pouring out of Valentine's garage.
Valentine finishes talking to a couple of COPS.
Walks over to
Avery.
AVERY
You should have let me do the talking.
VALENTINE
Why, because you're my security
consultant?
(insecure)
This cocksucker nearly burnt my house
down.
AVERY
(more concerned about police
presence)
What did you tell them.
Valentine blows air, runs a hand through his hair.
VALENTINE
I told them a long-time employee flipped
out.
Had a drug problem, refused
counselling.
Set the garage on fire,
then committed suicide.
One of my
"guests" tried to stop him -- but how do
you stop Gordon.
In this context meaning how did that rangy Englishman do it.
VALENTINE
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four
hundred pounds.
AVERY
Heavier than that now.
But are there any
drugs in that stomach to back up your
story.
VALENTINE
As it happens.
I didn't make that part
up.
AVERY
And where is this guest?
Don't they want
to interview him.
VALENTINE
I don't know everyone here.
He was so
traumatized he split.
(another notion)
Maybe he was Gordon's pusher.
Avery stares at Valentine.
Impressed at him thinking on his
feet.
VALENTINE
Where do you think he is, Mike.
AVERY
(already turning)
We'll find him.
VALENTINE
(stops him)
No.
I mean.
Not even your people should
be involved.
Right?
It's too close now.
AVERY
You could use a few of my prime
shitkickers up here.
VALENTINE
You think I'm staying?
AVERY
There's already gonna be talk about how
people close to you keep falling into
canyons.
VALENTINE
Well, can we make it one more.
Nowhere
the fuck near me.
He's being glib, but he's being serious.
His open-handed
gesture inquiring of Avery:
are you up to the task?
AVERY
I have other resources.
He turns to go.
CANYON.
AFTERNOON.
The huge dead bulk of Gordon hoisted back up to the deck by a
paramedic team.
NIGHT.
Stacy, putting on a jacket that says "Bomb Hanoi" comes out
of the pool hall.
Uncle John in tow.
UNCLE JOHN
How much.
STACY
Five thousand.
UNCLE JOHN
(impressed)
Hey.
STACY
(taps pocket)
I got half.
UNCLE JOHN
Makin' trouble for someone?
STACY
Yeah.
UNCLE JOHN
Which kind?
STACY
The forever kind.
BEHIND THEM
Thompson, the mysterious black man, watches them from the
hall doorway.
CUT.
MORNING.
Early.
MORNING.
For the first time, we see the Pacific coastline.
Impressive.
And a sleek Italian sports car.
Heading north.
DAY.
Stacy and Uncle John sitting on a bench in a beach setting
(though we still don't see the ocean).
Or on some grass,
maybe, in a little park -- opposite Elaine's building.
People-watching.
In their own unique way.
Stacy commenting
on fellow humanity all around them.
TIME CUTS between each
comment:
STACY
(after laughing loudly at a
handicapped person)
I believe in mocking the afflicted.
Good
for 'em.
Makes 'em stronger.
Uncle John picks at the grass or sand.
As they kill the day.
STACY
(spotting a woman with a dog)
Ever take a look at the women who work in
pet stores?
Wow.
STACY
(as a fat jogger passes)
Good luck.
STACY
(watching someone else go by)
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
STACY
(barely out of earshot of a
black woman with dyed blonde
hair)
Very attractive.
Good idea.
Now I
really want to fuck you.
STACY
(after a long time in silence,
just staring at someone)
... you can always tell the ones who'll do
anal.
STACY
(regarding some other
beachgoers)
Kinda makes you wonder why more people
don't put a bullet through their fuckin'
skulls, doesn't it.
STACY
(reading a newspaper)
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick
out of his mouth.
STACY
(leaning back on his elbows)
Why don't they have TV shows about people
whose daily lives you'd be interested in
watching.
Y'know.
Like SKINNY LITTLE
WEAKLING.
Or BIG FAT GUY.
SICK OLD MAN.
FAMILY OF LOSERS.
Wouldn't that be good?
STACY
(sitting up)
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.
Who's
driving?
UNCLE JOHN
I don't know.
STACY
The L.A.P.D.
STACY
(observing a "fast-walker")
Oh yeah, keep doing that.
That's really
healthy.
STACY
(his gaze following another
unfortunate)
Can't you do something about your ass?
STACY
(his head turning after someone
else)
Other people's lives scare the shit out
of me.
STACY
(watching some guy rooting in a
trash bin)
"Homeless" people.
Fuck them.
Remember
when they were just bums?
Everyone with
an axe to grind.
Like to grind in their
face.
Pretty soon there'll be shit-in-
your-pants rights groups.
Stupidity
activists.
STACY
(glad he's who he is and not
who he's looking at)
Wonder what it's like being a dumb guy in
a dumb suit trying to cross the street.
STACY
(staring at another sad couple)
Life sure is a minefield.
STACY
(clocking another female)
Look at that one.
She's really been
used.
STACY
(in a contemplative mode)
I'd love to be famous so I could snub
ordinary people.
Imagine, you're famous,
you're sitting in a restaurant, some fool
comes up to you, wants you to sign your
name on his napkin, his wife is there, it
would be something these poor saps would
cherish the rest of their lives, talk
about to their cretin friends.
Bam!
You
tell 'em to FUCK OFF!
God, I'd love
that.
Suddenly Uncle John speaks.
UNCLE JOHN
Is that her?
I bet that's her.
Stacy turns.
POV
Across the street, Elaine comes out of her building.
(We're
supposing this is an apartment building somewhat worth living
in that has outdoor parking of some kind, visible from the
street, or only street parking.)
CUT.
DAY.
Elaine's car on the move.
Stacy and Uncle John in a car
following.
DAY.
Elaine and Wilson enter.
Stacy not far behind.
Catches
outside gate before it slams shut.
CUT.
DAY.
Along the way up the coast.
Through a window we SEE Valentine and Adhara enjoying a
pleasant lunch.
The bodyguards hang out by the cars outside with fast food
bags and drinks.
TOM
(to Rick)
I mean, how much are you getting?
Just
as a point of interest.
See, I didn't
realize there was a sliding scale.
AVERY
At a payphone.
His idiots in the background.
Dials a
number.
L.A.
DAY
Someone we've never seen before and will never see again
stands in Valentine's driveway.
His name is FIELDING.
A car comes up.
Another guy, GRAMMS, sits in it.
He waits.
Eventually Fielding walks over.
GRAMMS
(re:
the burnt garage)
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
FIELDING
(by rote)
My client has already given a statement
regarding yesterday's events.
GRAMMS
A statement?
I wouldn't mind getting a
statement.
You see, my client -- the
United States Government -- would love to
get a statement about a few of the deals
going down with your client.
FIELDING
Deals?
My client is involved in any
number of deals at any given moment.
You'd have to be more specific.
GRAMMS
Your client have a deal in Long Beach?
How about downtown?
There's some folks
there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.
Any
of this ring a bell?
FIELDING
My client is an entrepreneur.
I am his
lawyer, not his business manager.
GRAMMS
So you wouldn't have any idea how your
client continues to make so much fucking
money.
FIELDING
He's always been very forward-thinking.
He invested wisely.
GRAMMS
Where is he now?
FIELDING
He had urgent business in the north.
Gramms just laughs.
Just laughs and laughs.
And we leave him
laughing.
And Fielding not.
CUT.
BACK ALLEY.
Ed gets into Wilson's car.
Elaine in there too.
CUT.
DAY.
Wilson's rented car.
Heading for Big Sur.
DAY.
Onwards.
CUT.
DAY.
Wilson's car.
Closer to Big Sur.
Scenery more magnificent.
The car speeds along.
CUT.
BIG SUR.
DAY.
An impressive clifftop dwelling.
Isolated on a winding road.
On a beautiful promontory overlooking the sea.
Valentine
RINGS the DOORBELL (actually CHIME).
It's opened by his ex-
wife.
SUSAN.
Very well-maintained.
50-something.
Surprised to see him.
But not overjoyed.
VALENTINE
Hello there.
SUSAN
What are you doing here?
VALENTINE
Exercising my visitation rights.
SUSAN
Since when?
VALENTINE
I miss my kids.
SUSAN
They're at college.
Or doesn't your
accountant even tell you where the money
goes anymore.
Valentine goes inside.
EVENING.
Wilson and his friends pull in.
Get out of the car.
Stretch.
ELAINE
(finding herself at another
shithole)
What is it, you just like the reassuring
smell of disinfectant?
Wilson just heads for the motel office.
Elaine and Ed follow
a little distance behind.
ED
Hey, Elaine.
You even know what he's
saying half the time?
ELAINE
No, but I know what he means.
CUT.
BIG SUR HOUSE.
NIGHT.
Adhara sways in a hammock.
Staring at Valentine.
Wanting to
know what the hell is going on.
Valentine stands smoking at the rail, looking out over the
dark sea.
Ignoring Adhara.
Avery sits at a table.
Bodyguards visible inside the house.
VALENTINE
(finally, to Avery)
Do any of these guys cook?
CUT.
EVENING.
Wilson at the car.
Elaine and Ed watching.
Ed has gathered that something has developed between Wilson
and Elaine.
The way she's looking at Wilson.
ED
... Reminds me of Jennifer.
ELAINE
(barely perceptible nod)
Hard to miss.
Ed sighs.
Awkward.
ED
I thought maybe you just came for the
ride.
ELAINE
I'd rather be with him than without him.
I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
Wilson walks back to them.
Looking at Ed as if to say, ready
to go?
At her as if to say ... maybe farewell.
NIGHT.
Tableau.
Evening has descended.
Surfaces glisten from a
light drizzling rain.
BACK YARD.
NIGHT.
Looking toward the house, Larry in the foreground, facing us.
He takes a bite from a cinnamon granola bar, then looks at it
unhappily as he chews.
LARRY
Fuck.
NIGHT.
Looking at the house from the top of the hill.
Rick stands
in the driveway next to Valentine's car, smoking a cigarette.
REVERSE ANGLE
Wilson and Ed watching him.
Wilson nods his head to the
left, and Ed moves in that direction.
Wilson moves quietly
off to the right.
DRIVEWAY.
NIGHT.
Rick turns and looks up the driveway toward the sound.
He
puts his cigarette out.
BACK YARD.
NIGHT.
Larry has turned toward the sound as well.
Through a
partially obscured side entrance, he sees Rick walking up the
driveway.
DRIVEWAY.
NIGHT.
Rick walks away from us, toward the vehicle (the Land Cruiser
they drove here) parked up the driveway.
We lose sight of
him as he crosses to the driver's side.
The alarm goes off.
We hold for several beats.
He doesn't emerge.
BACK YARD.
NIGHT.
Tableau.
Avery exits the kitchen and takes the surrounding
porch to the bedroom.
Are we seeing this from someone's POV?
BACK PORCH.
NIGHT.
Avery makes his way to the figure, which is on its stomach
and writhing slightly.
AVERY
Careful.
Takes the gun and turns the body over.
STACY
Stares up at him, choking on his last few breaths.
AVERY
Puzzled.
What the hell is this guy doing here?
He starts
feeling around Stacy's jacket for anything useful, but is
interrupted when his hand EXPLODES, accompanied by the sound
of a gunshot.
He screams in pain.
BACK PORCH.
NIGHT.
Avery is turning toward his assailant, but not fast enough.
A shot rings out and part of his neck disappears in a blossom
of blood.
Stunned, he falls on his side, gasping.
AVERY'S POV
Uncle John.
Close by, huddled by the lip of the cliff.
He
starts to move cautiously toward Avery and Stacy.
BACK PORCH.
NIGHT.
Tom is through the sliding doors and trying to make his way
around to the driveway.
UNCLE JOHN
Crouched behind the opposite end of the porch, sticks his
head up.
HIS POV
Tom crossing to the steps, slips on the damp wood, tries to
right himself.
UNCLE JOHN
Squeezes off two shots.
TOM
Is shot in the ankle as he is about to reach the steps.
He
yelps in pain, tries to raise his gun.
UNCLE JOHN
Crouched down.
A shot flies over his head.
TOM
Stops shooting.
Tries dragging his shattered ankle to the
steps.
UNCLE JOHN
Looks over the edge of the porch.
HIS POV
Tom turning toward the steps.
UNCLE JOHN
Fires at him.
TOM
Screams again as his elbow of his gun hand disintegrates.
He
slips on the first step and tumbles down, the gun bouncing
beside him.
UNCLE JOHN
Sees this.
Stands up to cross the back porch.
Takes a step
forward but is stopped by a bullet in the chest (about the
only clean shot anybody makes).
He looks down at himself.
UNCLE JOHN
Shit.
He looks up to SEE:
AVERY
Near death.
Gun in his good hand.
He squeezes the trigger
again.
UNCLE JOHN
A small black hole appears in his cheek.
He blinks, begins
to raise his hand to his face, and collapses.
AVERY
Exhales and rolls over.
TOM
Still trying to get to his feet.
He gives up and just lies
there, panting.
A HAND
Reaches for the gun beside Tom.
Tilt up with it to reveal:
ED
He puts the gun in his jacket and slides away.
BACK PORCH.
NIGHT.
Valentine stumbles out.
Notices Avery slumped on the deck,
mortally wounded.
Goes to him -- as if concerned -- but
actually just to take the gun.
Then runs off the porch
toward the STEPS that lead down to the sea.
WILSON
Comes out after him, the knife still in his back.
So intent
on catching Valentine he fails at first to notice Avery lying
in the shadows.
AVERY
Has just barely managed to reach Stacy's pistol.
Raises it
weakly.
Points it at Wilson.
WILSON
Seems to feel it.
Turns.
Locks eyes with Avery.
Avery
could already have shot him.
But there's a momentary sense of
recognition:
both of them just foot soldiers for fat cats --
and Avery's is not worth saving.
AVERY
Lowers the gun.
Nods in the direction Valentine went.
AVERY
... that way ...
Wilson moves on.
Avery just lies there, presumably to die.
STEPS.
NIGHT.
Valentine hurries down the rickety steps.
Trying not to slip
in the darkness, though there are tiny Malibu lights
illuminating the steep and winding wooden framework.
NIGHT.
A rocky cove.
Valentine looks back up the way he came,
HEARING the FOOTSTEPS coming down after him.
Backs away a
few paces on the slippery rocks.
Falls.
Lands on the crumpled, dead body of LARRY, the bodyguard, who
was thrown off the cliff.
Valentine recoils.
When Wilson
appears, Valentine FIRES at him.
A wild shot that only makes
Wilson duck momentarily.
Valentine scrambles to his feet,
runs on.
WILSON
Jumps down from the steps.
Stops for a moment and leans his
back against the railing.
Bends at the knees slightly.
THE KNIFE
The handle is forced upward just enough to be reachable now.
WILSON
Grimacing, pulls the knife out and discards it.
FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH
Valentine runs.
Or tries to.
It's dark and the ground is
treacherous.
The beach runs out pretty soon.
Now just
rocks.
Maybe he thought he could get around the rocks on the
point at the other end.
But he can't see very far ahead.
And the tide is in, water making any escape extremely
difficult.
He tries to scramble over some rocks.
They're
wet, slippery.
He falls, cries out as he literally breaks an
ankle.
WILSON
A dark figure.
Coming into focus.
Walking inexorably this
way.
VALENTINE
Painfully rights himself.
A small bone protrudes from his
broken ankle.
He FIRES at Wilson, gun in one hand, other
hand gripping his wrist to try and steady it.
Doing his best
to aim.
But the SHOTS miss their mark.
WILSON
Steadily coming.
VALENTINE
Out of bullets now.
Gun CLICKING crazily on empty.
He
simply drops it.
WILSON
Now stands before him.
THE TWO OF THEM
Both breathing hard.
WILSON
Tell me.
This is not what Valentine expected.
VALENTINE
What.
WILSON
Tell me.
VALENTINE
Tell you ...
WILSON
About Jenny.
(closer)
Tell me about Jenny.
(closer)
About the deal.
Whatever fucking deal
you had to kill my daughter for when she
found out about it, you bastard.
Wilson drops to the ground too, in a passionate fury, starts
strangling Valentine.
WILSON
Tell me.
Tell me about it, you fucking
bastard.
Easing up just enough for Valentine to sputter out a
response.
VALENTINE
She could've had the deal!
I would've
handed it to her if she wanted.
I would
have given her everything.
WILSON
Why then.
Why did you do it!
They're locked in a kind of embrace.
Sprayed by the waves
crashing into the rocks.
Sweating and gasping and exhausted
and hurt and furious.
VALENTINE
She didn't want to share it, she wanted
to stop it.
To stop me.
She said she'd
turn me in.
WILSON
Shock of recognition on his face.
At those words.
VALENTINE
She said, "You go ahead with this, I'll
turn you in, Terry."
Wilson sits back.
Panting.
Totally spent.
The two of them.
Both on the ground now.
Whatever energy they had left drained
-- Valentine from his confession, Wilson from hearing it.
Valentine shaking, sobbing.
Still not realizing the pathetic
folly of his actions.
VALENTINE
She was serious.
She would have done it.
She had the phone in her hand.
She was
going to do it.
WILSON
Knows that the girl he loved ... loved Valentine, too.
Having
heard the truth, the last vestige of revenge has vanished.
He gets up and walks away.
Leaving the quivering shell of
Valentine behind.
CUT.
